1387229,5,B000051S5M,"Mike White's strangely fascinating little movie is one of those rare masterpieces that hits all the right notes; there is not a moment in this movie that does not feel utterly real, it even looks like a grainy documentary, as if we are seeing something private unfold.  Buck, a repressed, sad, obsessive man-child, cannot move past his childhood experiences with Chuck, his best friend.  The turns that this story takes are alternately funny, touching, disturbing, and complex.  Mike White's performances is extraordinary; it is a testament to his enormous talents that you leave this movie with a tremendous sense of feeling -- melancholy, sadness, even a little bit of hope.  A complete surprise, and one of the best movies of the past year.",980640000,8,743,5.016260162601626
1387230,2,B000051S5M,"Cool flick. I liked the Paul Weitz ""bad actor"" character a lot, and for that alone I would check it out. It has some interesting turns, and you are caught off guard a couple of times. Original, quirky, and rough. If you like this kind of thing, rent it.",980380800,,253,4.183673469387755
1387231,4,B000051S5M,"I give this movie 4 stars for its originality and twisted sickness, but I liked ""Happiness"" too, so go figure.

1387232,5,B000051S5M,"i was blown away by this movie. the guy who played buck was so dorky/creepy/loveable/hilarious/riveting that i was simultaneously feeling his pain and suffering skin-crawling squeamishness at the very sight of him.
plus, before the movie reached the shocker of the consummation in the motel room, there was something so distinctly unlikeable about the other guy, the so-called normal one. this was a smart move by the filmmakers. as an audience, we are made to feel that the hideous freak might actually be onto something when he asks whether chuck's job is really ""real"" and when he lumps chuck's fiancee in with chuck's possessions (e.g. car, house) while analyzing chuck's feelings about them.
there is something so pure and undeniable about poor buck's obsession -- about his utter defenselessness in the face of it -- that one can't help loving him. the shot of him at the wedding at the very end is simultaneously heart-breaking and improbably optimistic, i thought.
the casting of the guy who acted the role of chuck in 'the play within the play' was brilliant. so was the guy's performance. (it was an added, solondz-like bonus that we could literally see the shape of the man's penis thru his too-tight jeans during his audition in the community theater.)
equally spectacular was the scene in which buck offers a lollipop to a child actor and then stands by while the kid sets off a firecracker and nearly blows himself to bits.
i can't say enough good things about this movie. it was creepy in the very best way.",978566400,8,1522,4.835249042145594
1387233,4,B000051S5M,"Saw Chuck and Buck today, had to return it to my local Blockbuster Video.  Very disturbing.  I can't quite comment on the film, too fresh in my mind and far too 'out there'.  And mind you, I watched Gummo and thought it was perfectly sane.  I was just curious what was that song played throughout the movie?  I had to return the movie so fast that I forgot to watch the music credits, and now I want that song.  Alas.  If you are reading this and could tell me, please email me at creindl@purdue.edu the name of the song so I can go out and get it.

1387234,5,B000051S5M,"He is also partly responsible for the best television series ever, an underapprecicated masterpiece called ""Freaks and Geeks"".  It is now on, of all places Fox Family Channel on Tuesday evenings.  If you watch it you will be treated to some of the same brilliance as this film.  Shots that don't pull away, even when something embarassing is happening to someone you begin to care about.  Characters so real, with flaws yet you still see their humanity and even strengths.  Hilarious scenes that come out of mundane daily things and never a pat ending,  even if you do perceive it to be happy.  This movie is a must if you are tired of the stuff we're force fed and the series ""Freak  and Geeks"" will piss you off that NBC was so evil for not giving  it a proper shot, or maybe people like being force fed?  By the way special mention to F & G's cast and the shows creators, if Chuck and Buck is any indication of what to expect then some of us will have an alternative.

1387235,4,B000051S5M,"Many reviews of ""Chuck & Buck"" correctly focus on the development of the characters, mainly Buck (Mike White), and as far as it goes, White's performance is first-rate.  Once the movie gets going, however, it's Chuck (Chris Weitz) who proves to be the more intriguing of the two. Surrounded by the all the trappings of ""grown up"" success, Chuck/Charlie is the apparent antithesis to the arrested adolescence of Buck, but in an unexpected turn, he succumbs to his own desire to recapture the past.
Ultimately, then, it's not Buck's story but Chuck's.  While Buck initially comes across as pathetic and disturbing, there are plenty of subtle indicators that Chuck's ""adult"" life is equally so.",977529600,3,691,5.052631578947368
1387236,4,B000051S5M,"Chuck and Buck were childhood friends, until Chuck moved away.  Now both of them are all grown up.  Chuck (now called Charlie) comes to visit Buck when Buck's mother dies.  Buck, however, never really grew up.  He sucks on lollipops obsessively, and is now fixated on Chuck, who wants nothing more to do with his childhood best friend.  It gets even creepier when we find out what Buck wants from Chuck (""Remember those games we used to play?"")
Most people, on hearing that synopsis, would immediately dismiss ""Chuck and Buck"" as weird and truly creepy.  But give it a chance.  It's always fascinating and never false.  Its strengths lie in characterizing Buck not as a caricature but as a real human being who we can feel sorry for, and even see a little of ourselves in.  The two main characters of Chuck and Buck could easily have ruined the movie if they had been played even a small bit off.  Mike White and Chris Weitz both find the true nature of their characters, making this film nothing less than believable.",977443200,26,1018,4.605555555555555
1387237,4,B000051S5M,"This ain't your regular stalker comedy. Or maybe, it's not a stalker comedy at all. Maybe it's a bizzare and slightly voyeuristic look into the life of a lonely, slightly obsessive man-boy, Buck (Mike White)and his best friend Chuck (Chris Weitz), who have sadly drifted apart. The death of Buck's mother brings Chuck and Buck back together, and not for the best. Buck is sadly stuck in the past, and can't accept that Chuck has moved on. He deals with his obsession by writing a slightly disturbing but heart warming play about two young boys growing up. With terrific performances, a great screenplay and a hauntingly pop-ish soundtrack, Chuck and Buck is the one to watch.",975715200,3,675,4.827586206896552

1387275,2,B000051S5M,"Like everyone else I thought I was going to see a comedy. However, I still saw the potential for a really good film. Buck is 27 with the mentality of an 11 yr old, he literally has toys and lollipops all over his bedroom. His mom has been his caretaker and sole link to the outside world. So when she dies he latches onto Chuck, an old childhood friend who apparently is the only other person that he has ever had a relationship with. When they were 11 Chuck and Buck used to play ""games"" which were really their way of sexual experimenting as kids. He begins to stalk Chuck and his fiancee and his behavior becomes increasingly disturbing.

Understandably Chuck wants nothing to do with Buck. He's basically the socially awkward version of Glen Close's character in Fatal Attraction. In addition, Chuck seems to consider what they did as kids as nothing but sexual experimentation and has moved on with his life. But Buck is obviously obsessed with Chuck.

The plot definitely had my interest but it was it's execution that ruined everything. The movie is from the point of view of Buck who I initially felt sympathy for. However it is apparent as the movie goes on that although he has childlike qualities Buck is anything but innocent. He is calculating and dangerous. Because of his childlike qualities people in the film make increasingly dumb decisions in reaction to Buck's behavior because they think he is harmless. Chuck 's wife was a virtual saint. After everything Buck did she has a sit down with him and informs him she knows about what Chuck and Buck did as children and it's something alot of kids do. But seeing as his behavior has become obsessive she gives him the number of a doctor. Personally, I would have gotten a restraining order.

What ultimately ruined the movie for me was the ending and the messages it sent. In the climax of the film Buck shows himself for the sexual predator he really is. He follows Chuck to a bar and tells him he will leave him alone forever but only if Chuck spends the night with him. Since he has had a few drinks Chuck agrees. When Buck kisses Chuck he appears to like it, even though he has spent the entire film trying to avoid Buck. In the final scene Buck is at Chuck 's wedding happily eating cake.

If I were a gay man I would be offended by the themes in this movie. Basically if you stalk someone long enough they will eventually give in because no doesn't really mean no, it just means not yet. If that fails you can threaten them so they will have sex with you and who knows they might enjoy it or at least pretend to enjoy it because they are scared of you. In the end Buck is rewarded for all of his psychopathic behavior. Ridiculous. The other thing that was out of left field is Chuck is portrayed as straight the whole movie, but at the end it hints he may have been suppressing homosexual feelings this entire time, all he needed was the threat of unending harassmemt by psycho Chuck to find his true self.

 In alot of movies sexuality is solely black and white, the characters are either gay or straight. What's wrong with having a straight male character who is comfortable enough in his sexuality to admit to having experimented as an adolescent? I thought that was the direction they were going to go in because the wife acknowledged it and was so supportive and sympathetic. It seems like most movies (even artsy fartsy Indies like this one) want to put everyone in a box with a label on it. I was really disappointed in this movie.",1395187200,3,3510,4.4765625

1387295,3,B000051S5M,"Following the death of his mother, Buck (Mike White), an extremely immature 27 year old, moves to L.A. in order to reestablish the friendship he had with his childhood best friend Chuck (Chris Weitz). However, when it turns out that Chuck has moved on with his life and doesn't want anything to do with Buck anymore, Buck essentially becomes a stalker in his effort to win back Chuck from Chuck's ""evil"" girlfriend.

""Chuck and Buck"" is yet another one of those weird, slightly-off movies that will either fascinate or disgust, much like ""Happiness"" and ""Spanking the Monkey"". I, personally, enjoy films of this type and enjoyed ""Chuck and Buck"". Mike White, who also wrote the script, is perfect as the weirdo Buck, and he did a good job of writing a script that makes you feel for both of the main characters. Neither character is ""evil"" or trying to hurt the other. They are just behaving like two human beings who both have a different take on events that happened 16 years ago, which is what makes this film fascinating...up to a point. The fact that Chuck and Buck do, deep down, care for one another, means that the film's third act is a bit of an anti-climax. I guess that I was sort of hoping that the film would end with an over-the-top ""Fatal Attraction""-esque showdown between Chuck and Buck. It doesn't. In fact, the film loses focus at the very end, making me wonder whether Mike White was having trouble thinking up an ending. Nevertheless, until the final 15 minutes, this is a very food film (if you're into this sort of thing).

After making ""Chuck and Buck"", writer/actor Mike White and director Miguel Artera went on to make ""The Good Girl"". Unlike ""Chuck and Buck"", this film does manage to hold up until the end, and is, in fact, one of my favourite films. If you like ""Chuck and Buck"", I recommend watching ""The Good Girl"" as well.",1228521600,,1854,4.598187311178248

1387297,2,B000051S5M,"Chuck and Buck is another underwhelming shot-on-video indie that isn't nearly as good as it thinks it is or needs to be to justify its feature length. The biggest problem is Mike White's character, an infantile gay stalker obsessed with the childhood friend who has moved on in the world. The premise is workable, but White's own script never develops him beyond a single defining note, which makes for an increasingly unbelievable lead easily outshone by the supporting players - not so much Chris Weitz as the object of his obsession but definitely by Paul Weitz as a spectacularly bad lookalike actor Chuck casts in a frightening autobiographical play and Lupe Ontiveros as the show's down to earth director. It does pick up as it goes along and it's not unwatchable, it's just one of those films that really offers too few reasons to see it.",1131840000,,845,4.794520547945205
1387318,4,B000051S5M,"This cleverly conceived film could be called a new twist on the theme of obsessive love, yet that would not really do it justice. ""Chuck and Buck"" explores the classic tale of unrequited longing not only from a new angle, but attempts to sound the very depths of that longing.

Directed with great assurance by Miguel Arteta and written by Mike White (who also plays Buck), this is a film that really succeeds in taking an audience somewhere they have (probably) never been. Nearly everyone can relate to a tale of frustrated love. Buck's monomaniacal fixation of his love object is nothing new to movies. This character could recall John Heard in ""Chilly Scenes of Winter"" or Isabelle Adjani in ""The Story of Adele H."". And, like those and myriad other lovesick character studies, ""Chuck and Buck"" offers the viewer some basis of the obsession. Where the newer film is unique is in the extremely close observation of a lovestruck character as a manchild. Buck has-in the deepest emotional sense-truly never left his childhood behind. His bedroom is replete with every little-boy accessory: piles of boxed board games, stuffed animals, and the persistent motif, an illuminated plastic globe that displays lollypops. When his mother dies at the outset of the film, Buck-now 27-instantly transfers his emotional dependency onto Chuck, his best friend from childhood. Not surprisingly, the latter has moved forward into an adult life. Chuck has gone to LA, taken a job with an independent recording company, and gotten himself engaged. Buck tracks his old friend down, inviting him to his mother's funeral, and wastes no time in letting Chuck know that the special quality of their childhood relationship-a sexual one-has not been forgotten. In fact, Buck wants to take right up where they left off some sixteen years ago. As might be expected, Chuck, his fiancee in tow, heads immediately for the Hollywood Hills. When the indomitable Buck relocates himself to LA to pursue his romantic destiny, the two men embark upon one of the oddest and most wrenching psychodramas yet encountered on screen.

Among many notable aspects of the film is its completely unapologetic attitude to homosexuality. Buck certainly has a problem, but it is one of infantilism, not of sexual orientation. Even in moments of dire frustration at Buck's relentless advances, Chuck never condemns his friend for who he is. For some, an identification of homosexuality with infantilism may be seen as a subtext here. But to this reviewer, the sexuality issue serves a more symbolic end: these childhood friends whose names rhyme are two sides of one coin. They have more in common than Chuck, perhaps, would admit and their bond goes deeper than even Buck could know.

Chris Weitz does good work bringing an exasperated Chuck to life. Although his character is much less finely drawn, Chuck can elicit as much audience-identification as Buck does. Weitz' facial expressions, as realizations slowly dawn upon him are expert and compelling. In the role of a neighborhood theater guardian angel, Lupe Ontiveros is a marvel. She finds the exact key to a character who discovers herself through association with the enigmatic Buck. Best of all is Mike White as Buck, a textbook case of perfect casting. White could not look more suited to the role: his slightly drooping, half-open mouth and shock of red hair are both comic and oddly endearing. So identified with is White with Buck that it is difficult to avoid thinking the role is somewhat autobiographical.

In a film of many fascinating and clever touches, one especially stands out. Running out of avenues to Chuck, Buck decides to write and produce a play about his frustrating friendship. With the help of the Ontiveros character and some hilarious backstage tribulations, the play is performed and, as a conciliatory gesture, attended by Chuck. The upshot of this entertaining, but disturbing episode is unexpected and moving.

Shot on digital video tape by Chuy Chavez, the film has a fuzzy, home-movie quality. And the many hand-held shots have only a slight documentary feeling, due to the complete lack of any sense of improvisation in this tightly scripted venture. ""Chuck and Buck"" takes chances with it characters and its narrative. While some of its components may work better than others, it boldly questions the meaning of emotional maturity and friendship.

1387319,3,B000051S5M,"The box paints this movie as a comedy. It perhaps can be viewed that way, but it is really the tragedy of Buck obsessed with his childhood friend Chuck. He can't understand that Chuck on longer wants to play the sex games they had so much fun with as children.

Buck is also like a moth to flame with a Chuck look-alike who also has no sexual interest in him. He is powerless to look elsewhere for love.

The movie does not have a Hollywood ending, nothing particularly resolved, just like real life, with a little hope of better things to come.

Buck has some minor mental problem. His directness gets him in repeated trouble. This is a weird movie the way it pulls at your heartstrings getting you to sympathsise with an idiot, who stands flawed, oddly symbolic of everyman.",1124928000,4,776,4.48936170212766

1387321,4,B000051S5M,"What a surprising beautiful and tragic film that Mike White has created.  I say Mike White instead of the director (who also did an exemplary job) because it was his penmanship that crafted this film into such a powerhouse.  When I rented the film, I did not expect to be so submerged with so many bold styles and emotional thematic elements.  I was not expecting to see such a high caliber of acting and storytelling mixed together into one small Sundance winning picture.  In other words, I wasn't expecting really anything when I placed this film into my DVD player, so when the film finished and I picked my jaw off the floor, it became instantly clear that I would never experience another film like this one again.  From the way that it was filmed, to the small budget of the production, to even the taboo subject it presented, Chuck & Buck is one of those films that will shock, amaze, and really pull at the strings of your heart.  It is a film, first and foremost, about friendship and the destructive impact that childhood moments can have on our futures.

I cannot speak of this film without mentioning first the brilliant mind of Mike White.  Not only did he accomplish the first challenge of this film ... writing it, but he also stole the entire film by also playing one of the leads, Buck.  While most film watchers, sadly, will remember him as Jack Black's friend in School of Rock, his true talents are completely showcased in this film.  He completely looses himself in this character and it is absolutely obvious to those of us watching the film.  During all of this film, I never once saw Mike White, the actor, but instead I saw the character of Buck.  That is a rare accomplishment in the acting world.  Nine times out of ten in these types of films, you are handed moments where the actor or actress is simply themselves with a different type of voice.  That is not the case with Mike White, he completely embodies his character.  From the hand motions, voice, and even reactions, he is Buck.  He is the character he has set out to play.  This can happen because you can tell he is very compelled to this character.  He is not into the story for the money, but instead to tell the story as honestly as possible.  This was very obvious throughout the film.  These actors, now directors and writers, placed their heart and soul into this picture, and it seeped through the television.  This is truly one of those rare instances where you could see why people decide to make films.

While I wasn't overly impressed with the acting ability of Chris Weitz (since Mike White overshadowed him), he did help contribute to the overall scheme of the story.  This is a thrilling tale, and it is difficult to see it as the comedy that IMDb has labeled.  This was a completely human story told with such precise honesty and honor that I have no doubts that anyone that watches it will walk away with a different perspective.  This wasn't your typical ""stalker"" film, there were so many different and deep layers to this story that you could easily watch it three or four times a day and still get caught up in a different aspect.  I don't know if this makes sense or not, but there were moments when I could see the friendship, the insanity, and the sorrow.  The ending brought the story full circle and really had me in suspense until the final moments.  Nothing is handed to you right away, as the story develops, you are shown more and more until the utter power of this film is hanging on your own shoulders.  It is deep and amazing, and I cannot stop using that word ""amazing"" enough.

Overall, I thought this was an exceptional film for 2000.  I think that White should have been handed more and more acting roles throughout the years, but it still makes me happy to see him writing.  This was a film about friends who never quite left their childhood years, and have been waiting for that one moment to close the door of to their past.  This is not a film for everyone, but if chosen to explore will reveal some thickly layered characters with superb acting by Mr. White.  This is a drama that carries relevance in today's society and will continue forever to be a cultural staple in the film world.  I loved it, and hope others will see the powerful nature of Chuck & Buck.

I saw it in the theater when it first came out and ever since it has been one of my favorite independents ever.  Mike White is brilliant in the role of Buck as are Chris and Paul Weitz.  The writing is shocking, disturbing, funny and poignant all at the same time.  Even the digital is well shot and never takes you out of the film.

Plotwise, it meanders and never comes to any kind of rational conclusion.  The acting is tedious & drab, which is exceptionally depressing given Mike White's talent.
The most appalling aspect of this movie?  The overall lesson learned is that if you stalk a person long and hard enough, regardless of how often they tell you to leave them alone, you will finally win them over.  Oh, well done.",1064880000,,817,5.059701492537314

1387338,4,B000051S5M,"When Buck, an immature 27-year-old, is reunited with his best friend, Chuck, a successful music industry executive, his resulting infatuation threatens to ruin Chuck's previously stable existence. CHUCK & BUCK successfully blends comedy, drama, and stalker films and is made all the more immediate by Miguel Arteta's decision to shoot on digital video. This, coupled with the striking performances by the two leads--both nonprofessional actors (Mike White and Chris Weitz are successful screenwriters)--results in a highly original film that can't easily be categorized.

""Chuck and Buck"" is a disturbing but fascinating film. I have been in both Chuck's shoes (I had a guy in my math class who would not leave me alone, to the point of following me around constantly, asking me out, and calling me) and in Buck's (I was in love with my best friend for two years and went through hell because of it), and let me tell you, neither side is pretty. That's why ""Chuck and Buck"" is so powerful. It is an extremely real depiction of a stalker and his stalkee. Sure, it's hard to take at times, but the writing, directing, and especially acting, are brilliant.
An expert at finding the humanity in seemingly irredeemable characters, director Miguel Arteta (The Good Girl) touches more than a few raw nerves, and he taps into the characters' memories through dreamlike footage of young boys and the use of an insidiously catchy kiddie-pop ditty. ""Chuck & Buck"" is the sort of film that burrows under the skin by refusing to establish the expected cinematic distance between the audience and the bizarre man-child at its center. It may freak us out, but it's never a freak show. Good times!",1050192000,4,1681,4.960992907801418
1387339,3,B000051S5M,"Well, this movie isn't quite what I expected, especialy since it was categorized a comedy. I read the reviews when the movie came out, and they were terrific, so i decided to pick it up.
First of all, let me get my technical concerns out of the way. This film was shot on DV, and it looks a lot worse than I would expect. I know DV can look a lot better, even little hand held prosumer DV cameras like Lars von Trier used in the 100 camera musical sequences of ""Dancer in the Dark."" Even well shot Hi-8 should look better than this. Anyway, given that it was shot in DV I would also have expected the transfer to have been much better than it was, Given that the extra step of digitizing the film has been removed. Instead we see a lot of artefacting which suggests a real lack of attention while compressing & encoding the video to fit on a DVD. One huge problem is that skin tones frequently block up into large patches of yellow, making the characters faces look jaundiced. Another problem is that much of this film was shot in real life situations, with real life lighting, and frequently the contrast level between ambient sunlight/lamplight and shadows is too great to hold detail, and so we have highlights being blown out and shadows blocking up. Hey, I know it's an indie, but it seems a little silly to use a 60 watt desk lamp as your primary light source. It can't be too difficult to set up a simple studio light, location or not. This sort of problem should have been immediately identified and rectified while shooting the film, since you can see the finished product immediately after you shoot instead of waiting for the dailies or anything like that. It just seems plain sloppy (or ultra-low budget, which this film isn't), to me. On a final note, one reviewer said that this DVD isn't letterboxed, but it is letterboxed (and anamorphic, too).
As for the movie itself, I certainly wouldn't call it a comedy. Sure, there are sections that are funny, but the issues are serious and the tone is much more dramatic.
The characters seem fairly true to me, and I don't think that any of them act in truly unexpected or unbelieveable ways.  A number people have said they found Chuck's reactions to be strange, but they seem quite realistic to me. It is understandable that he doesn't go to the police or tell his wife about Buck... the simple fact of the matter is that he doesn't want anyone to know about his nascent homosexual experiences with Buck, so he's not likely to go around provoking Buck or telling his wife about it (especially since he still seems to have homosexual tendencies, if his later aquiescence to Buck's propositioning is any indication).
Some have derided the misogynistic attitude adopted (by Buck)towards Chuck's wife, but she really comes accross as quite sympathetic in my mind. Buck isn't intended to be a symapthetic character, as some people seem to think. He is intended to be a real character, good and bad, just like Chuck. I don't think we neccessarily love either of them, but we don't hate them either because we can understand what they are feeling (or at least we are allowed to understand them, though it sems that not everyone who watches the movie does) and why they behave the way they do. Their lives aren't simple, they face dilemmas and make difficult decisions just as we do, and they are as flawed as any of us.
Well, it seems as though the movie itself is pretty good, but I only give it 3 stars because for me film is an intensely visual medium, and this film is very lacking from a visual standpoint. The cinematography is uninteresting, the transfer is terrible, I don't think the acting was all that great (though the scripting made the characters believeable), and I'm not sure that the storyline is all that appealing to me (though, as I say, the story was well executed for what it was).",1047945600,,3855,4.554755043227666

This is a real-life movie and that's why people are so squirmish about it. The end will satisy anyone - creepy or normal to the hilt.

I am not going to go in depth about my take on the movie since many people have done a superb job (and my memory is terrible). My response is only to the people who I saw rating this movie poorly (probably US viewers, as someone pointed out).
It is probably very challenging to the US consciousness. I noticed that a lot of these reviewers seem to be looking for ""direction,"" substance, a ""root"" cause, or point of the movie. This audience is probably more use to watching the typical Hollywood-- conservative, repetitive, and mind numbing (instant gratification, 1+1 = 2) movie. I hope, however, that people will remain open to films such as ""Chuck & Buck"" to see how the formula that Hollywood follows is not the framework that all movies function by.

1387345,1,B000051S5M,"I don't know how or why this movie keeps being classified as a comedy.  Other than a few humorous lines, I don't find it particularly funny.  I don't find it particularly enjoyable either.
The plot centers around Chuck (Chris Weitz), a man in his late 20s who has never really grown up.  He responds to the world like a 12 year old.  I don't think he's intended to be mentally challenged.  It's played more as a case of arrested development.  When his mother dies, he reaches out to the one other person in the world to whom he can relate, his best friend Buck (scriptwriter Mike White).  Chuck and Buck were inseparable as kids, but since high school, Buck has moved on.  He now works for a recording agency in L.A.  Chuck (who seems to have money, but I'm not sure where or how.  He doesn't appear to have a job.  His mother was sick for years, so she wasn't working.  So where the money came from, I don't know) moves to L.A. to be closer to Buck and to resume their friendship.  He pretty much becomes a stalker.  It's not funny.
Okay, so when they were kids, Chuck and Buck had a sexual relationship at Buck's instigation.  The movie is not clear as to whether or not this is the root of Chuck's arrested development.  Chuck has never gotten over that relationship.  Buck is engaged to be married to a woman, the relationship with Chuck having been nothing more than kids' stuff in his mind.  There is terrific material for a moving and powerful movie here, but Mike White as a writer doesn't rise to the occasion.  He seems to go out of his way to avoid dealing with the issue of Buck's possible responsibility for the man Chuck has become (or never become).
And that is the root of my problem with this movie.  There is no authorial or directorial point of view on these characters.  I have no idea what the creators want us to think or feel about them.  Personally, I find myself not liking any of them.  It's not necessary to like any or all of the characters in a movie in order to enjoy it (think ""Citizen Kane""), but there has to be some connection made between the characters and the audience.  I found myself curious about the ramifications of Buck and Chuck's childhood relationship, but as the creators never deal with it, there was nothing to hold the movie together in my mind.  Stuff happens and then it ends--there's no real story in the traditional sense.
The movie was shot with digital cameras and looks it.  The lighting changes from shot to shot and because of the use of real locations, there are many sequences that look incredibly claustrophobic because there was little room on the location for the actors, camera, and crew.  The DVD is not letterboxed.  The commentary from Mike White and director Miguel Artega does not offer any insight into what they were trying to say or accomplish with the characters.  There are plenty of other extras on the DVD, but I have not explored them as the movie (after three viewings) has failed to inspire me enough to dig any deeper.  This is a DVD that I have every intention of culling from my collection.
A movie of similar interest (and impact):  ""Ghost World""",1014163200,8,3130,4.486725663716814
1387346,4,B000051S5M,"""Chuck & Buck"" is not an enjoyable experience.  You won't leave the theatre (or turn off the VCR/DVD player) humming a happy tune, content that the world is in good hands.  It aims to disturb.  Someone once said that the difference between mainstream and independent cinema is that mainstream cinema will confirm all your belief systems.  ""Chuck & Buck"" is thus emblematic of independent cinema, which seeks to turn your belief systems upside down, challenging them with otherwise unheard of notions that might make you uncomfortable.  Or in this case, creepy.
Buck is the main repository of this creepiness.  A 27-year old manchild, Buck has recently lost his mother, and reacquainted himself with childhood friend Chuck.  Buck, as played by Mike White, has horrid teeth, blank eyes, and a wardrobe better suited for a third grader.  Not a man suited for survival in the outside world.  But Buck has a passion that can't be quenched.  That passion is Chuck.
Chuck, er, Charles, signs rock bands in Los Angeles.  He has a charmingly social fiancee, Carlin, with whom he lives in a comfortable home.  Charles has done a fine job until now of forgetting his childhood best friend, but once he's caught again in Buck's web, he can't seem to get himself out of it again.  Chris Weitz, who plays Chuck, looks like Tom Cruise after a boxing match with Mike Tyson.  He gets Chuck's exasperation just right, and never dwells too deep into his anger.
The rest of the cast is minimal and unremarkable.  Except, of course, for Lupe Ontiveros, who I've only ever seen play ""the maid"" (check out her filmography; the word is liberally peppered through her list of character names).  Ontiveros neatly pulls off Beverly, house manager turned creative director of a small theatre company.  She is imbued with street wisdom, blind passion, and fine maternal instincts, especially when it comes to guiding Buck.
White, who doubles as the film's screenwriter, doesn't rely on flashy or stylish dialogue.  Rather he goes for something much more real.  Buck speaks in a stilted stutter that exposes his lack of intellect and maturity.  Chuck can barely get out two sentences at a time, except when he's schmoozing with record industry types.  The effect this has is that the characters become less like characters and more like real people.  Couple this with the low-rent digital video cinematography, and what you get is a fictional movie that could easily pass for documentary.  Further help with the script may have come from Chris Weitz and his brother Paul, who co-screenwrote the horrible ""American Pie"" movies.  Paul also has a role here, playing a horribly untalented actor.  Having three screenwriter's in the cast, which might have made the whole endeavor more verbose, actually made things more concise, and contributed to a fine screenplay.  (Alas, a similar compliment could not be paid to ""Armageddon"", which had 4 screenwriters in its cast)
As for the ending, well, I concur with the general consensus.  Chuck's ""choice"" comes out of left field, for we don't really know what happened in his childhood.  In hindsight, it appears to make sense once we fill in the gaps ourselves.  Still, it's a bold move for the movie to make, trusting that its already perplexed audience is willing to go down one last road less traveled.  This ending confused me at first, but upon further reflection it made just enough sense to be justified.  Just like the rest of the movie.",1005782400,5,3456,4.917098445595855
1387367,5,B000051S5M,"From the moment the theme song, ""Freedom of the Heart"" (the ""oodley, oodley, oodley"" song) was played on the soundtrack over the opening titles, this film had me hooked.
No time was wasted getting us right into the story.
And for all the bizarreness showcased here, the acting -- indeed, the whole production -- is generally superb.
You will never see anything like Mike White -- as Buck -- in another movie. He plays this character with simple goofy honesty, doesn't round off the odd corners, and avoids the stupid ""actorliness"" which most Hollywood performers would bring to similar roles -- think Billy Bob Thornton in ""Sling Blade"", Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump"", etc.
The rest of the cast is consistently superb. Especially Lupe Ontiveros. She brings to her role a sensibility that is sadly missing from the work of many actors. She's not trying desperately to entertain us. She's just doing her job. And, sure enough, we're entertained. Amazing how that happens.
The casting of brothers Chris Weitz (as Charlie ""Chuck"" Sitter) and Paul Weitz (as Sam, (...) untalented, (...) with very grandiose illusions about his possibilities as an actor) is a wonderful touch. The characters need to be physically similar since Sam is selected to act the ""Chuck"" part in a play Buck scripts -- but these guys are terrific. Where Chris Weitz is all restrained cool and control, Paul Weitz hits the mark in every one of his scenes portraying Sam as (...) unabashed(,) he is without making the character into a caricature.
There are so many fine moments in this film. Director Miguel Arteta and company did a great job.
You get the feeling they made a genuine attempt to understand the story they were filming. That shouldn't be the sign of an exceptional film...but sadly it is these days.
""Chuck and Buck"" (...)displays an astonishing amount of heart, compassion, and psychological savvy.
Sure, if you were relating the plot to someone, they might stop you and say, ""What? Are you kidding me? Who would want to see a creepy film like that?"" But they'd be wrong.
This film portrays the creeps -- and all of the characters -- as human beings. Disturbed imperfect human beings, yes. But human beings nevertheless!
This is a truly rare American film.",1004572800,4,2237,4.858638743455497
1387368,5,B000051S5M,"I must admit, I was a little put off by the newspaper reviews that I read about ""Chuck & Buck"". The subject of psyhological stalkers and arrested development are not two subjects that would appeal to a mass market. But, a friend of mine offered to loan me his DVD of the film. It took me a few days to get the nerve to watch it. All of my fears were unfounded. This is an incredible movie, which has a depth that is not found in conventional Hollywood movies. It makes no apologies, and is gritty and to the point.
Mike White, who plays Buck, helped write the screenplay for ""Dead Man On Campus"", which initially piqued my interest in this odd movie. I mean ""odd"" in a good way. I like quirky movies, and this is definitely one of them. Chris Weiz, who portrays Chuck, is also an underestimated talent. He co-wrote and co-directed ""American Pie"" and ""American Pie 2"". Besides the ""Behind The Scenes"" of ""American Pie"", I've never seen him until this movie. Both gentleman are not your typical beautiful Hollywood actors, which makes this movie even more enjoyable. I do believe everyone knows someone like Chuck and Buck.
The presentation of this movie reminds me of a mix of ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" and the lovely British film ""Beautiful Thing"". The lighting is very effective, considering this was filmed digitally. Many people will be turned off by the subject matter, which consists of sexual ambiguity and the apparent stalking of Chuck by Buck. I don't consider it stalking, really. I feel that Buck has suffered a great loss (his mother dying) and has been treated like a child his whole life, he needs someone to cling to who is familiar. Chuck has been Buck's pal since childhood. Chuck has moved on into adulthood, yet Buck has stayed childlike.
There are very fine performances by the supporting cast, most notably Lupe Ontiveros, who portrayed Yolanda Saldivar in ""Selena"". Finally she doesn't portray a stereotypical Latina, yet she portrays a very straightforward person, who sees what's going on between Chuck and Buck. Without saying a word, she speaks volumes with her face. But also, her dialogue is the funniest stuff you'll ever hear in an indie film. She's so abrasive and to point. What a breakthrough performance by such a highly underrated actress!
Hollywood should take note of movies like this. Even though the subject matter is tough to digest, it is one that could truly happen. Not all movies should have happy endings, and not all characters should be sweet and gorgeous. I love the dialogue of this film. It's almost ad-lib in the style of ""Annie Hall"" blended with Andy Warhol's ""Trash"". I believe that many will be shocked at the characters. Not that they are shocking in an odd sense, but shocking as in you will actually know these people. Everyone knows these characters, in some form.
I highly recommend this movie! It is one that you will want to see over and over, just to get a deeper sense on where these wonderfully conceived characters are coming from. This is indeed in my collection now. You will not be disappointed in the least if you love real, true, gritty and, in some way...great characterizations of true to life personaes.

Of course, this is the sort of uncompromisingly deranged tragicomedy that is going to wholly upset some of the more mainstream PC viewers.  I was willing to take some leaps simply because I couldn't take my eyes off of it, and the film just kept pulling me in deeper and deeper.  On top of that, Lupe Ontiveros is hilarious and lovingly human theatre manager who supplies Buck with some reality-testing (""Honey, I'm a mess!"" she tells Buck at one moment).  Chuck and Buck are also rendered three-dimensionally (as two dimensional characters coming into three dimensions, I should qualify).
Consider it sort of a no-budget ""Mr. Ripley"" that could be peversely summed up as ""The Graduate"" of the year 2000 in its handling of uncomfortable issues where 'arrested development' teeters on the edge of sociopathy (well, in Ripley, it topples over, for sure).
What's affecting here is the final scene where Chuck does tell Buck ""Yes, I remember you.""  The terms leading up to the encounter are iffy, but it's at that moment one realizes that Chuck has been as 'arrested' in his own way as the childlike Buck.  Neither can progress to the future until the past is healed.",992995200,3,1420,4.7560975609756095

I know this type well, because I am currently dating one, and he persuaded me to view this film with him.  What a waste of two hours of my time!
Before I receive hate mail for being ""mainstream,"" let me make it plain that I have enjoyed many films which are off the beaten path: Maurice, My Beautiful Launderette, Beethoven's Nephew, or the recent (WONDERFUL) Big Eden, the list goes on and on.  Unfortunately, the main characters of this tiresome little opus have no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and neither does the script. 
Buck, the main character, is an emotionally retarded man in his late 20s, who has never moved past an early adolescent sexual experience with his best friend, Chuck, who HAS grown up and is preparing to get married. After Buck's mother dies (the first scene in the movie, a charming way to start a film, don't you think?) Chuck attends the funeral, where Buck makes a pass at his old friend in the restroom. When Chuck rejects Buck's advance, he remains undeterred, and moves to Los Angeles to, in effect stalk Chuck.
While Mike White tries to portray Buck as fragile and lovable, he merely comes across as creepy and irritating. Frankly, I wound up having more sympathy for Chuck and his fiance, and kept wondering why they didn't go to the police for a restraining order. That's what any real person would have done. In another instance of unreality, Buck befriends a young boy who injures his hand with a firecracker. But would any responsible (or even semi-responsible) parent let a character like Buck get within a hundred feet of her son?  The utter lack of verisimilitude in these characters' behavior makes it impossible for any semi-critical person to suspend his/her disbelief.  The movie rambles through several subplots until Buck winds up blackmailing Chuck into one, final, sexual encounter.  The saving grace of this scene is that the viewer knows that the film must be finally nearing an end.
There are those who call this type of film deep and relevant.  Frankly, I can find more depth and relevance in an episode of Star Trek.  ",992131200,7,2275,4.81025641025641
1387374,2,B000051S5M,"Undoubtedly effective in summoning forth feelings of uneasiness, but by the end, I was thoroughly confused by the artifices in the film and what they're supposed to signify.  Films do not necessarily have to be about anything but ""Chuck & Buck"" seems to desperately want to be about something.  The whole film, with its numerous contrivances, appears to be set up as a parable.  Even the contrivance of the story within the story, ""Hank and Frank"", seems to be a purposeful allegory of some sort.  It is apparent that ""Chuck & Buck"", by contrasting ""normal"" Charlie's self-denial of his sexuality with ""abnormal"" Buck's ingenuous naturalness to his, is ostensibly commenting on how social propriety can bury one's sexual nature.  On the other hand, it is also apparent that ""Hank and Frank"" is a manifestation of Buck's indictment of Charlie for his ""crippled"" development, as brought about by Chuck's sexual exploitation of Buck.  Maybe it's me but these two points do not jibe with me -- is it Chuck or Buck who's ""crippled"" anyway?  And then there's the climactic scene between the two eponymous characters in Buck's apartment.  I don't know but it didn't look to me like Charlie is trying very hard to bury his sexuality, nor is Buck equally diligent at preventing himself from being exploited again.  It also didn't help that Chris Weitz, who played Charlie, is as poker-faced as Lorenzo Lamas.  The muddy digital-video camera work isn't anything to write home about either.  Lupe Ontiveros, who played the stage director, however, is terrific.",991353600,,1549,5.01171875

1387376,3,B000051S5M,"One thing I expect a movie to do is move me in one way or another. What I mean is, even semi-skillful movies make you feel *something.* What a movie makes the viewer feel is directly related to the movie's vision -- its humanity and its perspective on ""the human condition."" Sometimes a movie gives the feeling that its ""auteurs"" don't really have such a perspective, or worse, that if there is one, it's not entirely worked out so that, ultimately, what's left is little more than empty cynicism.
I'm not sure how the makers of *Chuck & Buck* feel about our common lot, but quite frankly, this movie gave me the creeps. That's not necessarily a bad thing. It's just a thing you should know before buying it: this movie is not entertaining. It doesn't mean to be, I suspect. It means, I think, to uncover something very unflattering and sad about us, our unwillingness to let go of the dreams (obsessions) that fail us.
Leonard Maltin almost never tells you that there is gay subject matter in a movie, so if you don't already know that, there is.  Unfortunately, add this to the long list of movies whose sole view of homosexuality is that it is ""defective"" and creepy. This is doubly unfortunate in a movie with such liberal pretensions as this one has.  I'm sure that the film-makers would answer that obsession, not homosexuality, is the the focus here.  But that begs the question, because the plot of this movie turns on the emotional distress that a straight man feels who is the object of homosexual obsession.
Another thing Leonard Maltin doesn't tell you is that, while this movie tries very hard to be a good movie in a very typically independent and low-budget kind of way, it doesn't quite rise to the occasion. I'm not sorry I saw it, but I don't think that, in the end, this movie is wise enough to reach its moral destination. The denoument, for example, doesn't ring true (I'm talking about the ""deal"" that Chuck & Buck finally make in hopes of resolving their common problem). The reason for that is unclear, but I think it has to do with the movie's self-conscious ambivalence toward it's characters.
Human beings are complicated, and this movie certainly knows that. I liked the film's willingness to be absolutely frank about something that is embarassing precisely because it is so recognizable. I suspect most people have felt the unique humiliation of unrequited infatuation (not love), and the terrible confusion that attends it. What most people don't do is act it out to the extent that Buck does in this movie. And if they do, they generally end up in jail, not eating cake. But, okay, I might have been willing to let that pass.
I also very much liked the subtle way that ""Chuck"" (Charlie) initially reacts -- avoidance -- to a situation that he clearly did not ask for, (though Buck seems to believe that he did). Charlie clearly thinks of himself as, essentially, a ""nice"" guy. He's got a nice job, a fiance, he takes his morning run. He's handsome, oddly sexy. Chuck has convinced himself that life can be normal and relatively bump-free.)
What I didn't like, and didn't believe, was what eventually happens. It strained credibility, but more than that, in its compromise, the movie seemed to have lost its way. The inevitable didn't happen: Buck doesn't wind up in a jail or an asylum.  In movies, that's always a bad thing because it reveals a disturbing distance between a film's makers and their subject.
IMHO, movie-makers have to be more responsible than these movie-makers are to some discernable world-view because movies, more than any other art-form in the 20th century, have carved out for themselves, a claim of moral authority.  Whether we like it or not, movies, especially movies that give off an aura of having ""something to say,"" tend inevitably to teach us something about what is wrong and what is right with human beings.  In other words, a movie with ""something to say"" ought to say something, not just seek to make its audience unaccountably uncomfortable.  When a movie fails or stumbles in this regard, it is a moral failure because movies affect us so directly and personally.
I didn't know what to make of Buck *or* Chuck at the end of this movie, and I'm not convinced that the filmakers did either. Still, see it if you can stand it. Think how you'd do it differently.",989712000,8,4328,4.686842105263158
1387388,3,B000051S5M,"I have to agree this movie is not for everyone.  So many times a movie is improperly labeled as a comedy or a drama, when in fact it happens to be a hybrid, a tragedy-comedy of sorts.  This is the case of Cable Guy, Jack, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, Raising Arizona, and so many others that escape my brain.
This is a sad movie with a hopeful ending.  There are two main morals to the story:
*Be careful what you do in life, because sooner or later the chickens come home to roost *The corny ""behind each cloud there is a silver lining""
Paul Weitz (the bad actor), Lupe Ontiveros (Beverly, the theater's house manager) and Paul White (Buck) all have stellar performances.  The only complaint i have is that Buck sometimes comes up with statements that are incongruous for someone of his mental age.",987984000,,808,4.476190476190476

1387390,4,B000051S5M,"I can understand why a lot of people don't like this movie. It's a very black comedy, often hard to laugh at for some and hard to swallow. But if you have an open mind and like movies that are daring in subject matter and offbeat, then CHUCK & BUCK is a good one.  Chuck and Buck were boyhood friends.  Chuck grew up and Buck remained at the emotional level of a care-free momma's boy. But when Buck's mom dies, he goes in search of his old friend.
The strongest part of this movie is Mike White's flawless (and overlooked by the Academy) performance as Buck. Fully in character, his Buck is creepy, freaky, and downright hysterical. His inabiltiy to fit in and act like a clear-headed adult and his need to reconnect with Buck by reminiscing is jawdropping. Clearly mentally disturbed Buck eventually becomes Chuck's stalker.
The only flaw in the movie -- besides a sometime wooden cast of extras -- is that it's hard to believe that Chuck wouldn't just fully tell Buck off or explain how messed up he is to his (Chuck's) girlfriend.
All in all, CHUCK & BUCK is a surprising hit that -- if you watch it in the dark -- will have you looking over your shoulder.",983923200,3,1160,4.41588785046729

When you start watching this movie, first thing that you notice is the bad acting...if you can get over that irritation, then you are left with watching a Gay character portrayed as a perversed peeping tom & a relentless stalker. If it isn't for the way the movie ends, GLAAD should step-in and get this movie banned!
 Romance - well, you'll have to wait till the end of the movie, by then you'd be so irritated by all the stiff faces & the lack of any feeling in the movie, you'll never get to see any chemistry between the two intended romantics.

Not much more than ""Chuck and Buck"" could have been a nifty idea but ended up being the kind of catastrophic disaster that often characterizes what is mistakenly labeled as ""avante guarde"". Buck's character is largely unbelievable, as is the plot, although there are a few redeeming scenes (which is why ""C&B"" gets two stars and not one). It would have been nice to see a more emotionally and mentally stable or truly innocent Buck -- as he is, Buck is nothing short of a creepy stalker. Chuck's character is also lacking -- I would have liked to see something other than a purely success driven Chuck attempting to hide the details of an embarassing past or a Chuck that is more firm about confronting Buck.

1387393,3,B000051S5M,"What do you get when you have a guy who wrote a script for an Adam Sandler movie? What do you get when you have the brothers who directed ""American Pie""? What you have is a disturbing piece of art that makes stalking look like an innocent thing. Screenwriter Mike White, who wrote the Sandler movie (Note: The script was considered too ""childish""!), wrote this truly bizarre film that doesn't feature CGI, big name stars, or perfect sound. What it does feature, is an insight into the world of someone who never grew up beyond ten and still dabbles in his childhood-like life by hanging up collages of pictures of he and his friends (Collages that you made when you were in kindergarten) and leaves his toys scattered about the room. White plays Buck, a child trapped in a man's body who's just lost his mother, and feels the need to reconnect to Chuck, engaged to a good woman and now an up and coming music executive on the fast track and living in Los Angeles. Buck wants to rekindle those old days he had as kids with Buck including some games of perversion, something Chuck is very intent on forgetting. Disturbing, relentless, and ultra-tragic, ""Chuck & Buck"" is a film that will screw with your head and will affect you in a way that many films don't. White's Buck is a true original that goes on par with other such movie characters as Peter Sellers in ""Being There"" by not showcasing Buck, but portraying him as an innocent who can't grow up. The performances are particularly good with Mike White showcasing his talents as an actor, his performance infers that he understood the script as he plays a truly disturbing character. Chris Weitz provides a great performance as Chuck, just a man who wants to live his life and work on his job. His brother Paul Weitz also has a supporting role as a rough edged, lousy actor that befriends Buck. If you're taste in films revolves around ""The Rock"" and ""Jurassic Park"", I guarantee you you're not going to like this movie, but if you're an arthouse film buff, you'll like it.",982800000,8,2027,4.571428571428571

There is an awkwardness and insecurity to Buck that was a veritable staple of the television show.  ""Chuck and Buck"" goes a step further in that the awkwardness is relentless.  You cringe as Buck (seemingly impossibly) outdoes himself each time he fails to read the social cues of those around him.  His childhood friend, Chuck (who now goes by Charlie), is initially confused, then visibly frightened by Buck's adoration. What unfolds is amazing.  The informal, almost documentary-like feel to the film is probably enhanced by the fact that the actors (with few exceptions) aren't really actors at all, but writers, producers, and directors.
