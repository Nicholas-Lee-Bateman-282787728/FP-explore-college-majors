3173141,2,B0017KP8XQ,To see the ill-treatment and the abuse that this beautiful horse suffered was not what I would call entertaining.  It upset me greatly to watch the horrors it has to go through for filming.  I was very disappointed as I love horses.,1388880000,,232,4.5
3173142,5,B0017KP8XQ,I loved this movie and watch it over and over .l will  keep for my collection. .I  have the other series.,1384819200,,105,3.9523809523809526
3173143,5,B0017KP8XQ,"We adore this TV series from the early 1990's!! Our daughters love the Black and both want to grow up to be Alec when they are older. By that I mean they want to take care of horses and ride them. This series has serious subjects, but w/o the swearing and naked people of today's shows. I trust this to be on when I'm not in the room and NOT see a naked boob or hear a swear word. The show teaches values w/o gratuitous sex or violence.",1377129600,,436,3.965909090909091

3173145,5,B0017KP8XQ,"Defiantly have all the seasons, the cast change is a bit annoying to get used to the different ppl playing the same characters, but it's still one of our favorites.",1363392000,,164,4.5
3173146,4,B0017KP8XQ,I loved this series! I wish they had made more. The only problem I had was with the third season. The box was all cardboard. You have to slide the discs in and out like you do with audio books. The sliding gives the discs scratches.,1356652800,,232,4.065217391304348
3173147,4,B0017KP8XQ,"We enjoy watching this series about the black stallion. It stars Mickey Rooney who, years ago, as a young actor was the guiding trainer for a young girl jockey in the movie National Velvet.
Micky Rooney brings his acting experience and natural grumbly older trainer image to the small screen, now guiding young Alex Ramsey to ride and train the famous Black Stallion to make racetrack history.
It is not all only about each race, but of travels to different countries and the beautiful old estates they find to stable and train the beautiful Black from.
The cast includes a young lady -who also aspires to be a racetrack jockey- her mom and veterinarian dad, all Alex's friends and sometimes partners in adventures, .
Fun for all ages, I'd think.",1345161600,,746,4.746153846153846
3173148,4,B0017KP8XQ,"We very much enjoy the adventures of the black stallion. But for one reason or an other we ended up with a duplication of one of the seasons and returned it recently. As soon as the credit has been received
for this item we'll search for a replacement. In the mean time keep up the good work and keep those wonderful horse movies in your inventory.

3173149,5,B0017KP8XQ,"I have watched season one, two and three and I really liked them.  Prior to viewing this series I viewed the original movie and the return movie and I liked them to but the series is more than some half naked boy running around an Island getting to know a horse.  The series shows the relationship that was formed on the Island with a much older boy winning pretty much every race.  Unlike some I think the part of the trainer was cast well.  The boy is now old enough to be distracted by the opposite sex.  The show only ran three seasons however it's a good show.  Not the same actor playing the boy nor will he be running around an Island shirtless or barefoot.  It is a good family show.",1329091200,,691,4.1893939393939394
3173150,5,B0017KP8XQ,The black stallion has its third and final season here! Alec and the Black are such good friends. Their trainer Henry Daily is proud of them for all of their acccomplishments on or off track. Anyone who loves races or horses or both should defniately have this added to thier home video libraries. They may never know what they are missing! Hooray for the complete third season of The Adventures of the Black Stallion!,1297555200,,418,4.662162162162162
3173151,4,B0017KP8XQ,"I bought this for my Daugter and she enjoyed it very much.  I'm not sure how much repeat watching she'll do as she becomes an adult, but it this whole series has seen a fair amount of play on long trips in the back of our van.  My boys enjoyed it as well as did I.  Granted it is a little corny sometimes and some of the stories are a little far fethched, but it was good entertainment and offered some very good life lessons for kids and young adults.",1294790400,,452,4.0
3173152,5,B0017KP8XQ,"I had searched everywhere trying to find this third season.  Amazon.com had it.  The third season I feel was the best.  My family and I enjoyed watching it and we were all sad when we watch the last part.  We have horses so watching this made us want to go out and ride.  Which we did.  I recommend the Adventures of the Black Stallion.  It is a good family movie.

3173155,5,B0017KP8XQ,"As a youngster I avidly read all of the Black Stallion books. I pictured in my mind the magnificent stallion who lived to race. I also made in my mind a picture of Alex Ramsey, a male counterpart of myself in his love for horses. At the age of 64, I fondly look back on my life with horses, many of whom I helped deliver as foals on our ranch. Watching the Adventures of the Black Stallion brought many bitter/sweet thoughts. I wish there were many more seasons I could purchase and view. Such a clean, American type video I couldn't ask for more. May God bless those who have the heart to make such wonderful DVD's. Please do some more....if possible.

Thanks again, Mary Main.....horse lover.",1223942400,4,694,4.464566929133858
