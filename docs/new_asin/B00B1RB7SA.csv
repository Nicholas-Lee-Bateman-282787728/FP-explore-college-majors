8561018,5,B00B1RB7SA,At long last a double of two of Elliott's westerns for AA/Monogram. Fargo is one of Elliott's best for Monogram with The Homesteaders has a western plot similar to the French classic Wages of Fear. As long as Warners continue to release these films I will continue to buy them. Excellent in every department.,1388188800,10,308,4.722222222222222
8561019,5,B00B1RB7SA,I was always a fan of Wild Bill Elliott.  He always made great movies and i thoroughly enjoyed this two movie DVD.  They (WB) should treat these movies like they did with other Monogram packages that were produced.  We need more of his movies in this series.,1383868800,7,258,4.446808510638298
8561020,3,B00B1RB7SA,"I'll start off by saying I love old westerns ....but these two are very short on action,which was a must with older fans. The prints are terrific,clear as one would hope....I can see now why this series of  Bill Elliott westerns were terminated by Monogram and he played a modern day detective.
I long for Wild Bill's days at Republic Studios.",1376870400,8,343,4.622950819672131
8561021,5,B00B1RB7SA,"To a ten year old city kid watching the ""cowboy shows' for ten cents on Saturday afternoons here was the consummate ""good guy"" who was a ""peaceable man"" until pressed.  He did not wear fancy clothes, did not sing or play an instrument.  Always polite to the poor woman whose father (Dear Old Dad) was being swindled or murdered by the 'bad guy' to get his property but never more than a handshake.",1373760000,5,397,4.424657534246576
