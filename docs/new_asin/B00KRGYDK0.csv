6444631,5,B00KRGYDK0,"I saw this Documentary at its premier film festival. It was extremely well done. The visuals from the most recent world's fairs were beautiful, as were the shots pulled from the archives. What was interesting about the film, itself, aside from the premise, was that the filmmakers shot it primarily of FILM. Which, in this day and age, is a rarity.",1408492800,4,348,4.721311475409836
8661050,4,B00KRGYDK0,"This documentary by Jeffrey Ford and Brad Bear answers my question about what had happened to the World's Fair?  Turns out it's still around, but the US hasn't hosted one since 1984 when it was held in  New Orleans.

Previous World's Fairs held in the US have resulted in positive economic returns.  Spokane's downtown has been rebuilt and resulted in Riverfront park, a popular meeting area for families, friends and tourists.  Minneapolis is also interested in hosting a future fair.  So why is it so hard to get the funding?

Ford and Bear did their research.  They interviewed former State Department workers from various departments who had been involved in prior fairs.  Turns out the HR3427 of 1992 limits tax payer's money on the construction of a US pavilion for a World's Fair.  They also got 29 documents from the State Department that dealt with the World's Fair, but only four of them were totally unclassified.  Fourteen had most of the information redacted.  So why the secrecy?  I can only assume the State Department felt participating in the fair endangered American science and technology and research and development vulnerabilities to international espionage.

And would hosting a fair now only make us more vulnerable to terrorism?

The closing statement, that the US is indifferent to the World's Fair. Have we have stopped trying because we believe no one wants to hear our story, or is it because we believe we no longer have a story to tell?",1524528000,,1467,4.90650406504065
8661051,5,B00KRGYDK0,"This is a sobering but eye opening account of America's sketchy involvement in the global World's Fair events. Countries we are heavily invested in and do intense buisiness with, such as China, are put off by our lack of involvement in these fairs, in which countries around the world proudly show off their national identity and future place in a global economy. It's a toss up as to which is worse: that we so often sit them out completely, or when we do commit to having a pavillion at one, produce little more than a short promotional video and a wall of corporate sponsor logos, along with  a gift shop. LOL It's just sad and pathetic.

The Chinese actually look at our flacid involvment as a symbol of  America in decline as a super power. After watching the endless wrangling of our goverment's  involvement, much of which is shrouded in a mysterious secrecy, it's hard to think they are wrong. An excellent documentary that all Americans should watch, just to know what is going on with other nations perception of us.",1503878400,,1026,4.651933701657459

This is what happens when Commercialism destroys a Country's soul.
What a shame we are turning our backs on the world again, everyone who values Americas place in the world should watch this film !",1503532800,2,258,4.51063829787234

8661054,1,B00KRGYDK0,"I have not see this film yet.  I am fond of documentaries.  What struck me while reading the description of this film was the use of ""sorted past"".  I imagine that it must be the tired phrase ""sordid past"" that was intended.  But perhaps I am wrong and the film intends to demonstrate the different sorts of county fairs.  Your kind attention will be most appreciated.",1494288000,,368,4.515151515151516

8661058,5,B00KRGYDK0,"A great documentary that a couple of guys I know put together.  They won various awards for a documentary that makes you hate America.  It's sickening how little our government respects this country.  With that being said, I didn't even know that other countries had World's Fairs.  I always assumed they shut down when our did.  And I also didn't know that there were smaller fairs throughout the country.  I had only heard of the World's Fair like they showed in Captain America: The First Avenger.  Jeff and Brad did a great job with the film and it's completely worth watching.  It's very educational and entertaining.  A+",1422748800,4,626,4.775700934579439
8661059,5,B00KRGYDK0,"Very interesting documentary on the history and importance of the World's Fair and what has happened to US participation. I saw this film at the Knoxville Film Festival, where it won first place in feature documentaries. Beautiful footage from past fairs.",1408492800,4,255,5.2439024390243905
