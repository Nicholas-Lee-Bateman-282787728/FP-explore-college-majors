1689018,5,B0000639GA,"The 'Cuban Story' (1959) hosted by movie great Errol Flynn, is a surprisingly, well-made, fascinating documentary on Fidel Castro's revolution in Cuba.  Do not confuse this handsome, professional production with Errol Flynn's swan song, 'Cuban Rebel Girls' also made in 1959, which was a complete bomb.  Picture and sound quality range from good to excellant and are generally first-rate.
 Flynn appears as our host but the film is narrated by producer and Havana theater owner Victor Pahlen.  There is no wasted footage or padding in this feature's tight 50 minute running time.
  The 'Cuban Story' documents the fall of the brutal, corrupt dictator Battista, and the rise of the charismatic Fidel Castro. It ends in early 1959, when both the Cuban people and the world believed that Castro would restore democracy to Cuba.  After 43 years in 2002, Cuba still has had no free elections and Castro rules Cuba much the same as Battista.
 Since the 'Cuban Story' is truly a Valentine to Fidel Castro, the film became a political 'hot potato' during the 'Cold War'.  It went unseen except for a Moscow film festival, and was hidden in the vaults at Pinewood studios in Britain.
  At the end of 'Cuban Story' Errol Flynn reads a telegram he receives from Fidel Castro welcoming the American audiences to visit 'Cuba, the land of freedom and liberty.'  Flynn says 'You know I believe that, and so should you. Goodnight.'  Errol Flynn was charmed, seduced and duped by Fidel Castro.  Just remember in May 2002, Castro did it again when he wined, dined and snowed former president Jimmy Carter!",1021852800,9,1587,4.917293233082707
7958915,5,B0000639GA,"Prepare yourself for what is surely one of the most poorly-made documentaries of all time - and quite astonishly bad considering it was made by people who had spent their lives making millions in the movie business. It fails in its script, camera-work, sound (truly awful!), sound and video editing, presentation - you name it, it's bad.

BUT!!! Set all of that aside and watch this must-see documentary for the fascinating piece of history that it is. It is a unique and previously unseen record of the Cuban revolution with the truly quirky aspect of being pro-Castro, the simple result of being made at such an early stage in the revolution that the governments of the USA and other western democracies were still in favour of the overthrow of the corrupt Battista regime .. all before Castro's Soviet links became apparent.",1160611200,6,827,4.865248226950355
7958916,4,B0000639GA,"If you're thinking about buying this because of Errol, forget it. He only appears briefly, and indeed he is not the narrator.  Also, if you love him, you might find it painful to see him in his later days of poor health.  No, the real reason to buy this is because it has some unique footage of the Revolution and expresses a point of view you seldom encounter in media of the time. It was interesting because of that and worthwhile in its obviously subjective-historic narrative.",1143072000,6,480,4.569767441860465
7958917,5,B0000639GA,"This film would mostly of interest to Fans of Errol Flynn. Flynn later changed his mind about Castro but at the time of this film was one of those enamored of the revolutionary and his promise for Cuba after the excesses of the Batista regime. There is some interesting footage of the events and of Havana nightlife. However the film is really a strange mix and somewhat naive about Castro. The liner notes are despicable in their attack on Flynn, simply rehashing charges brought forth in Charles Higham's highly fictional biography. They also seem to be written by someone who has not the slightest real knowledge of the film or it's participants. For instance the writer mentions that Flynn's then girlfriend is ""conspicuously absent"" from the film. If the writer (also the producer of the dvd) had any knowledge of Flynn's girlfriend Beverly Aadland he would recognize her in one sequence arriving at a casino with Flynn and then standing with him at a gaming table. Also the narration of Cuban Story is once again mistaken. The writer states it is of a ""more sober Flynn"". Anyone who has seen an Errol Flynn film knows that the voice of the narrator is not the voice of Flynn. It is a lame attempt carried forth with a phony British accent. Most likely because Flynn wasn't around to be involved in the narration. The writer mentions the background of the film as being shrouded in mystery with ""little more than supposition and speculation on which to go."" Remember that phrase when reading the notes. As piece of film work it is odd but certainly interesting all things considered.",1130976000,8,1588,4.757246376811594
7958918,2,B0000639GA,"THERE ARE ONLY 2 REASONS TO BUY THIS,FIRST IF YOU WANT TO SEE A FEW BRIEF GLIMPSES OF ERROL IN HIS LATE YEARS,SECOND THERE IS  SOME GOOD NEWSREEL FOOTAGE,IT'S PLODDING AND UNFORTUNATELY IN HINDSIGHT WRONG IN ITS THOUGHTS ON FIDEL,FURTHERMORE THE NARRATION IS DEFINITELY NOT ERROL'S VOICE",1124409600,3,287,5.1063829787234045
7958919,4,B0000639GA,". . . It gets four stars.

This film is a look at the Cuban Revolution through the eyes of an American film-maker. The Revolution at the time of this film's creation was evidently still young. It had yet to come into conflict with the United States, and it had not yet embraced the Marxist-Leninist path to revolution. This, in-itself, is a very unique attribute of the film; you will not see this in subsequent films about Cuba. For this reason, it probably better than any other film, represents the zeitgeist of those idealistic, early days.

In the film, we get a rudimentary overview of the Revolutionary War. It is unique in that we see emphasized the role that Urban Resistance played in toppling Batista's regime. Through the eyes of history, the role of the Urban Resistance is continually downplayed, and the mystique and romanticism of the guerilla army is touted as the sole cause of Batista's fall. Although brief in its mention, it lends a balance to the history of the Revolutionary War that one is not likely to get outside of books.

The remainder of the film focuses on the triumph of the Revolution. We see a good deal about the atrocities of Batista- torture, extrajudicial killings, bombing of civilians, police repression of street demonstrations, etc. We also see how the Revolution plans to change this: carrying out trials of Batista loyalists, building schools in place of police stations used for torture, exhuming and properly burying the bodies of those murdered by Batista, etc.

The film has sound problems. There are times when the narrator becomes unintelligible as his voice melds with background noises. I am sure this can be chalked up to the film sitting in a vault somewhere for 40+ years.

The film, sadly, features very 'live' sound. All of the shots of Castro giving speeches, or people being tried for crimes, are silent pictures. The only sounds we hear are the narrator's voice, background music he added, and the occasional sound of a car passing, a plane's propellors, or something to that effect.

I also wonder how much this film would interest somebody with little knowledge of or interest in Cuba and the Revolution.

Overall, this film is very interesting for what it is, a look into the Spirit of a Revolution untouched by outside influences. Whatever one's politics are, and wherever one stands on Cuba, I would recommend this film as something to give insight to the spirit at the heart of the Cuban Revolutionary War.",1123372800,8,2472,4.843601895734597
7958920,3,B0000639GA,"Film is the late Errol Flynn's love poem to Castro and the Cuban Revolution.  DVD could have been better if it included Cuban Rebel Girls.  Mostly, Flynn embarrasses himself by once again playing journalist, something he had done before with mixed results.  Much the footage is fascinating to see even with the pro-Castro love poem.  The liner notes seem to rely on Charles Higham's discredited biography but does make George Raft more of a hero than the reprobate Flynn, who just looks god awful for a man of 50.  Flynn died soon after his misadventures in Castro land.",1114128000,6,570,4.775510204081633
7958921,5,B0000639GA,"The expression ""Better late than never"" is a truism about the discovery of forgotten films.  But in the case of the discovery of ""Cuban Story"" one could defensibly assert ""Better later than sooner.""

Errol Flynn had been a frequent visitor to Cuba during the last years of the Batista regime, his primary interest being Cuba's then notorious nightlife.  Flynn acknowledges as much in the film and even provides us with samples of scenes from casinos. But he also provides us with scenes from the ""other Cuba,"" the Cuba that was the experience of most Cubans at the time: the Cuba of extreme hardship, poverty, illiteracy, and rampant worker exploitation.  All these scenes are fittingly coupled with scenes of Batista military reviews and parades.

But Castro, the revolutionary challenging the regime in the mountains, captures Flynn's imagination and he travels at some personal risk to meet Castro and to film him.  It is at this point that Cuba becomes for Flynn more than an opportunity for wild nights in Havana.  It becomes the story of the struggle for justice and Castro becomes its quintessential expression.  From there the film records the early victories of the revolutionaries in Cuba and their eventual triumphal march into Havana after Batista's abdication.

Of course, that Cuba story is well known and much discussed.  Yet Flynn provides us with information that is not nearly as well known--in some cases nearly forgotten--which makes the discovery of Flynn's film now arguably better than if it had been discovered sooner.  Flynn's film offers some information that corrects some of the disinformation we have heard about the revolution for years:

1.  Contrary to the revisionist claim that the Cuban people didn't consider Batista a tyrant at the time of the revolution, Flynn shows us the wounds of Batista's torture victims and the bones of some of the murdered 40,000 discovered in unmarked graves.

2.  Although we often we read of the exodus of Cuban elites and Batista human rights abusers after the revolution, we have heard next to nothing about the numerous Cubans returned from exile to Cuba after Batista had been deposed.  Flynn shows them to us disembarking from planes.

3.  Flynn attended and recorded many of the notorious trials of the former Batista regime criminals.  The trials come off less unsavory than as they have been depicted in the past.  The trials were open to the public and the international press, they were broadcast on television, the defendants were afforded free defense attorneys, and defendants could appeal decisions based on the discovery of new evidence.

But these are not the only gems this movie affords.  Others include footage never seen before of the early days of the revolution, making the film definitely worth the purchase.",1092700800,32,2797,5.074398249452954
7958922,3,B0000639GA,"By the late 50s, a clean-shaven Fidel Castro was considered a hero by most Americans when he challenged the corrupt Batista regime. And the once dashing and beautiful (there's no other word) Errol Flynn was a burned out, drug-addled alcoholic has-been actor who was in Cuba with his 15 year old girlfriend Beverly Aadland making a grade Z flick called ""Cuban Rebel Girls.""
Flynn ingratiated himself with Castro to get needed help to complete his guerilla girl flick.  Somewhere along the way, Havana theater owner Victor Phalen and Flynn made ""Cuban Story.""
It appears there's shared footage and music between the two films. Flynn, with mustache, introduces the documentary and later is seen, without mustache but with Aadland -- arriving at George Raft's Havana nightclub in a white, big-finned Caddy.
Phalen narrates the reasonably tight 50 minute film that purports to document the revolution and charismatic Castro's promise of a return to democracy.  But whoa, 43 years later Castro still rules -- much like Batista -- and there's yet a free election.
Near the end of of the movie, Flynn reads a telegram from Castro welcoming Americans to visit Cuba, the land of ""freedom and liberty.""
This odd, pro Castro film was supposedly kept in a British vault for the last 40 odd years.  The suspect liner notes seem to reflect biographer Charles Higham's false view that Flynn was a traitor.
But in time's clear eyed rear view, this bizarre film is a highly entertaining new genre -- cinema irony.  Off-beat and weirdly meaningful.",1026950400,17,1529,5.0078740157480315
7958923,4,B0000639GA,"I would give it four stars. It is an odd, but fascinating look at the Cuban revolution, and, I think, accurately reflects the attitudes of the time in regards to Castro, before he aligned himself with the Soviet Union. It was made at about the same time as Flynn's notoriously bad ""Cuban Rebel Girls, and I would say that it is kind of a sister film to that picture. It is a fairly serious documentary about the revolution, whereas ""Rebel Girls"" is a silly sort of docudrama (with an emphasis on ""silly""). When I finished watching ""Cuban Story,"" I watched ""Cuban Rebel Girls"" again, for comparison. They have some things in common. I have a feeling they may have shared documentary footage for both films, and some of the music is the same- particularly a rebel marching song that is played extensively in both films. Flynn has more to do in ""Rebel Girls""- in ""Cuban Story,"" he merely introduces the film, and then appears again in the middle (following two still photos of him with Castro), and then at the end, when he makes the comments the former reviewer alluded to. He can also be seen in footage near the beginning, when he arrives at George Raft's nightclub in Havana. He pulls up in a late '50s White Cadillac- one of the bathtub jobs with the tail fins, and then enters the club, along with Beverly Aadland, his teenage flame, and some others. He is quite frisky in these scenes, and seemingly charms a couple of young women he meets in the club. They play roulette and blackjack, and watch a show. Interestingly, Flynn appears sans mustache in these nightclub scenes (though not in the intro), and looks somewhat younger than usual for this period. For Flynn fans, these scenes are well worth seeing. They are kind of depressing, though, as he mostly looks like hell, and seems to have trouble focusing on the subject at hand, appearing to lose his train of thought at times. The office set used in the intro is pretty cheesy, and it looks like his scenes were filmed in an hour or two.

  I would say that for students of history, and for Flynn fans, the film is well worth seeing. It has its quirks, but contains footage of Cuba, Castro and the revolution that are unique. The narration is apparently by Victor Pahlen, but is occasionally written to imply that it is Flynn who is speaking, as when he refers to ""my colleague George Raft."" It is a better film than ""Cuban Rebel Girls,"" and makes an interesting comparison with it. My only gripe is with the liner notes. I would give them 0 stars. Whoever wrote them obviously used Charles Higham's terrible book about Flynn as source material, and repeats Higham's untrue, and illogical, assertions about Flynn. That he was a lifelong fascist; that at one point he was part of a plot to assassinate Castro; that the film crew had to flee Cuba in fear for their lives; that Flynn abandoned his girlfriend, Beverly, and that she had to ask Raft for help to get out. These are outrageous fabrications, and detract from what is otherwise an interesting film. But forget the notes, and buy the DVD. It is an amazing thing to find after all these years.",1022371200,32,3109,4.578096947935368
