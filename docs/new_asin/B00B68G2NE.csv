8563214,4,B00B68G2NE,"This is a timely and interesting movie, unlike any other I have ever seen because it shows two people on opposite sides of the world undergoing the same situation with almost exactly the same dialogue. The similarities in dialogue, from a male examiner/female suspect and a female examiner/male suspect give a eerie, if not bizarre quality to the film.  The genius in the film is we as Americans tend to root for the American authority examining the male Arab (who we assume is a terrorist), but are not so sure when the same words and treatment are applied to the attractive, young female American (obviously innocent) interrogated and inspected by the Red Chinese agent.  The American interrogator is played by Glenn Close, while I believe the Chinese official is from the cast of ""Lost.""  Neither interrogator seems to get any satisfaction from their work. All characters are excellent.  Despite the title, in keeping with the PG-13 rating, much of the ""strip search"" is threatened or implied and shots of exposed breasts are with inadequate lighting. The whole point of the movie is to raise the all important question of how much individual freedom are we willing to give up to keep us safe from terrorism.",1435449600,,1211,4.892682926829268

theories about our government.",1395878400,,158,5.115384615384615
8563219,5,B00B68G2NE,"I thought that this film was shocking, but had a good storyline, it gave food for thought.
The fact that terrorism can make people at customs and the police more vigilant, to the extent that can violate people's freedom and rights as a consequence.
Such practices do go on in the states and in other foreign countries including in the UK, perhaps not done so graphically but it is still scary for the people who have to go through the ordeal, not knowing what there rights are.
I would recommend this film.",1391731200,3,506,4.510869565217392
