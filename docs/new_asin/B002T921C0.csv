3984198,2,B002T921C0,"The lead female character played her role very well, but the story itself and the drama it entailed were not strong enough to maintain one's interest at a high level for nearly 2-hours.  In fact, the ""new immigrant tale"" is a universal one that has been told many times before, and I found nothing really new here.  The only interesting aspect was the Middle Eastern political context--which was not presented in any real depth. Although this DVD could well have some appeal to those with an interest in Arab-American culture and language, I don't believe it will attract a wider viewing public.",1272931200,9,595,4.823529411764706
3984199,5,B002T921C0,"A subtle, sensitive and sometimes humourous look at a range of relationships and issues around migration, racism, gender and generation... This is a well acted piece that flows through the story of a woman and her son migrating from Palestine to the US... just in time for the outbreak of war in Iraq and the ensuing racist response.
Coming from Australia, I recognised much of the story in the stories of migrants and refugees I have known who have tried hard to resettle in a new country... the obstacles are countless, for young and old, but determination and love makes it possible.
I sought this video out because I had seen the film at a festival and I want to encourage others to watch it!",1270684800,4,696,4.576
3984200,4,B002T921C0,"Amreeka is a charming film about the modern Arab immigrant experience.  Built around a cast of well imagined and sensitively portrayed characters and set in the initial days of the US invasion of Iraq, it follows a Palestinian mother and her teenage son as they learn to sort through the problems typical of many immigrants - loss of a support network, dependence on locals or established immigrants,  the inability to transfer qualifications and skills, and indifference or even hostility from members of the host culture.  The experience is exacerbated in Amreeka by the ethnic chauvinism fomented and unleashed in the run-up to the Bush-Cheney invasion - a threatening note left in a mailbox, canceled contracts, disappearing customers, as well as verbal and physical intimidation. Bitter as that experience was, and as tempting as it may have been to lecture, the director never falls into polemicizing but stays focused on the characters.  One of the mother's unexpected sources of friendship and help in navigating her new world is a Polish Jew.  Practically speaking a one-woman production from writer-director Cherien Dabis,  Amreeka is a lovely film that falls flat only in the end.  It seems the story does not so much reach a conclusion as it does to simply end, leaving you with the impression there may have been more to tell.",1267488000,9,1339,5.0590909090909095
3984201,5,B002T921C0,"I think it probably was an excellent film, but my gripe about it is the lack of captions. If you're looking for a film about the immigrant experience and you have no trouble hearing, this one is very worth while.  However, if  you're dependent on closed captions or English subtitles, forget it.

Yes, when the film starts out there are English subtitles, but as one finds out later, that's because the characters are speaking Arabic. Once Englilsh is spoken, good bye subtitles.

You may wonder about the five-star designation. With the sum of some subtitles and the body-language it appeared to be heading that way.  Great ending.",1266710400,,632,4.869158878504673

3984205,2,B002T921C0,"Reason only 1 out 16 people say my review was helpful is because the other 15 are probably Arabs, Muslims, Palestinians, leftists, and/or ""politically correct"" western world apologizers to Islam. (In a recent poll, 58% of all Americans believe Muslims are victimized - which sadly denotes that the American public, lacking  deep knowledge of the history of Islam and Middle East conflict, are living in total denial unaware to the rising danger radical Islam is posing to their democratic American way of life). I am exceedingly proud of my review and stand by it 100% because it's based on truth, having been to the Middle East many times in my capacity as a journalist, having studied the history of the Israeli-Palestinian-Arab conflict in depth on the ground in the region, and having read two translations of the Qur'an.

Regarding the film Amereeka: Well written and technically well directed, this is the most cleverly cunning, and insidious Arab financed Palestinian propaganda movie ever: on its surface it deceptively proports to be a movie about the struggles of a nice, loving, ""secular"" middle-class ordinary Palestinian-American family facing the same economic, marital, sibbling conflicts and they even have a weed smoking teen that's just like any other middle-class American family, only now they welcome a sister who immigrated from the occupied West Bank and must deal with her and her son's adjustment to their new life. But below this gentile benevolent appearance hides a monster, tool to spew hatred towards the US and Israel. Arabs & Palestinians have discovered the power of film as a strong communication tool to manipulate Americans unfamiliar with Middle East history and politics - other than being fed by CNN, with films such as Paradise Now (glorifying suicide bombers), Under The Bombs (one-sided condemnation of Israeli ""agression"" in Lebanon), and they're using this tool with great and impressive professional efficiency, complimented by leftist Israeli filmmakers who mostly make films critical of their own country and people, while glorifying the supposedly underdog Palestinians (the only exception, the powerful not yet released on DVD Oscar nominated AJAMI co-directed by the unusual combination of an Israeli Christian-Arab and an Israeli-Jew). What the Arabs, Palestinians and Muslims have failed to do on the battlefield and by terror against civilians (defeat Israel and US), they're cleverly succeeding hands down, manipulating the uninformed minds of Americans (or Americans with limited or superficial knowledge of the true ME realities) with well planned, well financed PR on US campuses, Congress lobbying, and cleverly executed cunning films as this one, a terrific and subtle way to undermine America and erode its support of Israel, our most dependable friend in the ME, and undermine support of the efforts of the US after 9/11 and Fort Hood and recent airline bombing attempt, to keep Muslim terrorism away from our own shores so we don't have suicide bombing occuring daily as is happening in Iraq, Afhganistan, Pakistan, and occasionally all over the world. Little wonder that in Amereeka Israelis are depicted as brutal occupiers who've imprisoned the ""poor victimized"" Palestians with walls to make their lives miserable tormenting them at roadblocks, disrupting their daily lives without any seeming reason other than the sadistic pleasure of it.

However, the true facts ignored by the film are: 1) Israel occupied the West Bank after years of relentless Palestinian campaign of terror perpetrated against Israeli civilians, murder and maiming of its men, women, teens, children, and years of Jordanian complicity, 2) West Bank and Gaza were occupied after a war that  started (in 1967) with several huge Arab armies poised on Israel's borders, determined to carry out their slogan ""Itbach al Yahud"" (Arabic for slaughter the Jews). Outnumbered and outgunned, the heroic Israel defeated the combined Arab armies soundly, and decided to hold on to the West Bank in order to push away Jordanian artillary that had Tel Aviv in their range, and have historical claims to the land for which they also paid for with the blood of their sons and daughters in arms; it may have been conquered by the Muslims and occupied for several centuries, but the Jews too have a claim on the land going back 2,000 years, biblical times, 3) it's only after decades of suffering losses in life and property, that Israel finally created road blocks and built the security walls to stop the savage Palestinian suicide bombers and gunmen from reaching their predetermined civilian targets inside Israel, i.e., buses at rush hour, restaurants, discos, malls, cafes, supermarkets, weddings, schools, kindergartens, etc. The film Amereeka paints a different distorted picture of the truth and succeeds in creating in the mind of the watcher a resentment towards Israeli soldeirs manning security road blocks and the security wall because most people around the world enjoy total freedom of movement within their own countries, so why should the Palestinians be deprived the same freedom to enter Israel which they claim is theirs? To an average American or international viewer unfamiliar with the history, the war and terrorism perpetrated by the Palestinians didn't start after Israel was established in 1948, but in the late 1800's, culminating with the murder of the entire unarmed Jewish-Palestinian population in Hebron in 1929 which forced the Jews to organize a defense force that grew into the tough, vaunted IDF. It's not just about the West Bank or Gaza, it's about a nationalistic clash betweeen two civilizations claiming one land as their own, with the Palestinians, having rejected the UN Partition Plan, and having failed to get rid of the Jews by force on the losing end adopting the image of the poor victimized and abused underdog, again far from the truth. If they would lay down their arms, renounce their goal of dsetroying Israel as ordained by their charter, there will be peace, on the other hand, if the Israelis layed down their guns, they would all be exterminated. The  Jews in Israel, having learned the lessons of history, will never allow that to happen, becoming what their biblical forefathers were, great warriors. These are issues that the film Amereeka skirts in its relentless goal of portraying the Palestinians as the good guys and Israel and its people as evil. Israelis aren't evil, they're protecting their homes and families with honor, valor and heroism. Jews didn't just arrive in the Holy Land after WWII as palestinians claim; they've been there for centuries. In the late 1800's and after WWII and establishment of Israel, the country absorbed thousands of Jewish refugees from Europe and even more importantly, 800,000 Jewish refugees from the Arab countries, as many as the Palestinians who fled Israel to make way for the conquering Arab armies which never happened as they lost the war.

Americans in the film Amereeka, with three exceptions, are generally depicted in Amereeka as racists and abusers of Arabs, which is the popular tune often heard in the Arab Middle East: Muslims, Palestinians are all ""victimized, discriminated against, attacked and abused by the West and their Zionist agents, while the wonderful Palestinians and Muslims are exceedingly moderate and totally tolerant of other religions and people"" expressed in the film by the lead Palestinian female welcoming a Jewish-American character into the family, which in reality would never happen. To a Muslim, dating an infidel Jew or Christian is a death sentence. Anyone who doesn't believe me, read the Qur'an. I've read two translations, all its 114 Surahs and over 6,300 verses, and it clearly mandates that Islam is the ""only true religion"" and all the world should be made Muslim by conversion or by the ""sword"", which means the Qur'an actually encourages Muslims to either convert or kill all infidels (Christians, Jews, Hindus, etc.), and anyone who doesn't believe me should do their own due diligence.

It's ironic that the Palestinians and Muslims who've raped, tortured, murdered and maimed 100,000 Christian civilians in Lebanon (10,000 in the city of Demur alone), thousands of Israeli civilians, over 3,000 thousands American civilians, Robert F. Kennedy, hundreds of civilians in European and Asia in recent generations (300 million people during the ancient Muslim Conquest era), are now manipulating American minds successfully with such a clever, cunning, deceptive and insidious propaganada film such as Amereeka, inciting hate towards US & Israel, while creating sympathy among the uneducated for the ""wonderful, loving, secular, moderate"" Palestinians, strategy which to anyone ignorant of Islamic law, is part of the powerful Islamic ""Taqiyya"" (Political Islam's Rules of War) which allows Muslims to deceive the infidels by any means. This film does it with excellence.

Amereeka has already fooled many liberal leftist American-Jewish film critics, Israeli, and other Americans as indicated by the 5 and 4 star Amazon reviews, which denotes a great failure on our part as Americans to understand our cruel and cunning enemy within subverting us in our own homeland, which they are doing successfully especially when our media and politicians are so intimidated by Muslim-American organizations (many fronting HAMAS and terror organizations), that they are afraid of calling Muslim terror attacks such as Ft. Hood by its name: terrorism.

Muslim power is expanding in Europe, as examplified by Holland, soon to be the first Muslim theocracy in Europe, followed by France, Germany, England, Spain, and Belgium, and eventually, the United States. Unfortunately, until we wake up to this new audio/visual psychological mind war within, ordinary Americans unfamiliar with Middle East history and politics will continue to be easily duped by this new type of weapon: slick, deliberately honey-coated, emotionally wrenching, professionally manipulative effective Arab/Palestinian propaganda as the film Amereeka. Only time will bear my review as well researched truth.

If she really had good intentions, the writer-director of Amereeka could have made a sweet universal slice of life film about the immigrant experience (this time about Palestinians) in the US, and their eternal struggle to achieve the American Dream, were it not for her unnecessary, poisonous sniping at the US & Israel.

Lastly, great on the battlefield, Israelis have long lost the ""hearts and minds"" PR war. Let Amereeka serve as an example of what Israel should be doing.",1264204800,13,10619,5.296142433234421

3984210,2,B002T921C0,"This had the potential to be a really good movie, but it fails in almost every aspect.  Despite the good subject matter (Palestinian refugee comes to America), it never gels.  It's hurt by many things.  It has bad cinematography (it's shot 99 percent hand held and staged badly), bad, amateurish acting (especially among the supporting players), bad dialogue that feels like it was written by a college student, blatant symbolism (the main character strikes up a possible relationship with a Jewish school administrator), and it looks like it was edited by a blender.  The film has some random, WTF moments that come out of thin air and seem randomly dropped into the movie (like when the main character decides to sell a weight loss drink).  The film has absolutely no flow to it whatsoever.  It is a plodding mess.  Despite the fact that the film has 10 production companies attached to it, you'd think it would have a more professional polish to it.  It doesn't.  It feels like it was made for 100 dollars.

Ironically, I read an interview by the filmmaker, and she said it took her six YEARS to write this script.  Considering how simplistic the script is, I felt she wrote it in 6 days.

The few bright spots were the lead actress, Nisreen Faour.  She is very good in the lead, and her brother in law, played by Yussuf Abu-Warda, is also really good.  A film that could have been much, much better.  Disappointing.

There is a short film on the DVD called Make a Wish, and it's much better than the feature.  It's only 11 minutes, and has a very powerful ending that you don't expect.",1445904000,,1589,4.597864768683274

3984217,4,B002T921C0,"Amreeka (2009 release; 97 min.) brings the story of Muna, a divorced Palestinian Christian mother raising her teenage son Fadi. As the movie opens, we see Muna going about her daily life, including the tension at the checkpoints near the Israeli border. It isn't long before one day she learns that she has gotten a green card through the infamous lottery. Muna and Fadi cant believe their luck and soon are on their way to Illinois, where Munas sister and her family have been living for 15 years. Alas, upon arriving in the US, the troubles start, starting with the US Immigration officer (he: what is your occupation? Muna: yes, we have been occupied for 40 years, ha!), and later when Muna tries to find a job, having 10 years experience as a bank teller. Meanwhile Fadi goes through his own troubles at school. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the debut feature film from Palestinian-American writer-director Cherien Dabis. She relied on some of her own life experiences when crafting the script. She is an up-and-coming talent, for sure. Second, the movie is set in 2003 (we see footage of Sadam Husseins statute being brought down in Bagdad), obviously a difficult time to be of Arabic descent in this country. The movie focuses quite a bit on that, as both mother and son, as well as her sisters family, endure all kinds of humiliations and/or discrimination. In that sense, a good chunk of the movie makes for difficult viewing. Yet the human spirit endures. When Fadi at one point suggests that they leave the US, Muna hisses back determined We have every right to be here!. The movie also does a good job looking at the utter culture shock that Muna and Fadi experience upon arriving in the US (separate and apart from the discrimination). Third, the acting performances are top notch, none more so than Nisreen Faour as Muna, but check out also Hiam Abbass as her sister in Illinois (Ive seen her in other such movies as The Lemon Tree, Bottle in the Gaza Sea, and May in the Summer). last but certainly not least, there are a number of interesting DVD bonus materials, most of all Make A Wish, the 12 min. 2006 shortie that was the first film from Cherien Dabis, in which a young Palestinian girl in Ramallah without any money wants to desperately buy her mom a birthday cake. Just watch!

Amreeka obtained quite a bit of critical acclaim when it was released in 2009, and rightfully so. Dabis exposes some unpleasant things but it never becomes a bitter or enraged statement. If you like Amreeka, I would recommend you also check out Dabis second feature movie, May In the Summer (2013 release). Meanwhile, if you are in the mood for a top quality (semi-)foreign movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. Amreeka is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1410998400,,2913,4.6875

These characters became real to me, in a way that most films can only dream of accomplishing.

3984225,5,B002T921C0,"This very moving 2009 film written and directed by Cherien Dabis could hardly be more timely, what with the current Immigration issues in filibuster in Washington and entry into the land of hope and liberty, so long a dream for many, now a country under close surveillance of individual privacy. This is a film, simple on the surface, but one with a significant message that would benefit all to watch and digest.

The story opens in Palestine. After her husband divorces her for a slimmer woman, Muna Farah (Nisreen Faour) lives with her cranky mother and her excellent student son Fadi (Melkar Muallem) in an unnumbered house in Bethlehem. Frustrated by the constant need to cross through insulting armed checkpoints as Muna goes to her bank job and Fadi goes to school, they apply for a visa to escape the Palestinian problems  with dreams of an exciting future in the promised land of small town Illinois where Muna's sister Raghda  (the always brilliant Hiam Abbass) and her physician husband Nabeel (Yussuf Abu-Warda) live with their daughters. After one last treachery at customs (where Muna's life savings are confiscated) the two arrive in America. Muna is unable to find work in a bank but is secretly employed in a hamburger joint, befriended by fellow worker, high school dropout Matt (Brodie Sanderson). Fadi gets into school but is immediately ostracized by crude thoughtless students for being foreign and therefore a `terrorist'. Meanwhile Raghda and Nabeel begin to sink into debt when Saddam Hussein is conquered in the Iraqi war and public sentiment is against all Arab speaking peoples. Fadi eventually fights back when the  prejudiced students cause an accident for his mother and is arrested for assault, Muna's `low class' employment is discovered, but when all looks grim the isolated family is befriended by a friendly Polish Jew educator Stan Novatski (Joseph Ziegler), by Matt, and by a worker in the bank that couldn't hire Muna. At least the spirit of a few can intervene to alter Muna and Farid's view of their new home.

Writer/Director Dabis based this story on her family's memories of their lives in rural America during the first Iraq War. It is a potentially painful story to experience, but Dabis fills the dialogue with enough good natured humor that the point of the film is made without excessive preaching yet enough of the realities immigrants from the Middle East face to make the film unforgettable.

Hiam is a superb veteran Palestinian actress whose best role, in my opinion was in Miral and this is one of the reasons that I saw this film. I was hoping, however, that there would be some humor to the film, which it totally lacks. Although I enjoyed the film as far as the overall plot, particularly the culture clash, it had several flaws. First, the sister's husband, a doctor, is having financial problems because his patients supposedly are leaving him because he is an Arab; that is a crock, if for no other reason that A DOCTOR could get a job in ANY hospital. Second, the sister makes absolutely no effort to help the immigrant understand some of the customs which would ease her stay, it appears that she lets her sink or swim, an attitude which is totally unrealistic.

I was definitely not disappointed, the movie had all the elements, humor, tragedy, romance, but most importantly a very intimate story told from the perspective of someone who was the recipient of grossly unfair treatment. I had a tremendous rush of empathy for the West Bank family. The movie really made me reflect on how circumstances and fate can be so unfair to some. It is a film that has stayed with me and I am still thinking about it. Somehow, the film ended a bit too suddenly. I would have enjoyed more of a happy ending. One kind person did make a significant difference in the story. It was a heart warming story that had a very important message.",1339200000,2,795,4.4520547945205475

3984240,5,B002T921C0,"Amreeka is one of those films that won't necessarily change your life, but will certainly give you a new viewpoint and make you think. The plot is very simple and the action is low, but I say this not as criticism because I think it's part of the essence of the movie and the message. It doesn't try to be flashy or over dramatic, but rather portray what life is probably like for the average immigrant to this country.

It's a story centered around Arab Palestinian immigrants which are regarded in this country as ""the enemy"" although as you see clearly in the film this particular family is the type that makes America stronger. They're not terrorists, though they're frequently accused of it, and they seem to keep closely knit, for protection and familiarity.

Some issues dealt with in Amreeka:

Tensions in Israel/Palestine that force them away.
A single mother trying to protect and raise her son.
A new immigrant in a strange country.
Having nothing, being robbed in a strange country.
Teenagers trying to fit in with American culture and deal with adolescence.
Intolerant people displaying hatred and ignorance.
Supporters and open minded people helping the immigrants adjust.

Although simple and low key the movie is surprisingly complex due to the issues above and the superb acting by the cast. The range of emotions is great, and everyone in it is very convincing. The characters are very realistic and well developed as well.

To make it brief, this is a very well done movie that's very enjoyable and makes you think. I would recommend it, especially for fans of indies.",1330992000,,1587,4.841328413284133

3984242,4,B002T921C0,"What would it be like to have to go through a military checkpoint, everyday, to get to and from work?  What would it be like to leave your family and friends 6000 miles behind to find new opportunities?  And what would it be like to be an Israeli Arab and move to Illinois on the same day the US invaded Iraq following 9/11?

I can now image all of these through the ""eyes"" of the characters in this film, Amreeka.

Muna and her high school aged son Fadi decide to leave Bethlehem behind and use the unexpected American visa to build a new life.  They stay with her sister in Illinois, and reality starts to sink in.  Muna has difficulty getting a job in the banking industry.  Fadi has to endure taunts and bullying in school.  Muna's sister feels additional stress when her finances are strained.

The beauty of this film is its grittiness.  Life isn't always bad, nor is it always good.  There are plenty of people already in the US that would love to have the quality of life of Muna and her sister.  But there are also many, many people that are glad that they are not in Muna's shoes.

It's a film that makes you think.  How bad can that be?",1319500800,,1147,4.274418604651163
3984253,4,B002T921C0,"I rented Amreeka because of my respect for Hiam Abbass.  If she's committed to a film, it must be a quality product.  She's an extraordinarily talented actress...and wonderful to look at on the screen.  That intuition served me well here.

The film's subject matter - the grind of Palestinian daily life in the West Bank and the subsequent immigrant experience in the US - is a personal one for writer/director Cherien Dabis.  Though born in Omaha, Dabis' father is Palestinian and mother Jordanian.  So, even though this is a fictional account centered around current-day events, stories from her parents no doubt in small part drove the tales depicted in this movie.

There's a review on these pages that speaks volumes to the authenticity of this movie:  ""For someone who grew up in the West Bank and moved to Illinois, I was amazed at how accurate this film is and how it included so many little details that were right on the money.""  Excellent.  Even as someone who has not lived that experience, I was thrilled at how Amreeka dived into the small details of life on two continents and the small matters that combine to make a jarring transaction from East to West.

One aspect of this movie that appealed to me: an Arabic movie created and carried out by a woman.  If that thrills you and you want more where that comes from, check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Caramel/dp/B0016MLIK2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Caramel</a>&nbsp;from Lebanese writer/director/star, Nadine Labaki.

3984254,5,B002T921C0,"This 2009 film starts out in Israel, where a non-religious Palestinian single mother who works as an accountant in a bank and her teenage son are constantly harassed by the guards at checkpoints.  Life is difficult.  Her husband has left her, her son is growing up angry and it seems there is no way out.  But suddenly there is good news - she wins a lottery that allows her to emigrate to America.  She is overjoyed and she and her son are soon going through customs at Kennedy airport.  It is 2003 and the U.S. has just invaded Iraq so it takes them hours to get through, losing their life savings which she had hidden in a cookie jar which is confiscated because no food is allowed into the country.  But that is just the beginning of her misfortune.

She and her son move in with her sister and her family in Illinois.  Her brother-in-law is a doctor but even though his family has been in America for many years, his clients all leave him because of the prejudice against Arabs.  The son is harassed at school too and soon gets into trouble.  And the newly arrived woman, even though she has two college degrees and much experience in working in a bank, can only find a job at a White Castle. Naturally there are complications in the whole family's life.

I couldn't help be moved by this film.  Nisreen Faour is cast as the mother and is wonderful in the role.  The fact that she is overweight makes her seem very real and I couldn't help identifying with her plight.  How this all turns out gives us hope for the future and I was wistfully smiling at the end.  This moving story of immigration is a true American story.  I found it well done and meaningful.",1307318400,2,1664,4.371335504885994

As the brother in law's medical practice wanes due to anti-Arab feeling, the young Fahdi becomes exposed to verbal abuse and finally stands up to his mother's tormentors. He is rescued by the Polish Jewish principal of his high school who becomes a good friend to Muna. The Palestinians featured in this film are Christians from Bethlehem. The film does not portray their making any community connections (church, social, professional); it is a dreary picture of their home life as well.  Muna's sister tells her daughter, you don't live in America in this house, you live in Palestine when she tries to tell her that she is making the rules for their life."" Muna's sister and her doctor husband have marital difficulties and the oldest daughter is a pot smoker. One wonders why they ever came to the United States or stayed here. Muna, on the other hand, is an upbeat goodhearted person who tries hard to make a life for herself and make connections with people. Her family thinks she is a loser but she is the one who retains her humanity throughout the film and one leaves this film with the feeling that Muna is going to be allright. I tried hard to figure out what the political viewpoint of this movie is and could not see clearly one or the other. Israelis are portrayed as hassling occupiers, the Palestinian family portrayed is nice enough but there is a joyless quality to the mother and father. Muna and Fahdi are rescued by the lonely Jewish principal of the local high school. Other people in the film, make an attempt to help Muna. The film ends with their eating and smoking the hookah pipe at a Middle Eastern restaurant. It shows the family happy and having a good time.

Instead, it is about American-Arab relations after 9/11. This film is so touching, sweet, sad, and uplifting, sometimes all in one scene, that it brought a tear to my eye. You feel for Mona and her son Fadi, while also sympathizing for their family that they move in with, and their homesickness. And your heart will will skip a beat when you realize these people all want to go back to Palestine, even though it is not free at all and Israel keeps sticking their noses in and disrupting all the Palestinians lives.

Highly recommended.",1300233600,2,720,5.0
3984257,5,B002T921C0,"Amreeka focuses on the moving and sometimes humorous story of two Palestinians, a divorced single mother Muna (Nisreen Faour) and her son Fadi (Melkar Muallem) who immigrate to an Illinois suburb in the hopes of living a better quality of life. The casting was very well done and the acting is quite good, too. I also liked the cinematography and the choreography; they add to the film and that's great. The script was well written and the musical score enhances the film as well.

When the action starts, we see how Muna and Fadi--indeed, all Palestinians must live rather inconveniently under Israeli occupation of land in the Middle East, land Palestinians would like to call their own. They must drive through Israeli checkpoints because the Israelis fear terrorist suicide bombers; and what used to be a fifteen minute drive to work now takes Muna almost two hours! However, one day a letter comes; Muna has the chance to immigrate to the United States along with her son, Fadi. Muna is initially reticent to leave their home; but Fadi talks his mother into it and they come to Illinois to live with Muna's sister Raghda (Hiam Abbass), her husband Nabeel (Yussuf Abu-Warda) and their children.

At first things seem promising: their new home which they will share (at least for now) with Raghda's family is much nicer than the home they had in the Middle East; and Fadi is accepted into a local school rather easily. Unfortunately, Muna's luck finding work is not good; she searches in vain for a job in banking which is what she did when she lived in the Middle East. Muna finally gets a job at White Castle but she is too embarrassed to tell her family so she pretends to work at a bank next door to White Castle.  In addition, Fadi also starts to have new problems of his own; the kids and even a teacher in school degrade him and make fun of him for being Arabic (this film takes place during what was a tidal wave of anti-Arabic sentiment in the United States) and even his cousin, Raghda's daughter, can't completely isolate Fadi from trouble.  And, on top of all that, the entire family is being mistaken for being Iraqi; as tensions rise at the beginning of the second Iraqi war Nabeel's medical practice dwindles as his patients leave him and the family even gets a death threat because people think they are Iraqi and not Arabic.

Of course, I could tell you much more but then I'd be starting to spoil it all for you! I will say that you should look for a solid performance by Joseph Ziegler as Fadi's school Principal Mr. Novatski; and Brodie Sanderson does a great job of playing Matt, a co-worker of Muna's at White Castle.

The DVD comes with a few outtakes and deleted scenes; there is also the short film entitled ""Make a Wish.""

Amreeka paints a very good portrait of the challenges that Arabic immigrants faced especially during the wave of anti-Arabic sentiment in our country during the 1990s and after. However, the plot is far from being totally gloomy; there are some humorous and even sweet moments that lighten things up and make this a compelling story with feeling. I recommend this film for anyone interested in bittersweet dramas; immigration issues in general; immigration issues faced by Arabic people and even issues faced by immigrants who are the targets of prejudice when they are mistaken for being members of another group that is not well liked.",1293926400,3,3389,4.685714285714286

It is more like a news report than it is like poetry--except for the music.

The ending caught me by surprise; I wish the director had slowed things down more to show each person reflecting, taking stock of where they were.

It accurately and endearingly shows the adjustment struggle of an Arab family to North America.  I thought the high school scenes were poignant reminders of how high school classes need to be taught as if they were representations of the outside/""real"" world - not free for all zones where you can say anything and not be held responsible!  Everyone needs to learn ""civilised"" behavior,or else we all pay the consequences.  I liked that they spoke real Arabic in Amreeka - did you know that alot of Hollywood Arabic is just gobeltygook?  How disrespectful!  Maybe we can start actually seeing Arabs in film as people, and not the stereotype that gives us permission to project our disowned feelings onto - what a concept!

Realizing that her working life in Palestine is a dead-end, and worrying about her son's prospects for the future, she decides to move to America.  Most of the movie is spent following the main character's life in the United States.

The characters are absolutely believable.  Bravo to the actors, old and young, who brought these characters to life.  The writing avoids the obvious stereotypes which plague Hollywood productions, and provides a rich mixture of humor and drama.  Obviously, the situation in Palestine is a foundation for this movie, but other themes are well-explored: being middle-aged and underestimated by others, the tribulations of adolescence, and the difficulties faced by anyone who finds themselves in a new homeland.

The one failing of this movie (and the only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars) is that its plot has a beginning and a middle, but no end.  The final scene fades to black, as though we might tune in next week to find out what happens next, but then... the credits roll.",1280534400,12,1135,4.936842105263158

You take the first best opportunity that comes along to get out of that situation. Muna, a Palestinian single woman, does just that when she receives an offer to relocate free to America.

She has two degrees and has had professional experience in the work world so it shouldn't take long - wrong! Told with humor as well as heartbreak (it's just after 9/11and anyone from the Middle East is the enemy), this National Geographic film is a reminder of why people still come to AMREEKA and how easy it is to be misunderstood and to struggle to make a living no matter how hard you are willing to work.  It is worth watching by families whose children may be finding it difficult to accept those who don't talk or dress or act just like us.
