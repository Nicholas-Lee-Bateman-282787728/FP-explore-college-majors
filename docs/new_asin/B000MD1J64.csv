8167970,5,B000MD1J64,I recently visited The Craters of the Moon. Having never heard of it before I was a sponge anxious to learn all I could. The shorter video played at the visitor center was a nice appetizer. I told my boyfriend I would much rather have a full length video to take home verses just another t-shirt. So I was thrilled to get this video on the way out of the monument(park). It reveals  an incredible account of a courageous and curious man and his life before and after exploring the monument. Robert Limbert inspires me to reach higher. Thanks for this production.,1435708800,,562,4.509803921568627
