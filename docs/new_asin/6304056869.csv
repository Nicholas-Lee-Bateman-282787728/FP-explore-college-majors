776897,2,6304056869,"Now, here's a movie title I'd heard for years, and I thought I'd finally see it. Reading over the box, it's quite a cast: jaded Humphrey Bogart, sultry Ava Gardner, and one of my favorite romantic stars, Rosanno Brazzi. Plot sounds promising--movie man Bogart molds free soul spaniard Ava into a big movie star desired by many men, but needing to live life on her own terms.  Not to omit either that it was written and directed by Joseph Mankiewicz, of ""All About Eve"" and ""Letter to Three Wives"" fame. Sure fire enjoyment, right? NOT.
1. Terrible dialogue! How come Americans playing ""foreign"" people in movies are always supposed to speak without using contractions? Ava sounds terribly stilted here, and many preposterous lines are uttered by the other cast members.
2. Bad casting! Bogart's a big name, and I guess that why they wanted him, but I'll be darned if I know why he accepted this role. He is not the romantic lead and his character is shown to be spineless early on when he acts like a toady for his tyrannical boss. If you've ever seen Gable in ""The Hucksters"", then you know how that star's character reponds much more admirably to his boss Sidney Greenstreet's attempts to cow him. Here, Bogart cannot command my respect from the get-go.
3. ""Old War Wound"" plot development rears its head again! Oh my gosh, This is by Mankiewicz, not Hemingway--what's this doing here?
So, ""The Barefoot Contessa"" failed all the way round to live up to my expectations, except that it was nice to gaze upon always handsome RB. Rent at your own risk.",996796800,17,1551,4.681318681318682

776973,2,6304056869,"Caught this on TV and I was disappointed and, frankly somewhat bored.
- It started out interesting at Ava's funeral, as I was dying to know what happened to the Ava character.
- but the movie must have been half or more devoted to verbally narrating the back story and as a result there was way too little action.
- the characters were all overdrawn caricatures of fractured people, the flat emotionless billionaire, his very overdrawn loudmouth assistant, and the downtrodden ex-alcoholic director.
 - Ava was very beautiful, but the movie didn't give her enough screen time to build up the believability of her character.
 - Brazzi was definitely eye candy, but his participation in the ending was ridiculously unbelievable.
- still, I couldn't take my eyes off Bogart and Ava and Brazzi.
 - Bogart's character was the only one I could sympathize with.

She fought the studios and eventually made most of her pictures in her later years overseas...in this case Maria (Ava) becomes a star almost against her wishes and finds no joy in the glamour and hype of Hollywood stardom.  Throughout this Bogart (figuratively) holds her hand and tries to calm her when she gets restless.  Maria is searching for something..what even she doesn't know...and she does find what wanted almost by accident.  This gives credence to the cliche..""be careful what you wish for..you may get it"".

.
The Barefoot Contessa is  not a realistic movie and one has to remember that is was made in the 50s, under the supervision of  Hollywood Moral Code, still strong at the time. The story of the unfortunate  Count  and the rising of  Spanish dancer transformed overnight into a star,  is handled by Mankiewied  like a fairy tale and represents Hollywood  fantasy world.  Its plot was  only possible under the morals of the Code. But aside from Its fairy tales aspects,  there is a lot of reality in Maria`s life ( a mix of Gardner  and Rita H.), the  Jet Setters way of life  and Hollywood`s amoral and cruel world . Mankiewied was the cerebral  and wit dialogue type of director and writer and  uses  symbolic images , freely. Although  Bogart intellectual text ( flesh back narration) is beautiful ,it  could take some cutting. Mankiewied`sharp wit dialogues  excellent .Gardner is at the prime of her beauty and I think that she handles her difficult hole quite well. Her  very expressive face, always in  silent close ups, conveys  to the audience  her fillings which matches well with Bogart`s  narrative.",1384646400,,1131,4.790575916230367
777283,5,6304056869,"This is a movie from another era.

It's a fascinating take on the Cinderella story- with tragic consequences.

The script is intelligent, and the storytelling technique, involving flashbacks and narration from the point of view of different characters, is interesting.

Some of the characters are based on real figures in 1950s moviemaking, and there is an element of satire.

The cast is excellent- it's a treat to see Ava Gardner, Humphrey Bogart, Edmond O'Brien, Rossano Brazzi and Marius Goring together, with an intelligent script.

The Italian settings are gorgeous!

Frankly, this film is not for everyone- it is a classic from another era, with a focus on the story, rather than action. If that's the kind of film you like, I'm sure you will like this one.",1384300800,,764,4.9763779527559056

If you like ""Sunset Boulevard"" you could see this as sort of a knock-off of that classic, with the bullet going from a different character, into the star.  And the voice-over narration is handed off between the various (male) characters involved in the unravelling of the Star.  Unfortunately, ""Sunset Boulevard"" works a lot better than ""The Barefoot Contessa"",  And Ava Gardner gets way too much abuse!

Like many of it's contemporaries, it's a long and slow moving film, but, unfortunately, it also fails to add up to anything compelling.  I'm a fan of ""Night Of The Iguana"" and every time I see it, I want more of Ms. Gardner.  I've yet to see anything where she has the impact she does in that film, and this is no exception.

It's filmed in various locations, here and overseas, but the setting isn't as important to the film as it is in ""Summertime"" or ""Vertigo"", and if you want to see Ike's Americans, in full period color, I'd recommend one of those two films.

.....If Hollywood was going to make a movie to showcase an actresses bare feet they should have at least used an actress with pretty feet.  Ava was a beautiful woman but her feet were not her most attractive asset.  I have seen most of Ava's movies and this was by far her most wooden performance, far worse than The Killers and Mogambo.  Ava didn't get many oppertunities to act, she got the typical Hollywood treatment of a glamor girl, an expensive wardrobe and good lighting to highlight her beauty.  She made one movie that is worth owning if you are a collector. Her performance as Gregory Pecks love interest in ""On the Beach"".

777407,2,6304056869,"REVIEW CONTAINS PLOT SPOILERS (though I did not think this was a very plot-driven movie)

The Barefoot Contessa is only slightly over two hours long, but it seems interminable. As World War II came to an end and the European economic recovery fueled by the Marshall Plan took effect, Americans were beginning to enjoy travel in Europe. Here we have two very big stars (Humphrey Bogart and Ava Gardener) and a film crew getting to spend several weeks along the Riviera making ""The Barefoot Contessa."" They probably should just have taken a vacation in Europe, though the decision to make this flimsy excuse of a movie probably made tax sense.

Joseph L. Mankiewicz wrote and directed this story of Maria Vargas, a ""Spanish dancer"" from a sordid background whose beauty and supposed talent attract Hollywood scouts to the seedy Madrid nightclub where she performs. After about half an hour of talk and maneuvering, she's convinced to come to Hollywood where she gains stardom as ""Maria D'Amato."" There's more talk and I fell asleep for about 15 minutes. She goes back to Europe where, along the Riviera, she mingles with the ""international society"" set, which includes a number of deposed but still monied aristocrats. After never allowing herself to love anyone, she falls in love with an Italian count--or maybe he's French or from Monaco. From somewhere along the Riviera anyway, and he owns some impressive real estate with sweeping views. They marry in the Catholic church, and on their wedding night, he tells her her can't function as a husband due to injuries sustained in the war. To give the count an heir, which Maria thinks will make him happy, she fools around with a gardener. When the count finds out, he kills Maria. The story is told as a series of flashbacks, interspersed with scenes her rain-soaked funeral.

To the extent the movie has a story arc, it's about Maria's ""fairy tale"" life, from the gutter to fame and fortune to royalty, and then her unhappy ending. The real concern seems to be to give Mankiewicz an opportunity to vent his obsessions about the phoniness of the movies, the film industry, and society as a whole, and boy does he vent. The characters, mostly the supporting characters, talk on and on and on about matters that have little bearing on the story. Their chatter does nothing to advance the story or develop the characters. The script strains for wit it almost invariably fails to find. Although the Riviera settings are gorgeous, the camerawork does little to bring them, or the characters, to life. If the ten commandments of good storytelling all rolled into one are ""show don't tell,"" this movie will spend eternity in hell. It's all telling and no showing.

This was my first Ava Gardner movie and I suspect it will be my last. She's a feast for the eyes and wears lovely and seductive costumes as Maria. Unfortunately, she has about as much charisma as a cardboard box.

Humphrey Bogart is competent and gives a relaxed but not particularly memorable performance as the film director who shapes Maria's career.

Not recommended except for people who have to see everything Bogart ever did.",1272844800,7,3140,4.848880597014926
777408,3,6304056869,"There might be a good movie in here somewhere with some serious editing of the script.  I'm not sure if it was actually very, very long or if it just seemed that way.

On the plus side, there are the stars:  Ava Gardner is spectacular looking in a 1950's movie-star way and she gets to wear a lot of glamorous clothes, including some snazzy one-piece swim suits.  Humphrey Bogart plays his usual wiser-than-anyone-else-in-the-film self and he does it well.  When he, as a writer-director, meets her, as a Spanish cabaret dancer, in her dressing room, there is an immediate sense that these two are in the same league, whereas the others are second-rate background characters. If this connection had been developed into a romance the movie might have had some sizzle.

But the Bogie character has a sensible, boring girl back home and Ava goes on from one rich cad to another until she finally her Prince Charming.  Since the opening scene shows her funeral, we know that she's not going to fare well and it's only a matter of seeing how she comes to her demise.  Perhaps if someone else had played the Italian Count/Prince Charming, her decision might have been more understandable.  Apparently Rossano Brazzi, who plays him, was a hot item at the time but I never understood his appeal. He's not handsome, is rather stocky, has no facial expressions and delivers his lines in a terribly wooden way.  Maybe the heavy Italian accent is what some find charming.

My ending to the story would be to have Bogie grab Ava halfway through the film and say ""Cut the crap; you belong with me!""  Bogie's script-girl girlfriend could have one of the vapid rich guys and everyone would live happilly ever after.

There are the usual colorful shots of the French Riviera that were so appealing in 50's films but they are not worth the price of this picture.  See ""To Catch a Thief"" instead.  Or anything else.",1268784000,5,1896,4.685800604229607

Moreover, Mankiewicz chose the lethal combination of the movie industry and the international jet set as his vitriolic target this time. Nonetheless, much like Rob Marshall's recent adaptation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nine/dp/B001FB55O4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nine</a>, the movie simply lacks propulsion in the narrative flow and the characters any real depth to give the viewer a valid reason to engage in the fanciful story apparently based on Rita Hayworth's checkered life.

With a rather affected accent, Gardner plays Maria Vargas, a beautiful Spanish dancer discovered in a Madrid nightclub by a megalomaniacal Howard-Hughes-like tycoon, Kirk Edwards. She despises him almost immediately, but she does connect with one of his cohorts, a has-been writer/director named Harry Dawes, who convinces her to do a screen test. No romance develops between Maria and Harry but rather an abiding friendship that leads to international stardom after only three movies. Meanwhile, love escapes her but not tabloid scandal as her father stands trial for killing her mother. A convenient affair with Alberto Bravano, a South American bon vivant, follows, but their mutual manipulation seals the fate of the relationship. Maria finally meets the man of her dreams, Count Vincenzo Torlato-Favrini, and all's right with her world until a humiliating secret threatens to shatter everything.

The framing device of the funeral makes the resolution of the storyline all too clear, and the recurring use of flashbacks and voiceovers will be familiar to anyone who has seen Mankiewicz's two earlier classic films. Gardner is luscious to look at, especially in one shipboard scene where she throws a towel aside as everyone gawks at her beauty, but she even seems lost by some of the script machinations. Bogart plays Harry with the right jaundiced tone, but there is only so much he can do as an observer of the action and simply hands the picture to Gardner. Warren Stevens, Marius Goring (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Red-Shoes/dp/B00000IPHT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Red Shoes</a>), and Rosanno Brazzi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Summertime/dp/6305094934/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Summertime</a>) play their accustomed types adequately, but the one true scene-stealer is Edmond O'Brien as mouthy agent Oscar Muldoon constantly wiping the sweat off his brow (naturally he is the one who won an Oscar).

What we get instead, is Maria Vargas being pursued by  a series of ruthless and sullen rich men without a grain of real or palpable passion. In fact, all the leading men are rendered impotent in one way or another, fueling an unsettling uneasiness that grinds us along. With Ava and Bogart as two aloof characters at the film's center, our attention turns to the churn of ambience and mise-en-scene that sets the historical framework, providing some insight into the vacuity of the international set.

The story starts in Madrid where Bogie plays a film writer who is at a nightclub with two movie executives looking for new talent.  They heard about this beautiful and talented singer/dancer and want to get a look for themselves.  The singer, played by Gardner, stuns all three and they want to sign her to a long term contract.  She could become the next big Hollywood star.  Gardner's character comes from modest means, but after a few fits and starts, she becomes one of the most celebrated and admired stars in Hollywood.  All of this stardom has not brought her happiness.  She eventually falls in love with an Italian count whom she marries, but this marriage is eventually her downfall and she dies tragically.  Bogie was her one true friend and soulmate who really understands her, even if they are never romantically involved.  This film is her life's tale seen largely through Bogie's eyes.

Eva Gardner is the real star of this film.  She was given (or chose to play in) very few good films during her career, but this is one of her best.  Gardner was, in my opinion, a great actress who is rarely given credit for her acting ability because she played in a large number of second rate stories.  In this film she plays the role of the beautiful but unhappy celebrity to a tee.  Perhaps she wasn't acting in this role?  Beyond Gardner though, there is a lot to like about this film.  Bogie plays the controlled, worldly, screen writer who won't be swayed by the lies and hypocrisy of the Hollywood execs and the uber-rich.

The film was populated by harsh, self-indulgent, and unsavory men who all came off second-best to Bogart, a cynical but comparatively likable character...

The plot had strong cinematic possibilities, but the script by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who also directed, had ambiguous passages, overly ornate, and ultimately tiresome...",1166313600,11,1577,5.270916334661354

777497,4,6304056869,"In vivid Technicolor, Academy Award winning THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA stars ravishing Ava Gardner as Maria Vargas -- a rising movie star with a heart in more humble surroundings and romantic dreams based on storybook fantasies that end in tragedy. Beginning with Harry Dawes (Humphrey Bogart), the men in her short life have flashbacks about how each met and affected her. Between stories, the camera pans back to the active cemetery funeral service before zooming in on a new character.

Harry, a movie writer/director who has his own love interest, nurtures with Maria more of a protective sibling relationship than carnal attraction. She may see the wisdom in his advice at times but is motivated by her own heart and fairy tales. With the stage presence of Catherine Zeta-Jones, 30-year-old Gardner actually had the most difficult role to convey as Maria. Though she preferred to walk barefoot, she no longer was comfortable hiding in the squaller and she was not happy with the life as an instant Hollywood sensation. Maria was too much woman for the lowly gypsies with which she grew up and not enough for the misogynistic aristocrats bemused by her chastity and surreal beauty.

There is some romance but with Harry having his own girl, the narration and vignettes come across more as a suspenseful -- often comedic documentary than a romantic love story. Adding to this are Maria's unrealistic ideas about love that were only transcended by the man she eventually married. In the end you have a complete picture of who Maria was, by whom was she known as THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA, and why her life ended so abruptly. With four intertwined stories to tell, the movie may appear a bit long at 130 minutes. Yet, Gardner lights up each scene. There are also some ""well-known bright remarks,"" coming from the vicinity of Bogart.

Favorite quotes: (1) ""Script girl, name is Jerry.""""She has the name of a man?""""I assure you there is no further resemblance."" (2) ""I do not like Mr. Kirk Edwards.""""You're standing at the end of a very long line.""",1155254400,3,2038,4.884393063583815

777501,5,6304056869,"If there is some aspect that featured the Fifties was the chilling cynicism and full questioning respect all what it was associated with power. On the other hand this psychological reaction molded and was molded too by a sociological state of anger, fury and hopeless around the social body. Far beyond the fact to have wined the war, the surrounding atmosphere was of total rebelliousness in the youth (birth of Rock & Roll), evasion (Science fiction) or sharp facing respect social realism  (Noir film expansion, to other latitudes, as Kiss me deadly that deals with the possible nuclear consequences or the vanished line between law and justice As pick up on South street), but there was still another third way that was initiated among others filmmakers (Elia Kazan, Billy Wilder, Edward Dmytrik, Samuel Fller, Robert Aldrich, Nicholas Ray, Otto Preminger and Mankiewicz) who focused around the inner demons (Baby Doll), vices (The man with the golden arm), adultery in the military statement (Anatomy of a murder), syndicalism (On the waterfront) where the anti hero reached a status legend.

In this sense, The barefoot Contessa, should be watched under this somber perspective. All about Eve meant somehow the first step in this sense, but Sunset Boulevard went far beyond; its thematic audacity shocked the collective conscious.  ""The barefoot..."" signified an absolute reject respect the tinsel of the success in Hollywood and how you can lead an unknown woman to the peak of stardom without a special talent, just supported by other attributes. If you realize for instance, the crucial meaning of The sweet smell of success you would complete the ambitious gaze respect a Decade signed for the fugacity of the fame; and that is why Bogart, in the first minutes of the film about Faust; the analogy is more than obvious. You sold your soul in the market of values disregarding the ulterior and mortal consequences this decision may convey.

The powerful anecdote was perhaps, too strong in those days; where the avidness of the producers to recreate another stories obligated to many directors to find in the Literature waters abundant material, but Arthur Miller, Eugene O'Neil, John Steinbeck, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway would not give the audiences sweets for the spirit. The beatnik generation was in its boiling point, but that is another story.

Go for this bold and not easy to swallow picture. In spite of the elapsed years it contains still a strong doses of bitterness. Superb cast, glorious script and eloquent direction.",1137888000,4,2549,5.117788461538462
777502,3,6304056869,"On the positive side, the color and clarity of the movie are good for a older movie, almost not seeming old at all in that way. Ava Gardner looks gorgeous.

I read all the glowing reviews of this movie here before buying it, but I was dissappointed in it. I was bored by the predictable arc of the story, the cartoonish stereotypical characters (the evil abusive millionaire, the sweaty faced agent), and the long drawn out conversations which could have been edited down 80% without losing much. The entire story is improbable and not in any way adequately developed - a bar dancer suddenly becoming a huge star, yet we never see her dance in the bar, and never see her act in her ""movie"".

Garnder is not convincing in her role at all, especially with the fake spanish accent. She is beautiful but she lacks the pizaz and confidence of a Monroe, Taylor, or Bardot. I am no fan of Bogart but he comes across as decent uncle-like figure - which Ava ascertains by talking to him for 60 seconds after he barges into her room as a stranger. But he is so terribly miscast as a filmmaker, that I could never really even accept it. The big scene with the agent on the phone is such an obvious acting job of the actor yelling to the audience its painful to watch. There is nothing genuine in any way about this movie's story or the characters playing it.

To me the only value in it, is in a specimen of early 50's Hollywood. If you like old movies then fine. But this is not up to snuff by modern standards at all. I find myself wondering why there are shadows on every wall in an interior room and hair always lit (due to the multiple stage lights used for filming). Its also amusing to see the subtle sexism (e.g. the ease in which men put their hands on Gardner and talk to her like a child). The only curiosity is the strangely anti-mother twist to it. By the way what is a ""bent kopec""?",1137196800,5,1885,4.304225352112676
777503,5,6304056869,"I have to give this five stars because it is a movie that has stayed in my mind for more than 20 years. Viewing it again, years later, it has some endearingly melodramatic moments, but holds up very well, and is still probably one of my top 5 favorites.

  This is the period of movies like THE RED SHOES that have really beautiful sceen pictures, beautiful costumes, rich color.  A perfect forum for Ava Gardner who continues to hold the title in most people's minds of ""the most beautiful woman ever.""  Cyd Charisse runs her a good race.  Given that this is the story of a mesmerizing dancer, one has to wonder if she was being considered for this role.  Cyd Charisse said with her dance what Ava Gardner does with her acting.

  Previous reviewers have failed to mention that this is not just a Cinderella story, almost a ""Camille"" story, too, but it closely - VERY closely - parallells what has become common knowledge about Ava Gardner's personal life.  The dynamic of her beauty and charisma being parlayed into fame, coming from ""the dirt"" (she was supposedly ""discovered"" while picking cotton in the South), and her inability to suppress her sexual appetites, destroying marriages and marring her career. It is perhaps BECAUSE of this that this role is tailor made for Gardner, and she really does a beautiful job.  She is better in the tempestuous moments than the thoughtful ones.  She seems a little bored by her own past, but such is the lot of a beauty... she spends a lot of time recounting things to men who really don't care what she has to say.

  Some feel the story is trite, but the technique of using flashbacks from 3 different perspectives remains interesting, and a rarely used device.  The issue that dates the movie is the inability to speak very openly about sex when that becomes a driving motivator within the script.  The fact that the Count does not touch her before their wedding (and is so droolingly handsome), when every other man wants to paw her, is an incredible aphrodisiac.  It seems to be men who don't like this movie, and I'd venture to say this is something women ""get"" that makes the movie ring true, that these guys aren't understanding, and don't want to.  It is all there, but it is all subtle and between the lines, and some of it really needs to be spelled out a bit more.  But that is her problem with the Count, ultimately, not talking first - and that is a real problem people still face.

  Rosanno Brazzi remains for me the most handsome man ever on film.  The only thing I really don't understand about this movie is why she lets him walk away, when she should have said ""Hold it right there, buster...there's more than one way to peel a banana.""  ; )  Bogart is actually likable and fatherly in this film, a change of pace for him, in addition to his being part of a really stable marriage with a pretty, smart woman, makes his character very interesting, and I can see exactly why he would chose it.

  Given the time period and the rags to riches story, what is surprising about this movie is that is remains so accurate and so deep, about conflicting motivations in the dynamic between men and women, and how Hollywood exploits the surface for men to sell pictures of women to men.",1135209600,3,3241,4.5283993115318415
777504,2,6304056869,"The mid-50's saw some awesome color movies.  TV was killing Hollywood and they were forced to go to the more expensive print to compete.  The Barefoot Contessa shows us the French- Italian Riviera circa 1954 as a lost paradise.  The film was a Ava Gardner star vehicle.  Her fashions, the filmy gowns and gold laced pant-suit outfits, the glossy red lipstick and black hair were something to look at all right.  It could have been overly gaudy, but Humphrey Bogart had a lot of clout at the end of his career, so though this is a failed film, they tried.

Barefoot also push's the life style of the rich and famous envelope for the folks back in Peoria.  This is what it must be like to live like Ava and Humphrey.  The homes, the clothes, the parties, and the nasty money boys, its all stereotyped, but your 1954 date isn't complaining and you might get to third base later.

777546,5,6304056869,"This 1954 film was written and directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz who sure does know how to make movies.  In one of the very first scenes, Ava Gardner is dancing in a nightclub in Spain.  We know she's great even though the camera isn't on her for one minute.  All we do is hear the music and watch the faces of the people watching her.  By the time we do see her, she's already in her dressing room.  She's absolutely gorgeous and lights up every scene she's in.  We see her character's rise to movie stardom and share the unfulfilled life she leads.  And then, just when we think she's finally found happiness, tragedy strikes.  It's a modern day classic drama with a story that pulled me right in.
Humphrey Bogart plays a movie director who befriends this ""barefoot Contessa"", nicknamed that because she was once so poor that she didn't have shoes.  She prefers going barefoot and this theme is emphasized all the time, showing her barefoot whenever possible.  Rossano Brazzi, who doesn't appear till late in the film, is cast as the true romance in her life.  All of these actors do a good job, but I was particularly impressed with the performance of Edmund O'Brien, cast as a public relations man for a studio executive.  It's a small part but I just kept thinking how good he was.  Later I discovered that he won an Academy Award for this role.
It's the screenplay that moves the action.  It never lagged and I sat there with my eyes glued to the screen wondering what would happen next.  Considering that this is basically just a love story, that's saying a lot.  I totally enjoyed the viewing experience.  It's too bad though, that there were no features included on the DVD.  It would have been nice to have a little more background.  ""The Barefoot Contessa"" gets a high recommendation from me just because I enjoyed it so much.",1043452800,91,1836,4.5426829268292686
777547,5,6304056869,"In the film, ""The Barefoot Contessa,"" Humphrey Bogart indeed is a cynic from the very start. He niether likes his role of being a paid screenwriter on the payroll of a very moody boss and his talkative associate (Edmond O'Brien), nor does he enjoy exploiting himself. Ava Gardner as Maria is a very grounded dancer in Madrid, who cannot make up her mind between wanting stardom or wanting the simple life in her hometown. She is torn from the very start and feels she never quite belongs to the Hollywood scene. Nevertheless, all the men, except Bogart and O'Brien, are after her beauty and want a piece of her fragile being, only to end up a fatal end to her short life.
  The story is rather complex and if you don't pay attention to each word, you may get lost with what exactly is happening. Each word the player says is meant completely, and the film is dependent on each charactors wordplay. The actor Edmond O'Brien, for instance, uses this method effectively and grabs every scene from the film that he's in. He was fantastic in it and probably was the most humble of the characters. He really deserved his Best Supporting Actor Academy award for 1954.
  Ava Gardner, sorry to say it, was merely a ploy throughout the film to pretty much show the masterful direction of Mankanviez (sp?). She was marvelous, though, and completely made the film the success as it stands today. People watch it because of her screen presence, not to examine Bogart's duantless growl or O'Brien's snappy chit-chat; it's Gardner's presence and appeal that really brought the film into status.
  Overall, if you get the DVD, the clarity is remarkable and you can really notice how well Gardner spoke, see every grimace of Bogart's usual snarl and hunched back, and see some wonderful panoramic views that only Technicolor could produce.

777548,4,6304056869,"THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA is a glorious, rich tapestry of backstage Hollywood.  Starring a stellar cast headed by Humphrey Bogart and the divine Ava Gardner, it is a ravishing delight.

Her kind director Harry Dawes (Humphrey Bogart - THE BIG SLEEP, KEY LARGO) sees big things in her future, but Maria remains aloof and mysterious, both on the screen and off.
Maria's story is told in flashback from various viewpoints; a very effective tool in the telling of this rather predictable tale.  Director/writer Joseph L. Mankiewicz weaves a colorful yet subtle portrait of a woman torn between two worlds.

777551,5,6304056869,"Yes, this is a much more mature movie than most are used to these days and the story takes a bit longer to gain momentum.

The characters actually have depth and they can act! How refreshing. While watching I found myself just intrigued with Ava Gardner and think she is perhaps one of the most beautiful women ever to grace the earth. The dialogue is simply deliciously revealing as the characters speak from their hearts.

""There's more to talking than just words...""

Ava plays the Barefoot Contessa, Maria Vargas who is discovered in Madrid. I expected there to be much more dancing in this movie, being it was about a dancer. However, there is just really one scene of her dancing out in the open with her gypsy friends where she sees the man she falls madly in love with. He is a nobleman and can provide everything for her. She sees him as the man who has seen more in her than any man ever has before.

The scenes where Ava and Bogart converse are the most meaningful. Bogart has a way of bringing out Maria's natural curiosity. When anyone tells her ""no"" she says ""yes."" She is determined to be owned by no one and yet, everyone seems to want to own her. She fears being exposed and unprotected. Emotionally, she is still a child in many ways and believes in fairy tales. The harsh realities of loving someone and not receiving it in return seem foreign to her.

The first scene is in a graveyard and from here, the scenes flash back to the past in a continuous fashion throughout with narration.  Each part of the story is revealed at just the right moment.

The rest of the movie seems to deal more with her career and love interests. The theme of Cinderella and ""shoes"" plays out well and is very significant in many ways. I thought that even though it wasn't really mentioned, when Maria says she didn't forget her shoes in one scene and Bogart picks them up for her, this symbolizes her complete trust in him. Watch for the significance of the shoes in one of the last scenes as well.

The prince in this story loves Cinderella, there is just something he can never give her. While Maria says she needs someone to love her and make her feel safe, she wants the entire ""Prince"" package. What she finds is someone who doesn't love her enough at first, to tell her he can't make her completely happy.

777552,5,6304056869,"Joseph Mankiewicz was a dialogue master as well as a brilliant director, as evidenced by hits such as ""All About Eve"" and ""A Letter to Three Wives.""  He is on top of his game once more writing about a familiar area, the world of film, in ""The Barefoot Contessa.""  This film is the number one showcase vehicle in the career of the astoundingly beautiful Ava Gardner, cast in this drama as Maria Vargas, a dancer from Madrid who is discovered by film director Bogart on behalf of his then producer boss, Warren Stevens, a humorless, ruthless financial giant modeled somewhat on the persona of Howard Hughes.  From there she goes on to a brief and meteoric career as an international film star before meeting an untimely death at the peak of her beauty and screen renown.  Mankiewicz pulls out all stops to display her beauty at every angle, showcasing that beautifully chiseled face accented by the elegant cheekbones.
Bogart plays the role of a world-wise oracle, delivering pungent Mankiewicz one-liners, along with snappy first person narration.  He serves as a surrogate father for the restless Gardner, who detests the superficilialities of the film world.  A free spirit, she loathes stardom's confinements of living in a glass house, seen by all.  Bogart serves as a convenient buffer from Stevens, who Gardner, as well as everyone else, detests with a passion.
Eventually Gardner meets the handsome prince of her exotic dreams in Italian nobleman Rossano Brazzi, but the tragedy is that he is compelled to love her ""with all my heart"" and is unable to provide her with the kind of physical fulfillment she desires due to a war injury that has left him impotent.  When she endeavors to fulfill his desire for an heir by having an affair with another man, he fails to see things her way and believes she has betrayed him when she had launched the affair to please him.  Disaster results.
Fans of Edmond O'Brien, who performed with great accomplishment in the film noir classic ""D.O.A."" as well as in many other films, were overjoyed to see this fine actor honored with an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in playing nervous, palm-sweating public relations man Oscar Muldoon in ""The Barefoot Contessa.""

Ava Gardner is beautiful, classy, and self-assured; she has high expectations for life and is not willing to settle for less.  Humphrey Bogart does well as the character we might expect: a wise and worldly director/writer--the tough guy with a heart who befriends Gardner--the woman every man wishes he could have.  Edmond O'Brien is brilliant as the PR flack to two men who can buy anything--except Maria Vargas (Ava Gardner).  O'Brien is  the crass American, always running his mouth, always looking at the money angle.

Growing up in the sixties provided me with ample opportunity to see his films since back then VHS stations had classic films as their staple. Even with that being the case I didn't have the chance to see them all or even most of them. Thank goodness for the invention of video and later disc. Because of that I now have the chance to see things I missed like this feature.

Opening with the funeral of a movie star the movie features Bogart as Harry Dawes, a down on his luck director whos been teamed up with a producer new to the business, Kirk Edwards (Warren Stevens). Kirk is a man with too much money and too little know how. To support him he has PR man Oscar Muldoon (Edmund OBrien) on hand to kiss his ring and do as hes told. It was a performance that won OBrien an Oscar.

One night they come across a flamenco dancer named Maria Vargas (Ava Gardner) in a small club while scouting locations. Having caught his eye Kirk wants her for the movie even if she has no experience. Except that she speaks to no one.

Harry tracks her down to the small apartment where she lives with her family. There he convinces her to join the team and from there she achieves stardom.  Maria and Harry remain friends but to Kirk she remains a possession. She leaves him to be with a wealthy South American named Alberto Bravano just to spite Kirk but eventually leaves him as well. It isn't until she meets Count Vincenzo Torlato-Favrini (Rossano Brazzi) that she finds love but there is a secret there that remains hidden until her death.

All of this might seem like a spoiler but most going into the film know the story already. Even the blurbs on disc covers discuss most of it. It isn't the beginning to end tale that is the main focus here but the way the story unspools that holds the viewers interest. Some have called the story weak and found it boring, others praise it for its simplicity and straightforward telling of the tale. As for myself I found it tedious at moments but entertaining on the whole.

Bogart isn't used as much as I would have liked to have seen him, especially since hes a name above the title here. One has to assume that was to create a draw for the film as he was still a box office presence at the time. Still his performance is a subtle one that displays his abilities quite well. Gardner is a sight to behold as well, showing she had more talent than given credit for over the years.

In the end its one of those movie that talks about the tragedies that befall those in the film business without trying to make it appeal for sympathy of those involved on the seedier side of things. Its entertaining and a piece of film history to be enjoyed.

Twilight Time presents the film in the best way possible but what else would we expect?

7861037,2,6304056869,"The Barefoot Contessa is one of Ava Gardners most famous movies, and some say it embodied her real-life escapades, but since I don't like her movies and think she was a pretty terrible person, I don't like it. Humphrey Bogart couldn't even fix it.

At the start of the movie, we see the attendants at Ava Gardners funeral. Four men, Humphrey Bogart, Rossano Brazzi, Edmond OBrien, and Marius Goring, tell fragments of her life story to the audience in flashback. In a way, it reminds me of The Bad and the Beautiful, where four people tell Kirk Douglass story in flashbacksbut I love that movie and consider it an insult to compare it to Ava Gardners film. I don't usually like movies told in flashbacks because the audience isn't permitted to follow a linear story, and The Barefoot Contessa is no exception. I won't spoil the plot, but whatever the audience learns about Ava is anticlimactic and a little boring.

Unless you really love Ava Gardner, this isn't a classic Id recommend watching. Personally, I prefer my Barefoot Contessa on Food Network.",1504915200,,1054,4.785714285714286
