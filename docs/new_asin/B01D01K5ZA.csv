7695962,5,B01D01K5ZA,This film is great!,1458604800,,19,4.0
7695963,4,B01D01K5ZA,"This is a low budget Troma style film. During a zombie apocalypse, apparently biblical in nature, or not, the production focuses on 4 women but hardly exclusively. The film had numerous side bars which didn't tie-in to the main plot, but were there just to add to the campy nature of the film.
About everything about this film was bad. The acting was bad and in one scene even the other actresses were snickering. There are several references to zombie films and other ""B"" movies including names such as ""Sam Ritter"" and ""Clint Howard."" In depth knowledge of Clint Howard films is not necessary but knowing his physical appearance might aide in a laugh or two.

There is a non-nude cat fight (why bother?) while the rest of the film is full of nudity, including full frontal and Troma style fake male organs. There is a zombie rape scene with one such organ and an ensuing scene that borders on porn.

There is a subplot inside of a suburban party house with odd kinky characters. The language and metaphors are very adult oriented. Zombies are described as ""aggressive speed walking"" with Romero's walkers being rated as best and fast moving zombies are for...

Death metal is the preferred sound track.

F-bomb, sex, rape, nudity (Jenny Jannetty, Rita Christine, Candra White, Katie Host, Nicol Shepherd, Ophelia Rain, Eden Vivienne)",1458000000,2,1335,4.842105263157895
7695964,2,B01D01K5ZA,"First off this trainwreck of a movie is lacking in so many areas. Bad acting, poor visual effects, bad zombie makeup, and a lack of a true script. Add that to the audio track not working right during speaking parts and you just get a mess. But for straight men you do see lots of boobs. Id suggest you buy zombie strippers instead.",1472342400,5,331,4.26984126984127
7695965,1,B01D01K5ZA,"This movie is lacking certain things that I generally expect: a plot, acting and dialogue for examples. A script would have helped. Perhaps set and costume designers who knew what they were doing could have been found? Low budget? More like No Budget. I wonder if cast and crew weren't paid with beer. ""I'm too pretty to die"" was probably the most intelligent line in the movie. I can't think of a single movie I have ever seen that was worse than this garbage. Normally, I would put a reject in the garage sale pile but this one went straight from DVD player to trash can. It would be an act of cruelty to pass it on. This isn't campy, or a spoof. It is just a Royal Mess.",1471132800,2,673,4.224806201550388

7695969,1,B01D01K5ZA,"A few times I considered stopping this film but I fought my way through it, and wasted way too much time doing so. It rarely bodes well for a film when the cast and crew, including director Brad Twigg, need to write reviews for it, instead of allowing actual viewers, unrelated to the production, to offer opinions. This is a juvenile, meandering mess that runs way too long and offers little to no well-written resolution. It's not a good film by any means. However if your standards are low, very low, and you enjoy films that offer nothing more than bad sex jokes, this forgettable affair is bound to be your banana.",1460246400,6,619,4.535714285714286

7695972,4,B01D01K5ZA,"The acting in this one is hard to criticize.  Our main stars of the film are great and equally amazing.  They bring the film to life and hold the viewers attention.  Then we get some characters that are campy and cheesy while others are jut there purely for eye candy.  Thank you Brad for the eye candy!

The story for this one is another zombie outbreak flick but this one is full of sex, humor, and characters straight out of a Troma flick.  The film relies heavily on humor and there is more wtf"" moments then you can handle.

Finally, the film is full of gore, bloody boobs, and the undead.  The gore looks great and the practical effects are top notch.  The kills are nothing new but they throw just enough gore and sex appeal into it that the viewer cant look away.  Overall, Milfs vs. Zombies is  fun as hell.  If you don't shower after you watch this film then you clearly did not pay attention.  This is one dirty horror film and one you will not want to miss.",1458604800,2,969,4.258241758241758
7695973,5,B01D01K5ZA,This movie has everything I used to enjoy before it became all about the special effects and computer animation with all the blood gore and boobies a man can handle.,1458604800,3,165,4.533333333333333

Hilarious cheese fest on this. This movie tries hard to be cheesy and funny. It does well at both. It's over the top and these actors ham it up to a hilarious level on purpose, very high level. You get some good nudity with some of it full frontal even. It could have used a bit more nudity, not because I want a porn but because a film like this is trying to go extreme on everything from the ham acting to the gore on screen but the appearances of nudity doesn't keep up but where it pops up, it's done well for a movie like this.

The subtracting of a star on my rating was more because of the fact this is letterbox format so if you have a modern tv, you get to see a shrunken video in a box (black bars around the video). The movie itself I would give a solid 4.5 stars. Some of the actors, such as the two girls who go full frontal nude, don't even try to act or do anything outrageous like some of the other actors that made this a pleasure to watch. I guess they figure all they had to do was look good and be naked to be enough, which was a let down. Being sexy doesn't mean you can skimp on doing well in your role. This is a very minor gripe. My major gripe is that this is letterbox format with no way that I know of to obtain this movie in a proper format.

This movie is hilarious to watch and listen to. The dialogue is the most fun part for me but watching the stupidity of it all is great fun too and the gore effects in the movie are quite good and not just boring stuff to put you to sleep or annoy you. They get creative in this movie, something many movies, especially Zombie films, often tend to now lack.

With this package you get just the dvd art and inside is only a disc. For the price this is currently selling for, that's fine with me and the case isn't one of those crappy ""eco"" cases that risks your cover art getting a hole punched in it. It's a normal dvd case. On the disc, along with the feature, you get: making of that's appears to be just people from the movie giving commentary (haven't watched this yet; just did a brief skip through), deleted scenes which all run together (has more nudity here such as a shower scene), a death metal music video and the trailer. The music video is Gorgatron - Inner Supremacy. Unless there's hidden Easter eggs I don't know about, that's what you get on disc with the feature film. There is no actual movie commentary for those interested in such and as one would expect from a film like this, no subtitles and no audio options.

This is not a good movie, it's a fun movie. It's a b-film that tries to be so bad it's great. Some b-films are bottom of the barrel crap and some are a real treat to see. This is the kind that's a treat. HINT: as of the time of writing this review, Amazon Prime let's you see this film at no cost, if owning it is not important or if you refuse to buy a film in a letterbox format. And because Amazon Prime movie service is so terrible for the fact it crops the video streamed to you (cuts off part of the top/bottom & left/right of video), watching it that way will fill the screen top to bottom and nearly left to right.

I'd double dip for a low cost blu-ray of this if letterbox format was done away with that does not take away from what appears on screen. I'd even pay a few dollars more for such if it they added some things worthwhile to have and/or see to make it worthwhile to double dip at a higher cost.

P.S.
For a reason unknown to me, this film is called 4 MILFs vs. Zombies on the dvd art, unlike what you see pictured currently here at Amazon and from what you see in the opening of the film. It's a minor thing that's not really important (unless OCD is driving you nuts). I'm just curious why? Maybe the making of will explain this.

P.P.S.
The audio in this movie jumps high many times throughout. If you have thin walls & sensitive neighbors or just sensitive hearing, having this at normal volume will jump to near blow your tv speakers volume with some of the screams and yelling voices. Some sound effects jump in volume at times as well. This could be a pro for some people, making it more fun to watch and a problem for others. I felt it was important to point this out.",1502236800,,4356,4.252415458937198

There are moments that it starts to improve but never consummates that task.  But the humor and splatter live up to Troma and Lloyd Kaufman standard.  (Which are low to nonexistent.)
