7977580,4,B00007KK1I,"This is an enjoyable love-triangle comedy, where the men start by rivaling each other over the woman but then discover that they are incomplete without each other and the woman. Excellent casting and acting. Seeing Huppert (in a minor role) is an extra bonus.",1337731200,,259,4.909090909090909
7977581,4,B00007KK1I,"Released in 1972, this movie is a classic period piece of French cinema.  Fascinated with the concept of ""menage a trois"", the three main characters Cesar (Yves Montand), Rosalie (Romy Schneider), and David (Sami Frey) are interestedly developed and acted perfectly as members of a love triangle.  The french male-female dynamic on the eve of ""women's lib"" gives another interesting twist to the movie.  It goes beyond the ""wimsey"" of the movie ""Jules et Jim"". I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in exploring French cinema.",1279238400,,539,5.172413793103448
7977582,4,B00007KK1I,"Cesar et Rosalie is from the days when Claude Sautet still set his films in a wider world before retreating into chamber pieces set in enclosed universes (the bookshop of Un Mauvais Fils, the apartment of Nelly et Monsieur Annaud, the hotel room and junkyard of Max et les Ferraleurs). Here he's still embracing a wider canvas of characters and everyday locations, with a strong visual sense of location (the long grass of a field is beautiful), and it gives this romantic trifle a breath of fresh air and life that the material doesn't always deserve. But what really makes the film work is Yves Montand's outstanding performance, one of his very best, turning what could easily have been a larger than life stereotype into something flesh and blood and all too believable as everything he tries to prevent lover Romy Schneider (also excellent here) from returning of Sami Frey only drives her into his arms. There's a real vulnerability beneath the bravado: his reactions in the scene where Frey casually tells him he still loves Schneider are an amazing mix of conflicting emotions he can't quite hide.

The film paints itself into a corner by the end, with a particularly unsatisfying conclusion that would probably have worked a little better had the film ended a minute earlier, but it's still a surprisingly vital little movie.

The Region 1 NTSC DVD offers an acceptable but not outstanding widescreen transfer. The only extras are trailers for The Last Metro, Stolen Kisses and Z.",1200614400,2,1489,4.904761904761905
7977583,5,B00007KK1I,"Subtle and engrossing - and unequivocally French - this movie explores a menage a trois and its effects on the three involved. Rosalie (Romy Schneider) is loved by two men: Cesar (Yves Montand), a scrap metal tycoon, loud and brash, and conceited; and David (Sami Frey), quiet and reserved and detached. As the movie begins Rosalie and Cesar are living together; divorced now, Rosalie has a young child. Before that marriage she was the lover of David. When David comes back onto the scene after a five-year absence, Cesar becomes insanely jealous - to the point, ironically, of actually driving Rosalie and David together. But Cesar is a pursuer, the agressor, where David tends to walk away. Thus Cesar wins Rosalie back, but her thoughts are still with David. Desperate now, Cesar goes to David and begs him to come home with him to be with Rosalie. The two men end up becoming the best of friends - and Rosalie leaves them both! The script is strong and very clever, and the acting by all three principals is superb. Rosalie's never flinching honesty, which eliminates any guilt for her, is wonderful. A very well constructed and acted movie.",1145750400,4,1146,4.792929292929293
7977584,5,B00007KK1I,"Claude Sautet is one of the lesser known French directors in the United States, but he made a number of wonderful dramas about romantic relationships that are hard to find on DVD (two of his last films found an audience in the U.S.--Un Coeur en Hiver and Nelly and Monsieur Arnaud). Cesar and Rosalie is one of his best with memorable performances by Yves Montand, Sami Frey, and the extraordinary Romy Schneider. The love triangle in this film is unpredicatable and touching. Another Sautet film that should be released is Vincent Francois Paul and the Others, which is a  melancholy ode to love and friendship.",1066003200,11,612,4.828571428571428
