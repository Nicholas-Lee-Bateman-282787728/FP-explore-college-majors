Dance off the inches Belly Dance has to offer:

Belly Dancing - very little
Bollywood - alot
regular arobic dance moves - some
FUN - YES
Good instruction - mostly
Workout - mild

Much better than the other Dance Off videos I have tried. This is just a workout, not dance instruction.",1238284800,5,338,4.333333333333333
3104031,3,B0013D8M30,"As someone who does do Middle Eastern dance, this DVD kinda irritated me. It was a good workout but the moves are sometimes un-natural and not at all like bellydance. However the purpose of this DVD is to help you burn calories, not learn how to bellydance. I would suggest instead : belly dance cardio, or bellydance with jillina.",1237248000,,331,4.627118644067797
3104032,2,B0013D8M30,"I love Bollywood dancing, I love bellydancing, I love hip hop dancing, I love dancing workout videos. I did not love this one, I didn't even like it. First of all i don't consider ""the Pony"" a bellydance move. I found the instructor to be extremely annoying. I found it really hard to get into the dance. Like the title says I really wish I could get my money back on this one because I shelled out 9.99 for it and it was not worth it!",1235260800,2,435,4.069767441860465
3104033,5,B0013D8M30,"I own many DVD's and found this one as one of my favorites.  Kili, the instructor, is very fun and down to earth, and the moves--well, I just want to keep doing them all day!  I sweat like the dickens, and the dances flows together fabulously.  I could do this one 100 times and never be bored or not get a good workout.  Get this one, you are going to love it!  Remember in dance it takes awhile to get the moves down so that you can really get into the groove-but it's well worth it and this one isn't hard to get down at all.",1231286400,3,528,3.943396226415094
3104034,4,B0013D8M30,"I like that it's belly dancing with a little twist. You don't get it right off the back, it's a video you have to work at. The step by step guide is good, a couple moves she's fast on, but most of them she breaks down enough to learn easily. I also like that there aren't too many moves to learn. Once you get the video though it's a little fast. I find it hard to keep up sometimes, but I still want to learn it. If I'm dancing and I keep trying to do something, I tend to forget that I'm working out. So I don't get bored.",1229212800,4,524,3.81651376146789
3104035,4,B0013D8M30,An excellent workout for the midsection of your body. It is especially good for the abs. It isn't too hard but may not be for the intermediate exerciser.,1219363200,5,153,4.5
3104036,5,B0013D8M30,"First, I must point out that the title of this is misleading.  Let's blame the title-maker.  However, the description on the workout DVD cover is honest in that it mentions the workout is bellydance-inspired and features some Bollywood & aerobic dance moves.  This is accurate.  Unfortunately those who gave it bad online reviews seemed really focused on the title & felt it would be a true bellydance workout.  Then, again there's very little bellydancing in the clip.  Thus, many were disappointed when it wasn't solid bellydancing.  So, I'm reviewing this based on the descriptions (more important than a title) and my own experience.  First, my background to give you some perspective.  I am at the advanced level in my fitness, am quite fit, can handle heavy weights, do high impact work regularly & swing a 20 lb kettle bell.  I bought this specifically for those days when I need a less intense, low impact workout or a rest day.  This was perfect.  The music is great, Kili's instruction is flawless (to me), the creativity was up there and the combos seemed to get harder in intensity.  In fact, while working out in my chilly living room, my sports bra & undies were soaked.  I was stunned.  My wish is that folks really pay attn to the descriptions & the clip instead of the title.  If you're looking for an Eastern-inspired workout, this one is good.  I actually like this one better than the other pure bellydance fitness and Bollywood DVDs I've had and given away.  The only thing I would've loved to have seen is if Kili had woven all 3 combos together at the end & ran through them a couple of times.  That would've been an exercise for the mind!  This workout served its purpose with me.",1215475200,37,1704,4.635451505016722
3104037,5,B0013D8M30,"I love this workout. This is not a hardcore workout like Taebo, Firm or Cathe. It is what it is.
 Very well put together light workout. Great for those just starting out, or just getting back into workout from illness.
  Very low impact & fun. Great for the days you don't want to take it all the way. If you liked the Hip Hop Dance of the inches I think you will like this one also.",1211932800,12,383,4.0131578947368425
3104038,5,B0013D8M30,"This is a perfectly timed workout (45 minutes all up) and it really gets your heart rate up.  It's different to any other workout I own because it's a mix of belly dancing and Bollywood style dance.  There is your basic ponies and grapvines, to sunbursts and shimmies.  It's the first workout I've seen by this instructor, Kili Marti, but I found her to be friendly, and gave good instruction.  The music is also what gives it perfect 'atmosphere' because it's Middle-Eastern so you feel very intune to the moves.
This isn't the kind of workout you'd want to solely rely on for big weight-loss, but it's fun and does get your heart rate up, so it's going to help you get fit and you'll definately have fun doing it.",1209772800,30,715,4.476923076923077
3104039,2,B0013D8M30,"I was able to get a copy of this early & I have to say it is by far one of the worst workouts I've got in my collection. The title of this is very misleading. There is nothing to very little belly dance about it. Yes, the back cover says it is a fusion of bollywood style dancing & bellydance, but in truth it is all bollywood with maybe a few undulations thrown in. It's a very boring routine to boot. I wouldn't even rate it at a beginner level for intensity. It's not very challenging & is not likely to get your heartrate up. The back cover specifically says this is a fun workout. I kept wondering when the fun would begin. Ugh. I gave this 2 stars, 1 star for each good thing to mention. The music is good. Very original compared to many other fitness DVDs on the market. The instructor is really good. I like her personality & she cues very well. It's unfortunate that she appeared in such a bad workout. If you like bollywood dancing & don't want to do much of a workout this is for you. If you want to actually make use of your workout time, and you want a bellydance workout that is ACTUALLY a bellydance workout or a true fusion of bellydance & bollywood, this is one to avoid.",1204934400,33,1188,4.147186147186147
3104040,3,B0013D8M30,"I picked up this dvd at a local store after checking the reviews online on my phone. I was hoping for a cardio workout that used belly dance techniques while providing a workout that keeps your feet on the floor -- not bouncing around. I have bursitis and wear orthotics, and simply cannot bounce about without damaging my feet further.

Before I looked at the routines, I viewed the section that breaks down the moves. There is a lot of stepping and hopping. I then viewed the exercise section. More of the same. Even the warm-up involve bouncing around. It's not something I can use.

Pros: the instructor is very clear and easy to follow, and the workouts look like they might be fun.

Cons: the title is misleading. This is NOT a ""belly dance workout"". Also -- a personal ""con"", having nothing to do with the quality of the dvd -- there's a group of back-up dancers. I suppose it is meant to give the viewer the feeling of being in a class. I dislike it.

I'm going to stick with ""Sadie's Complete Bellydance Guide"".",1359331200,,1020,4.467741935483871
3104041,5,B0013D8M30,i came across this dvd while looking for a line dancing workout. I ordered this one along with the Dance off the Inches Line Dance. This one is better. She keeps you engaged and having fun the whole time.,1345593600,,204,4.256410256410256
3104042,4,B0013D8M30,"I like the fast pace of the routines and the fact that there is a separate section to learn the steps.  My only problem was with ""the twist"".  It killed my knees.  Luckily, I stopped myself early and just improvised through those steps.  Otherwise, I like the workout.  This is not a true bellydance dvd, rather more of an aerobic form of bollywood style.  I do zumba on a regular basis and was looking for something to keep things fresh for me.",1337040000,,445,4.365853658536586
3104043,5,B0013D8M30,The video (without the step guide) takes about 45 minutes. The steps are easy to learn and very entertaining. The steps itself is very unique and fun once you learn them.,1336176000,,170,4.516129032258065
3104044,5,B0013D8M30,"I really like this DVD.  I've got several workout DVD's in my rotation from Yoga inspired to Aerobic dance and now the belly-dance inspired workout.  I notice that the only really poor reviews of this product are from bellydance ""purists"".  Speaking for myself personally, I was looking for a good core workout that didn't require a ton of situps and doesn't place a lot of strain on my arms (since I tore my rotator cuff about a year ago it's been extremely hard to do upper-body and core work that requires a lot of arm usage).  Anyway I can feel my core working in this video and it's fun, energetic, and different.  If you're not fixated on whether or not this is ""true"" bellydance (which I presume most people are not going to be), I think you'll enjoy this as a change of pace.  Above all, it's a good (if somewhat complicated) cardio workout.  I can tell it will take a few tries to get all the way through it well, but that's true of most fitness routines anyway.",1331424000,,971,4.391061452513966
3104045,4,B0013D8M30,"Like a a lot of other reviewers I would like to emphasize that this is not an instructional DVD in authentic Belly Dance. This is a fun aerobic/dance DVD based loosely on Bollywood moves and a few Belly Dance moves. That being said, it gets me sweating (a lot) every time I do it. If you do the moves properly you should get much more than a 'light' workout. I regularly run 3 miles, do Zumba, Kettlebell workouts, and other dance DVDs and really find this one to be very effective in a fun way. I do think, however, that they should have titled it more accurately and could have used more authentic music (like real Bollywood or Belly Dance music), as to me, the music sounded like a cheesy impersonation of 'Eastern' music. Overall, a good workout though.",1330128000,,757,4.453237410071942
3104046,1,B0013D8M30,"So dissapointing when instructors try to piggy back on trends.
She calls it Belly Dance inspired Bollywood fusion. All nonsense.
It's not bollywood, it's not belly dance. It's ""something"" crammed in for aerobics.
I am not a Bollywood expert, so I don't know if you can call this bollywood at all.
But I am an expert both in belly dance and fitness instruction.
While it may be a good heart-pumping workout, if you are wishing to dance or even slightly belly dance, please do not pick this one up.
Otherwise, clear instruction, pretty motivating personality and good amount of variety and fast movements are available for the workout enthusiast - not the belly dancer or an intermediae dancer...
Deserves 1 star due to the absolute misleading title.",1313366400,2,748,4.897637795275591
3104047,5,B0013D8M30,"This title of this is deceiving.  It is a dance designed to work your belly, but it is not belly dancing.  This is a fun workout.",1311724800,,129,3.923076923076923
3104048,5,B0013D8M30,"This is a very fun workout, great music, and a fabulous instructor.  I did this one first time through without using the tutorial.  The second time through had the moves down.  Once you know it you can really get into it and work up a sweat.

I haven't tried any traditional belly dance dvd's so the Bollywood factor didn't bother me.

Love the Middle Eastern music so it was easy for me to get into it and enjoy the workout.

Nice change from traditional cardio workouts.  Nothing hard core, but very fun!

I have the Dance off the Inches Hip Hop workouts and enjoy them as well.",1297209600,,580,4.355140186915888
3104049,1,B0013D8M30,"The routines in this video have not anything to do with belly dance!
In my opinion you can't call it ""dance"" at all.
The instructor is only hopping around, all moves are very fast,
in my opinion, it is simply a normal, boring aerobic / fitness workout.",1287273600,6,252,4.382978723404255
3104050,1,B0013D8M30,"First of all I've never seen anyone sucessfully belly dance in sneakers - this is a crappy DVD, I wish I'd have kept the packaging to send it back-  this is the worst DVD I think I've ever wasted money on.",1282435200,4,205,4.0
3104051,5,B0013D8M30,I finally started working out with my Dance Off the Inches: Fat Burning Belly Dance tape. Wanted something different than the usual treadmill. I can honestly say I sweated MORE than when I run on the treadmill with this DVD. OMG the intensity is great and I love to dance so I like the fluidity of the moves and the transitions from one step to another. The instructor is great. Only about 2 moves I didn't get off the bat but I will get them over time. I am now committed to doing this twice a week and get off the boring treadmill. I loved it!  Would reccommend it if you love to dance and work up a good sweat!,1273708800,,613,4.108333333333333
3104052,5,B0013D8M30,"This is such a fun workout. I love it! I like to keep different types of dance DVDs in my collection to keep things fresh and fun, so I want to keep exercising. This one is definitely a good one to have in the mix. The steps are not too challenging but challenging enough to keep things interesting. This DVD is not as high cardio as some of my others, so I like to use it when I am tired, or not feeling up to a super intense workout, or just when I feel like belly dancing. There is a step guide, which is always helpful and Kili Marti is a good teacher. I highly recommend this workout.",1271289600,,589,4.0
3104053,5,B0013D8M30,This video is great for toning.  It will definitely work your core.  It also teaches you fundamentals of belly dancing.  Great for a sexy workout!!!!,1267056000,,149,4.88
3104054,5,B0013D8M30,I have done this workout over and over again.  It was so much fun.  It works your entire lower body.  Your tighten and tone your mid section while burning calories.  It makes you feel super feminine.,1252281600,,199,4.444444444444445
3104055,5,B0013D8M30,"Having never tried belly dancing before, I have to say this dvd relieved any fears I may have had.  Yes, I am not the most co-ordinated person in the world, but instructor / Dancer Kili Marti, gives a very helpful tutorial on how to do each step that we would be doing, so I had a, ""heads-up"" on what was coming.  Kili was exuberant and playful, and yet she put me through a great workout where I was pretty sweaty when done.  She's really good at queuing, and she breaks this dvd down into 3 dances after the initial warm up: Belly moves groove, Cleopatra Cardio Combo ( which I have to say is my absolute favorite ) and Hip Roll Hindi Combo, then of course there is the cool down.  Doing this dvd made me feel more feminine and kinda sexy, cause I was swaying my hips and moving my arms sinuously and just forgetting that I was actually doing a workout dvd.  I think this is a great intro to belly dancing ( though if you're looking for an authentic form / study of belly dancing, this probably isn't what you're looking for, as this is more an aerobic / cardio workout. ) and has made me want to explore more of this fun, sensual way of dancing / working out.  Approx. 45 minutes total dvd.",1249603200,2,1193,4.2105263157894735
3104056,4,B0013D8M30,"This DVD is perfect for my inner dancer! I can't dance AT ALL, but I love trying, and this workout lets me unleash my dancing spirit while allowing me to get a good workout at the same time. I love the step guide because it permits me to become comfortable with the dance moves before trying the workout routines (very important for someone as uncoordinated as I am!). And Kili Marti is a wonderful instructor--encouraging me to let go and have fun as I work through the video. This workout is perfect as something a little different to spice up my exercise routine.",1244419200,3,566,4.504854368932039
3104057,5,B0013D8M30,"I really love this workout video. The moves are fun and make me feel feminine. I also get a great workout. Now that I know the dances, I go through the whole video doing the moves over and over again, even in the beginning when she is teaching them step by step. Just keep moving. When you're ready, carrying dumbells while dancing really intensifies the workout!!",1242345600,2,364,4.53030303030303
3104058,4,B0013D8M30,"While it seems like a fun workout...half the time I was trying to figure out what she was doing instead of actually doing the moves myself...they just don't seem natural to me at all...I'm a bellydancer, and that's kind of why I was attracted to this dvd(though I knew when I got it, it wasn't a bellydance dvd) It's definetely something you have to work up to. I just wish she would have broke some more stuff down...because she does more than just the ""10 dance moves"" that you learn, and it can get confusing at times...sorry, but I want to have FUN while exercising...not trying to figure out what she's doing half the time. She could have started off slower, than worked up to the speed. If you get it, I would recommend watching the video...definitely learning the ""10"" moves before trying it out...watching the actual exercise area...and just kind of figuring out what you need to, then try the whole video through.",1241740800,3,922,4.628048780487805
3104059,5,B0013D8M30,"While it is certainly true that this workout is not pure bollywood or belly dance I think it has just enough of a hint of each to keep things exciting.  With the help of the step guide, this workout strikes a nice balance between holding my attention and getting my heart rate up.  There is enough cuing to keep you from tripping over your feet or from stopping to see where on earth the team is.  The instructor is a little silly at times but smiles a lot and the whole team is likable.  This is an especially fun workout if you are pretty sure is no one is going to walk in on you doing it (because, you will probably look silly as well).",1238889600,,640,4.096

I'm going to stick with ""Sadie's Complete Bellydance Guide"".",1359331200,,1020,4.467741935483871
3338538,5,B0013D8M30,i came across this dvd while looking for a line dancing workout. I ordered this one along with the Dance off the Inches Line Dance. This one is better. She keeps you engaged and having fun the whole time.,1345593600,,204,4.256410256410256
3338539,4,B0013D8M30,"I like the fast pace of the routines and the fact that there is a separate section to learn the steps.  My only problem was with ""the twist"".  It killed my knees.  Luckily, I stopped myself early and just improvised through those steps.  Otherwise, I like the workout.  This is not a true bellydance dvd, rather more of an aerobic form of bollywood style.  I do zumba on a regular basis and was looking for something to keep things fresh for me.",1337040000,,445,4.365853658536586
3338540,5,B0013D8M30,The video (without the step guide) takes about 45 minutes. The steps are easy to learn and very entertaining. The steps itself is very unique and fun once you learn them.,1336176000,,170,4.516129032258065
3338541,5,B0013D8M30,"I really like this DVD.  I've got several workout DVD's in my rotation from Yoga inspired to Aerobic dance and now the belly-dance inspired workout.  I notice that the only really poor reviews of this product are from bellydance ""purists"".  Speaking for myself personally, I was looking for a good core workout that didn't require a ton of situps and doesn't place a lot of strain on my arms (since I tore my rotator cuff about a year ago it's been extremely hard to do upper-body and core work that requires a lot of arm usage).  Anyway I can feel my core working in this video and it's fun, energetic, and different.  If you're not fixated on whether or not this is ""true"" bellydance (which I presume most people are not going to be), I think you'll enjoy this as a change of pace.  Above all, it's a good (if somewhat complicated) cardio workout.  I can tell it will take a few tries to get all the way through it well, but that's true of most fitness routines anyway.",1331424000,,971,4.391061452513966
3338542,4,B0013D8M30,"Like a a lot of other reviewers I would like to emphasize that this is not an instructional DVD in authentic Belly Dance. This is a fun aerobic/dance DVD based loosely on Bollywood moves and a few Belly Dance moves. That being said, it gets me sweating (a lot) every time I do it. If you do the moves properly you should get much more than a 'light' workout. I regularly run 3 miles, do Zumba, Kettlebell workouts, and other dance DVDs and really find this one to be very effective in a fun way. I do think, however, that they should have titled it more accurately and could have used more authentic music (like real Bollywood or Belly Dance music), as to me, the music sounded like a cheesy impersonation of 'Eastern' music. Overall, a good workout though.",1330128000,,757,4.453237410071942
3338543,1,B0013D8M30,"So dissapointing when instructors try to piggy back on trends.
She calls it Belly Dance inspired Bollywood fusion. All nonsense.
It's not bollywood, it's not belly dance. It's ""something"" crammed in for aerobics.
I am not a Bollywood expert, so I don't know if you can call this bollywood at all.
But I am an expert both in belly dance and fitness instruction.
While it may be a good heart-pumping workout, if you are wishing to dance or even slightly belly dance, please do not pick this one up.
Otherwise, clear instruction, pretty motivating personality and good amount of variety and fast movements are available for the workout enthusiast - not the belly dancer or an intermediae dancer...

3338545,5,B0013D8M30,"This is a very fun workout, great music, and a fabulous instructor.  I did this one first time through without using the tutorial.  The second time through had the moves down.  Once you know it you can really get into it and work up a sweat.

I haven't tried any traditional belly dance dvd's so the Bollywood factor didn't bother me.

Love the Middle Eastern music so it was easy for me to get into it and enjoy the workout.

Nice change from traditional cardio workouts.  Nothing hard core, but very fun!

I have the Dance off the Inches Hip Hop workouts and enjoy them as well.",1297209600,,580,4.355140186915888

In my opinion you can't call it ""dance"" at all.

in my opinion, it is simply a normal, boring aerobic / fitness workout.",1287273600,6,252,4.382978723404255

3338548,5,B0013D8M30,I finally started working out with my Dance Off the Inches: Fat Burning Belly Dance tape. Wanted something different than the usual treadmill. I can honestly say I sweated MORE than when I run on the treadmill with this DVD. OMG the intensity is great and I love to dance so I like the fluidity of the moves and the transitions from one step to another. The instructor is great. Only about 2 moves I didn't get off the bat but I will get them over time. I am now committed to doing this twice a week and get off the boring treadmill. I loved it!  Would reccommend it if you love to dance and work up a good sweat!,1273708800,,613,4.108333333333333
3338549,5,B0013D8M30,"This is such a fun workout. I love it! I like to keep different types of dance DVDs in my collection to keep things fresh and fun, so I want to keep exercising. This one is definitely a good one to have in the mix. The steps are not too challenging but challenging enough to keep things interesting. This DVD is not as high cardio as some of my others, so I like to use it when I am tired, or not feeling up to a super intense workout, or just when I feel like belly dancing. There is a step guide, which is always helpful and Kili Marti is a good teacher. I highly recommend this workout.",1271289600,,589,4.0

3338551,5,B0013D8M30,I have done this workout over and over again.  It was so much fun.  It works your entire lower body.  Your tighten and tone your mid section while burning calories.  It makes you feel super feminine.,1252281600,,199,4.444444444444445
3338552,5,B0013D8M30,"Having never tried belly dancing before, I have to say this dvd relieved any fears I may have had.  Yes, I am not the most co-ordinated person in the world, but instructor / Dancer Kili Marti, gives a very helpful tutorial on how to do each step that we would be doing, so I had a, ""heads-up"" on what was coming.  Kili was exuberant and playful, and yet she put me through a great workout where I was pretty sweaty when done.  She's really good at queuing, and she breaks this dvd down into 3 dances after the initial warm up: Belly moves groove, Cleopatra Cardio Combo ( which I have to say is my absolute favorite ) and Hip Roll Hindi Combo, then of course there is the cool down.  Doing this dvd made me feel more feminine and kinda sexy, cause I was swaying my hips and moving my arms sinuously and just forgetting that I was actually doing a workout dvd.  I think this is a great intro to belly dancing ( though if you're looking for an authentic form / study of belly dancing, this probably isn't what you're looking for, as this is more an aerobic / cardio workout. ) and has made me want to explore more of this fun, sensual way of dancing / working out.

I can't dance AT ALL, but I love trying, and this workout lets me unleash my dancing spirit while allowing me to get a good workout at the same time. I love the step guide because it permits me to become comfortable with the dance moves before trying the workout routines (very important for someone as uncoordinated as I am!). And Kili Marti is a wonderful instructor--encouraging me to let go and have fun as I work through the video.

When you're ready, carrying dumbells while dancing really intensifies the workout!!",1242345600,2,364,4.53030303030303
3338555,4,B0013D8M30,"While it seems like a fun workout...half the time I was trying to figure out what she was doing instead of actually doing the moves myself...they just don't seem natural to me at all...I'm a bellydancer, and that's kind of why I was attracted to this dvd(though I knew when I got it, it wasn't a bellydance dvd) It's definetely something you have to work up to. I just wish she would have broke some more stuff down...because she does more than just the ""10 dance moves"" that you learn, and it can get confusing at times...sorry, but I want to have FUN while exercising...not trying to figure out what she's doing half the time. She could have started off slower, than worked up to the speed. If you get it, I would recommend watching the video...definitely learning the ""10"" moves before trying it out...watching the actual exercise area...and just kind of figuring out what you need to, then try the whole video through.",1241740800,3,922,4.628048780487805

With the help of the step guide, this workout strikes a nice balance between holding my attention and getting my heart rate up.  There is enough cuing to keep you from tripping over your feet or from stopping to see where on earth the team is.  The instructor is a little silly at times but smiles a lot and the whole team is likable.  This is an especially fun workout if you are pretty sure is no one is going to walk in on you doing it (because, you will probably look silly as well).",1238889600,,640,4.096

There is step by step instructions to learn the moves. This is great for me as I have two left feet when it comes to dancing. I like to try but I don't know what I am doing. I can learn the moves before I attempt the routine. The video features a 45 minute belly dancing routine. I must say someone of my size trying to do a belly dance looks rather funny. I only do it alone when no one is around to laugh at me.

They are both enjoyable, although my heart rate was barely in the training range doing them.  They were fun. That being said, if you are looking to learn to belly dance these are NOT the workouts for you.  She does not break down and teach the moves. For example, a snake arm is shown as a simple wave with no instruction.  Moves are shown and repeated several times before a quicker version is done.  There is no technique, and these are not even basic belly dance moves.  If you don't know how to do a shimmy, good luck!!!!",1403136000,,670,4.2362204724409445

It does take a couple tries to get the moves down, but once you've learned them it's a breeze and so enjoyable - I've been using it for several years now and am still not tired of it.
