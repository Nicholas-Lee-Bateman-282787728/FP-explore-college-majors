8116254,1,B000F0UTTC,Songs on DVD are not really anything exciting.  I think they could have done a much better job selecting better songs!,1419811200,,118,4.619047619047619
8116255,4,B000F0UTTC,"This music compilation is a little :harder"" than what I expected.
I was hoping for more subdued performances.
Worth a look, though.",1399420800,,131,5.0
8116256,4,B000F0UTTC,This Was an okay movie. it had some good artist. butt all in all it was okay. this is one of those movies that you watch if nothing else is on i'd rather listen to the cd instead. if you have not watched this movie then i recommend you do/or don't,1348704000,,247,3.8627450980392157
8116257,5,B000F0UTTC,"Excellent DVD, great lineup and great video and sound. A real nice cross-section of performers. Highlights include Gov't Mule, Eisley, Decemberists, Widespread Panic, and many, many more. Thanks for all the hard work.",1333238400,,217,5.606060606060606
8116258,5,B000F0UTTC,"This probably does not do justice to these events.  But ... it is as close as maybe.  Good musicians, one heck of a lot more comfortable than being there.",1288051200,,154,4.275862068965517
8116259,2,B000F0UTTC,Lot's of samplers from startup bands. Mostly daytime (small unknown bands). Disjointed concert DVD. The Bonus disk is a joke. Get Austin City 2004 instead.,1268870400,,155,5.24
8116260,4,B000F0UTTC,"People always complain that their favorite artists aren't on the ACL Fest DVDs, but this set has a great selection of songs and artists.  (Hey, if you want to see Coldplay you can turn on MTV).  Disc 1 opens with a riveting Jet performance.  Other good performances include The Bravery, The Decemberists, Bloc Party, and Rachael Yamagata.  A bit heavy on the British artists, though.

My only complaint is that the DVDs don't capture the essence of ACL Fest other than a few time-captures and interviews on the second set.  Perhaps the producers wanted to hide all evidence of the incredible heat this past year (108 in the shade) and the dust storm.  But in a lot of ways I think this makes it cool -- the crowds hung with it despite the horrible conditions.

Bottom line - a great music DVD",1154908800,4,792,4.528169014084507
