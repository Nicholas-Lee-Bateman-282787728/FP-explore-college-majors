WHAT THE RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!Wish I could get my damn money back...DOT NOT BUY OR RENT THIS TRASH .U would disappointed BIG TIME!!!If u want to buy real ""STEVE-O DVD's""...buy the( BOX SET of STEVE-O), comes out  FEB/2006",1118707200,24,513,4.457446808510638
2247833,1,B0007X9U9M,"this is a bad dvd.  steve-o isn't even in half of it.  its like some jackasses got the rights to steve-o's name and some steve-o footage and put themselves into it calling them steve-o's buddies.  the only good steve-o video in this dvd is in his other 3 dvds, which are funny.  the douche bags doing the prank aren't funny, its kinda like candid camera.  DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!",1118102400,23,377,4.328571428571428
2247834,1,B0007X9U9M,"This is by far the most dissapointing video I have seen in years. It was a complete waste of money. Don't get me wrong. I am a fan of Steve-O's stuff and know the types of things that he normally does, but this just plain sucked. This video has a Steve-O interview which die hard fans may enjoy and a collection of stunts that look like they were pre-Jackass, but the rest of the disk is pranks done by a different group of morons. (these guys are NOT funny!!!) The bonus disk isn't worth watching either. It's basically drunks entering a booth and acting like idiots and stripping. Lame and Boring. Again, If you are a die hard fan of Steve-O's work, you may like the segments with his name in it, but don't bother with the rest.",1117670400,20,730,4.297101449275362
2247835,5,B0007X9U9M,This movie is awesome!  I've never seen it but I didn't know why they let people write reviews before the movie is out.  The other ones were quasi funny anyway.,1114732800,4,160,4.3

8053209,1,B0007X9U9M,"Really has nothing to do with Steve-o, just has his name tacked on it",1481068800,,69,4.0
8053210,5,B0007X9U9M,Pretty good DVD.  The great part is the bonus DVD with hidden cam footage in one of those photography booths.,1398902400,,109,4.45
8053211,3,B0007X9U9M,"I love the Jackass guys. All of them. But Steve-o has always been one of my favorites. This was.... Not my favorite Steve-o by any stretch of the means. It's a lot of the same stuff, and a lot of it isn't stunts or anything like that. I can't say no one would want to see it, but straight guys be warned. Balls and all are shown, and a LOT. Some stuff is funny, but most of it is just..... Stuff you wanna skip to the next chapter of the DVD. If you are the biggest Steve-o fan or you are in love with him and wanna see his goods up close, then this is FOR YOU.",1363737600,3,561,3.8034188034188032
8053212,5,B0007X9U9M,I got my dvd in less time than I thought. had no problem with the dvd. has great prices. I will order again,1340496000,,107,3.6956521739130435
8053213,2,B0007X9U9M,I Was Disapointed In This One. There Wasnt Much Steve In This Dvd. But The Parts He Was In Where Great. If Your A HardCore Steve O Fan You Should Have It.,1317081600,,154,3.84375
8053214,1,B0007X9U9M,"Do not buy this vid, rent it if you absolutely positively want to say you have seen ""everything Steve-O"".  I was reluctant to even give it a single star because there was nothing lower than that.

Remember the old ""don't send in your submissions because we won't open them"" blurb at the beginning of Jackass?  It's there for a reason, to spare the audience from having to see fannish material on this level.  Most of this backyard produced looking stuff would have been better off on YouTube or Brickfist had those sites been around when this vid came out.

You get about 15 minutes tops of very early Steve-O material and the rest of it is filler.",1186790400,3,648,4.504273504273504
8053215,1,B0007X9U9M,"To the people who bought this, sucks to be you.

Steve-O did NOT put his name on this, and has absolutely nothing to do with this DVD. Do not buy it.",1157241600,8,149,3.806451612903226
8053216,1,B0007X9U9M,"Okay, first. I am not one of those people on here that goes around reviewing every cd by a band I don't like just to say that they are a bad band, so although I don't really like the Steve-O DVDs that much, I don't sit around writing reviews about how horrible they are (they aren't horrible, but tons of people wrote reviews saying stuff like that.) I am merly writing this review to warn people and help people save some money and not get angry. This is the worst DVD ever, this is worse than The Adventures of Pluto Nash (it could have tied with Pluto Nash as the worst video ever, except you expect a funny video of Steve-O, if it was called ""Random Guys That Wish They Were Steve-O"" you wouldn't expect greatness and it wouldn't seem as bad)

THIS VIDEO IS LACKING IN STEVE-O. I think you can't say a DVD is by Steve-O when he doesn't approve it and more than 80% of the footage is of other people that aren't Steve-O.

The back of this DVD says 3 in 1.

The first video: Decent, some kind of funny footage of Steve-O.

The second video: horrible, about 30 seconds of Steve-O, mainly some random guys trying to be funny.

The 3rd video: Horrible, doesn't even have 1 second of Steve-O or anyone that has anything to do with Steve-O (friends, people from jackass, etc)

As for the bonus disc: I haven't seen it because I got the normal version (not uncensored or unrated or whatever)

***ALERT***

This DVD wasn't even approved or released by Steve-O...look at the company that releases Steve-O's DVDs (J+N) and then look at the company that released this DVD.",1136505600,19,1564,4.40625
8053217,2,B0007X9U9M,"Yeah this is pretty stupid, I'd only recommend it to hardcore Steve-O fans, as there is a bit of footage I've never seen before. It might not get such bad reviews if it was produced better, the music gets quite irritating. Forget this crap and check out the National Lampoon Lost Reality series!",1120348800,16,295,4.584905660377358
