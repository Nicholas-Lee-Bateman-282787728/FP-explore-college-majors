8132362,5,B000GI3KHG,"Ken does a fantastic job in the Fingerstyle guitar book.  It starts slow and takes students through virtually all popular genres, including blues and Celtic guitar.  The DVD goes over everything, with Ken playing all the material; excellent.  One word, this course is not for absolute newcomers to the fretboard.  It moves along pretty fast, so some familiarity with the basics is needed.",1304640000,2,388,5.111111111111111
