8680138,2,B00NTDI9DU,"This DVD only has the option to watch the movie in Japanese or German so I had to try to follow the action in German. I could have enjoyed this movie with that limitation but I didn't like it anyway. The special effects were awful. The special effects looked like they were made for a video game restricted to obsolete graphic card technology. Even the digital water wasn't rendered well enough not to look fake. Seriously, I've seen amateur filmmakers on YouTube that could manage better special effects. The monster was poorly edited into digital scenes. How can you mess that up? Even the acting was bad with silly bits thrown into serious moments. I guess this shows that even the Japanese can make bad movies.",1433116800,,714,4.674603174603175
