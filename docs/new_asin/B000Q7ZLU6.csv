2833915,1,B000Q7ZLU6,I agree with some of the other writers here. If you buy this dvd you are supporting Warner Bro's and their consistant greedy bonehead decisions to constantly release these 3-4 episode per dvd items. It's ridiculous and a RIP OFF!!  YOu can get the entire seasons of the Batman for no more that 15 bucks right after the season ends..but this cartoon you get only 4 episides for the same price and its also WB. Greedy. Please do not purchase this item. Force full season sets to be released day 1. True fans..I know you agree...represent.,1179100800,44,536,4.583333333333333
2833916,1,B000Q7ZLU6,"This is a 1 for Warner but a 5 for the show.

If you are a Legion fan, you've probably already seen the show.  But if you're a Legion fan who hasn't seen this incarnation of the team- or maybe a Teen Titans fan lamenting the loss of that great show- LoSH is worth seeing.

If you liked Teen Titans in animation then the Legion provides some interesting comparisons and contrasts- both are anime-influenced with plenty of action but while the theme of Teen Titans is friendship, the theme of the Legion is heroism.  It leads to different relationships and a different feel to the show and although the characters are consistent in their actions and as well-developed as you could hope from the format, the chemistry between the characters is not quite where TT got in the first season- but there is promise in LoSH and I'm looking forward to season 2.

Despite the fact that LoSH is a kid/teen-oriented show and not part of the  ""Timmverse"" I am happy with the way the writers and producers respect the history of the Legion- and some of that is in surprising ways, including a budding romantic relationship between two characters, the death of third and an epic story that is a part of Legion lore.

Granted, on a 4 episode DVD it's unlikely that you'll see any of those moments but when Warner finally gets around to releasing the complete first season on DVD I'll enjoy watching the evolution of the team by watching the episodes in order [Kid's WB showed the episode out of sequence during the broadcast run].

In short: great content, crummy marketing.

btw- this is not, ""Legion of the Super Heroes.""  Ugh.",1179100800,34,1611,4.601398601398602
2833917,1,B000Q7ZLU6,I hate that Warner keeps doing these one disc/3 or 4 episode releases for their cartoon series first and waiting years to do full season releases. Full seasons releases are the standard now and I wish that Warner would get on board.

One does get a sense of his internal struggle, living in the shadow of the man he hasn't become yet, trying to live up to expectations of the person he will be. We like that there are a lot of characters, and allusions to even more we haven't met yet, or who are off-planet; I assume costs limit the number of characters that can speak in a given episode. Character design is pretty cool, if not quite Justice League caliber, and the storytelling is well-paced and engaging, entertaining for my son but not gory or too heavy, just your basic cartoon violence, aka stuff blowing up.

2834212,3,B000Q7ZLU6,"I love the LOSH, and the Timmverse era of animation. Although this show doesn't really connect to the other DC shows, or match their quality, its still a fun cartoon and showcases why the Legion is a great concept. The producers take a streamlined and liberal take on the characters (the main cast usually goes to 7-8, Brainiac 5 is an android), and it works to make the Legion accessible to young and old viewers. Although I like both seasons, Season 2 is a bit darker and more linear in plot while this Season has more variety in what the episodes tackle.

Its no ""Teen Titans"" (the original, not GO!) but it works right below it if you wanted to rate every DC show all the way to ""Batman TAS"". It definately works better for the younger set, but also captures the lighthearted tone of the early LOSH tales.",1473379200,,809,4.429530201342282

2834401,3,B000Q7ZLU6,"The show is okay, but I am so tired of the goofy artwork that has become popular lately.  It's not as bad as Teen Titans, but still not very enjoyable.

2834428,4,B000Q7ZLU6,"I'm a long-time Legion of Super-Heroes fan, now with two toddlers at home.  I skipped this show when it came out but now as I look for things both daddy and the babies can enjoy I picked it up.

The show is everything you could ask for.  Fun, colorful 60s style animation, space ships, aliens, monsters, lots of Easter Eggs for comic fans, straightforward stories for the kids.  My girls especially liked seeing so many female heroes, Triplicate Girl was a big hit.

There's violence but it's comic book violence, the sort of things where people are punched through buildings or hit with lightning but just walk it off. Unfortunate in some ways, but that's the nature of the genre.

Sadly Warner never made a season 1 set, you can order the 3 parts of season 1 together for $20, but no nice box and no extras.  And it looks like season 2 will never come.  It's a real shame, this series deserves a quality release.

It does alter each individual member of this team to be more acceptable to the viewers, like making Brainac 5 more machine than flesh and it does stray from its comicbook origins a lot, but in a good way making the Legion similiar to the comicbook version , but different enough to become an entirely different and new team to draw in the fanboy and causal viewer alike. Granted the version of the LSH that were portrayed on the animated Superman series were fresh as a first attempt to showcase the LSH, but the storyline only showcased three of the members primarily meanwhile JLA Unltd showcased the whole team and to me it looked like the writers etc. were testing them out in these appearances, but this version is more centered on the Legion as the main characters unlike their other appearances where they were supporting characters.

2834773,2,B000Q7ZLU6,"The plot makes no sense.  Episodes are episodic, not allowing for much character building nor climatic storytelling.  The protagonists, the Legion of Superheroes, do a lot of stupid things throughout each episode, but the most questionable of things they have done was in the beginning of the first episode: they went back in time only to get a child Superman rather than the fully matured Superman we all know and love.  It makes no sense to go back in time for Superman and choose to grab him when he's a kid rather than later in his life.  It also does not seem as though they can ever bring him back to his time, even though they say they can.  I never see time travel again in the first few episodes I've watched.  I honestly had a hard time justifying watching the whole series because of the lack of a thought out plot.

The animation quality is nothing special, but it isn't bad. It is simply more cartoon fodder for your kids.  The show's heroes are kids after all.  That said, it is oddly entertaining at times if you like to take that trip down memory lane with the DC universe.  There were a few references to old characters but Superman had no idea who they were.  This nostalgia trip was nice, but it was given in such small doses that it wasn't a redeeming quality of the show.",1454198400,,1292,4.38655462184874

2834847,3,B000Q7ZLU6,"I am really into animated shows about superheroes.  Normally, I would agree with those who are saying that a series should be released on DVD in full seasons or, at least, in larger volumes.  In this case, however, I can see the value of releasing only a few episodes at a time.  I had never seen this show when it was originally aired.  I might be interested in buying the entire series but I have to see what the show is about, first, before spending all that money.  These DVDs are a great way to ""sample"" the product before taking the plunge.  That's why I bought this DVD.

For starters, the animations are good.  They are not always realistic looking but they're pleasant to watch.  I found the character designs a little odd in that their legs all have really big calves.  It's not a big deal but it was a little distracting.  I kept trying to figure out if that was supposed to be the cut of their pants or boots or if that's just how their legs were shaped.  Anyway, the fight scenes were fun to watch and the city (New Metropolis, I think it was called) looks very interesting.

I've never been a big Superman fan.  It's not that I dislike him, I've just never found him that interesting.  Watching him, as a young man, visiting the future and learning to use his powers did make him a more sympathetic character, to me.  I always enjoy learning about new heroes and seeing characters like Lightning Lad, Saturn Girl, Brainiac 5, Phantom Girl, Triplicate Girl, Bouncing Boy, and Timberwolf was lots of fun.

I was surprised to find a special features option on this DVD.  There is a featurette where the series creators discuss the making of this series.  There's nothing spectacular about it but it's nice to have.

It's a little early for me to tell but it looks like a decent series.  I'll have to watch a few more episodes before I say for sure.",1250640000,3,1859,4.424778761061947

2834849,5,B000Q7ZLU6,"Okay, I finally took the plunge and bought this DVD. I have been holding out, like almost everyone else on these, because it angers me that Time Warner hasn't released them as season sets, and is putting them out in this four episode format to make a few extra bucks. Well, then I started thinking, ""what if they just go off the lousy sales for these four episode disks and decide that this series wasn't well liked enough to produce as season sets""! That would not be good! So, I bit the bullet and bought all three discs, which make up the complete season one. Hey, I did it for all of us, so that MAYBE WB will cough out the season set editions. I figure it's like washing my car. Right after I do wash it, it rains. So, maybe the same thing will happen now that I've bought their four episode discs. Maybe NOW they'll put the season sets out!!! Basically, I took one for the team...you can thank me when the season sets come out...LOL.

 But even though this is a great show don't buy this! You see what the DVD people are doing is reasing volumes of 4 episodes. Then they will release seasons. These will be a few dollars more expensive, but will have 13 episodes instead of 4. This is a way better deal. Then they will stop making volumes and only make seasons. So far they have released 2 volumes if they stop now you could have to rebuy 8 episodes to get all of season 1, and if they release 3 volumes you will have all but a 1 epsoad of season 1 and rebuy 12. They did the similar things for Teen Titans, The Batman, and even Batman Beyond, and expected us not to notice! So the only reason you should buy this is if you are inpatient and don't mind paying a lot.

2834852,3,B000Q7ZLU6,The best things about this DVD are the behind the scenes extras and getting to see Clark join the Legion. That's about it. The rest is just run-of-the-mill Saturday morning cartoons.,1203120000,,182,4.903225806451613
2834853,3,B000Q7ZLU6,"As a DCAU aficionado and collector of animation, I awaited the official release of the Legion of Superheroes with great interest.  The program, for those who have yet to experience it, is very well crafted under James Tucker's production.  It comes off as a slightly brighter, futurist mini-Justice League with loads of interesting character development.  The young and inexperienced Superman brings a level of relate-ability to the formula and the show's writers brilliantly use his character as the catalyst to the viewer's awe of the future.

The biggest flaw in this set comes from Warner themselves.  Rather than release a full season, Volume 1 consists of only 4 episodes on a single disc.  For $12 this really takes advantage of a great show and turns it into a moneymaking scheme.  Volume 2 is already available for pre-order for around the same price and once again contains only 4 episodes.  At this rate, the consumer is expected to purchase 3 volumes (which is close to $40) for one season!  Come on, WB, that's just wrong.

I should mention however, that Volume 1 does include a nice little bonus feature called ""We Are Legion"" that includes interviews with the shows writers and production team. It's quite an interesting little segment.

As it stands, I give the show 5 stars, this set however is a 1 star deal.",1199577600,4,1326,4.848888888888889

I love the older Legion comics, but the cartoon is a little too childish for my taste.  I find myself critiquing the changes that TV people felt they had to make in order to bring the Legion to the small screen, and it makes it hard to actually enjoy the good parts.  Why does Brainiac need to be a robot/cyborg/whatever?

Lightning Lad was killed, brought back to life and lost an arm to a space roving Moby Dick. Star Boy was already expelled for killing a man, Bouncing Boy lost his powers for the first time. Triplicate Girl was already called Duo Damsel since one of her selves was killed by Computo and people like Dream Girl, Shadow Lass, Timber Wolf and Chemical King weren't even in the Legion. The team was still housed in what looked like the bottom half of 1960s rocket ship. Bottom Line....I was hooked! I spent several years collecting all the Legion issues I had missed, finally getting Adventure 247, April 1958; the first Legion appearance - only a couple of years ago. I quit collecting when they left Adventure and moved to Action Comics around 1969. I've waited 40 years to see the Legion on TV. So kids, don't get too analytical about the show or the packaging.

2834868,3,B000Q7ZLU6,"Let's get the rating over with: 5 stars for the series, 1 star for this Volume 1 excrement (which averages to 3 stars).

Tomorrow, young Clark Kent embarks on his new job as Daily Planet copy boy in bustling Metropolis. But, for now, he's spending his last night in Smallville. Later in that evening, he's visited by time travelling youths from the 31st century. They desperately need Clark and his abilities in order to best the powerful Fatal Five. But Clark still has a ways to go before he becomes the celebrated costumed crime fighter. In fact, he's still growing into his powers (he's still shaky on the flying part). And he's certainly never heard of this Superman fella. However, after being reassured that he'll be returned to the same temporal moment as his departure, he agrees to go on the adventure. Clark Kent doesn't know it yet, but it's gonna be a long night.

In 2006, the Kids' WB line - on the CW network - opened the curtains on LEGION OF SUPERHEROES. And, with the recent drying up of animated superhero shows, this one couldn't have come at a better time. It's a point of interest that this show doesn't bear the same continuity as Bruce Timm's Batman: T.A.S., Superman: T.A.S., or the JUSTICE LEAGUE/JLU series. But it doesn't really have to. LEGION OF SUPERHEROES is a darn good show, and will thrive on its own merits. Believe me. I've seen every episode. So, if you like the four episodes here, it gets even better.

The focus early on is mostly on this version of Superman (Superboy, really), but we get enough of a spotlight on the other kids to justify the series title. The ones I've gotten to like best, besides Clark, are Phantom Girl (who must have recessive Valley Girl genes but makes very good use of her phantom powers), the robotic Brainiac (a 12th-level intellect and a devout Superman fanboy, although ""Phantoms"" reveals his cautious, practical side), and Timberwolf (bestial looking and looking cool). I do like the show's out-of-left-field choice of Bouncing Boy, whose character lends to levity. The brash Lightning Lad fills in the role of Superman's competition and critic (you know it'd be too boring if Supes got along with everyone; besides, Batman's not here). Saturn Girl, by the way, could do with a personality infusion.

With a rich, rich history to draw from (LoSH debuted in 1958), there won't be a lack of story lines to plumb here. In the villains department, the inaugural episode doesn't waste time in ushering in the fearsome Fatal Five. Other episodes included treat us to the debuts of a descendant of Lex Luthor's and of Drax, who professes to have been born in the Phantom Zone and who has a voice in his head that keeps reiterating how evil he is. Do I sense a possible change of heart sometime in the future?

This dvd also comes with a 9-minute-long ""We Are Legion"" featurette (worth watching). The four episodes are:

Episode 1 - ""Man of Tomorrow"" - To combat the Fatal Five, the Legion of Superheroes travel back in time to recruit the greatest superhero of them all. Except that the 31st century heroes land in Smallville and some time before Clark Kent puts on the cape and tights. Blink, and you'll miss Booster Gold vacuuming in the museum.

Episode 2 - ""Timber Wolf"" - The Legion responds to a distress call originating from a scientist being terrorized by a feral beast. But not all is as it appears. Surprisingly, I found this one to be pretty boring, which is strange, because I like Timberwolf.

Episode 3 - ""Legacy"" - Clark hangs out with the richest girl in the galaxy and again discovers that wearing a cape is a fashion faux pax. Meanwhile, the rest of the Legion rumbles with the Scavengers, a gang of technology thieves. Keep an eyeball peeled for a quick glimpse of Lobo (at least I think it's Lobo).

Episode 4 - ""Phantoms"" - In the Superman museum, Clark inadvertently activates the Phantom Zone projector and releases Drax, who shares Superman's abilities plus an immunity to kryptonite.

And that's it! Four measly episodes! I agree with everyone here. Absolutely, it sucks that the fans are getting a raw deal yet again. On an even more personal level, now I have to wait even longer for my favorite episode ""The Substitutes"" to come out on dvd. Dang!",1188950400,10,4242,4.681879194630873

The reason is simple, parents will pay to keep their children happy. So Kids WB knows that offering this in volume will make them more money then offering it as a full season set. Similar volume sets were offered with Justice League,Batman and Superman the animated series. Later they offered those series as box sets. A true fan of the series can risk it and wait and see if the season set will be offered in 2 years but if its not they might find that the volume sets are out of print by then.

Starring: Legion of Superheroes Rating NR

As I see above this dvd should contain the episodes,

 1. Man of Tomorrow
First aired: 9/23/2006  Production Code: 101

It is the 31st century. A group of super heroes called the Legion of Super Heroes travel back in time to recruit earth's greatest super hero, Superman, to help fight the evil of their time. While their intentions were good, good intentions don't always produce good results. Instead of bringing back Superman, they retrieve a young Clark Kent from his farm in Smallville to the future.

 2. Timber Wolf
First aired: 9/30/2006  Production Code: 102

A scientist asks the Legion to help him capture what he claims is a dangerous creature, but both the creature and the scientist have a dark secret.

 3. Legacy
First aired: 10/7/2006  Production Code: 103

Superman makes a new friend, Alexis, but his new chum soon becomes obsessive about having Superman as her only friend and not sharing him with anyone else...including the Legion.

 4. Phantoms
First aired: 11/4/2006  Production Code: 104

Superman accidentally opens a portal to a phantom dimension, unleashing a teenager with powers that match his own who eventually traps the other Legionnaires there.

The best of these in my opinion is Phantoms.
I am partial to Phantom Girl.  Of course I am also a regular
fan of the legion and have been with them since the beginning.

Although these new animated episodes are more cartoony that I would have liked...

Now, to play devils advocate; I understand the WB checking to see if this will sell as a single disc before offering it as a set. Also, as stated by others for the kiddies a single disc price is more affordable than a season.

As for myself I could get this at best buy for 25% and 30% at my favorite comics shop in Park Hills. So unless I see it here at 35% and can purchase it at that price I suppose I will ponder something... oh, that's another show.
I will probably wait and see if it goes to 35% off list or wait for the season discs.
I did after all dvd record it from the WB and they look good to me.

One thing... It does appear that there will be a few special features that if done right may prove worthy.",1184544000,3,2224,4.5465994962216625
2834877,1,B000Q7ZLU6,"The only reason Time-Warner continues to put out this one disc/three-four episodes nonsense is to snare small children, who will needle their parents into making the impulse buy. The adult fans of these shows already know to wait for the inevitable box sets. This is aimed squarely at kids, who don't have the ability to discern what a bad deal it truly is. Shame on you, Time-Warner.",1179792000,73,384,4.746268656716418
8195086,5,B000Q7ZLU6,"Our daughter loves superheroes but is easily scared by creepy images or characters that are too realistic in their evil. This series proved perfect for her, with bad guys just bad enough and vague enough that she wasn't scared of them, and great interaction between the main characters. Season one is more general, season two is more of a cohesive story that tells mostly about on Braniac 5, so I prefer season 1 and it's variety of story themes, but my daughter loves all of them. Sadly, most of the other superhero legion series are too scary for her at this time.",1511481600,,566,4.5588235294117645

8195091,4,B000Q7ZLU6,"They got the basics down, though a lot of details are wrong.  Example they don't have Cosmic boy with LL and SG for the initial pickup.  They never show the LSH origin only the interaction with Supes.  Brainiac 5 is all wrong, but they did that likely to make him more ""actionable"".  Loved the subs story toward end of the season and at least they allowed Ferro Lad to accomplish his sacrifice - though they could have kept to the storyline of the original better.  3 stars just for doing a legion work, 1 extra for getting most of it right and including a number of characters I enjoy.  Missing the 5th just because they modified things too much.  Well worth watching.  Long Live the Legion!",1485820800,,692,4.436507936507937
