8385099,5,B002ZJ1JR2,"Incredible 60s spy series:  hardboiled, cynical, and quite bitter with dashes of  real humor and considerable thematic depth. Much better writing and denser than McGoohan's excellent SECRET AGENT/DANGER MAN series. The black and white filming makes episodes seem almost documentary(noirish?) in tone, and the lower production values actually add a certain realism (no lavish James Bond sets).The writing is consistently very good and often it's as if you're watching a  stage production. Edward Woodward's acting ( BREAKER MORANT, THE EQUALIZER) takes the series to an even higher level of sophistication. And you should get the two color seasons as well. After viewing all four seasons, my wife and I felt as if we had watched an exceptional miniseries. Pretty good for a late 60s British Thames TV series. You MUST have a REGION FREE dvd player to watch this B/W set( I bought one just to watch these early shows after watching just one episodes of the color seasons.) The color seasons will play on regular dvd players.",1503187200,,1022,5.071428571428571
