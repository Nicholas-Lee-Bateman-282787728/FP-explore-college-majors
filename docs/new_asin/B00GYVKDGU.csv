8628767,5,B00GYVKDGU,"Despite being three regular members down, Su Ju still delivers a highly energetic almost 3 hour performance, with all the usual sharp dance moves and melodic vocals. Highlights of the concert are Donghae & Eunhyuks I Wanna Dance, the epic 11 minute Rockstar and Henry and EunSiHaes special stage So Cold. This concert is worth buying for these three performances alone. Disc 3 has some behind-the-scenes footage plus one hour and 45 minutes of Osaka concert highlights in which we see the return of Heechul. Even though the DVDs do not have English subtitles they are still extremely entertaining. You will enjoy watching these DVDs over and over. Its show time!",1407801600,,662,4.972972972972973
