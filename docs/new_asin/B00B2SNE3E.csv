5553248,3,B00B2SNE3E,"okay movie,good story line, no scares,.good lighting-the way you welcomed light to each scene so people can see whats going on..maybe a little more effert on the 'monster'",1504137600,,171,5.142857142857143
5553249,4,B00B2SNE3E,Very good acting and lighting. High scare factor. Not my favorite genre thus the 4 for 7.,1500681600,,89,4.294117647058823
5553250,3,B00B2SNE3E,"Oh no I did not.
Not much happening in this movie that hasn't been seen before. A bunch of punks tossing around the F bomb right and left which detracted somewhat from the movie but nothing could have saved this predictable stinker anyway. Usual gore and gratuitous sex scene and inuendo.",1499472000,2,288,4.666666666666667
5553251,4,B00B2SNE3E,"High school seniors on a field trip with their Geology teacher encounter problems that weren't described in the course summary. This is the movie description that was given. Not much to say about it, right? Well, I will add that I liked this movie. Reminds me a little of ""Descent"" except here we have a really bad creature after these kids and they don't find out til later that the teacher brought them there to help him find this creature. Do we have the usual characters? yes, the jock, the slacker, the brain Etc. This movie was better lit then most and although the kids make the customary bad decisions I still liked it. The cast was good and I really didn't hate any of them and they even seemed to care. So if this is your genre, give it a try and I think you may be pleasantly surprised. BTW, why 4 stars? I really, really hated the ending. One day someone is going to make one of theses kinds of movies and one of the boys will survive. Just sayin'.",1455235200,8,960,4.28021978021978
5553252,2,B00B2SNE3E,"I only bought this because I like Kelly Blatz and horror movies. The budget constraints really held it back, but sadly I've seen far worse scary movies out there. If you can rent it, do that instead of buying.",1442102400,,209,4.384615384615385
8561622,4,B00B2SNE3E,"This movie has fairly traditional pacing while using the familiar horror-film plot-line derived from Ten Little Indians. It does build suspense inside an already claustrophobic main location, a cave. The young actors are solid, especially the long-suffering Latina lead, and the ending puts an interesting new wrinkle on the its not over yet coda typical of the genre.",1517270400,,368,5.362068965517241
8561623,5,B00B2SNE3E,I rented this because I'm a Power Rangers fan and love Alison Macinnis.  I'm not usually a fan of scary movies but heard this was funny. And it is!! Still a bit creepy but funny. It will not disappoint.,1517097600,2,202,4.17948717948718
8561624,2,B00B2SNE3E,Yeah nothing to write home about.. Lol!,1516320000,,39,4.714285714285714
8561625,1,B00B2SNE3E,"I am giving this one star because I can not give it zero. This garbage masquerading as a film had no redeeming value to it. The story was a weak ripoff of 2006's The Descent, minus the suspense, taut storytelling and gripping performances. Every actor was terrible, but the ""tough kid"" was the worst. I could probably fart out more convincing emotion than this guy. These were also the most well-lit caves I've ever seen! The filmmakers failed to use darkness and shadows in their favor to create an atmosphere of suspense and claustrophobia. The writing and dialogue were like something a 16 year old horror fan might write.
SPOILER ALERT:
They find a way out but give up because only one of them could maybe squeeze through with the cell phone, but what would they tell 911 about where they were? So they give up. How about this plan, Einsteins, send the small one out through the hole, with the cell phone and keys to the bus. First, this was 2006 (though Amazon says 2012), so it is very possible that at least one of their cell phones would have either GPS or 911 tracking, so the smaller girl could have called 911 and had them track to her location. Second, she could have just gotten on the bus and driven for help! But no, they decide to stay down there with the monster. Then at the end, our heroine climbs out through the gap they'd abandoned hours before, anyway. Oh my God, this was so stupid!

Finally, this was supposed to be about a chupacabra, yet it had bat wings ...",1514505600,,1485,4.43956043956044
8561626,3,B00B2SNE3E,"The CC was exceptional. Acting was pretty good. Video was better than most. Some back stories turn the characters. The monster was a natural killer with hit and run speed and a messy eater. I didn't really see the monster. A few lurking shots would have added more to it. Though the people are an important 'ingredient', I think the goat sucker should have had more exposure and definition in the front of the story. Maybe add a few news photos of its victims etc.. I would have liked to have seen a biology teacher with hidden aspirations toward cryptozoology, using his nave students as a buffer to capture the monster. Somebody you would love to hate. (I digress, knowing realistically that it might be hard to find one psycho in seven people).
It really needed some more classic horror.
Someone said there are two fears we are born with, falling and loud noises.
But I remember my first day on the school bus when I feared that the fat kid was going to eat me.
I think a few more seconds of a hapless victim watching himself being devoured wouldn't have hurt the story too much.
It had a couple of surprises along the way that kept me watching.
I want to say situational/horror but most of the situations are mundane other than the teacher 'tappin' that'.",1506643200,,1259,4.526315789473684
8561627,2,B00B2SNE3E,"I'm grateful that this isn't yet another ""found footage"" movie that gives you a headache to watch. Aside from that, it's pretty bad. The characters are so stereotypical that it's hard to care about any of them. The acting isn't terrible but the movie just never grabbed my attention. It isn't scary, you really don't care when people die, and the CGI is laughable.",1506384000,,364,4.703125
8561628,3,B00B2SNE3E,"Well done movie, Acting was pretty good.  Great story with an original background and presentation. Pretty good character development.  Reasonable creature effects given what I can only assume the budget was.  This was not a blockbuster but they did very well with what they had and it was well thought out and executed.  I bet with a real budget these guys could make a great movie.",1506211200,2,383,4.757575757575758
8561629,2,B00B2SNE3E,wow,1506038400,,3,3.0
8561630,4,B00B2SNE3E,"I was pleasantly surprised, it was much better than I was expecting.",1505433600,,68,4.75
8561631,3,B00B2SNE3E,"This was actually pretty good, much better than I thought it would be. I gave it a 3, the only reason I didn't give it a 4, was because of the normal stupidity of some of the characters that had me saying, ""oh really?"" Like, seriously, why would you choose to do nothing when you find yourself in a life threatening situation, with reactions like ""I'm not climbing up there"", or ""I'm not going anywhere"", both of which happened at least several times along the way.
But aside from stupid statements like that, there were some very tense, and scary moments that kept me sitting on the edge of my seat. And I'm still not quite sure of what to make of that ending, but I won't say anything more, so it doesn't get spoiled for others who haven't seen it.
All in all, it was enjoyable, and I'd watch again.",1504224000,4,801,4.311258278145695
