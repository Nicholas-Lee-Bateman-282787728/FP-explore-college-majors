8438107,5,B004QF7206,"I ordered this set from hamilton book. Which had it for 1/2 the price of amazon. 1 dbl sided disc with iotbs and scarecrows then from beyond on a single sided disc. All 3 were pretty good , IMO. Iotbs and from beyond were equally good , While scarecrows was somewhat slow moving but entertaining regardless.",1500854400,,307,4.5
8438108,5,B004QF7206,"Amazing bundle! I bought this for ""From Beyond."" Classic 80s B-move magic! Twisted! Disgusting! Perverted! Naked older man-@ss. Everything I love in a freaky gooey midnight movie. If you have never seen this movie before, then turn the lights off and your in for a treat!! It will stimulate your pineal gland. Watch out!
Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a wonderful time capsule of the late 70s and a GREAT remake flick. Very enjoyable!
Scarecrows ... I'm not a fan of it. I tried to get through it, but I couldn't. And I love me some bad lowbrow B-movies. The writing and action is very dull and not very interesting.
Two amazing flicks this is a smoking deal!!! I highly recommend this DVD!",1482883200,3,693,4.596774193548387
8438109,5,B004QF7206,"I bought this for "" From Beyond "" and I had no audio issues or any issues at all. My set came with the "" Unrated Directors Cut "" of the film and it plays great. Invasion of the Body Snatchers is also a great movie and Scarecrows is alright but my favorite is From Beyond. Try buying the single disc and pay 40 or 50 dollars which is way too much, so I'm happy with this version for 10 bucks - If you like any one of these movies then go for it !!!!!",1477526400,3,449,3.736842105263158
8438110,4,B004QF7206,Invasion of the body snatchers and from beyond are great on their own. Scarecrows is an OK movie. I would get this set on the two movies alone.,1469318400,2,143,4.142857142857143
8438111,4,B004QF7206,"First off, I can't believe that there was only 3 reviews for this triple feature at it's super low price. All 3 movies are obvious horror/sci-fi classics in my book!
The DVD arrived tge next day as I had paid for to do so. The quality of the discs is as good as it gets for a brand new, unopened dvd.
Sometimes when you get a few movies on 1 or 2 discs it seems the quality & aspect ratio can go down a bit. Not the case at all here. All movies looked great!  I was treated to a great surprise by the directors cut of From Beyond which just happens to be Stuart Gordon's adaption of the HP Lovecraft short story & classic, Barbara Crampton and all!!
Invasion of the Body Snatchers, my absolute favorite of the three movies, looks absolutely great!  Not Blue Ray quality but I think blue ray quality and had ruins the look of classics like this one. ""The Scarecows"", is the last movie & the flip side to the ""Invasion"" disc. Not a favorite of mine but like tge other two, in very good condition & just what you'd want in the horror classic.
I think the only thing left to say here is that if you are a horror or Science fiction fan, you could not go wrong with this little 3 movie set. A perfect addition to any collectors collection or perfect for a long night of horror & sci-fi classics, popcorn & whatever else floats your boat.",1462492800,2,1331,4.175097276264592
8438112,5,B004QF7206,"This is a great set. From Beyond, and Invasion of the Body Snatchers are two awesome films,  which is mainly why I bought this set. I read another comment saying that this version of From Beyond had audio issues,  but I didn't have any problems. I had never seen Scarecrows before, and enjoyed it a lot.",1436313600,3,303,4.392857142857143
8438113,1,B004QF7206,"This does include the classic ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" with Leonard Nimoy and Donald Sutherland, which is great, but in the copy I bought the version of  ""From Beyond"" has no English audio. The French audio works fine, the director's comments are fine, but the English audio is only sound effects and music, no voices. You can get ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" by itself for less, so unless you really want ""Scarecrows"" or speak French, I would pass on this.",1411171200,5,469,4.719512195121951
8438114,2,B004QF7206,"The film included here is not the classic ""Scarecrow,"" with Al Pacino and Gene Hackman, but the horror movie ""Scarecrows.""",1303084800,6,122,5.15
