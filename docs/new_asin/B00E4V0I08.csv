5890416,5,B00E4V0I08,A riveting story about a working family trying to make ends meet. Honest hard working but not getting paid and respected by their clients. The sons try to right a wrong in their own way. In today's world we know this truly happens. All actors seem real and portray the story as if it's their own. I would highly recommend Blue Collar Boys,1397433600,4,338,4.380952380952381
5890417,4,B00E4V0I08,Would have been a 5 but the DVD kept stopping. Must be a low quality disc. Movie was good. I was in the first 5 min of the movie. It was shot in my local town of Keyport N.J.!,1395187200,,175,3.5128205128205128
5890418,5,B00E4V0I08,"Intensely compelling and gripping story and made even more impactful is it is based on true events!  Very honest and sometimes disturbing portrait of contemporary working class life. Enjoyed the cast ; particularly excellent was the father, who was a pillar of strength to his family.",1390003200,3,284,5.173913043478261
5890419,5,B00E4V0I08,"This movie, it's actor's, and it's premise create a beautiful synergy describing a slice of American life. Mark Nistico really knows how to tell a story.",1387065600,2,153,4.923076923076923
5890420,5,B00E4V0I08,"It's rare to find a film that prompts an array of emotions throughout -  anger, happiness, despair, fear, satisfaction, contempt, pity, enthusiasm... Every single character in this film is multi-faceted and you learn to understand every single one of them, whether you like them or not. There are no stereotypical archetypes in ""Blue Collar Boys"", just a glimpse into the life of an imperfect family that is so authentic you feel like these are people you already know. It's refreshing to find a filmmaker brave enough to make a film that does not pander to audiences or push an agenda, but rather provides a gripping story that showcases realism through art.",1386028800,3,659,4.936936936936937

5890422,5,B00E4V0I08,"Exceptionally done, truly independent film.  Entertaining, thought provoking...great performances, score, soundtrack, and pacing.  Moody, real, timely, and gritty...frustratingly provoking. You will not be disappointed.",1376611200,2,219,8.083333333333334
8601125,1,B00E4V0I08,"Imagine the dumbest movie you could ever imagine. Now imagine it being acted by junior high or high school actors.  Add into this, a really bad screen adaption.  This is still worse.",1509753600,,182,4.65625
8601126,1,B00E4V0I08,"Disgusting! Couldn't get past 10 min. All the good reviews are fake, friends of someone related to the making of this film. Don't waste your time.",1496016000,,146,4.653846153846154

Seeing Mark on set, putting together this magical film, was amazing! from beginning to end. The Passion that is put into the BLUE COLLAR BOYS.Relates to all of our lives. And it shows in the film . Its an excellent film. I give it two thumbs up.

8601132,1,B00E4V0I08,"What a waste of time. I was expecting some manly-man action in the end, some revenge, some justice being served on a cold platter, but nooo... This is just a look-at-me, pity-me, soap-opera sob-story.  ""Thelma and Louise"" is a more bad-ass movie that ""Blue Collar Boys"". This is just plain bad.",1407801600,,294,4.764705882352941
