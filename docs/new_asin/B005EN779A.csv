The very beginning will instantly grab you with creative brilliance. I enjoyed it so much I don't want to give anything away. Bottom line, if you are a drummer, watch this.",1324857600,,226,4.512195121951219
4666956,5,B005EN779A,"Totally awesome video.  It's sooooo creative and wonderfully performed.  Don't expect a ""normal"" movie here, just sit back and be entertained by the very clever way in which this was conceived and produced.  I loved it and bought it for my son who is a drummer/percussionist, but you wouldn't have to be a musician to enjoy this.",1426723200,,329,4.7368421052631575

4666958,5,B005EN779A,In the beginning of the film there is a Dodge van going down the highway. The girl driving is looking in the rearview mirror. Then camera turns to the back of the van where a guy is playing a full drum set. It is an interesting movie for people that like different concepts of music.,1412035200,,283,4.163636363636364
4666959,5,B005EN779A,Can't tell you how much we laugh when we watch this movie. A total blast and enjoyable story. Yet you care about characters after it all. Enjoy this!,1395273600,,149,4.357142857142857

4666961,5,B005EN779A,"I really love this off-beat musical (okay, percussion) movie from Sweden. The film is smart and the performers are talented. I was proud to give it as a gift.",1388275200,,158,4.482758620689655
4666962,5,B005EN779A,"This is a great film, especially if you are a musician.  It has a very unusual story-line and the characters are captivating.  Swedish film with subtitles.",1385078400,,155,4.923076923076923
4666963,3,B005EN779A,"In an unnamed Swedish city a group of six drummers/percussionists ""terrorizes"" people by doing unauthorized musical ""concerts"" at a bank or theater, using everyday objects or heavy machines. While a tone-deaf police detective Amadeus (Bengt Nilsson), who happens to be a member of a very prominent classical music family, tracks down these ""musical terrorists"" desperately, both sides sort of come to a mutual understanding.

The Swedish-French movie will be remembered for its wonderful musical sequences including a dynamic highway scene and a humorous ""bank robbery,"" but as a feature film ""Sound of Noise"" needs something more than that. The film is nothing short of ambitious, a conceptually intriguing project with some social satire and a bit of romance, but the result feels like a short film extended beyond its natural running time.

This is director team Ola Simonsson and Johannes Stjrne Nilsson's first feature film. They have a quirky comedic sense that works well in some unusual situations, and two musical bits (set in a hospital and a bank) are very impressive. Unfortunately, the characters and their backstories are not as interesting as these antics. The film's non-musical sections often drag.

""Sound of Noise"" is an amusing film based upon a unique premise, but the film's innovative ideas could have been better made use of by giving more thought to the characters.",1379635200,3,1390,5.252252252252252
4666964,4,B005EN779A,This may be worth a watch.  There are a couple of very unrealistic scenes but it work out well overall.,1372291200,,103,4.15
4666965,5,B005EN779A,"Very Innovative, loco-motive, and provocative to the ears in a positive way! Should watch and listen! Rock on! Highly recommended",1367798400,,129,5.5
4666966,5,B005EN779A,"I loved this film. The art of music used as subversive counter culture terrorism strikes a chord in all of us tired of mainstream ""music.""
A lovely film.",1365033600,,153,4.5
4666967,5,B005EN779A,"If you are a drummer/percussionist, you will likely really enjoy this movie. I am, and it is great fun to watch. Excellent comedic moments and a wonderfully woven tale. I believe all drummers sense the rhythmic pulses both in man-made constructs and in nature. This film is a tribute to the driving beat within us all.",1364947200,,318,4.696428571428571
4666968,5,B005EN779A,"Totally bizarre premise.  Will definitely appeal to those with a soft spot for art, music, civil disobedience, occupy movement, etc.  Charming and unique.",1361836800,,154,5.6521739130434785
4666969,4,B005EN779A,movie could have had longer music sections and possibly explained a bit better the man who wanted 'silent noise' - but otherwise it's okay,1355011200,,138,4.791666666666667
4666970,5,B005EN779A,"If the Monkees were reincarnated in Sweden (with actual musical talent), and decided they wanted to best the Beatle's ""A Hard Day's Night"" with a 21st century art flick/music video with a plot.....you might get something like ""Sound of Noise"". If Stomp and Blue Man Group stumbled onto onto a police thriller movie set in Stockholm....you might get something like ""Sound of Noise"". What fun! What great music! I wish I could see them in person....but this video (and the special features) is the next best thing.",1354752000,,512,4.896551724137931
4666971,5,B005EN779A,"I was totally intrigued by the title, but I did rent it first.  After half an hour, there was no doubt in my mind I would buy it.
The premise is simply amazing: a group of 6 percussion ""terrorists"" compose and perform a Concerto for a City and Percussion Band"" in four brutally rhythmic, unforgettable movements: the sound of what most people consider only noise turns into a music of its own. The realization of this project acquires decidedly surrealistic overtones and is a total success. The predominant theme questions the relationship between rhythm and melody in musical creation.  A must-have.",1352592000,,601,4.9405940594059405
4666972,4,B005EN779A,"Sound of Noise is a a film about 6 drummers that decide to give a city an original and innovative concert using the everyday objects laying around; they're pursued by a tone-deaf policeman that hates music. Overall, it's a great film.

What did I like? The music is the best part of the film. They use everything from bodies to bulldozers to create a unique sound. I laughed a couple of times during the music because of how bizarre and absurd it was. This music group goes to several location like a hospital and bank to play music which adds some variety to the film. The music is very unique and innovative and gives you a reason to bob your head or tap your foot. I also like the policeman and how everything the musicians played on was mute for him; it was a unique spin on the crime aspects of the film. The acting was also great. It's a very original movie, so it gets major points for that. You don't see many films get creative nowadays, and I appreciate that this film takes chances.

What did I dislike? They have 4 main songs in this 1 hour 40 minute film, with a couple of smaller songs tossed into the mix. Consequently, I thought it was a little slow at times and the pacing was off. Also, I thought some of the characters were annoying, but the drummers weren't the only ones though, the other characters, like the professor at the academy, were also a little annoying. These are only minor issues to me, though, but they may bother others.

Overall, I highly recommend Sound of Noise; I think film and music lovers will have a great time with it. As of 7/27/12, this film is available on Amazon Prime and Netflix Streaming.

This film has a little blood and violence. And there is some nudity, but the bodies are painted.",1343347200,,1738,4.388198757763975
4666973,4,B005EN779A,"""Sound of Noise"" is rooted in a boldly original premise. Six Swedish drummers set out to perform 'Music for One City and Six Drummers.'  To pull it off, the percussionists must perform the composition's four movements at various public locations using non-musical objects, vehicles and even body parts. The performances bring to mind the way the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stomp/dp/0783113331/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stomp</a>&nbsp;theater group uses everyday objects to create complex polyrhythms. Additionally, the activist drummers assemble and operate in a way that reminisces the clandestine yet humorous antics of the criminal team in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ocean-s-Eleven/dp/B000P0J0BK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ocean's Eleven</a>."" ""Sound of Noise"" gives an original spin on the cops and robbers plot thread as police officer Amadeus Warnebring pursues the bohemian pranksters. The pursuer and pursued come together for a zany ending that invokes the absurd but is entirely hilarious. It's an indie film that's likely to resonate with musicians and drummers in particular. It feels like an art house film done with a big budget, complete with fantastic visual effects. The film can only be watched in Swedish with English subtitles. Much of the quirky film experience is visual and musical; so despite the language barrier, it shouldn't be a difficult watch for most American viewers. In any case, the Swedish cityscape makes for a vivid setting. The novel storyline, music and acting make for a memorable watch. So in the end, ""Sound of Noise"" is anything but noise.",1341446400,12,1675,6.127659574468085
4666974,4,B005EN779A,"Saw this at the 2010 Seattle film fest and have been waiting for a region 1 dvd or blu ray release ever since. Well, it took a couple years but I can finally watch it again :P The fact that I've checked periodically for this release for years should tell you it's worth watching.",1339372800,3,279,4.185185185185185
4666975,5,B005EN779A,"Now, this is the sort of film that you think, once it has ended, 'how did they come up with this idea and script?!?'. It is a very funny movie but not in that 'i say a joke...did you get it?' typical way (like most comedy movies are). Don't get me wrong. I also love 'what about Mary' and the likes. But this is something else...  it's so different and just makes you laugh at the absurdities and off the wall ideas it confronts you with. And yet, it all seems credible and like it could actually happen. It is just so very well done and with attention to every little detail. Imagine a group of musical 'terrorist' who are fed up with the town's (and possibly the world's) mediocrity in today's music status quo (including classical music). The film shows each of these character's last episode with their former employer (be it a rock, lounge or pit combo/orchestra) and why they are called to form the ultimate music group to show what music really is all about. Then there is the tone deaf policeman  (from a respected classical music family) who starts to piece together the real intentions of the group after discovering clues in each one of their musical 'attacks'. It sounds pretty ridiculous trying to put it into words. But believe me it is VERY funny and original. Rent it or go see it. You will have a blast.",1337126400,10,1320,4.450413223140496

8468797,5,B005EN779A,A fun and creative story!  I really enjoyed the exploration of a musical malady I have never seen used in a story before.

8468801,5,B005EN779A,"Hilarious and profound at the same time. It has kind of a quirky Scandinavian sense of humor which I am accustomed to from watching lots of Scandinavian noirs, mysteries, and dramadies.  It is a must for musicians, especially classical musicians (which I am not) and percussionists (which I am). The less said about this movie in advance of watching it, the better. Allow yourself to be surprised, amazed,  or even enthralled.",1475366400,2,426,4.985915492957746
