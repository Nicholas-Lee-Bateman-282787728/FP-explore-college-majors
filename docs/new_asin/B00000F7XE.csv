7907830,4,B00000F7XE,"This documentary takes us all the way back to 1990, when the information highway was being blazed by cyberpunks, defined herein as ""computer cowboys hacking a perilous post-human lifestyle on new technological frontiers."" The front man for the movement is William Gibson, the award-winning author of the science-fiction novel ""Neuromancer,"" who coined the term ""cyberspace"" despite the handicap of being a confessed computer illiterate. Instead of being characterized as irresponsible techno-vandals, the cyberpunks see themselves as using cutting-edge technology to ""decentralize democracy."" It is interesting to look back at ""Cyberpunk"" from the vantage point of today and judge how well they have advanced McLuhan's Global Village via the Internet. You will find equal measures of wistful naivete and accurate prediction in viewing this documentary.",1000425600,,852,5.879032258064516
