914226,1,6304675143,"This is the ""COLORIZED"" version of this Disney film that they butchered by in the 1980's for the Disney TV channel.  Disney must think that all their customers are adolescents and kids who don't know the difference, WRONG!
I picked this up to buy in the store, saw that it was colorized, and immediately put it down.  I will NOT support butchering of films.  If Disney wants to release the COLORIZED version, fine, do it, but release the BLACK AND WHITE one as well for us purists who want them as originally intended.
BAD, BAD, BAD, HOUSE OF MOUSE choice here.  Hope they get rid of their head of DVD development.  He/she must have been born in the 1980's!!!!",1044835200,6,660,4.512605042016807
914227,1,6304675143,"DVD QUALITY: The site here will not let you change your stars, so to clarify - I feel the movie itself deserves 5 stars, and the DVD available at the time of this review deserved 2 stars because it artificially colorized the film and reduced it to full screen.  A new and improved version of the DVD has been released that is in original black and white and is in widescreen (this is the one I recommend), but Amazon posted the reviews of the first DVD onto the new one as well. Are you confused yet?  The black & white version has been re-mastered and has a cleaner image, but unfortunately is still without extras. Not even some outtakes, gallery stuff, theatrical trailers, or cartoons? It is still a terrific movie...

THE STORY:  live action comedy/fantasy. Professor Brainard (played to perfection by Fred MacMurray) is a forgetful scientist who is so absorbed in his work that he ignores his personal life, much to the chagrin of his girlfriend Betsy (Nancy Olson). So involved in fact that he cannot even remember to show up for his own wedding, and he loses his girl to a rival suitor. But that day he causes a mishap in the lab that accidentally creates a new anti-gravity substance that is basically floating rubber. He tries to convince his girl he has this new miracle, but she thinks he is a crackpot at this point. He tries to impress her by using his invention to help the feeble college basketball team finally win a big game, but she gets madder at his attempt to get credit for it.  He then tries to convince the Defense Department that the substance works, but something seems to go wrong with the tests. For example he rigs his ""Model T"" car to fly, but someone switches cars unbeknown to him and he looks like a lunatic claiming his car can fly. The scenes of the various armed forces commanders trying to outmaneuver each other are rich. The professor is then pursued by criminal boss Alonzo Hawk and his thugs, seemingly the only one who believes he has the substance and wants it for himself. Great satire on college administration, the military, and other institutions, this movie has hilarious antics, crazy stunts, and it is good clean fun for kids and adults.

BEHIND THE SCENES AND TRIVIA: The role of Alonzo Hawk is played by Keenan Wynn, who reprises the role of Hawk for the sequel ""Son of Flubber"" and again in ""Herbie Rides Again."" Also stars Tommy Kirk as Hawks college son, Ed Wynn as the fire chief. You may not recognize the TV newsman, but millions of visitors to Disneyland did, as he was played by Wally Boag who performed daily at Disneyland's Golden Horseshoe Review. The films special effects were nominated for an Academy Award. Disney brought in a science professor to help them design the flubber substance and make the science in the movie more authentic. Produced by Bill Walsh, who also worked on ""The Shaggy Dog"". Walsh also wrote the screenplay and pushed the studio and the director to do the aerial basketball game, that really make the film. The story originated from three short stories by Samuel Taylor that Walt Disney had purchased from Liberty Magazine during the war. Directed by Robert Stevenson, the movie was originally released to theaters in March 16, 1961, one of the biggest box office years for the Disney Studio. The same year saw release of ""The Parent Trap"", and ""Swiss Family Robinson"". All three films were in the top ten grossing films of the industry for the year. The movie returned to theaters in '67 and '74, something unheard of today. The movie was televised as a special on November 11, 1975 and it later aired in two parts on NBC's ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" on September 9 and 16, 1979. The story was adapted to a made for television series in 1988, but only two episodes were ever aired. The sequel to the movie was equally popular in the box office, and utilized most of the same actors and production team. The original movie was released on video for the first time in 1981. It was colorized after an airing on the Disney Channel in 1986. A theatrical version of the original story was remade starring Robin Williams in ""Flubber"" was released on November 26, 1997.  The song in the opening credits is known as the ""Medfield Fight Song"" and was written by the Sherman Brothers in their first feature film screen credit. The background music score was written by Disney Studio composer George Bruns. Running time is 96 minutes.",1043712000,17,4419,4.636015325670498
914228,4,6304675143,"I am very glad that Disney has released some more of its family classics on DVD and have included this witty comedy.  Fred MacMurray is very good in his role as the absent-minded professor who is so busy with his invention that he forgets to go to his own wedding!  The comical results that follow make for an excellent story.  The colourizing really adds to the film, but be prepared to overlook a couple of small detail errors in the colourization.  It is also disappointing that this one along with the other releases (The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again, The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes, Gus, The Horse in the Gray-Flannel Suit, and The Moon-Spinners) are not widescreen which would have added so much more to their enjoyment.  These were apparently low-budget releases by Disney, as this film does not have much in terms of extra features.  It does have both English and Spanish language tracks, and English closed captioning and subtitles for the hearing impaired.  It's worth buying though and the picture quality is very good as you would expect from DVD.  I hope Disney releases more classics like this one.",1043452800,3,1115,4.801047120418848
914229,1,6304675143,"Why do they still do it? Colourize movies that is. I remembered this movie from my childhood days and loved it ever since. Occasionally seeing it on TV still gives me pleasure. I bought the DVD and only after getting it home I found out it has been colourized. It went back to the store for a refund immediately mainly for that reason. Another minor reason, it is not widescreen. Poor judgement on Disney's part. I refuse to buy anything colourized. What would you do if they colourized ""It's a Wonderful Life or High Noon or Psycho"" Would you watch it? No one in their right mind would.",1043193600,6,587,4.444444444444445

Someday when widescreen is the mainstream broadcast available (DTV mandated by FCC by 2007 timeframe) and most of us viewers have switched to new 16:9 televisions; movie watchers will have to be buy another copy of these movies in widescreen format all over again. Boy those movie studios sure know how to keep getting that money out of our pockets. It is sad that the movie studios are slowly destroying the DVD format.
And colorizing the film is silly. Seeing the smooth tones of a black and white film is part of the enjoyment of old films.

914232,4,6304675143,"Fred MacMurray plays the likeable, yet absent-minded chemistry professor of a small cash-strapped college.  He goes from misadventure to misadventure as he first discovers and then tries to make good on his invention to save the college (a tried and true theme of many of Disney's family films).
Along the way we cheer Fred as he tries to help the home team win, repair his romance with the college president's secretary, and improve the quality of life for everyone on earth!  A tall bill to fill?  Yes.  Does he pull it off...well, watch and see.
If you are looking for clean, fun entertainment for the whole family, give this movie a look.  Sure the special effects are outdated, but the storyline is fun.  It doesn't have the high-tech FX of Eddie Murphy's version, but you have to love Fred's flying Model T, and the basketball team's surprise performance.  Flubber to the rescue!

914395,1,6304675143,"I have vague memories of this from childhood - all positive and sort of wacky.  We made a ""goo"" recently as part of a science experiment to simulate glacier movement and the kids had a great time with their goo ... and it reminded me of ""flubber.""  Ah, ha!  I know a great family movie night movie to watch, says I!
But this one wasn't.  We actually turned it off and did other things after not too long.  Why?
The opening story line is about a man who is so removed from correct priorities that he has done the incredibly offensive thing to actually miss his own wedding THREE times.  That's not funny.
Then we have the further development of the same man standing on moral high ground to defend his decision to flunk the star basketball player ... but then blatantly cheat by making the basketball players be able to bounce incredibly high (over the heads of the ridiculously tall opposing team) and win the game.  (This scene got HUGE giggles from my kids, as Disney planned, but - come on, folks - how dumb were ALL those people attending the game to not question what they were seeing in front of them?)
Then we have the same man deliberately trying to scare the daylights out of the (admittedly pompous) rival suitor by dropping his floating-with-flubber-power car on top of the rival's roof, as they drive along dark roads.  Vaguely criminal, says I.
As I said, we turned it off.  Maybe you won't want to even turn it on?",1478822400,,1428,4.461538461538462

So, I imagined that this blu ray version had a colorized version, as well as a high quality black and white version, because the cover shows the color picture of the model T.

914501,3,6304675143,Fred MacMurray who I remember for My Three Sons stars in this as The Absent Minded Professor.  He gets so busy working that he forgets about going to the Alter to get married.  He invents a a rubbery substance called flubber which can bounce and the more it bounces the more energy it produces.  It reminds me of the old Super Ball.  Highlights of this are when the basketball team apply's it to their shoes.  And when Keenan Wynn who plays the villain puts it on his shoes.  Also the professor puts some in his car and it fly's.

He has already missed his wedding a few times.  He eventually develops a new substance which has anti-gravity properties.  He calls it Flubber.

The value of this movie is that it is still a part of American culture and Flubber was mentioned recently in an article about Trump, which is what brought it to my attention.  Another valuable part of the movie is that it shows what America looked like in 1961, especially the big cars.

But the story may be too corny for modern audiences, especially when MacMurray spends a lot of time flying around town in his Flubber-powered Model T Ford.",1454112000,,734,4.785714285714286

914746,4,6304675143,"Filmed in glorious black & white and presented that way in this DVD release (I've never seen the colorized version, didn't even know one existed).  The story is based in part on a short story, A Situation of Gravity by Samuel W. Taylor, and in part on a professor of chemistry at Princeton University, Hubert Alyea (who gave a demonstration of an experiment so Fred MacMurray could mimic his mannerisms for this film).  The film was nominated for three Oscars: Best Art Direction (losing to The Hustler), Best Cinematography (again, losing to The Hustler), and Best Special Effects (losing to The Guns of Navarone).  The story concerns a professor Brainard (MacMurry) who loses himself in his work to the point that he keeps missing his wedding(s) to longsuffering girlfriend Betsy (Nancy Olson).  Third time wasn't the charm; she dumps him for a former boyfriend (Elliott Reid as Professor Shelby Ashton).  Brainard tries to win her back with Flubber.  He puts Flubber in a Model T then he puts Flubber on the shoes of the Medfield College basketball team, thus allowing them to cheat their way to victory.  How he thought that would impress his ex-girlfriend is anyone's guess.  Unfortunately for him, his flying car is spotted by the EVIL Alonzo P. Hawk (Keenan Wynn) and his dimwitted son Biff (Tommy Kirk) who suggests they swap the car for a nonfunctioning Model T.

The humor is broad, mostly of a slapstick nature.  They poke fun at the military and congress.  The Medfield Fight Song was written by the Sherman Brothers (their first song for a Disney feature).  Three generations of Wynns appear: Ed, his son Keenan, and grandson Ned.

Brainard is in love with the college president's secretary, and he has already missed two wedding dates.  Will it be third time is the charm or three strikes, you're out?  Well, on the eve of his wedding, Brainard's experiment takes an unexpected twist and he invents flying rubber - ""flubber"".  Could flubber be the windfall that Medfield needs to solve it's financial woes?

In the meantime a smooth-talking English prof from State is trying to move in on Brainard's girl.  Can is be flubber to the rescue?

You'll love the basketball game, especially with Brainard sitting directly behing the English Prof and his date...and how Brainard discombobulates the English Prof, from above.

His rival for Betsy's hand in mirage, Prof. Shelby Ashton (Elliott Reid) knows Ned is nuts. Seems like the only person that believes Prof. Brainard is that scheming entrepreneurial, Alonzo P.

It is an older film and has the safe forgetful professor cast as Fred McMurray. He is not comic like Robin Williams yet he is engrossed with his chemistry. He is trying to make it to his wedding on time over and over again, and finally after he invents flubber, a different kind of energy, he ties the knot. It is fun to see them play basketball and jump so high. I love the car scenes and think that would be such a fun thing to do if imagination could come true. I liked the safe cozy feel of the film and its Disney happy that comes with it. It is a fun film that may appeal to the younger crowd cus of its funny flubberesque antics.

So naturally when I saw this good-natured classic on DVD, I had that register concept in my head. The Absent Minded Professor---called that because its central character is a professor who is absent minded---is the sort of Disney flick you watch settled back on the couch with a glass of root beer, and you relax while your imagination shifts to auto-pilot. Movies like this show you don't need nudity, cussing, sex, drugs, alcohol, diversity, controversy, a wisecracking sidekick, cute kids, terrorists, computer animation, explosions, gay jokes or color film to tell an endearing story. Nah, with The Absent Minded Professor, you just look on, and feel entertained. I bet they show this movie twice monthly at the multiplex in Heaven.

When I saw it was available on DVD, I quickly purchased it to have it for my family so my 5  year old daughter, husband and I could enjoy it together. The movie is simply infectious and has humor for all ages.

The story is chock-full and has many veins and sub-plots, which add to the fun. Basically, the story revolves around the main character, the ""Absentminded Professor"" himself, Dr. Brainard following the time around his wedding (the third time staged, as he ""forgot"" to go to the first two...I wonder what the outlook is for the third time?), and his unexpected discovery of a metastable compound he dubs, ""flying rubber"", or ""Flubber"".

Throughout the movie, we see several stories playing out - the missed wedding, the discovery of Flubber's properties, Dr. Brainard's attempt to win back his love, and the effort to keep Medfield College afloat financially.  Add to that, the run-ins with the police, and the way Dr. Brainard helps Medfield College win an important basketball game, and you've got yourself a winning ticket.

Overall, this is film is great fun with really timeless humor. You can watch it again and again. There's no cursing or crude humor, so you don't have to be embarrassed to watch it with your kids or even your grandparents. I think this film would be ideal for kids today, from about age 4-15 or so, but it's good for adults, as well.",1210896000,7,1497,4.7203065134099615

I enjoy seeing these movies Colorized!  It would be nice if Disney would provide both the Colorized Version & the Black & White Version on the same DVD. Disney did this with the Shaggy Dog and it was wonderful.

Most children are not interested in Black & White movies.  My own daughter wouldn't watch anything that wasn't in color.  I purchased the Absent Minded Professor, Colorized on VHS years ago and it became my daughter's favorite movie.

Since Disney has provided both the Black & White and Colorized Versions of this movie, I don't understand why people are complaining about the Colorized Version.  If you don't like colorized movies, don't buy them.  Buy the Black & White Version instead.  Let those of us enjoy the Colorized Version in peace.

915327,5,6304675143,"A well-paced comic fantasy starring frequent Disney stalwart Fred MacMurray, this is the original from which Robin Williams, 36 years later, made ""Flubber.""  MacMurray plays Ned Brainerd, a chemistry professor at little Medfield College, who has his head so far up in the clouds that he's managed to twice miss his wedding to Betsy Carlisle (Nancy Olson), secretary to college president Rufus Daggett (Leon Ames).  On the very night when the third attempt is scheduled, an explosion in Ned's improvised garage lab results in the discovery of a gooey dark substance he names ""flubber""--a ""metastable compound"" that ""creates its own energy"" when bounced off a hard surface or bombarded with gamma rays.  Thrilled by his breakthrough, Ned scarcely realizes he's missed the ceremony again, but once he does, he sets out to get back into Betsy's good graces, defeat his rival for her hand (Prof. Shelby Ashton of long-time rival school Rutland, played by Elliott Reed, who took a similar role as Ralph Hastings in MacMurray's ""Follow Me, Boys"" five years later), and ultimately save the college from small-time tycoon Alonzo Hawk (Keenan Wynn), a blustering local loan king and descendant of the town's founders who has loaned half a million dollars to the college and is pressing for repayment.  Along the way he arranges the spectacular basketball victory of Medfield over Rutland, terrorizes Ashton by bouncing his modified (flying) Model T Ford off the roof of his rival's car (the ""Shelby Stomp,"" as he christens it), and has to rescue his Lizzie from Hawk's warehouse after it's switched for a nonmodified version.

The special effects in this movie, while inevitably nowhere near the caliber of what became possible even 15 years later, are among its high points, and certainly very well done for the time.  MacMurray is up to his usual standard as the quiet hero with principles who stands up for what he believes and is ready to fight for his rights.  There's also an abundance of laugh-worthy moments, from the quick shots of Ned's bemused little dog Charlie reacting to the first usages of flubber, through the wonderfully comic maneuvers of the basketball game and Ned's handling of Hawk's two goons in the warehouse, to the skillfully intercut scenes in and high above Washington, D.C., when Ned and Betsy fly the car there to offer it to the government and find themselves the target of the capital's defenses.  (I can't help wondering why, if the picture drawn in the movie is accurate, Al Qaeda was able to fly a jet into the Pentagon 40 years later without having it shot down before it got within five miles of the place.)  In the end, of course, the right triumphs, and Ned and Betsy even manage to have their long-delayed wedding.  Comic without being overwhelmingly slapsticky (a bow to nostalgia is provided by the appearance of Wynn's father Ed in a video adaptation of his famous Fire Chief role), the film can also serve as a good jumping-off point for family discussions, like what we owe to our country and how to handle unscrupulous people like Hawk.",1143417600,4,3073,4.915057915057915
915328,5,6304675143,"I grew up with these classics from Disney. Great family entertainment at it's best! Disney reveals how the most amazing things can be discovered by ""The Absent-minded Professor"" in all of us. Fred MacMurray is the perfect choice for the character - his kind, gentle, simplistic genius and a little bit of vindictiveness really makes his character fly! Teenagers and young adults may find the special effects outdated, but if they can get beyond that, they will still find the story entertaining and fun to watch.",1122508800,4,512,4.965116279069767

Personally I think it looks great in color and very good in black and white too.  The color version is interesting too see what colors things were.  Fred McMurry is really funny and a great comedian in it.  It's a really interesting film and full of laughs.  With him inventing flubber it has a really neat scientific as well as science fiction theme.",1114041600,3,519,4.637362637362638
915380,5,6304675143,"When this film was made in 1961, a material almost identical to Flubber was being developed by NASA for the Gemini Space Program.  To avoid a threat to our national security, the release of ""The Absent-Minded Professor"" was delayed for six months until Walt Disney agreed to delete two scenes showing Fred MacMurray discussing its applications and uses.  The missing scenes have been restored in magnificent color, and the movie seems to have a better flow than the theatrical version.",1097366400,56,485,5.05
915381,5,6304675143,"If ever there were a film that took a silly idea and milked every possible gag out of it, this is it. Four stars as a film, but five stars for being a classic.

The ""science-fiction comedy"" is a movie genre with few entries. (I'm thinking of films in which an SF premise and its development is the film's focal point. ""Back to the Future,"" for example, doesn't count.) I can think of only two significant others -- ""It Happens Every Spring,"" in which Ray Milland synthesizes a chemical that repels wood (don't ask), and ""The Man in the White Suit,"" the classic-but-not-really-very-good Alec Guinness vehicle in which his invention of an indestructible, never-needs-cleaning fabric threatens to ruin the clothing industry.

Disney continued the genre with ""The Misadventures of Merlin Jones"" and ""The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes,"" but none of them is remotely as good as ""The Absent Minded Professor."" It's a classic of visual humor. Not only is there the famous flying Model T, but the professor's attempts to woo his ex-fiance by dancing in flubber-heeled shoes, and a flubber-enhanced basketball game that's an encylopaedia of ""What can you do with flying basketball players?"" gags. Style-wise, this classic sequence looks as if it were lifted directly from MAD.

Bill Walsh's smart script has some good satirical jabs (""I hear Medfield's athletes make as much as their teachers"") and they hold up. One of the best anticipates Congress's destruction in ""Mars Attacks!"" And the professor's attempt to prove he's a loyal, patriotic American (by showing his credit cards) cuts even more sharply today than it did 50+ years ago.

One of the few good things about Disney comedies is that almost all the secondary roles are populated with talented character actors -- Keenan Wynn (who'd repeat his Alonzo Hawk villain in other Disney flicks), Ed Wynn (his father), Elliott Reid (at his greasy, pompous best). Special kudos go to Belle Montrose (Steve Allen's mother! -- note the resemblance) as the professor's housekeeper.

Nancy Olson -- an Oscar-winner for ""Sunset Blvd."" -- delivers a smart, heads-up performance that falls apart only when she stops being mad at Fred MacMurry and becomes a bit of a bubble-head.

Robert Stevenson (grandson of Robert Louis Stevenson) had a directorial career (""Jane Eyre"") before he became a Disney house director, but I've never thought much of his talent (""Mary Poppins"" is slack and sluggish). ""The Absent Minded Professor"" shows him at his best -- brisk and light, almost as weightless as flubber renders the Model T.

""The Absent Minded Professor"" was shot in B&W, because the special effects were too difficult (and too expensive) to do well in color. Had Disney known what a major hit TAMP would be (it played first-run for months), he might have sprung for color. The previous attempt to colorize it was a disaster.

We finally have this little gem in its original form -- an exquisite B&W enhanced-widescreen transfer. (Amazon editor -- please have the negative reviews for the awful colorized version moved or removed. These are fundamentally different releases.) The rich blacks and sharp detail are outstanding -- far superior to even the old LV release. This is close-to-demo-quality B&W.",1083974400,30,3234,5.065789473684211
915382,5,6304675143,"Somehow, the people in amazon mixed reviews from the B&W version and the colorized version of this film... this is causing some confusion between some consumers, so, this is a review from the B&W version.
Some time ago, Disney Company releases this movie in Full Screen and colorized... a lot of people complained because nobody (except, perhaps my mom)wants colorized version of movies in B&W; recently, they re-released it in its original form (B&W and Widescreen)
Video: Amazing!! I can't believe that this movie is almost 50th years old!, you can't notice any age related issues (stripes, grain, etc), just look perfect.
Sound: Very good, and with Dolby Surround.
Extras: D'uh!, nothing, nada, zip, zippola! :(
Foreign language support: Not very good... in the audio section, it contains English and Spanish Track... subtitles just in english.
Conclusion: If you like this movie, you'll love the transfer (and at least, there is a Spanish track for those that speak in this language)... if you are looking for this movie because the extras, better wait, because you'll get frustrated by this disc.",1067731200,38,1101,5.122222222222222

The only mistake Disney made was releasing this before the original black & white version, however with dvd technology they should have brought out both versions on a double sided dvd like ""A Christmas Carol"" was. However, the black & white movie is now available in a widescreen dvd version.

A suggestion is a double DVD package with both this movie and its sequel, Son of Flubber. Each DVD should have some archive extras as well as a newly produced retrospective look back at these movies. How about including Donald Duck's ""Modern Inventions"" short? Disney did brilliant work with, Old Yeller, Pollyanna, The Parent Trap and Swiss Family Robinson DVD releases...but treats this movie in such a second rate manor?

7876106,4,6304675143,"Disney is finally releasing some of their second tier comedies on Blu Ray and The Absent-Minded Professor is certainly among the best of them. The original DVD release was appalling filled with excessive grain and the incorrect aspect ratio of full screen. To top it off, there were no extras on that release.

This new Blu Ray is a major upgrade in quality and it is in the correct aspect ratio widescreen 1:66 and retains it's original Black & White presentation. . Please be aware that if you're expecting demo quality you will be disappointed with this release. The film looks great during normal shots, but this is an effects heavy film and those effects shots along with stock footage are going to make the overall presentation seem inconsistent. There is no way to really make the effects shots look much better than they do, but the film looks very good even during these effects sequences. Unfortunately that is where the good news ends, no extras at all, you would think with a header title of 55th Anniversary on it, they could have done a few things especially since this is one of Disney's early comedy outings and considered a semi classic.

While not the deluxe treatment we hoped for it is a marked improvement over the DVD release for the and many other old Disney films that have gotten little to no respect concerning their releases to home video. As far as the film, Disney used the same formal time and time again, This film and a few others from the early years stand out as far superior to the films that followed using the same basic story and tired gags. The Absent-Minded Professor still holds up at the very least as a pleasant, moderately funny, nostalgic trip back to the early days of Disney family comedies.",1493596800,,1738,4.6396103896103895
