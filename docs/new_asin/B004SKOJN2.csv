8439895,3,B004SKOJN2,"This is a mockumentary of young Vincent (Andy Bowser) a would-be-inventor who seems to be shy one cup and saucer from the set. All his life he's been out invented by people that give away jellybeans and pizza. This time he is not about to be out invented. This is his last year and he's going to show people what he can do.

This is not a mockumentary about inventions but the integrity of the inventors their dreams and those of the people they choose to help them. Can we relate to Vincent's quest and will he finally succeed?

This film is low budget and it shows. They're experimenting with dialogue and it shows. Their timing is extremely excruciatingly and infuriatingly slow. I mean really slow. However I thank them for their effort; yet I don't think this presentation is gonna be on the top of any list.",1322870400,,813,4.486486486486487
