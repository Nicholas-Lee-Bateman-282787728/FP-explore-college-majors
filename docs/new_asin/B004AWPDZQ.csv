4312383,5,B004AWPDZQ,"This is a great little film and excellent for watching with kids, particularly boys.

John Goodman delivers a great character, and the child lead plays his role very well.

This film didn't get seen by many, which is very common these days for little indies, but the cool thing is that (like Firefly and so many other projects) it may get found though online distribution.

Share it with your friends.",1307836800,14,401,4.7
4312384,2,B004AWPDZQ,"AM isn't a bad movie. It is located somewhere between ""Stand By Me"", ""Just a Dream"", ""L'enfant sauvage"", and ""The Cure"", and you might call it somewhat calculated in mixing up themes of its predecessors, but that's OK for me, as I like to abandon myself to this kind of ""emotional engineering"". Although surrendering to AM isn't made easy because of its even more calculated music soundtrack, made by one of those countless wannabe Thomas Newmans who seem to flood the film and TV industry these days, needless to say without touching even the shadow of the maestro. But all of that is acceptable because on the other hand you have a breathtaking performance of Mr. Bennett, one more breathtaking performance one might add, since he apparently never stopped delivering since his remarkable performance in ""The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things"" at the tender age of 7 or 8, giving IMHO the most convincing impersonation yet of James T. Kirk a few years later.

What makes this DVD really disgusting is its scandalous video quality. Not only that you don't have the choice between a DVD and a Blu-Ray, which is rude enough these days, the whole film looks as if filmed through rippled glas, distorting still frames up to the illegibility for example of the plate above the store entrance around 06:39 and creating visual undulations during all kind of movements up to heavy interferences with hachured picture contents, for example the house's wooden exterior walls at around 1:32:52.

All in all I just can't believe that anybody dares to sell such a technical catastrophy of a DVD these days!",1306281600,6,1595,4.860294117647059
4312385,5,B004AWPDZQ,"This is an excellent movie based on the Watt Key book by the same name, following a young boys' (Moon) trials and tribulations after his father passes away.

Much like Secondhand Lions, McCanlies captures the experiences Moon is going through so well.  I've seen this movie half a dozen times and each time I get drawn into Moon's world.  Clint Howard does an excellent job as does John Goodman. Jimmy Bennett as Moon is the perfect fit as well.

Hopefully we'll see a Bluray version soon.",1297036800,42,1041,7.939655172413793

4312403,3,B004AWPDZQ,"This is a very good family film and something I would see on the Hallmark Channel.  However, there were a few things that were annoying and cut the quality of the film to me.  First, no accent by lead actors... it was about a boy from Alabama... Secondly, great actors, horrible lines... felt especially bad for Howard's character and his horrible accent there too... finally, the film score is ridiculous and completely sidetracked me from enjoying the film.  It wasn't until the end that the film music scorer figured out they were shooting in Alabama and added appropriate music, banjo, guitar, etc. instead of the ""action"" music throughout the beginning of the film.  Overall, don't have high expectations and you'll enjoy it.",1514419200,4,730,4.959016393442623

He wants a family. I loved the book and so glad it is a movie. The Book ""Alabama Moon"" holds a very special place in my heart for a loving reason.

It was a great story about brave, intelligent and scared young boys who did amazing things individually and as a team.  The adult acting and assistance by John Goodman was also strong and added a touch of realism. The movie showcased the strength of a family, no matter how it's constructed or how you find it.

I loved how naive the main character was and how he didn't hold grudges.  I also love how it crushed stereotypes by giving the obvious bad guy a chance to prove otherwise.  I would actually have given it 5 stars if I had been able to safely watch it with my kids, for whom the movie seemed targeted.  There was some profanity, and I think it completely didn't belong and was unnecessary.

4312466,4,B004AWPDZQ,"I just watched this movie on Amazon Prime and it was much better than I expected. The story takes place in Alabama and the lead character is an 11 year old boy named Moon who is taken into the woods by his father to live off the wilderness because his father is extremely anti-government but their lonely hermit like lifestyle is soon interrupted by the intrusion of machinery that are creating a road for a hunting lodge. It isn't too long before his father has an accident where his leg is broken and the father refusing to leave for help dies and the boy is then left to take care of himself. Soon he is caught and taken to a boys home where he makes friends and one night they manage an escape from the boys home to return to the wilderness and he begins to teach his buddies how to survive in the woods. John Goodman has a guest appearance as the kindly owner of the hunting lodge and Clint Howard (Ron Howard's brother) has a comic appearance as an inept local law enforcement who has it in for  Moon. I recommend this as a family oriented movie even though it contains some mild language I found it a great way to spend an hour and 39 minutes as it has humor and drama. Filmed largely in Louisiana some parts are filmed in Alabama in nearby (for me) Talladega National Forest.

4312511,3,B004AWPDZQ,This movie is mixed with  a lot of stuff. It even has a Barney Fife type cop in the movie. John Goodman does an excellent job in the movie. I thought this movie was an okay movie because there were some clips in the movie that was too good to be true. Like when all the boys escape from their cells and only one cop was on duty and he was asleep. Does it have a message? Well I felt the message was a little confusing. I mean in the start of the movie the kid is digging a grave for his father. It has its moments in the movie. There's sad scenes and funny scenes. All in all if you want ot see a so so film then this one is for you. I don't know how it can be a family film because there's so much death in the movie to deal with. At least for a minor (12 and under) to deal with.,1330128000,3,781,3.7048192771084336

Alabama Moon is the story of a young boy raised in very unusual circumstances who overcomes obstacles with his youthful determination and eventually finds himself a place where he can love and be loved in return.

Having been taught to distrust people, he has to learn that although there are bad people around there are also many good people that will help if given the opportunity.

A great family film about a boy raised in the wild basically, parents die. Sent to a school for boys run by heartless people.

Boy (moon) and 3 others break out and on the run using his skills as a woods-boy they survive and have a great adventure.

Hunted by a dirty cop, they run and have fun doing it.

Full of surprises, Bennett and Goodman give outstanding performances as do the other main kids in the movie. You learn how to laugh, cry and change all overnight.

This is a MUST SEE as it brings back the adventures I had when I was a kid and the times playing in the woods. And it is also good for young people to see it.",1308700800,35,658,4.141732283464567

8421055,2,B004AWPDZQ,"If you don't get hung up on the impossible and incongruent features of nearly every scene, you may find the movie pleasant.  The broad story line has potential (feral boy loses father and navigates a new world) and the central theme is universal  (growing child discovers the value and limitations of his parent), but the movie careens illogically from one scene to the next.  The acting seems poor, but the abysmal script would make the best actors seem poor.  Characters and relationships are oversimplified to the point of being essentially cartoonish.  As noted in the first sentence, though, you might find this movie pleasant if you watch it as a sort of cartoon.",1521244800,2,669,4.884955752212389
