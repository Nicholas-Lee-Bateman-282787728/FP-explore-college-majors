3882722,1,B0029Z9UQ4,"PLEASE BEWARE PEOPLE. There are companies selling videos in the United  States from Europe and those videos sold can not be played on DVD players sold in the United States. So you end up with a worthless to you DVD,  that you can only see if you take it along  with you on a vacation to the European continent.  And as for the return policy it is o long tedious one.  I caution you too look very carefully when purchasing DVDs  from Amazon the depiction of these companies are NOT  distinctly  apparent it is somewhat shrouded,  look carefully.",1390435200,3,544,4.469387755102041
8358712,2,B0029Z9UQ4,"Unless you are using a region free player, (in the United States) you won't be able to watch anything in the package other than the 3d movie disc.  The BluRay (non 3d) and bonus disc are region B only for some reason.  I don't blame the seller as the outside of the packaging clearly states that the discs are for regions a, b, and c.",1524700800,,334,4.123076923076923
8358713,5,B0029Z9UQ4,"Loved the movie in 3D, but be warned - the 3D disc is the only Region A disc in this set. The 2D version and the bonus disc are region B, unplayable on most U.S. machines. If you don't have a region-free player, 2 out of 3 discs are useless.",1489622400,,241,3.84
8358714,5,B0029Z9UQ4,"What a great movie!  Was glad that someone had warned me about the sadness in the first part of the story, as it allowed me to be ready to explain it enough that my kindergartener was okay with it emotionally.  Also, we have two pet dogs, and our child was a little sensitive about whether Dug the dog was being treated nicely... but as long as you watch with the littler (kindergarten) kids, it's a great story that ends happy & well!",1486684800,,435,4.2926829268292686

8358716,2,B0029Z9UQ4,"Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love this movie. The reason for the 2 stars is that what I received was not what I ordered. This is supposed to be a region free package. The 3D disc does actually work for me. However, the 2D and extras disc do not. Whether it is my regular player or my PS3, I get a message that the disc is locked for another region. So out of 3 discs, I can only use one. I'm not very pleased about that.",1430006400,2,436,3.8555555555555556
8358717,2,B0029Z9UQ4,"Movie is great but region free was misrepresented. 3D disk was region free, the other two disks were not and will not play. Live and learn.",1422662400,,139,4.384615384615385
8358718,1,B0029Z9UQ4,I bought the blue ray cd UP for my son for Christmas. The Amazon discription said it was region free. It was not! I had a dissapointed little boy come movie night. False advertising. This dvd was meant to be viewed only on blueray in the UK.,1419638400,2,241,4.148936170212766

8358720,3,B0029Z9UQ4,"The movie itself is an easy 5 star. The reason I gave 3 star is as a word of caution to potential future buyers.
Only the 3D title is region free. Regular blu-ray and bonus features are region B only (Europe, Greenland, French territories, Australia, New Zealand and few other places that could care less about DRM).

If I had known this, I wouldn't have made the purchase as you pay for all 3 discs, whether you can use them or not.
The bright side is that I do own a 3D TV, so at least I didn't dump my hard earned money into a black hole.

After I've received the blu-ray and I was unable to play it, I went to the merchant's page I found the following disclaimer:

1. The feature film on 100% of our titles will play in North American Blu-ray and PS3 players. (False, regular blu-ray and bonus features are B region only)
2. Special Features on our titles may or may not be region-free (While bonus dvd might be considered bonus feature, blu-ray movie isn't - whether they say it is or not. Either way, if I pay for it I should be able to play it, at least in my primary region.)
3. We guarantee that the main film on 100% of the Blu-ray discs that ship will be Region-Free. Any accessory DVDs enclosed with the movie may or may not be Region-Free. (Fine, but don't sell Region B products for the full price to Region A customers).

This disclaimer needs to be on the product page, not the merchant page. In addition, they need to specify region code for which the region exclusive content is for. Otherwise, there is no way for the customer to know that they are actually making a purchase on.
It is a deliberately deceptive tactic and is a scam in my opinion.

I've talked to Amazon customer support and they were amazing as usual (should have parked that amazing.com domain/brand).
They have issued a full refund and I am happy about that. I have shared this story with their customer support and was promissed that it will be passed along the chain.
I would love to see this merchant either disclose this info on the product page and inform the customer before the purchase is made and time is wasted, or this merchant removed from the marketplace.
In case none of these two happen, I hope future customers get to read this review before they get into this frustrating situation.",1406851200,2,2287,4.397163120567376
8358721,3,B0029Z9UQ4,"I neglected to read the fine print on this item that told me it might not play in DVD players sold in North America.  Luckily, it plays on my laptop, so I kept it.

Having said that, Up is probably my favorite Pixar movie and both my sons love it too (ages 2 & 5)!",1391731200,,264,3.7818181818181817
