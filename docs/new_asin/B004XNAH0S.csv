8447242,2,B004XNAH0S,"NOT USER FRIENDLY

The information contained in this DVD is undoubtedly useful for anyone who wants to learn correct yoga breathing, but is very UN- user friendly in my view.  The DVD is divided into only three sections:  section 1 is a long introduction that describes all of the exercises with detailed instruction on how to do them correctly, etc.; section 2 is a 20 minute exercise session; and section 3 is a longer 40 minute exercise session.  The problem is that section 1 is over an hour long with NO breaks.  Speaking for myself, I was unable to remember and assimilate, from one only viewing, all of the instructions for each exercise and I felt I would need to review the individual exercises before I practiced them for probably some time.  My complaint is that, unlike some (indeed most!) of the other exercise DVDs I have, this 60+ minute introduction-explanation has no index and no ""chapters"" to make it easy to navigate the sequence of exercises.  Maybe this won't matter to most viewers, but it rendered the DVD virtually useless to me.",1384905600,12,1054,4.726775956284153
8447243,4,B004XNAH0S,"This is the most comprehensive Dvd on Breath exercises for yoga I have ever seen.  If you like me, live remote, far from an ashram this is your best bet to learn the sacred art of proper breathing.  Honestly, even if you live in a major city where studios abound, most commercial classes do not teach this practice in depth because it's slow, methodical, and may take awhile to see benefit. Nonetheless, for the true devoted fan of yoga, breath work is where it's at: yoga without proper breathing is NOT YOGA!

The DVD is filmed in a lush tropical setting.  Yamila is beautiful to look at.  The instructive portion of the video is long, detailed, and full of modifications / options for the beginner.  So why not 5 stars? It's because the 20 and 40 minute work out sections are not well cued.  Mr. Andrico has a habit of saying ""Repeat two more times, or repeat three more times"" unless you are going exactly the same speed as Yamila, in the interim between cues you get off pace.  Unless you are looking at the screen, which is impossible to do if you are performing the exercises - you can't tell how fast she is going. Often I find my length of breath, when he cues take two more breaths, is significantly longer than what she is doing.  I'm not even completely exhaled and the cue is to inhale.  I think some more practice with the video will cure this.  I certainly enjoy using it daily.

Also, if you, like me, are eager to get started and dive right into one of the workout sessions before watching the expository portion, you may not understand the abbreviated cueing.  All becomes clear when you go back and watch the over and hour long explanatory section.  I really give him props for giving us so much information on this relatively arcane form of yoga.

Most of the time when I review yoga dvd's I add a caveat that I believe people should find a real live teacher before they get too into videos because I fear people would injure themselves by poor alignment, improper beathwork, or repetitive stress movements.  I encourage the use of videos as a supplement not substitute for a teacher. THIS DVD IS AN EXCEPTION: I would heartily endorse this video to even someone with zero yoga experience, as the instructions are so comprehensive.

Namaste Yamila and Fabio! You guys Rock!",1339372800,14,2293,4.54014598540146
8447244,5,B004XNAH0S,"I have been a student, practitioner and a teacher of various types of Yoga and  meditation for over 30 years.  Fundamental to being able to discover a relaxed and calm state of mind is being able have an awareness of the breathing.  When the breathing is disordered it is a sign that our mind and emotions are disordered.  By learning to breathe in a deep and harmonious way we can more easily calm our mind even in the midst of our often busy and chaotic lives.
In this first-of-its kind DVD Fabio Andrico and Yamila Diaz expertly explain and demonstrate in a simple step-wise fashion the foundation of the `complete' or `abdominal' breathing.  There are simple exercises for warming up the body to make it more flexible and amenable to working with the breathing.  The instructions for unlocking the abdominal, thorasic, dorsal and clavicular breathing are superb and allow the user to discover, finally, how to breathe with awareness, in a smooth harmonious way.  This will have a profound effect on the health and  functioning of the physical body, the energy and ultimately one's state of mind.
The DVD is beautifully filmed in a tropical setting and is accompanied by soothing yet engaging guitar music which makes it not only useful, but also a pleasure to watch!",1305244800,22,1270,4.820276497695852
8447245,5,B004XNAH0S,"I've been following Fabio's course of breathing seriously now for about 3 months. For years, I felt intimidated by doing yoga because of being out of shape and overweight although I've done many meditation practices.  I initially started the breathe course because I wanted finally to quit smoking. By the second class I had smoked my last cigarette in this life.  This course works well for me because of its simplicity and the clarity of the sequence of movements combined with harmonious breathing. It feels great not to have to worry about complicated movements but gently acquire flexibility and range of motion to the point where I can now do some simple yoga positions. However, this video is not about doing yoga but about breathing properly, which is a great benefit to one's health and state of mind.  My only regret is that I waited so long to begin this course. ""Breathe"" is one of the best practices I have ever done in my 30 year history of meditation practice. Thank you, Fabio!!!",1304121600,20,995,4.7398843930635834
8447246,5,B004XNAH0S,"As an instructor of Yantra Yoga and someone who has been trained in the methods found in this video, I  can say that from my experience for myself and my students, the benefits of this system of complete breathing are dramatic, many and lasting. I have had students who have stopped smoking immediately, alleviated restless leg syndrome, lowered blood pressure and hypertension, helped relieve many chronic ailments such as tension, insomnia, arthritis, fatigue, nervousness, and the list goes on and on. Not only that, but these methods are simple, not physically challenging and something that one can easily incorporate in daily life, so they can be used by people of all ages and physical conditions! This breathing technique is a sure way to relax more deeply than you have ever done before!!!
The video itself presents the methods developed by Fabio Andrico based in the principles of Yantra Yoga, in a clear, direct and elegant way. It is very easy to use and follow and it is beautiful to watch.
I would and do highly recommend this video to anyone and everyone!",1303862400,19,1070,4.8791208791208796
