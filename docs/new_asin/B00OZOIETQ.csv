6779889,5,B00OZOIETQ,Sorta like SERIAL MOM!  I enjoyed the quirkiness.,1416700800,,49,5.125
6779890,5,B00OZOIETQ,I loved this movie. I have never been a huge fan of Katie Holmes but her acting and character in this movie were awesome!!!!!,1416700800,,125,4.25
6779891,4,B00OZOIETQ,"This is a delightful vengeance flick. It also has a strong moral compass - warning for those who don't like morals in their movies.

There is no real gore to speak of in this movie, as it would be out of place in this story line.

I really enjoyed the interaction of all of the characters, and Katie Holmes was perfect as Miss Meadows.",1416700800,3,335,4.21875
6779892,5,B00OZOIETQ,"Great performance from Ms. Holmes.  Badge does great, too. I enjoyed this one.",1416528000,,78,5.0

6779894,4,B00OZOIETQ,"This movie wasn't a horror movie genre.
I love the relationship between ""Sheriff"" and Miss Meadows. It is really sweet how
he loves her and the ending is good.
I love the part where they dance in the grass and
how he loves her even though she is ""weird"" and unique.
Katie Holmes is just a doll anyway, but this movie
makes her endearing. She is just dear.
This movie was unique in the story, and that deserves
something. It made it fun to watch.",1416182400,20,445,4.247058823529412
6779895,5,B00OZOIETQ,"This movie is really weird but for that reason I appreciate it even more.  I guess it sort of reminded me of the old John Waters movies.  Sort of slobbishly directed but brilliantly acted by Katie Holmes.  She really nails the part.  Give it a try, it might surprise you.",1416009600,28,271,4.36
6779896,4,B00OZOIETQ,"The ex-wife of Tom Cruise is playing a seemingly-wholesome elementary school teacher who takes justice into her own hands at night, thanks to a pistol she keeps handy in her purse. The film was directed by actress and writer Karen Leigh Hopkins, known for penning the screenplay for 1998's ""Stepmom.""

Holmes said she jumped at the chance to get to play a vigilante who goes against societal norms.

""She was so free, and really believed in everything she was doing and I thought that was refreshing,"" Holmes said in a recent interview with CBS News.

The 35-year-old actress also was delighted by the fact that her character wears tap shoes and often dances around in public, when she's not busy taking out the bad guys.

""I hope it promotes more dancing in the streets. I really hope 'Miss Meadows' has that effect,"" Holmes said.",1416009600,7,831,4.75

6779900,1,B00OZOIETQ,The acting was so poor that I couldn't finish watching it.,1527552000,,58,4.363636363636363

6779903,1,B00OZOIETQ,"This is one of the biggest waste of times I've seen in a long time. Just plain dumb, especially when it goes from domestic bliss to a mass murder at a restaurant. Fails on all levels. Sad, since the concept is brilliant.",1527206400,,220,4.261904761904762
6779904,2,B00OZOIETQ,"Interesting premise, but it didn't really catch me. Felt like a wasted hour plus.",1526688000,,81,4.857142857142857
6779905,5,B00OZOIETQ,"Odd, definitely odd, but a very well done movie with a satisfying ending and excellent acting. Great chemistry between the characters and certainly an entertaining watch. If you're on the fence about watching it, go for it!",1526428800,,223,5.054054054054054
6779906,2,B00OZOIETQ,"I consider this a B rated movie in all honesty. The plot and story is wonderful, its just not executed very well. The sex scene made me cringe. lmfao",1526083200,,149,4.172413793103448
6779907,5,B00OZOIETQ,This was a great movie. It was almost like a Tarantino movie but less blood. Katie Holmes did a fantastic job making herself the end complete woman. I would highly recommend it.,1525910400,,177,4.5625
6779908,1,B00OZOIETQ,"Much fun good interesting things could have happened.  Instead odd pauses ( for dramatic effect without effect) music trying to tie it all together, great child cast acting better than the stars...  overall not worth the time",1525737600,,225,5.054054054054054
6779909,1,B00OZOIETQ,"Boring and awkward to watch, all the amusing parts are in the trailer. Even the funny parts are just not that funny. The actors just come off as uncomfortable and trying to force the character",1524528000,,192,4.514285714285714
6779910,5,B00OZOIETQ,View Katie Holmes in a whole new light Loads of fun,1524268800,,51,3.727272727272727

6779913,5,B00OZOIETQ,Very clever writing and character development. An interesting watch,1523923200,,67,6.555555555555555
6779914,5,B00OZOIETQ,This is a fun movie to watch.  Ignore the movie critics who act as if this should be Gone with the Wind.  Katie is fun and cute in this flick. Enjoy.,1523836800,,149,3.774193548387097
6779915,5,B00OZOIETQ,"I live whimsical sometimes. We live harsh realities all the time, so whimsical is nice. Ms. Holmes was excellent. Movie wad great & I'd definitely watch it again. Don't know how I missed it from 2014 anyway.",1523750400,,207,4.621621621621622
6779916,4,B00OZOIETQ,"Well acted, quirky but not overbearingly so, interesting premise.

Worthwhile to watch",1523577600,,86,6.166666666666667

6779920,5,B00OZOIETQ,Loved it!,1522454400,,9,4.0
6779921,4,B00OZOIETQ,Refreshingly offbeat psychological thriller. Great chemistry between the two leads. I liked it.,1522454400,,95,6.384615384615385
6779922,4,B00OZOIETQ,"Of course I like anything Katie Holmes does.  My daughter's last name is Meadows, therefore I liked the title of it.",1522454400,,116,4.523809523809524
6779923,5,B00OZOIETQ,"Directed by a woman, with a female lead star, and playing a female vigilante...oh, and its a black comedy, and a damn, quirky, good one. If you like nature, frogs and flowers, you like heroic, but...unusual female leads, and you like a good sound track, you've come to the right place. Don't expect the usual male point of view, all violence, gory and fast. This is a feminine, and feminist tale, one worth watching.",1522281600,,416,4.635135135135135
6779924,3,B00OZOIETQ,"Well, I will say the acting was very good.",1521676800,,42,3.7777777777777777
6779925,4,B00OZOIETQ,Better than I thought it was going to be. Worth watching.,1521331200,,57,4.2727272727272725
6779926,4,B00OZOIETQ,"Seriously enjoyed this. A little predictable, but found it entertaining in a dark, twisted way. Worth the watch!",1521244800,,112,5.277777777777778
6779927,4,B00OZOIETQ,"Surprisingly good. Check this out, it will exceed your expectations and might even make you chuckle some.",1521158400,,105,5.235294117647059
6779928,1,B00OZOIETQ,don't understand how this movie has so many 4 star reviews. Maybe I am missing something? I guess not my kind of movie.,1521158400,,119,4.217391304347826
6779929,5,B00OZOIETQ,"First viewing seemed an oddly entertaining, amusing, dark fantasy. Drawn back for a second watch was more deeply intrigued by the many layers of psychodrama and clever detailing of characters and dialogue. Now I have to own this enchanting, simple film.... For further study and reflection... It is much more than the eye can behold.",1521072000,,333,5.072727272727272
6779930,5,B00OZOIETQ,"Funny, dry humor.",1520640000,,17,5.0
6779931,1,B00OZOIETQ,"The only reason this gets 1 star is so I can write what a lousy movie it is. Stupid story, lousy acting, badly written. What a waste of time and film.",1520640000,,150,3.870967741935484
6779932,2,B00OZOIETQ,Especially the ending..  I thought the ending was confusing and just wrong.. I wanted to see them moving forward with life as a family and that poor abused dog there by their side..  wasn't the case unfortunately.,1520035200,,213,4.72972972972973
6779933,4,B00OZOIETQ,Entertaining... cute with a twist,1519948800,,33,5.8
6779934,1,B00OZOIETQ,"Could not watch more than 5 minutes of this stupid thing.  Katie Holmes has sunk so low, if she thinks this movie was a success then I understand why she is seldom seen on screen anymore. I kept waiting for something relevant to happen, never did.",1519948800,,247,4.369565217391305
6779935,1,B00OZOIETQ,Only watched about 20 minutes.  Was just about the most painful 20 minutes of my life.  Main character is so annoying I had to stop the movie.  The movie at this point still appeared to have no plot whatsoever. The only reason I managed to watch that much is because it was Katie Holmes who I usually like.,1519862400,,306,4.241379310344827
6779936,4,B00OZOIETQ,I've only seen a few of of Katie Holmes' movies. The premise sounded twisted but entertaining and it was. She played the prim and proper teacher with a dark side and her always handy purse very well. Jean Smart's mother Meadows was well done.,1519776000,,242,4.5227272727272725
6779937,1,B00OZOIETQ,"So stupid! Slow, boring, obvious ending.",1519776000,,40,5.833333333333333
6779938,4,B00OZOIETQ,"i liked it. i don't really care for katie holmes because i think she's corny, but her corniness worked in this movie. i actually started to like her and miss meadows.  :)",1519689600,,170,4.3125
6779939,1,B00OZOIETQ,"This is distrubingly pathetic movie by a less than mediocre actress. Katie Holmes cannot act and it's painful to see her poor pathetic pursuits.
I wanted to like this movie as I like oddball indie films and dark comedic stories. this one is neither.  Super creepy scene where she is giggling like a 5 year making  love with the sheriff and he was ok with it. Not weird, not funny, just creepy creepy creepy. Miss Meadows was clearly insane in a very dangerous way for no clear reason and it was execeedingly transparent. Of course she becomes pregnant and the enitre story is bad to worse. Meadows never became real nor did any of the characters, Filmed in 17 days it really showed. Holmes' whiny fake voice and ridiculous one liners simply made no sense. This movie is not about justice, fairness or balance. it is about a depraved female serial murderess and her enablers",1519689600,2,873,4.625806451612903
6779940,1,B00OZOIETQ,I stopped watching 20 minutes in. for a few things. 1. no one was treating her like a crazy person. like a freaky crazy person that needs to see a doctor. 2. the conflict was not seen in the first 20 minutes... unless her being crazy and no one talking about it not even her own mother is the conflict. if that was the conflict the preview was not telling the right story. and that is why i did not like it.,1519516800,,407,3.975609756097561
6779941,5,B00OZOIETQ,"Katie Holmes truly did an outstanding performance in this film. It was definetly an Indy film in that only the real movie-buffs who actually have an appreciation for all aspects as well as what goes into a film, would really see how this movie hit every point it was supposed. Very hard to decribe as I don't want to call it a dark comedy, which I'm sure that's the title it gets. Let's just say, it's perfecty comparable to the main character being a Mary Poppins in today's real world surrounded by rapists and pediphiles. What would she be willing to do to keep the children safe?  And it is sooo nice to see Ms Holmes on the screen again, making her own decisions and impressing us with that superb talent of hers. I don't care if you're a man or woman, This movie is immensly enjoyble regardless of who you are and has you cheering and satisfied from beginning to end. This is on my buy list!!!",1519516800,,899,4.351190476190476
6779942,5,B00OZOIETQ,So quirky and whimsical! Katie Holmes is amazing in this movie. I was never a fan of hers but she now has my undivided attention!,1519430400,,129,4.2
6779943,5,B00OZOIETQ,"""Ms. Meadow"" (2014) was an excellent movie presenting the complex dynamics under each mass shooting, the legal/political frictions, and the needs to get ""something done"".",1519430400,,170,5.84

Katie Holmes is fantastic as Miss Meadows. I've watched it three times now. A great stay-home date-night bizarro romance film.",1518998400,,342,5.596153846153846
6779946,5,B00OZOIETQ,"I absolutely love this movie. This movie is life. Im not a huge fan of Katie Holmes, but she is amazing in this role.",1518998400,,117,3.9166666666666665
6779947,1,B00OZOIETQ,Utterly stupid story line.  This character belonged in an institution for the mentally ill.  Her sheriff boyfriend wasn't much better.,1518998400,,134,5.65
6779948,2,B00OZOIETQ,Boring,1518912000,,6,6.0
6779949,2,B00OZOIETQ,"Movie never quite finds its footing. Starts with some fun and macabre humor and slowly spirals into a humorless melodrama before attempting to crawl its way back out. Katie Holmes is great, but the script is sort of a mess.",1518912000,,223,4.6

6779952,4,B00OZOIETQ,"Unconventional in plotting and acting, this is just weird enough that if you are open to quirkiness it might be worth a watch.  Not what I expected in any sense, but oddly likable in its dark semi-comedic weirdness.",1518652800,,215,4.657894736842105

6779954,4,B00OZOIETQ,"I wanted to hate this movie; but Ms. Holmes does her craft credit. Her character's simplicity draws you in, one's curiosity is piqued, making this viewer wonder, what made this person turn out this way? When a performer can stir a viewer's curiosity, while making them care about the character, it says a lot about the believability of the story.",1518566400,,346,4.783333333333333

6779963,3,B00OZOIETQ,"I wasn't really expecting much and it met my expectations. Some Feminists are writing reviews as if this has a shred of being remotely plausible. More murders per square foot than war-torn (Fill in the blank), yet nobody seems overly concerned about it. Yes, it was quirky as if that were a major selling point. Very decent acting by Katie Holmes, given what she was expected to work with. Not a total waste of time.",1518134400,,416,4.56

6779971,5,B00OZOIETQ,"Refreshingly eccentric. Katie Holmes and James Badge Dale are impeccable in this pistol-packing romp. Miss Meadows, the character, is far from perfect, yet somehow manages to inspire...which is the main delight of this film.

6779973,4,B00OZOIETQ,"Quirky film that has our Miss Meadows doing what many of us secretly wish we could, take out the human trash in our society. Well done portrait of a strangely prim, buttoned down yet unhinged  woman who reacts to a horror she experienced as a child by eliminating the evil she encounters, permanently. I love this for its out of the box perspective. Recommended.",1517616000,3,362,4.65625

6779979,4,B00OZOIETQ,"I didn't have high expectations of this movie as Rotten tomatoes gave it such low rating, but I thought it was a quirky movie that was defiantly worth watching. Katie Holmes did a wonderful job playing the main character.",1517184000,,221,4.6923076923076925
6779980,4,B00OZOIETQ,"I loved the quirkiness of this movie, basically Mary Poppins meets Clint Eastwood.  I also liked that there was, for the most part, no guilt involved in killing those that quite frankly deserved to be killed.  I would love for justice to work this way and am constantly amazed at all the tv shows and movies that promote the whole ""just because this person took a life or molested a child doesn't mean he deserves the same because you are better than that and you don't want to be on their level"" kind of crap.

6779981,3,B00OZOIETQ,It was ok. I enjoyed it. Though I must point out all the demonized vigilante acts in the movie were more accurately self defense or defense of another.  They weren't in truth vigilantism. This trend of Hollywood to portray defending yourself as inherently wrong is getting old.

Seems like a contradiction in terms, but we find out her true calling in the first scene.  Miss Meadows wears tap shoes and stops for a littlectap dance every so often. She wears old fashioned outfits that coordinate and always carries her purse filled with her killing machine.

Miss Meadows wants all the criminals done away with as she protects her neighbors and children. She meets a #herriff, they fall in love, and it does not take long for him to discover her true call8ng. This started out as a kind of fairy tale, but realk6 ended up as a not so likable film.

She reminds me of my college girlfriend, sans the armament. Quite frankly, I am surprised that there aren't more avenging angels like Miss Meadows keeping us, our kids and our streets safe from the disproportionate number of murderous thugs, perverts, tormentors and freaks that have become so ubiquitous as of late.

6780061,1,B00OZOIETQ,"SPOILERS AHEAD. If you have not seen this movie, and intend to see it, don't read this review.

The soul of a vigilante, says the blurb about the star of this movie. But that is not at all what is depicted.

Miss Meadows is depicted killing 3 people. The first takes place before the credits. She is walking along the street looking prim and pretty when a man drives up in a truck. At first he tries to entice her into his truck, then he pulls up alongside her, opens the passenger door, and orders her to get in. When she refuses, he points a gun at her and repeats, Get in! She takes a gun out of her purse and shoots him. Now, that is not vigilantism, it is simple self-defense and is entirely legal. That she then calmly walks away is neither legal nor smart nor even decent. She should call 911 and ask for police and an ambulance  she cannot know whether she has killed him  and explain what happened. As the police will find the gun next to the body, her story will be believed and the police will not be faced with a murder needing investigation.

Later, she walks into a restaurant and sees a crime scene where the patrons are dead and the killer is standing there with a rifle. He puts the gun in his mouth, apparently in order to commit suicide. Surely the only sensible thing for Miss Meadows to do now is to quickly leave the restaurant and call the police. Instead, she not only shoots the man, she empties her gun at him. Now, this action is simply inexplicable. She is not trying the save the patrons, who are obviously dead, and she can easily get out the door and call for help. The scene makes no sense and does not at all fit in with the plot, except to show that Miss Meadows is flat-out crazy and a menace to all (maybe another wounded patron is hiding behind a door or under a table and gets hit by one or more of her bullets).

Finally, she is teaching a class and sees that a boy has been abused  hit in the cheek and, he says, when he turns the other cheek, he gets hit there too. Any teacher knows that in these circumstances you report to the police or to the school administrator who will report to the police  that is required by law. Instead, when he gets up and says he must hurry or the priest will be angry that he is late, she gets the idea that he is being abused by the priest and runs to the church. This is simply bizarre. Her boyfriend is the sheriff. She need only call him, tell him of her suspicions, and have him race to the church in his police vehicle much faster than she can get there on foot. Then, if her suspicions are correct, the priest will be arrested and prosecuted. But no, she runs to the church, opens the door to find the priest in the act, and shoots him dead  and in front of a witness, the boy! Vigilantism? Closer than the others, but she had a better way of stopping the abuse and punishing the priest  call the cops, thats what they're for, and its really easy when you're dating one.

Her excuse for this behavior, when she is confronted, is that she is just doing what society should do but doesnt, and is saving the money that would be spent in investigating and prosecuting if that should happen. That just doesnt hold water. In the first killing, the police wasted a lot of time looking for the truckers killer when she could have quickly told them what happened and they could have closed the case right away. In the restaurant case, the killer was on the point of killing himself, instead she pumps him full of bullets the police will identify as not coming from his gun, giving them another killer on the loose. And for the priest, unless the boy talks, the police will be faced with yet another killing which they will have to investigate; and if he does talk, she will be charged with murder.

Finally, the sheriff knows that he is marrying a serial killer, one who admits she cannot control herself when she is confronted with what she perceives as injustice, though she promises to try. Apart from the fact that he is allowing a homicidal maniac loose on the streets, doesnt he wonder what she might do if they have an argument? Yes, hes armed, but hes hardly going to shoot his wife, and surely he must go to sleep sometime. Or maybe she gets pissed at a babysitter or the postman or the butcher she suspects of giving her short weight. Bang!

In other words, the whole thing makes no sense and includes many unpleasant scenes, including one in which she and a little girl are about the be tortured. Leaves a very bad taste.",1514678400,5,4503,4.289752650176679

6780082,4,B00OZOIETQ,"A friend noted she was watching this with favorable comments, after I'd added it to my ""to watch"" list, and I immediately gave it a go.  It attempts to split the difference between the unregenerate darkness of Falling Down and slapstick physical comedy and over the top satire of Boondock Saints I and II.  At the same time, there's enough originality in the characters and their relationships to make it original.  While I feel they could have done more, to add depth to the story and its plotting, it in fact works pretty well for a 1:23 movie.  Miss Meadows (played by Katie Holmes who is well casted for the part), is a rolling stone substitute teacher, traveling from town to town.  Without spoiling, her backstory makes clear she is a child whose emotional, character and judgmental development are largely stunted at the level of a five-year old.  Apparently raised by a mother who has taught her all the right things, Mary Meadows remains locked in the pre-teen's undeveloped capacity for understanding paradox and grey areas--all is right or wrong, just or unjust, good or bad, black or white.  One of the greatest features of her character, however, is Miss Meadow's gradual turn to acknowledge her womanhood out of her little girl affect and recognition that grey areas exist.  Her mature womanhood is manifest in her relationship with the local sheriff, who in one of the more clichd plot elements finds himself in love with Meadows at first sight, and increasingly confirmed in his knowledge she is a vigilante.  She senses the tension, feels a full mature love and sexual attraction, ultimately resulting in pregnancy.  Almost simultaneous with her move from shrugging off her self-imposed ""spinsterhood"", she moves to confront a more thorny dynamic in the approach she takes to a convicted child sex offender recently released to the neighborhood she sees as a probable threat to the very children she is teaching.  Up to this point, Miss Meadows has demonstrated her commitment and her lethality in a series of confrontations with a would-be kidnap/rapist, mass murdering active shooter and pedophilic child sexual abuser she dispatches in episodes of immediately escalating and explosive violence befitting a Howard Hawks gun or fist fight in one of his patented Western scenes.  The build ups are slow enough to leave no doubt who is in the right and who is in the wrong, and what is about to happen is so certain that it is only the speed with which the climax comes that leaves us wondering if it really has happened so quickly.  No better example is offered than that featured in the trailer, as an active shooter Miss Meadows stumbles into contact with in the wake of having killed every person in a restaurant, vacillates between deciding to commit suicide or turn his gun on her, finally saying about his contemplated suicide, ""I think I've changed my mind"", to which Miss Meadows replies with both determination and contempt, ""That is so not an option"".  She drops him on the next beat.  One can think these episodes are too many, too excessive, to pat, too clich, but the fact is they are designed to serve just that purpose in making the point in our minds:  as clear cut and stereotyped as these encounters may be, in our own and Miss Meadows' own minds, the contrast to what happens next.  Her clear cut moral understanding leaves her at a loss to know exactly how to handle the newly released child sex offender who has in fact served his sentence, will claim he's changed, and as of yet has not committed any offense ""on her watch"".  It would be wrong to assassinate him preemptively and thus she does not.  In an absolutely surreal scene, she pays him a visit and, from a basket, she offers to serve him tea and cakes--exactly like a little girl would offer to do.  In turn, he complicates things further by appearing to be as refined in his manners and courtesies as is she, expressing great happiness and thanks to her for welcoming him to the neighborhood and showing him kindness.  She knows what he is, what he is capable of, and that it is likely he will seek prey again, but is finally forced to confront the grey area of incipient evil without clear justification to resort to deadly force.  Her go/no go decision is cloudy.  She makes the effort to influence, persuade, deter this predator; but, his response is to express defiance in the face of her threats with greater charm and reserve than she herself is capable of maintaining.  He is in control, she is left not knowing how to respond and for the first time, as she tells her mother who acts as her fundamental guidance system, she is afraid.  Her mother seeks to buck her up, and Miss Meadows realizes she must at last find her own true self in an adult world confronting the complex issues facing adults.  It is at this point the film is most flawed--a game of cat and mouse ensues, while Mary Meadows vacillates not knowing what to do.  Law enforcement, her predator nemesis and reality all seem to be closing in on her simultaneously.  She is torn between her desire to protect her unborn child and seek the life she's always wanted, and her mission to protect the children and larger society by ""doing what we can"".  Sadly, another 15-20 minutes of footage could have been productively used to better develop the dynamic between Meadows and her enemy, before the climax unwinds.  The real climax is, perhaps, that Miss Meadows finally completes herself, grown up.

In the end, there are numerous flaws and disappointments which come to mind only because the movie was otherwise a good one, and had greater potential.  The Miss Meadows character could be a classic in presenting a contrast between the little girl affect, skipping through hopscotch in patent leather tap shoes and prim outfits, and the rather refined woman who reads poetry on her walks home, dances and reflects a deep wisdom in her conversation while confidently wielding a pistol from her purse and knows how to use it.  In contrast to the realist dramatic presentation of vigilantism in films like Francesca Eastwood's M.F.A., this is dark absurdist satire with a very memorable character at its center.  I would have preferred a different approach to the ending entirely.  I would have liked a better developed back story and better developed plotting leading to the film's climax, but it's not a bad show.",1511136000,3,6380,4.774340309372157

6780100,4,B00OZOIETQ,"Amusingly absurd. The fun is in the details, starting with the choice of the innocent-looking Katie Holmes to play Miss Meadows. If there is a universal message, I believe it's that vigilantes have the moral maturity of three-year-olds. For Miss Meadows, the representative, justice is simple, situational and self-serving: I dislike what you did; you're dead. She doesn't apply her take on justice to herself.

I would say she is a split personality because of early psychological trauma, in line with the street understanding of schizophrenia. The vigilante is one personality. The mature, compassionate woman and teacher is the other personality. The two overlap in the area of wardrobe and the odd contrast makes an absurdly funny character.

Her boyfriend, then husband, is more like the rest of us - unable to plow through multiple layers of ambiguity and come up with a precise, principled definition of justice.",1510099200,2,919,5.202702702702703
6780101,4,B00OZOIETQ,"Holmes acting actually amazed me in this movie which, according to the notes amazon shows as a title starts playing, was filmed in 17 days.  She still exudes ""cute"" at 35 (at time of the films release).  At the same time, she can turn her facial expressions quite dark, almost sinister.  Watching her play the character is kind of like looking at a photo print and the negative at the same time, if that analogy makes any sense.

The movie is essentially the timeless tale of good and evil in the world...and how some people try to make the world a better place or cope with the bad.  As another reviewer said, it's difficult to go into much plot detail without giving away too much.  I'm a guy (lured by the cover art of Katie with a pistol) and was able to cheer and pity Holmes character while also associating with the main supporting actor, her love interest, and how the events impact and draw him in.

Spoiler alerts:

1 part Psycho (the original, 1960), 2 parts Falling Down (Kurt Douglas, 1993), 1 part Pleasantville (1998), 1 part The 'Burbs (Tom Hanks, 1989) with a dash of Harley Quinn thrown in for good measure.

Also, it's a dark comedy, but I'd rate the ending as ""happy"".

Parental advisory:  While the movie does depict a strong female, lead there is a sex scene.  No skin is showing, but it's proof that it only takes one time.  There is no gore depicted, but several people are killed.  There is a scene depicting ""that which some Catholic priests have become known for"", although it isn't graphic. So, while the main character is a teacher at an elementary school and several prominent characters are children, watching with a child might invite interesting and awkward questions.",1509926400,,1701,4.607973421926911

6780140,3,B00OZOIETQ,"This is the strangest movie I've seen in a while. If Jane Austen and Beatrix Potter collaborated to write a movie about a vigilante, this would be the result. Wrap your head around that if you can. I think all of us at one time or another feel that some people, like pedophiles and serial killers, do not deserve to live, and if they somehow run into someone who kills them, we do not mourn the loss. And sometimes it seems that due process, which is the right of every citizen, unfortunately releases the wrong people all too often. But no one person has the right to appoint herself or himself judge, jury, and executioner. Even though I understand Miss Meadows' motives, I cannot condone her actions. Wrapping the story up in a fairy-tale bow doesn't make it right. Still, it is an interesting little movie.",1508716800,2,810,4.554794520547945

6780142,4,B00OZOIETQ,"Really love the subject matter...no spoiler that this is a vigilante movie with a twist. However, I must warn you that the twist is not that big of a deal and the rest of the movie is very predictable.

Holmes does a great job playing the mysterious, creepy Miss Meadows. There are some hints early that things are...well...not exactly as they seem...but the little secret is well-hidden.

This was a nice attempt at Hitchcock, but I would say the runner got tagged out about 3/4 of the way between third base and home plate. Very close, but this is neither hand grenades nor horseshoes. So close doesn't count.

The cinematography was pleasant. This was shot in and around Cleveland, OH. There was a simulated sex scene. A very odd simulated sex scene. And one scene in which a priest is attempting to molest a lad. That scene and the prevailing topic of child predators really angered me. Not because they occur in the movie, but because I share Miss Meadows point of view that....well....that would be telling, now wouldn't it. So rather than spoil it, I will let you watch the movie and learn her position for yourself.",1508716800,4,1123,4.661616161616162

I love  black comedies where justice is served, for example ""Keeping Mum"", ""Bad Santa"", and not so comic such as ""Sur Mes Levres (Read My Lips) and ""Sling Blade"". I don't understand why it got such low ratings on Rotten Tomatoes, etc. From the opening scene the tone of the film is set: you get that this is a fantasy, not something to be taken seriously, totally implausible.  It's a feel good movie that you feel bad about feeling good about. And as other positive reviews have pointed out, the acting is great. I give it 4 stars because it's slow in parts.

6780150,2,B00OZOIETQ,"So awful. While Katie Holmes' performance is great, what a terrible movie she finds herself in. Instead of a vigilante like Batman who seeks out danger, Miss Meadows just keeps stumbling into the most unlikely situations that call for a vigilante, over and over again. In the first five minutes she has a gun pulled on her in broad daylight on a public street, and she shoots the guy as if it's normal. For her, it appears to be, because she also finds a gunman who killed a restaurant full of people and is just waiting around to threaten her so he can get shot. The script is so desperate to ex machina these situations that a kid practically tells her outright that he's been beaten, follows it up with desperation to get immediately to a church as if he had ""getting molested"" penciled into his schedule, and because she doesn't draw down on the priest then and there, he chases after her aggressively like he's begging to get shot.

The opening scene was implausible, but not impossible -- if the movie could've left well enough alone, it could've been about that interaction and the fallout from it. But the movie just wants to keep upping the ante of stretching credulity, seeing just how far you can suspend your disbelief. Don't waste your time with it.",1508457600,,1262,4.584070796460177

I enjoyed the reverse psychology of watching a quirky, yet capable woman who refuses to play any of the games expected of her by coercive, misogynistic men. In today's world where we women--on a daily basis--are losing our personal freedoms, it's refreshing to imagine a female 'superhero' who exists to right the wrongs perpetrated by men against women. I must admit to strongly disliking the use of the word 'vigilante' when describing Miss Meadows actions or rather, reactions. I find it belittling to call her a vigilante, because if this movie was made as an action flick, & the man who encounters evil & shameless men manages to inflict righteous justice upon them, well he would be called a 'hero' rather than a vigilante. Again, Hollywordless misnomer! Miss Meadows is a woman who stands up for her right to be free as a woman should be in a vicious world where cruel, evil men prey upon the defenseless & who most definitely deserve punishment.

6780230,4,B00OZOIETQ,"Both Miss Meadows and her story are original. Her tap dancing and discussions with her mother may seem irrelevant, but they prove otherwise. Acting by the principal characters, including several children is good. I thoroughly enjoyed this quirky video, but I give four, rather than five, stars for the writers' unconvincing depiction of her as unbalanced vigilante. They seem unable to come down on on side or the other.

Even in the heartland, her tap dancing, gloves, and socks might seem eccentric, but they are slim evidence of her being unbalanced.

What ultimately seem to have been imaginary discussions with her mother suggest a rationale for vigilantism, but being a vigilante takes more than inclination. In shielding her, the sheriff is less legally justified than she.  It is unclear what he knows of an unspecified number of killings in Dayton or elsewhere. He can't be aware, however, that in two, and arguably the third, recent, local instance she killed in self defense.",1507161600,3,986,5.074074074074074

This crazy, unique movie has that kind of feel to it. There's a little imaginative mystery about the whys of her manners, and some sweet tonic in the means of her justice and how she protects and serves children and neighbors while being outside the law. When she gets with the law, it'll make you smile.",1507075200,,443,4.55

I have never been a Katie Holmes' fan, but she seems to have really grown as an actress in this...it's like watching a different actress entirely.

Loved her manners and here 1960ish wardrobe. Cool and stylish, but yes there is some violence in it. They kept in pretty minimum, which is good for the feel of this movie. Some great lines in it.

6780369,1,B00OZOIETQ,"What could be more uplifting than a tale about a psychologically damaged school teacher who's idea of a good afternoon is shooting a would-be pedophile? Leaving aside all the absurd standard-for-Hollywood nonsense about tiny caliber guns having one-stop instant lethality while being pointed in the general direction of the victim, what we have here is an unpleasant stock-Hollywood schlock movie in which good guy guns are (by definition) good because they (by definition) reliably put down bad guys.

So we're in a moral universe that lacks real morality, which is not an uncommon place to be in Hollywood movies. What's different about this piece of trash is that the writer and director couldn't decide what sort of movie they were making. Was it ""Shooting Miss Daisy"" or was it ""Terminator Poppins?"" Well, in fact it's not really any movie at all. We understand from the very first phone conversation that the female protagonist is talking to her dead mother and is as mad as the proverbial Hatter, albeit rather more armed than in the Wonderland tale. It's not a charming-quirky movie. Nor is it a oh-she's-so-damaged-we-empathize-with-her movie, not least because (a) the character is clearly just a psycho, and (b) the acting is standard Hollywood-grimace-by-numbers. It's just, frankly, an awful mess all round.

Add to that the risible notion that the perfect slender angels in her class are supposed to be under-performing troublemakers from a low-income district and you get a sense of how little effort anyone bothered to put into this movie. I'm not clear, therefore, why they would feel anyone aside from the family of cast & crew, would bother to put in the effort to watch it.",1443312000,9,1693,5.042857142857143

""Miss Meadows"", well portrayed, and humorously so, by Katie Holmes, is straight out of (no, not Compton) that old school, sweet mannered, elementary school teacher mode. Except! She's got some issues and a pistol in her purse. She's a staunch believer in exacting justice where necessary, but the little darlings/munchkins love her so she can't be all bad.
Props, sets, locations, acting all good. A bit of a hyperbolic parody on all those Miss Manners types. Flash backs will start to explain her past and will be clearer by the end of the movie, but has she changed?
No subtitles, but Katie Holmes dances (sort of) and sings ""These Boots are Made for Walking"". Also, an unusual connection to the Polly Klaas event.",1439769600,,847,4.848275862068966

Then she starts a relationship with the town's sheriff (James Badge Dale) and her whole life gets turned upside down which leads her to face up to the past as the inevitability of the future looms ever nearer.

Now I rather enjoyed this `quirky' film, it has a sort of charm and is very stylish - especially Miss Meadows - she even has `clothes on sex', but is has been criticised for being right wing. The idea that there is only one way to deal with wrong doers and that is by taking a leaf out of Draconia's handbook.

The way it is presented does have a hint of unbeliveability about it and I thought it may have been a spoof like say `Super' nearly was. It though does not play for laughs or satire and is a basic relationship film and so does not mange to hit the right notes - which is a pity as everyone in it does a really good job and it is an easy and a short watch.

6780397,4,B00OZOIETQ,"Actress/writer/director/producer Karen Leigh Hopkins knows he way around kinky stories and she makes this little tale of a proper elementary school teacher who moonlights as a vigilante work on every level. It is refreshing to see a little romance mixed with a little madness and Hopkins understands the technique of mixing childhood responses to adult behavior with adult responses to childhood trauma and make it work splendidly well.

Tap dancing prim oh-so-correct in manners schoolteacher Miss Meadows (Katie Holmes) is not entirely what she appears. Well-mannered, sweet, and caring, yes, but underneath the candy-sweet exterior hides the soul of a vigilante, taking it upon herself to right the wrongs in this cruel world by whatever means necessary. When an armed man in a car threatens her, she kills him and goes tapping along the way home. When she walks in on a hot dog caf&eacute; and witnesses a mass murder of the client&egrave;le  she kills the perpetrator. When she observes child being abused by a priest, Bang! He is a goner. Things get complicated, however, when Miss Meadows gets romantically entangled with the town sheriff (James Badge Dale  hopefully all his gross tattoos are makeup) and her steadfast moral compass is thrown off, begging the question: ""Who is the real Miss Meadows and what is she hiding?"" For Miss Meadows, bad behavior is simply unforgivable, as we hear from her conversations with her mother (Jean Smart).
Holmes is terrific, pulling off a role that could be unctuous or saccharine or simply not credible. She is very well supported by such fine actors as Mary Kay Place, Jean Smart, Callan Mulvey as the perfect monster you love to hate, and little Ava Kolker as the child who knows and sees too much. Strong story, strong direction, strong cast  a movie that is not a great movie but a very good one. Grady Harp, June 15",1433635200,2,1868,4.939490445859873

What I liked: The black comedy was great, Katie Holmes was well cast, and her fashion was fantastic. What needed work: The relationship between Miss Meadows and Sheriff progresses very quickly, and seems contradictory with her whole demeanor. The relationship with her mother and what it actually means for her mental state could be fleshed out more. I was left asking: Was that Suri Cruise playing a young Katie Holmes (aka Miss Meadows)?

6780425,5,B00OZOIETQ,"They've promoted this film as ""Mary Poppins"" meets ""Death Wish"".  The reality is that there are only three victims as a result of Miss Meadows' marksmanship and they were all vile predators.  The film isn't particularly gory either.  You could probably get a PG-13 rating if not for one particularly exuberant lovemaking sequence.  Ironic isn't it?  The filmmakers afford Miss Meadows with a backstory that includes childhood trauma reminiscent of a certain caped crusader.  Katie Holmes is ideal in the title role expertly demonstrating the gray areas of her well scrubbed girl-next-door persona.  She seems to be channeling the dark angst that she experienced while being married to Tom Cruise.

6780437,5,B00OZOIETQ,"I don't consider myself a fan of Katie Holmes by any measure but her performance in this quirky dark comedy really impressed me. Holmes plays the title character, Miss Meadows, a psychologically troubled young woman who works as a substitute first grade teacher. Whilst beloved by her first grade students and capturing the heart of the local sheriff (James Badge Dale), Miss Meadows harbors a dark secret: she is a vigilante who kills off the scumbags in society.

What appealed to me here was the witty play of words throughout the film. Our heroine says old-fashioned things like ""toodle-oo"", and quotes proverbs and sayings from English classes long past our time. She has strange conversations with her mother, often awkward because of the overtly formal tone. Throughout the film, viewers get glimpses of Miss Meadows' past, told via flashbacks to when she was a little girl. Bit by bit, one is able to piece together what it is that set this beautiful, eccentric young woman on the path that she is on. The romance plot is sweet and unfolds almost like a fairy tale, the young sheriff portraying a knight in shining armor come to rescue the not-so-hapless princess.

If you like something different and not very Hollywoood, this little gem of a movie with all its quirkiness, darkness, and comedic bits just might be something you'd enjoy. I certainly did.",1425513600,11,1363,4.896103896103896

She blew me away with her singing of ""These Boots are Made for Walking"" over the closing credits. A subtle romance, with a moment of bouncing on the bed, fully clothed. (The movie is unrated, but would probably be, at the most, PG13.) And the mild sex drove the plot. Anything more written would be a spoiler.)

6780443,3,B00OZOIETQ,"Hmmm.  I really wanted to enjoy this movie.  And I did.  Sort of.  Miss Meadows is an enchanting tale of a psychologically damaged vigilante school teacher.  Sounds great, right?  But the writers really dropped the ball.  Not enough vigilante justice.  They talk about her exploits more than they display them!  And when she gets up close and personal with a villain, she is useless.  What!?!  How do you kill so many bad people without having to defend yourself!?!

The acting is incredibly good.  The characters are quirky and interesting.  The love story is weirdly compelling.  Unfortunately, Miss Meadows fizzles out.  More than once I contemplated watching TV instead.  The pace is SLOW.  Conversely, when the action starts it is FAST.  No satisfaction.  I want to see pedophiles suffer.  Not hear a gunshot and imagine them dead.  One potential rapist gets a suitable surprise.  So there's that.

Miss Meadows had the potential to enthrall us the way Dexter did, but she is not taken advantage of in any way.  The writers created a fascinating character who does very little.  Yes, she almost gets caught.  Yes, there are a couple unsettling twists.  But this movie is not a keeper.

6780462,2,B00OZOIETQ,"I remember seeing the trailer for this movie and thinking that it would be pretty good. Now having seen it I'm left thinking how much better it could have been. In trailer form this seemed like a role tailor-made for Katie Holmes (who also executive produces), but as time went on the magic wore off and she seemed too mature to be playing a person who is possibly just passing as someone much younger than she appears. For this kind of story to work, you have to believe in the main character and the situations she is put in and for me the believability wore off rather quickly. I never believed that Katie Holmes was as nice as her character was supposed to be and it always seemed like she was putting on a show rather than being a genuine person. It also didn't help that her acting (and the rest of the cast) wasn't great either. It had a great opening scene (which was in the trailer) but it was all downhill from there. The characters and story didn't go to any unexpected or interesting places either. Everything in the story was fairly predictable, and it also never manages to have a consistent tone or attitude toward its characters. Still, for what little vigilante justice was doled out by the titular Miss Meadows, it wasn't too bad in that regard. This was a movie that would have worked better in short form than the 88 minutes which already felt like it was stretching the concept thin. If you're a diehard Katie Holmes fan (what few of you there may be), then this might be worth a rental. For everyone else, if you've seen the trailer, you've already seen the best parts.

First killed as shown in the movie was on a hotdog diner (awesome speech with the Mass Killer). Second was the priest who was a child molester (which was REALLY gross by the way, I was shocked and was alarmed that it does happen anywhere).

She drives an immaculate 1956 Nash and has flashbacks to a traumatic childhood experience, of which we get glimpses, until it is explained in the end.

For those who like quirky dark comedies, welcome Holmes. Remember ""permanent is temporary"" and ""truth is relative."" Miss Meadows loves to turn phrases. Sometimes it is not apparent, so watch this production when you can pay attention to the dialogue.

In other words it's ORIGINAL, unlike the same stuff churned out by studios one after another.  Ms. Holmes throws herself into it completely and is remarkable.  It's not perfect - what movie is? - but it's got a very distinct voice and POV.  Check it out.",1417564800,10,362,4.358208955223881
6780494,3,B00OZOIETQ,"Mainly because it is Katie Holmes...also, because of the element of Surprise!!!  I had NO idea of the character she played!",1417564800,2,123,4.857142857142857
6780495,1,B00OZOIETQ,Turned it off after 15 minutes.  Really bad!,1417564800,3,44,4.5
6780496,3,B00OZOIETQ,Kinda boring...,1417478400,,15,7.0
6780497,2,B00OZOIETQ,"My headline says it all.  It was hard to sit for this movie.  But, I did like the ending and I like Katie Holmes.  I just kept hoping it would get better.",1417305600,,154,3.75
6780498,4,B00OZOIETQ,"This was a dark movie, but it was not depressing.  I liked the fact that she was much like a ""Mary Poppins vigilantly.""",1417305600,,119,4.173913043478261
6780499,1,B00OZOIETQ,"I rented this because I thought it would be as good as ""Serial Mom"", but it falls short. Instead of being smartly quirky, it's just plain ridiculous. Don't bother.",1417305600,5,163,4.655172413793103
6780500,5,B00OZOIETQ,"I would very much recommend this movie. Her character is extremely likable and adorable. The story line is a little goofy, but the sweet way Katie Holmes character develops a relationship and her excellent performance along with her dancing really entertains from start to finish.",1417219200,18,280,5.2444444444444445
6780501,4,B00OZOIETQ,"I enjoyed this bizarre little gem.  Katie Holmes did an excellent job a portraying a strange, eccentric and dangerous young woman. Too bad the world doesn't have a few Miss Meadows lurking around!",1417219200,,196,4.9393939393939394
6780502,2,B00OZOIETQ,"The stupidest movie and very, very slow.  Totally unbelievable and smarmy.",1417132800,,74,5.7272727272727275
6780503,5,B00OZOIETQ,The best story I've seen in a long time. It was full of surprises. All terrific acting... and I was not even a fan of Katie Holmes before this.,1416960000,18,143,3.9655172413793105
8685891,5,B00OZOIETQ,Surprised how much I liked this quirky movie,1533686400,,44,4.625
8685892,4,B00OZOIETQ,"Katie Holmes delivers an excellent performance in a flawed story. The idea of vigilante justice has been around since the dawn of civilization however this scripts downfall is the lack of explaining why ""Miss Meadows"" does what she does. We learn too late in the film that her birth mother was a victim of a drive-by shooting . . . this lack of filling in the blanks makes her character less than believable without the background information, we the viewer are left to wonder how we feel about this character and the movie.",1533427200,,524,4.645161290322581
8685893,4,B00OZOIETQ,"This is a really engaging and original movie, very funny at times, very sad sometimes. It had my attention to the end. I like Katie Holmes - a fellow Ohio gal, but mostly because she has a lot of depth in her performances.",1532304000,,222,4.186046511627907
8685894,1,B00OZOIETQ,One of the worst story line and performances of all time! Wasted 87 minutes of life.....,1532217600,,88,4.5625
8685895,4,B00OZOIETQ,"Fantastic acting. Fun, quirky, and just the right amount of dark. Leaves you wanting to see more!",1531785600,,97,4.764705882352941
8685896,4,B00OZOIETQ,Interesting movie. Definitely wasn't what I was expecting. However the movie works. Even with the unbalanced character. Way better than some of the other movies I have seen on prime.,1530662400,,182,5.1
8685897,5,B00OZOIETQ,Who ever wrote this movie had a great sense of humor. This movie is so zany and off the wall its funny. It really is death wish meets Mary Poppins. A movie about a gun totting school marm who goes around righting wrongs with her pistol.,1530576000,,236,4.1521739130434785
8685898,4,B00OZOIETQ,"Don't take yourself too serious while watching this.
It's nothing but fun.",1529712000,,74,5.25
8685899,3,B00OZOIETQ,Love Katie Holmes.  Just didn't really care for this movie.  I only made it about 2/3 of the way through and then ... just ... nope!  Can't do it.,1529625600,,146,3.9655172413793105
8685900,4,B00OZOIETQ,"This is a slightly off beat, but fun movie.  My wife and I watched it and we both liked it.  Katie Holmes does a wonderful job as Miss Meadows.  The plot keeps you interested and it has a great ending!",1529193600,,201,3.975
