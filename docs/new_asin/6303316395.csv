7843822,5,6303316395,"I remember when Disney started with the dreary Princess line.  It began with these tapes I think.  I avoided them like the plague, until my sister rented this tape one night.  I had been repulsed by an Ariel tape she rented earlier, but when the actual program for this started I was instantly hooked on what would be an excellent episode.  Here's the descriptions from the back of the box.

""The Garden of Evil"" is no bed of roses for Jasmine, Aladdin and their friends. A plant monster plucks the Princess from her room and takes her home where she'll be the prettiest flower in his garden. But Jasmine's too clever to be stuck with a thorny problem like this! This is a wonderful episode.  The story, the animation, the music, the atmosphere; everything's just perfect.  A+

It's ""Elemental My Dear Jasmine"" when Saleen, a menacing mermaid, magically traps Jasmine in an underwater grotto! Then Saleen transforms her own tail into legs and walks right into Aladdin's arms!  It was during this episode I realized the truth: These were just episodes of the show in a pink package!  I had seen Saleen's second episode, Shark Treatment on TV before this, so I was like ""It's that evil mermaid they fought in that other one!""  They are both great episodes.  A

So there you have it, a good collection of episodes despite the girly cover.  If you like the series you'll want this tape.",1365465600,,1382,4.633744855967078
7843823,5,6303316395,"This glittery VHS tape features 2 episodes of the Aladdian TV series that are quite entertaining for elementary school kids regardless of gender. Girls will love Jasmine and boys will love the action. The first episode ""Garden of Evil"" focuses on more action and story development because the monster looks quite scary (his voice too which sounds like Slade from Teen Titans) and the plot is actually well-done. It's like Beauty and the Beast and was surprising that the misunderstood villain actually died in a kids rated show. The second episode ""Elemental my dear Jasmine"" is more comedic and is a nice beach-themed episode with a b""""chy mermaid or siren that seems like an evil Ariel...or an evil Attina. The theme of the episode tests Aladdin and Jasmine's love like in the episode ""Eye of the beholder."" There are a few funny moments in scenes with the Genie, Iago and Abu and I like the way they defeated the siren, who we presume died like the Arbitus (the plant villain in the first episode) because she was blasted by a submarine cannon. Epic! These tapes are out of print by now but are a great addition to any Disney Princess collection. Hopefully I can put this tape on my shelf soon.",1314489600,,1197,4.677725118483412
7843824,4,6303316395,"If you're an adult fan of the Disney full-length Aladdin movies then I doubt you'll like these shorter animated segments.  However, if you're a young Aladdin or Jasmine fan (such as my 4.5 year old fraternal twin daughters), then this video will most likely be a hit.  The running time is 45 minutes and the video contains 2 stories.  P.S.  Robin Williams does not do the voice of the Genie but nonetheless, the actor who portrays the Genie is adequate enough.

The following is a description of the stories from the backside of the video jacket:  1.  ""The Garden of Evil"" is no bed of roses for Jasmine, Aladdin and their friends.  A plant monster plucks the Princess from her room and takes her home where she'll be the prettiest flower in his garden.  But Jasmine's too clever to be stuck with a thorny problem like this!  2.  It's ""Elemental My Dear Jasmine""  when Saleen, a menacing mermaid, magically traps Jasmine in an underwater grotto!  Then Saleen transforms her own tail into legs and walks right into Aladdin's arms!

P.S.S.  The plant monster is intially somewhat scary but eventually turns out to be just a misunderstood, decent creature (resembles an oversized green bean!).  If your kids like Scooby Doo, then they shouldn't find this video too scary.",1153526400,7,1268,4.774193548387097
