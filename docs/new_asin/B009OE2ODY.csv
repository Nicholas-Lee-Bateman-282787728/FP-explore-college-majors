5358850,1,B009OE2ODY,Won't be buying. Tired of the old movies and shows not captioned for those of us with hearing issues. What a shame!,1352505600,13,115,4.2727272727272725
5358851,5,B009OE2ODY,"For me this has been a great undiscovered classic.  I got hooked on the show in 2011 at the age of 50 after catching a rerun late at night on some religious station.  Obviously they were filling up their late night schedule.  After six months they removed ""Sea Hunt"" from their programming and I began to miss it. So much that I ended up buying a unauthorized DVD set off eBay.  So when I heard that all four seasons of ""Sea Hunt"" were being officially released on DVD I preordered all four with absolute sheer delight!

This is one of the smartest purchases I've ever made. Each season comes housed in their own gift box-like box, and the prints of these shows are -- in my opinion -- gorgeous.  I learn something new about the ocean or sea life in general with each episode. I think Lloyd Bridges is such a marvelous actor that I've been watching his old movies. He knows his stuff!

I'm currently half way through season three of ""Sea Hunt"" and I am savoring each show. It's also been great to see up and coming new actors like Bob Conrad, Larry Hagman and Leonard Nimoy, just to name a few.

I'm thinking of buying a second set of ""Sea Hunt.""  That's how much I love this show!",1352246400,21,1181,4.3076923076923075
5358852,4,B009OE2ODY,"This show was popular when it aired, and I can see why. It is really great that they released this so it is available at last. The set comes in a box with two dvd cases. In one the dvds are stacked on a single spindle, and the other separate holders. The picture quality and sound are fine. A nice thing about this show is a lot of episodes, with about 40 per season. I say about, because one episode was missing, and the one with Larry Hagman at that. They fixed it though, and replaced the disc. All seasons available, and affordable, is another plus.",1351555200,21,553,4.226415094339623

Half-hour thrills under water that ring the changes on basic diving and scheming plots that appear inexhaustible.

5358902,5,B009OE2ODY,"...but I swear I still know half of that half-dozen of different themes used in this show. One such recurring theme sounds like it's influenced by Grofe's ""Painted Desert"" movement from his ""Grand Canyon Suite"". But it seems to have in turn influenced John Barry a few years later in the music he did for the underwater sequences in the Bond film ""Thunderball"". This simple half-hour adventure series was singlehandedly responsible for bringing the term ""Scuba diving"" to the mainstream lexicon. It even spilled out onto other venues, such as one funnybook I owned where a character was retrieving banana peels from a pond, explaining to his curious father that he was ""skin diving"". This was despite the fact that Navy frogmen had been around for years. But sure enough, kids who lived nowhere near the ocean suddenly took an interest in diving--mask, flippers and all. Including me, and the closest I ever got until just a few years ago was the Great Lakes. Somehow I couldn't imagine Mike Nelson ever diving a few miles off Irondequoit Bay near Rochester NY. I hadn't noticed that Ivan Tors was the creator of this series--I knew him from his later series ""Flipper"". My favorite ""Sea Hunt"" episode of all time was ""The Raft"" as the season finale for Season 2, in which Mike Nelson is sent to get rid of a sunken freighter which had been used as a floating ""site office"" for a construction company, with a dangerous supply onboard of what Nelson called ""nitrotol"", an explosive which my late father (an Army rather than a Navy vet) insisted did not exist. Dad also scoffed at the idea of a single freelance diver like Nelson tackling such a project when it was more the job of the Navy or Coast Guard.

Still and all, it took me back to my junior high days when ""Sea Hunt"" was my primary must-watch before it was replaced by ""The Fugitive"" years later. Watching the very first episode of this Season 1 about Mike rescuing a test pilot who had to ditch his experimental jet at sea, I saw one familiar face in the supporting cast. Among the guys in the control center for that test flight was Whit Bissell, who would later play an Air Force general at NORAD in the film ""Fail Safe"". Bissell also appears in the aforementioned ""Raft"" episode in the following season as the head of the construction company, sort of establishing himself as a predecessor to Leslie Nielson.",1411257600,,2370,4.656324582338902

5358916,5,B009OE2ODY,"I remember as  a kid imitating the Mike Nelson dive. When we went out on our boat in the summer of 64 we would do a roll dive off the side of the boat. We called it the ""Mike Nelson dive"" When I took Scuba lessons at the YMCA as an adult my instructor was not impressed when I did the roll dive off the side of the pool. He said that is not the way to enter the water, you could lose your gear. I said, "" That's the way Mike Nelson did it.""",1407628800,,440,3.6315789473684212

5358948,5,B009OE2ODY,"This was Lloyd Bridges first TV series. The others were ""The Lloyd Bridges Show"",""Joe Forrester"" and ""The Loner"" a western made in the mid-sixties. This series is about an ex-Navy frogman who hires himself out for any kind of work above and below the sea. A great adventure series with plenty of action and excitement. It ran for four seasons and all are released on DVD. The artwork on the boxes for each season is excellent. For the first two seasons Mike Nelson [Bridges] would take on all kinds of work like rescuing a pilot who's jet has crashed and sunk to the bottom of the ocean and  is trapped inside,to finding sunken treasure,locating nose-cones of rockets with sensitive information contained within,mines that are still active and could destroy a whole town if it explodes and people trapped inside sunken vessels while trying to recover what valuable items are aboard. From the third season on he mostly worked for Navy intelligence.
Gust stars include:
Leonard Nimoy [Star Trek] Mr Spock
Robert Conrad [The Wild Wild West] Jim West
Ross Martin [The Wild Wild West ]Artemus Gordon
Larry Hagman [Dallas] J.R. Ewing
Also Jeff and Beau Bridges. Lloyd Bridges sons.
Sea Hunt was filmed in black and white from 1957 to 1961
This is a refreshingly addictive series.",1377129600,,1273,4.8663594470046085
5358949,4,B009OE2ODY,"In the 60s, this program was fantastic programming considering the technologies available at the time. The story lines are sometimes a bit simplistic but a generally good story is crammed into a half hour segment. Viewing the programs about 50 years after first release you are hit by how much society and societal mores have changed - smoking and women a two big ones. After a few minutes you don't notice it is all in B&W.

Sea Hunt was one of my after school TV programs in the mid-60s. While some of the plots and special effects appear simplistic and even cheap sometimes, the series was new and cutting edge when it first came out. It was also likely one of the biggest advertisement for sport scuba diving -ever. I know it was a big influence for me to get certified and equipped.

I'm not disappointed with my purchase. I bought seasons 1-3. So far, I've only finished season 1.",1374796800,,886,4.53125
5358950,4,B009OE2ODY,"The transfer is excellent; very good quality. And it's nice to 'escape' back into the '50s and '60s for a while and see the boats and cars of that era. The stories are interesting, too.",1374019200,,185,4.314285714285714
5358951,5,B009OE2ODY,Great old tv series in black and white.  You just gotta love Mike Nelson.  Very good audio and video quality.,1372982400,,109,4.4
5358952,5,B009OE2ODY,"I always liked this series as a kid, if for no other reason than it has been reran since time began and was so different. I always loved the music in it, and I recall when I was going to school so many times in much younger days, seeing the closing credits as I was going off to school. You just wanted to hop onboard with Mike and leave the school scene. Such a marvelous closing to the show, a boat going off into the sunset.

That was primarily where my affections rated with the show, but something came over me. It's called dvd. It's still in reruns over here as I speak, but then I recalled how modern tv cuts into playing time, so I couldn't resist for the cheap price, plus it sounded like everybody thought the picture was real good.

You know one thing that's so good about these old shows, if you're fortunate as I am and hadn't seen them much in the past 20 plus years, you forget all the plots and it's like new tv all over again, and so much better than the new stuff for the most part!

Having said all of that, what really got me about this show having watched season one over again on this dvd set, is that this show had a lot better plots than I remembered. I may like this show twice as much as I did as a kid, and part of that is because I can concentrate on it without commercial interruption. It also helped that a lot of my viewing was in some fairly dimly lit situations, so even the room didn't distract me. Here I am in my fifties, and this show had me on the edge of my seat at times, even though I knew Mike would pull through since there were 3 more seasons.

Well I backed up what I have written here and went ahead and ordered the next three seasons. And to think you're getting so many episodes per year too. It's really hard to beat the price and you get so much for it. It's also nice to get into this series with a completely different viewpoint than as a child. Oh, BTW, Mike Nelson is a big time safety freak, so when he gets smart with somebody I like to guess whether he will get a fat lip for it. Just too much fun!",1372896000,3,2055,4.029411764705882
5358983,5,B009OE2ODY,Watching this series as a 7-year old kid got me interested in a lifetime of snorkeling and scuba.  Good quality B & W.,1372723200,,118,4.130434782608695
5358984,4,B009OE2ODY,"A show from my childhood that brings back fond memories. The picture quality is very good. A young Lloyd Bridges does a good job as Mike Nelson. I'm about a fourth of the way through the season. There is 35-40 episodes in the set. The episodes are about 25 minutes long. It does a decent job of capturing the culture of the 50s including cars, hair styles, clothes, etc. The stories hold up for the most part. I enjoy seeing future stars in their early bit part roles.

5358989,3,B009OE2ODY,"I remember enjoying Sea Hunt as a child.  However, I realized by noting the dates the series was produced that the viewings I remember were after it had completed its run and was in syndication.  I remember watching it in the afternoons during summer school vacations.

Ivan Tors, just like Irwin Allen(Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea) was fond of using stock footage rather than film the actual story line.  This causes many odd inconsistencies throughout the series.

For example -- Mike Nelson dives off the boat wearing one tank. The underwater shots show him with three tanks.  The closeups (of a submarine) show him again with just one tank.

Another example -- He is using a small mini-sub for two people.  He is alone in it heading to pick up a Russian scientist defecting.  The views of the sub show 2 people in it BEFORE he picks up the scientist.  Also, he mentions that the problems with the sub have been corrected but the same shot seen earlier of the top hatches for the sub are show open even when heading back to his ship.

It is politically incorrect in several ways.  First, for a scuba diver to be smoking - even before the days where the dangers were as well known, was obviously poor judgment.  It's also dangerous if done near the tanks!  Mike did not do that, at least.

Mike wants to destroy ALL killer whales with no regard to the species as it is or for what that would do to the marine ecology. You remove a predator and the prey will balloon in population causing much damage!

There are actual errors that even in those days should have been easily noticed.  The long views of the killer whale were a killer whale.  Even with black and white, the white markings were visible.  The fin and sharp snout were clearly seen.  All closer views of the whale were a beluga whale with darker color and a fin attached to it's back.  The snout of the beluga is clearly not that of a predator.  Further research says that there has never been a case of a wild killer whale attacking and killing a human.  Humans are too small for it to consider them.

I think what bothers me most that I did not remember as a child is that these episodes end without completing the stories!  What happens to the gold on the barges?  What is in the safe from the submarine?  What happens to the ""hardhat"" divers?  Nothing is shown,  the story just stops!

With the errors and limited story lines, this show would never make it today.  It's a shame.  Given the time it was done, even.  It could have been so much more!

I remember it fondly from childhood but I don't think I'll buy any more.  I did get my money's worth out of it just looking for errors!  I've rarely seen any show with so many of them!",1370736000,3,2704,4.370221327967807
5358990,5,B009OE2ODY,"As good as I remember. Good informative short stories about skin diving, the ocean, swamps and lakes. Lloyd Bridges is excellent as Mike Nelson, a moral, law abiding man who constantly strives to do the right thing. Always a hero in each episode with a lesson to the viewers on fun and dangers of the waters. Most of his dangerous encounters involve bad men and women, but there are episodes of natural dangers in the ocean, lakes and swamps.

5358992,4,B009OE2ODY,"Sea Hunt the television series,originally ran for four seasons starting in 1958. Detailed minded folks will notice that two of the eps on the first disc are pilots;one dated for 1956 and the other for 1957,contrary to the popular notion there was only one. ZIV obviously had shopped this series around and got no takers for a couple of years,so decided to do it itself in the syndication market and it succeeded beyond anyone's expectations. I remember the series being cancelled,and couldn't figure out how such a show that was so popular could be dropped. It was only in later years when I found out it was the dwindling syndication market that was the culprit,as the three big networks really started to dominate the airwaves and minimize the syndicated market.
If you haven`t seen this show,it is remarkable it got traction at all. Consider the problems associated with photographing actors underwater,or their stunt doubles. Not only getting a camera down there,but finding the right clear conditions,the weather to worry about,a believable script week after week,trying to act in a believable manner(exaggerated but believable gestures)while so buoyant( no easy task)and one cannot just yell `cut,it`s a rap`,can they? Then there was their lead actor,who would have to have at least some working knowledge of scuba equipment and diving in order for the audience to truly ``buy it``.Somehow Ivan Tors and his production company managed to over come all these obstacles and more.
Lloyd Bridges had a prolific career in films from the mid 30s onwards as a supporting player and even though he had been blacklisted in the early 50s by the McCarthy crowd,it didn`t last long. He was trained in diving by Zale Parry and Courtney Brown in /56 after being awarded the lead in the show. Brown would become his stunt double,but by series end Bridges was doing a majority of his own work underwater. Bridges was very fit and he,importantly,looked and acted like a pro around the water. He handled his equipment like he had been at it for years. One can truly say no one,or show,was a better spokesman for the sport of skin diving,before or since,than Lloyd Bridges and Sea Hunt. Bridges` affable personality really sold this show,like no other. His glances into the camera made you feel he was talking just to you,and you alone.
Every ep started out with the credits and Lloyd suiting up,then there was about a minute prologue to set the tone of things to come. Then came two acts of melodrama,and finally the end where Lloyd would talk directly into the camera and say to us to join him next week for another``exciting adventure`` of Sea Hunt,or other similar phrase. One line was especially poignant and always added to the authenticity of the show. He would say that scuba diving was great for young and old ``but it can be dangerous,so know your sport well and don`t take any chances``.Safety was a  recurring theme in all the eps of Sea Hunt. Bridges`character was an ex Navy frogman and his expertise was widely known and respected. In the show he would always caution other characters about safety,and he himself would rarely if ever take a chance. Have  I mentioned the music? From the opening to closing credits,and every minute in between,the show was filled with the most compelling music. All intended to enhance the various moods presented in the dramas and,as a result,our own viewing experience and reactions.
Besides Mr. Bridges,I have seen a young Larry Hagman,Leonard Nimoy and a VERY young Jeff Bridges in these shows,so far. As you watch,many of the same cast keep reappearing as different characters throughout. The shows are filled with vets of the screen and other supporting actors from TV of the 50s and 60s. Many shots were used repeatedly and one shot I recall in particular didn't match. It was an ep about a killer whale. They used stock footage showing it on the water from a distance,but for close ups they first used a shark,then a pilot whale. Hey,this was just the first season and they didn`t have endless pockets of money to use;they had to be thrifty.
Now to the DVDs themselves. The DVD cases(there are two,volumes one and two),are housed in what I can only describe as a solid topped cardboard box. You lift the lid to get access to the cases,like you would lift the lid to a box of chocolates. I have never seen DVDs housed this way. The first DVD keepcase has three DVDs pancaked one on top of the other. This was a concern to me and I have since put two in one double holding snapcase as a precautionary measure..But I must say none of the discs exhibited any scuffs or scratches. The second volume has two discs,one in a plastic movable holder and one in a solid holder built into the case. The picture? Well,I must say this is a revelation. In case you didn`t know,MGM are the folks that have held Sea Hunt in their archives all these years. The prints they have supplied to TGG are absolutely tremendous. They are clear and crisp,generally,and many look liked they were filmed yesterday. My grainy B&W set in /58 never gave this good a picture!
In conclusion,if you`re a Sea Hunt fan THIS is the set to own. Accept no imitations. A wildly popular TV show in its day,LLoyd Bridges/Sea Hunt is finally back after a long absence and in better shape than ever.

The theme music for this show is like no other music I've ever heard. I think it's one of the greatest themes in the history of television. Someone posted a recording of this music on youtube, but the performance wasn't right. The notes were all there, but they did not get the phrasing and tempo right. It was like they were speaking a foreign language with an accent. When you hear it on this DVD set, you'll know how it's supposed to sound.

I was just old enough when this show originally aired that I could appreciate it, so watching this show now is partly a matter of revisiting that period of my life as young boy. I'm grateful that this show is available to me now.",1367366400,,860,4.36875

5359011,5,B009OE2ODY,"Review applies to all four volumes.

Of those Ive watched so far, the video quality is much better than those that were available several years ago.  Apparently these came straight from the originals.

Its great that the entire series is provided.  Commercial-free.

The occasional inane story lines, and the sometimes naive presentations of scuba and marine life, simply add to the charm and nostalgia.

These are especially enjoyable for scuba divers.  If you're an old-timer, its fun to reminisce.  If you're a newer diver, you get to see what the gear and techniques used to be.  If you're not a diver, these shows might make you want to become one.  Many of us got into scuba primarily because of this series.

If you're neither a diver nor an incipient diver, the shows are good, light entertainment from the late fifties.",1365465600,,828,4.8428571428571425

The show is a bit campy, but if you loved Sea Hunt, or old time scuba diving, you're sure to love this show. Overall, a well worthwhile purchase and I highly recommend it.",1364515200,,498,3.99

5359045,5,B009OE2ODY,"I vaguely recall having watched Sea Hunt as a very small boy. My main recollection of that experience is the show's haunting theme music, which evoked both adventure and danger.

For the next fifty years, I never saw another episode and completely forgot about the show.

About three years ago I started watching Sea Hunt on This TV and quickly got hooked on it. Since it was on at about 5 a.m. I recorded it for later viewing. Unfortunately it didn't occur to me to archive those recordings until after the broadcasts stopped (6-2013 update: they have since started up again). I tried watching the first season episodes on Hulu but I didn't enjoy that experience.

Imagine how thrilled I was when I discovered that Amazon was selling studio-authorized Sea Hunt DVD's! I purchased all four seasons immediately.

I have held off writing a review until after viewing all 39 episodes of Season One.

Packaging: There are two DVD cases inside the box, labeled Volume 1 and Volume 2. Volume 1 contains three DVD's, and Volume 2 contains two. The DVD's are labeled Disc 1 through 5. Disc 1 contains seven episodes, the other four contain eight each, for a total of 39 episodes.

Video quality: I am using a Magnavox ZV427MG9 DVD Recorder and VCR connected via component video (Y Pb/Cb Pr/Cr) to a Vizio E320VP LCD HDTV (32"", 16:9 AR, 720P/1080i, 1366 x 768 resolution). Using component video produces a partial-screen, undistorted image. If I use the HDMI ports the picture is full-screen but is stretched horizontally, and no amount of fiddling with the aspect ratio setting on either the player or the TV will correct it. Perhaps this is normal for a DVD transfer of an old TV show when viewed on an HDTV. The back of the box says ""4X3 1.33 full frame.""

  The video quality is outstanding. The picture is sharp. Very sharp. Almost high-definition sharp. You can count every hair on Lloyd Bridges' head, and see every scratch and ding on his air tanks. There is a beautiful range of tones from black to white. The sunlit outdoor scenes, both above and below water, seem to glow. I often find myself pausing the playback to admire the beauty of the picture. Another TV show from that same period--Perry Mason (or at least the butchered syndicated version being broadcast by ME TV)--looks like a murky, muddy mess in comparison. I used to wish that Sea Hunt was in color, but now I'm not so sure color would be an improvement. (To get an idea of what a color version of Sea Hunt would look like, watch Flipper, currently being shown on Antenna TV.) The people who watched Sea Hunt when it was originally broadcast had no idea what they were missing.

I compared the picture quality of these DVD's to the Sea Hunt recordings I had made from This TV broadcasts. Surprisingly, there wasn't much of a difference. The DVD's were a little sharper, but that's it.

Sound quality: Typical late-1950's mono, low-fidelity TV sound. There's not much that TGG could do here, given the limitations of the source material.

My Disc 4 contained the same error that other reviewers have mentioned, namely that episode 3, which should be ""The Hero,"" is instead a repeat of episode 1, ""Pressure Suit."" I emailed Michelle Weiman at TGG (michelle@thegargroup.com) and she said they will send me a corrected Disc 4 at the address I provided.

It's a shame there are no interviews of Beau or Jeff Bridges, or stunt divers Zale Parry and Courtney Brown.

As for the show itself, the plots are simple, the characters few, the action almost non-stop. It's an entertaining--and unique--show, with scuba diving, underwater knife fights (cut his air hose, Mike!), boats, airplanes, helicopters, the occasional fake submarine, and attractive women (for example, the stunningly beautiful Jan Harrison) rocking swimsuits and wetsuits. Has any other TV show ever shown a pistol being fired underwater?

Lloyd Bridges carries the show. Mid-forties, six feet tall, lean but muscular, with a full, thick head of hair and rugged features, Bridges was perfect for the role of Mike Nelson and he attacks it with gusto.

If you're a Sea Hunt fan, this is a must-have. As Mike Nelson would say, ""If you like Sea Hunt, then why don't you get these DVD's, huh?""

3-11-13 update: I received the replacement Disc 4 today, two weeks after I contacted TGG. It was shipped on March 6 via UPS Ground. It looks identical to the original defective Disc 4. Episode 3 has been corrected.",1362009600,53,4429,4.768627450980392
5359046,5,B009OE2ODY,"Apparently there was an issue with DISC 4 of the SEA HUNT SEASON 1 in which there was a duplicate episode, however, TGG Direct has responded very well to this issue and will send a replacement disc.  The reply we received from:  michelle@thegarrgroup.com is as follows:

8543338,4,B009OE2ODY,"""Sea Hunt"" was an iconic show from the early days of TV. While most viewers today are used to SCUBA diving, helicopters, cool boats, and tense rescues, TV and movie plots hadn't been so overloaded with those elements at the time. In ""Sea Hunt"" these adventure elements were mostly new and unusual elements in the show, and I certainly can't remember much in the way of TV before ""Sea Hunt"", or even in films, that featured SCUBA diving.

Of course, ""Sea Hunt"" came from a simpler time, and the episodes are 30 minutes in length. That means that the writers had to keep the plots basic and on target, without a lot of room for subtlety. In most of the shows that involve any mystery, you'll most often see the solution coming right away. So in these ""Sea Hunt"" episodes, you'll find some plots that are simplistic, but there are also some that are as rich as anything you'll find in today's shows.

The science of diving as presented in Sea Hunt informed its viewers pretty well about the dangers and details of SCUBA diving, but it did twist some things for dramatic effect at times. Still, shows like Sea Hunt and the Jacques Cousteau documentaries gave me (and a host of others) a life long interest in the sea.

This was Lloyd Bridges' signature show. No matter what else he did, he was always remembered as Mike Nelson in Sea Hunt, similar to the way Tom Selleck will always be identified with Magnum PI. And he was believable and solid in the role, his dialogue and voice-overs always sounding calm, authoritative, and sensible.

This DVD presentation is more than acceptable. It does show some grain and minor film damage on our widescreen set, but overall I feel safe in saying that it looks better than it did on TVs of its era. On all of these older shows, make sure you set the TV to display them in 4:3 ratio. They'll look much more crisp that way, and won't look stretched.

Whether you're a mature viewer like me who was a fan of the series as a younger adult or kid, or a younger viewer with an interest in these classics of early TV, I can heartily recommend this product both in content and quality.",1503446400,5,2115,4.4689119170984455
