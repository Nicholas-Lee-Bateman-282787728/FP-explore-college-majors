8309248,4,B001HNVDRS,"Sad, and very well acted.

A young French institutional psychiatrist
gets wrapped up in the life of a patient - a mute middle age woman, who
seems to have no identity. One day the woman disappears, and the doctor
follows her to a small island off Iceland, where it turns out she has a
husband, a child, and even a job. They know she's disturbed, but they
just deal with it as part of the way things are. This pushes the
psychiatrist to ever more obsessive behavior, as she tries to get the
woman back to France to continue treatment.

The first third - the woman's treatment in France, and the growing doctor/patient
relationship is the strongest part of the film - mysterious and
touching. On Iceland, things feel a touch more predictable, and the
young doctor's near madness seems a bit of a stretch. But the culture
clash is still fascinating. A film I'm glad I saw, even if imperfect",1294963200,2,887,4.503105590062112
