7961243,4,B000065RTW,"be advised,there is nudity,but if your curious as to what ""else"" a man can do with his manhood,this DVD will solve all the guess work for you...highly recommended if you like natural funny stuff",1331942400,,194,4.735294117647059
7961244,2,B000065RTW,"At first I was laughing at what these guys where doing on stage with there own deeks. However, i stopped laughing when it would cut to behind the stage stuff and the guys on tour and how the tour was not the success they hoped it was.

By the time this thing had finished, i had stopped laughing, there is only so many tricks and gags you can do on this subject that can keep you laughing. It seemed like they have a total of about 15 tricks they do, and it's stretched in time with bits and pieces thrown in between to make it seem like more then a 10 minute show.

If you can rent this or find it on youtube you will see it's not really something you would want to own and watch again. It's much like the Mr Methane DVD, there is only so many fart jokes you can do before it begins to smell like the same old ^&%$#",1214265600,,816,3.9393939393939394
7961245,3,B000065RTW,"The very idea of calling this art is laughable! Puppetry of the Penis has none of the elements of art. This show features two men playing with themselves in front of an audience. Entertaining? Yes, but the lowest common denominator type of entertainment. The show has been an international hit, but that doesn't make it art. It merely shows that many people will buy a ticket to watch two men performing acts that most men got over by the time they reached adolescence. Classify this as a bulesque show, not art.",1167523200,,512,4.637362637362638
7961246,1,B000065RTW,"Puppetry of the penis - tackle happy, is nothing more then plain male infantilism at its best portrayal. If two women were shown doing vagina tricks, it would be instantly labeled as pornographic. However when two men do it, it is labeled as art. Who ever labeled this, as art clearly has no knowledge of what they are talking about? Art is something that captivates the eye with beauty in image and form.

This movie is nothing but a bore and torture to watch the full length. I got through the first 15 minutes and was fed up of the two lame dicks and not to mention their dicks too. Most people who buy this movie will most likely watch the first few minutes and then either through the movie into the garbage as this is all it is or ask for a refund from your vendor.

I returned my movie; I did not want to loose my money on something that is not worth it. Learn from viewer mistakes and save your money, if you purchase it, trust me, you will be in for a huge disappointment.",1113264000,2,981,4.212765957446808
7961247,1,B000065RTW,"What sounds awfully amusing ends up, well, flaccid. Two gents from Down Under show off the mastery of bending and folding and manipulating their ample appendages in an assortment of shapes. An evening of genital origami? Prick me when it's over.",1043280000,2,245,5.0
7961248,3,B000065RTW,"Be forewarned, for those who are purchasing this for the sake of full frontal nudity, be warned that this is art and not pornography.
The movie is a documentary on the efforts and hardships of Simon Morley and his traveling show, the Puppetry of the Penis. In terms of struggling artists, this is a great documentary to show how hard it can be to get a show up and running. Add to the mix, full frontal nudity and you can see exactly how hard it can be (no pun intended).
The show in question, of course, is Dick Tricks and it will generate a chuckle out of you. It will also make many men go home and try these tricks at home. If this movie can create some added fun in the bedroom then it gets stars galore, otherwise a good rental for documentary purposes, or a great film to sit with you friends and laugh quite a bit.",1035244800,16,822,4.176100628930818
7961249,5,B000065RTW,"OH MY GAWD!!!! How do they do that!? This slick video of ""organ origami"" is a hilarious account of Simon Morley & David ""Frendy"" Friend's act that premiered in Melbourne, Australia. These two well-endowed wonders twist their willys into all sorts of shapes from a hamburger, hot dog, snail, pelican, wind surfer, to the Eiffel Tower and Loch Ness Monster! YOUCH! I bet that smarts! Unabashedly and unshamefully honest, this duo does live on stage, totally naked what some guys only imagine or do behind closed doors. The DVD also includes a ""how-to"" chapter that illustrates the fine art of genital manipulation. Learn how to do the infamous hamburger, snail, 3 wood, and other wonders of willydom! This is a non-sexual presentation even though there is total male frontal nudity and genital manipulation. Presented in documentary form, this film recounts the story of the origins of the act up to present performances with road companies at major festivals throughout the world. Not for the easily-offended, embarassed, or faint-of-heart, this video is hilarious and leaves you wondering two things: 1.) How'd they do that? & 2.) What are they going to do next? A few re-enactments borrowed from ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"", shows Simon dressed only in a Silver lame cape standing on top of his Combi as Frendy drives through the Australian Outback and him and Frendy standing at the edge of King's Rock au naturel. A true camp classic, a great edition to the collection of rare and unusal DVD's....",1020902400,19,1505,4.976190476190476
