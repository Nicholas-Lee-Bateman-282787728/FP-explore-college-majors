638650,5,6303410863,"Haunting theme music and a maniacal killer who becomes the original Sandman, a Sandman who in my opinion is much scarier than the computer-generated buffoon in Spiderman 3.

This too often forgotten and hard to find horror flick is well worth the price of admission in spite of the somewhat overused ""abused child grows up to be a psychotic killer"" plot in modern movies.

Plenty of Voodoo thrills and chills await fans of the genre, as well.

Enjoy,

638651,5,6303410863,"True, the 90's didn't have as much great horror as the 80's and on down, but it did manage to spit out some good odd-ball horror every now and then.  'Sleepstalker' was one of my favorites growing up, and still is!  Who doesn't love a killer sandman as an idea for a horror film!?  I know I know we have Freddy but this is different.  For when this film was made, the CGI isn't bad and old-school make-up is involved as well.  A truly creepy looking killer!  Picture 'Clayface', one of Batman's enemies, and what all 'Clayface is capable of, that's pretty much what this evil sandman's powers are!  It's slightly better than most sci-fi channel horror flicks being made today.  Check it out and remember to just enjoy it for what it is!",1260316800,,736,4.440298507462686
638652,5,6303410863,"Sleeptalker surprised me and surpassed my expectations. This isn't your average B-movie, and it certainly deserves wider recognition and separation from the various straight-to-video flicks that are ignored by the typical movie-goer.

The plot revolves around a young man named Griffin (Jay Underwood) with an obviously troubled past. Griffin's parents (Marc McClure, Caryn Richman) were murdered when he was only seven years old by a serial killer known only as the Sandman (Michael Harris) -- a creepy scene we witness at the beginning of the film. Seventeen years later, when Griffin is a grown man, he seems to be leading a relatively normal life. He is looking for his big break in writing/journalism, and has a steady friendship (which, of course, is evolving into something more) with the lovely Megan (Kathryn Morris). But his seemingly normal life is shaken when he learns that The Sandman will soon be executed. At first, he's simply relieved and tries to brush it aside. But he'll soon discover that, as the tagline for the movie suggests, ""Evil never dies...it only waits to be reborn"". In his cell, the Sandman is given his last rites by a priest (Michael D. Roberts) -- who is actually a satanic worker of witchcraft. Through the dark powers that be, he grants the Sandman immortality, but only if he can kill Griffin within three nights. Griffin is his mortal link to this world -- a link that must be severed. This little bit of the story is actually a driving point behind the entire plot. A decently clever twist that pulls everything together by the end. So, after his death, the lullaby-singing sleep-stalker is reincarnated into a body made completely of sand. Yes, shapeshifting and such is made possible, but believe it or not, this aspect of the killer was brought to the screen in just the right way that it's not as cheesy as it sounds. And once he's back in his new form, it seems it's the end of the line for old Griffy boy. But he's not going down without a fight. Through the assistance of the satanic priest, as well as his devoted friend Megan who seems to be the only one who believes him, he's able to uncover the truth behind The Sandman and possibly put an end to all of the madness. But when all is said and done, is that truly possible?

Sleepstalker is definitely a cut above most B-flicks. Michael Harris dominated the screen with his terrifyingly realistic portrayal of one creepy-as-hell cinema-psycho! Also to my delight, the cast was not filled with wannabe actors that couldn't convince the audience with their characters. Most of the acting was quite impressive. And for the majority of the film, all of the behind-the-scene touches -- including directing, editing, cinematography, and a great score (with a haunting rendition of ""Sleep Baby Sleep"" by Teresa Straley) -- really aided this in becoming something worthy of five stars. There are plenty of great movies out there that aren't recognized because of the sterotype claiming B-flicks to be amateur and stupified, and Sleepstalker is one of them. Sure, you can't expect a blockbuster masterpiece hit, but you can certainly expect something highly entertaining from Sleepstalker. There aren't any special features, but the film alone is enough reason to pick up this DVD. It's worth a look for all horror buffs and even thriller fans.",1135641600,4,3336,4.881834215167548
638653,5,6303410863,"I remember watching this years ago...  I thought it was a decent film with ok acting.  And Mr. Michael Butts, Kathryn Morris' hit tv series is Cold Case--not Without A Trace!  ..just to set the record straight.  =)",1135123200,7,214,4.552631578947368
638654,4,6303410863,"SLEEPSTALKER surprised me.  It's an effective, chilling, if flawed, horror movie.  Give Michael Harris credit for a chilling portrayal of the Sandman, both before and after his sandy transition.  Kathryn Morris (who now has a hit series, WITHOUT A TRACE) has one of her early roles as Megan, the heroine.  Jay Underwood gets a little histrionic, but at least he puts everything into his role as Griffin, the young man who saw his parents murdered by the Sandman seventeen years earlier.  The direction is good and the cinematography very atmospheric.  Teresa Straley's haunting rendition of SLEEP BABY SLEEP sent chills up my spine for its sweet, yet ominous, overtones.

Effectively haunting, not gory, but spooky all the same.",1096416000,2,728,5.11864406779661

638656,5,6303410863,"I remember watching this when it first came it out. It scared the hell out of me. Even the lullaby scared the hell out of me. Basically because it was composed in miner keys. But I thought that it was an outstanding horror film. It's not quite original but it's good enough to scare the hell out of you.
The film is about a young boy named Griffen, who sees his parents killed by serial killer who calls himself the Sandman. Seventeen years later, Griffen has grown up to be a talented journalist. He feels pure relief when he finds out that the killer who murdered his parents is being executed. But what Griffen doesn't know is the Sandman performed this black magic ritual that will resurrect him into a horrific creature made of sand that can change his shape at will. The execution is performed and the sand-like killer/creature is resurrected and he sets out to end Griffen's life.
Like I said, this is not quite original but it is an excellent film and it will make you have every light on in your house.",1069632000,10,1011,4.440860215053763

7845556,3,6303410863,"Not the worst movie I've seen but there are plot holes that make it seem as though someone just made up the story as they went along. Late in the movie Griffin and The Sandman are revealed to be brothers, with a 8-9 year age difference. Yet Sandman appears to be close to 40 when he murders Griffin's adoptive parents and attempts to murder Griffin before being arrested. Early on Sandman is established to be a serial killer who randomly selects his victims, yet its later  revealed that he's actually after one person (Griffin aka his brother) who by the way he could have easily killed back when he was an infant at the time he murdered their father. The Sandman also appears to know too much and too little at the same time about his intended target Griffin. He addresses him by name after killing his adoptive parents yet doesn't know enough to not have to murder countless other families thinking that Griffin is the child. It just makes him look a bit inept and what is he a serial killer that randomly targets people or just a really bad hit man that kills nearly everyone else  until he gets to his intended target?",1415491200,,1124,4.478048780487805
7845557,4,6303410863,"A serial killer breaks into the house of 7-year-old Griffin, murders Griffin's parents, and is about to murder Griffin when the cops burst in and stop him.

Seventeen years later, the serial killer is finally executed in the gas chamber -- but then the returns as Sandman, aka, a Sleep Stalker endowed with supernatural powers. (It seems the filmmaker couldn't decide what to call this monster, as he's referred to as a Sandman, even in the end credits, but the movie's title is Sleep Stalker.)

This Sandman's supernatural powers include turning into sand. This enables him to pass through cracks and keyholes and air ducts. (Much like Dracula can turn into mist, and pass through the same.)

Griffin is by now a 24-year-old ""freelance writer."" He sports a goatee and spends much time in a funky coffee shop owned by Megan, his photographer girlfriend. It's all so slacker! So hipster 1990s! So&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friends/dp/B00B1LN8WY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friends</a>! Griffin even has a tweed hipster cap to go with his goatee!

Anyway, this Sandman has three nights to kill Griffin. If Sandman succeeds, he gets to keep his supernatural powers and serve Satan on a high level. If not, he simply dies. I guess.

Naturally, Sandman fails to kill Griffin on the first two nights, leaving only one night left. So instead, Sandman kills some other people along the way. This IS a horror film, so there must be a decent body count. Sandman kills them in creatively sandy ways. At one point he fills a woman's bed with sand, then pulls her under the sand so she suffocates. Other times his arm turns into pointed glass (sand turns into glass if it gets too hot), enabling Sandman to stab his victims.

This is a low-budget film, but it has its strong points.

* Some of the set decor and lighting are admirably expressionistic, as though inspired by 1920s German expressionism. An early scene has a house (looking like a cardboard model) on the edge of a sandy desert, supposedly somewhere in Southern California. Cops chase the serial killer ""outside,"" on a set that is only darkness and sand and flashlights, lending the scene an eerie surrealism.

I admired the use of primary colored lights in the coffee shop at night, those bright reds and greens coming from some unknown source.

And also the stark minimalism of the gas chamber, which was only an expressionistic clock on a wall, some stone-faced witnesses, and the serial killer breathing some colorfully lit gas.

The serial killer's boyhood bedroom was also appropriately depressing, aided by the ""colorful"" children's toys: the creepy clown painting, the pink record playing on a toy record player, the wooden plane hanging from the ceiling.

* The music did much to support the film's themes. Like the set decor of the serial killer's boyhood bedroom, the music was depressing despite being ""child appropriate."" A slow tune of ""Sleep Baby Sleep"" which I expect was written expressly for this film.

* Michael Harris did an excellent job as the Sandman. Love that way he intones those childhood nursery rhymes before killing each victim, talking slowly in a deep baritone voice.

* Michael D. Harris plays a ""Satanic preacher,"" and he too does a great job. Really creepy with those blind eyes, and the way he delivers his lines.

The overall story is typical horror fare. A monster is working against the clock, given a set time limit to accomplish his evil deeds. (Sometimes it's the hero who's working against the clock; sometimes the monster.)

It occurs to me that Griffin is a real idiot, as is true of many horror ""heroes."" It's been established that Sandman can NOT endure water. Megan is safe in the shower. The Sandman is unable to harm her, because his fingers ""break off"" upon contact with water. And even though Megan doesn't know this at the time, both she and Griffin figure out this weakness in the Sandman before the third night.

So why doesn't Griffin just spend the third night in a running shower? Or in a swimming pool? Instead, he and Megan run and run from the Sandman, while he gives chase, sandily passing through keyholes and cracks and air ducts.

SPOILER:

The Sandman is ""killed"" in the end. But in the final scene, we see the Satanic preacher sifting through the ashes, about to resurrect the Sandman. I'm guessing the filmmaker was hoping that Sleepstalker would become a lucrative franchise, the Sandman the next Jason or Freddy. But it was not to be. This is the only Sleepstalker film ever made.

The lighting and set decor shows some real effort. That, and the music, and Michael Harris, place Sleep Stalker a notch above your typical 1990s direct-to-video horror fare. The DVD is FULLSCREEN, as it was likely created from the VHS version, but still enjoyable for forgiving horror fans.",1415232000,,4842,4.9335793357933575
7845558,4,6303410863,I remember watching this as a kid on HBO or something late night and it scared the crap out of me so 10 years later here I am purchasing it and man I have no idea why I was scared lol. Not scary at all.  Anyways everything about this movie is average except for the killer which I think is great and well acted by this guy. The special effects are decent as well. I'd actually recommend this to anyone into slasher films because it is kinda different and it's very cheap to purchase. Also the vibe of the movie kinda feels like a Candyman movie for some reason.

7845560,2,6303410863,Wow this movie I really wanted to like because the description of this sounded a bit intriguing. a serial killer calling his self the sandman going around killing people then pouring sand on them as his trademark but the plot just falls apart and the special effects in this movie are almost comically bad. the one thing I did like about this move was the music in it.there a really creepy dark lullaby that get played through out the movie the helps set the tone of the movie but outside that this was just a really cheesy bad movie that really puts the B in B movie.,1350259200,,568,4.317757009345795

7845562,3,6303410863,"Frankly it's a brilliant device for a low budget horror flick, sand when he appears and kills, and water is his nemesis, you can't get any cheaper than that, but the storyline and execution is just elements of Shocker, Freddy, and Candyman, it's cliche low budget horror based on a decent premise, and unlike those other films this has like no replay value. The originality ends with the concept, it certainly isn't worth the 4 and 5 star reviews others have given it, I think 3 stars is generous, a decent effort, but the film just falls short and plays out like a genre rip off. The Sleepstalker is no Wishmaster.",1301529600,,615,4.54954954954955
