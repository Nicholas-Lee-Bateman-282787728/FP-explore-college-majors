The chronic pouty smirk from ""Pretty in Pink"" and the confident smirk from ""Boston Legal"" are gone. In its place is a character who plays by the rules and doesn't make himself up to be something he is not... which is precisely the role of John Cusack. I kept thinking that with a bit of legerdemain, one could easily have reversed the actors in the roles (See Face Off) and it would have been just as good a picture, since Spader could have played it with his smarmy character and Cusack would be on the up and up,  Not a 'great' movie, but a good viewing for the election year.",1470614400,,678,4.175572519083969

428290,5,6302130131,"""True Colors"" is a political drama genre film where ambition is pursued at all costs, and integrity is overshadowed by deception.

Peter Burton (John Cusack) at first appears to be a young highflyer, but it quickly becomes obvious he projects a false image in an attempt to be of elite standing. His college buddy Tim Garrity (James Spader) comes from affluent stock, yet he is humble enough, but Burton hijacks every advantage he can from Garrity.

The narrative is stacked with Burton manufacturing chances with whatever it takes, and selling out any person to get to where he wants to go, which is to be a Senator.

There are plenty of plot surprises and whilst Garrity always seems one step behind Burton, his greater wits and decency as a person provide him with some notable advantages over Burton.

Both Cusack and Spader bring their characters to life with energetic authenticity.

428351,3,6302130131,"This movie is kind of like ""Wall Street"" but in a political, Capitol Hill setting as opposed to a stock market, banking setting. I like the concept of two friends starting out at the same time and one turning corrupt to gain votes on Capitol Hill while the other is not interested in power but more in doing the right thing, joining the Justice Department.  But I think the performances were not very believable by any of the actors. I don't know if it is his youthful, bratty, baby face demeanor but John Cusack was just not convincing as the corrupt, soul-less and power hungry villain they made him out to be. He totally could not pull that off. I actually had sympathy for him and didn't think he was that bad at all. In fact, he was not doing anything politicians in his place haven't been doing for the past 200 years. Politicians need to remain in office and that requires money and the entities with money and lobbyists stationed 24/7 in DC will be the ones influencing representatives, not the common man who elected them. In exchange for their money, therefore, politicians often have to do things that go against the very nature of the democratic process. Now right or wrong, that is unfortunately the reality of the situation and a serious short coming of the system. As Spader said, that is just the nature of the beast. For anyone to think otherwise is naive. So what Cusack was doing wasn't even that outlandish. He just made the mistake of getting caught.

The love story was total bogus too and the chemistry between Spader, Cusack and the female love interest (Imogen Stubbs) was non existent. She was terrible, did not possess an ounce of spark or charm and felt more like a stand in than an actual character one man would betray his best friend for. And he doesnt even love her. In ""Legends of the Fall"" the love the two brothers had for the female lead was palpable. Here it felt insincere. Also, don't men have this unwritten honor code that you don't mess with your best buddy's girl?

The rise and downfall of Cusack's character, Peter Burton, was also not very convincing. Unlike ""Wall Street"" where we got to witness quite intricately the rise and then demise of Charlie Sheen's character with all the emotional struggles, ups and downs and changes that come with it on all levels of his life, none of that transformation was visible here.  These are supposed be two friends, one of whom climbs the social ladder quite steeply and taps into the power corners of DC while the other remains his innocence and the struggle that ensues. But none of that was visible here or even convincingly played out. In fact, you cannot tell when Burton's rise begins and when it ends.

These are fantastic and quite capable actors so it must be the script and directing as I did not feel that these two truly inhabited their roles and the desired effect (Cusack = villain, Spader = attorney goody shoes, woman = biggest love of their lives) was just not reached. I found Spader's character to lack the kind of luster and ferociousness I know he can bring to his roles, and Cusack seemed more like a misguided, lost college boy with puppy eyes than a ruthless manipulator who gets his way. All these ""disconnects"" lead to the deliverance of an unconvincing, stale story. While overall I think it is an entertaining movie for a lazy evening of cheesy early 90s movies, I think the writers and director missed the mark on nearly all accounts.",1314576000,,3449,4.6016260162601625
428352,3,6302130131,"This is supposed to be a political movie about two friends who take different paths and how this affects them. Playing against type, John Cusack is the amoral schemer who starts out lying about his family (he claims to be rich when he's actually working class) and then graduates to letting air out of tires in order to ""rescue"" senators. James Spader gets to be boring. Sadly the corruption never reaches much above the level of favors and leaked stories concerning Cusack's father-in-law's alzheimers.

This makes for a tedious little morality tale as self-righteous James Spader watches as Cusack steals his girlfriend, manipulates people and finally wins for senate. We don't exactly know his positions on any issues or why he wants to be in public office in the first place. All we know is that he's idealistic enough to mouth off to a senator at the beginning and then getting money from skeezy dudes on yachts in the middle. There's some case where Spader is trying to entrap him, but I don't get it.

There are so many shots of Spader and Cusack looking at each other with an 80s movie saxophone playing that you would be forgiven for thinking that this is a gay romance movie.

The real problem with this movie is the lack of historical perspective. We don't get why anyone wants to vote for Cusack beyond the fact that he might remind them of Lloyd Dobler. Nor do we see why it's a big deal that he's taking kickbacks. This movie was made shortly after the Reagan Revolution complete with Iran-Contra and a very pro-business platform. After this film came out, Bill Clinton would all but brag about his scandals. Yet these fairly tame scandals bring down Cusack and he is supposedly doomed? Hardly. In New York, Charles Rangel just won by a landslide despite being under investigation for such a wealth of malfeasance that one of the first orders of business was to publicly censure him in the House. Over twenty years of flagrant law breaking and he gets a slap on the wrist. Yet Cusack has some unethical meetings with sleazy guys and his career is over?

428356,3,6302130131,"This political thriller was a solid film with many flaws. The film which spans nearly a 10 year period between two friends and a girl was a bit of a hard sell. The core actors in the film were magnificent! John Cusack (who I will proudly admit as being one of my favorite actors) and James Spader (another magnificent actor) had awesome chemistry as two best friends.

  Then the flaws begin. Spader who seems like an extremely intelligent person should have caught on to the underhand tactics his ""so called"" best friend was doing. However Cusack and Spader nail the roles so it makes it a bit easier to watch the film.

  The story is a bit of a cautionary tale that examines what one person could and would be willing to do to excel. Peter Burton (Cusack) is the prime example of this person who wants to do right but gets clouded by thoughts of the limelight and begins to do underhanded things that would give him the upper hand to achieve his goal. He pays no mind that he is hurting the people that love and support him and eventually will fall fast and hard.

  This film tries to tell that story in a bit of a stoic attempt. The story was a bit predictable and watered down but it is hard to overlook the magnificent performances from Cusack and Spader. The ending was a bit absurd but this is not real life folks.

  Cusack and Spader were eager to move beyond the typical teenage roles they were playing and this was an evolution for them as they were able to show a bit of their acting chops. If you are a fan of Cusack (which he has many of) then this film is definitely worth checking out!",1238025600,,1603,4.306666666666667

The Brat Pack actors are certainly a talented bunch. Everyone has a favorite. For me, it's a toss-up between James Spader and Anthony Michael Hall.

John Cusack was mesmerizing back in his early-days. He was a teenager, but he looked, sounded and acted very adult for his age. ""The Sure Thing"" put him on the map and ""Say Anything..."" made him a household name.

But while Crowe's ""Say Anything..."" was obviously a great movie, it was both a blessing and a curse for Cusack, who has rarely played anything else in his career. I know, I know. He's been in countless other movies. But ""a rose by any other name..."" His character, no matter what the movie, is essentially always Lloyd Dobbler.

Spader sometimes played other types besides the oily Steff from ""Pretty in Pink."" His typecast-breaking turn came when he played the lead in this movie.

But I know Cusack can do more. I keep waiting for him to. Which was one of my guilty pleasures of this movie.

The story and plot are the right out of the old fable about the rich man and the poor man who come together and create something special... and then the rich man betrays the poor man and casts him aside. And the poor man plots to take revenge...

Another big twist that ""True Colors"" has is it's twist in typecasting. Cusack specializes in playing sharp, calculated, smarter-than-average teenager... who's heartbroken and devastated... and is desperately trying to win back the girl. Here, Cusack plays a character who's as smart as the heroes he usually plays, though here he uses his intellectual gifts for evil instead of good. His goal is usually to win the girl's heart. Here he betrays the girl (and his close friend) in order to get what he wants.

And Spader usually plays blue-blooded, silver-spoon fed, upper-class yuppie scummy villains. Here he's still a rich blue-blooded yuppie. But a hero, who uses his financial connections to right wrongs and do just.

The two meet the first day of law school where there's a fender-bender and brief scuffle. Cusack angrily attacks Spader violently and blames him for the whole thing and the two have to be pulled apart. Later on, things get worse as they discover... their assigned to be roommates. Cusack smooths things over by admitting the whole thing was his fault. You'll see why.

Afterwords, the two form a fast friendship and Spader even uses his financial backgrounds and connections to help Cusack out. Later we find out that Cusack is lying about his background to fit in and the payoff feels lifted out of a soppy, moralizing and insipid sit-com where today's moral is... ""If you have to be someone else to get a friend, then they're really not your friend.""

Richard Widmark is great as well as the ailing senator who sees potential and ambition in Cusack after he sees what looks like Cusack doing him a favor, little realizing how dangerous Cusack is. Spader girlfriend considers breaking off the relationship for Cusack who can keep her bringing in big cash. She doesn't realize that Cusack is willing to betray her too, in order to get what he wants.

One of the major problems is that their true colors are obvious from the beginning. Cusack is clearly someone not to trust from the start and Spader all but actually walks on water. Another is that the movie is too thin. There isn't enough entry.

The movie... skims too much of the surface. And Spader's big plan and the finale is pretty tacked on.

The movie aspires to be a movie like ""Patriot Games"" or ""Citizen Kane."" But everything is routine and predictable and there are precious few new touches to this tired formula. If screenwriter Kevin Wade could've given the script a bit more depth and discovery into these characters and done a little more with the formula, this could have really been something special. The cast does what it can, but inevitably, a good cast can only take a movie so far. Still, it's worth seeing just for Cusack turn towards the dark side and Spader as a yuppie with heart.

Oh, well.

428382,4,6302130131,"A wonderful early 90s film that still holds on to the lure of classic 80s movies.  It a pretty good story about two young men and the paths they take out of law school.  If your a cusack or james spader fan it is a movie to see.  In addition if you ever attended the University of Virginia Law School or as an undergraduate, it is a must see.  The first 20 minutes or so of the movie takes place on grounds.  You will recognize many places including, the rotunda, mincers, michaels bistro, brown college, the tracks by wild wings and more.",1168300800,,539,4.245098039215686
428383,3,6302130131,"If you decide to watch ""True Colors"", I would advise you to watch about the first 30 minutes and then turn it off.  The opening of the film is great, and will have you really gripped, but the movie will soon turn very familiar and you'll lose interest.  By the end, you will almost laugh at the ridiculous conclusion.
The two main stars are James Spader and John Cusack.  They meet the first day of law school at UVA when Cusack smashes into Spader's car on move in day, starting a huge fight between the two.  No points for guessing that they will end up roommates.  They overcome this tough start and become good friends.  Cusack comes from rather humble roots, to say the least, while Spader has a somewhat higher pedigree.  In fact, he is dating the daughter (Imogen Stubbs) of a senator (Richard Widmark).  It doesn't take long before Cusack is lying left and right about his background, trying to impress everyone.  This continues to Capital Hill, when both young men are hired in Washington.  Spader is an assistant DA, Cusack works on Widmark's staff.
From here, you can guess what will happen.  Knowing that Cusack is such a rotten apple, nothing will be a surprise.  He will double cross his ""friend"" so many times, and in so many cruel ways, that it's implausible that Spader could even stand in the same room with him.
I won't give the story away, but I will say that the end of the movie, when Spader gets his ""revenge"" is so corny and unbelievable, I would rather have had him pull out a gun and just shoot him.  That would have made more sense than this.  All in all, the film starts out great and will ultimately leave you cold.",1069891200,,1644,4.454849498327759

428385,2,6302130131,"True Colors stars John Cusack and James Spader as law school buddies on very different career trajectories.  Spader plans on going into the Department of Justice and resigns himself to serving the public.  Cusack, on the other hand, is an extremely ambitious politician.  I bet you can tell where this situation is headed!  Despite their differences, they remain friends, even after Cusack steals Spader's girlfriend from him.
The movie tries to examine issues of power and corruption.  Unfortunately, the plot is so stale and obvious that it fails to add anything new to this arena.  Spader and Cusack are fine, but Imogen Stubbs, as the woman they both love, is terrible.  She's a Brit playing an American, but her accent creeps in far too often, which is a huge distraction.  I'm a big fan of John Cusack, but this movie is definitely one of his lesser accomplishments.",1058918400,,872,4.884353741496598
