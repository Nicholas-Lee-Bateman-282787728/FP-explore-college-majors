3011283,5,B000Y1NNH2,"Like other reviewers have said, both 1 & 2 are addictive.  Baby Babbles and Elmo aside, my daughter has no interest in television.  These two videos practically put her in a trance!  Since she was 6 months old, she's been giving her undivided attention to these shows and since about 9 months babbles along with the people in the video.

She's a year now and still isn't really picking up words yet-just the sounds.  However, we do communicate slightly through the basic sign language, which decreases her/our daily frustrations and sets her up for success when attempting to communicate her wants and needs.

These videos are worth the price for the hours I've gained during the past 6 months to get some work and chores done for myself while she is having fun learning.

Be advised though, this is a video which really only works if you reinforce the exercises often and integrate them into your daily communication with your child.  Babies may be entertained by the show but the learning begins with your interactions.

This is a great present for new parents!",1206057600,,1063,4.7650273224043715
3011284,5,B000Y1NNH2,"Both Baby Babble DVDs have tremendously helped our late-talker. This is the best money we've spent. Our daughter insists on watching the entire video, even the parent tutorial. Much better then the Baby Einstein video series.",1203206400,,225,5.277777777777778
3011285,5,B000Y1NNH2,"We have both Baby Babble 1 and 2 and they are both amazing.  They have helped my 19 month old, speech delayed daughter immensely.  Compared to all the other DVD's it does deserve more stars than one can give.  THANK YOU for making it!!!!",1201305600,,237,4.340909090909091
3011286,5,B000Y1NNH2,"This is the best video for speech out there in the market. The two ladies did an excellent job in enhancing speech for the children. My 2 yr old is speech delayed and i can already see the improvement in her babbling and she picked up a few words and signs after watching the video over and over.
would highly recommend this product and look forward to more baby babble series.",1201219200,3,377,4.323943661971831
3011287,5,B000Y1NNH2,We have the 1st one and my kids love it. They love this one just as much and they have learned so many new words because of it. My son is always yelling for me to put in Baby Babble 2 he loves it. My 18 month old twins copy the words and the signs they are learning so much from it. I highly recommend this sequal.,1200700800,,314,3.701492537313433
3011288,5,B000Y1NNH2,"This is a very good follow up to the original Baby Babble.  The first one was very helpful for our speech-delayed two year old.  We like it so much that we pre-ordered this one from Amazon when it first came out.

The DVD has 4 sections.
1. The main video which focus on objects/words with P, B, M sounds. All of which are introduced and sounded out through pretend play, toys in action, etc.  It makes the DVD more ""interactive"" than just watching flashcard style presentation. After several viewing, our son started to repeat the words and also do pretend play with his toys.

Also, interjected between the video clips of toys and pretend play are the two speech pathologists showing how to make ""P"", ""B"" and ""M"" sounds with their mouth.  These two ladies have gotten an updated hairstyle and a lot less ""stiff""/serious than the original video.  This is a great improvement second times around.

It also introduce some basic concepts like colors (Purple, Blue, etc.) and counting (1, 2, 3).

Overall, the video is about 30 minutes.

2. The main video is follow by a parents guidance section which the two speech pathologist describe methods that parents can use at home to encourage their child to practice P, B, M sounds at home like blowing bubbles or on the cotton ball.  There are some excellent advice here.

3. The third section shows the two speech pathologist using sign language and sound out some main objects/concepts (Thank you, please, more, music, etc.) show in the video.  This is a good section reinforce the main video.  The sign language section might be more helpful for younger toddlers/babies who may not be able to sound out the words.

4. Finally, it shows all the toys and their manufacturer featured in the main video.  We have found a few toys we like from this video and have subsequently purchased it for our son.

Overall, I highly recommend both Baby Babble 1 and 2 to parents who wants to share more educational videos with their kids during TV time. This is especially helpful for parents with children who may be speech-delayed.",1200614400,94,2063,4.701949860724234
3011289,5,B000Y1NNH2,"Just wanted to warn all prospective buyers that this video is seriously addictive. Our 29 month old toddler just insisted watching this 6 times in a  row!!!

3011290,5,B000Y1NNH2,"Awesome, wonderful and fantastic!  My 21 month old daughter LOVES baby babble one & two.  They're her favorite dvd's by leaps & bounds.  Great learning tools & still entertaining, for little ones!  I really can't say enough. These ladies are truely knowledgeable! Deserves more than 5 stars!",1198454400,5,291,5.127659574468085
3011291,5,B000Y1NNH2,"Our child  has a minor speech delay and his speech therapist recommended these dvds. Since he watches about an hour of TV daily we switched to this and it has really helped. Over the past 2 weeks he has begun to use new sounds and words from the dvd. At first he just watched, now he will  shout out the words. For example, when the balloon comes on the screen , he shouts "" balloon"" before he even hears the word used. These dvds use the same techniques that our speech therapist uses. It will seem dull and dry but our toddler loves these videos and they are helping him to use more words and sounds.",1491436800,,602,4.181034482758621
3011292,5,B000Y1NNH2,This whole DVD series helped my son SO much. We knew something was wrong at his first birthday when we saw other one year olds saying words and our son wasn't uttering anything yet. He was just pointing. We started speech therapy and got all three of these dvd's and boy did they help. It got to the point where he came home from daycare everyday and asked to watch these videos. He imitated what he could and started saying more words and sounds. The format just captures their attention so easily and holds it for the entire video.  He's almost three and still asks to watch them once in awhile and we have almost conquered his speech delay.  I recommend them to everyone now and will use them from birth on for future kids.,1490745600,,726,4.37037037037037

We have 3 videos and my son who's been in speech therapy for half a year has made progress ... and ALL of the progress he's made can be related back to these videos.  We will keep going to speech therapy because I'm too afraid to stop... I just wish it was effective for us as these videos.  If they made Baby Babble volume 155 I'd buy it.

It captivated his attention every time and slowly but surely, he started using his words along with the video. And day by day, we saw him using these words throughout the day in ""real life""! Now that he is speaking more, we have leant these DVDs out to some friends whose son is a bit delayed.

Some people have complained in the first videos about the women in the video not being very animated. They definitely took the feedback from viewers and fixed it. I saw a major difference between Baby Babble 1 & 2.",1470355200,2,614,4.293103448275862

3011321,5,B000Y1NNH2,"We LOVE the Baby Babble DVDs!  Our 19 month old daughter is still backwards in her car seat & we do shows in the car as a treat to prevent crying.  She immediately talked along with the show & quickly was repeating words they said, then shortly after started to say words before the show did (ie puppy on screen, says ""buppy"" before the show says puppy).  She really enjoys all baby babble shows, and doesn't watch any other TV.  She cries when we've tried other shows- I think they move too fast/are too busy.  The simplicity & developmental appropriateness of Baby Babble make for the perfect learning show for toddlers!  This is my 3rd Baby Babble purchase, I also have a copy of the first edition which my now 3 year old loved & my nephew loved as a gift too.",1443916800,,763,4.338028169014085

He was 2 when we bought the first baby babble(I HIGHLY recommend that as well!!), and barely spoke 5 words, wouldn't make sounds or repeat anyone. He watched this and for the first time ever, started trying to mimic the speech therapists in the video. He now has the whole dvd memorized and talks non-stop!!

I noticed changes after the first time she watched it. She was making repetitive consonant sounds she'd never made before and shaping her mouth in preparation for vowel sounds. It was amazing. The video switches things up to keep it interesting, but after a while you start to notice the pattern and what it's trying to do for the child. It is great!",1428537600,,479,4.517241379310345

Have really liked them. He mimics everything they do in the videos and stays completely focused on the show! There were other reviews criticizing that it wasn't texhnologically up-to-date and other criticisms just as that, but I have found that it is very simple, which is just what he needs right now. Simple, yet entertaining, and helpful with his speech and language growth. It teaches sign language as well as word formation and sounds. A parent tutorial helps explain how u can expound on your child's language development at home also. I think these ladies have done a fine job- just wish they were a bit longer in length- only because he gets so much out of them! Well done :)",1425254400,,846,4.572368421052632

My son is non-verbal, but in just a matter of weeks, has picked up several of the signs taught in the DVD and also picked up several new sounds.  This DVD has been an amazing help to our son's communication and understanding!  My husband and I find the video to be bit wierd, low budget, old fashioned, etc, but who cares what we think--our son LOVES it.  The video has accomplished more in a week than our speech therapist accomplished in a year.  For those with kids who are autistic, developmentally delayed, speech delayed, you should definitely buy the set.  The video captures the attention of even those with limited attention spans by using spinning and light-up toys.  The video is also set to music.

3011359,5,B000Y1NNH2,"Not sure what it is about these videos compared to any others but for some reason these are the only videos that my 22 month old son is trying to mock and repeat the words and sounds he sees & hears. I began to worry around 18 months when he only knew a few words (maybe 5ish) which had been the same ones he'd had since around 14-15 months and I didn't see much increase or any attempt to try to mock or repeate after me ever. The few words he had he just said on and off but when I ever said words he acted uninterested in learning them or trying to say them. So I started him watching these videos which I had previously bought & around 22ish months he began trying to say almost everything he saw the sounds, signs and noises although not always right he was super interested and finally trying and with repeated exposure I'm sure will become more clear. I have tried other learning DVDs and he may watch a while but never has he tried to speak after them as he does the baby babble DVDs so I believe these DVDs are awesome and even if ur child doesn't start trying right away after a couple months later I tried again and he picked right up trying! So I'm happy with the baby babble dvd collection and hope for more!!",1411171200,,1222,4.138655462184874

I notice a huge change in him within a couple of weeks.  He is now 28 months old and saying over 100 words and is talking all day long.  These video's made such a difference.  I wish I would have got them when he was born.  They teach you how to help your child speak.  My son has went to speech therapy and the video's do the same thing but better.  Also they can watch them all the time.  They are a great value and I would recommend them to anyone.  Cory and Amy are awesome!!!!!!!,1409011200,,657,4.0625

He began with Baby Babble 1 at 3 months, Baby Babble 2 at 6 months, and he is now 10 months and will be starting 3 when it arrives. The thing is, he still loves the others. He smiles when Amy and Cory come on the screen. They are very educational for baby and parent. I feel it taught me things I can be doing to help speech development and gives ideas for the future if any speech issues arrive. My son recognizes the 'milk' sign, and we are working on the others. After watching these movies I noticed my son trying to imitate sounds he heard probably around 4-5 months of age. He says mama (by 8 months), and by 9 months when shown as ball will say baaal, not quite working the 'l' out yet but he is on the right track thanks to these videos teaching him and me. I would highly suggest these videos, and will be buying them for friends as they have babies. I foresee my son watching these for a long time, they are by far his favorite!

3011376,5,B000Y1NNH2,Although these look to be filmed in someone's spare room it doesn't matter - the content is awesome.  I started watching these with her during the afternoons when I get home from work.  One night she was having trouble getting to sleep and I was at a loss so I started one of the Babble videos and she settled right down into my rocker with me.  I've now incorporated these videos into my child's bedtime routine.  I thought of it more as something to help her off to sleep.  Boy was I wrong.  My now 18 month old has been watching these since she was 12 months.  She watches a video a night and stays up for the entire thing.  She picks up the signs and sounds quickly and will do them with the video and sometimes before they can even sign or say it.  At the end of the video she turns to me and says night night and closes her eyes.  This is an awesome feat for a little girl who has major sleep issues.  I believe in these videos wholeheartedly and am ready to purchase more anytime they come out.  Thanks!,1401148800,,1010,4.149484536082475

I love how it reinforces what we learn from therapy, many of the parent tips are exactly what we were told in our therapy session.  The sign language is an added bonus.  My daughter loves them, is entertained by them when she learns, but also likes to show off when she knows something they show on the video too.

however my one piece of advice to anyone concerned about speech is please do not get all stirred up if ur child is not talking at 2...thats just the way some kids are...my second child started talking at 2.5 and i was absolutely okay with that because i had seen how his brother talked after 2.

3011410,5,B000Y1NNH2,"My child has been watching the entire Baby Babble series since he was about a year old. He is 17 months old now and many of his first words (SPEAKING words, not just sign language) have come from watching these videos. Words like baby, daddy, mommy, up, down, out, more, truck, please, thank you, all done, eat, and countless others. The videos are designed to hold the short attention span of young children, and they definitely do. The intervals of music, incorporation of sounds, talking, simple objects, etc. ---all of those are specifically directed toward babies and toddlers. In my opinion, this series is better than Baby Einstein, Brainy Baby, etc. for the older baby/young toddler. It might be ""too educational"" for the really young baby. But, from 9 months to age 2 1/2 or maybe even older, I would say this series is THE BEST out there for speech, learning, and ""quiet time."". The series even focuses on certain letters like p,b, and m or t, d, n which directly coincides with the appropriate level of speech that a child is capable of learning as he/she grows. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ENTIRE BABY BABLE SERIES (There are 3 in the series.) Oh and as an added benefit, the videos are quite calming for the parents and the creators' approach toward teaching the concepts is actually quite fascinating.  A nice break from some of the ""annoying"" shows and DVDs that are out there for kids. And an overall great way to expose your child to language/learning.

3011421,5,B000Y1NNH2,"This is a must have if you are a mother like myself with any concerns about your infant or toddler not speaking by the age of 18 months. My son was recently diagnosed with having Autism and a severe speech delay. I can't begin to express how sad I felt when I found this out, so I immediately started searching for anything I could do to help him at home. When I came across the first Baby Babble I bought it and with amazement I watched my son start to talk, it was the only thing I would let him watch on TV for a week straight for a 30 mins or so, but that's all it really took. My son went from barely saying dada to UH OH! blowing air from his mouth in a funny way, something they teach the kids on the DVD, and so much more. I was so excited that the next month I purchased this DVD and now he says up, down and he has learned most of the sign language from both DVD's , he says yes and bye bye now. All I can say is if you are worried about your child not speaking, please invest in these DVD's and really sit down everyday and work with your child and I promise you in less than 2 months you will see a tremendous change. It was truly a blessing for me and my son.

3011440,5,B000Y1NNH2,"I have a 3 year old who didn't seem interested in talking until she was two (though she had sign language). Her preschool director thought she was coming along and to give her more time so she hasn't been to speech therapy but I'd been doing research and found my way to this dvd series & their book.

This dvd concentrates on the sounds p b and m, and if you sound those out you'll notice it's the same mouth motion for each one with the difference being in vibrating your vocal cords or keeping your mouth shut (they explain that in a separate parent tutorial). This allows them to change the content and vocab words but the child is still practicing the same mouth motion and developing the muscle memory. I watch with my kids usually and when there is silence we'll chime in a description of what's on the screen (""A ball! It's spinning! Round and round"" etc)making this an interactive experience between us.

While I was concentrating getting my first born to speak, my second born was watching and learning every bit and has ended up being a very accomplished early talker. While she was born with that inclination, I have no doubt that my new found ability to provide clean information made learning easier and less frustrating. For my speech delayed child, she locked on to this as useful information and immediately had improvement in pronunciation. So I recommend this video for any baby/toddler -- speech delay or not, and I certainly recommend this before some of the time-waster entertainment-only DVDs.

I realize we live in an age of state of the art digitized technology with all manner of gizmos and noise to fascinate and distract children -- but I think it lends a certain amount of cacophony that doesn't help the learning child.  The simple ""low budget"" presentation of this DVD is a teaching foundation that I've taken and applied to other situations. I've become more conscious about describing what I'm doing in a simple repetitive manner in my daily interactions (I'm not a chatterbox, so it wasn't a natural inclination). I'm a much better teacher for my kids from these videos. It goes into the parenting 101 category for me and I've been sure to recommend it to other parents.",1359072000,,2204,4.7020725388601035

3011443,4,B000Y1NNH2,"I've never been inclined to write a review, but I felt this product deserves a few moments of my time because it's a great tool for helping children communicate. I bought this in may 2012 for my baby who was around 7/8 months. I can't begin to describe how INTERESTED she was in the videos. My husband and I used to joke that she was zoned out on baby babble. She would watch it so intensely, we actually worried about her! But I've seen results, so I guess she was just absorbing everything they were saying and now she waits eagerly when she sees us pick up the remote and pop in the dvd :-))  At 12 months I noticed her trying to communicate with me through the signing she saw on the dvd. She would sign things like 'more please' when she was eating something she liked as well as 'what', 'where', 'milk', 'please', 'nap' and a few others. Now at 14 months, she ""speaks"" the words. The repetition is super helpful for her BUT id like to emphasize that this isn't a video where you can just let your child watch and hope they learn to speak on their own. You need to assist them by repeating what they see on the video. The parent tutorial teaches you how to help your child with speech techniques. All of  this combined together is what helps your child learn to communicate and it's super fun for me to watch her grow and evolve and absorb what she sees and hears around her. Overall, I think its a great tool for helping early communication between parent and child.

on a side note, I bought all three videos, but the 1st one wouldn't work on our dvd player for some reasoon and only on the computer. I used to pop it in but after awhile I got tired so we really didn't use the first one, but the second one 'pbm' & 'tdn' she watches religiously!",1356825600,,1753,4.24251497005988

He learned top press the commands and go through interactive parts.  His excitement as various pictures and activites were coming up showed us that he was learning the pattern of the video.  There is part where they open a mailbox and say no mail.  Whenever that was the next thing coming up he would shake his head no to indicate that was coming.  We also followed the suggested activities and learned thewhy and how of teaching him to move his mouth and develop muscles.  A few months later when he did have a speech therapist work with him, we learned that we had developed his vocabulary substantially and the therapist got him to blurt it all out rather quickly......",1356566400,,976,4.359116022099448

They seem VERY VERY simple and downright bad (my older boys in their teens were making fun of it.  BUT, with my 27 month old son only speaking a few words, and my pediatrician saying that if at 30 months, he's not progressing we need to have him evaluated for delayed speech, of course I was looking for something with good reviews to try.  THESE DVD's HAVE GREAT REVIEWS (WITH A FEW NOT SO GREAT IN BETWEEN), BUT THE GOOD ONES ARE SPOT ON!!

 My son's vocab exploded within 2 weeks of receiving these. He was grunting the syllables for words he KNEW but wouldn't say and he could follow complex instructions, and he could figure out puzzles and locks after a minute or two, so we knew he was pretty smart. Imagine how cool it is to finally be called ""mama""!  I don't know how else to describe how effective these are, but to say that he went from having 10-15 words to an uncountable list (including stringing two-three together!)!  AND he asks for these DVD's to be played on his own.... not something he does with any of the others. I truly feel like his confidence went up when he found he could mimic the two speech pathologists in the DVD.  THANK YOU CORY AND AMY!!!!!!",1356566400,3,1280,4.326359832635983

He repeaed almost all the words in the DVD and applied them to his real life like saying up up up when climbing stairs. I highly recommend this DVD if you want your child to learn to start speaking.

He suffers from low tone as well as expressive speech and language delays and everything about these videos, from the oral/facial exercises to the simple, repetitive use of toys has helped him make great leaps in his expressive/language skills.  If you have a speech-delayed child, these videos mirror the excersies my son does with his speech-therapist and are helping fill-in those days when he is not in therapy.  This is a very basic video for speech delay/enhancement and seems to be lambasted by many for doing exactly the sort of therapy that many of our kids need.  Is this video for everyone, clearly no.  If you have a child who does not have issues with speech/ expressive language you can probably find more entertainment with the Baby Einstein videos.

I would have been ok with this, but they also did not have any close-ups of humans saying the words, and no children were in the video at all. I was expecting something a little better--my son enjoys watching toddlers/preschoolers talk and needs to see the mouths move to figure out how to make the sounds. In this DVD a woman is shown speaking somewhat clearly 3 or 4 times. The rest is a hand pushing a toy across the screen while the word is being spoken. ""Train"" while a train is pushed across the screen with no human faces in the picture. No signing is included until the last 30 minutes, and it is just a tutorial for the parents, it does not help the kids at all. I was disappointed to say the least. My son watched less than 10 minutes. I highly recommend the Baby Einstein videos, he will sit and watch the whole 30 minutes 2 or 3 times in a row and repeat the words, and he learned 3 or 4 of the words within 2 days AND will sign them.

3011454,5,B000Y1NNH2,"I ordered all three baby babbles for my son who is 18 months old and not saying many words yet. I have heard a few words once but never repeated again. He doesn't say mama or papa ( unless crying then it sounds like maaamaaa!)  My doctor is not concerned since he babbles none stop all day but since I am a full time working mom I want to do everything I can in the few hours I have with him each day. He spends 8 plus hour at daycare everyday.  I have received baby babble 1 & 2 and 3 will be shipped as soon as its available. He loves to watch them and is already trying to say things from the video after just a week of having both of them. He now says ut oh just from the videos! He runs and grabs the toys that we have that are in the video and tries to make the same sounds. What I love best is how it helps me to understand how to help teach him to talk through playing. Since the video I have purchased a whistle and we are blowing more bubbles while practicing our baa and paa sounds. I have been working on him blowing his finger off his lips and now he is grabbing me and kissing me on the lips! We have a speech therapist coming next week for an evaluation to see if he needs early intervention for speech and even if he does I still plan on using these DVDs. Reading what others have written it seems like these videos and very similar to what a speech therapist will provide to your child at your home which is great in case your child doesn't have the 25% delay they look for to qualify for early intervention services. This seems like having speech therapy everyday for your little one. I love the sign language part as well!  I am very happy with these dvds and the knowledge these speech therapist are sharing with parents. I hope to show it to his daycare teacher so she can learn some tips to help all the kids in his room!

I can see why some would say its similar to baby Einstein b/c they show toys, etc..  but i think these are better b/c they focus on sounds and your child actually sees a mouth move with the words and sounds. my little boy likes these better! I  just wish I would have had these from the beginning b/c he watched the preschool prep series a lot - I will say he does know his colors though!

After talking to his doctor, I started the process of early intervention.  Living in NYC he only receives 30 minutes a week.  I knew that wasn't enough but I also couldn't afford anything private. I started to do some research and found Baby Babble.  I read all the reviews and was eager to try it.
The video is nothing fancy, no special effects, but it captures my son's attention! He watches it daily on his request no less! He repeats the sounds and the gestures that is shown.  I love watching him get excited when he does the sounds and he loves to hear the claps we give him when we see him do it.

Well weeks before I started to research educational dvds that could possibly help him communicate and perhaps start talking. I came across Baby Babble 1 which he didn't want to watch at first (because he was use to shows he liked) but let me tell you, if you don't put on the shows they are use to and you stick with putting the Baby Babble dvd in even if they don't want to sit and watch it they will eventually be drawn to it. So that's what I did ..... Within days he was imitating what he saw and trying to move his mouth to form the sounds he heard and even making sounds. There is one part in Baby Babble 1 where they pretend to talk on the phone and my son ran to his playroom and grabbed his play phone and did the same. He had never done this before and so after I felt he had watched the first Baby Babble enough I ordered Baby Babble 2 and let me tell you, getting him to watch this was a breeze...

At that time, my husband had just been deployed and I needed something to entertain my daughter in her bouncer so that I could take a shower and get ready for work.  Baby Babble worked wonderfully.  She was hooked from day one!  Now, she is 13 months old and I have purchased Baby Babble 2.  She is signing once in a while and really loves the toys and music on the DVD.  When she wants to watch Baby Babble she points to the TV and says something that sounds a lot like the word 'Babble'.  These DVD's are awesome.  My daughter seems to enjoy them more than the Brainy Baby DVD.  She tends to wander off while watching Brainy Baby, but not with Baby Babble.

I think this is completely personal to my child, your child may like it just as much as number 1. I cant pinpoint why she would be scared of the things on the DVD that she is, but we've tried watching it a few times with the same result - a look of terror and fear.",1297728000,,516,3.8317757009345796

We weren't into the idea of our child sitting in front of the T.V. at all, but wanted to have some educational videos for the 18 hour car ride we had to do shortly after Christmas.  We figure if he has to watch something, it might as well teach him a thing or two.  This Baby Babble is extremely catchy for my little guy - he was shouting and repeating everything he could!  He's doing the signs also!  We don't have a problem popping this DVD in for him when he asks because it is teaching him how to speak and name objects/actions.  I was shocked the DVD worked out so well with as simple and to the point as it seems.  There aren't a lot of crazy songs or glorified objects to distract from the educational aspect of the video.  This beats any Baby Einstein, and any other ""educational"" video, hands down with my little guy!!",1295568000,,929,4.232954545454546

He would barely say any sounds or words.  His hearing had been tested, and he had a first appointment with a pediatric speech therapist.  I knew that I would have the opportunity to work with him for five days while our kids went out of state house-hunting due to a job promotion.  A friend had recommended looking into getting Baby Einstein videos so I looked them up online but my searching led me to the Baby Babble DVD's produced by two pediatric speech pathologists.  I am SO GLAD that I ordered them and began working with our grandson following the suggestions on the DVD's.  He LOVES Baby Babble and in that short amount of time learned at least 25 words.  It was just the jumpstart he needed and our kids continue to use it daily.  Our grandson makes all of the sounds indicated age appropriate on the Talking Child website's language chart and learns and says new words daily.  In fact, he says words beginning in some of the blends indicated for three-year olds.  He's definitely ""speech delayed"" no more!!  Thank you Baby Babble!",1294963200,,1242,4.784037558685446

As a result our son was speech delayed.  I'm convinced he made up his own language.  When I got the baby babble movies I wasn't expecting a miracle, just something to help my son learn to talk.  We were able to pull some sign language from the movies that helped us communicate.  Primarily we used the words ""eat"" ""more"" ""potty"" ""please"" and ""help."" to get us by until he started to use real words.  Yes, speech therapists should encourage talking to your child, however these videos are able to model activities to do with your child to encourage their speech development.  I always watched it with him and repeated what they said, and he imitated them too. He still wasn't able to talk until his tongue was clipped, however these movies helped him focus on speaking - one word at a time.

3011492,5,B000Y1NNH2,"This video is the perfect sequel to ""Baby Babble"" and it can also be watched without the first video. Both programs have the same style that is great for keeping your child's attention. There are short video clips of toys and everyday objects, combined with simple sound effects. The images last only a few seconds and simple words are spoken to describe several of the images. Other clips just have sound effects. There are two ladies featured in the video who created ""Baby Babble 2"" and ""Baby Babble."" They are speech and language pathologists and their methods are wonderful. After the main segment ends, the ladies (Cory and Amy) give lots of advice for encouraging speech in young children. They show some sign language and even an overview of the toys from the video, with manufacturer names. The entire DVD lasts almost one hour.

My son is almost two and a half years old and he LOVES both of these videos! He has been delayed with his speech since he was less than one year old. I was searching Amazon.com for videos to help him and I was very pleased with ""Baby Babble"" and ""Baby Babble 2."" I would honestly say that these programs have helped him more than anything else. He watches them often and never gets tired of them. They keep his attention and he has changed dramatically in the past several months. He started out quietly watching, then he began to repeat what the ladies said. Sometimes he would laugh out loud to a clip if it seemed funny. He now repeats almost every word in the video and uses the words and phrases in everyday life. He applies what he learnes with real objects and situations. Sometimes he says something at random from the video if it just comes to mind. But I know he is remembering a certain part (he surely has most parts memorized). He also asks to watch it by saying, ""Baby Babble?"" and/or handing me the DVD case. The program also seems to help my 14 month-old daughter. She only says three words now, but we hope she won't be delayed with her speech. I strongly recommend both DVDs to parents who want to enhance their child's learning and development in a fun way!",1288396800,,2115,4.536649214659686

3011495,1,B000Y1NNH2,"I am baffled that an educated speech therapist would encourage speech development through DVD's/TV.  Effective speech development happens when a child mimics a live person and watches the production of their face, expression, and body language as the child attempts to produce the same sound.  The child is motivated largely by person-to-person responses and reactions to the child's attempts.  This cannot happen with a DVD.  And, studies show that TV stunts the growth of speech development in children.

Children's Books is the best way to help your child's speech.  Don't hinder your child's growth by having them watch a DVD no matter what it is.

Signed, someone who's been involved with speech development for years...",1282176000,3,725,5.252173913043478
3011506,5,B000Y1NNH2,"My little boy is turning 3, and around the time he was 2 years and 2 months old, his doctor was saying that he wasn't talking enough and should be checked out by a speech therapist. I was angry, because you don't want the medical community telling you there is something wrong with your child when there is nothing there, and because I didn't know what to do. I hate these ""how to"" parent books, but wanted some techniques that might help him want to talk. I saw Baby Babble 1 and 2 reviews here on Amazon and ordered both. My son really got into them immediately and started asking for ba-ey ba-el. He would make all the noises along with the therapist when he watched and dance around and smile during the program. He just really loved it! His speech since then has come along way. We have employed the use of flash cards with phonics and I work on getting him to make the faces I make to help him pronounce things. Most 3 year olds talk more than he does, but don't exhibit some of the other qualities he does in terms of writing, how quickly he picks up things, patience and other skills that are advanced. Baby Babble 1 and 2 were great first steps in helping him to talk and I am greatful for them.

Note:
We originally purchased Your Baby Can Read before Baby Babble and he didn't get into it at all, so we sent it back. But now, he has seen the Your Baby Can Read commercial on a tv program we recorded for him and always points to and now gives the impression that he wants to watch it. I would recommend for parents who are experiencing a speech delay to start with Baby Babble 1 and 2, Brainy Baby English and then after 8 months of those DVD's and other techniques (reading daily, flash cards, singing the alphabet and songs- all things I did with my child to help him along), when your child hits that mimicking phase and you are seeing a steady growth, consider the Your Baby Can Read set.

The youngest one laughs and giggles while watching, and attempts to make the sounds as they are prompted on the program.  The nearly 3 year old is speech-delayed, and these DVDs have been an absolute blessing in terms of how he is learning from watching them.  He has never been very intersted in watching DVDs or television for any length of time, but since purchasing these two DVDs he sits and watches the entire program, attempting to say the words and sounds as they are prompted.  In fact, the day they arrived in the mail, they were both at our house, and when I put the first DVD in, he sat down to watch and was excited and participated throughout the entire program.  He then asked to watch it 4 more times that day before his daddy picked them up after work.  Because of their enthusiasm I purchased another set for them to take home and watch with their parents.  They want to watch them every day, here or at home.  It has helped the oldest grandson so much in his speech, and I just can't say enough about these products.

I have searched a lot and finally I decided to give baby babble a try. We purchased both dvds and I have to say that after having watched them a couple of time, my son started to be much more confident with sounds. Here are my pros and cons:
Pros
- both dvd are fun and toddler will enjoy watching them; I have read that some kids were scared by one of the speech pathologyst face against the black: honestly I found it unpleasent but my son finds it funny;
- there is a good mix of playing and teaching
- the parts in which the mouth, lip and tongue movements are shown is very effective; my son tryied to repeat all the movements and sounds since the very first time;
- the parent tutorial is really great and helped me a lot in working with my child.
Cons
- I did not like the part showing the brand of the toys that are shown in the dvd; I think that the very professional job of the two therapists is a little bit damaged by this part;

3011544,5,B000Y1NNH2,I purchased both Baby Babble I & II about 6 months ago for my daughter with verbal speech apraxia.  This DVD has been a life saver.  Both Baby Babble DVD's made it fun for my daughter to want to learn more signs and perform mouth exercises.  I highly recommend this DVD to any parent with a child who is having a speech delay or has been diagnosed with verbal apraxia.  I recommended this DVD to her Speech Therapist and she too has gotten positive reviews from her other clients as well.,1221436800,,488,4.329670329670329
3011545,5,B000Y1NNH2,"As both the mom of an autistic child and an ABA therapist, I can heartily endorse both Baby Babble I and Baby Babble II.  They're wonderful for helping young children on the spectrum, as well as any child who's having difficulty with speech, learn new vocabulary and mouth & tongue movements. I recommend both videos in this series to my autistic clients, as well as to the parents of other kiddos with speech delays or apraxia.
The videos do seem a bit 'babyish', but trust me, they'll keep the attention of a typically-developing child up to age 4 or so...autistic kiddos even longer.  From one autie-mommy to another - please consider getting both!  My own son gained at least 12-20 new words from each viseo, just in a matter of a week or two...far faster than his speech-therapy sessions can produce new vocab.  Well worth the price!",1221177600,5,838,4.680272108843537

I think the techniques they use are good, and they seem to be knowlegable in speech pathology - however... it couldn't really keep my son's interest and it was also very short.

He is learning the signs and how to make the sounds to make words. It has also helped my and my husband work with him when he has trouble pronouncing a word. I cannot recommend these videos enough!

3011552,5,B000Y1NNH2,"I just have to say that both of these videos are a hit with my boys. I have a nearly 5 year old son that has Autism and Apraxia. I got the first video when he was less than a year old. It used to be the only thing that calmed him down when he started to tantrum or melt down. I used to be amazed by the calming affect it had on him. Besides the fact that these videos are very addicting to young children, they are also great for helping with speech. My son is articulating his P, B, M words so much better now that he's been watching the 2nd video...they really do learn from these. Not to mention, my nearly 3 year old neurotypical son is just as addicted as his older brother. I love watching the two of them interact with each other as they are watching these videos. I especially love that there are a couple of popular characters in the 2nd video...particularly Thomas and Elmo. My boys get soooo excited when they see the Thomas toy as they are both addicted to Thomas. I like the sign language portion of the videos too and both boys enjoy it.  My autistic son even likes to watch the parent tutorials. I think he is just soothed by the music and Amy and Corey's voices. Anyway, if you are considering this...just go ahead and buy it. You won't be sorry you did.",1213920000,35,1270,4.162601626016261

3245780,5,B000Y1NNH2,"Like other reviewers have said, both 1 & 2 are addictive.  Baby Babbles and Elmo aside, my daughter has no interest in television.  These two videos practically put her in a trance!  Since she was 6 months old, she's been giving her undivided attention to these shows and since about 9 months babbles along with the people in the video.

She's a year now and still isn't really picking up words yet-just the sounds.  However, we do communicate slightly through the basic sign language, which decreases her/our daily frustrations and sets her up for success when attempting to communicate her wants and needs.

These videos are worth the price for the hours I've gained during the past 6 months to get some work and chores done for myself while she is having fun learning.

Be advised though, this is a video which really only works if you reinforce the exercises often and integrate them into your daily communication with your child.  Babies may be entertained by the show but the learning begins with your interactions.

This is a great present for new parents!",1206057600,,1063,4.7650273224043715

3245785,5,B000Y1NNH2,"This is a very good follow up to the original Baby Babble.  The first one was very helpful for our speech-delayed two year old.  We like it so much that we pre-ordered this one from Amazon when it first came out.

The DVD has 4 sections.
1. The main video which focus on objects/words with P, B, M sounds. All of which are introduced and sounded out through pretend play, toys in action, etc.  It makes the DVD more ""interactive"" than just watching flashcard style presentation. After several viewing, our son started to repeat the words and also do pretend play with his toys.

Also, interjected between the video clips of toys and pretend play are the two speech pathologists showing how to make ""P"", ""B"" and ""M"" sounds with their mouth.  These two ladies have gotten an updated hairstyle and a lot less ""stiff""/serious than the original video.  This is a great improvement second times around.

It also introduce some basic concepts like colors (Purple, Blue, etc.) and counting (1, 2, 3).

Overall, the video is about 30 minutes.

2. The main video is follow by a parents guidance section which the two speech pathologist describe methods that parents can use at home to encourage their child to practice P, B, M sounds at home like blowing bubbles or on the cotton ball.  There are some excellent advice here.

3. The third section shows the two speech pathologist using sign language and sound out some main objects/concepts (Thank you, please, more, music, etc.) show in the video.  This is a good section reinforce the main video.  The sign language section might be more helpful for younger toddlers/babies who may not be able to sound out the words.

4. Finally, it shows all the toys and their manufacturer featured in the main video.  We have found a few toys we like from this video and have subsequently purchased it for our son.

Overall, I highly recommend both Baby Babble 1 and 2 to parents who wants to share more educational videos with their kids during TV time. This is especially helpful for parents with children who may be speech-delayed.",1200614400,94,2063,4.701949860724234

We started speech therapy and got all three of these dvd's and boy did they help. It got to the point where he came home from daycare everyday and asked to watch these videos. He imitated what he could and started saying more words and sounds. The format just captures their attention so easily and holds it for the entire video.  He's almost three and still asks to watch them once in awhile and we have almost conquered his speech delay.

Simple, yet entertaining, and helpful with his speech and language growth. It teaches sign language as well as word formation and sounds. A parent tutorial helps explain how u can expound on your child's language development at home also. I think these ladies have done a fine job- just wish they were a bit longer in length- only because he gets so much out of them! Well done :)",1425254400,,846,4.572368421052632

He is absolutely GLUED to the TV every time we put it on (and he brings us the remote and points to the TV because he wants to watch it all day!) My son is non-verbal, but in just a matter of weeks, has picked up several of the signs taught in the DVD and also picked up several new sounds.  This DVD has been an amazing help to our son's communication and understanding!  My husband and I find the video to be bit wierd, low budget, old fashioned, etc, but who cares what we think--our son LOVES it.  The video has accomplished more in a week than our speech therapist accomplished in a year.  For those with kids who are autistic, developmentally delayed, speech delayed, you should definitely buy the set.  The video captures the attention of even those with limited attention spans by using spinning and light-up toys.  The video is also set to music.  My son barely watched TV before, but like I said, is glued to the Baby Babble DVDs.",1419811200,,986,4.3497267759562845

I began to worry around 18 months when he only knew a few words (maybe 5ish) which had been the same ones he'd had since around 14-15 months and I didn't see much increase or any attempt to try to mock or repeate after me ever. The few words he had he just said on and off but when I ever said words he acted uninterested in learning them or trying to say them. So I started him watching these videos which I had previously bought & around 22ish months he began trying to say almost everything he saw the sounds, signs and noises although not always right he was super interested and finally trying and with repeated exposure I'm sure will become more clear. I have tried other learning DVDs and he may watch a while but never has he tried to speak after them as he does the baby babble DVDs so I believe these DVDs are awesome and even if ur child doesn't start trying right away after a couple months later I tried again and he picked right up trying!

I notice a huge change in him within a couple of weeks.  He is now 28 months old and saying over 100 words and is talking all day long.  These video's made such a difference.  I wish I would have got them when he was born.  They teach you how to help your child speak.  My son has went to speech therapy and the video's do the same thing but better.

He began with Baby Babble 1 at 3 months, Baby Babble 2 at 6 months, and he is now 10 months and will be starting 3 when it arrives. The thing is, he still loves the others. He smiles when Amy and Cory come on the screen. They are very educational for baby and parent. I feel it taught me things I can be doing to help speech development and gives ideas for the future if any speech issues arrive. My son recognizes the 'milk' sign, and we are working on the others. After watching these movies I noticed my son trying to imitate sounds he heard probably around 4-5 months of age. He says mama (by 8 months), and by 9 months when shown as ball will say baaal, not quite working the 'l' out yet but he is on the right track thanks to these videos teaching him and me. I would highly suggest these videos, and will be buying them for friends as they have babies. I foresee my son watching these for a long time, they are by far his favorite!

3245873,5,B000Y1NNH2,Although these look to be filmed in someone's spare room it doesn't matter - the content is awesome.  I started watching these with her during the afternoons when I get home from work.  One night she was having trouble getting to sleep and I was at a loss so I started one of the Babble videos and she settled right down into my rocker with me.  I've now incorporated these videos into my child's bedtime routine.  I thought of it more as something to help her off to sleep.  Boy was I wrong.  My now 18 month old has been watching these since she was 12 months.  She watches a video a night and stays up for the entire thing.  She picks up the signs and sounds quickly and will do them with the video and sometimes before they can even sign or say it.  At the end of the video she turns to me and says night night and closes her eyes.  This is an awesome feat for a little girl who has major sleep issues.  I believe in these videos wholeheartedly and am ready to purchase more anytime they come out.  Thanks!,1401148800,,1010,4.149484536082475

I love how it reinforces what we learn from therapy, many of the parent tips are exactly what we were told in our therapy session.  The sign language is an added bonus.  My daughter loves them, is entertained by them when she learns, but also likes to show off when she knows something they show on the video too.

however my one piece of advice to anyone concerned about speech is please do not get all stirred up if ur child is not talking at 2...thats just the way some kids are...my second child started talking at 2.5 and i was absolutely okay with that because i had seen how his brother talked after 2.

One of my sons is a super talker, but his twin brother is a LATE talker. ( They are 35 months old)
All late talker's parents want to know...""did this get your child to talk?"" We have had this for a week & have watched it every day & my late talker feels very comfortable trying to imitate these ladies, he is much more comfortable imitating them then anyone else on TV or in our house!!! Including Dora, Barney...Mommy (me), Daddy or brother.
This video is helping the late talker soooo much while keeping the Super talker totally engaged & entertained!
The two Speech developement experts in this video are just that... EXPERTS!!!

Baby Babble is the real deal, my son repeats after the words and sounds and has started talking more after watching.  I read to him every day, but I am starting to suspect he is a visual learner since he does very well with matching games and picking things out on flashcards or in books.

3245907,5,B000Y1NNH2,"My child has been watching the entire Baby Babble series since he was about a year old. He is 17 months old now and many of his first words (SPEAKING words, not just sign language) have come from watching these videos. Words like baby, daddy, mommy, up, down, out, more, truck, please, thank you, all done, eat, and countless others. The videos are designed to hold the short attention span of young children, and they definitely do. The intervals of music, incorporation of sounds, talking, simple objects, etc. ---all of those are specifically directed toward babies and toddlers. In my opinion, this series is better than Baby Einstein, Brainy Baby, etc. for the older baby/young toddler. It might be ""too educational"" for the really young baby. But, from 9 months to age 2 1/2 or maybe even older, I would say this series is THE BEST out there for speech, learning, and ""quiet time."". The series even focuses on certain letters like p,b, and m or t, d, n which directly coincides with the appropriate level of speech that a child is capable of learning as he/she grows. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ENTIRE BABY BABLE SERIES (There are 3 in the series.) Oh and as an added benefit, the videos are quite calming for the parents and the creators' approach toward teaching the concepts is actually quite fascinating.  A nice break from some of the ""annoying"" shows and DVDs that are out there for kids. And an overall great way to expose your child to language/learning.

My son was recently diagnosed with having Autism and a severe speech delay. I can't begin to express how sad I felt when I found this out, so I immediately started searching for anything I could do to help him at home. When I came across the first Baby Babble I bought it and with amazement I watched my son start to talk, it was the only thing I would let him watch on TV for a week straight for a 30 mins or so, but that's all it really took. My son went from barely saying dada to UH OH! blowing air from his mouth in a funny way, something they teach the kids on the DVD, and so much more. I was so excited that the next month I purchased this DVD and now he says up, down and he has learned most of the sign language from both DVD's , he says yes and bye bye now. All I can say is if you are worried about your child not speaking, please invest in these DVD's and really sit down everyday and work with your child and I promise you in less than 2 months you will see a tremendous change.

3245937,5,B000Y1NNH2,"I have a 3 year old who didn't seem interested in talking until she was two (though she had sign language). Her preschool director thought she was coming along and to give her more time so she hasn't been to speech therapy but I'd been doing research and found my way to this dvd series & their book.

This dvd concentrates on the sounds p b and m, and if you sound those out you'll notice it's the same mouth motion for each one with the difference being in vibrating your vocal cords or keeping your mouth shut (they explain that in a separate parent tutorial). This allows them to change the content and vocab words but the child is still practicing the same mouth motion and developing the muscle memory. I watch with my kids usually and when there is silence we'll chime in a description of what's on the screen (""A ball! It's spinning! Round and round"" etc)making this an interactive experience between us.

While I was concentrating getting my first born to speak, my second born was watching and learning every bit and has ended up being a very accomplished early talker. While she was born with that inclination, I have no doubt that my new found ability to provide clean information made learning easier and less frustrating. For my speech delayed child, she locked on to this as useful information and immediately had improvement in pronunciation. So I recommend this video for any baby/toddler -- speech delay or not, and I certainly recommend this before some of the time-waster entertainment-only DVDs.

I realize we live in an age of state of the art digitized technology with all manner of gizmos and noise to fascinate and distract children -- but I think it lends a certain amount of cacophony that doesn't help the learning child.  The simple ""low budget"" presentation of this DVD is a teaching foundation that I've taken and applied to other situations. I've become more conscious about describing what I'm doing in a simple repetitive manner in my daily interactions (I'm not a chatterbox, so it wasn't a natural inclination). I'm a much better teacher for my kids from these videos. It goes into the parenting 101 category for me and I've been sure to recommend it to other parents.",1359072000,,2204,4.7020725388601035

3245940,4,B000Y1NNH2,"I've never been inclined to write a review, but I felt this product deserves a few moments of my time because it's a great tool for helping children communicate. I bought this in may 2012 for my baby who was around 7/8 months. I can't begin to describe how INTERESTED she was in the videos. My husband and I used to joke that she was zoned out on baby babble. She would watch it so intensely, we actually worried about her! But I've seen results, so I guess she was just absorbing everything they were saying and now she waits eagerly when she sees us pick up the remote and pop in the dvd :-))  At 12 months I noticed her trying to communicate with me through the signing she saw on the dvd. She would sign things like 'more please' when she was eating something she liked as well as 'what', 'where', 'milk', 'please', 'nap' and a few others. Now at 14 months, she ""speaks"" the words. The repetition is super helpful for her BUT id like to emphasize that this isn't a video where you can just let your child watch and hope they learn to speak on their own. You need to assist them by repeating what they see on the video. The parent tutorial teaches you how to help your child with speech techniques. All of  this combined together is what helps your child learn to communicate and it's super fun for me to watch her grow and evolve and absorb what she sees and hears around her. Overall, I think its a great tool for helping early communication between parent and child.

on a side note, I bought all three videos, but the 1st one wouldn't work on our dvd player for some reasoon and only on the computer. I used to pop it in but after awhile I got tired so we really didn't use the first one, but the second one 'pbm' & 'tdn' she watches religiously!",1356825600,,1753,4.24251497005988

He learned top press the commands and go through interactive parts.  His excitement as various pictures and activites were coming up showed us that he was learning the pattern of the video.  There is part where they open a mailbox and say no mail.  Whenever that was the next thing coming up he would shake his head no to indicate that was coming.  We also followed the suggested activities and learned thewhy and how of teaching him to move his mouth and develop muscles.  A few months later when he did have a speech therapist work with him, we learned that we had developed his vocabulary substantially and the therapist got him to blurt it all out rather quickly......",1356566400,,976,4.359116022099448

They seem VERY VERY simple and downright bad (my older boys in their teens were making fun of it.  BUT, with my 27 month old son only speaking a few words, and my pediatrician saying that if at 30 months, he's not progressing we need to have him evaluated for delayed speech, of course I was looking for something with good reviews to try.  THESE DVD's HAVE GREAT REVIEWS (WITH A FEW NOT SO GREAT IN BETWEEN), BUT THE GOOD ONES ARE SPOT ON!!

 My son's vocab exploded within 2 weeks of receiving these. He was grunting the syllables for words he KNEW but wouldn't say and he could follow complex instructions, and he could figure out puzzles and locks after a minute or two, so we knew he was pretty smart. Imagine how cool it is to finally be called ""mama""!  I don't know how else to describe how effective these are, but to say that he went from having 10-15 words to an uncountable list (including stringing two-three together!)!  AND he asks for these DVD's to be played on his own.... not something he does with any of the others.

He repeaed almost all the words in the DVD and applied them to his real life like saying up up up when climbing stairs. I highly recommend this DVD if you want your child to learn to start speaking.

He suffers from low tone as well as expressive speech and language delays and everything about these videos, from the oral/facial exercises to the simple, repetitive use of toys has helped him make great leaps in his expressive/language skills.  If you have a speech-delayed child, these videos mirror the excersies my son does with his speech-therapist and are helping fill-in those days when he is not in therapy.  This is a very basic video for speech delay/enhancement and seems to be lambasted by many for doing exactly the sort of therapy that many of our kids need.  Is this video for everyone, clearly no.

I would have been ok with this, but they also did not have any close-ups of humans saying the words, and no children were in the video at all. I was expecting something a little better--my son enjoys watching toddlers/preschoolers talk and needs to see the mouths move to figure out how to make the sounds. In this DVD a woman is shown speaking somewhat clearly 3 or 4 times. The rest is a hand pushing a toy across the screen while the word is being spoken. ""Train"" while a train is pushed across the screen with no human faces in the picture. No signing is included until the last 30 minutes, and it is just a tutorial for the parents, it does not help the kids at all. I was disappointed to say the least. My son watched less than 10 minutes. I highly recommend the Baby Einstein videos, he will sit and watch the whole 30 minutes 2 or 3 times in a row and repeat the words, and he learned 3 or 4 of the words within 2 days AND will sign them.

He doesn't say mama or papa ( unless crying then it sounds like maaamaaa!)  My doctor is not concerned since he babbles none stop all day but since I am a full time working mom I want to do everything I can in the few hours I have with him each day. He spends 8 plus hour at daycare everyday.  I have received baby babble 1 & 2 and 3 will be shipped as soon as its available. He loves to watch them and is already trying to say things from the video after just a week of having both of them. He now says ut oh just from the videos! He runs and grabs the toys that we have that are in the video and tries to make the same sounds. What I love best is how it helps me to understand how to help teach him to talk through playing. Since the video I have purchased a whistle and we are blowing more bubbles while practicing our baa and paa sounds. I have been working on him blowing his finger off his lips and now he is grabbing me and kissing me on the lips! We have a speech therapist coming next week for an evaluation to see if he needs early intervention for speech and even if he does I still plan on using these DVDs. Reading what others have written it seems like these videos and very similar to what a speech therapist will provide to your child at your home which is great in case your child doesn't have the 25% delay they look for to qualify for early intervention services. This seems like having speech therapy everyday for your little one. I love the sign language part as well!  I am very happy with these dvds and the knowledge these speech therapist are sharing with parents. I hope to show it to his daycare teacher so she can learn some tips to help all the kids in his room!

I can see why some would say its similar to baby Einstein b/c they show toys, etc..  but i think these are better b/c they focus on sounds and your child actually sees a mouth move with the words and sounds. my little boy likes these better! I  just wish I would have had these from the beginning b/c he watched the preschool prep series a lot - I will say he does know his colors though!

3245966,5,B000Y1NNH2,"My son had just two years old and was just saying mama and dada.  He never went through the babble stage and we just assume he was a quiet baby.  He was always very independent and very hands on.  After observing him with kids his own age we knew that it terms of talking he was behind and being a teacher myself, my concerns were rising.
After talking to his doctor, I started the process of early intervention.  Living in NYC he only receives 30 minutes a week.  I knew that wasn't enough but I also couldn't afford anything private. I started to do some research and found Baby Babble.  I read all the reviews and was eager to try it.
The video is nothing fancy, no special effects, but it captures my son's attention! He watches it daily on his request no less! He repeats the sounds and the gestures that is shown.  I love watching him get excited when he does the sounds and he loves to hear the claps we give him when we see him do it.
I can't wait to try Baby Babble 2 in a few months after I see he is ready to move on.  He does have a long road ahead of him but this has been a great start!",1321660800,,1100,4.013761467889908

I rather play this than Sprout. I'm sure it was a combo of things, but I do believe this DVD really helped. He went from about 5 words from the purchase of the first baby babble dvd (24 months old), to 50 words now 4 months later.

My toddler was just diagnosed with Autism a few weeks ago and was non verbal. Well weeks before I started to research educational dvds that could possibly help him communicate and perhaps start talking. I came across Baby Babble 1 which he didn't want to watch at first (because he was use to shows he liked) but let me tell you, if you don't put on the shows they are use to and you stick with putting the Baby Babble dvd in even if they don't want to sit and watch it they will eventually be drawn to it. So that's what I did ..... Within days he was imitating what he saw and trying to move his mouth to form the sounds he heard and even making sounds. There is one part in Baby Babble 1 where they pretend to talk on the phone and my son ran to his playroom and grabbed his play phone and did the same. He had never done this before and so after I felt he had watched the first Baby Babble enough I ordered Baby Babble 2 and let me tell you, getting him to watch this was a breeze... He recognized the ladies from the 1st dvd and was again doing sign language, moving his mouth and making sounds etc and now he has starting to say words. I also have been working with him. I can't say enough about the Baby Babble series 1 & 2. I highly recommend it! Not all kids are the same I know but give it a try you have nothing to lose.",1303776000,2,1471,3.9395973154362416

She was hooked from day one!  Now, she is 13 months old and I have purchased Baby Babble 2.  She is signing once in a while and really loves the toys and music on the DVD.  When she wants to watch Baby Babble she points to the TV and says something that sounds a lot like the word 'Babble'.  These DVD's are awesome.

We figure if he has to watch something, it might as well teach him a thing or two.  This Baby Babble is extremely catchy for my little guy - he was shouting and repeating everything he could!  He's doing the signs also!  We don't have a problem popping this DVD in for him when he asks because it is teaching him how to speak and name objects/actions.  I was shocked the DVD worked out so well with as simple and to the point as it seems.  There aren't a lot of crazy songs or glorified objects to distract from the educational aspect of the video.

He would barely say any sounds or words.  His hearing had been tested, and he had a first appointment with a pediatric speech therapist.  I knew that I would have the opportunity to work with him for five days while our kids went out of state house-hunting due to a job promotion.  A friend had recommended looking into getting Baby Einstein videos so I looked them up online but my searching led me to the Baby Babble DVD's produced by two pediatric speech pathologists.  I am SO GLAD that I ordered them and began working with our grandson following the suggestions on the DVD's.  He LOVES Baby Babble and in that short amount of time learned at least 25 words.  It was just the jumpstart he needed and our kids continue to use it daily.  Our grandson makes all of the sounds indicated age appropriate on the Talking Child website's language chart and learns and says new words daily.  In fact, he says words beginning in some of the blends indicated for three-year olds.  He's definitely ""speech delayed"" no more!!  Thank you Baby Babble!",1294963200,,1242,4.784037558685446

As a result our son was speech delayed.  I'm convinced he made up his own language.  When I got the baby babble movies I wasn't expecting a miracle, just something to help my son learn to talk.  We were able to pull some sign language from the movies that helped us communicate.  Primarily we used the words ""eat"" ""more"" ""potty"" ""please"" and ""help."" to get us by until he started to use real words.  Yes, speech therapists should encourage talking to your child, however these videos are able to model activities to do with your child to encourage their speech development.  I always watched it with him and repeated what they said, and he imitated them too. He still wasn't able to talk until his tongue was clipped, however these movies helped him focus on speaking - one word at a time.

3245989,5,B000Y1NNH2,"This video is the perfect sequel to ""Baby Babble"" and it can also be watched without the first video. Both programs have the same style that is great for keeping your child's attention. There are short video clips of toys and everyday objects, combined with simple sound effects. The images last only a few seconds and simple words are spoken to describe several of the images. Other clips just have sound effects. There are two ladies featured in the video who created ""Baby Babble 2"" and ""Baby Babble."" They are speech and language pathologists and their methods are wonderful. After the main segment ends, the ladies (Cory and Amy) give lots of advice for encouraging speech in young children. They show some sign language and even an overview of the toys from the video, with manufacturer names. The entire DVD lasts almost one hour.

My son is almost two and a half years old and he LOVES both of these videos! He has been delayed with his speech since he was less than one year old. I was searching Amazon.com for videos to help him and I was very pleased with ""Baby Babble"" and ""Baby Babble 2."" I would honestly say that these programs have helped him more than anything else. He watches them often and never gets tired of them. They keep his attention and he has changed dramatically in the past several months. He started out quietly watching, then he began to repeat what the ladies said. Sometimes he would laugh out loud to a clip if it seemed funny. He now repeats almost every word in the video and uses the words and phrases in everyday life. He applies what he learnes with real objects and situations. Sometimes he says something at random from the video if it just comes to mind. But I know he is remembering a certain part (he surely has most parts memorized). He also asks to watch it by saying, ""Baby Babble?"" and/or handing me the DVD case. The program also seems to help my 14 month-old daughter. She only says three words now, but we hope she won't be delayed with her speech.

3245992,1,B000Y1NNH2,"I am baffled that an educated speech therapist would encourage speech development through DVD's/TV.  Effective speech development happens when a child mimics a live person and watches the production of their face, expression, and body language as the child attempts to produce the same sound.  The child is motivated largely by person-to-person responses and reactions to the child's attempts.  This cannot happen with a DVD.  And, studies show that TV stunts the growth of speech development in children.

Children's Books is the best way to help your child's speech.  Don't hinder your child's growth by having them watch a DVD no matter what it is.

3246003,5,B000Y1NNH2,"My little boy is turning 3, and around the time he was 2 years and 2 months old, his doctor was saying that he wasn't talking enough and should be checked out by a speech therapist. I was angry, because you don't want the medical community telling you there is something wrong with your child when there is nothing there, and because I didn't know what to do. I hate these ""how to"" parent books, but wanted some techniques that might help him want to talk. I saw Baby Babble 1 and 2 reviews here on Amazon and ordered both. My son really got into them immediately and started asking for ba-ey ba-el. He would make all the noises along with the therapist when he watched and dance around and smile during the program. He just really loved it! His speech since then has come along way. We have employed the use of flash cards with phonics and I work on getting him to make the faces I make to help him pronounce things. Most 3 year olds talk more than he does, but don't exhibit some of the other qualities he does in terms of writing, how quickly he picks up things, patience and other skills that are advanced. Baby Babble 1 and 2 were great first steps in helping him to talk and I am greatful for them.

Note:
We originally purchased Your Baby Can Read before Baby Babble and he didn't get into it at all, so we sent it back. But now, he has seen the Your Baby Can Read commercial on a tv program we recorded for him and always points to and now gives the impression that he wants to watch it. I would recommend for parents who are experiencing a speech delay to start with Baby Babble 1 and 2, Brainy Baby English and then after 8 months of those DVD's and other techniques (reading daily, flash cards, singing the alphabet and songs- all things I did with my child to help him along), when your child hits that mimicking phase and you are seeing a steady growth, consider the Your Baby Can Read set.

In fact, the day they arrived in the mail, they were both at our house, and when I put the first DVD in, he sat down to watch and was excited and participated throughout the entire program.  He then asked to watch it 4 more times that day before his daddy picked them up after work.  Because of their enthusiasm I purchased another set for them to take home and watch with their parents.

I have searched a lot and finally I decided to give baby babble a try. We purchased both dvds and I have to say that after having watched them a couple of time, my son started to be much more confident with sounds. Here are my pros and cons:
Pros
- both dvd are fun and toddler will enjoy watching them; I have read that some kids were scared by one of the speech pathologyst face against the black: honestly I found it unpleasent but my son finds it funny;
- there is a good mix of playing and teaching
- the parts in which the mouth, lip and tongue movements are shown is very effective; my son tryied to repeat all the movements and sounds since the very first time;
- the parent tutorial is really great and helped me a lot in working with my child.
Cons
- I did not like the part showing the brand of the toys that are shown in the dvd; I think that the very professional job of the two therapists is a little bit damaged by this part;

I purchased both Baby Babble 1 and 2 in the hopes of stimulating her but did not hold out much hope because she really does not pay attention to the TV much. Well I can say that from the first moment I put this DVD in the player she is completely captivated. I have never seen her so attentive and spell bound.  She appears to like BB#2 a little more so I play that one more often.  All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase.",1241481600,,574,4.116071428571429
3246019,5,B000Y1NNH2,"My 15 month old has greatly improved her vocabulary since getting both these dvds. Sometimes she would say words or two word phrases and my husband and I couldn't figure out where she got them, until I heard them in the video. The dvd also teaches signing and gives some helpful tips on how to get your child saying P, B, and M sounds. My daughter actually laughs out loud at the dancing bear in baby babble 1 and the funny faces the presenters make. It is a really engaging video and so much better than those baby Einstein videos. Even if your child doesn't improve their vocab they will definitely be entertained.

My only complaint is that I have been waiting for baby babble 3 forever!",1238198400,,690,4.433070866141732

3246022,5,B000Y1NNH2,"I found this online on a speech therapy website and ordered the DVD, a few whistles, and a pinwheel to encourage my 2 y/o old son who was born with a cleft lip and palate. Although he began speech therapy very early at 18 months he was saying less than 10 intelligible words at 2 years. I felt like the therapist only sat and played with him, repeating things he said. My son was enthralled with this video from the first viewing and brought it to me to watch often. My son who would shy away when we tried to get him to talk started sitting on the couch repeating the words on the video. When I first heard this from the other room, I thought I was hearing things. His vocabulary exploded with months of watching this for the first time. I was so excited that I encouraged my son's speech therapist to recommend it to others but she only said ""you have to be careful, some things are only out there to make money"". We now have another speech therapist. I would have bought a hundred more of this DVD to achieve what my son did in the few short months after getting this video.",1236297600,,1077,4.207729468599034

Even the 3 year old will sit through it. This DVD just doesnt hold their attention as much. The one year old wanders away, the 3 year old actively dislikes it. The charm of the first one was its simplicity (ball in, push, down, all done). This one seems more repetitive, more annoying and less charming.

I watched them only once and since I can't return them now that they're open, I'll donate them to my local library. For me, there were no significant helpful speech tips; and for my son, the video was dull. But if you like Baby Einstein videos showing a baby toy or swirling colors, you might like these videos.

3246041,5,B000Y1NNH2,I purchased both Baby Babble I & II about 6 months ago for my daughter with verbal speech apraxia.  This DVD has been a life saver.  Both Baby Babble DVD's made it fun for my daughter to want to learn more signs and perform mouth exercises.  I highly recommend this DVD to any parent with a child who is having a speech delay or has been diagnosed with verbal apraxia.  I recommended this DVD to her Speech Therapist and she too has gotten positive reviews from her other clients as well.,1221436800,,488,4.329670329670329
3246042,5,B000Y1NNH2,"As both the mom of an autistic child and an ABA therapist, I can heartily endorse both Baby Babble I and Baby Babble II.  They're wonderful for helping young children on the spectrum, as well as any child who's having difficulty with speech, learn new vocabulary and mouth & tongue movements. I recommend both videos in this series to my autistic clients, as well as to the parents of other kiddos with speech delays or apraxia.
The videos do seem a bit 'babyish', but trust me, they'll keep the attention of a typically-developing child up to age 4 or so...autistic kiddos even longer.  From one autie-mommy to another - please consider getting both!  My own son gained at least 12-20 new words from each viseo, just in a matter of a week or two...far faster than his speech-therapy sessions can produce new vocab.  Well worth the price!",1221177600,5,838,4.680272108843537

He is learning the signs and how to make the sounds to make words. It has also helped my and my husband work with him when he has trouble pronouncing a word. I cannot recommend these videos enough!

I got the first video when he was less than a year old. It used to be the only thing that calmed him down when he started to tantrum or melt down. I used to be amazed by the calming affect it had on him. Besides the fact that these videos are very addicting to young children, they are also great for helping with speech. My son is articulating his P, B, M words so much better now that he's been watching the 2nd video...they really do learn from these. Not to mention, my nearly 3 year old neurotypical son is just as addicted as his older brother. I love watching the two of them interact with each other as they are watching these videos. I especially love that there are a couple of popular characters in the 2nd video...particularly Thomas and Elmo. My boys get soooo excited when they see the Thomas toy as they are both addicted to Thomas. I like the sign language portion of the videos too and both boys enjoy it.  My autistic son even likes to watch the parent tutorials. I think he is just soothed by the music and Amy and Corey's voices. Anyway, if you are considering this...just go ahead and buy it.
