3589353,3,B001FW2R4E,"As a strident Smashing Pumpkins fan for well over a decade, I was elated to find out that a DVD was being released and I could understand the new direction of the band.  This band has inspired me for years with some of the most poignant lyrics, amazing musicianship, and of course the songs that will be forever steeped in nostalgia.  I remember when Viewphoria came out and how daily my teenage angst was emboldened through days of skipping school and watching a band that was destined for stardom.

This DVD is much different than the humble beginnings that the Pumpkins relunctantly endured.  The first disc is a documentary and one which I greatly appreciated being such a fan of the band.  I do wish there was a bit more perspective from the new members.  Nevertheless I found the documentary to give a pretty good summation of what the band is about and where they seem to be headed.

As for the live performance, this is where I was a bit disappointed.  I loved that they throw Starla in there, as well as the 35 minute epic Gossamer.  I will agree with one of the previous reviews in which someone stated that the new acoustic songs are a bit weak.  I would say mediocre at best, which I feel I'm at liberty to say being such a long tenured fan.  I feel this is where they really could have thrown curveballs and stirred the pot a bit.  The performance lacked energy in my opinion and the audience does show signs of boredom.  If you watch the last DVD in which they played *&^$ you (an ode to nowone), that my friend had energy.  When hair can stand on the back of my neck, I know I have been moved.  This simply did not happen on the live set.

In summation, I would only buy this if you are a true fan of the band.  I know the Pumpkins are an acquired taste.  People tend to love this band or absolutely abhor them.  If you love them, invest.  If not, save your money for you will be disappointed.",1226707200,2,1908,4.291316526610644
3589354,4,B001FW2R4E,"While it's not really something you would watch over and over, this documentary - which follows the newly reformed Pumpkins on a series of two residencies in Chicago and San Francisco in 2007 - is a highly watch able account and insight into the mind of one Billy Corgan, the man behind the Pumpkins and indeed, it's heart and soul.

Rest assured, this is an interesting piece even for non-fans, but don't expect a big classic band reunion or a even classic songs showcase here as there is very little besides conversations regarding such times. But this is not the film's intention after all and it's far more watch able because of it. We talk with Billy (of course), current members (only), fans and few a managers and PA's along the way in-between this awkward time when the band is relishing the opportunity to grow as artists with a fresh attitude, but also dealing with what it means to the world and it's fans when you say a band like the Pumpkins is active again.

A must see for old and new fans - or anyone just interested in song writing for that matter - this will, at the very least, give you insight into Corgan for the better or make you dislike him even more. For fans, however, the inclusion of many songs written and performed acoustic when the film was made are shown with much affection. Love or loathe though, he is one artist that can't be ignored, and neither should this film.",1226620800,3,1400,4.486274509803922
3589355,5,B001FW2R4E,"So I'll be honest, I bought this not for the documentary, but a nice, high fidelity copy of Gossamer (hey, it's an awesome 'jam' track!).  It had been disappointing to be unable to get any good bootleg tracks, so the Fillmore concert in high fidelity was nice.  The video quality leaves a little to be desired on the bonus feature tracks from the rehearsal, but the main feature quality was pretty good.

Packaging was top notch.

Just as a side note, I notices that there wasn't *any* css protection on the DVD which made ripping a little too convenient.  This makes me kinda wonder if this is a wink-wink-nudge-nudge from the band there.  Or their content distribution people are just incompetent.

Bottom line, even if you're not a die hard Pumpkin Head, this is a great concert and interesting documentary.",1226534400,8,810,4.742857142857143
3589356,1,B001FW2R4E,"very lame concert, nothing from there catalog that made them what they are
today. very disappointing, if all goes wrong, is the perfect title, i love the PUMPKINS, but this is a dvd i will be ""SMASHING"".
more acoustic than electric, too many new weak tracks.
felt sorry for the crowd, they looked bored and confused many times during the concert,  my review will probably upset many fans,
for which im sorry, but i refuse to kiss corgans behind, like many already have on this dvd. the track list just plain sucks!
wont waste my time on the documentary, like i did driving to the store to buy this....",1226361600,5,601,4.513761467889908
3589357,4,B001FW2R4E,"I found a copy of this being sold at a local record shop a few days ago (November 7th to be exact). Among other things, they sell a lot of ""tobacco"" water pipes and rolling papers so I wasn't surprised that they had this dvd on the shelf before it was supposed to be released. Needless to say, I very excitedly handed over the $21.99 to purchase it.

The two disks in this set are totally different, so I'll comment on them separately.

Disk one is a documentary. It does feature a few songs and some snippets of songs, but for the most part it's interviews. It's not something that I plan on watching again (unlike the concert disk!), but it was very informative. I've been a fan of the Pumpkins since I was old enough to be a fan of anything. And although most Pumpkin fans all miss the glory days of Siamese Dream and the like, I can't help but to have a lot of respect for their willingness to change ..  or, should I say, Billy Corgan's willingness to change. Personally, I'm still not sure what I make of Zwan, The Future Embrace, and Billy's decision to break the band up only to reunite it again seven years later. But what I do know, and what this documentary helped me to understand, is that Billy Corgan is the essence of the Smashing Pumpkins, and he's on a journey that will never stop evolving because he as a person will never stop evolving. He explains a lot of struggles he has dealt with, from therapy to trying to understand the fans, and how that has affected his artistic direction. What comes across most to me in this documentary is that Billy truly does want to keep on keepin' on with the Smashing Pumpkins. He wants to give us what he's always given us -- thoughtful songs, beautiful melodies, and superb musicianship. He still knows how to rock our socks off one minute and sing us to sleep the next. That hasn't changed.

The second disk (concert) is fantastic! The sound/video quality are great. I suppose the setlist might leave something to be desired for those looking for a lot of songs from their older catalog, but I was personally very impressed with the new material. Gossamer was a major highlight, and it rocked just as much as the live version of 'An Ode to No One' from the Pumpkins' Music Video DVD. Starla, an old favorite of mine, was also great. Billy's vocals were as good as any other show, Jimmy's playing was amazing as always, and I actually really liked watching the new members. Ginger, their bass player, really seems to have a knack for adding flare at just the right moments in a song. The keyboard player, Lisa Harriton, plays beautifully and adds incredible dimension to the music. Jeff Schroeder, guitar, is new as well, and he can actually keep up with Billy's playing. He has some solo spots throughout and proves over and over to the audience that he's worth listening to. All in all, I love the new SP cast. I'm also glad there's finally a Smashing Pumpkins concert DVD that you can watch all the way through, from one song to the next, without any interruptions or interviews thrown into the middle of it. Lord knows we've all been waiting for this.

Keep on rockin' Billy.",1226275200,27,3136,4.465968586387435
3589358,5,B001FW2R4E,"First off, let me say that SP allowing fans to record the residency shows in Asheville, NC was amazing and a fan's dream.  I thought having a DVD of being front row in Asheville, NC to watch and enjoy forever was the best item a true fan could have but I was mistaken... this DVD captuing the band's take of the residencies are a dream come true! It is great to see what the band's take of the shows are coupled with my own recorded DVD. Also, I agree with the review by Moonchild above that the product description sucks so I thought I would inlude some info I found from Pitchforkmedia.com ...

Smashing Pumpkins Chronicle Reunion on DVD

If All Goes Wrong is a double-disc affair. The first disc features the titular documentary, which chronicles the band's reunion and live residencies in San Francisco and Asheville, North Carolina last year through interviews with band members, fans, journalists, and other musicians.

The second disc of If All Goes Wrong features The Fillmore Residency, a collection of live performances from the band's residency in San Francisco. Also included are five bonus tracks lumped together as Live From the Floor of the Fillmore, which are just that. All told, the second disc of the DVD contains seven different exclusive new tracks.

3589359,5,B001FW2R4E,"I don't know who provided the description of this product but it sucks.  I found a website that explains a little more of what the dvd contains:
-105 minute documentary
-A full concert was filmed over 11 sold out shows in 2007
-A featurette about a fan club called Voices of the Ghost Children
and many more goodies
The cover art is gorgeous.  The packaging superb.
My copy of this work arrived in the mail yesterday.  I was able to watch the documentary.  Very well done.  What an insight to the world of progress of artistic directions and views and the frustrations that come with it.  Very stirring to me.  An evolution.  That is the most I can say about my reaction to it.  Who cares what I think there.
I love how the same style of lyric writing is still being used.  It was gorgeous in the acustic pieces.  I will always love the way he expresses the words.  I'm sure I will enjoy watching the 2nd disc for the concert footage, as I love how their expertise in playing their instruments is as easy as breathing and that's exhilarating to watch.
I can't edit how many stars I gave this product in the beginning before viewing the product.  I leave it at 5 for the great production, care, and soul that went into it, but I give it 3 stars for how the documentary left me feeling in the end.",1223424000,10,1295,4.301652892561983
3589360,1,B001FW2R4E,"the title says it all. been a fan since 1990 so i was looking forward to this but after seeing the""concert"" part i wonder if this so called producer had a clue what a concert doc. really is!!!!! this just sucks!!!",1247443200,,213,4.219512195121951
3589361,4,B001FW2R4E,"I am a big SP fan, so of course I like it, but others probably will not. A simple decision.",1242864000,,91,3.6
3589362,3,B001FW2R4E,"Not the first classic hit..I don't know why he calls them The Smashing Pumpkins if he isn't doing any of their hits.  They could at least do a few in a encore performance at the end of the show! Give us Bullet With Butterfly Wings! or 1979 or something that we remember from your heyday!
the new songs are good too but I wanted a concert with the classics too!",1236124800,3,360,4.142857142857143
3589363,2,B001FW2R4E,"Okay, I am a huge fan of the pumpkins. I own all of their albums, and though I agree there are some weak moments, I love them all.  Unfortunately, I was turned on to the pumpkins at the end of their career before their breakup and had to get used to the idea that the end was all I had.  Of course, the virgin festival arrived with news that the pumpkins were reforming, at least the driving members, to rock out.  You better believe I wasn't missing that show; and it was a great show.  But this DVD isn't for casual pumpkins fans.  If you loved the old tunes, you won't find many.  In fact, I will go as far to say that if Billy is so hard up about moving on, he shouldn't use the name ""smashing pumpkins"".  I kind of feel that he is capitalizing on the brand name.  ""Zwan"" obviously didn't work.  one major thing I liked about the pumpkins is the intricacy and depth of the tunes, but the last time I saw them, half of the night was spent with his acoustic guitar and songs he had written very recently, which were underdeveloped.  I can dig that, but you have to give it a new name.  People expect the rock show, and just get the try-outs.
It's a good show, but don't expect a ""smashing pumpkins"" show.  That show might be over.",1229990400,4,1232,4.151898734177215
3589364,5,B001FW2R4E,"As a long-time fan of the Smashing Pumpkins, I thought that this was a great docu-film. I really shows a ""behind-the-scenes"" look at the post reunion band during the first part of their tour. It is neat to hear songs for the first time ever on here and being able to watch Billy Corgan as he writes the songs almost on camera. The 2nd disc was also very fun to watch, it was songs taken from the very shows that the documentary was about.
I will add one more thing, if you are not a fan of The Smashing Pumpkins or if you are expecting a lot of the old band, then you might not enjoy this very much. Otherwise it is worth the watch.",1229731200,,632,4.064
3589365,4,B001FW2R4E,"Filmed in HD, but not shown in HD. I thought it was a gimmick, but I was surprised at how sharp the image quality turned out.

Disc 1:
If All Goes Wrong (Documentary) - It's interesting following the Pumpkins and seeing what they went through after they reformed and and performed for the first time. The DVD shows what inspired Billy to write some new material. It also gives a new insight into Billy, which I appreciate as a fan. I was a little disappointed at how little attention was paid to the new band members, but they must have been shy anyway.

Interview with Peter Townshend - I enjoyed this feature very much as he talks about the psychology of artists, fans, and how they interact.

The Voice of the Children was just some fans talking about the band with the following depth: ""I excited to be here. Broke, but excited."" It was just a nonsense of excitement.

Disc 2:
This disc is live performance of some of the new material that was written just after they reformed. Half of it is acoustic and most of it is slow pace, lacking much energy or emotion - that is to say that there is no surrounding sound expression as in how the Pumpkins previously sounded. The Heavy Metal Machine version here sounds much different than the original - I'm not fond of it. The two standouts are the hard rocking Gossamer at about 30 minutes long, and Superchrist.

It was worth it alone for the documentary in disc 1 and Gossamer of disc 2 - I'm still waiting for the mp3 of that song.",1228608000,3,1482,4.394160583941606
3589366,5,B001FW2R4E,"A great set, the documentary alone would be worth buying, throw in a rarities heavy live dvd(amazingly good audio mix btw.) and a 5 song stripped down acoustic set of brand new songs and purchasing this should be a no brainer. Fans from back in the day, who haven't kept up with recent tunes, shouldn't be scared off by the absense of familiar hit singles, since this release serves as a perfect introduction to who and what the band is now.",1227225600,2,441,4.45679012345679
3589367,5,B001FW2R4E,"I don't have much to add that the other reviewers have not already mentioned.  I thought the Documentary was a little anemic.  It wasn't bad... but it could have been a lot better.  It seemed quickly thrown together and poorly edited.  Something you might expect from a senior film major and not a blockbuster.  Still, it's something that every pumpkins fan should watch.  Although I should warn you that it does humanize Billy in a way that is seldom seen.  The legions of Corgan Worshipers may want to skip it.

Like others have said:  The Concert Disc (2).  Is simple Amazing!  Multiple audio options including full DTS 5.1 Support and excellent camera work make it look, sound, and feel like you are right there.  Fans looking to see their favorite songs may be disappointed, but really folks, why do you want to hear the same songs you already have.  I was elated that there where many well mixed, unreleased songs performed.  My perspective may be different than the average pumpkins fan.  I enjoy Billy's solo acoustic work above all else, my favorite SP recording is the Acoustic Machina Demo's.

It's a great deal at $16... 5 stars.  My only wish is that they would have released it in blu-ray...",1227225600,,1205,4.688995215311005
3589368,5,B001FW2R4E,"Two discs, 3+ hours.  If you are a true SP fan, you will enjoy this.  In my opinion, Gossamer is the best song and Rose March is up there too.  Don't expect the Pumpkins from your teenage years.  Move on....",1226880000,,207,4.1
3589369,4,B001FW2R4E,"If all goes wrong is being touted as a live concert dvd, but i believe that is a mislabel. It is more of a documentary (which should be required viewing to fully appreciate the concert dvd)and then they throw in a concert on the 2nd dvd in the set. If all goes wrong is all about the residencies in Asheville and San Francisco, if you are looking for anything further than that music wise then I say look elsewhere. There are no big hits like ""bullet with butterfly wings"" ""cherub rock"" ""Disarm"" or any of the big Pumpkin hits. The documentary highlights the new songs that were written during the residencies and focus's completely on where those songs came from and what Corgan's train of thought was when he wrote each one. It is a honest and truthful look at the song writing process Corgan went through in order to pen each one. Aside from the residency songs Gossamer is thrown in at the end of the documentary and it is explained a bit as to why it ballooned to a 37 minute jam fest. Overall the documentary is excellent and i would give it 4 1/2 to 5 stars. It is interesting and is a must view for any pumpkins fan.

On the other hand the concert portion is what most people will end up buying the dvd for and I'm sorry to say they will more than likely be disappointed even if, like me, they like all of the songs played. The set list in a single viewing seems to be missing something. It is ...if i dare say so kinda boring. Don't get me wrong I love most of the new residency songs. ""Peace and Love"" is excellent and should be released officially along with ""99 floors"" and ""Mama"" among others. However, here they are stripped down and along with the other songs that were picked like an alternate take on ""Blue skies bring tears"" and a stripped down ""crying tree of mercury"" there just seems to be no energy at all. I watched the concert dvd first (like I'm guessing a lot of fans will) and was greatly disappointed but then after viewing the documentary I appreciated and liked it a bit more. I still thought more should have been done about the pacing and the placement of the songs, but then again thats the point of the whole thing...they do things their way. I actually think the concert footage is excellent as long as you skip around and listen to a song here or there and then give it a bit and come back and listen to another song or two. Its definitely not something I'm gonna stick in the dvd player and watch all the way through over and over. The other fillmore rehearsal versions of the songs are excellent, I only wish ""The Rose March"" would have been included in these, but overall its nice to have these more rehearsed and intimate versions as well. All in all i would give disc two a 3 to 3 1/2 star rating.

In closing as an overall package I would say its a 4 out of 5 and is a must buy for any pumpkins fan. It might seem a bit disappointing at first mainly because we have all been waiting for the metro dvd for years and we get this one instead...so with that being said don't expect the metro, expect a dvd fully dedicated to the residency songs and you won't be disappointed at all.",1226707200,5,3120,4.268581081081081

8302841,4,B001FW2R4E,"Not the best rockumentary I've seen, but it's an interesting insight to some of Corgan's perspectives. I've always had a strange fascination with Corgan. I have serious respect for his music (earlier stuff) but the dude can be straight up crazy. It shows some of his struggles as a musician trying to achieve his more recent goals and not just live in the past. Everyone wants the old Smashing Pumpkins back (myself included) but that chapter is closed. The music portion is so-so. I don't really care much for his newer songs, but for a smashing pumpkins acoustic set it wasn't bad. Don't get me wrong, a lot of their music sounds amazing on acoustic, Corgan just isn't the best singer ;P",1397347200,,689,4.655737704918033
