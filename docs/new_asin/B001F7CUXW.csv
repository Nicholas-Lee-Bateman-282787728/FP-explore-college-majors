Great information and highlights why people visit Alaska by water or overland. Beautiful area of the world we should all check out!! Great service and great product! Highly recommended.,1441065600,,290,4.938775510204081

8301172,5,B001F7CUXW,"I lived in Alaska in 1973 (a one year remote at King Salmon Station in the Air Force). I took 30 days leave in the summer to travel and I traveled to Kodiak on personal business.  I bought this video to look at the Inland Passage cruise and was surprised that the ""cruise"" continued all the way to Prudhoe Bay on the North Slope. I had traveled on trains in Alaska and it is a great way to see Alaska. BTW the video is 120 minutes long. I was impressed with the  cruise ship portion of the trip but I don't expect to try it.  A coworker is going soon and I will let her preview her trip.  Some people don't do the research to know what side trips are good for them and miss the unadvertised experiences.  I love doing the research and knowing what to expect.  Life has enough surprises and blessings due to God's love of all of us.  Captain Thomas F.
