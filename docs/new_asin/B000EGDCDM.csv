8109098,1,B000EGDCDM,This was awful and was only about 10 minutes long.  I think there might be a problem with it?,1465862400,,93,3.8947368421052633
8109099,1,B000EGDCDM,"Do not rent this.. it ends abruptly, is not worth the price you paid... I am sorry i did, maybe you won't make the same mistake I did..",1460764800,3,135,3.857142857142857
8109100,2,B000EGDCDM,"I understand the frustration of previous reviewers who were unable to watch this video due to technical problems, but I would like to assure them that they didn't miss much.  There is nothing groundbreaking revealed in this production. It includes stock footage of the Antarctic and the battlefields of WWI that are not of great quality.  The  authentic pictures of Shackleton's exploits are easily seen elsewhere.  The three talking head experts from Cambridge are annoying personalities.  The silly ""reenactments,"" which are little more than tableaux, consist of men who look nothing like Shackleton or any of his crew standing almost motionless in costumes against a white backdrop in glaring light.  They appear about as exciting as an unimaginative museum diorama.

However, what is really alarming about this documentary is the amount of misinformation it contains, especially on dates.  For example, at the end the narrator gives the date of Sir Ernest Shackleton's death as January 7, 1916.  In fact, he died two days earlier on January 5.  Shortly after the narrator makes this astonishing error, a shot of Shackleton's grave marker on South Georgia clearly shows the correct date of his death etched in stone.  Was it that hard to notice the discrepancy?  This careless lack of fact checking indicates how little anyone seemed to care about this presentation, and it shows.

For an accurate and far more stirring introduction to Shackleton, try SHACKLETON'S VOYAGE OF ENDURANCE from NOVA, or THE ENDURANCE; SHACKLETON'S LEGENDARY ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION, an award-nominated documentary narrated by Liam Neeson, or SHACKLETON; ESCAPE FROM ANTARCTICA, or the A&E Biography of Shackleton, LOOKING SOUTH.  Best yet, see the original documentary made in 1919 from the Endurance expedition's own movies, entitled simply SOUTH.  These motion pictures and stills were taken by the expedition's intrepid photographer, Frank Hurley, and Shackleton himself used them to illustrate his lectures on the expedition.",1451260800,3,2008,5.432258064516129
8109101,1,B000EGDCDM,"This was about a ten minute program, stopped abruptly, in the middle of some guys sentence. Total waste of money.",1449014400,3,113,4.7
8109102,1,B000EGDCDM,"This video is defective.  It is only 10 minutes long and stops in mid sentence.  I received a refund.
Don't rent it.",1442275200,2,116,4.2272727272727275
8109103,1,B000EGDCDM,Downloaded this but it would only play chapter 1. Downloaded another on YouTube and it played perfectly,1426896000,,103,5.117647058823529
8109104,1,B000EGDCDM,This video is indeed incomplete.  There is much more to the story than an 10-12 minute video.,1426204800,,93,4.470588235294118
8109105,1,B000EGDCDM,"The video is incomplete, too short, cut off at the end.",1424044800,,55,4.090909090909091
8109106,3,B000EGDCDM,"In all fairness, the documentary ""The Endurance"" may have used this work as its stepping stone.  ""The Endurance"" was longer, went into more detail, and clearly had a larger budget.  Still, you may want to see both as this work went more into Shackleton's early years and previous voyages.  ""The Endurance"" had foreign language subtitles when this work did not, by the way.

This work had few interviewees and they were non-diverse.  However, Shackleton's crew was non-diverse and probably small in number too.  One interviewee had a shaggy, graying beard that may have been a tribute to the same beards that you see on Shackleton's crew.

Talk about cheesy reenactments!  This work clearly had no budget to try to accurately portray the past.  They just took a bunch of fake snow and any old winter coat and hired any ol' unemployed actors and shot the scenes.  Granted, it provides motion and dynamism to something that could have only had grainy, black-and-white photos.  Still, the cheese factor is high!",1200441600,7,1007,4.934523809523809
