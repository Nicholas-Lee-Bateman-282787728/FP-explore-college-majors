8082666,2,B000B73H9I,"I am missing a sense and the spirit in the DVD, it is boring.
Look at the body and face of Mr. Milton, he is a bad example for his 3 DVD's.
How old is he ? I do not believe in his strength or longevity.",1289433600,,202,3.4130434782608696
8082667,5,B000B73H9I,"Mr. Milton is an excellent teacher.  His deliberate style provides the viewer with excellent practices, powerful insights and the basic fundamentals of Qi Gong.  Anyone who wants to develop personal strength and confidence will appreciate what he or she learns from this DVD.  If you are not fortunate to have a live instructor,  this DVD is the very next best thing!  I enjoy working with this product over and over, and I notice the benefits every day!",1237593600,3,454,4.8441558441558445
8082668,4,B000B73H9I,"This DVD is very well done, I enjoy the postures and the explanations of what you are doing and WHY are you doing it. My only critism of this product is that might not be suitable for complete beginners for practictioners of Qi Gong, unless you are already familiar with basic concepts.
This is a wonderful addition to my Qi Gong and Tai Chi classes, but I benifit from three wonderful local Qi gong teachers in person.  If the person watching this video is in a remote location, or too busy to get to a class, AND is familiar with basic concepts E.G.Dantian, Kwa, Bubbling well, Longau points then this video is the next best thing to actually having a live instructor, if you are exploring the world of Qi Gong and are just curious, I would probably explore one of his other videos.",1219795200,8,784,4.444444444444445
8082669,5,B000B73H9I,"In an age of increased emotional and spiritual malaise the ability to heal oneself, and to become a healing agent in the world around us, is no longer a luxury (not that it ever was).  The ability to integrate the wisdom and spiritual practice of ancient traditions is essential.  John P. Milton's work continues to be internationally recognized as a profound integration of wisdom traditions.  This DVD comes as close to dancing T'ai Ji in one of his classes that I can imagine.  As a Sacred Psychologist I offer his guidance to all that are serious about healing the split between Inner and Outer worlds that is necessary for our continued evolution.  As a 35-year T'ai Ji practitioner I recommend it enthusiastically for personal practice and spiritual renewal.",1216512000,5,764,4.9375
8082670,5,B000B73H9I,"I have seen many Tai Chi and Qigong DVDs and John P. Milton's 3-disk series is one of the absolute best available today! The exercises on ""Develop Qi Strength and Power"" helped me connect to my own energy (or chi) and explains the importance of these exercises for maintaining strength and health throughout the entire body. I'm amazed at the increased vitality my body has as a result of doing these practices.  Once you learn the exercises from the DVD, you can then take the included laminated cards with you to do your practice anywhere. I recommend these disks for everyone from beginners to advanced students.",1214006400,6,615,4.80188679245283
