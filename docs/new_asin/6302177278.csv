7822477,1,6302177278,"John Fante writes the lightest and tightest prose in the English language, period. He is understandably Charles Bukowski's favorite writer. (Mine, too, in terms of pure craft.) Why is it that, from the head-shakingly misguided ""Ask the Dust,"" to the hobbled leper of ""Wait Until Spring..."", film maker after film maker insists upon making these movies that clearly show that these directors have missed entirely the laugh-out-loud humor of narrator/protagonist Arturo Bandini, the self-loathing Italian Napoleon? Like Ignatious from ""Confederacy of Dunces,"" Bandini is a howlingly tragic/funny vision of grandiosity. (I'll limit further comment to ""Wait Until Spring..."")
The tone is wrong from start to finish. Casting and all that... there is nowhere to go when you start out with the wrong blueprint. Avoid, avoid, avoid this dreadful film. Pick up one of the books. (My favorite is ""The Road to Los Angeles."")",1367884800,,913,5.391608391608392

7822479,1,6302177278,"Dear God,

If you're really up there, how can you let people do something so horrible to such a great book? This movie is an absolute monstrosity, and everyone involved with it should hang themselves. Fante is a genius. Do NOT attempt to alter his works.",1093564800,7,254,4.521739130434782
7822480,1,6302177278,They took a great book and turned it into an unwatchable movie. any fan of John Fante (author of the book) should not see this.. IT WAS  HORRIBLE. i wish there was someway to go back and take the name off of it. READ THE BOOK by Fante. don't watch the movie,1033689600,7,257,3.9423076923076925
