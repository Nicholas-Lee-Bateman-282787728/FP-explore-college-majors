8101529,4,B000CS43NK,"Did you ever wonder what real-life modern-day vampires do in the privacy of their own crypts? Mr. Creepo, a semi-mythical being and Lord of the Underworld, opens the secret sepulchre of the Dark Immortals wide open and invites us into their secret, sensual and sanguine world.

Shot in a rough and raw style that mirrors the primal nature of its subjects, Bloodsucking Vampire Freaks takes us on a tour of today's underground vampire scene: after-hour clubs, fanged bands, private blood-parties and even a vampire parade.

Mr. Creepo and Dr. Joni Jenson provide us with a historical overview of the nosferatu and their legends. And the vampire themselves speak! Persephone and her sister succubi writhe in sapphic ecstacy as they introduce us to the dark wonders of their forever-night world.

There are some bizarre dream-like sequences and clips from the Alpha Studios Crowley flicks that push you even deeper into the nether realms while you're watching Bloodsucking Vampire Freaks.

Be warned: this dracumentary is for mature audiences. Parts of it may not only outrage or appall you, but place your very soul in dire  jeopardy!

The film is accompanied by two bonus DVDs. In one we're treated to an interview of Mr. Creepy himself and trailers from his fast-growing library of shlock-horror films. The titiles say it all: Skin Eating Jungle Vampires, Punk Rock Zombie Kung Fu Catfight and Driller... The second DVD contains the entire Dr. Jensen interview, with additional material on vampires in popular culture.

As a fan of Troma, ei Entertainment, Roger Corman, Dino Bava and really low-buget muscleman epics, I -Thor the Barbarian- give Bloodsucking Vampire Freaks a bloody thumbs-up.
