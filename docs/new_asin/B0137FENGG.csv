7360693,5,B0137FENGG,"This is a DVD-R, but, by purchasing it, you are directly supporting  the director/screenwriter, William Richert,  a genuine maverick whose conflicts with the Hollywood establishment are almost legendary. While there isn't a  menu or subtitles, the print is as good as the old Anchor Bay edition. The 30 second or so original ending was culled from another source, so the quality isn't as good. But having Richert's vision intact is more than adequate compensation. As for the film itself, well, it's truly one-of-a-kind; a scathing, extremely dark comedic examination (loosely based on the Kennedy assassination) of what has always driven government/politics, and, is now more apparent than ever.",1489622400,9,696,5.425925925925926

8727037,5,B0137FENGG,"This was like discovering a big wad of cash behind the couch cushions. I saw  this movie once on TV with edits and censorship and commercials and then looked for it and could never find it. Seeing the Director's Cut for the first time it's just an amazing film. Equal parts satire, commentary, and drama. It reminds me of Dr. Strangelove in that sense (which for me is about as high praise as I can give a movie). And the cast is outstanding. I've always been a big fan of Jeff Bridges but more for his later work like Big Lebowski. I forgot he was just as good when he was young and a hunky leading man. The rest of the cast is excellent as well. If you have read some of the JFK conspiracy books a lot of this will be familiar to you, although they also don't stick to any of the conspiracy theories. I don't want to give away the ending because it's one of the few times that a movie actually surprised me at the end except I will say that the first time I saw it, I didn't like the ending because I thought it was so improbable but in hindsight and seeing the actual film I get the point the screen writer was making and it's simply genius. This is a very unconventional film and if you are a strong believer in the Warren Commission or if you just want to see something that is a realistic portrayal of what most conspiracy theorists believe you probably won't like it. But if you take it as I think the writer and director intended I think it makes a really strong statement and is fun to watch as well.",1527379200,,1509,4.150170648464163

8727039,4,B0137FENGG,"This is a God-awful bad for 3/4 of the movie, but the ending makes up for it.  By bad, I mean 70s prime-time soaps bad, enough to keep your interest, barely.  Yes, you guessed the ending 5 minutes into the movie, and yet it gets more absurd, because you didn't.  It's an ending that would be more comfortable to us in 2018 than in 1982, but still I need a shower.  I watched this through based on Jeff Bridges, he hasn't made many turkeys.  John Huston, Eli Wallach, and Anthony Perkins IN 1979!!!  What a cast choice, guaranteed to go against the grain. especially when the closet still existed back then.  And how precocious!  Someone in Hollywood understood IT before 1979, dressed up that turkey with all the stuffing and trimmings , and served it up fresh, hot, and moist.  Sometimes it's a tough meal to swallow, but when you get done, you'll sit back, sigh, and burp.",1523664000,,874,4.481012658227848

8727041,1,B0137FENGG,"This piece of crap is a total waste of time. People mistake 'quirky' for being 'artsy.' If you want to judge for yourself, watch the first 5 minutes. Remember, the idiocy you see in the first 5 is the same idiocy you're going to see throughout. What might play out fine in a book doesn't do the same in a movie. Bridges' character learns who set up the hit on his brother while Bridges is on a ship near Brisbane. He goes to Philly to learn more about the hit. People are killed inexplicably. And that's meant to 'build suspense.' I finally turned it off. Utter crap.",1522195200,4,567,4.308411214953271

8727044,5,B0137FENGG,"This is one excellent movie!  I have not seen since it came out [sometime in the 70's I believe].  In the vein of Kennedy asassination films of the era [EXECUTIVE ACTION; THE PARALLEX VIEW] this is superior to all.

If you enjoy outstanding film making and this genre, I recommend this highly.",1512777600,4,293,4.596153846153846
