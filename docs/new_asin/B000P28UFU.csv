2807315,5,B000P28UFU,"Merengue is the easiest Latin dance to learn and has been one of my favorite dances. If you're looking for more danceable moves in this dance, then I would recommend this DVD. The instructions are easy to follow because of the ""breakdown"" of the steps and the actual link to the next step.",1269043200,,289,4.471698113207547
2807316,5,B000P28UFU,This DVD was excellent.  The music was great.  The instructors had great personalities that made it exciting for you to learn the steps.  The patterns were easy to follow.  I highly recommend this DVD.,1258329600,3,201,4.823529411764706
2807317,5,B000P28UFU,"Dancing didn't used to be my thing, but recently, I've been getting these Salsa Crazy dvds and I really like them. My girl loves them too. I think what's happening is that once you start dancing, each dance seems easier to pick up.

This one was pretty good because it went from beginner's to intermediate. I'm feeling pretty confident in my merengueing.",1211328000,8,354,4.709677419354839
2807318,5,B000P28UFU,"Before I saw this video, I was doing my best to merengue. But, to be honest, I was not that good at it. Now, after going through this video, it was so easy to get the moves down. I also learned another dance by using videos from this same company, Salsacrazy. They have all been very good and I like them.

If you want to learn right, use these videos like me!",1209945600,4,360,4.0
2807319,5,B000P28UFU,"Salsacrazy has some of the best dance dvd's around. I have the full salsa, and bachata series dvds as well and would recommend them as just as good or better. All the dvd's are not boring to watch and they break down the moves many times including showing how it is danced with music. I would recommend this dvd or any of the others to any person looking to improve their skills or who is just starting to learn.",1185494400,16,412,4.227848101265823
2807320,5,B000P28UFU,"Clear instructions and fun patterns make this DVD a pleasure to watch. This DVD will enhance your Merengue dancing, especially for beginner and intermediate dancers. The dance patterns shown can also be adapted for Salsa as well. DVD price is a bit expensive but well worth it.",1184284800,12,277,4.914893617021277

2807323,5,B000P28UFU,"SalsaCrazy sent me this Dance Dvd for testing purposes and for my honest review and I am telling you, this will get you moving! It is fun and exercise at the same time! You get the beginners and the intermediate all on one dvd! The merengue reminded me of the Salsa dance a little! It was a lot of fun watching my husband try to move his hips and do this dance! Even the kids were trying!! It is always a family event with these DVD's, which is ok, because then i know, everyone is getting is getting their hearts racing and their blood pumping, all while having so much fun laughing at each other!! Good Times!!",1423699200,,612,4.239316239316239
2807324,5,B000P28UFU,"Another great dance mastery dvd from DanceCrazy.com - this is one that is not extremely well-known as the Salsa or the Waltz is, but it is a very fun dance to learn and do!  And surprisingly one of the easiest to learn out of all the dance dvd's I have received so far :)  The instruction is superb just like the others with 2 instructors showing you each move separately and then putting them all together.  And the best part of all of these is that you don't have to go to just 1 class a week or a few times a month and expect to learn with just a few hours of practice - you can use these anytime from the privacy of your own home.  So even if you are a complete novice with dancing and feel very uncomfortable in front of others this will allow you to learn simply and easily without embarrassment :)  While you are checking this dvd out, look at their other products like the Waltz, the Bachata, the Salsa and much more!  Enjoy :)  I received a complimentary product to test.",1422576000,,980,4.180851063829787
2807325,5,B000P28UFU,"I have used and reviewed several DVDs by SalsaCrazy and DanceCrazy. I received this to review as I have reviewed several other dance DVDs in the past.  With SalsaCrazy's earlier releases there were some minor technical issues, but they keep getting better and better. I love this Merengue dance instructional. The bottom line--a couple could get this DVD and follow along and practice the material than hit the clubs and look great dancing Merengue. It won't get you ready for Dancing With The Stars, but it will show you the basics including musical interpretation.

I think the quality of instruction is excellent. Alison Hurwitz and Jesus Ortiz do a good jub in breaking down the technique and the music.  This is true of all the SalsaCrazy and DanceCrazy instructional DVDs I have reviewed. The instruction includes basic technique, several moves and combinations, rhythm and music, dance etiquette and a little cultural information. This DVD includes a lot of content.

I have heard Merengue described as a gateway Latin dance as the footwork can be simple compared to some other styles of Latin dance. I think if you learn the moves in this instructional DVD and gain a sense of the music, you could go to a club and have a great time socially dancing Merengue. Not only will you have a great time, you will look great doing it. I have said this about other instructional DVDs from SalsaCrazy because it is true.

The great thing about a DVD is that you can review and practice as much as you want. I don't consider it a substitute for a live class, but sometimes a class isn't practical or available locally. Also, sometimes a DVD is a good supplement to live classes.",1422489600,,1675,4.742268041237113
2807326,5,B000P28UFU,"The entire set (both beginning and intermediate) are broken down in minute details. One of the great things is how well they break it down to the point where they even show you small things you might be doing wrong. I think if I did beginning until I felt comfortable with it and moved on to intermediate I'd feel perfectly comfortable with this dance. I have to admit I'm still working with the beginner, but I check out intermediate.

I've had my son be my dance partner. He wasn't entire thrilled with the pace of things - he wanted it all to go fast, but he's 7 so it goes with the territory. This is a great DVD I can easily see him trying to learn the steps better when he's older to try to impress a girl.

I think the dancers are fabulous and very supportive throughout the entire thing. Never once do the break from that perfect couple, but they always seem to know where you might be struggling and give yo",1422316800,,916,4.258620689655173
2807327,5,B000P28UFU,Excellent routine even my Dance Instructor wants to borrow it.,1422144000,,62,5.3
2807328,4,B000P28UFU,"With all the dancing reality series on television, it is a no-brainer why learning to dance and other dancing workout DVDs are so popular today. These types of DVDs are an easy way for an individual or couple to learn how to dance in the comfort of their own home.

Recently, I have been trying out several of these types of programs from DancyCrazy and the latest one I have been experimenting with is called Learn To Dance: Merengue - Beginning and Intermediate.

Merengue is a blend of dance and music from the Dominican Republic. Of course eventually this style of music reached the United States and continued to be popular with dancers.

This DVD has a male and a female instructor who gives you a step-by-step guide on how to learn the basic moves for the Merengue. You'll learn the Basics, Beginning Patterns and Intermediate Patterns.

Similar to other DancyCrazy DVDs, the production values is pretty low, especially with the use of the same yellowish curtains and flooring, though this DVD does have some multiple camera angles and picture-in-picture, which you can get a closer look at the dancers' feet. If you can ignore the set and just pay attention to the instructions, you can easily learn how to do these dance moves. Overall, Learn To Dance: Merengue - Beginning and Intermediate DVD is a fast and simple way to learn how to dance; even those with two left feet will pick up the moves quickly.

2807329,5,B000P28UFU,"I just recently received the merengue dvd and I have to say I am very surprised of the many, many moves merengue has. It is a lot of fun and yes everything in life is hard work especially if you want to dance like the pros. I would recommend this merengue dvd for the beginner and the more advanced there is a lot of  swings here and there that you can pick up along the way to ,
make this dvd to be danced with the right moves and there are some sensually moves that makes this dvd a pleasure to be danced with your significant other!",1420848000,,535,4.0
2807330,5,B000P28UFU,"OK, yea, this was FUN!
I didn't have a partner to practice with, and I have a bum knee, but this was such a fun DVD to learn to dance with and the music is great!

The couple in the DVD work very well together, are easy to understand, and the flow is perfect for me.

I have not memorized this yet, but it's going to be great to use for weight-loss :)",1419811200,,351,3.7945205479452055
2807331,5,B000P28UFU,I really liked there passion for dancing and both instructors encouraging manner. I am not sure how well I will learn the merengue but I do see myself at least trying with this dvd again. My spouse found the instructions straightforward and easy to understand as well. For a complete review,1419552000,,290,4.705882352941177
2807332,5,B000P28UFU,SalsaCrazy really has these DVDs down! I had a great time learning this dance and their instructions made it fun and simple and took the hassle out of learning a dance! Try them out if you haven't before!,1419120000,,204,4.394736842105263
2807333,5,B000P28UFU,"I got this Merengue Dancing DVD lesson disc for free from SalsaCrazy to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion.

I wanted to review this item because my kids are interested in various kinds of dances, and my husband who is from Mexico is always talking about various Latin dances and how we should go out dancing. I'm always reluctant because I don't know any of them and don't want to look silly.

This is an upbeat dance that makes you move a lot so it will also be a good form of exercise and this DVD makes it easy to learn. This disk goes at a really slow pace showing you first how to do the basic step. Then as you practice it slowly adds on additional movements for the rest of your body. They really break it down at a speed and with explanations that I can really understand. It also will have a close up on their feet in the lower corner of the screen so you can either watch their whole body, or just the section with the feet.

I may not be doing it perfect but I'm not looking as much like a weirdo as I used to!",1418947200,,1045,4.063106796116505

2807336,5,B000P28UFU,"Wonderful activity for a date night! I don't think I have laughed so much while hubster and I were trying to learn the steps.

This would be fun to learn in a small group setting too. The steps are clearly explained.

We had so much fun..can't wait to go out and practice our new moves.

Although this item was purchased with a promotional code or discount coupon, all opinions are mine.",1418601600,,387,4.422535211267606
2807337,5,B000P28UFU,"Yes, another dance DVD review!  Can you tell I have found an activity I enjoy?  I was so excited to get the Merengue Dance DVD from SalsaCrazy!  This DVD system is a little different from some of the others, as it includes
beginning, intermediate, and even advanced Merengue dance instruction in one DVD!  You will learn how to dance the Merengue right in your own home.  The steps are broken down with tips and awesome music!  Each dance move is broken down completely and has in-depth instructions from the dance instructors.  You learn essential tips for success on the dance floor and how to dance to the music.  The demonstrations are very detailed and you are shown different camera angles.  The picture in picture close ups are very helpful as well.  This is a great Latin dance that will make you feel graceful, while getting in shape.  The Merengue is a dance that can inspire romance and fun!
