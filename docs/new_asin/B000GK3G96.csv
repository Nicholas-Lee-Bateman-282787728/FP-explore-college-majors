2614730,3,B000GK3G96,"I purchased this dvd to learn how to loom knit.  It's very good for teaching you the basics-if thats all you want to know.  From glancing through books I know you can do other stitches on them and that's what I was hoping it would show. It would also have been nice if they showed you how to knit using ""non circular"" looms but that didn't happen either.  Not sure if I would recommend it to anyone.",1221177600,,399,4.1558441558441555
2614731,5,B000GK3G96,"I already reviewed this product, but I do not see my reveiw on the website, so anyway, I agree this is a must have if you are a beginner.  You can work along and that makes it very easy.  Excellent DVD",1219968000,,201,3.8780487804878048
2614732,3,B000GK3G96,I was not happy when I got the first one as it didn't work. I never heard back from anyone till one day I received another one. That one does work. I was very happy to finally get one that did work. I was just wondering why I never heard anything from the seller. But it all work out just fine.,1206835200,,294,3.8360655737704916
2614733,5,B000GK3G96,"This dvd is must, very easy to understand and very well put together.
After watching it for the first time i was able to use my kniffty knitter which i have had for 2years.
Thank you",1203206400,,182,4.083333333333333
2614734,5,B000GK3G96,So glad I purchased this DVD after reading reviews by others here. If you have been struggling with written instructions and don't have access to lessons at Michaels or Joann this item is for you.,1186790400,8,196,4.628571428571429
2614735,5,B000GK3G96,"This was an excellent product.  I had purchased the Knifty Knitter round looms and was somewhat confused about how to begin working  with them.  This DVD was clear and easy to follow.  Being able to rewind and repeat the instructions or to pause was a real plus.

Knitting instructor, Beth Hill, is a gifted teacher.  She thoroughly showed each step of the loom knitting process and addressed some of the errors you might be making during your first projects.

I am much more confident with my abilities to create fun and attractive knitted items.  Following other loom patterns should be easier now that I have learned the basics.

I am hoping that Hills Brother Studios will film a DVD on Long Loom Knitting next.  I would definately purchase something on that subject.

Thanks to the Hill Brothers Studios for this wonderful DVD.",1174262400,24,832,4.788732394366197
2614736,4,B000GK3G96,"For those of you for which the book instruction is not enough. This is a GREAT instructional dvd. This is a wonderful way to learn to knit on a round loom. You can stop, start, and slow down the dvd.  The pace was slow enough for you to follow along, but not too slow.  The speech was clear and concise. You learn at YOUR own pace. Repeat something as many times as you need to get it right.  No pressure!  It was great!  When I completed my first project, I was so proud!  This is a great dvd and a wonderfully pleasant way to learn. I would also like to highly recommend the Knitting with Needles dvd by the same company.  [...] has a sample clip of a lesson.",1169164800,28,661,4.077519379844961
2614737,5,B000GK3G96,"I am so glad that I ordered this DVD. I recently bought a Knifty Knitter set from Herschners online store and a couple of books here on Amazon on how to use them. While the books aren't that confusing, this video cleared up a lot of questions. It was great to see the priojects done in first person view. They are very easy to follow. :) The DVD gave me a better understanding of what was being done on the loom. I can now follow the books prett easily. Thanks.",1165881600,44,461,4.133333333333334
2614738,5,B000GK3G96,After looking everywhere for a good beginners tutorial I found the American Knitter's Round Knitting Loom DVD.  Super easy to follow instructions.  What started out as confusing to use the loom ended up easy after following the DVD.  A must have for the beginner who has never knitted before!,1357862400,,292,4.918367346938775
2614739,5,B000GK3G96,"It showed me how to do something i did years ago and had forgotten how to do it.
It showed me how to do it in very easy to understand directions.
For anyonyone interested in looming i would suggest this DVD.",1357776000,2,207,4.073170731707317
2614740,5,B000GK3G96,"Between my CD player and auto-reverse cassette player.  I use my portable DVD player to watch, return to a particular scene or just pay very close attention to the Instructor.  My husband calls me a bag person but I enjoy the craft and I am going to master it! 6 stars!",1354147200,2,269,4.254901960784314
2614741,1,B000GK3G96,"It was not what I was expecting. I got more information on loom knitting by watching YouTube videos made by people like myself. I was also annoyed about the fact they wasted the time to add a section on regular knitting. If I wanted to know about regular knitting, I would have bought a DVD on regular knitting. It seemed clear to me that based on what they demonstrated and the lame projects they showed, they really didn't have much of a grasp of what the loom can do. Overall, I was very disappointed.",1317686400,15,504,4.372340425531915
2614742,5,B000GK3G96,The DVD on Round Loom Knitting is great!! I only wish you had a DVD on long loom knitting. Thank you so much. We appreciate your providing the DVD.,1299974400,,147,4.103448275862069

2614744,5,B000GK3G96,"This DVD was very easy to follow.  If you are a visual person in particular, you will appreciate the step-by-step directions for each process.  They even cover how to fix mistakes.  There are 4 projects covered, hats, scarves, slippers and socks.  I've already tackled the first 3 and feel pretty confident I can try the socks next.  I only knew how to cast off of regular knitting needles (long ago) before I started using the looms.  Since then, using books, I have been able to do hats and (sort of) scarves.  This DVD made things much more clear than any of the books or instructions I have.  I highly recommend this DVD. I borrowed the library's copy and liked it enough to actually buy the DVD so I think that says it all.",1237334400,10,728,4.421052631578948
2614745,2,B000GK3G96,"I learned how to knit on the loom from excellent videos from everyday people on youtube.com.  I got this dvd to learn NEW things. From other reviews it sounded like a  goldmine of information, it wasn't. This video will NOT teach you the knit stitch or the purl stitch. It will NOT show you how to increase or decrease. Her idea of a ""decrease"" is not knitting the end pegs. The ONLY stitch used is the knit-over. That gives you stockinette stitch. That is all she knits on this video.  Video shows how to knit a basic hat, scarf, a slipper and a sock. If you really want to knit a loom sock or slipper then buy it. You can find everything but those 2 on youtube.com",1234483200,22,666,4.228346456692913

Worst part was that I saw the same information on one of the American Knitter's You Tube videos. So, search the web and you can see everything on this video for free!
