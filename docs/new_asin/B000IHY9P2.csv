8145432,4,B000IHY9P2,"A classic performance by the best band in the world at their peak. The camera work is just fine--not particularly slick (but then this is NRBQ--slickness is not on the menu). The one unfortunate thing is that the lower half of the frequency spectrum is missing in the mix. That means that the full impact of the world's strongest rhythm section is just not there, which is really a shame. When I heard the band in person (many, many times), the power of of Joey and Tommy was like a freight train. On the other hand, the vocals and solos are very clear, which I find is often not the case in other live recordings. And in the end, none of these considerations really matter, because this is a document of NRBQ, and that alone makes it priceless.",1514505600,,745,4.405797101449275

8145434,4,B000IHY9P2,"I bought this so I would have some footage of the 'Q with the Whole Wheat Horns and was totally surprised to find that one of the bonus features was NRBQ's appearance on the Uncle Floyd Show from 1981 (singing ""Me and the Boys""). This performance was my first introduction to NRBQ, and I've been trying to find it for years! Not great video quality for this clip, but I'm thrilled to have it.",1307923200,,392,4.3108108108108105
8145435,1,B000IHY9P2,"I, too, have enjoyed NRBQ's live shows.  I remember seeing them open for Bonnie Raitt on the Common in Boston when she included ""Me And The Boys"" on her Green Light album.  It was even better seeing them on stage at the Paradise on Comm Ave when they were so close you could pass them a beer!

So it pains me terribly to say that the crappy video gear and lousy sound recorders employed in the production of this DVD made it impossible for me to even get through the whole thing.

If anybody wants a copy cheap, I have a deal for you......",1218412800,,539,4.153846153846154
8145436,4,B000IHY9P2,"Rock & Roll icons NRBQ (New Rhythm & Blues Quartet) is in very fine fettle on this 1982 concert video, which was taped in Terry & Don Adams hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. This offering provides a unique opportunity to experience visually and musically NRBQ & the Whole Wheat Horns- at near its all time musical height and hay-daze.
For those not familiar with NRBQ, they were founded in the late sixties and their music styles cover a multitude of musical genres; rock, jazz, country, rockabilly and blues are all part of their makeup, and then some, as there's even a cool Latin beat with their infectious ""Mambo Jambo,"" included on this very hip DVD. No matter- any genre they decide to perform, NRBQ spices their music with the up-most fun, with an up-tempo beat that makes their audience smile, as well as themselves, these guys are definitely characters, but their entire concept is thoroughly competent, even though at times it looks like they are having so much fun that the music can't be as good as it is. For example; observing Terry Adams hammer away on the keyboards is like watching a kooky cartoon character but listen closely, as Adams seamlessly culls from the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis to Thelonious Monk without blinking an eye. The entire band really meld's, if you are not moved by their music- check your pulse! Joey Spampinato has always been one of my favorite bass players, Joey possesses a big fat round sound and can swing with the best of them. Tommy Ardolino is the perfect drummer for the 'Q' and pounds away mightily. Al Anderson's guitar is all about high-energy, and his vocals and songwriting are sorely missed in the current edition of NRBQ, as are the Whole Wheat Horns who have not toured with NRBQ for quite some time, so it's great to see them al together here on this very fun DVD.

NRBQ is at full-throttle almost throughout (and they are on very high power- in more ways than one) .Highlights include the supercharged ""12-Bar Blues,"" and ""Green Lights."" Check out the instrumental of ""New Lang Syne,"" too. Other classic NBRQ chestnut tracks performed to near perfection include the Spaminato penned/Beatles'ish ""I Love Her, She Loves Me,"" and Adams' ""That's Neat, That's Nice."" The encore is a classic NRBQ hoot, as they round out their set with the appropriate yet comical ""Hit the Hay."" The bonus material is just okay, and strictly for 'Q' fans only, but their take on Terry's ""Me & The Boys"" (covered by old NRBQ friend Bonnie Raitt with NRBQ backing Bonnie on her '82 ""Green Light"" recording, which also featured Terry Aams ""Green Lights,"" performed here,) is interesting as it was taken from a 1981 TV appearance.

I have seen NRBQ at least one hundred times over the last thirty plus years, and my favorite incarnation of the band is the one captured here on this DVD, so watching this disk brought back a lot of fond & fun memories for me. NRBQ is an American treasure, buy this DVD, and sit back and enjoy their zaniness, but also zone in on their out their songwriting, vocals, and their musical abilities, and dig their groove.",1170288000,3,3081,4.703703703703703

  What a surprise to have this released on dvd! Unfortunately it is only about half the show. The FM broadcast tape of this show is one of the all time Q classics-featuring many great songs ,
 Some of the songs that were left off this release- It Was an Accident, My Girl, Derby Town, Right String -Wrong Yo Yo, Ridin in My Car and the Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.
I wish it was the COMPLETE show- but I am thrilled that at least some of the show was put out on DVD.
The sound is excellent and the video is excellent as well, really great!.
This a must have for any Q fan and for anyone not familiar with the band -a good dvd to check them out. These guys were the absolute best live band- just a total blast. All of them top notch musicians and they really put on a fantastic show- I would give this a 5 star if it was complete- the quality is 5 star!
Highly recommended!",1165276800,7,1345,4.181467181467181
