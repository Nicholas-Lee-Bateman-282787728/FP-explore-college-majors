5395928,1,B00A7WHLVC,"Wow, the GUTS some people have.

From the moment I unpackaged this DVD I noticed this wasn't your standard release. There are no summaries, pictures, or credits from the films as are usually on the backs of DVD cases. The back of the case is simply black with some print on top basically telling you there's a DVD inside.

When you open the case, you quickly notice that this DVD was made in someone's living room somewhere and is being passed off as a legitimate release. The DVD is honest-to-God a DVD-R with a sticker on it. I popped it in anyway and it doesn't even have a menu. The DVD PLAYER just prompts you ""Title 1"" or ""Title 2"".

If all this wasn't enough, at the beginning of 'Requiem for a Heavyweight', a note comes up saying ""sorry for the quality, don't let it ruin your enjoyment of the film"". Yeah, what kind of quality should we expect when the merchant has pulled these films off of Youtube and then started selling a bunch of burned copies???

Save your money. This is definitely not worth $15. If it cost $3, then it would be fair. This is an insult to you.",1371686400,8,1078,4.321782178217822
5395929,5,B00A7WHLVC,Requiem for a Heavyweight has to be one of the best television dramas ever conceived and aired.  Same with Patterns,1366156800,3,115,4.75
5395930,5,B00A7WHLVC,this version of requiem for a heavy weight is much better than the anthony quinn version which hurts me to say it as I love anthony quinn. Jack palance is one of the only famous actors that used to be a heavy weight pro boxer in real life. his acting is perfect. it is a great story. the other version is over dramatized and over acted. the ending is also different and better.,1365206400,3,377,4.178082191780822
5395931,5,B00A7WHLVC,"I've seen the movie version of Requiem many years ago and found it quite good. Rod Serling often wrote about man under pressure with regard to his work. I did not know there was an early TV version of this story until I found out about this one starring Jack Palance, Keenan and Ed Wynn, and Kim Hunter. What a cast. It's nicely done for early tv, and the ending is different than the movie. Patterns is a theatrical film, also written by Mr. Serling and once again about work pressures, this time in a big business in the city. The performances here are also quite good, featuring Ed Begley. It reminds me of the Twilight Zone episode _A Stoop At Willoughby.",1362182400,4,659,4.409836065573771
5395932,3,B00A7WHLVC,"I have been waiting for years for this to appear on a dvd.
I had the original version recorded on a vhs which was recorded from tv
and the audio portion was terrible. However on my copy there are some
really great interviews with Keenan Wynn, Mrs. Serling, and others. Also
included on my copy was a fantastic intro by Jack Klugman. I am realy
disappointed these were not on your dvd.

8548013,5,B00A7WHLVC,"""Requiem"" copy is a bit fuzzy but it doesn't detract from the power of the story. ""Patterns"" copy is very good and the story line is even better and Rod Serling at his best. Highly recommended.",1496275200,,193,4.388888888888889

8548017,2,B00A7WHLVC,"I gave this movie only two stars because the picture quality was horrible. I'm not a stickler for as perfect a picture as others seem to be, like insisting on BluRay when DVDs are available and cheaper; the DVDs are good enough for me. Also, this disc launched into the movie immediately without pushing Play or giving a choice of scenes or anything else. Most irritating was that both movies were on the same side! But to get to the second movie, we had to fast forward past the first because we didn't want to watch two movies in one night. I've never run into anything like that before.

If I had it to do over, I wouldn't buy it, but I gave it two stars because of how well Jack Palance handled his portrayal of the washed-up heavyweight. I'd never seen him in that type of part before and it was very interesting to see how totally different he made his character, no duplication of mannerisms, etc., from one role to another. Too many actors have a very narrow range of parts they can handle without duplication of the qualities a particular character should have, and I find myself thinking ""he's/she's done this character before."" But Palance made the heavyweight's character unique. He really brought alive what boxing meant to this man and how it had dominated his life. Good work, Jack! I haven't watched enough of ""Patterns"" yet to have an opinion of the movie itself, but of course the film quality was bad, bad, bad.",1418515200,,1430,4.542635658914729
8548018,4,B00A7WHLVC,"The show itself is television drama at its best. Both show have characters that are great, with acting that is amazing, and stories that are sad and sweet and ring true due to one of the greatest writers in the 20th century, Rod Serling. The DVD packaging and the DVD itself are fine, it plays as it should, all nicely done for not coming from a major studio, as it seems these shows are just not available anywhere else. As stated the quality of the actual picture is so-so, but that is absolutely understandable when you consider the age of these programs and the way these types of programs were treated back then. Despite the quality of the picture, both were very watchable and within minutes each show drags you into the story. Watching them was like stepping back in time, to when TV was live, tuning in with a little 13-inch b&w TV with a square screen.",1388966400,4,861,4.455696202531645
8548019,5,B00A7WHLVC,One of the greatest American plays ever. It is even more relavant today than when it was first shown. It simply doesn't get any better than this.,1388620800,2,145,4.407407407407407
8548020,4,B00A7WHLVC,"Jack Palance portrays a washed-up fighter trying to find his inner soul and love in life.  This 1956 presentation scripted by Rod Serling remains a standard in television and future movie productions depicting a tale of an unfortunate down-on-his-luck, respectable prize fighter to survive with honor.  swu2013",1375315200,4,310,5.574468085106383
