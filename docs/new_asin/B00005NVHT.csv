1637737,4,B00005NVHT,"This is another awesome DVD of the Farscape series. The first episode has Crichton and Aeryn trapped in outer space. The crew must mind a way to rescue them. But will they make it in time? This episode also expands Crichton's and Aeryn's relationship.
The second episode has Crichton stuck on alien planet after Moya accidently leaves . Crichton lands on planet and lives with the people there for 3 months. The crew of Moya find their lost friend. But the planet also has a secret . Rygel is also worshipped as a god. But can the crew save their lost friends on a paradise like planet?Also Crichton is bearded and shirtless for the female fans! It's only for about  10 minutes though !
The only problem with this DVD is there is no captions! There was captions on a few of the earlier DVD's. But not this DVD!",1004400000,4,810,4.436241610738255
1637738,4,B00005NVHT,"I really enjoyed these two episodes. I liked ''The Flax'' so much better on this dvd then I did when it was on tv. The story had more focus of Aeryn and John in this I thought. Plus, we meet Staantz who is actually a female of his species and is being hunted by his kind. Rygel is fun in this one he plays a game that they point of it is you have to bluff it is great! plus John and Aeryn reach a new point in their relationship.''Jeremiah Crichton'' I thought was a okay episode it isn't one of the best of Farscape that is for sure. After viewing the second time I thought that this story wa sprety mediocre. John bascially gets frustrated with the crew and flys off in his module when Moya is dealing with her pregancy and starbursts away and John thinks his crewmates have abandoned him,but they look for him the next 3 months. Then find him on a island where their is no energy so anyome who comes to this planet is stuck. D'Argo and Rygel go down to retrieve him too. John doesn't want to go back but other circumstances ensue and then John does return. It is funny when the islanders start to worship Rygel. Overall I thought that episode needed some work. But if you are a Big Farscape fan(like me) you should definetly purchase this and add it to your collection.",1004140800,4,1272,4.238683127572016
1637739,5,B00005NVHT,"I've followed the show since the beginning and its been great. I am a huge Sci Fi fan. I have collected all of the Darscapes on DVD so far...I would never buy on VHS. Having a 5.1 Digital Surround System these discs take full usage of that format being in 5.1. Wether there are a lot of extras on the disc or not (always a plus) its the difference between night and day watching it in plain old surround on the SciFi channel. Keep them coming, and I'll keep buying.",1002672000,,465,4.177777777777778
1637740,3,B00005NVHT,"I recorded both of these episodes off of the sci fi channel. Why Would I want to buy this DVD without some good extras. A commentary track or even production note subtitles would be reason enough. It's not that hard to make me happy. But this DVD cannot stand it's own when the epsiodes are already available in so many other formats.
Otherwise.. The Flax is a decent episode and Jermiah Crition is a medicore one. I love Farscape but the first season had a lot of episodes where they hadn't really developed the characters or the idea of having an intracate plot that also had a lot of fun dialog and slapstick at the same time.",1001894400,6,629,4.384615384615385
1637741,5,B00005NVHT,"I have already pre ordered this DVD, and I cannot wait for it to arrive! I have the rest of the previous collection, and one cannot be more satisfied. The Sound and Audio on these DVD's is phenomenal. I have always been a Sci-Fi fan, with Startrek Voyager, and Next Generation, but Sci-Fi has really outdone themselves with this Awesome Series. I was hooked in the first 5 minutes. It's hilarious and romantic. So if this is your first DVD, do not hesitate, Buy it NOW! And if you like Sci-Fi and have never witnessed this Series, Trust ME, You will Love IT!!!",1001030400,4,560,4.446601941747573
1637742,5,B00005NVHT,"It's wonderful that this excellent television series is being released to video and DVD. After all, it should be viewed in order, and those who miss the episodes on TV can catch up this way. As with all the Farscape, these two episodes continue to show the growth and change among the various characters. My only objection is that the U.S. is releasing the DVDs more slowly than the British, who have almost concluded Season Two in their DVD offerings. Patience is *not* one of my virtues! Also, when it comes to the ""extras"" packaged with the DVDs, I know fans of television shows would love to see previews, ad spots, missing scenes, and...perhaps most importantly...BLOOPERS! Thus far, most of the DVD available today lack these elements, although the Farscape disks are packed with other goodies to keep the fans entertained long after the initial episodes conclude.",999820800,15,870,4.925170068027211

7947892,5,B00005NVHT,I have all the Dvd's. Farscape was an excellent show that I missed first time around. Now I get to enjoy it whenever I want.,1386720000,,124,4.0
7947893,5,B00005NVHT,"The two episodes in this disc are two of the best of the first season.  The FLAX is an episode that focuses on a huge invisible net that captures unwary ships for pirates.  This is an interesting idea but the story does not rely on it alone.  There is humor, a touching moment where Rygel shows how he truly is a good guy, and an almost sex scene between John and Aeryn.
Jeremiah Crichton is about an Earth-like planet, a paradise planet really, that also turns out to be a jail.  Kind of.  I don't wish to give anything away but there are touching moments, funny moments and, once again, the character development that happens in each and every episode of Farscape is also here.",1204156800,,679,4.4
7947894,4,B00005NVHT,"""The Flax"" is memorable for presenting the first real intimations of the Crichton/Aeryn (Ben Browder/Claudia Black) romance that will later prove to be such an anchor for the series.  The bickering couple is stranded in an energy-dampening space trap and must make some hard choices as they face the very real possibility of impending death.  Meanwhile, D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe) must also make some hard choices, as he agonizes over which is the greater priority: rescuing his erstwhile crewmates or searching a Luxon derelict for information about his missing son.

Crew cohesion appears to be increasing in ""Jeremiah Crichton,"" in which John is stranded on a primative planet.  The other inhabitants of Moya temporarily abandon their individual agendas to search for him.  The resulting situation, in which Rygel is hailed as a god, may be clich&eacute;, but it has the virtue of being very well written and often funny.",1109203200,,921,5.195945945945946
7947895,4,B00005NVHT,"It was well into the first season before the Farscape we've come to know and love arrived.  ""The Flax"" is one of the first episodes to capture that spirit.
""The Flax"" is three subplots that meld into one fine show.  Onboard Moya, Zhaan & Rygel must delay the guardians of the 'flax' (a kind of space web that traps ships for plunder).  These pirates must be delayed because John & Aeryn are trapped in the flax and are running out of air.  D'Argo, with the assistance of a rogue collector, sets out to free John 'n Aeryn.  But he gets diverted to a gigantic salvage yard to search for clues about his son's wherabouts.
Admittedly, there is a certain ""soapy"" quality to each plot, but the acting and nice storyline twists keep this way above the ""All My Children"" level.  'Shippers (a term for those who follow John 'n Aeryn's budding relationship) will note that this is the first episode where they reveal their feelings for each other (the earlier episode PK Tech Girl only scratched the surface). Not to mention the top notch special effects work, particulary the junk yard with the Luxon ship.
A real highlight is the fantastic music by Subvision.  Take particular note of the scene when D'Argo says, ""...but can I look him (my son) in the eye.""  The background music is simply wonderful.
""Jerimiah Chricton"" starts off with a great tease of John being abandoned by Moya after an accidental starburst.  He's stranded on a paradise-ish planet where a dampning field prevents power sources from working. The Moya crew manages to find John and keep him from the clutches of the natives.
This episode features some really good special effects (take note of the first scene after the credits where John is sunbathing on his ship) and some humerous moments with Rygel.  But all in all, it's not that interesting since the ""natives"" look like refugees from ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" and lack the ability to act.  Plus the plot is boringly predictable, despite a end of show twist involving Rygel.
All in all, a worthy edition to your Farscape collection.",1087430400,,2050,4.730337078651686
7947896,5,B00005NVHT,Two A-plus episodes that showcase all of Farscape's strengths.,1055030400,,62,6.0
7947897,4,B00005NVHT,"I do not know if it by design but the two episodes of ""Farscape"" on Volume 7 of Season 1 have a thematic unity in that they find Moya's crew actually starting to act like their are actually crewmates.  In Episode 13, ""The Flax,"" Crichton (Ben Browder) and Aeryn's (Claudia Black) Transport Pod becomes immobilized in the Flax, an invisible drift net used by scavenging Zenetan pirates.  One of them shows up on Moya and offers D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe) the opportunity to visit a Luxan ship also stuck in the Flax.  Meanwhile, Crichton and Aeryn are running out of atmosphere had have to make some hard choices that will obviously remind you of ""The Abyss.""  Any episode that has Crichton teaching Aeryn CPR is my sort of episode.
In Episode 14, ""Jeremiah Crichton,"" the earthman gets in a snit and goes out in his ship to get away from it all.  Unfortunately the pregnant Moya reacts to this by doing a spontaneous star burst.  A quarter cycle later we find a bearded Crichton trying to survive on the planet Acquara where he is fast becoming the odd man out in a love triangle.  He cannot get off the planet because something is draining all the power.  Meanwhile the Farscape gang has been searching every planet in the area looking for Crichton, mainly because of the insistence of D'Argo and Aeryn.  When D'Argo and Rygel investigate Acquara they also fall victim of the power drain.  Then things get interesting when the locals decide that Rygel is their promised savior who will deliver them unto the light.
Now, I am not really sure why D'Argo suddenly considers Crichton to be a true crewmate and am also clueless as to why Rygel does the right thing two episodes in a row as well, but it is about time.  Not that this will stop anybody from going after each other in the future.  Right now my big question is what is going to happen on ""Farscape"" first: Aeryn and Zhaan (Virginia Hey) coming to blows, Aeryn and Crichton jumping each other, or Moya having her baby.  I just started watching the series on DVD so this is all news to me and while I have yet to see any really great episodes, I think the first season of ""Farscape"" is stronger than that of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation,"" and we all know how good that one got down the road.",1046217600,,2248,4.493857493857494
7947898,4,B00005NVHT,"Like the two previous DVDs in the FARSCAPE series, this weventh DVD shows how willing the FARSCAPE team is to experiment with the series and the two episodes on this DVD are worthy of note simply because one is so negatively overrated at times and one is so under appreciated.
This seventh DVD begins with ""The Flax,"" an episode of FARSCAPE that finds Crichton learning how to fly a transport pod from Aeryn, while the others wait for them to return on board Moya.  When the transport pod encounters an invisible mesh in space, designed to trap ships on behalf of the Zenetan pirates, called the Flax, Aeryn and Crichton are forced to struggle for their survival.  Meanwhile on Moya, the remaining crew encounter Staanz, a former pirate who can help the characters recover Aeryn and John, if D'Argo can overcome a selfish streak.  The episode is one of the better ones of the first season that has some interesting characterisation, shows several of the characters in a different light, and gives us the first kiss between Aeryn and Crichton (abeit under duress).  The bonus footage on this one makes it an even more enjoyable episode, but I think it would have been terrific to see a commentary version of this episode with Ben and Claudia.  Pity really that that wasn't an option.
The second episode on this DVD, ""Jeremiah Crichton"", is one of the more underrated of the first season episodes.  When Crichton leaves Moya in a huff in Farscape 1 and the pregnant Leviathan is forced to Starburst, Crichton finds himself all alone.  Some three months later, Moya's crew comes looking for him and finds him living on an idyllic planet called Acquara.  But there is more going on here than first appears, as an energy field dampens the use of all technology, and when Rygel and D'Argo descend to the planet they find a Crichton who doesn't necessarily want to return to Moya.  Meanwhile, Rygel's presence on the planet lifts the spirits of the Acquarans, since he is prophesised as the one who will ""lead us into the light.""  The episode is a terrific piece of underrated work based on the movie JEREMIAH JOHNSON with the FARSCAPE twists and turns that we've all come to know and love.  Some of the dialogue here is scintillating, although not as good as the one-liners from ""The Flax,"" but the episode also features some very nice outdoor camera work and a good job of acting by Ben Browder and the rest - even if Aeryn and Zhaan literally sit on the ship with nothing to do.  The extra footage here is very nice and offers all manner of little bits that complete the episode seen on tv with commercials.  Again there is no commentary version to this one, and so the story must stand on its own.
  The seventh DVD based on the first season of FARSCAPE highlights two episodes that, to me, are an indication of some of the unique aspects of characterisation that are found in the series, as well as the FARSCAPE production team's willingness to try new things.  With little in the way of features and extra material on the DVD, the steep price of this one (as is typical for the series on the part of ADV Films) makes it a good DVD to own for the compleatist FARSCAPE fan.  I've given it four stars because the quality of the DVD is very high, the extra footage makes the piece all worthwhile, and the material in the Profile adds some perspective on the series overall - but these DVDs need some extras, some *oomph!* to them, to make them worth the price we're paying for these [people].",1015891200,5,3487,4.580385852090032
7947899,5,B00005NVHT,I see alot of people dogged on Jeremiah Crichton.  I liked the episode alot.  Sometimes its nice for a change of setting.  I call episodes like Jeremiah Crichton Treking (Star Trek) episodes.  Yes females will enjoy it but the plot itself was not as horible as others lead you to believe.  Also even if the dvd isn't packed with 20 hours of extras the Digital sound and Picture is better then any VCR recording.  For the price you can't beat also there is about 5 minutes of footage not shown on Sci-Fi for each episode.  I give it five stars like i do all the Farscape DVD's.  The flax is a great episode also very funny.,1009929600,,622,4.301724137931035
