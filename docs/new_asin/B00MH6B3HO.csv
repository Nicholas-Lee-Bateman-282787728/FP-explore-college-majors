8672275,5,B00MH6B3HO,Great documentary about the industry and all the smoke and mirrors amongst celebrities.,1449100800,,87,5.769230769230769
8672276,4,B00MH6B3HO,The movie explains what happens when the checks stop coming in. Everyone has a false expectation of what it is like to become a celebrity and not understand that with more money comes more responsibility. Buying more things don't keep you rich. I wish the documentary went more into how to invest and grow your money and not just save.,1447718400,,335,4.6

8672279,3,B00MH6B3HO,"This is a documentary about rich African-Americans who go broke when the paycheck stops. The film looks at music, film, NFL, and NBA.  It goes into the details of just a few lives and glosses over the rest with headlines. It looks at some on the whys and hows and still had a hard time filling up 51 minutes.",1440201600,,308,4.220338983050848
