Irish-born Freddie Bartholomew was abandoned by his parents as a baby and raised by relatives in London, England. Working steadily in British films from the age of 6, Freddie found instant fame in America with George Cukor's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DAVID-COPPERFIELD/dp/B000GRUQK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DAVID COPPERFIELD</a>&nbsp;(1935).

In his first year in the U.S., young Bartholomew established himself as the most popular child actor after Shirley Temple.

By age 16, Fred's acting career was in serious decline. He made three mediocre military-themed programmers for COLUMBIA, got 4th billing behind Mickey Rooney in MGM's A YANK AT ETON (1942), then entered the Air Force. After the war, 20-year-old Fred starred in this very minor comedy, appeared in a few live TV dramas, got 5th billing in a Dick Haymes picture called ST. BENNY THE DIP (1951), then retired from movies to work on Madison Ave.

SYNOPSIS for THE TOWN WENT WILD (1944)--
A Hall of Records clerk discovers that two feuding next door neighbors, both fathers of newly born sons, accidentally signed the birth certificate for the other man's boy, thus they have each raised the wrong child. Young David (Bartholomew) and Bob (Jimmy Lydon) are best friends. David attempts to elope with Carol (Jill Browning), Bob's sister before the mix-up was discovered, so if not for a 3-day waiting period he would've married his own sister!

In this fast-paced minor comedy of errors, Edward Everett Horton, as one of the two dads, delivers a typically fine performance. His counterpart, Tom Tully is equally good. Bartholomew, who has nearly lost his British accent, looks frail. Lydon, best known for a series of Henry Aldrich programmers, is spirited but not amusing. In fairness though, the humor is slight here despite a meaty premise.",1280361600,7,2953,7.104395604395604
8070147,4,B0009XT8QA,"Funny throughout and with a raft of actors anyone who spent their childhood watching old black and whites on the TV will recognize  Back in the days when humor and a tight, fast paced script were the primary thing and humor was entertainment, not a statement.

Only four because the quality is not 'perfect'.  This thing probably sat in a back closet for a few decades before it was digitized  so that's inevitable but sad.",1515888000,,423,4.6

Had never seen this before and it was a delight!  I believe this was Freddie's last film and it was odd seeing him as a young adult.  Do not want to give the plot away though many reviews here have done that already but it was a daring subject for this period of time.  Recommend this film highly to any lover of period genre.",1465862400,,453,4.421686746987952
