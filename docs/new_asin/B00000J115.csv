All of the other movies I watched played well with no upload pauses.. The problem with it is I don't know if Com Cast was slowing my service or if your site had issues.  But I do know as soon as another provider comes into my area I'm switching services.. I'm not going to support any company that cannot support it users with the fastest and most reliable service. All I'm getting is the crappiest and slowest service just because they are trying to force more money out of the sites I visit.

In their greed and copy protection efforts they are worst carrier I ever used.. .",1412121600,,703,4.2706766917293235

He is only in the film in the last 15-20 minutes but he certainly makes the movie more intense.  Gary Daniels stars as a prisoner who goes to jail unjustly.  He is in a convenience store as its being robbed.  He tries to escape jail to be with his daughter even though he was given less than a year sentence.  He then is given 27 years in suspended animation.  Then Gary's character wakes up and attempts to escape again and gets  33  year in suspended animation.  The third time he escapes he makes it to Seattle  and he ends up at the same hospital his daughter is dying at.  He gets to visit with her before the police close in on him.  This movie demonstrates how precious time is.,1406073600,,785,4.294520547945205

1231238,3,B00000J115,"I bought this movie strictly because of Gary Daniels. I find him to be an exceptionally good-looking and appealing guy, so just watching him is good entertainment for me.
This is definitely an odd movie for Gary. Gary is known for his martials arts skills, and therefore is typically in a movie where those skills are showcased. Here, he plays a character that doesn't even know how to fight. This is not a martial arts movie, but rather, a sci-fi movie. Even if you forget about the fact that it's not a typical Daniels movie, and gauge it just as a sci-fi movie, it's still a bit odd. The plot, and the movie's direction, are somewhat offbeat and jarring. (For example, I'm into sci-fi, but can't recall ever seeing in another movie something like the ""dark shadow"" in Spoiler. It's just weird. And the sudden disappearance of 20 years out of the main character's life is most jarring). It is also very depressing subject matter. This is definitely not a ""feel-good"" movie and has a very, very dark look and feel all the way through. Star Wars, it ain't. Watch this movie if you're into dark sci-fi. It was too dark for me.
More than any other movie of his to date, Gary gets an opportunity to act and stretch beyond his usual, constraining role of a revenge-seeking martial arts fighter. And he does well. Clearly, he took the part to prove he could do more, and he can.
Despite the relentless pummeling he gets, Gary looks remarkable in several scenes. (How can a guy this beautiful be unappealing to the eye?). There is one scene of him pumping iron shirtless, to showcase his outstanding physique. There's no love interest at all, which is a total waste of this man's looks, but then, given the subject matter, it makes sense to exclude it.
But mostly, you'll want to watch this movie only if you like very dark sci-fi.",1052784000,6,1825,4.567073170731708

It's clear to see that  this movie was made on a budget,. but for those of us who like budget  films, this one ia true gem. British action hero Gary Daniels is at his  best, mixing comedy with some very good acting.

I think he took this role to improve on his  acting ability, but we only watch his movies for action and martial arts.  Hey Daniels get a better Agent!",955756800,3,573,4.053571428571429

If you are looking for a movie where effects take the place of a story, this is not a movie for you; but if you want a worthwhile story, watch this movie.  Several other reviews explain the plot; so I won't say more than that it is about a person falsely accused and convicted - in a very poor legal system, it seems, of a crime he wasn't involved in.  He wants to be with his daughter so he ""just"" continues escaping and escaping.  The acting is excellent as is the dialog.  There is one scene with some sexual content.  There is no bad language that I noticed.  There is a lot of unjust personal violence against the man.  There are really no significant special effects.

Cons: Zero character development. And seems nearly every actor went overboard. Over acting. They were trying too hard...unless that was intentional. An inside joke among themselves(?). The sound effects were generic. Probably a reusable licensing sample of studio or royalty-free audio effects. Not so great. Audio in a few scenes reminded me of the sound effects in the old batman series from the 60's. Generic sound effects that failed to match natural laws of physics. Those scenes brought a chuckle.
