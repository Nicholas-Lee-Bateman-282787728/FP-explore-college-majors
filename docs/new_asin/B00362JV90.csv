4072122,4,B00362JV90,"FEW KNOW, THAT WOMEN VOLUNTEERED TO LEAVE THE SAFETY OF MAINLAND U.S., AND HELP SICK, WOUNDED, AND OUTNUMBERED SOLDIERS.

THEY PROBABLY SUSPECTED,THEY WERE ABANDONED BY THE MILITARY DUE TO SHORTAGES OF RESOURCES, AND HAD NO HOPE OF ANY RESCUE.
BUT THEY ALL HELD ON UNTIL THEY WERE FINALLY CAPTURED BY JAPANESE FORCES.

THE TACTIC WAS  A COMMAND FROM GENERAL MAC ARTHUR, HE GAVE NO FALSE HOPES, BUT IN THE LARGER PICTURE, HE NEEDED THESE SOULS TO REMAIN TO THE END. TO BUY TIME TO BUILD UP MILITARY POWER. THEY WERE TO BE SACRIFICED TO BUY MORE TIME.

WRITTEN OFF IN THE LEDGER COLUMN UNDER DISPENSABLE.  THIS REMAINS A MILITARY TACTIC.

ACCEPTABLE NUMBERS OF DEATHS? UNTIL THE BIG BRASS AND LEADERS FIND A GOOD TIME TO PULL OUT,  OF THE BATTLES ALREADY LOST.",1357689600,3,758,4.696969696969697
4072123,5,B00362JV90,"This is a first rate movie set in 1942 that highlights the courage and sacrfice of a mixed group of regular army nurses and civilian volunteers living and working together in enduring the same privitations and horrors on the Bataan Peninsulia as the American and Flippino soldiers. It doesn't have the usual MGM production gloss and the grit in it shows. The few men that appear in the movie are limited to minor roles mostly the wounded - this is the war as told from these womens perspectives.

While the script, production values and Richard Thorpe's direction are first rate, it is the actreses that make this movie special. All the supporting actresses are perfectly cast for their roles. Fay Bainter, Ella Raines, Frances Gifford, Marsha Hunt, Connie Gilchrist, Heather Angel and {espically} Diana Lewis {as ditzy Lydia} ably portray the tensions,strains and comradeship that developes and envelopes them in a hopeless situation. The three {3} leading ladies are - Joan Blondell as a brash, warm-hearted and slightly blowsey burlesque queen trading barbs with Ann Sothern and fighting her fears to keep up her courage. Margaret Sullivan is the dog tired, overworked lieutenant Smith aka "" Smitty "" keeping her cool amid the strain, carnage and constant bad news from the front and hiding two secrets from everyone. Sullivans marvelous voice just drips exhaustion -you can understand why her commanding officer, Captain Marsh {Faye Bainter} wants to get her to Corriegdor.

But amoung a slew of oustanding performances it is Ann Sothern who steals the show as ""Pat"" a hash house waitress ""tought as nails"" who nevertheless gradually shows grit, humanity and intelligence that belies her ""sass"" and semi-false bravado. Her scenes when she is badgering and yapping at Connie {Ella Raines} and then gradually warms up to her are partcularily realistic and well done.

The number of outstanding actresses avaliable for this one movie is a testimony to the wealth of resources that MGM had on call under studio contract and that were avaliable to borrow from other studios. This 1944 production mostly downplays the war propaganda and concentrates on the women working and trying to stay strong amid death, destruction and heartbreak.

The conflict and animosity between Lt Smith and Pat and constant friction persisting between them is the major strand of plot line running thru the movie with Pat be-latedly finding out both of ""Smitty's"" secrets and  grudgingly both women finding respect for each other. This one of Margaret Sullivans last films and it is one of her best. With a superlative cast and acting, I enthusiastically give this film 5 stars and highly recommend it.",1273536000,28,2679,5.093394077448747
