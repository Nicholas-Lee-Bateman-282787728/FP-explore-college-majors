3598551,1,B001GBIORI,"OK - now I know this DVD says that it is advanced but if you aren't a student of dance, a professional choreographer, or Amy Bento herself, then you don't have a chance.  I even took the time before I started the workout to go through the ""tough"" step patterns that she uses.  After about 10 tries at that I thought to myself, ""What the heck, I will give it a try.""  I start the DVD and two steps into the warm-up (YES, I said that warm-up) she takes off doing a step pattern that I cannot for the life of me catch up to or figure out.  About 6 minutes into the warm-up I officially quit and put in another step tape (any of the Reebok ones) that I can follow and are a good workout.  In a grump, I give the DVD to my sister-in-law who steps about 7 days a week and has taken dance on-and-off for years.  The next day she calls laughing and says the exact same thing happened to her and that she has the first tape of Amy Bento's and it was the same experience with that one.  So, just a major heads-up to the next person who wants to buy this.... ask yourself, are you an INCREDIBLE student of step footwork and patterns because, if you are, this is the tape for you.  All others, shop for another DVD.",1201651200,12,1203,4.046413502109704
3598552,5,B001GBIORI,"I admit that this was initially overwhelming; I had A LOT of stops and starts during my first attempts. However, it has quickly become my favorite cardio workout! I like the fact that I was CHALLENGED mentally as well as physically, going beyond traditional step routines. (I feel like I've run for miles after completing this video.) The preview section helped some, but you simply have to watch the video carefully and move with the music. (However, this is definitely not for the novice exerciser.) Since I've been stepping for a while, I did not try Amy's original step challenge (this is my first of her videos), but I will be looking for more of her workouts.",1201564800,16,665,4.6923076923076925
3598553,2,B001GBIORI,"Just not paced well at all for a beginner.  Not friendly for anyone hoping to follow along, and everything goes way too fast to even hope to be able to keep up.  Seemed pretty generic overall too.",1323129600,,196,4.27027027027027
3598554,5,B001GBIORI,"If you are looking for a challenging step workout, this is it! I was already sweating during the warmup. Choreography is challenging and fast, and so much fun! As others have said, the prompting isn't always there for doing the steps, but that is part of the challenge. I plan on doing this over and over until I can complete it 100%. In other words, you won't be stuck doing step knees over and over. It's not boring -- don't give up!",1311638400,,435,4.317073170731708
3598555,3,B001GBIORI,"I know how to step, but have not been stepping for quite some time.  Routines were not easy to catch on to.  This is her first tape that I've purchased.",1297641600,,152,4.033333333333333
3598556,2,B001GBIORI,"I've attempted this workout numerous times over a couple of months and have yet to make it through the workouts without getting totally confused.  I've done plenty of step aerobics in the past and had no problem catching on.  Amy's steps are too complicated for the average stepper who just wants to pop in a video and get their workout done.

Here are some specific things that make this workout challenging:  Most of the steps require you to turn your back to the TV at some point, so you can't really watch what Amy is doing while you practice it.  Also, she doesn't ""build"" the routines, which is a style that allows you to get used to a step before you move onto the next one.  She just does the whole thing and you hope you'll eventually catch on.  She tries to compensate for this by using preview steps for the complicated parts.  But even the preview steps are hard to learn without replaying them over and over so you can practice them.  She goes through each one twice at a slow pace, and then does it at ""normal"" tempo, which is really pretty fast.  Again, you often have to turn your back on the TV.

Amy's workouts have the potential to be both physically and mentally challenging, making for a very stimulating workout.  That's IF you can ever learn the steps.  I haven't totally given up on it yet, but I'm close.",1294099200,,1329,4.419753086419753
3598557,5,B001GBIORI,"I've been dancing since I was 4 years old and have been performing/dancing professionally since I was 9 years old, so I have a lot of experience with choreography - following a class or having to teach a class in mirror-view.  I also LOVE step and have been taking step classes at the gym for about 12 years (I'm almost 30 now - yikes!!).  When I read the reviews for all the Amy Bento Advanced step challenge workouts (most reviewers were very discouraged with regards to the speed and the intricate steps in the DVD), I was actually encouraged to buy all 3 (at the time 4 hadn't come out) at the same time.  I was so excited when they came in and I couldn't wait to see what all the hype was about (in terms of her difficult choreography and late cueing).

I was completely floored when I popped it in and as many other reviewers posted, within the first few minutes (warm-up and first combo) I was sooooooooooo completely frustrated and felt defeated.  I was really disappointed in myself because I consider myself a very quick learner (especially with choreography memorization), and I didn't think that a workout DVD could possibly be so hard to catch on to!  So, I put the DVD(s) away...

It must have been a year later since I first bought the DVDs that I saw them lying around and decided to pop ASC2 in and just watch it (baby steps).  Watching it a second time made me stress out again!  It was just as hard as I remembered it being!

So, I decided I could either put it in the pile of ""stuff I've wasted my money on"", or put my ego aside and take the approach used in my dance classes to break down combos.  I'm so glad I decided to do the latter!  After I broke it down and it had a chance to marinate, I was amazed at how awesome the workout is and it has now become one of my favorite workouts to do (I actually get excited to do it after I get home from work)!

Basically, I watched one combo at a time to start... just watched.  Then, I played the 1st combo in slo-mo while doing the moves in 1/2 time using my step - this really helped with the moves where your back is turned towards the TV.  By doing the whole segment in 1/2 time, even though it was really time consuming, by the end of the segment I had pretty much memorized the whole combo.  The next step was to play it in real time now being able to connect her vocal cues to the steps.  After doing the actual combo a few times in real time, I was able to add the arms full-out and throw in a few of my own little stylized things.  This is pretty much how we do things in dance class (in most of my dance classes anyway) - you show part of the dance with music, then break it down without music, practice it without music, then add music and do it in real time.  Then you repeat the cycle with a new combo and add on.

I was able to learn the whole DVD in 2h and I now do it every other day (in fear that if I don't do it frequently I'll forget the choreography and have to re-learn the whole thing BUT also because it's so fun).  Once you get the hang of it, time really flies!  And it doesn't even feel like a workout (but you'll know it is because you'll be out of breath and drenched with sweat... at least I always am!).

In these DVDs, Amy definitely has a different teaching style than other aerobics instructors out there.  I think her vision was to create something that was really fun and intricate and advanced.  But I think she knew that the only way to create a step workout at this difficulty level (choreography-wise), she would have to skimp on the break-down time of the choreography.  Even in the previews of the more difficult moves, I wouldn't say she breaks it down adequately enough for someone to pick it up in one viewing.  BUT if she did break it down step by step on the DVD, it would take hours, so, I think she did the best that she could.

All in all, I love this series.  This one (#2) is particularly my favorite because I just really like the combos and the set is more pleasing to the eye than #1.  I don't use the modifier but it is nice that this DVD has that option as well as premixed workouts which I haven't tried but think is nice to have(again, unlike #1).  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great step video and a great challenge.  Like anything new or challenging, take it step by step.  You don't have to learn it all in one day, even learning one combo at a time and doing it a few times in a row will make for a great workout in itself (until you're ready to move on).  My only regret is that I didn't take this advice sooner as I waited a whole year to start enjoying this workout.",1292544000,2,4618,4.140134529147982
3598558,4,B001GBIORI,"This was definitely not an easy workout.  It was the most challenging to get out of any majorly choreographed step dvd I've ever purchased.  I knew it would be like that from reading the reviews, but having purchased ASC1 and ASC3 and loved them, I knew I would want to try this one out.  I waited until I had a day when I didn't feel like working out intensely and I could set aside another hour on top of the hour the workout actually takes to rewind, rewind, rewind.  It took me about 2 1/2 hours to go through the preview of the moves and the whole workout and burn it into muscle memory enough so that the next time I did the workout, I wouldn't be stalled and frustrated.  Those 2 1/2 hours were very frustrating--at one point after rewinding, pausing, etc. for the 10th time on one part I was ready to chuck the remote at the screen.  The preview helped a bit, but there were about 15 other moves that could've used an extensive preview as well that you have to just reverse engineer while she's calling them out, with minimal breakdown.  And yes, you will have to figure this out while looking away from the screen.  And the camera angles are not always helpful.  Sometimes I wished she had an overhead camera view so I could see where the heck they were in relation to the step.  If I hadn't had a lot of dance training, this would've been very difficult.  Cathe Friedrich does a lot less turning and using the ""front"" of the step (requiring your back to be to the screen).  You will have to pause the screen right as she starts doing something complicated so you can have some idea of which direction she turned, then try to reenact it yourself, over and over...

Some sections were easier than others, to be fair.  #2 was easier for sure, that required almost no rewinds or pauses.  Some other parts were fairly easy too.

That all said though, once I got it...this has become an awesome workout, which is why I give it 4 stars.  It's still always challenging to get, and now I'm grateful for the minimal breakdown which was initially so frustrating, it makes you work a lot harder once you've mastered the move, there's no need to do that extensive breakdown.

I just bought ASC4 which just came out, it's not on Amazon yet.  I'm hoping it's more along the lines of 1 and 3 though.",1283990400,3,2293,4.365566037735849
3598559,5,B001GBIORI,"Amy has produced another winner step workout.  The choreography is somewhat complex, so if you like your step routines simple, this may not be the workout for you.

What I loved about this workout:

**the complex step routines.  I love complex choreography so this was big plus for me.  I still don't have all the moves down, but I have fun with the routine anyway.  I love workouts that make me think. Each time I do the workout, I `get' a bit more of the routines so it keeps getting more fun.  It helped to view the preview moves before attempting this workout.

**Amy's teaching style.  She teaches part of the routine, you repeat it a few times and then she teaches the next section.  She also has you doing Routines 1 & 2 together, 3 & 4 together,etc., so you have plenty of chances to practice the moves.

**the music.  It's upbeat and fast paced.  I can't help but smile when I'm working out.

**it's deceptively hard.  I consider myself an advanced exerciser and I can't usually do the entire routine without running out of steam.  This is very rare for me but I don't get discouraged, I view this as a challenge and something to work towards.

**the premixes of varying lengths.  I also like that premixes include the power-up section.

There are a few things to note about this workout, but for me they didn't detract from my enjoyment.  The things:

**it was a little hard to hear Amy's voice over the music.  I noticed this more the first few times I did the workout since I was trying to listen to her instructions.

**it took me a while to get used to Amy's terminology.  I like how she cues the moves by telling us what moves are coming up next, but not until I understood what she called each move.

**the power up section is just kind of stuck at the end, after the cool down, but before the stretch.  If you want to include this section in your workout, it's a little awkward to have to finish Step Routine 5, stop the DVD and select the Power Up section.

**the choreography is complex and Amy doesn't spend a lot of time breaking down the moves.  I just keep alternating right and left foot and keep my heart rate up.

If you want a fun and challenging step workoutwith complex choreography, you may like this.",1283385600,2,2231,4.386308068459658
3598560,5,B001GBIORI,"Takes about 3 tries, but after this, you can flow through.  Not easy.  If you have difficulty with co-ordination, not for you.  Or maybe will take a few more tries.  You will sweat.  Love it, great DVD as usual from Amy",1276732800,,219,4.2439024390243905
3598561,1,B001GBIORI,"I've been doing advanced step at health clubs for 15 years and I am completely frustrated by this video.  The choreography is so difficult and hard to follow.  The preview section only instructs the viewer on 3-5 of the many crazy steps.  Also, there are several skips on the cd that I cannot correct.",1275004800,2,301,4.537037037037037
3598562,1,B001GBIORI,"The patterns are just way too difficult.  I have been doing step videos at home for almost 20 years and taken classes for at least 5.  The prompting is too little, too late. Without being in a studio with mirrors, the time spent with your back to the TV is just too much to be able to follow the steps.

3598563,5,B001GBIORI,"I am psyched.  I've been doing STEP for over 15 years and this is the hardest routine I've ever encountered.

3598564,5,B001GBIORI,"I love this video!!!  Being healthy is working your body AND your mind!  Yes, it is difficult to learn, but I'd rather learn step workouts than do crosswords or other puzzle to keep my mind sharp, like the experts say we should do.  I am an advanced exerciser and use Cathe, the old Firms, Christy Taylor, etc. and I think this workout is by far the funnest I've ever done.  The time flies, it doesn't feel like a workout because it's fun, yet I'm a sweaty mess when I'm through.  There are 5 chapters (routines) to learn and I found just going through one-by-one each day I wanted to try it worked great for me.  The bonus of this video is the premixes... multiple workouts are available, from around 38 minutes to almost 1 1/2 hours.  This is an excellent DVD and I wish the one star people would give it another try.",1256860800,,819,4.313725490196078
3598565,4,B001GBIORI,"A challenging DVD that will take a few runs to master.

3598567,5,B001GBIORI,"I began using this workout in January 2008; it is awesome.  Amy's choreography is unsurpassed; it is never boring or prosaic.  I'll admit I was a little overwhelmed when I first attempted it (I previewed it several times before trying), but the payoff was worth it.  I keep this one in rotation at least two to three times a month.  This is definitely an advanced workout, not for anyone who's just into the same up and down motions of traditional stepping.  This is for those of us who really like and appreciate a challenge and are ready to groove :-).  Amy is simply the best!!",1239062400,2,580,4.476190476190476
3598568,2,B001GBIORI,"I did a lot of research before making this purchase.  I wanted a really good step workout that would be advanced & not a boring workout.  I had read reviews on the poor cuing, but some of the reviews said you could catch onto some of them with a lot of practice.  Well, the workout is not as good and physically challenging as I was hoping, and the cuing & following is worse than I was expecting.  I would certainly NOT recommend this workout.",1235520000,,444,4.25
3598569,3,B001GBIORI,"This video is good- it is going to take me a little while to get the steps down, it is fast paced and a challenge. If you are looking for something to get your heart rate up and keep your mind engaged while working out this is for you.",1232841600,,235,3.816326530612245
3598570,2,B001GBIORI,"I have been doing step aerobics for 20 years,  videos for about 8 years: Cathe, Kari Anderson, Chrisi Taylor and others.  This is my first Amy Bento DVD.  There is NO cuing in this dvd and no attempt to introduce or layer the complex choreography.  She introduces the step as she is doing it.  Many of the moves are done in front of the step, facing the step, so your back is to the TV, so you can't see what she is doing... I watched this video twice before attempting the first 3 segments, and still was only able to do 50% of the routine-with constant rewinding.  I am going to try to learn the workout, and give Amy a chance, but probably will not buy any more of her DVDs.  It is simply too frustrating.",1228348800,5,708,4.161764705882353
3598571,4,B001GBIORI,"The challenge in this workout doesn't come from intensity or high impact, instead it is caused by the complex choreography that is not cued with enough detail. For example, Amy gives some of the combinations names and then calls them out during the workout. If it was cued step by step instead, it would make it so much easier and make it a 5-star workout. The tutorial helps a little but it takes a lot of repetition to get it down during the workout for this same reason. After about 4 to 5 tries I can do combo 1 - 3, 4 is still a challenge and 5 I have to skip. There are some premixes with weights from the Slo-Mo video that are really great, making this DVD very versatile. I'm not giving up to learn all of it, because it is a fun workout, but it takes determination to get there. If you're not an advanced, experienced stepper, don't try it.",1209513600,12,849,4.214723926380368
