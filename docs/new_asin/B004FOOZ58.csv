8428133,5,B004FOOZ58,"I enjoyed this Australian Twentysomething dramedy when I watched the first two seasons about 10 years ago on the Trio Channel. It is still enjoyable as I rewatch the series on this set of dvds. The picture and sound quality are excellent. The casting, writing, performances, music and production qualities are top notch. I'm disappointed that I haven't seen the actors show up in other shows here in the States. Nothing against Pippa Black, but it would have been great to see Jessica Gower in Outsourced. I'd be pleased to see any of the main characters in practicaly anything else. The episodes focus on love primarily through a sexual lens which rotates kaleidoscopically from the romantic to the cynical and back again. Main cast members started to leave as early as the second season and the show was cancelled in its fourth season. Even if only the first two or three seasons are satisfying, the extras included with the box set make it well worth it to me. Thought-provoking, funny, sad and poignant, this is a great show to watch either alone or with someone else. I've missed it.",1297468800,7,1088,4.761904761904762
