Don't waste your money or your time viewing this one.  I only got it because the box stated that the same director of The Mystery of Chess Boxing (an excellent flick) was also the same director for this one.  That will instantly fool you.  Boy, the tactics used to sell wack garbage!

The main plot of this flick is that an evil tyrant bullies his way into getting the poor people in a nearby village to sell their land so he can later build prime real estate.  Whoever refuses to sell their property was seriously beaten up by his right-hand henchmen.  The ""Hero"" ends up in this same village after he is found unconscious - due to a beating from some hired thugs.  The family who nursed him back to health is later attacked and threatened into turning over their land to this evil tyrant.  They try to take up stand and fight to keep their land just to only have their son kidnapped by this mob.

The action in this totally boring flick was at best - turtle-speed and the fighting scenes sucked tremendously.  This flick will surely collect dust on my shelf!  If you have a hard time sleeping, instead of a sleeping pill watch this DVD.  You'll be out in a flash - guaranteed!!!!",1149897600,,1310,4.381742738589212
