7037324,3,B00UGPKYMS,"i have to agree with the other folks that while compared to a lot of the shows currently on Eureka is okay but like other shows i did enjoy (i.e. Chuck, Heroes) seems to be running out of gas. i know nothing lasts forever but hope the shows can go out on a high note rather than get so bad that they aren't even worth watching. i still think there could be a lot of good story lines featuring some of the other characters without the goofy sic fi mishap that happens like clockwork. we shall see. here's hoping.",1271116800,4,511,4.171717171717172
7037325,3,B00UGPKYMS,"The three stars is for the this ridiculous half season releases. Battlestar galactic started with this and now others are picking up on it. Half the season at the price of a full season, effectively doubling the cost of a season.

Other than the greed of the company...

Eureka is one of the best shows currently out on TV. If you haven't seen it, pick up Season one and start there. Its intelligent, funny and well made. (Now saying that it'll be dumbed down to a  sitcom level, made boring and the production will spiral down. Too many shows have started out fantastic then been canceled because they were high quality and not low brow stupidity.) Ok, done venting.

Eureka is well worth seeing. The show is great and the storylines are interesting.",1269648000,7,751,4.62406015037594
7037326,3,B00UGPKYMS,"It's a little awkward that ""Eureka Season 3"" was split into two independent mini-seasons instead of one -- and somehow ""Eureka Season 3.5"" doesn't quite reach the heights of the previous 2.5 seasons of sci-fi wackery. While the individual plots are nice little nuggets of sci-fi, the season is hampered by the lack of a season-loving overarcing storyline.

There's a new sheriff in town: Sheriff Andy, a creepily cheerful android who has arrived to replace Carter. But job-hunting and Alison's pregnancy are not Carter's biggest concerns -- instead, he has to deal with strange gravity fluctuations that are plaguing Eureka. Even weirder, they seem to be targeting Andy. Coincidence? Not in Eureka.

But even if Carter manages to regain his old position, he'll still have a bunch of problems to deal with: Jo acting like two different people, a poltergeist, a trip into the 5th dimension, a giant green blob, people drowning on dry land, a wave of amnesia (cue clip show!), and an arctic core that seems to be freezing GD.  But a signal from space causes the residents of Eureka to start building strange structures while they sleep -- and heralds a mysterious vessel's arrival, carrying a precious cargo that no one expected...

The biggest problem with ""Eureka Season 3.5"" is that it has no season-long arc -- both of the previous seasons (and the first half of this one) had an over-arcing plot that lasted the entire season. The writers have a mini-arc with the whole ""space object landing"" and its aftermath, but it's kinda anticlimactic and ends up lasting only a couple episodes. It's just not as gripping or suspenseful as the Artifact or the Mystery Bunker, and it feels like something is missing.

Fortunately, the episodes themselves are still solid standalone material -- lots of weird wacky science, a budding romantic triangle, and lots of funny quirky dialogue (""This is blasphemy, okay? Madness!"" ""This is EUREKA!""). What's more, it has some new developments that might make the fourth season pretty interesting -- including the reopening of Section 5, and all the dangerous stuff inside it.

When he's not being the ""average guy,"" Carter is grappling with some age-old problems -- Zoe is about to graduate, and he's the male leg of a love triangle between a Alison and Tess Fontana. Erica Cerra gets to have some fun as Jo and a doppelganger, and Salli Richardson-Whitfield does a good job with Alison's confused romantic feelings (and pregnancy woes). Best of all: Matt Frewer finally returns as the mildly insane Taggart (""Everything I'm wearing I killed meself, including my walrus skivvies!"").

But the most powerful performance this season is from Joe Morton, whose tragic romantic past comes back to haunt him. After seeing Henry grieve for so long, it's nice to see him experience some closure.

""Eureka Season 3.5"" is a weaker expanse of light sci-fi than the previous 2.5 seasons (HAVE I MENTIONED there's no full arc?), but it's still an enjoyable ride with amazingly weird mysteries.",1267747200,80,3011,4.9960079840319365

7037350,5,B00UGPKYMS,"Eureka - a generally positive, lighthearted look at life in a town populated by genius level intellects generally contrasted by their sheriff, a common (and much more practical) man. Occasional elements of the dark side appear along with some healthy egos, speckled with a few competing viewpoints, and discoveries of galactic proportions makes for a great long story arc (5 seasons over 7 years having been interrupted by the writers strike) complicated by some little time travel twist as well as good episodes concentrating on a few activities and relationships.

7037374,4,B00UGPKYMS,"I loved the show and was glad to get the last boxed set so that I have all 5 seasons. But it's obvious that SyFy decided to work on the cheap and split seasons to make more money. They did it with both seasons 3 and 4 [writers didn't strike in 4] but what really gives it away is that Seasons 3, 3.5 and 4.0 they don't even bother to list the episode titles anywhere on the disks or boxes. ""No we're not charging you more for less"" yeah right!  You can't tell how many episodes come in each pack unless you load the disks and look at the menus. They finally went back to at least listing the episode titles on the 'inner' package with season 4.5 and put season 5 all in one package.

7037385,1,B00UGPKYMS,"My stepmother loves this series.  I recently got her this DVD set along with the rest of the seasons she was missing for her birthday.  So, she started to watch the whole series over again from the very first episode.  Having just opened this package, she was watching episode 3 when at minute marker 41:09 of 43:56, it froze.  Checked the disk and there were no smudges or scratches on the disk.  Played the DVD in a different machine and it froze again at the exact same point.  Sadly, this appears to be a poor copy transfer to the disk.  I would have liked to return this but for once in my life, I actually order this well ahead of her birthday.  By the time we opened it to watch it, it was already past the 30 day Amazon return policy.  This is too bad.

7037427,5,B00UGPKYMS,I loved the first and second season of Eureka and season three is just as good.  Great story lines with good humor and fun along with great characters make for a totally addictive series.,1299369600,,187,4.5
7037428,4,B00UGPKYMS,"I love EUREKA, let me tell you. It's a show that consistently does the unexpected. Where else but in Eureka can the mayor also be the town's local car mechanic? Henry Deacon goes around town in his garage uniform, all unassuming, except that he's got ""Mayor"" labeled on his front shirt pocket. It's perfectly Eureka. You have to look at things more closely.

EUREKA - SEASON 3.5 collects the rest of the third season, to wit, episodes #9-18. As we catch up with that top secret community of the world's greatest minds ensconced somewhere in the Pacific Northwest (I think, Oregon), we find Jack Carter still reeling from his getting axed as Sheriff of Eureka and now applying for a job with Homeland Security. There's also the humiliation of having been replaced by the (literally) robotic Sheriff Andy. But that first episode back from hiatus (""Welcome Back, Carter"") sets things right for Jack, and he's soon back to wielding that sheriff's star. Back to status quo as we knew it, given that it's a pretty shaky status quo when you're the peace officer muddling thru the sometimes extinction-level fallout of a townful of geniuses gleefully unraveling the universe's biggest mysteries. It helps that Jack has the street smarts to handle cutting edge science on the fritz. For the audience, it also helps that Jack is around when the big brains are talking because they usually end up having to break down their high brow talk into layman's dialogue.

Actress Salli Richardson's real-life pregnancy couldn't help but impact the show, causing certain story arcs to be tweaked. According to an episode commentary, the writers had originally planned to bring Jack and Allison closer but then that got scuttled. Instead, Richardson's pregnancy is written in and Allison is now expecting, with Jack tapped as her birthing coach. In comes new recurring character Dr. Tess Fontana, a SETI scientist come to help Global Dynamics on a mysterious project (hint: it's got to do with that worrisome signal from outer space). Tess keeps getting under Jack's skin... which, to me, immediately translated to her being Jack's potential love interest.

A kind of a bummer is that the ""threat from outer space"" thread gets resolved too soon and isn't as nearly menacing as projected. It is, however, Henry Deacon heavy. The rest of Season 3 is a series of stand-alone stories, and while the awesome offbeat vibe never goes away, they feel somewhat anticlimactic. Still, there's a grip of entertaining episodes in this collection. Season 3's second half has our characters dabbling with gravity wells and smart asphalts and black energy, UFOs and doppelgangers. Jack, our invaluable point-of-view character, even gets trapped in the 5th dimension. ""Welcome Back, Carter"" introduces the endearing Sheriff Andy. In ""Your Face Or Mine"" Carter takes the 48-hour-long, bi-annual Sheriff's recertification exam, leaving Jo in charge as acting Sheriff and putting the spotlight on Erica Cerra. ""It's Not Easy Being Green"" is worth watching for the increasingly alarming annual bowling tournament between Eureka and its rival Area 51. If you're new to the show and looking for a jumping on point, ""You Don't Know Jack"" is the flashback episode (and also an amnesia episode) that still boasts a fully fleshed-out plot. ""You Don't Know Jack"" was written in part to balance the f/x budget which went off the rails with the Season 3 opener ""Bad to the Drone.""

Unforeseen circumstances are mostly to blame for EUREKA - SEASON 3.5's weaker moments, so I tend to give this a pass. Of shows in this genre, EUREKA still is the best going around. It's hard to beat its blend of science gone amok, cop procedural, and comedy of manners, and when EUREKA goes for those darker narratives, then it's a show soaring at its highest. Keep on watching it.

Here be the bonus features: Deleted Scenes for 9 episodes; Audio Commentaries for 2 episodes (""Your Face Or Mine?"" with actor Colin Ferguson & executive producer Jaime Paglia and ""What Goes Around, Comes Around"" with Jaime Paglia & episode director Matt Hastings); Podcast Commentaries for 4 episodes (""Welcome Back, Carter"" with producer Jaime Paglia & writer Bruce Miller, ""If You Build It..."" with actor Jordan Hinson & writer Bruce Miller, ""Ship Happens"" with actor Colin Ferguson & Jaime Paglia, and ""You Don't Know Jack"" with Jaime Paglia & writer Eric Wallace); and ""Finishing Touch: The Visual Effects in EUREKA"" featurette (00:14:49 minutes long).",1298678400,2,4470,5.035135135135135

When my young great-nephew, age 10, visited, this one was one series that he could watch without supervision. His grandma started watching it too, and it was well-received by both. The great-nephew went on Eureka marathon, trying to get in all of the series (he did) before he had to leave, even with a busy schedule. He would get out of bed at 6 a.m. so he could begin before the rest of the day's activities. It even won out over computer games.

7037453,1,B00UGPKYMS,"Every episode now has the same plot: a menace created by lab employees threatens the entire town and is thwarted by the lead characters. The uninspired actor selection has now reached unbelievable with the 30ish Barbie-doll love-interest who also happens to be a leading scientist in her field. What a joke: Leading scientists don't dress for fashion at work. And a girl who in a couple years goes from being a CD shoplifting reb to entering Harvard in senior high school year? That's just preposterous. An IQ of 157, for those who have/want high IQs, is being mistaken for actually being well-educated over many years. The sheriff is living comfortably in a house that records all his activity, and tried to kill him: I'd have the place taken apart. The repetitive ""establishing shots"" of the cafe (there aren't two places to eat in a town that size?) and the lab (it only has a front?) got old years ago in the first season.

The series premise was a mysterious inter-universe artifact in super-secret Section 5 under the control of spies outside the lab. Maybe I just fast forwarded in boredom but ... was that ever resolved? It always puzzled me this show was labeled as ""humorous"", when it always seemed to me like inept, irregular writing (the out-of-place sheriff isn't funny so much as scary and implausible). Would you want lethal tech in the hands of such incompetents? Or any group? (Write your congressperson.)

I would have to assume anyone buying 3.5 has seen seasons 1 - 3 or are getting it as a gift for someone that has.

If you are getting it for yourself then you already know what you are getting, if you are getting for someone who has 1 - 3 then my bet is that it will be a very welcome gift. There are very few TV shows I buy the DVD of, Eureka made the cut easily. Sort of reminds of a modern and high-tech version of Green Acres, the ""normal"" guy is the oddball in that town.

I was going to take a star for the odd delivery (3.5) but in thinking about it would not be fair, the shows in my opinion were as good as the rest, better than some, while prior seasons may have had a tighter theme for the season, I am not sure that is a requirement for show like this, if there is a theme great, if not, the shows stand on their own for the most part which works for me.

Ever heard of it?

Season 1 - 24 dollars for 12 episodes. 2 dollars per episode.
Season 2 - 29 dollars for 13 episodes. 2 dollars 23 cents per episode.
Season 3/3.5 - 40 dollars for 18 episodes. 2 dollars 22 cents per episode.

7037541,2,B00UGPKYMS,"Four stars for content of what is there, zero stars for the smarmy marketing trick to squeeze more dollars out. Two overall.

As to content: I have to say that, yes, the series was grasping at straws a bit in the episodes included in this set, so there isn't that interesting backstory that runs through the season. The characters are just a lot of fun, though, and the wild situations that arise, as improbable as they seem, are entertaning. So, not as sophisticated, but still good fun.

As to smarmy marketing tricks: Another reviewer mentioned that the third season ""break"" occurred between September of one year and July of another. That seems like less of a ""break"" than just two short seasons, number them as you will. I would agree that it is better to have the episodes available sooner, rather than later, but packaging them this way seems an awful lot like a marketing trick. It almost seems like they intentionally spaced them out as they did but called them all part of one season so they could pull this trick. I bought 3.0 without carefully reading what it contained and was unpleasantly surprised that I had paid as much as I did for so little content. I would not have bought it at that price had I been more astute and had I not expected the releases to follow the prior seasons where I bought actual season length collections. Caveat emptor and shame on me, but the result is that I am now distrustful of the releases and will be much less likely to buy them until the price comes down to something I consider more reasonable. And I will very carefully read everything about them to make sure I fully understand what the latest legerdemain is that the marketing folks have come up with. I don't remember what I paid for each of the first two seasons, but I am pretty sure it was somewhat less than the roughly $38 plus shipping times two instead of one, it would cost to buy both ""halves"" of the so-called Season 3.
