8634292,5,B00HQI72PK,"The joyful and sweet essence of the first collection turns darker as family secrets and tragedies enter the lives of the Little Busters.

8634295,4,B00HQI72PK,The first season was pretty boring but things begin to pick up here. It still has quite a few boring episodes but it kept me interested. Only to find out at the end that there is another part to the series that they never dubbed after I watched the credits. So I ordered it from eBay and was not disappointed even though I had to watch it in Japanese...which is fine. It's called Little Busters: Refrain,1406505600,,403,4.315789473684211
