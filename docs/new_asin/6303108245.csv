7839237,4,6303108245,"Unlike a lot of other ""hip"" mountain biking video's with hard rock music, and jumps, and more jumps.  This video has a sort of mild Bob Villa (from ""This Old House"") tone to it. It's pleasant, you'll learn how to mountain bike better, (but it's not a strict mountain biking video), and it's enjoyable. Be sure to watch the final cuts after the video is done.",1053648000,,358,4.424242424242424
