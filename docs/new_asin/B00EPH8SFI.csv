5933081,4,B00EPH8SFI,"Very good graphics - B+; very good voicing - B+; good graphics (CGI) - B; very good dialogue/humor broad enough to find an audience in the younger years as well as up into the maturing years (never ends) - A-. The episodes have continuity to them in that each leads, a little, into the next. Somewhat creative storytelling in that the overall plot line of an alien trying every which way to subdue the Earth is told in ways that haven't been done countless times before; seems like all his attempts get humorously sidetracked.",1383696000,3,526,4.6063829787234045
5933082,3,B00EPH8SFI,"This is NOT a feature film, but rather episodes of the TV series which all feature Coverton (Jeff Bennett) the same boring alien. The cloning aspect is in one episode about midway through the features. The characters are drawn pretty much the same, but have difference voices than the successful films. I really miss Reese Witherspoon and Steven Colbert. The writing is humorous, but not knee-jerk funny for adults. Unlike the films, these episodes are geared strictly to the kids in such a fashion adults will find them boring.

For instance in one scene, the monsters are kicked out and they call themselves, ""Monsters without a cause."" Younger kids won't make the connection and adults who do will won't find it funny.

At 3 hours long, the DVD is well worth the price to keep the younger kids occupied and entertained.",1382745600,7,822,4.822695035460993

8608101,4,B00EPH8SFI,"Lots of fun.  The series is hit and miss but mostly hit.  Coverton is worth the price of admission all by himself.  One of the greatest animated characters ever.  You gotta love this guy.  Conversely ... the fortunately much less used character Sta-abi is not once ounce better than Jar Jar Binks but certainly cut from a similar mold.  .... at the end of the day, this series is cute enough, clever enough and overall funny enough to get the job done.  It's not as great as The Penguins Of Madagascar or Dragons but if you liked the movie and are willing to come in the door with reasonable expectations for a Nic kids version, there's no reason not to enjoy this series.",1478217600,,672,4.414634146341464
8608102,1,B00EPH8SFI,"Very displeased.
It does not contain the complete season of the TV show. It also does not identify which of the two seasons it does contain nor does it list the individual episodes included so one could possibly identify which of the 2 seasons from that.
The image is all out of focus.  Just to make sure I was not expecting too much, I compared the videos on this disk to the same videos purchased from Samsung, Google, and Amazon Prime.
Samsung, Google, and Amazon Prime videos are nice and clear. These give me a headache when I watch.",1457395200,,538,4.434343434343434

8608104,5,B00EPH8SFI,"For folks unfamiliar with the backstory, in the film Monsters vs. Aliens bride-to-be Susan was hit by a meteorite that contained a substance called quantonium, which caused her to grow to an enormous size. After being jilted at the altar by her fianc, Susan (now dubbed Ginormica), joined a top-secret team of monsters who have pledged to protect the Earth: the goofy B.O.B., a brainless blob of blue jelly, mad scientist Dr. Cockroach, whose head looks just like his name, and The Missing Link, who is part ape, part fish, and all wisecracks. The group teamed up to protect the Earth from an alien invasion and Ginormica found a new home and true friends.  The series picks up after the events in the Monsters vs. Aliens film. Team Monster are hanging out, relaxing at their headquarters, Area Fifty-Something, when another alien spaceship arrives. While trying to calm the hysterical President Hathaway, General W.R. Monger and the gang soon determine that the spaceship contains the alien Coverton. He says he wants to make peace with Earth, but may be in cahoots with another alien on a not-too-friendly mission. Coverton and his naughty antics feature in all of the discs episodes.
