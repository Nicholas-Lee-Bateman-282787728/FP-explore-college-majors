8209489,5,B00009IB3Y,"Twins and Kindergarten Cop - a match made in heaven! Schwarzenegger is hilarious in both. In Twins, his twin brother, Danny Devito, go on a quest to search for their mother. One of the best lines from Twins is when Arnold puts on a t-shirt and says ""Born ... to be bad."" In Kindergarten Cop, Arnold faces an enemy on par with the predator .... children. Schwarzenegger's looking for a guy that murdered a drug addict and is looking for his kids. So, Arnold goes under cover as a school teacher after his partner gets a stomach virus. There are countless lines that are great. If you're looking for two great movies, look no further.",1055980800,,632,4.504347826086956
