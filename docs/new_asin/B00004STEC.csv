7921890,1,B00004STEC,I got the video because I liked about all the matches and they seemed to be good but I was wrong the matches are good but the HIGHLIGHTS of the matches were VERY SHORT and their was no crowed reaction they took the crowd reaction out and replaced it w/ boring awful sounding music!  This video just sucks! Theirs not one good thing I can say about it DO NOT get the video! I got the stupid video and that same week I took it back and got my money back its not worth it leave it on the shelf and get Wrestlemania 17 or Summerslam 2000 instead.  WWF Eve of Destruction Sucks the worst WWF Video ever to come out!!!,991094400,6,612,4.049586776859504
7921891,5,B00004STEC,"After watching this tape, I was moved. Although I have been a wrestling fan since I was a small child, I always before thought that wrestlers were dumb, muscle-bound jerks. This tape changed my opinion though, becasue for the first time I saw that what they do is dangerous. Regarless of the precautions taken, there is always a risk of serious injury. Seeing the interviews of the superstars speaking about their shock/fear of seeing things like the famous Mankind/Undertaker 'Hell-in-a-Cell' match, I finally realised that these people form a very close bond and they are human after all.
The Stonecold/Vince match was one I had not seen upto this point and hearing the way Stonecold was stunned when he seriously hurt his boss was a touching moment, as was the reaction of Shane McMahon. It's obvious that, even after all this time, the match and his father's injuries, still upset him.
The Rock/Mankind 'Last-Man-Standing' match was one I had seen and hearing personal thoughts of the two participants made me see the match in a different way.
The Shane/X-Pac match was one I had seen and I always thought it was cool because shane is not a professional wrestler but he did amazingly well during that match.
The segment focusing on Stonecold and his wide variety of vehicles was sooooo cool! Seeing the cement truck and the beer truck were definitely may favourites of this segment!
The 'Tag-Team Ladder Match' was totally awesome! These four guys are totally insane but watching them in this match gave me a new respect for them.
All in all, this tape is great. The only thing I don't like about it is it is WAY TOO SHORT!!!!!! If you're a WWF fan, buy this tape!",987120000,,1668,4.7353951890034365
7921892,2,B00004STEC,"Great matches in my opinion are: Shawn Michaels vs. Undertaker Hell in a Cell at Badd Blood, The Rock vs. HHH at Rebellion, Mick Foley vs. Taker  Hell in a Cell at King of the Ring, Austin at WM14 and WM15, Andre the  Giant vs. Hulk Hogan at WM3, Hogan vs. Warrior, Shawm Michaels vs. Razor  Ramon Ladder match... and on and on and on! There are about 100 amazing  matches that you must see, so tell me something, why does this tape last 40  minutes and contain 4 matches? A waste of time by the WWF and you the fan.  Since when was X-Pac vs. Shane-o-Mac ever a classic?",966556800,3,570,4.136363636363637
7921893,1,B00004STEC,"If the contents of the tape were half as good as the name it might have  been decent. Each match is cut somewhat and the interviews are lackluster  and stale. Also these matches are advertised as the best of the year but  aren't. Many great matches from '99 aren't on this tape. Ignore this tape  at any costs. Just buy a '99 PPV.(ex/Wrestlemania XV, Backlash, Summer  Slam)",962755200,,374,4.522388059701493
