2812446,3,B000P6R9OE,"It was not that bad a movie, maybe not a five stars choice ... but it was entertaining. One just wonders what was the original shooting language. The English version sounds dubbed at times; although not as poor as some old Chinese movies ... it lacked emotion or inflection in many sequences, but I cannot tell.

It is a movie for kids or early teenagers, pretty much a-la-Conan the Barbarian style. Granted that the storyline and dialogs could have done much better with some work ... but last time I checked Jay Hernandez and/or Jason Scott Lee had not been nominated for an Oscar ... :-) ...

I didn't have the choice of 2.5 stars, so I gave it 3 stars",1185753600,4,655,4.404958677685951
2812447,4,B000P6R9OE,"When the only other Kazakhi film on people's minds this year is a Jackass-style pseduo-documentary comedy about a bumbling Kazakhi reporter named Borat, it's probably hard to get people interested in a Kazakhi war epic. Much less one with subtitles. Especially when the cover makes it look like a 300 knockoff or a Gladiator wannabe. But Nomad: The Warrior stands on its own as a sprawling desert landscaped, bloody battlefield epic piece of cinema.

Mostly set in Kazakhstan in 1710, Nomad follows the story of a young man who is born to fulfill the prophecy of uniting the three warring sects of his country to rid themselves of their violent enemies once and for all. Spanning over 30 years, the film never flinches as it uncovers intense hardcore battle sequences staged with Braveheart-esque grandiosity. Heads will roll and warriors will run screaming and flaming off camera, all under the watchful eyes of directors Sergei Bodrov and Ivan Passer. The washed out desert landscapes are reminiscent of Gladiator, and while the story itself never reaches the true epic magnificence of the Ridley Scott movie, Nomad does manage to come close, lacking the singular vision and unique story to truly find its place among the famous period epics.

Each character here has been powerfully created by this strong multi-cultural cast. Kuno Becker (Goal!, Goal II, Goal!3) stars as Mansur, the prophetic warrior of the title. With his mouth set in a grim line he travels from battlefield to battlefield hardly flinching at the various attacks launched against him. As an almost unbeatable warrior, Mansur has the training and determination to rival any warrior in recent cinematic history. And Nomad: The Warrior has the film clips to prove it. Jay Hernandez (Hostel, Hostel II, and Friday Night Lights) comes in a close second as Mansur's equally well-trained, but less prophetic, ""brother"" Erali. Both of them, along with a small army, have been trained by the wise Master Oraz (masterfully played by Jason Scott Lee) to face the dangerous Jungers in a final showdown battle.

Every scene in the film is carefully crafted and executed, laid out in classic mythical style, but constantly infused with reality-driven character development. Except for its palatable 111 minute running time, Nomad: The Warrior is an epic in every sense of the word: love, betrayal, brotherhood, loyalty, prophecy, and responsibility all make their required appearances, but it never feels typical or unoriginal. The subtitles manage to make the film feel more authentic somehow, and the big budget fight scenes serve as a reminder that the filmmakers were never left wanting. Audiences will find that after watching Nomad, they're not left wanting either. But seeing as the DVD itself doesn't contain any extras at all, not even the standard ""making of"" featurette, true fans of the film may find themselves asking for more.",1185062400,42,2900,5.126849894291754

2812449,3,B000P6R9OE,"""Nomad"" was KZ's first big try to work with a Hollywood studio to make a film.  It suffered from the disease that inflicts many movies - too many cooks in the kitchen.  A film like this, being made in these circumstances, needs a person or a couple of people with a strong vision for the story, and for the characters, and for where the film is going to take us.

2812471,3,B000P6R9OE,"I gave this 3 stars(rounded down from 3).  This was a film with great potential.  It had beautiful costumes, scenery, good development of the characters, and good action sequences for the most part but what let me down was the final battle.  I don't want to give away anything so I will keep it general.  There was insufficient attention/explanation/story given to how the final battle unfolded to make it appealing to the viewer which is a shame given the fact I thought the movie was quite enjoyable up to that point.  Having said this it was still worth a watch.

I purchased this film for a reasonable price as a result of first seeing Mongol, which I was quite impressed with.  Nomad is similar in some ways but it is no Mongol, which is definitely a cut above (please excuse the expression).",1351123200,,797,4.570422535211268

2812473,4,B000P6R9OE,"This isn't a film for everyone, and if you're expecting awesome battle scenes and tons of effects you are going to be disappointed.  What this film does is portray a little known yet historically important culture in a fairly authentic and entertaining manner.  it is ideal for history buffs and fans of Russian movie directors.

I watched this with my Kazakh wife, who loved the portrayal of her people, even though the main actors were not Kazakh.  After renting it, she insisted that we buy the DVD so that our kids could watch it for some perspective on the culture they come from.  What we agree on is that it is beautifully filmed, with good cinematography.  There is a bit of the ""Russian movie"" effect in that it can be slow at times, but by Soviet film making standards, this is the Russian equivalent of ""Speed"" or ""Crank"".

Personally, I liked ""Mongol"" better, but the fact that anyone managed to make a watchable film out of Kazakh history is still pretty impressive.",1303862400,3,979,4.656976744186046
2812474,2,B000P6R9OE,"The epic story was set up beautifully.  You had a people, a prophesy and a deadly enemy trying to keep the prophesy from coming to fruition. A baby is born and as he grows begins instruction as the prophesied warrior that'll vanquish the enemies of his Mongolian people.  Like these mongolian tribes, I couldn't wait to see the child become a great man-warrior while adding to the great settings and costumes of this movie.

Then it happens. The child grows up in this beautiful asian land full of beautiful asian people practicing ancient asian customs. Immediately I notice the huge fault in the movie.  The child, who's destined to lead his people, has grown into what looks like a young caucasian male, the least likely actor in the movie to play the role of ""Golden Child"" in an asian land.  Heck, his sidekick who looks Puerto Rican, would've fit the role better than he.

I tried but couldn't continue to suspend belief while watching. If I felt like this, I wonder how asian peoples must feel when viewing this movie.  I'm sure the Mexican-American actor playing the role questioned why he was chosen as the lead over say, Jason Scott Lee, the asian looking seer and teacher in the movie.

The movie had so much potential.  It had me hooked early.  Until Nomad turned out to be America's next male model. From there the hole story seemed to lose its luster and go into superhero mode. Sorry folks, but this movie is a step backwards for race relations in film. I still can't believe the asian cast agreed to go along with this major fault in the film.

2812476,3,B000P6R9OE,"In a time when Antoine Fucqua and Ridley Scott attempt to bring their mythologized heroes down to earth in ""King Arthur"" and ""Robin Hood"" it's odd to see this Ivan Passer film attempt just the opposite. ""Nomad"" deals with a Kazakh warrior, Mansur, who was prophesied to unite all the Kazakh tribes and lead them to victory over the Junger invaders. The movie even takes notes from various ancient stories, including the old and new testaments, where the invading ruler needs to find and kill the prophesied child so said prophecy cannot come to fruition.

This is an OK movie. The costumes, sets, use of the landscape and cinematography are all great. The writing, however, pulls everything down. The approach reminded me of epics from the 60s where the characters were more iconic than real. And the actors here could not rise above the stilted dialogue. It were as though the writers knew what needed to be done, but simply did not know how to do it. For instance: (and I don't believe I'm spoiling anything here) As the tribes all rally for the final battle the viewer is not certain why. The movie shows nothing that the hero has done to bring this disparate group of tribes together. And that was the whole point of the movie. That's one example but there are a few more of near equal importance.

The directing is uneven. Some of the scenes show great scope and detail. Seeing these people in their native garb and carrying out various tasks and rituals brings much needed life to the proceedings. But some of the climax stuff, fights and battles, aren't up to snuff. As lousy as Hollywood can be with certain things they probably would have done a better job of this than these folks did. They get this sort of thing all too well.

This is not a bad watch. For the above mentioned reasons there is some very good film making going on here. Just don't figure it's going to be the best in class.",1297123200,,1900,4.549707602339181

2812491,4,B000P6R9OE,"While one can appreciate this film as an action film or a ""Kazakh western"" in the tradition of John Ford, it is something more. It is a fictionalized version of the youth of Ablai Kahn, who in real life unified the Kazakh clans and led them against the Dzungars in the early 18th century. Kazakhstan emerged from the fall of the Soviet Union with the need to establish a new national identity. It has been aided in this effort by the discovery of oil, and a consequent influx of oil money. This film, made at the cost of some $40 million, takes advantage of the new wealth and seems clearly intended to establish a founding myth for the Kazakh nation-state. Kazakhstan is a rapidly modernizing nation with a sophisticated modern urban population little understood by Americans. The American audience for this film might find it helpful in visualizing historical Kazakhstan, and in understanding the myths which underly Kazakh sense of identity. Or they can simply sit back and enjoy the action.",1242864000,3,994,4.818713450292398

The film implies brutality, but tries not to grind the brutality in your face.  Instead the history, honor, virtue are the spirit of the film giving it a much more transcendent sense.

2812494,4,B000P6R9OE,"Nomad: The Warrior brings to the screen the story of a young Kazakh who grows up to become the hero that will rid Kazakh lands of enemies and unite the scattered tribes.
I will agree with the previous reviewer in that the Jungars had more of a legitimate claim to Genghis Khan's legacy while the Kazakhs were the ones that sought Russia's protection as opposed to the other way around. Hence the movie is historically inaccurate as it follows a Kazakh nationalist agenda which includes the slightest anti-Russian jabs.
Jason Scott Lee, Kuno Becker, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows, though I fail to see why foreign actors were used to portray Kazakhs. Moreover, it was rather obvious that the lead actors were ethnically different from the supporting cast to the point that Mansur and his father are as similar as far as both of them belonging to the human race and that's about it (i.e. father and son look nothing like one another).
Additionally, Gauhar's capture was a bit ridiculous, thus becoming a bit of a spoiler.
Furthermore, those that wrote the Greek subtitles do not know the difference between Cossacks and Kazakhs!!! Amateurs!
Nevertheless, the setting, the dialogues, and the costumes are all wonderful! The scenery in particular is breathtaking and the movie does a great job of shedding light on several peoples of the central Asian steppes.
In a nutshell, Nomad: The Warrior is a movie definitely worth watching as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment, though it could have easily avoided the mistakes it made.",1219708800,2,1709,4.934027777777778
2812495,2,B000P6R9OE,"While this movie has some good fight scenes and the cinematography is quite good, the basic premise of the movie is ridiculously flawed.

From the very beginning, Jason Scott Lee's narrative talks about the Kazakh's people having ancestors like Genghis Khan, and having to fight off invaders such as the Jungars.  The Kazakhs are only partly descended from the Mongols, as they were primarily a Turkic people whose cities were DESTROYED by Genghis Khan and his Mongol army.  Jungars were more direct descendants of Genghis Khan than the Kazakhs ever were.

In the movie, we see the Jungar Khan getting cannons from what look like the Russians.  Funnily enough, historically it was the Kazakhs who sought protection by the Russians against the Jungars...

I'm curious as to why the Kazakhs participated in the movie when the historical references about their people were so wrong...",1217980800,,881,5.083333333333333
2812496,5,B000P6R9OE,"A beautiful film with a straight forward and sufficient plot. There was even something endearingly sweet and charming about it despite all the fighting.

Thanks for a hero who is strong and is just a nice guy with inner strength and warrior skills and does not have to rub our face in it with bluster and swagger! These visual cliches could have worked too, but it has been done countless times by John Wayne, Bruce Willis, etc. Becker was a refreshing alternative that worked for me given the script. His people had been waiting for a prophesied warrior-leader -- and he was up to his destiny without having to be theatrically charismatic. In fact he was raised learning to conceal his identity and destiny and that helped make his modesty and quiet strength work for me. Of course the deviation from warrior-hero stereotypes and uncomplicated script also offered fresh meat for the critics who apparently expected it to be in competition with other epics and used them as standards.

I don't think the film was over-dramatized or that the blood was gratuitous and this may disappoint some viewers. I am glad that I took some negative reviews with a grain of salt. No, it was not sensational Hollywood or Eisenstein and did not knock me off my feet, but there are lots of standards and various ways in which films can be good.

I googled ""kazakhstan mansur"" and found interesting comments on the book by Ilyas Yesenberlin and on the film and on the actual historical figure. Not every historical ""epic"" makes me spend time to learn more about a remote country!",1214524800,15,1561,4.731617647058823

One group of people wants to take over another and the fight is on--the languange & location really don't matter once you get that. The scenery is unbelievable; the charcters honorable and heroic; the violence mild by the standards of any American slasher movie; and the love story touching and ""G"" rated.

It is a movie about nation of Kazakhs who live in tundra region between mighty mountains and mighty nations of China and Russia.  They are conquered by Mongols, Jungars and other nations until there is a prophecy that a new warrior, descendant of Ginghis Khan will bring them freedom and unity.  It is a spectacular movie with great fighting scenes, horseback riding bonanza, wonderful costumes, unique language and exotic looking beautiful women.  Film also shows the value of friendship and loyalty.  Our young warrior and creator of a nation is lucky to have a wise man for a teacher who teaches him not only how to fight battles and ride horses, but also how to be wise and patient ruler of the people.

2812510,2,B000P6R9OE,"Certainly NOMAD has some of the best horse riding scenes, swordplay, and scrumptious landscape cinematography you'll likely see, but this isn't what makes a film good. It helps but the story has to shine through on top of these things. And that's where Nomad wanders.

The story is stilted, giving it a sense that it was thrown together simply to make a ""cool"" movie that ""looks"" great. Not to mention that many of the main characters are not from the region in which this story takes place (and it's blatantly obvious with names like Lee and Hernandez). If movie makers want to engross us in a culture like the Jugars and the Kazaks, they damn well better use actors/actresses that look the part.

Warring tribes, a prophecy, brotherly love and respect, a love interest that separates our ""heroes"", are all touched on but with so little impact and screen time that most viewers will brush them aside in favor of the next battle sequence, the next action horse scene, or the breathtaking beauty of the landscape.

It is worth mentioning that there were some significant changes made to Nomad during its filming, specifically the director and cinematographer. Ivan Passer (director) was replaced by Sergei Bodrov, and Ueli Steiger (cinematographer) was replaced by Dan Laustsen. In one respect, Laustsen seems to have the better eye since his visions of the lands made the final cut that we see here. Definitely a good thing. However, the changing over to Bodrov as director may not have been the wisest choice. From what I'm seeing here, the focus is on the battles and not the people, which I sense comes from Bodrov's eyes and not Passer's. A true travesty.

The most shameful aspect is that this could've been a really fantastic film, with both character and action focuses. Unfortunately, the higher-ups apparently decided that action was what was needed and took the cheap (intellectually speaking) way out.

Even though I can't give this film a positive rating, it is worth watching simply for the amazing cinematography work. But that's all.",1201564800,7,2048,4.907514450867052
