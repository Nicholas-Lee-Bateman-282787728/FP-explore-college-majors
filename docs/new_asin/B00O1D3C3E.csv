6699691,1,B00O1D3C3E,A ridiculous price for a t.v. Movie dvd.  Will wait till the after Xmas price of 7.98!,1418256000,3,86,4.0588235294117645
6699692,3,B00O1D3C3E,"Another installment in Hallmark's Countdown to Christmas with some nice looking stars, dresses, dances and a very predictable, familiar story.

Lacy Chabert stars as Emily, a potential princess to be, who discovers her boyfriend, Leo, played sweetly by Irish born Stephen Hagan, is a prince.  They love each other, and he takes her off to his family's Cordinia palace where she tries to fit in but finds herself at odds with his mother, scowlingly played by wonderful Jane Seymour.

A plug for Walmart shows up early.  The plot plays pretty thin, but it's a clean family flick with good production values; although, our kids wandered off knowing a romance when they see one.  We really like the Countdown to Christmas movies; this season, our favorite is ""Nine Lives of Christmas"" based on the novel of the same title.

Overall, pretty to look at, but lacks originality, umph and a good twist of some form.  P.S.  The price here is ridiculous.  The DVD is in the stores, but I'm going to recommend to Amazon that they offer these movies, too, at a reasonable price!",1418169600,23,1065,4.775956284153006
6699693,5,B00O1D3C3E,"What????  How can this be????  A movie with not a single word of swearing, cursing, inappropriate innuendo, profanity or vulgarity, and it's STILL a FANATASTIC movie????  How can this be?  And the heroine actually chooses her true love and that ""old fashioned institution"" called ""marriage"" over life as a single career woman?  How can this be?  How can she possibly be happy bound to a man?

Of course I'm being facetious, but sincere.  What a breath of fresh air this movie is, rising above the endless stream of junk being produced today.  What a great contribution to beautiful old fashioned romance, and fun, feel-good romantic movies.  Only a hardened cynic could criticize its wholesome nature and happy ending.  It's a Cinderella story for sure, but it's so fun to be whisked away on a romantic fairy tale for a couple hours.

The heroine initially gave up her prince, not because she wanted to choose a career over him, but because she loved him and wanted what she believed was best for him.  That's what people who truly love, do; they sacrifice for those they love.  Too bad more movies wouldn't show sacrificial love rather than superficial lust.

I've seen only a handful of Hallmark movies.  Years ago, I assumed the ""Hallmark"" brand meant a clean movie with no swearing.  I've discovered in recent years that is no longer true, and Hallmark cannot be trusted.  I don't buy movies with foul language or sexual innuendo, but after seeing this one online, I plan to buy it when it becomes available for a reasonable price.

I also loved the little sub-plot revealed near the end.  So cute!  And it's a joy to watch Jane Seymour act.  I don't think I've ever seen her play a ""villain.""  So if you're looking for a really great fun romantic clean Christmas movie, this is the one for you!  It was REALLY GOOD!",1418083200,81,1820,4.668769716088328

Even toward the end of the ball, his ex had him by the arm while congratulating his return.  After all was said and done, he finally had the gumption to stand up for Lacey.  Too bad she just didn't drop him, but that's my opinion!  I really disliked his character, but it was only a movie and that's how his character was written.",1487894400,,633,4.469565217391304

I feel like they are too short though and wish it would get more in depth with the characters like how they met, when they started dating, etc. but guess that's a hallmark film for you. Films like these aren't so much about quality as more as just delivering a romantic, sappy, christmasy film. The acting does annoy me at times which is difficult to do considering I like corny films but it gets to be ok. According to my mum, I'm very critiquing so I commented on the casting, the script writers who I felt could have done better...it makes me wonder if these are low budget films but still. I feel like they could have done waay better and actually done a more than decent film.

Leo allowed mother and Natasha to push Emily out of the way in every situation, instead of telling the two women to back off, and placing Emily center in his life and time while at court.  No way to treat a GF.  Yet, Emily clearly does not use her noggin either, interrupting the kitchen help during a major function at the palace, a ball, to help her make a hoagie, really Emily?  No wonder they got fired.  Emily was very likeable but really silly and ridiculous, and needed to leave the help to do their jobs be it the maids, cooks or guards.

6700453,5,B00O1D3C3E,"This 2014 romantic film is part of the Hallmark Countdown to Christmas collection.  We begin in New York City.  Outside, its snowy and getting close to Christmas.  Amidst the brownstone houses, Emily Taylor (Lacey Chabert) has just made breakfast for herself and her boyfriend Leo (Stephen Hagan).  Leo is far away from home and just finished college in New York.  The happy couple has been dating for about a year now, and they are looking forward to their first Christmas together.  They have obviously grown very attached to each other.
But then, Momma calls  Isadora  QUEEN Isadora!
Thats right!  Leo is actually Prince Leopold of Cordinia, a kingdom in the South of France.  Leo has been enjoying his anonymity in the USA.  Isadora wants Leopold to come home for the holidays, so Leo has to fess up about Leopold and his royal heritage.  When Leo takes Emily home to meet the Queen (Jane Seymour), the fun begins.
As you might expect, Isadora is just now finding out about Emily and it doesnt sit well when she finds out her Leopold is in love with an American COMMONER, who is also the daughter of a tailor, and by trade, is a unsuccessful (but talented) dress designer.  So Izzie starts out on a path to break up this relationship by trying to make Emily feel uncomfortable and by reminding Leopold of his duty to marry the Dutchess Natashia.
Chabert has done several of the Hallmark Christmas movies and she is excellent, very appealing and down to earth.  Hagan makes a nice match for her as the royal Prince and ordinary guy combined.  Seymour is wonderful as the snarky, uppity Queen.  The head butler, Victor, and Dutchess, Natashia are also great in their supporting roles.  This is a very entertaining 87 minute flick about love vs. the perceived obligations of the throne.",1455667200,3,1787,4.731391585760518

This movie, ""A Royal Christmas,"" is from the Hallmark Channel and represents their usual stable of movies--heavy on romance, very light on offensive elements (like sex, nudity, violence and coarse language) and everything generally comes out right in the end.  This is not a challenging movie, but it is a comforting, ""drink your hot chocolate, wrap up in a comforter during a snowy day during the holiday season"" kind of movie.  Essentially, this is a nonmusical rework of ""The Student Prince,"" where an incognito member of royalty falls in love with a regular girl.  And, of course, everything works out in the end, even with some light comedic elements thrown in for good measure.  If you can accept the improbable premise, you should really enjoy the movie.  It has Jane Seymour and Lacey Chabert.  Recommended",1453852800,5,857,4.951048951048951

6700592,1,B00O1D3C3E,"I couldn't give it less than 1 star, so here we go.  I watched this movie on the Hallmark channel with my sister this weekend.  This movie suited someone OK taking in a movie catered to the ""weak American commoner"" & ""European characters eating the poor commoner American alive with their despicable uncouth behavior""  mindset which screams of tasteless (difficult to watch) behavior by the ""upper crust"" in european society full of insecure sticks in the muds. This doesn't speak well of persons from either end of the globe. Not an ounce of humor in this kind of story. Not only did the female lead lack any type of backbone, but also common sense & moxy.  The son also was spineless in light of his Mom's behavior.  I've seen plenty of movies about the American in Europe theme and this movie, was just too hard to sit through.  They did however, squeeze some Christmas ball event & holiday decorations the camera included in the shots to simply remind us that as bad as this was, that it's still a holiday flick.  That didn't work for me as the ""holiday"" felt like more of an afterthought.  It's a Post Menopausal take on Mean Girls - UK Version.  I felt insulted as a viewer.  Newsflash, Americans aren't really this clueless and aloof in the face of this kind of ignorance!  I found no feel good moments in this flick. Most certainly would not have children sit thru something like this. There are just too many other good flicks that make you smile that can be viewed this holiday season.",1448668800,2,1495,4.561797752808989
6700593,5,B00O1D3C3E,"This is my far the best Hallmark movie ever made. I'm not going to lie, most of the movies that Hallmark makes are really cheesy and have mediocre actors (sorry Hallmark), but this movie is different. First of all Lacey Chabert and Jane Seymour are in this movie, both of whom are very well and great known actresses. Then you have also Stephan Hagan, a lesser known actor, but who is also really great. All of the actors in this movie are actually really great. I think I've watched this movie at least 10 times on Hallmark Channel--- so many that I just decided to spend the $9 and just buy it from amazon. Buy this movie, you will not regret it!",1448668800,2,648,4.319672131147541
6700594,5,B00O1D3C3E,"This movie starts with a happy couple happily in love and then goes downhill from there when hes summoned home by his overbearing dictatorial mother, the Queen of nowhere important.  Poor Emily Taylor (Lacey Chabert) has the misfortune to fall in love with a spineless prince (Stephen Hagan as Leo) who cannot say no to his mommy.  As such, he willingly puts the woman he supposedly loves through all manner of upsets, insults, and humiliation at the hands of a despicable mother and her clique of snobby friends.  This continues in full force throughout the movie as there is no end to the amount of vitriol the Queen (Jane Seymour) is willing to dispense in her quest to see that her son is unhappily married to a proper/acceptable woman of title.  That he goes along with his mothers manipulations knowing the pain he is causing his girlfriend.....................!

This is a weird and twisted romance that is best served by the presence of Lacey Chabert.  As the longsuffering girlfriend of a dutiful son, Chabert elevates this movie to a higher standing than it would otherwise merit from the work of a lesser actress.  She is the only real thing in this fractured fairytale.",1448582400,,1181,4.816831683168317

6700869,4,B00O1D3C3E,"A ROYAL CHRISTMAS, one of the twelve offerings produced in 2014 by the Hallmark film factory for its Countdown to Christmas campaign, carries whiffs of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Princess-Diaries-Two-Disc-Collectors-Set/dp/B000209KMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Princess Diaries (Two-Disc Collectors Set)</a>&nbsp;and Hallmark's own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Princess-for-Christmas/dp/B008U1ANHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Princess for Christmas</a>. I will say that, of these three, A ROYAL CHRISTMAS isn't the strongest picture. Doesn't mean I didn't like it. I find Lacey Chabert to be perfectly winning, and, even after all this time, I'm still partial to Jane Seymour, never mind that she plays the heavy in this one.

What's it about? It's about Emily Taylor (Chabert) who designs beautiful clothes and works at her father's modest clothing shop in South Philadelphia. It's about Leo James (Stephen Hagan), the nice guy with the posh accent with whom Emily is going steady. The hook in the plot kicks in when Leo drops a bomb on Emily. It's the holiday season and, to quote LOVE, ACTUALLY, ""At Christmas you tell the truth.""

Leo comes clean to his commoner seamstress, confessing out of the blue that he in reality is Prince Leopold of Cordinia, a tiny sovereign state in the south of France. The prince, posing as a commoner, was permitted to study abroad with the provision that he remained anonymous. And, now, off Leo and Emily dash to spend Christmas in Cordinia where awaits Leo's formidable mother, the imperious Queen Isadora (Seymour).

Schmaltzy and predictable and goofy though it is, A ROYAL CHRISTMAS suits my needs for holiday viewing. It's comfort consumption, like hot cocoa going down on a cold day, like most Hallmark holiday movies. It makes me feel good and safe in knowing that, for the next two hours, I can park the family in front of the telly and not have to avoid eye contact.

Lacey Chabert, whom I first saw way back in PARTY OF FIVE, is cute as a button and brings that girl-next-door accessibility. I buy that her character can effortlessly charm just about everyone in the castle household. I love that she introduces to the castle's bemused kitchen staff the awesome Philadelphia hoagy (one of my favorite foods). Chabert works well in her scenes with Stephen Hagan. Hagan presents a low-keyed likable vibe, but it helps that his princely character is the decent, understanding sort.

The fly in the ointment is the snobbish Queen Isadora. The story conflict manifests when the Queen divulges that she intends to marry off her son to the lovely Duchess Natasha (Katherine Flynn, Seymour's real-life daughter). So, without having set eyes on our girl, she was already predisposed to judge her as wildly inappropriate for the heir to the throne. Can Emily Taylor thaw the Queen's icy heart? Maybe if she can stop slurping off those finger bowls during them fancy dinners. Anyway, when the Queen asks what kind of clothes Emily makes and Emily tells her she has a line of dresses and jackets and hoodies, there's special joy in watching the snooty Queen's lips curl as she distastefully enunciates the word ""hoodies."" Anyway, it's neat watching Ms. Seymour take on a villain role, which may be a first for her.

If cornered and given a choice, I'd admit that I prefer A PRINCESS FOR CHRISTMAS, that's the better movie. But I had fun watching A ROYAL CHRISTMAS, an agreeable holiday film where icy hearts are melted, irrepressible orphans are adopted (yes, there's an orphan), the head butler is benevolent, finger bowls are used inappropriately and the meaty aroma of the hoagy permeates the royal kitchen.",1418515200,7,3750,5.35823429541596
