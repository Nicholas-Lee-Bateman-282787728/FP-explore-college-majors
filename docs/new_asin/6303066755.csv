7836846,5,6303066755,"I laughed again and again.  Johnny was so good with the animals - clearly afraid of some of them, but showman enough to hang in there with them and their antics.  Other talk show hosts haven't had the courage to do this kind of thing. What fun!!  Sharon Ocker",1350604800,,259,4.244897959183674
7836847,5,6303066755,"I bought this tape (70s - 80s), and the 80s-90s tape when they first came out about 10 years ago.  I did not buy the 60s tape at the time because I don't have any real memories of watching ""The Johnny Carson show"" until the early 70s.  My parents never watched it, so I don't have any of the fond memories some of my contemporaries have of staying up with their parents to watch it.  I started watching the Carson show in the early 70s on my own.  I'm so glad I have these tapes, and I just bought a used copy of the 60s shows.  Every time I have watched my tapes of the Carson ""Tonight Show"" I laugh and smile and feel good.

There will never be another Johnny Carson.  He was the King of late night.  Other entertainers tried to go up against Johnny at that time slot, and every one of them failed to take his crown from him.  Johnny reigned supreme until he decided to relinguish his late night crown.

We will always miss you Johnny.  You will never be replaced.",1106870400,,966,4.139784946236559
