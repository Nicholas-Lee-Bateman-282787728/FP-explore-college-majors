8207334,1,B000T28PKG,Very poor video about poker or poker players and certainly not about the world searies of poker. Little information about the game or players is offered. In all a very poor expose.,1521936000,,180,4.65625
8207335,1,B000T28PKG,"I noticed that this was a free download from Netflix, and since I am a big fan of Jim McManus' book, ""Absolutely 5th Street"", I thought this would be great to watch.

I've been wrong before, I was wrong this time too.

I think the casting director made some interesting choices with their portrayal of poker celebrities. Personally, I would have found people that actually looked something like the people they were portraying, but that's my preference.

It was funny to hear at the beginning of the video that great lengths were gone to maintain the historical accuracy of the events that were dramatized. This was especially funny when a fan met ""TJ Cloutier"" in the hotel lobby telling him how much he loved him on the World Poker Tour.

Oh, why was it funny? The video is about the 2000 World Series of Poker. The World Poker Tour didn't exist until 2002.

In addition, Jim McManus plays a $1,000 satellite to earn a seat into the $10k main event. When the table gets down to 2 people, the announcer declares to the poker room over his microphone that McManus is ""all in."" The small problem with that is that there are no announcers for satellites. It's completely absurd to think there would be.

Following the announcer's declaration, McManus then proceeds to slow roll his opponent, something that would likely get the **** beat out of you later in the parking lot.

At this point, I had to stop watching because I couldn't take it anymore. I loved the book McManus wrote so much, and this totally weak portrayal of the events was just too terrible to proceed with.",1214265600,5,1572,4.612903225806452
