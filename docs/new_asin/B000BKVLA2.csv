2423070,5,B000BKVLA2,"That debunk the history of our making on the supposed fact of the history of our evolution by a book that they call the bible that's only 2000 years old when they have the evidence right in front of them that states that mankind (called Neanderthal Man) is over 400 years before Jesus was even here than a man called Jesus Christ because Jesus himself said that ""the people that teach in the synagogues (modern day churches) and on the streets are hypocrites (idiots) and that you are not to believe the hypocrites that like and even love to stand in the synagogues and on the streets and pray out loud in order to garner attention to themselves"". Don'cha know by now that Jesus was an alien from outer space because he revealed himself as a being of light to one of his deciples. He was not of this world because he even stated so. But I just think he was another lousy politician human that the Romans murdered on a medieval torture device called a cross. After all I consider myself to be an agnostic.

2423072,5,B000BKVLA2,This DVD has many interesting facts to offer in for human evolution. It is becoming more apparent that human evolution is real. Within even the last 20 years palentologists are gathering up the fossil and DNA evidence of our past. Hopefully 20 years from now we will have a better understanding of who we are and where we came from. This film is a must see.,1178582400,5,357,4.424242424242424
2423073,4,B000BKVLA2,"I guess you can say it is somewhat made for mainstream television with all of the dramatic cuts, but that just spices up the content that is being viewed; also, it makes it easier to spread this beautiful story.  It is worth watching.",1153872000,8,234,4.441860465116279
2423074,1,B000BKVLA2,"Ape To Man by the History Channel is television's version of a soap opera based on some kind of badly written romance novel.  While they do a good job of chronicling the discoveries and the scientists involved in the search for our past the theories and answers they sometimes come up with are based less on science and more on the need to gain viewers.

For example, showing the Neanderthals being wiped our by early modern man, saying that Neanderthals didn't have art, those are statements designed to shock but have little in the way of fact behind them.  The fossil record shows both groups living side by side in Europe for thousands of years.  If we took thousands of years to kill a group that we outnumbered, outsmarted and outarmed than early modern men were twits.  Tigers would have taken over by now.

Also the Neanderthals DID have art.  Now, maybe they were copying us, but copy cats or not, they had a creative enough mind to make art.  Trying to picture them as backwards and less developed than us is only useful to those who want to believe they were so.  Once again, to support the idea that we wiped them out.

We are not natural born killers - blaming our genes for actions we did, or did not do, is just a way to get out of the guilt of such things as wars and genocide.  Yes, they happen.  No, you can't blame our DNA.  We were hunted well before we became hunters.  Modern problems are caused by greed, bad planning and self-centered minds - not by some actions by the first humans that may, or may not, have happened.

The questions are interesting but the answers are nothing but the same old ones people have been parroting for decades.

If this has been made in the 70s it would have been ahead of it's times.  But this came out in 2005 which means it is a waste of money to buy, new or used.",1141862400,25,1821,4.340236686390533

-That an 1 1/2 feet Ape like Ida that took over 43 millions of years to evolved in a 3 feet Ape like Lucy, further evolved into over 5,000 humans Ethnics races in less than 3..! Just by chiling around the World and, mating on steroids..!

8088205,4,B000BKVLA2,"My background is chemical eng. I like reading the cradle of civilisation, astronomy, physics, archaeology, palaeontology, biology, anthropology, electronics. I've ever seen UFO by my eyes 3 times last year, 2013, (all appeared in the sky. Other people in the area watched it also. I've 2 eye witnesses on the 2nd watched) but I also do believe God existence as I find God's wonderful creation in me & other creations too. How wonderful is my mind & body work. From the lower cast (viruses) - highest (human/ alien) until the mighty universe (galaxies, quasars, dark matter, BLACK HOLES, etc) nothing is created by chance/ coincidentally. Even until subatomic particles bcs scientists found regularities & they can formulate it (nuclear energy, particle elementary science). I can understand some scientists anti/ battle against religion and vise versa bcs they see each other in different angle.

Scientists see anything based on 100% evidence & logic way of thinking while religion(s) is made for human moral guidance only bcs in the past/ ancient time human were still wild/ sadistic. Sometimes religion could explain something but admits miracles. It also admits God(s) who created this life/ Someone who is(are) higher thn us while Budha doesn't believe in God but in reincarnation. Hwvr, correct/ true religion is teaching us about moral/ do good things for humanity. So scientists & religion they see something at different angle bcs they both are created/ exist for a specific job.

Science without religion is like human can understand how material works/ created until subatomic level (elementary particles) but they don't believe tht stones form SOS sign in a desert means someone is in danger. They thought those are created naturally. While religion without science is like our world was created only around 6,000 yrs ago (bible says 1 day on earth is 1,000 yrs in heaven) but many geological evidences indicating/ prove much much older (some billion yrs).

I do believe in evolution/ diversity  theories bcs God commanded to multiply/ full fill earth in the early creation. All creations from viruses-human are equipped wth adaptive capabilities to changing / hostile envinroments. Elvis/ M Jackson could soon be forgotten after several generations but all creations, especially human being, are the legend. It's not a simple task to keep exist & even becomes more versatile/ intelligence  frm a very simple life form in the early creation until now. Some billions yrs already and all creatures are still keep adapting themselves for new environments (eg. climate change).  So both should fulfil each other.",1389052800,,2620,5.226190476190476

8088207,5,B000BKVLA2,"We're following two time lines here: Our actual ancestral history, and the history of discoveries revealing that history. It's not a smooth line. But both stories are fascinating, and the History Channel does a great job of presenting both.

[Pause while I look up something that was not mentioned, and see if I can figure out why.]

OK, now I can explain why Cro Magnon was not mentioned. The term is essentially obsolete among anthropologists, since they simply say ""early modern man."" Fine; I'll go with that. This movie agrees with several things I have read or seen, that Neanderthals are NOT our ancestors. They were a branch of the tree that also evolved from Australopithecus, moved into Europe while those remaining in Africa evolved into modern man. Then when modern man migrated into Europe, the well-established Neanderthal could not compete, and died out.

The most recent fossil humans were thus Homo erectus, Java man, about 800,000 years ago. Neanderthal had already been discovered, but it seemed to imply that the most defining characteristic of our development was larger and larger brains. And of course the Piltdown Man hoax of 1912 didn't help matters any.

Without going into the details, which I would only screw up anyway, let's just say that there are four basic approaches here. One is seeing the scientists in reenactments as they make their discoveries. Another is watching the hominids themselves (also reenactments, of course, but with great makeup and authentic details) as they go about those elements of their lives that go into making humans what we are: Lucy walking erect, Homo Habilis using stone tools, and finally early modern man using language and social organization to defeat the Neanderthals. Then we have modern scientists discussing the development of modern concepts of our family tree as the evidence came to light. Finally, it is all put together in the form of some pretty revealing maps and other graphics.

Somehow they manage to put in a good bit of detail and still keep it comprehensible. That's why I gave it five stars",1336780800,9,2076,4.988439306358382
8088208,1,B000BKVLA2,"Other than laying out in a clear and concise manner the names of both the anthropologists and their fossil finds, this DVD falls way short of being a conclusive presentation of the evidence supporting the theory of evolution. Instead it raises more issues than it answers and leaves one with a disturbing feeling of where the scientific community is trying to take us.  Each major archeological find leads to massive speculation of the importance of each fossil, and in the end, nothing seems at all conclusive from a history standpoint for the student. To present such evidence to show the conclusive nature of evolution is simply intellectually dishonest, as the historic record is just too subjective with each find tainted with the selfish motivations of the finding anthropologist. After viewing this DVD, the title's initial premise of where we came from is still open and subject to a wide debate.",1279497600,,904,5.026666666666666
8088209,4,B000BKVLA2,"I teach Intro to Anthropology at a local community college, and showed this in class last week. The students were engaged throughout, which is quite a feat, considering it's a 9:30am class. The information is factual, and the acting is only a little over the top. A great way to introduce students to the ideas behind human evolution, and to walk them step by step through the discoveries we've made in the past century. I would recommend it for high school and college classes.",1267228800,18,478,4.7023809523809526
8088210,4,B000BKVLA2,"i think what some reviewers called over-dramatization is really just the efforts of the makers to show you where and how in someone's life a discovery was made, as opposed to listing out straight facts.  i thought it was fascinating--they went to great lengths to find these details, and it puts into perspective how recently our science has changed our views.

and i read somewhere that a bigger part of the reason we outlived neanderthal was because they only hunted big game, and the ice age ravished a lot of the big game.  since we also gathered plants and roots for food ('hunter-gatherers'), our diet was more diverse and more adaptable to changing environment.

other than the neanderthal die-off reasons, (they cited bigger brains and direct competition-killing each other) it was a great show for me.",1266969600,11,810,4.9338235294117645
