8213817,2,B000UMUDMI,So dam cheap looking it's hard to watch would have give 1 star but it made me chuckle with the really bad over used ese. Talk,1426118400,,125,3.8461538461538463

8213819,1,B000UMUDMI,This easily ranks as the worst decision I made this week.  I wish there was a way to get the 20 min I spent watching this horrible movie back...holmes.,1396137600,2,151,4.206896551724138
8213820,1,B000UMUDMI,"This is the worst ""movie"" of all time. Not even ironically so bad it's good. Just plain bad. Although it must set the record for the most number of times the word ""holmes"" has been used in a film.",1391990400,,196,4.051282051282051
8213821,2,B000UMUDMI,"HIP HOP LOCOS is mostly a drive through town in a car w/ some ""loco"" gangsters. They talk tough, waxing eloquent about murdering their various enemies, while extolling the virtues of their ""homies"". They do eventually kill some folks, and there is a semi-interesting finale (at least they get out of the car for a minute!), but much of the film is pretty dull...",1379808000,,362,4.671875
8213822,1,B000UMUDMI,"barely qualifys as a movie. Two unnamed shadowy cholos go on an ultamately pointless 80 minet long adventure filled with shaky cameras and ""mexicana slang"" every single scene lasts way too long, causing a since of genuane anger in the viewer.",1378684800,,242,4.926829268292683
8213823,3,B000UMUDMI,"Two gangbangers drive around all night looking for drugs to buy and people to kill. Mostly seated in the car talking, we get endless streams of ""homey"" and other ""street"" dialogue, interrupted occasionally by a strangulation or shooting. Sort of long and repetative, but has a halfway decent ending. Also available on DECREPIT CRYPT OF NIGHTMARES...",1258848000,,349,5.25
