""I wish I could return it and get a refund"" . I have been in martial arts for over twenty years, and wanted to expend some of the knowledge in my dojo. I will have to keep on looking. I known Krav Maga works  but this  DVD will not help you. Very disappointed !!!",1386201600,4,425,4.0476190476190474
