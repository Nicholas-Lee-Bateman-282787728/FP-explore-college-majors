8118042,3,B000F6YVPY,"I found the information to be very informative on how to build flourescent lighting kits but the quality of Mr. Andrewski's video I would have to rate as a ZERO.  The author charges WAY too much for this amateur attempt at this do-it-youreslf video.  I was however able to build one of the simpler lighting kits with a little difficulty with the sheet metal but after the enclosure was done, it was relatively easy.  If the author is reading this he might want to modify the price of this video down to the sub $10 range.",1172880000,4,521,4.40625
8118043,1,B000F6YVPY,"To start, a video on lighting gear should have good lighting...  this does not.  It looks like bad 1990 community access video.

The information is terrible, and while the presenter keep talking about getting more information later in the video or on the web site... neither has the information.  I expected a detailed parts list, plans for the light boxes, etc. You get none of that with this video.

Stay away, you can get better information off a google search.",1171324800,6,464,4.75
8118044,5,B000F6YVPY,"If there is one thing that separates an amateur movie from a professional movie, it's the lighting.  Richard Andrewski's Cool Lights: DIY Fluorescent Video Lighting Vol. 1 gives you step by step instructions on how to build your own pro lights on a budget.  Buy this dvd and get control of what your movie looks like.",1157414400,,317,4.642857142857143
8118045,5,B000F6YVPY,"This is a great video for learning how to build your own very cool lights for video with materials available at your local hardware store. Not only are they useful, but but most of my video biography clients will never know I didn't spend hundreds (or even thousands) of dollars on the lights I now use, because they look very much like the lights the pros use. I am also not frying the wonderful older folks I shoot who have in the past complained about hot lights. GREAT job!",1153440000,2,477,4.370786516853933
8118046,5,B000F6YVPY,"This is an excellent tutorial on building great looking, cost effective fluorescent lights for your video projects.  I couldn't recommend it more highly.",1149984000,,153,5.6521739130434785
8118047,5,B000F6YVPY,"Richard Andrewski has made the DVD entitled -- Cool Lights: DIY Fluorescent Video Lighting Vol. 1. He also makes versions of his lights for use on video and film production. Movie lights are a specialty item made specifically for the motion picture industry and thus are typically pricy. So, to invent a series of lights that are useful and not expensive is very helpful indeed. With the Apple iPod video and video on Apple iTunes, and with iChat AV videoconferencing now built right in to the new Apple iMac as well -- affordable, simple lighting gear is going to be very useful in the years ahead. Richard Andrewski has figured it all out. His lighting set-ups are ingenious, often with off-the-shelf items from Home Depot like low watt fluorescent light bulbs and work-type light stands that he uses now for film and video lighting. Amazing. Affordable. Simple. The lights work very well. JOHN LONGENECKER, DGA - Hollywood, California USA - JLVideoUSA.com - sell also: CoolLightsUSA.com",1143849600,,989,5.0
