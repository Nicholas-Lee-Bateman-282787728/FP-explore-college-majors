7817050,4,6301928962,"One reviewer I read on the internet suggested a re-make for this 1987 film by director and co-writer Damiano Damiani and, if one looks a little more, his wish may have been granted by something called ""The Final Inquiry.""  Of course, the genius idea by Damiani and co-screenwriter Vittorio Bonicelli is revamped.  ""The Inquiry"" (""L'Inchiesta"") was produced by Fulvio Lucisano and it is clear Damiani did not have a spectacular budget, but it does  not make his ""The Inquiry"" any less interesting and able to suspend disbelief.  The Italian production was filmed in English and stars Keith Carradine, Harvey Keitel (as ""Pontius Pilate"" just before he took on the role of ""Judas Iscariot"" for Scorcese's ""Last Temptation"") and Phyllis Logan.  Keitel does not seem to have his heart in it at times, but Logan is exceptional and Carradine also is pretty good. IIF Home Video's DVD presentation for Italy does not have an English version listed on its menu, but one can access an English Dolby track using the ""Audio"" button on the remote, however, for one scene it switches to Italian and then switches back and repeated tries to get this scene to play in English were futile.  Recently I bought a PAL Blu-ray/DVD Combo of a British Film Institute product (which some reviewers refer to as the British Criterion) and the film on the DVD ran off the sprockets during the transfer and it was left in.  Why does manufacturing other than USA ask us to accept slipshod manufacturing?  The film is not ever irreverent and this important credit can be attested to Riz Ortolani's music score which never becomes syrupy, but begins to sound to call up majesty but never quite goes there.  The film's grasp of the English language is masterful and quite eloquent and intelligent.  One changed aspect of ""The Final Inquiry"" and a note on ""The Inquiry""'s objectivity making for a more credible story is that in the newer film, Jesus is seen through flashback.  Damiani's ""The Inquiry"" makes a point as there is a person by person search for Jesus through the eyes of an eyewitness, but augmenting Mary Magdalene's account via the Gospels that she did not recognize the risen Christ at first.  The film is quite flawed, mostly in some lapses in continuity.  The film's ending is a bit uninspired, but the final masterful lines of dialogue carry it through as you begin to continue to think about what you have just seen.  And seeing it again.

7817052,4,6301928962,"I only watched late at night but for some reason I would only catch the last part but when finally I saw it from beginning to end I was truly suprised and fascinated because this is another part of christianity that nobody talked about What if someone was trying to destroy Christ's last actions by telling everyone it was a fraud? While it seems strange and kind of unnerving to see it from the evil side point of view you also find astounding on how he fails completely.

So add it to your collection it is worht it.",1258675200,2,518,4.285714285714286
7817053,3,6301928962,"The idea of an official Roman investigation into the theft of Jesus' body is a stroke of genius, but the filmmakers flubbed their premise with a boring almost-romance between Taurus and Mrs. Pilate, and a silly end act as Taurus goes undercover as a Jew to find Jesus.  Heartfelt but flawed film.",982108800,2,296,4.6923076923076925
