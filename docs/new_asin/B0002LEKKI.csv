8028793,5,B0002LEKKI,"All the Beginner's Bible series are probably closest to the Bible of all the quality videos. But that gives parents or teachers the opportunity to correct or expand the history for the children. The next best thing about these videos is that they appeal to a wide age range. They have enough nuances for the older children, and while using vocabulary simple enough for two year olds, they don't bore the older ones. Too bad they won't offer DVD format.",1375401600,,452,4.6625
8028794,5,B0002LEKKI,One of my son's favorite movies. Great how they make the story of Jonah so easy to understand for little ones. Love the songs too.,1299542400,,130,4.24

8028796,5,B0002LEKKI,"What a wonderful way for young children to learn about Jesus's miracles.  Some of the stories include Jesus turning water into wine, walking on water, healing the sick, and the resurrection.  This video is not only  informative, but the songs are adorable!  I even find myself singing along!",951004800,17,291,5.0
