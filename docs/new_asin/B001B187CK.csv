3478273,4,B001B187CK,"I ordered this for my uncle he Loves it,Loves it..... On the other hand; me I don't watch Katt Williams as much as I use too, but when I did watch I like too. He is a talented person that will keep you laughing he is very funny.",1265760000,,228,3.7708333333333335
3478274,5,B001B187CK,He may use some of the same lines as he has in other dvd's but he still makes me laugh no matter what he is in.,1247961600,,111,3.3076923076923075
3478275,5,B001B187CK,"Before I dropped dollars on this, I wish I had known Katt wasn't going to make any real appearance (perhaps I should have read more into ""presents"") but the three comics on here, well particularly Luenell and Melanie were so hilarious by the end I was ready to watch again and held my stomach the entire time.

Let me help you decide:  If you liked ""Queens of Comedy""--and if you like Monique-type humor--this is a must have and you'll find it hilarious beyond your expectations.  If you're looking for something more along the lines of ""Friday"" in a movie setting or if you're strung out for some more of the man Katt himself, keep moving.  But then come back and buy this DVD because it's like that.",1246492800,,701,4.496062992125984
3478276,3,B001B187CK,"I am a HUGE Katt Williams fan. I buy things because he is in it. I know all of the comedians on this DVD and have loved their works as well. But this was a little all over the place. A ""movie"" about the group of comedians traveling together doing shows. Was not long, thank goodness. But, just too corny. I was just disappointed.",1237420800,,329,4.15625
3478277,3,B001B187CK,"i expected more from Katt, but the word is that he's falling off.  That is, if he hadn't already....",1236902400,,100,4.2631578947368425
3478278,1,B001B187CK,"Maybe I misunderstood the title, but Katt Williams is no where on this dvd.  The 3 so called comedians on it STINK.",1235692800,,115,4.2272727272727275
3478279,3,B001B187CK,I was looking forward to seeing more Katt on this video. Not as funny as I thought it was going to be. Received very quickly. Will do business again.,1234396800,,149,4.172413793103448
3478280,2,B001B187CK,"The funniest moments were shown in American Hustle.  The video seemed rushed (like they shot it all in one night) and ill prepared, low budget.  Only for true Red, Luenell and Melanie fans.",1232841600,,189,4.696969696969697

Thanks for expediting. This will be an wonderful addition to my collection.",1332720000,,145,5.083333333333333
8280984,4,B001B187CK,"Very funny stuff. If you are bored and want to watch something funny, buy this dvd and you will get plenty of laughs....",1328054400,,120,4.260869565217392
8280985,3,B001B187CK,I watched American Hustle: The movie and thought the comedians were funny that were traveling with Katt. So I bought this. It's more of a behind the scenes thing than anything. I was hoping to maybe see a whole set of each comedian. And my case was cracked and broken a little when I received it. But I still like it none the less.,1314921600,,331,4.1875
8280986,3,B001B187CK,"I bought this DVD primarily for the comedy of Melanie Comarcho.  She is hilarious and SO underrated!  I couldn't find anything with her on it, with the exception of a handful of YouTube clips.  (BTW, I recommend you checking out ""Independent Women"" on YouTube)

So, since I'm a huge Katt Williams fan, I thought I'd get this and see if it was any good.  It's good.  Not great.  Katt doesn't perform on it, and there are two other comedians besides Melanie.  The male comic was awful.  I tried to enjoy him but he just wasn't funny.  The blonde lady was good....I laughed out loud at her and of course the highlight was Melanie.

So, overall I'd say add it to your collection if you're a huge comedy fan.  Otherwise, you could do without.",1272931200,,737,4.458646616541353
