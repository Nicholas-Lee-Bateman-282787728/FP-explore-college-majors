7964843,3,B000068TR3,"An interesting low budget feature. Worth the watch. Directed by Darren Doane who made his name directing music videos. Michael Madsen adds a weird dimension. If you like low budget fun, then check out 42K.",1407456000,,205,4.885714285714286
7964844,1,B000068TR3,"This is one of the stupidest films I've ever seen. It makes no sense what-so-ever.

The hot chicks seen briefly at the beginning of the film are quickly shuffled off to a closet for 'safety' as the 'dudes' battle vampires that are completely covered head-to-foot in gear that makes them look like IRA terrorists (including balaclavas), but these un-dead 'terrorists' carry machettes... They battle in a series of fights that made me thank that my DVD can fast fwd at 20x speed

You don't get to 'see' much of the girls.

42K must be the amount spent on this dud film",1100822400,,566,4.584158415841584
7964845,1,B000068TR3,"please PLEASE don't waste your time with this peice of garbage,i picked it up for 8.99 at media play and it wasn't worth a penny of that,the acting is something my friends and i could have done a better job with and the humor is slim to none,the only part i found remotely funny was a girl screaming curse words from a car...and thats pretty low brow humor. Theres nothing orignal or funny about this movie,another case where a movie definately should not be judged by its cover..",1074470400,,480,4.465909090909091
7964846,5,B000068TR3,"How did this film get made. I searched all over for it just to find myself hearing, ""We only had a few and they sold out."" I couldn't even find it in a video store, but record stores. My friends had it and would never loan it out. They would just keep talking about it like it was the New Holy Grail of independent films. Well, i got it now and it's worth the wait. This film is hilarious! Stupid, funny, smart, crazy, insane, charming, whatever! Filmmaker Darren Doane is just odd. His first feature, Godmoney, is one of the most depressing, intense films I have ever seen(very good though). And 42K, his follow up, is just the opposite. How does the same filmmaker make this movie? Well, you need to see it to believe it. Guys, Girls, Ninja's, Christians(which i understand Darren Doane is)Gangster rappers and Vampires. Plus musical numbers out of nowhere. This film took guts to make. After about 4 viewings i found things i never saw before. This film is the perfect flick when hanging out with friends. Never before has a film like this been made. Never.",976752000,2,1060,4.526041666666667
