2326586,4,B0009W5IMY,The first season remains my favorite. The fourth season is the least strong in terms of writing and story telling but still quite enjoyable. I find the plot on Lana being possessed by a witch distracting and annoying. Nontheless the show in a whole is very entertaining and this four season DVD set offers excellent value.,1129161600,,322,4.767857142857143
2326587,5,B0009W5IMY,"Since I'm much too lazy to attempt to review every season individually, I'm going to make a clumsy attempt to review the entire show at once.  I have recently become absolutely obsessed with this show.  For a long time, I just caught a stray episode here and there, and didn't really watch it religiously, but through the generous nature of a good friend, and the magic of DVD's, I was able to get ahold of and watch all of the first three seasons.  After that, the decision to buy this set was easy.

""Smallville"" is basically the next incarnation of the Superman mythology, but rather than just being another iteration of the same old thing, it manages to be a fresh and hip new spin on the concept.  It centers on Clark Kent growing up in Smallville, and discovering his super powers and origins, all while trying to lead a normal life as a teenager.  One of the best things about the show is how it brings so many more levels of emotional depth to the character.  This was the beauty of Spiderman, for example, that he was also a kid in addition to having these amazing powers, which made him more relatable and more real to a young audience, and Gough and Millar have successfully brought that same quality to Superman.  He's always been previously depicted as a nearly perfect character, and this is the first time we see him as a human with his own problems and inner conflicts, and I think that makes him that much more of an interesting and sympathetic character.  Plus, it's great to see more of his relationship with his parents, and how they helped to shape him into the man he'll one day be.

Also, what they've done with Lex Luthor on this show is just remarkable.  Rather than just having him as the quintessential super-villian, he starts out as a good guy, who befriends Clark, and becomes sort of a big brother/role model character for him.  However, we see from the start that evil runs deep in the family, with his tyrannical, crime-lord father Lionel.  Throughout the show, we see hints that Lex will eventually follow the same path, and that he's always trying to resist becoming his dad, even though we know that somehow he eventually will.  When you put this, and his friendship with Clark into context with what kind of person he eventually becomes, it adds so much more to the concept than just the simple ""Hero vs. Villian"" thing.  Also, Michael Rosenbaum is a remarkably talented young actor, who brings so many more dimensions to the character than ever before.

The show begins relatively simple, setting up for everything that will happen later on.  The basic idea that we have to begin with is that the kryptonite from the meteor shower has infected a large number of the townspeople, and given them super powers.  This provides Clark with a wide supply of foes to battle, to sharpen his skills as a superhero.  And once again, we have a human quality here, that we've never seen in any past incarnations of ""Superman"".  The villians are seemingly normal people, usually kids, with no costumes or anything.  It adds a greater sense of realism, and I really like that.

Gradually, with each season, the plotlines have gotten more complex, with Clark slowly learning more and more about his abilities, and where he comes from, eventually leading up to the more ""Superman""-like adventures we'll be seeing in season 5.  Each season has been better than the last, and everything is really falling into place nicely.  The pace of the show has been great, and the writers have done a great job of staying true to the mythology, while simultaneously taking it into new and interesting directions.

Technically speaking, the show is fantastic as well.  The actors all have great chemistry, and all bring something special to their characters.  Tom Welling is easily the best Superman since Christopher Reeve, so good in fact that I've almost forgotten how bad Dean Cain was.  It's also great to see veteran actors like John Schneider, John Glover, and Annette O'Toole in there with the younger actors, as well as guest appearances from past ""Superman"" stars, like Margot Kidder, Terence Stamp, and even Mr. Reeve himself.  There is also a great deal of subtlety and detail in the show, as far as lighting and camera angles (watch the commentary to get an idea), and the subtle use of color to create just the right atmospheres for the scene.  Also, the special effects are among the best I've seen on a television show.  These guys really put a great deal of time and effort into putting everything together.

I really can't say enough about this show.  Everything about it is just so wonderfully engaging, and masterfully executed.  Those who deride it and compare it to ""Dawson's Creek"" just because it's on the WB are being far too superficial, and aren't giving it nearly a fair enough chance.  ""Smallville"" is easily one of the best incarnations of Superman yet.",1128038400,45,4890,4.706227967097532
2326608,5,B0009W5IMY,"i will admit right off the bat that i underrated this show. if i could, i would give it 100 stars and five thumbs up, even though i have not yet finished watching the fourth season. but otherwise, this show is a great show!!! i enjoy it very much, and get addicted easily. basically, it is a story of the young clark kent before he became superman, although he does save many lives. many weird, strange things happen in this show, which will keep you on your toes. i get so involved, i feel like the kryptonite effects me as well as clark!!! i definitly love this show, and would recommend it to anyone. i cant wait until the next season comes out!!! don't think twice about purchasing this. it will be worth your while. if you cant afford to purchase this at such a high price, i found mine on ebay for half the price brand new!!!",1144713600,,831,4.265822784810126
2326609,5,B0009W5IMY,"I remember when this first came out, and I immediately dismissed it. Mainly because it was on the WB with a cadre of other teeny-bopper shows with a target audience that was born during or after the Reagan administration.  WOW, what a mistake that was.

A few friends of mine lent me the DVDs, it's a superb show, excellent acting, writing and character development.  It's nice to see actors from the other Superman franchises (Reeve, Stamp and Kidder) make guest appearances.

I also enjoyed a few throwback moments to the Dukes of Hazzard with John Schneider (Bo Duke / Jonathan Kent) and in a later episode with Tom Wompat (Luke Duke) guess starring as an old friend that comes barrelling in with a Dodge Charger...

X-Files fans may recognize the show's musical score.

So to anyone who dismissed this show, I strongly recommend taking a second look.",1142899200,,854,4.775510204081633
2326610,5,B0009W5IMY,"I had only watched a few episodes of Smallville before I decided to buy all 4 seasons of it. I know the legend of Superman. He was sent out from Krypton, the last of his race to be raised on Earth. Martha and Johnathan Kent found him, adopted him and raised him as their own son with their own Moral values. What the comic books don't tell us is what Clark (aka Superman) had to go through as he grew up. Smallville does that perfectly. Each season, Clark discovers new powers and new ways of hiding them from his Friends...Including Lex Luthor who we all know is Superman's Arch Enemy from the Comics. He also learns of his vulnerabilities (Green and Red Kryptonite) and that he can't save or stop everyone. Yes, sometimes it feels 90210ish but that did NOT stop me from watching each and every episode after I got the 4 season set. If you want to lose yourself in the World of Superman/boy for a few weeks, then yes, buy this set.",1142899200,,932,4.331428571428572
2326611,5,B0009W5IMY,"My sister and I never watched Smallville before recently, and we've fallen completely in love with this series. We bought the complete first four seasons and watched them all. It's a wonderful collection! We highly recommend it!!!",1142294400,,230,5.243243243243243
2326612,5,B0009W5IMY,"When i get the smallville four seasons package, i went to my tv and started to watch it. This serie is full of emotions, danger and action. I think you have to buy it.",1142208000,,167,3.9411764705882355
2326613,5,B0009W5IMY,"A definite must see for comic hero lovers. Smallville is not just focussed on the male audience but also include some characteristics of a soapie. What is great about Smallville is that events in the movie build up and progress through the programs and seasons. I can not wait for Season 5 and eventually, the metamorphis into Superman.",1141689600,,336,4.810344827586207
2326614,5,B0009W5IMY,"At 50 years old, I'm probably one of the older fans of Smallville and I just love it!  But I also have the somewhat unique experience of having read DC Comics -- Superman, Superboy, Legion of Super Heros, etc. -- on a regular basis as a kid.  What impresses me about Smallville, as much as all the other outstanding qualities of the show such as those very well stated in some of the other reviews, is how true the show is to the original comic book story, so much more so than any previous incarnation of the story of Superman, whether it's the orignal TV series starring George Reeves or the series of movies starring Christopher Reeve.  I'm sure that most of Smallville's younger fans don't even realize that they're ""getting an education"" on the real ""story of Superman"" as first read in DC Comics decades ago.

Smallville is extremely well done by any measure and is truly a class act.  I'm delighted to be able to own the first four seasons in one collection.",1140998400,2,965,4.491428571428571
2326615,5,B0009W5IMY,"I have reviewed each of the four season sets individually, so you may read my specific comments and criticisms.  But, overall, as a 4 box set, this is a great collection for new and old SMALLVILLE fans...of all ages (well, it def should get a PG rating).

The special features are pretty much negligible, aside from some interesting commentary tracks.  But the deleted scenes prove that they were justifiably cut and the ""Chloe Chronicles"" are downright awful.

This is a great set to own just for the episodes...the way you would want to own a complete collection of comic books.  Not every issue is as valuable as another, but you wouldn't want to have an incomplete set!",1139788800,4,673,4.717948717948718
2326616,5,B0009W5IMY,"This is the best show on the WB for sure. All the season premieres and finales are amazing. Admittedly it is flawed such as how they ""solve"" the mystery of how the Freak of the week got his powers. But that is completely unimportant. First of all the character's relationships are done extremely well. You understand why Clark decides to be good rather than evil because of his parents. You see how they help him and he doesnt abuse his powers. Season 3 is the best for sure. Seasons 2 and 4 are tied at second. An last is season 1. It's not a bad season its actually VERY good. HOwever the ""freak of the week"" format gets a bit repeatitive ( well if you finish season 1 in 4 days like me). The frist four episodes transit really well. The show flows and you just don't want it to end. The season finale ""Tempest"" was unbelievable. And the followup ""Vortex"" and ""Duplicity"" made season 2's begining connect really well to season 1. It only gets better. Some of the episodes are COMPLETELY RANDOM and a FEW are bad. But over 95% are mind boggling. A must buy for anyone who likes Superman or good action/fantasy show. I hated superman the movie and the cartoon. However i LOVE smallville and i look at superman with a new perspective. It is masterfully done. 5 stars w.o a doubt. I recomend you you watch like 2-3 episodes so you get an idea. You either love it or hate it. Hope this review helped.",1132617600,,1397,4.35632183908046
2326617,5,B0009W5IMY,"I never saw a more appealing TV show !!!

everything from cast to plot to setting , etc ... all is excellent .

if I could I would have given it 10 stars instead of 5 :)

the only thing though .... Is ... that .... I wish they could make the season 50 episodes or more , or maybe make more than one season per year ....

It's addicting , once you get caught with the events .",1131667200,2,375,3.7088607594936707
8067928,5,B0009W5IMY,Great show!,1433980800,,11,5.0
8067929,4,B0009W5IMY,The product arrived through the promised shipping method and as promised. It was very useful for the purpose I got it for.,1375660800,,122,4.590909090909091
8067930,2,B0009W5IMY,"I love Smallville; I knew very little about Superman from comics or movies, so I don't have much of a base of comparison, but I love this show! I've seen maybe half of season 5 and none of season 6, but everything up to that point was riveting and clever, in my opinion. Michael Rosenbaum is fabulous as Lex, Kristen Kreuk is hot and vulnerable and sweet as Lana, and Erica Durance brought in some great new ""blood"" and personality as Lois.

Why then, do you ask, did I give it only 2 stars? Because this set of the first four seasons is grossly overpriced when compared to buying the seasons individually. At the time of this writing, the first 5 seasons are all available for less than $25 each, and this set is $165!",1189382400,,719,4.325925925925926
8067931,5,B0009W5IMY,If you wanna catch up on smallville from the begining this is the best way to do it. Also good as a Gift,1182816000,,104,3.5652173913043477
8067932,4,B0009W5IMY,"I know everyone's jumping on the bandwagon with how great this show is. Not alot of critique. Hmmm...maybe because of pretty boy Tom and princess Lana. This show could be so much better. It has its good episodes but in only half of all 4 seasons!! This is more like me pleading than me scorning. Come on, quit the 'I luv Lana,' 'I need Lana in my life' crap and get to some action, drama, thriller type Pre-Superman brawling. Even at the end of the sixth season he doesn't learn to fly. Why is it that the only time Clarke flies is when he is taken over by Jor-El, when he wears that retarded red ring or when he is cloned by that stupid phantom (season six)??? Enough with Lana. I wanted her to stay dead instead of Clark's dad. She's annoying and holding Clarke back from really moving on. Cloey's my choice. Clark never has a good fight. They should stage him in some good fist throwing action with some alien brawlers. It's simple...I WANNA SEE SOME ACTION!!!",1179878400,,963,4.385474860335195
8067933,4,B0009W5IMY,"The first 3 seasons are more like Buffy with super heroes and as the seasons go on it basically just turns into...Dawson's Creek with super heroes. I mean the show was really good with a smart cast. Michael Rosenbaum is a brilliant Lex Luther and actually likeable. Then in season 5 they just turnt him into someone Clark can't trust 100% but no he doesn't use his money to find out Clark's secret. He uses it to...get Lana. When Clark and Lana finally get together he just becomes the jealous bestfriend. Yes he basically goes from being Lex Luther to...Pacey in Dawson's Creek. Lana was likeable and cute in the first 3 seasons. Then the writers just used her way way too much. Plus they aren't even original. There's like 100's of episodes where she gets knocked out the second Clark enters the room to save the day. Plus actually putting her with Lex where now she's mean to Clark every time she sees him just turns me off. I mean if she they wanted us to worship her as much as they do. The writers shouldn't have made her such an ungrateful.... . I mean half the times she even knew Clark saved her!

  One of the best things about the show is Allison Mack as Chloe. Who basically transformed from a friend who had a big crush on Clark, to a strong allie. She has cute scenes with Clark and doesn't make wanna yelll ""NO!!"" the second she approaches Clark or vice versa like Lana does to me. Yet just like the likeable Jonathan Kent, when they have to kill someone else off, they'll unwisely not kill Lana and kill Chloe! Yes us Smallville fans see that coming a mile a way. John Glover is just awesome as Lionel Luther and transformed from one of the most evil and untrustworthy guys in the into a guy Clark can trust.

  That's not that bad though since it's kinda refreshing seeing him working with Clark. The Dawson's Creek part of what they turned him into sucks though. I mean now he's the potential new love interest for Martha Kent as well ""rolls eyes"". Which is proof of how bad the show got after Jonathan Kent died. I mean they turnt the most sneaky guys on the show into simply just guys who will use their money and power to...get women. Now the latest rumor is that Lana might actually be pregnant with Lex's baby. Way to kill the show guys! The Lana and Lex scenes make me itchy already as it is.

  The first 4 seasons are more like Superboy without Clark actually being Superboy. He saves the day with his powers and battled a new villian of the week. I knocked Clark always fighting metia freaks. But give me metia freaks over the Lana and Lex relationship any day! It was just a good a show. I loved Clark realizing he can shoot lazers out of his eyes and Jonathan Kent tecahing him to control it. I loved Clark getting red kryptonite and being a jerk.

  The show really needs to have another red k episode. I'd love to see him toss Lex around more and tell off Lana the way she deserves to be told off. I also liked the character Pete who was Clark's bestfriend who found out Clark had powers. He was a cool character but the show only knows how to use Lana and had no clue what to do with him after season 3! Then they introduced the super cute Erica Durance in season 4 as Lois Lane. Some people actually say she is annoying but she's refreshing and I'd rather see the writer's learn how to use her. It's also cool seeing super heroes guest star or super villians. The show uses super heroes way better than it uses super villians though. I mean we got Zod who was awesome in Superman 2. Of course the show just had him go in Lex instead of making it as cool as they could've. The show also had the great James Marsters ""Spike in Buffy"" as Dr. Fine/Brainiac but all his fight scenes with Clark were cut short just to make room for Dawon's Creek drama. That's how the show is basically, short fight scenes and extra drama. It's decent but just not what it used to be or what it could've become.",1160870400,,3921,4.29810298102981
8067934,1,B0009W5IMY,"This ridiculous TV show series is only interesting if you are 13 and 11.  My two oldest kids are-and they have had hours of fun with this series this summer.  Second only to ""Gilmore Girls"", this TV series in a box is a must-have for summer sleepovers for the late tweenager and early teenager.  Avoid watching too much if you are over this age group.

8067935,5,B0009W5IMY,I have just recently been invited to the superman mythology and I think this TV show Smallville is one of its best stories. The cast are superb in this show. From the first episode I was hooked I wanted to watch more so I bought all four seasons on dvd in one day and I have watched 2 seasons of it so far in just 3 days its so addictive. I now really understand the man behind superman before he was even superman. Each year the show had been maturing and that is what I liked about it. I just can not stop watching the show. But now I have a show to watch now that charmed is over. But this show is much more then buffy and charmed I suprised even myself for liking this show. Buy these first four season it is worth your supernatural adventures.,1153180800,,748,4.0608108108108105
8067936,2,B0009W5IMY,"It's been four years and poor teenager Clark Kent still can't accept the person he is suppose to become. It's pretty obvious when you are found near a spaceship in a cornfield after a meteor shower that you aren't from anywhere known to man. Taken in by a farmer and his wife, Ka-El is given the identity of Clark Kent, adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent. His life is easy going for awhile until a young Lex Luthor hits teenage Clark with his car taking both of them off a bridge. Performing a daring rescue is Clark's undoing. Lex becomes both indebted and curious to the happenings of how Clark was able to save his life. From then on the series unwines. Strange things occur which revolve around remaining meteor rocks left in Smallville, criminal activity arises, teenagers' and adults' lives like always, suck; espcially in their love lives, and very slowly does Clark's true destiny arise. The show is so slow and there is so much talking about how life is, the viewer soon realizes that this show is not really about Superman. The series is about a boy with a growing number of special powers and a future he is not willing to accept, no matter how much good he will do in the end. It takes two years to finally put Clark and Lana together, but they are later torn apart by Clark's disobedience to his father Jar-El. Clark eventually repairs the damage between his loved ones, but no matter how hard he tries, Lex and himself will never be the same. It takes over three years for Lex and Clark to finally quit being friends and to fall into conflicts with how they think the world should work. The show at least does follow some Superman storylines. Clark gains x-ray vision, heat vision, super speed, super hearing, super strength, flying abilities, a young Louis Lane appears, Perry White makes a stop in Smallville, so does the Flash, Krypto causes some havic, and Clark is only vulnrable to Kryptonite rocks. The episodes dealing with these Superman traits are the interesting ones because they are fun to see how they arise and how Clark learns to deal with them. But then there's the continuous and extremely repetitive teenage and adult life drama. How much school sucks because one isn't normal, disfunctional families, and disfunctional personal relationships. The show has two more seasons in the works, so I don't see the story telling changing much. The season premieres and finales tend to be the ones dealing with Superman traits, but even some of these episodes are extremely slow and only deals with a small amount of turning Clark into Superman. So all I have left to say is, where oh where is The Man Of Steel?",1149897600,,2636,4.646680942184155

If you're looking for a gift for someone who likes Superman, this series tends to appeal to the teen-30-something range.  The newer seasons would appeal to the comic fans since we see more of Superman's fellow superheros show up (Yay Aquaman!).",1147305600,,404,4.583333333333333
