8449041,1,B004YXDGEG,"The current Mayan calendar round ends in 2012, and is supposed to bring on some disaster or other.  Big deal.

The previous Mayan calendar round ended in 3014 BCE, with the appropriate disaster,  and the calendar round before that ended about 5000 years earlier -- again with a great disaster.  Except for the current calendar round, the Mayans were of course making it all up.

The most compelling proof is that there was NO DISASTER in 3014 BCE (or anywhere near that date).  Records of the Chinese, Mesopotamian, and Egyptian civilizations are empty of any sort of great disaster in the 31st Century BCE.

Give it a break, guys.  There is no proof of the silly 2012  claims.  Come January 2013, I will be laughing it up at your stupidity.",1306108800,2,741,4.630769230769231
