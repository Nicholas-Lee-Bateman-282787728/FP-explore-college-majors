5013439,4,B006QFCZ10,"I bought this DVD as a supplement to my classes because I am horrible at coming up with my own drills/routines for practicing at home.  Overall this is an excellent instructional dvd, the set is clean and there are no background distractions. Felix's instructions are very good, her explanations are clear and I think she gives enough detail without being overly technical or wordy . Her teaching personality is soothing, and the camera is usually focused where it should be in order for you to see what she is doing so that you can imitate her movements.  The background music is soothing and not distracting, and while it's not my first choice for dance music, I found really like it for practicing techniques.  There is also quite a good variety of techniques shown, and you get to view them several times.

The only real problem I have with this dvd is that she uses a lot of split grips without showing sturdier grips that are easier for beginners to use.  This is not a great thing for most beginners, who generally do not have the necessary upper body strength for this, particularly in the wrists and forearms.  I would have expected a beginner dvd to show sturdier grips for those who are just starting out, or even both types of grip so that they can start to build the upper body strength without so much frustration.  I know from taking many classes that there are a lot of people who will want to give up on this because they are going to either have a lot of pain from this or they will simply be unable to the moves at all.  Calling this a beginner DVD and then starting out with split grips and not teaching wrist safety and alternative grips is nothing short of irresponsible.

I was also very surprised to see a pole split shown as a beginner move since most beginners won't have anywhere near the flexibility necessary to do the move, however it does give you something to work towards and is a lovely move.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone who has taken at least a few beginner classes, as you will have learned how to modify some of the grips to make things easier when starting out.  If you have no classes available in your area, this still is a very good buy, but I would recommend watching some videos you can find for free online so that you can see other ways of gripping the pole that will help you.",1382745600,12,2332,4.425233644859813
5013440,4,B006QFCZ10,"I must admit I love the warm up and stretches in the beginning, to get you started.

I wish she would have showed the moves a few more times, in slow motion, but other than that, this was a great basic dvd.",1382054400,,206,3.9047619047619047
5013441,1,B006QFCZ10,I only received a case with no DVD. I plan on reordering. I'm assuming this was an honest mistake due to the other positive reviews.,1381276800,,132,4.32
5013442,5,B006QFCZ10,A really long warm up but the basics are great. She shows great beginner moves and how to gain strength for the more difficult moves down the line.,1369440000,,147,4.285714285714286
5013443,5,B006QFCZ10,"I started pole dancing when I lived in a city. After my recent pregnancy I wanted to start back up again, but found the pole classes in the area to be lacking. I have my own pole, so I decided to get some videos and work out from home.

I just got this in the mail today and I'm already able to give it 5 stars with confidence. The warm up incorporates lots of really great stretches, dance moves, and strength building exercises. The pole instruction portion of the video is fantastic as well.

This really is the perfect thing for a beginner. The first move demonstrated is more of a pose. It's easy, but is still beautiful and fun to do. Every move demonstrated is slightly more difficult than the last. It gives lots of baby steps for those who aren't yet comfortable with the pole, or strong enough to support their full weight. She makes even the most simple move look so beautiful that you're able to embrace what you can do and inspired to keep trying what you can't.

The DVD finishes up with a dance routine. It goes pretty fast, and I can't do all the moves yet, but it's fun and gives me something to work towards.

My only complaint would be the lack of verbal cues during the warm up. She switches moves silently and if you're in a position where it is difficult to see the TV you might miss it. This is a pretty small thing though and probably won't be a problem when I've done the DVD a few times.",1364256000,25,1413,4.241635687732342
5013444,4,B006QFCZ10,Highly recommend this instruction video. I'll be dancing like a pro in no time. Can't believe what a workout pole dancing is. Love it!,1351728000,,134,4.625
5013445,4,B006QFCZ10,"This is a great DVD if you are looking to learn some sexy moves that are absolutely stunning. However, my two biggest issues with this DVD are: 1. A few times on the DVD, the camera cuts out the dancer feet and hands so I couldn't see how she is placing her feet for the moves; 2. This is the DVD for beginners, and the dancer only shows one side ( I called it the ""right side"" moves. ), so for someone like me with ""2 left feet"" is very confusing to do the other side on my own without the instructions.

p.s. I have no idea why the DVD arrived without the shrink wrap?",1328659200,9,570,3.9565217391304346
8503018,5,B006QFCZ10,Great video for beginners,1447545600,,25,5.5
8503019,5,B006QFCZ10,This is a great CD. She demonstrates the positions slow so that you can actually learn them correctly.,1439510400,,102,4.722222222222222
8503020,1,B006QFCZ10,"This is hands down the worst workout dvd I have ever had the misfortune to purchase. The entire warmup she doesn't say a word, so you have to constantly keep your eyes on the tv so you don't miss anything. Half of the warmup I had no clue what she was even doing. Then I got to the poses, which as a plus she actually tells you how to do them. However, she only does them on one side so you have to do the other side on your own. I only got to the second pose when I gave up. You needed to twist your hand in a way that unless you're very flexible you can't do. Most of these moves are for the very flexible, and this dvd is not for beginners at all!",1424390400,4,650,3.786764705882353
8503021,5,B006QFCZ10,love it!!!! cant wait to buy the other ones,1423094400,,43,3.888888888888889
8503022,1,B006QFCZ10,stupid DVD. it is not for beginners,1407369600,2,35,4.142857142857143
8503023,4,B006QFCZ10,Nice tape,1406160000,,9,4.0
8503024,1,B006QFCZ10,Not very helpful... Far too short and useless. Instruction was detailed when unnecessary and not when necessary. There aren't very many pole tricks at all. I regret this order. Couldn't believe this cost money.,1396310400,,210,5.205882352941177
8503025,5,B006QFCZ10,Everything in this video was explained beautifully. Just love it and would definitely recommend it if you were starting out on the pole.,1394755200,,136,4.956521739130435
8503026,5,B006QFCZ10,I liked the way Felix broke down the fundamentals to pole dancing. She's very talented. This has helped me a lot.,1384300800,,113,4.428571428571429
8503027,4,B006QFCZ10,This DVD was very helpful takes alot if practice and shows the moves like 3 brief times then on to the next so i have to press pause after each move just to get my practice in .... My only thumbs down is with the shipping company before you order they .tell u a certain time.frame that it will be delivered and after u purchase the dates change dramatically my DVD came a day after the latest day. Today i ordered the intermediate dvd first it said delivery would be between today and 11/15 after press submit the dates changed to between 11/20-12/06 which i think is ENTIRELY TOO LONG definitely one of the slowest,1384300800,2,615,4.356521739130435
