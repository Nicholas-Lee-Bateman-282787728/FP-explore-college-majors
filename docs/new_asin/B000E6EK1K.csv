It is also great because it's not boring - every time you put it in you get a different workout. The moves are easy - and they work!",1144195200,4,334,3.742857142857143
2500004,4,B000E6EK1K,"I just received the DVD yesterday and it seems to be pretty effective.  I have her Strength and Grace and Fat Eliminator and like to mix those in with my workouts, however don't find them difficult enough to do on a standalone basis.  This workout doesn't do cardio but definitely hits all muscle groups! I am sore today just from doing it once yesterday and I work out every day.

My only complaint is that no matter what amount of time I set it for, it just keeps on going, I set it for 36 yesterday and it went FOREVER, I finally stopped.  Today I set it for 24 and counted them and got to at least 34.

A good investment.",1144108800,,625,4.132231404958677
2500005,5,B000E6EK1K,"I've been a loyal fan of Minna's for about a year.  Her workouts are not only enjoyable, but provide results.  This new workout provides all of her great knowledge of staying fit plus a few new moves I haven't seen before.  Stick with her workouts, you will get the results you want.  I think the most enjoyable thing about her workouts though is Minna herself.  Of course she has a perfect body, but she's quite pleasant and seems like someone we'd all want to be friends with.",1143763200,5,478,4.448275862068965
2500006,4,B000E6EK1K,"You wouldn't think you'd get much benefit from a dvd like this, but let me tell you that you will burn calories.  It stays fresh and interesting because you can do the routine in any order and for any desired length of time.  There are 127 different one-minute segments each focusing on different body parts and you can control the order you do it in.  This way you won't get bored and you'll be inclined to do this often.  Minna is a good instructor and with her help, you can get through this easily and have fun at the same time.  I recommend this if you are someone who bores easily with the usual exercise grind.",1143676800,18,617,4.2844827586206895
2500007,4,B000E6EK1K,"I've also been enjoying this workout as a great add-on to my cardio routines!

While this DVD has tremendous variety, I did not rate it higher because an exercise may repeat itself, since the order that an exercise may appear is random.  When this happens, you will need to press the skip button on your remote, and another exercise will be chosen, instead.

Otherwise, it's nice to not know what the next exercise will be, as this keeps the workout fresh each time you do it!  On the downside to this, you may be standing one moment, and have to go down to the floor the next for the upcoming exercise, but this hasn't happened so much that it's become bothersome for me.

Minna is wonderful, and even some of the exercises are ones I haven't seen before (which is great!)  Very glad to have made this purchase and I will use this DVD often!  Look forward to perhaps an advanced version of this!",1143590400,6,896,4.426829268292683
2500079,5,B000E6EK1K,"Do as short a session or as long a session as you want. Pick your exertion level. At only a minute an exercise with randomly selected segments, it's not boring. Great for someone who has done mostly walking and/or yoga--some strength and balance training that also gets the heart pumping. Also like the instructor--she's upbeat and cheerful, not too sweet and not a drill sergeant. Highly recommend for someone just getting into toning/shaping up exercise.",1419984000,,456,5.093333333333334
2500080,5,B000E6EK1K,I don't usually use videos as a means of exercise. I've been an avid marathon runner for several years. I was Injured and so I looked for a video to do at home. Plus I know that keeping my body tone is important. This video is outstanding ! I like that it has many options and that you can tailor your work outs. I've only been using it for a week and I'm sore. I'm getting a good workout!,1419897600,,389,3.9367088607594938

2500082,4,B000E6EK1K,This is one of my favorite exercise tapes.  I get bored with the rest of them.  I do need to get some heavier weights though.  It can feel like too little of a workout if the weights are too light.,1416441600,,197,3.875

2500085,1,B000E6EK1K,Ok so if you need a super slow workout this is for you. The time that it takes to go from exercise to exercise is to long and you loose your momentum. We wanted to do a long AB workout so we picked the longest time and started the workout. Although there is a lot of exercises overall there isn't a ton of AB workouts. When it randomized the AB workout it kept repeating the same exercise 3 and 4 times. That was just boring and on top of being slow  it just wasn't  worth it. We just need something that  keeps our heart rate up and actually makes us break a sweat this isn't that type of workout.,1409961600,,598,4.008403361344538
2500086,3,B000E6EK1K,"I was disappointed in this DVD. I was expecting to get a customizable workout. Each workout really is approx. 1 minute, so if you choose, lets say, 8 minutes of upper body - it gives you 8 one minute segments. It's very disjointed. Why can't I just work out continuosly for 8 minutes instead of having to pause between every one minute set?! You cannot chose multiple body parts to work at the same time either. You have to choose, either upper body, abs, lower body, or total body. So I had to keep going back to the menu to add additional workouts. I did the warm up - it was about 2-3 minutes, about 35 minutes of workout routines (which got really mundane waiting for 35 different 1 minute exercises to pop up and having to go back to the menu for each body part) and then a cool down which is about 3 minutes. Some of the 1 minute routines did get duplicated as well. It didn't flow for me and the moves are not terribly difficult, so it bored me. I don't really know if the workouts are 1 true minute either - they seemed alot shorter with her talking & demonstrating each 1 minute move.",1408406400,,1093,4.23444976076555
2500087,4,B000E6EK1K,"This is a wonderful DVD! You can focus on either one area of your body or do a total body workout. The different areas that you can work are upper body, lower body, and abs. The total body option will take sections from each of those areas to create a full body workout. Workouts can range from 2 minutes to 72 minutes, depending on which section you choose. There are also warm up and cool down options available. The warm ups and cool downs are okay, but I tend to prefer my own. They are just really boring and the cool down doesn't have enough stretching in it for me. Also, the workouts aren't predetermined, they are randomly chosen from a bank of exercises, each about 1 minute long. This sometimes results in the ""total body workout"" becoming a workout more akin to a specific area. Still, this is a nice DVD and I have gained quite a bit of muscle from this DVD.",1407110400,,871,4.317073170731708

2500121,4,B000E6EK1K,"I like the ability to modify the workout. I use this tape on my lighter workout days as the one minute format doesn't really allow you to get a great burn going. I use Jari Love on my harder workout days. I also wish it would not repeat an exercise in a single session. Often in a longer workout, one or more of an exercise will come up twice. With so many to draw from, it should be made so you never do the same one twice per session. But overall it is a very good DVD.",1394928000,,471,3.865979381443299

2500125,2,B000E6EK1K,"I really wanted to like this exercise video and based on all the 4 and 5 star reviews, I thought I found a winner.  I think it is a great concept and I like the 1 minute focus on a specific exercise.  The problem I had was receiving the same exercise combinations repeatedly.  It didn't matter if I picked the total body or upper/lower/abs sections or number of minutes I selected.  Same exercises over and over...where was the ""limitless combinations""?  Another problem was that some exercises required you to stand and the next one down on the floor.  Being overweight, it was difficult for me to get up/down quickly before the next exercise began.  It would have been a nice option if all the floor exercises could have been lumped together and same for the ones standing.  Maybe you get more variety at level 2, but level 1 was a continual repeat of very few choices.",1380153600,2,871,4.538461538461538
2500126,5,B000E6EK1K,"Really liking the variety this workout DVD provides; even if you don't change your parameters you won't end up with the same workout twice in a row. As a beginner, the lower intensity workouts are easy enough to follow while still being challenging.  I'd prefer that the warm-up/cool-down segments were automatically included in the workout, but it's not much hassle to select them manually. Customers should be aware that light/heavy hand weights are routinely used in exercises.",1373155200,,480,5.233766233766234
2500127,5,B000E6EK1K,"First, you should know that I don't really like to exercise, and I've never done so consistently. I've especially hated video workouts. But this one is different. I LOVE IT! It is very do-able, enjoyable, and challenging. You get to set the amount of time you have to do it, instead of having to commit to a 30+ minute workout. Minna is great - not intimidating or condescending, but encouraging and straight-forward. This workout is free of frills and is just a straight-forward, easy to follow workout. The music isn't annoying, Minna isn't annoying, I love just about everything about it.

The ONLY thing I don't like is sometimes segments will repeat in the course of a workout. The customizing technology isn't perfect. But other than that, this is a great one, especially if you're a busy mom and need to workout according to what time you have available each day.

I've been doing it 3-5 times a week for 5 weeks plus a 1600 cal per day diet and I've lost 7 lbs and 1-2 inches throughout my body. I'd call that success!",1365206400,3,1026,4.570652173913044
2500128,5,B000E6EK1K,"Why don't they make more workout dvd's this way! Good for those starting out and added weight allows for long continued use.  My 73 year old mother even can follow this one. I can choose how long to workout, choose what body part to concentrate on if desired, and the routines are simple to follow.  No spending precisous workout time to learn the workout.  The fact that this dvd is difficult to find and holds it's resale value says it:  people keep this dvd.  The only down side I can see is it is low on cardio, but there are so many other workouts out there incorporating cardios that it isn't a problem.  Great addition for those who enjoy walking for their cardio.",1344297600,,671,4.414634146341464
2500159,3,B000E6EK1K,"The positives:
A virtually unlimited amount of exercises, each day a different routine.  At the beginning, you can choose the number of minutes you want to exercise, with a focus on upper body, lower body, abs, or total, and lower intensity or higher intensity. Each exercise segment is about a minute long, then the DVD skips to another exercise segment.  They flow together very well, with about a 7-second pause between each exercise.  The toning exercises range from basic bicep curls to much more diffuclt plank walking to push-ups.  If you have 2 sets of dumbbells, you can really make an impact on your muscles.

There is a separate warm-up (3 different routines, the DVD picks one for you) and cool down (also 3 routines, the DVD chooses).  There's also a ""fast-track"" workout.

The negatives:
Many videos have models for lower-intensity and higher-intensity versions of the same exercise, but not here.  It would be nice if she could explain how to modify the exercises for beginners.  On some of the lower-intensity upper body exercises I simply couldn't do what she wanted, and there's no way to block the DVD from picking that exercise for you again and again.

Lack of music.  Obviously with the DVD changing segments every minute, it would be very difficult to block a soundtrack for it.  If, at the beginning of each exercise, it captioned the name of the exercise, you would at least know what you are going to do and you could put on your own music and turn the sound off completely.  Unfortunately there are no exercise captions, so you don't know what you are going to do until she starts doing it.",1336262400,3,1617,4.732142857142857
2500160,5,B000E6EK1K,"This is the first time I've enjoyed a work-out video. Minna Lessig's 1 Minute Work-out is fun, interesting and allows you to choose the level of challenge you feel you're ready for.  She is pleasant to listen to and the format has kept me interested and motivated.",1285891200,,264,4.617021276595745
2500161,4,B000E6EK1K,"Minna Lessig knows how to effectively work the muscles. (And I appreciate her toned-down look in this one, I find it much more appealing.) I also have Quick Fix, a series of 10 minute workouts, also very effective.",1278806400,,214,4.657894736842105
2500162,5,B000E6EK1K,"I like the idea of this video, although sometimes it seems a little bit slow.  I LOVE that you can target parts of your body and choose how long you want to work out.  A definite plus for someone with so little extra time.  I use it every day, and it keeps me guessing which is good because I get bored easily.",1267574400,,310,3.967741935483871
2500163,4,B000E6EK1K,"I really do like this workout DVD.  Minna Lessig is among my favorite instructors, but this is really the only DVD of hers that I seem to click with.

I like the fact that it's programmable, you can set it to what you feel like doing that day, how long, how difficult, etc.  Some days I will just do upper body or lower body, do both separately on the same day, or just choose a total body workout.  It's very versatile as far as the exercises plus the amount of time you set it for.  Sometimes I feel like going all out and doing 40 minutes of upper body work as opposed to the normal 20 or 25 minutes.

But, I tend to agree with other reviewers, there can be too many repeats of exercises, or I sometimes get too many chest exercises (mainly pushups) and not enough back or tricep exercises.  This morning I set it for 20 minutes of upper body and got 3 sets of pushups.  Sure I could use extra pushups but there are so many different exercises in the database I would prefer to not see any repeated ones.  I thought that's what the purpose of this DVD was, maybe it's just a flaw in the programming.

I still like this DVD though, Minna is a great instructor, very laid back, not intimidating, I enjoy working out with her.  She is by herself in a cozy workout room.  This workout only requires a couple sets of dumbells, light and heavy.  The DVD has a lot of features, separate warm up and cooldowns, plus fast track workouts on those time crunched days.

It's too bad this DVD is already out of print and has been for a while now.  It offers a lot of variety, and I enjoy it despite a few quibbles I have with it.  I would rate it as beginner/intermediate level.  Each exercise is only a minute long, I find I can't use too heavy of weight as it is fast paced because they want to fit so many reps into one minute.  4 stars for this one.",1255737600,2,1843,4.143661971830986

Supposedly there are over 100 one-minute segments, and your DVD will randomly choose the ones suited to your choice of body parts (upper, lower, abs, total body) and intensity level. The problem is, the exercises still repeat. Today I chose a 36 minute workout, and the exercises were already repeating 13 minutes after I started.
Anyway, I will still use this DVD...I figure the extra reps won't hurt me. LOVE Minna. She is so down-to-earth and easy to follow.",1219104000,,533,4.804347826086956

You pick from upper, lower, full body, abdomen, then level one or two, and the number of minutes, which, if you're like me, you'll end up doing more once you get started. And there is a short full body workout if you're in a hurry that day.  It's the only one I've ever bought that is not gathering dust.",1206748800,,568,4.380952380952381

This is the best video to come out in a long time. Great for those who are just getting back into shape or want a nice day-to-day circuit workout. Hope this is helpful.

I'll start out with minute A and move on to B and C but then here comes A again.  It gets annoying having to skip over them. I don't know if anyone else has experienced this but I don't like doing a challenging shoulder minute only to do the same minute 2 moments later! Also I would only advise those with more experience to use this because there is not much explanation for each move, which may be needed when trying to ""roll like a ball,"" a pilates move that requires more explanation to help prevent injury.

2500180,5,B000E6EK1K,"I heard from a trainer some time ago that you should try to vary the order in which you do your weight lifting and other strength exercises, because the body can adapt to doing the same exercises in the same order, which can render them less effective.  In light of that advice, this workout is an interesting idea; it has about 115 one-minute exercises that play in random order.  You can choose your area of focus (upper or lower body, core, total body), the length of the workout and the intensity of the workout, and you are pretty much guaranteed a different workout every time.

This would all be a useless gimmick, of course, if the quality of the workout was bad, but I really like it.  I'd say that I'm at an intermediate level, and the level 2 workouts are just right for me - challenging enough, but not intimidating.  To mix it up, I sometimes do an easier level 1 workout with heavier weights.

The exercises are a really good mix - there are quite a few that are unique and original.  She does some variations on push-ups and leg lifts that I had never seen before.  I particularly like the variety in the core section - it isn't all crunches, there are some good yoga and pilates influenced moves, and there is a good amount of focus on the back.  (I find sometimes that ""core"" workouts focus only on the abs, ignoring the back.)  I love the fact that each exercise is only done for one minute; it really gives me a reason to push myself as hard as I can, knowing that in 60 seconds I'll be able to move on to something different.

This workout is very easy to do at home, since it can be done in a small space and only requires a couple of sets of dumbbells as far as equipment goes.  I find myself quite enjoying the variety of this DVD, and it very quickly became a part of my regular workout rotation.",1186099200,3,1820,4.2894736842105265

You can focus on one area at a time or go for a full-body workout.  Sometimes I go for a jog and just need a good abs workout and this is perfect for that.  My boyfriend also loves the abs exercises.  There are a variety of exercises including all the classics plus pilates type movements and some I remember from gymnastics.  They are all easy to follow and the instructor is awesome!  She also manages to be upbeat and motivating without being too hyper or annoying.

2500185,5,B000E6EK1K,"The ""Minna Lessig - Total Body Toning - 1 Minute Workout"" DVD lets you create your own workout. First you do the warm-up exercise which the DVD randomly selects from three choices. After the warm-up you pick what area you want to work on: Upper Body, Lower Body, Abs, or Total Body and which level of intensity you want - Level I (easier) or Level 2 (harder). Next you get to pick how long you want to work out which can range from one minute to 72 minutes depending on what area you are targeting and what level you are working at. Each exercise is approximately one minute long and many of the exercises require either a set of light weights or a heavier set of weights. After exercising you select the cool down exercise which again is randomly selected from three options. There are also two Fast Track Workouts if you are pressed for time - the Level 1 Fast Track Workout is three minutes long and the Level 2 Fast Track Workout is four minutes long. There is also a seven minute Bonus Stretch Segment as well as segments explaining how the program works and how to get the most out of the DVD.

""Minna Lessig - Total Body Toning - 1 Minute Workout"" is a great way of toning your body. I consider myself a beginner when it comes to exercising and I really appreciate the fact that I can choose the length and intensity of my workout. I use Level 1 and while I don't break out in a sweat like I do when using other exercise DVD's, I do feel like I've gotten a complete workout by the time I'm through. I found the one minute length of each exercise to be perfect, especially since if an exercise was a bit too difficult for me I could either still do it in the one minute or skip it altogether without harming my exercise routine. The DVD claims to have over 115 different exercises (there's a chart listing them all) so most of the time each exercise program is different, but I have seen some exercises repeated while I exercise. I do the Total Body Toning (Level 1) and the exercises either involve standing up or floor exercise with no apparent rhyme or reason as to which is next and it can be a bit frustrating to have to switch from one to the other with no warning. There is a brief transition period between each exercise, which may annoy some, but I found it a perfect way to catch my breath before going onto the next exercise. While the DVD says weights are optional, the majority of exercises I've done require either light weights or heavier weights. The warm up and cool down sections are very helpful, especially the cool down which I find very effective. I like Minna Lessig as an instructor; she's very pleasant, calm, and encouraging.

I find ""Minna Lessig - Total Body Toning - 1 Minute Workout"" to be very helpful.",1182124800,7,2739,4.368627450980392

However, if you are like me and exercise isn't your favorite part of the day, this DVD is just what you need.  Put the guacamole and the chips down, get off the couch, waddle over to the DVD and turn it on.

You tell the DVD which part of your body you want to work (Upper Body, Lower Body, Abs, Total Body), at what intensity (Level 1 or Level 2) and how much time you have: (4, 8, 12, 24 minutes) and off you go. I think its a great concept and I wish more DVDs gave me this kind of control.

As the other reviewers have stated, this is a toning tape and a light set of hand weights and a slightly heavier set are required.  I like this too as I don't want my living room to double as a gym with balls, bands and gimmicks lying around.

The only complaint I have is that sometimes, Minna has you on the floor and the next minute you need to be standing up.  I don't move quite as fast as I used to so I miss the first few reps on the new exercise.

The number of minutes offered depends on the previous selections made.  Each exercise is one minute, and the exercises change every time you do the dvd.  You need weights for this dvd, preferably a lighter and a heavier set so you can switch when certain exercises are too hard or too easy.  You may need a mat if you have a hard floor.  Most of the exercises are straight forward and she demonstrates them before you begin.  Minna is a good instructor, not too cheerful or obnoxious.

one caveat, you almost need to do her other fantastic videos, strength and grace and fat eliminator first, as she goes into more detail about how to do things like backward lunges correctly. she doesn't give ""as much"" direction on total body toning but  this is probably because she only has one minute to do each exercise and  most of what she says is  encouragement. i would reccomend doing the other ones first.

She really encourages you to do your best in this DVD, and I feel like sometimes if I have to go a bit slower then her to finish a set or can't stretch as high as she can, she is there for me and keeps her encouraging tone to everyone to try to do their best.

Second, I really enjoy that I can customize this DVD to what I want. Sometimes I want to do only 15-30 minutes in the morning, and 20 minutes at night. I can choose whatever I want with this DVD and it always is different! I also like that I can select whether I want to do a total body workout, or just work on parts of my body.

Third, I enjoy her extra things she puts on the DVD. She has a warm up session (3) and cool down session (3) and a fast track workout that you can further use to customize your workout session.

The only negative thing I could say about this DVD is sometimes in my workouts, I get the same segments 2-3 times per workout. While that is a bummer, it's also good because I feel like I am working out that part of me more and doing it over a period of time rather than just right in a row.",1176076800,4,1255,3.8378378378378377

Minna is pleasant but not overly perky/annoying.  I also have her Emergency Workout which isn't outrageously intense, but a good workout nonetheless.

It really rounds out the work-outs. Plus with all the exercises being a minute long....completing each one seems like a doable task...which is a wonderful motivator in itself. In addition, many of the exercises consist of you working with your own body weight...which is so important in life. You never know when you may need to hold yourself up one day.

This DVD is like that. Solid workout. I generally like to do weight exercises to build muscles and these exercises take advantage of weights and DO give me a decent workout. I'm not someone who likes to spend A LOT of time working out, so this gets it done quick. By breaking it into a bunch of 1 minute exercises, the time goes by quickly.

I'd recommend this DVD, definitely.",1144886400,7,573,4.247706422018348
2500291,5,B000E6EK1K,"The thing which distinguishes a Minna Lessig workout is that her focus is always on using safe exercises to get good results, i.e. become more fit and generally lose weight.  Her education in physical therapy and biology is clearly reflected in her approach of challenging, but not overexerting, the body.

The upshot is that this DVD, as with all her DVDs, is optimistic and body-positive in its conception.  It focuses on what most people will be able to do in a very small amount of time to get in shape and change their lives rather than just on how the average person's buns, abs, or upper arms are going to look later.  The focus is on being patient and on the real, positive changes happening inside the body long before they become visible on the outside.

The minute-exercise concept works well, and transitions are well planned.  However, some exercises are necessarily more challenging, e.g. push-ups, than others because they have to be performed more quickly.  The level 1 exercises tend to include fewer multi-muscle-group exercises than the level 2 exercises.  The concept also seems to be that the better shape you are in, the more you will have to gradually add heavier weights to your routine to challenge yourself and progress.  You have to have enough body-awareness to know how your workout feels and ergo how heavy your weights should be.  The other part of the workout concept is that form is everything - the challenge for more fit students is not just to perform the exercises in the short amount of time allotted, but to perform them properly.  This is where the aerobic element has been built into the workout.

Since the one-minute concept necessarily adds in a few seconds of break between each new exercise, you don't do several minutes' of uninterrupted aerobic exercise.  However, the workouts are aerobic, especially on level 2, and even those who are in better shape will be able to get a good workout from this DVD, provided that they select the right level of challenge for themselves and, as Minna might say, really pay attention to their form.",1144627200,25,2081,4.811797752808989
