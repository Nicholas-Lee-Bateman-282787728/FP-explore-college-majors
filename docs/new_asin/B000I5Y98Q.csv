2653338,4,B000I5Y98Q,"This package comes with 2 DVDs. One has the Polygram Final Cut video, and the other one has this Straight Between the Eyes concert, from 1982. This one was totally new for me. Ritchie is really excited on stage, as I have never seen before. Although his playing is not that fantastic, when compared to other concerts such as the Live In Germany from 1977, his intensity on stage calls attention. They play several songs from the Straight Between album, and some pieces from some Purple songs (Lazy, Woman From Tokyo). Smoke on the Water ends the set.
Ritchie uses his tradicional white stratocaster the hole set, and switch to one half-Fender when the time of guitar crash comes.
Comments from the others: Roger Glover plays his usual, Joe delivers some great vocals, David and Bob play really great.
I totally recommend it for all Purple and Blackmore fans.",1183420800,3,858,4.76510067114094

2653341,4,B000I5Y98Q,"I have the PAL version of this DVD. I just saw the first (Live Between the Eyes) of the 2 DVDs this set has and felt strongly compelled to share my opinion with other Rainbow fans. (I will post a review of the second DVD later).

The first DVD covers a concert held in San Antonio, TX. to support the release of Rainbow's ""Straight Between The Eyes"" album. Here's what they played:

Overture: Over the Rainbow
Spotlight Kid
Miss Mistreated
It Cant' Happen Here
Tearin' Out My Heart
All Night Long
Stone Cold
Power
Blues Interlude
Beethoven's Ninth:Ode to Joy
Long Live Rock'n'Roll
Smoke On The Water

IMHO, great concert. Ritchie Blackmore gets plenty of close-ups (to the detriment of the rest of the band). He is definitively energized for this concert (as opposed to others in which he seems to be far away and detached from everyone!). Joe Lynn Turner delivers a great vocal performance on all tracks except on Smoke On The Water and Long Live Rock and Roll (well, he does not measure up against Dio or Gillan). He does a good job at covering ""All Night Long"". As usual, Ritchie destroys a guitar towards the end of the show. Roger Glover delivers as usual.

You can see on this DVD how much control Blackmore exerts over the band: there is a constant stream of verbal, eye, and body contact/cues with the rest of the band (drums and keyboard, especifically). All so that they could keep up with what he (Blackmore) had in mind. Please correct me if I am wrong, but I did not see a single time when Blackmore cued Glover (I guess they have known each other for so long that there is no need for that). Having been a semi-professional musician, covering these very songs, I did notice a couple of instances in which the band indeed failed to follow him. Most will not be noticed, but perhaps you could discern the mistake they had while playing Smoke On The Water.

Strange fact: the DTS mix is louder and clearer than the Dolby 5.1 mix. I double checked my home theater settings just in case, but I guess it just came out like this.

Second DVD:
This has a compilation of video clips and it was released when Blackmore called Rainbow quits and he and Glover reformed Deep Purple with Gillan, Lord, and Paice. [There are pictures of Rainbow's ""Finyl Vynil"" album]. Clips are as follows:

Spotlight Kid (This one is a repeat from the 1st DVD)
Death Alley Drive (Blackmore dressed as an evil man following Turner)
I Surrender
All Night Long (with G. Bonnet! great voice this guy had!)
Can't Happen Here
Difficult to Cure
Can't Let You Go (Blackmore again playing as an evil man)
Power
Since You've Been Gone
Stone Cold
River of Dreams

There are no clips from Dio's stint with Rainbow. I enjoyed this DVD only because I barely remember some of these clips... (nostalgia!).

If you are a Rainbow fan, this one is to own. Seeing this line up in action was a great Christmas gift. This DVD set complements perfectly the Live In Munich concert DVD.",1167004800,26,2945,4.531073446327683

8144195,4,B000I5Y98Q,"This title contains two separate releases: ""Live Between The Eyes"", a concert from San Antonio, Texas in 1982 and ""The Final Cut"", a collection of promo videos from 1979-1984. This is currently (Feb 2008)only available as a Region 2 release, which means you'll need an all-region DVD player to watch it if you live in the US. Despite the complaints in other reviews here, it is clearly stated in the product description what region code it carries. I bought an all-region DVD player here on Amazon (a Phillips)that was very inexpensive and it plays this title just fine.

Finally available after being out of print for years, it was sure nice to be able to retire my aged VHS tapes of these two releases. The San Antonio show is great, IF one likes or can handle the Joe Lynn Turner era of Rainbow. Much more commercial or pop-oriented than the 70's era Rainbow, this is also the most financially successful era of Rainbow. The band is cooking though and all the songs rock harder than the studio versions. They also allow Blackmore to do what he does best, which is to stretch out and turn songs into platforms for his improvisational magic. An extraordinary guitarist, the San Antonio show captures him at the top of his game.
The Final Cut was originally released as a video companion to the Final Vinyl audio set. It is essentially a collection of videos from 1979-1984 and includes several live clips from the final Rainbow shows in Tokyo 1984. These were recorded right before Rainbow broke up and Deep Purple reformed. This is an essential release and priced very reasonably for a 2DVD set.",1204416000,7,1597,4.703571428571428
8144196,3,B000I5Y98Q,"Ok - finally broke down and got this and here's the deal - VERY frustrating package that you should only get if you ALREADY have the Live in Munich DVD, which is superior. My obsession with Blackmore (one of my 5 all-time favorite guitarists) is enough to overcome my ambivalence towards pop-star lite Joe Lynn Turner (don't really like him when compared to Dio or Bonnet, much less Gillan, but don't exactly dislike him either and he DOES have some good songs)!

So that, coupled with the fact that I saw the Live Between The Eyes tour in Atlanta shortly before the Texas show was filmed for this release, and have owned the VHS for 20+ years, was enough to make me purchase this double DVD set. Besides, I have the Final Cut CD but have never seen the video though I recorded many of the videos off MTV (back before they became a national disgrace run by demons!!)

The Live Between The Eyes is nice, remastered and in 5.1 (as is the Final Cut), though otherwise it is the same as the VHS. And, personally, the Final Cut DVD is worth it for the 10 minute Difficult to Cure with the Tokyo symphony Orchestra alone!! And there were 2-3 videos I had never seen before. So, overall it is a worthy addition for hardcore Rainbow fans or those crazy people who like the Turner era Rainbow better than the Dio era!  :)

But, here comes the frustrating part, it is a shot in the dark whether you'll be able to play it or not. As several reviews (and Amazon themselves) have mentioned it is NTSC BUT is NOT region 1?!?! (Mine anyway, it seems some of them are PAL.) I commented out loud ""Who the heck is NTSC but NOT region 1"" and a military buddy immediately commented ""Japan""!!! Which, in hindsight, makes sense because Rainbow (and all things Blackmore in general) are HUGE in Japan!

Yep - NONE of my DVD players would play it! I felt sure that at least one of them would because it's supposed to be multi-region, even PAL capable, and has played just about anything I put in it. But noooo...it wouldn't play it either. Fortunately I did find a computer program that allowed me to change it to region 1 and re-burn it so that's how I know all the above. I simply put the DVD-R discs in the box with the originals and put it back on my bookshelf. So, without technical difficulties I would have given this 4 stars but, as is, I can only give it 3.

Bottom line, if you are into Blackmore as much as I am, then you need this (especially if you saw this tour and want a memory). But ONLY if you already have the Live in Munich (with Dio) DVD - THAT'S true Rainbow!! But, whether you'll be able to play it or not is anybody's guess!!",1201478400,16,2625,4.303643724696356
8144197,4,B000I5Y98Q,"The dvd sounds great, has good footage and all the great songs you be expecting from this specific tour, straight between the eyes. The  second dvd has some video's and surprisingly has more live footage of rainbow with a orchestra doing beethoven's tune. Good stuff. By the way, the dvd didn't play in my toshiba dvd player,(format), but played in my cheap 29.00 dvd player that just has a huge list of formats it will play.",1194998400,2,425,4.592105263157895
