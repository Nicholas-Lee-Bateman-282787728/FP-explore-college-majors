Shrill and poorly balanced, it is hard to watch at times, music often louder than the conversations you want to hear.  So if you can watch it on VHS. or Netflix,, definitely do that instead.

This version was certainly not the same quality as the Canadian version ( Forever Knight) that came out a few years later, but it was campy and who doesn't love vintage Rick Springield as a sexy vampire????

Whether intentionally or not, the genre morphed into the Canadian-produced Forever Knight, which has a similar storyline.

444061,3,6302247837,"I love Rick Springfield and his work, though I do have to say that I'm glad they replaced Rick with Gerraint Wynn Davies when TV Show was done, Gerraint was way more believable a vampire than Rick was not too mention the guy who played Lacriox was horrible Thank God for Nigel Bennett who totally owned that role.
But all in all it was alright, it was nice to see how the cult classic began.",1299801600,,391,4.226666666666667
444062,4,6302247837,"This "" Nick Knight"" Vampire Cop was aired on CBS in  about 1990 or so.
 This movie was set up to be a pilot that didn't make it starring Rick Springfield in the title role.
Alas, poor Rick I am such a big fan, but TV shows have not treated him well.

I have seen the reviews and understand where the confusion might come in between this and Forever Knight
I think if I remember correctly that it was CBS who first retooled this to put on their late night crime series
 and they got rid of most- but kept some- of the actors from this and added others like Geraint Wyn Davies in the title role,
instead of Rick Springfield and renamed it ""Forever Knight"" then I believe that the SYFY channel picked it up.

Now as I've written I am a huge Rick fan so when this came out I watched it and I know this is campy but it's kind of fun and Springfield fans love to see him but take it for what it is.

And I  also watched when it was revamped and I really liked the Forever Knight series too.
So for those who want to watch a good campy vampire-cop movie starring Rick Springfield this is for you. BUT if you are a die hard fan of the
Forever Knight series, tread lightly this may not be for you.
To all of my fellow Rick Fans enjoy the ride in Nick Knight's Cadillac because it's fun.
Thanks for reading",1283558400,,1296,4.0390625

444084,5,6302247837,"Nick Night is a great movie and is also where the popular tv series ( Forever Knight ) got it's start from. Nick Knicht is a french nobalman who centuries ago was made a vampire by a man called Lacroix one of the main characters he is Nick's sire/father figure/nemesis and villian. There is also jeanette the beautiful sophisticated french woman vampiress who owns a night club/vampire hangout called Raven. This interesting cast of characters adds to a great plot

In modern times Nick becomes a cop his partner Skanky drives him nuts but Skanky is a good guy their interaction is at times comical, Nick later on meets ( Natalie ) who is the coroner besides doing autopsys she is helping Nick not only with his job and cases but in his quest to become human again. For those who haven't seen the tv series ( Forever Knight ) I highly reccomend ( Geriant Wyn Davies ) plays Nick Knight in that but characters from this movie are in the series to a big plus. I love this movie but like the series even more, in this you get a great mix of drama, suspence, horror, and comedy, with some romance",1254700800,,1092,4.405940594059406
444085,5,6302247837,Get it. Loved it. The original that took off as a series. Rick Springfield is amazing in it. This movie was pieced together in one of the Forever Knight episodes. I enjoyed it very much. Loved how it all started.,1254441600,,212,4.325
444086,3,6302247837,Some scenes are good and some scenes I didn't care for. I wanted to see this after watching all three seasons of the FK series (thanks to Netflix). I really like some of the songs in this movie. Didn't care for the guy part that's Dr. Lambert in the series.,1250726400,,257,4.16

This movie only slightly reworked for the pilot of the late-night TV series that was almost killed off by CBS & David Letterman. As a repentent vampire, Nick worked the night shift as a cop to help catch the bad guys. Check out Springfield during his prime.",1244419200,,367,4.661538461538462

444090,4,6302247837,It was a pretty good vampire movie considering when it was made and Rick Springfield ia a doll in it as usual.,1220745600,,110,4.045454545454546
444091,4,6302247837,"This Movie ""Nick Knight"" is especially good for Fans of the Series ""Forever Knight"", which Ran for 3 Seasons.  It's a good story and production for those who like Modern-Day reforming Vampire plots.

The movie ""Nick Knight"" is well done.",1219881600,,237,4.9
444092,4,6302247837,I saw this pilot when it came and looked forward to the series.  The series was okay.  The series Moonlight makes for the bad taste left in one's mouth (no pun intended) for the series Nick Knight became.,1210032000,,204,4.342105263157895
444113,5,6302247837,"I am a H-U-G-E fan of the 'Forever Knight' TV show, and Geraint Wyn Davies.  But I also LOVE this version of the movie/pilot.  Rick is a wondeful singer, but most people don't know how well he can act too!

There is one scene, where he is walking across his loft with a goblet of blood, and he dips his finger in and drips it into his mouth.  Now, this was NOT in the script, he ad libed it because he tought it was something the character would do.  It really makes the scene, I love it!

But that just shows how good an actor the man is.

The movie is full of action, adventure and humor.  The actors are all good, and the plot is believable.  It is well worth seeing.  And if you have not seen 'Forever Knight', you can buy all three seasons here on Amazon for a good price.  I ALSO recommend the series, especially after you see this.  They are both excellent.",1206835200,3,864,4.107784431137724
444114,2,6302247837,"I remember watching the first season of Forever Knight (FK) when it was broadcast on network television.  I stayed up late just to make sure I caught it.
I had heard rumors of a TV movie that came before it, with Rick Springfield in the title role, but I couldn't ever actually find it anywhere.
Then along comes my savior Netflix and I have the chance to see, what I believed, was a pilot movie for the show.

Boy was I wrong.
Less than 5 minutes into this, I was quoting right along with it.  Word. For.  Word.
Needless to say, I was less than thrilled.
I suppose there's some amusement at seeing the slight differences between this and the first two episodes of FK, but I was just annoyed at having wasted my time to watch it.
I was even more annoyed at Mr Slan and Mr Parriot for not even bothering to change anything.  Given the creative writing and very enjoyable episodes of FK, one or two more hour long shows couldn't have been -that- much of a chore.",1204588800,2,960,4.281767955801105
444115,3,6302247837,"Made three years before ""Forever Knight"", ""Nick Knight"" was an earlier attempt at filming the pilot for this series. ""Nick Knight"" is almost scene-for-scene identical (clearly they used the same script and only made minor changes) to the pilot of ""Forever Knight"" (which is included in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forever-Knight-The-Trilogy-Part-1-1992-1993/dp/B0000C23T1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forever Knight - The Trilogy, Part 1 (1992 - 1993)</a>&nbsp;as episodes 1 and 2), except with a lower budget and different actors. I saw both pilots within a week of each other and although neither is brilliant, I considered ""Nick Knight"" to be the better of the two. The acting in ""Nick Knight"" is far and away better than that in ""Forever Knight"", in particular, Rick Springfield makes a far better Nick (the troubled vampire turned detective) than Geraint Wyn Davies. The scene in which he sits down to a goblet of warm blood as if it were a cup of hot chocolate is priceless.

I recommend this movie to all ""Forever Knight"" fans, if only to see how the series could have been.",1199577600,3,1126,5.546511627906977

444117,1,6302247837,"This movie is the pits! I can't recommend it to anyone. If you're a fan of the ""Forever Knight"" series, don't ruin it by seeing this pilot movie. What a waste of time.

I understand some scenes were deleted from this trash. That's what I call a good thing. The less you have to watch, the better it is for you. Anchor Bay could've put out a better DVD. There was only ""play"" and ""chapters"" available as menu options. You see, even they know junk when they see it. But even junk brings a profit.

You've been warned!",1188432000,,515,4.244897959183674
444118,3,6302247837,"It's sad that Anchor Bay ""cropped"" or cut scenes from this movie. The part when Nick FINALLY gets the gobblet, or the scene where his curator/girlfriend is a vampire (made by LaCroix), atop Nick's roof glaring down at him in his loft, growling, with her vampire teeth. There's about 2/3 more scenes like those ""missing"" fromthis movie. Tsk-Tsk...What a shame too.",1187654400,4,363,4.967213114754099
444119,1,6302247837,"Absolutely a waste of time and money.  Effects were horrible.  If I had not seen the television series first, I would never ever have bothered with this film.

444120,4,6302247837,"I had never heard of this movie, although I had been a fan of the Forever Knight series for years.  It was a little odd seeing different actors in the parts, but t was a very interesting look into Nick's early time as a cop.  If you are a fan of the series, you will find the movie interesting.  I even like Rick Springfield in the part of Nick - and I believed in him.  Not the best movie of all time, and the series was better acted, but still fun for Forever Knight fans.",1181606400,,474,3.957894736842105
444121,3,6302247837,"""Nick Knight"" is  a cool movie to have and own. It is one that fans of the TV series will want, but it isn't as good as the Ger Davies TV series. There is no Natalie, Janette is unattractive and LaCroix is no where near as cool as he is when played by Nigel. It's not only those shallow points, but there is just no chemistry between the cast and characters. Janette and Nick seem like enemies, and there is no real sense of hate towards LaCroix for becoming a vampire. The entire movie just has a different feel.

The music, I have to admit, is quite good if you like the music from the decade. These were songs I knew very well, so it was enjoyable to hear them in the movie. Overall, fans will want to see this movie, but those who aren't fans may actually like it more. You just can't beat the relationships the characters have on the TV series, and it is obviously missing here-even compared to the ""Forever Knight"" version of this movie.",1177632000,3,943,4.262569832402234
444122,5,6302247837,"Rick Springfield is equally adept at acting and music, an all-too-rare combination. In fact, he's the only musician/actor I can think of who can really do both. In this film, he is perfectly cast as an LA cop who works nights, successfully hiding the fact that he is also a vampire. When a series of murders strikes Los Angeles, Knight (Springfield) is the investigating officer, along with his new, obnoxious partner (John Kapelos). The connecting thread among the murders is that all the victims are homeless - and all have been drained of blood.

When another murder is committed in which the victim has been drained of blood, yet all the other marks of the crime differ from the usual pattern, the case takes a strange twist for Knight.

I wish that the film had been written with a stronger female character. Alyce Hunter, who is supposed to be a brilliant archeologist, does some of the stupidest things I've ever seen in a film. She chases Knight down an alley (trying not to be seen or heard) in high heels. She tries to attack another vampire with a dowel. She tips her hand too early. A better actress would have done more with the role, but Laura Johnson is simply awful. She's awkward, angular, and looks as if she's wondering when the shot will be over, so she can go hide somewhere. I can't believe that she was cast as a woman with whom Knight is supposed to make a fast emotional connection. She looks more like a bundle of neurosis held together by very fine wire. Why on earth was she cast? Not only does she sink every scene she's in, she damages the movie as a whole.

Johnson (and her character) aside, this was a nifty film showing modern life for a vampire. Where does he go during the day? How much daylight can he handle? Where does he get his food? Does anyone else know what he is? The film offers interesting answers to these questions.

If you like Rick Springfield, or if you like vampire films, this is one for you. Especially if you like Springfield, who IS the character, and hence, makes the movie effective.",1174521600,2,2042,4.510810810810811

I bought this dvd because I am a Springfield fan and very long ago -when I was a teenager - I read about this movie in a magazine.

In some respects I like it better than the series that followed (although the series LaCroix, Nigel Bennett, was superior). Ultimately both this pilot and the series were great ideas with mediocre execution, but even so, bot hare worth checking out if you like vampires. At least it tried to do something different (for the time it was made). I also recommend Susan Sizemore's ""Stirring of Dust"" novel, based on characters from the series.",1169942400,,512,4.965116279069767
444175,5,6302247837,"I see that other reviews already give plot summaries, so I want to give some little details that I exceedingly enjoyed (and had to rewind to watch over and over).  Rick (Nick the Cop with the graveyard shift), has this ancient ritual goblet at home.  He pours blood from a wine bottle into it and heats it in the MICROWAVE!  That's his dinner - what I liked about this scene was that he makes it look like some delectable chocolate/cream/decadence by dipping his fingers into the cup, leaning back in his easy chair and licking his fingers after each dip into the cup!  Then, we see his lips spotted with droplets of blood.  During the movie we also see Rick (well, the cop) ""vamp-out"" in full vampire/undead face and go ballistic.  He develops a love-interest as well, and at one point tells a fellow married officer  that it must be nice ""to wake up with a woman every morning.""  I just love that line - it makes me laugh to think that we'd actually EVER believe that this gorgeous cop would wake up without a woman (only if he didn't want to ok).  Alright, the truth is - he's afraid to take a woman because he believes he'd chomp into her and drain her of blood in the moment of ecstasy (which he nearly does to this one woman after a little heated ""necking"" episode).  Yes, you might be tempted to watch this film multiple times.  If you are a Rick fan (and female) you will.  I kept calling my 15 year old daughter over ""hey, oh my gosh, come look at Rick!""

444177,5,6302247837,"The 1989 T.V. flick 'Nick Knight' tells us about the life of a man who's trying to forget his past and start on a new life. Nick Knight, played by Rick Springfield, is a cop who is investigating the murders of innocent homeless people, each having their blood pumped from their bodies. On the verge of discovering who is responsible for the horrible deaths, Nick is called in to a museum to find a murdered security guard whose blood is pumped from his body. But Nick notices that this one is different than the other deaths, the guard's blood was sucked from his neck with two bite marks. The killer has also stolen a rare Mayan goblet that is very valuable. Nick now has to deal with two murderers, one of them a vampire.

Nick's only witness is the museum archeologist Alice Hunter, a beautiful and intelligent woman who falls in love with Nick when they meet. She loves the way he dresses, his black hair and young handsome face she can never take her eyes off of. But what she doesn't know is that Nick is not an ordinary man, Nick is over two hundred years old and is not mortal. Nick Knight is a vampire.

Nick has to find the vampire who killed the security guard and stoled the Mayan Goblet, for the goblet can help turn Nick back into a human being. Nick knows that Lacroix, the vampire that turned Nick into one, is responsible for the murder and the theft. Without the goblet, Nick cannot become a human being again and will have to live for eternity, being tormented with the thirst for blood and watching the ones that he love grow old and die in front of his eyes. Nick tracks down Lacroix and the two vampires engage in a violent and dramatic battle over the goblet.

Mixed with horror, romance, humor, and drama, Nick Knight is an amazing and perhaps the best vampire movie ever. Rick Springfield delivers his best performance in acting. Although the special effects aren't spectacular, the script and actors are what make this an awesome movie. I highly recommend this movie and hope that it will always be remembered as the greatest vampire movie ever!!!",1136246400,4,2073,4.522666666666667

However, I am a HUGE Rick Springfield fan, but sorry to say that I missed this in 1989, probably because I had just graduated from high school and hardly was home to watch tv! I purchased this not only because it starred Rick, but also because it was a 'vampire making amends-Angel kinda story'. I absolutely love Angel and Buffy,(...Blade, Van Helsing, Lost Boys, Interview with a Vampire...etc) and this has such a similar storyline to Angel, I couldn't resist. Although cheesy and lacking in the special effects area at times, it's pretty good for 1989, (compared with how special effects have improved drastically since then...can you say DIGITAL?)  Rick looks as GORGEOUS as ever, great butt in those jeans! I wouldn't even have minded if he broke into song! I guess the country just wasn't ready for vampire TV yet, it was just about a decade too soon!

I was much disappointed that they had not kept more members of the original cast and had chosen to reshoot the pilot and air it like Nick Knight had never been.  It took me the whole four years that Forever Knight was on TV to warm to the cast and I absolutely hated the cheesy flashbacks!  I didn't need to be beat over the head to know that Nick was obviously older than he looked!  I mostly watched the series out of loyalty to the original pilot and hoped that the series would get better with time, but obviously they must have replaced the original director and writers to come up with the sloppy mess they put out for the series.  All in all, the original Nick Knight was the best of the bunch and I recommend this movie to anyone who is not yet biased by the trash that came out in the series.",1087171200,13,1108,4.125581395348838

Rick Springfield did fine but I'm glad the television show got rid of most of the actors except for our dear friend Detective Skanky -- what a name to be stuck with in life.  The first two episodes of the television series basically redoes this movie so you dont' need to get it as a supplment.

444213,4,6302247837,"In the 1989 TV flick NICK KNIGHT, rocker (1981's Grammy-winning ""Jessie's Girl"") and soap-opera star (GENERAL HOSPITAL, 1981-1983) Rick Springfield portrays Nick Knight, a homicide detective on the night shift who has a reputation for being a loner and a maverick.  But he's a good cop, and he's hip.  He drives a cool vintage Caddy, looks good in black leather, and has a soft spot in his heart for the homeless (he often checks up on them when he's out on his ""beat"").  Oh, yeah--and he's also a guilt-ridden vampire in quest of a cure for his supernatural malady.  Solving crimes, specifically homicides, is sort of his way of paying penance for the murderous, blood-sucking sins of his past.
Though often neglected or overlooked, NICK KNIGHT is an intelligent, skillfully written, and well-acted TV film that was actually the original pilot for the popular cult TV series FOREVER KNIGHT (1992-1996).  One reason that this film is nearly forgotten might be the fact that the same story was re-shot with the TV cast and subsequently aired as the series' two-part opener.  While the cast of the series does a fine job-the excellent cast is, of course, one of many reasons that the show quickly became a cult favorite--NICK KNIGHT is in many ways superior to the two-part remake, and it is therefore unfortunate that the series has eclipsed the original film and pushed it into near obscurity.
The acting in NICK KNIGHT is superb, especially considering that it is a made-for-TV flick.  In the titular role, Springfield delivers a strong, convincing performance and has great chemistry with the rest of the cast.  Also intriguing is Laura Johnson, who plays museum curator Alyce Hunter and Knight's love interest.  Not only is she a good actress and quite attractive, but Ms. Johnson and Springfield really sizzle together when they share screen time.  Genre fans might recognize Michael Nader from his role as Nicolas Pike in TV's short-lived 1990 series THE FLASH, but couch potatoes are more likely to recognize him from his long-standing role as Farnsworth Dexter on TV's nighttime soap DYNASTY.  Here he plays Nick's longtime nemesis, Lacroix. (Nader does a good job in the role, though he is admittedly not as compelling--nor as accomplished an actor--as Nigel Bennett, who assumes the role in the series.)  As the film's comic relief, John Kapelos is hilariously entertaining in the role of Nick's annoyingly self-absorbed partner Don Schanke, and he often steals the scenes he is in.  Interestingly, Kapelos is the only actor in the film who returns to reprise his role for the TV series.
The film itself has really stood up well over time.  Aside from the 1980's pop tunes in the soundtrack and a few cheesy special FX, there isn't much that reveals NICK KNIGHT to be a product of late-1980s TV.  The script is tight and interesting, the characters are likable and realistic, the directing is top-notch, and, as mentioned before, the acting is excellent.  All in all, the film is a forgotten gem that, like its vampire characters, deserves to rise from the dead and live forever.
And thanks to the folks at Anchor Bay, NICK KNIGHT has been resurrected on DVD.  True, he offering is a bare-bones disc--i.e., there are no extras or bonus features--but the digital transfer is drastically better than the previous VHS releases of the film, and the sound quality is pretty good. And being a telefilm, it is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.33:1.
For fans of the TV show FOREVER KNIGHT who did not see this pilot film prior to the creation of the series, it might take a little time to warm up to the alternate actors and the character variations.  But if viewed an open mind, any fan of the TV series should enjoy NICK KNIGHT, and any fan of the vampire genre will want to add the DVD of this excellent film to their collections.
Definitely worth amazon.com's reasonable price of admission.",1084752000,128,3906,4.856927710843373

444215,3,6302247837,"Greetings, people. I saw this DVD for five bucks while at the grocery store of all places, and recognized the name Nick Knight as the name of our hero from Forever Knight, hereafter known as ""FK."" I hadn't heard of this movie, although FK was my favorite by far of the Crimetime after Primetime vehicles back in the day. Five bucks, what the heck, so I picked it up. I figured it out, this must have been the pilot for the series.
First of all I like FK very much, and therefore was comparing it to FK and being very hypercritical toward it. I do have to say that everyone in the movie did a capable acting job in my opinion, although I am no authority in this department.
I've got nothing against Rick Springfield, he did a good job. I liked the part at the beginning in the tanning booth, in fact I think they who made this movie should have made hime spend a few minutes in the booth where his angst would build, maybe with a flashback to being caught out in the sun starting to self-combust. I know why they didn't. They want you to not know that he's a vamp, but to figure it out from the clues. But they contradicted themselves in this line of reasoning here, because everyone who watches it already knows anyway, because this story is advertized as the story of the vampire detective, and they themselves are the ones who advertized it as such.
But I have to say, the sound quality is truly pathetic. And this is a DVD no less, friends. Couldn't they have cleaned up the sound a bit for us? No, evidently not! I had to turn the volume all the way up to 11 to catch what the people in the movie were saying, then the static and other noise was unbearable. Also I didn't like the vampire makeup in this version. The visual quality isn't too good either, although the DVD of the 1st season of FK also doesn't have very good visual quality, maybe the master tapes are bad.
While I'm sure that the actor who plays Nick's confidante the medical examiner is a nice guy, I think the idea of having Dr. Nathalie Lambert in FK is a much better idea, because as we all know vampires are supposed to be sexy and sexual tension (or tension of any kind) of an ongoing nature between characters makes for more riveting drama. That tension is lacking here, except for that between Nick and the museum lady, and Nick and Janette (who is smoldering in FK, but more on that later.)
The LaCroix we see here (ditto about the actor being a nice guy) seems to me to be more like a human baddie than one of the Undead. His voice and look remind me more of a human gangster (from the 70's, not the 20's) with a much too serious mien than the timeless (ok, 2000 year-old) evil vampire with the sick, twisted, but funny sense of humor and irony that Nigel Bennet has bequeathed to us, the FK faithful.
I also think this version falls short of FK in that to my memory, there are no flashbacks to take you back with Nick into his past to really remind you that he is older than he looks, and that he is more then the (in this cas L.A.) detective he appears to be, but rather a product of several lifetimes of experiences.
I like Janette in FK much better, as well as Captain Stonetree from Season 1 of FK, because they each seem to have more personality than their respective counterparts in this version.
Oh well, since this eventually led to FK, I am glad that it was made. But since FK is so much better, I can't under normal circumstances recommend it. Get this only if you really want to have it to compare to FK, or you're a Rick Springfield fan, or something like that. Otherwise, stick with just the FK DVD.
As Skanke would say, Ciao.",1073606400,61,3620,4.270742358078603
444216,4,6302247837,"I remember watching this when it premiered on television.  Network television was going through one of its periodic obsessions with police procedural shows and the introduction of a vampire to the night shift of a metropolitan police force had a certain amount of appeal.
The show that finally ran (Forever Knight) was quite a bit different and therein lies some of the appeal of watching this movie-- the chance to compare and contrast.  I had just recently bought the first season of Forever Knight so I had a prime opportunity here.
This version is slicker, with an 80's rock background that has a certain retro appeal.  It was obviously shot in a warmer climate.  Rick Springfield has a lean and hungry look that contibutes to his tortured vampire character as he runs the gamut of emotion from tormented to tormented.  While probably a better actor, Geraint Wynn Davies who played the character in the series, has to fight against his sleek, blond appearance.  Somehow it is easier to look as if you have a brooding, soul-destroying secret if you are a brunette.
I also really enjoyed the contrast between Nick's starvling, blood junkie pose and Alyce Hunter, the Mayan scholar, constantly stuffing herself with junk food.  I also enjoyed her look since Wardrobe apparently dressed her from Banana Republic back in the good old days before BR became a mall shop.
Anyway, the movie is not bad at all if you are in the mood for some vampire mind candy with a bit of retro.",1070841600,71,1475,4.76078431372549

444221,3,6302247837,"I am a huge fan of the vampire genres.  From Bella Legosi to Christopher Lee to Nosferatu to Subspecies.  This was originally a made for TV movie (from what I can recall) and was playing during the week of Halloween.  As many may know, the vampire genre seems to repeat itself on occassion (well sometimes ALL the time).  The themes, plots and story lines seems to be regurgitated: Vampire is awaken from a long sleep, he seeks his bride he lost so long ago, and ends up dying at the end in the process of bringing his bride across and being deafeated by the vampire hunter/the towns people - the end.
  Well Nick Knight who is played by Rick Springfield, is a 13 century vampire trying to atone for his sins by becoming a cop in the 20th Century.  He denounces the ""gift"" given to him by his master who tries to make Nick's pretend ""mortal life"" a living hell.
  This movie initially became a t.v. series known as ""Forever Knight.""  Rick Springfield did not reprise the role of Nick Knight but John Kapelos reprises his role as Nick's wise cracking partner Schanke.  This movie was a great first attempt, but fell short for a t.v. movie.  It kind of left the viewer questioning a few things.
