8725091,5,B00IEJVUFI,"I have tried all her 4 newer workouts and this is one of my favourites. There are 4 20-minutes workouts. The Core segment is really good as it works out all the muscles in your core, not just the abs and the exercises are varied. The stretch leaves you feeling really relaxed and stretched :). But my favourites segments are the Cardio Grooves and Cardio Step. I never do these types of workout due to the choreography and because I am not very coordinated. But these ones are totally different. I got the steps from the first time and was able to work at level 3 the entire time. I had a blast doing them. The moves are not very complicated and very well taught. No burpees and mountain climbers, just pure cardio bliss!",1392595200,,721,4.388059701492537
