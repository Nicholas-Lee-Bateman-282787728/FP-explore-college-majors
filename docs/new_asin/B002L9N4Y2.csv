3945486,5,B002L9N4Y2,"Lately the Spongebob DVDs have been less entertaining, but Truth or Square is without a doubt the best Spongebob DVD yet.  I am a Patchy fan and Patchy anchors this DVD.  The cameos are impressive. You will need to watch it more than once to catch all of the subtle humor.  Thanks Nickelodeon for making a DVD that kids and their parents can watch together and both enjoy more than once.",1262995200,4,387,4.422535211267606
3945487,2,B002L9N4Y2,"I was once a fan of SpongeBob SquarePants, but the series has token a turn for the worst as of late. I feel the series has strayed away from what made it so succesful. Gone are the carefully-crafted plotlines, hilarious character chemistry, and vibrant animation and artwork of the past. Most of these elements have been replaced by overly-excessive gross humor, abuse towards Squidward that makes me feel sorry for the poor octopus, generic plotlines and bizzare new characters, and crass, overly-detailed animation.

Truth or Square was no exception. It was weak and unfunny, and failed to develop the characters as usual. While the Square Roots documentary discussing the history of our fallen sponge was hilariously funny, this episode proves that the new writers will never learn. Most of the gags and characterizations continued to be cold and paper-thin (Mr. Krabs' obsession with money, Squidward feeling almost no sympathy for SB, etc.). While it definitely showed promise, there were plot holes, bad jokes, and awful characterizations abound that kept this special from being enjoyable.

That being said, some of the bonus episodes managed to be good for the most part, a possible sign that although SB may be beginning to improve, the writers still have almost no talent at crafting overhyped TV movies. My favorites were ""Porous Pockets"" and ""Choir Boys"". It's a shame most of the others were poor and unenjoyable for the most part (""Krusty Krushers"" was incredibly weak, while ""The Card"" was gross and boring with almost no interesting parts).

If I were you, I would definitely stick with the first three seasons and the feature film, because SB has very clearly lost his touch.",1262304000,2,1692,5.079136690647482

First off, I cannot believe that Nickelodeon hyped this up as much as they did; it's surprisingly lackluster, even though it was supposed to be an intriguing tale filled with surprises. The bonus episodes are pretty good (Shame about The Card; would have been much cooler if the animated talking platinum holographic #54 wasn't just another endorsement), but for this review, I'm focusing on the actual TV movie.

Story: 7/10 - When the Krusty Krab crew (along with Patrick) are locked in the freezer on the Eleventy-Seventh Krusty Krab anniversary, they try to get out as they reminesce on all the good times they had. The trouble is, this episode shifts to the Patchy subplot (a.k.a. Celebrity Roundup) too frequently, and barely any reminescing is going on here. Plus, the 1930's SpongeBob sequence is too cheesy; they could have added in more actual gags instead of focusing on a repetitive song for the whole sequence.

Deepness: 4/10 - This story isn't particularly deep, being a shallow, soulless parody of most clip shows (which themselves can be pretty good, but are usually not). There aren't even any twists, aside from the fact that Plankton manages to get in.

Characters: 6/10 - Not particularly great; they could have done a lot more with these characters, maybe developed them as a result of them being stuck in the freezer. It would have been cool to see SpongeBob develop from an annoying brat to something more, something not so shallow. And, of course, it would be very interesting to see some tension develop between the characters (And Then There Were None, anyone?).

Entertainment: 7/10 - To be frank, this only got the 7/10 because of the interesting bonus episodes (Choir Boys was particularly entertaining to watch, especially the twist ending). If only the movie was on the DVD, the entertainment value would have gone to 3/10.

Overall: 24/40 - Not too great for a SpongeBob film. Now, several changes could have worked wonders:
*Actual moral dilemma; when an exit opens, and SpongeBob's friends are stuck, should he save them, or save himself?
*Tensions between the cast (as said before). This would have added some depth to the plot.
*Character development; seriously, a lot of these characters need some rounding out.
*SpongeBob and Sandy actually getting married; that would have been nice.
*The Krabby Patty formula actually being revealed.
*Less Patchy, more Bikini Bottom.
*More actual secrets, less ""SpongeBob AU"".
*Add substinance to the black-and-white SpongeBob sequences, although the Krusty Krab commercial was pretty funny.
*No ""O Krusty Krab"" song at the end; a rousing speech from SpongeBob would have been more dramatic, and given viewers something to think about (something about loyalty, mayhaps?).
Unfortunately, the developers ignored these opportunities, and instead made this a shallow time-waster that I could care less about. Shame, really; it seemed like a good idea.",1262217600,2,2976,5.113168724279835
3945489,2,B002L9N4Y2,"Don't waste your money and DVR it on Nickelodeon if you need to. Too much live-action. Real actors and no Bob. My son loves Spongebob, but lost interest soon after movie started. My son is 5 and has no idea who Will Farrell is. It seems to me that if your 5-yr old likes Craig Ferguson or your kids enjoyed SpongeBob in the year 2001 and those kids are now in Jr High or High school then buy this movie. Otherwise (if your kids haven't seen it yet), stick to SpongeBob Sq Pants Movie about Shell City.",1259971200,7,501,4.175257731958763

8372483,1,B002L9N4Y2,"Terrible.  Just terrible.  I normally like Patchy the Pirate, but he was terrible and should not have been in this film.  Even if he wasn't with him though, I would have given this a one star.  The plot and acting were terrible.  And some parts made no sense.  For example, Spongebob said he married Sandy, but it was just a play and even though his friends were in it, they were surprised when he said that.  This movie should never have been made.",1308096000,,449,4.337349397590361
8372484,5,B002L9N4Y2,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The animation is especially good, from the new opening sequence to the classic animation, it is all well done.  The story is sweet and the flashbacks are funny.  The icing on the cake though was the sweet O' Krusty Krab song at the end, very touching and a nice take on a classic Christmas song.

Spongebob and friends still got it!",1292976000,2,366,4.5
