8398889,5,B003KQFV28,Love the show. The DVD were in excellent quality when they arrived and worked like a charm. Although the subtitles can be a little off every now and again but it is barely noticeable. Overall I am enjoying these DVD and cannot wait to add more to my collection.,1410739200,,261,4.346938775510204
