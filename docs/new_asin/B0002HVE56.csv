2098478,1,B0002HVE56,"I love the DVD's of the show I have bought previously but it's true that they've removed Dean's songs on this set.

I know it is extremely expensive to clear the rights for music used in the shows and would not have been surprised to lose a few, but the company behind this made no effort to clear ANY as if they weren't important!

There are better collections out there. Even with the discount, I returned this one. It simply isn't as advertised and it most definitely is NOT Martin And Lewis.",1149465600,16,495,4.369565217391305
2098479,3,B0002HVE56,"I have to agree with Amanda - this set was a total disappointment to me.  I've been a Martin & Lewis fan forever and a huge Dino fan even longer.  To eliminate his songs from the set was almost sacreligious to me!  Part of watching the shows was waiting for Dean to sing his heart out!  Why this was done, I will never understand.  Also, Dean & Jerry singing ""We Belong Together"" was cut out as well.  Its nice in a way to relive the ""old fashioned"" commercials back then, but to take out Dean's songs - Sorry guys that hurt!  The only reason I gave it 3 stars was its still worth watching the two of them in action and seeing the love and admiration they had for each other.",1109721600,20,675,4.106870229007634
2098480,1,B0002HVE56,"I purchased this set of the Martin & Lewis Colgate Comdey Hour and was thrilled when it arrived because I'm a collecter of the Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis shows, and this set claimed to contain many of the hard to find episodes. If anyone has considered buying this set DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I was horrified to discover that they've edited out ALL of Dean Martin's song segments. Jerry will literally introduce Dean, tell what he will be singing, and then they'll cut away, returning to applause. Editing out the commercials is one thing, but cutting out all of Dean's songs is a MAJOR portion of the show - and a major reason why I bought them. Nowhere in the advertisements for this set, or on the actual set itself, do the producers disclose the fact that they've edited these shows and you are not seeing them in their entirity.  A few of the episodes on this set, I already owned from other DVD collections that contain the complete show. So I can say, with authority, that they've edited out significant portions of the show. Do not be fooled, as I was, by this nearly $30 set that is only partially complete.",1108598400,53,1116,4.470588235294118
2098481,1,B0002HVE56,It would be helpful if the product description included a description of the product.,1105056000,37,85,5.142857142857143

2098483,5,B0002HVE56,A must have for any Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis fan. Many hours of fun and laughter from one of the greatest comedy duos of all times!,1322438400,,134,4.0
2098484,4,B0002HVE56,This set has Martin & Lewis' comedy hour shows that they did during/right after their radio program! It's real and raw and FUN ALL OVER!!

2098485,3,B0002HVE56,Ok I can understand the disappointment's with not seeing Deans songs when you are a fan. I really watch the show for the skits. I have Vol. 2-3 of this collection (still laughing and When TV was funny) Does anyone know what the 1st volume is called? I can not find the set anywhere and the fact that I don't know the name is making it even harder. Much appricated if someone knows. Thanks.,1202169600,,389,4.27027027027027
2098486,5,B0002HVE56,"This was a gift for my husband.  It arrived in time for Christmas and is very funny according to my husband.  These are not shows I've ever seen before, but that's what makes it special.",1200528000,,186,4.285714285714286
2098487,4,B0002HVE56,"Too bad Passport Video doesn't list the contents for these. I had another set of Martin & Lewis Colgate Comedy Hours and was afraid these were duplicates. This 2-disk Best-Of collection includes:
DISK 1:
Episode #1.22 (1951) - Polly Bergen, Bob Fosse, Mary Ann Niles
Best-Of Episode (1953) - Tony Martin, Joe Lewis, Connie Russel, Ray Malone, Danny Arnold, Ira Grossel, Bernie Schwartz, Peppy Millow
DISK 2:
Episode #2.10 (1951) - Dorothy Dandridge, Danny Arnold, Bob & Eddie Mayo, Donald MacBride, Marion Marshall
Episode #1.34 (1951) - Helen O'Connell, Fosse & Niles, Ladd Lyon

These are the full Colgate Comedy Hours with all the original commercials. It's live television at its improvisational best. Martin & Lewis play fast and loose with the Norman Lear scripts but some of the finest moments come at the end of the show with five extra minutes to fill on their own. Also catch a pre-Hollywood Bob Fosse already showing his signature moves.",1198800000,22,948,5.0

2098490,1,B0002HVE56,"Get the other volume - The Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis Collection.  This current ""Still Laughing"" cuts out all the songs, the quality is poorer, and of all incredibly stupid things to do, the morons who put this out have the title of the collection on the bottom right-hand of the screen, large, ALL THROUGH THE DVDs.  Yes, it is VERY distracting.

Boycott this.",1165968000,40,360,4.59375
2098491,1,B0002HVE56,"What shows written on the description and cover of the DVD are not whats in the box. I love Martin & Lewis and was dissapointed since i already had the movies that were in the box. The movies are always great, but i am dissapointed that the movies promised weren't in there.",1156896000,18,274,4.288461538461538
8028081,3,B0002HVE56,I got this for my Mom.  This was during her era.  And she like Jerry Lewis.  And she liked Martin and Lewis as a team.  I myself liked Dean Martin as an actor.  I think he made some excellent westerns.  But I was never really a fan of Jerry Lewis.  This is four episodes of The Colgate Comedy Hour that they did.  It even has the original commercials.  They were really good at improv.  And were a good team who played off each other well.,1486771200,,439,4.0588235294117645
8028082,4,B0002HVE56,"We love Jerry and Dean, so we love this collection.  The movies are more enjoyable, but this is still funny.  All discs have played perfectly for years without a hitch.  I would recommend these to any fan.",1468886400,,205,4.486486486486487

8028090,1,B0002HVE56,"Bought the product from a NY seller which I had a bad feeling about it. The product being NEW, one would think that there is no problem with it,
I don't like to be buying something that is advertised as new bu find it is used. but found scratches, rips, dents, bad or broken box or case. After getting it, right a way before opening it, seeing the box and the condition that it was a use set of movies. I found the DVDs scratched and lose in the box with chipped pieces of the plastic, dents on the outer box, and looked like someone sat on it, not to mention some DVDs with bad sectors which causes the movies not to run properly. It was not worth $20 only worth $2.00 or less. If I had it to do over I would not have bought it. This should not have one star.",1363737600,,760,3.973856209150327
