5584412,4,B00BEIYLAW,"""Jobs"" is a biographical drama film based on Apple Computer co-founder and I.T. innovator Steve Jobs.

The narrative takes various extracts from Jobs' life, but the main focus of the story is set from the mid-1970s to mid-1980s.

Jobs (Aston Kutcher) is presented with some idiosyncrasies such as the stoop of his walk, his endless drive for perfection, displaying an own boss mentality in appropriate and also inappropriate situations, and in some instances demonstrating ruthlessness towards life and business.

The transition of the narrative from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s was abrupt, which could cause some confusion for viewers as to how Jobs has found himself in such a new situation. The viewer though can make reasonable assumptions, but a few extra scenes or flashes of events could have gone a way to eliminate any possible misunderstandings.

Apple's reinvention as a company and subsequent breakthrough products could have also benefited from a few more scenes or a highlights reel of key events in the 2000s up until its 2012 market leading valuation. Therefore if the running time of the film was increased by eight minutes (making the total 130 minutes) this could have eliminated some gaps in the narrative. That said the movie does present many exciting, anxious and satisfying stages in the evolution of Apple and also the personal growth and development of Steve Jobs.

The film was well acted and the costume and set designs takes the viewer back to the 1970s and 80s with some decent authenticity.

5584413,3,B00BEIYLAW,"Having been a fan of Steve Jobs since the 70s, view Ashton as the See's of eye candy and an alumni of the Cupertino campus, there were multiple allures that made my attendance practically mandatory. Two near full theater viewings of ""The Butler"" in 48 hours, the lackluster #7 debut on the weekend box office was not that difficult to predict with some of the worst reviews (27% Rotten Tomatoes) and less than a half dozen on a Saturday matinee in a San Francisco Bay Area showing in attendance, ""Jobs"", will come and go faster than group speed interviews.
Ashton Kutcher does a great physical reenactment pushing up Steve's built in intellectual sensuality quotient several more notches. The movie does a good job in recreating a pre-Silicon Valley South Bay landscape. There may not be any awards awaiting this cinematic endeavor, but, ""Art Direction"" and ""Cinematography"" is not out of the question.
Steve Jobs was no saint nor was he begrudgingly un endearing. The biggest flaw committed is the demonizing of Jobs morphing from a transcendental meditating hippie college dropout to a fully realized capitalist abusing and misusing the ethics of the millennium era global trade industry.",1377734400,4,1190,5.0456852791878175
5584414,4,B00BEIYLAW,"I was intrigued by this curious film. I believe it is good film making. It does not really engage you as you watch. Rather, the images and dialogue sink in after you have seen it. It sort of lingers with you. Ultimately, I liked it.",1377648000,4,232,4.177777777777778
5584415,3,B00BEIYLAW,"A great many words can be used to describe the late Steve Jobs.  Atop the list, you'd probably find innovator and visionary, followed by several harsher words that there's no need to use here.  His contributions to the technology industry are undeniable, and while he clearly had a life full of conflict, history will always remember him as the man that started a technology revolution by co-founding the multi-billion dollar company, Apple.  Today, a rough estimate projects Apple to be worth in the ballpark of $600-700 billion.  And, the odds are (since you're reading this) that you probably own a piece of technology that Steve Jobs oversaw at one point - whether it's an iPhone, iPod, Mac, or one of several other forms of Apple technology.  For all his flaws and rocky relationships, Steve Jobs managed to found a company, lose his place in it, and come back to make it bigger and better than ever.  These real life events are chronicled in the biopic, Jobs.

Directed by Joshua Michael Stern (Swing Vote), Jobs stars Ashton Kutcher as the ambitious technology marketer, Steve Jobs.  The film begins with Steve Jobs introducing the iPod in 2001, and quickly shifting to his free spiritedness as a young man during his college years.  After dropping out, Steve becomes involved with Steve Wozniak - a tech guru that has been working on a personal computer.  Together, Jobs and Wozniak - along with a handful of others, begin their quest to build a company, called Apple, from the ground up.  After the initial success of Apple, business and egos come into play as Jobs struggles to find his way in his own company.  J.K. Simmons, Matthew Modine, and Lukas Hass also star in supporting roles.

At first, Ashton Kutcher feels like an odd choice to portray Steve Jobs.  However, Kutcher will eventually grow on you, despite his slightly irritating attempt to emulate Steve Jobs' ticks and movements.  Drama is not Kutcher's strong suit, and probably never will be, but that doesn't mean his portrayal of Jobs is any less entertaining.  For the people that actually knew Jobs, it's their job (no pun intended) to nitpick about whether this is an honest portrayal of the actual man himself.  Jobs' death was only a short two years ago, so there's plenty of tape out there that Kutcher had the ability to study.  Regardless, it's pretty safe to say Kutcher's portrayal of the driven, yet easily angry innovator is not so much of a questionable acting job as it is a question of whether or not Jobs was portrayed honestly and fairly.  To the people that produced this film, they'll say Kutcher was right on the money.  Others that actually worked with Jobs have criticized Kutcher's portrayal as being a bit off.  In any event, and as far as this film goes, Kutcher's portrayal provides for high entertainment value (which is the point of a film) - especially in specific scenes, including one in which he's chewing out Bill Gates' voicemail.

Like all biopics, it's difficult to fully incorporate every meaningful moment of someone's life in two hours.  Jobs starts at a point that allows Kutcher to pass as a young college student, frankly because he still looks like a twenty year old (and usually acts like one in most of his roles, too).  From there, this film covers the most groundbreaking and strenuous moments of Jobs' life, including the moment he chose to avoid his responsibility as a parent and his constant battles with Apple's Board of Directors.  Sadly, this script (penned by Matt Whiteley) is notable for all of things that it doesn't include, instead of the moments it does include.  The most difficult moments in the final years of his life - fighting cancer - are completely avoided, leaving years of emotional experiences out of the film.

Today, people know Steve Jobs for his involvement overseeing modern technology.  However, these technical works of art and their worldwide success are only touched upon briefly (except the iPhone), while the majority of the film focuses on Jobs' spats with the people around him and his supposed ""flaws.""  Kutcher's portrayal leaves Steve Jobs looking like a man that had all the ideas and had everything figured out, but in reality he had very little to do with the actual implementation of Apple products.  He spent most of his time perfecting and then marketing other people's work - a point several former employees, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak are on record pointing out.

The supporting cast is also quite enjoyable, featuring Josh Gad as Steve Wozniak - a portrayal that is slightly inaccurate as it portrays Jobs as more a commanding figure in their friendship when that wasn't necessarily always the case.  Still, Gad does an excellent job depicting Wozniak, despite the implication that Wozniak was nothing more than a sidekick.  And, if a film needs to have a corporate villain, there's really no one better to play the part than J.K. Simmons - portraying Arthur Rock.  In the film, Rock is the Apple Board member that outmaneuvers Steve Jobs and pushes him out of his role of power, leading to Jobs' resignation from Apple.  Simmons, like the real life Rock, perceived Jobs as a ticking time bomb and felt it was better to push him out before he sank the ship.  Naturally, we now know Jobs was the saving grace and removing him from power is what fast-tracked Apple to its desperate decline before Jobs eventually rejoined the company in 1996.

Overall, Jobs is an opinionated film that depicts Steve Jobs as a bit of an evil genius that had a great deal of vision, but didn't know how to maintain working relationships.  True or not, this depiction of Jobs makes for interesting filmmaking, and will inspire viewers to do their own investigating into the man that helped revolutionize personal technology.  Ashton Kutcher is sustaining in his role as Steve Jobs, carrying the role from Jobs' college years through to the 1997 ""Think different"" advertising campaign.  However the film leaves out a great many important moments in the life of Steve Jobs, and includes several falsities.  While this is only one film's version of Jobs' life, it still tells an entertaining, made for Hollywood story of how Jobs was perceived during the years of Apple's formation and beyond.  But, the contributions of Steve Jobs are undeniably important, making it difficult to say what the world would look like today if Jobs were not the man he turned out to be.

5584416,4,B00BEIYLAW,"""Jobs"" (2013 release; 122 min.) is a biopic about the rise and fall (and rise again) of Steve Jobs. As the movie opens, Jobs is introducing a new product called iPod to the Apple employees in 2001. After that the movie kicks back to 1974 as we see Jobs at Reed College (even though apparently he isn't officially enrolled). It's not long before Jobs and Wozniak are working on a new product out of Jobs parents' garage, the humble beginning of what would become the iconic company that is Apple.

Several comments: first, the movie is in a sense a very traditional bio-pic, and I am okay with that as the story that is being told is so compelling that we don't need a lot of extra drama or glitz thrown in for good measure. Highlights of the movie for me were the scenes leading up to Jobs' removal from the very company that he started (with Wozniak), and the scene in which Wozniak comes to tell Jobs that he is leaving Apple. Second, heving read about Jobs' reputation as someone of a tyrant to work for/with, the movie does bring some of that to the screen, but overall I think Jobs get quite a favorable treatment here. Third, the bulk of the movie centers around the year 1876 to 1985, with some attention to his return in 1996. Other than the opening scene (set in 2001), there is nothing in there from 1997 on, and thus nothing about Jobs' battle with cancer, and also very little (snippets really) about his personal life. Fourth, Ashton Kutcher plays the role of his life as Steve Jobs. Indeed, Kutcher is entirely believable, right down to the way he walks. Can Kutcher gather some Best Actor Oscar buzz for this? He should! There is a slew of other great performances, including J.K. Simmons as Chairman of the Board who is trying to oust Jobs, and also a cameo from James Woods as a Reed College administrator, and Leslie Ann Warren in the blink and you'll miss it role of Jobs' mom. Last but not least, there is a really great soundtrack, including Bob Dylan of course (Jobs adored him) with ""Boot of Spanish Leather"", Cat Steven (opening the movie with ""Peace Train""), Joe Walsh's ""Life's Been Good"", and even Toad the Wet Sprocket towards the very end (with ""Walk on the Ocean"").

Bottom line: I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie. Even though it was first shown at the Sundance film festival earlier this year, there has hardly been any buzz about this. Why this is, I have no idea. No surprise then that the screening I saw this at here in Cincinnati this afternoon, was not particularly well attended, which is a shame. If you are in the mood for a quality movie that doesn't feature a comic book action here and where the world doesn't get blown to smithereens, by all means do yourself a favor and go see this movie. ""Jobs"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1376784000,6,2778,4.4990099009900995
5584417,4,B00BEIYLAW,"(The original title was ""jOBS."") This bio-pic details the corporate life of Steve Jobs, the legendary entrepreneur who founded the Apple conglomerate. The more we scrutinize his life, the more we love him AND hate him.

We see:
  * Ashton Kutcher (""New Year's Eve"") as Steve Jobs, college dropout, social misfit, brilliant strategist and ruthless businessman. This doesn't gloss over his personal failings or his intractability; it does touch on his lack of personal hygiene...smile...
  * Dermot Mulroney (""Jolene"") is Mike Markkula, the first venture capitalist to take a chance on Jobs (please see my JayFlix.net review of ""Something Ventured).
  * Josh Gad (""Love and Other Drugs"") is Steve Wozniak, one of the original garage gang who shared Jobs' dream. His departure is wrenching.
  * Lukas Haas (""Lincoln"" and he was the little Amish boy in ""Witness"") is Daniel Kottke, the long-time friend who did drugs with Jobs during their Reed College days and went to India with him.
  * Matthew Modine (""The Dark Knight Rises"") is John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to bring a friendly face into the board room.
  * John Getz (""Blood Simple"") is Paul, Steve's father, whose garage workroom they used to build their first 500 circuit boards.
  * J.K. Simmons (""The Words"") one of Hollywood's premier utility players, portrays Arthur Rock, the practical rock in the path of our impractical protagonist.

This is rated PG-13, so you can expect mild profanity and some drug use; but be prepared for a LOT of corporate shenanigans and power plays as Jobs is fired by his own hand-picked board. This does NOT probe into his foray into movie making (i.e. Pixar), his health problems, nor his marital situation. What DO we see is a brilliant, complex man portrayed by an actor who surprised me in every frame!",1376438400,7,1797,4.959866220735786

5584444,2,B00BEIYLAW,"An Excellent reminder of the Fact that Steven Jobs was not only a huge Scumbag, but that he also never really did anything REAL in his company.
He used and abused a handful of people to create value, and his company received financial backing, through investors, because of their ability to create minor innovations.

It was other companies like Microsoft, IBM, Google, etc, who took those ideas, and made them great.
Even in the past, Steve Jobs was obsessed with Aesthetics, but he never grasped the importance of functionality.

Apple is a fantastic case study for great branding, but it's a wretched example if you are looking for a company who makes great products.
I make my living in Digital Marketing, so I am no stranger to these technologies, and there is nothing that logically brings me even close to purchasing ANY Apple product for ANY reason.

They are more expensive, less powerful, less versatile, and frankly less intuitive.
The only reason people buy their products, today, is because of their clean, simple, pseudo-futuristic Aesthetics.

When Steve Jobs died, all-of-a-sudden people started acting like the world lost a great visionary, but the fact of the matter is that he was really more of a branding expert, rather than an innovator.
All credit to him for being able to create an incredible brand around a high ticket item, but it's fraudulent to act like he was a technological visionary, or some kind of a business guru, and this movie paints him as someone who behaved like an Absolute Brat 100% of the time.

Maybe that's Ashton Kutcher's idea of what it means to be Steve Jobs, I dunno, but this film only solidified the fact that this dude, and his company, are one of the most overrated corporate entities in history.
Great Brand, but they have always been out-classed by the Competitors in their field, and the same applies to Steve Jobs, himself.",1512432000,,1881,4.829192546583851

I've done nothing since, and have founded several good companies.  Fact is, he was not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but like Bill Gates - he could smell the money.  Lot's of us didn't care about that.  We did, but we didn't ""live"" for it.  These guys were different.  They had ego deficiencies that led them to believe money == success.  It doesn't.  Sure, making a living matters. But fighting for billions just means you can't leave the buffet until you've had your share and everyone else's too.  Don't be greedy, folks.  It's a dead end.  Like this movie.  It's not only inaccurate, it's depressing for those of us who made this stuff possible.  Jobs was a glory grabber - just ask Woz.  He'll tell 'ya.

5584806,3,B00BEIYLAW,"I grew up with the computer era--so the public scenes of this movie are well-read. Apple was literally founded by a couple of 'dirty hippies' who successfully took on IBM.

Unfortunately they got too carried away in their own initial successes. Competitors could and did copy their idea for the PC. Because more was compatible, Apple sales then plummeted. They had to learn to constantly stay ahead of the game, to keep innovating.

Even with the Hollywood treatment, the film does successfully acknowledge from the beginning that Jobs was no saint. He  parks in the handicapped parking spaces. This was well before his diagnosis. He was just doing it to be socially lazy. Jobs believed that as the 'top dog' he deserved front space parking.  It would have been much quicker to show him as an innovative angel. But it would not have been realistic.

Jobs isn't personably likeable--this is clear. But he did forever successfully change society. And this is what made him a revolutionary.

Ashton Kutcher can act. Have to give him credit.",1473811200,,1037,4.897142857142857

He sees his friend create the first personal computer and with sheer force of meanness and will is able to create a computer empire. Soon it is determined that he is unable to run his own company so he is kick out. He eventually returns.

Kutcher does a fine job with this flawed character who has biological parent issues as he was adopted so he treats everybody terribly including a supposed daughter who he refuses to acknowledge for reasons unknown. Famous faces appear and time period vehicles as well as a look at old school tech, swearing. See 'The Aviator' instead.",1469318400,,642,4.631578947368421

It's certainly true that the characters stray far from the real life people, except for Jobs who they made some effort to portray accurately. However, this isn't a documentary, its somewhere between an honest recreation of a story and ""this story loosely based on..."". Watching it with that understanding, I enjoyed it, I was a little off put by Ashton Kutcher in the opening scene but within a few minutes he was portraying the young Jobs and I forgot about the actor and got into the character. By the end I thought he did a very good job with the role. The supporting cast was mostly good as well, I especially liked the character of Mike Markkula, of whom I had never heard in real life. This was a fun movie, and good enough to leave me wanting more. I kind of wanted to see the process of Apple's return with greater and greater products.

5584922,3,B00BEIYLAW,"JOBS is a decent film and is pretty good most of the way.  It shows you what a perfectionist he seemed to be and at times what a prick Steve Jobs could be.  From what I can gather Steve Jobs seemed like a natural born salesmen full of charm and charisma.  He seemed to be able to tell people what they wanted to hear but at the same time drive home why they needed the newest Apple product.  You have to admire his nothing less than perfection attitude, but at the same time be realistic to what is possible at the moment.  I thought Ashton Kutcher did a very good job in the movie portraying Steve Jobs.

I thought an older movie 15 years ago called Pirates of Silicon Valley was a little bit better telling the same story, although it was kind of a short film.  When you compare the 2 films Steve Jobs does come off as a brilliant mind but at the same time very combative to work for.  Once coming back to Apple Steve was a very good CEO and brought Apple back from irrelevance to become the juggernaut it is today.  It seemed like a role reversal from when Microsoft dominated the market in the 1990s.

In the last half the movie it just seemed like Steve was trying to get back at all the people that had him blackballed and fired from the company.  Perhaps the movie would have been better off showing how Steve helped Pixar take off and how Napster helped rein vision how people swap music from albums to short downloadable singles which the I-POD excelled at becoming the premier MP3 player and buying site for Apple.

It just seems like the 3rd act of the film should have been an hour longer.  Where the film leaves off there is just a hint of what was being worked on.  The film doesnt touch on PIXAR which was one of the amazing things JOBS helped succeed.  Mainly by standing up to Disney and telling them to pissoff until PIXAR had finished their projects and were truly done with a movie and not rushing a inferior crappy movie onto the market or subpar direct to video sequels of hit movies that Disney had been doing for years.

Though the film touches on the making of the I-Mac which was moderately successful what truly brought Apple back from the grave and thumped Microsoft was the invention of the Apple I-POD.  A simple easy to use MP3 devise that had a great library of songs and artists to choose from where you could buy the songs you liked at a reasonable price of .99 cents per song.  The movie opens with the unveiling of the I-POD but does not come full circle to that point at the end.  Thus the film doesnt reach out to the I-PAD and I-PHONE, where APPLE seemed to dominate the market with every new gadget release.

Overall I would rate this a 3  star film it seems like too much is missing from the full story to really give it a 4 or 5 star film.  The acting is good it is just that the subject needed more time. I try not to give movie reviews 5 stars unless they really deserve it.  The film is good but left off far to much to be great.",1468281600,,2974,4.215547703180212

5585046,3,B00BEIYLAW,"The highlight of this movie for me is Ashton Kutcher's portrayal of jobs. He has Jobs' mannerisms down to a tee.  I never was a fan of The 70's Show -- never cared for it, never watched it -- hence I didn't have to contend with the hang up so many people have with getting past what appears to be an inextricable association of Kutcher with his character Kelso from The 70's Show.

I feel the movie falls short, however, with regards to fleshing out the deeper aspects of Jobs like the intensely private part of him mentioned by his appointed biographer Walter Issacson. (Incidentally, I highly recommend Issacson's biography of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jobs/dp/1501127624/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jobs</a>.) There were definitely a couple of very memorable scenes in which Jobs had full-on anger outbursts -- a side of him that was veiled from the public at large. But beyond those memorable scenes, the movie lacks punch. Its storyline simply feels superficial.",1456876800,2,1015,5.45859872611465
5585047,3,B00BEIYLAW,"Missing Something

It is difficult to put my finger on it. I read Steve Jobs' Bio from Isaacson which I think is excellent. Jobs (movie) portrayal as ruthless and sometimes infantile person is accurate but the book captures more of what the movie cannot: Steve Jobs Passion for his vision which is probably in the movie was stated better by the actor that played Jonathan Ives then Kutcher who played Steve Jobs (no criticism of Kutcher but of the content) .  The book captures the full Steve Jobs by using the format of the relationships with the dozens of people that contributed to the book.  With only 2 hours the movie could not do this easily;  it was just too short.  Jobs could have been a mini-series with 20 hours of episodes.  This would have allowed for the many real characters that Jobs interacted with to bring out the full Jobs persona.  Even inspiring and visionary people have flaws.  The book shows the good and the bad of Steve Jobs in full detail.  The movie could not do enough justice to the positive side of Steve Jobs.  The Movie does not cover Jobs life after 2001 which is the time when Jobs was better  still creative but with less edge.  Still I think the movie was entertaining.",1456790400,,1208,4.516129032258065

5585133,4,B00BEIYLAW,"Disregarding the subject of the movie, the selection of events and message of the movie weren't as conclusive as they should have been. It begins with Jobs introducing the iPod in understated heroic fashion, progresses through his life showing him as a cold-hearted cad, then leaves with him regaining control of his empire- and make no mistake, Jobs saw Apple as 'his', in spite of the multitude of talent who built it. Is he the hero the opening suggests? Does he live the ideals he records for marketing at the end or is it an act of self-denying hypocrisy?

Jobs begins as a hippie in the truest sense: wandering, exploring, trying to find meaning and answers. He returns from a trip to India noticing the differences between cultures, but doesn't embrace or bring back anything spiritual from the trip, other than perhaps a new diet plan. As the company grows his friends notice he becomes less interested in people and more interested in product.

Through the film we see Job's maniac quest for perfection, cold corporate politics and a string of friendships damaged by his inability to be... human. As much as I like his vision, it's hard to watch a man lose his humanity and only wear decency when it benefits him. It's easy to celebrate his products' successes, and even easier to give him the bulk of the credit but we're celebrating luck- Apple succeeded in SPITE of Job's disregard for people. Ironic that he made gadgets 'for people'... people he would throw into the street if they told him he was the father of their child. He had a daughter and, true to form, completely abandoned her. It's fair to say his real child was the i(everything), which isn't a warm one and fits him best.

The sets and costumes were outstanding. Kutcher and the supporting actors did a great job; perhaps too good. I will never look at Apple the same.",1456099200,,1845,4.67076923076923

5585230,4,B00BEIYLAW,"While this movie may have been panned by the press, it actually is the better of the two Jobs-centric tech movies.

Ashton Kutcher did a great job with the character of Steve Jobs. Josh Gad's portrayal of Woz (yup, the same guy who plays Olaf in Frozen!) grew on me as the movie went on (I have seen Woz in person and while he wasn't really close in terms of accuracy, he did do a nice job acting). Most of the other actors did a great job as well, and it was nice to see lesser-known personalities like Chris Espinosa, Jef Raskin, Mike Markkula, and Dan Kottke in this film. Missing, however, were Ron Wayne and Bill Atkinson (although Atkinson's name does come up in conversation).

There were a few technology inaccuracies in this film. There were Apple IIe computers used in place of the Apple II+, plus Macintosh System 6, released four years after the original Mac, was shown on the original Mac's screen (although the computer, perhaps prop, of the original Mac did have the correct badge from the rear). The Apple III wasn't in the film at all despite being the company's biggest early failure. For the most part, the technology used was correct.

Unlike the newer film, this one focuses almost exclusively on the company and the men who ran it. There isn't as much about the personal life of Steve Jobs, and, again differing from the 2015 film, this one shows a positive relationship between Jobs and his daughter, Lisa, when she is on screen. There is much more accuracy here.

The biggest reason this film loses a star is because it forgot a few key people and had a few minor inaccuracies. However, this one is the film to watch of the two Steve Jobs movies. Pirates of Silicon Valley is more accurate for general information about the early days of the industry and the Walter Isaacson biography is the way to go for the best biography of Steve Jobs, but this film does a nice job of capturing the highlights and personality of Apple's legendary co-founder.",1451347200,,1970,4.572237960339943

I think that Kutcher, much as I dislike him, absolutely nailed Jobs' mannerisms and the movie is worth seeing for his performance alone.  Also notable were Josh Gad as Steve Wozniak, Matthew Modine as John Sculley, and Dermot Mulroney as Mike Markkula. The production values were very good and really put you back in the era.

5585470,5,B00BEIYLAW,"I have viewed this movie twice since I received it.  It is a great movie about Jobs life and his experience in the business world.  It is so sad that he is not with us any more but he apparently came to earth in order to give us something that we all needed.  It is odd that Paul Gates was creating much the same thing for mankind over in the Washington State area.
  I am happy with the life that the computer gave me and the students that I taught.  It is a remarkable thing --the computer.  The move gives me flashbacks of my own college days and my short life in the business world with IBM as the computer that was so mysterious in our office building.  I worked punching cards for an insurance company before I began teaching art to kids in a Catholic school.  I even did the yearbook by hand until the computer changed all that information gathering for the final outcome of the yearbook.
  I hope to see the new movie about Steve Jobs that will be showing in theatres in October. This Jobs movie staring Ashton Kutcher is a keeper.  The story line is fast moving and has just enough of Steve Jobs private life to make me want to read his biography.

5585525,4,B00BEIYLAW,"Jobs, 2013 film

It begins at a Staff Meeting in 2001. A man walks into an auditorium to applause. He tells about sales that year. There is a secret project, it plays music. [Did it fill a need or create a need?] Then its back to the past, 1974. Steve had dropped out of college. A teacher gives him advice. He meets a girlfriend, she has small plastic bags. There is a picnic in the country. They show computers from that era. Life is a journey. There is a trip to India. Steve works at ATARI in 1976. Does he work well with other people? Somethings got to change. It does. A friend solders a board to save him. This is good! [But it is a simple game.] Jobs visits Woz, hes creating jokes. He can connect a keyboard to display characters on a TV monitor (first done in the mid 1960s). [Before this they needed Teletype machines that printed on paper.] Nobody wants to buy a computer says Woz. [Not if it provides real benefits to the customer.]

Jobs picks a simple name for their computer. They tell of the benefits of their micro-processor. Paul Terrell wants to talk business. Who? They bargain over price for the units. Then they find a shop, then helpers. Paul explains customer needs: take it out of the box and plug it in, like a radio or TV. Steve says to sell it like a kit. [This reduces labor costs.] Rod Holt the technician arrives. They need a 40 watt power supply that is quiet and doesnt overheat [a quieter fan?]. Steve tries to find a financial backer. $50,000. Steve is upset by failure. Mike Markkala visits, he worked for Intel. Steve knows how to make a deal. The must first incorporate to protect their interests. Steve rejects his girlfriend rudely! Daniel offers advice. The West Coast Computer Faire shows products. In 1980 Apple has a proper office and factory in Cupertino. [Silicon Valley?] Steve wants a new design, like Lisa.

Drop down menus are an example of ease of use [and built-in documentation]. One employee is summarily fired for expressing his opinions. He didn't share the vision. [Would you like a manager like that? Theyre not all like Jobs. The best programmer may be the one that knows the real problems.] So fix it! A lawyer explains Steves options in his personal life. Steve assigns rewards: Daniel gets nothing, so too the others who were in from the start. [Power corrupts?] Why did he do it? Woz explains himself. Steve shaves his beard, the company goes public. In 1982 men in suits visit Markkala with a complaint about Steve. The Board removes Steve because of his policies. [Should grammar school students have computers? Do they, like video phones dumb down students? What does the evidence say?] Steve is given a new project - the Macintosh. Ease of use is the criteria so everyone can use it, like an appliance.

Jeff lacks the proper attitude. New members are recruited, Steve explains his vision. The Board questions Steve, he wants a marketing expert like John Sculley. He will sell what they can do - a tool for the mind. In 1984 Apple competes against IBM. They show that famous TV ad! The Board supports him. But Sculley identified a money problem. Steve has a problem. Later he views a Microsoft product. Blatant rip-off? You stole it! he tells Bill Gates. Ill sue for every cent! The Board discusses the economic facts. IBM beat them to market by two years with a better product and sales. Is it the price or the product? The Apple II sells well. Steve blames others for the failures of the Macintosh! Woz is leaving for good, he comments on the situation. Steves telephone calls are not returned. Is he his own worst enemy? The CEO makes a decision. Steve wants changes. He is warned by Markkala. The votes are counted. Sculley. Now what do we do?

Steve returns to his parents home and shows sorrow. In 1993 Sculley is removed due to falling share values. A new CEO was in turn replaced. Steve works in his garden. We see his family life. In 1996 Gil Emilio wants him back at Apple. Things are going bad, he returns. Can the damage be undone? Steve wants new creative and useful designs. The share value is dropping. They want him as CEO. A new product is considered. Steve tells of his vision for the future - a new generation. Steve is back as CEO. He tells about his outlook on life. Members of the old Board are gone - golden parachutes. [What did they contribute?] Its time. What are we going to do now? Steve responds. Are those who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do so?

Steve Paul Jobs 1955-2011"" is the ending. They show what must be photographs of the actual people with their movie versions. [Is close similarity the same as authenticity?] This is an interesting movie that gives a history of Apple computers. How accurate is it (or any Hollywood movie)? To learn history read books, this movie is entertaining. This is like some tragedy where a man succeeds, then fails, only to return to his previous status and then dies. Its worth watching, but runs on too long. It tells little of the era and why a personal computer found a market. No mention of spreadsheets and their use. A PC could do what a person needed without the higher cost of a mainframe computer. Its like the way trucks and automobiles replace railroads.",1436918400,,5240,4.5396825396825395

Ashton Kutcher was under appreciated in this role. He should have gotten an Oscar nomination at least. The film is about show Apple began from a house and ambitious California college students to revolutionize the world with technology.

The casting was perfectly done to capture the real person's physical features as seen in the credits. Too bad, there were not that many or any female characters in that group.

The film includes Dermot Mulroney, Oscar winner J.K. Simmons, Josh Gad as Steve Wozniak, and others. The film is about two hours long. There are deleted scenes and behind the scenes about how Kutcher became the right actor for Jobs and the score as well.",1428969600,,949,4.809815950920245

5585746,4,B00BEIYLAW,"The thing about biopics, especially one about a guy with as deep of a background as Steve Jobs, is that you'll never cram every down-to-the-bone accurate detail into one movie without boring your audience to the point of self-harm. It's still a movie, and it still has to tell us an interesting story. ""Jobs"" checks off most of the major landmarks of Steve's life (from Reed College to the iPod) at a steady clip, while still managing to find its center in a surprisingly captivating performance by Ashton Kutcher (whose striking resemblance to a young Jobs no doubt proved just as much of an advantage as his acting).

It's hard to tell whether the supporting characters were too wooden or simply outshined, but given the turbulent history of not only Apple but Steve Jobs himself, it's little wonder why we're never given much time to connect with any of them. As for how Steve is portrayed -- anyone with even passive knowledge of Jobs/Apple know that he was deeply flawed as a human being, and we're shown that. While the film can be sentimental in places, it's not a tug job. You're not supposed to like him all the way through.

But to be fair, there is a bit of a downside in the somewhat shallow script (if I recall correctly, Daniel Kottke and Steve Wozniak both thought it was terrible). I'm not a tech guy by any means, but I thought it would have been interesting to hear a little more technical jargon thrown into the dialogue and maybe a little more of a focus on some actual product development. We're shown the development of the Apple I and Macintosh respectively, but mostly in montage with no real dialogue about the specs (which would have made these feats of technology all the more impressive to a casual viewer).

Bottom line: Don't go into this expecting a re-enactment of a courtroom transcript or a police report (or a clone of The Social Network). It's not a documentary, nor is it a substitute for doing your own homework. Go in expecting an interesting story, some good acting, impressive cinematography, and maybe even a little bit of inspiration.",1425168000,,2077,4.669398907103825

5585750,3,B00BEIYLAW,"(1) Ashton Kutcher did a great job portraying Steve Jobs. He was a big reason I liked the movie. Well, him and Josh Gad who portrayed Steve Wozniak - probably my favorite character in the film.
(2) The supporting characters and background story lines were either well fleshed out or minimally acknowledged without much in between, which tended to leave me with unanswered questions. Considering the amount of material there was to cover and the seeming complexity of Jobs as a person, the movie just couldn't cover it all. The movie primarily focused on the business (Apple) side of Jobs' life but, given the overall message/story the movie was going for, pieces of Jobs' personal life did have to be pulled in from time to time. These pieces had to be quick but sufficient enough to make the point they were trying to make. The efforts to pull that off were good but ended up making the movie feel a bit jumpy.

Overall, I enjoyed the movie. The actors did a good job with it, I learned some new things, and I was entertained. I'm not sure I would watch it again but it's worth watching once if you're interested in learning about Steve Jobs.",1424304000,2,1143,4.575609756097561

my only disappointment with this film is that it left out (for me) some really key elements to the story -- e.g., the genius of the monumental ""1984"" SUPERBOWL ad by REGIS McKENNA; raiding the braintrust at XEROX PARC (specifically key guys like alan kay, the ""father of the personal computer"") to develop the mac's breakthrough iconic user interface design; the clash with microsoft over WINDOWS (this was barely a footnote in this film, but the bloodletting in court was epic!); the dark days (almost lights out at apple) under jean-louis gasse, who is not even mentioned in the film; etc., etc. ... i lived thru all of that and knew some of the key players like alan kay, paul brainerd at aldus, and john warnock & chuck geske at adobe ... so those ""misses"" were big gaps for me ...

Bill Gates visiting Apple HQ shortly after MS announced Windows and Jobs exploding on him, in person, in fact, Gates was not portrayed in the movie at all which is odd for the one Titan who paralleled Jobs rise in the tech industry being sorta Batman to Jobs's Joker.

Jobs dedication to Buddha and meditation which shaped his infatuation for aesthetics.

Jobs obsession with collecting records and recordings from Dylan, Beatles, etc

These are a few examples but the point is, though Kutcher did an admiral service in the role, and even distilling a movie down to the most significant aspects and occurrences of his life, it is impossible to cram all of the complexities of Jobs's life within 120 Minutes. It would be much better to have done a 3-5 episode TV mini-series (keeping Kutcher in the Role) as the early part of Steve's life prior to Apple going public could have easily filled 120min alone",1413590400,,1054,4.904494382022472

We see Jobs messing about in the garage, and then suddenly we see him running Apple as a large corporation.  There isn't much exploration of all the grueling effort that went into building that corporation.

Details matter to Him, because the small things are just as important as the big things. So in the end you have an Amazing Product.  Another thing is most people are living by other peoples standard. Your living your life by what others expect of you. That's not living, Choose now to become who you want to be and you will become happy and succeed. Also if your working on a project or whatever it is you have that one person who does not share your vision, you must get rid of them because its impossible to make something happen if he doesn't believe in what you are doing.

A lot of the nuances of Jobs were perfectly portrayed through Kutcher, and a lot of the dialogue from this movie was sourced from the actual Steven Jobs himself.

If you already know a lot about Jobs, then the story may come out to you as mediocre, because it is impossible to fit the whole life tale of Jobs into one movie with the same perfection that you may have come to expect through reading.",1405468800,,677,4.459677419354839

There probably were stretches of misinformation ( I am reading the biography), but for cinematic authenticity, I think the production did a pretty good job.  There is so much more about the culture, time and life that Steve Jobs lived.  The book is, obviously, more complex.  The people surrounding Steve Jobs are pointed to in the movie.  The book fleshes them out and gives them personality.  Yet, all in all, I would recommend you read the book and then watch the movie.

This movie, what I assume from some internet research on the man, takes a realistic apporach of his college years through the revamp of his company in his late years while still being very engaging.

Much of the time it felt like watching a hammed up caricature of Steve Jobs.  Also, I know they cannot stuff too much into a movie, and they wanted to cover the early days and the return of Steve Jobs to Apple after his having been evicted and after having founded NEXT.  But it was nonetheless a let down to see the movie end there, and not cover the period during which he launched iPod, iPhone.  I felt sad watching this:  Steve Jobs deserved a whole lot better.

5586311,4,B00BEIYLAW,"Steve Jobs cared passionately about his computers- his onetime girlfriend and their lovechild- not so much, although he named an early computer for that daughter. This DVD is worth seeing for the bonus features alone. The commentary by director Joshua Michael Stern is full of insight and helpful back story.  For example, without the commentary, I would have assumed that the garage workshop portrayed in the film was simply something arranged merely for convenience. Instead, we learn through the commentary that the garage IS the place where Apple began.

Anyone with the slightest interest in the computer as an icon of modern American needs to see this film.

5586312,2,B00BEIYLAW,"I am always prepared for the worst when seeing ""historical"" motion pictures, as the film makers always have a vision or agenda that sacrifices actual historical content.  This is a good example.  The main takeaway was successful, Steve Jobs was a complex, driven, and not altogether easy person to deal with.  Ashton Kutcher did well in this role, better than I thought was likely.  However, this one was clearly a Jobs worship movie, that made too little of the rest of the technological contributions that made personal computer development possible.  The Apple II and macintosh were great contributions that involved some good original thinking, but stood on the shoulders of developments made by Ed Roberts (MITS-Altair), Pre and early Microsoft (Gates and Allen), IBM, people at Xerox who were eventually pulled into the Apple fold.etc.  And too little was made of Wozniaks great design work. Always frustrating to watch bad history - does it somehow cheapen the story to tell it right?  But the film makers wanted more of a worship movie than a telling of history, so enjoy that for what it is.  Definitely worth the rent, and it is a good message about how eccentric personalities are really necessary in shaping a future no-one else would gamble on.  Jobs passing left a huge vacuum in the world of technology, so we will miss him, and wonder how things will evolve from here.",1402358400,,1384,4.880341880341881

5586316,3,B00BEIYLAW,"Jobs is a biographical film about the late Steve Jobs,the founder of Apple Computer. The time line of the film includes from his hippie days in the 1970's to his return to Apple as CEO to help the company rise from the brink of bankruptcy and leading them to becoming worth almost $500 Billion and become the most valuable company of the United States.

After watching the film myself,I was extremely disappointed that we never got to know more about Steve Jobs the person but the screenplay focused more on the history of Apple Computers. Despite the fact that it provides the viewers a great deal of information with regards to his professional history from his days to Atari up to his days to becoming the head of Apple,there were many episodes in his life that were left behind like his activities at Pixar and NEXT.Added to that,we never got to see what made him become a great leader that helped his workers achieve great results. Was it his charisma or better yet was he competent tyrant?It never provides that answer. What we are treated to in this film is the rise of Apple from its humble beginnings to becoming one of the prominent companies in the world. Also,we get to see how Jobs manages to help the company to resurrect from the brink of filing bankruptcy into becoming the most valuable company in the country after his return to the company in 1997.
His personal life is barely addressed at all like his adoption,his relationship with Steve Wozniak, his arrogance, and the sudden changes that happened to him later in his life. Also,we don't get to learn more about his rivalry with Bill Gates except when he yelled at him over the phone. It was definitely a missed opportunity.

What's worse, Ashton Kutcher's lack of acting ability is in full display. Despite the fact that he tried his best to look like Jobs and acquire his mannerisms for the film,his portrayal of the man was can be classified as incoherent and clumsy. He acts like a lunatic instead of someone who is man that is highly emotional and characterized by an unstable personality. In the end,one would only hope that there would be a better biopic released about Steve Jobs in the future.",1401840000,,2174,4.658854166666667
5586347,3,B00BEIYLAW,Glad we read the biography first.  Worth the watch.  It was a bit disjointed but covered all the major players.,1401667200,,111,4.5
5586348,2,B00BEIYLAW,"Whether or not you hate or love the late Steve Jobs, the man made a huge impact on anyone who uses an electronic device (and who doesn't?!).  That's why it was so disappointing and depressing to see that the hipster mentality has triumphed in ""Jobs"" at the cost of substance and good writing.

What is the hipster mentality? The idea is appearance is everything - that if you wear 1970s vintage clothes, sideburns and mustaches, play 70s music and go barefoot, you will have captured the essence of Steve Jobs.  With Ashton Kutcher in the lead, the illusion was complete - I felt I was watching an extended version of ""That 70s Show.""

Jobs is not so much a person in this biopic than a collection of postures, 70s fashions, and occasional bad behavior (symbolized by Jobs yelling into a phone).  Surprisingly, Ashton is not the worst choice to play Jobs, but the script (or lack of) defeats him, and he's reduced to staring intently at the camera (to show Jobs' textbook ""intensity""), copying Job's way of speaking and walking, of course, with a noticeably stoop-shouldered gait.

Sadly, the filmmakers have no desire to reveal the ""real man"" behind the image. This hero-worshipping film promotes Job as a Christ-like figure (he even spins in a cornfield, arms outstretched, as if receiving God's message) whose ""genius"" and ""vision"" is unquestioned. This propaganda refuses to pander to non-converts by showing or explaining what made Jobs so special.  We are supposed to act on ""faith"" that, of course, Jobs is a visionary, like Moses.  To preserve this mystical vision (idols aren't supposed to be indebted to anyone or anything), we learn little about  his family background (he was half-Syrian and adopted) or what drove him to break rules, betray and create (see ""the Social Network"" as a great example of how a writer can do this). His successful stewardship of Apple is told more like a fairy tale than a realistic, gritty account of a survivor of the dog-eat-dog business world.

This misty-eyed sentimentality and vagueness, so characteristic of the hipster's lack of real-life toughness, ruins the film. Instead, the filmmakers devote loving care to recreating Atari's 1970s-80s office, complete with nostalgic glimpses of ""Breakout"" and ""Pong"" games. We are asked to marvel at the cool, oversized glasses everybody wears. Apparently the director was so happy with the results that he couldn't resist showing it off to the audience - stay for the film's closing credits and you'll see a montage of side-by-side shots inviting you to compare the real 1970s person and the Millennnial-made imitations.

If you want to see a Madame Tussaud's Museum in action, watch this. If you want the real Steve Jobs, read his print biography. He deserves better than this.",1401667200,,2769,4.971861471861472

5586441,5,B00BEIYLAW,"Steve Jobs was such a brilliant and eccentric man.  I have always admired him, and I attempted to read his extremely lengthy biography, but found it very tedious.  Watching the movie was the perfect answer.  Ashton Kutcher was very believable in his role as Jobs.",1399939200,,263,4.8
5586442,4,B00BEIYLAW,"First, let me say that I have no use whatsoever for Ashton Kutcher. In the past, I've gone out of my way to avoid any and all films or television shows in which he appeared. I'm not sure why, but I just don't care for him as an actor.

With that said, I do care very much about the history of personal computer technology. I've read many books and seen many documentaries about the beginnings of the industry. I'm especially interested in the story of Apple Computer. I was an early Apple adopter, back in the pre-Internet days when the company advertised only in dorky electronic hobbyist magazines. Back in the late 1970s, I bought a 64K Apple II with two 5-1/4-inch external floppy disk drives, a CRT monitor and an Epson dot-matrix printer. I used it mainly for writing, with a laughably primitive word processor called Apple P.I.E. (it stood for ""Programma International Editor""). I also learned how to write programs in assembly language, a couple of which I sold through magazine ads.

So, my interest in the subject of ""Jobs"" overpowered my distaste for the work of Ashton Kutcher, and I checked the movie out of the public library. And y'know what? It's very good. I enjoyed it a lot. Based on everything I've seen or read, Kutcher nails the role of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs better than any other actor could possibly have done. It's high praise indeed when I say that I sometimes had to remind myself that this guy on the screen was NOT the real Jobs but just an actor playing the part. He's that good in the role.

Of course, as in any biopic, the creators of ""Jobs"" took a fair amount of dramatic license with the facts. The story of Apple Computer is long, complex and convoluted, and certainly NOT simple enough to tell in a two-hour movie. That's okay, because once I decided to treat ""Jobs"" as strictly entertainment and not a factual documentary, I just relaxed and enjoyed it. It is very well made, well photographed and visually spectacular. Even better, the dialogue is understandable (a rarity these days), the volume level is consistent (ditto) and the music score is unobtrusive.

If you want to know the story of Apple Computer in detail, read some of the scholarly or popular books out there. If you want a broad-brush, somewhat two-dimensional treatment of the life of the company's creative genius, and don't mind the simplifications inherent in the medium, then watch ""Jobs.""

As much as it pains me to say this: ""Good job, Mr. Kutcher.""",1399852800,,2468,4.67741935483871
5586443,2,B00BEIYLAW,"Of all the Jobs biographies, this one was by far the most negative.  It was not an uplifting telling of the story.  It was not inspiring.  I found it to be a downer.

I was very surprised after watching this.  I really did enjoy the movie.  I think one thing to remember is that you can't really recreate events that actually happened in film.  You can get close to it and I think this film did a great job in its ""representation"" of what happened.

If you want to hear from the man himself ""Steve Jobs"" watch ""The Lost Interview"" from 1996 in it's entirety.  You really get an idea of what this man was like.  Also, ""One More Thing"" is another great documentary from the people that new him.  Very candid stories of how he liked you, used you, and abused you to get what he wanted out of you.

I read the biography on Steve Jobs and was fairly familiar with the general flow of his life. Yet I had a hard time following this film. Compare this with Social Network, which took more liberties with the Mark Zuckerberg story, yet made for more compelling drama.

Ashton Kutcher is also very good in this role. I've always associated him with meathead roles but he embodies Jobs here - both in looks and mannerisms.

The movie does have a HBO cable vibe here. Maybe it should have been a mini series instead of a film. Anyway, this is a pretty good movie.",1398902400,,522,4.360824742268041

5586478,1,B00BEIYLAW,"This movie is a big letdown. I'm personally a huge fan of Jobs and I have been fortunate enough to accompany much of his late career (his return to Apple in 1997, the original iMac, the release of the iPod, all the subsequent ""i"" hits) and it's safe to assume that rarely did history display a visionary CEO as this man was, with the guts to call the shots against Wall Street's blind and uncontrollable greed, following his own passion and intuition instead of some fleeting hype, and refusing to go along with nonsense ideas for the sake of money -- an advise this movie should have followed in the first place. Sadly, it did not.

Kutcher's physical resemblance to that of Jobs' is a plus, but that's pretty much what you are gonna get from the movie. Apple's remarkable story is told in a very sluggish tone and it certainly misses the beat ... And to say movies were actually better than real life, uh?

I thank YouTube for letting people upload this crap. If anything, my star goes to them.",1398729600,,996,4.467032967032967

5586480,3,B00BEIYLAW,"Ashton Kutcher gives a reasonably convincing performance as Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.  Given that this is a Hollywood treatment rather than a documentary, it is natural to assume much of the focus would be on the more sordid events is Job's life and that's what we get.  The film covers a period which essentially begins in Jobs' parents' garage and concludes with the announcement of the i-Pod.  The movie provides little depth into the whys and wherefores of Jobs' growth as a man.

Co-founder Steve Wozniak (Josh Gad) is the technical genius who provides the counter-balance to Jobs' sense of how things should work and how the public would perceive them.  Dermot Mulroney plays Mike Markkula, an early investor who tries to guide the company from a business perspective.  Like many driven people, Steve Jobs expected his people to work as hard as he did.  It would appear no personal life was allowed.  For some this seemed to be expected, but for others the work was about getting a paycheck and Jobs had little use for them.

The performances are all very good, but I was a bit put off by Kutcher's attention to the physical quirks of Jobs.  That is, the kind of lumbering gait, the pursed lips and lack of eye contact were a bit distracting.  In the end, ""Jobs"" is a mildly entertaining film that tells us little that we already didn't know.  Steve Jobs was a visionary genius...and a real jerk.

The Blu ray disc comes in 1080p with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The movie looks good enough, but this is no great beauty.  Some of the color tinting seemed a bit off, but perhaps that was intended.  Given the era, the sets looked authentic if bland.  Still, I could detect no real flaws or artifacts.  The audio comes with a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option, which much like the video is perfectly acceptable but nothing Earth shaking either.  Not much going on in the surrounds except with the outdoor scenes.  Special features include some deleted scenes, 3 very short featurettes and a commentary with director Joshua Michael Stern.  Subtitles are available in French, Spanish and English.",1398470400,,2103,4.754143646408839

5586553,4,B00BEIYLAW,"I think biographical movies are very hard to make and the makers can safely assume that no matter what they will never be able to please anyone. Making a film on a famous figure such as Jobs is a daunting task and it is almost impossible to capture all the various facets of the multi talented man who was brilliant and short lived in a movie that is only two hours long. Social Network was an example of a movie about the creation of Facebook and David Fincher came close to making a perfect movie. Jobs had a life that many complexities and it was not ordinary by any standards...he was adopted, could not adjust to societal rules due to his callous behavior even to close friends and kin. The brilliance and cruelty of the man is very briefly touched , so are his many achievements in a film that can only serve as a basic introduction to the man called Steve Jobs.
The director Joshua Michael Stern makes an abridged version of Jobs life without giving any deep insights in character and personality if that suits you then this is a good film but if you are looking for deeper insight - you must wait and hope that the upcoming  Adam Sorkin directed drama gets it right.
The naysayers who thought that Ashton Kucher would not be right fit as Jobs should be somewhat satisfied as Kucher relishes the role as Jobs, he brings the right amount of youthfulness and maturity. I thought Kucher did well.
This is an ok film as there as so many fundamental  details in Jobs life that needed to be analyzed so that we would have been able to understand Jobs the man and the film just failed to do so...
Such as
1. Why was Jobs so callous to his daughter and how did they make up years later?
2. Who is the woman that becomes his wife?
3. His relationship with his parents?

The only time I thought Jobs had some some humanity was during his interaction with Steve Wozniak as he plans his departure from Apple Computer.

5586555,2,B00BEIYLAW,"Kutcher got Jobs' mannerisms down pat, if perhaps overly stylized. But the narrative storyline is deficient. Jobs is portrayed as part madman, part prophet and sage.

There are plenty of moments in the movie that are enjoyable -- particularly the ""early days"" with Woz et al. -- but the movie drags on and on with its quasi-Messianic tones.

The end of the movie was anti-climactic... tragic, perhaps. It doesn't develop Jobs fully such that we can cheer for the man who got back the company he loved and lost. It doesn't show how he grew wiser, calmer, and more patient in the process. It doesn't show how he tried to master his own demons. There's no redemption; no personal growth. (A movie that takes artistic license with history should at least improve the story.) In the end, we see a little man trapped in a very lonely, self-centered existence.

5586661,3,B00BEIYLAW,"Steve Jobs was a multifaceted individual. He excelled as an industrial designer and appears to have struggled with personal relationships. The film is simultaneously inspiring and disingenuous. The film is inspiring because Jobs wanted to make computing more aesthetically appealing and accessible and intuitive to use for citizens. The film is disingenuous because Jobs' heroes-Ghandi, Einstein contributed to human progress in a more significant way than the introduction of consumer devices-the liberation of a nation of people under colonial oppression and the discovery of the Theory of Relativity-does the introduction of iPhones, iPads, and iPods adequately compare while discussing human progress? Also, a truly revolutionary device would be open-source not proprietary as are Apple's products. For instance, music purchased in the iTunes music store cannot be played on an Android phone-unless it is converted to another file format and Apple's format is removed. Apple's bludgeoning of consumers to use Apple's ecosystem and Apple's ecosystem only is not revolutionary. Consequently, users cannot change the batteries of their iPhones without visiting an Apple technician whereas an Android owner can merely remove the back of their phone's case and swap a battery they ordered online in seconds-for a product that claims to ""empower the individual"" this film is a propaganda piece for a particularly egregious corporation that cannot bear to allow individuals to undertake certain Do It Yourself(DIY) tasks.",1397779200,,1518,5.721238938053097
5586662,1,B00BEIYLAW,"There is one scene in ""Jobs"" that perfectly defines the film: Ashton Kutcher (playing our hero) is having a very obviously fake phone call with Microsoft's Bill Gates, threatening to seize 90 cents of every dollar Gates makes. I wonder how that worked out for him... Since the film features many, many scenes of verbal sparring in conference rooms, it would have been fun to see Jobs at least engage Gates as a contemporary. It's lazy and disingenuous, but the same can be said of the 45 minutes or so that bookend this painfully embarrassing scene. So what am I supposed to find charming about Steve Jobs? The dismissal of his unborn daughter? The way he cut most of his friends out of Apple? He's not a sympathetic character for me. Not at all. If you need to see a great story about an eccentric tech geek, by all means check out ""The Social Network"". That film featured good actors playing smart, talented people trying (mostly succeeding) to do the right thing, even though technology starts moving so fast, their intentions can't keep up. In ""Jobs"", the smart people are trying to talk him out ruining his company by meddling in a project and causing another fatal delay. I thought they had some pretty good points, but hey, they wear shoes and have business degrees, so I dunno.

This journey concludes with Jobs voicing Apple's famous ""dare to dream"" promo spot. I was dreaming of the end credits rolling, which is exactly what happens seconds later. And that's it. Faint mention of the iMac, or how Apple reimagined themselves as giants in the personal gadget industry. This frustrating movie is simply about Steve Jobs' voracious appetite for control, not his visions or dreams, or what life really meant to him. It's a real shame, a wasted opportunity for the filmmakers. I have no doubt that Steve Jobs' life story would make a good film, but this one sure isn't it.",1397779200,,1878,4.6909090909090905
5586663,3,B00BEIYLAW,"An interesting movie which makes a good attempt to show the type of man that Steve Jobs was. He was a highly driven and obsessive man and at the end of the day, not a very pleasant person, clearly shown by the way he just discarded people who were no longer of use to him without a second thought. But he died young, probably from the stresses of his lifestyle, so never had the opportunity to really enjoy his life and at the end of the day, what did he really achieve? Nothing that helped the human race one iota, just a company that sells over-priced gadgetry that nobody really needs.",1397692800,,588,4.306306306306307

The only problem with this movie is that it seems to jump around a bit with his life and sometimes leaves you wondering if you missed something.  Don't worry, you don't miss anything, but it just feels that way.  One minute he's single and doesn't want a family and the next scene he's married and has kids.

He started a small company to promote car polish because he needed the money.  He told me after running his business for a couple of years.

5586906,4,B00BEIYLAW,"While watching this movie, I found myself being a little critical about this and that, you know--all kinds of things, mostly details. Then I realized: I'm not pressing ""pause"" OR ""stop""! That says something good about this film. I'm sure there are lots of things that aren't accurate, and they can be annoying or distracting. But this is a movie, not a documentary. The alternative to its having some ""inaccuracies"" is to not have this movie at all, as it's impossible to make a 100% true-to-fact biopic. As for me, I am glad this movie was made, and I think it's smart and well-conceived.

The above statement aside, I am a detail person. I notice things like right/left handedness and the changes in style of jeans, including Levi's. But if you get hung up on these kinds of things, you will not be able to enjoy this very good film.

There is a lot of criticism about the film from people who know more about Jobs than I do. Like not having anything in it about Pixar. I watched/listened to the directors commentary and learned that this film was intended to be about Apple. Perhaps it should have been titled ""Apple,"" unless maybe that name was taken by some other movie.

You have to come to terms with the knowledge that this movie was made from a point of view. It's not intended to be a film version of an encyclopedia article.

That said, I saw somewhere that Steve Wozniak has had some criticisms about the accuracy of the movie, especially the roles of and conversations between himself and Jobs. Now, those comments might be worth a listen.

I rented this movie from one of those tardis-like red kiosks. After watching it, I wanted to watch the commentary, but it was NOT THERE, as you have to actually purchase the disk to get that. And sucker that I am (glad to be one, this time), I bought the disc set from Amazon. (Tip: I got the Blu-Ray version, and the commentary did not work from the menu. I found it, though, by changing the audio track, using the remote).

The director's commentary offers lots of interesting insight. I'm glad I purchased the movie, just for it. It was a little annoying that the director says ""sort of"" and ""kind of"" over and over, in a similar way to how people used to say ""like"" (He says that a lot too!). I noticed that same exact thing of another commentator for a totally different movie (if you want to know, it was ""All is Lost""), and wonder what the deal is. Despite the ""sorta/kinda"" annoyance, both of these commentaries are extremely well done and very interesting.

I like how the scenes from the seventies were not overdone, for instance the glasses, big hair, and home decor of the day. There was just enough of all of that to suggest the time but not to distract from the story line. And that Ashton Kutcher lost and gained weight in order to more accurately play the different ages and sizes of Jobs! This actor's performance mimics the real Steve Jobs in so many ways. For instance, he totally nailed the walk.

And that the house used in the film, the one with the famous garage, is the actual house where Steve Jobs grew up! How cool is that?

Anyway, great film, I think. If you want exact historical accuracy, though, you won't find it anywhere! For something close, though, watch a documentary (I think there are already one or two available), or even check out Wikipedia (but don't get me started on that)...",1395446400,,3374,4.518032786885246

I don't know much about him (other than the ""Pirates of Silicon Valley"" movie I saw many years ago), so I can't speak to how accurate it was.  But Ashton Kutcher did a great job of translating the Steve Jobs as I understood him, warts and all.

Another thing about this movie that surprised me is that it takes you through how cut-throat corporate life at Apple was.  Again, I don't know how true it was, but all I knew was that Jobs was one of the founders, got the boot and came back to the helm until he got sick.  But for a company that was supposedly based on positive ideals, things got UGLY at Apple (at least, that's what they movie shows).

So, while it's probably a thumbnail sketch of Jobs's story, it's a fun tale to watch for anyone who wants a glimpse into a company that brought about a lot of technology that re-defined our lives.

5587071,4,B00BEIYLAW,"JOBS takes us back to the early days where the Macintosh computer came together from the most unlikely sources.  Steve Jobs had the ability to take ideas that to others seemed unimportant or eccentric and combined them into a new invention that set the tone of how we use computers today. All of the innovations he came up with were copied by other companies. The film takes you back to the early days in the 70s and reminds us of how primitive computers were in those days. how huge the first Apple designs were in comparison, and Steve's constant striving for perfection. We also see how trust in one man that was supposed to nurture Apple turned into a disaster.  If the film deserves any criticism, it might be how lightly the turnaround days at Apple were treated and how brilliant those days were.  I felt a little cheated at the end because I wanted to see a bit more of those days, but in general this is a challenging film for anyone that has ideas that are not immediately accepted by the establishment that rarely have any vision of their own.",1394150400,,1054,4.479166666666667
5587072,1,B00BEIYLAW,It always best to read the book.  More facts and details are vivid.  I think they could do a better job in making this movie.  There were a lot of important detail and significant events that were left out.,1394064000,,206,4.230769230769231

5587074,3,B00BEIYLAW,It was alright. I don't like how it stopped after he made the basic iPod. I think it should have showed all the way up into his death.,1393977600,2,134,3.8214285714285716
5587075,4,B00BEIYLAW,very interesting story regarding what made this genius tick. Kutcher did an excellent job of portraying this nutsy genius. Maybe cause he is one himself!,1393891200,,153,5.16

5587077,5,B00BEIYLAW,"It's a great movie, if miss Steve Jobs and want to know more about him, or if you're fascinated by geniuses and successful people, what makes them tick, and how they achieved what they did.  Ashton Kutcher did a masterful job of portraying Jobs.  I've seen it twice and look forward to watching the special features, which I can do now that I purchased the DVD.  The special features were available on the rental version.",1393804800,,421,4.586666666666667

Ashton Kutcher nailed it as Steve.  The story stayed on course and didn't have side stories to distract from the main story.  I rented this movie,  but, am going to buy it so I can watch whenever I want.",1393632000,,352,3.9714285714285715

5587249,5,B00BEIYLAW,"Great acting, really captures the characters and draws in the audience.  Even though the lead character is less than charming, one gets insight into the loneliness, grandiosity, torment, and huge sense of limitless possibility that he lives with while at the same time becoming more informed about all of the fallout on friends, family and the company.  Wouldn't have chosen this so am really grateful to friends who recommended it.",1393632000,,432,5.1571428571428575

5587253,1,B00BEIYLAW,Was worse than we heard.  No character development at all.  Turned it off 3/4 the way through. Would not recommend.,1393459200,,115,4.7
5587254,5,B00BEIYLAW,"I knew Steve in the early 80's and felt this movie captured a reasonably good sketch of his personality.  Interesting for me to see how Hollywood cast someone that I personally knew - and I'm glad that I picked it up.  I sure don't remember Steve walking like the movie, but he was so charismatic and passionate about what he was doing that his face absolutely radiated enthusiasm.  That is what I remember most about him -- and I think the movie hits a reasonably solid note.",1393286400,,476,4.448275862068965
5587255,5,B00BEIYLAW,"Incredible Performance and uncanny Portrayal of Steve Jobs by Ashton Kutcher.  I'm not really an Ashton Kutcher fan, but his acting was really gritty, and superb!  I honestly didn't know Ashton Kutcher had this depth of Character!  Superb!  The Movie is a compelling portrayal of a man who was a true pioneer entrepreneur and rags to riches story we all know.  This movie shows Steve uncensored in his humanity, and was very gripping more because the acting was so convincing and the story so riveting.  Honestly I expected to be disappointed here, but felt we really got our money's worth in this a Rental!  And then some!",1393286400,,623,4.766355140186916
5587256,2,B00BEIYLAW,"My personal opinion: it stunk. If any of you want to see a more credible version of this computer era get "" Pirates of Silicon Valley"".
In ""Jobs"". Steve doesn't even put his hands on the project, Wozniak is doing all the work. In reality, Jobs was breaking laws while he was in college with some sort of invention which bypassed the telephone company with a scrambler.",1393113600,,368,4.507462686567164

5587339,1,B00BEIYLAW,"Bad acting, bad soundtrack, bad storytelling. It's hard to screw a movie like this up, but they managed it. I recommend reading the biography. Next time cast based on charisma and not based on looks.",1393027200,,199,4.714285714285714
5587340,1,B00BEIYLAW,"It's the exact lifeless retelling you would expect. Kutcher is not even humorously bad as Jobs, just occasionally funny. Not worth a rental.",1392940800,,140,5.130434782608695

5587343,4,B00BEIYLAW,Ashton K was very good in this biography.  I think most people know the story but it was exciting to see it acted out.  The ending was abrupt and didn't demonstrate his entire life to the end.,1392854400,,192,4.162162162162162
5587344,2,B00BEIYLAW,Felt like it jumped around too much... I didn't read the book though.  Movie seemed like it was missing parts of his life.,1392854400,,122,4.304347826086956

I love Apple. I'm typing this on a MacBook Pro and love my iPhone. It was interesting to see a version of the story, even though I hear this was pretty much mostly made up.

They should make a horror movie to show what MIGHT happen, now that Jobs is not leading the company...",1392768000,,368,4.097222222222222

People like me, and other ""everymen,"" as we were called in the movie, wanted to see pretty much everything after the story ended, the development of the Ipod, and so on.. Even his death.. But, I still liked the movie, and Kutcher's performance.. I think the movie needs to be recut, personally.. There's a lot of filler, early, which could have been used better, possibly to enhance the story beyond 1996?.. I don't know?.. lol..

Pleasantly surprised by Kutcher, who is in every scene.. And it's his performance that lifts this movie from the surrounding material..",1392508800,,634,4.711711711711712

5587414,4,B00BEIYLAW,"Jobs hits the right points about Steve Jobs career making the movie a treat. I love biographies when they're done right. Kutcher actually delivered a good performance behind this interesting genius. I beleived him and that's hard to pull off. How accurate the movie was I don't know, but I don't care, I really enjoyed the film. I liked seeing the old Apple computers and set pieces too. If you get a kick out of movies like Cinderella Man, LaBamba, J.Edgar, then you should give this a chance. It's interesting if nothing else.",1392336000,,528,4.688172043010753

5587416,4,B00BEIYLAW,"This film does well by not falling victim (too much) to an Apple fanatic's fascination with one of its founders, indeed showing some of his unsavory and uncouth side from early on in his career. I too have to say what another critic had to say about the film, in that after a while you wonder why you should care to follow the exploits of such a character any further after about halfway through the picture (or less). This is indeed just how disconnected ""the rest of us"" can feel from the man who thought he knew exactly who we were and what we wanted.",1392163200,,554,4.285714285714286

5587528,4,B00BEIYLAW,"Acting was pretty good.  Especially Josh Gad.  I think that Ashton Kutcher looked the part but maybe overplayed the role a bit.  I don't think the movie was very accurate and I doubt that some of it ever really happened.  I understand that they embellish actual events in order to make movies more interesting.  It focuses on the early years of Apple until early 2001 (from creation of Apple to the first iPod).  I don't think of Apple as very innovative but it was interesting to learn more about Steve Wozniacs role early on.  Basically, no Woz - no Apple computers.  The movie did keep my interest but I was hoping for more.  Overall I liked the movie.  I watched it because friends of mine said it was actually pretty good.

5587532,4,B00BEIYLAW,"Loved the movie.  Only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 is for the swearing.  It is in context and makes sense for the story but I wouldn't have too young of kids watch it for the sexual lifestyle portrayed and the swear words.

Amazing story of an amazing individual who, like all of us, must overcome our shortcomings despite the brilliance inside.  Reminds me of the quote, 'They don't care how much you know, until they know how much you care.'  True words for any leader.",1391990400,,472,4.379310344827586

5587605,2,B00BEIYLAW,"This movie is basically a shell of a movie, with no more insight or information than a wiki page. It tries to convince the viewer otherwise with manufactured importance and violin swells. I'm a huge fan of Apple, and respect the artistic visIon of the late Steve Jobs, so I was willing to meet the movie halfway. But the movie literally goes nowhere, and leaves the viewer with a picture of Jobs as nothing more than an abusive, narcissistic jerk. It never explores the question of what really drove him. Just look to a movie like The Social Network to see how this is done. In that far superior movie the events are just a framework to tell a deeper, more emotional story. Jobs has none of this. Horribly edited and scripted, even the most dramatic beat, his fall and eventual return to Apple--perfect 3rd act hook--is dispensed with a throwaway scene of Jobs angrily pulling weeds out of the garden at his palatial mansion. It's all missed opportunities and hollow machinations. Ironic, given Apple's success being so rooted in its ability to connect to people emotionally through technology.",1391558400,,1094,4.7936507936507935

5587688,3,B00BEIYLAW,This movie depicts Steve Jobs as a man with a  genius and strong drive to succeed. It also shows him as a person who did not mind humiliating people working under him. Some scenes made you feel sorry for his immediate co-workers.,1391385600,,229,4.4523809523809526
5587689,2,B00BEIYLAW,"I think Ashton Kutcher did a great work in portraying him as mean and rotten person. I did not know what Steve Jobs was like so I cannot say if it was accurate. The movie portrayed him as ruthless but did not show his human side. I think he was a complex man with much more to him than his tenacity for Apple. They skimmed over a lot of things to focus on one side of him. They skipped over all his accomplishments after he took over Apple the 2nd time. They skipped over his deals with Bill Gates, starting NeXT, having love and a family, his battle with cancer, having a long lost sibling and biological mother and father, becoming a Zen Buddhist. They just showed him as an irate and ruthless man.",1391385600,2,700,4.231343283582089

I've read many books on Apple and it's just a part of my childhood and life.  I was very sad when Jobs died (like losing a childhood friend if that makes sense.)  Anything about Apple I will almost always watch (which is why I ""rented"" this movie.)

Ashton did an OK job as Jobs but I felt it was a little over exaggerated.  Also, the NON-STOP dramatic music in the background of virtually every scene became very distracting after the first 30 minutes of the movie.

I feel the movie was thrown together and rushed to the screens to capitalize on Job's death.

I think had some more time been spent this could have been a really good movie.",1391299200,,764,4.256944444444445

5587696,3,B00BEIYLAW,"My wife and I watched this movie.  It was worth watching.  However, I found it somewhat disturbing and sad.  I was surprised by the manner in which Steve Jobs was portrayed.  Considering his brilliance, vision, and compassion, he created his own problems by challenging corporate executives and dismissing those who did not completely understand his vision and compassion.",1391126400,,372,5.362068965517241

5587828,5,B00BEIYLAW,"I watched this film with great skepticism which turns out to fortuitously have not been needed.  Background:  I'm an an electrical engineer and VC and know Arthur Rock.  I was building 8080 computers in high school & college in the 70s when Woz & Jobs were coming up with Apple. at Vector Graphic, one of the seminal microcomputer makers.  I never met Jobs or Scully.

I fully expected to be let down, but instead was instantly sucked in by the performance, the drama without hype, and the *realness* of the pic.  It feels like ""the (Silicon) Valley"" was, and to an extent still is.  It gets the vibe right, and the feel right including board meetings which movies almost inevitably totally miss with melodramatic overacting.  I've been through plenty of board room dramas, it comes with the job description, and this nails how stuff like this really goes down.

5587913,3,B00BEIYLAW,Kutcher's performance was worthy but the story is condensed like most biopics. There's no childhood and no struggles with cancer its more along the lines of work. This movie could easily have been called Apple instead of Jobs since it revolved so much around that one aspect of his life.

5587915,3,B00BEIYLAW,"I have to echo the opinions of most viewers here, and say that that though the acting in the film is awesome, the storyline left a lot to be desired.  Kutcher does an amazing job as Jobs (no pun intended)--he's stubborn in some scenes and breaks down in others.  The title character doesn't come off as likable at all, but the role demanded a lot from Kutcher, and he delivered.

The most heartbreaking scenes were when he turns his back on his pregnant girlfriend, and when Wozniak leaves Apple--both showed a sort of hardness that was a far cry from ""That 70's Show"".  In the first, Jobs refutes paternity of his unborn child, coldly refusing to talk to his girlfriend, but privately erupting into a burst of anger and frustration--seemingly directed at himself.  In the latter scene, Jobs is working late in the deserted Apple headquarters when Wozniak interrupts him to inform Jobs that he's quit Apple; Jobs shows little emotion for his friend and it turns into more of a monologue between Wozniak and the audience.

While we're on the subject, Wozniak is the one who I really rooted for in this movie, even though he was relegated to more of a sidekick role for the greater part of the film...in the movie, he was the likable and comedic foil to Jobs' stubborn and unyielding leader, but even as a relative tech outsider, I get that there was probably more of a story there than what was observed in the film.  Can we have a movie about him?

The storyline itself was pretty disjointed--it began with his college years and ends with the iPod launch, with some parts in between more or less skipped over.  It's not a movie to learn about him, but more to mildly entertain and give the gestalt of the image that he wanted to be.",1390521600,2,1732,4.543408360128617

5588270,4,B00BEIYLAW,"Jobs overall as a movie is better than the critics. It may not be perfect, but overall in my view it was interesting to watch it. Ashton Kutcher did a great job as Steve Jobs. From all the critical criticisms I thought maybe JOBS was going to make me dislike him and Apple, but it did not. Especially, the beginning and ending is sort of inspiring to fellow entrepreneurs and dreamers to always keep innovating. It would have been enlightening to have seen some more of the deeper details and reasons for some things such as why he had such a drive. JOBS was mostly an overview of early Apple, so this would have been a good part 1, although there probably won't be a part 2 of this JOBS, thus four stars. It could have included more from scene one in 2001 until 2011 at the end of JOBS, and it did not. Now I'm going to read a book on Jony Ive to see if there's some more details in there on the innovation of all the Apple iProducts. It's not a cheerful movie, as it's slightly dark and intense due to his being driven, with some inspiration here and there. The people who liked his Stanford commencement speech and use iDevices are glad Jobs did not listen to the critics and stop having innovative ideas. I'm glad I did not listen to the critics and watched JOBS.",1389830400,,1267,4.283333333333333

5588365,3,B00BEIYLAW,"You generally watch a film and lose the actor's true identity while doing so.  Not here.  It was Aston Kutcher all the way. Here, you get the  feeling you are watching acting class 101 with brand new recruits, rather than a major motion picture.

  In the first place, we have lots of footage of Jobs to see and know the man thru film.  He didn't walk with a slump and his signature turtlenecks and jeans were not even portrayed in the film.  He seemed like a quiet, impassioned man, perhaps capable of arrogance, but I doubt seriously the portrayal was honest.  No engineer would have stayed with him to create the technology if he had treated them as portrayed.  Jobs needed these designers more than they needed him.  Did he want them to be on-board and play by his rules, yes, but not to the extent that he abused them daily.  The director actually seemed like he had some personal vendetta against Jobs and tried to portray him as a psychopath, liar and immoral man.  For one, Job's reaction to his girlfriend getting pregnant is akin to many men, especially young men,  who don't accept responsibility.  It is not indicative that he was intentionally cruel.  For someone with a dream, having a child at the wrong time with someone you don't even love is tough, which is why women should be circumspect in choosing their partners.  And making sure to portray Jobs as a cheater when he paid his co-creator less money than half, was, is, well, pretty normal behavior for a man.  Right, guys? Anyone? If you don't believe me, consider personal injury attorneys who pay themselves 40% of a handicapped client's court award after a life changing event.  If that is not immoral, what is?  Yet, we consider that just the cost of doing business.

Then there was the ""timeline and whole chunks of life not even mentioned"" factor.  For example, they state that 3 million computers were sold during one year and yet portray that Jobs had an entire campus filled with thousands of employees in cubicles.  I doubt with that number, they could have afforded to hire thousands of employees.  Then we basically leap from Jobs being ousted and fast forward to Jobs living in a mansion and being asked to return to Apple.  I personally would have liked them to portray his accomplishments during that time period as well.  He went on to create other businesses which he sold for megabucks.  My guess, is that the script was poorly written as well as directed.

While I get the feeling that Steve Jobs would be laughing at the film, were he still alive, it is sad to watch this and really know nothing about the genius behind the scenes.  It appears in everything that I have read or seen, jobs was an intelligent, impassioned man, not a psychopath as portrayed.  However, I guess if the film were actually serious, they would not have chosen the Nikon commercial actor, which by the way, is where Kutcher fits best, in a non-speaking role.

5588518,4,B00BEIYLAW,"If facts portrayed are accurate, the move gives a better understanding of the unique and creative mind of Steve Jobs, as well as his extremely strong work ethics and dedication to a product he so strongly believed in.  In addition, Again if true, his extreme  passion for his work proves that passion is the key to success, no matter who you are.",1389484800,,346,4.564516129032258
5588519,3,B00BEIYLAW,The story line was sporadic. The film didn't capture the essence of true creativity in the man. It glossed over the rudimentary facts and gave a nod to some Hollywood style pretension.,1389484800,,184,4.78125
5588520,5,B00BEIYLAW,"I was a fan of Steve Jobs and regardless of his leadership style he was inspiring and influential. When I read that Ashton would be playing him I was shocked. Took me a long time to get the film because of that. What can I say now? Ashton NAILED it. He can act? Yes, fantastic performance by him and the entire cast. Will watch again.",1389398400,,334,4.153846153846154
5588521,5,B00BEIYLAW,It was a great biography and storyline.  Kept you interested all the way throughout the movie and loved Aschton's performance.,1389398400,,126,5.3
5588522,4,B00BEIYLAW,"I was hesitant to watch the movie ""JOBS"" because I enjoyed the book so much. To my surprise I found the movie highly entertaining and fun.  The movie covers very little of the books content but what it does cover is excellent.  The movie does not deal with the iPhone technology or JOBS death.  I always ignore ""Hollywood Reviews"" and am very glad I over looked their snubbing of this movie.  Kutcher played the Steve Jobs role well primarily his depicting of  Steve Jobs many quirky behaviors.",1389312000,,494,4.632183908045977

5588524,2,B00BEIYLAW,"Ashton Kutcher did a good job of portraying Steve Jobs.
Jobs obviously had some very serious personal issues to go along with his business genius.
The movie was not as comprehensive as anticipated.
Very disappointed.",1389225600,,216,5.2
5588545,4,B00BEIYLAW,"With Ashton Kutcher starring in this I went into it totally expecting to hate it.  I couldn't see him as Steve Jobs after seeing the earlier biopic movie with Noah Wylie.  I was wrong - Kutcher was awesome and completely believable as Jobs.  We enjoyed this movie a good bit.  It was a bit sketchy in regards to the details behind Jobs' relationship with his daughter, Lisa, though.  The movie would have been more complete if there had been more on that topic.",1389225600,,461,4.506024096385542
5588546,4,B00BEIYLAW,"definitely slanted but entertaining nonetheless. i am surprised that more attention was not brought to the film, but can understand why with kutcher's performance.

i liked the mini-series that i think aired on USA or TNT with Hall and Noah Wyle told a bit more comprehensive view of the story.",1389225600,,294,4.88
5588547,4,B00BEIYLAW,"Kutcher redefines himself with this role. I really enjoyed watching the growth, successes, and losses and difficulty. That culminates in a kinda ""return from Elba"" moment. If you like documentaries you'll enjoy this film.",1389225600,,221,5.529411764705882
5588548,4,B00BEIYLAW,Jobs is a good movie. I was surprised not to see any other of his accomplishments. All in all it was a decent movie.,1389225600,,116,3.875
5588549,5,B00BEIYLAW,"Was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Ashton Kutcher, of whom I am neither a fan or not. The recreation of the scene of Jobs premiering the ""1984"" commercial was stunning. I would have liked to have seen more about the engineering side of the struggles for perfection that defines Apple and their ascension to making so many outstanding and popular products. Being a long time Apple owner, I was hoping for a different angle than they took; I will admit that I was mistaken in thinking that it was about Apple, it was, of course, about Jobs. Overall I would say it was pretty objecive - he was no saint. No devil, either. At least he did not get to where he was on the skirt-strings of his IBM mommy. Look it up. I misspelled objective to give some of you something to complain about other than your spoiled dream that Microsoft will ever stop raping the world with their junk. Good Film.",1389139200,,897,4.475609756097561

5588551,3,B00BEIYLAW,"Rushed through the story, trying to squeeze in too many events. At the same time didn't even touch on the iPhone, and only briefly on the iPod. Kutcher was better as Jobs then I had heard.",1389139200,,188,4.25

5588553,4,B00BEIYLAW,Read the book and wanted to see the movie version.  Felt the movie Jobs was probably more passive than real life Steve. Movie was believable.,1389139200,,141,4.64
5588554,4,B00BEIYLAW,Very intetesting to see the life of Steve Jobs but left us wanting more....to see the rest of his life.,1389139200,,103,4.2
5588614,2,B00BEIYLAW,"Terrible writing, wooden and obvious dialog; nothing is left to the imagination, yet some details just aren't explained (eg: what is NExT, when did that happen?)

The pacing is hurried, and the film could use a better edit.

Two stars for the historical aspect and surprisingly good cast; Ashton Kutcher does a commendable job, and is supported by better actors.",1389139200,,362,5.016666666666667
5588615,3,B00BEIYLAW,"Kutcher captures the look and mannerisms really well.  He falls a bit short on how charming Steve could be, which is how he got away with being such a jerk so often.  He could turn it on and off at will.  Woz is a miss by a mile.  Ditto Markkula.  And the Rod Holt in the film is from a different planet.  The story is told with typical Hollywood accuracy - somewhere way short of 50%.  Which is a good thing, because parts of the real story wouldn't make a good movie.  But nobody should come away thinking they now know the history of Steve and Apple.  As an example, Woz was revered by the Homebrew club.  The audience would have been hanging on every word, not walking out yawning.  Also, the boardroom intrigue bears little reality.  Most of the board members were very distant from the day-to-day.  Steve tried to stage a coup and said ""him or me"" and they said ""him.""  But again, that doesn't make an interesting story.  Despite the myriad artistic liberties, the film brought back a lot of memories, good and bad, and it captures some of the flavor of the early Apple days.  But you'd be better off reading the Isaacson bio if you want a more accurate story.",1389139200,41,1166,4.3534883720930235
5588616,4,B00BEIYLAW,I thought the movie was good. I enjoyed watching it. Ashton Kutcher looks like Steve Jobs. I think I will read the book now,1389139200,,123,4.166666666666667
5588617,5,B00BEIYLAW,"Totally enjoyed this movie - always admired the mind of Steve Jobs but understanding the challenges that Apple faced and the constant need for someone to believe in the vision, is what this movie is about and what propelled Apple forward.

It was not so much the group of individuals whom if left on their own would have given up or quit to go elsewhere or started some other enterprise but rather; it was Steve Jobs the keeper of the flame, the instigator, the dictator and sometimes wayward friend who made the company the unique success it became.

He deserves all of the credit and some fair amount of the blame during Apple's rise, fall and resurection but make no mistake about it -  Apple is Steve Jobs and Steve Jobs was Apple.  Excellent story, excellent movie with very believable acting.  Rent it!",1389139200,,808,4.6223776223776225

5588620,5,B00BEIYLAW,"I was never an Apple fan but always loved computers.  After watching Jobs, I have a new outlook on Apple Computers.  I was totally drawn to the movie and story of Steve Jobs.  What a Genious !!!!  I can see where some people would condemn him for his treatment of others, but he had a purpose and it wasn't personal.  He controlled situations, and commanded perfection.  Do it right the first time and you won't have to do it over and over and over.  I loved this movie !!!  Ashton was totally convincing the you were watching Steve Jobs!  I'd love to see a second movie except I know how it ends and that's the sad part.  It's as if Steve Jobs was born for a reason ... and after those accomplishments was taken away.  Kudos to the team that brought Jobs to the screen !!!!
 I highly recommend watching it .... again and again!",1389139200,,828,4.2709677419354835

5588665,3,B00BEIYLAW,"Maybe Jobs hasn't been gone long enough to make a movie of his life?  Maybe it was the script.  I wasn't moved by the characterizations of Jobs.  When they complained of his offensive hygiene and smell,  his shirt looked too freshly pressed and his barefoot feet looked weirdly clean.  This was sort of a soulless and voyeuristic look into the life of Jobs.",1389052800,,357,4.603174603174603

I've seen bad reviews of this video, and quit frankly those people wanted an insperation... an Icon... something to say this guy saved the world.  Steve Jobs gave us a lot of wonderful tech, however, he had failings just like the rest of us.  The one thing he gave all of us (if you payed attention to the movie) was don't let people water down your dream on it's way to reality and watch for those who use their money and your drive to take you off coarse so they can gain power.",1389052800,,544,4.262135922330097

5588701,4,B00BEIYLAW,Ashton Kutcher does a great job (pun intended) in this film. The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that the movie is a bit choppy and omits a couple of significant contributions Jobs made to Pixar and Disney.,1388966400,,206,4.175

5588744,3,B00BEIYLAW,"Jobs covers some aspects of a fascinating character's personality and some of his notable accomplishments. Ashton Kutcher captures the appearance and much of the public cadence of the persona of Steve Jobs, but he did not/cannot capture the inner workings of the genius of the man. The legendary rants Kutcher depicts are just that: rants. Jobs passions were unleashed as cries against the inability or unwillingness of lesser mortals to grasp and acknowledge his concepts, but Kutcher's performance does not express the desperate need Jobs must have had to galvanize all those around him to his vision of what was possible.

Because almost everyone connected with Jobs is still alive, it was probably impossible to get permission to portray a very good close-up of the man. The ultimate irony is that the first movie to portray this uberperfectionist is a good film..., but not a great film.",1388880000,,892,5.068027210884353

People take his role in this life for grant-it but our lives would not be the same if he never existed.  Android would not be copying, superseding now, his ideas nor would have Microsoft back then and now.  Maybe down the road but not now.

5588879,4,B00BEIYLAW,I'm not a Jobs biographer so I can't say how accurate the whole movie was.  From what I've read the major parts regarding Apple seemed to fit.  The acting was really good I thought Kutcher did a good job.,1388620800,,204,4.205128205128205

5588881,5,B00BEIYLAW,I grew up in the same area and time of this story. Very well shown how difficult it was to change the minds of corperate comerce at that time. Showed how smart Steve Jobs was and how difficult it was for him to make people undrestand his visions at times.,1388534400,,255,4.12

5588967,5,B00BEIYLAW,"I thoroughly enjoyed this video. Gave a view of Jobs that showed he was no angel, but also showed the drive and ambition he had to succeed. The depiction of corp. infighting was, in my experience, an accurate account of what goes on at that level. Anyone aspiring to be a manager should carefully study this video.",1388448000,,314,4.526315789473684
5588968,5,B00BEIYLAW,"The movie was about a man who never quivered, relinquished, or gave up on his vision.  He may have been difficult to deal with and a perfectionist, but he did get results.  This is a well made movie that keeps you attached to the plot both mentally and physically so if you have any doubts about this movie or want to know more about the man called ""Jobs"" then check this movie out.",1388448000,,382,4.219178082191781
5588969,4,B00BEIYLAW,"Ashton Kutcher was excellent in this role.  He nailed Steve Jobs' demeanor and mannerisms.  The movie was thought provoking and a great reminder that our lives are only limited by what we believe we can achieve.  Just because something hasn't been done before doesn't mean it's impossible...

While Steve Jobs apparently wasn't a quality human being, what he accomplished through his vision and passion can't be denied.

The movie ends with the introduction of the iPod...I only wish it covered the last 10 years of his life as well.",1388448000,,533,4.943820224719101

5588971,4,B00BEIYLAW,"For those of us that grew up when personal computers were being developed, the movie will bring back memories of the early day. Ashton Kutcher plays the role of Steve Jobs effectively.

Nice people don't always get the dirty work done. The established system will resist ideas outside the walls of their little kingdoms. Jobs shows us those walls are not permanent  or indestructible.",1388361600,,462,4.775
5589014,5,B00BEIYLAW,"This movie shows what some in business know, one must be obsessed to make a mega product and that there are repercussions of that striving and success.  My grandson once asked me why people could not just have a genius idea and business people just recognize it and support it.  My answer was, many people have genius ideas but without incredible drive and energy (obsession) to make it into a power product it will not happen.
This is a great teaching movie. Ashton did a great job!",1388361600,,483,4.540229885057471

5589017,3,B00BEIYLAW,I though the story was good since Steve Jobs is interesting but the movie just lacked something. I previously watched a documentary about Jobs that I thought was more intriguing than this. Not a bad movie so I gave it 3 stars but I can't say I give it more than that.,1388275200,,267,4.153846153846154

5589022,2,B00BEIYLAW,Just felt that the movie was lacking a certain umph.  Storyline was smooth and acting was good but I never felt really hooked into it.  The music was the best part!,1388275200,,164,4.258064516129032
5589023,3,B00BEIYLAW,That the movie covered.  I thought they should have told the story about the full lenth og his life rather than a segment as they did.,1388275200,,134,4.153846153846154
5589034,3,B00BEIYLAW,It was good but not great.  More details needed.  Was too simple for a biography.  Especially a biography about Steve Jobs.,1388275200,,123,4.761904761904762
5589035,4,B00BEIYLAW,"I actually liked Ashton K in this. It was not perfect, some things over done and other things underdone but I like how they set the scene in the 70's, the garage, the young kids putting it all together and captured what I have heard and read about steve's passion. There were some inspiring moments so I thought it was worth it. This kind of movie is really hard to pull off so I was not expecting much and thought if they could get the crux if it right and make it interesting then it was a good purchase. It would have been interesting to go deeper into all of the relationships and non-relationships of his family - The father he met at a restaurant but did not know it was his father; a little more on how he reconciled with his daughter Lisa that he originally denied; his sister, real mother, etc. Also would have been good to see the respect and relationship he had for his adopted parents. The film hinted at it however, this is a wonderful part of his life - adopted parents so dedicated. most likely there was not time.",1388188800,,1029,4.282051282051282

5589037,4,B00BEIYLAW,I thought the acting in this movie was great. With a different cast I don't think they could have pulled it off. Loved the movie and portrayal of a great man.,1388188800,,158,4.129032258064516
5589038,3,B00BEIYLAW,"Mostly, we were all disappointed that the movie did not span more of his life.  Being at HP very near the time Woz took the computer in for their review, I knew that there was no parking garage at any of the HP Silicon Valley facilities... but at least they got the right version of the logo for the time.  Read the book if you want the whole story.",1388188800,,349,4.043478260869565
5589039,2,B00BEIYLAW,"Not an entirely poor movie, but it felt to me too thin and insincere. The thing that drove Jobs was randomly and thinly stated, but I never felt a strong sense of that drive in this story. Nor did I ever get a significant sense of the man's genius. The performances were adequate, I suppose--insofar as such a superficial script would allow--, but I think the casting was significantly off.",1388102400,,390,4.585714285714285

5589042,2,B00BEIYLAW,"Ashton Kutcher just strings together the entire Apple myth. The problem is that many of the keynote presentations can be found online, and the source material, is not surprisingly, better than Ashton's dramatizations. Unlike The Social Network or Pirates of Silicon Valley there really isn't any heart to this movie. Apple Co-Founder Steve Wozniak on Bloomberg TV has pointed out many of the flaws of the movie. There isn't any great dialogue in the movie and if you followed Apple's press releases you have heard much of the dialogue before.

Kutcher's  mannerisms were too distracting as he projected old Steve Jobs mannerisms on the young Steve Jobs. It's anachronistic, and gets in the way of telling a good story. For example, Steve didn't walk in that way bouncy way before he started wearing New Balance shoes in his old age. Don't agree? Just look at the keynote presentations on youtube.  Even if you buy the mannerisms, his portrayal of Jobs is over the top with fan boy appreciation. It's as if he wants you to believe that STEVE JOBS IS THE GREATEST MAN IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. There is no nuance in his performance. Steve Jobs invents everything, causes everything it's all Hallelujah choirs in between the of montages building computer boards.

What movies should you watch then? The best dramatization of Steve Jobs is still&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pirates-of-Silicon-Valley/dp/B0009NSCS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pirates of Silicon Valley</a>&nbsp;. Steve Wozinak said about the movie  ""personalities were very accurately portrayed"" Steve Jobs said of Noah Wyle's portrayal of Steve Jobs ""you were good"" and that ""you do look like me."" but hated the movie which was a classic Steve Jobs comment.

Best documentary is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Triumph-of-the-Nerds/dp/B00006FXQO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Triumph of the Nerds</a>&nbsp;a brief history of the computer by Robert X Cringely who was an early Apply employee but tells a much better story than this movie. It also has extensive interviews with all of the major players. It has Bill Gates in his prime circa 1995 and Steve Jobs while he was still in his wilderness years with NEXT who was down and out of Apple but still was defiant as ever.",1388016000,3,2324,5.532394366197183
5589043,5,B00BEIYLAW,"Seemed to me that the acting was spot on. About Kutcher: I never thought for a moment I wasn't looking at Jobs.
For me, this movie raises the interesting question: does the successful entrepreneur at least for his day and his industry have to have had such a demonic, monomaniacal, and narrowly scrupled personality to acheive success? He fashioned his industry and market before the consumer there was a need.  He created, and then was devoured by what he created, and then he emerged again.  So, is this the kind of personality you need to acheive this end?",1388016000,,559,4.6938775510204085
5589084,4,B00BEIYLAW,I have been using Apple since way back in the 90's.  I wanted to see how it all came to be.  This movie portrayed that I assume.  I was hoping to see more of how some products came to be.,1388016000,,187,3.625
5589085,3,B00BEIYLAW,"There is no doubt in my mind this needed at least 10 minutes edited out.  Ashton Kutcher certainly looks the part on the surface, but lacks a certain focus and drive and conveys his slight ""Dude where's my car"" goofiness that the serious script never compensates for.  Nevertheless, it does an adequate job of showing how this computer company started from zero, picked up more hard working visionaries, and lost those who didn't quite see eye to eye.  I would have liked less screen time squandered on the tense showdowns and more on the boundless enthusiasm (which is admittedly more difficult to recreate.)",1388016000,,609,4.893203883495145

5589093,3,B00BEIYLAW,"Jobs is a sort of semi autobiographical account of the rise and fall and rise again of Steve Jobs and Apple.  Not being a fan of Apple products per se, although I do like my I-pod, I watched this movie more out of curiosity than as a fan of the company or the man.  The movie provided an interesting insight to the life of Steve Jobs and the company itself, in some ways similar to the rise of Bill Gates.  I found it interesting that both men rose to prominence off the ideas of others in reality.  I am not normally an Ashton Kutcher fan but I found that his portrayal of Jobs was very well done, even emulating his walk and mannerisms very well.  The story itself is ok but I felt tended to stay away from the more complex issues of Jobs life and only highlighting some of them.  Maybe this would have made the story too long, I don't know, and may have been better suited as a mini-series in order to tell the full story as opposed to made for the big screen movie.  With Jobs now gone, it remains to be seen that the company will continue on with the passion that Jobs brought when he ran the company.  A chapter that is yet to be written.

With that being said, though I did find the movie entertaining to watch and informative as well.",1387929600,2,1242,4.163179916317992

After the movie I watched the unauthorized biopic and a couple of old, uncut interviews of Steve Jobs and I noticed the movie ""Jobs"" was following almost the same editing foot-steps of those interviews.
Steve Jobs seemed to have a quite intense and diverse life and it is difficult to tell the whole story in just one movie although this specific one just missed the target to to add depth and introspection to the character, barely scratching the surface of this very eclectic and talented man.",1387843200,,632,4.91588785046729

Frighteningly authentic performance by Ashton Kutcher, and nicely supported by Josh Gad.  One complaint is that the movie ends ""too early"" ... Jobs' more recent decisions, activities, successes, and health problems are not mentioned.  And the long-running feud with Microsoft gets only a few screen minutes, far short of the dominant theme it had in real life.  Overall, though, a worthwhile biography and a nostalgic treat for anyone who was part of the home computer revolution in the 70s and 80s.",1387843200,,590,5.114583333333333

The focus of the movie focuses on the beginning of Apple computer and truly showcases Steve Jobs multitude of abilities.

Jobs certainly created great products and for those of you who don't remember a time before microwaves and computers, stand down. We grew out of a culture of the late 60's - 70s. A good President died. If we didn't go to war ourselves, we knew someone who did. Some came back, some didn't. We didn't plan to start a revolution. We just didn't trust the grown-ups anymore, that included Congress, one President in particular, Wall Street or The Corporation. We trusted each other. We believed in each other. We wanted to be different, very different from our parents and their homogenized lives. Steve was one of us. He wanted to create better lives for us, make us better human beings. Of course he knew how beautiful simplicity of form was, yes, he found beauty in the curve of a brushstroke creating a font, but what he wanted for us, for all of us was to live life with such passion that we prove ourselves unstoppable from obtaining our vision no matter what that vision is. Steve said to us, this, whatever my passions, my life serves to show you, is what an exemplary life looks like, what real passion looks like, what simplicity, integrity and being the driven force really deliver; maybe just the answer to what life itself is really all about.",1387497600,,1424,4.523255813953488

5589285,3,B00BEIYLAW,"I watched this movie on the long plane trip from SFO to Sydney. If I had not been a captive in my narrow, uncomfortable seat for many hours I may not have otherwise chosen to watch the film. Since I live in Silicon Valley, and have known many people who worked at Apple, I feel I already know the story of Steve Jobs. Nonetheless, I was riveted by Kutcher's spot-on performance. There is plenty of imagery and video available to document Jobs' style and mannerisms, and it is obvious that Kutcher did his homework and studied the man extensively. Beyond the physical resemblance, the tight, controlled posture and speech patterns were mimicked by Kutcher to an almost uncanny degree. In some of the early, youthful scenes I thought maybe the director had used actual historical footage of Jobs. Kutcher has appeared in many light-weight, comedic roles, but this singular performance will surely elevate his status and put him in consideration for other more serious acting roles.

Beyond the acting, however, the film is curiously emotionless and fragmented, leaving some major plot lines incomplete. We see Jobs dismissing the mother of his first child, but some time later we see him as an apparently happy family man. We see him threaten Bill Gates with legal action, but it's never mentioned again. The departure of Wozniak is almost a footnote. The ending is abrupt, omitting the final chapter of Jobs' life altogether. With a better script and direction, coupled with Kutcher's astonishing performance, this could have been a 5-star film with broad audience appeal since Jobs is already well on his way to becoming a legendary figure in American history.",1386979200,,1660,4.971223021582734

The book was too long to reduce to a 2 hour movie and didn't really do justice to Steve Jobs who was a very complicated and talented man.  I think there was too much focus on him as a hippie in his early days and then his much hyped,supercharged bad temper later.  He deserved better than that.  Ashton Kutcher did a good job as did the other actors.

I read the biography that the movie was based on and I feel like the script was well written and touched on the important highlights of Jobs' life. No movie biography can encompass every important aspect of a person's life unless you're willing to sit and watch that movie for 3+ hours!

5589441,2,B00BEIYLAW,"For a biographical film it sure has some poor character development. Woz at least explained his motivations.  Jobs remained a sort of an emotional mystery. Why was he his ""own worst enemy"" as was told to him multiple times? While it's obvious he cares fervently about the product's end result, he seems to go back and forth about his want of wealth and respect for others. ""Nerds"" seemed to want to work with him because he was so ""cool"" but there was no indication to me that he was ""cool"" even to a ""nerd"". Scenes that seemed in need of explanatory dialogue were simply filled in with closeups of Jobs' near expressionless face or faraway shots of Jobs' hunched walking. While the movie spans 3 decades, each time period seems a little rushed as if there was nothing happening in between. This creates a confusing series of moments where everything is  going well, Jobs pushes everyone to create a great new product then skip ahead 10 years and everyone is obviously richer but hates Jobs even more because he costs the corporation too much money. Worse are the two cheesy ""Teamwork"" montages that are placed at the end of the first two decades.

5589472,5,B00BEIYLAW,Ashton Kutcher did a great job emulating the life of Steve Jobs. He should win an award or at least be recognized for his art.,1385942400,,126,4.08
5589473,3,B00BEIYLAW,"Watching Jobs, a biographical picture of Steve Jobs, is like reading a student study guide of Shakespeare. You will know someones life story full of events, the ups and downs (and ups) of a complex person, but you will not get interested in or feel anything about the person himself very much. You may learn some facts, with many visual details (including the actual garage where Steve Jobs and his friends worked on their project), but you do not learn much about the mans personality.

The problem is simple: the films narrative structure. Written by first-time writer Matt Whiteley and directed by Joshua Michael Stern (Neverwas Swing Vote), Jobs begins with Steve Jobs (Ashton Kutcher) introducing the iPod in 2001. Then the film flashbacks to the 1970s, when he has just dropped out from college and travelled in India.

So far, thats fine, but then the film jumps from one episode to another without developing the central character of Jobs. You don't have to cover every episode in his life (and we have already a made-for-TV film Pirates of Silicon Valley), but at least you have to present your own version of what the man is really like, which somehow Jobs is afraid of doing.

The idea of Ashton Kutcher playing Steve Jobs was something unexpected to me, but to his credit, he did a very good job. While watching Jobs, however, I kept thinking of another bio-pic that was about another influential figure. It was The Social Network, a biographical film of Mark Zuckerberg, and David Fincher knew what he was doing when portraying the Facebook creator in the opening bar scene. Perhaps it is his incisive vision or touch that is missing in Jobs.",1385942400,,1655,4.77972027972028
5589474,1,B00BEIYLAW,"I watched the movie for the first 10 minutes and then close it for good. Kutcher's capture of Jobs with that mutated movement accent strike me as a mockery for his image more than reconstructing the past giant's image. I have high appreciation on Jobs as business person who's almost single handedly bring Apple from scrapyard to the top. I just can't stand seeing Kutcher being bald , hunch his back wearing skinny pants when his eyes are flickering smile anytime hes appearing as the older Jobs.

Kutcher's too young, those acting skill that he displayed is counter-productive in this movie,if you would find a actor to portrait Jobs, you find Danial Lewis, George Gooney, or even jokster Jim Carrey would behave 100 times better than Kutcher's premature teenager craps.

I ended up really getting into it.  Ashton Kutcher really did a great job portraying Steve Jobs.  He has the walk down perfectly and even his facial expressions were classic Steve Jobs.  I really enjoyed the first part of the movie, seeing how Apple Computers got off the ground and started a technical revolution.  The movie definitely gets darker as you see the change in Jobs after he becomes successful and takes the company public.  He really was not a very likeable guy.  There is a big skip in time between when he is taken off the board of Apple and when he finally returns.  You don't get to see what it is that changes his mind set and way of life, but he comes back a much calmer and more amiable person.  There is no doubt that Steve Jobs was a genius and this movie gives you a glimpse into how this legendary man evolved from an unfocused hippie in the 1970's to a driven perfectionist of a CEO in later years.  If you enjoy biopics or if you are intrigued by the mythical figure of Steve Jobs, this is definitely worth a watch.",1385942400,,1198,4.303571428571429

We learn that Jobs was obsessive, like to garden, had a 'baby mama' that apparently slept around (or, he thought she did), was comfortable not being at Apple on the outside, but truly was laying and waiting to return.

Now, we all know what he did when he returned, but it would have been nice to see how he pulled off ITune turning the music industry into his pawns etc.",1385856000,,585,4.339449541284404

5589553,3,B00BEIYLAW,"The big surprise here is something I thought I'd never say - Ashton Kutcher is amazing and propels this limp 2 hour snooze fest into an engaging and believable broad-strokes sketch of Apple and Jobs. Kutcher gets the mannerisms and body language nailed so uncannily that at times you can almost feel you're watching Steve Jobs and not the guy from Punk'd.

But tremendous and Oscar-worthy acting aside, the script takes the safe detour though any material that's controversial and edgy and skims over major parts of the Jobs story, including the rebuilding of Apple, his health and eventual death. Even his child whom he fails to acknowledge for over half the movie mysteriously shows up in the very next scene as a teenager on his couch with no explanation whatsoever.

By neutering all the controversy, what could have been The Film to watch about this iconic character becomes a made-for-TV special adding very little that you probably don't already know. Still, it's so extraordinarily uncanny to watch Kutcher of all people to pull off the performance that's it worth viewing for that alone.",1385683200,2,1096,4.951086956521739

5589558,3,B00BEIYLAW,"I saw this movie in the theater and really liked it a lot. The reason I gave it only 3 stars in this review is that the DVD/Blu-ray release differs from the theatrical release in that the language has been cleaned up a bit, perhaps to make the home video release get a PG-13 rating? In particular, I specifically remember the ""F"" word being used in at least two scenes: when Jobs fires the software engineer for not including the multiple fonts option in Lisa Write (he told him ""you either get on board, or get the ""F"" out!""); also, when he calls up Bill Gates in a rage for copying the Mac GUI look and feel he calls him (I'm paraphrasing here) ""you ""F""-ing psychopath!""

Look, I can get by without the ""F"" word, my main complaint is that this DVD/Blu-ray release is not the same as the theatrical release but I cannot find any mention of that anywhere. There may be other differences as well, I just can't recall every detail of the theatrical release.

It begins with him making the decision to drop out of college then shows his rise from working at Atari to eventually creating the company of Apple computers. I don't really know too much about the life of Jobs but I could tell there was a bunch of stuff they cut out. For example in one scene he bargains with an investor for money for his garage computer shop, the next scene he has a huge office with tons of employees. I know they can't show everything but there are large jumps. They did really seem to skim over a whole story about his daughter that seemed important. I also didn't realize he started at Atari, but the main thing I didn't know was how big of a jerk he was. It is hard to not think of the Social Network when watching this one mainly because of the subject matter. There are a ton of similarities but the one constant between Jobs and Zuckerberg are the way they forgot about everyone that helped them out in the beginning and that is the most devastating part of their lives to me. With that comment out of the way and personal feelings aside this was a very good movie and I really liked it much more then I expected to. Overall, really good movie and I have to say Kutcher did a good job but if any Oscar nominations come out of this it should be for Josh Gad. He was fantastic in this.

Steve Jobs is one of my personal heroes. I wrote my college essay on him, and I'm a loyal apple fan. So I was surprised when they picked Ashton Kutcher to play Jobs, and more than worried before seeing this film. My worries were confirmed.

What we have here is a poorly done, extended made-for-tv movie, that avoids the most interesting parts of Jobs' life (after he returned to apple and his time at Pixar) in exchange for boring boardroom drama with poor dialogue. Josh Gad as Wozniak was ok, as was Kutcher's portrayal of Jobs, but neither was spot on.

The movie could have focused on the history and the essence of that comeback which leads up to the iPod but the movie gets very diluted without any story arc, love interest or conflict.  It's difficult to get all of the facts from the Walter Isaacscon book, but that should not take away from the key elements necessary for a screenplay.  Basically, Ashton Kutcher, to his credit, delivered a believable performance as Jobs, but the studio should have allowed for a bigger budget because the film necessitated another hour to develop the characters with the timeline chosen.  Additionally, the Director, Joshua Michael Stern, clearly did not have the experience to deliver a top notch film since this was only his third effort.  Such a shame because this could have been a classic film.

5589650,4,B00BEIYLAW,"I'm surprised I liked JOBS as much as I did, considering that the reviews surrounding the film were mediocre at best, not to mention that Ashton Kutcher is one of my least favourite actors EVER. Much to my surprise, Kutcher was actually astonishingly good in the title role.

Take him out, and you are left with a limp, unfocused, poorly paced, and incredibly boring biopic. Put him back in, and you are still left with the above, but with a daring and riveting performance at its centre.

Now, this is isn't saying much, but this is Kutcher's best performance by about 300%. He absolutely *nails* Steve Jobs's mannerisms - his stooped walk, the way he held his hands in front of him, the way he pursed his lips, etc. He holds surprising gravitas and charisma, and holds up excellently in scenery-chewing moments. The scenes where he brutally rejects the woman he impregnated, and gives Bill Gates a piece of his mind (""And I will make sure you NEVER earn a dollar again, that I don't get 90 cents from!"") show a different, extremely competent side of the actor. The material surrounding him might be rote and unfeeling, but Kutcher has steel in his gaze and power in his presence.

It's a pity then, that JOBS is unfocused in it's storytelling, in need of a damn good edit, uninformative, and rather dull. No really, at times this was one of the most boring films I've ever seen. The scene where Wozniak leaves Apple should have been emotional and heartrending, but nearly put me to sleep. I would rather have had more fun reading up on infections of the large intestine.

Jobs had scenes that had no impact whatsoever on the film - extraneous, useless scenes that do nothing that bore the audience. 90% of the movie are actors talking quietly (or loudly) to each-other - just talking. Talking WELL, yes, but still talking. And lastly, JOBS is incredibly uninformative. We get nothing about WHY Apple became big, how it sustained losses through tough times, really WHY Steve Jobs was fired, subsequently rehired, and how Apple recovered.

JOBS is not without it's positives, however. The first I went over above - the performance of Ashton Kutcher. The rest of the cast is rather excellent as well. Josh Gad as Steve Wozniak is enjoyable, and JK Simmons chews scenery as Arthur Rock. The costumes and wigs are excellent. The period design is incredible - from the terrible hairdos to the tacky suits to the giant computers. I never felt that I was anywhere else but in the 70's and 80's. Kudos to the the production designer.

In conclusion, I don't think Steve Jobs would have been very happy with JOBS. It's not daring enough. It never strives for something edgy or dangerous. It is content to roll along at documentary pace, with poor editing and dull pacing.

But I still think you should see this movie. See it for an extraordinary performance from Ashton Kutcher, a fine cast, and excellent production values. See it to remember a great man. A difficult man; a daring, edgy, cruel, prickly, brilliant man: Steve Jobs. 3.5/5 Stars, rounded up to 4.

5589742,5,B00BEIYLAW,"I bought the movie (for the price of a couple of rentals) because I had a hunch I'd want to see it more than once - and it's proved to be the case.

If you're expecting a biopic documentary full of Steve Jobs facts and ephemera then this movie is not going to cut it for you.  It is, in essence, a fictional drama stitched together with a base of factual characters and events.  In fact it's clear that's the case since we all feel like we know heaps about Steve Jobs thanks to his very very public persona.

Overall Ashton Kutcher does an excellent job of portraying Jobs; he does fall a little short in my mind, the accent was good but just not quite right, the explosive anger spilled out well but this was Steve's well-known nuclear option wielded to great effect and the film's character spilled forth like a mini Krakatoa but did not convince that it was the wrath of an angered demi-god on the edge of spitting your soul which is how I'd been led to believe it felt to be on the withering end of a Jobs' tirade.

The scenes around the conception and younger years of Lisa, Steve's first child felt like they were paid lip-service in some ways and perhaps it's the geek in me that wanted it to either be the foundation of why Steve became who he was or to prop up some fundamental turning point in his life.  Instead the movie hints at this awkwardly and confuses the early hippy years, trips to Indian swamis and calligraphy classes in a way that seemed a bit like an area of script that was heavily edited for time and as a result left knotted into a bit of a mess that did not help bolster the rest of the film.

Josh Gad's Woz is the right amount of awkward and soft-hearted obtuse-thinking boffin which is how I perceive the real Steve Wozniak to be.  Dermot Mulroney played a blindingly good and convincing performance as Mike Markkula so much so it almost became a mini ""my time with Apple"" biopic of the great man.

For all the actors it must have been extremely intimidating to play any of the characters since they are so well known and many many hours of footage exists of them with virtually every Apple geek in the world feeling like they know their every nuance.  A very tough thing to do.  I think it worked.

Overall a good even-paced movie but probably not one you're going to rave about.  For Apple fans like myself - a MUST HAVE and must see movie.  As a computer geek hailing from the 70s and 80s it was a five star ""loved it"" for me.",1384819200,,2460,4.273706896551724
5589743,5,B00BEIYLAW,"I was a bit skeptical going into this movie that Ashton Kutcher could carry the role of Steve Jobs.  His performance surprised me and showed me that Kutcher has more acting chops than he normally uses in the sitcom settings we normally get to see him in.

For the Apple purists out there this film may not be 100% accurate and since it only lasts about two hours there are obviously things that are left out.  With that said I really enjoyed the movie.  It hit the big points well, covering both the starting of Apple and Jobs eventual removal from the company.

The movie shows Jobs for what he was, a visionary that often let his quest for the best product in the world erode his relationships with his family, friends and co-workers.  Kutcher seemed equally comfortable portraying Jobs highs and lows, from the yelling, screaming manic leader of a tech giant to the broken man that winds up crying back in the garage where Apple was created many years prior.

I grew up during the Apple revolution and had an Apple IIe.  It was the first computer I remember seeing in a friend's house and we were all absolutely blown away by the possibilities.  There is no doubt that Steve Jobs changed the world with his vision.

5589749,4,B00BEIYLAW,"This film is not your typical movie. It's not meant to be a motion picture to ""entertain"" the audience and give that cinematic experience. It's not quite a classical biography or documentary either, as there is no narration or third party interviews. The movie covers Jobs from college to first iPod announcement in 2001, and during this time only parts of his life that is relevant to his endeavor to create (Atari game, Apple I board, Apple II, LISA, first Macintosh). The movie skipped entire stint at NeXT and jumped to his return to Apple and begin instill his philosophy for new Mac and into consumer devices.

For general audience, the film will come across bunch of short films concatenated. Each transition (screen black out) may be few months or few years later. For those not familiar with the timeline of events, it may be tough to following as there are no mention of which year after each scene jump. This have bother some people as evident in the reviews from general public.

Personally, I enjoyed the viewing. This is probably because 1) I get to be nostalgic and relive the early personal computers from the first Apple II / TRS-80 rivalry, to the intro of Mac challenging IBM PC, and onward. Second is because I am an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley and can relate to everything Jobs have gone through - from garage start-up to first venture funding to first trade show to company growing big to turmoils, investor demands, and board battles.

In addition to the above two reasons, I think this movie will also resonate with audience that are:

1. Genuinely admire/curious Steve Jobs (or really in awe of the Apple products under him)
2. Very interested in how Apple came about
3. Want insights on going from ""garage start-ups"" to big time in the early days of tech

I don't know Steve Jobs so I am neutral on Aston Kutcher's portrayl of him. But those that have interacted with him might have strong feelings one way or the other. With that said, I can see Aston Kutcher took the acting role seriously. In general, this kind of ""biopic"" film it is seldom completely accurate. It's more for audience to get the gist of it, so take it for what it is.

In summary, it's not a movie to entertain but rather to give some insights. If you see the movie with the right interest or expectation (and you don't know about Jobs personally), it could be worth your time.

5589750,3,B00BEIYLAW,"The film attempts to cram 40 years of history into 2 hours. It starts with Steve Jobs (Ashton Kutcher) dropping acid and hanging out with the counter culture group. It shows us that he was a very flawed man and early on is called an a-hole. In addition to glimpses of Steve's personal life, we see his difficulty in dealing with the various suits who want to make dollars and sense of the company.

The main problem with the film is that Jobs is the only character that is developed and he is unlikeable. There is very little connection to the viewer. While I love a 60's music soundtrack, the songs they selected were hit and miss with clearly better selections available. The credits show us a picture of the real life individual next to the actor that played them as a way to say, ""Aren't we clever?"" The secondary actors were cardboard cutouts.

The film sends a message of innovation and thinking outside of the box, which is weakened by the personality portrayed of Jobs. Worth a view as a rental.

8567008,4,B00BEIYLAW,"Watching movies first and then reading reviews afterward is probably not the only thing I do backward, but it's one of them, and my experience with ""Jobs"" was no different. That being the case, I can say that I was a little surprised (at first) to see the cold reception given this movie by many critics. That was before I remembered that it's in vogue to hate Ashton Kutcher. Granted, he's no Pacino or Walken, but he is a competent actor and, for my money, did an outstanding job here.
As to some of the ambiguity lamented by certain critics, I can only say that the real Steve Jobs was something of an enigma, and in that regard the movie and Kutcher's performance were spot-on. Here is the story of an egomaniacal control freak who used people and, in several instances, screwed them over. He rarely showed hints of remorse, and then only when his cold-hearted actions boomeranged on him. On we could go on the dark side of Steve Jobs, and one wonders if there was any other side there. But at the end of the day, this great salesman who was a not-so-great human being changed the world and our lives forever, and Kutcher captured that essence brilliantly.
In light of all this, do we really need an hour added to the movie to satisfy those who wanted to see more about mommy and daddy issues? Do we really ding this film for depriving us of some psychobabble examination of why he treated women the way he did? If you lean toward ""no"" when answering those questions, then you'll likely enjoy this movie. If you enjoy some good acting and a movie that focuses on the man synonymous with Apple, Pixar, and the iPhone, give this one a shot. I would've liked more about the rivalry with Bill Gates and Microsoft, but I can live with this movie as is in light of the fact that Steve Jobs didn't like to share the spotlight.",1529193600,,1823,4.428571428571429

It is too dry, not sexy enough, poorly paced and does not even have the Xerox scene, so fix it!"". I must say that this seems about right. To be clear this is a business movie and a drama, not a thriller. If you are big fan of the founder of Apple you will enjoy the movie. It is the non-believers who will be disappointed. I recognized many scenes and liked the visual feel for the 1970s that the movie brings to his early years. As many things in the movie his adoption is not given enough balance but that aside from that the acting is really good. In my view it is the story or screenplay that could use some tweaking.

The visual flashbacks to India, the calligraphy courses he took at Reed College, and his drift toward design were all well done, though many others scenes were not included and needed to be. If you knew the overall story nothing would be new to you, however how and why he changed were not really explained well, and may have lost many of the audience. If there was a director's cut in a longer, full-3 hour version this would have been better. Too much seemed to be crammed into just 2 hours and sadly there was to much ground to cover. The look and feel of all of the key characters has comparison photos at the end and any casting pro would give high marks to the matches made. Ashton Kutcher really had his manner and walk down pat, but the lines were never consistent in quality.

If you are an easy sell for a business movie on Apple then you will enjoy yourself. However, if you hope to see a great movie that is about Apple, the tech image icon of our times and be enthralled by its founder's story, make another choice.

8567015,5,B00BEIYLAW,I like all movies and documentaries having to do with Steve Jobs and Apple.  As I have a family member who worked for IBM I have always had computers in my house and grew with them.  Other than the movie Pirates of Silicon Valley which is good but does not just talk about Steve Jobs and Apple this movie does.  This movie I feel really shows how Apple really ran from from the beginning of the Apple 2.  Now I know some of the things in this movie are not 100% the way things happened but when are movies exactly true to the story they are telling.  Anyways Good movie and I suggest it to anyone that wants a good movie about Steve Jobs,1519689600,,637,4.104838709677419
