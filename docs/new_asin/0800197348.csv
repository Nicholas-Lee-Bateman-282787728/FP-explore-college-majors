The voices of Jim Backus, Dwayne Hickman and Hans Conried made this a pleasure to watch. Of course anything with Mr. Magoo is great family fun! Enjoy!",1129334400,,307,4.5

The interaction between Bowser, the cat, and the ball of yarn is especially priceless, and the artistic style is colorful and gorgeous! THANKS, at last.",1517702400,,284,4.480769230769231

7792889,5,0800197348,Didn't know they had put this on DVD.  I saw this in the theaters when I was young.  It came to television every year after during the holiday season.  It has special memories.,1379635200,2,176,4.2727272727272725
7792890,4,0800197348,"This is an interesting film. The UPA Studio designs are stylish and chic. The music and songs are your typical 1960's romantic fare. Mr. Magoo is funny and exasperating as usual. The Arabian Nights story of Aladdin is there, although it seems to take a back seat to the fancy artwork. It's not the most exciting blockbuster film I've ever seen, but it's a pleasant viewing experience.
A typical Amazon review is, ""Great film! Why oh why isn't this on DVD yet?"", and that certainly applies to this film.  The only version I could find of this film was on VHS (recorded at a slow, inferior speed to save tape), which of course, doesn't do justice at all to the gorgeous graphics.  This handsome film would really sparkle on DVD.  Not only that, it's a part of American animation history, and for that reason alone deserves a DVD.
Until that time, we'll have to content ourselves with 20-plus year old VHS tapes, which is like drinking a fine wine out of a dirty tin can.",1318636800,,968,4.52

Well along came Amazon and there it was, at a great price too!  My kids had never heard of Mr Magoo and now they think it's so funny.  Thanks Amazon for having ""hard to find"" products at a great price!",1186617600,2,335,3.8970588235294117
