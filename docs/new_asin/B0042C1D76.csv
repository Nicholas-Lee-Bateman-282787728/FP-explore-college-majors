He looks like a clone of Andy Warhol 10 years after death, combined with Liberace's father (if his father dressed like a mummy in full drag).  And yet, he continues to dump (and dump, and dump) his ugliness upon Madonna.  It's like a war between evil (Elton) and good (Madonna - who is spreading the words of hope, tolerance, meditation, and good thoughts for 2012 - in a world that appears to be in the tribulation).

Once upon a time - in 1970 and beyond - my friend's and I eagerly awaited each new Elton single / album.  And Bernie's lyrics - wow!  Now, how could that combo, turn into the Elton John of 2012.  People are using his screwed up facial expressions as screen savers!  And the hurt and poison he spews into the ether - no wonder the ice caps are melting.

I'm in the process of gathering up my Japanese boxed releases of Elton John, and any miscellaneous CD's (from decades past) of his that have accumulated in my home.  Ebay sale.  I can't bear to have his poison karma in my home - I might even need a priest to bless my home and family after it's cleansed of ""Elton"".",1344211200,,1143,4.265116279069767
