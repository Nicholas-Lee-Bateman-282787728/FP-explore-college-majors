8226539,3,B000X1SQGG,"I was tempted to quit viewing it until I got 3/4 of the way through the movie when I began to understand that the story revolved around the impending death of Paul's father, which triggered flashbacks.
There were three flashback segments; one in vintage color when Paul was 5, color when he was 13, and black and white when he was 17, which allowed the viewer to know what stage of life that Paul was in.
The movie covers the full range of life experiences. The only problem was there was no seamless flow from one flashback to the other that made sense. It would've made more sense if the story started with the news about father's death not near the end. The story line and the acting gets five stars but the direction knocked it down two stars.
I suggest you rent the movie and have patience when you view it.",1208390400,,812,4.348684210526316
