6071871,5,B00GD6LRVQ,Not going to pretend to get it but my boys (7 & 5) love it.  I like that they can watch 10 episodes and there are no commericals so I am not constantly being hit up to buy them whatever is on the TV at that moment.,1391126400,,214,3.5531914893617023
6071872,5,B00GD6LRVQ,"when this was coming to tv, some people were a bit speculative about it, thinking it would be something like thundercats (mostly because of Laval's appearance). and when it did air it did gain some viewers, though the first few episodes dragged on with the same scheme of Cragger being drugged by some hypnotic plant by his sister so she can use him as a pawn to rule Chima, but after those few episodes it began to slowly form a plot, introduced new characters, and build some suspense, so i believe its worth the buy. :)",1390521600,3,522,4.447916666666667
