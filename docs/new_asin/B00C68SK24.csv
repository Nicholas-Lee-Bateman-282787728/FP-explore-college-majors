5691080,1,B00C68SK24,Disappointing. It was okay but not as good as I had hoped. maybe next time I'll get a one I really like.,1389225600,,104,3.772727272727273
5691081,5,B00C68SK24,I liked the realism of modern day life for Native Americans (or Canadians) and the struggles that they face in everyday life.,1383609600,4,125,4.7272727272727275
5691082,5,B00C68SK24,"Movie was Awesome! great gift for my wife, she loved the book so this made her day! She loved the movie as well",1378252800,2,111,3.869565217391304
5691083,1,B00C68SK24,Terribly boring and uncomfortable to watch.  This movie is very depressing and paints a picture of people posing as victims and useless to society.,1376438400,,147,5.125
5691084,5,B00C68SK24,"Thoroughly captivating story with great acting by famous and unknown actors alike. The star, Joel Evans, is one of the newbies (this is his first movie), but he manages to convey amazing depths of emotion with subtle facial expressions and those beautiful, vulnerable eyes of his. He proves Anthony Hopkins' philosophy of acting that less is more. The director, Anita Doron, also has a light touch, never forcing a scene, always allowing the viewers to intuit for themselves what is going on under the surface. No cliches here, just life in all its complexity, adolescence at its rawest. A beautiful movie. I can't wait to see more from Joel Evans.

Recommended for people who liked PARANOID PARK or THE SLAUGHTER RULE.",1376092800,3,719,4.9421487603305785
5691085,5,B00C68SK24,A wonderful new film about a native boy attempting to fit in with a rather dark secret that influences every move he makes.,1375574400,2,123,4.391304347826087
5691086,5,B00C68SK24,"I have read several books written by author Richard Van Camp and this movie delivers the emotional sting from his story.  The stark Canadian environment that these high school kids live in helps to reveal the secret traumas that they are living. However, there is also delightful growth, tears and happiness in the final reckoning. Plus, Larry and all the kids are just loveable!",1372723200,6,379,4.921875
5691087,5,B00C68SK24,"If you were one of those many people in high school who could never seem to ""fit in"" with the ""in crowd,"" maybe you were better off just being who you were! That's the sometimes dreary, but authentic story of one boy who has literally undergone ""trial by fire"" and the scrutiny of his close friends in a small town. The story is accurate to the point of being more than just a little scary, with an ending that mirrors life, itself.",1369699200,11,432,4.280487804878049
5691088,3,B00C68SK24,"Just not for me. It's a good film, I was not into it though. Watched from beginning to end.",1479772800,,91,3.8421052631578947

5691102,5,B00C68SK24,"It very easily and subtly held my interest all the way through. It's a film for sensitive people... Though it deals with child abuse and teen violence, it's all done VERY tastefully and there are no grossly explicit scenes. It touched me with many deeply poetic moments that could have easily been missed were I not completely engaged with full attention. But that was quite easy because I fully believed all the engaging characters and was drawn right in. I really like that in a movie, especially a low-budget organic one. Excellent ensemble and direction. It's not a dazzling movie... it kinda crept up on me.",1463184000,5,612,4.783018867924528

5691106,5,B00C68SK24,"Very eye opening and thought provoking...!

The film addresses many issues such as:
1.
Family abuse(Physical, Mental, Sexual) and the potential long term detrimental affects.

2.
Peer pressure within the teen age range.

3.
The importance of having supportive strong Men around that can help guide another young Man.

4.
Social economic factors in small towns such as this one.

5.
The need for options for teens to choose other drugs and alcohol for entertainment.

6.
The need for detailed, real world and appropriate sex education.

7.
The need for responsible adults around teens.",1443139200,7,584,5.148936170212766
5691107,5,B00C68SK24,"An excellent, poignent, and honest look at how life really is for a lot of people! One of the best films we have seen in a long time! Brilliant portrayal of resilience coming from unbearable trauma. Powerful acting, directing and screenplay. Rarely, have I seen a move based on a book that really covers a multitude of layers. The way the film was shot, the dialogue, the time sequence, and what is left unsaid coveyed a complexity of characters and story that most movies don't even come close to revealing. I will look for the book, recommend this movie to everyone, and see it again myself!",1442275200,4,593,4.60377358490566

5691114,3,B00C68SK24,not what I expected...interesting movie,1419120000,,39,7.0
5691115,2,B00C68SK24,"The script is great with nailing down one channel of adolescent Native life with one group of fictional teens in the movie, but not all Natives and Native communities are full of drugs, alcohol, sex and violence as depicted in the movie.  The purpose of this movie is not to inspire Native people to strive for something more but rather is another vehicle for the author of the book, The Lesser Blessed, to tell a particular story, in general.  However, the film is well-made and the acting and casting is well done. If you want to be entertained try Smoke Signals, and if you want to experience a story you can definitely find one with The Lesser Blessed.",1413590400,,656,4.5508474576271185
5691116,4,B00C68SK24,"I still have yet to read the novel.  From the description of the book it seems somewhat different already.  But that is the problem with movies made from books, a lot of good parts left out.  But overall the movie was entertaining. I enjoyed the storyline.  I would have liked to see more development of the main character and his family, his childhood in particular.  I know there was an issue of abuse with the son.  But it just leaves questions why he and the school boy didn't get along?  Did the boy not know his dad abused him?  Just some things were a bit unclear.",1410480000,,571,4.320754716981132
5691117,5,B00C68SK24,"Heart wrenching story about the challenges of coming of age set against the backdrop of a life made more difficult by the social and physical world in which these teens live. The performances by the young actors, especially the lead (Joel Evans as Larry Sole) are really well done, and they make their stories feel real. As with many movies, the book is a bit more engaging, and I would definitely suggest reading it (The Lesser Blessed by Richard Van Camp) in addition to watching this film.",1410393600,4,492,4.666666666666667
