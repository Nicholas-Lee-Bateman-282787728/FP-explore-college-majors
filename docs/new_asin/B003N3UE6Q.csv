4156502,5,B003N3UE6Q,Everything you ever wanted to know about making a movie is there in 20 chapters.  Not a bad price for the information and entertainment presented.,1274400000,,146,4.84
8400688,1,B003N3UE6Q,"I shop a lot on Amazon and a small percentage of the time, rave customer reviews have persuaded me to take a chance, to my later regret. This is one of those times.

What were these gushing reviewers thinking?

For starters, how old is this video, really? Its copyright date is 2010 but the author describes ancient distribution media like tape-based mini-DV or HDV. There's no mention of self-distributing on YouTube or via other web alternatives. The distribution advice is a relic from the days when a few studios and TV networks controlled the content. It's the same with financing: he goes on ad nauseam about traditional lenders and family members, but makes no mention of Kickstarter and other crowdsourcing options. The advice here seems to have been compiled pre-1997.

This guide concerns itself with the needs of professionals ONLY, not prosumers or home movie buffs. The content revolves around what a only professional film maker needs to know. (For example, how to get shooting permits from municipalities. Where to source talent and crew. How to evaluate distribution potential.)

The video consists of a series of on-screen subject titles with brief narrated discussion, followed by on-screen lists. In other words, it's a book -- a SMALL book -- in the form of on-screen type you will have to transcribe.

The footage used to illustrate the author's points is weak to the point of irrelevance. And the pie-in-the-face humor gets old, FAST. The content would have been more useful if published as a brief (24-page) point-form collection of tips and tricks for pros. But then, it wouldn't have cost $25.

Most of the content is new to nobody (get copyright permission to music or be sued; you are expected to be on time and on budget) or lacks sufficient detail to be of use (always buy the best equipment you can afford). For the intended audience, professional makers of moving pictures, I'd be surprised if these people came across a single thing they didn't already know.

The author alludes to important documents like a preproduction list, but then only touches on them briefly, offering a few sample points. Of course, were this in book form, the author could have gone into detail and provided examples, even templates. Read the title again. Only a book can contain in accessible form the large amount of information required to fulfill the title's mandate. And to do the subject justice, it would have to be a hefty book at that.

In a nearly laughable discourse (25:15) the narrative cautions the would-be movie maker about obtaining financing, selecting platform (film? cable? television?), and getting distribution rights. The upshot? ""You will have to do a lot of research!"" Very helpful, thanks!

Such gems of wisdom take the place of the actual content these broad topics call out for. Only a book could provide the depth and (via a good TOC and index) access to detail information. Better than anything else, this video teaches the limitations of film in the presentation of complex discussions and solutions. Ironic? I'd say so!

At the 30-minute mark an unbelievably crude, racist attempt at bathroom humor (having a gas attack in a Mexican restaurant -- don't bother looking for it) urged me not to compound my wasting $25 by spending any more of my time watching the production of someone who has obviously not been a success at the trade they are supposedly teaching. But I watched the rest of it anyway out of a sense of duty and fairness. I wasn't about to pan something I hadn't seen in its entirety.

At the hour point the credits run, several minutes' worth of them. Then, the video continues as if nothing happened, continuing its superficial coverage of disjointed subjects, from post-production to conceptual visualization to having business cards printed. Seemingly in the middle of the ""getting free resources"" topic, the video abruptly ends. This tells me the video clips were scrambled during assembly into finished product. (I have the downloaded version, acquired in August 2013.) How much are you willing to rely on the advice of someone who can't put together his own movie?

What originally hooked me into buying this mess was the notion of a movie about making movies. But it doesn't work. The production is chaotic, the subject is too broad for the medium, and the content is unhelpful. Despite the author's labored attempts at humor, or maybe because of them, I found this video no fun to watch. This is an example of the medium (a disorganized, unhelpful hodge-podge of self-evident tips presented as annoying slapstick video) being the message. The message being: Buyer beware.",1378166400,3,4635,4.951093951093951
8400689,1,B003N3UE6Q,"I purchased this DVD because it came up as a DVD people bought with Capturing Reality.  Capturing Reality is a great film, the reviews for How to Make a Documentary were good, I thought I was making a safe purchase.  As a high school documentary filmmaking teacher, I am always looking for new tools for the classroom.  This DVD is poorly made and unprofessional.  I can't show it in the classroom because it has unbelievably racist content.  I spent the summer taking a class on race and achievement in an effort to tie race into my curriculum and ultimately, have a conversation about race through documentary films.  Showing this film to students would invalidate my efforts completely.  Additionally, the menu items are out of order and the menu was made in iDVD.  I'm trying to hold my students to higher standards and help them create films that are professional quality, yet this film isn't professional at all.  I wasted $30 of my own money on this video.  If you're looking for an educational classroom tool, do not purchase this DVD.  I hope this helps.",1346976000,3,1063,4.7228260869565215
8400690,1,B003N3UE6Q,"I would have thought that a DVD on film making would have reasonable production values but was sorely disappointed when I purchased this item. The content is very poorly presented and most of the chapters are nothing more than badly assembled lists. There is a lack of quality interviews and the overuse of 'tacky' animation effects and cheesy voice overs really distracts from the few worthwhile points of interest.
One of the interviews on the Grand Canyon also has such bad sound quality you can barely understand what the person is saying.",1323907200,2,543,4.913043478260869
8400691,5,B003N3UE6Q,"I am a documentary filmmaker and I have been to film school and read many books and articles on make documentaries. This video fills a great niche. The producers make a doc within a doc and explain many of the common issues you encounter when making a film. Done in a light hearted manner with plenty of laughs the film keeps it simple without skimping on great useful information for documentary director/producers. They illustrate a lot of things you won't hear in film school but that are vitally important.

I recommend this to people at every level of production and filmmaking, I doubt anyone will come away without something new.",1316131200,,636,4.781818181818182
8400692,5,B003N3UE6Q,"Though I do agree with the first reviewer about wanting it to play from beginning to end without having to play scene by scene, but I realize I like to let it all the way through a few times while I am multi-tasking... meaning, I'm not paying enough attention.  So, I actually sat, took notes and watched it without cleaning or cooking or emailing at the same time.

This is for film makers that want to do documentary and teachers or trainers that might want to do some multimedia work with their talent.  I felt it addressed the need of those on a low budget as well as those with investors (that aren't related).
I might actually say, this is ""over-produced"" but it reminds me that Guy practices what he preaches.  So, why not make it the best it can be?

This was a big help to get some structure before you start.  I didn't feel it made my first video excellent, but I knew when I finished what I could fix and how to fix it myself or hire someone who could.  In the end, I would say helped me get started on the right work and make my video better than it would have been.

Still much to learn, but the video was a great place to start!  I've watched it 3 times.

Nice when the person educating me has a sense of humor... easy to watch and digest.",1315180800,,1253,4.161825726141079
8400693,5,B003N3UE6Q,"Most 'how to' videos/DVDs can be incredibly boring.  Not this one!  I have some knowledge on filmmaking but this documentary was very informative, I learned quite a few new things and it had some great humor to boot!  Definitely a 'must own' DVD for anyone who's interested in film making!  I think this would be a great tool for film making schools/colleges.",1288051200,2,359,4.741935483870968
8400694,4,B003N3UE6Q,"I produce instructional DVDs for a living.  However, it doesn't matter how much you know, or think you know, there's always something new that you can learn.  I love this DVD.  I covers all the bases of documentary film making, and then some.  The only thing that annoys me is the fact that after every chapter the disc returns to the chapter menu and you have to select the next chapter manually.  I don't know if the author did this on purpose to force the audience to stay awake but I hate it!!!  Almost any other DVD on the planet will play from beginning to end with just pressing the PLAY button once.

If it weren't for this bugging little fact the program would have been perfect.  Maybe Mr. Noffsinger could correct it in a future revision.

8400695,5,B003N3UE6Q,"As someone who's met Guy Noffsinger before, I was anxious to get my hands on HOW TO MAKE A DOCUMENTARY and have enjoyed watching and learning from this GREAT DVD. Guy's passion and knowledge for non-fiction filmmaking are generously shared here and I cannot recommend it enough to everyone! I honestly believe that it's a great tool for not only beginners and but also seasoned filmmakers who need a refresher or a little something extra to bring them to that ""Ah-ha!"" moment. Any filmmakers who also happen to teach filmmaking to students can make themselves look like rock stars and show this to their classes as well.",1275696000,3,620,4.803738317757009
