174368,5,0982153309,"I bought this product to use when teaching Macbeth to high school seniors.  The interviews were very useful in helping the students understand plot and the motivation for characters to behave the way they did.  I did break up the viewing over several days.  The interview format would have been too monotonous to show all at once.  The students didn't care much for the songs, but they loved the medieval commercials.  Also, I found that more students than I thought really paid attention to the news crawl at the bottom of the page.  I would definitely use this video again in my classroom.",1268352000,,591,4.689320388349515
174369,4,0982153309,"A lot of the material here was great, but some of it wasn't as useful. If you are teaching Macbeth, I would recommend getting this, previewing it, and using the parts you like. As a plus, my kids thought that it was pretty funny.",1267660800,,229,4.2272727272727275
174370,5,0982153309,"My students are absolutely enchanted by ths video. As video/television consumers, they are already familiar with the interview/talk show format and are able to process the multiple streams of information easily. They have been able to keep up quite well with the character interviews, the scenes, and the ticker tape crawl of information on the screen. The characters become more accessible to the students as they evolve during Holinshed's interviews. This video is very well written and is right on target in terms of relevant, scholarly analysis. My students also love the commercials and the summary song. Many, many have remarked that my using this video in short bursts in class has reinforced and/or extended their understanding.",1260921600,3,736,5.299145299145299
174371,5,0982153309,"I ordered This is Macbeth hoping to find something that help spark some interest in studying the Bard. I was very impressed with the DVD.  Now that I have used it once, I know that the next time I will make better use of it.  The songs are a bit corny, but the acting was good and key lines from the original helped students connect the old and the new.",1238284800,11,353,4.0285714285714285
174372,5,0982153309,This video is hilarious and very inventive. I learned more about Macbeth from this video than any cliff-notes. Awesome!,1234051200,5,119,5.315789473684211
174373,5,0982153309,"Finally, a contemporary approach to teaching Shakespeare that works!

Having preformed and directed Shakespeare since the early 70s, including teaching at the high school level, I have had a chance to see a number of attempts to make Shakespeare understandable to the younger audience -- and most of them were just so-so.  This Is Macbeth, thankfully, is superb.  The makers of this combine a spot-on understanding of the issues and concepts in Macbeth with a highly entertaining and contemporary vehicle to convey them.  They use an ""interview"" format with the actors.  The interviewer asks very penetrating questions to understand what is happening in this story from the actors point of view.  But the actors are in character, so the modern interviewer is questioning the characters themselves who interact with him and each other in a very conversational way. This really gets the ideas, sometimes subtle and difficult, across in a way anyone can relate to. Furthermore, the questions are in the order of the plays action so one gets drawn into the story almost immediately including the real suspense that comes from it as the story progresses.  The ""commercial"" breaks are very funny and also tie into modern culture in a way that makes this entire effort extremely accessible to today's audience.  The acting is quite good and when it breaks to the actual scenes from the play they are by then, very understandable and oh so interesting.

This is a very clever and successful piece of work.  I think this has great application to students through high school and college.  Frankly, for almost anyone initially, Shakespeare can be difficult to access but a tool like this is just what is needed to bring his great and universal observations to life.  Now-- this team needs to develop the same type of approach for all his plays.  Now that would be something for every school library!",1232928000,15,1889,4.958730158730159
174374,5,0982153309,"I teach high school Shakespeare workshops.
This Is Macbeth proved to be a useful tool in keeping their attention while giving them the information they need to understand the play.",1231200000,3,180,5.033333333333333
174375,5,0982153309,"Insightful and humorous, ""This Is Macbeth"" weaves together dramatic scenes, ""off-stage"" interviews, and cogent analyses to help students experience Shakespeare in a relevant, highly enjoyable way.
Between exciting stagings of the most memorable scenes, characters step behind the curtain to discuss their motivations, while medieval historian/talk-show host Ralph Holinshed provides historical background and explores the play's themes.
Hilarious 11th-century advertisements and news ticker commentary blend past and present to paint a picture of Macbeth's and Shakespeare's times, offering context for students while simultaneously demonstrating the many ways in which the play and its themes are still pertinent today.
In short, ""This Is Macbeth"" both educates and entertains. If you are a student who loves Macbeth and wants to deepen your understanding, a student who can't relate to Macbeth but must read it anyway, or a teacher with students of either type, I'd highly recommend this movie!",1230508800,24,996,5.828767123287672
174376,4,0982153309,"For the uninitiated, Shakespeare's plays can be pretty impenetrable.  This movie solves that problem with an entertaining exploration of the Scottish Play.  A mix of CNN-style interviews with the characters, scenes from the play, and goofy commercials, this movie is a must for all english teachers who wish to breathe new life into the material.",1229644800,7,346,5.2727272727272725
7795063,5,0982153309,"A fantastic exploration of Macbeth full of insight, action, and humor.  Extremely entertaining, enlightening, and enjoyable. Highly recommended.  If you're teaching Macbeth in your classroom, you need to show this video.",1522108800,,220,6.064516129032258
7795064,5,0982153309,"As an English teacher for 15 years, I have never found a resource that effectively grabs the students attention like this one. The students listened to the audio Act by Act, and then we watched each chapter as it applied to that Act. They remembered so many quotes! I was able to do my Macbeth unit in 2 weeks, and they learned more than if I had taught it in 6 weeks. It was awesome!",1491523200,,384,4.133333333333334

7795067,5,0982153309,"This version of the Tragedy of Macbeth, performed like a talk show interspersed with theatrical performance of key scenes, goofy ads and a catchy tune summary, is the most comprehensible and accessible to students that I have found. While students professed to be ""bored"" with the interviews preferring the action of other versions, students consistently grasped the change in the Macbeth's as the play progressed and understood the theater or movie versions much better.  Discussions of both character and actions in the play moved beyond surface level translation with the addition of This Is Macbeth. Subsequently written work from students was thorough and thoughtful. Without fail students left class humming the tune from This Is Macbeth in spite of their ""boredom"". I highly recommend this version of Macbeth if you want to understand the play or are teaching this play.",1412812800,,877,5.264285714285714
7795068,4,0982153309,Video was excellent.  It needs to have a way to access each act. It was very difficult to show act by act as I was teaching it.,1397865600,,127,3.7037037037037037
7795069,5,0982153309,"I have tried many film versions of Macbeth to help my students understand the Bard, but this is a great supplement to their studies.  It explores not only the language, but the motives and emotions of the characters, and does it in a satirical, talk-show format, with ""commercials"" and songs.  The students really get it!  The porter scene is great!",1388016000,,349,4.783333333333333

7795071,5,0982153309,"I have used This is MacBeth in a senior literature class to go along with the reading of the play.  Seniors watched it with interest and liked the interview format.  Even those who didn't understand all the humor of the interview enjoyed the commercials and got into the spirit of it.

I love this format so much, I have taken it home and viewed it a few times while my young children have wandered in and out of the room, and now my 12-year-old goes around singing ""MacBeth, MacBeth...You're such a huge success"".

See this DVD!  You will be singing the catchy MacBeth song as well.  I highly recommend this as an alternative or even supplement to viewing the play after reading the text.",1302134400,,689,4.516129032258065
7795072,5,0982153309,"I'm a senior in the English Honors program at my high school and my teacher showed us this as a way to review Macbeth before our test. Cynicism seems to be an epidemic where I live, so I think some of my classmates thought it was dumb. It is a bit cheesy, especially in the review songs and commercials, and is probably best meant for middle-school students or high school freshmen. BUT, if it seems awkward, it's a very lovable kind of awkward, in a good way.

Probably the best part about this is that it breaks down a Shakespeare play (normally a source of terror for high school students) and completely breaks it down into something that ANYBODY can understand, and understand completely. They do a fantastic plot in explaining the plot, including little bits that the average student or amateur Shakespeare reader would not know (for example, explaining the title of ""Thane"", which is similar to a lord or governor of a state). It also features reenactments of important scenes using the original text; the actors are talented enough so that the audience doesn't stumble over the phrasing Shakespeare used back then.

Other than the cheesiness factor, this is just amazing in every single way: Informative, funny, cute, and very genuine. If you're a teacher or a Shakespeare lover, you should consider getting this. No regrets guaranteed.",1291939200,,1344,4.864628820960698
