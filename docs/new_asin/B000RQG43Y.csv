8325675,2,B000RQG43Y,"THE RISEN:

This is a low budget version of ""Predator"" except we don't see the actual killings and they lace the film with comic book scenes to save money. The special effects were pretty bad and it would have been a better film if they had used more comic book pictures instead of low budget special effects. An alien is attacking a community. The film centers on a core group, but then deviates to total strangers whenever it needs to have it kill someone.

The scenes are dark and mostly shot at night. A lot of screaming in the dark type of stuff. Poor camera action to go along with the stiff dialogue.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, no sex, shower nudity- An odd scene where a teen gets out of the shower to answer the phone where she says she would do nudity in a film. Seems like they were trying to launch a career, but I didn't see her in the credits.

WICKED GAMES:

Mrs. Wolf believes her husband is having an affair. P.I. Gary (Kevin Scott Crawford) is called to investigate. As it turns out Mr. Dean Wolf (R.M. Hoopes) is having an affair...and it is with Gary's wife (Patricia Paul)!

Despondent, Gary turns to his friend Dan (Joel D. Wynkoop) who is also a bit kinky with Ginger (Patricia Paul) who likes to mix sex and pain. Gary becomes suicidal. People are suddenly being killed by a guy in a mask. Our three suspects have three distinctive hair styles and we get to see the hair of the man wearing the mask. It is an interesting film with some good scenes and potential that misses the mark.
