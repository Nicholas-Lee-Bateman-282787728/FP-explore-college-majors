684034,1,6303588999,"I was so happy to finally get a DVD of this 80's comedy, its like a ""Police Academy"" knock off. But the cast is amazing for an 80's movie. Bunch of talented actors. I got it in the mail yesterday from Amazon, part of the new DVD-R on demand titles. The transfer is terrible! It comes from a Pan & Scan VHS source and looks horrible. I love this movie and sad about this. This film was released by Columbia pictures and deserves better! Please Remaster & Widescreen it!",1375142400,,468,4.269662921348314
684035,5,6303588999,"This is one of the best entries in the T+A 80s comedies genre (my personal favorite).

Columbia Tri-Star released the VHS - so I'm wondering as to why there still hasn't been a DVD release. This film has been forgotten too long - and stands up with flicks such as ""Hot Moves""; ""Ski School"" and ""Hardbodies"" as a favorite of mine.

Please re-master this title.

For now - if you haven't seen this - and enjoy any of the above titles - grab the VHS before it too is no longer available.",1348185600,5,484,4.239130434782608

7850680,3,6303588999,"Stewardess School follows the formula of Police Academy, only this time it's a Stewardess school.  It's the same scenario, a once proud institution has lowered the bar so anyone can apply, which of course angers one of the long term trainers who plans on failing those she doesn't see who belong before they become actual stewardesses.  You've got a prostitute being made to attend, who uses her skills to right wrongs and get results.  You've got  two pilot trainees, one who is hiding the fact he is blind without some thick lens glasses who crash a flight simulator, the one who can see wants them to join to get women.  You've got a klutz who causes accidents for those around her, just like Police Academy had.  You've got the low self esteem less attractive girl.  The up herself pretty girl who is serious about a stewardess career.  The daughter of the stock exchange big wig, who has a bad multicoloured hair dye job and is dating a biker who is making her get an education in return for a top model Harley gift from the father.  The cover photo by the way isn't her on the bike, that's the prostitute.

For me this too closely copies Police Academy rather than coming up with much of its own. You've even got the ""Moove it! Moove it!"" line through the hand held loud speaker, when for some reason they are doing hardcore obstacle course long distance running training that is pretty irrelevant to become a flight attendant.  The movie is basically two parts, the training and their first flight assignment for an airline where they of course have to save the day from a terrorist and the plane crashing.  The second is where the film has some originality.

Like most 80's films of the time there's plenty of topless scenes.  Not much of a soundtrack though.",1468800000,,1767,4.585987261146497

7850686,5,6303588999,One of my favorite 80's comedies!! It has tons of laughs and lot of giggles!! High flying fun from beginning to end!!,1406592000,,117,4.363636363636363
7850687,3,6303588999,"""Stewardess School"" is a nearly forgotten entry from the 80's, and it isn't too surprising tbh. Though entertaining; it's far from being the best of its kind, and the laughs are extremely scarce.

The film is somewhat like the much better ""Police Academy"". Two guys who fail pilot school decide to enroll in Stewardess School instead.
That's pretty much it. There's a motley crue of other characters who are also in training, and lots of 80's (and mostly unfunny) humor.
I'm sure critics had a field day with this one in the 80's, but this wasn't ever meant to be Platoon (which came out the same year), and the film serves its purpose. It's stupid, it's fun, it's 80's.
I may've not have laughed much (though comedy IS subjective, and what I may not find funny, another person may), but I definitly wasn't bored!
The cast here is pretty good, and everyone is fairly likable. Retro tv fans will have a good time pointing out all the sitcom stars of the 70's and 80's.
The film is R rated, but it's somewhat on the fence of a harder PG-13 and a light R. There's some sexual content, but not a whole lot of nudity (about as much as ""Police Academy"" had). I thought a film where 2 guys join an almost all female stewardess school would be full of nudity, but this one stays rather classy. Whether that's a good or bad thing depends on the viewer.

Overrall I quite enjoyed the film. It isn't award worthy or smart, but sometimes it's good to turn the brain off and watch something like this. If you aren't a fan of films like ""Police Academy""; it won't be this one that makes you a fan, but those who are (or people who just love 80's films in general) will really like this.
Hopefully one day it'll get a proper dvd release.",1386806400,,1722,4.394984326018808
