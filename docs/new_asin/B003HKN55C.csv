4125913,4,B003HKN55C,"First I will say that I enjoyed watching these 3 Dvds as they brought back memories of the time when I watched Sesame Street. Unfortunately, my daughter was not as excited as I was.  As other reviewers have written, they are the older videos.  I will keep putting them on for her to see if she warms up to them, but they just aren't as exciting for her as the Kids Favorite Songs 1 and 2, or Count With Me.  My daughter is 2y4m.",1426636800,,428,4.071428571428571
4125914,4,B003HKN55C,"These stories are compiled from old Sesame Street episodes.  My 23-month-old particularly loves the ""Numbers Game"" video, as it is filled with catchy songs in a variety of styles.  My only regret is that somehow, the ""Sing, Hoot and Howl"" DVD got cracked inside the DVD case within a few days of arrival, so we only got to enjoy that one a few times.  Children's Television Workshop, keep the DVDs but give me a more toddler-proof case, please!",1381363200,,444,4.666666666666667
4125915,5,B003HKN55C,"It is old school sesame street. So, my hubby and I had a blast singing along. While my children have learned so much and watched it over and over again.

4125916,3,B003HKN55C,"These DVD's are of old Sesame Street and my son was not interested in the ""learning about letters"" or ""the great numbers game"" videos.  My son loves elmo and sesame street but for some reason these just do not keep his attention.",1349222400,,229,4.4523809523809526
4125917,5,B003HKN55C,"This DVD set contains three 30-minute Sesame Street episodes.  They are the older episodes, and the graphics show that.  However, my twins (now 16 months) absolutely LOVE them.  Not only are they very educational, but they are glued to them the whole time and have been for the last several months.  The DVDs include The Great Numbers Game, The Letter Chase, and Sing, Hoot, and Howl.  My boys love these more than the newer Sesame Street videos.",1304553600,3,446,4.740259740259741
