8390011,5,B0036IJ7ES,"I saw this movie on TV as a young adult, and I still think about it often. A lawman is just sick and tired of chasing a man, and decides another man will stand in just fine for the real desperado he seeks. How do you prove your not the real bad guy? Well, you can't, so you'd better just run. I loved the way Audie Murphy's character handled every situation thrown his way. I particularly enjoyed the way he just walked away from the girl at the end. She'd been such a pain throughout the whole thing, and it was right for him to do that. So refreshing from the usual love scene ending.",1331942400,,586,4.104347826086957
