The main problem is that the actor is constantly on-screen, but lacks the skill to maintain an interesting presence. I could have done without his insane laughter- it was less diabolical and more grating. Someone send that man to an actor's workshop!

Better to rent ""Ave Maria"", for a similar attempt at the genre.",1378598400,,408,4.913043478260869
8440493,5,B004T4N3K2,"Although this is a low budget movie I really enjoyed it. There are some gruesome scenes and alot of blood. The movie starts out with a father and his kids returning home from a night out, and a few strange things occur. The father[played by John Reign}
decides to send the kids off for a few days in an attempt to find out what is happening in his home. With his camera set up he waits and documents everything. But wait! Something has happened to him: Here we meet Ned. What begins to happen next is a series of killings,all documented and on film. Gruesome, bloody and even some humor. I won't say anymore, just buy a copy and find out what happened to the father ,and just who ned is. If you have a weak stomach beware!",1302652800,,722,4.239130434782608
8440494,3,B004T4N3K2,"Watch out folks! This is one mean and NASTY flick! It starts out like a 'Paranormal Activity' clone with some SERIOUSLY SCARY moments (including a single scary shot that is really haunting) but eventually turns into a series of nasty serial killings recorded on video. The entire movie is shot in POV and it's about a guy who is trying to get evidence of a haunting in this creepy house. Without ruining the twist I'll just say that it's worth checking out ONLY if you are ready to see some very nasty kills that look like a faux sn*ff film.

Unfortunately the FX are really bad which ruins the authenticity of some of the kill scenes but the ideas and the execution of the scenes are textbook examples of how to shock your audience with no budget. The main guy does tend to ramble on at times and is a bit obnoxious but thankfully the scenes of horror aren't too far apart. As long as you know what you're getting into you might like it, but it's also easy to understand why some may hate it.",1302480000,2,993,4.338709677419355
