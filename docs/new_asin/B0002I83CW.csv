8028092,5,B0002I83CW,"Ignore the ""cowtipper"" review below, he's not even talking about this video, it is NOT a documentary - and he obviously stepped in something when tipping over a cow. This a great video with good moves one after another showing the Brazilian style of soccer they are famous for. It's thorough, well thought out and progressive in difficulty - Simon Clifford knows how to teach. My 9 y.o. is learning a lot from GOl. I put it on the top tier of soccer instructional dvd's along with Skill Factor.",1438992000,,494,4.561797752808989
8028093,1,B0002I83CW,"After waiting 5 MONTHS to receive this video, it was greatly disappointing.  Boring documentary that offers little insight into either soccer or Brazil, and NO instructional value to an aspiring player.  My son loves soccer, is fascinated by Brazil, and watched this video ONCE before declaring it a dissapointment.  Buy another video!",1292889600,,335,5.403846153846154
8028094,4,B0002I83CW,"Mr. Woo will not work after about 2 minutes on most US DVD players.  Other bonus features were boring for my kids.  For a great detailed review of this DVD and several others, the following soccer help site is a good resource.  They highly recommend the main feature portion of this video.

""Though we had expected to be able to send this item to you, we've since found that it is not available from any of our sources at this time.  We realize this is disappointing news to hear, and we apologize for the inconvenience we have caused you.""

""We must also apologize for the length of time it has taken us to reach this conclusion.  Until recently, we had still hoped to obtain this item for you.""

Funny thing is it still says it will ship in 1 to 3 weeks and it is sold and shipped from Amazon.

I am sure the DVD is great - This is no knock on ""GOL!""

Amazon gets the Red Card on this one!",1147910400,2,670,3.955223880597015
8028096,5,B0002I83CW,"I've been playing soccer for over 10 years and have seen most of the major videos.  I had no idea what to expect when I got this video - I actually had bought it mainly since it had Mr. Woo on there.  But, this turned out to be one of the best advanced individual skills videos I've seen.  This video is geared for the advanced player - if you're beginner/intermediate, most of the other videos or just clips off the net will cover basics like Matthews, Cruyff move, etc.  This video doesn't waste a lot of time with that (which I really enjoyed).  You'll see alot of moves to beat an opponent, freestyle/juggling tricks, etc. not covered in other videos I've seen.  Recommended if you want to take your game to the next level.",1111795200,9,727,4.388059701492537
