8651560,5,B00JJW7S82,"Although I am not pregnant and am not planning on being so, I ordered the two new Ballet Baby sets anyways, hoping that they'd be similar to Mary Helen's prenatal streaming workouts, which I did when I subscribed to her online service for one month. My review, then, will be geared towards those of us who are not expecting, but who are interested in purchasing these, as I was. I have only had the chance to preview these so far, but I can tell that I'm going to love these just as much as I love Mary Helen's other Ballet Beautiful workouts. These definitely do not disappoint!

~~ DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO NEW ""BALLET BABY"" DUOS ~~~

I ended up ordering both this duo and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballet-Baby-Energized-Elegant-Pregnancy-Bundle/dp/B00S7GK572/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballet Baby: Energized & Elegant Pregnancy Bundle</a>&nbsp;duo directly from Ballet Beautiful before I even knew what the workouts would be like just because I love the BB workouts so much. I wasn't sure what the difference between the two sets was, but, after hunting around a bit, I found an online article (from _The Daily Mail_) that said this:

""The first series is Fit and Graceful, a more gentle introductory workout designed for women who aren't familiar with Mary Helen's techniques. 'This is for people that maybe are new to Ballet Beautiful, who haven't worked out with me before and want to get started, to change their muscles but in a more sort of gentle way,' she explained.""

The same article also went on to say this:

""For Mary Helen's more experienced students - like supermodel Doutzen Kroes, who trained with her while pregnant with daughter Myllena - there's the more advanced Energized and Elegant series. 'This is the DVD for people who've done Ballet Beautiful for a while,' says Mary Helen. 'So for myself or for someone like Doutzen, who's going into pregnancy already ultra fit and used to a challenging workout.'""

~~~ BACKGROUND INFO ~~~

In each workout, it's just Mary Helen, and she's in what looks to be her home studio. It's a beautiful space, with flowers in the background and a window. Mary Helen looks radiant and beautiful as always, and it's fun to see her working out while she was pregnant with her daughter Lumina Belle.

As with her other workouts, Mary Helen does four sets of eight for most exercises, and she counts out each rep. This doesn't bother me and I find it meditative, but I wanted to point this out since I know it bothers some viewers.

To do the workouts on both DVDs, you'll need a yoga mat, a chair or barre, and some light handweights.

~~~FIT AND GRACEFUL - ""Trimesters 2 and 3"" DVD~~~
On the main menu, you have an ""Intro to Ballet Baby"" one-minute segment, along with the three main segments of the DVD, just as you do with the ""Trimesters 1 &2"" disk:

* Mat Workout -- 30 minutes
* Standing Work -- 30 minutes
* Gentle Stretch -- 10 minutes

There is also the great ""Play All"" feature on this disk, too, so you can string all three workouts together.

The Mat Workout is just under 28 minutes long on this disk. She does more arm work in this one, and uses two-pound handweights to do biceps curls and arm rotations. There are also some variations on lying leg lifts on this one. The Standing Work segment on this one uses the barre or a chair, and comes in at just over 30 minutes. It includes some plie variations, along with some short swan arms work.

The Gentle Stretch is ten minutes long, and is different from the one on the Trimesters 1 and 2 disk. This one emphasizes stretching the quads more, whereas the other one focuses more on the hamstrings.

~~~ OVERALL NOTES ~~~

In both workouts, Mary Helen does her usual stretches between moves. Although these short stretches may not seem like they're doing much, they really do help keep your legs feeling limber and long. I've also noticed that she does more stretching in these DVDs than in her previous ones; she holds the poses for longer, too.

The moves are varied enough, though, that these don't feel at all like repeats of her previous four workouts, and I'm really glad that I got these. Although, as mentioned earlier, these are designed to be more beginner workouts, I can see that they will raise my heartrate and give me a great workout.

I will be sure to update my review since I plan to do these for the next month or so, mixed in with a little cardio.

UPDATE 11/9/14: I just got done doing this for the first time, and really enjoyed it. It's not quite as challenging as the Trimesters 1 and 2 disk from this ""blue"" set because she doesn't do quite as many reps and she moves more slowly, but I still felt nicely worked out. At the start of the workout (in the Intro segment), Mary Helen says that she was eight months pregnant when she filmed this disk, which I'm sure is why it's not as fast-paced as the Trimester 1 and 2 disk. Overall, I'm still really pleased with these!

UPDATE ON 12/28/14:  I gifted a copy of this to a friend who is just about to start her second trimester, and she said that she absolutely loves it.  The exercises aren't too difficult, and she said that she especially appreciates all of the stretching.",1423526400,,5543,4.817702845100105

~~~ DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO NEW SETS ~~~

I ended up ordering both sets directly from Ballet Beautiful before I even knew what the workouts would be like just because I love the BB workouts so much.

~~~ OVERVIEW INFORMATION ~~~

In each workout on all four DVDs, it's just Mary Helen, and she's in what looks to be her home studio. It's a beautiful space, with flowers in the background and a window. I love how light and cheery the space is, and know it'll be nice to workout with this beautiful background as we head into the winter months.  Mary Helen looks radiant and beautiful as always, and it's fun to see her working out while she was pregnant with her daughter Lumina Belle.

As with her other workouts, Mary Helen does four sets of eight for most exercises, and she counts out each rep. This doesn't bother me and I find it meditative, but I wanted to point this out since I know it bothers some viewers.  The high rep format is great for hourglass shapes, and last year I had some impressive results when I was just alternating her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballet-Beautiful-Total-Body-Workout/dp/B008F283J0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballet Beautiful: Total Body Workout</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballet-Beautiful-Body-Blast/dp/B009FFHWRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballet Beautiful: Body Blast</a>&nbsp;workouts, with no cardio.  I lost weight and leaned up, and had better results in just three weeks of using BB than I did with 42 days of Tracy Anderson.

Classical music from Beethoven and Bach also plays in the background of each one.

To do the workouts on both DVDs, you'll need a yoga mat, a chair or barre, and some light handweights. You can also wear socks, but I love wearing my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Capezio-Women-s-Daisy-Ballet-Shoe/dp/B002CQTY84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Capezio Women's Daisy Ballet Shoe</a>&nbsp;to feel more like a ballerina.  ;-)

~~~ ""TRIMESTERS 1 AND 2"" DISK ~~~

On the main menu, you have an ""Intro to Ballet Baby"" one-minute segment, along with the three main segments of the DVD:

* Mat Workout -- just under 30 minutes
* Standing Work -- about 30 mintues
* 15-Minute Gentle Stretch

There is also the great ""Play All"" feature so you can string all three workouts together.

The Mat Workout has a lot of variation on inner and outer thigh work, along with some leg lifts, where Mary Helen is leaning on a low stool for support. There is also some nice ab/C-curve work.

The Standing Work segment doesn't use a barre or chair, but does use light weights. There is a lot of nice standing leg work, along with some weighted triceps and shoulder work.

In none of the four workouts will you find bridge work, which makes sense since I imagine that it's contraindicated for pregnant women.  That being said, I find Mary Helen's bridge work to be excellent for tonight the rear end, so it's worth picking up her Classic or Blasts DVD for the bridge sequences.

~~~ OVERALL NOTES ~~~

For those who are pregnant, Mary Helen also gives good form pointers throughout, and she also encourages you to think about your belly and your limitations.

In both workouts, Mary Helen does her usual stretches between moves. Although these short stretches may not seem like they're doing much, they really do help keep your legs feeling limber and long. I've also noticed that she does more stretching in all four of the Ballet Baby DVDs than in her previous ones; she holds the poses for longer, too.

The moves are varied enough, though, that these don't feel at all like repeats of her previous four workouts.  There are, of course, some repeat moves, but the thing you can't argue with is that these workouts really work.

As mentioned above, I've finally come to learn that low-weight, high-rep workouts work best for my hourglass shape, and all of the leg extensions that Mary Helen does work quickly to slim down my thighs.  I also know that Mary Helen also trains some of the Victoria's Secrets models, as well as Alexa Chung, and they always look toned and fit.

Overall, I'm really pleased that I got these! As mentioned at the start of my review, pregnant women may have a different view of this set, but as a non-expecting woman, these two new sets feel fresh to me, and they don't feel like they are just for pre-natal women.  I had been worried that these might not be good for non-pregnant women, but that won't be the case at all.  They look just as challenging as her non-prenatal, regular workouts.

I'll be sure to update my review as I use these over the next few weeks, but I've had great results in the past from using just Ballet Beautiful workouts (with no extra cardio), and know that I'll get the same results from these, too! :-)",1415318400,7,6593,5.120335820895522
