8584120,4,B000BRBAS8,A friend of mine from Memphis brought the DVD to me and I was expecting to see something with ALOT of SOUTHERN flair..but what I saw was a WELL PUT TOGETHER DVD! I wished that there were MORE songs on the DVD!!!!! It was a different set up as it relates to the presentation. It was not just a choir standing on stage singing songs...it was definitely HIGH ENERGY! You couldn't hear any overdubs (if there were any??). The music was clear...runs were clean! You could tell that the choir was enjoying themselves...it seemed like EVERYONE was on point on the night of this recording. GET THE ALBUM!!! It's worth it! Darrel Petties is a blessing to the industry..and I can't wait for the NEXT DVD/CD!!!!,1144713600,,700,4.563492063492063
