1787253,5,B00006RCNX,"Season 3 of Buffy was a tremendous improvement from the other two seasons before it.  The Buffy seasons get better every time, and as such this season was very well done. If you are a fan of Buffy, then by all means purchase this when it is available.  If you are not a fan, I still highly recommend that you watch this show; it's in a league of its own.",1023580800,2,354,4.042857142857143
1787254,5,B00006RCNX,"The thrid season hasn't been released in the states yet on DVD, but it's available over here in wee tiny Britain and there aren't enough positive words on the planet to describe how good this season and the DVD is. Season three eases up on the darker and morbid tone that season two had, though only a little. The season begins with a still AWOL Buffy, a still dead Angel and a very different hair style for Willow. Season three has to be the only season so far not to contain one dud episode (season one we won't count in this because it's only half a season). Season two had Go Fish, season four had Beer Bad and Doomed (to name a couple), season five had I Was Made to Love You and just pick any random episode from season six. But there isn't one episode in season three that I would class as bad or below par.
The writers and actors certainly know their characters inside out by this point.
There's too many story arcs, plot twists and new characters to go through them all, but season three introduces the Mayor, who we had heard about but never seen, we get to see the new slayer Faith, who seems to be dancing on the edge of sanity, we see the vampire versions of Xander and Willow, the brief return of Spike, more chaos from Ethan Raine, Angel's resurrection, more magical antics from Amy, the introduciton of a not so human Anya, Willow's growing Wicca powers, sixteen year old versions of Giles and Joyce (though they still look their actual age) and all your usual emotional turmoil that our favourite characters are thrown into.",1022803200,13,1541,4.429577464788732
1787255,5,B00006RCNX,"Season three: How can the cast of Buffy even hope to top the glorious second season?  Well, for starters the very first episode is great. In ""ANNE"", still hurting from the events that occurred at the end of season 2, Buffy tries to forget her past and lives in another town working a waitress job until a girl recognizes her and asks for her help. Buffy realizes who and what she is and returns to Sunnydale, where the Scoobies have been filling in for the Slayer's absence. Then there is the addition of a new Slayer, Faith (Eliza Dukshu...remember her in True Lies?  All grown up!!) who appears in Sunnydale as a powerful ally for the Buffy and the scoobies. This is short-lived though, as she soon becomes one of their greatest threats.  The foreshadowing of plotlines in the second season become apparent as this season's villain is introduced...none other than the mayor of Sunnydale, who is attempting to ascend into a true/pure demon.
This season boasts many of the show's strongest episodes such as ""The Wish"", where Cordelia unknowingly makes a wish to a vengeance demon (Anyanka, who becomes the Anya we all love to laugh at later) and wishes that Buffy never came to Sunnydale.  This episode is grand, as we see an alternate reality where Buffy left California and never stopped the Master from rising and as a result, he succeeded in opening the Hellmouth. Truly one of the better episodes.  We also are given a taste of foreshadowing in later episodes...Buffy's sister Dawn (to come in season 5) is mentioned in a glimmer of dialogue that will remain meaningless until two years later (can you find the episode? Hint...listen to both Faith and Buffy talk in the later epsiodes).  Faith is terrific as Buffy's nemesis, a Slayer just like her.  Oh, did I mention Angel returns from a hell dimension as well?
The scoobies get their own star time as well.  In  ""THE ZEPPO"", Xander proves that he is more than just the weak part of the group, adept at getting them donuts and not much else.  In ""THE WISH"" and ""DOPPLEGANGLAND"", we get to see a Vamp Willow...very interesting and two of the season's best episodes.  This season also brings us more of the Watcher's Council, the mysterious group that Giles works for including Wesley, who later leaves to aid Angel and Cordelia in Los Angeles in the spin-off show Angel. And finally, we get to see the Scoobies graduate in a very typical Sunnydale fashion...with a huge battle.  It was hard to top season two, but this season is more of Joss Whedon's masterpiece of television; let people and critics shun it...we all know great TV when we see it.",1022716800,141,2603,4.684210526315789
1787256,5,B00006RCNX,"I think you should release all 6 seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and QUICKER!  It's one of my favorite shows but I sometime don't feel like watching only the first season and once a week the new one.  I would like to view this fantastic show at my convenience.  And why are you deliberating.  People are willing to buy it so just make it already.  I want to own the 4th 5th and 6th season the most anyway so you're making me rather upset do-da-ing as to whether or not you're going to transfer those episodes that you already have on tape on to Dvd for resale.. I mean come on!  Do it for us fans already!",1022630400,12,610,4.127118644067797
1787257,5,B00006RCNX,"The third season of Buffy was one of the best seasons of the 6 out there today.  The extras are much better on this disc set that the season 2 set. I urge you to order this dvd as soon as possible and bring the wonderful world of buffy home! ( i know cheesy but, so what?)",1021852800,,272,3.7719298245614037
1787258,5,B00006RCNX,"I have seen pretty much all of the complete seasons of the shows as far as I know all the way up to Glory.  I don't know the titles of the shows so if there are any that I haven't seen I wouldn't be able to tell you.
I love all the story lines with the Love Story's between Buffy and Angel.  I feel they were good together and should have stayed together longer than they actually did.
They should have had more of Buffy and Angel crossovers on each others shows with their feelings involved.
Then Riley came along and I don't think they really gave him a chance to really get to know Buffy and spend time with her and court her before boom things happened between them and then he was gone.  They didn't spend as much time on that relationship as they should have.  It is like once Angel left even though they found someone else they didn't want to do much with the character because he main Love was Angel.
The Spike relationship was not what I expected.  It wasn't something you would have ever occured.  That may be what they were trying to put across to the audience but it wasn't the best they could have done.
She is an excellent actress and I think that her and the Scooby Gang and Giles all work together very well.  They are very funny, great to watch, things are always interesting with each and everyone of the characters. The actors and actresses that play them should be commended for the parts they played.  There were so many actors that never really got a chance to have more time on the show, like Forrest, Graham.
I know it was Buffy's show(Sarahs) but you do need to involve  the other actors in more dialogue with the show. I Love this show so much I tape almost every episode I can every day each time it is on so I have probably all the seasons on VHS.  I watch them continually.  I can't wait till all the seasons are out on DVD. I Loved the Prom, and it would have been nice to not have it end just at the dance. I am not a writer but there are areas like the snowy show when Angel finds out why he came back that they could have expanded on what happens when they walk down the street.  There are a few shows that would have been ended just a little more and still ended at a point that let the audience hanging.  The writers have done an excellent job on almost all of the shows.  Even though they are considered Horror shows there are times because of the dialogue that I am laughing because of what the characters end up saying. To me it is one of the best shows on TV.  It shows that we are getting rid of the evil in the world.",1021766400,2,2558,4.13939393939394
1787259,5,B00006RCNX,"The third season of Buffy was the pinnacle of the show's achievement.
Buffy has to regain her sense of mission and her shattered psyche, after being forced to dispatch the one great love of her life to hell - and then to reintegrate him into her and her friends' lives, upon his eventual return. In the wake of previous events, another Slayer has been activated and come to Sunnydale: Faith, who is altogether mad, bad, and dangerous to know. In due course, Faith grows from Buffy's adversarial colleague to her friend, and finally to jealous betrayer, selling Buffy and everyone she knows out to their worst enemy, Richard Wilkins III, demon Mayor of Sunnydale.
Though everything about this season is superior, its true highlight is the best pair of villains the series ever produced: Faith and the Mayor, played beautifully - and with an oddly touching personal chemistry - by Eliza Dushku and Harry Groener. The Mayor is a middle-aged murderer nerd, gleefully ordering his hench-vampires to kill civilians, while in the same breath reminding them, ""And boys? No swearing."" And Faith is a genuinely sad and tragic figure, though none the less evil for all that. The diabolical duo are not unlike a lethal Lolita and her horrific Humbert Humbert, a sort of surrogate father-daughter psychotic folie-a-deux.
All the episodes of this season are very good, and the all-time best episode of the series - and its sequel - are among them: ""The Wish,"" in which debuting Anya the Vengeance Demon grants Cordelia Chase a Sunnydale into which Buffy Summers never arrived, demonstrating exactly how much one person really can make a difference, and ""Doppelgangland,"" in which a diabolical double of Willow - a really wicked, and morbidly humorous, vampire - is brought from Cordelia/Anya's wish-world into real-life Sunnydale, to wreak havoc.
This entire season is, beyond question, Buffy at her best.",1021420800,19,1891,5.044728434504792

I'm a huge, huge, huge Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan. As in, when I'm not feeling good or down in the dumps, my husband knows to just put Buffy on and leave me to wallow. I'll eventually emerge feeling much better.
I'm not sure what happened to the VHS tapes I used to have, but they've managed to go missing long ago. Not that it would matter, since they're obsolete. I had always diverted back to Netflix whenever I wanted to watch my favorite show. However, Netflix has a nasty habit of just randomly dropping a title. Because of this, I'm slowly collecting the DVD sets.
I'll eventually buy one of the special edition box sets, but, for now, I'm enjoying these slim sets that I'm slowly picking up season by season. I like them because they take up little room and fit nicely on my shelf with our other movies and games.

1787501,5,B00006RCNX,"As Always Love this season! It captures the real essence of Buffy,When Faith Arrives she finds her while fighting with a vampire not knowing that she is a slayer to,then the tension between faith and buffy keeps growing...until faith discover the passion of being evil and kill people and gets carried away by evil altough angel try to convice her to repair at her mistakes.
altought he dos not make it faith goes to the mayor and tightens an allience with him and with his help to steal angel soul.
my opinion is that when I first saw this season I didn't know what brought Angel back in heart and I'm still confused on''The claddagh ring or the first evil''?! whatever they did not explain very well but I think that that the power of love is very intense and it can lead to positive conseguenses.
The connection between Faith and the Mayor is the knife that he gives at her ike a gratitude sign for the job done I think he truly care about faith but we all know that even if we care about someone altough we try to hide it because sometimes it hurts and I addmited I have done mistakes in my life but We can all make amends for that like Angel like Faith like Darla...we only should know ur personalities better and discovered our hearts.

Some story-lines could be construed as ""disturbing"" but you're watching a show about vampires and demons, so.... Besides that, there is extremely witty reparte, a few laughs, some surprises, and a whole lot of friendship going on.  You really need to pay attention since the details of the shows are outstanding.

Only problem with anything Whedon does for television is that he is always the trend setter so cancellation of his show is a possibility but then he is a cult classic after people realize they screwed up cancelling him.
Buffy was the best even when it was big they never got away from the fact it was ""Buffy the Vampire slayer"" based loosely on a bad movie, always kept it light, always making the jokes that made it good, while still having a story line.",1404518400,,565,4.320754716981132

1787596,5,B00006RCNX,"This third season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is yet again a superb season, much more graphic in it's violence and sexual content than the previous two. This had the most great episodes I've seen so far and answered a question I've had for a while, which was this, what if a vampire slayer either accidentally or deliberately kills a regular human being who was not a monster? and what are the consequences to such an action? The consequences are not as bad or satisfying as they should have been, but it was interesting to see it depicted in this season and very appropriately handled. I highly recommend this season. More of our beloved characters get to be a evil, a monster, a demon, a vampire, or what have you, and it's interesting to see them take on the role, be it briefly or long term. I am very pleased to say that we finally also get what I have wanted to see in Buffy the Vampire Slayer since season one, and that's.... Zombie's!!!! YES! Finally we get zombies! and not just one episode, but two! The main villain also of this season, The Mayor, is a very interesting character, likable, but yet you still know he is an evil motha... also, Spike makes an appearance in an episode totally dedicated to him, which was nice to see him again, I wish it was not just that single episode, but it was a hilarious and fun episode. So check this season out.

My favorite episodes of season 3:

Dead Man's Party
Revelations
Dopplegangeland
Bad Girls
Consequences
Enemies
Lovers Walk
Graduation Day: Part 1
Graduation Day: Part 2

1787598,5,B00006RCNX,"Sure, you could pick out episodes or arcs in other seasons that you might like better, but overall, from start to finish, Season 3 of Buffy was THE season. The Mayor is a formidable (and amusing) arch villain, while Buffy's new nemesis, Faith, is a perfect foil for ""perfect"" Buffy (I love the Faith arc, despite hating the actress, Eliza Dushku, who portrays her, which speaks volumes about the quality of the writing).

There are also outstanding standalone episodes, some of them refreshingly focusing on supporting characters like Xander ""The Zeppo"" and Cordelia ""The Wish"" and introduces us to Anya for the first time.

Season 3 is the first season where they really upped the production value of the show, and before it started showing its age (in Seasons 6 and 7).  This makes it a good ""gateway"" season if you're trying to convince a non-believer to give the show a chance. I know that's how I got hooked.",1402358400,,913,4.729559748427673

Eliza is just captivating, and the character of Faith fits her like the skin tight leather jeans she wears.  Good slayer vs. bad slayer, love, loss, jealousy, are all tangled up with fun freaky monsters, high kickin' fights, and Joss Whedon's trademark humor.  And have I mentioned Harry Groener as the evil mayor?  He is Mr Rogers on evil steroids in a bizzar little neighborhood, and is a joy to watch.

But thankfully, I quickly bought this season for a relatively decent price and got to my watching.

First of all, this season runs extremely consistent. There is definitely no episode that falls into the ranks of Bad Eggs, Inca Mummy Girl, or Teacher's Pet. The episode I hear  get the most criticized in this season is Gingerbread which I actually found interesting and entertaining. Some of the episode highlights were the hilarious Band Candy, my personal favorite The Wish, Willow starring in Doppelgangland, and the conclusion Graduation Day. I really enjoyed the inclusion of Faith in this season and found her to be an interesting and compelling new character. She is dark and edgy and her character progression was interesting. As for the other characters... Willow is starting to become my favorite character despite my dislike for her relationship with Xander, I will talk about this later, because of her awkward sweetness and new passion for witchcraft! I find her becoming a witch one of the best and most entertaining aspects of the show. Cordelia takes more of a background step further into this season. This is disappointing because I enjoy her witty comments and strange love for Xander. Her main episode, The Wish, is the best of the season. Giles is still coping for the loss of Jenny Calendar and has developed a fatherly love for his little Buffy. Which in all honesty, is one of my favorite friendships of the whole entire series. He genuinely cares about his slayer and must watch to not baby her, as difficult as it must be. And finally, I will talk about Angel and Buffy's relationship. Throughout this season, Angel arrives back in Sunnydale and is not evil once again. Him and Buffy try to resist the temptation and just be friends but as Spike says, they will never be just friends. By the near end of the season, things have heated up once again. But Angel decides to leave town and break up with Buffy once and for all so she can bring more normality to her strange life. This is an extremely healthy and mature choice on Angel's behalf. I was very happy with the way the relationship played out. What they had was beautiful but like many real life relationships, it was not healthy and had to end. This is an extremely good lesson for teenage girls to follow.

Second of all, I feel like this is the Majora's Mask of the Buffy show. It is very dark and plays like the aftermath to the amazing Second Season. But in exchange for the dark and high quality episodes we get in this season, we get a less amazing main plot and villain. The main big bad in this season is the mayor who wants to become a snake demon, Olvikan, on graduation day! While I did like his special effects and thought he was an overall good antagonist, it was impossible for him to live up to Spike, Drusilla, and evil Angel from the previous season. The season final, Graduation Day Pt. 1 & Pt. 2, was well worth the wait and fun episodes to watch despite not having the same heart wrenching effect of Becoming Pt. 1 and Pt. 2. Despite having technically a better row of strong and consistent episodes, this season is just as not classic or memorable as Season 2. I do not get the same rush of excitement and feeling watching these episodes. But that is okay! Most television series would die for a season as high quality as this. I cannot live in the amazement of Season 2 forever.

One complaint!
I could not stand Xander and Willow's relationship in the beginning of this season. All throughout her life, Willow had a crush on Xander, her best friend since they were little children. He never returned her feelings and began going out with popular girl Cordelia and crushing over Buffy instead. While she was very upset for a while, she began a relationship with the werewolf Oz. In this season, during a scene of Willow trying on dresses in front of Xander he realizes how beautiful she really is and gets caught in the moment and they *gulp* kiss! After this, they begin to somewhat hook up behind their boyfriend and girlfriend's backs and eventually get caught. While I could see Xander doing this, this seemed extremely out of character for the honest and sweet Willow. I am not saying she is a perfect angel, but there is no way she had it in her heart to cheat on her boyfriend who she cared dearly for. Thankfully, this was wrapped up in a few episodes. Willow ends up back with Oz, a total sweetheart and a member of a cool band, by the way! What about Cordelia and Xander? Well... They stay broken up. This gives Cordelia the starring role in the best episode of the series and opportunities to back rude comments to Xander from now on! So hey, it wasn't a total loss.

Overall, this is technically a stronger season than the previous. But my favorite in heart so far is Season 2. I will have to see how they both hold up in future rewatches! I would highly recommend watching this DVD set. It will definitely keep your mind running with many situations, characters, and interesting plots to analyze and enjoy!",1375920000,,5483,4.579429735234216

The addition of the little dashes of humor is really what this show needed to be awesome. With the delving into the characters and their relationships with one another, I wasn't able to skip episodes like before - every one of these episodes had something catching and intriguing about it.

Betrayal, murder, revenge, love, growth... There's so much here to talk about! Oh, and the season finale - just wonderful!

Buffy the Vampire Slayer is not your typical Vampire, Love Struck series, but has it the old fashioned way: have to be asked to come in, burn alive in sunlight, crosses, holy water, stake to the heart, etc. THIS is another reason why it is so great, because it isn't the glittery vampire crap everyone is into today.

The love relationship between Buffy and Angel is a bit weird (he's way too old for her, by a few hundred years) but I guess it's more about the slayer and vampire.

1787840,4,B00006RCNX,"In Season 3 of BtVS the scooby gang endures those significant high school milestones that we all remember so fondly; homecoming, prom, the SATs, graduation -- however on Buffy these precious milestones are presented with a supernatural, hellmouthy twist -- making them all the more intriguing and entertaining to watch.

We meet a new character this season, and perhaps one of my favorites in the Buffyverse, Faith -- the new slayer. What's most fascinating about Faith is the way the series portrays a slayer without friends, family, or any of the essentials that ground Buffy and give her a sense of morality and purpose. Faith is a perfect foil for Buffy because she possesses the same powers and skills that Buffy has, but channels them differently, more negatively, because of her damaged upbringing and complicated past. The two characters are alike, yet different. Their interactions and the relationship they form throughout the season is fascinating to watch.

What's also great about this season is the tremendous growth and development that each character undergoes. Every character questions their position within the group, and in life, at some point or another this season. Whether it be Willow resenting her good girl image in Doppelgangland or Xander accepting his role as the only scooby member without supernatural powers in The Zeppo. Gilles realizing that he is more than just a watcher to Buffy and accepting his role as her father figure in Helpless. Perhaps the most prominent development is that which Buffy, herself,  endures all season long; resisting, and eventually accepting, her responsibility and role as the slayer -- a development that begins in the season premiere, Anne. The characters undergo a multitude of identity crisis and questioning this season; forcing them to grow and develop as young adults. It's one of the many aspects of Season 3 that's so great.

The only reason I don't give this season a perfect 5 star rating is because there are a few duds/filler episodes that I don't particularly care for (Gingerbread, Beauty and the Beasts). However, this is still a great season. One of the show's best. A step above the first two seasons because the characters are better developed, and better than the later, and sometimes awkward, college/grown up seasons.

What's a girl to do when her entire world comes crashing down around her ears, and she feels she is the cause? Leave Sunnydale, of course. So when season three kicks off, Buffy is struggling to deny who she is, as she attempts to make it all on her own. And for a girl who's still in high school, I admit she wasn't doing too shabby. But you can't deny who or what you are, and Buffy's gift is needed right in the town she has escaped to. Realizing that she needs to, and wants to, go back where she belongs, Buffy heads home to the relief of everyone who loves her. And so the Sunnydale Vampire Slayer continues to solve crisis after crisis with the help of her friends, her mom, her watcher, her love (that's right, Angel's back!), and another new slayer.

Every episode is filled with new witty banter, demon-slayage, and heartfelt moments if not hysterical laughter. Joss Whedon has a gift of ensuring that serious moments do not last long, there is always something to perk you up and laugh at just around the corner.

I am currently on disc five of six, and am ecstatically awaiting to finish the series (if only there were more hours in the day!). Fans who adored season one and two of Buffy will not be disappointed with season three. It is completely worth the addition to the collection, and Amazon had it arrive speedily and wrapped so that it was unharmed, so that I might view it as soon as possible.",1289433600,,1725,4.337461300309598
1787888,5,B00006RCNX,"Season 3 of BUFFY is regarded as one of the series' finest seasons, and no arguments here. Each season of BUFFY showcased several standout episodes; Season 3 offers up four of my personal favorites. In ""Band Candy"" contaminated chocolate bars regress their consumers into increasingly dangerous juvenile behavior, but the main treat is that we get to see Giles reverted to his teenaged bad boy ""Ripper"" days. ""The Wish"" features vengeance demon Anyanka granting Cordelia's wish that Buffy had never moved to Sunnydale. In ""Doppelgangland"" Willow's evil undead counterpart is accidentally magicked into Sunnydale. ""The Zeppo"" finds Xander ex-communicated from the Scooby gang for being too frail. But while the rest of the Scoobies hold off the Apocalypse yet again, Xander fights for redemption, except that no one knows. But, hold up, these episodes are only four reasons why Season 3 is so nails.

With a grieving Buffy having scampered from Sunnydale, the Scoobies try to hold the fort and perform the heavy monster slaying, except that they none of them are the anointed Slayer (their success rate falls somewhere in the six out of ten vampire kill attempts). But it's not long before Buffy makes her return; it takes longer for her friends to forgive her. This is as good a time as any to mention the wonderfulness of Joss Whedon (I know, this is news, right?). Joss is genius with using the fantasy horror genre and the high school milieu as metaphors for life and, specifically, life as a teenager. It's no coincidence that lots of folks equate the show's downfall with the Scoobies graduating from high school. Oh, look, no more shiny, resonating high school metaphor. I'm not one of those, by the way, who think the last few seasons were train wrecks. I love Seasons 6 & 7 (one word: Spike!).

Into each generation, a Slayer is born. Except that, in this instance, this generation lands three Slayers. Buffy Anne Summers, Kendra Young - who died in Season 2 - and now Faith. Faith, the irresponsible, sensual Slayer, is a dark reflection of Buffy, what Buffy could've been if she'd been rudderless and had made the wrong choices. The marvelous Eliza Dushku makes a dynamic first impression and the sexual subtext really explodes.

We also see the return of Angel and the brood factor elevates even more. A good guy vamp again, Angel spends the first half of the season pretty much recovering from his stint in hell and just practicing tai chi and whatnot. And if you thought the Scoobies struggled to forgive Buffy for abandoning them... well, there are definite trust issues now when it comes to Angel. By the end of this season, Angel walks away into the shadows, into his own television series. Man, just how doomed is Buffy's love life? Another key character would debut in this season, Wesley Wyndam-Price, the stuffy priggish Watcher who'd later join Angel in Los Angeles.

The season's featured Big Bad turns out to be the Mayor of Sunnydale. Actor Harry Groener does a wonderful thing. He invests a layer of complexity into his role. Evil doesn't always wear a monster's face. Mayor Richard Wilkins is a bit homespunny, a bit fastidious, a bit Andy Griffithy... and so of course he must've sold his soul. Mayor Wilkins also harbors a genuinely fatherly demeanor towards Faith, takes her under his wing, seems to really care for her. Compared to future Big Bads, Mayor Wilkins' evil goal is uncomplicated. He just wants to turn into an enormous honking snake demon. His lackey, the colorful vampire Mr. Trick (with just that hint of a lisp), is also pretty memorable.

More highlight moments: Buffy and Cordelia vie for the Homecoming Queen crown; the Scoobies, seniors now, prep for the SATs (although Xander thinks it ""discriminates against the uninformed""); on her 18th birthday, Buffy must undergo the Slayer's rite of passage under the cold eyes of the Watchers Council; if you think having telepathy is a good thing, just take a peep at ""Earshot""; and, in a truly awesome touching moment, the final few minutes of the episode ""The Prom"" has the Sunnydale High students, during the senior prom, recognizing Buffy and designating her as Class Protector. If you've been following this show as long as I have, that last one may make you well up.

Characters that feel real, stories that affect you in your gut. Strangely, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is more of a teen drama, feels more real and resonates more than shows like Dawson's Creek ever did. It's not just a coming-of-age story. It just doesn't cover themes of desolation and alienation and other things that teens go thru everyday. Joss Whedon also drops in the heady overarching themes of taking responsibility and the assumption of power. And, of course, there's all that pop culture humor and cool demon-slaying. Que viva Buffy!

BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER - THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON has six DVDs and the following bonus material: Audio Commentary on ""Helpless"" ""Bad Girls,"" ""Consequences,"" and ""Earshot""; Original Scripts for ""Faith, Hope & Trick,"" ""Band Candy,"" ""Lover's Walk,"" and ""The Wish""; ""Buffy Speak"" explores the show's fun use of dialogue and pop culture references (00:06:28 minutes long); a Season 3 overview (00:21:28); a Joss Whedon interview on Disc 4 in which he talks about the episodes ""Bad Girls"" & ""Consequences"" (00:05:44); a Joss Whedon interview on Disc 5 as he waxes all talky about ""Enemies"" and ""Earshot"" (00:05:58); one last interview with Joss Whedon on Disc 6 as he blabs about the two-part ""Graduation Day"" episode (00:04:16); an interview with Monster Maker John Vulich (00:04:50); three more featurettes focusing on the show's ""Wardrobe"" (00:07:05), ""Weapons"" (00:05:22), and ""Special Effects"" (00:13:25); and a stills gallery.",1285459200,2,5737,4.982254697286012
1787889,4,B00006RCNX,"I know many consider this season to be one of the best, if not THE best.  I don't fully agree, because for some reason I prefer Season 2 over this one.  I'm not quite sure why - oh, who am I kidding, I have a pretty good idea.  Although the second season had more than a few duds among the episodes, I loved the introduction of Spike (James Marsters) and Drusilla (Juliet Landau), Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Angel (David Boreanaz) consummating their relationship, only to have the gypsy curse that was bestowed on him turn him evil and back to the malevolent Angeleus.  Angel on the dark side was refreshing after the mushiness of their slayer/vampire forbidden romance.  The conclusion of Season 2 had Buffy killing Angel after his soul had been restored in order to stop the opening of hell.  Unable to deal with the heartbreak of killing her lover, Buffy fled Sunnydale and began working as a waitress in LA going by her middle name.  She tries to ignore her calling but finds herself drawn to helping Lily (Julia Lee, who appeared in Season 2 episode ""Lie To Me"" and in future episodes of ""Angel""), and she again saves others from evil and it makes her realize it's time to head home.  Unfortunately, her running away left her mother, Watcher and friends feeling betrayed, hurt and excluded.  Buffy must deal with this, along with the fact that she was expelled from Sunnydale High and must work hard to prove herself upon her re-admittance.

The slayer also attempts to have a ""normal life"" once again with dating a regular guy, Scott Hope (Fab Filippo) but somehow, Angel returns to the earthly plane after being tortured in hell and his soul has been restored, leading to more angst and conflict for all concerned.

I think my main problems with this season were that the Buffy/Angel romance began to feel really redundant and seemed to have lost the spark that it had in the first two seasons, and Spike only appears in one episode, despite being featured on one of the discs.  I got that Buffy and Angel are doomed and can never be mostly because of the fact that they cannot become intimate again or else his evil, souless side will be unleashed again. But it seemed like Whedon and company were hitting us over the head with it.  It was getting so tired that I was relieved when Boreanaz spun off to his own series, ""Angel"". I really think Spike should have figured more in this season, but, I shouldn't complain since he becomes such a vital part of the Scooby Gang later on.

Now I'm going to gush. I LOVE Spike, and ""Lover's Walk"" was probably one of the best episodes of the season.  At this point, he's a vicious vampire with a vulnerable side, especially when it comes to love and needing a mom (both of which is foreshadowing the future, as Marsters becomes a series regular starting with the fourth season), and a sense of humor to boot. Also, his speech to Buffy and Angel on how they can never just be friends will love each other until it kills them both (not to mention his barbs at Angel for being ""all soul having again"") could really be yet another forerunner of what was to come later between him and Buffy.

The series costume designer, Cynthia Bergstrom, admitted that the wardrobe choice for Buffy this season was a bit, well, questionable. Some of the coats and jackets she sported, not to mention the out of character purses and handbags, didn't come off well onscreen.

More on the positive side, some of the best villains make the rounds, the Mayor of Sunnydale (Harry Groener), black vampire Trick (K. Todd Freeman), psycho former watcher Gwendolyn Post (Serena Scott-Thomas), fellow slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku), who starts off as a friend but gets too easily drawn to darkness, and the introduction of the First, the powerful evil that will be fought in the seventh and final season. The First has the ability to take on the appearance of dead people (in the episode, ""Amends"", Angel is tortured by the the people he killed, including teacher Jenny Calendar (Robia LaMorte) a former gypsy whose people put the curse on Angel, and Giles's (Anthony Steward Head) ill-fated love interest in seasons 1 and 2).  Giles' friend turned foe Ethan Rayne (Robin Sachs) also makes an appearance. Oh, and we get to see Buffy's old nemesis, the Master (Mark Metcalf) in ""The Wish"". ""Band Candy"" is probably among the most humorous episodes (although humor pretty much always plays a part in every installment), it was a hoot to see all the adults (including Principal Snyder, portrayed by Armin Shimerman) act like teenagers, or more specifically, the teenagers of their era (Giles was so great - and hot! - as a 60s type dude who made me think of the ""kitchen sink"" British dramas of the period). I also enjoyed a look back at Angel's history (and also Spike's later) which began in Season 2 and would continue throughout both shows.

The other scoobies, too, have their great moments. Some have said that Xander (Nicholas Brendon) was a jerk at times in this season and I agree, but I think it gave Brendon a chance to show more range, and I think he could have played darker a bit more often (like in season 1 episode ""The Pack"" and this season's ""The Wish""). He's still priceless as a goofy, geeky guy, and kind of sweet, but I like seeing him with an edge.  He and Willow (Alyson Hannigan), who is also dabbling in Wicca (discovering the powers that will make her even stronger), discover their attraction for one another after years of friendship, but it's ill-fated when their love significant others, snobby but perky Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) and werewolf/musician Oz (the adorable Seth Green) discover Xander and Willow a liplock.  Carpenter too, shows more versatility in her scenes in the hospital after she's impaled in ""Lover's Walk"" - just like Gellar and Hannigan, she can break your heart.  It was a good choice to have Cordy join Angel in LA, and I think the character of vengeance demon Anya (Emma Caulfield) was clearly being set up as a replacement for Cordelia (for the comic relief, as well as a love interest for Xander).  Willow's vamp alter ego is also a revelation, and I think it was a great choice to let Hannigan play that in two episodes, ""The Wish"" and ""Doppelgangland"" (and vamp Willow is yet another foreshadowing device for things to come).  New Watcher Wesley Wyndam-Price (Alexis Denisof, who also spun off to ""Angel"") catches Cordy's eye for a while after she breaks up with Xander leading to more humorous and touching interludes.  Faith's attraction to darkness comes across like gang-busters too and her relationship with the Mayor is like the father and daughter of hell, in an interesting way.

Buffy's mom Joyce (Kristine Sutherland) is also fun to watch, with the exception of her massive overprotectiveness of Buffy, which grates on one's nerves after while.  In ""Band Candy"", ""Lover's Walk"" and ""Gingerbread"" she gives her own brand of humor. Another anvil that is dropped is the mention of ""little sis"" by Faith, which will figure at the end of season 4.

I have to say something about episode 18, ""Earshot"" (which features recurring character Jonathan, played by Danny Strong), since it was yanked by the WB because of the Columbine Massacre. I guess the network felt it was necessary to air it later due to the tragedy that occurred, but I don't think it would have been an outrage had it aired right then. Buffy is able to hear people's thoughts, and in doing so, she stops Jonathan's plan to carry out a school shooting. If anything, that was positive rather than negative, and empowering in a way.

Once again, in the last few episodes, were are told by people, including the mayor no less, how Buffy and Angel's romance can go nowhere.  Clearly setting up Angel breaking up with Buffy and moving to LA, I got the message more than once, heck, pretty much all season long. I almost wanted a clean break so Buffy could move on already. I did like Willow and Oz finding their way back to each other and becoming intimate, the opposite of Xander and Cordy's relationship, which was pretty much dead from when she saw him kissing Willow.  As I said, Anya becomes Xander's love interest not long after. Although Xander did finally lose his virginity to Faith in ""The Zeppo"". Speaking of Faith, Buffy does manage to defeat her, but it's hardly a triumphant moment, in fact, it's quite sad because we know that Faith hasn't had an easy life and lost her way. Fortunately, Faith makes guest appearances in both ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"" in the future and is clearly an important part of Buffyverse.

This season ends with a two-parter, ""Graduation Day"" the Mayor's Ascension, leaving our herione, the scoobies and Angel (who was poisoned by Faith, which can only be cured by the Slayer's blood), fighting against the evil (and vampires of course) and Angel leaving as Buffy watches (he had called it quits with her in the previous episode, ""The Prom""). Bangel fans got some angsty, heartbreaking and somewhat erotic romantic scenes when Buffy gets Angel do feed on her blood in order for him to survive. Oh, and we get to see Sunnydale High destroyed (remember how you used to bemoan the fact that you had to go to school?).

I do believe that out of the whole series season 3 had the most balance between series and fluff episodes, From faith, to the hiliarious Mayor Wilkins..to all of the commotion with the scoobies. and not to mention the chemistry between the actors was just enjoyable to watch.

Pros:
*I liked the drama between the two slayers. how they showed how faith was raised differently and she had different ideals of what a slayer meant and buffy had her own ideas about it. and how they tried to be friends but everything got messed up.
*I loved the mayor, he is seriously one of my favorite btvs villains and he gave so much humor to season 3 and I loved the relationship between him and faith.

Cons:
*the only thing I didn't like about three was the relationship between buffy and angel. they irritated me. but I was never a fan of the couple and in three they whined and complained too much for me.

Oh and lets not forget our first intro to Anya, Xander's soon to be love demon no longer a demon love interest. The entire town is turned upside down thanks to Cordelia, in what is to me one of the top three episodes of all time ""The Wish."" when she makes her desires known to Anyanka. If you havent' see it, wow--perfect television. Other episodes to watch ""Band Candy"" which will continue to have hilarious reprecusions and come up as an in joke for the next few seasons regarding Giles and Buffy's mom, ""Faith, Hope, and Trick,"" which showcases Faith for the first time in a wicked intro for a tv series, and of course, the saga of the mayor of Sunnydale. To me it is still one of the all time best story lines on the show hands down. Terrifically acted, and played by all the characters with ease, if you were not hooked by season three you are not human!!!! Great great television. No one does it better then Joss Whedon and his crack writing staff.

Willow realizes only too late she's really working for the wrong side, stops before Anyanka's power-amulet is revalidated, but still summons a parallel Willow from a black dimension where she's a master vampire, who now makes her grand entry in Drusilla-style at the Bronze, co-existing with gentle Willow. The gang has no time to mourn 'the best of us', who urgently must join in again with Angel, while the new official Watcher, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce from England, proves of little use, to survive and get rid of the dark 'alien' version, while both go undercover as the other...

1787944,4,B00006RCNX,"This third season of Buffy was great, it picked up right where season 2 left off.  Buffy is now living in LA, in a depression after being forced to kill Angel at the end of the last season.  Back in Sunny dale, her friends are trying to fill the void left by her absence, hunting the vampires on their own.  The very first episode, ""Anne"", is one of my favorite episodes in the series, and also my favorite season premiere.  I mean, the season just opened with a bang.  Somehow, that whole slave thing underground reminded me of ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.""  Anyway, Buffy eventually returns to Sunnydale after remembering her calling.  At first, her mom and her friends seem happy to have her back, but with time, Buffy realizes that they are all very angry with her for leaving the way she did.

Now I just want to say something here that I haven't said in my earlier reviews of this series.  I hate Buffy's mom.  She's such a control freak.  I mean, in the first two seasons, it was understandable for her to be so overbearing.  She didn't know that Buffy was the slayer.  She thought Buffy was just immature.  Now that she knows, she's going to be more understanding, right?  Well, no.  She, along with Willow and Xander, are very angry at Buffy for leaving Sunnydale.  Um, WHAT!?  Buffy just killed the man she loved, she sacrificed him to save the world!  And let's not forget the fact that she lost just about everything else, too.  She was, at the time, wanted for murder, expelled from school, and kicked out of her house by her mother.  You know, the same one who's angry at her for leaving.  So Buffy left for a few months to be alone for a while.  Only someone as strong as Buffy could have had all that happen to her and not gone insane or committed suicide.  And her friends are mad at her for putting them through...what?  I would have expected this from her mom, but her friends?  I don't know.  This whole thing seemed kinda contrived to me.

 So Buffy makes up with her mom and her friends.  The next episode, ""Faith, Hope, and Trick"", introduced Faith, a character that many people love and/or love to hate.  She's a new slayer, the one who was called after Kendra's death.  Faith is the polar opposite of Buffy.  Not a lot is said about her childhood, but we get the impression that she came from a very disfunctional family.  Her watcher has been killed, and a very dangerous vampire named Kakistos is after her.  Her and Buffy are able to kill Kakistos, and they start to become friends.  However, Faith's dark side starts to take over her, and she ends up allying herself with the Mayor of Sunnydale, who wants to take over the world by turning into a pure demon.  I love the character of Faith, and I love what they do to her in future seasons of Buffy and Angel.

 Angel is somehow brought back from Hell.  How?  We don't really know.  It's hinted at that the First brought him back, but we never really find out for sure.  That's kind of annoying.  Angel and Buffy try to stay apart, but find it too hard to not be involved with each other.  At the end of the season, Angel decides to leave Sunnydale and seek out his own spin-off show in LA.  I think this was a wise move on the part of the writers, since Angel didn't really have all that much to do in this season.  And his show was awesome.

There were a few things I didn't like about this season.  First of all, the relationship between Cordelia and Xander ends when he cheats on her with Willow.  And then Cordelia goes back to being a snotty brat like she was in season one.  That kind of disarmed what they did to her in season two, starting to make her into a nicer person.  Secondly, Principal Snyder.  At the end of season 2, when he expells Buffy from school, they make it seem like he's working for the mayor.  He knows that they are on a hellmouth, and it's hinted at that he knows Buffy is the slayer.  However, in this season, it seems that he does not know anything about the mayor's plans.  Thirdly, this season introduced the character Anya.  I loathed this character.  I will have more to say about her in upcoming reviews.  There are a few instances here and there where you can see small mistakes the writers made.  They are not huge, but you can see that this was leading to the crap we had to watch in seasons 4, 5, and 7.

 Even with my minor complaints, this season is very good.  There are excellent comedic episodes, such as ""Homecoming"", ""Band Candy"", ""Lover's Walk"", and ""The Zeppo"".  There are also dark episodes, such as ""The Wish"", ""Amends"", ""Bad Girls"" and ""Helpless.""  There are also some stupid episodes, like ""Dead Man's Party"" and ""Gingerbread"".  The season finale, ""Graduation Day"", was excellent.  My friends and I actually did something like that at our high school graduation.  Only we used guns.  Lots of guns.  Overall, this season was very well-done, and a good followup to season two.  I didn't like it as much as season 2, but it was still very entertaining.",1255651200,,4993,4.40989010989011

Another great season, check it out sometime!",1225929600,,424,4.821917808219178
1787953,5,B00006RCNX,"The third season of Buffy was the best yet.  The season-long story arc concerning the Mayor of Sunnydale's preparation for his ascension to full demon-hood was full of twists and turns and benefitted enormously from Harry Groener's exquisite performance, which combined the pseudo-innocence of a 50s sitcom character with the ruthless ambition of a modern Faust.  The rocky relationship of Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Angel (David Boreanaz) was developed further and brought to a touching conclusion.  New characters that would figure importantly in the future were introduced: rival slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku), erstwhile Watcher Wesley (Alexis Denisof), and vengeance demon Anya (Emma Caulfield).  The regulars of the Scooby Gang--Willow (Allison Hannigan), Xander (Nicholas Brendan), Oz (Scott Green), and the Watcher Giles (Anthony Stewart Head)--took turns in the spotlight as their characters underwent important changes as well.  With so much going on and all of it so well conceived, there is scarcely a dull moment in this exceptionally strong season.

Standout episodes include ""The Zeppo"" (Xander, suffering an inferiority complex, has his own stand-alone adventure while the writers have fun lampooning a typical Buffy-saves-the-world scenario), ""The Prom"" (despite the lame hellhounds, this touching episode handles teen love and angst better than John Hughes ever did), and ""Graduation Day, Parts 1 & 2"" (a suitably cataclysmic and emotional end for a great season).",1224374400,,1486,5.671171171171171

I loved the storyline about the mayor trying to become a powerful force to take over Sunnydale.
My favorite episodes were ""Slayerfest '98"", where Cordilia (which this is her last season in Buffy) and Buffy get trapped in a deadly game for survial on prom night.
The one with the mask at the art gallery that brings people back from the dead was one of the best episodes of the series.

1787971,5,B00006RCNX,"Although Buffy The Vampire Slayer Season 3 is not as great season as the second one was, it still is one of the best TV shows ever.  The second season was such a marevelous season that it was going to be hard to beat.  While the third season doesn't beat the second in terms of story arcs, it does beat it on the amazing stand-alone episodes.

Buffy Summers ran off to Los Angeles at the end of last season leaving her friends and family with a sense of betrayal.  She is a waitress in the season premeire episode ""Anne"".  After an encounter with someone she met in the second season, she decides to move back to Sunnydale.  The second episode, ""Dead Man's Party"", is mostly about the reactions of everyone she loves to her return.  The third episode,""Faith, Hope, and Trick"", sets off two important season arcs: the arrival of Faith, The Vampire Slayer and Angel's return from the demon dimension.

These arcs spin off into unexpected directions, and both are relativly over by the end of the season.  Some standout arc episodes include ""Enemies"", where ""Angelus"" returns and ""Consequences"", where Faith's story takes a turn for the worst.

The Stand-alone episodes were the best of the season.  ""Band Candy"" and ""Lover's Walk"" are excellent episodes that are completly funny.  ""The Wish"" and its sequel ""Dopplegangland"" introduce the infamous Dark Willow, with Alyson Hannigan putting in the perfromance of the season.  ""Earshot"" is an intriguing episode where Buffy starts to read minds after an encounter with a demon and hears a student planning to kill the students in the school.

1787973,2,B00006RCNX,"This season was okay, but kind of a let down after season 2. To me the characters were the problem and so was the fact that I was asking myself who cares. Xander was a jerk throught the whole season, Willow really needed to get over the fact that she was dating a wearwolf, and Giles forgave Angel WAY to fast. Another disappointment was Faith! Okay, I wanted to kill her everytime I saw her. Also Eliza can't act and I don't understand why everyone loved her. I also don't understandy why Buffy kept trying to save Faith. Angel is pretty much crabby during the whole season, then again I would be crabby to if my lover sent me to hell for a couple 100 years so we can forgive him for that. The Wesley chracter was a completely pointless, we already had a stuffy english watcher...did we really need two? All I have to say for the first half, is thank god for Spike because he saved the first half of the season. oh yes, lets not forget the almighty ascension. That was the WORST CGI effects i've seen and this big battle that they have been plugging since the end of season 2 lasted a grand total of 15 mins.

This season holds a special place in my heart as one of the best ever for the show - it features a strong main plot of the gang trying to stop the mayor's ""ascension"", the resolution of Buffy & Angel's relationship and the introduction of a new slayer, Faith (the excellent Eliza Dushku).

This series truly had something for every viewer: action, suspense, love stories, friendship storylines, fight scenes & the supernatural angle in addition to witty & intelligent dialogue.

This season features the arrival of the ""good-slayer-gone-bad"" Faith, 10,000 year old demon Anya and Buffy's new watcher Wesley Windam Price.

Season Three is of course excellent, as is the rest of the show, especially since this season features the other Slayer, Faith, one of my favorite characters. Established, mainstream relationships on TV shows in particular tend to bore me, but the continuation of the Angel/Buffy plotline in this season is, thanks to the genius of Joss, the writers, and the actors, painfully accurate to life, and exquisite. All other relationships, romantic and not (like Buffy and Giles, Oz and Willow, even the evil Mayor and Faith), reach the same level, which is a great feat on a show that's supposedly just about vampires and demons. The episode ""The Wish"" is in S3, too, which is the now-infamous alternate universe established by the writers-- it's, in my opinion, one of the best episodes in all of Buffy.

The special effects this season are a little silly, as they're still somewhat low-budget this early on, but the acting more than makes up for it. It's brilliant, and I'd more than recommend it.",1178928000,,1222,4.786729857819905
1787992,5,B00006RCNX,"Buffy's third season is the first season of the show to be consistently good - the worst episode (""Gingerbread""), is perfectly decent.  The show's core writing staff have joined by this point, so there's no need to rely on the mediocre writers of the first two years.

Season 3 is also the only season of the show that starts dark and becomes lighter.  The first third of the season does a fantastic job of exploring the emotional effects of season 2's devastating finale, which distinguished Buffy from most series which would have been eager to get into the regular flow of things.  Because the character's situation has actually become better by the end of the year (Angel comes back, and the Scoobies' friendships heal), the finale lacks the power of ""Becoming, Part Two"" and ""The Gift,"" and it's not as unconventional and interesting as ""Restless,"" which is unfortunate because this season is arguably the show's best.

The central villains of season 3 are Faith and the Mayor, who are to father-daughter relationships what Spike and Drusilla were to husbands-and-wives.  These two characters genuinely care for each other and are extremely likable because of it.  Eliza Dushku and Harry Groener's performances are magnificent, but their connection to the Scoobies is less powerful than Angel's in season 2.  Many have pointed out that they serve as a dark parallel to Buffy and Giles, but that's simply not as troubling as when the hero's lover killed the charming Jenny Calendar.

Season 3 was the beginning of a trend in Buffy seasons for the plot episodes to be good, but not the best the show had to offer (the only exception is season five's finale ""The Gift"").  The best episodes here are Lover's Walk, The Zeppo, and Doppelgangland, humorous episodes that were enormously important to the characters of Spike, Xander, and Willow.

Season 3 and 5 are the only two seasons of the show with no bad episodes, and season 3's Faith and the Mayor are certainly better villains than 5's Glory.  There are two reasons season 3 is only my second favorite, however: Angel and Oz.  Angel returns in season 3, but it's obvious he cannot be Buffy's lover after the events of last season.  As he is neither the villain nor the romantic lead this season, it feels like he is simply being used to advertise next year's ""Angel"" spin-off.

Oz, on the other hand, is a great character who SHOULD have been fun here.  This is the season he is in the most episodes of.  Unfortunately, he fades into the background for most of the season.  None of these episodes focus on him, the way season 2's ""Phases"" and season 4's ""Wild at Heart"" do.

Season 3 isn't a great season for every character like 5, but it still contains fantastic episodes, particularly for Xander, Cordelia and Willow.",1178064000,,2776,4.781970649895178

1788021,5,B00006RCNX,"It always warms the cuckles of me non-beating heart to watch Buffy's Third Season. I've always thought the 56 episodes which have our heroes based out of Sunnydale High School were the best this great series produced, because amidst all the humor and horror and high drama the show's writers always managed to pack in the everyday details of life at 17: the painful (and usually unsuccessful) quest for popularity and acceptance; the awkwardness of being almost-but-not-quite-grown up; the struggle to define your identity; the feeling that the system is stacked against you now and e'er shall be; and the love-triangles that inevitably stick a pointy end in somebody's ticker. The truth is always the best fiction, and while your high school may not have had vampires prowling the hallways, five will get ya ten it had Cordelia.

What distinguished Buffy from most other TV shows was its consistency. During these early years nearly every episode is an A and even the very occasional clunker usually has enough shiny moments to get a wink and a nod. In Season Three, only one outing really rang false for me - the forced and desultory ""Dead Man's Party"" - and even that its moments.

Of course no discussion of S 3 would be possible without talking about its twin heavies, Faith and Mayor Richard Wilkins III. As the unstable and vicious renegade Slayer, Eliza Dushku brings the kind of scene-stealing negative chemistry which the show's best story arcs always thrived on. Harry Groener, on the other hand, gave a brilliant and hilarious performance as a sort of evil Ned Flanders, whimsically gollying and aw-shucksing his way to demonhood. These two had a fine chemistry and an almost touching father-daughter dynamic which mirrored that of Buffy and Giles.

The best of the best:

""Homecoming"" - Feeling like she's failed to make her mark at Sunnydale High, Buffy challenges Cordelia for the tiara unaware that a posse of mercenary killers is planning to make trophies of her and the newly-arrived Faith. Charisma Carpenter, whose character had softened somewhat while dating Xander, dusts off her hilariously cruel A-game bitchiness in response, and Xander and Willow finally, finally lock lips in a beautifully written and acted scene that caps two years of subtly increasing tension. This episode has the funniest ending since the ""Oedipus"" bit at the end of S 1's ""The Puppet Show.""

""Band Candy"" - Writers use the term ""Maguffin"" to describe a plot device which furthers the story. In this case the Maguffin is possessed cocco-riffic chocolate bars which make adults revert back to their adolescence. The scenes between the dippy gum-chewing Joyce and a cigarette-smoking, Cockney-speaking Giles are absolutely hilarious. Armin Shimmerman is also great playing Snyder as the kid everybody loved to ditch.

""Lover's Walk"" - James Marsters was in only one episode of this season, yet managed to wreak two seasons worth of havoc. By the time Spike leaves town, drunkenly bellowing out the lyrics to the Clash's rendition of Sinatra's ""My Way"", the relationship of every couple on the show is in ruins. This show has superb writing even by BtVS standards: Spike's cruelty, his drunken self pity and his surprisingly brilliant observations about love are all first class.

""The Wish"" - This is a fantastic episode which, thanks to Cordelia, has our heroes living in an alternate universe where Buffy never came to Sunnydale and the Master reigns supreme. Mark Metcalf always played this character with a kind of whimsical genius and he's on the top of his game as the playfully evil supreme vampire. Nicky Brendon and Allyson Hannigan are scene-stealing as leather-clad vampire versions of their regular-world selves. Also the first appearance of Emma Caulfield's Anya.

""Amends"" - The ghosts of Angelus' past victims, including Robia LaMorte's Jenny Calendar, show up to torment him on Christmas Eve, but all is not as it appears. I loved the showdown scenes between David Boreanaz and Anthony Head and also the tearjerker between Boreanaz and Sarah Gellar on the bluffs outside of town. Most Christmas episodes descend into schmaltz, but this one avoids that fate. Also marks the first appearance of, well, the First Evil, which returns as the Big Bad in Season Seven.

""The Zeppo"" - Xander is probably my favorite character in the B-verse, and this clever episode, which intertwines real and red-herring plots, reminded me of why. Struggling to be taken seriously by his super-empowered friends, we follow Xander through ""one of those days"" that could only happen in Sunnydale.

""Doppelgangland"" - A sort of sequel to ""The Wish"" has the alternate-universe Willow show up in Sunnydale to wreak havoc and make her alter-ego very, very uncomfortable. Great work by Allyson Hannigan as the God-isn't-it-great-to-be-evil sexually depraved vamp.

I also thought ""Anne"", ""Helpless"", ""Earshot"" and ""The Prom"" were very fine pieces of work, but really the season has too many great moments to list. The additions of Caulfield and Alexis Denisoff as Wesley Wyndam-Price were icing on a very big cake. So leave it to Oz to come up with the perfect epitaph for the first three seasons: ""Guys, take a moment to deal with this. We survived.""

Buffy: ""It was a hell of a battle.""

Oz: ""Not the battle. High school.""",1150243200,,5307,5.044520547945205
1788022,5,B00006RCNX,"Season 3 is right up there with season 2 as one of the most brilliant seasons in this show's 7-year run. Love her or hate her, the addition of Faith, the second Slayer was a smart move on the part of the show's producers as she created quite an upheavel in Buffy's life and caused the audience to see how truly unselfish and heroic Buffy was in comparison. Faith was like the dark side of Buffy, what she could become if she chose to abandon her responsibilities and take the easy way out. This season also gave us one of the show's all-time best villians, the Mayor, a truly evil man who did truly evil things, all while posing as the town's wholesome Mayor and extolling the virtues of cleanliness and a healthy glass of milk. The icky father-daughter relationship he and Faith eventually developed was very twisted and fun to watch. Some of the most beloved episodes are featured in season 3, including ""Lover's Walk"" (Spike returns), ""Amends"" (the only Buffy X-mas episode), Doppelgangland (the vampire Willow episode), ""Earshot"", ""The Prom"", and the season-ender ""Graduation Day"". There are also some fun, very enjoyable episodes that include ""Homecoming"" and ""Band Candy"" and a couple of episodes that the show wouldn't have been complete without, ""Helpless"" (in which Buffy temporarily loses all of her powers) and ""The Wish"" (in which we see what Sunnydale would've been like had Buffy never arrived there).",1149724800,,1415,4.875518672199171
1788023,5,B00006RCNX,"*SPOILERS WITHIN*

The second season of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER was a tought act to follow: it was very likely one of the best seasons of television in history.  That said, BUFFY's third season was nearly as good.  By Season Three, the show had abandoned its ""Monster of the Week"" formula and replaced it with season-long story arcs.  During this season, Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and her friends (in their senior year at Sunnydale High School) had to deal with a variety of problems, primarily the arrival of a second slayer in Sunnydale: Faith (Eliza Dushku).  They also had to deal with the apocalyptic plans of Sunnydale's mayor, Richard Wilkins III (Harry Groener), and the release of Angel (David Boreanaz) from a hell dimension.

The third season of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER was one of the show's finest years, ranking just behind Seasons Two and Five in my book.  It was David Boreanaz's and Charisma Carpenter's final years on the show before they moved to ANGEL.  It was also during this year that the show received the most media attention; Entertainment Weekly went so far as to name BUFFY the ""Best Show of the Year"".

The acting on BUFFY has rarely been better than it was during Season Three.  Sarah Michelle Gellar is excellent, at times even better than she was during Season Two.  David Boreanaz's Angel is more gentle and reserved after his time in Hell, but Boreanaz is just as great as ever.  Particularly great are Buffy's friends: Willow (Alyson Hannigan), Xander (Nicholas Brendon), Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), Oz (Seth Green), and Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter).  Hannigan is adorable; she and Green (who is terrific, by the way) make a wonderful couple.  Brendon and Xander never were better than they were in this season.  Brendon is just great, and Xander is hilarious.  Carpenter's part is slightly smaller than it was in the previous seasons.  This was her final year on the show before she joined Boreanaz on the spin-off series ANGEL.  On that topic, this season introduced the character of Wesley Wyndham-Price (Alexis Denisof), the stuffy young Watcher who draws the attention of Cordelia.  This was Wesley's only season on this show before he joined Carpenter and Boreanaz mid-way through the first season of ANGEL.

The guest stars in this season are superb as well.  K. Todd Freeman is delightfully devious AND cool as the evil vampire Mr. Trick.  Eliza Dushku's Faith is a character whom we side against, but whom we pity as well.  The magnificent James Marsters returns for ""Lover's Walk"", a very fun episode in which a heartbroken Spike (Marsters) kidnaps Willow so she can put a love spell on Spike's love, Drusilla.  One can't speak of this season without mentioning Harry Groener.  Groener's performance as the mayor of Sunnydale is just fabulous.  The mayor, despite his evil intentions, is an appallingly-likable character, thanks to a cheery performance from Groener and some very funny work on the part of the writers.  Groener is truly outstanding.

This is a very balanced season, staying excellent from start to finish.  Some episodes are especially good.  One such episode is ""Band Candy"", a very enjoyable episode in which the population of Sunnydale - including Giles and Buffy's mother (Kristine Sutherland) - begin acting like immature teenagers after eating fundraising chocolate bars.  In this episode, Robin Sachs returns as Ethan Rayne.  Another great episode is the aforementioned ""Lover's Walk"", a fan favorite.  That episode is followed by two excellent episodes.  The first of these is ""The Wish"", one of the series' best episodes.  It introduced the character of Anya (Emma Caulfield), who later became a series regular.  An engraged Cordelia wishes that Buffy Summers had never come to Sunnydale; vengeance demon Anyanka grants her wish, transporting Cordelia to a hopelessly glum alternate reality where Sunnydale is overrun by vampires.  It's an excellent episode, the climax of which is extraodinary.  The second of these is ""Amends"" (written and directed by Joss Whedon), in which Angel's past comes back to haunt him; this episode was also the introduction of The First, the ultimate evil which was the ""Big Bad"" of Season Seven as well as the CHAOS BLEEDS video game.  In ""Helpless"", Buffy loses her slayer powers as part of a training ritual concocted by the Watchers' Council.  Fan favorite episode ""The Zeppo"" finds Xander in trouble over his head, while Buffy and friends battle a demon cult planning to re-open the Hellmouth.  ""Consequences"" is notable mainly for one of the most moving episodes in the entire series, when Faith - with Buffy as witness - accidentally kills a human being.  Joss Whedon's ""Dopplegangland"" is a fun episode which involves Willow's evil alternate reality twin from ""The Wish"".  ""Earshot"" is a powerful episode which caused a stir among fans when it was held from airing following a rash of school shootings.  ""The Prom"" is a wonderful (and sad) episode.  The two-part season finale, ""Graduation Day"", is excellent; ""Graduation Day, Part Two"" is one of the very best episodes of the series, culminating in an exciting Battle Royale at Sunnydale High.

Everything in BUFFY's third season was flawless.  The story arc was nowhere near as strong as that of Season Two, but it was great nonetheless.  Unlike Season Two, which had its share of less-than-great episodes, every episode of Season Three is top-notch; many even rank amongst the best of the series.  The acting is superb, Christophe Beck's score moving and emotional, the writing witty and powerful.  It's a perfect close to BUFFY's high school years.",1149033600,4,5619,5.0412147505422995
1788034,5,B00006RCNX,"This was my favorite season of Buffy, the cast was great, the addition of Wesley, Faith, and the Mayor and Oz in almost all the episodes was great.  This season had some of the most touching scenes, in Earshot when Angel has to kill the demon and feed Buffy its heart, in the Prom when her graduating class presents her with her award showing they did notice her sacrifices and  when Buffy is crying in Willows arms because Angel is leaving,Beauty and the Beast when Angel returns from hell and kills the monster Buffy it fighting then turns to her and hugs her and drops to his knees, in Helpless the touching moment when Angel tells her about the first time he saw her in LA and in Graduation Day when Angel is poisoned and has to feed on Buffy to recover, In Enemies when Willow was kidnapped and everyone is arguing and Oz knocks everything over to make his point

Then I had chills watching some of the truly evil parts of the season, When Buffy loses her powers and must save her mother, when Faith tries to take Angels soul, when it looks like it worked and he is going to kill Buffy, the mayor trying to kill Buffy in the hospital, when Buffy was on the phone with her mother and heard Spikes voice there, when Giles stabs the Mayor and he isn't hurt, when Buffy kills Balthazor and he says "" When he rises you will wish I killed you all""

Of course then are the funny parts, Band Candy was funny all the way through seeing all the adults acting like kids.

Lovers Walk  had so many funny parts with Spike drunk and babblin g, the mayor with his assistant asking if he could sell his soul for a better golf game, and the scene in Buffy's house where her mother is alone with Spike and they are drinking cocoa and he is whining about Drucilla leaving him and Angel shows up but can't get in the house.

Of course like every episode the fight scenes were just terrific especially Buffy and Faith fighting.  The Beauty and Beasts we finally see Oz in werewolf form fighting and there is a great scene in lovers walk where Buffy, Angel and Spike are all fighting on the same side and that was riveting too.

If you like the Buffy and Angel relationship than this is a great season even though he breaks it off and leaves.  I belive Angel is in every episode this season even though some are just dream sequences.  Buffy and Angel make it comfortable and believable that they are completely and happily in love without having a physical relationship.

I was suprised that in many episodes it looked like Buffy was in for it and I thought Angel would come and save her but he doesn't which i guess takes us back to season 2 when Angel is getting ready to kill her and she is alone and unarmed and he asks her what she has left and she says ""me""

I thought season 2 was scarier and season 4 was funnier but season 3 was the last year with this cast and it was scarey, funny, and heartbreaking.",1148947200,,2894,4.278388278388278
1788035,5,B00006RCNX,"Season Two of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER may have been as good as any in the history of television and he certainly set a standard that would be difficult for any show to match.  The miracle is that Season Three, while perhaps not quite as spectacular as Season Two, is awfully close.  BUFFY has more and more become for a host of TV critics the touchstone by which other shows are judged (in just the past month I've seen critics uses BUFFY to help assess just how well THE SOPRANOS, SIX FEET UNDER, and LOST did some of the same things it did-and BUFFY never suffered by comparison-if anything, BUFFY's critical reputation has continued to grow in the three years after its ending) and Season Three played an important role in providing for BUFFY's legacy.

Season Two ended with what might have been the most heartbreaking finale in the history of TV.  Buffy had had to send her lover Angel (who had been villainous until the last few seconds before his demise) to a hell dimension in order to save the world, she had had an epic argument with her mother who had just learned she was a vampire slayer, and she had left town to deal with her emotional trauma.  Season Three finds Buffy living in LA under an assumed name working as a waitress in a diner, the remaining Scoobies in Sunnydale trying to carry on her work.  This episode, ""Anne,"" is not often mentioned among the great episodes of BUFFY, but it is one that I have always loved and one that does so many things well.  We see Buffy renouncing her vocation as Slayer and embracing anonymity in the big city.  Things only begin to when she is confronted in the diner by a girl named Lily.  Lily is a wonderful illustration of how BUFFY and ANGEL expressed a belief in the capacity for people to change and become more than they are.  Though often tragic, the show contains a remarkably optimistic view about the capacity for human growth.  Lily is actually a girl named Joan who later changed her name to Chanterelle and became part of a would-be vampire cult.  It here where we met her in the Season Two episode ""Lie to Me,"" and was only prevented from becoming a vampire by Buffy's intervention.  When we meet her in Season Three she is just as confused and unfocused.  At the end of the episode she changes her name for the final time, asking Buffy if she can use her middle name, Anne, as her own.  A couple of seasons later on ANGEL, with no reference to her prior connections to BUFFY, Angel meets Anne in LA, running a homeless shelter for kids pretty much like what she was like.  Significantly, in the final episode of ANGEL, we see her again, just before Angel and his associates go up against demons in what could be there final battle together.  She is still helping kids at the shelter.  This kind of personal growth is seen in a number of characters on both BUFFY and ANGEL.

Buffy is asked by Lily to help her find out what happened to her boyfriend.  Throughout the episode she continues to deny both her name and her vocation, until she and Lily are captured by demons and taken to a vast factory in another dimension.  Demons ask one human worker after another, ""Who are you?"" killing whoever says anything other than ""I'm nobody.""  When the demon foreman comes to Buffy he repeats the question, to which she replies, ""I'm Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" both reclaiming her name and her destiny.  She then leads a bunch of the humans out of the factory back to their own world.  Buffy then decides to leave LA and return to Sunnydale.  Two further remarks on this episode.  The big fight that Buffy undertakes in freeing her fellow captors is one of the best in the run of the show and showcases stunt double Sophia Crawford at her best (Crawford was the stunt double for the first four seasons and one of the great stunt doubles in Hollywood-she gets almost all the stunt work calling for diminutive blondes, e.g. she has worked on VERONICA MARS as well).  One of my favorite moments is where Buffy, after wiping out a bunch of demons, stands with a hammer in one hand and sickle in the other, a worker taking on the forces of capitalism (Joss Whedon denies the image is intentional, but he is too good for this to be an accident).  That image, with Buffy looking about to see which demon she is going to take on next, was the closing image for the opening credits for the next three years.  The other great moment is when Buffy goes up to the chief demon Ken and asks him, ""Ken, want to see my impersonation of Gandhi?"" smashing his head with a mace, killing him.  Lily asks, perplexed, ""Gandhi?""  ""Well, yeah, if he was really pissed off.""

Buffy returns to Sunnydale and a new season, and a very full season it is.  The major event of the season is the arrival of a new Slayer, one who was activated by the death of Kendra at the end of Season Two.  Faith is a lower class beauty from Boston.  If she had been from the South she would have lived in a trailer park.  Her disruptive influence and eventual betrayal to join Season Three's ""Big Bad"", the Mayor, as well as the return of Angel from the hell dimension, dominates the season.  Of all the Big Bads on Buffy, only the Master of Season One was in any sense traditional.  The Mayor is a congenial, mildly prudish, somewhat corny demon worshipper with an obsession over germs and hygiene.  Except that he wants to use the powers of dark to become an immortal demon, he seems the epitome of a right-wing family values politician.  He becomes to Faith the father she never had, befriending her and fulfilling emotional needs that no one else seems willing or able to.  The fact that he really is very good for Faith in many ways is typical of the show.

Narratively Season Three is not as strong as Season Two, though the individual episodes are probably stronger as a whole.  So there is a bit of a paradox.  Season Two had a few weak episodes like ""Some Assembly Required,"" but Season Three really had no weak episodes, but Season Two was a stronger season.  The paradox is resolved by the fact that the dominant story arc of Season Two was stronger.  Several of the episodes were among the best in the run of the show.  I've mentioned ""Anne"" already, though it is usually not viewed as one of the season's best.  ""Faith, Hope, and Trick"" is rightfully celebrated.  It introduces a new potential love interest in Scott Hope, a new vampire in the techno-savvy Trick, and the arrival of Faith.  ""Band Candy"" is one of the great comic episodes on the show, as the candy sold by the band to raise money causes them to act like especially immature adolescents.  ""Lover's Walk"" sees the return of Spike to Sunnydale for a single episode (he will return permanently in Season Four) who is disgusted by the inability of Buffy and Angel to face up to their feelings for one another (""I may be love's bitch, but at least I'm man enough to admit it"").  ""The Wish"" is one of the great episodes of Buffy.  Cordelia, angered by Xander kissing Willow, blames Buffy for the situation and wishes to a new student Anya that Buffy had never came to Sunnydale.  It turns out that Anya is actually a vengeance demon who grants spurned women their wishes of revenge.  What we get is a sort of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE vision of Sunnydale without Buffy, the Master alive, Xander and Willow vampires, and Angel enslaved.  Giles is able to reverse things by destroying Anya's magical amulet.  Typically of the show, Anya, who was supposed to be a one-episode character, later became a permanent cast member.  ""Amends"" is one of my all time favorite episodes with a powerful scene where Buffy tries to talk Angel out of killing himself by waiting for sunrise on top of a hill, only being saved by a miraculous snowstorm which blocks all the sunlight.  ""The Zeppo"" is the best Xander-centered episode in the show's run.  ""Bad Girls"" and ""Consequences"" has Faith beginning her slide towards evil following her accidental staking and killing of a human she thought was a vampire.  ""Doppelgangland"" is a great episode where Anya convinces Willow to cast a spell with hopes of regaining her locket, but which merely results in Willow's vampire twin from the other dimension to appear (with the prophetic words spoken by Willow when she says that her twin is not only skanky but ""kinda gay"").  ""The Prom"" has the students of Sunnydale High unexpectedly given Buffy an award as Class Protector.  The season comes to an end with the exciting two-parter ""Graduation.""

Mention should be made of ""Earshot.""  This is a landmark episode for a couple of episodes.  In it Buffy gains the ability temporarily to hear the thoughts of others and hears someone planning to kill the students.  In a powerful scene she finds Jonathan with a rifle, thinking he plans on killing his fellow students.  In fact he intended to kill only himself.  Nonetheless, the episode was scheduled to run only a few days after the shootings at Columbine High School.  The WB decided to pull the show for US audiences.  Up to this point Internet downloading was a relatively undeveloped enterprise.  There were some sharing of MP3s but movies and TV shows were not widely shared.  But when the WB pulled the episode in the US, a huge demand for the episode was created.  Some Canadian fans of the show posted the episode on the Internet, and ""Earshot"" became the first widely distributed large file on the Internet.  Today more TV episodes are downloaded than any other kind of file off the Internet (partly because of conflicts between shows, partly to avoid watching commercials, partly to have files that people can burn, partly because many shows are distributed in widescreen high-definition format-many prefer seeing a DVD quality version of the latest episode of LOST, by far the most downloaded show in the Internet, than watch it on ABC in full screen, commercial-filled, low definition format).  After this, the sharing of TV episodes on the Internet exploded.  Thus, the shootings at Columbine High School had a unexpected consequence.

The season ended with the Scoobies graduating from high school, Giles without a job after being fired as her Watcher and the high school destroyed, and Angel and Cordelia off to LA and their own show.  Though the season wasn't a tiny bit less brilliant than the previous one, it nonetheless went along ways towards validating BUFFY as one of the most unexpected artistic accomplishments of its time.",1146873600,2,10412,4.60412147505423
1788036,5,B00006RCNX,"I really think season 3 is one of the best in the series. It's the most consistently solid, although it's got a few loser episodes. It doesn't reach the heights of the second or fifth season, but overall, it's really up there with them.

The Slayer's Senior Year isn't quite as operatic as in the second season, but it's interesting and has some seriousness in it. Buffy explores the dark side with the other slayer Faith, but also realizes the limits of her own power. She loses her Vampire lover for good, and there's the interesting quadrange with Xander-Cordelia-Oz-Willow effect. The Mayor is an awesome villain and he is a lot of fun, and the graduation day fights are awesome, both between Faith and Buffy and The Mayor and Sunnydale. Episodes that stand out: Doppelgangland, The Wish, Earshot. Not to be missed!",1146787200,,819,4.767605633802817
1788037,4,B00006RCNX,"The third season of ""Buffy: the vampire slayer"" is undoubtedly (or rather arguably!) the best season of the entire run of the series. Although the second season showed how the show had found its identity and style, and proved that good writing and atmosphere could do wonders for a show as long as it had heart, the third season of the show exceeded even these standards with its almost flawless list of episodes and sequencing of events. Here the characters grow even more, moral complications are pushed to the fore even moreso than the last season, and the action, suspense and production values are all pushed up a couple of notches (to say the least). Combine all that with some of the best writing in the entire series and you got an almost perfectionist TV achievement. From the thrilling and somber season opener ""Anne"", to the arrival of a new slayer in ""Hope, Faith and Trick"", to the introduction of The First (the omnipotent evil force that would later re-appear in the final season) in ""Amends"" to the haunting and rousing season finale ""Graduation day parts 1 and 2"", there are almost no bad episodes in this stellar season. Here Creator Joss Whedon and Co. free themselves from almost most conventions, expand the show's mythology, gloss the show with a more potent cinematic style and provide one long (but not long enough) foray into the potentials of episodic TV that succeeds on almost all levels. It succeeds as a horror show, as a drama, and even as an action show. This is the season that silenced critics of the show and brought new fans to it, while it was also the final season to feature the show in this incarnation (as the character of Angel left for his own spin-off in the next season along with the charecters of Cordellia and Wesley) and arguably the show didn't bounce back to the heights of this season ever again (except maybe for the final season). A must for fans of the two previous seasons and for fans of good, imaginative storytelling. *The DVD set has an improved picture than the previous two seasons since this was the first season of the show to be shot on 35mm film stock and it shows and as always the extras are numerous and mostly interesting snd entertaining*.",1143590400,,2210,4.64030612244898

Why she didn't get her own spin-off like Angel, i'll never understand. I guess the ""Buffy"" series needs her to stay interesting.  Sarah always looks like she phones her part in.  The others look like there reading telaprompters.  Except for Eliza Dushku she does a great job acting also. She brought a little more support for Hannigan.  So Hannigan fans and Dushku fans will really enjoy this seoson of Buffy.",1143244800,,574,4.69

The mayor, Harry Groener, and Xander, Nicholas Brendon, are fabulously funny in their roles as is Alexis Denison, who plays Buffy's new and hapless watcher. Greatest episodes are Band Candy, where the entire adult population of the town is transformed back into their teenage selves and Buffy's mom hooks up with - well read it and see; and The last six episodes which return Angel to his demon self, or seem to, and trace the mayor's steps towards his ascension to super-demon form.",1142380800,,627,4.814814814814815
1788040,5,B00006RCNX,"Rating a season of Buffy is difficult; even the less-brilliant episodes are, judged against the scale of most television series, brilliant. This season, however, is particularly good. It introduces the character of Faith, the ""Other"" slayer who embraces the ambiguities of slaying that Buffy has done her best to suppress-the sexiness of the violence, the extra-legal nature of their work, and the role of ethics and morality in drawing an often arbitrary line between good and evil.

This season in particular highlights the deliberate effort the creators put into maintaining continuity in the Buffyverse-the regular appearance of Jonathan in the background, references to The First and its Bringers, Faith being called into action after the death of Kendra in the previous season, and so on.

Yet this season also does a wonderful job of balancing the pathos of slaying with humor. Several episodes stand out as particularly clever-""Band Candy,"" ""Homecoming"" (which features SlayerFest '98), and ""Doppelgangland"" (which features the bizarro-world Vampire Willow). The cleverness of the writing itself also gets highlighted in one of the featurettes on this DVD collection.

Overall, this is a DVD set worth owning. Each episode is worthy of multiple viewings and offers new subtleties and joys each time!",1142208000,,1307,5.428571428571429

1788044,5,B00006RCNX,"The third season of Buffy is the last season in which Buffy and her friends are high schoolers. It would have been very hard to top the outstanding season two of the series, but this one comes close. The season starts out slow with individual episodes that are just not up to par with the ones from season two. In particular, I thought the season premiere, ""Anne"", in which Buffy is a runaway, was a disappointment as was ""Dead Man's Party"" and ""Band Candy"", where all of the adult residents of Sunnydale regain their teen personas.

However, the season story arc involving the second fallen slayer, ""Faith"", and the season villain, the mayor, are excellent. The mayor has the outward trappings of someone who you'd expect to be leading small-town America. He's a booster of the boy scouts, a big believer in nutrition and law and order, and also an immortal whose goal is to be transformed into pure demon form. Faith, the second slayer, becomes drawn to the dark side in general and to the mayor in particular after a series of unfortunate events that leave her feeling that Sunnydale is Buffy's town and that she will always be the outsider. She figures if she has the name, she might as well play the game of bad seed. The mayor becomes a kind of father figure and evil ""watcher"" for Faith after her own watcher, Wesley, tries to remedy matters but just makes matters worse. For those of you who are also ""Angel"" fans, it is interesting to watch the character of Wesley who is basically bufoonish comic relief in this season of Buffy, and to see him in ""Angel"" transform into a Indiana Jones type character of tremendous bravery as that series progresses.

One of the more interesting season mini-arcs involves Xander's romantic betrayal of Cordelia and the introduction of Anya, a vengeance demon who comes to Sunnydale to help Cordelia get her revenge via an extremely reckless wish that has interesting consequences to say the least. Another particularly interesting individual episode was written by Joss Whedon entitled ""Amends"" that takes place at Christmas. It is clearly meant to be episode zero of the ""Angel"" series that debuts the following year. In it we learn much about Angel's past, and on that level it is an outstanding episode. However, the spirit that is tormenting Angel during this episode, the First Evil, was a puzzling presence that just seemed to be a device to tell Angel's story. It is odd that the series would use the First Evil as the villain for the entirety of season seven when it didn't even make much sense for this one episode.

In summary, season three in its entirety is very satisfying, and the season villain, the Mayor, is one of the series most interesting. There are just a few individual episodes, particularly during the first half of the season that are just not that great especially when measured against the yardstick of season two of Buffy.",1131840000,,2894,4.738095238095238

You have to understand that in the mid 90s video quality still wasn't the best, however the  plot makes up for the graphics in the first season. People who have  made reviews less than 3 stars are usually people who are not part of the target market for this series.

Buffy was made for the teenage bracket.  Not ""everything"" is historically correct with the Vampire mythology however, unless you  are a vampire expert you will find this series very enjoyable. Yes there are scenes of action,lust,love,good vs. evil.  But these are all the things that teens have to face during they're growing years.

Which is why this series did sooooo well, because it was relatable, even though it was fictional.

From the beginning of the season when Buffy stopped running away and finally came back to Sunnydale, to Angel coming back from a hell dimension, then to the introduction of Faith's character (the bad slayer).

It was a great season to watch, one of the best Buffy seasons!

My favorite thing about this season is to watch the relationship between Buffy and Angel, during the third season they finally realize that no matter how much they love eachother they can't be together forever. It is so heartbreaking to watch how much they love eachother and that they can't be together.

My favorite part of the whole season is when Angel bites Buffy in the last episode (Graduation Part 2), it is the most erotic thing I've ever seen on tv.

Some of the best episodes in season 3 are The Wish, Amends, The Prom and Graduation Part 1 & 2.

I really consider this to be one of the best Buffy seasons ever, the second being the best! I would recommend this season to anyone, you will not regret buying it believe me!!!",1123200000,,1108,4.492537313432836

1788065,5,B00006RCNX,"Buffy the Vampire was able to establish itself as well written and genre-mixed show (Drama, Comedy, Action, Fantasy, etc.) during its sophmore season when the classic doomed romance relationship between Buffy and Angel was...well doomed. Angel loses his soul after making love to Buffy illustrating metaphorically how after you sleep with a guy, he becomes mean. For the entire second season, we had to endure Buffy's heart being torn out by an evil-turned Angel. Finally, in the shocking season finale, Buffy knows she must kill Angel in order to save the world. And she does, right after Willow managed to get the spell to work to re-ensoul him. It is absolutely heartbreaking to see that look in Buffy's eyes where she knows it's too late and that she must kill Angel. She tells him that she loves him, kisses him and then kills him. So then she skips town after confronting her mother by telling her she is a vampire slayer, a protector of the world. Let's just say...you don't just throw this at your mother and expect her to ""get it"".

In fact, I don't think a lot of people ""get"" Buffy. It's not some silly horror movie turned tv show. It's a real drama show with comeday and presented in one of the most artistic ways in television history: a metaphor. High School is hell. That is the metaphor from Season 1 to 3. Giant bug substitute teachers, zombie football players, witch cheerleaders and Hyena people on campus. The height of the metaphor is explored more in Season 3 when the seaosn ends with every high school students' dream: blowing up the school. Oh, and there's a giant snake involved as well.

Let's not forget the arrival of spunky and charismatic Faith played fantastically by Faith as the new slayer in town and the complete opposite of Buffy...or is she? She's basically everything Buffy would never let herself become (Joss Whedon's words, I believe). Faith is shortly lured to the dark side when she joins side with the city Mayor plotting to reach ascension to destroy the world starting with the high school. On Graduation Day. When Buffy and the gang find this out and decide to inform their fellow graduates, the senior class finds themselves in extraordinary solidarity to beat this thing. Plus, flaming arrows = cool.

The third season is about many things. Buffy deals with her grief for Angel and his return which she keeps to herself knowing her friends still hold valuable grudges against him. They both know their relationship could never be because one moment of happiness and it's back to evil fangs for Angel. It's also the last Season of Buffy Cordelia played by talented Charisma Carpenter who then moves on to the quasi-equally excited spin-off ""Angel"". Oh yeah, David Boreanaz leaves the show as well since Angel realizes being around Buffy is too difficult for both of them knowing what they can never have. And of course there is the sweet and partly innocent love quare between Willow, Oz, Xander and Cordelia after Willow and Xander develop lusty feelings for each other and start kissing whenever there hormones feel like giving them a little nudge.

All in all, Season 3 (closely followed by 5) is arguably the best Buffy season. Although many of the best episodes aren't featured in this season it proves overall to be one of the best damn 22 hours in television um...ever.",1118620800,3,3325,4.777391304347826

1788068,5,B00006RCNX,"The brainchild of writer Joss Whedon, Buffy The Vampire Slayer originally entered American pop culture as a full-length feature film, starring Kristy Swanson, in 1992. But creator Whedon felt that the project never quite did justice to the full scope of his vision, so he managed turn the film into a television series in 1997. The result of Whedon's increased artistic freedom is a series that has enjoyed both critical acclaim and audience notoriety. Nominated for 14 Emmy's during its seven year run, the show managed to win only two (both in 1998 for Outstanding Makeup and Outstanding Music Composition in a television series). Yet, the true success for Buffy The Vampire Slayer is indicated by the massive success of the show's long run, strong DVD sales, and the overwhelming success of the series spin-off Angel...

Sarah Michelle Gellar plays the title role of Buffy Anne Summers, a teenage girl who stands alone among her generation as the ""chosen one"" able to ""stand against vampires, demons, and the forces of darkness. She is the Slayer..."" But Buffy is not alone in fulfilling her destiny as a slayer of vampires. She also receives help from the high school librarian, Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), who is a Watcher - the one chosen to train and guide slayers on their developmental path. In addition, new friends Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan - of American Pie fame) and Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon) quickly uncover the truth of Buffy's destiny, and they often aid her in defending the world against evil forces...

The Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Season 3) DVD offers a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Anne"" in which Buffy moves to L.A. and becomes a waitress hoping to forget her old life as a vampire slayer, but when she runs into some old friends, they end up trapped in an alternate dimension ruled by demons. Meanwhile, Willow, Xander, and Oz are doing their best to fight off the vampires in Sunnydale, but without Buffy's powers, they experience only moderate success. When Buffy escapes the alternate dimension, she returns to Sunnydale... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Homecoming"" in which Cordelia and Buffy become rivals for the title of Homecoming Queen, and ""The Wish"" in which Cordelia wishes that Buffy had never moved to Sunnydale (when a demon grants the wish, Cordelia's world is turned upside-down)...

1788069,3,B00006RCNX,"Buffy is moving more and more towards maturity. there are some great episodes in this season such as Anne, revelation, amends, the wish etc. but Buffy is still ""growing"" there isn't much I can say about this season only that I don't see much deeper meanings other than you know the obivious: slayer duty or normal life? choices we make matters etc.

my big complain, like many others, is obiviously Angel. Although Buffy and Angel are really perfect for each other but alot of times Angel is a waste of time. I think the writers are trying to make Angel a part of the show but at the same time not to make Buffy look too dependent of the need of protection. Alot of times when Buffy is in danger and you expect Angel would show up and save her but he just almost never did. In season two Angel has almost the same waste-of-time-ness but because Angel turned evil and thus appeared our favorite villain Angelus who could complain? Angel in most of Buffy just doesn't seem very heroic. the only episode where Angel isn't a waste is Amends. I guess even the writers know that Angel just have to go, he is much better in his own show though. Like I said, what a waste of DB's good youth to be wasted on Buffy when he can start young in his own show.",1113609600,3,1245,4.297872340425532
1788070,5,B00006RCNX,"Perfect? Stellar? Classical?
In my opinion, all of them combined!!! Truly, I have never seen an amazing season like this one in any other TV show. All the episodes are great and many of the best ever are here: Homecoming, Revelations, Lover's Walk, The Wish, The Zeppo, Bad Girls, Consequences, Doppelgangland, Enemies, Earshot and Graduation Day 1&2. In this season we are introduced to Faith, the best character of the show in my opinion. Everytime she is on screen she rules it (she is like Irina Derevko on Alias or Darla on Angel).
It's a shame Buffy was never respected among the critics and never won any Emmys. This is the most innovative and complex show I've ever known.. there is nothing good like it on television, except for Angel and Alias!",1111017600,,754,4.71969696969697
1788071,5,B00006RCNX,"After season two, no one could guess where the show would go next.  They needn't have worried, because for the third season of ""BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER"", Buffy and the gang are back and better than ever.

The season begins with ""Anne"", which finds Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) in L.A. working as a waitress, heaving run away from home at the end of season two.  While the gang continues battling demons at home, Buffy grieves over the death of her beloved Angel (David Boreanaz), who unbeknownst to her was actually cured when she killed him.  In ""Dead Man's Party"" Buffy returns home to find that the closeness between her and her friends has dissipated over Buffy's leave.  The first very important episode in the season is ""Faith, Hope & Trick"", in which Eliza Dushku's character of Faith is introduced.  Faith is a hip vampire slayer who seems to enjoy her slaying a little too much - but everyone likes her.  Everyone except for Buffy, that is.

Throughout the rest of the season, Faith slowly moves to the dark side while Buffy tries to sort things out with her friends and Angel, who has been resurrected from hell for some unknown purpose.  The character of Mayor Wilkins is introduced, and he plays an important part in the season.  Fan favorite Spike (James Marsters) returns for a very enjoyable appearance in ""Lovers Walk"".

Season three of ""Buffy"" is very likely the best of the series.  It sports outstanding performances and intelligent storylines, making one great episode after another.  ""Buffy"" Season Three is absolutely unbelievable and entirely flawless.  If you have any doubts that ""Buffy"" is one of the best shows of all time, season three'll dust 'em.",1109635200,2,1678,4.842105263157895
1788072,5,B00006RCNX,"The third season of BTVS saw our protagonist survive her senior year, the introduction of a renegade slayer, and literal head-to-head combat with the Mayor in the fictional city of Sunnydale. This season (1998-1999) provided 22 episodes of mandatory viewing.

After Kendra's untimely death, a troubled replacement named Faith (Eliza Dushku) arrives in Sunnydale. Faith had not previously received the appropriate guidance which would be needed to carry out her own calling. Therefore, she quickly becomes enamored with her power...and makes a sneaky alliance with the Mayor.

Series creator Joss Whedon was still heavily involved in the writing and production of BTVS during this season, and the high quality clearly shows through on the scripts. Action/politics/pop are mixed in a highly successful prime-time combination.

Notably, ""Gingerbread"" is a thinly veiled attack of the American religious right, who ALSO couch their pleas for community mobilization against the unknown as being `child protection'. Under the guise of safeguarding innocents, the First Amendment and other constitutional protections become trampled---all by essentially good people who have been so brainwashed that they honestly are unable to recognize the grotesque monster which was prodding them to see `evil' everywhere else but directly in front of them.

Given Whedon's own previously-stated liberal and feminist leanings in interviews and publicity pieces, the message in this episode is deliberate and intentional.

Also worth mentioning is the season opener ""Anne"" which finds Buffy seeking refuge in a working class LA neighborhood after condemning Angel to hell. In a far cry from the sugar which was displayed in much later seasons when Buffy HAD to get money after her mom died, Buffy is working a very grueling job and getting an intensive education in the proverbial school of hard knocks. Even as a child of a divorced mother, she still led a fairly materialistic life in Sunnydale and perhaps did not realize how hard it was to make ends meet.

The episode `Earshot' had some controversy when it originally aired because of similarities to the Columbine High School shooting. This episode had a postponed airdate because it would have otherwise aired on the one-week anniversary of the shooting.

Character wise, the Buffy/Angel saga continues, although after the previous season's drama, feels more subdued and even morose (if possible). What passion does exist between the two is tempered with the continued assumption that Angel will inevitably have to distance himself from his slayer lest a repeat appearance of Angelus reoccur. Still, it's enjoyable because David Boreanaz has not yet abandoned the brooding 'secret informant' attitude which had ultimately made his ""Angel"" character popular enough for an equally successful spin-off.

""Graduation"" has the Scooby Gang and Sunnydale High student body go head to head with the mayor and all forces of evil in a climactic battle. Buffy saves the world, but she dies...or so we think. This episode was also postponed in some markets because of school violence sensitivity issues.

This season is also memorable because Ema Caufield (who would later become a regular) makes her first appearance as vengeance demon Anyanka  in ""The Wish"". Cordelia impusively wishes that Buffy Summers had never come to Sunnydale and Anyanka grants her wish. We then learn that Buffy's presence only is what keeps the demons from overrunning the town.

This season truly marks the end of an era--in consistently great BTVS script writing. In future seasons (with Whedon off on other projects) the script quality for this series will become a hit-or-miss venture.

Whether you are an old/new fan, somebody who is interested in studying witty pop culture, or some combination of the above, this BTVS season is required viewing. For die hard fans of the old BTVS and it's unique style of scripting, it is also sadly the last purchase-worthy season of BTVS DVD's on the market.",1108944000,3,4002,5.304897314375987
1788092,1,B00006RCNX,"Season 3 was awful!! Not only cause I hate the relationship between Buffy & Angel, but because it was poor. There was nothing good but Spike & Faith. The entry of Angel was a disaster. Alot of stupid ""eternal thoughts"" with worse than season 2's idiotic stupid thirst for love. I mean how stupid could a show get? How stupid could a storyline get? What a poor production. I mean didn't you see that obsession Angel had over Buffy? That was really bizzarre. You really wanna sleep together, then sleep together! Don't eat our brains. I recommend season 7 or 6 for buying. And I'm warning you don't buy this season!",1106784000,2,613,4.531531531531532
1788093,5,B00006RCNX,"Buffy's third season is thrilling and fun. It does not resonate, perhaps, quite as deeply as the season before it or others to come, but that is only due to the power of those other seasons, not for any fault of the third.

By the third season, you know and love the main cast of characters, and they come fully into their own, here. The overarching storyline involving the nefarious Mayor and the rival slayer, Faith, is a masterwork, but the third season really shines in its stand-alone stories. The Wish, Band Candy and, above all, The Zeppo are wonderful little treats in a season filled with fun and engaging episodes. There is nary a misstep in the season (well... perhaps Beauty and the Beasts or Dead Man's Party) and it will leave you hungry for more.",1106438400,,761,4.554744525547445

Graduation Day prt 1-2 was horrible though.  Yeah, it's a tv show, but the mayor looked so fake and lame.  He died with a whimper.  The ending is why I can't rate this better.",1104883200,,321,4.080645161290323
1788095,5,B00006RCNX,"I could go on and on about why people should own and watch the Buffy series over and over - great writing, acting, action, humor, a willingness to go outside the box on a regular basis, and a treatment of good and evil that is far deeper and more real than the standard good-guys fight bad-guys dish that hollywood serves up with regularity.  Let's just say that this is the best series that I have ever seen on TV.  Season 1 was just good.  By the end of season 2 it was great and stayed that way through season 5.  Seasons 6 & 7 got a bit dark for many people, but still broke new ground and took us to new and interesting places. I am in awe of the amount of creativity that poured into this show over the years. DVD is the perfect medium to experience this show, with no annoying interruptions and far, far more character development over a 22 episode season than is possible in any feature film.  This is the best entertainment there is.  Watch it.  Savor it.",1104624000,4,964,4.2349726775956285

1788097,5,B00006RCNX,"If the second season had the most spectacular highs in Buffy's seven years, the third had the distinction of being consistently the best.  Only two really weak episodes early in the season (""Dead Man's Party"" and ""Beauty and the Beasts"") really falter, and the bulk of season 3 is classic, beautiful television.

Season 3 had the last truly great villain Buffy would face: Mayor Richard Wilkins III.  The Mayor was a charming, charismatic figure, and his varied plots and henchmen kept the show much fresher than any of the big bads in later seasons.  And it also gave us one of the show's best recurring figures, in the form of the vampire slayer Faith.  Eliza Dushku made her sensuous, capable, and a believably dark counterpart to Buffy.

We keep up, of course, with our favorite Scoobies; in fact, this season is probably the most packed with classic characters.  We see the slow parting of the classic Buffy / Angel romance, as Sarah Michelle Gellar and David Boreanaz keep sparking up the screen even though, as these things go, their relationship is doomed.  The relationships between Willow (Alyson Hannigan) and Oz (Seth Green), and Xander (Nicholas Brendon) and Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) are all explored in new and interesting ways, particularly in the stellar episode ""Lovers' Walk.""  Anthony Stewart Head remains excellent as Giles, and is given a wonderful comic foil in Wesley (Alexis Denisof), who would go on to become the most fascinating character on the spinoff Angel.  The cast continues to grow interesting, which is quite a feat given the fairly large ensemble that had accrued.

If the character development is top-notch, it shares that prize with the episodes.  Season 3 is fairly heavy on the Mayor arc, but it remains in the background for a series of amazing stories:  ""Lovers' Walk"" with the ever-wonderful Spike (James Marsters), ""The Wish"" introducing future regular Anya (Emma Caulfield), ""Amends"" going deep into Angel's soul, ""The Zeppo"" making certain that Xander is cool once and for all, ""Doppelgangland"" featuring the wonderful Evil Vampire Willow from ""The Wish,"" and ""Earshot"" giving Buffy a wonderfully comic glimpse into the minds of those around her.  The balance maintained between all of these excellent stand-alones and the larger story with the Mayor's Ascension is a feat I'm not sure was ever repeated on any TV drama.

As I said above, both the Mayor and Faith are delights to watch; when this season is in its main arc, it remains entertaining and thrilling.  Faith's fall from grace, and the scope and ingenuity of the Mayor's plots, are both handled wonderfully.  The Mayor is the only villain in Buffy or Angel to ever give Angelus a run for his money.

Buffy the Vampire Slayer, in many ways, heralded a golden age in television drama. Its intellect, ingenuity, and excellence remain unsurpassed. The third season - Buffy's peak - is essential viewing for anyone who's even casually interested in this landmark show.",1101772800,7,2975,5.012195121951219

1788099,5,B00006RCNX,"I have become what I once mocked, as I am now a Buffy faithful. I have converted.

Season three, Buffy's senior year in high school, from beginning to end is simply one of the greatest single seasons of any show ever.

This is not hyperbole. The astonishing second season sets up this year in tone, in plot, in ways that only can be developed over time. Layer upon layer of character, depth of plot...the Buffy-verse gets more full and more detailed.

Things matter more now.

The overall arc of growing up is vividly depicted during all the standard high school ""senior year"" moments. ""Homecoming"", ""The Wish"", The Prom"" and the truly epic ending ""Graduation Day"".

The gang is getting ready to graduate. Buffy and Angel are heading inevitably towards dissolution. Willow's Wicca-ness expands. Cordelia returns to her self-centered-to-the-point-of-being-a-black-hole ways. Giles, well, remains Giles, yet is allowed to be more heroic and less of a fuddy-duddy with the arrival of a second watcher, Wesley. And then there's Faith. The second slayer who succumbs to the dark side, yet not in any cliche way, nor in any way you could have predicted at the season's outset. I couldn't take my eyes of Eliza Dushku. I loved hating her by the end of the year. And yes, as other reviewers have stated, the Buffy-Faith fight at the end of the season is awesome. Not merely technically, but emotionally. There's passion behind the conflict.

Again, the tragic romance of Buffy and Angel plays out to a point where Sarah Michelle Gellar's acting is simply unbelievable. Watch the scene where she crumbles in front of Willow. That's the single best teenage break-up scene in the history of television. Her anguish is palpable. Gellar shows us a range of talent we could have in no way expected.

It seemed as if every episode was either merely really really good, or flat-out, jaw-dropping, mouth-agape brilliant.

I can't emphasize this enough. This is great television.

There are a few highlights I cannot avoid talking about.

""Band Candy"", an episode where adults become teenagers, was funny enough, but it leads to the single funniest word of the entire (so far) series. Buffy utters it, in a subsequent episode. The word is, and it includes the question mark, ""Twice?""

She says it to her mother, and I had to pause the DVD I was laughing so dang hard.

That word comes from the later episode, ""Earshot"", one of the more emotionally involving and crisply written episodes. Having an eerie ""Columbine"" quality, it was originally scheduled to be broadcast mere days to weeks after the actual Columbine incident, despite being filmed months before.

The ending of that episode is so unexpected yet so perfectly satisfying, I felt like I was watching a master at their craft. These people put on a good show.

""The Prom"" had me, a 40 year old, married, father-of-one, trauma surgeon on the verge of tears. The episode is an emotional tidal wave, getting everything you remember about prom totally right. Again, the ending is totally unexpected, yet oh so satisfying, you'll rewind just that little part at the end just to savor it a little while longer. Without spoiling a thing, let's just say that one thing that should bother any rational viewer about the show (""Doesn't anybody else in Sunnydale see all the creepy stuff going on?"") is miraculously handled. It's an exquisite TV moment.

Then comes ""Graduation Day"", the deservedly lauded season finale. When one season slowly builds to a single event, and then the TV creators not only meet one's unreasonable expectations but surpasses them, you're seeing something that comes along far too rarely in ANY medium, let alone TV.

Joss Whedon and company know their audience. They respect them. The show never ""dumbs it down."" If anything, they ""smart it up.""

Buffy fans are legion, dedicated, fervent and passionate.

I know for I have now proudly joined their ranks.

1788101,5,B00006RCNX,"It's Buffy and the gang's senior year and they have a lot more to worry about than SAT scores. The most interesting dynamic this season was the relationship between Buffy and Faith. It was amazing to see Faith bringing out the dark side in Buffy. But when Faith goes too far (in the classic episode 'Bad Girls') and murders an innocent, we see Buffy isn't at all like Faith. The mayor was a great villian. Buffy's greatest villians were the ones that provided so much humor. (The Mayor, Spike, Andrew, Warren, and Jonathan)... The best episodes are 'The Prom', 'Earshot', 'Graduation Day P. 1 and 2', and 'Bad Girls'. No season ever outdid season 2, but there is so much here to prove why this was the best show on TV.",1095897600,,718,4.488549618320611
1788112,5,B00006RCNX,"This is my favorite season of them all. It was action packed, never dull, full of emotion, and my personal favorite villian of them all, the major.

1788113,5,B00006RCNX,"The introduction of the gorgeous Eliza Dushku would have been enough but BTVS doesn't stop there. The Mayor is possibly the best villian ever produced in TV history. He is opie as a sociopath.

The season does a great job of contrasting the paths of Buffy and Faith. It is a great reminder that Buffy is human and can fail from time to time. The angel return is kinda lame but they deal with it as best as can be expected. With Angel leaving at the end of the season you knew that he and Buffy were over and it was tiresome at times to the see the angst ridden scenes b/w them.

The greatness of Season 3 is in the scoobies, and the villians. Willow and Oz get fleshed out nicely and Xander gets new layers added to his personality. Of course after everyone had given up on Willow/Xander you knew that Joss would throw them together. It is a brief arc but entertaining and a nice jab at the viewers who clamored for it for 2 solid years.

As far as episodes go season 3 has very few miscues. Each episode seems to have a purpose and helps move along the story. The most conventional season in aspect of episode structure that the show ever produced IMHO.

It may be straightforward but Season 3 is a terrific season that is worthy of all praise it gets.",1093651200,,1253,4.2521008403361344
1788114,3,B00006RCNX,"I have to admit, alot of this season's episode was really boring and fraustrating. I mean, it's already bad enough that Buffy's mom and Principal Snyder being getting in the way by activating their "" adult authority"", but the evil mayor just have to step it. The most disappointing was the part where Angel came back from Hell, if the big ideal is that Angel/Buffy relationship couldn't last because of his vampiric condition. why did he make up with Buffy again and then at the end of the season suddenly realized that he should break up with Buffy. It's even weaker when it's the evil mayor who made Angel realized this. The whole Prom episode is just a really big waste of time because you could really watch it and say: "" BIG DUH"" throughout the whole season I expected B/A relationship would take a different turn rather than the same old season two and suddenly Angel and his big Duh step up and breaks up with Buffy. overall, this season is a big disappointment",1092960000,,968,4.537142857142857
1788115,5,B00006RCNX,"In Buffy season 3, the characters grew more conflicted and mature. The year started with a powerful episode, ""Anne"", in which Buffy regains her Slayer calling after losing hope in the catastrophic ending of season 2. (""Anne"" is the only Buffy episode which takes place almost entirely out of Sunnydale.)

 Almost every episode in this season is good - even if the evil threat is silly, as in the 2nd episode, ""Dead Man's Party"", there is enough going on with the characters to keep the viewer interested. Spike and Angel, both apparently dead in the 2nd season make their returns, and a new villain, Mayor Richard Wilkins is introduced. Wilkins is a hilarious display of the banality of evil: an ordinary, rather finicky and paternal guy, who is also a ruthless and murderous sorcerer. At one point, while chatting with a minion in his office, Wilkins is also practicing his putts on the carpet and says, ""I'd sell my soul for a good short game... Of course, it's way too late for that.""

 The most troubled character introduced in a season of angst is Faith, a Slayer whose flamboyance hides the deep scars of her past. Unable to control her jealousy and anger, Faith is ultimately brought over to the dark side by Mayor Wilkins.

 Although season 3 never quite reaches the heights of the best moments of season 2, it is still better overall.",1091577600,,1343,4.693617021276595
1788116,4,B00006RCNX,"The season finale of Buffy's sophomore season is probably one of the best episodes of the series: Buffy must kill Angel to prevent apocalypse, just as he regains his soul. And this is where season three begins. Angel comes back from a hell dimension and he and Buffy fight their feelings to prevent another I-lost-my-soul-and-now-I'm-evil relapse, Faith comes to town and eventually forms an evil alliance with the mayor, Angel leaves Sunnydale to star in his own series, and the Scooby gang graduates from high school. It's all great stuff. There are also some great stand-alone episodes, such as ""Earshot.""

 As the previous reviewer commented, ""Buffy"" is often viewed as a ridiculous show for the teenage set. Heaps of praise from television critics are met with derision and incomprehension. Many fail to understand that ""Buffy"" grapples with very real, human issues that we all face: love, loss, what one's place is in the world.

 The episodes warrant five stars, but the DVD does not. I was disappointed to discover that Anthony Stewart Head's ""Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" lead-in was not included before each episode. I also found the general quality of the opening DVD shots and extras to be lacking.",1090972800,,1221,5.02970297029703
1788117,5,B00006RCNX,"Let's update you...

 At the end of Season 2, Buffy squared off against Angel, while Willow and the gang tried to restore his soul. As it turns out, it worked, just before Buffy would sacrifice Angel to stop the apocalypse. Beforehand, Joyce would kick Buffy out of the house if she goes to out to slay that night. She ends up getting expelled when she checks on her friends at the library. Pretty turbulent end to a pretty turbulent year, and now it's back to the fall season again. But where's Buffy?

 What makes this season so great? We have everything here, while the 2nd season was more or less preoccupied with Buffy and Angel's up and down love affair. Buffy ends up in Los Angeles in the poor section working as a waitress, and the rest of the Scooby Gang (Oz, Xander, and Willow) are out attempting to assume the slayer duties in Buffy's steed. She decides to come back home, but finds that everyone's pretty distant and preoccupied with their own thing, to where she feels she can't belong. Furthermore, we have the emergence of another slayer (remember Kendra died in Season 2), and a new big bad vampire, not to mention the mysterious desires of Sunnydale's Mayor. Did I mention that Angel would return, but a bit different? Add that to the mix, and you have one exciting season, and that's just the main storyline arc for the season. Some of the best episodes here are the standalones, such as: Band Candy, The Wish, The Zeppo, Gingerbread, and Earshot.

 The Love Story:

 Buffy's pretty much left with nobody after she sacrifices Angel's life at the end of season 2. She has a small stint with one guy, Scott Hope, but that doesn't pan out due to her missing Angel, and her slayer duties. But then, Angel comes back into the picture, but things don't really turn out the way she wants. Willow continues her relationship with Oz, but that has its strain when Willow and Xander are caught kissing. They pretty much reconcile, and it makes them stronger than ever. Xander and Cordelia on the other hand is a different story. Again, being caught with Willow, Cordy turns her back, but Xander becomes sort of interested in new girl Anya. Funny what she turns out to be, and also begins to show that ""normal"" human to human love interests just don't seem to work on the Hellmouth. Finally, I have to include Faith. It's not so much of a love interest as it is a father type figure, and I won't tell you who it is, for those of you who haven't seen this season, but, as surprising as it is, these two really do care about each other as we find out later on, and Season 4 as well.

 Some people call Buffy corny, and stupid, and just some dumb teenage vampire show. Personally, I see that as a background story, as to me, it's about life, and love, and destiny. It's about growing up, and making decisions, realizing that you can't do everything by yourself, and whenever you do, it never turns out the way you need it, and you're left all alone. This season epitomizes this idea. The demons are great, the vampires are vicious, and the big bad is evil as ever, but the emotions and the pulling together of sides, and friendships are second-to-none here.

 But what will make you watch it? What are the best parts of the storyline?

 1. Buffy and Angel: To be or not to be.

 2. Faith: Friend or foe? See how she turns back and forth...

 3. Mr. Giles: Not just her watcher now...

 4. The Element of Trust and Dedication - the convoluted truth

 5. Willow and Oz: Is it real?

 6. Dark Willow

 7. Xander's personal struggles with himself and his pride.

 8. The maturity of Cordelia

 9. The Mayor: Most evil Big Bad? Up to you to decide

 10. Graduation Day

 These are the themes that will keep you watching intently until the end. If you haven't already, buy this season, even if you watched the show in order back in 1998. Watch it intently, and simply be amazed by how truly wonderful this season is.",1090886400,2,3915,4.4446002805049085
1788118,3,B00006RCNX,"I was a late-comer to the whole Buffy thing, as I was to the X-Files. I couldn't stomach the premise, even though friends said I'd like it. So I never saw it on broadcast, and checked it out only once the DVDs were released and I'd run out of Babylon 5 and X-Files and Futurama episodes and I realized how cheap the Season 1 DVDs were.

 And you know what, I loved Seasons 1 and 2. They were smart, funny, and engaging. The characters were sympathetic, the show looked good, and it didn't take itself too seriously, which worked pretty well. There were great episodes, stuff that while it could never challenge The X-Files at its peak for pure craftsmanship (not necessarily surprising, given the younger actors and team in general working on Buffy), was as good as Babylon 5 and better than Star Trek.

 Season 3 has some good stuff, but I think maybe the writers started to believe their own press clippings. Buffy worked when it was fun, but struggled when it gave the characters too much angst. We didn't fall for Willow and Xander and Buffy in Seasons 1 and 2 because they were troubled, but because they were carefree. Now we've got poor Buffy in her overly drawn-out doomed relationship with Angel, we've got Willow and Xander being jerked around all season for what seems like the purpose of just jerking them around, and we've got Faith who's presence and role in the show is always slightly inexplicable. It seems the show fell into the trap of trying to make the show a little more dramatic by just making the character's lives more difficult, without any rational reason for their changing attitudes. Look at Bad Girls - why the heck does Buffy lose it in this episode? It's so out of character for her. I guess the writers just wanted to show her being tempted by her power, but they never provided any rational reason for why she yielded to temptation at this point. So the episode seemed flat and contrived to me.

Anway. All this said, there were a number of quite good episodes in Season 3. I liked Homecoming, Doppleganged, The Wish, and Lover's Walk quite a bit. But somehow the balance of the show subtly shifted in Season 3, and to a formula that didn't quite work for me as well as previous seasons. The characters neither made as much sense nor were as sympathetic, the plots and writing were significantly less tight, the relationships lacked tension, the villians less interesting, and the overall arcs gave an impression of being meandering. While Buffy has always had some episode pacing issues, there are a few episodes here which are actually bad (Gingerbread), which hadn't been the case before.

If you liked Seasons 1 and 2, check out Season 3, but be aware that in my opinion, it's definitely not as good. Not weak enough to deter me from continuing to Season 4, and not so weak it didn't entertain me for much of it, but still, given the very high standards of the 1st and 2nd seasons, it's hard not to wish it had been a little better.",1090800000,4,2970,4.552434456928839
1788119,4,B00006RCNX,"Amazing show, amazing season. Of course it has flaws, but...
In third season, it's clear for everyone that the actors are totally comfortable playing their characters, everyone knows what to do, when to do it and how to do it. The level of confidence is rising and rising.
Of course it has flaws. You just can't produce 22 perfect episodes that will please everybody. The producers, writers and cast do the best they can in the short time and relatively small budget they have at their disposal.
One question, however, does not leave my mind: how can an actress (I'm talking about Sarah Mihcelle Gellar here) give such stupendous, gorgeous, solid, breathtaking, emotional performances episode after episode, season after season, no matter if the material that they give her is good or bad? She bears more than half of the credit for Buffy being the hit it was. She TOTALLY controls the show when she's on camera. I sincerely hope she has a marvellous and well suceeded movie career (away from Scooby-Doo movies, I mean...)
As for third season properly speaking, it has ups and lows. I particularly enjoy almost everything the show ever produced, but sometimes I did not. Faith, for example. She just not fit. Sh&eacute;s annoying. Of course it was a character created for us to hate, but not to ANNOY the viewer. Everytime she's on screen with her wooden dialogue, I simply wanted to go fast forward (but I didn't, of course!). I also agree with with a reviewer tha said that it would have been better if the Scooby-gang treated her like a basket case beyond help, instead of trying to save her. Anyway, Joss Whedon always suprise the audience doing the exact OPPOSITE of what we would expect (Example 1: Xander and Willow - their potential beautiful romance didn't last nothing, and it was never ""officalized"" - Example 2: Wesley and Cordelia flirting - the flirting lasts a lot of episodes and, when they finally kiss, there is no chemistry between them and the romance is over even before it starts.)
Also, we have someplot holes and weakness we must forget in order to remember that it's, after all, just a television show for entertainment. Even if the Ascension worked for the Mayor, what were his intentions? Sure, he would eat the entire school populace, but after that? The Army, police, Air Force, all of them would transform that giant worm in small pieces very briefly. No big threat indeed!",1090022400,,2403,4.778846153846154
1788120,5,B00006RCNX,"The growing trend up until this point was that Buffy the Vampire Slayer seemed to get better after each season. The first season was a great start to the show, the second season was amazing, and the third season somehow managed to become even better. Over the course of the rest of the show, there would be some fantastic seasons. But, season three has managed to remain the best season of the entire show.
The relationship between Buffy and Angel is brought to a whole new level in this season, because of the events that took place in season two. Season three also introduced a beautiful and renegade slayer named Faith(Eliza Dushku) whose love for killing would eventually cause her to become an excellent villan, as well as the evil mayor of Sunnydale ( Harry Groener)that would definately practice the age old metaphor of ""killing people with kindness"". The suspense for season three is intense, because there is a countdown throughout the season that comes to a head on Graduation Day in which the mayor wishes to ascend to a higher level of being to destroy the world. There were so many great episodes in season three, that it is hard to choose a favorite. There were so many in fact, that 20 out of the 22 episodes were fantastic. The overall direction of season three was fantastic, and each episode seemed to build off the last one. Among season three's best episodes are - ""The Wish"" ( my all time favorite episode), ""Dopplegangland"",""The Zeppo"",""Lover's Walk"", ""Band Candy"", ""Homecoming"", ""Lover's Walk"", ""Revelations"", ""Amends"", ""Earshot"", ""Prom"", and ""Graduation Day"" PTS.1&2.
Overall, this is a must for any fan of the show. This would be worth owning just for the season itself. However, the DVD set is fantastic as well. You get commentary on several episodes, as well as five featurettes, and more.
A solid 5 stars...",1088035200,,1836,4.8317460317460315
1788121,3,B00006RCNX,"Season 3 is a mixture of things that worked very well and things that didn't work at all for the series.
Some of the episodes that worked well included ""Homecoming,"" when Buffy goes up against Cordelia to win the Homecoming Queen election.  This episode worked so well because it went back to Buffy's roots and remembered that Buffy started out as a blonde-bimbo-valleygirl who would have been concerned with becoming Homecoming Queen.  I always thought that there would be much more tension between Buffy and Cordelia than was ever played up, so I was glad to see this episode recognize who Buffy used to be and have that hit head-on who she is now.  The introduction of Anya in ""The Wish"" is a breath of fresh air.  The episode is also interesting in and of itself because of the way it sets up a world without Buffy.  Xander and Willow as vampires are brilliant and really drive home the importance of the slayer.  Willow's first hint at her coming sexual exploration in ""Doppelgangland"" was just one of the highlights of that episode.  The idea of an evil verion of Willow - the sweetest of the sweet - it intriguing and interesting to watch.  Finally, ""Earshot"", the airdate of which was delayed due to the Columbine tragedy, is a great episode where Buffy has to deal with (what she thinks) is a new but real threat to highschoolers everywhere.  The idea that Buffy should also deal with non-supernatural threats is a great moment away from the vampires and demons.
These few great episodes, though, are surrounded by many sub-par efforts by the Buffy writers and directors.  Among the worst episodes are ""Gingerbread"" and ""The Zeppo"".  In ""Gingerbread"" Joyce tries to rally Sunnydale residents against the supernatural forces trying to take over the town.  The concept just doesn't work and the episode turns out flat and boring.  ""The Zeppo"" which tries to give Xander a chance to play the hero is so poorly written and just boring in general that I haven't even been able to watch it all the way through.  The Graduation episodes which highlight the Mayor's ascention are okay, but don't really affect the audience at all.  I'd rather see Buffy fight a single vampire in a well choreographed fight scene than hundreds of teens running around pretend-fighting a giant snake.  I think that Faith was also a thorn in the side of the show this season.  She just never really fit into the stories at all and didn't even really provide that great of a doppelganger for Buffy.  She was just more irritating than effective.
Overall, a mediocre season.",1086998400,5,2552,4.7482993197278915
1788142,5,B00006RCNX,"From its start in 1997, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" has been a pop culture phenominon that attracted a wide variety of audience-the people who loved soap operas, the horror buffs, the sci-fi people, the drama dwellers, and so much more. ""Buffy"" has so much to offer and so much to look foreward to each week. Weather its a character's changing or a spectacular looking monster, there's nothing quite like ""Buffy"". And if you thought that the greatness of the show was over after its awesome first two seasons, you couldn't expect season three. This is a great season for the show, and deals with Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and her friends after the events of season two all the way up to their graduation day. Season three is great because of its clever story, great cast, and intense special effects. This is Buffy's last year of High School, and she's graduating with a 'bang'.
First off, the all out story is magnificent. After the heartbreaking season finale of season two, Buffy is drawn out of hiding in LA and realizes that she cannot escape her 'destiny'. She when she arrives back home to her worried mother (Kristine Sutherland), he watcher Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), and her group of friends including Willow (Alyson Hannigan), Xander (Nicholas Brendan), Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), and Oz (Seth Green) only to discover that while she was gone the monsters were growing bigger and badder. And her personal grief over the loss of her true love Angel (David Boreanaz) gets even more confusing when he mysteriously reappears from a hell dimension, untrusting of the slayer. Even with that, the real surprises come from the new slayer in town, Faith (Eliza Dushku), who is just like Buffy- confused and lost. Faith and Angel adjust to Sunnydale, and soon enough Buffy and her gang realize that the Mayor (Harry Groener) is really and evil monster planning an apocalypse. Sure, there's no real connection to Buffy and her friends there, and this seems just like a normal baddie. But things get even worse when one of Buffy's own turn the sides and after a mistake they take the side of the Mayor, creating a very uncomfortable and threatening enemy to the slayer. The relationships keep on building, with Willow and Oz, Xander and Cordelia, Buffy and Angel, and... Giles and Joyce? Willow loves Oz, but is still attracted to Xander, and Xander has grown an attraction with Willow even though he is dating Cordelia. Soon, that leads to trouble and breakup. Buffy and Angel begin to realize that their relationship is doomed, and with the troublesome Faith in town, Buffy has competition for all of her men- best friend Xander and boyfriend Angel. For sure, this season has a good storyline that is not as great as season two, but it can surely hold its own.
Second, the cast is great still, and they are only getting better as the show goes on. Sarah Michelle Gellar makes Buffy a likable and lovable girl who is really just human, and her choices she realizes effect her whole life. Gellar can be confused, happy, sad, and scared, plus be convincing above it all. Alyson Hannigan and Nicholas Brendan play the friends who don't know how to act around Buffy, each other, or really anyone. Hannigan is a perfect match as a best friend for Gellar, and Brendan can always be the guy you love, or the guy you just want to kill. Anthony Stewart Head still acts as the grown supervisor to Buffy and her friends, but we also get to see the wild side of his character and have fun with it. Head can be a child or a stucky librarian. Seth Green and Charisma Carpernter both are just perfect for their roles, and are both so funny with their witty lines. Kristine Sutherland is the motherly type and very convincing. Harry Groener is a different type of villain that distinguishes him from the Master and Angelus because he is a typical guy with a very evil streak. The real season stealer is Eliza Dushku, with her unforgettable Faith character. Dushku proves that she can act, as a confused girl trying to fit into the world, even if it means murder. The cast is great, and Joss Wheadon once again leads a crew of magnificent writers, and with his imagination, you have a great show.
Lastly, the special effects of this season are amazing. For a television show, there sure are a lot of effects that really capture you and amaze you. The magic spells and flaoting objects are cool enough, but heads splitting open, giant snakes, really fat vampires, alternate dimensions, and of course the improved vampire dusting. On the DVD there is a whole featurette on the special effects of the show and how they are done, which is pretty interesting.
In conclusion, this is a great show that will make your jaw drop for sure. Whether its the clever story, great acting and writing, or the spectacular special effects, Season Three is a must for any true Buffy fan. Loaded with tons of extras, this box set is unbelievable.

1788143,5,B00006RCNX,"This was a good season, there were some great episodes, the introduction of the sultry bad girl slayer Faith(Kendra's replacement), and a great big bad the Mayor.  There weren't many stand out episodes but this season had a lot going for it.
Faith was a welcome addition to the scoobies.  We had always known that Buffy didn't want the burden of being a slayer, but Faith was the first idea of what would happen if a slayer were violent and vindictive.  She seemed like a savoir for Buffy at first, she could take over the job as slayer for Buffy.  She enjoyed slaying to the point that she felt hungry and ""aroused"" afterwards.  Her life wasn't an issue as it had always been spartan, so she adjusted to it because she felt it was what she did.
The Mayor is one of my favorite big bads. He was evil, but with a smiling face.  A man who believed in family values, civic duty, pure living, but worshipped otherwordly beings and was planning on ascending to become a true demon, a giant dinosaur like creature.  The dymnamic between him and Faith was precious in the latter parts of the season, but I don't want to give anything away to those who haven't seen it.
The other scoobies felt change as well and grew as people.  Xander and Willow both go through various relationship ups and downs.  Angel returns and the gang accepts that he is no longer angelus even though the memory of the pain he caused is still freash in their minds.
There were only a few bad elements of this season.  1.  They didn't really explore Faith's character enough.  She felt sometimes like a bit of a cliche, well acted, but still a bit cliche.  2.  there weren't many standout episodes, but it made up for it that the ones that did stand out were excellent.  3.  They had an intersting henchman, Mr Trick, that seemed to leave the show too quickly.
Highlights of the Season
Faith Hope and Trick:  The introduction of Faith, the rebel slayer.  They find that she is running from something, a very old vampire and his lacky Trick.
Band Candy:  Funny episode with the return of Giles's nemesis Ethan.  The group is coherced by the principal. to sell band candy for the school.  But the adults that buy it have strange reactions.  They start acting more and more immature and irresponsible.  It is some sort of ruse to keep the town distracted for a ritual by the mayor.
Revalations:  A new watcher, Gwendolyn Post, comes into town to take over Faith's training.  She is also looking for a strange gauntlet with magical powers to destroy it before it can be used by dark forces.  But the question is brought up, has angel really come back good, or does he have an ultimatum?
The Wish: Cordelia decides that all her problems stem from Buffy.  So she makes a wish, that Buffy never came to Sunnydale.  Unfortunately she makes it to a ""vengence"" demon in disguise, anyanka, that grants the wishes of scorned women.  This creates an alternate reality where the master was never stopped and rules sunnydale, Xander and Willow are vampire, Angel is a toy for the Master, and people in Sunnydale live in fear.
Gingerbread:  great, albiet a bit strange, episode.  While Buffy's mom is watching over her on patrol, she finds two dead children with a symbol of magic on them.  She becomes obsessed with them and destroying the occult mennace in Sunnydale, going as far as book burning and witch hunts.
Helpless:  An example of how cruel and dangerous the watcher counsel can be.
The Zeppo:  For all those who wondered what Xander's worth was in the group.  It shows what happens to him on a mission they decide is too dangerous for him to participate in, very funny episode, good ending.
Revalations:  A new watcher, Gwendolyn Post, comes into town to take over Faith's training.  She is also looking for a strange gauntlet with magical powers to destroy it before it can be used by dark forces.  But the question is brought up, has angel really come back good, or does he have an ultimatum?
Dopplegangland:  The return of the alternate vampire version of Willow.  For all those who liked seeing Willow in leather, here it is again.
Earshot:  This is a strange episode where Buffy is infected with the blood of a demon, and it gives her their telepathy.  But she can't control it, and starts loosing it from not being able to silence the thoughts of everyone she comes close to.
Graduation Day part 1:  Angel is poisoned by Faith on orders from the Mayor to keep him from meddling with the Ascension.  It needs the blood of a slayer to cure the poison, Buffy decides to use Faith's.
Gradutation Day Part 2:  The day of Ascension is at hand, the scoobies feel that they are facing their doom.  They don't know for certain what is going to happen and how they can face it.  But they band together with the graduating class to try and stop the Mayor, who is giving a speech at their graduation.",1086652800,2,4856,4.535097813578826
1788144,4,B00006RCNX,"Couples are central to BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER throughout its seven-year run, so how might one pair the seasons themselves?
  If Seasons One and Two of BUFFY are Origin Years-- establishing the show's mythos in Season One, then stretching and deepening them in year Two-- then Seasons Three and Four are definitely Years of Consolidation, playing with, clarifying and reorganizing the show's fictional universe and strengthening the bond between show and viewer before diving into the darker, riskier events of Seasons Five and Six (which we might call Years of Daring and Yearning).  (What about Season Seven, you ask? Well, let's just leave it standing alone in the corner, looking at its shoes and crying because no one wants to hang with it (and can you blame them?).
  ""Consolidation"" has a compromised tone to it, but that's not what I mean. Seasons Three and Four are excellent.  It's not a question of quality, which on Buffy was almost always high, but tone-- these are more playful seasons than those that precede and follow, and there's a wittiness to the way in which series creator/auteur Joss Whedon puts his characters through their paces. Season Three, in particular-- from ""Band Candy"" and ""Homecoming"" through  ""The Zeppo"" and the mayor's speech in ""Graduation Day""-- is full of humor.
  The brightness extends to the show's look-- Buffy switches from darker 16mm stock to 35mm, giving the show a brighter look. We see more of Sunnydale, here too--  coffee shops, town streets, and the glowing green sign of the Sunnydale cinema. Darkness doesn't disappear-- the show, particularly in the first half of the season, is forced to grapple with the events of the season that preceeded it-- but this is certainly Buffy's most optimistic season, and that optimism may account for its popularity with fans.  Season Three was the highest-rated of any Buffy year in the Nielsens, and this year and the next were the height of the show's media buzz.
  It speaks volumes about how Buffy juggles tones that I can write the above with absolute conviction and then turn around and tell you that the show grapples, in its first four episodes alone, with teen suicide, homelessness, broken families, the dark underbelly of fundamentalism, the return of a murderer, the arrival of a rival slayer, and a mayor who has cheerfully sold his soul to demonic forces.  To say nothing of such Buffy staples as the horror of high school, the mendacity of teenage cliques and the glorious pain of doomed love.
  So, ok, ""optimism"" and ""wit"" are relative terms.  There are moments in Season Three that are heartbreaking, times when characters must grapple with fear, loss, betrayal and disappointment.  The genius of Joss Whedon and his writers is that they give the fans exactly what they want...exactly when they *don't* want it.  Whedon is not a moralist (a type that almost always comes in for criticism and mockery on his shows), but his work does have an ethics to it-- there are consequences to actions, and every moment, good or bad, always contains an element of its opposite. Ambiguity reigns in the BuffyVerse, and Season Three, for all its humor, contains moments when even the most seemingly ""innocent"" of Buffy folk are held up for sympathetic scrutiny.
  Still, moreso than any other season, Season Three ultimately grants its characters a level of grace and closure unusual for this normally open-ended show.  Even the ""villains"" are more sympathetic than usual, and far more out in the open.  It normally takes the show several eps to establish what fans refer to as ""the big bad"" for the year, but here, in keeping with the lighter, open tone, it's established early on (by the third episode) that the season's uber-villain is the Mayor, a deceptively young-looking family man who was granted eternal life and great power by demonic forces.  The mayor is my favorite of all of the program's ""big bads,"" a testament both to the ability of the writers to throw curve-balls at their audience and to the great humor and geniality that Harry Groener brings to the role.  Whether he's expounding on the genius of the FAMILY CIRCUS  (""That PJ!"") or telling hard truths to Buffy and Angel, Groener always makes his villainy charming, almost incidental-- you *like* him, and he, like every one on the show, is granted moments of humanity and understanding rare in television characterizations (incidentally, it's been mentioned in interviews that the Mayor is based on series writer/producer (and later ANGEL co-creator) David Greenwalt, and once you know this, it is impossible to watch one of the many greenwalt interviews on the Buffy/Angel sets without laughing).
  I don't want to give away any plot twists, but I do want to make brief mention of: the arrival of Wesley-Windam Price, a character who will become more important in the program's spinoff, ANGEL;  the real-world arrival to the show of writer Jane Espenson, who will write more great Buffy eps over the remaining seasons than anyone aside from Joss Whedon; the wonderfully expanded role of Buffy's mom, played by the fabulous Kristine Sutherland, who has more good moments here than in any other year; the rough charm and deep passion Eliza Dushku brings to Faith, the rival vamp slayer; and the usual outstanding work of series regulars Sarah Michelle Gellar, Charisma Carpenter, David Boreanez, Seth Green, Nicholas Brendan, Alyson Hannigan, and the always amazing Anthony Stewart Head.
  The other way to divide the history of the show, of course, is between high school and post-high school seasons.  Season Three marks the dividing line between these two periods, and had the show ended here, it would have been logical and fulfilling, if also deeply disappointing.  The remaining seasons of Buffy find the characters shifting, growing, regressing, and hitting new depths (and the show, new heights). Challenges lay ahead, for both characters and fans, but that was good-- after all, no one wants to be happy *all* the time.",1086393600,,5997,4.988955823293173
1788145,5,B00006RCNX,"This season really added a hell of a lot more drama to the show.  Angel came back without anyone knowing except for Buffy.  The gang took a long time to finally accept Angel and forget the wrongdoings of Angelus in season 2.  The events with the mayor were incredibly hilarious and I loved how he was so fatherly to Faith.  It was so comical seeing those two work together.  You also see how Angel is coming to the realization that he and Buffy cannot have a future together because of the events in season one-Angel having one true moment of happiness and turning into evil angelus.  This season was amazing, especially the last few episodes, which made me cry hysterically.  The part in graduation day part 2, the moment when Angel walks into the fog away from Buffy and permanently out of the show was the saddest moment of the entire three seasons (well for me at least).  Personally I stopped watching Buffy after that because to me it all went to hell when Angel left.  Then Willow turned lesbian and the Oz romance was offically dead, and the arrival of Riley, I just couldn't stand it anymore so I natually switched to Angel, but came back when the Spike and Buffy romance began.

1788148,5,B00006RCNX,"It's hard for me to choose my favorite seasons of Buffy. I love them all but season three is special. It's second only to season five. Anyway,Buffy's Senior High School year may not have the powerful drama of season two but it makes up for it by being the most consistently good of the series. Almost every episode of season three is a standout. The weakest are still light years ahead of the weak ones from season two.(Ex:Compare Killed by Death from season two with Homecoming from season three).The Big Bad of season three is the Mayor of Sunnydale. He is a delight. He's one of the best Big Bads because he's very funny and because of his interaction with Faith. Faith the Vampire Slayer is another great new season three character that will make you happy Kendra died back in season two. Season three does a great job of solving season two's final cliffhanger but it pales compared to what happens after with Faith and everything. I admit to prefering season two's story arc but I still prefer season three because of its godly average episode quality. No other season of Buffy before or after is as consistently good as season three. Still prefer season five,though,because it's almost as consistent and because the story arc is the best for me along with season two. Anyway,season three rules.

1788151,5,B00006RCNX,"Season Three has been analyzed so much that declaring it is about 'change' is a hackneyed expression.  From Joss Whedon's cryptic comments in interviews onward to the most esoteric of critics, we all can honestly say that Season Three offers the viewer no sense of stability.  It is the year of character development, and few end the season as they began it.  Yet, on reflection, I can't think of any Buffy season that isn't about change.  And, equally as obvious, the vampire metaphor has transformation embedded within it.  So why is this season different from its predecessors?
Perhaps it is because each main character faces crises and rituals that refine them, making them faceted individuals rather than Slayerettes.  At the end of Season Three, all the main characters have become special in the eye of the viewer.  An in facing the horrific reality below the surface they have confirmed their reality as a team.  Goodbye Slayerettes, hello Scooby Gang.
Goodbye infatuation, hello love, as well.  Generally not as one would expect it either.  What develops between Angel and Buffy this season is quite different from Buffy's Season Two girlishness.  Now their roles are often reversed.  There is more genuine give and take.  For Willow and Xander, who officially come of age in Season Three, love becomes something else besides mooning over the unreachable.
Season Three really sets the standard for overall acting.  The start of the season lacks the peaks and valley of previous seasons, but the calm is illusory.  The truth is that everything is more intense, and the displays of actor's art are now to be expected.  I will carry the image of Willows tear's in the bathroom scene forever, and Faith's almost inescapable descent into evil as well.  We've come to count on the tensions of Buffy and Angel, but the endearing weirdness of Anya is a treat.  And then there is the Mayor, who makes sleaze a term of art - in a fatherly sort of way.
Well, you wouldn't be reading this review if you didn't already want to buy this set.  Not only is the price excellent, but there are countless little interviews and mini-programs on the aspects of Buffy.  Rather than bore you further with esoteric mutterings about Kantian absolutes, let me assure you that Season Three really was better than you remember it was and this is an opportunity to make sure that Buffy is forever yours.",1080518400,3,2383,4.837037037037037
1788162,5,B00006RCNX,"This season is awesome! All of the best characters are in it (except 2/3 of the the Trio), even though some leave early in the next. It has Angel instead of Spike (I don't like Spike, but that's just me), Faith, Oz, Cordelia, and the Mayor, the best villain the show has ever known (though the trio come in a close second). The Wish is an incredibly well-written and slightly disturbing episode, Band Candy is hilarious, Earshot is brilliant, the Zeppo is Xander greatness, Lover's Walk has funny drunk Spike, and Graduation Day is my all-time fave (well... okay, Once More With Feeling was rad too).",1079049600,2,600,4.669811320754717
1788163,5,B00006RCNX,"This season, along with season 2, seems to be cited by many of the reviewers on this sight as the bar of excellence by which the buffyverse should be measured-and I'm inclined to agree.
If season 2 showed the possibilities of an epic Buffy with a season-spanning story arc, a fairy tale romance turned nightmarish, villains you almost wanted to root for, and some awesome stories, Whedon upped the ante in the third season and pretty much pulled out all the stops.
By season three evil is no longer the rogue individual of Spike or Angelus, but has become institutionalized in the guise of Mayor Wilkens, easily one of the most disarming and captivating villains you will ever see.  You also see this in the episode ""Gingerbread"", where angry parents have taken over the crusade against evil, but to a horrible end purpose.
If season two was the season of love betrayed, then season three worked the theme of the regenerative magic of forgiveness.  There is a great episode, the It's A Good Life ""Amends"", which hammers this theme home through Buffy and Angel's poignant dialogue at the episode's climax.
Another unforgettable creation of Whedon's is the character of Faith, the supposedly darker side of Buffy, the slayer Buffy could become if she isn't on her guard.  Faith, depending on how you see her, is one of the most tragic figures in Sunnydale, or someone long overdue for a big-time come-uppance.  Her familial relationship with the mayor will queer your conceptions of how a villain should behave and act.  Also, she is not a hated character; right to the end as Buffy is beating the tar out of her, Faith is the object of pity, even though there is the feeling that she brought things down upon herself.
There are so many magic moments of this season:  Buffy's award at the end of The Prom episode, the snowy climax to Amends, Mayor Wilkens's speech to Angel and Buffy in ""Choices"", the back and forth scenes of the good/evil sides preparing for the final showdown in the two-parter ""Graduation"", Mr. Trick's non-chalant kiss-off to his boss at the end of ""Faith, Hope and Trick"", evil Willow, Giles's revelation of Faith's lunacy . . .
Never again would things gel this clearly in a season of Buffy.  There would never be another Mayor, a slick Trick, or a Principal Snyder to undermine everyone's mellow.  Season four, although having some sterling moments at times, would prove to be more irregular in its quality as Whedon began to split his creative energies between this and his new Angel series.  But what a ride, the third season!
DVD philes will find plenty to crow about; the special features contain many commentaries and interviews with cast and writers, as well as original scripts to some of the episodes and some extra features spotlighting makeup and weapons.",1078099200,2,2788,4.791666666666667

1788165,5,B00006RCNX,"It is a bit difficult to add more to the many glowing reviews that have been written about these DVDs, but I love this season of Buffy so much that I will try. Of course, it is preferable to watch the first two seasons prior to watching these. After all, after the first season, Buffy starts doing season-long story arcs, and there are some major plot points that were left hanging in the second season that are picked up here. For example, and spoilers lurk ahead, there are the past troubles of the relationships between Willow, Oz, Xander, and Cordelia; there is the fact that Angel was left in literal hell in season two after losing and then regaining his soul; and there is a lot of slayer backstory. This sets up the introduction of a new slayer, Faith, in this season, one of the best developments of the season, and one of the most interesting characters on the show. This is a very transitional season for Buffy. After this season, Willow's romantic relationships will change in a big way, Angel and Cordelia will head off to L.A. to do the Angel spinoff, the Scooby gang will graduate from high school, and Spike's relationship with the gang will begin a drastic change. Very important, but its transitional role should not take away from the merits of the season on its own. As mentioned, Faith is a very positive addition to the show, though after this season, her involvement will be sporadic and limited to a few appearances in seasons 4 and 7 with related crossovers on Angel. The big bad this season, the Mayor, is a very funny guy, and the development of his paternal relationship with Faith offers a lot of good plot twists. Additionally, a lot of important characters are added to the Buffyverse, including Anya, Vampire Willow, and new watcher, Wesley Wyndham-Pryce. Another very important point is that the filler episodes (those that aren't as crucial to the season-long arc) don't feel as much like filler. These episodes like ""Anne"" and ""Earshot"" are very important on their own and not nearly as painful as season 2's ""Go Fish"" or season 4's ""Beer Bad."" What more to say? An amazing season of an amazing show--give it a try!",1074816000,2,2150,4.660526315789474
1788166,5,B00006RCNX,"Not that the other seasons were not great, they were.  But season three simply was the best season.  It had perhaps the best storyline with the introduction of the rogue slayer Faith, new Watcher Wesley, and the evil Mayor.
This season had some of the all-time greatest Buffy episodes including:
""Faith, Hope and TricK"" that features the new slayer Faith for the first time>
""The Wish"" which introduces us to Anya and Cordelia makes a wish that Buffy never came to Sunnydale, resulting in a VERY differnt Sunnydale.
""Dopplegangerland"" in which the vampire Willow from ""The Wish"" gets summoned forth to present Sunnydale.
""Dead Man's Party"" Buffy returns home after running away at the end of season two and her welcome home party is crashed by ghouls.
""Amends""  Angel is haunted at Christmas by the ghosts of those he has killed.
And of course ""The Prom"" and Graduation Day parts 1 & 2 which culminate the season long storyline in the grand battle against the Mayor, Faith, and his legions.
Truly, there is not a bad episode in this entire season.  The Mayor would prove to be my favorite villian and Faith one of the series most popular characters.
Watching this season alone would give you a great idea about just how good this series is.
There are commentary tracks for 4 episodes to go along with 5 featurettes.  Great stuff!!!
My highest recommendation!",1073952000,,1358,4.786324786324786
1788167,5,B00006RCNX,"O.K, first off I have to say that I'm one of the biggest fans of ""Buffy the vampire slayer"", I've watched the show since the very first episode to the last one, so I was dying to get one of the 5 seasons available on DVD, at first I didn't know wich one I should choose, I mean I love ALL THE SEASONS, and if I had the chance I will buy all of them, but come on, $868 pesos ( like 85 bucks each one) it's too much, well that's the prize in Mxico if you wanna have one of the seasons... anyway, after several days I decided to buy third season, why? because it has one of the greatest episodes ever, and of course, the appearance of a new slayer called Faith, add to all this a great villain if you ask me: The mayor. By the way, it's cool to see Willow in her innocent days (you know... before the gay thing)
Basically is one of the greatest seasons of buffy, but my favorite episodes are: Faith, hope and trick; homecoming; the wish; Gingerbread; Bad girls; Consequences; Doppelgangland; Earshot; The prom and Graduation day part I,II.",1073606400,,1036,4.211055276381909
1788168,5,B00006RCNX,"The third season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is when the show really began to hit it's stride and became something really special.  The season opener ""Anne"" finds a runaway Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) returning to Sunnydale after killing her lover Angel (David Boreanaz), while later on he returns from hell to fulfill his destiny as we see his character become more fleshed out (this would be Boreanaz' last season on the show before he starred in his own series) and we learn more about his past.  We are also introduced to roguish slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku) who forms a bond with Buffy and the rest of the Scoobies (she also manages to seduce Xander as well) before she turns bad and begins to work for the evil Mayor of Sunnydale (Harry Groener).  This season was full of pivotal events, such as Xander (Nicholas Brendon) and Willow (Alyson Hannigan) confessing they're long time love for each other which ends in a kiss, and sends Xander's girlfriend Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) making a wish to vengeance demon Anya (Emma Caulfield, she would then become a recurring cast member) that Buffy had never come to Sunnydale on the episode ""The Wish"".  ""The Wish"" is possibly my favorite episode of the series in which we see an alternate reality where Buffy has never come to Sunnydale: the Master from Season 1 came to rule the town making just about everybody (Xander and Willow included) vampires while the few humans that are left (including Giles, Oz, and Larry) fight to survive.  Spike (James Marsters) returns as well with a hint of things to come, but the two part season finale entitled ""Graduation Day"" finds the gang graduating high school on the day the Mayor begins his ascension, with a bloody battle ensuing as well.  All in all, Buffy the Vampire Slayer's promise was finally realized in the third season, but the best was yet to come.",1071878400,3,1858,4.7725856697819315
1788169,4,B00006RCNX,"Season three picks up where Season 2 left off, with Buffy struggling as a waitress named 'Anne' until she realizes she must come home to the world she abandoned after losing Angel.  The main themes of this season are change, as the gang is preparing to graduate, relationships shift, and sides are flipped throughout.  The big bad this season?  Essentially the mayor of Sunnydale hatches a plot to make himself all powerful, but perhaps the real villan is the new second slayer (after Kendras death in season 2) Faith.  This season did raise some controversy, in terms of the finale and the episode ""Earshot"" where Buffy telepathically hears of someones plan to annhilate the students and she suspects its a gun-toting student.
There are a number of stand-out episodes this season, but the strong emotions from last season aren't in full form.  The best part of this season is the exciting shifts nad hints for the future, such as the episode Doppelgangland where Willow meets her vampire alter-ego who she declares is ""kinda [...]"". Other good episodes are ""Amends"" where Angels past comes to light, setting up his own show, ""Helpless"" and the way the slayer turns on the Watchers council, ""The PRom"" where you can't help but love the touching moments between Angel and Buffy as they practically say goodbye, andt he finale is pretty exciting for the average.
All in all a good exciting season with a pretty good plotline, lots of interesting twists, a dramatic finale, that sets up a new world for the next season.  Pay close attention to the season and you will see one of the major villans of a future season appear in one episode.",1071705600,,1635,4.780141843971631
1788170,5,B00006RCNX,"""I personally don't think there could be a crazier plan.""
""We attack the mayor with humus.""
 - Cordelia and Oz, repsectively
This season is arguably the best of the series. It is certainly where the show hit its stride, and hit it hard. Starting and ending with a bang, and with more than enough substance, style, humor, and drama in between, this season is just out and out enjoyable.
When Kendra's death calls Faith, an unorthadox and voraciously hot slayer, to Sunnydale, things in the Scooby melting pot get interesting. There's plenty of tension between the two slayers, a good deal of whos-playing-who subterfuge when it becomes apparent that Faith likes killing just a bit too much, LOTS of tight pants on the female leads (double meow) and the greatest chick fight ever. All packed into twenty-two excellent episodes. Party in my eyesocket, and everyone's invited.
Faith is not the only character introduced in this season. Foremost among the newcomers is the season's Big Bad, the mayor. A demon who built Sunnydale over a century ago for demonic reasons, the dapper, polite, and insanely cheerful nemesis is in a class unto himself in the pantheon of Buffy villains. With hilarious propriety, a politician's sense of humor, a huge dislike of germs, and a winning smile, Mayor Richard Wilkins III has just as many enjoyable moments as Buffy and the Scooby gang, and is just as fun to watch.
However, it's not just the apacolypse (. . .again) that the Scoobies have to deal with. There's plenty of teenaged angst and romance to go around. Buffy and Angel's off and on relationship is dealt with (and Angel is prepped for his own show), there is a passionate quadrangle between Oz, Willow, Xander, and Cordelia. . . heck, even Giles gets some. All in all, this season is great, both in humor and in drama. There are so many great and memorable episodes, from ""Anne"" to ""Amends"" to ""The Zeppo"" to ""Graduation Day"" that it almost seems unfair to all the other shows on DVD right now. Almost.
The extras just keep getting better on these DVD's. With featurettes, comentaries, interviews, and much more, the BtVS series ranks high among the DVD's that will make extra-happy consumers like me more than content. Add to that the excellent video and sound, and this season is purchase worth for fans of the series and newcomers alike. Just remember to go easy on the swearing.",1071360000,,2376,4.795121951219512
1788171,4,B00006RCNX,"A very strong season. One of the main reasons is the character of Faith who is troubled but compelling. The Mayor is one of the series' greatest villains. The major weakness is Buffy/Angel's  typical teenage romance. It's quite soapy, melodramatic and repetitive.
Overall, I recommend this season. It's not perfect but the plot is strong and the characterizations are consistent.",1070323200,,379,5.316666666666666
1788202,5,B00006RCNX,"Ok, this series deserves a complete episode-by-episode rating
Anne - 7/10 Good start but not brilliant. Buffy is living away from home trying to get over Angel, and she falls into a hell dimension.
Dead Man's Party - 7/10 Good handling of the uncomfortable feelings between the Scoobies, but why zombies?!
Faith, Hope and Trick - 8/10 The New Slayer, Faith, arrives, but she unintentionally brings with her some new baddies...
Beauty and the Beasts - 9/10 The return of Angel. Major Buffy angst.
Homecoming - 10/10 Cordelia's selfishness leads Buffy to challenge her for Homecoming Queen, Willow and Xander kiss, and Mr Trick holds a Slayerfest '98 competition. A really brilliant episode, full of great Cordelia and Buffy bitchiness and the ending is really funny!!
Band Candy - 10/10 Another brilliant episode. The adults of Sunnydale eat bewitched candy that reverts them to a youthful state of mind... and Giles and Joyce do something they will regret... and Ethan Rayne is in this one too!!
Revelations - 9/10 Faith's new watcher arrives but isn't all she seems to be...
Lover's Walk - 10/10 THE angst episode of the series. Oz and Cordelia see Willow and Xander kissing, Spike comes back after Drusilla has broken up with him... this episode really plays on your emotions, especially when they trick you by showing you a funeral scene near the end (people who have seen this episode will know what I mean!)
The Wish - 10/10 Another great episode, set in an alternate universe where Willow and Xander are vampires.  The best part is the slow-motion fight-scene at the end, where we see our Scoobies fighting and killing each other *sniff*.
Amends - 8/10 Good episode although it didn't appeal to me instantly like most of the others did. The gang tries to find out why Angel is back in town and meet the First Evil (who crops up again as the Big Bad in Season 7). Jenny Calneder appears in this one.
Gingerbread - 9/10 Two children are found dead, the town goes on a witchhunt and blame Buffy and Willow for their deaths, and attempt to burn tbem at the stake. It is hilarious how Buffy kills the baddy in the end... and oooh, evil Joyce!!
Helpless - 9/10 Buffy's powers are taken away by Giles without her knowledge so that she can take a Council test pitting her against a vampire with only normal human strength. BUT the vampire escapes from his containment...
The Zeppo - 10/10 A Xander-centric episode, which although a big battle happens, we don't actually see much of it because we are following Xander being an unsung hero trying to stop the school from being blown up. And sleeping with Faith.
Bad Girls - 8/10 Pretty nothingy for most of the episode, following Buffy's downwards spiral to be like Faith, but a brilliant plot point when Faith kills a human...
Consequences - 7/10 Continues the angst over whether Faith will tell the police that she killed the man...
Doppelgangland - 10/10 Continues The Wish.  Willow-vampire has been sent to this dimension, and there are some of the funniest Buffy scenes ever when Angel tells Buffy and Xander that (he thinks) Willow is dead and they already know about the Willow-vampire, and when Willow confronts her vampire self.
Enemies - 9/10 Faith's bad side is exposed when she and the Mayor - the Big Bad of season 3, and the best Buffy villain ever, he is just such a jovial yet evil chap - take away Angel's soul with magic. Only their trick is in turn tricked by Buffy.
Earshot - 8/10 Buffy gains the power to hear people's thoughts, which is quite a weak individual plot line, but there are some very funny moments - Giles walking into the tree at the end, for instance.
Choices - 7/10 Buffy wants to take the fight to the Mayor, but when Willow is captured, it doesn't seem like such a good idea. Ooh, and Oz is violent.
The Prom - 7/10 Another weak stand-alone episode where werewolves are trained to attack the Senior Prom. Nice that all the characters are dancing with their love interests, even Buffy. A feel-good episode before the seaon finale.
Graduation Day Parts 1 and 2 - 10/10 The best season finale of the lot, tying in first place with Season 2 finale where Buffy killed Angel. Faith shoots Angel with a poisoned arrow,l Buffy stabs Faith because the only cure for Angel is the blood of a Slayer, but Faith manages to get away, so Buffy sacrifices herself and only just survives, Faith is in a coma and Oz and Willow sleep together for the first time.  In the second part the whole school attacks the Mayor as he ascends on Graduation Day, Cordelia stakes a vamp for the first time, we see Jonathon attacking vampires with great gusto, Harmony is bitten... And Buffy blows up the Mayor... and the school.  The ending is simple and very poignant, with the cover of their yearbook saying, ""The future is ours"".
An amazing series. Faith is a very complex character, and the Mayor is a brilliant villain, like a kindly uncle, but you can see the evilness in him, but almost a nice kind of evilness. He is a truly amazing character.  This is the last series where they are at high school, and after this series Buffy seems to loose something, a certain centered quality, since the Scoobies paths split out so much after this, as peoples' lives do when they enter university. This, and series 2, should be owned by everyone. All hail Joss Whedon.",1068854400,,5317,4.634146341463414

This season brought in Faith a character that is a favorite of many of the fans of the show.  It saw Angel leaving along with Cordy.  It got a new, awesome, opening with a fuller sounding theme.  And it hearaded the coming of Dawn and it saw what would be one of Buffy's final nemisis, The First, from the episode ""Amends.""

1788206,3,B00006RCNX,"The third season could have been infinitely better if it had done two things differently. One: Angel should have stayed in Hell. His character had no purpose in this season, other than to be the occasional sap, giving Buffy a pep talk or providing badly placed ""sexual tension,"" or whatever. All the segments with Angel looked deliberately contrived, were totally unbelievable, and quite pointless. Buffy could have gotten her moral pep from Giles or Willow or Xander, or even her Mother. Angel was just there. Even worse, Buffy was getting over having killed him in a very well-written way, so that by the third episode she was in a good emotional place. Then, of course, they chose to drag her back down into a wanna-be second season Buffy instead of moving on.
The other thing they should have done differently (besides Buffy's hair) was Buffy's attitude. While Faith offered a vibrant, energetic character to move the storyline along with much humorous violence and sarcasm, Buffy became infested with a superiority complex. She became Ms. Morality, the I-Killed-Angel-To-Save-The-World-I-Am-Perfect person. From the absurd Slayerfest episode, with her trying to be homecoming queen, to the Prom, Buffy was trapped in this limbo where she seemed unable to keep from moralizing herself against the infinitely inferior Faith. In this season, Faith seems more authentic than Buffy, because Buffy is all about being the good and proper slayer. She has no vices, she is unable to make a bad decision, and with her guidance, Faith can be a good person. Without an anti-Buffy like Faith, this season would be a total loss, because the whole Mayor thing just wasn't as engaging as the evil-Angel of the second season or the Master.
This season is notable for episodes like ""The Wish"" and ""Candy,"" but once Faith kills the Mayor's assistant, the show becomes a looping ""We have to save Faith from herself"" plot. What Buffy needs here is a good slap.  Too bad Angel didn't have enough personality here to give her one.",1066867200,2,2012,4.970326409495549
1788207,5,B00006RCNX,"Myself and everyone I've ever known (who watches ""Buffy"") agree that Season 3 is the best season of Buffy ever! If you're only going to get one season, get this one!
This year we get a bit of everything - comedy, in episodes like ""band candy"" (where all the adults in Sunnydale, including buffy's mom and Giles, eat candy that makes them act like teenagers), horror, in episodes like ""helpless"" (in which it is Buffy's 18th Birthday and she has to go through a watcher's test, in which they take away Buffy's slayer abilities and put her up against an insane vampire), bitter sweet melancholy, in episodes like ""the Prom"" (this episode encompasses the essence of character, Buffy. Tag-line ""I'm just a girl"" fits this description). Not to mention the many episodes including intriguing character, Faith, who spirals into becoming a rogue slayer.
This year the buffy gang must grow up, decide where their futures lie, graduate AND fight the mayor and his humorously evil plots.
Everything worked perfectly in this season - acting, script writing(with the great addition of comedic writer Jane Espenson joining the team), casting, storylines, all of it. And the score music by Christophe Beck really evoked the right emotion for each and every scene.
In addition to this the extras are well worth justifying the buy. Audio commentaries by doug petrie and jane espenson make for interesting viewing. Generally I hate commentaries and find them boring but these guys were a hoot and a half! I would have bought this season on dvd even if there were no dvd extras however cause the episodes stand so strongly together and apart.
A buy more than ten times its worth.
Just to add - some might wonder what the purpose was of Angel returning. Many many reasons are behind his return. For one thing (from looking at episode ""Amends"") he doesn't know why he is back - for good or for evil, thus backing his show's statment about making amends and fighting the good fight. Another reason is that this season is about choices. Buffy has to decide where her future lies - with or without Angel - if he was left for dead then she would never have had to make that decision. On top of that what we get is (arguably) a happy ""end"" to the buffy-angel romance. Though they can't be together they both live with the knowledge that they may one day unite again as a couple. We know this because in the first season of ""Angel"" we learn that Angel is destined to become a human. It all made perfect sense to bring Angel back - not just for character growth in season 3 of the show but also to give that deeper meaning Joss Whedon likes to incorperate - we can imagine what happens off-screen. The slayer notion, and the buffy/angel romance can continue with speculation and imaganination. It just gives it that deeper meaning that the trip to hell didn't.",1066867200,,2832,4.666

1788210,5,B00006RCNX,"Thank God this program has such a loyal and devoted cult following or else I never would have had the opportunity to get addicted to the show. I never gave it much thought before that, mainly due to it's title, but  I started watching during the awesome 3rd season and was fully immersed in the show's lore by the third show that year.  It combines the best of many genres; horror, teen movies (from the JD films of the 50's to the teenage melodramas of the 80's), vampire mythology, historical costume drama, comic book super-heroes, a touch of Anne Rice's tortured vampire stylings etc.,  and throws in a heaping dose of black humour for maximum effect.  The writers on this program were top notch and deserved more credit than they got, as do the cinematographers and special effects crew.  The show's main thrust is provided by Buffy Summers, a typical California teen who finds that she is the Slayer, the chosen one who is destined to protect the world from the various vampires, demons and ghouls that the general public doesn't know exists. She lives in Sunnydale, which happens to be situated on the Hellmouth, a place where demons ascend from their hellish environs.  She's aided by Giles, her Watcher-cum-librarian, Willow, a nerdy little redhead who dabbles in Wicca and the occult and Xander, her reliable, blundering oaf of a friend who had a serious crush on her in the early years. There's the pre-requisite anti-Buffy in the form of snobby, rich girl Cordelia (Veronica to her Betty) and the mysterious Angel, a vampire who was cursed with his soul by gypsies so he could wander the Earth haunted by the atroctities he commited, but who also falls in love with Buffy in spite of his  torment.  The best seasons are 2 and 3, when the show really hit it's stride, with story arcs that included the loss of Angel's soul when he experienced perfect happiness and his subsequent return as the deliciously evil Angelus, and the introduction of Faith, the anti-Slayer who went from good to bad with the help of the evil Mayor (without a doubt, the best villain the show came up with).  It would comfortably leap from well-lit high school hallways, where all the horrors of teenage society would be played out,  to creepy graveyards, where the show would delve into ancient mythologies dealing with vampires and demons and adding to that lore in the process.  Inventive, carefully constructed and highly entertaining, this show at least deserved to be taken as seriously as any of the Star Trek spinoffs infecting the airwaves.  Season 1 was the show finding it's feet, while 2 and 3 were creative peaks.  It's once Buffy and the gang left high school that the show became more of a hit and miss proposition. Several unlikeable characters, such as her new love interest Riley and ill-conceived sister Dawn, and a couple of story arcs that just stumbled along (the Glory season was uninspired and the Initiative plotline was a low point.) didn't do much for the series and left fans divided.  There were some great characters introduced in the latter years though...Spike was spectacular as the lovesick, de-fanged vampire and Anya was perfect as the former revenge Demon turned bluntly honest and confused human.  And the trio of nerd villians in season 6 continued the tradition of purely evil but loveable villians that started with the Mayor in season 3. And while the later seasons as a whole weren't the greatest, some of the best ever Buffy episodes were produced in that time (namely 'Hush', the silent episode which introduced the creepiest demons ever seen in Sunnydale, and 'The Body' where Buffy's mom dies unexpectedly of a brain aneurisym). The show's final season was a return to form and redeemed itself by tying up some loose ends and ending the show while it was still a pleasure to watch it.  It's definitely an underrated show that deserves a closer inspection if you never bothered watching it before. Enjoy playing catch up.",1065916800,,3954,4.8097345132743365

1788222,5,B00006RCNX,"Buffy Season 3 is a real gem! Rarely does episodic drama on television get this amazing! Every episode shines with not one bad apple in the mix. Here we have writing and characterization at its finest. Every character is given their chance to shine and the writing is so layered and well-formulated that you really do not expect what will happen next. This season had it all. Faith and the Mayor were the perfect foil to Buffy and Giles and provided not only gripping drama, but truely hilarious moments too. This is the last season for cast regulars Angel and Cordelia, who would move on the next season to the far superior ANGEL. We are also introduced to new characters such as Anne, Mr. Trick, Anya and bumbling Watcher Wesley. Wesley goes from being a one-note joke of a character to an amazingly complex and interesting character later on. Highlight epsiodes include ""The Wish"" were Cordelia envisions a Sunnydale without Buffy, ""Graduation Day"" where the Mayor kills off half the student body and we lose such fun characters as Principal Snyder and Harmony (well not really), and the one where a desperate Spike returns to try and find a way to win back Dru.

1788223,5,B00006RCNX,"What more can really be said about the third season of Buffy?
As a latecomer to the show, I have an insistence on watching both Buffy and Angel in the order they were originally shown in, so six boxsets later I only have yet to see the final three seasons of Buffy and the last two of Angel. Of course not watching season five of Angel when it debuts is going to be torture...But I digress.
I was hooked before this season, I was already roped it. But this season made me realize, all over again, *why* I was hooked...and just how good Buffy could be when it got going. With the introduction of Faith, and villians that have not been equaled anywhere else like the Mayor Richard Wilkins and Trick, it is not hard to see why this season is so beloved. Also this was Angel's last full season on Buffy before starting his own show. All of this, combined really made season three the best I have seen to date. I hear people praise season five alot...So we shall just have to see.
Regardless I highly recommend this for any Buffy fan. If you are new to the series, start with season's one and two. They are great as it is...But when you get to this you will realize the full glory that is The Slayer:)",1064275200,,1196,4.25
1788224,5,B00006RCNX,"Season Three of Buffy - In which we are introduced to Faith, the Vampire Slayer.
How would the Slayerettes cope without Buffy? And what would Buffy do with a life as a waitress, forgetting her job as a Slayer? These intriguing questions are answered in the season opener ""Anne"" (4/5), which is a consistently entertaining episode and one close to my heart as it was the first Buffy episode I ever saw. ""Dead Man's Party"" (3.5/5) lacked a good demon story, it was a rip off of Night of the Living Dead. The best qualities with this episode was seeing how hard it was for Buffy to fit back into life in Sunnydale.
Welcome Faith - ""Faith, Hope and Trick"" (3.5/5) sees the introduction of our sexy, rogue Slayer Faith with a troubled past. ""Beauty and the Beasts"" (4/5) is a good, underrated episode with a very blatant metaphor, but the fact of the matter is, that men abusing women is a BLATANT thing. I thought the episode was very well-done. ""Homecoming"" (3/5) had some original ideas, funny sequences and great effects but there were a whole lot of missed opportunities and the way a certain vampire died was ridiculous.
The highly praised ""Band Candy"" (3.5/5) was quite a bit of fun ruined somewhat at the end by a stupid back-story about a demon who eats babies. Had the story just been Ethan Rayne stirring up trouble the episode would've been a lot more enjoyable.
""Revelations"" (4/5) sees some great emotion scenes, you feel for all the characters in many different ways here. Very impressive that such enthralling, dramatic writing can come from a first-time writer - Doug Petrie! Well done!
""Lovers Walk"" (5/5) is one of the most impressive episodes ever. There is great development on every relationship, and just when things are looking at their lowest for the characters, Spike comes back and makes everything worse. You gotta love him. Cordelia's agony against Xander is understandable but whisks her away into bizarro-world when she makes a wish to Anyanka, a vengeance demon in ""The Wish"" (4.5/5), a brilliant and unique episode with an appealing gothic mood.
""Amends"" (3.5/5) does not feel like a Joss Whedon episode. It doesn't contain many great character moments or big revelations, its just a nice little holiday episode that moves too slowly for my liking. The final hilltop scene is one to remember though, now that's great writing. ""Gingerbread"" (3/5) is like a Hansel & Gretel story, except its not that interesting though there is an awesome acronym - MOO.
""Helpless"" (4.5/5) is terrifying and original, not all-out horror but an intelligent dramatic thriller with a great atmosphere, developments on the arc considering the Watchers Council and Giles' caring for Buffy as a daughter. ""The Zeppo"" (4/5) is not completely satisfying as a satire. The demons weren't really that good of an idea, and the end of the world thing was too rushed and quite annoying really. There was too much going on in the episode. But the thing that makes ""The Zeppo"" so good is the development on Xander's character and his eternal struggle to be cool. In this light, the episode succeeds wholesomely.
Let's take Faith to a darker place, says Joss. ""Bad Girls"" (4/5) and ""Consequences"" (4/5) allow us to do this. They are the beginning of Faith's turning to the dark side and make for great episodes. Balthazar in ""Bad Girls"" was a boring opponent but you gotta love the Faith/Buffy lesbian subtext, it was so much fun. Consequences have always been an interesting issue on Buffy, the Vampire Slayer and the theme is given justice with the very satisfying and aptly titled ""Consequences.""
""The Wish"" was great and on sale now - but wait, THERE'S MORE! Watch ""The Wish"" and you get ""Doppelgangland"" (4.5/5), an even better, funnier and better acted episode, written by Joss Whedon himself! There is so much clever dialogue humour in ""Doppelgangland"" and such a brilliant performance from Alyson Hannigan, which makes it one of the most consistently rewatchable episodes ever of Buffy, the Vampire Slayer.
We got more Faithage in ""Enemies"" (4.5/5), written by Douglas Petrie. The advancement on the Mayor's plan, the return of Angelus, the revelation that Faith has gone to the dark side (not to the audience, but to Buffy) and the great Buffy/Faith lesbo subtext yet again (Douglas Petrie loves these two...) make it so enjoyable.
""Earshot"" (4.5/5) is one of the most critically praised episodes of Buffy and rightfully so. It has a number of great scenes and is hilarious, but also a dramatic episode at heart because of the Jonathan/Buffy scenes and hearing the horrors of high school.
""Choices"" (4/5) sees Buffy's struggle to want to leave Sunnydale and go to college, and how Wesley and Giles must not permit that. She decides to go offensive on the Mayor, causing Willow to get captured. It's a great episode that has some excellent character and story developments. ""The Prom"" (4/5) is a lovely episode where we finally see how the students of Sunnydale High have noticed Buffy. It must've also been a very special episode for Sarah as she never got to go to her high school prom, so this might've been a nice replacement.
""Graduation Day, Part I"" (4/5) sees the great battle between Buffy and Faith, which is extremely entertaining. A lot of the rest of the episode is quite slow unfortunately, though it is very well structured. ""Graduation Day, Part II"" (5/5) was the brilliant close to the brilliant season three, with a terrific fight scene, great effects, plot points all tied up and lots of memorable character scenes.
Season three had a great season-long story with a few fillers along the way which is the most appropriate way to go. All the plot points were tied up and almost every viewer was left deeply satisfied. I can't give the season anymore praise than that.",1063929600,,5785,4.844444444444444
1788225,5,B00006RCNX,"This season is definitely the best yet.  The stand-alone episodes (such as Band Candy, Gingerbread, and The Zeppo) are all amazing, but Joss Whedon and the folks that bring you Buffy have outdone themselves with the story-arc episodes.  The twists and turns are great; first, Faith (Eliza Dushku), the new slayer (after Kendra died in Becoming, Pt. 1), and Mr. Trick, a powerful vampire, arrive in Sunnydale.  At first, Faith and Buffy team up, and Mr. Trick does his own thing to fight the slayers.  But then comes the Mayor.  Mayor Richard Wilkins III is not human; he is over 100 years old, and he built the town of Sunnydale on the Hellmouth for a reason: to give demons and vampires a feeding ground to play in (also, the Master (Mark Metcalf, who comes back in The Wish) was buried there).  The Mayor wants to ""ascend"" to a higher being, and on graduation day, he will.  He recruits Mr. Trick to help him out, and soon, Faith joins him as well.  The humor, the horror, and the emotions that this show delivers are amazingly strong.  The gang is back; Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Xander (Nicholas Brendan), Willow (the beautiful Alyson Hannigan), Giles (Anthony Stuart Head), Angel (David Borneaz), and Cordelia (Charisma Carpentar), and now Oz (Seth Green) all give stellar performances.  This season is definitely one of the best.
P.S.
Some of my favorite episodes include:
Band Candy, The Wish, Doppelgangerland (two Willows, very nice), and Graduation Day, Pts. 1 and 2.",1063324800,5,1482,4.845238095238095
1788226,5,B00006RCNX,"Now, looking back on BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER after seven utterly brilliant seasons, the magnitude of their achievement is still difficult to gauge.  Every season managed to be unique and original, both making a host of connections with the seasons preceding it, as well as carrying it boldly towards new plot lines, new characters, and fresh crises.  After the amazing second season of Buffy, with the heartbreaking story of Buffy and Angel's great love, it didn't seem possible that producer Joss Whedon and his crew could match their prior achievement.  Was Season Three better than Season Two?  Season Five better than either?  Six as good as any of those?  It really doesn't matter.  What is amazing is that for seven years, they managed to produce the most consistently fascinating series that television has ever seen, completely redefining what it was possible for the medium to do.
Season Three opens with one of my all time favorite episodes of BUFFY, ""Anne.""  Buffy, after the shattering events that close Season Two, flees Sunnydale for Los Angeles, where she gets a job as a waitress in a diner using her middle name, Anne.  She has renounced her past, her name, her vocation as slayer, and her sense of purpose in life.  By accident, she reluctantly agrees to help a girl, and ends up in a massive industrial plant run by demons and powered by human slave labor, with all the slaves reduced to identifying themselves as ""No One.""  One of the truly triumphant moments comes when one of the demons, going down a line of fresh slaves and forcing each one to identify him or herself as ""No One,"" arrives at Buffy, who up till this moment has rejected both her name and her vocation, and asks her who she is, to which she replies:  ""I'm Buffy, the Vampire Slayer.""  Simultaneously reembracing both her name and her vocation, she then proceeds to seriously smack demon butt in one of the best fight sequences in the entire run of the show.
The major plot lines of Season Three include the arrival of Faith, a somewhat rogue slayer who is Buffy's bad girl alter ego; the return of Angel from the demon dimension to which he had been sent at the end of Season Two; the attempt of the Mayor of Sunnydale to transform himself into a nearly invincible demon; Giles's termination as Buffy's watcher and the appointment of a new watcher, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce; and Buffy's ongoing struggle to find some kind equilibrium between her vocation as slayer and her desire to have a normal teenage life.  At the end of the season, Angel, realizing his relationship with Buffy is an impossible one, leaves Sunnydale for Los Angeles, where he will accidentally be joined both by Cordelia (who will mature from bratty Queen Bitch of Sunnydale High School into a magnificent heroine in her own right) and the prissy Wesley, who will eventually gain in heroic stature himself.  This illustrates the optimistic message of the Buffyverse:  people can change and become more than they are.  Clearly, in the Buffyverse, leopards can indeed change their spots, and people manage to do that with great regularity.  Vampires and demons as well.
Season Three brings to an end the Scooby Gangs high school years.  From this season forward, they will all be struggling with the kinds of issues that signal the passage to adulthood.  In this the philosophy of the makers of the series is manifest:  life is not a state, but a process.  People constantly deal with new problems and new situations.  People change.  Joss Whedon has said that in creating Buffy he created a character we could care about.  And we do.  We love her and the rest of the Scooby Gang because they are not static, because they do change, because they constantly meet new challenges and difficulties, and not just monsters and vampires.  We love them because they experience the same things we do.",1062547200,5,3846,4.787878787878788
1788227,5,B00006RCNX,"This is the season that counted for Buffy.  Halfway through season two, the televsion viewers discovered the allure of ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer,"" and could hardly wait to see what Joss Whedon and his team had in store.  What they had, was the tightening of creative bolts and flawless, seamless continuation.  The glue to this high-flying season of Buffy was the story-arc of a power hungry, half-demon who's the mayor of Sunnydale.  He looks to ascend and leave those who oppose him (and those whom he feels like) in his deadly wake.  He's a suberbly crafted villian, the kind you  love to see impaled, but one you can't take your eyes off of.
Naturally, this complicates things for Buffy, who has returned to Sunnydale after a summer in self-imposed exile.  In the seasons' first two episodes, she deals with the issues of healing her relationships with her mother and her close friends. Tempers and tensions mount before they explode at Buffys' welcome home party in the second episode.  Also on Buffys' platter, is the unexpected and sudden reemergence of Angel, whom she killed last season and the arrival of Faith, and unstable and overly-aggressive Slayer, who eventually makes a relationship with the mayor.  At first glance, all these overlapping storylines seem cluttered, but Buffys' gifted team of writers make it cohesive and fluid, while still packing the scripts with crackling dialouge and dry-as-twigs humor.
What makes season three exceptional is the mounting tension that builds throughout the season and reaches a fever pitch with the last batch of episodes when Buffy battles Faith, Angel once again is at the threshold of death and the mayor prepares his ascension.  It's all a whirlwind of sacrifice, impending doom and loyalty that ends triumphantly, which adds a nice contrast to the heartbreaking conclusion of the previous season.",1062201600,,1858,5.082236842105263
1788228,5,B00006RCNX,"This is a great dvd set to own as a true Buffy fan, it's the best season of all and it's a season that still leaves many people wondering ""Why didn't Xander and Willow stay more than just friends?"" I love the whole Xander/Willow saga and wish they had become a couple, but that didn't happen. Still great to watch them in the third disc on the set.
The episodes include:
Anne - My least favorite of the season but interesting to watch Buffy deal with the aftermath of her killing Angel.
Dead Man's Party - Joyce has a mask that has the power to resurrect dead people and all hell breaks loose during the Welcome Back buffy party the scoobies throw due to all the dead people.
Faith, Hope and Trick - New Slayer Faith arrives to Sunnydale. Buffy feels a little left out when everyone likes Faith.
Beauty and the Beast - It seems that Oz as a warewolf may have killed a student but it turns out to be a guy who's been doing the whole Jekyll/Hyde mad scientist bit.
Homecoming - One of my favorite episodes. Buffy decides to run for homecoming queen when Cordelia doesn't tell her about the yearbook pictures but things get crazy when they have to battle some killers that night at what Trick has denominated ""Slayerfest 98"" (they mistaken Cordelia for Faith). Willow and Xander start seeing eachother in a differnt light after they try on clothes for the dance and kiss.
Band Candy - LOL Hilarious episode. Grownups begin to act like immature teenagers due to some mysterious chocolate that's being sold to raise money for the band. Principal Snyder is great in this episode, you'll laugh hard watching him in this episode.
Revelations - One of other favorite episodes due to the awesome kiss Xander and Willow share behind the bookcases. A new watcher arrives in town to look after Faith and with news on a demon named Lagos who's after the Glove of Myhnegon.
Lover's Walk - Great episode, one of the best. Spike captures Willow and Xander so that Willow will perform a love spell on Drusilla. Also, Cordelia and Oz catch Xander and Willow making out. Unfortunatley, this is the last Xander/Willow episode.
The Wish - Cordelia wishes Buffy never came to Sunnydale and Anya (demon Ayanca) makes it come true. When it does, Cordelia finds herself in a differnt, scarier Sunnydale, ruled by vampires.
Amends - During Christmas, Angel's past victims begin haunting him and entice him to kill Buffy.
Gingerbread- During one of Buffy's nightly patrols she and Joyce discover two dead kids and this results in Joyce creating a force who want to kill all witches, including Willow and Buffy.
Helpless - Buffy looses her Slayer powers due to a test given to slayers on their 18th birthday by the council.
The Zeppo- Xander saves the day when a group of dead guys have a bomb set up and no one has a clue because they're all dealing with yet another demon.
Bad Girls- Buffy gets a new Watcher which prompts her to take Faith's advice and rebel but it all turns ugly when Faith accidently kills man.
Consequences- Angel tries to help Faith see the error of her ways
Dopplegangland- Another great episode. Willow comes face to face with Vampire Willow. Gotta love how Vamp Willow beats up Percy and he does his homework
Enemies- Faith and the Mayor find a way to rid Angel of his soul, but the joke's on them. Great twist.
Earshot- Buffy can hear everyones thoughts. The first part is hilarious, especially Xander and Oz. Later Buffy hears someone think that they will kill everyone at school at that same time the next day.
Choices- After Buffy and Angel steal a box containing demonic spiders for the Mayors Acension, he and Faith kidnap Willow.
The Prom- A classmate plots to set loose three hell hounds at the prom after a girl rejects him and Buffy is out to stop it. Angel also breaks up with Buffy. Xander buys Cordelia a prom dress which brings them both to peace with eachother. Buffy gets a special award. Guranteed to make you bawl :)
Graduation Day 1 - Faith shoots Angel with a poisonous arrow to distract Buffy from the Mayor. The cure? The blood of a Slayer. This causes Buffy to set out to kill Faith in order to save Angel
Graduation Day 2 - The big day has arrived. Graduation and the Acension. Everyone prepares for the event. What the Mayor doesnt know is that the whole class is prepared to fight back. Also, Angel leaves town. You'll laugh till you cry when the Mayor as a big snake eats Principal Snyder. Soooo FUNNY!!!

I really like how the characters have grown over the season like Willow  has a boy friend, Cordilia doesn't tease the Scooby Gang as much Xander is Falling in love with Cordilia, but Buffy and Angels relationship has taken a turn for the worst torwards the end of the end of the season. I think this season is one of their bests. I like the episode Earshot because you suspect that someone is planning to blow up the scool but it's actually a school lunch lady that wants to poison the students. The rest of the 21 episodes are also funny in their own ways. I think the part when Buffy runs through the school (Graduation Day part2) wile the mayor is chasing after her then out the window Buffy goes, the mayor is traped in the schools library and then BOOOOM the School blows up, I thought that was cool with the special affects. When A new slayer comes to town named Faith in the beginning of this season, Buffy gets along with her until she goes overboard with the slaying like in the episode Bad Girls when she kills a human person then Faith turns her back on the Gang and starts having a bond with the mayor.

1788231,5,B00006RCNX,"How do you top the wonder that is Buffy's second season? Add a quirky big bad, a rogue slayer, an alternate world, and the struggle that is Buffy and Angel's relationship and you've got something that is almost as good (and is good enough for some fans) to top the second season.
 This is the season where I really became a major fan of Buffy. The writers never disappointed. Although the beginning episodes seem a bit off in places (Anne - Beauty & the Beasts, but all are good in their own way), the season plot really begins to take shape. The Mayor is introduced, and his plans to ""ascend"" and take over the world are revealed. Faith was introduced in the third episode as the Slayer to replace Kendra from season 2, and she is one heck of a character. Especially after she commits a horrible accident and decides to jump on the Mayor's side. The season's middle showcases some of the best stand alone episodes (although storyline is furthered along little by little). The Wish and Doppelgangland give us a taste of a different world for the Slayerettes. Also in the third season is the show's more controversial episode, Earshot.
 As usual, the cast continued to mature and surprised the viewers with their abilities. Sarah Michelle Gellar's ability to show many ranges of emotion is great, and is seen in Revelations to Amends to the final showdown with the Mayor. Alyson Hannigan and Nicholas Brendon continue to mature their characters in a flawless way. David Boreanaz and Charisma Carpenter left the show with a bang and lasting impressions. Anthony Stewart Head was there as the mentor, and Seth Green's bigger part was appreciated. New to show was Eliza Dushku. She put a lot of spark into the show with her character. Emma Caulfield's intro was priceless.
 The DVD set settled my craving for the third season with plenty of informative featurettes, great commetary listens, and spiffy menus. FOX should be highly thanked for giving us these seasons like they are. But should be glared at for not doing it as fast as they are in the UK.
 Buffy's third season was just a foreshadowing of the more good stuff to come from the actors, writers, and Joss Whedon himself in the future.",1058486400,,2191,4.697916666666667
1788252,5,B00006RCNX,"Season 3 of 'Buffy' continues with the dark tone of the 2nd year, while finishing some storylines that went unresolved, and setting up some new ones. It is by far the most addicting year of the series, playing like a soap opera that doesn't want to let go. I stopped watching the series after the first episode of this season, so thank goodness for the DVD sets. Once I popped this baby in, I COULD NOT stop watching. While it does start off a bit weak, this amazing series grows and ends strong in every possible way.
Anya and Faith; two of my favorite 'Buffy' characters; are introduced here, and this season brilliantly foreshadows what will come later in the show.  I am continually amazed with the show's exceptional writing and brillint acting, as well as the well-developed characters and complicated storylines.

The writing and directing in this season was amazing with the most important and influential episodes of the series: ""The Wish"" ""Amends"" ""Bad Girls"" ""Earshot"",  and ""Graduation Day"".  WIthout these episodes the series would never be the same.  This is the season to own if you enjoy the philosophical depth of Buffy and the extreme character development that occurs in this season.  For new Buffy fans.  See how the character become the way they are.  This is only second in my opinion of terms of Buffy DVDs (season 4 being my fav DVD set).  A must buy!",1057881600,,787,4.597122302158273
1788254,5,B00006RCNX,"In my mind, Buffy S3 does not surpass the greatness of S2, but it is a solid season nonetheless.  While it starts weak, it grows and ends strong in every possible way.  See the introduction of two of the show's best characters, Anya and Faith; a tough Big Bad in the Mayor and a welcome change in vampire personality, Trick. The two part season finale (Graduation Day 1&2) is worth buying the whole set, which beats the quality of downloads found on the internet and the choppiness of rerun episodes on F/X.
There are many more unforgettable episodes such as 'The Wish,"" ""The Zeppo,"" ""The Prom,"" ""Earshot,""....I think you get the point. I could very well list just about all of them.
The picture and sound quality are somewhat improved upon that of the tv reruns, and S1 & S2 sets. The menus and episode chapters make the set easy to navigate and the overall look of it is fantastic.  The box cover art is gorgeous as one of the fold out portions has a wonderful display of the demons with Anyanka front and center. There are a few commentaries, but who needs the commentaries when the enchanting episodes speak for themselves.",1057622400,,1127,4.569306930693069

1788256,4,B00006RCNX,"Season Three was one of my favorite seasons.  You get to see the end of the Buffy-Angel relationship,see Willow in a new light (Not to mention Willow and Xander), and you get the arrival of Faith and the Mayor.  It was a good season backed with episodes like Dopplegangland, Gingerbread, The Prom, Graduation 1&2, and Earshot.  The season was great but the DVD extras were a completely other story.  A few featurettes were good like Buffyspeak , The season overview,a look at the wardrobe, and special effects but everything else was drastically short of measuring up.  The picture gallery was drastically smaller then the one in season two and most of the interviews for specific episodes had long preludes and contained the same thing as the season overview.  Joint episodes like Bad Girls/Consequenses and Graduation 1&2 had the same interview even though there listed as seperate episodes.  So if your a diehard fan its definitly recommended but if your looking for fun DVD extras look somewhere else.",1056499200,,1005,4.982035928143713
1788257,5,B00006RCNX,"In this 3rd Season of Buffy a lot happens, it goes somewhere. It's certainly a lot better than the last 2 seasons by far. It's a shame there won't be anymore seasons as the Series Finale leaves viewers flat wanting more. Anyway back to season 3.
 Season 2 left us with Buffy having to send Angel to a hell dimension to save the world. She then left Sunydale and the 3rd season starts off with her trieing to make it on her own. After fighting off an evil demon who uses young runaways as slaves, Buffy returns to Sunydale. There she doesn't get that much of a happy welcome back as everyone is mad at het for leaving.
 After the gang makes up with Buffy, they're back to fighting evil together again. They are soon joined by a sexy new Slayer named Faith (Eliza Dusku). She's a loose cannon who both Buffy and Giles have trouble controlling. Soon Angel is some how brought back from the hell dimension. Buffy has to fight off her feelings for him because one moment of true happiness with her would make him evil again.
 The main villain of the season is the Mayor of Sunydale. The Mayor has a big plan to turn into giant snake like creature on Graduation day and have a big feast on students. He also takes Faith under his wing which leads to Faith turning bad and having a big feud with Buffy.
 Anyway this is a must have season for Buffy fans, it has a lot of action, drama and the best writing of any of the seasons.",1056240000,,1420,4.2481481481481485
1788258,4,B00006RCNX,"After the acclaimed, almost legendary second season of the show, where the series achieved the perfect balance between its buoyant humour and unexpected moments of pathos, Buffy the Vampire Slayer showed signs of tiring out a little.  In Season 3, the creators of the show seem a little heavy-handed, laying on the emotional gravity so thick that the humour is often drowned -- and the humour is what makes the characters so lovable in the first place, providing contrast to the emotional outbursts.
Buffy's character in Season 3 starts to become a mite too  sourpuss for my taste, brooding and moralizing her way through the episodes, showing much less that vibrant sense of humour that had made her so great in the beginning.  Sarah Michelle Gellar's performance in the first two seasons was much more nuanced; in this season, every episode gives her a chance to do the troubled, locked-brow, pursed-lip expression.  Maybe it's just me, but hitting Buffy's internal turmoil every single episode seems too much.  Good thing the supporting cast keeps up the energy:  Nicholas Brendon, Alyson Hannigan and Anthony Stewart Head continue to play their roles with relish, and David Boreanaz leaves the show (to move on to his own show, Angel) in style.
This season is weaker than the previous one, but it benefits from the addition of two major talents:  Star Eliza Dushku and writer Jane Espenson.  Dushku, a veteran actress at the tender age of 18 during this time, had been a perennial scene-stealer (most notably in True Lies), is easily the most charismatic actor ever to appear in the Buffy series -- a notable feat given competition from James Marsters, Hannigan and Boreanaz.  And her character Faith, the psychologically troubled, explosive renegade slayer, is justifiably a favourite of the show's history, athletic, sexy, dark and vulnerable at the same time, made all the more likeable by her very prominent character flaws.
And the show's already formidable roster of writers (Joss Whedon, Marti Noxon and Douglas Petrie are ever-reliable) is strengthened by the addition of Jane Espenson, a smart writer whose signature is much like Noxon's in the second season -- with a focus on wry, witty episodes that present humour and character advancement in equal measure.  Her hilarious ""Earshot"" and ""Gingerbread"" are two of the best episodes this season.
I don't watch this DVD set as much as I had the last two, but for a show to go three seasons and retain so much value is a real feat.  Despite some shortcomings, this set is still a must-buy, if only to watch Eliza Dushku chomp up the scenary in one of the best TV performances I can remember.",1055808000,,2653,4.926008968609866
1788259,4,B00006RCNX,"This season had its ups and downs. First of all, it was so cheery. That counts as a down. It was much more cheery than the previous two seasons, and for one thing Buffy was very attatched to Angel the latter half of the season, which was stupid considering the last time that happened he went--in the words of the characters on Angel and Buffy--GRR!! The show lost a lot of its dark and gloom which had been the secret to its success in my opinion. But the shows storylines did not wane--but instead they got better. Which is why this is still something you need to buy. I love this season--its excellent. I love all the seasons of Buffy. But if I had to rank them, this would be the 5th best season yet. Those before it being Seasons 2,5,7,1, and those after it being Seasons 6 and 7 , which had one thing in common, the lack of a true ""Big Bad"" and overall seasonal coherence. Just because I would say this is the fifth best doesn't mean that this is a bad season, its just that Buffy is a phenomenal show, and there are unbelievably good seasons that stand out. Buy this, you won't be dissapointed.",1055721600,,1101,4.2727272727272725
1788260,5,B00006RCNX,"I loved Buffy ever since Season 1. I love this DVD! You can watch each episode over and over again. One episode which really stands out is ""Amends"" in which Angel is tormented by The First Evil by reminders of what he had done as Angelus and even contemplates suicide. Of course nothing beats the two-part season finale ""Graduation Day."" Also, you can really get a feel for the new characters, especially Faith, the Rogue Slayer. You can understand how she is feeling and basically love her and hate her at the same time. I would rate this with more stars if it was possible. This is a MUST for any Buffy fan or anyone with good taste in television.",1054684800,,649,4.416666666666667

1788272,5,B00006RCNX,"As someone who was way past high school when Buffy premiered, I was one of those who derided the show just from the title alone. But Sarah Michelle Gellar's stint from All My Children made me tune in occasionally just out of curiousity and I got hooked forever during the Halloween episode from the second season.
If you could only buy one of the Buffy DVDs, I would give the 3rd season of this show a slight edge over season two. I think Whedon, Gellar and the rest of the cast and crew really hit their stride and peaked during this year although they would show more than a few flashes of brilliance in subsequent seasons. Still in high school, the Scoobies were still very much a cohesive unit with a gamut of personalities. Plus, in a show with such quirky villians, we have the Mayor (the quirkiest), Faith (the most complex) and Vampire Willow (definitely the funniest).
The storyline during season three involved Faith, a renegade slayer, starcrossed romances...Buffy and Angel, Willow and Oz, Xander and Cordelia not to mention a mayor with aspirations of snake demonhood. During the 22 episodes we are introduced to characters such as Tricky and Anya. There is also Vampire Willow who provides more than a hint of what is to come for the Scoobies in future seasons.
Despite it's title and premise, Buffy is/was one of the most clever shows to hit the small screen ever with it's practice of using monsters as metaphors of real life. Even the mediorce episodes and seasons often surpassed the best of other television shows. Though it declined somewhat in it's later seasons, I am already in mourning with just one original Buffy episode to go. Thank goodness for DVDs.",1052870400,7,1678,4.73037542662116

While dark with its offbeat humor, we were introduced to very interesting new characters (the Mayor, Faith) and David B (aka Angel) doesn't have his non-eating, too much eye makeup problem from the previous seasons.  Willow really starts to come into her own as a witch, and the cast continues to flesh out and deepen their characters so well, it's hard to remember sometimes (save for the vampires, demons, etc.) that it isn't real. Doesn't hurt that Giles & Xander remain my hunks of choice (in that order).  :) I'm really sorry Buffy is ending, but it's been a great 7 seasons and I'll be sure to get the rest of the season collections on DVD to re-visit the Scooby Gang.",1052438400,2,716,4.542635658914729

1788277,5,B00006RCNX,"The third season of ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer"" is another exciting, witty season. It still holds the basic formula of horror, humor, and emotion, with a very important new character -- bad-girl slayer, Faith. Faith adds a mix of daring danger for Buffy, which proves deadly. Season Three also lives up to the shows' ever-occurring baddies; this time it's the Mayor of Sunnydale. He plans to destroy Sunnydale on Buffy's most important day -- graduation. Season Three's episodes foreshadow what's to come for future seasons, especially Season Four, which make it an essential element to your collection!
As for the DVD set, it couldn't have gotten much better! Containing 6 discs and all 22 episodes, the layout was also nice. It folds out six times, each side containing a memorable Season Three quote and photo. Each disc has a character photo printed on it and contains many, many extras.

1788278,5,B00006RCNX,One of the best seasons of one of the best television shows. A must have.,1051833600,,73,3.933333333333333
1788279,5,B00006RCNX,I didn't ever watch this show until I was stuck in a hotel room for a few weeks and caught some reruns.  After I got back I convinced the wife to let me buy the first 3 box sets.  I have to say that each season is better than the one before it.  I haven't seen any beyond the 3rd season yet because I'm trying to stay away so I can watch the box sets without knowing what will happen.  The 3rd season though was my favorite for 2 reasons.  First because it signalled Angel finally leaving.  I always thought he was kind of annoying on the show and that Buffy's obsession with him distracted from some of the more interesting plot ideas.  Second though is the appearance of Faith.  Faith is also a slayer but a bit of a rogue.  That puts an interesting spin on some of the reused plotlines to make this all in all a great season.,1051660800,,828,4.093167701863354
1788280,5,B00006RCNX,"This show is probably the best written and best acted TV series I have seen.  I have seen every episode of it, in now it's 7th and final season.  You can go back to the beginning and see how it all began.  The characters are unforgettable, their dialog is beautifully written, and personalities are well defined unique to each one.  One can enjoy the one liners especially from Xander, Buffy, and Faith.  It is truly hilarious on one side, yet can switch instantly to touching and serious in the blink of an eye.  I recommend this DVD set to anyone, and the other seasons available as well.  I already own the first three seasons, and I plan to buy season four when it is released.",1051142400,,681,4.4
1788281,5,B00006RCNX,"I may be preaching to the choir here, but this is was the best season of Buffy.  And with the third DVD set released, they do seem to be getting better with more extra features.
Before I start my review of the season, I would like to give a short review of the show.  I must admit that I was not there from the beginning because I thought that it was the same kind of teen show that the WB is famous for.  I became hooked during the second season and have never looked back.  It does have a cast of teenagers and the token adults to keep things a tad realistic, but the characters and story have such depth, that it becomes more than a teen drama.  The writing is where it all starts, then with the acting and directing, everything falls into place.
As for season 3, the writing is immaculate.  The wit and drama meld into beautiful iron cast of pure entertainment.  But let's not make Buffy out to be something else.  It is only a TV show meant to entertain, and this season does not disappoint.  I think that the introduction of Faith and Mayor as the new nemesis brought this show to it's peak.  (not that the other seasons were bad because they were very good, but compared to season 3, they all fall a little short)
Faith the vampire slayer was like the anti-Buffy and she was able to add a new mixture of sexuality, complexity and unpredictability to the cast.  With the main crew established in their roles, it was hard to create drama within the group aside from resident evil in town or Angel.  Faith brought that new spark that made the other characters reflective and she pushed them to made changes and decisions that made for a great story.  We see how Xander and Willow evolved and explored a new roles within the group.
Now as far as big evils are concerned, I think that next to evil Angel, the Mayor was the best bad guy.  He had wit and charm that was second to none.  The fact that he was human (or demon) to start made his actions more mysterious and significant.  And the fact that he employs Faith and Angel during his stay made for some grand conflicts.
Now Buffy is a cult favorite and I'm not sure how many new fans will be won by reading these reviews, so I suggest those who are on the fence about the show, please check out an old episode on TV.  Try to see through that teen""esque"" veneer and see some good characters and great writing.",1050969600,3,2365,4.278651685393259
1788302,5,B00006RCNX,"The third season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is definately one of the better seasons. Faith (Eliza Dashku) brings a whole new flare to the show in this season. The season starts out like any other season basically,kill a few demons here and there, blah blah blah. Then Faith comes. She brings attitude and spunk to the show, not that it didn't have it before, but she adds some to it. Faith starts out helping Buffy and the Scoobies on there Demon hunting, then as the show progresses Faith gets a more and more ""Evil"" the more the show goes on the darker it gets until Faith is then working for the mayor of Sunnydale. Who is really EVIL. I would recomend this season to anyone, as well as the first season and secons. I am really looking forward to the fourth season coming out on DVD,YAY! lol",1050796800,,795,4.378378378378378
1788303,4,B00006RCNX,"As I've stated in previous reviews, you can't say much about the season.  Again, it's a classic.  Though, had I been Joss, I would have left Buffy in LA longer than one episode and explored the dynamic of her being cut off from all her support but still fighting demons.  Other than that, the season has a lot going for it for several reasons.  First, there is an edginess to both Buffy and Faith (the new slayer) as both of them flirt with the dark side.  Second, the relationship between Buffy and Angel is powerful, and again is what really carries the season forward.  Its really weird that Buffy, after Angel returns from the dead, toys with the idea of leaving him and then gets horribly upset when he leaves her.  Women.  Finally, the season has a lot of character development, especially the episodes Bad Girls, Consequences, and The Prom.  The relationship between Faith and the Mayor, and Buffy to her supporting cast, and the supporting casts internal development, round out a really quite nice package.  Other episodes that deserve honorable mention are The Wish, where Cordelila wishes for a world without Buffy (and Willow and Xander are Vampire lovers); Amends, where Angel struggles with all his past misdeeds at Christmas, including Jenny Calendar, who want Angel to kill Buffy (and is somehow linked to Season 7, though Im not sure yet); and Lovers Walk, if for nothing else to see a humorous side to Spike as he talks about his relationship problems with Drusilla to Joyce (Buffys mom) and teases Angel, who Joyce thinks is still evil.
Having said my peace about that, time to move on to the really important stuff: what's on the disc.  As with the other two DVDs, this is the complete third season, meaning you get every episode, and not just the ""important"" ones as on the videos.  The transitions are much smoother, and the animation is played down, much to my delight.  The interviews with Joss are great, except for one thing: they are sprinkled liberally over the disc and not put in one central location.  The problem with that is you watch an interview and if you haven't seen the season yet (I hadn't) then the surprise is ruined for you.  One big disappointment from the last season is that the special features were once again limited to cast and crew interviews.  There weren't any commercials, either for Buffy or the new Angel series, and most of the interviews were with Joss and not the cast.
On the whole, Mutant Enemy and Fox have produced another first class TV season on disc for our repetitive viewing pleasure.  I only gave it four stars because there is so much more that could be done for the special features, but you can't fault the actors or the show itself; that's all first class material.",1049846400,,2737,4.66875
1788304,5,B00006RCNX,"This season was awesome.  I like how the addition of Faith changed the tone of the show.  As noted elsewhere, Faith was clearly Buffy's alterego, and these two characters performed well.  A must have for Buffy fans.  Prior seasons may drag a bit, so, buy this season first if you like Buffy, but are not sure about making a purchase.",1049673600,,333,4.5
1788305,5,B00006RCNX,"The greatness of Buffy's Season Three can be summed up in one word: FAITH
This is not just Buffy's best season, but arguably the best season of any TV series.

1788306,4,B00006RCNX,"Many reviews on here about the season itself... so I am going to rate mostly on the technical end.

Simple menu system with no lame 10 second animation, cleat linear notes, and great transfer.",1049328000,,320,4.578947368421052
1788307,5,B00006RCNX,"Many people argue whether the 2nd or 3rd seasons of Buffy was better. I feel that both were equally good, and the transition between them (both story wise and 'issue' wise) was very smooth.
We begin with Buffy being in LA, then returning home, and everyone around her (including herslef) have to deal with issues raised by her absence. Angel comes back, and we have yet another occurance of 'Buffy - not - telling - everyone - the - whole - story' (which by now is getting a little tired).
Some issues that were raised in the 2nd season come back in the 3rd - the Buffy / Angel relationship (which was rather too anemic this season compared to the previous season's drama), and the role vs. responsibilities of the slayer are 2 examples.
while the 2nd season often treated these issues rather lightly (even though it was more serious than season 1) - season 3 takes on these issues head - on. Compare, for instance the fact that Buffy killed 'Ted' in the 2nd season to the deputy mayor being killed in the 3rd. While Ted eventually turned out to be a psychotic robot, the deputy mayor was a real human being killed by a slayer. The consequences of the Angel / Buffy relationship in season 2 were dramatic, but only now both Angel and Buffy face the true problems and issues of their relationship, resulting in Angel's leaving...
The existance 2nd slayer is further explored - but now we get a more complex person as a slayer, rather than the 'perfect slayer', clear cut Kendra. While Kendra had inspired the good in Bufy as a slayer, Faith is portraying the darker side of the job (which she actually enjoyed). One of the things I didn't like about this season is that Faith's turning evil was don in a very hurried way, even though we realize how unstable she is from the first time we meet her...
Another issue raised in this season is the fact that the 'normal' people in Sunnydale finally face the realization that Sunnydale is NOT a perfectly normal, peaceful town, but a dangerous place to live in. Buffy's co - students finally acknowledge her place and importance in the school by making her 'Class Protector'.
This season closes the 'High School Years' period of the show, and ends with many drastic changes done to our core group of heros: Angel and Cordelia leave, Giles is no longer a watcher, Buffy and Willow move on to college while Xander moves between odd jobs. One thing is for certain - it doesn't matter if you think the series gets better or worse in the future seasons - it would definitely won't be the same.",1048291200,2,2531,4.528384279475983

This season is the best of the series (1-7) the writing hit its stride and the action was there. The only ""bore"" was the Buffy/Angel on and off relationship, but even that was still interest",1047340800,,224,4.625
1788339,5,B00006RCNX,"Season 3 of Buffy is simply the best season of Buffy. It has everything you could possibly want in a season, and nothing you wouldnt want. If it was posssiblie i would give this season 100 stars. The introduction of Faith was just brilliant, she has proven to become one of Buffy's most intersting and exciting characters. This season's best episodes are Faith, Hope and a trick which is the episode where Faith is introduced, Dead Man's Party, Band Candy, Helpless, Bad Girls, Earshot, The Prom, Graduation Day Part One, and the best episode of Buffy of all time, Graduation Day Part two. This episode is simply the best because it has everything, the mayors ascension, who is also Buffy's best big bad, who is as great as being evil, as he is being hilarious (he has some incredibly funny lines. The fight between the ""new"" mayor and the students of SUnnydale High which is simply incredible, and Angel leaves. Angels exit from the show is very sad, and will touch fans of Buffy deeply because of how much Buffy and Angel really love eachother. Overall best season ever, best big bad ever, best everything ever. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended, if your'e into Buffy, this is the one that will please yout he most. Of course everyone should get Seasons 1 and 2 before 3, but get it, because you will definately not be dissapointed, and will have a great and enjoyable experience watching it. Again, highly recommended, and an absolutely wonderful season",1046908800,3,1448,4.75

I wish they had an interview with Sarah Michelle Gellar and the entire cast..maybe on the very last DVD they will.  Here's something for you Buffy fans to look for in case you haven't already.  Season 7 is dealing with the ""First Evil"" and even refers to some events that took place in season 3. If you watch Season 3 closely, you will see references made to the First in that season.

1788342,5,B00006RCNX,"You'd think one would get to enjoy one's senior year in high school, but for one Buffy Summers.....it's NEVER easy.  For fans of the TV cult hit, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, the 3rd season would provide some of the most memorable moments in the show's history. Not only did the season bring an end to both the high school arc and the Buffy/Angel romance, which drove the show, it would introduce one of the show's most captivating characters in the rogue Slayer, Faith.  It certainly caused considerable controversy when an episode and the 2nd part of the season finale were both delayed until almost the start of the following season by the WB in an overreactive response to the Columbine shootings. Needless to say, the WB took considerable and justified flak for that one.
As always, Sarah Michelle Gellar is at the top of her game as the title character,  while David Boreanez is back in fine brooding mode as her vampire boyfriend, Angel.  Alyson Hannigan is a treat as she plays her ""evil vampire"" twin in a couple of wonderful episodes, but it is Eliza Dushku's wild-child Faith and Harry Groener's Ward Cleaver-like Mayor that practically steal the show.  Dushku is wonderful at playing the conflicted, lonely and rebellious Slayer as she practically takes over every scene she's in.  Groener matches her with a gleefully folksy style that makes him one of the most memorable villians ever on the show.
As with the previous DVD sets, the special features are a bit on the thin side.  Mainly some promotional featurettes, selected episode commentaries, and interviews recycled for the 3-pak VHS set.  Still, for fans of the show, this is a must-have for your collection. Especially if you enjoy top-notch TV, this is definitely recommended.",1045526400,3,1745,4.8915254237288135

Faith: ""Little Miss Muffet counting down 7-3-0"". Refering buffy as little miss muffet and 730 as 730 days, or two years, when buffy sacrifices her life to save the world and dawn. and speaking of faith, she'll be back soon in the new season :). This season introduced faith, the rogue slayer, as a good guy gone bad. She ended up helping the mayor achieve his ascension, and led to his downfall. This season started out with Buffy in L.A. living by herself since she ran away. but after one episode in the big bad city, she returns home.

1788367,4,B00006RCNX,"This is the season of Buffy that I love simply because of guest star Eliza Dushku (Faith).  Eliza's portrayl of Faith was, and still is, one of someone searching for something to belong to.  Who hasn't felt like they didn't belong or fit in?  To wit, here is a list of MUST-WATCH Faith-related episodes:
Disc 01 Episode 03: Faith, Hope, & Trick - this episode introduces Faith with the memorable line, ""Isn't it weird how slaying makes you hungry and horny?""
Disc 02 Episode 07: Revelations - Faith places her trust in Buffy only to be lied to, believes Xander only to be mislead by his hatred of Angel, and follows Ms. Post only to have Ms. Post belittle her and try to kill her.  It illustrates just how great the divide is between Faith and the Scooby Gang.
Disc 04 Episode 13: The Zeppo - Faith and Xander do it.  Nuff said.
Disc 04 Episode 14: Bad Girls - Buffy and Faith begin to bond only to have it broken with an unintentional murder.
Disc 04 Episode 15: Consequences - Faith denies the murder, showing her descent into darkness and emptiness.
Disc 05 Episode 17: Enemies - Faith's duplicitousness is revealed.
Disc 06 Episode 21: Graduation Day Part One - Buffy and Faith fight; Buffy proves Faith right when she mortally injures her.
There are other stand out episodes too...
Disc 02 Episode 06: Band Candy - see Giles as ""The Ripper"" when Sunnydale adults become teenagers (mentally) after consuming chocolate candy. Hilarous episode.
Disc 02 Episode 08: Lovers Walk - Spike returns, madness ensues.  Buffy and Angel realize they can never be ""just friends,"" Xander and Willow kiss in front of their respective honeys, and Spike chews up scenery with his broken heartedness.
Disc 05 Episode 18: Earshot - Buffy becomes temporarily telepathic.
Disc 06 Episode 19: The Prom - classic Slayer-Saves-The-Day...and the whole school knows that she's the reason more of them are still alive.
Why only 4 Stars?  Because ""Dead Man's Party"" and ""Gingerbread"" were ridiculous and could've been written better.

The  DVD transfers are very good but tend to be dark in season 2 and 3. Perhaps some aging of the film stocks produced this but this is just a minor point. I have collected the first three seasons so far and will get the whole series. Buffy is one of the few T.V. series that I would own the whole of. What a gift Buffy is to T.V. world and how underrated. My uncle and I agree, some of the best writing on T.V. Keep it up Joss. Thanks.",1044489600,,555,3.8684210526315788
1788369,5,B00006RCNX,"This is easily one of the best seasons of Buffy (Was there really a bad one ever?  Nope, can't think of one).  This is the pinnacle of the Love between Buffy and Angel.  The pain and anguish of a lost love and the introduction of Faith (Eliza Dushku). Her lines seem hokey now moreso than when it first aired but the meaning and the issues you see moving behind those troubled eyes and in her mannerisms are the best.  Eliza did a great job with Faith.
The love between Angel and Buffy really takes off here in that we finally see the choice that must be made.  From the moment Joyce confronts Angel about Buffy to the Sewer argument.  It's painful to watch but you can not turn away.
This si the definative Buffy season in my opinion.  This is where the show really got it's legs and power.  From here till the end of this season (Season 7) Buffy sits as one of the best shows on TV.  To bad Season 7 will more than liekly be the last.
The DVD is much more streamlined than the second season.  it doesn't go through all the animation to get from the episode choices into the episode header to play.  The features are not as abundant but the interviews with the writers and of course Joss Whedon are great although repeasted over like episodes. For instance Graduation Day part 1 and 2 have repeasted interviews.  Be this as it may, it's still good stuff.  All this for half the price of the other DVD box sets (The over priced X-Files, Farscape, ST:TNG, Babylon 5 for instance... way over priced) and a great story to boot.

The contents is really great : the image is very clear, not grainy like the previous seasons (thanks to the original recording), there are special interviews with Joss Whedon, commentaries and five great featurettes.
Concerning the package itself, it's very beautiful.
But why do i rate it with only 4 stars ?
because all the ""previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" sequences are missing, and there is no english subtitles for the featurettes (my first language is French and it's easier to understand with english subtitles...)",1044316800,3,631,4.851851851851852
1788371,5,B00006RCNX,"When Season 2 ended, Buffy(Sarah Michelle Gellar) had been kicked out of her home, accused of murder, expelled from high school, did kill her Vampire-boyfriend Angel and send him to hell, and left town with a suitcase. It was quite a year, apart from all of her regular slaying duties.
Season 3 begins with Buffy living alone and working as a waitress, far from Sunnydale. Even though she wants to be left alone and not reminded of being a Slayer or having any sort of extra powers or responsibility, she meets a homeless girl who knew of her back in Sunnydale. Buffy being Buffy ends up helping and realizing that she wants to go back home. The rest of the season is back in Sunnydale and focus around the school year. Buffy is now a Senior and will be graduating at the end of the season.
Storylines continue from earlier seasons as Angel (David Boreanz) makes a return (somehow, being in hell and all that), we see a resolution in Buffy's relationship with Angel. Willow (Alyson Hannigan) learns more about witchcraft and grows in her relationship with her werewolf boyfriend, Oz (Seth Green). While most characters developed over the course of the three seasons, Xander (Nicholas Brendan) has stayed pretty much the same, even throughout his relationship with Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter). Buffy's Watcher, Giles (Anthony Head) has a bit more to do this year and gets to break out of the stuffy Brit that he has been.
New introductions to the cast are Buffy's new watcher Wesley, a Vengeance demon Anya, and a new Slayer, Faith (Eliza Dushku). Faith has the most impact on the show, stealing every scene she is in and works as a perfect foil for Buffy. Faith is what Buffy could have been had she made the wrong choices in her life. Faith is the dark side of what a Slayer can be.
While the storylines can seem silly or dumb when written down on paper, the series turns out very strong on screen. The writing is top notch and the dialogue is fast, irreverent and funny. Buffy is a difficult show to categorize. It is a drama, science fiction/fantasy, a comedy, romance, and a musical (once). It is all of this not only during the course of the season, but during the course of a single episode. Most episodes are self contained, but they do serve to drive the overall story towards a conclusion (for each season).
The overall story for this season deals with the Mayor, who is attempting to ascend into a higher plane of existence (demon). This culminates on graduation day and ends with the school blowing up (another episode that had to be pushed back because of real life events (Columbine) affecting what may be permissible to air on television). An episode dealing with a potential school shooting was set to air just after the Columbine tragedy, and may not have aired at all. Season 3 was another stellar season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer .",1044230400,3,2853,4.651485148514851
1788372,5,B00006RCNX,"FOX brings us another season of this great series, with yet another excelent treatment of it in the boxed set (much better than the first season... though not as good as the second one).
Third season of Buffy, the vampire slayer moved further from its previous structure of mythology episodes and stand alones.
The season begins with Buffy living in L.A. and being tortured by what she did at the end of season two: kill Angel to save the world. Then, she literally descends to hell (or one of them, anyway) and rescue a bunch of lost teenagers. Meanwhile, Willow, Xander, Oz and Cordelia are filling the slayer's shoes in Sunnydale, but they don't do it very well. The episode ends with Buffy returning to her mom.
The next episode, Dead Man's Party, deals with all the issues entailed by Buffy's actions. But their confrontation is cut off by a bunch of zumbies who are guided to her house by a mask.
The story develops from there. Now that Buffy is reconciled with her friends, it is time for the new characters and villians to appear. A new potential love appears in Buffy's live: Scott Hope. A new slayer is called after Kendra's death, Faith, and she comes to Sunnydale accompanied by a really old vampire. And finally major Wilkins is introduced as the big bad of the season. When the viewer might have begun to wonder why would anyone at anytime in history build a town in a mystical g-spot, the writers reveal to us that it has all been a plan that comes from the mind of the major, who uses it as a sort of sacrificial stone for his deals with demons and other dark forces. The big thing in this season is Faith becoming evil and helping the major to prevent Buffy from ruining his final ascension.
While the mythology arc is good, some stand alones really stand out. I particularly liked The Zeppo, where we are shown Xander's point of view of the whole saving-the-world situation... in no other episode they make so much fun of theirselves as in this one.
The Wish is the first episode of the now regular character Anya... It is a what if kind of episode. Seeing Xander and Willow as vampires and Buffy as a badass tough heroin is great, not to mention the Master's reappearance and the end of the episode, when the three main characters get killed.
Doppelgangland is another winner for this season. The vampire Willow from The Wish is conjured accidentally by Anya and Willow.
Earshot may be one of the best episodes of the series to date and also the most emblematic one... just before graduation Buffy learns the hard way how troubled is every single teenager.
Lover's Walk is another great episode. Spike returns to town. This character is just perfect... just when everything was going sort of well between the scoobies and their relationships, he appears and destroys them all: Xander and Willow kiss while being kidnapped, and Cordelia and Oz see the whole thing. He points to the fact that Buffy and Angel can't kid theirselves: they are not friends, they will always love each other. So, of course, Buffy makes her choice: she cannot see Angel anymore.
The best of the myth arc can be found in one of the first episodes. In Revelations the group is about to fall appart when Xander discovers that Angel is back from hell and he is back with Buffy, and it could not be a worse time for it to happen: a new watcher is called for Faith: Ms. Post, and she is willing to lay her hands on a powerful glove for her own evil purposes. This is the episode when Faith begins to be alienated from the group, too. Her evil new watcher has destroyed her trust in the side of the ""scoobies"".
In Ammends, the question about Angel's return is answered: The first evil brought him to kill Buffy, and it is now tormenting the vampire through vissions of his victims (Jenny Calendar among them).
Finally, the Graduation Day two parter, though not better than the one ending season two, is very good: Faith is sent to kill Angel in order to divert Buffy's attention from the ascension. The only way she has to save him is to let him drink some of her blood. Season closes with a great battle between the graduating teens and the major and his vampire minions.
This season is not only very entertaining, but it also glimpses some of the most interesting twists of the plot in later seasons: like Willow's homosexuality, Anya's love for Xander, and we see for a second Harmony getting bited by a vampire. Jonathan shows his resentful and most depresed state and finally, the first [], which is nowadays having a grat role in the show.
This is a really great season... Can't wait for the other ones.",1044144000,,4597,4.546441495778046
1788373,5,B00006RCNX,"Season Three of Buffy The Vampire Slayer opens up with Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) being missing after killing Angel (David Boreanaz) and her friends trying to find her.  The first two episodes, ""Anne"" and ""Dead Man's Party"" don't really portray the power of the entire season.  ""Anne"" deals with Buffy hiding out in Los Angeles working as a waitress.  She meets Lily who was a part of a vampire worshipping cult in Sunnydale.  Buffy finds that there is a demon factory where humans are slaves and a hundred years pass for one day on Earth.  She frees the slaves and then decides to go home where the episode ends with her showing up at home.  ""Dead Man's Party"" deals with the resentment Buffy's friends feel toward her and an ancient mask her mother brought home that acts as a homing device for zombies.  The season really starts with episode three ""Faith, Hope & Trick"" in which we are introduced to yet another slayer, Faith (Eliza Dushku) and another vampire Mr. Trick (K. Todd Freeman).  Faith is a fiery slayer, who unlike Buffy, loves being a slayer.  She is all super ego to Buffy's id.  Faith will add a spark of energy to the show and push Buffy and her friends to the limit.  In the fourth episode, ""Beauty & The Beasts"", Angel is freed from hell and returns to Earth where Buffy discovers him.  Spike (James Marsters) returns to Sunnydale in ""Lover's Walk"" and we find that he has been dumped by Drusilla.  He kidnaps Willow (Allyson Hannigan) to put a love spell on Drusilla.  He also captures Xander (Nicholas Brendan) and is going to kill them. While they are trapped, they realize their mutual feelings and kiss.  While they are kissing, their respective partners, Oz (Seth Green) & Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) walk in on them.  This leads to the next episode, ""The Wish"", where Cordelia is heartbroken over Xander's & Willow's kiss that she determines that Buffy is the cause of her problems and wishes that she never came to Sunnydale.  Anyanka (Emma Caufield) a vengeance demon appears and grants Cordelia her wish.  We find an alternative Sunnydale, where, since Buffy never came to, The Master escaped from his prison and rules a vampire lead city.  We also find that Xander and Willow are vampires and Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), Oz and Larry (Larry Bagby III) are the protectors of the innocent.  This is one of the all time best Buffy episodes and it is a testament to the show's supreme writing.  Another powerful episode is ""Helpless"" where on her 18th birthday, Buffy unknowingly must survive a life threatening battle without her slayer powers.  Buffy learns of the ritual as Giles, unable to deal with the torment Buffy is going through, advises of her what is happening and that he participated in it by drugging her.  She feels betrayed and turns on Giles, but manages to survive the test.  Giles is not as fortunate as he is relieved of his duties as Buffy's Watcher by the Council as he has become too emotionally attached to her.  ""Bad Girls"" is the episode that sets up the crux of the season.  Buffy's new watcher, the stuffy Wesley Wyndham-Pryce (Alexis Denisof) is brought to train her.  Buffy rebels against him and with the prodding of Faith goes on a reckless rampage on a mission to stop a demon from getting an amulet.  While on their rampage, they rob a store for weapons and in the ultimate reckless act, Faith kills an innocent human, the mayor's deputy.  This leads to the next episode, ""Consequences"", where Buffy tries to face up to her actions, but Faith continues to believe that the law does not apply to her.  Angel steps in and tries to help Faith, but Wesley and the council capture her and are prepared to transport her to England.  Faith escapes and ends up at the door of the evil mayor, Richard Wilkins (Harry Groener), to whom she pledges her services.  The rest of the season details the gang's attempt thwart the Mayor's ascension and Buffy battling Faith.  The season ends with the excellent two parter, ""Graduation Day"" in which the gang graduates from Sunnydale High and they battle to mayor to once again save the world.  Also, in the final episode, Angel leaves Sunnydale to set out on his own.  This sets up David Boreanaz's spin off series Angel that Charisma Carpenter and Alexis Denisof also join the cast.  Season three of Buffy is the best and most consistent season of the show.  The acting is first rate especially by Ms. Dushku and Mr. Groener is wickedly funny as the mayor.  Ms. Gellar is spurred on by Ms. Dushku and provides a stellar season that was worthy of Emmy consideration as was the show as a whole.",1043971200,10,4595,4.6621118012422365
1788374,5,B00006RCNX,"Personally I considered season 3 as the best season of Buffy.
The season covers the last year of high school for the Scooby Gang before sending them to college or in the cases of Angel and Cordelia, to LA. Also we see the resolution of Buffy and Angel, Oz and Willow, Xander and Cordelia relationships.
The introduction of Faith, Mr. Trick, Wesley, Annya and the Mayor along with the return of Angel were just few of the highlights and the reason why, season 3 stands out in my mind.
I won't go into details about the episodes since other reviewers have already done so but I just want to list my favorites: Faith Hope and Trick, The Wish, Amends, Lover's Walk, The Zeppo, Enemies, Bad Girls, Doppelganger, Consequences, The Prom, Homecoming, Choices, Earshot, Graduation Day Part I and II.

I feel that season three was one of the best seasons of the show.  We see Buffy fight Faith, another slayer, graduate from high school and save the world, yet again.  We also see the sad departure of Angel, who is sadly missed on the show.  A great dvd set one can watch again and again.",1043539200,,433,3.9310344827586206
1788376,5,B00006RCNX,"Overall, I love Buffy, which means I was going to love this set. Buffy is one of the most well thought out shows on television, cleverly disguised as a bubblegum-fluff. Third season, as the show was just hitting its stride, we meet Faith and the Mayor,  two classic Big Bads who I can love to hate. Still, I can be objective. Here's what you get:
The media:
The images is very crisp and clear, an improvement over the last 2 seasons which showed their roots in the lower tech filming process. In contrast, every episode of Season 3 is sharp with amazing sound. The case is fold-out, instead of the lower quality clamshells. I would have liked to see the episode titles printed on the DVDs themselves (with their numbers) to make it that much easier to find a particular episode. Some discs have 4 eps each, some have 3, so you have to refer to the table of contents each time.
The episodes:
Season 3 is the last ""high school"" season, before Buffy and the Scoobies head off to college and the real world. As the show gained more popularity, it also expanded its budget, as is evidenced in the special effects and writing. We meet Faith, the second slayer and see her drawn over to the ""dark side"". We also see Angel and Buffy's relationship finally draw to a close, as Angel moves off to his own show for Buffy's fourth season. There are a lot of very allegorical coming-of-age episodes, where Buffy and the gang have to learn the realities of growing up, facing parent and heartbreak. This season is full of very deep, moving, thoughtful episodes.
The extras:
This is the only area in which I found the DVDs lacking, but I won't reduce my rating because I believe the season itself is a worthwhile purchase. There are fewer commentaries on this set than the previous. I felt like the producers, seeing the popularity of the previous two DVD releases, felt like they had to do less to keep the fans happy.
There is no commentary by Joss himself, which is a huge disappointment, especially considering some of the strongly allegorical storylines included in this season. In fact, the first commentary, but writer David Fury for the episode ""Helpless"" was fairly lame because it was only the second episode that he had written for the show. I think that he wrote a great episode, but I felt very much like he was second string, both in talent and in history with the show, especially compared to Joss Whedon, Marti Noxon, and David Greenwalt.
There are several featurettes, which are quite interesting. I especially liked the ""Season 3 Overview"", which showed the depth of planning for the season. There were also several interviews with Joss, but I would have liked a full length commentary by either he or one of the main actors.
The conclusion:
Yes, this is a fantastic set, as you can see by others' reviews. I give it a 5+ for content. For the special features, I'd like to see more, but I'm a Joss Whedon fan, and I expect the very best.",1043193600,6,2940,4.55765595463138

1788388,5,B00006RCNX,"Season 3 of Buffy The Vampire Slayer continues the shows trend of creating exciting television. Witty dialogue, heartfelt performances, intense drama and incredible fight sequences. While it does not top the dramatic intensity of Season 2, Season 3 is one of the best seasons of the series. Only a few episodes aren't worth watching over and over again, such as the disappointing season opener Anne and the boring Band Candy. Other than those 2 episodes each episode is either thrilling, hysterical, and intesnse. Best episodes include The Wish, where Cordelia wishes Buffy never came to Sunnydale and introduces us one of the series best characters Anya. Dopplegangland is hysterical as Willow casts a spell and Vamp Willow comes to Sunnydale. Then there is the introduction of Faith, played the incredible Elisa Dushku. The intense new slayer who turns againts Buffy and her friends to end the world. The scenes between Buffy and Faith in such episodes as Bad Girls, Consequences, and Enemies are classic. This is also the season where the continuity is perfect. Season 3 shows us things to come in future seasons leading all the way up to Season 7. This is where we first hear about Willows lesbianism and The First (Amends). The one thing that makes this show worth watching is the acting from the incredibly talented cast. Charisma Carpenter remains just as caddy and sarcastic this season, but this is the season where we all grew to love Cordy. Nicholas Brennan is hysterical as always as Xander, but finally brings some drama and intensity to his role this year. Alyson Hannigan starts dabbling in more witchcraft, and her Vamp Willow is hsyterical. One of the most charming and likebale actresses in television today. Then there is Ms. Sarah Michelle Gellar who holds the show together with her witty delivery, her passion for Angel. and bad girl tendencies this year. A gifted actress who perfectly does comedy and drama and should have had won an Emmy for her work in Such eps as Earshot and Graduation Day Pt 2.
One of the best moments of television comes in Season 3 in Grad day Pt 2, mainly because of the performances by Sarha and David Boreanaz. I can go on and on about how incredible this show is, but I'll just leave it at watch it! You won't regret it. The best show on television.",1042934400,,2301,4.78391959798995

This was a great Season for the show, with a lot of surprises, and some major changes.  It also has some of the funniest episodes for Xanders.  And some of the most heartfelt moments for all the cast.  I have to say that I just don't get tired of it.  And it's a good thing I don't, now that I own all three seasons on DVD.  I said to my wife, ""What am I going to do?  The next season won't come out for three months.  I'll be done in two more days.""  Her response, ""Well, then you just go back to the beginning, and watch it all again.""

1788393,4,B00006RCNX,"Like many Buffy fans, I consider season 3 to be a high point for the show (unlike many, I like every season, including 4 and 6).  This DVD was a welcome addition to my collection, but it leaves one thing to be desired: no episode commentary by Joss himself.  Don't get me wrong, there is some good commentary by other regulars (Espenson, Petrie), and there are Joss Whedon interviews.  But nothing takes the place of Joss's commentary, and the lack thereof is what took off the last star for me.  And there is commentary on Consequences by one of the directors, which may be interesting to some people, but there is only so long I can listen to someone talking about blocking!
Overall, Buffy fans must own, but I hope future seasons have better special features.",1042502400,,762,4.580882352941177
1788394,5,B00006RCNX,"The fact that there are 104 5 star reviews in only a few short days speaks a lot about this DVD set.
Season 3 is great.  It's one of, if not the best, season of the series.  I was a little disappointed with the DVD layout and extra features on this set.
The layout for each DVD has 4 episodes on it, but unless you have the episode title order memorized, or are looking at the printed table of contents, you have to guess at which one comes next.  I would have liked to have seen an episode number instead of the funky symbol that they used by each episode title.
Personally I look forward to DVD sets for the extra features that simply recording the reruns doesn't give me. The extra features on this DVD set left me wanting more, like some behind the scenes chat with some (OK any!), of the shows actors or Joss Whedon.  If you are into fashion, there is a wonderful bit with the costume designer.  There is some interesting stuff with the props man and the CG artists.  But nothing with any of the actors.  Throw me a bone WB, get me some off camera face time with the cast!",1042416000,,1077,4.173913043478261
1788395,5,B00006RCNX,"I now own all 3 seasons on dvd, and this one looks like it could be the best.  Season 3 is the best season in the series. The creators are brilliant, and I wish they made commentaries for every episode. The complaints about the ""grainy"" quality are from people who aren't aware that the first few seasons were shot on 16mm film.  Believe me, you get so wrapped up in what's going on, it's hard to notice the few scenes that do appear this way.  Season 3 brings out the best and worst in every character, and the villians are the greatest... especially the mayor and Faith.

1788396,5,B00006RCNX,"I've been a fan of Buffy since it's season premiere in 97'.  The suspense and action sucks you in and won't let go. The actors and actresses are amazing, yet in Season's One and Two one thing was missing.  I judge a show on it's abilty to hit all my emotional levels: From rolling on the floor laughing, to edge of the seat suspense, to grab a tissue depressing.  Season Three finally gave me all these emotions, many in a one episode period. The pinnacle of this emotion in season three, seems to come in the tear jerker episode, ""The Prom"" where Angel breaks off his and Buffy's relationship, leaving Buffy shattered and heartbroken.  In the scene after he breaks up with her, Buffy and Willow are sharing a moment in Buffy's room, where Willow tries to be the good friend only to have Buffy confess her shattered spirit and have an emotional breakdown in Willows arms.  I was crying like a baby.  Many other episodes gave me different feelings.  From the suspense in ""Helpless"", to laughing my ... off in ""Doppelgangland.""  Also in this season some of our charactors get their own special episodes.  Cordelia in ""The Wish"", Xander in ""The Zeppo"" and Willow in the afformentioned ""Doppelgangland.""  All in all Season Three is by fall the greatest of all the seasons, with one heck of a big bang ending! Get it now and be witness to one of the most original shows ever created! (P.S. Season 4 is slated for June of 2003)",1042416000,,1421,4.537254901960784
1788397,5,B00006RCNX,"I am an avid Buffy fan - and this is a great season to see again and again.  This DVD set is well worth the low cost.
To answer teamparadox's comments concerning the ""grainy"" look to the episodes on Seasons 1 & 2:  Buffy made it's premiere as a midseason replacement and (back then) wasn't as prominent in TVLand - so saving money was a top priority.  The show was originally filmed in 9mm rather than 35mm, since 9mm is much lower in price compared to 35.  The 9mm causes an obvious graininess in the picture.  I rather like the look - it adds a certain 'film noire' feeling to the first few seasons:)",1042416000,2,602,4.245614035087719

I would recommend this dvd for existing fans of Buffy and for those who just want to test the water :-)",1042416000,,318,3.8923076923076922
1788399,5,B00006RCNX,"The third season of Buffy marked the beginning of a new change for the Scooby gang. Picking up where the second season left off, Buffy is living in the big city of L.A. (""Anne"") where she, along with a homeless teen, fights an evil demon who enslaves humans in the demon dimension. Then Buffy returns to her roots (""Dead Man's Party), where an irate Joyce, Giles, and the Scooby Gang confront her about her running away from Sunnydale. The best part of the season was the new addition of Faith, a rogue Slayer who at first developed a deep, close relationship with Buffy until the evil Mayor (Harry Groener) turns her to the dark side. This season also marked the return of a Drusilla-less Spike (James Marsters), Angel (David Boreanaz), and Amy the Witch, and the additions of the mysterious Mr. Trick, the demonic Anyanka (Emma Caulfield), and the charismatic Mayor. This season also introduces Wesley Wyndham-Price, Buffy's new Watcher after Giles was terminated from his services from the Watcher Council. The season finale also marked the departure of Angel (who went on to form Angel Investigations in <i>Angel</i>) and Cordelia who joined him as she left for L.A. to become an actress.
This 6-disc set contains all 22 episodes of the season. One of the best episodes is ""The Wish,"" in which Cordelia wishes that Bush had never come to Sunnydale, which resulted her being transported to an alternate reality where vampires have overtaken the town, and the Master (Mark Metgalf) is still alive. This episode also features the vampiric counterparts of Xander and Willow, who end up being staked to death in the end. Another excellent episode is ""Dopplegangland,"" in which Anya turns to Willow for help with a spell, which inadvertenely summons the Evil Willow from the alternate reality.
The menus in this set are outstanding and easy to use. This set contains five featurettes, selected episode scripts and commentaries, and has language tracks in French, Spanish, and English. This set is a must-have for true Buffy fans!!!!",1042329600,3,2030,4.956011730205279
1788400,5,B00006RCNX,"I hadn't seen all of BtVS Season 3, so I had to snap up this release right away.  I have to say it's lived up to all my expectations!  Over the years, I've marvelled repeatedly at the creative minds behind this series, and never moreso after seeing this collection.  My favorite episode?  Even though it doesn't do a lot to advance the season's storyline, I absolutely love ""Lover's Walk.""  James Marsters is both riveting and hilarious as Spike, and I can easily see why they brought him on as a regular in Season 4.  The closing shot of Spike driving off with the intention of torturing Dru until she likes him again, belting out the Sex Pistols version of ""My Way,"" is alone worth the price of the entire boxed set!
One other thing--every episode of ""Buffy"" is crafted like a mini-movie, with layer upon layer of nuanced richness.  Now in its seventh season, the show has built up such a comprehensive mythology that a new fan will probably miss out on a significant portion of each episode's impact.  Whether you've never seen them, or not seen them in years, viewing ""Buffy's"" earlier episodes will give you new insight as to why many critics and viewers alike consider ""Buffy"" the best show on television today.",1042243200,,1217,4.627906976744186
1788401,5,B00006RCNX,"BTVS season 3 is the only reason why I'm a crazed fan of this great tv series in the first place. In this season we don't only get to see one slayer fight the living dead but 2 slayers instead! Eliza Dushku ( Faith ) is one of the best reasons to buy this DVD collection. Faith was born to a family that cared little about her. Her father appeared to have left home when she was young and her mother was often drunk and passing out. All Faith wanted as a child was a puppy and some toys but she never got them. Faith's mother often called her a litlle firecracker.
Sometime during her childhood, Faiths mother died, leaving Faith on her own in her hometown of Boston. Some time later, she was called as a slayer after the death of Kendra. During her first few months as a slayer, Faith witnessed the death of her female watcher by the vampire.... Well that's all we have for today folks! All in all this DVD is HOT!",1042243200,,915,4.175141242937853
1788402,5,B00006RCNX,"Season three is by far the best Season for Buffy.  So many exciting things happened that you could swear it was at least two seasons rolled into one.  I LOVE Faith...she brought plenty of action on to the screne with her.  I wish she didn't go all evil and all.  I've heard she'll be back this season, I hope so.  I can't wait for season 4 either...that was another good season but it didn't have as much action as season 3.",1042156800,,424,4.185185185185185
1788403,5,B00006RCNX,"I have been waiting since June for season three to be released, as I'm sure many Buffy fans have. This season is an amazing season, and it's so surreal to own every single episode. The best episodes are ""Anne"", ""The Wish"", ""Dopplegangland"", ""Enemies"", ""Earshot"", ""Choices"", ""Consequences"", ""The Prom"", and the two part season finale ""Graduation Day."" Every episode is a gem though, building the suspense up higher and higher until the final showdown. All the characters mature alot more, help alot more, and Faith is the bad slayer that you just love to hate. The Faith storyline is amazing, and it will leave you wanting more. The picture quality and sound is awesome, and the special features are sweet bonuses. Selected episode commentaries are a treat, as well as the five informative featurettes. The DVD menu is really cool too. So get this today, if you didn't get it the first day it came out like me. And don't forget, this June, the fourth season will hit shelves...where Buffy and the gang head for college, Faith wakes up from her coma, Buffy meets Riley, and Willow falls in love with Tara.",1042070400,6,1103,4.780104712041885
1788404,5,B00006RCNX,"After a gut-wrenching Season 2 finale, Season 3 had some large shoes to fill; believe me when I say that S3's feet are freakin' huge.
The strength of S3 was in the consistency as much as the acting and writing (which were both extremely good). As recent seasons of BtVS have illustrated, the fluctuation between quality episodes and miserable drudgery can be severe. That is not the case with S3, as the cast and crew deliver deft performances time and again.
Standout eps include ""The Wish"", ""Doppelgangland"", ""Bad Girls"", and ""The Prom"". This last episode was most notable for the public recognition of Buffy's heroic role by the student body; the senior class presents her with a glittery umbrella award naming her Class Protector. Though the award scene could be a throwaway moment, it shows the depth and complexity of BtVS beautifully. The assumption up to this point was that the majority of Sunnydale residents were unaware they lived on the Hellmouth; suddenly their ""ignorance"" of Buffy and the Scoobies' work was transformed into much more human and understandable rationalization. Brilliant.
Check out Season 3 and see just how great television can be.",1042070400,,1164,5.036269430051814
1788405,5,B00006RCNX,"What can I say. I am giving season 3 a five stars which gives this DVD set that same rating. Extras are wonderful, but even without them, this DVD would get a 5 star rating.
I was of the mind that season 2 was the best. It might be in many respects, but this season completes the Buffy/Angel story-line arc and brings a sad but satisfying end to their relationship and only makes the show that much better in the long run. In other words, this is probably the BEST season yet.
More high-school teenager drama will be thrust at you, along with the humor, tension and action that accompanies most Buffy seasons. Season 4 was pretty good, but some of the underground secret army ideas was a little too much, but man, you can't beat Hush! Season 5 had some excellent episodes, with The Body being one that really leaves you num when it's over. In some respects, season 5 was better than 4. Season 6 was okay, but I thought it just got a little too silly. But, after watching it again on FX, I can say that it actually wasn't that bad now that I know exactly what was going on. And many things come back to haunt not only Buffy, but Xander as well, especially his lying to Buffy about Angel in season 2, which resulted in the death of Angel and almost the end of the world. Season 7 is shaping up to be another excellent season.
But, back to season 3, the problem the gang faces now is where do they go? Graduation is coming up this year, and oh boy. It's going to be one Hell of a graduation, and Hell is the operative word here.
Buffy's Mom has to come to grips with her daughter being the slayer and she does to a point. Buffy has some competition when Faith shows up. I mean, we see Buffy actually getting JEALOUS when the Scoobs start talking with Faith when she first shows up. Pretty funny stuff. Buffy once again is the outsider, if only for a brief moment. But again, the trials and tribulations of someone possibly cooler and more popular than you comes into play and Buffy has to deal with it 5 by 5 as Faith would say.
Finally, in this season, we are introduced to the Counsel in body (we already knew about them in speak). We learn that they can be just as evil as that which spawns from the Hellmouth in the episoide ""Helpless"" in which Buffy loses her Slayer powers, with a little help from Giles. It brings home the father/daughter relationship that they have between each other, but it finally hits home for the both of them. So much so, that Giles loses his job for going against the Counsel to try and save Buffy. Of course, when Buffy's Mom get's inadvertantly involved (and not of her own free will mind you), it really sets things in motion where Buffy realises that soon, she may to have start taking matters into her own hands and forget the Counsel.
The interference of the Counsel doesn't stop there. Wesley shows up as the new watcher for Buffy and Faith. Of course, Giles and Buffy have their own ideas on how things should be run. Wesley brings in the ""rookie"" aspect of being a watcher, and it's hilarious how Cordelia is taken in by the English accent and manner of Wesley. But, that falls apart in a very humorous fashion later in the season. Who would have guessed these two would hook up again in Angel's series?
In the Prom episode, all her hard work is finally rewarded. She learns that, even though she tried to keep her Slayer job a secret from everyone outside the Scooby gang, the students, even though most would not say a thing to her or even glance in her direction (except to say, ""Wow. There's that freaky girl!""), they knew something was special about her. In a world where kids were shooting each other up (very eerie since this season came out at the same time the Columbine shootings occured), the students at Sunnydale knew wierd things happened. But, Buffy always seemed to be there, saving them from harm and allowing them to live their lives, and for that, they thanked her and recognized her ""achievements"" at Sunnydale. An excellent episode and Buffy get's her just dues that she has worked so thanklessly for.
Everything in a person's highschool years is depicted in shockingly realistic manners. The monsters in many respects signify the problems and hidden fears that highschool kids face. This is really brought to the front in Earshot where Buffy gains the ability to hear people's thoughts. This was another show that was held back due to the awful shootings in Columbine, but it really drives home the point that highschool kids DO have problems, no matter how trivial they may seem to adults and that even the popular ones have problems. It's just that many of them are better at hiding their pain.
The main theme in all of the episodes hits home: not being the most popular student in school, hanging out with the ""nerds of the school, your parents embarrasing you (Band Candy was HILARIOUS), the trials and tribulations of love that you have, that you want and that you can't have (Willow/Oz, Xander/Cordelia, Buffy/Angel, Xander/Willow, Giles/Joyce! EEK!), ridicule from other more popular students to the point it drives you to almost do things that you normally wouldn't.
Get it. Man, after reading my OWN review I think I have come to the conclusion that this IS the best BtVS season yet!",1042070400,,5252,4.5062893081761
1788416,4,B00006RCNX,"Well first up to explain the title. There is a flyer inside the Season Three DVD pack that lists June 2003 as the release date for BtVS- Season Four - they really should release these seasons more frequently, because even with Angel's first season coming out in February, there's still five to six months until the next one.
I think that BtVS - Season Three is the most consistently enjoyable seasons of the show. It also introduces the incredble Faith, who clearly represents Buffy's dark side. In addition to this there is also the first introduction to current Scooby gang regular Anya - who I have always had a soft spot for.
The inclusion of scripts is a nice addition, but I would have liked to have seen more commentarues from Joss Whedon. It also strikes me that the DVD menu's for this season are less animated than the previous season. Not sure why this is the case??
With all 22 episodes over six discs, do yourself a favor and pick up this DVD set. I highly recommend it.",1041984000,8,983,4.4972067039106145

The story line of this season is great, along with imporved special effects, and all the crazy action and humor we have come to expect.  My only problem lies in the dvd itself, the transfer like season 1 and 2 is bad,i its very grainy, and the picture looks slightly muffled, of course this problem never occurs during BRIGHT outdoor scenes, but most indoor, and every low light scene this shows up in a bad way, its not bad enough to want to skip a purchase, but it is bad enough to mention, and its the only, and i repeat ONLY reason i didn't give this box set 5 stars.",1041984000,7,800,3.9627329192546585
1788418,5,B00006RCNX,"OK.. Let me tell you that I have seen every single episode of Buffy made and to this day I have to say that the third season is the best! In this season we see a lot of great things.. the renewal and loss of Buffy and Angel's love, the departure of Angel, Willow and her developing witchcraft,the falling of Xander and Cordy's relationship and the return of Spike. But most importantly we meet Faith, the other slayer, called to duty after the death of Kendra. There are a lot of amazing fight sequences in this season, espiacally between Buffy and Faith, as their personalities clash. This season is very well done, and in my opinion is the best.
Some of the better episodes include,""Earshot"" in which Buffy is stung by a demon and can hear the thoughts of others. "" Enemies"" when Faith and Buffy really go head to head over Angel. ""The Prom"" is a tearjerker. ""Graduation Day PT 1 and 2"" are also excellent season finales. This is the season when Buffy's character really develops and the rest of the character's also become more vivid and lifelike. This is also the beginning of the show's sexual nature, in which the character's begin to grow and their relationships become more complex.  I would say if you are not a huge Buffy fan, watch this DVD and you'll be hooked!!",1041811200,,1274,4.515151515151516
1788419,5,B00006RCNX,"In Season 3 of Buffy The Vampire Slayer, the show begins with our favorite slayer in another town. She has run away after having to kill her vampire-with-a-soul-who-lost-his-soul boyfriend Angel who had plans of killing her and everyone she cared for. Rightfully unstable, Buffy hides under a new alias and keeps herself tucked away from those she loves, afraid that her very existence would bring them all nothing but heartache.
Once again this very first episode sets the tone for the rest of the season. A season that's just as much about reflection as it is about drawing strength from yourself. All of our favorite characters are seen and heard more in these episodes than any others.
Xander and Cordelia continuously struggle to make their relationship work. A relationship that Cordelia never 100% feels ok with until the mid/end of the season, just about the time when Xander's eyes start to wander and he shares a ""moment"" with Willow.
Willow is with Oz and they're just the cutest couple. Defining moments for them come when Willow falls back on an old habit (Xander) and when the couple decide it's time for them to take their relationship to the next level. Willow becomes more involved in witchcraft this season as it proves to be a helpful source now, but a much deadlier one in future seasons.
Buffy is dealing with the loss of Angel as well as dealing with a fed up mother who's tired of losing control of her daughter. A moment comes earlier in the season when Angel returns from hell with the help of a spell from Willow. Angel clings to Buffy as a lifeline and the past comes rushing back; tugging at our hearts just as much as it tugs at their's.
Buffy tries to embrace Faith, the new slayer who strolls into town after Kenda's death. The two make for good pals until the dark side grabs a hold of Faith. Faith tries to set traps for Buffy and introduces her to her sadistic life of slaying with no responsibility and no remorse. When Buffy realizes that Faith can't be trusted and is more dangerous than helpful, it's once again up to Buffy to save the day.
Meanwhile, Sunnydale's new mayor known as ""The Mayor"" has other intentions in mind for Buffy and co. as he sets his trap to kill everyone in town. As his and Faith's plans go awry, they team up together to bring Buffy down once and for all.
New characters this season include Faith, The Mayor, Trick and others. Also visiting is vengence demon Anyanka best knows as Anya in later seasons.
The standout episode of this season and all other seasons in my opinion is the Christmas episode.
After such heartbreak in Season 2 and an inevitable one in Season 3, Buffy keeps on fighting for what she believes in. She's the heroine who's never credited, but in this season, more than any other, Buffy recieves the praise that she deserves.
With Angel and Cordelia exiting the show and Sunnydale High and it's principal meeting a most unfortunate demise, this season could have been the end of the show and that would have been alright with me.
The show seems to go down hill from here. Not that I'm saying season 4-7 aren't great, it's just not as spectacular as seasons 1-3. Such a satisfying conclusion as them graduating would have made for the perfect ending for Buffy and her friends, but life goes on as it must.",1041724800,4,3289,4.595238095238095
1788420,5,B00006RCNX,"Well, the third season of Buffy is definately the best and these DVD's are amazing. No true Buffy fan should be without them. They are a must. The first two season's box sets were great, I'll admit, but the third season is extraordinary. With great episodes from Anne to Graduation Day keeping you enclosed until the last breath-taking minute. It's so exciting and well plotted. And, don't forget the wonderful acting by the amazing cast of the show. Sarah Michelle Gellar, David Boreanaz, Nicholas Brendon, Alyson Hannigan, Eliza Dushku, Seth Green....and the list goes on.

1788422,5,B00006RCNX,"Joss Whedon solved a major problem in Season Two of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" in terms of how he resolved the tortured love of Buffy and Angel.  Many a good television series went down the tubes because one the sexual tension between the two lovers was consummated, there was nowhere to go but down (classic case in point: Dave and Maddie on ""Moonlight"").  However, Whedon's masterstroke was that after Angel gave Buffy her birthday present, their relationship went down like no other relationship we had ever seen (not even Sid and Nancy) as Angel turned into Angelus.  The season finale, ""Becoming: Part II,"" is still one of the 10 best television episodes I have ever seen.  The new problem facing Joss Whedon was: How do you top this in Season Three?
In one sense he does not.  ""Becoming"" remains the Mt. Everest of the series, a height that can never be scaled again, no matter how many times Buffy's gift of ""death"" plays to her advantage.  However, what makes Season Three better than Season Two is not that the top is higher, but rather than this is also true of the bottom.  Pick the worst episode from Season Three (my choice is the obvious pick, ""Beauty and the Beasts"") and it is still better than the worst of the first two seasons (e.g., ""Teacher's Pet,"" ""Go Fish"").  Look at all 22 episodes and you should end up being convinced that this was clearly the show's best season.
By now there is clearly an extremely effective pattern to a season of ""BtVS"" as crafted by Whedon.  The first episode, ""Anne,"" reminds Buffy of why she is the slayer (i.e., function as a way of getting late comers to the party up to speed on the Slayer).  Again the season is divided into two halves, the first focusing on Faith (""Faith, Hope & Trick"") and the second on the Mayor's Ascension (""Graduation Day"").  Like the previous season, the part of the first half (Spike & Dru) joins the party of the second half (Angelus), just like Faith joins forces with the Mayor.  Consequently, a season of ""BtVS"" has a sense of overall narrative structure more developed than most television dramas.  What also matters is that Whedon finds the actors to play the parts.  Eliza Dushku makes Faith a ticking time bomb who represents the Dark Side of being a Slayer (not to mention being as far removed from Kendra as possible), while Harry Groener as Mayor Richard Wilkins III takes the traditional politeness of a villain to a new level of giddy charm.
The final element, which best defines the uniqueness of Season Three, is that arguably the very best episodes were actually those that did NOT have to do with the major plot threads.  There are two fun return visits as Sunnydale is afflicted by another visit from Ethan Raine in ""Band Candy"" and comes back to kidnap Willow for some witchy help in winning back Dru's love.  Fortunately we did not have to wait for Season Four for a visit to ""Doppelgangland"" after our first taste of the alternative Buffyverse in ""The Wish.""  I was always surprised Whedon did not release those two on a videotape as an addendum to the Season Three Videotape set (double ditto for ""Once More, With Feeling"").  However, after the Senior gift given to Buffy at ""The Prom,"" the no holds barred fight between Buffy and Faith in ""Graduation Day, Part I"" and Buffy letting Angel feed on her in ""Graduation Day, Part II,"" the Mayor's actual Ascension seems rather anti-climatic.
Buffy supporting cast fares very well in Season Three.  ""Amends,"" the episode submitted for Emmy consideration, gives Buffy and Angel some of their best final scenes together as star crossed lovers while Xander finally has a moment of glory in ""The Zeppo"" (I find the background apocalypse scenes hysterical and love the fact the Zeppo reference is never explained in the episode at all).  Cordy makes her own case for being a Slayer in ""Homecoming,"" Giles touches on new meanings of his role as Buffy's father-figure in ""Band Candy"" and ""Helpless,"" and the only thing more fun than watching Alyson Hannigan play Vamp Willow in ""The Wish"" was watching her play Willow playing Vamp Willow in ""Dopplegangland.""
""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" received a lot of unwanted publicity during the spring of 1999 when two episodes--""Earshot"" and ""Graduation Day, Part Two""--were pulled from being aired because of the shootings at Columbine High School.  Ultimately, these proved to be overreactions, but certainly Whedon and the show were fortunate that Columbine happened the week before ""Earshot"" and not the week afterwards, because I really do not know if ""BtVS"" would have been able to survive that realignment of events.  On balance and from the perspective of the middle of Season Seven, I think Season Three will ultimately be considered the best season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""",1041379200,37,4770,4.791463414634146
1788423,5,B00006RCNX,"First of all, i have loved Buffy ever since it's first episode! I love shows like it (Charmed and Buffy are my RELIGIONS basically)! I loved Season 1, but it now seems really small in plot compared to the other seasons. I am next going to have a dramatic interpretation of what Joss thought while making the first 3 seasons of Buffy:
1: ""Let's try this idea out and have some cool stuff!""
2: ""Ok, now let's throw THIS at them and see what they do!""
3: ""Last season worked this season I am going all out!""
In season 3 i think Joss really showed us some amazing talent in both the actors and the writing.
At first, we start off with Buffy slowly coming home (after kicking a hell demension king's a$$). Then we are settling in and then BAM! who is this second slayer? FAITH! Then we have a meaningless to the shows plot, but still amazing episode in which SLAYERFEST 99' happens (""Homecoming""). After that emotions basically say ""Kick it up a notch!"" everyone shows who they are, especially Faith, but Buffy and Angel realize their love won't work, Anya comes around settling in as a human... Also, just a side note, this season is home of my FAVORITE episode called ""Earshot"" it is an AMAZING episode that really shows what was and is still going on in the world! The season ends with an amazing two part ending truly showing a GRADUATION of the characters... PS: Who could miss a season when Cordelia pretends she's a badass and scares a vamp, Giles and Joyce have sex...twice, evil Willow in tight leather, good Willow in tight leather, Buffy has no super powers, Faith gives Xander his first ""ya know"", Buffy kicks a lunchlady's a$$, and a Slayer-vs-Slayer fight (who will win?)? I wouldn't miss it for the world (which by the way, Buffy saves ...again!)",1041120000,,1756,4.5251572327044025
1788424,5,B00006RCNX,"This is by far the best Buffy season ever.  Until season 7 (this year) every season since this has been sub-par, and before season 3, the show didn't really get into an amazingly smooth groove.  With Buffy finally coming home to Sunnydale, when Angel comes back from the dead, when Faith shows up, Spike's episode, the evil mayor, and so much more, this is the season not to miss.  I have taped every episode, and have watched this season's tapes so many times that some of them have difficulty playing.  Season 3 shows why Buffy is the most innovative and by far the best show on television. In the words of Spike ""It's not brains children, it's blood.  Blood screaming inside of you to work it's will...""  Anyone who doesn't feel their blood screaming for Buffy season 3 must be dead already.  Buy it, it rules.",1040342400,12,813,4.527397260273973
1788425,5,B00006RCNX,"After a very powerful second season, Buffy and the Scooby Gang entered its third one facing their toughest challenge yet: senior year. As if that wasn't bad enough, they also had an evil mayor and a baaad second slayer, Faith, to deal with. While maybe not as good as season two, season three showed that Buffy was just getting stronger with age - and more mature. This was actually a very pivotal season for many reasons: it introduced future regular Anya (""The Wish"") while saying good-bye to Angel and Cordelia (who had bigger fish to fry in L.A., with their very own spinoff, ""Angel""). The introduction of Faith was important, too, and we learned that two slayers are NOT better than one. Xander and Willow had Cordelia/Oz problems, due to the best friends' developing sexual tension; Buffy still had Angel problems (is he good again? is he bad again?); and all of Sunnydale had mayor problems - in the form of a really big...snake? Luckily, season three wasn't as sappy as season two with the whole Buffy/Angel relationship. The whole tortured, star-crossed lovers thing was cute for a while but after a few episodes, it was a little hard to swallow (I don't care how good he is now - the fact that he has killed possibly hundreds and hundreds of people in his 200-some-odd years on earth is a REALLY big red flag). But anyway, this season was great. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD. I own the other two seasons, and am very pleased with them. It's true, as one viewer points out, that you can tape these episodes off the TV for a couple of bucks [price of the blank VCR tape], but if you are a die-hard Buffy fan, you may be in for multiple viewings, and DVDs never wear out. Thank God for technology, huh? And thank God for Joss Whedon - this man knows how to make a show.",1040256000,9,1786,4.448170731707317
1788446,5,B00006RCNX,"My favorite season is still number 2, but the 3rd season is a strong competitor for that top spot. The soap opera aspect continues as the third season opens and Buffy is dealing with the pain of having to kill her boyfriend, Angel. Obviously, we see that Angel is resurrected but the consequences of loving him are still the same. New villains are introduced like the Mayor and a new slayer comes to town, Faith, who eventually turns into a villain. You'll also get to see an alternative universe where Willow and Xander are vampires. You'll see Joyce, Giles and Principal Snyder turned into reckless teenagers (Emotionally). The popular character of Anya is introduced as well and this will also be Cordelia and Angel's last full season with the scooby gang. (season 4 has a couple crossover episodes with the series ""Angel"" where they are reunited and a brief crossover in season 5). Also, a new watcher comes to town, Wesley...which would be his only season on Buffy (he eventually came back and joined the Angel cast in mid season one of the Angel series).

1788448,5,B00006RCNX,"Season Three of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" (BtVS), for me and many other fans, was the high point of the series to date (though the current-and-final seventh season may yet manage to outdo it). There are several reasons for this:
1.) It featured BtVS's most memorable villains, the rogue Slayer Faith and the enigmatic Mayor Wilkins, and wove them into an ongoing story arc that remains the most compelling in the history of the series.
2.) It featured some of the best character development in a series that has distinguished itself by strong character development. Buffy, Angel, Giles, Willow, Xander, Oz, Faith, and even Cordelia are explored in captivating detail. This is one season when everybody got their chance to shine.
3.) The intensity of emotion that runs through this season is remarkable and often gut-wrenching. Part of the reason everyone gets a chance to shine is that everyone is put through the wringer. Episodes like ""Dead Man's Party"", ""Beauty and the Beasts"", ""Lover's Walk"", ""Amends"", and ""Enemies"" grab hold of your heart and twist it mercilessly, as the characters live out their all-too-believable suffering on screen. Few shows have so many actors who are so good at conveying emotion as the BtVS cast, and their performances in this season were phenomenal.
4.) Oz rocks! The guitarist who won Willow's heart in Season 2 really comes into his own as one of the Scoobies in Season 3. Which is a good thing, because about half a dozen episodes into Season 4 he's gone for good. :(  Enjoy the unique, delightful humor of the Scooby Gang's resident werewolf while he lasts.
5.) Faith rocks, too, but she's been reviewed in detail elsewhere, so I won't waste space here.
6.) The Big Finish. The two-part ""Graduation"" is one of the best, most satisfying season finales in Buffy history; only the season 6 finale ""Two to Go""/""Grave"" has come close to matching it. Watching the way our heroes deal with their private fears and personal issues while preparing for Armageddon is just flat-out great television, and the climactic battle is unmatched by any other fight in the history of the Buffy-verse.
Consistently strong from beginning to end, Season 3 currently stands at the pinnacle of achievement in the annals of Joss Whedon's cult-hit creation. A must-have for every Buffy fan!",1039996800,31,2303,4.9509043927648575
1788449,5,B00006RCNX,"While last season's musical episode, ""Once More With Feeling"", has to be the best Buffy episode bar none. As a whole season and story arc, season three with the introduction of Faith and the Mayor is the most complete, well written and just enthralling television. (Joss should have submitted Graduation Day for review.) I can see the time... begin once this set is released because watching all the episodes back to back to back without commercials is going to kill productivity for me.

1788451,4,B00006RCNX,"I've always liked this series, third season is no exception, with the generally good writing, interesting plots and characters, even the sometimes peculiar humor. The third season introduces Faith as the slayer called to duty after Kendra was killed by Drusilla. She comes to Sunnydale after her watcher is killed and is seen to be totally unlike Buffy. I thought Eliza Dushku did a wonderful portrayal as a slayer from the wrong side of town, but she was so badly used in this season. In some episodes Faith isn't even mentioned, in others she wants to be good, or sometimes bad,later on she chucks the good part for good and joins forces with evil demon/Mayor Wilkins. I can't remeber the name of the episode where the woman watcher comes to town and uses Faith in her quest to get that weapon, but it is one of the better episodes. Later on in another episode Faith poisons Angel to help the mayor, since slayer blood is an antidote Buffy decides to contribute some, Faith's. Their battle is one of the best fights I've seen in the entire series and the way Faith survives Buffy's knife wound and the fall from the building into the truck bed is a great testimony to the strength of a slayer (even if she does end up in a coma that lasts into 4th season)There's a lot of good stuff here, add it to your collection.",1038182400,8,1317,4.491666666666666

Many of the characters had their beginnings here, including of Course Faith, her watcher Wesley (who later becomes a rogue demon hunter in the Angel series) and the gradual re-working of Cordelia, again setting her up for Angel. Of course, with them setting up to work out Cordelia, they had to introduce Anya, the vengeance demon who gets trapped in our reality after she abuses her powers.

Anyway, based on the region 2 set I have, I thought the featurettes and commentaries weren't as good as what came with season 2.  Also, I thought the episodes were a bit better in season 2.  But don't get me wrong, season 3 was nearly as good.  I'd say that in the first few episodes of season 3 I was a little disappointed, but when the Faith story line got going strong, it got better.

Perhaps the only ""dud"" would be the second episode, ""Dead Man's Party"", though that episode had quite a few memorable moments as well.  A HIGHLY recommended buy! (especially on Amazon.com...this retails at around 50-60 dollars, depending on where you shop for DVDs)",1037059200,8,776,4.938461538461539
1788455,5,B00006RCNX,"I think this season is a great season!  This has some powerful & exciting episodes such as ""Band Candy"" and ""The Wish"".  These are two of my all time favorite episodes.  In ""Faith, Hope & Trick"" we see Faith, the replacement slayer for Kendra and later on in the season we meet Buffy's goofy 2nd Watcher, Wesley Wyndam-Price who later on in the Buffyverse becomes a powerful and much needed character.  We also get to see Sunydale's talked about but never seen before mayor for the first time in ""Homecoming"" and in ""The Wish"" we see Anya for the 1st time.  In ""The Zeppo"" Xander gets to loose his virginity to the very sexy Faith.  All in all there are some great episodes in this season and some great moments.  Oh, and let us not forget that we get to see Principal Snyder get eaten by a giant snake!  Wow, what a season!  Don't miss out on this one.",1036800000,4,853,4.314465408805032
1788466,4,B00006RCNX,"Whedon & Co. faced quite a challenge at the beginning of Buffy's third season. Season Two ends with our heroine running away to LA after being expelled from school, getting kicked out by her mother and sending her newly restored boyfriend whom she thinks most of her friends hate to hell, presumably forever. It was arguably the best season of Buffy ever, and while I don't believe that Season Three is as good as its predecessor, it still manages to do quite well for itself. Harry Groener as Mayor Wilkins makes a very enjoyable Big Bad, and I think that the final Faith and Buffy fight scene is, hands-down, the best, most intense ever seen on BUFFY.
The extras on this are pretty swell, too. There are lots of featurettes (including one on ""Buffy Speak"" that is adorable), and there are plenty of commentary tracks for those of you who like to listen to the minds behind the Buffyverse. We get to hear from longtime writers David Fury (""Helpless""), Doug Petrie (""Bad Girls"" - the most interesting and amusing of the commentary tracks), director Michael Gershman (""Consequences""), and Jane Espenson (""Earshot""). Unfortunately, the only Joss we get is in the featurettes. For a normal person that might be okay, but I'm a big Joss freak. I could listen to him talk until the cows came home and then make the cows listen, but not everyone is me. If you enjoy BUFFY at all, it's definitely worth the money to check this one out.",1036540800,2,1428,4.648221343873518
1788467,5,B00006RCNX,"While many people claim that Season Two is the best season ever of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I favor Season Three instead. It features the introduction of fan favorites Eliza Dushku (as Faith, a renegade Slayer) and Emma Caulfield (as Anya, former ""patron saint"" of scorned women) as well as a keeps-you-guessing storyline. Season Three is also the most consistent season - there are no ""stinker"" episodes like Season Two's ""Bad Eggs"" or Season Four's ""Beer Bad.""
This set contains all 22 episodes of the first season. They are:
""Anne"" - After sending Angel to hell at the end of the previous Season, Buffy has run to L.A. and changed her name, abandoning her Slayer responsibilities. But when someone she's previously helped recognizes her and asks for her aid again, can she refuse?
""Dead Man's Party"" - Buffy's back, but not all is right. She's still expelled from school, and her friends have some serious repressed anger that's just waiting to burst out. And then there's the zombies that crash her ""welcome home"" party...
""Faith, Hope and Trick"" - Eliza Dushku (Bring It On) appears as sexy new Slayer Faith, whose camaraderie with Buffy's friends makes her a bit jealous. It also features the introduction of Mr. Trick, one of the funnier (and one of the few black) characters to appear on Buffy.
""Beauty and the Beasts"" - Angel's back from Hell slightly feral and werewolf Oz may have been getting out of his cage during the full moon. When there's a series of brutal murders, Buffy and Willow have to consider the possibility that one of their boyfriends is the culprit.
""Homecoming"" - One of the funniest episodes of Buffy ever, along with ""Doppelgangland"" (see below). Buffy and Cordelia are in a no-holds-barred race to become Homecoming Queen. But they're soon in big trouble when Homecoming coincides with Mr. Trick's new big game event, Slayerfest '98.
""Band Candy"" - Another hysterically funny episode, in which a batch of magically enhanced candy makes all the adults in Sunnydale act like irresponsible teenagers - including Giles and Buffy's mother Joyce.
""Revelations"" - The Scooby Gang has found out about Angel's return, and are not happy with Buffy for keeping it a secret. And Faith's new Watcher, Gwendolyn Post, arrives in Sunnydale.
""Lover's Walk"" - James Marsters returns as a lovelorn Spike, who's lost Drusilla to a Chaos Demon. When he kidnaps Willow and Xander, and forces Buffy and Angel to work together with him, you know badness is going to ensue...and it does in a heartbreaking conclusion.
""The Wish"" - Enraged by Xander's betrayal and her social ostracism, Cordelia wishes that Buffy had never come to Sunnydale. Little does she know that vengeance demon Anya (Emma Caulfield) is there to make it come true. Suddenly she finds herself in a world where Willow and Xander are vampires and the Master rules Sunnydale after dark.
""Amends"" - When the ghosts of Angel's past victims appear to torment him, Buffy must find out what is doing this. Also, Willow and Oz reconcile.
""Gingerbread"" - When Joyce finds two children's bodies, apparently killed by witches, the town gears up for a massive witch hunt. Buffy and Willow find themselves caught in the middle of it.
""Helpless"" - On her eighteenth birthday, Buffy finds herself losing her Slayer powers. When her mother is kidnapped by a psychotic vampire unleashed by the Watcher's Council, Buffy must save her armed with only her wits.
""The Zeppo"" - While Buffy and co. stave off yet another apocalypse, Xander finds himself hanging out with a bunch of zombies, saving the school from being blown up, and...losing his virginity!?
""Bad Girls"" - New Watcher Wesley Wyndham-Pryce makes his appearance, and Faith shows Buffy a walk on the wild side that ends in tragedy.
""Consequences"" - After the deputy mayor's death, Buffy and Faith find themselves feeling trapped and scared. Faith takes a decided turn for the worse, and joins forces with the cheerfully evil Mayor of Sunnydale.
""Doppelgangland"" - A spell performed by Willow and Anya brings Vampire Willow from the world of ""The Wish"" (see above) to normal Sunnydale. Hysterically funny; the highlight has to be when Willow masquerades as Vampire Willow.
""Enemies"" - Faith shows her true colors when she and the Mayor ask a demon to remove Angel's soul, returning him to the soulless vampire Angelus.
""Earshot"" - Buffy gains telepathy after killing a demon, and hears a death threat aimed at the school's students. Unfortunately, the ability to hear others' minds is slowly driving her insane.
""Choices"" - The Box of Gavrok, an item essential to the Mayor's Ascension, arrives in Sunnydale. The Scoobies manage to capture it, but in the process Willow is kidnapped. Stop the Ascension, or save Willow?
""The Prom"" - It's prom time again in Sunnydale. But when hellhounds trained to attack people in formal wear are unleashed, Buffy must put her plans on hold to stop them. Also, Angel decides to break up with Buffy.
""Graduation Day, Parts One and Two"" - The climactic two-part season finale. When Faith poisons Angel, the only cure is the blood of a Slayer. Buffy goes after Faith, but only succeeds in putting her in a coma. Angel must drink from Buffy to survive. And, of course, the Mayor Ascends into a gigantic snake.",1035676800,163,5260,4.917885264341957
1788468,5,B00006RCNX,"Season two and three are the best by story line. But I really have to say that everyone should stop ragging on 4. That season was really hard for the writers because of the million c hanges that Buffy had to go through.
But anyway Season 3 is brilliant qua character grow. And altough I did like The Mayor. I think the story of Glory was so much more complex that it made her a little better. But appearantly I am alone on that.
This ia a season you will have to buy!",1035504000,7,467,4.032258064516129
1788469,5,B00006RCNX,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer is without a doubt the best TV show ever, because of excellent writing, acting, direction, characters, and originality. Probably the best thing about the show is that it can mix hilarious comedy and heart-wrenching drama into the same episode. You'll laugh, and then you'll cry. You truly care about the characters. This show is a perfect mix of Drama/Comedy/Action/Horror/Romance.
The third season of BtVS is widely considered to be its best. It's not my favorite(I've seen it less than other seasons), but it's up there and completely incredible. The best villains ever are here with Faith/The Mayor. Speaking of Faith, she is probably the most tragic character ever. Her entire character is just wonderful.
This 6-disc set will include such classic episodes as:
""Lover's Walk"": Spike returns to Sunnydale, and many relationships are altered forever.
""The Wish"": Genius episode in which Cordelia makes a wish in which Buffy never came to Sunnydale.
""The Zeppo"": Hilarious and insane come to mind for this classic.
""Bad Girls"": The start of Faith's tragic downfall.
""Doppelgangland"": Brilliantly witty episode in which Vamp Willow is transported into this reality.
""Graduation Day, Pt. 1"": Features one of the best fights ever(Buffy/Faith), and main characters are wounded.
""Graduation Day, Pt. 2"": The Mayor comes out of his shell, hell ensues.
Buy this now! If you don't have the first two seasons, get them too! I promise that it will be the best purchase you ever make.",1035417600,13,1499,5.172839506172839
1788470,5,B00006RCNX,"I've been a follower of this series scence the begining. Season three was the ""eye opener"" & a ""fitten ending"" to various quistions. I think anyone ,even those who just starting to watch, will love it.",1035331200,3,201,4.611111111111111
1788471,5,B00006RCNX,"It's funny that ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is already in its seventh season, when there was a time it didn't seem as if the show would even last seven episodes.  Only recently  (very recently) has ""Buffy"" finally started to lose steam, in terms of ratings, core fan loyalty, and critical acclaim.  The long-overdue DVD release of Season 3 should be a welcome reminder of what ""Buffy"" was like at its artistic and popular peak.  Season 2 of ""Buffy"" shattered all sorts of dramatic rules and managing to remain hilarious and poignant all at once.  Season 3 keeps rolling with the punches and duplicates those successes.
We begin with a pair of episodes easing Buffy back into life in Sunnydale, after her traumatic exit in ""Becoming"".  ""Anne"" is a careful character piece, reintroducing Buffy to her relevance in the larger world, through a trip through Los Angeles' demon dimensions.  In ""Dead Man's Party"", a host of zombies comes to town and wrecks Buffy's house, just in time to salvage her disastrous homecoming party.
""Faith, Hope and Trick"" is the first great episode of the year.  Faith, the new second Slayer, is introduced, as is Mr. Trick, the  season's first recurring villain -- Pimp Vampire Daddy.  Also along for the ride is Scott Hope, Buffy's human rebound boyfriend.  And, of course, Angel returns to life.  In ""All Men Are Beasts"", Buffy weighs her new boyfriend against the feral Angel, and Oz fights Sunnydale High's resident Jekyll/Hyde monster.
The season arc continues in ""Homecoming"" and ""Band Candy"", two funny episodes which introduce Sunnydale's off-kilter Mayor (the witty Harry Groener).  A darker hint of things to come arrives in ""Relevations"" -- the first serious cracks in the prickly Faith's emotional armor, and the first hints that Giles will not be Buffy's Watcher forever.  This episode ends on a frustrating emotional disconnect between Buffy and Faith, and while this was unusual upon first viewing, in retrospect it's a powerful moment, fraught with the tragedy to come.
""Lover's Walk"" is one of the season highlights, as last year's villain Spike returns to town.  It's amusing that all the regular characters suffer some defeat in this story, but Spike drives out of town singing along to Sid Vicious and obviously back on top of the world.  It'd be another year before he'd return, but Season 3 is, happily, strong enough to overcome his absence.
""The Wish"" is Buffy's first look at alternate history, as Season 1's villain, The Master, is momentarily resurrected and a battle-scarred alter-Buffy can't quite defeat him.  In ""Amends"", billed as ""A Buffy Christmas"", it's Angel's turn to be redeemed from his past.
""Gingerbread"", ""Helpless"", and ""The Zeppo"" are in a sense the last three stand-alone episodes of the series, which soon afterwards would roll over into more of a continuous soap-opera storyline.  That said, ""Zeppo"" is memorable for its Xander's-eye view of Sunnydale High, and in ""Helpless"", Giles is finally fired by the increasingly ominous Watcher's Council.
Faith takes a screaming left turn toward the dark side of the Slayer force in ""Bad Girls"" and ""Consequences"", two of the rawest  hours of the season.  The ending of this two-parter reveals Faith's betrayal of Buffy, which in a sense stings more than Angel's conversion to evil the year before, because it is voluntary.
In ""Enemies"" and ""Choices"", the Faith/Mayor Wilkins relationship develops.  The father/daughter chemistry between the season's two remaining villains sets them up among the pantheon of great ""Buffy"" baddies.  In between are two great solo episodes -- ""Dopplegangland"" (the one with the Evil Willow) and ""Earshot"", the first of two stories so raw and timely that it was yanked from the air due to its eerie prefiguring of the Columbine High School murders.  Oddly, ""The Prom"", a very funny hour, was spared this fate, even though it treads similar grounds.  The ""Class Protector"" trophy awarded Buffy is another of the show's finest bittersweet moments.
The year ends with ""Graduation Day"", the culmination of the Faith and Mayor Wilkins storylines, and the final hours of the Scooby Gang as students at Sunnydale High.  Pay close attention to the final battle scene -- many recurring characters have their ultimate fates revealed in brief flashes way from the main action.
While Season 4 of ""Buffy"", the next set due out (eventually), is terrific, Season 3 is for many the final year in which the show was, quite simply, perfect.",1035072000,13,4467,5.053133514986376
1788472,5,B00006RCNX,"I am a devoted Buffy fan, I have seen every episode through the beginning of the 7th season.  The third season was indeed a great bunch of episodes, as you can see from looking at the other reviews.  I have the first two seasons on DVD, and I can't wait for January to get the 3rd.  I look forward to some nice extras as well as the chance to watch an episode whenever I want.  There are a ton of great characters in this season, and I agree with a lot of people that the Mayor is one of the best Buffy villians.  A lot of people think that Buffy was best in high school, and the series went downhill after season three.  Don't believe them.  Actually, I prefer the 4th season to the 3rd.  I have no idea when that season will come out on DVD, but what I am saying is don't dismiss later episodes of Buffy, because they are just as good (if not better) than the early episodes.  If you like Buffy, you should buy every season you can on DVD; I assure you, it will be worth it.  This review is not very coherent; sorry about that.  Anyway, buy Buffy the Vampire: Season 3 on DVD!",1035072000,3,1078,4.061611374407583
1788473,5,B00006RCNX,i would have to say this dvd set rocks. the third season was one of the best in buffy history. eliza's character just added alot to the show . buy the dvd set. it will be worth it,1034812800,3,179,3.736842105263158
1788474,5,B00006RCNX,"No season of Buffy will ever come close to living up to the genius of the second season, but this third season at least made a solid attempt.  Good characters, good action, lots of fun.  Unfortunately, this is also the season where they switched from shooting 16mm to the larger 35mm format, which robbed the show of a lot of its grain and color intensity, costing it a large portion of the distinctive visual style of the first two seasons.",1034726400,15,441,4.5
1788498,5,B00006RCNX,"This was probably the best season of ""Buffy."" It definitely had the best main villain (the Mayor -- a perfect mix of devoted family man and evil demon worshipper). It also had some of the best episodes (""Lovers Walk,"" ""Doppelgangland,"" and ""The Wish"").
The special features on the ""Buffy"" DVDs haven't been fantastic, but they've been OK. Really, it's worth buying the DVDs just to have the episodes in their entirety (FX edits the reruns so it can cram in more commercials).
This is a must-have for any ""Buffy"" fan.",1034726400,,516,4.7444444444444445

1788501,4,B00006RCNX,"This is my favorite season of Buffy: The Vampire Slayer, which was itself, my favorite series second only to the X-files at the time.  The villainous ""Big Bad"" in the Mayor was wonderful, at once kooky and deadly.  Many wonderful characters are added to the series (i.e. Anya, Mr. Trick, and Wesley), not the least of which is that bad-but-troubled, new-slayer-in-town, Faith.
And the Scoobies relationships continue to twist and turn.  Angel is back, but is he the same and will the others forgive him?  Will Oz and Willow get back together?  Are things really meant to be between Angel and Buffy?  Will Cordelia wish Xander into a spineless toad?  Get the DVDs and find out! *wink*
So, why the 4 out of 5 rating?  Well, this season is rather bittersweet for me.  I consider it the pinnacle of the series, but the show is now in it's seventh season and I feel that it (like The X-files) has gone depressingly down-hill.  At this point, ""Buffy"" is far from my favorite show.",1034121600,2,974,4.6104651162790695
1788502,5,B00006RCNX,I am not sure if it's the fact that there is a collection in this season of every great character (including a terrific one episode appearance by Spike) but you also have the best and most villain created for the show--The Mayor of Sunnydale who wants to ascend and becoma a giant snake. This is the best show on television and this is the season that cemented that.,1033603200,2,366,4.397058823529412
1788503,5,B00006RCNX,"Season 3 of Buffy was debatedly one of the best seasons. It is the scoobies last year at Sunnydale high, and a new slayer is in town. This season, like the others, is incredibly well written (how could it not be w/ Joss and company working on it?). This season has the fullest cast of all seasons. It is Angel (David Boreanaz) and Cordy's (Charisma Carpentar) last season. We see more of Oz (Seth Green). Faith (Eliza Dushku) enters the cast. Anya (Emma Caulfield) comes in this season too. This season is a set up for the Scoobies starting college in season 4 and Angel and Cordy making their big move to L.A. and to Joss' spin-off Angel. This season is filled with more humor and drama then we had previously seen. I am being vague, so as not to give anything away to those who have not seen it. This is a really great season, and like the last 2 seasons DVD's I'me sure we will see some great extra features, graphics, and interviews. I highly recommmend it!",1033516800,3,961,4.374301675977653
1788504,5,B00006RCNX,"As the most anticipated season of one of television's finest shows, season 3 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is sure to please.  This season was a roller coaster ride of emotions and excitement.  With plot twists and turns like never before, these 22 episodes helped define and give life to the characters we had come to know and love.  And if the DVD set for Season 2 was any indication, then the new DVD extras are sure to satiate even the most die-hard Buffy fan.",1033516800,,462,4.411764705882353
1788505,5,B00006RCNX,"While a lot of folks hold the second season in highest esteem, what with the whole Buffy/Angel vs. Spike/Drusilla romance comparison, I have always felt that first and foremost Buffy the Vampire Slayer was about High School and all the confusion, competition, stress and sheer exuberant craziness that institution brings to mind.  It is the one universal experience for almost all BTVS's viewers, and I can't think of any TV show that captured the High School experience better.  (That is why I am so optiomistic aboutv Season Seven, which returns Buffy and the viewers to Sunnydale High...but I digress).
That is what is so wonderful about Season Three.  It is the whole High School package.  You want sexual frustration?  You got Angel and Buffy forced into chastity by a gypsy curse.  You want sexual confusion?  How about Willow's and Xander's semi-betrayal of their respective Significant Others?  For teenage aangst, there's Xander's walk on the wild side and Jonathan's flirtation with despair.  You want bad gir;s, bad men, and bad karma?  You want Alyson Hannigan in a leather teddy or David Boreanaz shirtless?  You want a prom to bring tears to your eyes?  You ever dream about blowing up your high school?  It's ALL here.
And then there's the cast.  This is the last season to feature David Boreanaz and Charisma Carpenter, before they moved on to Los Angeles.  This is the season that gave us the first appearances of Alexis Denisof as Wesley the Wimp, Emma Caulfield as Anyanka the Vengeance Demon, the explosive Eliza Dushku as the Slayer-You-Love-to-Hate Faith, and best of all the most beaitifully layered depiction of evil in Harry Groener's tour de force as the mayor.  These are moements to savor.
And that's what DVD is all about, I feel.  If you only intend to watch a show once, why bother with the capital outlay?  There's always reruns on FX and rental from Blockbuster.  But Season Three can be enjoyed over and over again, and that's what merits a f-star rating IMHO.
Here are the episodes:
1. Anne - Buffy tries to hide from her family, friends, and self, but just when she thought she was out, they drag her back in.
2. Dead Man's Party - How tough is it to apologize for running out on friends and loved ones?  Harder than fighting zombies, that's for sure.
3. Faith, Hope & Trick - Faith and Trick make their first appearances, and Angel reaturns
4. Beauty and the Beasts - Oz the Werewolf is a murder suspect.
5.  Homecoming - Buffy vs. Cordelia for Homecoming Queen.
6.  Band Candy - Giles and Joyce get jiggy and Kristine Sutherland and Tony Head get to have some serious fun screen time in this personal favorite of mine,
7.  Revelations -Buffy's secret is over as the Scooby Gang learn of Angel's resurrection.
8.  Lovers Walk -  Spike returns to moon about Drusilla; yje Oz-Willow-Xander-Cordelia relationship hits meltdown.
9.  The Wish -  The first appearance of Emma Caulfield as Anyanka  who grants Cordelia's wish that Buffy never came to Sunnydale, creating an alternate reality in Alyson Hannigan gets a makeover from hell.  A classic.
10.  Amends - A bizarre twist on A Christmas Carol, with Angel tortured by visiting spoirits.
11.  Gingerbread -  Joyce goes on a witch hunt....literally, and a supporting character gets transformed into a rat for three more seasons.
12.  Helpless - Buffy's 18th birthday brings a nasty present from Giles and the Watcher's Copuncil.
13.  The Zeppo - Xander is put into perspective for himself and the audience, abd Nicholas Brendan takes center stage for one of the few times.
14.  Bad Girls - Wesley arribes to ot fussbudget Giles, and Faith seduces  Buffy with the Dark Side of the Force, and with one irrevocable act of violenmce be begin the countdown to the season finale.
15.  Consequences - Buffy vs. the Mayor for Faith's soul, and Buffy doesn't win.
16.  Doppelgngland - Alyson Hannigan gets to play opposite her self in more ways than once in a sequel to The Wish.
17.  Enemies - Faith and the Mayor getvdeeper into cahgoots.
18.  Earshot - This episode was postponed due to the Columbine shootings, because of its theme of plans to murder high school students, and Danny Strong gets his first opportunity to make Jonathan more than just a face in the crowd.
19.  Choices - Buffy and the Gang contemplate life after High School.
20.  The Prom - Buffy and Angel gace some heard truths leading to the spin-off series and Buffy meets the third member of the future triumvirate of eveil dweebs.
21.  Graduation Day - Also originally delayed because of Columbine, the whole Faith/Mayor/Ascension storyline reaches a climax in the season finale to end all season fineales.  If the show had been cancelled at that point, I could have lived with that decision, so neat is the wrap-up.

1788506,5,B00006RCNX,"Season three: How can the cast of Buffy even hope to top the glorious second season? Well, for starters the very first episode is great. In ""ANNE"", still hurting from the events that occurred at the end of season 2, Buffy tries to forget her past and lives in another town working a waitress job until a girl recognizes her and asks for her help. Buffy realizes who and what she is and returns to Sunnydale, where the Scoobies have been filling in for the Slayer's absence. Then there is the addition of a new Slayer, Faith (Eliza Dushku...remember her in True Lies? All grown up!!) who appears in Sunnydale as a powerful ally for the Buffy and the scoobies. This is short-lived though, as she soon becomes one of their greatest threats. The foreshadowing of plotlines in the second season become apparent as this season's villain is introduced...none other than the mayor of Sunnydale, who is attempting to ascend into a true/pure demon.
This season boasts many of the show's strongest episodes such as ""The Wish"", where Cordelia unknowingly makes a wish to a vengeance demon (Anyanka, who becomes the Anya we all love to laugh at later) and wishes that Buffy never came to Sunnydale. This episode is grand, as we see an alternate reality where Buffy left California and never stopped the Master from rising and as a result, he succeeded in opening the Hellmouth. Truly one of the better episodes. We also are given a taste of foreshadowing in later episodes...Buffy's sister Dawn (to come in season 5) is mentioned in a glimmer of dialogue that will remain meaningless until two years later (can you find the episode? Hint...listen to both Faith and Buffy talk in the later epsiodes). Faith is terrific as Buffy's nemesis, a Slayer just like her. Oh, did I mention Angel returns from a hell dimension as well?
The scoobies get their own star time as well. In ""THE ZEPPO"", Xander proves that he is more than just the weak part of the group, adept at getting them donuts and not much else. In ""THE WISH"" and ""DOPPLEGANGLAND"", we get to see a Vamp Willow...very interesting and two of the season's best episodes. This season also brings us more of the Watcher's Council, the mysterious group that Giles works for including Wesley, who later leaves to aid Angel and Cordelia in Los Angeles in the spin-off show Angel. And finally, we get to see the Scoobies graduate in a very typical Sunnydale fashion...with a huge battle. It was hard to top season two, but this season is more of Joss Whedon's masterpiece of television; let people and critics shun it...we all know great TV when we see it.",1033430400,,2591,4.684210526315789
1788537,5,B00006RCNX,"BtVS season three is an absolute must-see for all Buffy fans!  It's probably the best season out of all six that have been aired so far (as of 10/01/02), and the dynamics of the characters are absolutely stunning.

The writing is tight, creative and true, which cannot be said for the later seasons, and Whedon et al are at the top of their game. The combination Big Bads of Faith and the Mayor are a riot. Whedon really did a good job of creating entertaining villains with full, captivating personalities. The poignant Buffy/Angel storyline is also well conceived and their relationship ends the only way it can. The showdown between slayers, Faith and Buffy, is classic, and the final battle brings a great ending to the high school years.

1788544,5,B00006RCNX,"What really can I say about 'Buffy' that people don't know already.  I could easily mention the constant wit, the humour, the tragedy and the dramatic innovation that the show constantly displays.  But then it's been said all before.  It starts off brilliantly with 'Anne', and episode that provides a fantastic follow-up to the tragedy that Buffy has had to endure and the cliffhanger ending of last season.  Now based in L.A. she finds redemption and herself after literally having to go to hell and back.  It's these constant little metaphors that make the show so brilliant, and they don't stop there.
This series also introduces what is probably the best nemesis Buffy has ever had to fight in the form of Faith (Eliza Dushku), a slayer gone bad as well as being representative of all Buffy could have been.  So effectively fighting herself, Buffy is tempted to the dark side by her fellow Slayer in the powerful two-parter 'Bad Girls' and 'Consequences'.  Yet it's in Whedon's (the show's creator) dealing with Faith that makes her so unique.  Rather than staging her as a typical bad guy he created a wonderfully sympathetic character that, rather than just being simply evil, is someone who has been pushed to it by an inability to bond with normal people; her father/daughter relationship with the other Big Bad, the Mayor, is beautifully touching.  In fact, Faith became such a cult character among fans that she returned for a brief stint in Season Four.
The third season also has some fantastic stand-alone episodes as well, in particular the widely acclaimed 'Earshot'.  Taking what at first appears to be an obvious story (Buffy is given psychic powers) it turns it into something else that, despite being controversial, is incredibly sympathetic to the cause.  As the episode begins in humorous form it is quickly transformed into a deeply upsetting story about suicide and misery.  It's remarkable that an episode that contributes very little to the overall story arc can be this fantastic but yet again 'Buffy' manages it.
Another episode worth mentioning is 'The Zeppo', already a cult episode among fans, which sees Xander realise his own potential.  As the rest of the cast are involved in a fantastically, and purposefully, overblown fight to the death with a creature from the Hellmouth the action focuses squarely on Xander and his realisation that he doesn't have to have super powers to be one of the gang.  Aside from his smile to Cordelia at the end, the highlight has to be Xander's talk with Oz on the essence of cool which is just about one of the most hilarious sequences the show has ever thought up.
Of course, it would be wrong just to focus on a few episodes as all are unique in their way.  Yet 'Graduation Day' definitely deserves a mention.  Not only is it highly dramatic, but also touchingly romantic.  It would be difficult for anybody not to be moved by the 'Drink me' scene in which Buffy offers her blood to save Angel from death.  There is also a brilliantly choreographed scene in which Buffy fights it out with Faith, in perhaps the best fight scene of the entire show.  However, it is the element of prophecy in the final episode that really marks it out, with Dawn being referenced to early on as well as Buffy's eventual sacrifice (when Faith says 'counting down from 7:30' it's a reference to 730 days in two years, the amount of time until the end of season five).  With a show that thinks this far ahead it's hard not to be impressed.  All I can really say is 'watch this - it's probably the best TV show you're ever likely to see'.",1033344000,2,3585,4.7131410256410255
1788545,5,B00006RCNX,"My first thought about Buffy The Vampire Slayer When it came out was "" Oh no, the movie [was bad] and so will this"". I had no interest in watching it at all. However my niece and I watched one night ( It was one of her favorite shows)and after that I was hooked. I missed the entire third through the seasons and some of six. However I am making up for lost time since then and here is what I have come up with.
Most people are turned off the title. A lot of people are turned off by its theme. However, there is more to Buffy than snappy come backs and stakes through heart along with your occasional beheading. Buffy has a lot to say about life,  real life. The show through  season six shows Buffy going through everyday worries, battles and pains just like we do. Two of my favorites are the ones where Buffy has to let Angel go no matter how strong their love is before it destroys them both. The other is when Joyce, Buffy's mother, dies of a brain tumor in a later season. Also, she battles unpaid bills, finding herself flipping hamburgers at the Doublemeat Palace later in the Show's life.
The show has it's times that has left something to be desire like any other show, the second and third season is a must for anyone starting watch Buffy. Joss Whedon often time will bring things from other seasons to make sense later on what did not then. You will find the beginning or the Buffy/Spike/Giles trio start at the end of the second season has her blond haired nemesis leaves town, only to return the third season as a regular. Xander is a character that, if you have ever felt like a nobody, you can really relate to. He's wonderfully witty and those big browns will have you hooked in no time. Though Angel returns from the pits of Hell, by the end of the season on Graduation day, Buffy and Angel come to the terrible heartbreaking conclusion that to save themselves, they must destroy their love. You begin to see a wonderful and charming romance take off for Willow and Oz that is short lived in up coming seasons. A romance that would later lead her into the arms of...another woman? But to understand you must see season three before any of the other seasons, and understand why Buffites are so territorial.",1033257600,2,2224,4.3825665859564165
1788546,5,B00006RCNX,"This is it , it's the best season of this show. In here you met the two sweetest villians of all the series: The Mayor and (my love) FAITH !!!  In here you see a most developed ,a more self-confident and strength Buffy character.  Willow is the queen of the wicka and Xander rules.  I think that this season was the best of Joss mind and heart.  This is the place were you should be to know the future of the whole series, with Faith telling Buffy about so much things from the future (her sister, Glory, Buffy's inminent death and return, etc.), all this by dreams.
This is why I give this season 5 stars and the whole universe.",1033084800,12,629,4.216666666666667

1788568,5,B00006RCNX,"After the phenomenal Seasons 1 and 2, Buffy the Vampire Slayer returned on 29th September 1998 in the US for its action-packed third season. Season 3 is my second favourite season of Buffy, after the epic Season 5. Fans thought that after the Season 2 finale, things just couldn't get any better (many were right), but I thought Season 3 was a massive improvement on Season 2, even though it was still great. Buffy's fanbase was growing by the episode - as was the critical acclaim. This was going to be a show people would remeber forever. Every episode in Season 3 is phenomenal - 10/10 for EVERY SINGLE EPISODE! You can't say that about many TV shows, can you?!
The relationships in Season 3 are tricky business, as with most seasons of Buffy. After sending Angel to Hell in the Season 2 finale, Buffy is reunited with him as he is returns at the end of Faith, Hope and Trick. In his naked and ashamed state it takes a few episodes for him to actually realise who and where he is. This starts an on/off, yo-yo style relationship for the two before he decides he can't be with her anymore in The Prom. Willow is still dating Oz, and Xander is still going out with Cordelia. In Homecoming, Willow and Xander share a passionate kiss. They are overcome with guilt...and really want to do it again! This wrong, but almost sweet, 'affair' continues until Lover's Walk - three episodes later, when Oz and Cordelia catch the two at it. For Xander and Cordelia, it's over but Oz decides to give it another go with Willow later on. In other Buffy storylines, Giles is fired of being Buffy's Watcher after he fails to obey the Council's orders. Enter Wesley Wyndam-Price, a snobby, irritating Watcher from England sent to watch over Buffy and Faith. Buffy's mum also plays a bigger role in Season 3 than she did in previous seasons, but never managed to get her real-life name in the opening credits.
The story arc for Season 3 is brilliant. In Faith Hope And Trick, Buffy meets a new Slayer, Faith. It seems that when Kendra died at the hands of Drusilla in Becoming Part 1, Faith was called as the new Slayer. Faith is outgoing, spontaneous, and tough; she doesn't take no ""BS"" from anyone. Buffy and Faith hit it off after a few complications and spend the majority of the season slaying vamps and killing demons. Bad Girls is a major turning point for the remainder of the season. Buffy and Faith are out patrolling when Faith accidently steaks a human. Buffy is overcome with guilt, yet Faith isn't. Apparently, ""these things happen - think about how many people we've saved. One dead guy doesn't tip the scale."" Cue arguements, fighting and the darkside. In Consequences, Faith arrives at the office of the Mayor of Sunnydale, Richard Wilkins III. He has a secret plan to take over Sunnydale in a few months that will destroy the town and be over run with demons. The Mayor wants the Slayer dead, as does Faith. ""I guess that means you have a job opening,"" says Faith at the end of Consequneces. Faith and the Mayor work side by side to eliminate the Slayer in episodes such as Enemies, Choices, Graduation Day Part 1 and Graduation Day Part 2. The last two episodes, Graduation Day Parts 1 and 2, the two-parter season finale are some of the greatest episodes in Buffy's history. Things get really ugly when Faith poisons Angel with an arrow. He needs the blood of a Slayer to live, so Buffy goes to Faith and stabs her in the stomach with her knife - a present from the Mayor. Faith would rather see herself die than Angel to live. ""You killed me. Still won't help your boy though,"" she says before falling onto the back of a moving truck. As Graduation Day Part 2 begins, Buffy offers herself to Angel. He finally agrees, in his vampire state and drinks Buffy's blood. Buffy is admitted to hospital and lives. Faith is in a coma and it's highly unlikely that she will ever regain consciousness - a subject that is highlighted later in Season 4. All the students arrive for Graduation Day, as the Mayor ascends into a huge 100 foot snake - a demon in true form, according to Anyanka (a former vengance demon who has a greater impact on the show later on in Season 4). Buffy finally kills the Mayor, with the help of hundreds of students in a spectacular display of teamwork and determination, by leading him through the school and blowing it up with him inside. Once again, Buffy and the Scoobies save the day...
OVERALL GRADE: 10/10
Season 3 of Buffy is a classic and a favourite amongst many. Other standout episodes of this season include Anne, Band Candy, The Wish, Helpless, Doppelgangland and Earshot. The extra DVD footage is fantastic - as always and really is great value for money. For Buffy fans, this is essential - buy it now from Amazon!",1032739200,8,4751,4.544924154025671
1788569,5,B00006RCNX,"I had not watched T.V. in about ten years when a young friend turned me on to Buffy.  I am so glad she did!  This series is a prime example of the television medium being used to its best and fullest extent, and the third season simply gets everything right.
For anyone out there who might not be aware of what this show is about, the premise of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is this:  California teenager Buffy Sommers discovers that she is a Slayer, that is, the one person in the world destined to stand between humanity and the forces of evil -- mainly, as you might suspect from the title, vampires, but also demons and other nasties of various types.  Together with a group of in-the-know school friends and School Librarian Giles -- who also happens to be Buffy's ""Watcher,"" a kind of mystical supervisor cum advisor -- Buffy fights the bad and serves the forces of good.
With a premise like that, Buffy the Vampire Slayer could easily have devolved into a kind of cheesy monster-of-the week program.  That it doesn't is due to a number of things, but mainly the immense amount of detail that is put into the characters and their relationships.  Nobody is one dimensional;  these are all truly believable real people with real lives that just happen to include fighting the powers of darkness.  Even the demons are not solely or gratuitously evil -- they have loves, desires and ambitions like everyone else.  Buffy herself is torn between the necessity of her destiny and her desire to do normal things like go to the prom or run for homecoming queen, and we really feel her anguish at having to choose between what she may want and what is ""Right"" in the bigger sense of the word.
Throughout this third season the scripting is phenomenal and the acting is superb;  the film editing is practically flawless, the internal continuity is unparalleled and the fight sequences are some of the best I've ever seen.  The series also does an amazing job of walking the fine line between darkness and humour, applying comic elements without ever becoming unbearably campy.  As it juxtaposes the supernatural with the mundane it really makes us believe that there is more to the world than what is commonly apparent, but it never diminishes the impact of things, like simply going to high school, that are easy to take for granted.  I've never seen a series that could so successfully make me laugh out loud at one minute and burst into heartfelt tears in the next.
Watch Buffy!  You will absolutely not be disappointed.",1031529600,16,2513,4.668934240362812
1788570,5,B00006RCNX,"After the first two seasons, ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" just kept getting better and better. It was unbelieveable. This set of the show's incredible third season starts right off with what happened in the end of the brilliant second season. The set starts off with ""Anne"", a rather disappointing, but still entertaining episode. Buffy has moved to L.A. and is working as a waitress. Her friends are taking over for her back home. After a horrible incident in L.A., Buffy heads back home. Things start to go crazy. Our favorite gang are starting their senior year at Sunnydale High. Buffy just worries about getting back in after being expelled. In ""Faith, Hope, And Trick"", the gang is introduced to Faith, the slayer called after Kendra's death. She is the 'Anti - Buffy'. Unconventional, violent, wild, and sexual as all get out. This begins a long, twisted, and sad journey for Faith. I don't want to give anything away, but it's apparent that she isn't playing with a full deck. For this marvelous portrayal of the character, you have to really credit the intoxicating talent of Eliza Dushku. Not to mention the fact that she's a real beauty. Angel, having been dispatched last season, also comes back. Buffy nurses him back to health, while keeping it a secret from her friends. Spike also returns to town in glorious fashion in the excellent ""Lover's Walk"". This is not the same Spike we know. The season also includes the excellent Christmas episode titled ""Amends"", which is one of the finer episodes of the season. It deals with Angel being revisited by the ghosts of his past victims. This season also introduces the main villain. This is not the same villain we have come to know in this show. He is the mayor of Sunnydale. His name is Richard Wilkins III, and he is played superbly by Harry Groener. There has never been a villain like him. He is an ancient demon who is counting down to his ascension where he will become a full blown snake-like demon, and bring hell upon earth. Groener makes the character so normal and likeable, it's hard to want this guy dead. He makes funny comments and is a stickler for family morals and clean fingernails. He is a joy to watch. This is the season where we also meet Anya, an ex-vengenace demon who first appears in the episode ""The Wish"". She later becomes Xander's girlfriend in the future. The season brings many great, classic 'Buffy' moments. The final half with the dueling slayers is fantastic and breathtaking all at once. Things get wild for Buffy and Faith in ""Bad Girls"", where Buffy takes a liking to Faith's wild lifestyle. That lifestyle leads to trouble and things get out of control in the conclusion episode, ""Consequences"". It is evident that something bad is happening to Faith. The whole season is heading down to the Mayor's ascension, which is put on hold for the wonderful episode, ""The Prom"". This episode is both beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time. It also includes one of the best 'Buffy' moments ever, as well as one of the saddest. The season also gives us adults(including Giles and Mrs. Summers)acting like kids in the amusing ""Band Candy"". There is the shocking ritual Giles must put Buffy thru in ""Helpless"" that changes things between the two. There is a split vote regarding the Xander - themed episode ""The Zeppo"". It's a wonderful, comical episode that deals with Xander and how he feels about his position in the gang. The fact that the others are fighting to save the end of the world is in the background was lost on so many people. It wasn't about the end of the world. It wasn't about the re-opening of the hellmouth. It was about Xander and a day(and night)in his shoes. It was a wonderfully done joke, but you have to be in on the joke to get it. So many people didn't catch on. The two part season finale begins with ""Graduation Day Part 1"". Our heroes are trying to stop the Mayor while Angel is poisoned and near death. This leads to a devastaing scene between Angel and Buffy. It concludes with one of the best roof raising fights the show has done. Amazing. ""Graduation Day Part 2"" is even better. It's graduation time and everyone just hopes to make it out alive. The Mayor plans on his change at the ceremony. This gives way to a great battle between the Mayor and the entire graduating class. It's an episode that definitley finishes this chapter in the show's history. A real slam bang finale. This season had other highs as well. The important and brilliantly done ""Earshot"", where Buffy gains the power of hearing and overhears someone saying they are going to make the students pay. It deals with teen violence in a wonderful way. It twists it around in the end and it isn't what you originally thought it was. Wonderfully done. There are lows to this season as well. The horrible ""Beauty And The Beast"" is a message episode about physical abuse that falters in every way. Not a good one. The new watcher, Wesley Wyndham-Price, is introduced here, and the character is a huge stereotype in the very beginning. Along the way, he comes into his own. Thank the charming portrayal of the character by Alexis Denisoff. The writing and direction is still top notch. It's still clever, smart, funny, and hip. The make-up and costumes are still the best to be seen on television. Joss Whedon has created a remarkable fantasy world with the show and this season proves that the characters and their surroundings change aorund them as well. The cast is one of the tightest and most talented currently on T.V. They make these characters relatable and loveable in such extreme situations and storylines by doing such a magnificent job. The Emmy board needs to push out some older members and get this show and cast recognition!!. This season marked the end for Angel and Cordelia(David Boreanaz and Charisma Carpenter), who left the show to appear in the spin off ""Angel"". All in all, this is a superb season that is not to be missed. This is pure Buffy at it's peak and best. This is the last 'classic' season. While another reviewer said it was the last great season and the remaining three seasons aren't good, well, he is wrong. The future seasons are all good in their own right and each have a number of classic episodes. This third season is the last chapter in this section of the show's life. It all changes after this. Changes so much that it seems like a new show. Buffy's third season is rich with intelligence, humor, thrills, action, romance, you name it. It's all here. The third time is definitley the charm.",1031270400,5,6531,4.660311958405546

1788572,5,B00006RCNX,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season Three
  It's interesting how the goals of this show seem to change with every season.  Each successive goal comes as a result of the successful completion of the previous goal, or it builds upon the previous goal.
  The first season was setting the ground rules of Buffy, everyone's favourite slayer.  It immediately laid the groundwork for the chemistry amongst the cast.  The second season set about the explore the romance between Buffy and Angel, while elucidating on the overwhelming alienation felt by the Slayer.  It climaxed in the two-part series Becoming, the second part being inarguably the single best episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer yet.  The third season set out to explore Buffy's struggle between right and wrong, and to end the high school section of the series in a way befitting the show.
  One of the strongest facets of the show is the ease that the writers have in conveying the conflicts among the characters.  Buffy, Willow, and Buffy's mother have a wrenching confrontation in Dead Man's Party (episode 2) that clearly delineates that discord felt among the Scooby gang.  This discord arises from shifting pattern of relationships.  The romantic quadrangle between Oz, Willow, Xander and Cordelia is complex and it works.  The introduction of Faith (another Slayer) provided some incredible fireworks to the show.  Her chemistry with both Buffy (antagonistic) and the Mayor (Harry Groener in a superb comic performance) is real, and intense. The growth of Giles filial love for Buffy reaches a climax in the middle of the third season.  The return of Angel allows for some wonderfully sappy romance; and who knew that Xander would go to the prom with an ex-demon?
  The show also continues to astutely detail the horrors of high school.  In the funniest episode to date (and in my mind, of the show's first six seasons), Earshot (episode 18), Buffy receives a telepathic power.  What she hears is a choir of deafening teenage-angst; the ease that this show has at balancing comedy with pathos as well as incisive observations is continually impressive.  I also like how Buffy's mother, Joyce, deals with finding out about her daughter's vocation.
  Each cast member gets the opportunity to shine throughout the season, and they all make the most of that opportunity.  Spike (that marvelous mixture of menace and drollness) returns for one episode in the third season (in Lover's Walk), and James Marsters is an absolute delight.  Willow gets to show another side to her in both The Wish (episode 9) and Doppelgangland (episode 16).  Alyson Hannigan modulates her voices slightly differently in these episodes, and it works to great effect.  Nicolas Brendon continues to work his 'Matthew Perryish' charm strongly, especially in The Zeppo (episode 15).  Charisma Carpenter, David Boreanaz, Anthony Stewart Head, Seth Green, and Eliza Dushku all turn in strong performances.  However, it's Sarah Michelle Gellar who gives this show it's heart.  Watching her in episodes like Amends (episode 10), The Prom (episode 20), and Helpless (episode 12) displays her understanding of her character, in all it's facets.  She's an underrated television actress.  In the second season, the Becoming two-parter was a high point for ensemble acting.  While episode reaches the heights of that episode, several (Including Dead Man's Party, Revelations, Helpless, Consequences, and the finale, Graduation) showcase the entire talent of the cast.
  Another thing I have to mention is the astonishing fight sequences.  Graduation climaxes in one of the greatest of the series.
  What always impressed me about this show was the ease at which it brings each episode to a resonant conclusion.  The third season continues that tradition.  From the sublime ending of Lover's Walk to the tear-inducing conclusion of The Prom, the conclusions were all highly effective.  In my mind, none more effective then the conclusion to Amends, the Christmas episode.  It features incredible writing, brilliant acting by David Boreanaz and a marvellously redemptive snowfall, one of the most moving moments in this show's history.  It's a perfect end to one of my favourite episodes, and my favourite of the third season.
  Is the third season better than the second season?  I personally think so.  For it's elegant and powerful examination of trust, love, and making amends, I prefer it to season two.  Just barely.  Why carp when there are two brilliant seasons that complement each other impeccably?  So, my thanks to Joss Whedon.",1029196800,21,4560,5.16120218579235

1788574,5,B00006RCNX,"Season three of ""Buffy the vampire Slayer"" has the second best finale of the whole series and it has many other excellent episodes besides, including the hilarious ""Band Candy"" in which all of the adults turn into teenagers. (Must have been as much fun to make as it is to watch.) Then there is Faith, the gorgeously bad vampire slayer; Mayor Richard Wilkins III, the wonderfully gleeful villain; and Mr. Trick, the coolest vampire ever. All of this, and a memorable graduation day that brings down the house--or, rather, the school. The regular cast of characters is stretched as the bizarre situations keep coming episode after episode. Alyson Hannigan and Anthony Head do some of their most memorable work. (Then, Hannigan in particular is always memorable.) Everyone is good--even when they're being bad.
BtVS is funny, exciting and as involving as anything I have ever seen on television. The only thing that could be better is BtVS without commercials. This is it.",1028592000,,970,4.993827160493828

1788592,5,B00006RCNX,"I'm a late Buffy bloomer: I just started watching it last year. I read critics' praises of the show and about its cult following but at the time I thought, ""Why are they ranting and raving about 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'?"" When I finally watched it, I was quite impressed with how witty, sly and suspenseful it was all at the same time without contradicting itself. The characters are quite aware of the absurdity of some of the situations they get into and play it off with a somewhat campy nature. It is completely different than Buffy the movie and that movie is the furthest thing from your mind while viewing the show.
This dvd along with previous seasons are perfect for the Buffy fan from the early days, late bloomers like myself as well as those skeptics who have yet to be converted -- and hooked!",1024963200,2,808,4.503401360544218

1788594,5,B00006RCNX,"I really started getting into Buff closer to the end of Season 2.  I remember crying as the song came on and wondering what could Buffy Summers go thru that is much tougher.  Well the 3rd season provide to be in my opinion one of the best seasons ever written.  It brought upon ""finally"" the Mayor's involvement w/the town of Sunnydale.  It is hinted through out the first two seasons and REALLY brought to life w/the Ascention and everything.  I'm a huge fan of Eliza's work (Faith) I felt that she really did a wonderful job bring to life the ""rouge slayer"" who turns towards the darker sides of her gift.  She lights up the screen from the first punch to the last ""B"" (her favorite name to call Buffy).  The chemistry she has w/ everyone on the show is great.  Faith and Willow facing off, Faith being chained to listen to Angel speak of how killing can change a person.  Even down to the climax of the fight between Buffy and Faith when Buffy must choose to fight Faith in order to save Angel from dying.  NOTHING so far from what the show has brought to life has been more compelling then this Season.  It mixes so well a cross of so many characters.  The love tramas between OZ, Willow, Cordy, and Xander are so well played out you really can understand the heartbreak of broken-trust, and mis-guided ideas.  One of my favorite eps (suprising not a Faith one) is The Wish, which shows Vampire Willow and Xander and a Different Slayer in Buffy.  It was so interesting to watch these people have to act as though they haven't know each other for years, be complete strangers.  Plus the Master is always a nice tough.  He and the Mayor could of done some SERIES damage in Sunnydale.
If and when they do release this (next winter 03!! Joss you are killing me here) it would be shame to pass-up such a beautiful series in the Buffy-saga. And it is nice to see the repeats of what brought upon The Key in season 5.  Though the relationship between it is confusing.
Of course you can watch all of the seasons on Fox Family, or UPN which I incourage anyone to do.  Buffy has been a series that if filled w/sharp writing and terrific journies that explore the reality of the world, in a fantastical kind of way.",1024012800,3,2208,4.383292383292384
