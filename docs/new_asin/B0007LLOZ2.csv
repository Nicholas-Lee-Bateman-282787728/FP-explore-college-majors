2218877,4,B0007LLOZ2,"I can't recommend this film to everyone.  It's not really a kung fu movie.  It has kung fu in it, and the sequences of Wu Shu action are done well enough.  But there just isn't that much fighting and much of it is played for humor.

And the humor is what makes it hard to recommend.  There are moments of intentionally absurd ""Airplane"" style humor.  For example, our heroine receives her powers via an internet download style graphic (complete with percentage complete bar).  And there's a reference to McDonalds.  These strange bits did make me laugh, so I can't be too hard on them.

Aside from the humor, this is a very conventional Asian melodrama.  Except not everybody dies.  I liked the characters, the story, and pretty much everything else.  I can't say exactly why though.

See it if you're interested in something different.  But expect a little strangeness.  You have been warned.",1118448000,2,893,4.745098039215686

2218884,5,B0007LLOZ2,"When I first saw this movie, I missed the beginning of it. I caught from the roller skating scene to the end so I had to watch it a 2nd time. Needless to say, the first time I watched it I was a little confused. I have to say though that if I recommended this to a friend I would have them skip the beginning as I did. It's not that the beginning is BAD, I just think the movie was more interesting trying to figure out why this blind man and snotty girl are trying to kill each other but take care of each other too. Chicken feather's view of life is refreshing! His inability to see makes him stronger with his other senses. And then of course in the end everything works out great.

2218886,5,B0007LLOZ2,"I just want to give a quick impression that I got from watching this (just now)

I am a big fan of comedy in martial arts films. Kung Fu Hustle, Shaolin Soccer, and many of the works of Jackie Chan use comedy is such a graceful way. The White Dragon does so well at keeping a steady sense of humor throughout the film, and also is heartfelt. I never would have heard of this movie if not for a local restaurant owner who probably loves martial arts movies more than I. He seems to so far have remarkable taste.

Let me put it this way. If you like ""wire-fu"" (I really hate that term), a movie with a sense of humor, great fight choreography, and a touching story, then you will enjoy this movie. Both of the main characters played by Cecilia Cheung and Francis Ng gave enjoyable performances, and have made a huge impression on me. I'll definitely seek out more movies with them. I hope you have fun watching this movie, I sure did.",1292371200,,932,4.2897727272727275
2218887,4,B0007LLOZ2,"THE WHITE DRAGON

Despite what others may think this is not the 1968 version at all, in fact that one had a male White Dragon. In the case of this film the Dragon title goes to the lovely Cecilia Cheung, so as you can see this is a different film. Now with that said I can tell you that this is a very fun film and you should know that going in. I have been around some people expecting this to be some epic because of the cover art. Needless to say they were surprised but they did indeed enjoy once they got that it was a comedy.

Black Pheonix (Cecilia Cheung) is just another girl at just another school worrying about average girl stuff. You know friends, herself, and of course boys, one in particular that is, the young prince. Of course she starts to develop a relationship with him when see notices that she has developed acne. As all of this is happening the schools principal is killed in the middle of the night by an assassin, an assassin named ""CHICKEN FEATHERS"".

Yes with an intimidating name like that how can one not shiver at the mere sound of a cluck. Any way the first White Dragon is wounded by this assassin and hands the powers of such title over to Pheonix. She eventually learns to love the new abilities she possesses and starts to use them well, until she is called upon. What is she asked to do you might ask, well take out Chicken Feathers of course. So she is off to do battle with him and thus the battle ensues and it is a good one, until. Until her leg is broken in the fight and he takes her in, that is right he takes her in to care for her. This is were the film gets excellent as they go back and forth one upping each other or trying to. The film blossoms from there making it a comedy with a little romance and a whole lot of treachery [you'll see].

This is a very fun flick full of humor and some good action as well, more so on the humor part but still good. There are all kinds of pop culture references and a very excellent download bar when she gets her powers, I am telling the truth [I love it]. Also did I mention that the deadly assassin Chicken Feathers is blind, yes very much so but that adds to a lot of the relationship between him and White Dragon. There are moments when the film slows do a little but for the most part it is a cool flick.

Cecilia Cheung is delightfully bubbly at times and very angry teen at others, a nice mix that plays out better than it sounds. Francis Ng is great as Chicken Feathers [keep wanting to type fingers] and is deadly/goofy/funny and all that in this role. Written by director Wilson Yip and Yiu Fai Lo the film is not perfect but if you go in understating its style you will like it. ""The White Dragon"" or ""Fei hap siu baak lung"" is an enjoyable movie that non fans should find the humor in. of course it could just be I like silly flicks like this, I don't know.",1283904000,4,2856,4.148014440433213
2218888,4,B0007LLOZ2,"I expected an action movie, but this is a hongkong action teen love story. It's a comedy with a ton of visual takes and a heart warming story to boot. I was disappointed at first, having expected an action flick, but once I gave it a chance, actually enjoyed it. Not a bad movie. Check it out some time.",1266278400,,303,4.1525423728813555
2218899,5,B0007LLOZ2,"I love this movie!  This is a very touching story, great humor, and fight scenes.

Now the problem with the negative critics, is that they are comparing martial arts movies.  You don't compare martial arts movies.  Its either you like the movie or you don't.  Actually thats the problem with lots of critics... they compare one movie to another.  Everything has its good and bad and everything is good or bad depending on your likes and dislikes.

2218900,3,B0007LLOZ2,"This movie is not your ordinary kung fu action movie. It is a little ""campy"" in that it does not try to be realistic at all. One scene has an old lady ""downloading"" her powers to a younger woman and a Microsoft Windows 95-like icon appears as the powers transfer from one to the other. If you are looking for kung fu action, this is not it, but if you are looking for fun, you might like this one.",1238457600,,397,4.037974683544304
2218901,3,B0007LLOZ2,"Fun movie, has some wire-fu.  Decent fight scenes.  Story line is sort of weak and kind of cheesy.",1232323200,,98,4.388888888888889
2218902,3,B0007LLOZ2,"Okay, from about the second I turned this movie on I said ""what the hell?""

The English dub starts out with basically a valley girl accent that doesn't appear to fit the movie whatsoever. The movie then goes from bad to worse, with something approximating the Chinese equivalent of a US high school, but set who-knows-when...

The problem with the movie isn't so much the movie itself (though it's pretty bad, if you're not prepared for what it actually is)... The problem is that it's marketed all wrong. By comparing the movie to House of Flying Daggers, a certain expectation is set up that the movie in no way shape or form lives up to.

The bottom line on this movie is that it's largely a satire on the martial arts genre. That's fine and all, but attempting to mask that and make the promotional text on the package make it seem like it's in the realm of other high class, artistic, well-written, and moreover SERIOUS martial arts dramas is disingenuous at the minimum.

If the packaging had made clear that this is a SPOOF of the martial arts genre, I would be less upset about purchasing it. In fact, I WOULD HAVE PURCHASED IT just for that (as I happened to be looking for decent spoofs at the time).

So, I guess what I'm upset about is that the movie isn't what the box says it is.

Now, getting past that, the movie actually has a few rather funny moments (a ""power transfer bar,"" the whole scene rewinding when the heroine asks someone to repeat herself, etc.)... But it's also mixed up with a romantic storyline that tries to be slightly serious. Unfortunately, that puts it at odds with the comedy, and I don't really think it works. If it's going to be funny, and a bit slapstick, it should be funny throughout and not try to redeem itself with romantic drama, etc.

2218903,4,B0007LLOZ2,"Many reviewers seemed to have missed the point of this movie. I'm not an expert on the genre but I've seen enough to recognize a send up when I see it. I assume a good bit of the nuance may be lost in cultural translation. I got the same feeling I often have watching Japanese movies: that some basic background ideas that are culture-based are just not available to me.

Other reviews have gone into great details on the plot and such but not given a clear idea of why this movie is such a strange mix. It's really full of quotations and references to other movies. Space Balls probably (actually does) seem pretty stupid if you're not a fan of Star Wars and I'm sure this movie seems pretty stupid (especially if your sense of humor is out to lunch) if you're not a fan of those super serious kung fu movies (that do, for that matter seem a bit silly from the outside with all that flying around on wires and stuff.)

I enjoyed this one beginning to end precisely because once I latched on to the fact that the whole thing was being made as a (somewhat lost in translation) joke I ""got it."" I think the scene at an ancient Chinese (name of major international coffee chain with a round green logo here) cafe was pretty much a tip off.  My take is that the blind fighter isn't a COPY of some other movie's character. Rather it's poking affectionate fun at the conventions of the genre. The same with the over-the-top wire work. This is not a cheap knock-off of the crouching dragon crowd, it's an homage. And, please!, any movie in which our powerful heroine's primary concern is getting rid of zits is OBVIOUSLY not to be taken completely seriously.

Beyond that, the acting, particularly for the two main characters was quite charming and conveyed some very real and moving emotions. I am lazy and watch the English dubbing usually but the subtlety and expression on these actors' faces shines through powerfully. Their work gave an element of reality and believability to the ""romantic"" part of romantic comedy. It's also quite nice to look at. The actors are either beautiful or interesting, the settings are both and the clothing is nothing to sneeze at either.  Nice colors.

All in all, if you are familiar with other froth-at-the-mouth serious movies in this category, if you're equipped with some sense of humor, if you can tolerate or even enjoy a quite nice romance between the traditional mismatched couple created by two excellent actors and yes, if you like fights in bamboo forests this is a good movie to see. Plus, as other reviewers pointed out, it's nice that for once everyone isn't dead or broken-hearted at the end.",1193961600,,2638,4.590233545647559

2218907,5,B0007LLOZ2,"I never expected to discover a martial arts film that was funny. This film is humorous and contains satire along with tremendously effective martial arts scenes. There is a great story line and plot, a romantic love triangle with some tension, beautiful scenery, and great cinematography with long shots of fighting in a bamboo forest, along with very creative photography of fight scenes looking down from the bamboo trees onto the fighters. At times, there is the feeling of a video game in progress because occasionally the acting is somewhat exaggerated to emphasize a specific scene, plus there is the insertion of two crossed swords onto the screen, prior to or during a fight. The music within this film is most enjoyable. Different musical styles accompany various scenes which enhances the feeling and sensitivity of the moment. There is Spanish flamenco music, classical music, some Mediterranean Italian sounding music, and extraordinairy flute playing throughout the film.

The characters are developed with great style and creativity. There is Phoenix Black, a pretty and talented female student who plays two musical instruments, the flute and the lute, and dances very sensitively and provocatively. By chance she encounters the blind assassin in the forest, who hears her flute music and is captivated both by her music as well as her fighting skills. Although the assassin is viewed as a criminal, in reality he is doing a service for the community because he only kills corrupt people ... He also shares whatever bounty he collects with the poor.

Phoenix encounters the assassin again at her school where Auntie, the cleaning lady (who in reality is a great fighter) ends up nearly being defeated by the assassin. This great elderly lady martial artist's name includes the word ""Dragon"". She suffered near fatal injuries during her fight with the blind assassin, she fears she is dying and quickly downloads her special powers to Phoenix who then becomes ""The White Dragon"". Phoenix fights the assassin on the school grounds where the assassin is even more impressed by her skills and effective powers/techniques. It turns out, the assassin had a goal: to kill the principal of the school who was discovered to have been harassing the female students in a most personal way. The principal signed a confession to this misdeed before he was killed.

The students are in an uproar after learning their principal was killed. Two rival cliques of female students huddle together discussing the strange events of the night before. The cook at the school, named Gene, provides some humourous insights into how it is known when the blind assassin strikes. Gene reveals his discovery that there are always chicken feathers left at every crime where the assassin has struck. Gene has studied the matter thoroughly. He even names the types of chickens whose feathers are floating in the air, after the assassin has sruck.

After Phoenix plays the lute and performs a very beautiful sensual Chinese dance, she captures the attention of the local King's son, Prince Tian Yong. His father rules the territory and they want to bring the assassin to justice. She has a date with the Prince where besides playing the lute and flute for him, they play tennis and roller skate. Eventually, Phoenix ends up fighting the blind assassin and during one highly stylized martial arts encounter, she fractures a leg. The assassin takes pity on her and brings her to his home located on a beautiful lake. When she plays her flute, he falls in love with her. The blind assassin makes her food, creates crutches for her and even builds a wheelchair from wood. She acts petulant and spoiled. She tricks him into buying paper, pen, and ink which she uses to write letters to Prince Tian that are sent by carrier pigeon. She explains her absence with a white lie, telling him she is on tour performing with the school's music and dance troupe. Eventually, her heart is awakened to the plight of the blind assassin and she wants to know how he became blind. She develops empathy toward him after learning his story which is very sad, sensitive and touching.

Despite her tender feelings toward the blind assassin, the plot thickens. Through a highly crafted story-line and via well developed scenes, Phoenix manages to escape from the blind assassin. The assassin is captured by the army of the local warlord/king. Phoenix is torn between trying to save the life of the blind assassin who had treated her so well during captivity or to resume the romance with Prince Tian, who inherited the throne from his father. Prince Tian has become the local ruler - his plans are clear: the blind assassin must be put to death for his crimes. The suspense and drama is immense as Phoenix is forced to choose between the blind assassin and her boyfriend, now the ruler of the realm. Amazingly, chicken feathers provide the the major clue to helping Phoenix resolve her personal conflict and they play a major role in saving the life of the blind assassin. This is a most highly recommended film. Erika Borsos [pepper flower]",1174867200,4,5099,4.938228438228438

When her beauty fades because she gets the power of the White Dragon, her mentor and former White Dragon tells her the only way to get her beauty restored is to do good deeds... aka rob from the rich and give to the poor. Upon doing this, she decides also to face the man who killed her principal and tried to kill her mentor, Chicken Feathers. She plays her flute for him and he always comes. He is a great fighter... but blind. When they fight the third time (I think), Chicken Feathers brakes White Dragon's leg... accidently but hillariously. So, Chicken Feathers takes White Dragon in his care. She is bossy and hateful to him. Still, he tries to take care of her and please her. What unfolds is laughs and even heartaching times... as he falls for her but she is in love with the Second Prince of her kingdom a man Chicken Feathers is supposed to kill. What will happen?!?!?! I can't tell you or I will ruin it all for you.

I will say it is a romantic comedy and it will have you laughing, crying, and feeling good by the end.

The White Dragon simply does not offer that. Instead, it offers a light story with silly jokes and fairy tale ending that one can smile upon. One doesn't have to think hard to understand the situation. I personally love this movie. I am someone who wants to smile after I watch a movie, not cry or feeling depressed because of a sad scene.

The hero is an airhead, childish, and spoiled girl, but happens to have a golden heart. She is not a mature character like the main characters of Hero and HoFD. From this comparison alone, one should be able to think the kind of difference this movie has compared to the other popular martial art movie that comes to the US.

The picture and background are not as pretty as HoFD or Hero's. But the movie still offers a great scenery you will find in China only. And yes, you can still see people flying over the roof or tall trees as they swing their swords around.",1141862400,,1052,4.417525773195877
2218913,3,B0007LLOZ2,"In the tradition of The House of Flying Daggers, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and Hero, this movie IS NOT! I rented White Dragon on the recommendation from a friend who knew I loved the three previously mentioned movies. I am so glad I rented it. That's four bucks I'll never see again! But at least it wasn't twenty from purchasing this little masterpiece of disaster.

Okay, it wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen. But it didn't deliver what I was expecting. Basically, it did make me chuckle a bit from time to time, as I asume/hope it was meant to do. Some things were down right hockey. Like ""Downloading"" your skills into someone else's brain and a progress bar shows up at the bottom of the screen. Meant to be funny? Perhaps. But it came off as absolutely hockey.

Technically, the movie was obviously low budget. Some of the effects were certainly lacking, but not all together horrible. Some of the fight scenes were meant to be smooth and flowing and ended up a bit choppy. Especially the last scene that should have established the whole movie. More care should have been put into that scene above all and it seemed to be the worst battle scene of the entire movie.

Okay, now for the acting. There are two main characters. Chicken feathers, the blind assassin, and White Dragon, his counterpart. I assume the script was a bit weak, but the acting of the blind assassin certainly didn't help with this shortcoming. White Dragon has successfully been in some higher caliber movies and can certainly act. This movie was not her best ever performance.

I have to say, however, that after all of this, I am glad I saw this Movie. Why? Well, I am not totally sure. In a strange way, in the back of my mind, I found it nothing more than a bit comical. Even the ending was just too weak.

2218915,4,B0007LLOZ2,"Perhaps the one flaw with ""wire-fu"" movies is that they tend to take themselves too seriously -- humor is pretty much absent from movies like ""Hero"" or ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."" That isn't a problem with ""White Dragon,"" a humorous little action/romance flick that never quite gets serious. Not too much, anyway.

Black Pheonix (Cecilia Cheung) is an average airhead schoolgirl -- she thinks about her looks, school, clothes, her looks, the handsome second prince, and her looks. But when the aged hero White Dragon (Nay Suet) is injured, she bestows her powers on Black Pheonix. And a bad case of acne, which White Dragon assures her can be cured by doing good deeds.

Pheonix is starting to enjoy her heroic alter ego -- White Dragon Jr. -- when she is called on to capture the blind assassin Chicken Feathers (Francis Ng). But she breaks her leg during the fight, and to her surprise, Chicken Feathers brings her to his home and nurses her back to health. Now Pheonix must make a choice -- save the blind outlaw, or wed the hunky prince?

When watching this film, do not take it seriously, unless it wants to be taken seriously. The first half of it is an unabashed joke -- where else could you see an ancient Chinese musician smash her lute, while the audience does the wave? McDonald's, baseball, designer handbags, and Latin pop tunes all get name-dropped over the course of the movie. And when Pheonix gets her powers, a downloading bar appears on the bottom of the screen.

The plot sags a bit when Pheonix and Chicken Feathers spend time together at his cottage, and you start wondering when the plot will get moving again. And when it does, some of the humour has gone, as a broken-spirited Chicken Feathers wanders aimlessly through the town. Then it kicks into high gear again, with assassination plots, whirling fight scenes, and a pleasant finale where everything falls into place at last.

While there are moments that smack of cutesiness, like the ""my only weak spot is you"" line, the love triangle is a remarkably sweet one -- both Chicken Feathers and the prince are nice guys, and it's easy to see how Pheonix would be torn between them. And some twists are unusually sweet ones, such as the idea of Pheonix's flute music allowing Chicken Feathers to ""see"" the stars.

Cheung is the star as a girlish, selfish airhead, who is unexpectedly called on to be a hero -- a sort of selfish Robin Hood (""Please don't scar my face!""), who throws tantrums when she doesn't get her way. Her Pheonix is enormous fun just to watch. But she can also play a more poignant part. And both Ng and Lei Liu give wonderful performances as the rival lovers.

Pop-culture martial-arts are the order of the day in ""White Dragon,"" an unabashedly silly comedy that also turns in some poignant romance and solid action.",1138492800,9,2817,4.690283400809717
2218916,4,B0007LLOZ2,"Okay...the movie is so historically inaccurate it's not even funny...but it's a riot of laughs!

If you can deal with the screwing of proper history to enjoy the humor it's a great movie.  If your not one to enjoy movies where history is bended around and messed with, this film is not for you!

They have all sorts of terminology that doesn't exist back then.  Broadband, narrowband, downloads, and a cute little file transfer image!  :P.

I admit, being Chinese, this movie was a bit of a surprise.  Not the typical thing you'd see released in the US.  Though I'd have to note, you need to be secure in your own feelings to your cultural heritage, if your Chinese, otherwise you'd likely just end up really unhappy about how they butchared Chinese history and proper timeline structure.

Great as it is though...the movie seems to trail off and lose it's humor as it moves on and becomes a surreal comedy-serious thing-a-ma-blob.",1137888000,,931,4.732919254658385
2218917,5,B0007LLOZ2,"The basic story here is of a young lady who has a bad case of vanity and then comes to understand what really matters in life - she learns to see things in a new way.

This movie is both set in the past and also is present day - it is both very silly and profound - its kind of b-movie-ish yet really beautiful in its message that it tells. I've noticed some people here complain somewhat about the second half where it gets alittle serious. But that is part of the wonderful balance of this story. It needed to take a break from the comedy alittle to show the sincerity and soul of these characters.

Simply put 'The White Dragon' is a wacky & wonderful movie that doesn't take itself so seriously. Cecilia Cheung and Francis Ng are good together - watching them is a real hoot!

So, for all those who missed the point of this strange but fun movie and think badly of it, i would suggest to lighten up and give it another try!

'White Dragon' is just a very cool - kind of different movie.",1137542400,,990,4.167539267015707
2218918,5,B0007LLOZ2,This movie went far beyond the expectations that I had for it. It has action in it but this movie is a comedy. If you want hard core action go find a different movie but if you want a good movie that will make you laugh then this is the one for you.,1121817600,,249,3.7169811320754715
8048391,4,B0007LLOZ2,"Kinda goofy, silly, sweet in places. Lots of wire fu and lots of scenes where stuff happens that doesn't really make sense. Pretty much the Chinese version of Zatoichi in a lot of ways, I mean a blind assassin with a sword inside his walking stick, oh yeah. I enjoyed it, not the greatest film ever but if you watch a lot of this stuff like I do it is far from the worst. Meh, I'll give it a 4 just because Celia is so cute and the Chicken Feathers character is has so clearly watched Shintaro Katsu and copied a lot of his behaviors to make his blindness believable.",1524268800,,567,4.163636363636364
