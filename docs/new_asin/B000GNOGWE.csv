2615549,5,B000GNOGWE,"Excellent!  This series was created over a period of +4 years so you can see the actors grow up along with their characters behavior.

Also suggest buying Black Orpheous to fully understand a couple of scenes used in the series.",1178668800,,228,4.675
2615550,5,B000GNOGWE,"This Brazilian tv series tells an interesting series of stories about life growing up in the slums of Rio de Janeiro.  If you saw the movie City of God, you'll recognize some of the actors from the movie as characters in this series.  If you've ever been to Rio or have an interest in Brazil, the series seems to capture a bit of the spirit of the Brazilian people.

The movie was great, and the shows are about as good but with significantly less violence.  Many of the episodes are heartwarming or moving.  The stories are different enough that they don't get dull or trite.  The only problem I have with the series collection is that I don't have enough time to watch all the episodes.",1176163200,,688,4.420634920634921
2615551,5,B000GNOGWE,"The acting is engaging, the episodes are well-written and beautifully filmed and the character development is second to no other television show or film I've ever seen.  Throughout the series there is an unprecedented blend of drama and humor that is sublimely touching.

 After a few episodes you will find yourself thinking about the characters as if you know them personally, especially the incredibly multi-faceted main characters Acerola and Laranjinha.  You will find yourself feeling a complete spectrum of emotion as you follow the two boys through agonizing challenges and life lessons that are often used as a vehicle of social commentary about Brazilian political and social structures.  This commentary is delivered in a variety of original ways including interviews with real people cut right into the middle of story-lines and unscripted interactions between the show's actors filmed in a documentary style.

In addition to the fantastic character development there is equally impressive development of setting.  There were times I felt I was running right along with the characters through the rough, disorienting, labyrinth of a neighborhood they live in.  The distance between you on your couch and the environment on your television screen will never feel smaller than it does while watching City of Men.

All of that said, there are times where the seemingly insurmountable challenges Acerola and Laranjinha face feel formulaic and there are a couple episodes that are noticeably less enjoyable than the others because of inexplicable plot developments and inconsistencies, to the point where at times I was wondering if I had missed episodes. (One episode ends with one of the boys stating, ""We never saw him again..."", about a character who appears in the very next episode.)  Also, if you find yourself as immersed in Acerola and Laranjinha's lives as I did, the last episode will feel like a bit of a slap in the face.

All in all this series is well worth the 13 odd hours you will spend watching.  At it's worst it is wildly entertaining and evocative and at it's best it transcends it's medium to directly enhance your core understanding of society, privilege, oppression (mainly of poor people by government establishments), and the fundamental experiences, (love, friendship, work, pride, hardship, fear, the search for identity and meaning) that we all share.",1168387200,12,2388,5.222513089005235
2615552,5,B000GNOGWE,"City of Men is the story of best friends growing up in an especially interesting neighborhood, where one mistake could be your last. Through their teenage years, Acerola (Douglas Silva) and Laranjinha (Darlan Cunha) learn how to handle responsibility, make the right choices and break through cultural barriers.

I found their stories fascinating, filled with real-life insight and lessons learned through on the edge of your seat realistic experience. Some of the ways they escape from danger is to keep out of the way of those in power, trying to find real jobs and stay in school.

In one episode Acerola and Laranjinha must find a way to get back home with medication or a relative will die. Since at times access is denied in various locations due to internal struggles between warring factions, the boys have to figure out a way to get through the barriers.

The housing is mostly in a shantytown setting, but the story expands as the plot thickens and the boys work in the city, spend time surfing at the beach and go on outings to fly kites with new friends. They even take bus trips out of town to visit politicians and film their journey.

You wouldn't expect a TV series filled with violent neighborhoods to be heartwarming, humorous, adventurous and completely captivating but Acerola and Laranjinha will truly steal your heart. Even with the few scenes of violence, I felt that nothing seemed gratuitous, but more in line with a very in-depth character study of two boys growing up in an especially violent world. Everything that happens to the two boys is in direct correlation with what will happen next or what they will encounter and overcome.

The struggle for survival is always apparent, although money seems to flow freely in the favela. Whether the boys are earning money from making popsicles or trying to keep a job, they learn important life-changing lessons. The grandmothers in the family are very influential, but the fathers seem to be absent most of the time. Laranhihna and Acerola feel the absence of a father figure in their lives and often comment about how they wish they had someone there to teach them how to live. This was heartbreaking but enlightening.

Acerola is faced with the greatest challenges and the way he embraces his life choices and grows up to be a responsible man is truly inspiring. My favorite scene is when Acerola and Cristiane are dancing at the prom with their newborn baby between them. It is such a beautiful moment and really does explore the depths of the love between Acerola and Cristiane who must overcome incredible hurdles to be together and survive.

Throughout there is humor, family struggles, competition between residents and major problems are solved through creative involvement of the citizens. The last episode seems to be a playful mix of cartoons and surprises.

This should probably be rated at least R for the club scenes (sensual dancing), violence (realistic shooting scenes), sexual language and brief sensual encounters that mostly hint at sexual situations. While these things do occur, they seem to be brief and don't seem to distract too much from the main story.

2615553,5,B000GNOGWE,"Cidade dos Homens is one of those shows that breaks your heart and at the same makes you feel like there's hope for some of the world's poorest people, os favelados in Brasil.

Cidade dos Homens (City Of Men) follows the two young men, Acerola and Laranjinha, as they live, survive and hustle in the favela. It's obvious that the boys are mischievous, and they get into many a scrape, but it's also clear that the boys have good hearts.

The cast of characters and life lessons taught and shown in the series bring a face to the suffering of the people in the favelas. When Espeto's girlfriend waits in line all night just to get her boyfriend a job sweeping streets, only to have him be turned down because he cannot read and write (as Espeto astutely points out: Why do I need to know how to read and write to sweep the streets?), we can see the chokehold bureaucracy and incompetence have on Brazilians.

Despite all these obstacles and roadblocks, Cidade dos Homens(City of Men) is full of smiles, joyful moments and lots of great music. It's a coming of age story, albeit one with a slightly different perspective.",1161043200,17,1119,4.557213930348259
2615554,4,B000GNOGWE,"I have to admit I didn't enjoy this show as much as I thought I would. I'm not denying that the fact that Douglas Silva and Darlan Cunha possess true talent; it's just that the show can get quite silly at times. All in all,it's an interesting view of life in Brazil. There is no false glamour about this series; everything is presented in a very direct manner.",1159833600,2,360,4.3088235294117645
2615555,5,B000GNOGWE,"The series covers the same ground (the slums of Rio in Brazil) as the film City of God, but with different characters (two street-wise boys). The episodes are extremely stylized, shot with ""reality"" style hand-camera work, ocassionally mixed with animation, and often utilizing fast-paced and clever editing. The characters and their urban plight are portrayed with humor and serious heart--Better than any U.S. inter-city ghetto stuff I've seen. Episodes currently playing on the Sundance channel if you want to check it out before investing in the DVDs, which are not as of yet distributed in the U.S.",1144540800,,603,5.22680412371134
2615556,5,B000GNOGWE,"This dvd series is a follow up, or perhaps prelude, to city of god.  This series takes a much more in depth look at the slums and ways of life therein.  Enthralling to anyone interested in the slightest way about different cultures, and even if not, the storylines are incredibly realistic, almost like ""Seinfeld,"" in the way that it deals with the every day life of the occupants of the slums, though unlike ""Seinfeld,"" this is intellegent and thought provoking.  Gives a whole new perspective on community, power, and all the other things that make the world go round, at least in the colloquial sense.  It also shines a very bright light on the perception of the divergence between the different reigons of the hills and city below.  If you're tired of Hollywood's shallow high budget box office ""smashers"", give this a try.  It's as refreshing as an ice water after a good run from two hungry dobermen through twenty parking lots on a cloudless summer afternoon.",1132876800,2,966,4.754491017964072
2615557,5,B000GNOGWE,The product arrived so fast even thought it was labor day week end. Thank you soo much. It is great quality and a great seller.,1284076800,,127,4.12
2615558,5,B000GNOGWE,"Once you watch once, you can't stop.  I was hesistant at first to watch the shows because City of God was so very violent and I wasn't mentally prepared for another like that (even though the movie was great).  However, these shows are more subtle in the violence and have a lot of humor.  Primarily, the two main characters and the supporting actors are so engaging.  You just want to keep watching them and watching them.  Great series.  Highly recommended.",1258156800,2,459,4.675
2615559,3,B000GNOGWE,"Of course, after seeing ""City of God"" , one the greatest movies ever made, I decided to buy the series ""City of Men"". In all, it was very good. I would like to say excellent but I think that the directors spoiled 2 of the episodes by showing lewd acts of dogs mating. This was an extreme turn off to me .I don't even know why they would spoil such a good how by adding something like that into the story. To me , this stupid act on the part of the directors to a great series from a 5 star rating to a 3 star rating. I know that they are trying to depict life in the favela but some things are unnecessary. Overall, not counting those 2 bad episodes, I enjoyed the other episodes in the series. Unfortunately, I would be able to buy this DVD as a gift as I intended in the begininng because of the offensive scenes in those two episodes.",1245283200,2,837,4.048192771084337
2615560,5,B000GNOGWE,This series is great! If you enjoyed the movie you will love the TV series!,1243987200,,75,4.066666666666666
2615561,5,B000GNOGWE,"This series does not follow the exact story or timeline as the movie City Of God but it takes place in Rio de Janeiro in the Favela. I was entertained and pleased with the acting, cinematography, and realness. I almost felt that I was there and I could have been there in my younger years.",1203552000,,289,4.2727272727272725
2615562,5,B000GNOGWE,"This is an amazing brazlian production where you can have an excellent idea of the ""favela"" reality.

It worths every penny!",1188604800,,124,4.904761904761905
2615563,5,B000GNOGWE,"The movie is about two teenagers,Acerola and Laranjinha. Both are 13 yrs.old,although as you go further along the series,they progressively become older teenagers. They grow up in Rio de Janeiro's dangerous slum(called the favelas)where it is said that residents are lucky if they live up to the age of 20. The City of Men is an excellent comedy drama where humor is mixed with the harsh reality of an environment of crime,drugs,sex and instant death. The scenes as well as the sounds such as the gunshots are so realistic that one may wonder if he/she is watching an actual true-to-life high quality footage of a crime scene.
The two kid actors are so talented that you may be so engrossed with the movie that you'll begin to feel you are part of the scene following those two and sharing their fears,uneasiness,disappointments,risks and repugnance to the crimes they witness blending with their spirit,courage,
gentleness,compassion,humor and accomplishments. All of these reflected in a setting of poverty. You couldn't help but love these two kids as you go along and see them through the episodes. Brazilian Portuguese with English subtitles. Abssolutely 5 stars.",1188086400,,1168,5.152631578947369
2615564,5,B000GNOGWE,"This is the best way to show your kids that there is a different way to live besides the materialism that we are used to, and guess what, there is happiness there too, and lots of it.  Here you will see how two best friends grow in one of Rio de Janeiro`s favelas, and get face to face with gangs and drug traffic, poverty, sexuality, and family problems and manage to come up being great persons, maybe not to be wealthy, but good persons, and have lots of fun while facing all this.  This is the kind of TV product that should be shown to every student in every school in every first world country.  Parabens Acerola e Laranjinha",1187913600,,631,4.285714285714286
2615565,5,B000GNOGWE,"i don't want to repeat anything that's already been said but i just love this series so much i had to come on here and give it 5 stars. i'd give 100 if i could!

i watched the entire series over 3 days time and i would reccommend it to anyone of any age. it's just so entertaining, making you laugh, cry, learn and think. the actors who play acerola and laranjinha are extremely talented (and there are a lot of hot guys in the series - tons of eye-candy.)

the subtitles are great, the brazilian-portugese is an awesome language, so nice to listen to and you will probably inadvertently learn some while watching this!",1183334400,7,619,4.373913043478261
2615566,5,B000GNOGWE,"Huge fans of Fernando Mereilles and his masterpiece, City of God, will definitely enjoy this TV spin-off.  Set in the [same?] favela of Rio de Janeiro, the series follow the misadventures and growth of two friends who must deal with the harsh realities of poverty, drugs, love, and life.  The last time I saw a show this impressive and entertaining was with Judd Apatow's Freaks and Geeks.  City of Men however exceeds Freaks in that one is immersed in a nation's sensitive politics.  This for me is the show's biggest draw-- Mereilles and his crew have captured the look and feel of the favela such that one can feel the searing heat of the streets.

Could this be the greatest television program ever created?  One can make a strong argument that it may be so.  It has comedy, drama, action-- pretty much everything that made City of God an amazing movie to begin with.  Imagine seeing that for some 12 hours.  I highly recommend it.",1180483200,,935,4.618181818181818

8133626,4,B000GNOGWE,"It's an interesting novela, as it tries to show in each episode some aspect of life in Brazil: the hip-hop culture in SP, problems of the penitenciary system, teenage drug traffickers, etc.
My original goal for buying the series was to improve my Portuguese and I can say it did not help. The language they speak is the slang of the slums in the hills of Rio and it sounds very different from the Portuguese from Brazilian TV or Brazilian Portuguese classes.",1443657600,,458,4.597560975609756

8133629,5,B000GNOGWE,"I discovered this series when trying to find videos that would familarize me with Brazilian culture, a couple of months prior to my first work-related visit to this country. I rented the first DVD (first 7 episodes) through an online rental service, and I got hooked on it. In fact, my husband (who never watches TV) and I were both hooked, so much so that I eventually tracked it down on Amazon and ordered the series. This is a series made for television, but there is a full-length movie by the same title, featuring the two main actors and their characters at an older age. I haven't seen the movie, so this review addresses only the television series.

What makes this series so compelling is the feeling of authenticity that it conveys. It allows you to see how the main characters, two young male teens, experience joy, friendship, love, anger, fear, distrust, lust, insecurity, loyalty, prejudice, and betrayal in their day-to-day lives within the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Along the way, the viewer gains insights into how the history and culture of Brazil, as well as the physical and sociological landscapes of Rio de Janeiro, shape the identities, relationships, and aspirations of the young characters. At the same, universalities in human experience shine through.

By the way, when I went to Brazil, I spent a few days as a tourist in Rio, and was so glad that I had seen the first 7 episodes of this series before I went. It provided me with a much deeper appreciation of the city, compared to what I might have experienced had I not seen them. I was able to see details that otherwise I would have missed -- and I could interpret them in reference to what I had learned watching this series.

This series contains sexual and violent content which probably would be rated PG-13 in the U.S. However, this content is never gratuitous -- it always conveys important information that deepens the viewer's understanding of the experiences of the two central characters.

Individual episodes have different directors, so the presentation of visual and thematic content differs somewhat across episodes. This does not have a jarring effect, though, because there is so much contextual and narrative continuity. My personal favorite director (so far --- I haven't finished all the episodes yet) is Cesar Charlone -- his use of visual film collage is beautiful and emotive.

Many thanks to the people who conceptualized and produced this series!  It's a gift to the world.",1401753600,,2480,4.8649289099526065
8133630,5,B000GNOGWE,"This series is a fascinating charming thrilling fiction story of two fatherless kids who grow up in a favela and they help each other to become a greater people in life.

All the anecdotes they live on, all the sad and happy moments make this series a really precious one.

Laranjinna and Acerola simply steal hearts away. They are such innocent and have to face a real cruel world only armed with loyalty and friendship. How many times did I laugh or cry watching this videos? No idea.

I just bought having seen the film first. The series explains the ""before"", and it's friendlier, happier than the obscure (and great) movie!

A must, a must, if you like the favela culture in movies (and even if you don't).",1351468800,,711,4.53125
8133631,5,B000GNOGWE,"Wonderful series, it reveals a part of Rio that people are afraid of because of the Stereotype of the Favela in Rio. Rio de Janiero is slated as being a Racial Democracy when in actuality it is far from that. Black people in Rio are not seen nor heard of. This series shows the reality of being black in Brazil, yet you cannot help but fall in love with these characters and become part of their family. Enjoy this series!!",1305244800,,423,4.3
8133632,5,B000GNOGWE,"Love it love it love it :)It is the tv series of the movie City of Men, which sums up the entire series. I got hooked with City of God - though it is not the same story, it is the story about the survival of the youth in Rio's favelas. (Similar to City of God, but different time period - with some of the same actors). Subtitles run fast on the series as I don't think it was intended to be released internationally.",1300320000,,417,3.9761904761904763

This 3-disc set is a winner.  I liked it as much as the original movie.  Finishing the show is like losing a good friend (or two)!",1296691200,,352,4.303030303030303

Each episode is about half an hour long and will take you on an emotional journey. I laughed, cried, got scared and was at the edge of my seat pretty much for every single episode. Douglas Silva and Darlan Cunha are brilliant actors!

The only problem I had with the product is that it folds out so that each dvd is on its own 'page' but there is no ""case"" or ""cover"" as with box sets.

Amazon's free shipping was fast and extremely efficient!
