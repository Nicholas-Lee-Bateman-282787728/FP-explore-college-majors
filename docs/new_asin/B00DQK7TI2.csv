5847435,5,B00DQK7TI2,"The film ""The Devil Rides Out"" is an example of how when Hammer does it right, it does it exceedingly well. Based on Dennis Wheatley's occult-themed novel, the film was directed by Terence Fisher and the screenplay was written by Richard Matheson. It is one of my all-time favorite occult films and rich in visuals and sense of atmosphere. Unfortunately, as much as I love the film, I can't quite justify paying such a high price for the film, Blu-Ray or not, and will just have to patiently wait for it to be released on a Region 1 DVD and hopefully at a more affordable price. One can only hope.

The story focuses on the Duc de Richleau, Nicholas (played by Christopher Lee) who discovers that the friend of a son, Simon (Patrick Mower) is involved in the occult and ends up in the classic good vs. evil duel to the end with charismatic and evil Mocata (Charles Gray who delivers an amazing performance as a manipulative Satanist). Wonderful performances all around and a must-see.",1432512000,4,984,4.622857142857143

5847437,5,B00DQK7TI2,Great film. Fun and interesting. Of course it is typical Hammer Horror. Just not willing to pay $50 for a blu-ray! I'm sure the price will drop.,1410134400,3,144,4.37037037037037
8596362,5,B00DQK7TI2,In agreement with everyone. This is by-far one of Christopher Lee's finest performances showing his incredible dramatic range. You actually feel 'safe when he's on the screen.,1507161600,,175,5.518518518518518

8596365,5,B00DQK7TI2,"I really do like this film (& the book). OK, so it is old fashioned but then again, so am I. I saw this on BBC2 when I was growing up & I can assure you, this re-mastered Blu-Ray edition is as good if not better. It is almost timeless though of course, maybe not as PC as things are meant to be in the 21st Century. It is from the last century: Only a fool would judge something from years gone by by todays values. Sadly, such folk are real (more real than the devil in the ""Effects"" of this film) & this in really not for them. If you like a good old, slightly dated classic, this is for you. I loved it. Then again, I still watch Alec Guinness films too. You pays your money etc..",1469232000,6,683,3.920863309352518

8596367,4,B00DQK7TI2,"Exercise caution when considering ""almost"" ALL of these Hammer horror titles from outside the states . The ones that have M and PG rating stickers in the lower left hand corner of the packaging are generally Region B . Meant for players in Great Britain and elsewhere but not the United States . By all means , if you have a region free player , alas I don't , carry on and go all in as the film's themselves are wonderful .",1458777600,,424,4.182926829268292
8596368,1,B00DQK7TI2,I was so happy to find this movie available on Blu-Ray but I tried to play it on my Blu-Ray player and it will not play.  I am so disappointed because I love this movie.  The seller should note in the product description that it isn't formatted for USA Blu-Ray players.  I have requested a refund from Amazon.,1452902400,6,309,4.293103448275862
