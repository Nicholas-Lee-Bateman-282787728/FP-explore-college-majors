3549758,5,B001ED3JEQ,"Although some of these stories may not be politically correct, they do bring up some teaching moments about how the world has changed for the better, and what wrong thinking and behavior is.  All in all, love the classics!",1351123200,3,222,4.6923076923076925
3549759,5,B001ED3JEQ,This was a great addition to my older cartoons collection.  It took me back to the 1950s and the cartoons used as fillers on some of the children's shows.,1327708800,,154,4.310344827586207
3549760,3,B001ED3JEQ,I was disappointed that there was only one Bosko cartoon on this disc. And NO Peanut Butter Sandwiches! I had seen the Porky Pig cartoon on TV.,1316995200,,143,4.333333333333333
3549761,5,B001ED3JEQ,"These cartoons were old when my mother was a girl and not made just for children. They would pop up off and on when I was a kid and I enjoyed the novelty of them, most are very funny. Some are just sweet and pretty. Well worth owning.",1270512000,27,234,3.8958333333333335
3549762,5,B001ED3JEQ,If you are looking for a time machine then this is a great avenue to take.  If you are looking for a bit of American history you will find it here! If you are looking to laugh your ass off then you will not be disappointed!  The cartoons in this collection are OLD and have been RESTORED; so if you are young and AVITAR is what you are looking for then this is NOT for you!  If you are politically Correct then KEEP MOVING because you will probably need you meds after watching these!  Great Fun and NOT politically Correct!  Did I mention that they were great fun!,1267920000,100,565,4.194444444444445

3549776,5,B001ED3JEQ,Enjoyed this collection of 1930s cartoons. They were cute and  clever. The Betty Boop cartoon was a bit risque. She was definately not created with children as the target audience. Neither was the Betty Boop inspired female in  The Farmerette.,1459123200,2,243,5.05

3549799,5,B001ED3JEQ,"I remember as a kid these old cartoons. Waited until I was in my sixties before I started to look for em. Wow, found them, brings back many memories. Never thought I'd find them.  A lot different from the stuff of today but very talented artist in their day. I'd recommend these to any cartoon buff that interested in seeing how it all got started.  Thanks amazon.",1388448000,13,364,4.417910447761194
3549800,3,B001ED3JEQ,"I luv all these vintage toons, the price was right & they arrived promptly.  Unfortunatley, the seller's description wasn't as forthcoming as it could've been.  Most of these cartoons look like watching an old film, complete w/lines, etc.  A few of them that are color (as indicated by the credits for the particular toon) are in B&W.  I would've still made the purchase if I had this info, as I luv classic animation and it was a great price.  A little more honesty would be appreciated on the description, though.",1373760000,7,515,4.677777777777778

3549802,5,B001ED3JEQ,"very good,,,,my grand son thought they sucked. i told him that back in my young days this is what we watched on our black and white tv that got 3 channels..he just couldn't beleive it",1365724800,3,183,4.257142857142857
3549803,5,B001ED3JEQ,"Younger viewers may be interested to see what animation was like before computers and indeed before
Hanna Barbera.  For mature viewers who actually remember seeing these cartoons as children it is a
charming trip down memory lane.  As a person in the latter category, I thoroughly enjoy watching these
early examples of animation.  It's a glimpse into the past.",1359849600,5,361,5.084745762711864
8297821,1,B001ED3JEQ,"Piss poor reproduction. And the cartoons are the very, very early ones for these characters. It's cheap, but still, don't waste your money.",1525564800,,139,5.086956521739131

8297826,3,B001ED3JEQ,"Some of these are old, some ancient. There were done when cartoons were funny and clever. The animation isn't great, and the stories are simple, but enjoyable. My biggest objection is that at least one (and I suspect others) were done in color but are shown in black and white. Add to that, the transfer is poor quality -some appear to be from vhs and others could have been tv broadcasts that were recorded.

Despite that, it isn't bad, just not great.",1516406400,,453,4.524390243902439
8297827,3,B001ED3JEQ,"Alpha Video/Oldies.com, the maker of this dvd is never known to produce high quality transfers.  However, absent availability from other more capable and better sources, this will do. It's quality you can live if you don't mind transfers that are way under the threshold of being a decent transfer. The cartoons themselves are fun to watch and would have been nice to keep for archival purposes if they were cleaned up to high grade quality. 3 stars, I think is generous.",1509235200,,471,4.814814814814815
