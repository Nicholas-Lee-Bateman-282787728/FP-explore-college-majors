4021871,5,B002ZG9774,"I personally loved this movie of Cher and Christina Aguilera. I feel that both have great chemistry together in the screen, and were correctly chosen to star in this very good movie. Christina plays a small town woman who is determined to make it big in Hollywood, and she sees her golden ticket when spotting the burlesque club. Cher takes her under her wing and is pleasantly suprised to see the singing and dancing talent that springs forth. I love how the movie has many musical numbers and dances creatively weaved into it. In some of the scenes Christina basically sings how she is a good girl (while gyrating in some very glamorous and provocative outfits).  I mean this with both respect for Christina and Cher, but if that good girl musical number in the movie is any indicator of how she is in real-life then I would have to say that Christina probably has a wild and fun side to her good girl side as well. Cher successfully plays a self-confident mentor who helps teach her increased wisdom. The movie also includes a wonderful cast of gifted models and dancers. I also think that a good job was done in casting the actor who plays love interest of Christina Aguilera (the very handsome and talented Cam Gigandet). I felt compelled to watch the film more because of Cher starring in it, and knowing that it is a musical (I now have an interest in watching more musicals). I am very glad that I took a chance on this movie, and I am sure that many others are going to be happy too. The music and dancing in the movie is so memorable and enjoyable that it also sparked my interest to purchase the soundtrack. This is a good movie to watch if you love Cher, Christina Aguilera, and/or musicals.",1290729600,3,1703,4.493548387096774
4021872,5,B002ZG9774,"What a pleasant holiday weekend movie! The just released "" Burlesque"" written and directed by Steve Antin is just as predictable and traditional as a Thanksgiving dinner and just as good. You know how the story will end but that doesn't matter. Small-town girl leaves a nothing-job and goes to Los Angeles to make it big. And does she ever. Aging but ageless nightclub owner fights to keep her club open. Replaced entertainer gets vicious. Roommate becomes love object. Good triumphs over good business.

Where the boys are first: It's easy to believe that Jack, bartender/musician/hump (Cam Gigandet) is someone a girl can fall for, assuming he's straight. Then there's Stanley Tucci who plays Sean, a similar character to what he did so well in ""The Devil Wears Prada."" But the women are the big winners here. Tess, the burlesque club owner is played by-- thanks to the miracle of plastic surgery, along with good living-- the ageless Cher who proves once again that though she is no Meryl Streep, she does certain parts very well indeed. And although in her mid-sixties, she can still sing a very soulful ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me,"" which, by the way, could be the theme of her many goodbye tours. The movie belongs, however, to Christina Aguilera, brilliantly cast as Ali Rose, the girl from the cornfields who sets L. A. and the men in the club back on their heels. Can she ever both sing and dance as she does one great song after another. She will remind you at times of Marilyn Monroe. The film itself with all its precision dance routines is reminiscent of ""Chicago"" with a little bit of ""The Birdcage"" thrown in for the sake of diversity.

Good acting, good one-liners, wild costumes, fantastic acting and singing, old-fashioned love story. Who could ask for more? The soundtrack ought to be a keeper as well.",1290729600,2,1826,4.738993710691824
4021873,5,B002ZG9774,"My husband and I took our 16 year old granddaughter to see this movie.  We  all loved it!  It was pure entertainment and so refreshingly unvulgar.  We loved the singing and dance routines and didn't have to be embarrassed.  I was worried that it would be vulgar and sexually explicit, something that we have too much of these days, and how wonderful to see that a movie can be done without that junk!  The actors were very likeable and the story had a happy ending.  I can't wait for the DVD so we can watch it again and again, just like Pretty Woman.",1290729600,4,551,4.29126213592233
4021874,3,B002ZG9774,"With its title, I hoped to see a movie with some toughness, sleaze, grit.  Sex and violence are appropriate ingredients for the movies, especially those set in bump-and-grind clubs with available, young, and provocative women. You won't find it here.  ""Burlesque"" is a glitzy pop musical starring the rising young singer Christina Aguilera and the aging pop diva, Cher. The movie may be a little naughty in parts and a bit of a tease  -- but so was burlesque after all -- but it is mostly antiseptic and bland.

The story is set on Sunset Boulevard as Ali, a 20-something waitress from rural Iowa with a hardscrabble background but an unlikely aura of innocence relocates to Los Angeles in search of excitement and a better life. Ali chances upon a struggling, aging and anachronistic burlesque club jointly owned by a jaded old dancer, Tess, and her former husband. Ali has a drive to succeed and a gravelly belting voice like that of Etta James.  Ali spends some of her evenings alone, reading books about the history of burlesque and preparing for her chance. But in spite of some good moments, the story line is predictable. Ali works herself up to a lead role in the club under what becomes the mentoring of the seemingly hard-minded Tess. The movie is a coming-of-age story as well as Ali and a club bartender, an aspiring pop composer, begin what is for the most part a surprisingly sexless romance.

I thought Cher's acting was mostly wooden in her scenes with Tess.  She is better in her own vocal numbers, especially in a soliloquy of a song, ""You haven't seen the last of me"" late in the movie. She also is effective in her scenes with her wisecracking gay assistant (and former lover from long ago) Sean, played by Stanley Tucci. Some of the dance numbers and Aguilar's singing are effective in their way, but they are not sexual and they are little of burlesque. The brief scenes offering cameos of Los Angeles streets and cheap apartments help create an atmosphere. The movie could have used more of them.

The movie is an old-fashioned musical. Although modestly entertaining, it is bland and almost utterly wholesome and toothless.  Something more could be made of the subject.

3.5 stars.

4023156,5,B002ZG9774,"One of the absolute stupidest movies ever, worst dialogue, NOT actual burlesque at all, and omg Christina Aguilera is NOT cut out for sexy dancing and they REALLY have to invent ways to cover for her lack of dance skills. And..... Oh. My. Gawd. The ""sexy"" sex scene is the stupidest, most awkward, LEAST sexy, uninventive seduction EVER!! I mean I have literally never seen a dumber seduction sequence. ""Want to eat a box of cookies? I've got them, here, over my d__k!!"" Wtf??

But you know what, I am ADDICTED to this movie!! I watch it on repeat and make my poor husband insane. There are two songs in it I really like, the first one after they learn she can sing, ""I am a good girl"" or whatever it's called, and the following one, ""I'm a fast girl lookin for a guy who takes it slow,"" no flipping clue what the actual titles are!!!

Stanley Tucci is stellar, but that's no surprise because he's AWESOME at everything he does. Sad to see him doing such stupid dialog in some of the gut twistingly bad scenes, but, he's really great at the character he played. Cher is Cher. She's great, she does her thing, everybody knows her, not going to analyze her..... She's Cher.

So yeah, despite how much this darn movie suuuuucks, I'm addicted to it!!!",1498435200,,1247,4.4605263157894735

I've been an Amazon member since 1997 and it's my go-to place for discounted prices on almost everything. OK, end of my plug for Amazon.
Burlesque features two great Divas: Cher and Cristina Aguilera. I love the story of a small-town (but street savvy) girl that finds a home and makes good at Burlesque, an old-fashioned House of Burlesque. The dance numbers are fantastic. Cristina is an absolutely fantastic singer; when she first came on the scene, she was the only girl singer of all the pop princesses that came out at the same time: Britney, Mandy, Jessica. Cristina can actually sing and has an extremely powerful voice for such a small, petite woman. Cher is always fabulous and is wonderful as the mentor and boss to Cristina's character.

4023699,2,B002ZG9774,"Same recycled plot line as almost every rom com, and it touches on most of the cliches - small town girl trying to make it, she and a guy like each other but pretend not to at first and then have a miscommunication and OH NO! What if they don't get together?! And there's a mean girl.

Music and costumes are undeniably fun, I'll give them that.

But apart from that, the writers and producers should be ashamed of themselves. Burlesque is a real thing in cities across the world with real humans doing it, and this movie decided to pay NO regard either to what classic burlesque was nor the resurgence that has happened since the 1990s.

Here are some things you should know:
Burlesque is so much more than sexy dancing, it can be comedic, or emotive - rooted in vaudeville, it is a form of storytelling
 Most burlesque dancers are not professionally trained. And we come in a wide variety of sizes and shapes. It is an art form that in most communities celebrates feminism, consent and body positivity.
 There is literally nothing new or provocative about singing during burlesque. This happens in almost every show. (The movie would have you think it's like this jaw dropper novel idea.)
 Apart from showgirl venues in Paris, NYC, las Vegas etc, most burlesque performers don't perform nightly at a venue or have large production budgets. In most cities, it's hard enough to fill a weekly or monthly show.
 Most of us have day jobs and even learn to sew and rhinestone ourselves. Unlike stripping, it is usually done out of passion, not for money - it is hard to make enough just to break even on good costumes and props, let alone to live off of.
 in most cities, you can expect a burlesque show to have a mix of solos and group choreo, and typically, solos ""peel"" down to pasties and undies or merkin.

If you are intrigued by modern burlesque, for the love of goddess, go support your local performers and see what it is actually about before watching the dumb movie. Look beyond Dita and Suicide Girls, and look up videos on YouTube of Burlesque Hall of Fame (bhof), Michelle L'Amour, Ula Uberbussen, April OPeel, Vagina Jenkins, Jo Boobs, Lola LeSoleil, Rosie Cheeks.

Burlesque is at your finger tips and you don't need this movie to reach out and touch it (just don't touch your performers ;)",1491523200,3,2302,4.579075425790754

4023707,4,B002ZG9774,"Released in 2010, Burlesque is a drama/musical about a bored small town girl (Christina Aguilera) who moves to the big city to better her life and, hopefully, do something with her great talents. She gets a waitress job at a nightclub and eventually talks the owner (Cher) into allowing her to perform. Cam Gigandet plays the potential beau while Peter Gallagher appears as the club owners ex-husband and part owner. Stanley Tucci plays the likable stage manager while Kristen Bell & Julianne Hough are on hand as dancers. Eric Dane plays the arrogant mogul who wants to purchase the club and build condos.

My title blurb says it all: Burlesque combines the plot of 2000s Coyote Ugly with elements of 2002s Chicago, particularly the curvy women and burlesque dancing sequences. While it failed to achieve the moderate success of Coyote Ugly at the box office, its a significantly better movie. Although both films have the familiar formula plot, Burlesque has a more compelling story with a more dynamic cast and superior song & dance. It also has better women, as far as curvy appeal goes (with the arguable exception of Piper Perabo, the women in Coyote Ugly had the non-curvy shape of 12 year-old boys). Someone criticized that Aguilera was too old for the role. Poppycock. She was 29 during filming and easily passed for someone in her late teens/early twenties. Despite her alluring powers, she had the youthful/winsome/innocent vibe to pull off the part.

Theres a surprising peripheral plot about how homosexual relationships start with sex and proceed from there.

The film runs 119 minutes and was shot entirely at Sony Pictures Studios, Culver City, California. It was written & directed by Steve
Antin.

4026484,3,B002ZG9774,"This is an average movie musical.  Of course, Christina Aguilera has a tremendous voice.  The plot is pretty formulaic and contrived.  The most distracting thing in the whole production, and I admit to being unable to get past this, is Cher's terrible plastic surgery which left her unable to change her facial expression from a pursed lip pout.  Every scene Cher was in her expression was unchanged, regardless of the emotional content of the scene.  I spent more time watching her face than enjoying the film.  I'm a big Cher fan, so I find it tragic that she perpetrated this disfigurement upon herself.  At best, this musical is a pleasant diversion and little more.  Don't waste money on it if you haven't already seen Chicago, Moulin Rouge, Cabaret, Rock of Ages, or A Chorus Line.  For Cher at her best, see Moonstruck.",1473033600,,826,4.76056338028169

However, this is a great movie to pop in and watch when you need something uplifting and entertaining.  With no expectations I watched this movie and loved that everything you want to happen to make for a happy ending actually happens.  Sometimes you just want a feel good movie.  The songs are great, the dancing is great, and the singing is amazing.  Cher has one of the most unique voices out there and it was great to see a performance from her- plus she looks amazing!

4027988,5,B002ZG9774,"When Cher was asked to participate in her first film in almost a decade, I imagine the director was nervous because he thought that this role just wasn't up to par on what the Oscar winner could perform. Fortunately for him, Cher is an Oscar winner and can do anything she puts her mind to. This film is camp. It's flirtatious. Burlesque has it's moments of power and beauty and then there are times when Christina Aguilera comes on screen and you think, ""Lady Gaga would have done so much better"". I put this movie on about twice a month after a night of heavy drinking and I imagine being in the audience of this run down club and watching my idol perform her heart out.",1465257600,,672,4.341269841269841

4028361,3,B002ZG9774,"This one of those ""I have nothing better to do"" movies.  Burlesque is not a great movie.  It doesn't have the best example of Cher's acting ability.  Musically it is rather one-dimensional.  Morally it is questionable. But it is kind of entertaining, if formulaic.  So, if you have nothing else to do, go ahead.",1463961600,,311,4.685185185185185

4028595,2,B002ZG9774,"This movie is really misnamed -- it IS NOT about burlesque at all. They should have called it Cabaret or the like, as that would be more accurate. Most burlesque performers do not march around the stage dressed like Nazi domaintrixes, singing their butts off. Though some might sing, they usually dance or pose, slowly disrobing. And let's not talk about the storyline -- it seemed like the writers picked a few random bits from a list of movie tropes and made a mishmash out of it. The reason I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 star is that it did have very good production values and lighting, that's it.",1462060800,,603,4.441441441441442

Oh, it's fluff and formula, the romance is sappy and predictable, the save at the end was anticipated in that this movie simply couldn't end any other way. Despite that, I still love it. Why? Well the costumes, the choreography, the music and most of all, two powerful voices, Chistina's and Cher's.  The movie is worth watching just to hear Christina Aquilar sing Tough Love. So, yeah, I give it 5 out 5.

Not every movie has to be powerful or meaningful. A movie and and sometimes should be just a great romp in the park. This one is.",1461888000,16,561,4.384615384615385

What's not to enjoy. Cher is great so is Stanley Tuci as the more experienced influence. But I mostly got this for the music. When I don't watch the movie I listen to the soundtrack. Its fun, it's a little campy but it is one you can watch over and over again, and enjoy.",1461715200,,436,4.2023809523809526

4032061,5,B002ZG9774,"The more I watch this film the more I appreciate it. Cher recently said she wasn't too thrilled with the film or her performance in it. All I can say is she's being way too hard on herself and the film. Just about everyone in this film does a great job IMHO, particularly in the musical numbers which are fabulous. Christina Aquilera does just fine with whatever she's got to do, whether she's singing or not. Forget the critics. This is an old fashioned feel good movie musical and the more I see it the more I really like it. It's got a permanent place on my DVD shelf and I watch it at least a couple of times a year all the way through, and more often I just watch the musical numbers for fun. I have the soundtrack and I put in the player and sing along. It's not often that I go out of my way to buy a DVD and OST for a movie but I bought this one. Worth the time and the buy IMHO....",1443312000,,890,3.95

No silly conversations breaking out in song and all of that nonsense. The singing is AMAZING--I never knew what kind of voice Christina Aguilera truly had before I saw this film. And, well, Cher is Cher :) The story is cute and keeps you engaged well enough, but it is the songs (along with the great stage show) that make this worth watching over n over n over. Sometimes one of the songs will just start playing in my head and I will wind up watching the whole movie over again just to enjoy the music and spectacle. Enjoy!",1435622400,,693,4.257575757575758

4033480,5,B002ZG9774,"Christina Aguilera at her most beautiful. For a movie about burlesque, this movie is sexy but not in the least bit crude. Far better than critics say, the singing and performances are amazing. The plot is a device to bridge between performances, but that's what anyone watching this should expect. That said, you do end up caring what happens to these characters. If you don't like Ms. Aguilera, absolutely don't bother. If you love her, you probably don't need to read this review. If you're agnostic, watch the movie. You'll become a fan of her considerable singing chops.",1432080000,,574,4.86734693877551

4033674,4,B002ZG9774,"Girl leaves IA as there were no well paying jobs (or something like that) for LA(?). She wonders around looking for a job. Then stumbles upon some half dressed girl she thought was a stripper. She goes in after the girl and watches the burlesque show. She worms her way to waitress and then on the stage.

I would have never watched this movie when it came out as it looked like a reboot of ""Show Girls"" or ""Striptease"". No thanks. But I saw a recent movie trailer and it looked like it had a plot. Also I cannot stand Cher (although she is a decent actress) or Christina A. But I watched it. Over all the plot was surprisingly decent. The trashy side that most movies like this was kinda down played. Yes they dress in bras and panties and dance on a stage. But unfortunately you cannot go outside your front door without seeing people out and about dressed like that in the US. Cher looked sickeningly sad with her plastic surgery deformed face. She couldn't move much given her age so they propped her up in the middle of her one routine and let the younger girls shake and giggle around her. Pretty inventive movie to shield Cher's ancienthood while still playing in such a movie. Anyway, Christina A looks her usually bony armed miniature height self . . . trying to looks sensual when she comes across as some 12 year old dancing in front of the mirror. She has the voice. But some of the songs at the end of the movie were not impactful. But the plot over all was a moral one. Even the bad girl wasn't so bad. She just talked mean.

So I guess if you have nothing else to two and have $2.99 instead of $12 see the VOD.",1429833600,,1625,4.255663430420712

She does an over-the-top job with her singing (vocal range and style are amazing!) and Cher does a really good job with her 2 solo numbers as well.  Even my hubby enjoys this...

While I'm not necessarily a huge fan of Cher's voice, I love her outspokenly feisty personality. And as a side note, I pretty much adore everything about Stanley Tucci. So I went into this movie expecting something ... interesting, if not necessarily good.

What an awesome surprise to find that Burlesque is a solidly entertaining movie from start to finish. It's like a decadent dessert for the eyes and ears. The sets are lavish, the costumes are gorgeous, the actors (male and female) are beautiful, the choreography is stunning, and the musical numbers are spectacular. There's wry humor sprinkled throughout, it's possible to feel empathy for most of the characters, and all the sparkly song-and-dance is held together by at least the semblance of a plot. On the downside, prepare yourself for some cartoonish characterizations and clunky dialog ... but then again, this is a pretty fantastical production (think ""Moulin Rouge"") so it would be unrealistic to expect hard-hitting drama and character nuance. All in all, this movie entertained my socks off. It's like going to a Cirque de Soleil show -- fun, dreamy, color-saturated, full of rhythm and melody, totally immersive. Not a bad way to spend a couple of hours.",1416009600,2,1350,5.0

4035509,4,B002ZG9774,Just saw this and usually don't like musicals but this was very good also with a romantic side. The only reason I am not giving it five stars is because I thought they should've let Cher sing more. She too has great voice.,1412380800,,222,4.186046511627907
4035510,5,B002ZG9774,"I LOVED this movie.  Have watched it many times.  And there aren't many I love any more due to all the cursing in them.  This was a delightfully fun movie with one of the most fantastic casts EVER.  Of course, Christina shines, and Cher is always awesome, but Stanley Tucci was PERFECT, as was Alan Cumming for the small role he played.  And what's not to like about Peter Gallagher and McSteamy, Eric Dane.  I didn't even recognize Kristen Bell, awesome acting for her.  And I was shocked to learn that Cher personally thinks this movie was ""horrible"" to quote her, supposedly partly because she didn't have a love interest.  Well, there's only so much you can pack into a movie.  The singing, it goes without saying is top notch, but the dancing is what amazes me.  HOW do they DO that?  The choreography was amazing and the dancers in perfect sync and honestly, I don't know how they can do all that dancing and still have breath left to sing!  Christina was complaining in an interview that they had 16 hour days dancing in those shoes til they had blisters.  Well, that's why you get paid the big bucks, sister, so stop complaining.  Anyway, I was thoroughly entertained by this bit of a fluffy movie and will watch it again and again for the artistic dancing, singing and actors.  Sorry you didn't like it, Cher, but you still did good in it!",1412380800,,1348,4.489711934156379

Christina Aguilera was new to me but she certainly impresses.  Obviously a great singer and her dance moves kept my eyes on her.  Her character is ""beautiful on the inside too"" and I get the feeling, and I hope I'm right, that she is that nice off-stage too.  I've watched it at least 20 or 30 times.",1411689600,,440,4.4375

I've watched it several times as well and enjoyed it each time, but I think Christina is one of the best vocalists ever. So consider the source. It's not Gone with the wind, nor is it Showgirls.

Of course I love Cher, and Christinas' talented voice is (to me) undeniable. It was a story you would expect to see, but not ""too cutesy"". We know Cher is the best, but I was impressed with Christina actually, looking so tamed down and not like the diva she is. Great movie and just amazing singing and entertainment!! Will probably buy it.",1405728000,,485,4.282608695652174

4036107,1,B002ZG9774,I bought it because I really love watching this movie but the picture quality of the DVD is so bad I watched it once and won't bother again. Also you cannot stretch the show across the entire screen. Unfortunately I did not watch the DVD until long after 30 days so it was too late to return it. Buy it somewhere else.,1403827200,,318,4.145161290322581
4036108,5,B002ZG9774,Amazing performance of Cher and Christina  she has the voice of the century. Costumes are the best for the period,1403740800,,113,4.65

Cher is amazing in this with Stanley Tucci has her sidekick.  Just fell in love with the whole thing and watch it over and over.  Sometimes I don't have time to sit through the whole movie so I watch the trailer and relive it in my mind.  Plus I went to itunes and purchased some of the music to listen to on my ipod at the gym.

4036136,1,B002ZG9774,"I don't understand how anyone could enjoy this movie. It has one of the worst, most predictably cliche and yet completely unengaging ""plots"" (read:none) I've seen in a long time. I love chick flicks, I love dance movies - but aside from Xtina's undeniable talent and some fabulous dance numbers, this story is so threadbare it makes you wonder why it's 2 hours long.

Basically, you watch this and come to the conclusion that someone decided to turn a Christina Aguilera concert into a movie. Even Cher is completely boring. The characters fall flat, their interactions are completely unbelievable and the whole thing just ends up being seriously groan worthy. NEXT!",1403049600,,666,5.0

4036141,5,B002ZG9774,"Rented this years ago and wanted to watch again, I enjoyed the dancing and singing so much.

I was pleasantly surprised when we watched this for the first time.  The story is plausible, the acting is pretty decent and the music is fun.  It is basically a musical without the cheesy... dialogue turns into a music montage type scenes.  I was also pleasantly surprised at the lack of nudity.  With this type of movie they could have very easily had more risque scenes incorporated and they didn't.

Christina(Ali) plays a small town girl that goes to the big city in search of a job in Hollywood. She stumbles upon Burlesque, while looking for a job. Her hotel room gets robbed and she ends up broke and homeless.  She moves into a coworker/bartender's apartment (a guy).  She starts out as a waitress, but quickly ends up on stage when they discover she can sing. Tess (the club owner-Cher) is in danger of losing her club because the bank want to forclose.

4036549,5,B002ZG9774,"I've had this movie for a couple of years and absolutely LOVE IT.  I've got Chicago, Moulin Rouge, All That Jazz, etc. But this is the one I put on again and again. and again.  Cher is Cher.  What more can you say. Sometimes her performance is a little stiff, but I love the interaction between her and the prop-master at the club.  Someone wrote that they ad-libbed quite a bit and it shows.  Some of the comments are truly off the cuff and fun.  Jack, the bar tender can make my drinks any day!  He is as cute as can be and perfect for Ali (Christina).  For this to be Christina's first film, she did an excellent job.  She had me hooked on the first number she performed at the diner she was working in.  There were a couple of scenes where the acting appeared to be a little forced and overdone.  But this chick can sing.  Her torch song in the Club when she is wearing the green dress really shows her range.  Christina goes from a wide eyed innocent coming to a big city to an experienced performer, in a burlesque lounge, no less.  She knows what she wants and goes after it.  This movie is not for the prudes or real youngsters.  Being a Burlesque show, there is a lot of suggestive clothing (or lack there-of), but no nudity, and ""bump and grind"".  And, surprisingly, but refreshingly, very little swearing, now that I think of it.  Enjoy the movie for what it is. It is fun, very entertaining.  My only bad thing to say: my TV has lousy speakers.",1392940800,,1456,4.267399267399267

4036551,5,B002ZG9774,It's a great movie. The actors are amazing! Christina was just phonemnal from singing to acting! The music was surreal and very well done!,1392681600,,138,4.791666666666667

4036557,5,B002ZG9774,"If you love a great movie mixed with a little romance, drama, and music than this is the correct movie. I love Cher I think she is gorgeous and Christina Aguliera(Ally) was perfect her voice is like none other. Her voice is so great it sends chills through my body. Ally wants to pursue her dreams and Cher doesn't believe in her; she finally gets her chance as a dancer, but than the music goes off and what does Ally do, she sings with no music ACapella and became the lead star of the show.",1391558400,,493,4.2
4036558,3,B002ZG9774,"Enough hip slinging to keep a platoon of chiropractors busy.  It became tedious before it was over.  And as much as I admire Cher, she seemed to be walking through her role as the grand ""mama"".  The story was superficial - just used to string the performances together.  Which was just as well since I couldn't tell one character from another much of the time.. My main problem is probably me.  I'm just getting too old for this much noise and commotion.",1391472000,,454,4.487804878048781

Everyone differs with respect to rating a movie - So, it really depends on what you are looking for.

4036590,3,B002ZG9774,"I'm not sorry I watched it but I wish it had stuck with the theme from the first Cher number that introduces the main character to the Burlesque genre because that was the last we saw of it. The rest was sparkly dance numbers with no more humor or flirting than you'd see in a rap video.

Edit: upon further contemplation I realize that even the first number wasn't burlesque- it just happened to have the old fashioned cabaret aesthetic that I like. So, in short, this movie is untouched by any sort of burlesque. It's a shame because there is a LOT of funny, talented burlesque these days. The movie about it still needs to be made, because it's sure not this one.",1390694400,,666,4.370967741935484

The second one also wouldn't play, so I just figured it was our player; it couldn't possibly be the fault of two discs, right?  So, I was reluctant to ask for another replacement and set it aside (it is now too late to ask for another replacement).  Well, it wasn't our player, as other DVD's played fine.  It wasn't until just recently that I heard of someone else that had the same problem with the same movie, so it's just something with the Burlesque DVD's.  Hers was a gift and she didn't bother to ask for a replacement, so I'm not really sure who the seller was.  Regardless, what is wrong with these Burlesque DVD's?

We've all seen this story of a talented small town girl that moves to the big city and becomes famous and all that stuff. What makes this movie great, is the musicals. I loved every single one of them. Cher was amazing when she performed her songs, and Christina Aguilera's voice was perfect for all the songs she performed. I knew she was a great singer, I never knew she was such an AMAZING dancer. Every song was performed estupendous and the dance moves were outstanding. This was Christina's debut but its was a good one. She blew my mind with her awesome dance moves and performances in the movie. This movie will make you smile and will not bore you. Great movie definately recommend it.",1385942400,,793,4.513888888888889

4036891,1,B002ZG9774,"This seemed like a fun way to treat my mother with one of her favorite movies. I thought that she would be able to have a sort of special edition of the movies as it had everything on it in Italian and the package came with different stamps from the Italian mail and customs. However, once we tried to watch it, we discovered that due to different laws and formatting of discs, there is not a way to play the DVD in an American DVD player. A computer can play it if you change the regional settings, however you are only able to change it like 3 times for the life of the computer so that is not an option. This seemed like a fun idea, but after waiting for it to arrive for like 3 months, it would not play and had to be returned, and I ended up ordering a normal American version.",1385856000,,782,4.051612903225807
4036892,5,B002ZG9774,Christina and Cher. That should tell you everything you need to know. Lots of fun music and dancing. Definitely a good buy.,1385769600,,123,4.636363636363637
4036893,4,B002ZG9774,"If you think (like Homer Simpson) that ""Showgirls"" is the film that has it all (sleazy plot, sexy dancing, skimpy costumes, and the backstage of a club on the Strip or a strip club) then ""Burlesque"" is the perfect, or almost-perfect sequel. It's not actually a sequel except in the sense it's the spiritual sequel. It's just as trashy. It's just as improbable, but in a way, it has better actors, such as Christina Aguilera in her film debut and Cher, who's great except for one tiny ""ick"" factor, which is her sixty-some year old upper lip has been botox'ed into an arctic frozen wasteland. That lip never moves, even when she's dancing her legs off.

The plot is the usual ingenue-leaves-rural-Iowa-wants-to-dance-in-a-strip-club. The dancing is not as over-the-top as ""Showgirls"" nor are the costumes; this is more intimate--a burlesque club with tighter shots and more Bob Fosse-like dancing that looks slightly dated for 2010 but fits, all the same. All the women are followed by a dark past that threatens the rosy future, and they are rescued by bartenders with hearts of gold. There is ONE scene I really hate: Nikki, best friend of Tess (Cher) is drunk (as usual) but is ready to drive off after a fight with Tess. ""Nikki! Don't drive..."" says Tess only it's practically whispered, uh, Nikki, ho hum, don't drive, eh, oh well. And off storms Nikki. She could have grabbed the keys and had a girl fight. It would have worked in the scene and we wouldn't see someone let a sauced goose operate a vehicle endangering everyone else.

If you are having a Festival of Bad Burlesque Films for Download"" (you have to say this like Dan Akroyd ""Baaaaahd"" in the Saturday Night Live skit) this should be on the program, along with (of course, ""Showgirls"", and maybe ""Flashdance"", ""Dirty Dancing"" and even ""Chicago."" Not all burlesque but they kinda fit.",1385683200,,1851,4.799373040752351

4036896,5,B002ZG9774,"""Burlesque"" is a guilty pleasure for me. The plot and story are predictable, but the songs, dance numbers and lovely ladies of the burlesque hall  are a pleasure to see and hear. Ignore the tawdry tabloid exposure of Christina Aguilera; just watch this move, see her dance, and hear her, and co-star Cher, belt out the tunes.",1385337600,,325,4.701754385964913

My wife still gets the chills when Christina gets a chance to really rip into it midway through the film.  Ok, the story isn't Oscar material, but it is a fun watch, especially Stanley Tucci (can he do no wrong?).  They could have used the genius of Alan Cummings more, but ok.  Overall, definitely worth having in the movie collection.",1384300800,,485,4.528735632183908

4037037,3,B002ZG9774,"Eye Candy?  That is almost a given.  Christina Aguilera's voice is definitely an instrument that is a force unwilling to be ignored, but a number of the selections left me wanting more.  I actually wanted more background/interactions - particularly involving Cher and Stanley Tucci (he is the CONSUMMATE Supporting Actor).  If you happen to see it during a lazy weekend as you are scanning channels - feel free to take in the sights, but don't feel disloyal should you be reminded of something else to do.",1383523200,,505,4.837209302325581

4037257,5,B002ZG9774,"Christina Aguilera was absolutely fabulous with acting and musical performances that I hadn't expected to be anything more than adequate. Cher was Cher, and she was as good as she always is. She plays a ""burlesque theater"" owner, whose entire life's love of the performance is embodied in her mostly successful brick and mortar theater. The money isn't coming in fast enough to keep the theater, and the plot is based on saving the business and of course a love story that's actually interesting.",1374192000,,496,4.916666666666667

I would have been happier listening to Cher and Christina Aguilera albums - the music was the only enjoyable part of the movie! Without Christina's dynamite singing power and Cher's powerhouse solos, this movie does not have a leg to stand on. Its cheap worn-out plot, abundant clichs, and lame excuses for 'drama' within the film render it incredibly and mindbogglingly pointless. Don't waste your time!",1373932800,2,559,4.894736842105263

This wasn't great acting and the story was predictable (small town girl with big heart makes it against all odds and saves the day) but Christine and Cher have nice chemistry, Stanley is always marvelous, the choreography was really fun and the songs were toe tapping.

I expected a musical, and there is lots of music, but this seemed more like a striptease kind of movie than anything. I highly recommend to adults who like to watch half-naked ladies dance, since that's what this movie is, with a little bit of romance, I guess. If you're looking for a good musical, I suggest one other than this, since I didn't really enjoy it as such.

GREAT DANCING! great story about about a girl who lives in Iowa who needs change and has this talent and nowhere to go with it, so she skips town and starts over in LA. she started out as the ugly duckling and worked her way up to be the beautiful swan. good acting, good story, good lookin people. good stuff all around. i recommend!",1369267200,,629,4.25

4037456,5,B002ZG9774,"Cher is perfect for this part. On stage as well as off, she dignifies sexuality and exquisitely puts it to music and video. Christina and all, puts an excitement if not sizzle into the characters and burns heat into the performances. If the movie could give off their perfume, woooooow, we may not need the live stage but just this screen (ya right) . Morays play a part in any review, whatever, but Burlesque is a wonderful American-French invention and must be treated with respect.",1369094400,,484,4.705882352941177

Story line is weak, though Christina Agulera gets to show off her talent in belting out songs and even has a ballad that shows another side of her ability.  Still like Cher's personality, but even with today's technical aids, age of her voice is showing when she does her ballad.  However, she sounds great when she knocks out the title song.  Dance numbers are real show-stoppers!!",1368057600,,457,4.82051282051282

I remember seeing the commercials when it was released in theaters and was excited about going to see it, but somehow, never got to get there.  I'm glad I saw it on tv.  While the musical numbers and Christina's voice were wonderful, the movie itself was not very good.  The dialogue, awful.  Love story, weak. I was impressed by Christina's talent and Cher looks good.  What it did do for me is give me more confidence about my hope to be a screenwriter one day.  Because if this movie could be made with such talented stars with the awful excuse for dialogue that was used, I should be successful.  When I went to bed last night there was a part of me that did want to buy it for my collection, because I did like the musical numbers.

4037979,4,B002ZG9774,"At first I was anxious about watching ""Burlesque"" because I am a HUGE Christina Aguilera fan, and feared that her acting skills would lessen my opinion of her. So many female talented vocalists have tried, and tried again to transition into an acting career with cringing results. However, I am glad to report that I was blown away by her passion, and how she brought Allie to life! I really was impressed, even her dancing was amazing! Still, I felt that ""Burlesque"" was lacking in certain areas, and it is because of this that I gave it four stars.

I really felt like the script could have been better in some areas. I don't want to give away spoilers, but after you've seen the movie, I think you'll know what I mean. It needed more attention, and I think with a bigger budget the story could have been flushed out better.

Some parts of the movie were just plain awkward. Cher singing a song that really had no place in the progression of the storyline. In one scene, Allie [Christina Aguilera] asks a woman what kind of shoes she was wearing, the woman responded, ""They're Christian Loubatans."" I wouldn't have cared that she pronounced it incorrectly, but the camera zoomed in on her face, emphasizing how awakward the moment was.",1356480000,,1237,4.618181818181818

Cher sings one great song and one that is just awful, which I fast-forward through.

The daqncing choreography is unbelievably complex and very well performed.

The story is interesting but you know how it will turn out for Angulara early in the film. It is interesting nevertheless. The soluiotn to Cher's club/money on the other hand is not predictable until it happens very near the end of the film.

4038197,5,B002ZG9774,"Burlesque is just one of those movies that comes out of nowhere, doesn't get the press it deserves, and then becomes a sensational hit after the fact.  That's exactly how I feel about this movie.  Now I'm not a musical kind of guy, but I've only seen a handful of musicals, and this one ranks among the best.  It's up there with Rocky Horror and My Fair Lady (my other two favorite musical movies).

The only thing that annoys me is how some people claim that this is a ""chick flick.""  It is by NO MEANS a chick flick!  This movie is great for both guys and girls.  For the girls, you can look at all the gorgeous women and appreciate them for their style.  You can also look at the very handsome lead actor, Jack, for some eye candy.  Maybe you view them as role models, perhaps (and maybe you fine lesbians can whet your whistle a bit!).  For the guys, well...you can look at all the gorgeous women too and get your male juices flowing.  For the gay men out there, of course there's lots to love!  You got your Broadway musical thing going on with your fabulous icon, Cher (and a musical track by your other icon, Madonna, interspersed in between scenes), and then there's Jack with a partial nudity scene.

There's something for everybody in this film!  The choreography is great, the actors are wonderful, and the dance numbers are super catchy and entertaining to watch.  It's a definite must-see.",1340236800,,1402,4.464566929133858

4038200,3,B002ZG9774,"I have always been a big fan of Cher. She is one of those rare singers who, when crossing over to the movies, manages to make very high quality movies (although curiously she doesn't often sing in them). Burlesque, despite Cher's top billing, is definitely Christina's movie. I did enjoy the music, but I think I'll skip purchasing the soundtrack seeing how Cher only sang 2 songs.

The music was good. The costumes were great. The dancing was good (I may have enjoyed that better if I were a horny guy?). I liked the movie, I really did, but this just wasn't up to the quality of most of the stuff Cher does. And then I have to admit musicals aren't exactly my thing. I like some of the older ones, like Mary Poppins. And don't attack me, but I actually liked Burlesque better than some of the more recent ones like Chicago or Moulin Rouge! (I did enjoy Chicago on Broadway, however.)

I guess it was the lack of a plot. Not that that's unusual for a musical. They put that thing in the background about Cher's character worrying about losing her club, but that was overshadowed by everything else. And it was resolved very oddly. And the romance was predictable. I will definitely watch the movie again, however, because it was still a lot of fun, with a lot to see.",1338681600,,1268,4.437768240343348

4038224,1,B002ZG9774,"Burlesque was about as authentic as the WWE, but with less talent. First, the story has been told a thousand times: Aguilera is sick of her backwater home town. So she puts on her best Dorothy Gale gingham bustier, packs up her little basket of vocal chords and goes over the rainbow to join the cast of Glee as they re-imagine 'Showgirls' (and oh, how I was longing for someone to get pushed down the stairs).

As for Cher, she was a campy-trampy imitation Mae West at best. This 'hooker with a heart of gold' cliche made me sad to remember Cher the Real Actress.  You know, back when she was kicking Hollywood's pretentious *ss around the block?  Come Back to the Five & Dime, Jimmy Dean. Silkwood. Mask. Moonstruck. Of course, that was also when she could still move some of her facial muscles. She may be delivering Oscar-worthy performances, we just can't see it happening.

And poor Stanley Tucci! You could tell he was embarrassed. Every time he hit the screen he was made of pain. Pain like peanut butter stuck in your throat. Pain like full body paper cuts in a vat of stewed tomatoes. So sad.

Truly, this is no Moulin Rouge.  It's not even Coyote Ugly (but it did make me want to chew my leg off to get away). No way around it: This is a stinker.",1335744000,7,1257,4.373390557939914

I dunno...  Math is hard.  Let's go shopping.

I know zombies are popular right now, but is Hollywood capable of anything _but_ reanimating the dead?  If you're over the age of 10 and haven't already seen this film a thousand times, I congratulate you on your recent emergence from that terrible coma.

If you haven't spent the past hundred years under a rock, you could sit through your first viewing of this commonplace and mouth every line like your ten thousandth time at Rocky Horror.  I found myself inexplicable overcome with an urge to hurl toast at Ms. Aguilera while spontaneously bellowing ""What's your favorite high protein drink?"" at Cher.

Welcome to 21st century America, where ""artistic bankruptcy"" isn't even a concept, and you really can't go wrong underestimating the intelligence of your audience.  I teach 6th grade and if a student handed in this script I'd flunk 'em for plagiarism and then call social services to find out what the parents had done to kill the poor kid's imagination.

4038331,4,B002ZG9774,"OK, a small town girl from Iowa goes to the big city to make good. Original? No. But in the hands of director Steve Antin, and a cleverly assembled cast of A-listers, the film is quite entertaining.

I'm not a fan of Aguilera's voice, but she is a capable actress, and her singing is less ""stylized"" than usual, and it works. Cher is enjoyable, as always, and Stanley Tucci and Alan Cumming bode well, as well as a snotty performance from Kristin Bell.

I especially enjoyed newcomer Cam Gigadet, very engaging in the male lead. His career should flourish.

The idea is so old, but some fresh approaches, some good original tunes, mixed with oldies, and a strong cast that buys in to the narrative, collectively make this a most enjoyable film.

Don't dismiss ""Burlesque"" too quickly. As entertainment, it succeeds on many levels.",1325203200,,830,4.743055555555555
4038362,3,B002ZG9774,"I hate to admit, but I was turned off to seeing this in theaters based off of the critics reviews. However, I would recommend renting this movie if you are a Cher or Christina fan!

The costumes, dancing, singing... amazing. It was a visual treat. For that reason I gave it three stars.

The plot, like most others that rated it a three have said, was lackluster. Very predictable and too slow. If you caught the preview for this movie, you already know about 3/4 of the plot. The character roles were transparent from the minute you are introduced to them so in the same way you can figure out the ending quickly. However, the plot wasn't awful, and it really isn't the focus of the movie.

If you are interested in seeing great dancing and hearing great singing, this is a great movie to check out. If you are looking for a deep plot, skip it.",1325030400,,845,4.369426751592357

We have watched it over and over.  Good Show!",1325030400,,405,4.207792207792208

4038366,3,B002ZG9774,"I love musicals and have seen almost every one ever produced both on stage and in film. Watching 'Burlesque' is like watching the TV show 'Glee'. You know that Glee is unrealistic, overdone, and absurd, but , hey, they got these great musical numbers that you would never never see in a real high school show choir. So you watch it anyway because you like the music and you ignore the idiocy of some of the more ridiculous plot lines. However, with Glee, the plot lines are interesting and make sense even if they are overwrought and often unrealistic. They are interesting and Glee at least deals with real and important issues. The same cannot be said for Burlesque.
If you are familiar with burlesque as an art form, be prepared to see a version of burlesque that never existed in real life. Not even close. Strip out the comedy, the sexual banter, the skits, and the music and what you have left is numerous numbers of dancing prancing women (and sometimes men) in skimpy costumes behaving like the backup troupe for a Cher concert on an ever expanding and contracting stage in a totally imaginary burlesque theater backed up by a full orchestra.  This is a burlesque theater that you will only see in an ex-burlesque's queen vision of heaven. It is more of a cabaret than a burlesque theater.

One of the main plot points of this theater owned by Cher is that it is broke and Cher will lose the place in a couple of weeks to the bank.  You can easily understand why Cher is broke if you think about how much it must have cost to equip the stage, make the costumes and put on the show.

Cher has a couple of numbers that she does very well, but you need to get beyond the death mask of a face that she displays that was probably caused by too much plastic surgery and botox.

Christina Aquilera is excellent. She sings, she dances, she takes over the film because she can really act. You just have to ignore the stereotypical line that she is just a girl from Iowa. Really?

Don't think too hard about the absurdity of the various plot lines that surround the musical numbers. They are dumb and laughable and will ruin the fantasy of this imaginary burlesque theater. For example, much is made of the fact that all the women lip-sync to the music until Aquilera comes along who can really really sing. She belts out the songs and very soon after ALL the performers seem to have magically taking singing lessons.  Then you will laugh yourself silly as you realize that the entire film is lip-synced, all the songs are done in a recording studio and added to the film.

Normally this film would deserve a 1-star rating, but I really like musical theater, and despite the terrible nature of this film, I had to give it 3 stars.",1324857600,,2728,4.463855421686747

4038370,5,B002ZG9774,"I've heard some harsh reviews on this movie when it first came out, but I was still skeptical on how bad the movie was. Of course, my first instinct won over...It was AMAZING! To shortly summarize without giving anything away... Romantic comedy. There are no complex story plots that need to be followed, just good old-fashioned soul-pounding singing, sexy dancing, and comedic retorts. This type of movie genre is aimed towards an audience who aren't looking for complex plots, betrayals, or soul-crushing despair; In fact, it begets the exact opposite. For those who want good old-fashion singing and dancing from the amazing actors and actresses of this film such as Christina Aguilera and Cher, then go for it.

  Christina Aguilera fans, you will not be disappointed. Being a Christina Aquilera fan at the age of 9, I always loved her voice. Her voice is what separated the amateurs from the angelic, heart-wrenching artists such as that of Christina Aguilera. Her singing in this movie will move you, and will have you cheering from the sidelines for her character to achieve her dreams. The main point of this movie was to push their main characters and singers, Christina and Cher, to the front stage and lead the story along the way. This movie wasn't made to incorporate the singing into the story plot; more like the movie and story came together DUE to the singing and dancing.

  The movie title ""Burlesque"" is actually based on the Victorian Burlesque, in which comedic, dramatic, literary, and musical work come together to be performed in theatres to entertain the masses. This movie ""Burlesque"" is based off of the American version of the Victorian burlesque, and originally there was no ""stripping"" of any kind performed onstage. However, as the early 1900's came in, a ""strip-tease"" of sorts was gradually incorporated in the acts, which then the Burlesque shows became known for. In the beginning, the performers would wear more revealing costumes for their musical numbers, making witty sexual innuendos as well, and then strip. However, this was DIFFERENT from the strip clubs, because the audience were paying to listen and watch the performers sing and dance; the strip tease was an added bonus. Also, burlesque shows were available for parties of both sexes to view the show, not just the men. A dramatic difference from the strip clubs and bordellos back in the day.

  What's great about this movie is that the directors incorporate the actual history of the American Burlesque into the movie. They incorporated that history in the movie by (without spoiling anything):
  1)Showing pictures of the historical American burlesque performers in actual magazines
  2)Some of the characters emphasizing how the burlesque show was NOT a strip joint
  3)Kept to the singing and exotic dancing in a clean PG-13 viewing (not much naked parts to worry over)
  4)Showed performers that didn't sing, but performed other acts and jokes

So, the run down:

Pros: Christina Aquilera and Cher singing, authentic and correct historical facts of the American burlesque established in the film, comedic jokes, amazing dancers and singers, a small love triangle, and something to wipe away the worries of reality.
Cons: Predictable storyline,...that's about it.

For those who enjoy the American historical fashions, songs, buildings, and facts during the early 20th century, this movie is for you.
Again, for those who just want to watch something musically influenced and fun, and fans of Christina Aguilera and Cher, then by all means, watch away!",1323648000,,3557,5.1
4038371,1,B002ZG9774,"Was NOT a fan of this movie at all.  The plot line was barely lukewarm and the acting was *almost* believable.

4038388,2,B002ZG9774,"I tried to like this movie, but couldn't.  I like movies like dance movies like: Chicago, Nine, Cabaret... movies that have some interesting characters and great dance numbers.  This movie attempted to take something from movies like those, but come across more like Showgirls.  At least, Showgirls was funny, but this was just boring and filled with characters you don't care about.  Hot bodies abound and there's sex, but the bodies have heads that can't act and dance moves that seem like they've all come out of MTV Videos from the 80's.  The characters and plot are all contrived and feel like we've seen it all before.  Unfortunately, Cher is wasted in this role.  Her role could have been great and fun to play, but she comes across like a grumpy has-been with a big chip on her shoulder.  Stanley Tucci, who I think is a great actor, is wasted in this movie.  Everyone seems as though they were thrown in to boost interest in the film, but this film needs more than a few good names to make it interesting.  Christine Aguleria is sexy and attractive, but her acting and her singing fall flat and seem totally uninspired.  Eric Dane seems like he wondered into the film by accident.  Everyone in the movie acts like they have a cloud hanging over their heads or a dark secret in their closet.  It's the writing -- the writing drags this movie down because it does not have any truth to it.  The writing of this movie makes you wonder why anyone would sign on to be in it.  All this movie does is rip off other better movies and old dance videos.  Cher's comeback movie?  Cher has done a lot of good work over the years.  She shouldn't have come back for this.  If you watch this movie and you're familiar with older, better dance musicals, you'll see this movie is nothing, but a rip off of everything that has come before.",1322352000,,1830,4.474320241691843

Don't get me wrong, the skin that's shown is just fine, just no naughty parts.  While the production numbers are OK, the film doesn't have one creative idea.  We've seen the story a hundred times, told a hundred times better.  This film is also hampered by some pretty bad acting with Cher the worst of the bunch.  Aguilera isn't great, but she didn't have much to work with so I'd give her another shot.  I did like a couple of the somber original songs, one by Cher and one by Christina although they had no relevance to the scene in the film.  Pass.

The Blu ray transfer is very good from all aspects.  It is presented in 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The picture, while not reference quality is very good.  The DTS HD MA 5.1 lossless audio is spectacular and makes good use of all the speakers.",1319155200,,942,4.514792899408284

Had the movie had someone other than Cher it would have been a great movie.  Cher needs to stick to her specialized singing because her acting sucks.  Every word sounded as if it were being read from a script.  No acting there.  Christina Aguilera in the other hand did a superb job and I had never paid attention to her as a singer but in this movie she blew me away.  Forget the lame plot but see the movie to hear Christina Aguilera sing and her acting was pretty good also.  A thumbs up from me but because of Christina Aguilera.",1313884800,,709,4.177777777777778

Once again a movie DVD is released as ""Letterbox"" which means you only get half the movie because the top and bottom is cut off.
 To see how much you are missing, rent a movie that has both, a full screen and a Letterbox version and compare them.
Why do people put up with this?
You are paying for the whole movie, not just the middle half of each frame.
 I'm not. I will never buy another 2.40 to 1 format.

If you all would stop buying these and demand full screen versions maybe the studios would quit screwing us.
 I hope you realize they save a lot of money with a 2.40 to 1 release, no matter what you may have read or heard.

I watch this movie and Chicago whenever I feel I need some personal down time.

I can live with it, not all that thrilled about it, but in the scheme of things, it's only a small inconvienence.....",1313366400,,333,4.015151515151516
4038537,5,B002ZG9774,"I just watched this last night, bought the DVD & will be keeping it to rewatch again & again; in fact I'm hoping there is a soundtrack album to buy here next. Luckily I pay little attention to critics & as others have already said, the critics were crazy or blind, deaf & dumb. I'm not at all a fan of musicals, can't think of a single one I'd want to watch once through, never mind repeatedly. The only other musical I might watch again would be a Chorus Line, maybe.

However, this is a movie as much as a musical, if not more so. The story drove the musical numbers, not the other way around as is often the case. The viewer becomes involved in the character's struggles, stories, failures & successes. The actors are amazing in this, not a one slacked off anywhere in this film. The lip syncing was a bit obvious in many of the scenes, not a one live singing, but Christina & Cher, both being pros, did it so well you really had to work to catch the lip syncing. I was surprised at the acting talent Christina proved in this movie, none of it obvious or fake. Cher is as fabulous as ever, sounding & looking good, if a wee bit rough around the edges, but one had to really look to see such. My one pet peeve is with the wigs used throughout the film, all were obvious fakes, being a Barber-stylist I notice such things more than the average person. When you can see light through sections of hair, it's usually a wig, since natural hair fills in those spaces, and Cher's were the worst, left me wondering what her real hair looks like these days. Christina's were more natural looking so that it was difficult to figure out which was the wig vs. real hair, only obvious in a few scenes, but her character uses wigs in the performance, so that's to be expected; Cher's character does NOT have that excuse.

The special features left much to be desired, a making-of should have been included, costume & other information could easily have been added but weren't. The bloopers were hilarious is short, the 6 full song numbers left out several better ones in the film that I wanted to see more, especially the last song & dance ""Show Me How You Burlesque"" which was some of the best music in this film. The different music styles used will appeal to all audiences of any age, the dancing & costumes were sexy yet tastefully done, and whoever choreographed this movie should have their name up in lights because the dancing in this film was the most original I've ever seen, including such other movies as Step Up. Absolutely nothing boring in this movie, and you won't want to leave your seat for fear of missing something fabulous.",1313020800,,2632,4.41358024691358

4038541,2,B002ZG9774,"Like a trashier version of `Chicago' (with Cher stepping in for Queen Latifah) or a tamer version of `Showgirls', `Burlesque' is a hot mess that doesn't do anything special and yet proves to be wholly entertaining.  I can't hate on this too much because I soaked up every scantily clad moment (what hot blooded male wouldn't?) but I can't in my right mind actually recommend a movie this brainless in construction.  The scene staging is god awful and the acting is atrocious (except from Stanley Tucci, who proves once again to be the ideal supporting man) and that script is a clich&eacute;d mess, but when you throw it all in a pot with some stunning vocals echoing themselves over a trashy cabaret nightclub you kind of (and I mean KIND OF) get cinematic magic.  The plot is predictable (young country girl with big dreams gets sucked into a crazy new life only to have to use her `gifts' to save her dreams from being crushed) and Christina Aguilera is a very bad actress (all sorts of OMG terrible actually), but the music is a total hit and even though Cher looks like a giantess amongst all these stick thin beauties and her solo `You Haven't Seen the Last of Me' is set up in such an awkward and out of place fashion, the song is amazing and she nails the emotional intentions perfectly (I just love Cher, despite her tranny-like voice).  It's a cheap rendition of a thousand films before it (`Chicago', `Showgirls', `Cabaret', `Coyote Ugly', etc.), but sometimes you want a little cheap.  The costumes are sexy and drool-worthy and the actual nightclub itself is the stuff of every man's fantasies, but Alan Cumming's weak attempt to emulate Joel Gray is an embarrassment and should have been cut from the film entirely.  The preposterous conclusion is also eye-rolling and a hasty attempt to `make everything right', which I never like much.  But, like many have noted, `Burlesque' never once claims to be anything more than campy entertainment, and to a certain degree it succeeds in being just that.",1312329600,,2011,4.744985673352436

4038564,4,B002ZG9774,"I tried to keep an open mind while watching Burlesque and was pleasantly surprised by the fun energy that runs throughout the film.  Cher, Christina Aguilara, Stanley Tucci... all good performances, especially if you like them anyway in other things, but probably not too far from who they really are in real life - making their performances ultimately predictably good.

The story is light, there aren't any real surprises.  This isn't a problem because the majority of the film is back to back musical numbers which really don't add to the story other than by illustrating the meaning of the word 'Burlesque' and stressing the group as an entertainment family.  The relationships (such as they are...) are believable enough to keep you hoping for a happy ending for everyone, and you get it.

Burlesque wouldn't make my all-time top 50, but it might make #51.  Great music and dancing sequences, sewn together by big names wearing great costumes. An enjoyable movie if you're not looking to stuff it into a specific genre or critique the acting of everyone in it.",1311552000,,1065,4.888888888888889

First of all, the music was grand.  I just finished watching and immediately got online to order the soundtrack. Only a couple of songs by Cher but ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me"" tore my heart out - Cher at her very best. And Christina! Wow -what can I say. I've never heard her any better. I especially loved ""Bound to You""; ""Something's Got a Hold On Me""; ""Tough Lover""; ""Guy What Takes His Time""; and ""Show Me How You Burlesque."" None of the songs are bad, though.

There was a great cast of secondary actors.  Stanley Tucci outdid himself.  Cam Gigandet was a hot love interest for Christina's character, Ali.  Alan Cumming had a small part but I loved him.  Eric Dane and Peter Gallagher played what they play best - men that are not easy to like.  Small cameo by James Brolin - would have liked to see more of him.

I enjoyed this movie a lot.  It was bawdy, suggestive, funny, romantic and just full of great music.  I plan on getting it for my permanent library.",1310860800,2,1164,4.362790697674418

Cher is always entertaining whether singing or acting and Christina Aguilera is surprisingly talented in the acting department and should pursue that further (as I'm sure she will) and her voice has never been stronger.
Julianne Hough is gorgeous and multi talented as is Eric Dane!  When I first noticed the bartender Jack I knew I'd seen him somewhere and it was from the O.C. where as Volchok  he was always a detestable (yet entertaining) character.

This cannot be classified as a good movie by any stretch of the imagination. It's a super cliche and predictable plot. Many things about the movie make absolutely no sense whatsoever.

Aguilera can obviously sing, but she can't really act (although I must admit that she is not quite as awful as I assumed she'd be). In spite of all that...I really liked the movie! I'm a fan of all things burlesque, so I loved the costumes and the dancing and the glamour. The movie is cheesey and completely unoriginal, but it was also a lot of fun to watch.

Cher is a little plastic in the role of club-owner, but makes it work for her, while Stanley Tucci takes every gay stereotype you can imagine and throws them back at you in a dazzling role, taking care of the girls backstage. Eric Dane and Cam Gigandet are solid and play the rivals for Ali's heart, while I liked Alan Cumming's portrayal of Alexis, the door manager, and owner of some great facial gestures. The dancers are solid and believable, kind enough to each other to be friends and just bitchy enough to be real.

4038619,4,B002ZG9774,"Burlesque may not be the newest story with its somewhat predictable plot; but the film is rather enjoyable nonetheless. Its strength comes from the multiple musical numbers and the acting of the main characters since the somewhat campy plot is not the deepest and the action takes its time to play out. Cher, Stanley Tucci, Christina Aguilera and Cam Gigandet of Twilight fame provide wonderful performances. In addition, the choreography and cinematography are excellent; and the musical score enhances the film quite a bit.

When the film starts, we quickly meet Ali (short for ""Alice,"" played by Christina Aguilera) who works in a local bar in a small town in Iowa. Although she's rather young, Ali believes in herself, knows she has talent--and she's convinced she's going nowhere fast. She travels by bus to Los Angeles and after some pushing finds work in a burlesque nightclub that has seen better days owned primarily by Tess (Cher) with Tess' ex Vince (Peter Gallagher) having a partial financial interest in the club. Ali also makes friends with a bartender named Jack (Cam Gigandet) and this proves helpful when her apartment is broken into--Ali's savings has been stolen and Jack (who has a fiance) lets Ali stay at his place until Ali can get another home and become more settled.

Of course, things get more complicated. Ali and Jack start noticing each other while Jack's fiance Natalie (Dianna Agron) is in New York doing a play. Ali eventually makes her way onto the stage in Tess' club as a dancer just like she dreamed of doing--but a real surprise comes when jealous dancer Nikki (Kristen Bell) pulls the plug on the lip-synching music and Ali must face the crowd and sing.

In addition, Eric Dane does a good job of playing Marcus, a rich guy who buys his way into getting everything he ever wants--including Tess' club so he can use it according to his own plans. Tess must find a way to keep her club which is running dangerously low on funds to make payments and stay open; and things look pretty bleak; it would break Tess' heart to lose or even sell her club.

You might think I already gave away too much; but I assure you that I haven't. Moreover, I won't say much more for fear of adding spoilers; suffice it to say that you will be struck by the musical numbers in this film. Christina Aguilera in her very first film already seems destined to become a film star seemingly effortlessly!

The DVD comes with alternate footage that I liked and there is a short of ""bloopers.""

Overall, Burlesque probably won't win Best Picture at Oscar time but it's entertaining nonetheless. Fans of the actors in the film will want this for their collections; and people who enjoy musicals with a side dish of camp will want this, too.",1307404800,3,2749,4.704781704781705
4038620,5,B002ZG9774,"If you missed this movie in the theater; purchase the DVD, you won't be disappointed.  My 18 year old daughter (a dancer) really enjoyed it as well.

4038621,3,B002ZG9774,"I genuinely enjoyed the music, dancing and costumes in this, especially the more classic Burlesque pieces, with their sexy-funny-teasy-edgy flair. But the writing and acting was soooooo bad. My husband and I found ourselves just grimacing and groaning through certain scenes, especially those between Christina Aguilara and her love interest in the movie, played by Cam Gigandet from Twilight. Every line was a cliche, and even the best of actors (and these two are not) could not have saved them. I was also disappointed in Cher, who didn't feel very invested in the movie - she seemed to be phoning it in. Stanley Tucci was entertaining, and the only time I saw any of Cher's usual spark was in her scenes with him. The storyline had many loopholes, and basically was on the level of a cheesy TV episode.

But the music, costumes and dancing were great, so I had fun during all of that. I think this movie was marketed poorly - they should have played up the campiness and everyone might have overlooked the bad writing/acting. But the studio tried to position it as a classy drama/musical, ala Chicago or Moulin Rouge, and the performances just weren't at that level. Then they threw in some scenes that stank of contract fulfillment - a complete non-sequitor Cher singing scene for instance - that undermined the integrity of the movie completely.

I appreciate the 5-star reviewers here taking issue with the critics' panning of this movie, but I think they are over-correcting. Critics said it was a 1 or 2 star film, I think the music/dance productions get it to a 3-star, but 5-star? Come on!",1307318400,3,1600,4.793478260869565

So you get the kind of ratings pattern you'd expect for a true classic.  Tons of five star reviews, with but a few discouraging words.  We saw it for laughs, thinking it would be good camp fun...not really.  But it was somewhat better than I expected, perhaps because I had seen the true crap-fest known as Country Strong only a week earlier.  Burlesque isn't that bad, mainly because it has no illusions about being anything but a homage to vastly better films.

4038662,5,B002ZG9774,"It's truly hard to take a story line that has been done thousands of times from all all angles, but this movie did it.  The fact is that not since Chicago, a broadway smash success prior to its movie run, have I been so entertained by a movie musical!  Both Cher and Christina Aguilera were simply amazing.  The story itself is a replay, and without the outstanding singing, would have been an average film, but this, film wasn't just about being a film.  it is a musical in the traditional sense of the word, and the best musical that I have seen since, 2003, when I saw Chicago.  Eric Dane and Stanley Tucci, were good, but unfortunately, played roles so similar their previous work in ""The Devil Wears Prada"", that I feel that both were type cast, based on their outstanding performances in that Movie.  I am so used to seeing Cam Gigandet playing the bad guy, I wasn't sure that he was going to be able to pull off the ""Good Guy"", but he did and he did it extremely well.  Both Cher and Christina were amazing, just superb.  Why this movie was written off as mediocre, in my opinion, was based on trying to fit this movie into a dramatic category, rather than basing it on its merit as a musical.  Don't pass this up.  Watch it, or better yet just close your eyes and listen the the singing and enjoy!",1305331200,3,1305,4.333333333333333

It's just a shame that money gets spent on such crap when there are talented actors, writers and directors waiting to get their pieces produced.  I can buy (though unwillingly) that they had to hire CA and Cher for their big star names, but what about the rest of the cast?

I thought the film and performances were well done.  It's not Moonstruck but it is a love story of many types.  The film was low key and lacked a lot of the stressful tension and excitement I fear lots of younger generations of films goers have grown addicted to, with things flying at you and flashing at you from everywhere.  I was expecting something more intense and tailored to a more adult audience but was pleasantly surprised at how well they presented the rough life of burlesque.  That rough side having been portrayed in older films, though the entertainment still persists today.  Chers solo performances were fantastic especially Burlesque.

I thought the film was enjoyably entertaining and there are some surprises. No blatant nudity.",1304640000,,896,4.810457516339869

The acting is so-so, the songs are good and Cher..well she's just plain scary. At one stage I had to do a double-take as I thought she was wearing a Michael Myers hockey mask..but no..it was her face! Xtina has the voice, but it was a laugh when they ""changed"" from miming cd's to well..Xtina miming her songs lol.
If you have a few hours to kill and a good surround with a decent sub crank it, if not I'd give it a pass.
Also I found it funny that Xtina's own stage show outfits were raunchier than anything she wore in Burlesque and NO nudity to speak of.

Others claimed they cried-- the only cry I had was after Cher's absurdly melodramatic numbers, and my tears welled up as part of the laughing fit that I had to contain so as not to disturb the other poor folks who also made the mistake of buying a ticket to this camp fest.

All he needed was a black top hat, cane, and mustache to put us back a century where we could watch Mary Pickford play Christina Aguilera's part.  But those folks really had writers working on the word titles-- they could think of a more realistic love story than where Ali (Christina Aguilera) finally falls in love with Jack and after their night together, she can only say, ""I'm so glad you're not gay."" I also was turned off by the double standard. No put downs were delivered about women who might be gay. Cher and Christina were a love story waiting to happen themselves.

No gruesome gore, no loud endless bombs and blasting, no filthy vulgar language, just a great piece of entertainment. Great music, predictable story-line (nothing that keeps you biting your nails off), great actresses, just a simple great movie. There's something wonderful to be said for ""mindless entertainment"" at times when you just want to relax, have some popcorn with your honey and enjoy a good show. That's the reason I'm purchasing this video, you can't always find a good movie like this when a rainy evening presents itself! Now we'll have it on hand.",1302912000,,713,4.95

Know going into this that it is all about the show, the costumes, the numbers the sheer spectacle of it all.  If that is what you are watching the movie for you will see great dance numbers, and phenomenal singing.  The story is pretty flimsy, but I wasn't watching this for a deep and meaningful story-line, I was watching it for its sheer entertainment value, and for that I got everything I had hoped for.

The movie was actually more than I had expected and my husband and I both enjoyed it.  So, if you just need to sit back and get out of your head for a while and love to watch good entertainment, I'd give it a go!",1302825600,,876,4.246987951807229

Alright alright, the story line isn't too hateful and let's face it, Christina and Cher have got a great set of pipes (those girls can SING)!

If you need some brownie points with the Mrs., buy this (flowers and chocolate work too).

4038839,3,B002ZG9774,"Ingredients:

1 Mary Sue female protagonist.  Preferred traits: American (from a small town), white, young, sexy but not in a flagrant ""slutty"" way, hugely talented, determined, befriends/bewitches all she meets, bends the rules but never gets into any real trouble from it, gets a job by simply picking up a tray and starting to wait tables, can learn dance moves in a few weeks during her work as a waitress in Club, earns grudging respect from ""enemies"", able to resolve conflicts in a single bound, best if played by a former pop starlet who has decent acting talents

1 actor/singer in a comeback role.  Best if actor/singer was greatly loved and drawn out of retirement for this role.

Several decent actors and actresses thrown at cliched or underused roles to taste.

1 drunken/high rival who succumbs to the Power of the Mary Sue.  Choose a mild rival, one that doesn't do anything too mean and ""rival-y"".

Several mildly sexual dance numbers with Mary Sue, but do not recreate anything as risque as an actual Burlesque show.

1 song number with comeback singer/actor that is thrown awkwardly into the plot.  Optional: Make the song one about ""overcoming"" some undefined ""obstacle"".

2 Love Interests.  Love Interest A (may or may not be the first guy Mary Sue meets) must be sweet, romantic and witty.  Love Interest B must be a super wealthy businessman wanting to buy the Club, who will drop the Chekov's Gun so Mary Sue can solve the problem and will disappear from the movie when True LoveTM conquers all.

1 discreet sex scene with Love Interest A.  Best if this scene is intercut with a melodic ballad about True LoveTM sung while Mary Sue is dressed in a classy evening gown at the Club.

5+ plot lines.  One must be the Romantic Triangle.  Please choose remaining from the following: drunken Rival, Divorced Club Owners working together, Gay Best Friend who can't have a decent relationship, the Club is closing because the Owners need X dollars in Y months (X MUST BE much, much greater than Y), Club Owner and one of the dancers has a falling out wherein dancer says she slept with Club Owner's husband, Love Interest A is a Songwriter, Love Interest A is engaged but will let his sexy ""Friend"" stay with him for an indeterminate amount of time, Love Interest B was never Rival's ""boyfriend""

Gather ingredients in a large, flashy location (Los Angeles works if New York City is not available).  Toss indiscriminantly for two hours; Serve immediately.

Now, despite all that I've written above...the movie actually isn't half bad.  Yes, it's cliched, yes, Christina's character is a glaring Mary Sue, yes, the characters are one dimensional.  But if you expect that going in (like I did), there is a lot you can enjoy.

Christina Aguilera isn't a half bad actress.  The only reason she doesn't get higher marks in my book is because her character is so painfully cliched, and Christina never tried to add any depth to that portrayal.  But she does sing well (for those that like her brand of singing), and her dancing is WOW!  Cher is amazing.  She lit up the screen every time she was on, and I thought her portrayal of a club owner about to go under was one of the most convincing I've ever seen.  I loved her musical numbers as well and wished she had sung more.  Stanley Tucci was stunning.  Sure, he is yet again Gay Best Friend, but he does it well without coming off too cliched.  And his chemistry against Cher was pure joy.  Some of the musical numbers were bland (another version of ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend""?), but others were really great (the last number was really catchy).

So, if you are a Cher or Christina Aguilera fan, you will probably love this.  If you love musicals, you will probably also like this (maybe not as much, since it is cliched).  It's not the most original movie out there, but it isn't the worst I've ever seen.

4038845,5,B002ZG9774,"Although the plot was predictable and weak, I thought the musical numbers were fantastic. Christina Aguilera's acting was pretty good, Cher was Cher, and Kristen Bell... is hot. I give Burlesque 5 stars because I love the music and any musical that can make a pop cover of Marilyn Manson's ""The Beautiful People"" work, deserves props.",1302220800,,334,4.982142857142857

Might sound a little lame, but what a fun movie!!  You can absolutely forgive anything about the script because the performances are OUTSTANDING!!  Most definitely a feel good movie with heart and humor.  Oh and did I mention CHER was amazing, as always. This woman belongs in front of a camera.  Excellent performances by all.  Bravo and thank you! I bought it the minute my rental ended.",1302048000,,522,4.7444444444444445
4038859,5,B002ZG9774,"OMG! This movie is AMAZING! I had seen this movie in the theaters, and was VERY excited when I did. Honestly, pairing Christina Aguilera and Cher in a film that involves singing not only combines two of the greatest female vocalists of our time, but also creates a multi generational gathering for the pros that grew up with Cher when she was with Sonny, aNd the people that have grown up with Christina. The music in this film is wonderful, combining today pop sound with the sounds of the old burlesque cabarets, and the cast couldn't be better! Stanley Tucci always puts in a top notch performance, but add Kristen Bell, and Peter Gallagher, and you've definitely got a hit! I LOVED this movie. Usually when a musician stars in a movie, it spells the end for his/her career (unless you're Cher), but Christina definitely keeps you listening to every song that is in this movie with her amazing voice. This match was definitely made in heaven, and I applaud whomever is responsible for pairing Christina and Cher together.",1301961600,3,1024,4.726256983240224

4038862,3,B002ZG9774,"I've read some of the other reviews here and much as I like Cher, Christina and Stanley Tucci, it must be said that they do their best with surprisingly trite material.  I've seen a lot of comparisons to CHICAGO here but there are other musicals which this clearly aspires to equal but it never makes it.  Those are MOULIN ROUGE, DREAMGIRLS, STAR IS BORN, CABARET and FUNNY GIRL.  This film is closer to DREAMGIRLS on what it attains than any of the others.  The others have better scriots and better music.  They all share the girl who starts out with nothing but her raw talent, gets a break and becomes a sensation. Will success ruin her and her falling in love with her true love?

There is nothing new in this story and it is not as well presented as it was in the other above named musicals.  Also, you will not leave the theater humming the music you heard in the show for the next week.

If the script was removed and instead this became a performance film with the two leads, I would probably give it at least one more star. I found myself waiting for the musical numbers because the.script was so derivative and bad.

Why do so many viewers like it then?  One certainly is compelled to say that Christina Aguilera gives this her all.  We always knew she was a great singer but here she also shows she can dance and act.  I would love to see her in a better musical vehicle.  Cher, of course, is always marvelous too and she doesn't disappoint here as the woman who owns the theater and gives the girl her break.  Stanley Tucci is her marvelous gay best friend.  Two men are the love interests.  The nice one is indeed very attractive.  The creep is yes, a creep.  There is nothing new or dynamic that they add to the film and it might have added something to put in men with some musical talent instead.  All those criticizing CHICAGO fail to mention that Richard Gere did great dance sequences and John C Reilley did a great musical number, CELLOPHANE.

4038863,4,B002ZG9774,"I consider myself a film fanatic, movie know-it-all, and amatuer critic.  I watched this movie fully expecting to hate it.  I watched it again to try and find fault with it, and again when I came to terms with the fact that I was in love.  Of course the plot line is predictable, look at the genre, it's a musical/rom-com.  Beyond that there is something indescribable that pulls you into this movie.  Stanely Tucci is amazing as per usual, Cher is CHER, Christina's voice, body and chemistry with her leading man, the dancing; I haven't yet decided which one of these factors makes me love it so much, but I'll watch it again and again until I figure it out.",1301875200,,659,4.458333333333333

4038867,3,B002ZG9774,"I gave this film 3 stars because the singing and dancing was out of this world great.  Christina Aguilera has a voice that comes along once in a generation, and who knew that she could dance as well?  With this package I'll overlook that C rated acting skills.  As the star of this show, Christina gives it her all and that's a lot of star power.  She lights up the screen with her talent, though the writers of the script didn't give her much to work with.  Christina is a small town girl ready for the big time who seeks fame and fortune in L.A., who happens into a burlesque club owned by Cher.

Now, if you've seen Coyote Ugly, you've seen this movie, so don't go looking for something new and original, but what Burlesque does give you is a feast for the eyes.  Obviously all the money that was spent on making this movie went towards the costumes, choreography, and sets, not the writers.  In fact, I would guess that writers of this movie must have been relative(s) because the characters' development and the dialogue are painfully awful.  Cher's character is tough as nails one minute, and crying like baby the next.  Christina's character is innocent one minute, and worldly-wise the next.

Christina's love interest, Jack, comes off a guy who's been around the block, and as a bartender at a Burlesque club, you'd expect him to be, yet he buys Christina a drink right away, and offers to vouch for her if she needs a job reference.  Huh?  Does he do this with every attractive female who walks into the place? Or is this just lazy plotting.  In the beginning he wears enough make up to be mistaken for a drag queen, but once its established that he's not gay, and this is just for laughs, he lightens up on the eyeliner, and then stops wearing it for the rest of the movie.

And for an innocent small-time girl, Christina starts off the movies stealing from her 'evil' boss, but tries to give the other waitress part of the stolen money to buy her child a bike.  Then she closes up the restaurant and sings her heart out.  So what kind of diner closes in between lunch and dinner?  None that I've ever seen.  Again, another lazy plot device so we can watch Christina sing. Again, wow, can that girl sing!

I'm not sure what all the shots of Patron were about except maybe as product placement because they didn't seem to have any other reason for being.  If drinking were important to the movie, and there was one gal with a drinking problem, then just a shot glass or some stumbling around on the dance floor, could have gotten the point across just fine.

I thought the movie was way too long.  Since the story was pretty much an after-thought, the writers should have just gone with the singing and dancing numbers and cut most of the dialogue out.

All of the stars I gave this movie are for the singing and dancing.  Even Cher sounded better than I've ever heard her.  Both Christina and Cher are legends deserve better writers.",1301875200,5,2944,4.45607476635514
4038878,5,B002ZG9774,I didn't get to see this movie in the theater and I had been putting it off to rent at the RedBox because I just wasn't sure I'd be all that interested in a musical based movie.  I am not a big fan of musicals... although I don't knock them... just never really been into them.  Well I am a fan of both Cher and Christina and decided to just go for it and rent the movie because I knew that even if I didn't care for the movie these two ladies would at least entertain me with their musical talent....... let me tell you I was insanely hooked on this movie after watching it the first time.  I loved Cher and her characters sassy attitude and was pleased to see that Christina actually has some acting talent.  The movie has a very nice cast of great actors/actresses and while the movie's theme about a small town girl going big star overnight might be old this movie does not disappoint in the entertainment category.  The whole movies is beautifully filmed.  The song selections and choreography is fun and Christina's vocals are extremely powerful.  I am so amazed that such a powerful voice can come out of such a small lady lol.,1301788800,,1134,4.345971563981043

I'm a big fan of Christina, I thought for her first film her acting wasn't bad at all. Let's be honest here, it could have been worse. I've seen actresses who make their living acting do a terrible job.  I love Cam (won't even attempt to spell his last name :)) and I do wish the love story between the two had been a bit stronger . . . Cher was wonderful and witty, as always. I'm a huge fan of Kristen Bell too, and I thought she was a very convincing as the bitchy jealous type.

4038881,4,B002ZG9774,"This has what Chicago 2002 doesn`t: great musical talents in the leading roles. It suffers from a weak script, but improved upon by the star quality of the three principals; Cher, Anguilera and Gigandet.

The musical numbers however are ace and reminiscent of the 1972 Cabaret starring Liza Minnelli, Joel Grey and Michael York.

Christina steals the show and the only real weak spot is the intro to Cher`s big number ""You Haven`t Seen the Last of Me!"" - the dj asks - ""have you got the time to do it""(or something like that) and she answers ""Oh I completely forgot.... yeah ok - let`s do it"".. ooooh woops....

Cher is GREAT in her first song, and pours her heart and soul into the second one.  She hasn't lost anything over time.  Christina Aguilera is simply amazing!

As far as the blu-ray disc goes...right at the end of the movie (maybe about 1/8th of the movie left to go) the audio did not match up with the video.

I did not know that Julianne Hough (Dancing With The Stars) was in the movie until I watched it. She does a fabulous job as well. I'm surprised this movie did not get more awards than it did, especially when it comes to the musical performances. Yes, the storyline is a little cliche and predictable, but Christina's vocals and performances more than make up for the writing. Stanley Tucci does an excellent job and I love the storyline between him and Cher. I've watched this movie at least 30 times since I bought it and it just keeps getting better.

This movie is dramatic, exciting, happy, sad, wonderful. I watched it without my husband home thinking he wouldn't be interested, was I wrong. he will love this and I can't wait for him to get home and watch it with me.
Great movie, watch it. Any critics that didn't like it have no concept of true artistic style and the meaning of burlesque, it's style. It is nughty, sexy, never dirty. Erotic. This is all of that but since it is naughty, parents watch before to see if your young ones should watch. It is a true PG 13.  Politics could only be involved giving this anything but a great review.

If on the otherhand you are not offended ny this the movie will quickly move from a 1 to a solid 3-4 for you. If you enjoy such themes and enjoy dance I think you will give it a 5. If you enjoyed queen of the Moulin Rouge ,Pracilla Queen of the Desert, Mama Mia, and Black Swan this is a must watch.

4038950,4,B002ZG9774,"The plot is simple: girl from Midwest comes to LA to make it big. No surprise there. The big surprise is Christina Aguilera and the caliber of acting from the stars that makes ""Burlesque"" the show to watch. ""Burlesque"" is the movie that ""Showgirls"" never was and never will be, sex with heart.

Stanley Tucci is superb as the gay dresser and Cher's (Tess) best friend. He is at his campy best and Cher isn't far behind, playing the owner with vamp appeal and a world-weary brittleness that is vintage Cher. She does need to stop with the collagen injections; her mouth is far too stiff, but her voice, like a fine Napoleon Brandy, has improved with age.

The real star of ""Burlesque"" is the stunning and sweet Christina Aguilera, whose voice is as rich as her style. She plays naive and eager Ali on a believable note that is almost as good as her singing. The dancing is a little less than perfect, but, like Stanley Tucci says, you can't take your eyes off her.",1301184000,,963,4.465909090909091

4038953,4,B002ZG9774,"From my wife Sarah: If I could, I'd give this movie 3 1/2 stars. Still, if you like musicals, Cher or Christina Aguilera, this movie is definitely worth viewing. While there are some serious flaws with this movie, it's got some great points.

The theme: A small town waitress with no family or prospects leaves for Hollywood and lands a waitress job in a burlesque style club. She fights her way into the show. The club is in danger of closing since it's balloon payment mortgage is about to come due.

Here's the good and the bad.

GOOD POINTS:

1. The music sequences are extremely well done. The visuals are beautiful. The dancers are fantastic. The dancing is almost a cross between Bob Fosse style and the old movie Cabaret - but more modern and more sensual.

2. The singing was fantastic. No one can doubt that Christina Aguilera can bat it out of the park when she sings. And Cher fans will love her two musical numbers.

2. Cher can act. I've always been a fan of her movies. She has the best developed character in the movie. Her friendship with Stanly Tucci's character was believable and sincere. She's always a pleasure to watch. She can take a shallow script and add depth to it just by her expressions.

THE NOT SO GOOD:

1. The theme is simplistic and it's been done before - for decades - with variations but always pretty much the same. The story was very tired.

2. The script was basically shallow. Christina's character was shallow. The decisions she made were unbelievable because there was no depth to her character or her relationships.

Her love interest was shallow. There was just about no chemistry between them. No heat, and no longing. They came off as superficial pals. It seemed to be a very immature relationship. It was hard to care about whether they ended up together.

Christina's relationship with Cher was shallow. It was supposed to look like mother/daughter bonding. It was necessary to explain some of Christina's actions. It didn't work so it made other things seem unbelievable.

3. The music though incredibly well performed, won't leave most people humming or singing the songs. Others may feel differently, but for me there were no numbers that were particularly memorable such as in some of the great musicals like Chicago.

Despite all of the above, I'd still recommend watching this movie if you love musicals, Cher or Christina. I'd just rent it before deciding to buy.

Moms and dads, please note that this movie is not for kids. The dancing and costumes are far too sensual for them. Also, though sex isn't explicit, it's implied between various partners of multiple orientations, several times throughout the movie. There's also a dancer who is alcoholic, and all the dancers and leads drink pretty much constantly, including doing shots a lot.",1301184000,,2798,4.766045548654244
4038954,4,B002ZG9774,"I really expected this movie to be crapola. I wasn't going to watch it, but I did and I am glad. It was actually really good. It reminds me of Coyote Ugly a little bit, but in a weird Broadway way. Christina plays a seemingly young and innocent girl that needs money, and she ends up waitressing in an supposedly seedy establishment. By working there she becomes entranced with the show and fixated on becoming one of the dancers. She keeps pushing until Cher finally says ""okay"". It gets better from there with jealousy, sabotage, a love interest, and with Christina overcoming the obstacles.",1301184000,,593,4.711538461538462

4038980,5,B002ZG9774,"I watched this the other day and all I can say is it was amazing! The movie tells the story of Alice Marilyn ""Ali"" Rose (played by Christina Aguilera), a small town girl from Iowa, who dreams of a better life as a singer in Los Angles. After getting settled in she hits the town and finds the club known as Burlesque. She enters the club as the co-owner of the club named Tess (played by Cher) sings the club's theme song ""Welcome to Burlesque"". As Alice watches Tess perform she realizes this is the hope she'd been looking for. While at the bar Alice meets and makes friends with the bartender, Jack (played by Cam Gigandet), whom she assumes to be gay due to his outward appearance, who tells her to let Tess know he sent her, so as she goes to pursue this, Tess and her long-time friend, Sean (played by Stanley Tucci) shoot her down and she begins to wait tables, without anyone but Jack's knowledge until Tess catches her and to Alice's luck Jack comes to her rescue claiming he hired her, but Tess knows better but allows it anyway with a warning to ""Never pull that again"". Soon after she starts going under the name Ali. As time goes by Ali watches the dancers and memorizing their routines in her mind. She soon starts to try and press her opinions on Tess to help raise money for the club by allowing the girl dancers to sing live instead of lip-syncing since the audience has seen the acts and the girls do it several times and the routine is running old but Tess, stubborn as she is, refuses to listen and has Ali brushed back to wait tables. Not too long after that Ali returns home to find her apartment broken into, with no where to go or anyone one else to turn to she runs to Jack, who allows her to stay with him until she can find a new place. The next day Ali finds out that Jack is not gay, but that he's engaged and tries to leave but Jack won't let her cause the weather is horrible. The story goes on pretty much the same with the exception that I forgot to mention that Tess' ex-husband, Vincent (played by Peter Gallagher), who is the other co-owner of Burlesque is trying to get Tess' half of the money for the club but soon gives up and starts trying to convince her to let them sell to Marcus (played by Eric Dane), a greedy and money hungry man who will do what every he can to get what he wants. In the end its Ali, who eventually ends up a dancer, who saves Burlesque twice, once by singing live due to Nikki (played by Kristen Bell) trying to sabotage her cause Tess sent Nikki home early due to her being drunk and sent Ali out in her place and once again towards the end of the film.

4038982,5,B002ZG9774,"I already knew that I would find something to love in this movie, if only because it featured the iconic Cher, who I have adored since her Sonny & Cher Show days when I was in high school.
  Not being a particular Christina fan, however, I was also prepared to find things not to love, especially in light of the less than favorable reviews that the movie received.
  As I watched, the three main thoughts that kept running through my mind were:

1) OMG--Cher is still absolutely amazing!!
2) Wow--Christina is actually really good in this--natural acting, great voice, totally acquitting herself well in her first film effort
3) I can't believe that the critics bashed this movie the way they did--they're all too elitist for their own damn good!

  Yes, this is an old-fashioned, seen-it-a-hundred-times plot line about a country girl trying to make good in the big city. And yes, it pretty much hits on all the old cliches: . . .
*the wide-eyed innocent who succeeds against all odds by virtue of her explosive raw talent
*the tough but tender Tess who gives her a chance despite her  initial reservations
*the witty, fabulously supportive gay BFF who's hopelessly devoted to Diva Tess
*the scheming,jealous leading lady soon to be ousted by the 'new kid'
*the cute, charming, almost too-good-to-be-true boyfriend with the requisite bitchy ex-girlfriend and a way with those packaged cookies!
*the sexy but devious villain who the girls manage to outsmart in the end

 . . . and yes it's all pure sentimental, predictable corniness.
  But all these so-called ""faults"" were the very things I loved about it. It was an old-school over-the-top musical extravaganza with comfortable time-tested themes, uncomplicated emotions,lavish musical numbers, and lots of hot girls in sumptuous costumes showing us how they Burlesque! And--sorry, movie critics--but what the heck is wrong with that??

4039002,2,B002ZG9774,"I don't know what I was expecting from ""Burlesque"", but it disappointed me on nearly every level. It's basically just a vehicle for Christina Aguilera. Let's go through the threadbare plot first...small town waitress Aguilera dreams of being on stage. She quits the day job and goes to LA...stumbling across a Burlesque club run by Cher, she wangles herself a waitress job, then eventually wangles her way onto the stage as a dancer and then - yes! - her big break suddenly comes when she unexpectedly bursts into live song and the audience is blown away. Well, the fictious audience in the film is, anyway. The real audience watching this movie will have seen that coming while they were outside buying tickets to get in.

It's not a badly made film, it's just so awfully lame. Christina can act passably, but she suggests no depth whatsoever: she just reads the lines and leaves it at that. Cher is much more interesting (as I expected), although with her botoxed face, the acting skills that previously shone in films like ""Mask"" have all but vanished - at one point she comforts a character with a hug, and then ""poignantly"" grimaces behind his back - but she can't even move her face enough do it! The bald guy with glasses who played the sharp-tongued gay stylist in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" turns up playing an exact same character here...how lazy. And the sub-plot involving the former star of the show who is upstaged by Aguilera is as weak as dishwater. Her one big act of sabotage is to switch off the pre-recorded vocals that the girls are miming to right in the middle of Aguilera's turn. Oh but - what a surprise - Christina chucks the mike away and belts out the vocals herself and saves the show. Where's the tension in rivalry when we all saw that one coming a mile off? Even ""Showgirls"" had more convincing back-stabbing than this.

Further things that fall flat are the songs that punctuate the running time. Apart from plenty of the show numbers, we get Christina belting (she belts most things) out a number alone in her diner with a mop, then a bit later on we get Cher ostensibly rehearsing a song, which is an ""I Will Survive"" style torch song about being strong and not giving up, played just after her character has come to the edge of despair over huge debts. I mean, give us some credit here - we do get it! Plus there's no way the song she sings would ever be featured in the show - what burlesque audience would pay to see an song like that? Having her rehearse a happy song but showing her sorrow in an undercurrent would have been far more rivetting. Same goes for Christina later on, when the character finds true love (oh you knew that, didn't you?), the scene is immediately followed by her singing a sultry slow song about true love... wearing an evening gown! Again rather odd because the club earns it's money by the performers singing raunchy songs while dressed like strippers. Again, it's sledgehammer symbolism that insults the viewers intelligence.

The only high points of the film are Cher, who steals the show (shame about the wax facial expression), and if you're a Christina fan, she does her thing as well as in any of her music videos - which is all this is really. A lot like the video to ""Lady Marmalade"", but without all the other girls. But apart from that it's dull, dull, DULL. I watched it on a plane, and it was about my 3rd choice. I think thats the best I can say about it.",1300406400,8,3432,4.514469453376206

4039006,2,B002ZG9774,"Primarily a vehicle for Christina Aguilera, ""Burlesque"" (2010) emerges as a colorful mess awash in B-movie clichs. Unfortunately, this musical drama lacks the classic Hollywood spark it desperately wants to recapture. Top-billed Cher has limited screen time as the club matriarch  the same goes for Stanley Tucci's stage manager. The appealing Aguilera belts out a few strong numbers, but her acting is passable at best. By comparison, Cher sings only two songs: the engaging ""Welcome to Burlesque"" and the painfully overwrought ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me."" Writer-director Steven Antin has no idea what he's doing and hopes something will stick. ""Burlesque"" runs an unwieldy two hours, yet would have been more effective in half the time. Blink and you will miss Alan Cumming in a poorly conceived cameo.",1300320000,7,811,5.2384615384615385

It's always great to see Cher, and it was about time she made another movie. What a comeback after all this time !!! What can I say about Christina? She's gorgeous. A more than fair start for a newcomer in front of a camera. Honestly, the movie deserved more prizes. It should have been nominated for several academy awards. Anyway, I'd like to keep writing, but you'd better find out for yourselves if you haven't seen the movie yet. Don't waste any more of your time reading my review. Hurry, go see the movie, what are you waiting for?
By the way, this might be very, very interesting to overseas customers like me: The blu-ray edition WILL play anywhere. I didn't know till I got it. I must confess that I took the risk and purchased it anyway. Luckily, it turned out right, thank God. It is region A, B, C, not region 1 ( or A), as the Amazon details read. I hope they don't take this comment the wrong way, but they should provide the right information so we know what we can or cannot purchase for sure without taking any misleading steps.

SPECIAL FEATURES
-6 Exclusive Song Performances
I thought this meant NEW performances that didn't appear in the film.  But sadly, that just meant performances of ""Something's Got A Hold On Me (Dancers Version)"" (which is just the instrumental opening number), Kristen Bell's uncut performance of ""Long John Blues"", uncut performances of ""Express"" and ""A Guy What Takes His Time"", the Alan Cumming number ""That's Life"" and another number.  The ""uncut"" performances were fine the way they were in the film, I didn't need them ""uncut"", I would've preferred NEW performances
-Alternate Opening
Where Christina Aguilera performs ""Something's Got A Hold On Me"" right when the movie starts without interruptions and then the film takes on from there, with her counting the tips on the bar with the other lady
-Blooper Reel
Nothing much I can say besides it's pretty funny. I always like gag reels haha

4039042,5,B002ZG9774,"My husband and I watched this on pay-per-view this past weekend; boy, has Cher still got the voice.  Christina has always been one of my favorites, and she was at her all-time best.  She can dance as well as she sings; can we say Broadway musical? We do regret not going to the theater and seeing it, because of the AWESOME music; it would have sounded way beyond great. One more thing: what woman do you know, at 65-years-old, still looks and sings THAT AWESOME?  No one but CHER!!",1300060800,,482,4.393258426966292
4039043,5,B002ZG9774,"Christina plays a small town girl who leaves town and her Mickey Mouse life and heads to LA during the credits. In LA she is attracted to a 1920's style burlesque club. The small club puts on a large theater type show with costumes and a band. So even with the $20 cover charge, on a great night they wouldn't come close to breaking even, let alone pay the band, which is more like a small orchestra. I'm not sure why they even have a band since most of the girls lip sync. The club has a surreal appearance and the men who work there are dressed as gang characters from ""Clockwork Orange"" complete with the derby and eye make-up, although they incorrectly make-up both eyes instead of just one.

Christina works as a waitress at the club and desires to be a star on this sinking ship. The star of the show is a problem child who shows up late and has an attitude. It doesn't take any imagination to figure out how this turns out. Christina belts out a few good numbers, but when she is not singing and dancing she really isn't acting. Cher does a fine job of acting and makes the rest of the crew look like a high school drama club.

Cher belts one out too. This movie is set up as a ""pass the torch"" symbolism. We saw how well that worked with the Madonna/Brittney/Christina kiss-NOT!

The movie is worth 5 stars on the strength of Christina's singing and Cher's acting.",1299974400,,1372,4.310077519379845
4039044,4,B002ZG9774,"Going into the movie you just know the formula and fortunately for the viewer it delivers.  Christina has the right pipes to deliver and Cher is her usual stunning self, albeit with slightly more lips.  The persona of the club, the owner's love of the culture that make up dying breeds, the competition for attention from the dancers all add up to an engaging movie that leaves you wanting it to go on.

Even at the start its hard to believe Christina could be just a waitress and then the adventure begins.  One of chasing your dreams and letting it go.  Overall a very satisfying experience that leads one to dream, and want to visit the Beall and Bourbon streets of the world to drink in all that we were and can still be.",1299974400,,725,4.380597014925373
4039045,5,B002ZG9774,"I have always wanted to go and see Burlesque at the cinema but never got round to seeing it, unfortunately. As it had received really good movie reviews and won a Golden Globe award for best song from a motion picture, which was written by Diane Warren and sung brilliantly by Legend that is Cher.

I knew it was going to be good because it had American/latina singer Christina Aguilera, who does her big-screen debut,also starring Cher, Cam Gigandet from Twilight, and Stanley Tucci from The Devil Wears Prada.

Burlesque tells the story of a small-town girl with a big voice from Iowa called Ali, played superbly by Christina Aguilera, who gets on a bus and follows her dream of becoming a singer to LA. She finds the Burlesque club where she meets the very attractive bartender, Jack, played by Cam Gigandet and tells her where to meet the club's boss Tess, played by Cher. Ali meets the bitchy Nikki, played by Kristen Bell, who makes her life hell. Sean is Tess's best friend played by Stanley Tucci. Ali meet a very handsome man who wants to buy the club from Tess called Marcus played by Eric Dane. She is charmed by his millions and his talk. But she finds herself falling for her friend and roommate and bartender, Jack, when they spend more time together at the club when Ali lands herself a job there as a waitress and then lets everyone know she has a voice. A VERY BIG VOICE. And soon Ali and her voice is Burlesque's attraction bringing in more customers than ever before. Ali and Jack fall in love and end up spending the night together until his fiancee, Natalie, from New York, arrives back, and all hell breaks loose. Anyway, Ali and Tess manage to keep the club from selling to Marcus who wants to turn it into houses. Jack tells Ali how sorry he is and that he ended it with Natalie and that he loves her and she forgives him. So they live happily ever after.

I was completely mesmorised by both Christina Aguilera and Cher's vocal and acting abilities. Considering this was Aguilera's debut movie, she was absolutely spectacular in singing and in acting. You would think she had been into acting for years not starting out. All the actors were great. Kristen Bell was great as bitchy and jealous Nikki who dyed her hair from blonde to a brunette for the part. Burlesque had spectacular and mesmorising musical numbers sung by Aguilera and Cher like ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me"", ""Something's got a Hold on Me"", ""A Guy That Takes His Time"", ""Bound To You"", written by Aguilera. And ""But I am a good girl,"" and many more.

Burlesque is a real feel good, girl flick but can also be enjoyed watching by everyone. If people like musicals, romance and drama, then this film is for you. See it now! YOu'll LOVE IT!",1299974400,,2734,4.517171717171717
4039046,4,B002ZG9774,"I'm no expert on acting, but I'll tell the world it didn't take long at all for me to buy into Christina Aguilera as a small town girl aspiring to be a singer. And, yeah, I know the singing part isn't that far a stretch from Aguilera's wheelhouse. But as a first time actress, she also handles her business. So, take that, Mariah Carey.

BURLESQUE doesn't climb the heights of CHICAGO, and the plot is a far cry from innovative. All the tropes and archetypes of a musical are here and you can check them off the list one by one. When Ali (Aguilera) quits her waitressing gig in Iowa and relocates to Los Angeles, the writing is already on the wall. In L.A., she sets foot in the Burlesque Lounge and falls in love with the nightclub and its glamorous disposition. She applies for a job as a dancer and is turned down by Tess, the proprietor of the establishment (Cher). But Ali demonstrates her spunk by picking up a tray and beginning to work the crowd as a waitress. At this stage, we're just counting down the clock until she finds her way to the mic. When she does, it's a pretty spectacular moment.

And are you at all surprised to learn that Tess the owner is hanging on to the Burlesque Lounge by her fingernails? Mortgages are a bloody beyotch.

The resident witchy diva (because there's always one in these suckers) is played by Kristen Bell, whom I loved as Veronica Mars. Bell's character, Nikki, is the only one who actually sings in the Burlesque Lounge; all the other performers lip synch to their music. Ali arrives at the really revolutionary notion of having the performers actually sing their songs, but she gets turned down flat by Tess. But then Tess hears Ali sing, and so cue the change of heart.

There's the expected romance between roommates Aguilera and Cam Gigandet's dreamboat bartender, and these two are sweet together and give the film a chance to occasionally flirt with romantic comedy. You never really get a feeling that that shady real estate developer had a real shot at Ali. The best pairing, though, is Cher and the excellent Stanley Tucci who plays the good-humored back stage director and Tess's right hand man. I wouldn't at all be surprised if these two were improvising in some of their scenes, their chemistry feels that real and organic. Alan Cumming lurks here somewhere, and director Steven Antin remarks that Cumming was intended to be the Mad Hatter in this bit of Wonderland. If Cumming was meant to play the swishy stage presence, well, Tucci stole that thunder. Cumming is wasted in what basically is an extended cameo.

The fishnets and feathers and boas are familiar props, but BURLESQUE evades the pitfalls that consumed rank stinkers like GLITTER and SHOWGIRLS. Partly, it's because Cher and Tucci's presence elevates the film. Aesthetically, the film doesn't come off feeling tawdry and cheap (elements which helped kill SHOWGIRLS). There is some risque material presented in the burlesque numbers, but these numbers are fun and tongue-in-cheek. There's a sensuous elegance about the whole thing. Musically, Aguilera and Cher deliver some really electrifying numbers. Cher's introduction comes by way of a fantastic number, ""Welcome to Burlesque,"" which establishes the Burlesque Lounge as a fun place to be in. Later on, she belts out a power ballad (which I didn't like that much), ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me."" She still has those distinctive pipes. And, when Aguilera shares a scene with a nurturing Cher, it does feel a bit like a passing of the torch.

Aguilera is in her prime, her flair and big vocals very much on exhibit. The only knock I have is that she maybe should've done this role around a decade ago. But it definitely lends that measure of verisimilitude when the lead actress in a musical does her own singing. If you're only used to Aguilera doing her pop/R&B thing, you're in for a treat because she sings the hell out of a bunch of old school tunes, inflecting contemporary pizazz in throwback sets such as Mae West's ""Guy What Takes His Time,"" and Etta James' ""Something's Got a Hold on Me"" and the game-changing ""Tough Lover."" My favorite of the lot, though, is probably her playful ""But I Am A Good Girl."" Particularly welcome is the cheeky, brassy Bob Fosse touch infusing these numbers. Even Kristen Bell sexies it up with a steamy rendition of ""Long John Blues."" And, yes, Bell lip-synchs to Megan Mullaly's singing. Still, she ends up delivering - with exquisite shrewness - the movie's best line: ""I will not be upstaged by some slut with mutant lungs!"" You can't tell me that's not an awesome bit of dialogue.

The DVD's bonus stuff: Audio Commentary by the writer/first time director Steven Antin; ""The Burlesque Jukebox"" - six full and uncut musical numbers from the film performed by the cast (including Alan Cumming's deleted cover of ""That's Life"" and his racy stage number ""Jungle Berlin""); an alternate opening which has Christina right off belting out ""Something's Got a Hold on Me,"" followed by the rest of that diner scene (00:06:33 minutes long); and a blooper reel (00:05:10).",1299888000,2,5082,4.7681818181818185

4039062,4,B002ZG9774,"On occasion you'll see a movie where you're not quite sure what to expect or perhaps think you'll see something only to be surprised. It may not be the best movie ever made, but it does offer a touch of entertainment, doesn't bore you to tears and even puts a smile on your face. BURLESQUE is one of those movies.

Now by the name implied there are probably some who think that the movie involves non-stop strippers in various states of undress. Those folks will be disappointed. But fans of both Cher and Christina Aguilera and their singing abilities will find that the movie delivers all that they could hope for and more.

Aguilera stars as Ali, a young girl from a small town with dreams of something more. She wants to sing and dance and so one day heads to Los Angeles. She arrives and searches for a job only to be turned down time after time. She sees the sign for a club called Burlesque and enters just to find out what's going on. Inside she sees a bevy of beauties dancing on stage in skimpy outfits lip synching some classic tunes. Desperate for a job, she's directed to the club's owner Tess (Cher) by bartender Jack (Can Gigandet).

Ali stumbles through her request, begging for the chance to be a dancer in the show, but Tess turns her down telling her to come back when they have auditions. Returning to the bar Ali sees an opportunity when a waitress offers terrible service. Putting her past skills to use, Ali takes on the role of waitress telling Jack if she doesn't do better than his current staff, she'll walk but if she does, she gets a job. Needless to say she gets the job.

Tess and show production co-coordinator/best friend Sean (Stanley Tucci) notice her working and let it pass. The shows star Nikki (Kristin Bell) notices her too and takes an instant disliking to Ali. Nikki is that typical bitchy star who thinks the world revolves around her and anyone who doesn't treat her as such deserves to be gone. But Ali hangs in there, waiting for her big chance.

Months go by during which time Ali has her apartment broken into. Jack offers her a place to stay until she gets on her feet, but it's a purely platonic relationship since Jack's engaged (his girlfriend is in New York doing a play at the moment though). When audition time arrives, Ali takes to the stage but doesn't give the performance Tess is looking for. When she asks Tess what she wants Tess tells her she doesn't even know herself but that she has to take command of the stage and make it her own. Emboldened by this nugget of information, Ali gives an audition that floors Tess and Sean and is added to the line up of dancer, a move that doesn't sit well with Nikki.

While this little drama is going on, Tess is fighting a losing battle to keep the club open. The club is and always has been her dream but her ex-husband and partner Vince (Peter Gallagher) sees it as nothing but a losing battle. Add to that a buzzard like businessman named Marcus (Eric Dane) who wants to buy the club to tear it down to build condos and you have problems. Ali suggests to Tess that they change it up and have the girls actually sing instead of lip synch but Tess won't listen.

Nikki, always the trouble maker, always late and almost always drunk, fails to show for her set one night. Instead, Tess puts Ali in her place. As the girls begin their set, Nikki cuts the music track playing and Tess begins to bring down the curtain. All stops as soon as Ali begins to sing on her own with a voice that demands attention. The curtain rises, the band comes in and Ali takes control of the stage to a standing ovation.

Now the centerpiece of the show, crowds begin to come into the club. A shrewd businessman, Marcus sets his eye on Ali, just as he did before on Nikki when she was the big draw. And as he begins to woo Ali, Jack sees a missed opportunity set in. The entire time he and Ali have lived together in his apartment the attraction was there, he just never acted on it.

So the stage is set. Will Tess lose the club? Will Ali be a big enough draw to save it? Will Nikki find a way to stop it all from happening? Will Jack and Ali get together or will Marcus take her away and make her the star she always dreamed of? All answers are found before the movie ends.

Some have said that this movie is nothing more than a retelling of COYOTE UGLY with different music. In some ways that's true but not entirely. The ingnue trying to make it in big city after leaving a small town behind is there. Dancing and singing is there. But this movie has a different vibe to it. It's also been compared to SHOWGIRLS with a different setting and less skin. Once more, with the exception of the small town/big city story it offers something more. And is much less tacky.

This is a feel good movie. You enjoy the musical numbers that are more along the lines of CHICAGO than they are the old Gene Kelly movies of the past. Aguilera does a pretty good job for this being her first major role in a big time film. If you just thought of her as another pretty face you'll be surprised. I've never been a big fan of her vocal styling but they fit the film perfectly. Cher is believable as the ex-dancer/singer with a dream of a place of her own. Bell does a great job as the catty star whose spotlight is taken away and Gigandet turns out to be not only a good actor but nice love interest for Aguilera to play off of.

The movie is cotton candy for the eyes and ears. It offers some good music and some dynamite dance sequences. It's entertaining without going too deep. In essence it's a movie that makes you feel good and have a good time, something that more movies should do. I don't think this film ever intended to be an Oscar winner, but fans of musicals and of the cast will get their money's worth with this one.",1299715200,32,5795,4.311294765840221

Don't know what film experience Mr. Antin has, but clearly his work with his wife's Pussycat Dolls was educational.  ""Burlesque"" surely does not have an original story, but it surely doesn't need one.  The script is fast-paced, witty, emotionally consistent, and simple - leaving the complexity to the stagings.

She has good comedic timing, is super hot and I dare say easily a better actress than Madonna. (I know that isn't saying much, but let's throw some perspective on this) This was her first try.

The youngster in this case is pop star Christina Aguilera in her feature film debut as Ali Rose, a plucky Iowa waitress described scabrously by an alcohol-fueled rival named Nikki as a ""slut with mutant lungs"". Your reaction to that comment will depend on how much you like Aguilera's throaty, blues-inspired holler of a singing voice. You would have to enjoy it a lot to sit through the several production numbers she performs in the movie.

The story is trite. Ali leaves Iowa for LA on a bus and faces exactly one day of unemployment during our current economic malaise when she discovers the Burlesque Lounge on the Sunset Strip. Talking her way into a waitress job thanks to sympathetic bartender Jack, she desperately tries to persuade the club's owner Tess that she belongs on the stage with all the leggy, lip-synching dancers. A dancer's unplanned pregnancy gives Ali the chance to audition and take her place, and then conveniently, Tess picks Ali to substitute for a drunken Nikki to take the lead one night. Out of spite, Nikki cuts off the recorded music at which point Ali sings in her own voice. In perhaps the most patronizing scene, the awestruck reactions of customers and colleagues insure her immediate stardom and Nikki's vengeful wrath. As Ali's star ascends, she is also caught in a romantic triangle between Jack and a wealthy opportunist named Marcus.

Meanwhile, Tess faces the prospect of losing her club despite the good fortune brought forth by Ali's emerging fame. If you can't figure out the rest of the by-the-numbers plot, clearly you don't get out much. Even though the film is a showcase for Aguilera, it is really Cher who anchors it with her dry insouciance and sheer professionalism. At 64, she looks great in a highly cosmeticized way, but it's really her natural likability and her two standout numbers that linger in the memory. The first is a teasing nod to ""Cabaret"" called ""Welcome to Burlesque"" and the second is a Diane Warren-penned power ballad, ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me"", which she sings with the same emotional fervor Jennifer Hudson did with her big&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dreamgirls/dp/B000O1799U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dreamgirls</a>&nbsp;number, ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"". Aguilera acquits herself well as Ali. It's just that the role is such a predictable set of clichs when she's offstage.

As Tess' loyal confidante, Stanley Tucci plays almost exactly the same role he played in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-Wears-Prada/dp/B000J103PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil Wears Prada</a>&nbsp;and in the same wry manner that works just as well here. Cam Gigandet as Jack and Eric Dane as Marcus aren't given much opportunity to make memorable impressions. Kristen Bell has a few choice moments showing her talons as Nikki. Shallow entertainment for those in the mood for it. Extras are plentiful but not indispensable on the 2011 DVD/Blu-Ray. There is a talky but none too insightful commentary track from Antin, an alternate opening sequence that extends the Iowa setting, a five-minute blooper reel, and footage of six uncut musical numbers. The Blue-Ray additionally offers a five-part making-of featurette for true fans of the film.",1299456000,3,4393,6.17483660130719
4039093,4,B002ZG9774,"Burlesque (2010) Starring Christina Aguilera, Cher, Stanley Tucci, Kristen Bell, Alan Cumming, Eric Dane, Cam Gigandent and Peter Gallagher.

A small town talent becomes unearthed after she visits a burlesque ran by Tess (Cher), a woman on her last ditch effort to save her club, her witty assistant (Stanley Tucci), and a jealous dancer who eyes the competition (Kristen Bell).

I was excited about the picture, and I wasn't a Cher fan until I saw this. How could I not be allured by a movie that offers everything a burlesque show does; amazing numbers, songs and dances, raunchy humor, and sexually humorous numbers. I'm not a pervert, I'm a gay man who does appreciate the beauty in women.

I have to give Burlesque some definite complements; it flows well, the music is great, all the characters were written well and likable, and the cast was superb. I believe that Cher should have won the Oscar for ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me"". But we all know they're rigged.

Christina Aguilera does not disappoint with her amazing vocal talents. And surprised me for her acting debut on the big screen. I can see her being an actress/singer now; she was believable, owned the lines, did not just remember them, she preformed.

All the numbers are as memorable as Chicago's with Renee and Catherine; though the story wasn't as strong. Some could complain the love interest in the movie was cheesy and predictable, but honestly, all rom-coms are and any romantic romance. Only TV has people seriously thinking ""will ____ and ____ get together?""

Overall; highly recommended. Go see it if you haven't and you might hate it if you have an unreasonable vendetta against Cher, Xtina, or burlesque.

Rated PG-13; Running time 119 minutes (1 Hr 59 mins)

My rating: 15+

There is lots of sexually provocative sex routines, risque humor, 1 clear f-word, 2 under-the-breathe, and some intense scenes. If your 12 year old wants to see it, I don't think it's a problem, I just feel like this has an adult theme to it, and really should be PG under my opinion, because I go by the Canadian ratings mostly.",1299456000,,2092,4.7569060773480665
4039094,1,B002ZG9774,"Although I've been a Cher fan since I was a little boy, I did not like this film.  I did not like the style of music in the film and see it more of a chick flick romance.  Men probably would like it for the women cavorting around in their underwear, but the slow pace of the film can hardly make it worth it.  I'd reccomend sampling the music before buying; if you like this sort of music, you'd probably like this film--the plot was predictable--I'd figured out the ending in the first 1/2 hour.  I'm more of a fan of old school Broadway musicals like South Pacific and Sound of Music, movies that you left the theater singing the songs.  To me the music in the movie was quite forgettable.  It had glitz, but none of the fun of Moulan Rouge, and it took me two days to actually get through the whole film.",1299456000,10,807,4.174193548387096

The Blu-Ray will not play on PS3 without a firmware update.  Required firmware update removes features from the PS3.  I hope this aids anyone deciding to make this purchase, although I am sure the future holds many more of these types of requirements for Blu-Rays on PS3.

Side Note: nobody in the household wanted to watch the movie in DVD instead even though the package includes a DVD.

<Update>
The minimum required PS3 system version is 3.51 to watch this Blu-Ray.  After careful consideration, I installed the latest PS3 system version 3.60 and was able to play the Blu-Ray.  The flack appears to be that 3.21 and newer takes away feature 'Install Other OS' which we determined we would not use.

4039127,5,B002ZG9774,"BURLESQUE, written and directed by Steve Antin, is a terrific cinematic definition of what the word 'burlesque' means: 'a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects. The word derives from the Italian burlesco, which itself derives from the Italian burla - a joke, ridicule or mockery.'  This is a riot of color and good fun and snazzy production numbers a la Bob Fosse takeoffs. The story is predictable and silly and the script borders on mediocre, but with the talent and pizzazz of the cast, none of that matters!

Ali (Christine Aguilera) flees Iowa in hopes of a career in show biz and happens into a Sunset Strip Burlesque House run by 'still not down' Tess (Cher) who knows her business is failing, despite the solid help from her gay assistant Sean (Stanley Tucci) and the warnings of her ex-husband/partner Vince (Peter Gallagher).  Tess has problems with some of her lip-synching cast, namely Nikki (Kristen Bell), and is being hounded to sell her club to the wealthy boyfriend of Nikki - Marcus (Eric Dane).  Ali observes, wants to be in the show, but is offered the job of waitress in the club by bartender/songwriter Jack (Cam Gigandet), a guy so kind that he shares his little flat with her.  Ali is persistent and when given a chance to audition she gets into the cast. Her trump card is that she is such a terrific singer that she converts the club away from lip-synching into a full-blown song and dance place.  Romance of course flutters in as do other little sidebars (including a strange quickie by doorman Alexis (Alan Cumming), but the main attractions are the glitzy stage numbers by a surprisingly fine Aguilera and by Cher herself.  It is all very corny and very wonderful entertainment.  Definitely worth an evening's pleasure.  Grady Harp, March 11",1299283200,19,1893,4.835913312693498
4039148,3,B002ZG9774,"I saw this movie in the theater with some girl friends and I was looking forward to seeing this movie because I loved Kristen Bell in Reefer Madness. I also think Christina Aguilera has an incredible voice.

Cons:

Kristen Bell is way under used in this movie. She can sing very well and they should have had her do at least a duet with Aguilera or Cher. I couldn't tell if she sang a song with her own voice or not. I know she was lip syncing to ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" but I thought there was one other song which she sang but it's not on the soundtrack.

Christina Aguilera isn't a very good actress. Nice try for a first major role but the director should have had her working with an acting coach.

Cher's face is so tight from the botox and plastic surgery, it affects the way she talks.

Story line is what you'd expect. Typical small town girl with big talents wins over everyone and saves the day.

Pros

The singing is fantastic. Christina is so emotional when she sings I was literally getting chills. Unfortunately, her acting isn't as emotional and it seems to stand out even more when you compare Christina the singer vs. Christina the actress.

The music and dance numbers are a lot of fun. I was blown away when they added the tag to ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"". I'm almost afraid of being disappointed if I watch it on my home t.v. It thrilled me to see/hear it on the big screen. I understand why they didn't put it on the soundtrack (they don't want to pay royalties on someone else's song) but I would love to have the audio for this cranked to 11.

Music, Music, Music. I really enjoyed the music. I don't buy soundtracks too often but I had to get it. I'm not even a huge fan of current pop music. I noticed right away that the end credits song (Beautiful People) was sampling Marilyn Manson's Beautiful People. Seriously, not usually my genre of music but I was impressed with Christina's voice post Disney.

All in all, Burlesque is fun and entertaining with a couple of cringe worthy acting from Christina at certain moments. I will never make my husband watch this but I may get a group of girls to come over and watch this.",1299196800,4,2170,4.362282878411911

4039150,3,B002ZG9774,"BURLESQUE had some fantastic choreography and music and what was there, should have been enough to make this a memorable movie for years to come. Yet, the choreography and movement and design of those numbers was ruined by an editor that tried to get too cutesty with his editing skills. Every 3 second and every drum beat, there's an edit, or a different angle, not just on one or two numbers, but every single musical number is edited like they came from the MTV school of editing. Not to mention, they would cut away from numbers to do montage moments of storyline which was really unnecessary.

BURLESQUE has its problems with story, like the fact that Ali (Christina Aguilera), goes from being an Iowa diner waitress to Los Angeles without needing a single moment of practice or trials in order to be as good as the girls who are already performing. We the audience are just supposed to believe that she is just one of those few people in the world who don't have to work at it, their just plain good. Sorry, even Christina Aguilera didn't become Christina Aguilera without some work and struggles.

The script is pretty vanilla as well, which makes it even worse that they took up moments of dance and music to break away from what was happening on stage to show us montages of pointless stuff, like Aguilera sleeping, or Cher talking about her mortgage paying woes. All of which was covered adequately enough with dozens of other scenes.

Bottom line though, people came into BURLESQUE wanting to see the singing and dancing, and what was there was exceptional if you don't get nautious with the rapidfire editing and the moments of conversation or montages that break up the performances.  The creators of BURLESQUE and the editor of BURLESQUE got overly creative and should have just let the music and dancing do the talking, instead of trying to spruce up already great numbers with spastic editing.",1299196800,3,1909,4.740963855421687

Christina's amazing voice and nice acting ability balance this movie perfectly. Cher & Stanley Tucci as the comedic duo are head on with their lines, comedic talent, and outstanding presence. It's a bit strange to see Cher acting in a movie when she is 64 and looks 31 in the film, but it is great to see her back in a film and on top of her game. Christina can act. I didn't dread any of the moments when she had screen time (I can't say that for everyone who is a singer turned actress). However, I just wish there was MORE dancing.

I always knew Christina Aguilera had a great voice, but being slightly older than her (lol) I never really bought any of her music.  After seeing this movie, I became a huge fan.  Her voice is without a doubt, one of the greatest of all time.  Maybe Celine Dion, or Streisand can compare, but certainly not Gaga, Beyonce, Perry or any of the current reigning queens of pop. Its amazing that huge voice of hers comes out of such a little person!  The costumes were awesome, the love story was adorable and I think Christina did just fine for her acting debut.  She certainly was not as bad as the critics made her out to be.  Kristin Bell was perfectly believable as the nasty Nicki and as for Cher, what can I say?  Cher is Cher - a one and only.  She looked GREAT and if I could get away with wearing the eye makeup she wore in that movie, I absolutely would!

The only thing that took away from the experience was CA's plastic surgery-for me, pretty distracting. Her voice is a bit over the top for me, but she uses it to her advantage and it works in the film well.

However, it is was so comforting while i uncomfortably sat through the old fashioned seats at an outdated theatre. Here's my point, I was not expecting an oscar performance as Christina Aguilera is a new comer to the big screen. I was looking to just relax and see a good film, Hark! Here it is. I ordered my nachos, had a seat and the performances from all the characters were predictable but there is something very interesting about the storyline. This movie may be predictable to many fans but it was so fun to watch. All I can tell you is that don't look for oscar winners in this film however, open your mind to serious vocals from Christina and Cher. That's what makes Burlesque so fun to watch. I loved the performances and vocal power. To make a long story short, it's worth a look if you love singing in a movie but not quite a musical. There is a beautiful balance in this movie.

Look, this was not a movie that was going to rival ""Black Swan"" or ""Rabbit Hole"" for the Oscar even had it been done better, but that said....It could have been a movie that fit it's slot of ""Just entertainment"" far better.
I find no fault in any of the acting and the music was fine but it was the simple script that seems like it may have been written while shooting that failed. I found myself saying ""REALLY""???? REALLY???? several times as the movie went along and the reality set in that this was not going to be a great movie.

I don't care if it's a retread of a plot; if it's well done, it's worth seeing.  The musical numbers are dazzling and both Cher and Christina Aguilera do a fantastic job!  Christina really surprised me in that she was able to carry a movie pretty much by herself, but you can't knock Cher. (better not)  I don't understand why there were so many negative reviews about this film.  It's better seen on a large screen, so as to fully take in the production numbers, but I can't wait for the DVD.  It was much better than ""Nine"" and ""Chicago"".

I knew very little about Christina Aguilera, but I'm a fan now.  She really has talent, and gets to showcase it here.  To me, this movie is a cross between ""Cabaret"" and ""Chicago"" without the Nazis or gunfire.  It's a joyous, sexy, fun romp with great dancing and singing.  Cher is perfectly cast as the maturing diva who keeps the girls in line, but also mothers them.  She shows why she's a star in her two diva numbers.  Stanley Tucci is at his best here, playing a gay foil to Cher's lead.  I'm so irritated that the jaded critics, who only seem to enjoy blood and violence, couldn't appreciate this.  So many of my friends didn't want to see it until we told them how great it is --- and all because the critics don't seem to like anything that has joy in it.  See it, it's a romantic evening, and you'll leave the theater wanting to go back and watch it all over again.  There's a well-deserved note of thanks in the credits to Swarovsky crystals -- and one of Christina's costumes consists entirely of strings of pearls.  Gorgeous!",1298678400,3,1186,4.316742081447964

Can't understand why more wasn't made of this delightful movie at the Oscars. Just loved every minute of it. Pure entertainment. Can hardly wait to own it.",1298678400,3,436,4.75

4039223,4,B002ZG9774,"BURLESQUE is a mixed bag.

 The musical numbers, which look like they could have been staged by the late Bob Fosse, are plentiful and fabulous, filled with a spectacular, sexy razzle-dazzle.  When they are on stage, strutting and singing their stuff, neither Christina Aguilera nor Cher disappoint.  They are terrific.

 The problems with the film, written and directed by Steven Antin, occur when the actors are not singing or dancing.

 The screenplay is rather trite and the performances, with the exceptions of Stanley Tucci, as the nightclub's gay, sharp-witted stage manager, and Kristen Bell, as the club's hard-drinking lead dancer, are dull.  Despite the fact that she screwed up the ""Star Spangled Banner,"" Ms. Aguilera should keep her night job.

 For the record, the story deals with an Ohio girl (Aguilera) who travels to Hollywood to make good as an entertainer.  She maneuvers herself into a waitress job at a hot nightclub, Burlesque, owned by Cher and her ex-husband (Peter Gallagher), which is a stone's throw from being foreclosed upon by the bank.  Soon, Christina has not only become the star of the floor show, but she is also being romanced by a ruthless businessman (Eric Dane), who wants to buy Burlesque, so that he can tear it down and build a high rise condo on the land, as well as her ""best friend,"" a young bartender/wannabe songwriter (Cam Gigandet).

 Guess which one she winds up with while devising a plan to save the club?

 Alan Cumming is also, very briefly, in the movie, but his one big number was cut from the theatrical release.  However, it is viewable in the deleted scenes section of the DVD.  Other extras include audio commentary by Antin, an alternate opening and a blooper reel.

4039224,3,B002ZG9774,"This film is mildly entertaining. Nothing special at all. I find Christina Aguilera could do so much better. Sadly, she lacks the pizzaz for that magic cabaret-style entertainer's character. Learn from Liza Minelli(Cabaret), Catherine-Zeta Jones(Chicago) and even the ice queen herself that is Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge! You got to really give your heart and soul and guts to be a stage entertainer Christina darling. Very shallow character.

Cher is just there for the condiments. Stanley Tucci never changes his modus operandi since he is the same tired old gay man in practically every films that requires him to be a gay man. The songs are mediocre. it's entertaining but you feel cheated because you have seen many of the cliches happened in this film. It's not bad but it's not that great either. It would be better if these characters are given more depth and the songs are chosen very carefully. I am a big fan of Cher and Miss Aguilera, but this flick undermined
their talents. It could be better in my humble opinion.

Rent first, that is my advice. If you like it, good for you. If you feel otherwise, well it doesn't hurt either. At least you know what's Burlesque is all about.",1298592000,5,1194,4.735576923076923
4039225,3,B002ZG9774,"This multi-million dollar extravaganza is primarily a vehicle for former Mouseketeer Christina Aguilera which some support from Cher - and a GREAT turn by actor Stanley Tucci. Its aimed at the ""under 30 set"" to whom ""Burlesque"" represents, not the old American theatrical art form that combined striptease with bawdy comedy routines. This is ""burlesque"" for the new (well, its not so new) millennium.
Written and directed by Steven Antin (not a veteran of movie musicals), the film can't decide if it wants to tell a real story or show highly-edited fast moving song and dance numbers, nearly all with Ms. A. Obviously Antin has seen Chicago as he films some of the staged numbers in a style similar to Director Rob Marshall. The plot - as scripted by Antin - is not much different from the disaster that was called ""Showgirls"". Showgirls had lots of nudity. Basically none here. The ""partial nudity"" mentioned in the MPAA rating at the beginning is a shot of bare MALE buttocks.

I mention Cabaret above for two reasons: Alan Cumming appeared in Cabaret as well as in this film and he has one number ""Jungle Berlin"" which is in the style of the musical numbers in Cabaret. It's a great number - though highly edited in the film - and one of the few scenes Cumming gets to appear in here. Like most of the production numbers, this one is chopped up with the Director cutting away to other scenes. The only song I remember seeing performed straight through is Cher's solo on ""The Last of Me"", a number which is for Cher what ""My Way"" was for Sinatra. Luckily the ""Jungle Berlin"" number - though less than two minutes long - is presented complete as one of the six ""entire song performances"" in the bonus features. The other five are a mixed bag. First is a ""dancers only"" version of a one number with a repeating vocal-backed soundtrack that really gets boring after 30 seconds. Then there is a version of Sinatra's hit ""That's Life"" performed by Cumming, in full Gene Kelly mode, that was deleted from the film. The others include - thankfully - the unedited version of the erotic ""Dr. Longjohn"". The other bonuses include a Director's commentary track, a five-minute ""blooper reel"", and a six-minute ""alternate opening"" which basically rearranges the opening song.

As I noted earlier - this is the modern version of burlesque, which means sexy dancing by gorgeous women - who never take their costumes off on stage. Well, there is one ""fan dance"" by Aguilera  - exactly one hour into the film -but that's it. This is not a strip show.

As a film directed to Ms. A fans - and Cher fans curious to see her again and sing that one big solo number - the film succeeds as a group of music videos. The script is banal but - thankfully - there is more singing than dialogue. Its entertaining to watch once. But you won't learn anything about ""burlesque"" by watching it.

Have a look at the trailer; the number ""I am a good girl"" is everywhere.  Great to see Cher still going strong and a good number from her that won a Globe!  Chicago got raves with three song and dance amateurs (?) out front, and here's a Diva who, like Cher, will be around for decades, in her big screen debut.

STARRING: Christina Aguilera, Cher, Cam Gigandet, Stanley Tucci, Kristen Bell, Eric Dane, Peter Gallagher, Alan Cumming, Julianne Hough and Dianna Agron

WRITTEN BY: Steve Antin

DIRECTED BY: Steve Antin

Rated: PG - 13
Genre: Drama / Musical
Release Date: 24 November 2010
Review Date: 18 December 2010

While Cher has been dabbling in music and movies for several years, this is musical sensation Christina Aguilera's first time on the big screen, and what a job she did. Her face is definitely a familiar one to all of us and maybe that's what makes it feel like she's been acting for so long. She's a natural.

Much like musicians Eminem and 50 Cent did, Aguilera chooses to play a character close to home for her big screen debut; you guessed it - an aspiring singer / dancer.

She's small-town girl Ali, and ups and leaves with her life savings to head to Los Angles to make it big. When she arrives, she's a little overwhelmed by the big city rush, but soon enough finds herself in a dark and tiny club called Burlesque. She enters just in time to see Cher's character Tess, performing on stage. Naturally, she's captivated, and so are we: Cher's still got it, folks.

Tess owns the club, and is on the verge of losing it to a rich L.A. playboy, Marcus (Eric Dane). Dane plays Marcus as nice a villain as he can be, and villain or not - I was forced into liking the character. Dane is a blast, and I look forward to seeing him in more things.

Tess's ex-husband and co-owner Vince (Peter Gallagher) is on Marcus's side, and wants her to sell. Tess has too many memories, and buried dreams rooted in her little club though, and to sell it would be to sell her soul. But when money isn't exactly flowing in, whatever is she to do?

Luckily, Ali is smitten with Burlesque, and is determined to get a job there. After she is told to come back and audition by Tess and her assistant, Sean (Stanley Tucci); there's a nice little moment where Ali decides to first pick up a tray and start waitressing right there on the spot. This catches Tess's attention and more importantly this early on in the story, the attention of the bar tender, Jack (Cam Gigandent).

After an unfortunate incident, Ali finds herself homeless with nowhere to go. So she shacks up with Jack, who is a safe fix because she works with him, and he has a fianc. I enjoyed these scenes a lot, as Cam and Christina had amazing chemistry, and it was a lot of fun to see their feelings for one another boiling, with the conflict of Jack's fianc, keeping them from acting on them.

And of course, we have the witch-character that is the club's best entertainer under Tess, until Ali comes along. Kristen Bell, plays the snarky alcoholic Nikki, to a T; which is due much praise, as we all know what a sweetheart she can be.

I've given you a lot with the characters alone, and hopefully that's enough. You can see how they will interact with one another and move the story forward. The plot and story arks we've seen a million times before, but the actors all do their jobs effortlessly, and we get some breaks from the melodrama by big musical scores that were put together quite nicely.

In addition to her great acting performance, Christina Aguilera delivers some jaw dropping dance moves and her voice sounds only better in digital surround sound.

Burlesque probably should have been an R-rated film, with more adult driven dialogue and some nudity; something one would expect to find in a club called `Burlesque'. But it does about as good as can be expected with a PG - 13.",1297382400,3,3557,4.527301092043682

The costumes were terrific, the songs were great (I bought the soundtrack)as well as the cast.  Who can not like Stanley Tucci too! He always seems to be a fan favorite.  I really learned to appreciate Christina Aguilara's talent.  The little girl with the big voice. That girl can really sing.  And then there's Cher.  She really doesn't age, and still has that unique, great voice. Like someone else said, ""if you're sick of shoot em up, blow em up movies"" go and enjoy yourself with this movie.  I liked seeing Julianne Hough in her movie debut too.  She did a nice job, and I know we'll see more of her.  In fact I think she's starring in the remake of Footloose.

He thought it was pretty great- this from a man who hates musicals like Chicago! I did enjoy the flash and outside of what has been said, the acting was pretty damn good. The musical numbers are songs I recognize and I enjoy what they did with them.

I was bothered by all the bad reviews on this film. I didn't think it deserved it at all and this is one of the few movies I'll be buying this year. First film I enjoyed since Inception.",1297036800,3,687,4.204545454545454
4039294,5,B002ZG9774,"The movie is pure escapism. Cher is unworldly in her potrayal of Tess the Burlesque Queen. There is noone as unusal and iconic. She captivates the screen ,and is up to her game with her tongue in cheek performance. Christina isn't up to great acting,but the musical numbers are so beautiful and excitable thatt this isn't that important. The show songs that she does are her strongest.her song  Bound to you is a memorable screen performance, beautiful pathos reigns.
Cher is great on her two songs,proving some singers really sing better as mature performers. The storyline is so corny and sweet that one has to believe in ones' child emotions to enjoy the diversity and talents of the cast. Stanley Tucci is wonderful,and his scenes with Cher are loving and the chemistry is there.

The costumes,the dancing, the songs,all flowed together to make it a hit. I was so happy to see that Cher's song  got the number one award for best song,at The Golden Globe Awards. Those who have followed her life and career really felt the meaning behind that song. No one else could have played that part as well. Everyone in it made it superb. Perhaps the critics need to remember that not all of us want to watch deep dramas that usually end badly. Life is hard enough right now. Sometimes we want to just be entertained,and leave the theater with a smile. This movie did that, and more. I cannot wait to get my copy.

yes its not the most original story, but how many recent movies have really original stories ?! ..every movie is partly inspired by some old hit or even some foregin film.

Christina did great in her movie debut. She's not the strongest actress but her performance was a great start and, boy, can that girl sing! Cher was simply a goddess and a half in her part as Tess and let it be known that her performance of ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me"" was roof-raising. The woman is 64. Her voice is INCREDIBLE. Age doesn't slow that woman down. Cher and Stanley Tucci had the absolute best lines that were laugh-out-loud hilarious. If you haven't seen this movie, you are missing out. Buy it. Rent it.

it gets a second chance on DVD. And I even hope, beyond hopes, that the complete version will end up one
day playing back at theatres. ""Christina"" is fantastic...she is a star! She can act, sing, and dance and
""CHER"" is the ""DIVA"" with two powerful numbers. I only wish she was given more to do. But they work well
together. I don't know the cost of the film but it all dazzles on the screen. Yes, there are hints of
""Fosse"" and ""Cabaret"" but it is a film for today's generation.

It's upseting when a great film, especially a musical, doesn't get the attention it deserves. I only wish
""ALAN CUMMINGS'"" number, ""That's Life"" would have been put back into the film. Luckily, it is the one
deleted number. But it should have never been deleted for it works with the rest of the film.

Yes, I'm a Christina Aguilera fan and have been for a decade now, but I've always been particularly excited to see her in her acting debut, as I've always known she'd be amazing. When the movie opens up to Christina, or Ali, at her job in Iowa, and she immediately starts out belting the Etta James classic, 'Somethings Gotta Hold On Me' after the diner she's managing closes for the evening, I got the feeling right away that this would be a feel good movie. Having been a long-time Aguilera fan, seeing her in concert four times since 1999, it takes a lot from her to keep impressing me more and more. Within the first 10 minutes of Burlesque, I was highly impressed with Aguilera's acting chops. Far far better than anything her peers or even her elders could ever pull off, especially in their acting debuts. Christina's career now seems to be just starting off, having been reinvigorated by this movie and the promotional performances surrounding it. Cher - the legendary, one and only Cher - amazing. I have to admit I was not too familiar with some of her work from early on in her career, but in this movie I was most impressed by the fact that this woman A) doesn't age, B) still has the talent she did when she started out, but it's gotten better, and c)the voice - she is a powerhouse and always has been!

If you're not a fan of Cher or Ag, you may not like this movie since it's centered around them. But, if anything, see it for that hot shot of Cam Gigandet's fine ass!",1295308800,8,1504,4.371428571428571

First off, nowhere near as bad as we expected. No, Christina is not horrid as an actress but definitely should look into some serious classes. She is NOT terrific as some reviewers claim. Cher- she played herself and that is not a bad thing. Tess: Strong, a veteran entertainer of the stage, demanding, sexy, able to dust herself off after nearly losing her livelihood and admired by younger performers. Need I say more? The music is better than expected but not radio friendly. Cliches' abound nearly every few minutes. But you know what? Despite the critique here- both of us walked away entertained. Cher is so darn likable, Stanley Tucci is sexy, Julianne Hough is great in her acting debut, Eric Danes- well, let's just say we did not like the ending where he is concerned. Not one bit.

So bad it's moderately entertaining, Burlesque is a lesson in how not to put on a musical. For a film with so much camp promise and the world crying out for a successor to the so-bad-it's-good cult Showgirls, this clich packed film is disappointingly mediocre. Collapses under a heap of boring love triangles, tame backstage rivalries, ear-splitting musical numbers and hyperactively edited routines. We've seen these kinds of clubs before, usually with guys dressed up as Madonna, Barbara, Cher -- wait, there's the guy doing Cher now. In a sailor hat and tights.

I loved Burlesque the first time and loved it the second time and am waiting for the DVD to be released.  It is totally entertaining and at times I almost applauded after some of the dance numbers.  Cher does a stand up job in her role but if you don't like Cher go see this movie for Christina Aguilara....she blew me away with her talent. It is a feel good movie that will leave you wanting the soundtrack.,1294358400,38,498,4.276595744680851
4039341,3,B002ZG9774,"The film succeeds with its primary selling point: the songs and dances are SPECTACULAR. I now know what it's like for women to have multiple orgasms after watching some of these sequences. Christina and co. shake it to titillating, breathless choreography. The camera knows where and when to cut, infusing every number with even more excitement but not obscuring the action. My personal favorite is when Christina's outfit is gradually flung away, leaving only a few giant feathers covering her naughty bits. Both sexy and funny.

You don't need me to tell you how incredible the songs are. I prefer Christina's voice to Cher's (as well, You Haven't Seen The Last Of Me seemed superfluous and too on-the-nose) but I think fans of both will be more than satisfied with the soundtrack.

The big question everyone wants answered is ""Can Christina act""?

My answer? YES! I say this not as an adoring fan (although I am, of course) but as someone with a degree in film. She has an easy, unforced charm that sparkles on the silver screen. No, scratch that: she's practically glowing! I am so pleased to announce that Christina actually gives one of the movie's best performances. I completely bought her character and even when the writing became weak at times, she was always at the top of her game. You can tell Christina was enthusiastic about the role and she fortunately didn't overplay it at all. I think there's a film career ahead of her if she wants it.

Stanley Tucci clearly has the best supporting part and is totally hilarious. Only problem is, he needed to be in more of the movie. As did Kristen Bell and especially Alan Cumming. Their characters were way more interesting than those of the two male leads. I hope their scenes didn't end up on the cutting room floor.

Besides some cheesy lines scattered throughout, my only big criticisms are with:

1. The bank subplot which I didn't care about (although it has a clever resolution).

2. Cam Gigandet's character and less-than-stellar performance.

Cam doesn't ruin the movie but his role wasn't compellingly written and Christina had him licked in the acting department. She could have chemistry with a lamp but he seems to be a bit distant in the role which doesn't allow the sparks to fly as much as they should.

Is Burlesque filled with clichs? Well, duh! It's supposed to be a lighthearted musical in which the plot takes a back seat to the theatrics. Y'know, older films in the genre were actually like that. Sure, I prefer Moulin Rouge! but then again, that movie doesn't have any numbers by Christina.",1294272000,5,2571,4.759550561797753

Christina Aquilera is both down-to-earth and sexy as the country girl who wants to make it in the big city, Cher lords it over everyone as the tough-but-lovable boss of the burlesque house, and Stanley Tucci is once again everyone's gay best friend. Making all of the preceding palatable to the guys in the audience is the general air of sexiness pervading the proceedings, in large part generated by the wonderfully skimpy costumes worn by Ms. Aquilera and the variety of women performing on stage with her. The songs are very good, too.

Trust me, guys, if you owe your wife a movie pick after dragging her to numerous sci-fi action thrillers, you can do worse than heading out to this one.  Kudos to writer/director Steve Antin for delivering a fun night at the movies.",1292198400,55,999,4.632768361581921

This is a vehicle that showcases the amazing talents of Christina Aguilera, and shows us Cher at 64 has still got what made her famous too! Cher and Christina have BOTH been nominated for ""Best Song"" Golden Globe awards from Burlesque, and both deserve it. In addition, if there is any Oscar Buzz it should go to the stage designers, lighting engineers and cinematographers that made every frame of this incredible film a work of art. They have set a landmark for stage lighting. Not that it needs it, but this film could have been pretty amazing in 3-D too.

4039380,3,B002ZG9774,"Once upon a time there was a little girl with a big voice. This little girl named Christina was a lucky girl indeed as she belonged to a very special club. This club helped to show off her beautiful voice and become a star. And as this girl became a young woman she found riches and fame much like the princesses of yesterday. But this girl was not happy with her place in the world. She shed all attributes that made her a star and ventured out to find happiness in being unique and different. This transformation confused her fans and eventually this young girl had no career at all. And though her other club mates found even greater fortune and fame, this girl was lost and having turn her nose up to all those that helped her career along the way - had no one left to help her back to her righteous place in the world.

So, this girl was in need of extra help. But she had already used a genie in a bottle to help her before, and only one hope remained - this girl would pray to her Fairy God Mother. So, this girl, Christina Aguilera, grasped her microphone in hand and gazed deeply into the spot lot and sang her deepest note to bring forth the Fairy God Mother of all pop stars - Cher.

With the release of the film Burlesque, many wonder if the pairing of Cher with Christina Aguilera can give Christina's career a lift. Burlesque is best described as a full feature music video. It is a campy, corny, and a contagiously fun film. Cher fans will be treated as she performs two songs and Stanley Tucci is good compliment to Cher's character as the Burlesque owner.  Julianne Hough (from Dancing with the Stars fame) and Kristen Bell make interesting foes to Aguilera's eagerness to rise to the top of the show. And Cam Gigandet's good looks and charming personality are well fit as Christina's love interest.

All in all, if you like musicals (fans of Chicago will especially like this film) and want a few minutes to escape, Burlesque will not displease you. All others...skip this film you might want to make another choice from the movie theater marquee.

4039381,3,B002ZG9774,"`Burlesque,' the gazillion-and-sixth movie memoir of a small-town girl making it big, was expectedly lampooned by most critics upon arrival. Although several of the complaints are perfectly valid, `Burlesque' is no `Glitter.' It is in many ways a very on-the-surface visual spectacle, however, and must be treated as such throughout most of its runtime in order for enjoyment as a viewer to be possible.

It is somewhat shocking that this is the movie Cher returned to the big screen for after seven years, and that this is what serves as Christina Aguilera's film debut. The story is more or less total trite, fitting snugly into the mold of the long, haggard slew of identical concepts that came before it. Christina plays Ali, a waitress from Middle-`o-Nowhere USA with her sights set on the spotlight. Somehow scrounging together the cash for a one-way ticket to LA, she happens to come across the vivacious Burlesque Lounge, and naturally lands herself a job there along with a den mother (owner of the club, Tess, played by Cher) to guide the way.

There's of course also a love interest (bartender Jack, played by Cam Gigandet), who conveniently offers Ali a place to stay after her apartment is robbed, despite the existence of an out-of-town fiance. The premise doesn't go too far beyond that; there are the usual ethical dilemmas and opportunities to sell the soul in favor of showbiz, presented in the form of Eric Dane as weaselly businessman Marcus. Kristen Bell is mostly wasted as a one-note bitchy alcoholic rival to Ali, but Stanley Tucci musters up a few vaguely witty one-liners as Tess's stage manager and gay best friend Sean.

Although the movie is heavy on the obvious, it does have some notable charms; Cher brings impressive layers of tenderness and vulnerability to her portrayal of Tess, while Xtina gives the impression she'd certainly be capable of meatier roles in the future. Cam Gigandet hasn't had much screen time in previous roles, but here we see a little more of what he can do; although he isn't given much to work with beyond the usual pretty boy waif routine, he shares a genuinely sexy, intimate scene with Christina's Ali involving some playful drunken banter and a strategically placed box of cookies.

The mega-instrument that is Christina Aguilera's voice is another major factor of the film's appeal; she's a phenomenal performer, and although a few of the numbers verge on typical musical schlock, a good handful of them (including ""The Beautiful People,"" a biting, hard-edged pop number sampling Marilyn Manson's hit of the same name, as well as ""Bound To You,"" a smoky ballad) are delectable ear candy. Cher's vocals are also in top form in her soaring opening number ""Welcome To Burlesque,"" and although she unfortunately only gets one other song, she shows she's still got it and then some.

Ultimately `Burlesque's biggest asset lies in its weighty guilty pleasure factor. Avid fans of Cher and Christina will probably eat it up, and there's plenty of beautiful faces, bodies, vocals and dance routines to keep things visually enticing. Likeable characters can also make or break a movie despite its script, and luckily Cher's Tess, Tucci's Sean, and a few others are charming enough to keep the audience rooting for them. If you're in the mood for a sugary confection, `Burlesque' could definitely be the way to go-just don't expect anything more filling than that.",1291161600,41,3418,4.968531468531468
4039382,5,B002ZG9774,"When I originally heard of the concept for Steven Antin's Burlesque, a movie musical starring pop phenom Christina Aguilera and the legendary Cher, I was, if you could believe it, less than enthusiastic. I was under the assumption that this film would be not just bad, but god awful. Recalling horrid pop star film debuts (ex. Mariah Carey in the depressingly hollow Glitter, Britney Spears in the mind-numbing Crossroads) I thought I was in for a cinematic train wreck of epic proportions. And I'm happy to tell you today, that I couldn't have been more wrong.

First of all, what makes Burlesque unlike Glitter and Crossroads is its aesthetics. Christina Aguilera's strong voice is enough to carry a film, as it turns out. However, Burlesque has more to fall back on. Cher plays Tess, Aguilera's character's boss and mentor. She can make any film excellent. Secondly, this film is a musical, also unlike Glitter and Crossroads. It shoots for being something of a hybrid between Cabaret and Chicago, and doesn't completely fail. Thirdly, this film has an outstanding supporting cast, including the always great Stanley Tucci, Grey's Anatomy vet Eric Dane, Kristen Bell, Cam Gigandet, and Alan Cumming, and these folks bring enough liveliness to save even the worst film, but here, they only add to the fun and excitement.

The story is really nothing new. Small-town girl Ali (Aguilera) leaves her job as an Iowan waitress, and heads for the big lights of Los Angeles. She stumbles upon a burlesque club run by Tess (Cher), starts working her way up, and eventually becomes the main attraction, with her intense vocal range and elaborate interpretations of dance numbers, which turns out to be a godsend for Tess, who is about to lose her club. She starts living with the charismatic and sexy bartender Jack (Cam Gigandet), after her apartment gets robbed. Romance ensues, and things go from there.

Cliche, right? It's been done before, right? Right. There isn't a section of this film that isn't even a little bit corny. But, that's not to say it's not a load of fun. I'm sorry, Harry Potter, Burlesque is the film event of the Thanksgiving holiday. Christina Aguilera isn't a fantastic actress, but she's better than you would expect her to be, and her song-and-dance numbers, obviously, are fantastic, as one would expect.

She and Cher have fantastic chemistry, as well as Cher and Stanley Tucci. All of these actors blend together so well, that they seem to compliment each other, enhancing each performance. And, I was rather disappointed to see that Cher only sang two out of the film's ten musical numbers, but it's safe to say that that's not enough, considering that she can still belt the hell out of these songs. However, Cher's obvious plastic surgeries don't help her performance, considering that her face barely moves throughout the entire picture, but she's still able to pull this role off, somehow.

Steven Antin is a director whom I've never heard of, however, I was fairly impressed. The film is directed with impeccable taste, and the writing is very quick and clever, and humorous, even when a little corny.

However, what really saves Burlesque in the end is its elaborate song-and-dance numbers. Soon after the movie begins, you know what kind of film you're in for. Even as cliche after cliche presents themselves, Burlesque has enough razzle-dazzle magic to outweigh its faults, and to leave you dancing in the aisles as you leave this film.",1291075200,11,3470,4.933219178082192
4039383,5,B002ZG9774,"In Burlesque, the actress Kristen Bell, who I remember from TV's Veronica Mars, does the sort of total reinvention, bordering on scarification, that won Charlize Theron an Oscar when she tried it in Monster.  After the movie we were all sitting there, saying, ""That was Kristen Bell?""  The film has her playing Nikki, a dancer with enormous talent and charisma who's hobbled by two nasty problems--megalomania and alcoholism.  Something's a little wonky with the script, which seems to be playing on two time scales at once....  One in which Nikki is roughly the contemporary of Christina Aguilera's character, maybe a bit older (in fact Bell is five months older than Aguilera), and the other in which Nikki was around when together, she and Cher started the burlesque dance palace around which the movie, and their lives, revolve.  I'm sure I wasn't the only one who was scratching his head when the big parking lot scene took place and Nikki started giving Cher (I mean ""Tess"") a guilt trip for preferring the new girl Ali!  That's the part where Cher says, what about all the years I held your hair up out of the toilet bowl while you were vomiting everything but your memories?

It almost seems that their memories changed and transformed as the decades passed.  Both Nikki and Tess look pretty ageless, but Nikki actually seems younger than Tess because at least she can still move her body.  Cher parades through the movie as though she had no feet and is being wheeled about on casters by invisible unions whose members are all fieldmice,  On the minus side, there is perhaps one spectacular musical number too many, but outside of that, Burlesque is perfect.",1290988800,4,1667,4.817543859649123
4039384,3,B002ZG9774,"""Burlesque"" is a visually splendid musical brought down by a severe lack of originality. There isn't a plot point, a character, a theme, a dance routine, or even a song style that hasn't already been seen and heard in other musicals. Take, for example, the moment Christina Aguilera enters the titular club; on stage, a troupe of scantily-clad young women dance lewdly around Cher as she welcomes the audience with a song. She sings about the club. She sings about the girls. She points to the orchestra, which play right on the stage. Watching this, I thought of how good this scene could have been if it hadn't already been done in ""Cabaret."" It also seems as if the music and lyrics are a little too reminiscent of Kander and Ebb. Even the choreography feels like Joey Pizzi and Denise Faye peeked into the teacher's edition of a Bob Fosse dancing textbook.

Aguilera plays Ali, a waitress from a middle-of-nowhere town who dreams of hitting it big as a singer and dancer. Determined to make something of herself, she buys a one-way bus ticket to Los Angeles. While job hunting in Hollywood, she happens upon The Burlesque Lounge, a glamorously lascivious nightclub run by the headliner, Tess (Cher). Although tough, Tess takes Ali under her wing; at the same time, Ali makes an enemy out of a temperamental and boozy performer named Nikki (Kristen Bell). Ali quickly lands a job as a cocktail waitress, and after a lot of coaxing and begging (aided by the convenient sudden pregnancy of one of the showgirls), she gets to take part in the show, which, at Tess' insistence, consists of dancers lip synching to previously recorded songs. But when Nikki stops the music in a fit of jealousy, Ali lets loose a set of pipes the likes of which no one at The Burlesque Lounge - Tess least of all - has ever heard.

Intertwined with this is a subplot involving the failing financial state of the club, pitting Tess against her ex-husband, Vince (Peter Gallagher), whose sweaty skin, matted hair, and ruffled clothes give him the appearance of a man who hasn't slept in at least three days. We also focus on a budding romance between Ali and a Burlesque bartender named Jack (Cam Gigandet), the latter offering his apartment as a safe haven after Ali's place is robbed. They spend most of the first and second act playing coy with one another, until that fateful moment when Jack walks past Ali wearing nothing - although he does strategically cover himself with an open box of cookies. Their love is quickly threatened by the arrival of Marcus Gerber (Eric Dane), a suave, magnetic entrepreneur eager to tempt Ali with promises of becoming a star. He also has his eye on The Burlesque Lounge, primarily because that's what's expected of guys like him in movie musicals like this.

All the songs come to life within the context of the stage, each displaying a dreamy showbiz glitziness similar to the fantasy sequences in Rob Marshall's ""Chicago."" It's great to look at, and yet it forces a certain degree of detachment, since, even within the scope of Hollywood outrageousness, it seems unlikely that such a club could ever exist there. Apart from that, no real effort is made to show us something we haven't already seen before. Even Cher's solo number is overwhelmingly contrived. Imagine it. It's after hours. Everyone has gone home. She steps on stage and insists on rehearsing. She then sits on a lone chair, bathed in the glow of a spotlight while a power ballad crescendos to life. And yes, the prerecorded song on the CD just happens to accurately reflect her emotional state at that very moment. The song is called ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me,"" and it was written by Diane Warren, known for ballads such as ""Un-Break My Heart,"" ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing,"" and ""There You'll Be.""

I will give both the leads credit. I don't need to say a lot about Cher; she has already established herself as an actress, and she has the Oscar to prove it. As for Aguilera, she marks her feature film debut with a decent, believable, entertaining performance - decent enough, in my opinion, to warrant opportunities for future film roles. And there's no denying her soulful, resonant singing voice, one of the few decent ones belonging to an ex-Mouseketeer. Unfortunately, all the singing in the world can't save a musical if there isn't an engaging story, well developed characters, and some sense that the filmmakers are trying something new. ""Burlesque,"" while certainly pleasant on the eyes, is flat, uninspired, and lifeless.",1290902400,4,4526,4.761783439490446
4039385,2,B002ZG9774,"If you are a Christina Aguilera fan and want to see her sing then this is a good movie for you. If you want to see something related to modern burlesque then you need to go to a live burlesque show because there is no burlesque in this movie. I'm guessing since the names ""Cabaret"" and ""Showgirls"" had been used, Steve Antin chose ""Burlesque"". It isn't a horrible movie but you have seen the plot many times before. Xtina's acting is passable and it's fun to see Cher even briefly. The dancing is knock off Bob Fosse but Aquilera's voice is in top form and there is a lot of it. It is a nearly two hour long music video. It is a better movie than other pop princess movies like ""Glitter"" or ""Crossroads"" but not nearly as good as other modern musicals like ""Chicago"", ""Dream Girls"" or the above mentioned ""Cabaret"". If you are interested in real modern burlesque, do a search for Dita Von Teese, Immodesty Blaize, Jo Weldon, Miss Indigo Blue or the Pontani Sisters. As the review in the Christian Science Monitor put it, This movie is about as much about burlesque as ""Dancing with the Stars"" is about Swan Lake.",1290902400,15,1112,4.429268292682927
4039386,5,B002ZG9774,This movie was everything I expected it to be and more... there is nothing disappointing about this movie!!  Went to see it at the theater with my 20 year old daughter who danced for 15 years and we both were VERY impressed.  It was thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end and had a great story line.  With an awesome cast... Cher and Christina were great together and the other actors were great as well.  Hollywood definitely chose the right actors for the right parts... I'll be shocked if this movie doesn't receive an Oscar nomination!,1290902400,6,546,4.71578947368421

I just got on the list to be alerted when it becomes available on Blu-Ray. The choreography and eye-candy is really outstanding. The music is really good too. Prior to this I was not a big fan of Christina Aguilera but now realize that she is truly a great singer. I also think that Cher is a great singer and actress, but personally don't like the sound of her voice so that would be my only disappointment with this movie. Still Cher does a great job and I enjoyed her perfomance nevertheless.",1290902400,3,620,4.3076923076923075
