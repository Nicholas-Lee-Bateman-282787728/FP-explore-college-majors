2024968,1,B0001UZZPO,"With Buck Jones and Dick Foran as the heroes, accompanied by cowboy sidekicks Leo carillo and Big Boy Williams, and the presence of Lon Chaney Jr and Charles Bickford as villains with support from Richard Alexander (Prince Barin of the Flash Gordon serials)and Roy Barcroft (the one and only Mr Heavy of many serials), how can Universal miss with this ""million dollar"" serial. But they did BIG TIME. Seeing one chapter after another, you get the feeling that you had seen it before. With but a wee bit change in locale or cirmcumstance, the gunfights, the chases, the ambushes, the fisticuffs are ""deja vuish"". There is no ""trick"" to incentivize the viewer to stay on with this serial to the end (i.e., a masked villain or some evil fiend whose idenitity will be revealed in the end). After a ziliion bullets expended during the first 14 chapters with hardly any person getting hit or wounded, suddenly in the last chapter, the heroes become sharpshooters and finish off the villians in a span of one minute of gunfighting. This is absolutely a most boring and insane serial. The Alpha release is also bad in terms of picture quality (not clear and mostly faded) and sound (muffled and unclear at times). If this chapter play was any good, I would have subsequently bought the VCI version (probably with better picture quality and sound at nearly 4 times the price of the Alpha release).

2024970,3,B0001UZZPO,"Road Show is far from Hal Roach's best, but nowhere near his worst either. Oddly, Adolph Menjou is the mediocrity in this film, the rest of the cast holds up pretty well.

The highlight of this film is 'The Charioteers,' a nearly forgotten African American ensemble from the 30's and 40's singing several songs including ""Calliope Jane."" The DVD audio transfer of the song from the film is better than any I've heard off old Columbia '78's.

Shemp Howard makes a cameo.",1121040000,4,469,4.7073170731707314
2024971,2,B0001UZZPO,"ROAD SHOW (1941) was one of the last films personally directed by Hal Roach (according to the credits, he had the help of Gordon Douglas, late of the Our Gang series, and Hal Roach, Jr.). It's a rather trifling waste of a lot of very appealing vintage talent.

John Hubbard is a rich, handsome young man who leaves a variety of lovely young ladies waiting at the alter. When he feigns mental illness to get out of marrying his latest conquest, the golddigger has him committed to a mental institution, but he escapes with the help of Colonel Caraway (""Of the caraway seeds fortune""), a crackpot who has invented a camera that takes blank pictures. Our two erstwhile nutcases hide out in a carnival run by the beautiful Carole Landis and her sidekick, the not so beautiful but much funnier Patsy Kelly. The cops, the golddigger, and some stray tramps are all after our heroes, for various reasons.

The above plot is supposed to hold an audience's interest for 85 minutes, but don't count on it. Hoagy Carmichael contributes some songs, but ""Stardust"" these ain't. A black rhythm group called the Charioteers sing most of the numbers, and they're great, but the songs are so sparse they sing each one a couple of times, and frankly, four black men singing a number called ""Yum Yum"" only reminds me of ""Uncle George"", the sideshow wild man, who chased the Little Rascals while yelling ""Yum! Yum! Eat `em up!"" in THE KID FROM BORNEO, a much better (and shorter) picture.

Adolphe Menjou plays Colonel Caraway, and his character is the best thing in the picture, not totally insane but a few playing cards short of a deck. Patsy Kelly is funny, and so is Willie Best, Negro comic who plays a very nervous lion-taming assistant. On the other hand, why on earth did Roach sign Shemp Howard and Johnny Arthur for the picture, and then give them such slight parts, amounting to little more than cameos? And why is Hubbard such a dull leading man? When Landis spends much of the picture resisting his ""charms"", we can totally empathize with her feelings. (Although Shemp is only in one scene, you'll get a laugh out of him: his character's name is ""Moe""!) Harry Langdon was one of the screenwriters, and when Hubbard dons tights and goes out reluctantly to do a circus act, you're going to be reminded of THE STRONG MAN, and you're going to think, ""Oh, boy!"" and oh, boy, are you going to be disappointed with the lameness of the bit.

ROAD SHOW is an okay picture; I mean, it doesn't stink. But Roach clearly intended it to be an ""A"" rather than a ""B"" movie, and with a better script and wiser use of talent, he might've achieved that. (Image has just released this film on DVD; it's a good print and transfer, some scratches, nothing major, no extras.)",1100390400,2,2745,4.595918367346939
2024979,5,B0001UZZPO,I have been a Gene Autry since childhood.  I love all of his movies.  I  wish they made movies like this today.  They were made for families without all the terrible language.  I don't think the language they use today is necessary.,1391731200,,232,4.428571428571429
2024980,5,B0001UZZPO,"I've seen Road Show at least a dozen times and I always really enjoy it. No one makes better comedies than Hal Roach - his films may be silly but they deliver lots of laughs. The real treat here is the beautiful blonde Carole Landis in one of her first major films. She gives a delightful performance as a circus owner trying to keep the show running. The rest of the cast is comedy gold - Patsy Kelly, Adolphe Menjou, John Hubbard, Charles Butterworth, and the adorable Margaret Roach. There's lots of circus gags and a few songs - it's just a really fun little comedy.",1390867200,,570,4.386792452830188
2024981,3,B0001UZZPO,"""Riders of Death Valley,"" Universal's ""Million Dollar Serial"" was clearly intended to be something special, better than their usual output.  Released in 1941 and Directed by Ford Beebe and Ray Taylor, it was the last 15-chapter Universal serial, featuring a large cast familiar from ""B"" Westerns and serials, adding Charles Bickford as the main outlaw leader.

Jim Benton (Dick Foran) leads the ""Riders of Death Valley"" to protect miners and prospectors against outlaws, headed by Wolf Reade (Charles Bickford) but secretly hired by saloon owner Joseph Kirby (James Blaine), who wants to take over the miners' claims.  An old prospector, Chuckawalla Charlie (Frank Austin) is brought into the saloon, dying, and gives Benton a map of his find, the ""Lost Aztec"" mine, making him co-heir with Mary Morgan (Jeanne Kelly), Chuckawalla's niece.  When Kirby fails to gain possession the map, he has ""The Wolf"" pursue Benton and his party, resulting in a chase lasting most of the remaining 14 chapters.  Opening titles are accompanied by the song ""Ride Along"" by Milton Rosen and Everett Carter, belted out by Foran and chorus in a studio, while the actors are shown riding and making faces as if they were singing.  At least they don't do that during the chapters.

While mostly a repetitive running gun battle, it should be remembered that the chapters provided a weekly ""fix"" of cowboy action, and the plot wasn't especially important.  It also didn't matter that some of the cliffhangers are not resolved convincingly; it was enough that the hero survived.  Viewed with some time between the chapters, interest is maintained by the cast of familiar faces, and some well-managed humor.

Benton's riders include Tombstone (Buck Jones), Borax Bill (Guinn ""Big Boy"" Williams), and Pancho (Leo Carrillo).  Noah Beery, Jr. is prominent in the cast list as Smoky, but supporting character Tex (Glenn Strange) is given more to do.  Kirby is assisted by Rance Davis (Monte Blue) and Dan Gordon (William Hall), while Wolf Reade's ""pack"" includes Lon Chaney, Jr., Roy Barcroft, Richard Alexander, Jack Rockwell and Ethan Laidlaw.  Several familiar faces from ""B"" westerns and serials appear in minor roles, including Jack Perrin, Edmund Cobb, Slim Whitaker and Ernie Adams.

While the serial is lacking in several respects, I like the humor, especially that from Buck Jones, who isn't saddled with the awkward dialogue he had the same year in Columbia's ""White Eagle.""  Leo Carrillo's line ""Let's Went"" is uttered nearly as often by Dick Foran.  And there's unintentional humor; regardless of how many of Wolf's ""pack"" get shot off their horses, there are still six of them pursuing Benton's riders.  It's like the number of bullets in their ""six shooters.""  And how many large bodies of water can they find to plunge into in Death Valley?

VCI's DVD edition, #8435, is on two discs.  It has a few shortcomings, most-annoying of which is their logo, large and fairly bright, which appears for 20 seconds every two minutes.  I was a little surprised that I didn't notice them as much later in the chapters; they were still present.  The decent image quality of the transfer helps compensate for them, though the source prints were hardly as good as what VCI had for ""The Green Hornet Strikes Again"" or the 1945 version of ""Secret Agent X-9.""  There is a moderate amount of ""grain"" and more than a few ""funhouse mirror"" effects, possibly where scratches were ""corrected"" and in common with the other editions, a couple chapters have dark streaks through the picture during the ""Foreword"" text, apparently a film processing problem.  These faults may have been beyond VCI's abilities to correct, but other issues were not.  We get the usual ""restoration cheat"" where all but the first chapter use the opening credits from Chapter Two, with MPPDA certificate number 6748; not a big deal in itself but the uncorrected faults become obvious when repeated in the last 14 chapters, such as one of those dimensional distortions in the rock cliffs at the left of the screen at the credit for the directors.  The titles start abruptly, missing the opening cymbal crash in the music, though this is no worse than the first chapter which begins a little further into the music, with a bad speed glitch.  Perhaps to disguise the rough start, Universal's logo, the one with the reflective globe, has been tacked in before each chapter, but it looks like it came from a VHS tape, with lots of video noise and a head-switch glitch at the bottom.  But unlike VCI's pop-up logos, these faults don't affect the content of the chapters, and otherwise the picture is sharp, the gray scale decent, and only a few splices, scratches and similar defects are seen.  The sound is good, fairly crisp with little noise and low distortion.  VCI provides some ""extra"" features; ""Bios"" of Buck Jones, Dick Foran, Noah Beery Jr., Guinn ""Big Boy"" Williams, Leo Carrillo and the two directors; a ""Photo Gallery"" with seven still pictures from ""Riders of Death Valley"" and lobby cards from nine serial movies; trailers from ""Winners of the West,"" ""Raiders of Ghost City"" and one lasting only 40 seconds from ""Riders of Death Valley"" and the ""VCI Serial/Cliffhanger Promo"" with clips from serial movie trailers, advertising their DVD editions, some of which are no longer available.

VCI's old VHS edition, # 1707, was from a print with many of the same faults, and while the actual sharpness wasn't too bad, the video noise and inferior gray scale made the details harder to see.  It seemed to have the correct MPPDA certificate numbers on the chapters, though guesswork was needed in reading some of them, and splices often interrupted the opening song.  Most of the chapters don't clip the opening music, though the sound was a little noisy, lacking in high frequencies and somewhat distorted.

The main virtue of Alpha's DVD, # ALP 4127D is its low cost.  In addition to techincal faults, it is now supplied on a ""burned"" DVD-R disc, which is double-layer and incompatible with many DVD players.  Check the instruction manual for ""DVD-R DL"" and ""DVD+R DL"" as compatible disc types.  Even Alpha's program notes are a little lacking, written as if Lon Chaney, Jr. was the main star of the serial, and failing to list Dick Foran anywhere on the cover.  Alpha appears to have used the same video source as VCI's VHS edition, and while the video noise is a little lower, the image is otherwise worse, looking gray and washed out.  The sound is quite horrible, with a ""torn speaker cone"" type of distortion, some chapters bad enough to make the dialogue hard to understand.  Alpha puts their logo on-screen during the chapter ""forewords"" though only for about ten seconds, and they keep them turned off otherwise.

The serial is recommended especially to fans of Dick Foran, Buck Jones and Leo Carrillo, and of the editions VCI's DVD is the best choice.  The pop-up logos are an annoyance, which is why I give it only a 3-star ""OK"" rating, but the good sharpness and gray scale are a big help, given that the scenery is more interesting than the plot.  The Alpha edition is a lot cheaper, but its defects, especially the distorted sound, make it hard to appreciate what the serial has to offer.  VCI's old VHS tape is only slightly better than Alpha's DVD.  But with any edition, viewing should be limited to one chapter at a time, with a day or more between them.",1367971200,2,7412,4.884984025559105
2024982,4,B0001UZZPO,"The Hal Roach edition from Image is the only option I would advise getting.  There were no real issues with this release. The print shows it age with white specks and lines, but no splices.  The volume is a bit low.",1351900800,,215,4.219512195121951
2024983,5,B0001UZZPO,Good music if you like this type of music. Purchased for mother in law as it is her taste in tunes. Not my style but not bad.,1339027200,,125,3.6666666666666665
2024984,4,B0001UZZPO,"A typical period comedy with some goofy characters in John Hubbard and Adolphe Menjou as a couple of escapees from a nut house.  Neither is actually nuts but are there for other reasons.  Carole Landis is the female lead as the owner of a roving carnival.

It's a movie that grew on me after I watched it a couple of times.  At first it seemed quite disjointed (probably from listening to other reviewers of the film) but after the second time I watched it, it became more entertaining and quite funny in its own way.

There's quite a bit of odd goofiness in this movie that doesn't seem to exactly fit but somehow they keep pulling it together enough for the movie to keep moving.  Keep in mind the period when it was made and you'll see a lot more in this movie than you otherwise might.

Adolphe Menjou is the best part as the well meaning ""Colonel Caraway"" who befriends John Hubbard's character, ""Drogo Gaines"" and does his best to steer Drogo in the right direction.  Of course it always seems that Drogo is getting into a little more trouble from Caraway's actions than he'd like but in the end, well, just watch the movie.",1301875200,5,1130,4.451456310679611
2024985,1,B0001UZZPO,"Given the cast, this is a shocking stinker.  The plot rambles, whole scenes are ridiculous, there can't be more than a single laugh in this ""comedy,"" and the music is the worst Hoagy Carmichael you will ever hear.  One feels sorry for the cast, especially Adolph Menjou, who has to play a nut, and Carol Landis, who had capabilities that Hollywood underestimated.  And then there is poor Willy Best, whose ignorant and fearful black stereotype seems unusually cruel today.  And Patsy Kelly, a talented comedian who appears in one embarrassing scene after another.

This was meant to be a screwball comedy.  It doesn't come close.  My copy goes in the wastebasket; I wouldn't want to inflict this on anyone.",1252627200,,706,4.882352941176471
2024986,1,B0001UZZPO,"This serial itself deserves 5 stars, but the Alpha DVD deserves none.  Besides the print quality, Alpha has marked the DVD with their logo during the credits.  Unfortunately, while VCI has a great looking print, they have also added their logo to the film many times.  Logo's do not belong on DVD's that the consumer is paying money for.  I've noticed Alpha has their logo on DVD's put out in 2005-2006.  I don't know if they still do this.  2004 and earlier DVD's have not had the logo. Regardless, I no longer purchase any Alpha DVD because of the logo issue.",1242604800,,561,4.5049504950495045
2024987,5,B0001UZZPO,"First off, the 5 stars are for the serial and not for VCI's presentation which rates zero.  This is one of a handfull of VCI's serials where their logo pops up here and there.

2024988,5,B0001UZZPO,"I don't know that Gene Autry ever made a strickly western western, mostly they are musical entertainments with a western background.  Saw this movie recently on Encore Westerns and enjoyed every musical moment.

Between Gene and his sidekick Smiley the humor and music are up to par, and with Mary Lee things as usual are very good.  She was one sensational gal who could take even a clunker of a song and make it sound good, and she is served up a couple of lesser songs in this movie. The tap dancing of Carol Adams is something different to an Autry venue and it is also very good.

The combination of plot and riverboat minstrel show are a sure bet to entertain for the 75 minute movie.  The bad guys are bank robbers and though they do murder a couple people, the violence is almost non existent and typical to a late 30's-early 40's movie, the bad guys are fairly 2nd rate mobsters.  Pretty good shoot out near the end of the movie, too.

Great viewing for us Autry fans.  Others may not be so keen for the movie but it remains a very entertaining movie never-the-less.

I hate it when I purchase a movie they haven't the right to do this. All dvd movies..I own Don't show any ""LOGOS""during the movies. I guess VCI is bragging about..""RIDERS""!  It's not a bad serial..but every time..the bad guys are chasing the good guys thru out the serial. And the good guys are not every out number. But to watch BUCK JONES is worth the money. He is funny,witty & great. Along with Pancho. So I might go ahead and buy this version. In the past..VCI never shown ""LOGOS""So why now?",1203638400,3,667,4.512396694214876

My only negetive thing about this serial is..it repeats itself over & over. Where it could have been done in 12 chapters..however I'm glad it's 15 chapters. I loved BUCK JONES..he held up the whole serial with the help of the great LEO CARRILLO.And to have it in Sepria print...I CAN'T WAIT!I feel a lot of classic westerns..such as..HIGH NOON..had it been filmed in SEPRIA..it would look more like the real west..the old color like.

BIOS:
1. Gene Autry
Date of Birth: 29 September 1907 - Near Tioga, Texas
Date of Death: 2 October 1998 - Studio City, Los Angeles, California

Special footnote, Orvon Gene Autry was an American performer who gained fame as The Singing Cowboy on the radio, in movies and on television --- Discovered by film producer Nat Levine in 1934, he and Burnette made their film debut for Mascot Pictures Corp. ""In Old Santa Fe"" as part of a singing cowboy quartet; he was then given the starring role by Levine in 1935 in the 12-part serial ""The Phantom Empire"" --- Shortly thereafter, Mascot was absorbed by the formation of Republic Pictures Corp. and Autry went along to make a further 44 films up to 1940, all B westerns in which he played under his own name, rode his horse Champion, had Burnette as his regular sidekick and had many opportunities to sing in each film --- Autry became the top Western star at the box-office by 1937, reaching his national peak of popularity from 1940 to 1942. His Gene Autry Flying ""A"" Ranch Rodeo show debuted in 1940 --- Gene Autry is the only celebrity to have five stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one in each of the five categories maintained by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce --- Radio, Films, Recordings, Television and Live Theater.

2. Smiley Burnette (aka: Lester Alvin Burnette)
Date of Birth: 18 March 1911 - Summum, Illinois
Date of Death: 16 February 1967 - Encino, California

Second special footnote, Lester Alvin (Smiley) Burnette an American singer-songwriter who could play as many as 100 different musical instruments, was a successful comedy actor in Western films over three decades --- The popularity of Burnette's Frog Millhouse character, with his trademark floppy black hat, was such that when Autry left for World War II service he did sidekicks duties with Eddie Dew, Sunset Carson and Bob Livingston, plus nine other films with Roy Rogers. After leaving Republic Pictures in 1944, Burnette became the sidekick to Charles Starrett at Columbia Pictures in the long Durango Kid series. Starrett starred in the series from 1944 until 1952, and that pairing resulted in more than 50 films. After the Starrett series was over, Burnette joined Autry for his final six films, all released by Columbia Pictures in 1953.

2025011,2,B0001UZZPO,"I really thought that it was impossible for a film starring Adolphe Menjou to be this bad. Menjou was capable of ably playing a variety of characters from villain to tarnished hero, and he was also very able at playing comedy. However, even the talented Menjou cannot save this film. The plot is that young wealthy playboy Drogo Gaines (John Hubbard) gets cold feet on his wedding day, and decides to pretend he is insane. His jilted bride retaliates by having him committed. In the asylum, Gaines meets Carleton Carroway (Adolphe Menjou), and together the two escape and join a traveling carnival. In time, and through a series of comic misadventures, Gaines falls for Penguin Moore (Carole Landis), the beautiful leader of the carnival.

The problem is that besides Menjou, the players are just not that talented, and the jokes are just not that funny. Also, neither the overall plot nor the mismatched romance is very compelling. Cut down to 20 minutes or so, this might have been an OK 1940's comic short, but at 70 minutes it just seems to drag on forever. Hal Roach was capable of much funnier stuff. I would definitely pass on this one.",1175817600,2,1143,4.743718592964824
2025012,5,B0001UZZPO,"An earlier review by ""Mr. Jim"" expresses my same views on RIDERS OF DEATH VALLEY. It is one of the finest serials, certainly the finest Western serial, ever made. Released by Universal, reputedly in sepia tone and costing one million dollars to make, and featuring one of the finest casts to be corraled by any studio at the time, RIDERS OF DEATH VALLEY will offer just about any viewer thrills, chills, and spills...amidst magnificent scenery and great camera work. VCI has obtained an immaculate print, sharp and clean, and the soundtrack is fine. With such familiars as Dick Foran, Buck Jones, Charles Bickford, Leo Carrillo, Noah Beery Jr., Guinn ""Big Boy"" Williams, Glenn Strange, Roy Barcroft, Monte Blue, Ethan Laidlaw, and a host of other stalwarts ridin' and shootin', well, this is the kind of entertainment that won't let you down. VCI has attractively packaged this release, with all sorts of extras, including cast bios'. The price is right, and this release is highly recommended. Our thanks again to VCI for a superior product at a reasonable price....",1156636800,10,1067,5.0
2025013,2,B0001UZZPO,"I managed to finish the Alpha release of RIDERS OF DEATH VALLEY.  It nearly finished me!  If you have to have it, the VCI release is probably the better choice for sound and picture quality.

The 1941 serial, a Universal product, is alternately goofy and tedious, with no resemblance to a taut chapterplay like FLASH GORDON, released only five years earlier by the studio.  Way too long at fifteen chapters, it nonetheless makes an effort to tell a story with recognizable characters--that is, characters with actual personalities, rare in the world of serials.  Most of the actors, some of them well above average, seem to be enjoying themselves and the quirky script.  Light humor is the order of the day among the Riders (good-guy vigilantes who are out to protect miners' interests against corrupt businessmen and their hired guns), with Guinn ""Big Boy"" Williams and Leo Carillo playing a sagebrush version of the Bickersons, while Buck Jones throws in one wisecrack after another (often aimed at Carillo's fractured English).  As Pancho, Leo Carillo plays a somewhat feistier version of the Pancho he would play alongside Duncan Renaldo in TV's  THE CISCO KID.  Watching that series as a child, I had no idea that Carillo had already used the line ""Let's went!"" seven thousand four hundred and sixty-seven times before--and all in this serial.

Among the heavies, Charles Bickford's Wolfe Reade stands out.  A worthy villain--he even scares his own men.  Bickford had appeared with Garbo in ANNA CHRISTIE a decade earlier and looks annoyed at having to gallop around in the tumbleweeds with Lon Chaney, Jr.

The town to which everyone repairs now and then is called Panamint, which sounds like something you might put on your toothbrush.  Every establishing shot of the town shows the same horses clopping down the street and the same old timer sitting in the same spot, puffing on his pipe.  Outside of town, the Riders really do seem to be in Death Valley (or on the moon).  They ride up and down the most inhospitable-looking crags and outcroppings of rock imaginable; the horses have incredibly solid footing, as if they know that a stumble here would send them immediately to the glue factory.  I found myself breathing a sigh of relief whenever they turned a corner and suddenly found themselves among the scrub and familiar boulders of Iverson Ranch, where it was finally safe for a cowboy to be shot from his horse.

This was the ""million-dollar serial.""  They must have spent it on bullets.",1148428800,6,2504,4.904988123515439
2025014,3,B0001UZZPO,"This review refers to the Critics Choice DVD named Tex Ritter Triple Feature #4.

Riding the Cherokee Trail, 1941, 59 min

Tex Ritter called it a career 5 years before I was born, nonethelss, he's one of my favorite cowboys.

The movies in this DVD are not pristine. Digital restoration or remasterization cleans up the picture somewhat, but will not eliminate scratches. Anyway, this is a good buy all around.

It has more of everything with lots of action, hard riding chases and plenty of shootouts...Universal Pictures publicity department reportedly budgeted one million dollars for ""Riders of Death Valley"", this was an unheard dollar amount for any B-Western.

The ""Riders"" are a group of stout hearted men protecting local miners from the bad guys of the territory...Jim Benton and Tombstone head up the riders...at the other end of the story we have a pack of wolves lead by Wolf Reade, Kirby and Davis who control the town and want more, meaning gold and total power...Benton has part ownership in the ""Lost Aztec Mine"" along with Mary Morgan...can Benton fight off Wolf Reade and the other hyenas....each episode gets closer to the answer, watch this and relive those thrilling yesteryears of the Saturday Matinee.

B-Westerns fans all love and know Leo Carillo who virtually played the same character, better known as Pancho every week in the ""Cisco Kid"" television series...Dick Foran went on to costar in John Ford westerns...Glenn Strange played the ""Frankinestein"" monster in various horror films and then became Sam the bartender in the weekly ""Gunsmoke"" television series....Lon Chaney Jr also went the horror film trail as ""The Wolf Man"" aka Lyle Talbott...Buck Jones had been around westerns since 1918 would be cast in the ""Rough Rider"" series just prior to his tragic death in 1942, he was a legend and pioneer in the early B-Westerns...almost a class reunion of B-Western alumni...can't make a good Western without those veterans...don't miss one single episode that will keep you thrilled until the next chapter the following week.

2025016,5,B0001UZZPO,"Can`t praise this enough. Great Serial with all the thrills and spills you expect. Wagons over cliffs, Thundering herds ect. And what a cast. Dick Foran who i can never get enough of. A DVD release of his movies are long overdue. The last appearance of the legendary Buck Jones although doubled by Rod Cameron and in some scenes it shows. Leo Carillo as Pancho ten years before he was Cisco`s side kick with wonderful lines like ""Lets went"" and ""I theenk i hear footprints"". Two Jr`s Noah Beery and Lon Chaney. Guinn ""Big Boy"" Williams as the wonderfully named Borax Bill. Charles Bickford as Wolf Reade one of the land grabbers and Glenn Strange in a rare clean shaven good guy role. Familiar cast of villians including Monte Blue who i will always remember as Unga Khan in Undersea Kingdom.

 Universals first million-dollar production although visibly quite a lot of stock footage is used but thats not a problem everyone did that Gene Autry included. I had already seen a friends copy on video which was very faded and bad quality  so naturally i was reluctant to buy it. After reading other reviews about the DVD transfer and  quality i bought it and was glad i did. We are possibly seeing it now in better condition  than it was seen all those years ago at the Saturday Matinees.
