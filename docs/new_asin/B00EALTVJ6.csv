5899649,5,B00EALTVJ6,I am looking forward to getting this box set also. I bought the first two box sets and am not going to get the Power Rangers Legacy collection Shout Factory is releasing. I believe Shout Factory is coming out with the Legacy collection so when you get this set you get all 20 Seasons of Power Rangers. I am so glad I got the first 2 box sets. This was and still is one of my favorite shows of all time.,1376179200,14,402,3.9753086419753085
5899650,5,B00EALTVJ6,"Im looking forward to this because I bought the first two boxsets. I will be buying this instead of , the legacy collection shout factory is coming out with also, I think it's very unfair for Shout Factory to do that when fans  just bought  the 40 disc collection just last year. Just to make a 98 disc set the following year .",1376179200,3,327,4.174603174603175

5899652,5,B00EALTVJ6,The set is awesome,1453248000,,18,3.75
5899653,5,B00EALTVJ6,"Having just finished watching the seasons in this set (owned it for two years but hey there's other shows I got hooked into) so let's get started with Lightspeed Rescue. Initially I didn't think I'd like this season from what I had heard and the episodes on the Best of DVD weren't the best to highlight what was good about it. Fortunately I was proven wrong and I had a lot of fun seeing it was different from what we had with the past two seasons being in space. It was interesting to see the powers being made by the military and that the Rangers constantly had upgrades or new weapons added to their arsenal (kind of reminded me of Zeo in a way) to meet the onslaught of the demons. Also the first American exclusive Ranger was introduced this season with the Titanium Ranger (of course he doesn't stick around long until the end since shooting original footage is expensive). The one disappointing thing this season had to offer was the villains. They weren't fun like Rita and Divatox, scary like Lord Zedd or were remotely interesting like Astronema and Trakeena. They were just generic evil (and who builds a city on top of a demon fortress?).

Time Force I had never seen but I greatly enjoyed it, some of the best, if not the best acting the show has had. It seemed like the production team really put a lot of effort into this one, or at the least had more of a budget to work with since I'm sure it wasn't cheap to block off parts of L.A. to match some of the bigger scenes from the Sentai. Ransik was a great villain (far more intimidating than if they left Gluto, who is the main villain in Timeranger); he had a great design, he was a threat towards the team and he could pull weapons from his body (well that's one of my reasons anyway). Frax was a great sympathetic villain and wish we had more of them (I know we kinda sorta get more but I just wish they didn't always turn out to be related to one of the Rangers, the closest I can think of is Jarrod and Camille in Jungle Fury). Nadira however is probably the worst villain in the season. She's too goofy (even compared to the villains of Turbo though Elgar gives her a run for goofiest villain as of this set) and her shift in attitude in the final three episodes seem too forced. If it was played out more or even if she was played by a better actress who could've made her turn more convincing. Other than that Time Force was a great season.

Wild Force I'm mixed on. Sometimes it's good and then other times it's really bad. It's a mix between the story and the acting, which can be painful at times but not as painful as the acting from Operation Overdrive, Samurai or Megaforce. The plot of ""pollution is bad is rather cheesy, even for this show when they did several one off episodes back in season 1 (but as one offs, the message is fine though forced). At least there's a better story in Red Ranger Cole finding out about his past and how it deals with Master Org. The best episodes of the season, in my opinion, is the two part team-up with Time Force. Forever Red is also a highlight and is the best anniversary episode of the series (though when the competition is Once A Ranger and Legendary Battle, that's not much).  Overall I like it but its not in my top 10, maybe 15.

Ninja Storm is another mixed bag for me. I remember watching episodes when it originally aired but nothing about it was memorable. Lothor, while a great fighter, wasn't a very good villain. His master plan just seemed like it was made up as he went along while the only competent member of his crew, Zurgane, gets ridiculed by the rest. The Rangers themselves I liked but I just wish there was more story to the season than what was present. The self-referential humor was good too.

Dino Thunder again I watched when it first aired and while, like Ninja Storm, I didn't watch weekly, I did remember it better. Tommy is back though that's not the reason I remember it fondly (though I did enjoy seeing his little video diary of previous teams and the episode where he had to fight his previous Ranger powers). The Rangers were good and felt more like teenagers with attitude than the original team. Mesogog was a superior villain to Lothor in almost everyway (was so happy he was bottled up). If I didn't like anything about this season it was the silly powered up form Mesogog received in the finale. In many ways, Dino Thunder made for a better anniversary season that what would come down the road.

Overall there's not a bad season in the bunch, the Ninja Storm's probably the one I like the least (though it is enjoyable). The next set has probably some of the most divisive seasons in the fandom in terms of liked and disliked (though I think it's universal that Overdrive is despised).",1451347200,,4749,4.384790011350738

5899680,4,B00EALTVJ6,"Once again, Shout! factory delivers yet another high quality Power Rangers boxset.  This set includes every single episode of Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue, Power Rangers Time Force, Power Rangers Wild Force, Power Rangers Ninja Storm, and Power Rangers Dino Thunder.  I was very happy with the set.  The only thing that worried me a little was that a few of the season boxes were a little damaged, but not even close to beyond the ability to contain the discs themselves.  Looks like it might have been a slight factory defect, but all the discs play perfectly and I'm still quite pleased with the product.  There were also a few missing teasers at the ends of some episodes, but Shout! factory did their very best to gather most of them in each season.  I've said it many times, but Shout is the absolute best when it comes to releasing boxsets such as these.",1397520000,,863,4.644736842105263

5899683,5,B00EALTVJ6,"This is it; without a doubt, ""Seasons 8-12"" is the best of Shout Factory's Power Ranger boxed sets. While the quality of the Japanese has only marginally improved, the show itself has come to grow up with it's audience (albeit, very slowly) and the seasons contained here include some of the show's darker moments.

In ""Time Force,"" the original Red Ranger is killed in battle with the villain before credits roll on episode one; Ransik himself is the most evil villain any incarnation of the Power Rangers have faced since Lord Zedd appeared in Season 2. In ""Wild Force,"" all ten of the previous Red Rangers unite to take on a villain from the past. ""Ninja Storm"" has, of course, ninjas, as well as TWO evil Power Rangers for our heroes to contend with. And ""Dino Thunder"" features the return of Tommy, the original Green Ranger. And don't even get me started on ""Lightspeed Rescue.""

As with the other three Shout! Factory sets, this one is loaded with special features. ""Pure Titanium"" takes a look at the first Power Ranger created exclusively for the American show; ""Ranger Tales"" has cast members telling stories from their time on set; and this set makes it three-for-three on documentaries focused on the fans, this one focusing on the internet community.

Shout Factory seems to have found a package design they like, as they've stuck with a box art theme identical to the last set. The booklet is again included, with the now-standard character bios and episode guide; I've officially given up hope of seeing airdates in these books.

The third boxed set in Shout Factory's Power Rangers releases is by far the best of the three so far. With the final boxed set coming up to contain the rest of the Disney-era Power Rangers, this may also wind up being the best of them all.",1394150400,,1784,4.708333333333333

Every episode from 2000-2004, so many nostalgic memories and great action! Only thing I didn't like about it was that the Time Force episodes in this collection are the ones that were edited after Disney bought the show; cutting out some epic scenes of destruction. Now I know how those Star Wars fans feel when a new version of the original trilogy comes out. But no, this is a great collection to have and I am very grateful to Shout!

5899711,5,B00EALTVJ6,"This is what I've been eagerly awaiting since the announcement of these mega-sets. These seasons are some of my favorites, including my top one, Lightspeed Rescue. It also ends my relationship with the series as I had stopped watching after Dino Thunder (though I have heard amazing things about SPD). A quick summary of the seasons:

Lightspeed Rescue brought the Power Rangers back to Earth, the previous two seasons being set in space. It also marked the complete end of the Zordon era, with the removal of Alpha and the Megaship from In Space. Another notable mention is the first ever American Ranger in Ryan Mitchell, the Titanium Ranger. An interview is included on the bonus disc in this set (looking forward to it). Not considered the best of the series by many, I really loved this one. Also, honorable mention to Carter Grayson, labeled a total bad*** in the fandom.

Time Force was, in a word, dark. No, not the lighting. This season really brought the storyline to a new level, with subjects of destiny and whether we can change it, racism, and love that failed in the end. It lets you know this by killing the red ranger in the first episode. This was a great season as well and my only complaint was that this season was a bit effects-heavy, even by Power Rangers standards. The acting is top-notch, but that was never a big importance for me with this series.

Wild Force can be summed up in two words, ""Forever Red"". Yes, you should know what this is if you are considering purchasing this set, unless it's as a gift. This season was, in my opinion, a step-down from the last two. It does have its moments, especially with the sixth ranger's appearance. Honestly, I didn't catch more than half of this season, but I did see the finale and it was pretty glorious.

Ninja Storm is one I saw very little of. It didn't look interesting to me and the CGI gerbil was certainly no Zordon. The villain was overly comedic and I never really thought he'd have a chance of beating the rangers, so there was never a valid threat in my mind. This is pretty much a less-worse version of Turbo, unless they snuck in a stereotypical New Yorker Alpha in one episode. Pay attention at the end because we get an appearance from the twin brother of the next red ranger.

Lastly we have Dino Thunder, which was trying to channel a modern version of Mighty Morphin. You had the dinosaur focused suits and swords, the evil ranger that befriends the team as a normal teenager and later joins, and of course the return of Tommy Oliver. The design of the villain was amazing and used practical makeup and animatronics, and honestly a bit frightening. It reminded me of Zedd, which brings another comparison between the seasons. The characters were fine and it's always nice to see Tommy again, even if it does contradict earlier information.

I own the previous sets and they both look and sound great, and purchasing this will net you the exclusive bonus feature disc. I am buying this because I enjoyed the series up to Dino Thunder, and buying the legacy collection would leave me with eight seasons I really do not care for.",1377561600,20,3119,4.590664272890485

5899713,5,B00EALTVJ6,"Finally! I've been waiting for news on the next set of seasons for Power Rangers. I started out watching this back when I was just a child. It's hard to believe it's been 20 years already since the very first season premiered on TV. I'm not afraid to admit I'm 33 and I still watch Power Rangers every now and then. I even bought the 7 season set from Time Life. It was definitely a worthwhile investment, and now comes the next set. Lightspeed Rescue was the first season in which the rangers identities were known by the public as opposed to previous seasons when they were kept secret(the exception being the last episode of Power Rangers In Space entitled Countdown to Destruction part 2, in which the Rangers revealed their identities to the public near the end). This box set also contains the first season that was made after Disney acquired the rights. That season was Power Rangers Wild Force. Disney would keep the rights and make about seven more seasons under the Power Rangers name. Saban re-acquired the rights a about a decade later with the start of Power Rangers Samurai. Aside from all that, I'm absolutely looking forward to this set, and am already looking forward to a release date for seasons 13-17, or however the next set after this will go. If you were ever a fan of this series, I highly recommend adding this to your collection. Of course, you could always wait for the 20 season set with the 2 movies later this year too if you want. All up to you.",1376956800,,1476,4.5111940298507465
5899714,5,B00EALTVJ6,"FINALLY, Power Rangers seasons 8-12 will come on sale. I waited so long for these seasons to come out on DVD because Lightspeed Rescue-Wild Force are my favorite seasons. It has been 20 years since Power Rangers come on air in 1993. I love Power Rangers since I was a kid and 20 years later, I am a 28 year old man who is still a loyal fan of Power Rangers. I hope Shout Factory will release the Power Rangers seasons 13-17 to their loyal Power Rangers fans.",1376784000,10,458,4.215909090909091
5899715,5,B00EALTVJ6,"i knew that legacy helmet thing was coming out and i didn't have plans on buying it because i already have the MMPR seasons. cant wait to buy this, the season 4-7 pack & future seasons.",1376784000,2,185,4.166666666666667
5899716,5,B00EALTVJ6,"I bought the two sets of Mighty Morphin box set and Seasons 4-7 together straight from Shout Factory and I love them but was wondering when they would release the rest. A few weeks ago I learned that there would be a complete series set of all 20 seasons (with extra slots for the 2 movies) in a Jason (Mighty Morphin Power Rangers' Red Ranger) helmet. This left me very happy, sad and confused all at the same time. I was happy that there would finally be a complete set of every season starting 20 years ago at the original all the way to the latest season of Mega Force with an awesome helmet case for every single disc and even spaces for the two movies (which you can find just about anywhere for about $5 each now). I was very sad to see this because I spent over $200 already for almost half of the seasons and if I bought this, I would have 7 seasons of duplicate discs and wasted money. I was confused because I thought that they had completely forgotten about the season box sets and went straight to the awesome 20 season set and there was no news of when or if we would ever see them again, only speculation from fan sites, and I wondering if they would just leave the fans that already bought the same thing that I had high and dry.

I am looking up something completely different and see an Amazon ad pop up on the side of the website and guess what they were advertising?...You guessed it. This very box set of Power Rangers seasons 8-12! I was so relieved and giddy with excitement that I decided to share my excitement by writing my first ever review on Amazon after being a customer since 2006! I am so happy that people like me who have loved this show since they were kids and may have lost track of the show over the years can finally get completely caught up once each box set is released. So far I have Seasons 1-7, both movies and Season 19 aka Super Samurai when the entire season box set came out last year (even though I haven't seen season 18 aka Samurai and 19 was a direct sequel of it). According to my calculations, there should be 2 more box sets after this one. Seasons 13-16 and 17-20. Or maybe they will go another way with it, but I hope that it happens soon!

The only thing I am upset about is that I read that the 20 season box set will be released on December 3, but this is supposed to release shortly before that on November 23, so what about the other 8 seasons? When will we get them? Who knows but for now, this should make many people like myself much happier and that much closer to completing their Power Rangers set.",1376611200,14,2566,4.213414634146342
5899717,5,B00EALTVJ6,"Holy smokes the next wave of Official Power Rangers DVD!!! I've purchased season 1-7 and could not be happier with Shout!'s production! Some worry about the quality of having 10 episodes on each disc, but it's really not that bad. I know the entire series (all 18 seasons) are available on Netflix but this is a FANTASTIC purchase for any PR fan or collector. Great quality, they took their time making these box sets.",1376438400,5,418,4.662162162162162
