5719030,5,B00CEJ1JB4,"The film Bidder 70 is the story of Tim DeChristopher, a courageous, caring, articulate young man who was imprisoned for standing up for justice and for the natural environment he loved. His is a disturbing but hopeful story.

By prosecuting him for bidding on land he never intended to purchase, in what turned out to be an illegal oil and gas auction, the federal government unwittingly gave Tim a prominent platform to speak out for justice and stewardship of the Earth. He simply sought to halt yet more drilling of climate-disrupting greenhouse gases, on pristine land around a national park no less.

The government's shameful actions have made him not just a sorely-needed, emerging leader of the climate action movement, but a hero for justice and democracy as well.

""At this point of unimaginable threats on the horizon, this is what hope looks like. In these times of a morally bankrupt government that has sold out its principles, this is what patriotism looks like. With countless lives on the line, this is what love looks like, and it will only grow... ""
--- Tim DeChristopher

You might think that by successfully prosecuting him and sending him to prison, the government won this fight. On the contrary, I think Tim clearly won. Yes, he suffered for those nearly two years in federal custody, but he has emerged a strong and dedicated leader who appears more determined than ever to step up the fight. And he's inspired countless people to boldly stand up and take action. I'm one of those so inspired.

So, part of me wants to say thank you to the federal government for over-reaching and prosecuting him. But mostly I say, thank you Tim DeChristopher.

And thank you to everyone responsible for giving us this excellent documentary.",1373414400,6,1750,4.855704697986577
5719031,5,B00CEJ1JB4,"In 2008, as George W. Bush tried to ""gift"" the energy and mining industries thousands of acres of pristine Utah wilderness via a widely disputed federal auction, an activist was born.  Don't let anyone tell you that sole activism is gone.  This documentary chronicles the actions of college student Tim DeChristopher from Salt Lake City who went to the bidding and won the land - 22,000 acres with NO intention to drill.  This was considered civil disobedience and the ball started to roll - in both directions.

We see Tim DeCrhistopher as a gentle but firm organizer of ""Peaceful Uprising"", a civil disobedience group full young and old people that just felt that this was all so very wrong of the government.  Through small groups and in ingenious ways, this group grew and grew while Mr. DeChristopher waited for his trial which he felt, was sure to get him jail time - possibly ten years ins a federal penitentiary.

Watching as months go by with delays, the group ""Peaceful Uprising"" continues to get out the message about global climate change, government and corporate corruption and the uphill battle that is slowly winning in America against those that would l destroy it.

It was one spontaneous act where one man stood up and said, `no, this is wrong'.  It snowballed.  This is one of the most inspirational documentaries about the this subject I have seen and considering that it took place in one of the most conservative parts of the country, one of the most beautiful and one of the most untouched - this is a staggering story.  Thank you to all involved.  DVD supplied by the amazing FirstRunFeatures for review.",1372464000,10,1629,4.7821428571428575
5719032,4,B00CEJ1JB4,Very good documentary. I highly recommend. Tho I would have liked more background info about the bidding itself. Bravo Tim!,1389484800,2,123,5.2
5719033,4,B00CEJ1JB4,"This is a true story, a documentary about one guy who decided to try to put a stop to the illegal sale of
Federal land to corporate developers by the Bush administration, one guy, Tim DeChristopher, a grad
student, after taking a look at some of the land on the block for sale (much of it beautiful, pristine
wilderness areas adjacent to National Park lands) decided to try to put a stop to it.  He did it by
entering the auction along with the corporate bidders, and bidding up the price of a number of the
most beautiful pieces of land to the point that he ""won"" them.  Of course, he didn't have enough
money to pay for them, so he was charged with, I forget, fraud, or disrupting something or other.
In the meantime, a Federal judge agreed that the whole auction process had been illegally done
so all of the sales were put on hold; Bush was replaced by Obama (who was supposed to be
an environmentalist just like he was supposed to be a lot of other things) and he thought, SURELY
his charges would be dropped.  But they WEREN'T.  In the end he did some Federal prison time
for stopping the sale of Federal lands that never should have been auctioned in the first place.
The story is a bit sad at times, but also quite inspiring, with a message that one committed person
really can make a difference to the world.  Well done, fast-paced enough, and engrossing.",1388966400,6,1364,4.396825396825397
5719034,5,B00CEJ1JB4,I just saw this film.  Courage is the word that comes to mind.  He fights the good fight of non violent civil disobedience and pays for it.  The hope is that this film will encourage others to do the same.,1386979200,,205,4.075
5719035,3,B00CEJ1JB4,"You must see the 2012 documentary BIDDER SEVENTY for its thirty minutes of invaluable information, which would make for a compelling segment on a television program such as SIXTY MINUTES.  The film tacks on another forty minutes of insignificance for the sake of feature length running time.  Take the bitter with the sweet.

That is not to say there is anything sweet about BIDDER SEVENTYs true story of activist Tim DeChristopher, who upends a giveaway of public lands to the gas and oil industry.  Breaking the letter of the law as opposed to its spirit is enough excuse for the moneyed interest-controlled governing powers that prosecute him.  Perpetrators of the lies that caused the Iraq war and the Wall Street executives who crashed the economy with illegal schemes have yet to see justice unless they watch repeats of NIGHT COURT, of course.

Now, for all I know SIXTY MINUTES or some such news program may have covered Tim DeChristophers story.  I don't watch television news, the conflict of interest of their corporate owners making trust difficult.  But it seems to me that, in this era of industry-controlled mass media, documentary films such as BIDDER SEVENTY too often serve the purpose once met by broadcast journalism.

See BIDDER SEVENTY.",1386201600,4,1258,5.009615384615385
5719036,4,B00CEJ1JB4,"Bidder 70 is the story of Tim DeChristopher, who upon learning that leases were to be sold for drilling rights to beautiful and sensitive BLM lands in his home of Utah, went to the bidders conference and found himself bidding for the drilling rights -- which of course, he had no intention of actually using to drill.  He won all his bids but it became apparent what he was up to and the auction was shut down.  In fact, just as he and other Utah residents had claimed, the auction itself was actually ruled illegal later.  But the prosecution of DeChristopher moved forward.  DeChristopher was someone who saw that he could make a difference if he was willing to risk the personal suffering of jail.  Through his actions, he helped bring light on what happened.  It disturbs me that even though the auction was ruled to have been illegally held, DeChristopher was prosecuted and jailed.  But it seems certain that without his actions, a real ""driller"" would have won the bid and maybe those lands would have been ruined, the illegality of the auction never coming to light.

I do believe that DeChristopher is a hero, and unlike many environmentalist documentaries, this one is tight and cohesive, isn't overly long, is well edited, and makes an entertaining story.

DeChristopher, who was a member of a Unitarian congregation at the time of these events, is now a student at Harvard Divinity school.",1383436800,,1401,4.780082987551867
5719037,3,B00CEJ1JB4,"If you are watching ""Bidder 70"" because you want to get closer to an environmental hero, to know him better, to know what motivated him to do such an extreme thing--this is the movie for you.  If you are watching the movie for entertainment--don't.  Like all other videos about the environment, it's too depressing.  Our terrestrial environment is on a very slippery slope.  But everybody reading this probably knows that.  If you are watching ""Bidder 70"" because you want to delve into the anti-fossil-fuel movement, find out what it believes in and where it's going, and learn what you might do to help carry it forward--don't.

So I had to give ""Bidder 70"" three stars because it fulfilled only half of what I wanted, which was to: 1) know Tim DeChristopher and 2) learn about the movement that formed around him.  The other reviews do an excellent job of exploring DeChristopher, so I won't discuss that.  What really disappointed me was that there was not just little, but absolutely nothing, about what specific actions the movement was trying to extract from whom?  I presume the ""whom"" is the United States Government, but whom within that colossus?

But what do the activists want done?  What specific actions do they desire?  I can't believe that the movement is just about protecting beautiful landmarks.  It goes much deeper, all the way to reducing fossil fuel consumption and arresting global warming.  As laudable as that is, how do you make it happen?  There is no inkling of that answer except to petition our Government to do ""something.""  That is a potential danger of this movie--that it encourages people to pressure Government to do ""something.""  It's like encouraging a child to eat more candy.  Doing ""something"" is exactly what Government thrives on.  Doing ""something"" is an invitation for Government to grow, and Government has been the largest and longest running growth industry in our history.

But our Government's activities to do ""something"" in its typically secretive and heavy-handed ways are exactly what has made Americans the fossil-fuel-consumption champs of the world.  We consume too much stuff, nearly all of which is highly energy intensive to manufacture and deliver, because stuff is so cheap.  And stuff, from food to movies to shoes, is so cheap because of government subsidies.  Just name a resource, and it is likely that the United States Government and/or many other governments, including our state governments, contribute heavily to the resource's production via direct contributions of money, land, and legal rights; plus free or subsidized military protection, market promotion, employee health care and education, R&D, transportation, environmental cleanup, assassinations, loans, tax breaks, central bank manipulations, and so on.

The maintenance of cheap prices of labor and mineral resources in third world countries has been the principle focus of American foreign policy for well over a century.  For example, several economic studies have found that the real cost of oil, considering all subsidies at all levels of government and society, is anywhere from three to six times the direct sticker price.  The 3x-to-6x number, in fact, is how much we are actually paying for it, but indirectly through taxes, national debt, dead and maimed soldiers, rising chronic disease rates, congestion, and a host of other intangible costs.

That is the consequence of Government doing ""something.""  We better be very careful about demands we make on Government.  It will always be happy to do ""something.""

Note: I just recently published an Amazon review of a book about this very issue of Government doing ""something"" to solve real and created problems.  My review is three stars.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Delusions-of-Power-New-Explorations-of-the-State-War-and-Economy/dp/1598130455/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Delusions of Power: New Explorations of the State, War, and Economy</a>",1379116800,6,3984,5.4397394136807815
5719038,3,B00CEJ1JB4,"i was a little disappointed with this documentary. there is much to be admired about Tim DeChristopher, but a better background on what he is fighting for and how the larger movement exists would have been helpful. it was a bit too hagiographic. Tim is a man of flaws as well as virtues, and a fuller picture would have helped humanize him a great deal. i support Tim and his actions, but viewers are left with very little motivation to join in with the cause.

it was also troubling that the cast of the movie were all white. it causes climate change activism to be yet another elitist/liberal pipe dream. interviewing anarchists, native peoples, exploring what's happening in other continents, would have helped this film a good deal.",1378425600,,736,4.75
5719039,4,B00CEJ1JB4,"A well documented presentation of someone acting on conscience, intelligence and courage (or foolishness) to act unselfishly (if only we could ingrain this in politicians, CEOs) to protect for all and the future a part of America.

5719041,5,B00CEJ1JB4,"This is another fine documentary in the ""Environment"" series of DVDs from First Run Pictures. It's been a film festival favorite and I can see why. It's the story of one man - environmental activist Tim DeChristopher - who tries to save some pristine Utah wilderness from having the mining industry (with the Federal government's help) ruin our natural resource. De Christopher spent 21 months in prison for his efforts but he got publicity for the issue at hand and this film should do even more. At just 73 minutes in length, it is not drawn out and Directors George and Beth Gage keep the pacing so it will hold your interest. (DeChristopher's engaging personality helps too!). With a music background by Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros and appearances by such A-list personalities as Robert Redford, it will also draw in more people.

The DVD is packaged in a environmentally-friendly recycled cardboard package and the sole bonus is a 12 minute ""conversation with"" DeChristopher filmed at a screening of the film in Utah after his release from prison.
Highly recommended. It will show you how just one man can bring awareness to an important issue by doing something different - in this case outbidding the ""big guys"" at a land auction.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8580926,5,B00CEJ1JB4,"A good presentation of the issues involving abuse of leases of public lands for oil and gas and , really, mining generally, under the G.W. Bush administration, and the fact that even Obama would not drop the charges even though the leases were cancelled.  Tim DeChristopher is a hero and a leader of the next generation of environmental activists. I saw John Lewis on The Daily Show today, and he mentioned that back in Selma and now it was important for young people to ""make trouble in a good way"" and this film documents a good example of that. http://www.peacefuluprising.org/  is introduced in this video as well.

8580928,5,B00CEJ1JB4,"I just discovered this movie.  I showed it to my high school students as part of our climate change unit.  It is an excellent discussion starter: would you sacrifice 21 months of your life, pay a large fine, and have to check the felon box whenever you apply for a job to support a cause you believe is really important?  Whether my students agreed with his choice or not, we all could agree that his choice took guts.  It certainly made my students think.  I did cut out some of the middle which gives an overview of climate change issues, only because we had already watched the miniseries, The Years of Living Dangerously.  But I certainly did enjoy the entire film.  An important part of its charm is that you watch an intelligent, but otherwise average guy, Tim DeChristopher, transform into a real leader, an agent of change.  Cameras followed him on and off for several years, yet he always stayed true to himself.  He was very open and unabashed.  I will probably make time to show the entire film in the future.  Yea Tim!

I could not give it a five star rating as I am in the mood to rate according to Robert Reich's ''Inequality for All'' one of the best I have seen in a while.  I would suggest Bidder 70 for any serious activist or environmentalist.  If you care to observe history, check out ''Hit and Stay'' too.
