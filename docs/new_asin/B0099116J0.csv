Short and Sweet... if you enjoyed the book I think you will like this movie.",1352678400,6,196,4.157894736842105
5278117,1,B0099116J0,After reading the book and loving it I was looking forward to the miniseries. It isn't even close to the book and was very disappointed. It you have read the book don't waste your money.,1352678400,17,186,4.3428571428571425
5278118,1,B0099116J0,"I just finished reading the book and am watching the miniseries.  Other than the names of the character's I wouldn't recognize this production as telling the same story.

Character's from the book killed of as traitors in the first hour.

Edmund condemned to death and saved by a bribe to have his legs broken?
Caris marriage to Elfric?
Sir Thomas/ Brother Thomas character being a completely different person.

The whole vendeta of Queen Elizabeth against Kingsbridge.

I understand artistic license, but this is over the top!",1352592000,11,527,5.0813953488372094
5278119,5,B0099116J0,LOVED IT on Reelz....had to pre-order on Amazon....it's epic...it's huge....acting is exquisite and beautifully done! Will make a great holiday gift !!,1352592000,5,151,5.909090909090909
5278120,2,B0099116J0,"As with many who have read Ken Follett's ""World Without End"", I was dismayed to see so many rather...ummm...expansive liberties taken with the story. I like Follett's books for the most part. They read rather like soap operas at times, alternating between long descriptive segments and (sometimes overly) dramatic scenes. The last thing they need is ramping up the melodrama. We watched the entire miniseries in one go, scratched our heads a lot, (hey...why is he not dead? Hey...that never happened...hey!) and ended up rolling our eyes mightily. What they did with Godwin's character was just appalling. The dramatic scenes were so unrelenting and overdone that we started chuckling and saying things like ""Well, THAT was uplifting!"". Not a good sign.

I gave this 2 stars for the costumes, the scenery, and the really cool horses (especially Ralph's Friesian--another departure from good ol' reliable ""Griff the Hunter""). The screenwriters would have been far better off conforming to the original story. At least then there might have been a moment or two of subtlety.

If I were Ken Follett, I'd be annoyed.",1352592000,20,1112,5.138121546961326
5278121,1,B0099116J0,"I wish they would have a zero star so I could give it to this series. The book it self is wonderful but I don't know what the writer and the director of this serie were thinking. It has nothing to do with the book and it changes the everything. One example is Gwenda's son, David, he never died of the plague and what about Petronilla, what is she doing alive surviving of the plague. Hope that Ken Follett is not watching this, I would be insulted if I was the writer. Well, if you really want to have a good experience I would recommend the book, that's just my humble opinion.",1352505600,6,579,4.178571428571429

5278143,4,B0099116J0,"The discs come in a plastic snap cases. The discs play fine.

This series is good, better than Camelot. If you like this sort of stuff I recommend The Tudors, which is excellent. And The Pillars of the Earth is very good. Reign is okay too. Two current series that are very good are The Vikings and The Last Kingdom.

If the above don't sound interesting you might like a couple of space race shows. I spent a month on a space race binge. First I read Space by James A. Michener. Then I watched two movies, The Right Stuff (1983) and Apollo 13 (1995), and then two great series, From Earth to the Moon (1998) and The Astronauts Wives Club (2015). Theyre a great combination.

If the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,1998,5.173374613003096
5278144,3,B0099116J0,"Way too much left out, including major characters. One gets a sense of the story, but that's about it.",1519948800,,102,4.421052631578948
5278145,5,B0099116J0,"I love this. Of course I love period dramas. I especially like the fact that this one has some unconventional people, including a few healers accused of witchcraft... My favourite storyline is between Wulfric and Gwenda. The way she shows him what love is- she actually helps him with the hard work on the farm and stays at his side even when he is deprived of his land, while his fiance leaves him when his fortunes turn. At that point he realizes Gwenda has always been the one who truly loves him. You don't often see authenticity like this in films. I also happen to think Tom Cullen does a fine job in this- he is so much more vulnerable and emotional than in Knightfall, and shows a good range. I guess I wish I were Gwenda lol.",1517529600,,734,4.326086956521739
5278146,5,B0099116J0,"Another absolutely gripped big historical novel from Follet. Weaving the significant historical events into an entertaining narrative with complex vharacters is his forte. Start with pillars and the world without end, or read on its own. It stands alone well.",1516838400,,259,5.5
5278147,3,B0099116J0,"I loved the book, and also the book and tv series of the Pillars of the Earth. I went into this with very high hopes and to begin with these were justified. This is very well set and well acted. Some of the language was crude, as was the violence and sex, but the sex and violence were in the book (and they were violent times) so up to this point I was okay with this although I agree with another writer on here that the certificate should have been stricter.
However, the plot began to ver off the book as the series progressed. I don't know why they needed a plot change. To begin with, it was not a problema, but the last two episodes were very different, and the last came up with an ending a long way from the reality of the times. (Spoiler alert ahead). I am not a historian but I do read history, and the rebellion in the penultimate episode and the royal response seemed about as realistic as the Tarantino film Inglorious Bastards, The idea that a village of peasants could defy their lord for anything other than a day or two in those times seems unlikely to the point of the absurd. The credits say Ken Follet was involved in the production, and I'd be fascinated to see how he felt about such an odd finale, as the book seemed much more anchored in hstory than this, I'd have given it a 5* without the ending, but the way this finished was very very disappointing.",1516579200,,1378,4.243346007604563

5278150,5,B0099116J0,Great series. Extremely upset that Netflix took this and Arn off of there selection of shows. Big time loss. Thank you for selling for so cheap.,1515024000,,144,4.576923076923077
5278151,4,B0099116J0,"World Without End has good characters, atmosphere, and cinematography.  It gets stronger after the opening episodes.  Cynthia Nixon is the top billed cast member, but her character also takes time coming into its own.  World is an ensemble show rather than one with a few leading characters. There's a little blurring together of the many men of similar age, hair color, build, etc until their characters become established. I read the book long ago and didn't have fresh enough memory of it to serve as a guide. The plus to that is not being as distracted by the liberties Pielmeier's script takes with Follett's book. There's also less nudity and gore here than in Pillars of the Earth -- but it's certainly not a kid-friendly series. The plot lacks the big central theme that the Cathedral gives to Pillars. So call it enjoyable and worth the time, but if you only have time for one, go for Pillars.",1514419200,,902,4.69620253164557

Ken Follet is a brilliant author and hes listed as a consultant in the credits. I don't know how he did it, unless one hand was over his eyes the whole time. This is not the worst adaptation Ive ever seen (that honor would have to go to The Time Travelers Wife), but its awfully close. As a previous reviewer has stated, if you haven't read the book, you might enjoy this. I was unable to make it past the second episode.",1508716800,2,590,4.184210526315789

But also be aware that the falsification of history is presented with hateful bigotry.
Christians are rapists, murderers, anti-science idiots. They want to kill and oppress.
 A cliche from old westerns was the guy in a black hat is a villain.
In this movie, if a character is identified as a Christian, he is about to rape or kill or steal.
  I do not know if this bigotry is in the book. But it pervades this movie.

Kingsbridge Cathedral which plays a central roll in both books and TV series.
In Pillars, Ken explains how the ""rod"" [as of unit of measure like foot and meter]
was used to layout the cathedral floor.
The Pillars mini-series TV show is very well made with high production standards.
TV series follows the book as close as any TV series or movie follows a book.
I suggest reading at least the first 100 pages of Pillars before watching the Pillars TV series.

Now for World Without End, Ken's book is again outstanding and an excellent follow-up to Pillars after 200 years.
But the World Without End TV series was made by another TV production company and does not closely follow the book.
Read World without End completely before watching the World without End TV series.
The first seven TV show segments somewhat follows the book with the same characters.
Segment eight does not in anyway follow the book.
BUT before playing any part of World Without End TV mini-series, watch the ""how it was made"" segment on disk two.  In this segment, Ken explains why the screenplay departs from his book and he approves of the screenplay.

The hair and teeth of the characters - if this is the Middle Ages they must have had actual magic to get their teeth so straight and white and perfect. Not a crumbling, brown or crooked tooth in sight. The women's hair hung long, freshly washed and combed. take a look at medieval manuscripts and tapestries. THEY WORE THEIR HAIR UP, and COVERED by caps and hats and headgear of all sorts!
The plot was unutterably thin and improbable. I cannot emphasise this enough. I mean, bleedingly obvious evil culprits were apparently not noticed and got off scot-free the whole time, while no questions were ever asked about the motivations of 'good' characters who were actually framed. They were conveniently blamed for things they didn't do, to move the story forward.

5278428,1,B0099116J0,"Review of World without End

This is a truly dreadful miniseries. When I saw a knight being pursued by two horsemen firing bolts (arrows) from their small crossbows with machine-gun like speed I thought this miniseries had to be a spoof. I wound the video back and looked at this sequence again. Yes, the relentless pursuers were not reloading their crossbows with bolts before each apparent discharge. They appeared to be just plucking the strings repeatedly as if their crossbows were toys fitted with rubber bands instead of normal strings. They were firing invisible bolts! To confirm the failure of the producers of this miniseries to understand medieval weaponry, we see a 10-12 year old boy pick up an archer's discarded bow and kill a man in mail (metal link) armour  with it. If it had been only a hunting bow instead of an English longbow, the draw weight could be expected to be at least 50 pound weight which would almost certainly be well beyond the strength of a small boy. If a longbow, draw strength would have been at least 80 pounds, and usually much higher. To compound this historical nonsense, we see peasants and townspeople, including women, holding their own with spades, pitchforks, and hoes in pitched fighting against trained soldiers in mail armour and wielding swords.

The historical nonsense continues with Queen Isabella exercising regal power to secure her evil ends when in fact King Edward III had already deprived her of any role in the government of England. She was initially banished when her lover Mortimer was removed from power by Edward, and thereafter, she played no role in the government of England. This miniseries features the Hundred Years War between England and France but at no time do we see Edward III's famous warrior son Edward of Woodstock, known to history as ""The Black Prince"". The Black Prince played a major role in the fighting with the French, including bearing the brunt of the fighting at the famous Battle of Cressy which also goes missing in this miniseries.

For anyone with reasonable knowledge of medieval history, watching this miniseries is likely to be equivalent to having root canal work done by a dentist without anaesthetic. We see King Edward III waging war in Flanders and calling for English ""peasants"" to be conscripted to replenish his army diminished by fighting. This is nonsense. Edward would have needed highly skilled archers and trained men-at-arms, not farmers who had spent their lives digging in their fields and lacked any training in war. Then this bizarre miniseries has us view the ridiculous sight of King Edward III personally visiting places of public execution in England and offering to spare murderers, rapists, thieves, and the like from execution if they will join his army.

Someone might say that despite historical absurdities, this miniseries is redeemed by a marvellous plot and splendid acting. Not so! The producers, director, and scriptwriter have compounded their crimes against history by serving up a soap opera plot with mostly bad acting. It appeared to me that the producers and director sat around a table and decided to make a fanciful medieval miniseries with as much sex and violence they could pack into it. So we have the usual graphic sex scenes. But wait, we are also provided with violent rape of a village maiden, attempted rape of a nun, homosexual activity between monks and nuns, and a bishop masturbating in front of a beautiful woman he has condemned to be burnt as a witch. The graphic masturbation takes place at a time when the beautiful victim is in manacles and held in a prison cell awaiting death.

The villains and their acting are like something out of a horror comic book and about as realistic. When I viewed this nonsense, I felt that anyone involved in producing this miniseries deserved to be tarred and feathered for foisting this pseudo medieval tripe on a paying public.",1424563200,9,3920,4.922844175491679

Last year, I fell in love with The Pillars of the Earth miniseries and was beyond thrilled when I heard that World Without End was also being made into a miniseries.  World Without End was my favorite book between the two: I loved the love story and the inclusion of the black plague.

My husband is also a Follett fan and we watched this series together.  I really enjoyed the World Without End miniseries, and I'm really glad I watched it, but I thought that The Pillars of the Earth miniseries was better.  World Without End strayed too far from the book (why they felt the need to change an already-perfect plot is beyond me) and I did not always agree with the changes that were made.  So much death!  Sex!  Back-stabbing!

I still highly recommend the World Without End miniseries, as it's a great story acted out by an oustanding cast with great acting.  Bottom line: World Without End is my favorite Follett book but The Pillars of the Earth had a better screen adaptation.",1373760000,,1082,4.530927835051546

5278575,2,B0099116J0,"Mr. Follett is so tied up with his Plymouth Brethren childhood that he quite laboriously
twists historical facts to suit their strongly anti-Catholic creed. Edward II was a notorious sodomite who was killed by his wife and Lord Mortimer with a red hot iron shoved
into his rear end. The idea of him being unkilled and becoming a kindly monk (still retaining his sexual proclivities) is preposterous. He just feels it necessary to pile on the Church at every opportunity. Evil abbots, healers killed as witches, yeomen deprived of inheritances and on and on. Very tiresome. Mr. Follett does better when he leaves the Middle Ages and goes to more contemporary venues.",1370995200,2,665,4.946428571428571
5278576,5,B0099116J0,"When a mini-series or regular film is based upon a book source, there are invariably changes that are made in order to take into consideration the difference in mediums. Even THE GODFATHER movie was not exactly like the book; and there is yet to be a movie or mini-series based upon THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII or SHE which remotely resemble their book sources. In the DVD Special Features section, even Ken Follett and more than one actor acknowledged the difference between the two in this case, and no one objected. Certainly Follett has more of a right than anyone. Yet, he emphatically endorsed the screenplay.

Now to the mini-series itself: Cynthia Nixon (of SEX & THE CITY fame), who as Petranilla got top billing was like a cross between Lucretia Borgia, Lady Macbeth, and Lady deWinter - and she played the role deliciously. Her son Godwyn (Rupert Evans - THE PALACE, FINGERSMITH, SONS & LOVERS, HELLBOY, etc.) is a priest whose desire to be Prior and ultimately Bishop leads him down a path of sadistic unbridled palpable evil. His ambition needs no explanation. It is what it is. Those who would like to see all the evil-doers in this story on a pyschiatrist's couch in order to explain their behavior might just as well put half the world on one. While the quote is not precise, it is true enough: ""Abolute power corrupts absolutely."" The tyranny of the Church and that of Imperial power is exposed for what it is/was. Only the Black Death (realistically and emotionally presented to the hilt) was able to derail the iron fisted control of both sacred and secular authority.

Charlotte Riley as Caris, a student of the medical arts, was the key heroin of the film. But, what was more important was the revelation of the Church's fear of this type of ""physician"" and the lengths it would go to in order to suppress it. The general populace, which benefited from this ""new"" medicine, was far more understanding and sympathetic than the powers that be who felt threatened that all of this would supplant the idea of divine intervention and healing. Since many medical ideas came from Islam, they were also branded as the work of the ""infidel"" even by those who were healed or helped by it. Caris is caught between a developing love for a youthful ""builder"" and the predatory incestuous feelings of her own cousin - Godwyn - who harbors his dark secret while branding any woman he can as a ""whore"".

Critics of this mini-series, who keep pounding its book source as though it were the Bible, overlook the magnificent costumes that heralded in a New Age. The difference between what was worn in THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH compared to WORLD WITHOUT END was noted and indicated a fashion change that took place 200 years later. The church of Kingsbridge, now complete and in full Gothic regalia thanks in part to CGE, stood as a potent back drop to the civic activity that took place literally  on its door step. The armour and weaponry was effectively realistic even though some purists might disagree.

In the end what we have, without giving too much away, is an excellent story, superbly acted by a host of gifted and well-known actors, set in the Middle Ages of mid-14th century England and France. Evil exists on all levels, from the lowest peasant to the King himself. It's merely a matter of degree and kind. But, like it or not, it does unfortunately reflect human nature. And I would hardly call proper behavior by some ""goodie two shoes"". There are those who are good and those who are bad. What we see in this mini-series is a slice of Medieval life that lays bare the horror of endless war, plague, rape, incest, ambition run amok, faith, faith denied, class warfare, love of all kinds, overbearing superstition, heroics, revenge - in short, all those things that make up the fabric of humankind in all its incarnations. And is all that really so different than what we have today? In addition to the above named actors, kudos to Miranda Richardson as Mother Cecilia, Peter Firth as Sir Roland, Tim Weston-Jones as Merthin the Builder, Oliver Jackson-Cohen (his brother) as a merciless Everyman Warrior who knows how to play the game, the actor who played Edward III (and is now in DaVinci's Demons), the actress who played his mother Queen Isabella, and the characters Gwenda, Wulfric, and Thomas.

As for any complaint as to how the ""Most Evil"" were dispatched, I can assure the reader of this review that their demise fit all the characters in the most appropriate, satisfying, and ironic way.",1370649600,,4510,4.724269377382465
5278577,3,B0099116J0,"I read the book and found it too much like Pillars of the Earth to be worth 1200 pages. The movie is also. So, it doesn't feel like a new story, but a rehashing of an old one.

The production values are horrid. The lighting is weird. The fabrics are too modern. Everything looks cheesy and fake.

The writing comes largely from the book, but what is changed is puzzling. Not sure why they made the choices that they did as it doesn't improve the product. The language and delivery also seems modern. There were many times when I thought, ""A middles ages person wouldn't think or speak like that."" The combined effect of writing and acting makes me forget that I am watching a period piece. The period doesn't even enter into it.
The writing also seems jumpy. It's like they skim over character and plot development, then rush to fill it in in the next scene or many minutes later. While you may not notice it if you didn't read the book, you definitely will if you did. It doesn't have the same feel at all. In fact, it doesn't even feel like the same story.

The casting choices are also odd. It was like they said, ""Okay, just imagine that you are casting for a soap opera. Pick THAT person!"" Maybe that is the acting, maybe it's the directing, but either way it makes me strain to sit through it.

As a stand alone piece, I thought it was okay. Not worth however many episodes it ended up being all those hours of viewing. There are much more entertaining ways to spend your time.",1370217600,,1483,4.342960288808665

5278590,2,B0099116J0,"The judgement of a production like this is not whether it reflects the book. Its merits should be seen in whether it succeeds in telling a story or gives insight regarding the period in which it is set. ""World Without End"" has much potential to convey the history of fourteenth century England and its monarch, Edward III. The production sets are great and the acting is solid. Yet the story is quite amateurish, suggesting that few people of that era had true chivalry, Christian character or other kinds of medieval virtue. Most everyone seems to be corrupt in one way or another. The producers reserve sentiments of virtue for those characters who are not religious, but are instead victims of the bigotry, chauvanism, customs and superstitions of that ""dark"" age. I suppose that most viewers have not read enough of the real history of the era to critique this film and question the motives of the writers and producers of this series. The foul language and violent sexual scenes in episode 2 were enough to make me lose interest and decide not to share this historical drama with my family. That is a true shame, since I love learning about history and viewing movies that help transport me to another place and time. This could have been an adventurous journey through medieval England. Instead, it was a walk through the mud of a callous interpreter of historical fiction.",1366848000,3,1379,4.798319327731092
5278591,3,B0099116J0,"I don't think it is mandatory that a movie should mimic the book. There are plenty of examples of movies that took a great deal of liberties from the book and became works of arts on their own.

Having said that, for what is worth, there are only some basic plot elements on the movie adaptation of ""World Without End"" that capture what Ken Follett wrote in the book. For the vast part, it is a different beast. Some characters are so different that the only thing their have in common with their counterparts in the book is their name.

I liked ""The Pillars of the Earth"" more than ""World Without End"". Probably most people did. I also liked that adaptation more than this one. On that one, we had the incredible Ian McShane carrying the whole thing on his shoulders. The supporting cast was very good, that's true, but Ian McShane was shining in the center, while everybody else rotated around him.

""World Without End"" (the book) has a different format. There are a multitude of characters and plots. Nobody is really in command. There are a few villains and probably the same number of heroes. Some of them crossed back and forth. It didn't worked very well in the series. Some stories (like Gwenda's, for example) became almost meaningless. There was no time for character build up either. The inconsistencies got on my nerve. The victims constantly saved the skin of those that wrecked their life, either due to selfishness or good nature, only to be wrecked by them again. Either way, they looked like fools. They gave in too much. That biggest inconsistency of all was the ending. It didn't make any sense to me.

The cast was serviceable. Mostly young and promising actors with a couple of big names here and there.

""World Without End"" is billed as a sequel, so in terms of the principal characters who were not killed off in ""Pillars of the Earth"", I thought I might see new adventures.  So there was a bit of disappointment there.  Maybe I missed something, (it can happen) if so,  my apologies to Mr. Follett.  Nonetheless, it is a great story of the challenges of living in a culture of radical religious fanaticism, challenges met and dealth with, and exceptional examples of a love for human dignity.  The photography, costuming and movie magic is right in line with Ken Follett's ""Pillars of the Earth"".  For those who love period pieces, both Follet stories will not disappoint.  Do however spend the extra coin and get ""Pillars of the Earth"" and ""World Without End"".  You'll be able to appreciate the latter a little more.",1362787200,,941,4.620481927710843

5278616,1,B0099116J0,"An independent, high-spirited girl (check), a shy, artistic boy (check), corrupt clergy, local bullies, a royal conspiracy (check, check, check), Kings and Queens not giving a damn about the lives of the common folk, oh...and finally a significant structure or two that needs to be built against all odds (check and check). I have seen this done before and in a better way. It is called Pillars of the Earth, which also comes with a gorgeous opening sequence while World Without End doesn't - gorgeous or otherwise.

In the show, character development not having been invented until the late 1300's, the good guys are absolutely good without a hint of vice in them while the bad guys are absolutely bad without a shred of decency in them. In fact the bad guys are so bad that their badness descends to the level of cartoon villainy. For example, the mother son duo is just unbelievable to watch. They basically represent Wile E. Coyote while civility, progress and justice stand in for the Road Runner. They almost seem to order their instruments of villainy from the medieval Acme Company and use them one by one to get their ways. Only unlike Wile, ALL of their schemes work perfectly. You see something good happening to the good guys and you think: oh no...here it all comes crashing down, and it does. There are basically three bad guys so by the end you're just watching the show to watch them die horrible deaths. So what happens? Of course they meet the most uninspired and mundane ends possible.

After watching Pillars of the Earth I read the book and loved it. So I was planning to do the same here but after watching the show I decided not to. However, I read the plot summary and it differs hugely from the miniseries. The book was basically ripped apart, parts removed, parts added, stepped on and dragged through the mud. The sad thing is Ken Follet served as a consultant for the show and according to him the book and the miniseries are two different things - so it's OK that they are different.

So not to miss anything and also to go back to check out what I might have missed,  I purchased both the paperback and the DVD. .Historical books are always difficult. Ken Follett had his hands full between writing the novel and then watching his novel adapted to film.  You cant put everything on the screen, some scenes/characters have to be sacrificed, story lines eliminated or changed completely due to the restraints of production costs.  The so called purests complain on the reviews, it is not fair losing 'stars'. But I do respect their opinions.  I would truly recommend 'World Without End' .  If you see the DVD , British actor Tom Weston-Jones plays the love interest Merthin ( also is the Detective on BBC production ""Copper""). Character goes from innocent youth to the adult architect trying to rebuild Kingsbridge ( the mythical town in medieval England). You read the book, you can imagine exactly how he would react to his circumstances . Spoiler alert : easy on the eyes ladies ! Ben Chaplin, a gifted actor was perfect for the knight turned monk.  Again too when you read the book, this character comes to life also.  I do not apologize for really enjoying Follett's masterpiece.

I became a big fan when I was first introduced to ""The Eye of the Needle"", which eventially was made into a movie, starring Donald Sutherland, neither the book or the movie disappointed me.  When I read the  ""Pillars of the Earth"", I knew then it would have to be made into a movie or mini-series, (again, with Donald Sutherland) and it stayed true to form and  it followed the book.  However, even though I rated ""World without End"" with 5 stars I was a little disappointed that it did not follow the book and a lot was taken away from the story.  On the plus side, the acting was fantastic and I will watch it again, I'm sure.  I recommend the movie be watched before reading the book, this will take away any disappointments.  Any fans that like time piece movies, Braveheart, Gladiator, Keys to the Kingdom will love this movie.  Yes, I did love this movie.",1359331200,,1005,4.354838709677419

5278630,2,B0099116J0,"I have not read the book version of this movie, so I cannot compare it to that, but having seen and later read Pillars of the Earth, I see many similarities. It's less a sequel of any sort than it is a rehash of ideas from the previous story, with a some of the story lines switched around between characters.

For example, Elfric's character and storyline in this tale are so much like Alfred's in ""Pillars"" it's ridiculous, and even the name change isn't much of a stretch. One character's earldom is wrongfully taken from him and given to another, followed by one of his offspring's determination to get it back, although it takes many years. The main couple in the story have to separate for a number of years, with the man going to Europe where he perfects his craft, just like Aliena and Jack in ""Pillars."" And more of the same with other characters is found throughout the storyline.

Visually, I enjoyed it, and some of the casting was very good. Cynthia Nixon did a great job, and I liked the actor who played Edward III very much.

On a sidenote, there's excessive use of the ""F"" word, which is needless, as well as being historically inaccurate, since that word isn't believed to have been in use for at least another century, according to language experts.

I don't think ""The World Without End"" really offers anything new beyond that of TPotE. It seems he has just rehashed the same old story.

It got to the point that we were exasperated with it and began predicting what horrible event would happen next.  The bad guys are so over-the-top evil that it becomes laughable.  The only thing you can take away from this is that being a peasant in England during the 1300s completely sucked, and there was no joy to be had anywhere for anyone.

I absolutely loved The Pillars of the Earth, both the book and the miniseries, and I enjoyed the book version of World Without End. Now, I must say I didn't hate this show, but I didn't love it the way that I loved POTE. I am a history nut, I write historical fiction, and for that reason I have always had tremendous respect for Ken Follett and other historical writers, because so much goes into the re-creation of the past. POTE had a few historical inaccuracies, one of the big ones was rosaries weren't brought into Catholicism until 1206 A.D. by St. Dominic, but you always have to give a bit of artistic leeway to allow the flow of the story for one reason or another. Other than that, the historical accuracy was obviously taken into account for the most realistic experience. When it came to World Without End, I felt these inaccuracies were just glazed over, kind of like someone was thinking ""they won't notice,"" or God forbid, ""they won't care."" I mean, come on now! They said the plague, which by the way, they went to great lengths to make sure they never called it the black death, since this was a term invented centuries later, however, they got the year wrong! They I said it hit England 1341. England and the Scandinavian countries were the last to be hit, and the plague crept up on English soil no sooner than 1348 (historians disagree on exactly when and by which route England fell victim to the pestilence). A seven year difference? By this point, it was still slowly making its way across the Asian Steppe, not even touching Europe until it hit Sicily in 1347. Now for the characters. So stereotypical and one-dimensional. I mean you've got your covetous, vain prior, his overbearing mother, the strong woman who is the tomboy type and makes everyone uncomfortable with her ""strength"", the perfect heroine who can seem to do no wrong, her lover, who although professes his love for her is constantly in the company of other women, including one he marries and has a child with, the monk who is really not who he seems to be, the evil foreign queen, the weak mama's boy king, blah blah blah...you get the idea. I can't understand for the life of me why they didn't use Starz to produce this miniseries instead of reelz. Who has ever heard of Reelz? Until this event, Reelz was just some channel I passed over on my way to better channels. And all the banner ads at the bottom of the screen just take you right out of the experience. The production quality of POTE was exquisite. WWE, not so much. I thought it to be a bit grainy. And this is perhaps just me, but the girl who played Caris just irritated me to no end. All in all, not terrible, but in no way a worthy successor to epic POTE. I do plan to see it on DVD, not sure if I'll buy it, might just rent it, just to see if it keeps my attention better without all those damn ads on the screen! If there is any talk of doing another miniseries based on the books of Ken Follett, do it on Starz, Shotime, or HBO. Don't leave us all so confused and disappointed.

UPDATE AUGUST 31, 2014
--------------------------------------------
I recently rewatched this miniseries on Netflix and think it was much better the second time around. Without all the commercial interruptions, constant pop-ups from Reelz, nicely done HD, and added material that didn't make the cable network cut, the story seemed to have a much better flow. The fact that it was also broken up into eight one hour installments instead of four two hour installments made it much easier to leave off and pick it back up at another time. Overall, the production seemed to bare only the most basic resemblance to what was aired on Reelz. There was cussing, nudity, and sexual content that wasn't in the edited tv version. Personally, it didn't bother me but I know it can be a deal breaker for many. There are still many of my original complaints from my original review, the biggest being the dates that were so very wrong. The story begins in 1327 and the miniseries dates the plague as hitting England in 1341, 7 1/2 - 8 years too early. I guess they didn't think anyone was going to buy the idea that a group of people (who had been given only the most minimal signs of aging. You know, a couple gray hairs and maybe a few crow's feet) had aged twenty years since the story's beginning in 1327 to the plague's arrival in 1347. But all in all I feel I can add another half star, and in some areas a full star for the DVD/Blu-Ray HD version because the extra material made the story feel less disjointed. The costumes (especially Isabella's wardrobe) were pretty great. So, I'm going to be generous and round up my rating from 3 to 4 stars.",1353715200,6,4780,4.469107551487414

5278664,1,B0099116J0,"I watched the miniseries on TV.  I must admit that I gave up on it most of the way through the first episode.  But, there's a reason I did.

Others have pointed out the characters are either ""saintly or thoroughly despicable"".  I believe the scriptwriter did that because the good guys are transplants of what they imagine to be modern sensibilities and values, to act as straightmen and women to the primitive backwardness of the period.  Basically this miniseries exist as modern ego stroking to assure bigots that we're better than people were back then.

It also doesn't help that they fall into the trap of believing that drama comes from moral polarization, with well defined good and bad.  The problem there is the bad guys are made cartoonishly evil, without well defined characters or motivation.

Altogether it would have been better if more respect was given to the period and its people, especially since one can expect the audience to largely be people who have an interest in history and medieval life.",1353283200,9,1016,4.832369942196531
5278665,3,B0099116J0,"I have read both Pillars of the Earth (twice) and World Without End by Ken Follett. Loved both books - the sweeping saga and unforgettable characters are fabulous.  I checked out Pillars (the video series) from our library and watched it straight through - I found that series almost flawless in its attention to detail and how it followed the book so well. Very little was left out, so that even if the viewer did not read the book,  the video ""stood alone"" on its own merits.

Not so much so for World Without End.  Much was true to the book - as far as it went - yet there were major discrepancies and departures from the original book. The worst part for me was that so much of the book was just left out - all the last part of the book was gone. I kept waiting for an announcement for ""Season II"" -- but I don't think one is planned.

Some good things:  the acting was superb, just wonderful. Rupert Evans portrayed the nastiest prior one could imagine, matched only by his horrible mother, Petranilla, played by Cynthia Nixon. I thought Gwenda and Wulfric were also brought to life by the excellent performances of Nora von Waldstatten and Tom Cullen. The settings were very realistic, creating a  very believable 14th century setting through the costumes, landscape, battles, castles, market places and so forth.  I was particularly drawn to the struggle between enlightened women who were trying to  find better ways to heal the sick - while the clergy were doing all they could to accuse these same women of witchcraft.  Bottom line, I really enjoyed the videos of World Without End, but wish there had been more. Wish all the book had been covered!",1353110400,3,1658,4.570945945945946
5278666,2,B0099116J0,"I am a huge Ken Follett fan and would probably consider ""Pillars of the Earth"" my favorite book of all time.  Loved ""World Without End"" almost just as much.  I thought the Pillars TV adaptation was fantastic and did the book justice.  When I heard that WWE was getting adapted, I was thoroughly excited.

Sadly, my first clue should have been that this series did not air on Starz as Pillars did, with Starz's budget.  It aired here in the U.S. on the Reelz Channel and looked every bit as cheap and low budget as you would think.  Production values aside, the book was just horribly adapted.  I always expect some liberties to be taken when translating a novel from words to film, but the amount of liberties taken here were absolutely ridiculous.  Entire plots and entire characters were changed, minimized, or disappeared altogether.

Having accepted the fact that things were going to be changed, I tried to rewatch the series and tell myself to consider it as a standalone show.  Unfortunately, I found it to be extremely lacking.  Faithful readers of Ken Follett know that one of his greatest strengths is his rich and vivid characters.  The characters in the WWE TV adaptation are horribly developed.  Tom Weston-Jones' Merthin is supposed to be the lead male character, and we hardly know anything about him, other than the fact that he has this curious undying love for Caris and that he moved away to Italy.  And just exactly why does he love Caris?  From watching this show, it seems to me that it's because she's about the only female in town that's around his age.  The character of Gwenda was probably my favorite character in the book and it's hard to understand why we are supposed to care about her at all, since the adaptation portrays her as this resentful immigrant woman from some outskirt village, as opposed to the book, where she was a character whose life was inescapably interwined with the other three Kingsbridge youths who grew up together.  The villains are too one note and cartoonish.  Other characters like Phillippa and Sister Elizabeth Clerk barely get any development at all.

The plots are uneven and at times I found the show to be utterly boring.  It was a chore and after sitting through it, I was disappointed in myself and wanted those 8 hours of my life back.

It's really too bad that Starz opted not to produce this series, because I think it could have been every bit as successful as their other hits like Pillars and Spartacus.  I will hesitate before watching any show on Reelz Network again.",1353024000,95,2541,4.688487584650113

8537860,1,B0099116J0,"I am stunned that Ken Follett allowed this TV Mini Series to go ahead. To give credit, the series does follow the story line but where it falls off the cliff in a big way is the characterization. The good guys are just too good to be true but the villains, well. These are so bad that they remind me of the villains in a Dudley Do Right  comic strip.  I mean Oil Can Harry tying the heroine to the railway tracks in the old time westerns are far more believable than the baddies in this flick.  Any Marx Brothers movie has more believable villains than this awful travesty. Perhaps Mr Follett should not have given approval to John Pielmeier's script until this gross caricature  was corrected.
Perhaps in time someone will prepare a new script and then this book can be  filmed again so that it can stand side by side with the Pillars of the Earth,.",1526428800,,850,4.3544303797468356
