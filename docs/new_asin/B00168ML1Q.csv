8398250,5,B00168ML1Q,"This show is well made, well cast, and well acted. It has action and mystery. It's different than all the standard TV dramas: not based on cops, lawyers or doctors. Well, it has a bit of all of that, but they are characters, not plot basis.

Since it was different and good, of course, it got cancelled. This is the show that was brought back for a short second season by fan reaction: based on a line at the end of the first season, ""Nuts!"", the producers were flooded by fans sending peanuts to them. They got the idea, at least a bit, and brought it back to help give it some ending (though it was left not tied together, but ready to go on, if they ever decide to do a followup TV movie, as unlikely as that may be.)

Still, it's worth it if you like the actors, or are interested in a different look at post nuclear possibilities.

We'll see how they price this. It should be reasonable, as it's a purchase set, not something you'd just rent for a single viewing. Be interesting to see some behind the scenes info, and a blooper reel. I don't see any extras included, but then it's not out yet.

Sci Fi/Post Nuc/Character based drama lovers should like this one",1326585600,8,1166,4.286363636363636

I am a huge fan of the show, have the complete series on DVD(thanks Amazon) and I encourage anyone who likes ""what could really happen"" shows to check it out.",1266364800,19,270,4.42
