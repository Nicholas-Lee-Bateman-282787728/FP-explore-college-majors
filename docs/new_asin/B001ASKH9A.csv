8279454,4,B001ASKH9A,"I first heard of Stan Lassiter years ago in an old Guitar Player magazine column called ""Yogic Hands"" or something similar. It outlined a musical chord sequence designed to stretch your hands and increase flexibility. It was a very hip little exercise that I still occasionally use variations of today. Once I became Internet savvy I tried to find out more info on him and hear some of his music. While he is not well-known outside of Nashville, he teaches and performs regularly there. Don't let his lack of fame fool you. This a very well put together DVD and he teaches in a personable laid-back manner. He discusses several techniques and performs a tune focusing on each one. The band performances are cool and have more of a real gig feel than an instructional/academic vibe. I have to give it 4 stars because more of it should have been tabbed out or notated but he explains most of in enough depth. He has his own unique notational/chord diagram system and way of viewing the neck that takes a little getting used to but it doesn't really detract too much. Even so, there could have been more written examples using his system. I think this may have more to do with Mel Bay than Mr. Lassiter. Don't let this keep you from buying this DVD though. As I said, he provides enough detail and describes things thoroughly. He has a very cool contrapuntal/solo guitar technique that I wish he had been able to elaborate on but maybe that will be the subject of another DVD. All in all, Highly Recommended!",1356825600,,1505,4.5777777777777775
