4886545,5,B005SQRYBO,"My son loves veggie tales, I love them because they're kid friendly and teach him important lessons he should know. Like to be kind, share, not to lie, and numerous other important lessons in life, but his favorite by far is the ""God Loves you very much"". He watches it over and over, so when his first copy snapped in half it was easy to replace with Amazon.",1332288000,,359,4.294117647058823
4886546,5,B005SQRYBO,"I am a mom of a 5 year old and a 1,5 year old and we all watch those stories over and over....love them. Just one thing the 2-nd story ""chocolate factory"" has been repeated from other tales I wish there was something new in that place. Still love that DVD",1331769600,,255,4.019607843137255
4886547,5,B005SQRYBO,"This is my 2nd DVD review and boy oh boy, we have been playing this DVD EVERYDAY! To be honest, prior to getting this DVD for review, we have never watch Veggie Tales before. Sure, I've seen them being sold at my church's book store but we never thought of getting it. Anyway, here is my review:

I loved the storyline of each stories featured in this DVD and the lessons to be learned on how we should not despair when bad things happened to us as God can turned it around to make good things out of bad incidents, how we should trust God when He chose us to do something and how we should be steadfast and believed in the things we stand up for.

At the end of the 3 featured stories, there is a short bloopers of the intro which Ben loves to watch over and over and over again! I loved seeing him laugh at the bloopers.

Now, I would definitely play this DVD again (and again and again...) as it also has bonus features such as extra sing-along songs, how to draw tutorials and an interactive book.

Overall, I give this DVD a 10 out of 10. (yep, we love it!)",1329177600,2,1062,4.115942028985507
4886548,4,B005SQRYBO,"The description is incorrect. What is really on this disk or the stories ""The Ballad of Little Joe"", ""Gideon: Tuba Warrior"" and ""Rack Shack and Benny"". It was bummer for us since we want ""Sweet Pea"" but we are still glad to have ""Gideon"" and having our daughters favorites on one disk will mean less to take when we travel.",1328400000,4,323,4.4

4886554,5,B005SQRYBO,My three & 1.5 year old absolutely love this movie. Great Christian messages and songs that are cute and stick in your head for days. The newer veggie tales have lost the religious content (i.e. Pirates that don't do anything) but this movie is right what I was looking for. I would definitely buy again!,1466640000,,304,4.545454545454546

4886564,2,B005SQRYBO,bought several of the Veggie Tales DVD's - am not happy with them at all.  they are too long - some were 45 minutes long.  also the story from the bible often times does not coincide with the story on the DVD. I won't be buying anymore.,1444608000,,236,4.0

4886567,5,B005SQRYBO,"My 4 year old son got his as a gift from his godparents. This DVD includes 3 classic shows which shows us how God loves us no matter what.

They include:
-Rack, Shack, and Benny: Nebby K. Nezzer is the president of the chocolate factory and announces that his workers may eat as many bunnies as they would like but Rack, Shack, and Benny remember their parents taught them not to eat too much candy. Can the boys do what's right even when all their friends are doing something else? They learn God loves them very much and will never leave them.

-Gideon: Tuba Warrior: Gideon (Larry) is carefully chosen to defend his people against an undefeated 30,000 veggie army of pickles. But when Gideon's army is reduced to 6 carrots and 6 peas, will he be able to overcome this giant army? Based on the Bible story, this story teaches kids a lesson about trusting God.

-The Ballad of Little Joe: Little Joe (Larry) and his cowboy French peas brothers go on an adventure that takes them from an abandoned mineshaft to Dodge Ball City and Little Joe's faith is tested all along the way. He realizes God's love when he discovers God has a plan for him just like He does for the rest of us.",1420502400,,1180,4.4036697247706424

8485358,2,B005SQRYBO,I do not like this DVD and won't be buying anymore VeggieTales DVDs. My 2.5-year-old son did not show hardly any interest in the movie. The movie tells it's own version of Bible stories but they are only vaguely similar to the actual stories in the Bible. It was hard to discern the main point of each episode as well.,1524268800,,318,4.316666666666666
