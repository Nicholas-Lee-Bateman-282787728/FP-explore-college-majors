7952789,5,B00005RYM7,"The cover art says it all - music and eroticism.  Those who enjoy classical music and also enjoy the beauty of love will find this a rare treat.  The cello music and its performance is excellent.  The cello, being one of the instruments that requires the most sensitive touch, is an inspired choice for blending the full spectrum of sound with sensuous love.  The cinematography and direction is first rate.",1127952000,,407,4.771428571428571

Frances is a cellist, playing for weddings and such, but mostly playing for tips as a street musician. Ivan is, or was a world-class pianist, but spent the last five years in a wine-soaked daze. She was blinded in an accident, and he's spiritually blinded to everything but his debauched parties and occasional prostitutes. They come together, in a contact that fuses their music with their physical passions.

The plot works itself out smoothly, but that's really not the point of this moive. The point is Frances' emerging sexuality. It first appears in her solitude, expressed in her music. It expands voyeuristically as France listens in on her room-mate's trysts, and blossoms under Ivan's guidance. The erotic scenes are consensual and exciting, peopled with very handsome male and female figures. Frances (Lucy Jenner) may be the most enticing figure: very slender, and so unusually slim of bust that she catches the eye again and again.

The characters and plot wouldn't stand up under close analysis, but were never meant to. This is an erotic movie before anything else, and very enjoyable within its kind.

7952791,2,B00005RYM7,"Man, this movie was boring. Here's the plot (try not to get too excited now). There's this blind woman. She plays the cello on the beach. She gets hired by this ugly Russian guy to help him perform his newest concerto. He's been sitting around getting drunk since his wife died. She can't play very well so he helps her get better by having sex with prostitutes. This makes her go sleep with her roommate's boyfriend. Then he makes her have sex in front of all these people with masks. But he leaves the room before she's finished. This makes her mad, so she goes and gets eye surgery and she can see again. Then she and ugly Russian guy perform his concerto and then they have sex.

Not even the sex scenes can redeem this movie. I'm not even sure how many of them there were since they were filmed so ""artsy"" that half the time, I couldn't figure out if I was even watching sex. And the ones that were clearly sex scenes weren't very memorable.

I can't recommend this one at all.",1102896000,,982,4.302702702702702
7952792,4,B00005RYM7,"This is a great movie to view with a partner.  It goes deep within the soul of a blind person where passion and life are expored in a most erotic way.
Great music and wonderfully erotic sex titilate the senses.  They brought me into their world.
I rented it, now I am buying it.",989107200,,278,4.12962962962963
