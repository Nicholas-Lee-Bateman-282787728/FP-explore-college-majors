8012393,4,B0001GSPOG,I wanted to give this dvd 5 stars just for the fact William Oribello is excellent! But what happened to the rest of the lecture? He states  there will be a break and will come back to discuss psychic self defense. I even flipped the disc over thinking it may continue on the other side? It is definitely an incomplete program!  We should all get half our money back!,1284508800,2,366,4.2898550724637685
8012394,5,B0001GSPOG,"There is a lot of good information presented in this, about meditation, soul mates, steps to make one's life better.  But the subject of psychic self defense is never addressed.  In the last part of the DVD, William Oribello clearly states that he intends to talk about psychic self defense and psychic attack, but he continues discussing other things and never gets around to this topic.  And then right before this DVD ends, he says he is out of time but that he has 3 pages of information on psychic self defense and will send it out to everyone in the audience!  So clearly the topic of psychic self defense was never even addressed in this video!!  Why has the company Inner Light who produced this DVD titled this video with a subject that was never even addressed?  Just because it was intended to be discussed? It should have been titled 'the importance of meditation and steps to improve your life'.  While the other information that William discussed in it is very good and appreciated, it was very disappointing to have the DVD end right after William says he has run out of time and will send the info about psychic attack to members of the audience!",1203206400,10,1162,4.584541062801932
8012395,5,B0001GSPOG,"The late William Alexander Oribello was an extremely learned practitioner of many forms of metaphysical and spiritual knowledge. The lessons he both learned and taught over his lifetime would fill many books and DVDs, but we are privileged to have here, in ""Five Easy Steps To Psychic Self-Defense,"" one of his most brilliant lectures on the possibility for transformation of the individual from an unhappy, spiritually depressed victim into a contented, well-rounded and whole person.
The metaphor for that transformation, Oribello explains, is that of the medieval alchemist, the early scientists who strove to turn lead into gold. So is our life an attempt to convert the base metal of negativity into the fine gold of spiritual perfection. What we perceive as an unattainable miracle can actually come to pass if we approach it with the right emotional attitude and with sufficient faith in the idea of positive change.
The energy that animates the universe around us is also a cosmic intelligence, a cosmic power that one can learn to harness to one's own benefit. The Creator above knows our needs, our everyday longings, and he wishes for us to have health, happiness, and prosperity. The secret lies in channeling that energy from God into things we can see and touch in the here and now. We must also be on guard against the negative energy we ourselves create. Even mere thoughts have a great deal of power to impact on the physical world, Oribello cautions, and like attracts like, so our fearful thoughts, for instance, draw even more fear into our lives.
What Oribello is teaching here seems to be a healthy form of mental discipline that should be helpful to anybody, whether they believe in occult powers or not. Instead of instructing us to look outside ourselves for guidance, we learn instead to develop more of a sense of personal responsibility for what happens to us, to understand the energies put into play by our own choices and the attitude we take toward the outside world.
And what are the five easy steps? Perhaps that should be left to the individual viewers of this DVD to learn and assimilate at their own pace. But they consist primarily of an honest assessment of one's self and one's true desires, as well as the conscious will to convert negative qualities and actions into positive ones. We must seek inspiration from the higher powers, but we must also develop our own plans of action to attain what we want. As Oribello says, ""God helps those who help themselves."" Very little will come to us if we simply sit back and wait for God to present it on a silver platter.
There are some touching moments on the DVD when Oribello hugs and kisses some of the students gathered in his native Philadelphia to hear his lecture. We can see that, separate from his impressive knowledge of occult lore, there is also a person of genuine warmth and grace, a teacher who loves his listeners with the kind of tender compassion that infuses them with the ability to find the necessary strength within themselves to make the kind of positive changes in their lives that can endure forever.
To master the unconscious mind, to truly take control of our innermost selves and free ourselves from the pain and confusion of our daily struggles, what better gift could we be given? That is precisely the gift that Oribello offers here, if we can only summon the wisdom to receive it.",1083801600,18,3396,4.787052810902896
