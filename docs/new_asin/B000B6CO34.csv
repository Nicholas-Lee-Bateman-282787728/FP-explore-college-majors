2402888,5,B000B6CO34,"For my money, this movie should become a Christmas classic.  Terrific performances from Brenda Blethyn and Kevin Polack.  Christopher Plummer is perfect as Santa Claus, and Zoe Warner is a major find. For his first feature film, LeVar Burton has delivered a real gem.  A great movie to watch with the whole family.",1131408000,22,314,4.886792452830188

2402943,5,B000B6CO34,"I love a really good Story movie, and Blizzard is one I will treasure forever, All the Actors played their parts so well, Christopher Plummer was a most wonderful and understanding Santa. Whoopi Goldberg really made Blizzard come alive. In that You could really Believe that, that real reindeer could really talk,  The young ladies who played Jess and Katie were very much like girls I grew up with. They took me back to my own childhood good and bad. But Brenda Blethyn  as Aunt Millie made me want to be her niece. She kept us all captivated telling about the friendship between Katie and Blizzard.",1421712000,,600,4.650943396226415

2402950,5,B000B6CO34,"This is one of the best Christmas movies for kids I've ever seen.  It's family-friendly and revolves around main characters who are mostly kids.  I am surprised that more people don't seem to like it, though I will admit that it is one of those that grew on me over time.
  In many ways it's an epic movie; in everything but length it shows character and strength.  This is no cheap film put together on a shoestring; the special effects, the scenery, and the sound are all excellent.  It's neither easy nor cheap to create flying, talking reindeer and the animatronic reindeer certainly looked good to me.  I also found it very easy to fall in love with the many scenes at the North Pole.
  And it's a complex tale with several stories being told.  It begins with a young girl who is upset when her best friend moves away, so much so that her parents invite her Aunt Millie to visit for the holidays to cheer her up.  She tells her a story of another young girl who had had a difficult time of things when forced to move when her father lost his job.  All of this is tied in with a story of a young female reindeer (Blizzard), one of Santa's finest and a reindeer that should be an up-and-comer.  This story is about how this girl's life is changed by Blizzard.
  The movie shows courage, the power of friendship and loyalty, and some very nice figure skating in the bargain as the story unfolds.  There are some very nice performances from the actors -- Santa has some funny lines and some very wise lines.
  There are actually too few children's Christmas stories when I think about it.  I've seen a lot of Christmas movies, most of them are romances and I've seen a lot of those and many are very good; but it's always nice to see another one aimed at kids come along and this one is one of the best.  It puzzles me that it hasn't had more support but then, it's not the only sleeper in the history of the movies.  Many of the older Christmas movies were forgotten for a long time, It's a Wonderful Life probably being the best example (but The Bishop's Wife and Remember the Night also come to mind in Christmas movies).
  This one is an excellent movie and one that I like more every time I see it.",1417305600,,2204,4.309002433090025

2402994,5,B000B6CO34,"As an educator I can honestly say that my students throughly enjoyed discussing kindness, friendship, honesty,and trustworthlness as some of our Character Traits within the curriculum within my school district. After watching ""Blizzard"" my students were able to have a visual of our discussion and apply it towards themselves and share their opinions during open discusss after viewing the movie.

I would recommend ""Blizzard"" to all and keep in mind that the movie can be watched at any given time; It is not a movie just for the Christmas Holidays.
Be Blessed!!!!",1326153600,2,565,5.141304347826087
2402995,5,B000B6CO34,Remarkably good in every sense of the word. The implicit as well as explicit innocence of the movie is overwhelming. The story injected just enough reality to classify it as truely human in essence.,1324339200,,198,4.852941176470588
2402996,3,B000B6CO34,"This is a cute holiday movie.  I think families with younger children (ages 4-14)
will enjoy it most.  Worth adding to your favorite holiday collection.",1319846400,2,152,5.04
2402997,5,B000B6CO34,There are SO few good movies that very young children can watch.  This is one of them.  It's an absolute 'must have' for the holiday season.,1297814400,,140,4.346153846153846
2402998,5,B000B6CO34,"It's a beautiful, heartfelt story about friendship. It makes me cry every time I watch it, but I have to see it at least twice every Christmas season! Anyone who has experienced loss and loves animals too will be touched by this story.",1295913600,,235,4.488372093023256
2402999,5,B000B6CO34,"I just found this movie and what a great surprise it was. This is a lovely, special holiday movie that offers so much for young girls and women, as well as gives boys and men insight into a girl's journey. The movie has magical scenes, wonderful acting, and a great story. I didn't know what to expect but this was much better than I'd hoped for. I don't want to talk about the movie because it is full of nice surprises that should be experienced instead of expected. This really is a fine movie and suitable for any audience. I had never heard about this movie and I wonder why. It has all the elements of a great modern movie yet will certainly remain a classic over time. Well worth purchasing, especially to share with daughters, nieces, sisters, or granddaughters.",1290729600,2,770,4.507142857142857
2403000,5,B000B6CO34,"This is a fantastic Christmas movie for young girls who still believe in Santa. I am going to give you a bit of a PLOT SPOILER review since I suspect parents do the buying. Jessie is sadden by her best friend Bobby moving away. She is moping and crying. The parents decide to bring in Aunt Millie to help. She arrives the day before Christmas and is dressed like the eccentric aunt in ""Bewitched."" To make Jessie feel better, she tells her about a story of a girl named Katie. Katie loved to skate and was taught by an Olympic gold medalist. She was his only pupil. When the mill closes down, Katie's family moves to the city where she is tormented by a gang of girls who also skate. Meanwhile at the North Pole a magical Reindeer is born who sounds a bit like Whoopie Goldberg. As a magical Reindeer, Blizzard seeks out Katie, whose sadness she feels in her heart. She helps Katie through this difficult time and gives her the courage to skate in front of her gang of bullies. Eventually through a series of events the rival girls become friends and Blizzard goes back to the North Pole. Jessie stops moping and goes outside to make a new friend. This is a great heartwarming story about friendship.

I am not sure how this movie slipped under the radar. It is one that should be shown on TV every year along with Christmas Story. Perhaps the reason the movie is not more popular is that it does seem to target the young female audience. Even the ""bad guy"" who enforces the rules is likable. Santa is slightly deaf in a funny sort of way. He hears things slightly off.

Highly recommended.",1288051200,3,1590,4.404761904761905
2403001,4,B000B6CO34,"This is definitely a must have for a Christmas movie. It has more substance than a Hallmark ""made for TV"" movie. But it is not like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" or "" A Bishop's Wife"" with Cary Grant. I am very picky about Christmas movies. I have found many Amazon reviews to be overly optimistic when it concerns Christmas flicks. Generally I try to rent them on Netflix before I commit to buying. However, this movie (with voice over by Whoppi Goldberg) is really a step above the marshmallow movies and a step below the aforementioned oldie goodies. Yet, I highly recommend it for its charming qualities of a little girl who loves to ice skate, who is trained by a former Olympic Medalist. There is dynamic tension. There are teachable moments when you learn about Blizzard's ( Whoopi Goldberg) special empathetic qualities that make her the most special reindeer of all. Yet she pays a price for her deep concern. Yet she does the right thing anyway. However...there is homage to obeying authority even when she is doing the right thing she must come to terms with the rules of the North Pole.  There is a dastardly antagonist. There is a parent out of work who is not concerned with the girl's skating when he loses his job and they have to move. There is a jealous rich skater bent on winning at all costs. There are things to work out here. As the film unfolds ribbon by ribbon we come to love certain characters. Only one character is not truly authentic. The doting Auntie has moments of dialogue that are not really believable. A small glitch. There is nothing really too sad in this film. Enough dynamic tension to keep the viewer ready and waiting for more story to unfold. I give it four stars not five because of the small glitch aforementioned but mostly because the story line is not as powerful as the oldies I mentioned in the beginning of the review. I would feel confident about showing this movie to my family of all ages.",1260057600,7,1938,4.537142857142857
2403002,5,B000B6CO34,"This is one of the most magical Christmas films of all time!!

2403005,5,B000B6CO34,"This is a heart warming movie that says to me, when we dream and have visions of who we are and want to be, 'let nothing stand in our way of believing we can be what we want to be', as with Katie.  Whether we are young or old, 'never stop believing in Santa Claus'.",1202860800,2,265,3.8181818181818183

There is no foul language or inappropriate content. All ages can watch this film together. This is one DVD that my family will probably wear out.",1166227200,9,478,4.505747126436781

BUT it's message is a good one---friendships last forever, even when the friend is not around.  The fake snow looks lovely and Christopher Plummer is pictured as a Father Christmas type eschewing the traditional red and white suit for the long, beautifully fashioned coats.  Zoe Warner is a delightful young leading lady; Kevin Pollak seems to have fun with his semi-villainous role; Brenda Blethyn is a charming storyteller and Whoopi Goldberg gives Blizzard enjoyable life.  Whether it's excellent film-making or not (ROOTS LeVar Burton directed with a cameo as a nightwatchman), it brought both smiles and a tear or two.  And that's what I like in my Christmas movies.

8082293,4,B000B6CO34,"Blizzard is a simple, but effective talking animal interacts with humans film.  That talking animal is Blizzard, a reindeer that is born and is visibly different (has hair, I'm pretty sure it might even be a cow actor used). The North Pole manager or whatever he was, wants to get rid of it, the other reindeer mention it being a freak. As it grows up it resembles the other reindeer but has an attitude (and is now voiced by Whoopi Goldberg) no doubt because of the way the other reindeer have treated it, it's whole life.  It doesn't respect the rules of the North Pole, or accept it can't do something, such as because it's a girl.  Blizzard has abilities most other reindeer don't, she can fly effortlessly for one thing, something the other reindeer it's age can't. When she can discover she can turn invisible, as well as get visions of human children who are sad in cities far away, such as an ice skating loving girl who has been bullied by her brothers her whole life and has now moved to the city because her dad lost his job and she has no friends, she decides to go comfort the girl and offer advice. Of course this is forbidden under the rules, and there are consequences for breaking the rules if she gets caught.

As I said the storyline is fairly simple.  There are times when it's obvious green screen, especially with the reindeer flying and stuff.  But that doesn't really matter.  A few plot holes, such as Santa being pretty much deaf at the start, where a frustrated Archimedes tries to tell him Blizzard has been born and taking about five minutes to communicate that to him, whereas at the trial scene later, he seems to have normal hearing.  Why would a police car have arrived (with a father of a character in it) at the frozen pond when they would have had no way to know to go there?  But police sirens sounding and the cars arriving after an event has taken place in movies is common place, and I guess they didn't think kid viewers would question it.",1516665600,,1980,4.432506887052342
