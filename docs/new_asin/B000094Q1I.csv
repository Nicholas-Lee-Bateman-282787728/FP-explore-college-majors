7989297,5,B000094Q1I,"Here's a little-known gem from 1976.
""The Patriots"" tells the tale of a struggling, post-Revolution America from Thomas Jefferson's point of view. Easily on a par with the more famous musical ""1776"", this serious drama outlines Jefferson's conflict with the philosphy of Alexander Hamilton (Philip LeStrange).
The performances are top notch, especially Jefferson (Robert Murch) and Washington (Ralph Clanton). Both forefathers spring to life under the steady hands of the actors who portray them. You'll be hard pressed to find a better or more memorable portrayal of these two men once you sample ""The Patriots"". Madison, Monroe and Hamilton also become real human beings, in place of the marble statuary we are so used to.
Also of note is the accurate depiction of the little-known danger facing the young American nation in the 1780's-90's, as forces conspire to impose a monarchy and dissolve the Constitution. Jefferson helped to stem the tide, and his role in that conflict is ably demonstrated here.
There is some minor television-acceptable cursing, but nothing kids can't handle today. Kids ought to watch this anyway, as it makes history come alive in ways that books sometimes cannot.
The transfer here is excellent, so you won't suffer the common video errors from some poorer transfers to DVD. If you like Jefferson, Revolutionary Era history, or just good theatre, this one's a keeper.",1066262400,11,1399,5.222222222222222
