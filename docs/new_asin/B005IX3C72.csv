4710624,2,B005IX3C72,"Once upon a time, before I knew any better, I loved this movie. I've just watched it again for the first time in more than 20 years; sad to say, ""Housekeeping"" doesn't hold up very well.

The movie has excellent cinematography; it's gorgeous to behold in widescreen finally, to see the lovely compositions of grey mountains and an iced-over lake as they were meant to be seen.

Yet at the same time, it's a poorly edited film. Whenever Christine Lahti says something memorable or poignant or important, the camera has always just cut away to someone else's face.

Worse than this, director Bill Forsyth's script relies too heavily on voiceover narration, so much so that the performers are left with almost nothing to do -- the movie is being read to us. Forsyth cut all the great satirical humor from the novel and left in everything sentimental. This movie was made for innocents of all ages who fancy themselves deep, yet who have never gotten beyond their shallow dependence on movies to reinforce their own rather dismal version of sensitivity.

Forsyth ought to have scrapped the voiceover entirely and trusted the strength of the images to tell the story. Make the audience work some to puzzle out connections. The actors are visually right, yet excessively underutilized.

Also, mores change, and I'm no longer as amused or captivated by Sylvie's primitive liberalism as I once was. What used to seem brilliantly quirky now strikes me as disingenuous at best. Still for the undiscriminating and unreconstructed, this woefully inadequate literary adaptation may continue to whisper its terribly minor significance. Oh, and I hated the scene where the 2 women sing ""Goodnight Irene"" in a leaky rowboat under a bridge at night: the set-up felt like emotional blackmail to me.",1360022400,4,1780,4.97979797979798
4710625,5,B005IX3C72,"The movie affected me because it was so close to how my Sister and I related to each other, she was also ""The Perfect One"". I just wish my Aunt was as cool as their's was. You have the mystery of the train wreck, the mystery of their Mother's suicide. The mystery of what will become of our protagnists? A great ""woman's movie"" Only a woman would get it.",1359763200,,354,4.144927536231884
4710626,4,B005IX3C72,"Bill Forsythe really captures the tone and atmosphere of this haunting novel of the struggle to find ones true place in the world. While sometimes wry, this is not really a humorous story. It is not as light as Local Hero, but does evince Forsythes affection for quirky characters and stark locales that are themselves a character  in the tale. Christine Lahti is terrific. Don't miss this gem.",1355443200,11,394,4.794117647058823
4710627,5,B005IX3C72,I saw this movie many years ago and was waiting for it to be put on DVD.  It was just like I remembered.  I would also recommend the book!,1355097600,,138,3.7241379310344827
4710628,5,B005IX3C72,"I saw this when it first came out, and saw it no less than six times. I told everyone I knew to see it, and they all agreed that it was one of the best films of that year, and further wondered why they had not heard of it. I don't want to give a huge review, extolling the film's numerous virtues. Just know that this is a small, quiet, moving and faintly disturbing little movie, which in it's tiny way is far more revolutionary and profound than nine out of ten Oscar winners. For fine acting, direction, cinematography, and music, you need search no further. They don't come better than this. A small quiet film that gets by without shootings, impalings, or overt propaganda.",1351814400,23,678,4.432
4710629,5,B005IX3C72,"This would probably be considered a 'chick flick', but I'm a guy in my early sixties and I love it. For all of those out there that have never truly bought in to the consensual paradigm, this is a movie for you. I had just finished watching the Russian movie 'Heart of a Dog' and seen and felt the power that the majority often, almost always, has over the ponderers, the free-flyers. So I was again struck by the portrayal of Ruthie and her aunt being threatened by the upstanding citizens of the town, particularly the self-righteous church members and the local constabulary. It is a movie for our times, I believe, a depiction of an opting out that many in our culture could stand to to see and to think about.
Christine Lahti has never been better, almost as if the role was written for her. This is a very good, very quiet movie that I rate as 8 out of 10. Sit back, be quiet and watch and enjoy.",1337731200,31,902,4.280701754385965
4710630,5,B005IX3C72,"Finally!!!!
I have been waiting sooooo long for this movie to be released on DVD!  A very quirky but heartwarming movie about two orphans who are cared for by strange free-spirited aunt.  Great movie!  Recommended.",1325548800,20,214,5.057142857142857
4710631,5,B005IX3C72,"I rented this title because I was curious about how a filmmaker would adapt Marilynne Robinson's spare, lovely novel for the screen. And while the film does capture the essence of the novel, it succeeds as a work of art on its own. It's beautifully shot, and all of the actors--especially Christine Lahti--give very fine performances. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a blu-ray release!",1310428800,38,388,4.984615384615385
4710632,2,B005IX3C72,Not at all what I was expecting.  This is a very dark drama with moments of contrived humor.,1478476800,,92,4.111111111111111
4710633,5,B005IX3C72,Great job of adapting a terrific book.  Beautiful photography.  Fine acting.  Iloved it.,1475366400,,88,5.615384615384615

4710637,2,B005IX3C72,Exceptionally depressing! The story of giving up on life... with the smile of a fool. So very hard to watch. Left me extremely depressed. The depression lasted all night after I watched this movie. No idea what people like about a young girl being influenced by her mentally ill Aunt to derail her own life on purpose. They aren't free spirits... they are homeless and lost. I kept hoping someone would save her...,1449792000,3,414,4.684931506849315

4710640,3,B005IX3C72,"I was expecting a quirky well written script, well it was just too predictable and depressing to enjoy the tale. I wouldn't recommend watching it for fun.",1441497600,,154,4.7407407407407405
4710641,5,B005IX3C72,One of the most amazing dark comedies.  Unexpected twists and turns around every corner.  Oh please do not read the story line prior to viewing the movie.,1439596800,,154,4.666666666666667
4710642,5,B005IX3C72,THE best. Be sure NOT to miss the movie of the same name.  PERFECT.,1439164800,,67,3.7857142857142856
4710643,3,B005IX3C72,"I enjoyed parts of this film and overall I thought the acting was good, especially the part played by Christine Lahti. But it was TOO LONG!!! Seemed to go on and on, with not much being said of any consequence, in particular between the two sisters. Then all of a sudden it's time to wrap it up with a less than satisfying ending.

On the plus side, the filming was so beautiful. It added a haunting quality to the overall experience of watching this film and also conveyed the era quite well too. Could have been better though and definitely could have had at least 30 minutes of less than memorable dialogue removed, with no negative effect.",1404518400,,643,4.495726495726496
4710644,5,B005IX3C72,"This is the most unique story for a movie, I've ever seen and still not be ""weird"".  After I watched this movie, over and over
again, I tried to find movies that would be similar, but couldn't find anything.  This is Christine Lahti's best movie.  A story
about a woman who is an itinerant in the 50's, who just likes to travel wherever her mood dictates.  She has nothing and
she's fine with that and gets pleasure out of the smallest things.  She is happy.  She loves her nieces, but people find her
way of life and what makes her life wonderful to her, weird and therefore makes her incapable of raising her two nieces when
when they lose their mother.  She's kind.  She does things that people don't approve of, such as falling asleep on a park
bench in a town park in the middle of the day, or staying out all night on a lake in a rowboat, or befriending people who
the majority of people feel are trashy.  She's comfortable with herself and doesn't understand why people think she's weird.
She's an unconventional person in a too strict person.  She's an absolute delight to watch.  It's one of my favorite movies,
and I'd recommend it to everyone.  You would also learn a lot about the person who has seen this movie.  Conventional
types find her loopy, and more carefree types enjoy her view on life.",1402099200,,1308,4.445378151260504
4710645,4,B005IX3C72,"This movie, and the book that inspired it, paints a beautiful thoughtful portrait of those individuals who do not flow with the mainstream.  The movie neither depicts them unkindly nor as heroes.  The dialogue and narration just presents, takes a photograph, of the uniqueness of these individuals.  The movie demonstrates how difficult their lives are when they try to fit in, and how it would be natural for those who do fit in to be concerned about these anomalies of being.  It is a very thoughtful move and well acted.  Christine Lahti does a wonderful job of keeping her character subtle, all the while quietly expressing the depth of emotions and inward struggle of the woman she portrays.",1402012800,2,696,4.864406779661017
4710646,5,B005IX3C72,"I saw this movie once long ago, it stuck with me as "" Auntie Deranged "" not Housekeeping, this touching story isn't titled to stick as Auntie Deranged, a very much must see realistic life story which matches true life experiences, we all know some one who is off with the world as Auntie Deranged and her poor Nieces, a heart warming story with humor and tears a plenty, I found it here amazingly, I am buying my copy once I share my words with you, have no second thoughts, buy it your self and be entertained as you also view this magic realistic story and come to love as I have "" Auntie Deranged "" aka Housekeeping...",1401235200,2,621,4.271186440677966
4710647,3,B005IX3C72,While it was slow it was entertaining but the end was somewhat of a disappointment. I never like it when it's not clear what happened.,1398384000,3,134,4.4
4710648,3,B005IX3C72,"This is the first movie I bought, because I saw it when it first came out, it made a lasting impression on me, and I wanted to watch it again.  I'm sure if I could have watched more than 5 minutes of it in 2 second sound bites at a time, I would've like it.  I'm sure it's a 5 star movie.  Since I couldn't watch this movie at all and should've rated it Zero, I compromised and gave it 3.  This time I was really disappointed by what is going on with the slow streaming.",1398124800,,470,3.8645833333333335

4710650,3,B005IX3C72,"Loved the book and certainly the images in this film of Fingerbone, the area and the house did not disappoint. I really enjoyed Christine Lahti's take on Sylvie, the flighty, dreamy and not quite of this world aunt, and I thought Andrea Burchill's version of Lucille was spot on. Sara Walker certainly fit the physical requirements of her character, but there was something lacking. I'm not sure if it was the fault of directing or if something more was needed from Walker.",1393200000,,473,4.780487804878049
4710651,4,B005IX3C72,"A charming, funny and sometimes sad movie about an eccentric woman, wonderfully played by Christine Lahti, who lives life in her own way. Her unconventional lifestyle is disrupted when she becomes responsible for taking care of the teenage daughters of her sister, who has committed suicide. One daughter is determined to be popular and conventional, while the other is more like her aunt. Meanwhile, the townspeople are determined to pressure these women into conforming to 1950s-era standards of ""normalcy.""",1392595200,6,509,5.455696202531645

4710653,5,B005IX3C72,Really one of the better movies ever made. For a long time it wasn't available but now it is and boy are you lucky. Lahti has never been better. it has a great scene in the woods that really captures the novel. That's what it did. It did credit to a brilliant novel. Superb. It was so nice to see it again after so many years.,1381449600,2,326,3.9545454545454546

4710656,5,B005IX3C72,"I originally saw it years ago on one of the premium channels and loved it from the first time I ever saw it; I have since seen it a couple more times on premium channels or VHS. Not only is the plot interesting and unusual but the character development is good as well, Christine Lahti is superb as the off-beat, unconventional aunt. This movie is a real understated gem. I have also read the book it was based on authored by Marilynne Robinson which an excellent read as well; in my opinion the film was very well adapted from the book which cannot be said of most book to film translations.

I have been anxiously waiting for this film to be released on DVD! I kept checking on Amazon every few months and getting discouraged that it ever would be until a few days ago when my routine 'search' turned up positive results - I couldn't click the 'buy now' button fast enough.

4710659,5,B005IX3C72,"I loved this movie from the first time I watched it as a pre-teen.  It's something about the akwardness of the aunt and the eldest sister that I relate to, and endears this film to me. Hard to express, but this is one of my all-time favorites. One of those movies that I prefer to watch alone, or with someone very unique, too. Enjoy!",1365897600,9,334,4.21875
4710660,5,B005IX3C72,"I just love the way this story is presented.  It's a rather quiet film, and the humor is often very subtle.  I think you have to be a little off-center to appreciate all of it.
The acting is superb - Christine Lahti was a perfect choice for this role, and the two nieces, well, under the tutelage of Lahti, created two of the most endearing movie characters I have ever seen.
I saw this movie when it was first released, and my friends and I discussed it for months after.  I purchased it on VHS and DVD, and am so happy that the movie still has heart after all these years.",1363219200,9,574,4.153153153153153
4710661,5,B005IX3C72,"This is an excellent depiction of the extremes to which our culture can go when believing ""Cleanliness is next to godliness"".The main character is an intelligent, happy woman who just doesn't happen to be an adequate housekeeper and who is put in charge of her two nieces.  The local churchwomen actually end up driving her away, along with one of the girls.  Christine Lahti is wonderful in the lead and makes us ask the question ""Just what are the necessary qualifications of a guardian?""

8475217,5,B005IX3C72,"This film is wonderful. It's the kind of movie that reminds you that women are strong and we all cope in different ways. It is extremely far from the typical Hollywood stereotype of women (overmedicated, dramatic and man needy). It's about three paths on the same journey. There needs to be an increase in films like this that truly address the quality of individualism in an overly socialized world. No, not like the activist groupies who are trendy. I'm talking about people who do what they do because it makes sense to them not because they are looking for attention.",1529020800,,571,4.72

8475223,4,B005IX3C72,"I hadn't seen Bill Forsyth's HOUSEKEEPING (1987) since possibly the early 1990s, and what an unusual, lovely, woefully underseen gem this is. Christine Lahti (who can do no wrong) stars as offbeat Aunt Sylvie, who arrives in a small Pacific Northwest town, circa the 1950s, to care for her two orphaned teenage nieces. Legend has it the girls' grandfather was one of 200 passengers who perished in a train accident years ago, the locomotive disappearing forever into the icy depths. After the tight-knight sisters begin to grow apart, the elder, quieter Ruth (Sara Walker) connects more deeply with the unpredictable but loving Aunt Sylvie just as the healthiness of their domestic life is called into question. HOUSEKEEPING is anchored in the nostalgic realities of memories and growing up, but there is a subtle anything's-possible magic in its storytelling, imagery and setting that makes it truly special.
