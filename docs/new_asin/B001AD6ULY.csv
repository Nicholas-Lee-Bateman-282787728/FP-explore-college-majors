8347714,1,B001AD6ULY,"This is a wonderfully entertaining movie by a solid director with an extremely handsome leading man and a Gorgeous leading lady and by far the WORST transfer I have ever seen!  I have been attempting to find a decent copy of this film for some time without success,but this was just insulting. This was blatantly burned from a computer,complete with index files,and considering Sinister Cinema advertised it's ""Great color"", I expected just that: Great color. It is exactly the opposite. The color is the most washed out of any copy I have seen. This company should be ashamed of themselves for foisting this low grade product on the public at any cost. This experience has greatly damaged their reputation for me and I will not purchase anything this company puts out.",1508803200,,769,4.870229007633588
