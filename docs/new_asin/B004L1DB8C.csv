8433746,4,B004L1DB8C,"Remember the stories of Pippi Longstocking and her adventures? I used to read Astrid Lindgren's stories about Pippi and remembered watching the screen adaptation years ago. Lately, I discovered the animated series, and my first grader loves the stories and vibrant animation. This disc contains four episodes, i.e. Pippi Goes Up in a Balloon, Pippi Entertains Two Burglars, Pippi Saves the Whales - Again, and Pippi Trains Some Animals and Their Owner.

The stories are fun and engaging for younger children, perhaps the 4-8 age group. The DVD does not really have any extra features, except for the option of English or French language tracks, and a kid-friendly auto play (a ten second countdown to automatically play the whole program from the main menu). Total running time is about 88 minutes for the entire disc.",1320969600,,818,5.059259259259259
