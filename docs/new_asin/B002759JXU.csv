8354007,2,B002759JXU,I ordered a book and instead I received a DVD. I only have a DVD player on my computer which is not anywhere near my sewing area. I wanted the book because I could pick up and read the parts any time.,1435708800,,200,3.7857142857142856
8354008,4,B002759JXU,Quilt in a day? Dare to dream. Although my  sewing isn't that speedy I'm happy to use Eleanors methods. Im a very visual learner and this is the first sewing instructions that didn't have me pulling out my hair and calling my mom for help every five minutes. I hope I'm still stripping when I'm Eleanors age:).,1425945600,,310,4.43859649122807
