5444139,5,B00AJU71OY,"Yes, I and no doubt many others have long awaited the Region One DVD version of ""Blue Dahlia"" and ""Phantom Lady"". The latter is one of my most beloved NOIRS. I prefer the ones with surreal, Kafkaesque dream-ish atmosphere and lots of night scenes. ""Phantom Lady"" has a wonderful night scene wherein a woman is following a man whom she wishes to make confess, and we follow her around corners , down empty streets and even into the abandoned subway at night (which is always creepy). The beautiful b/w photography enhances the eerie mood. I find this picture a treasure to watch over and over. ""Blue Dahlia"" has less of this atmosphere but engaging performances and an interesting plot lend it appeal. There are many wonderful shots of the city at night and of interiors. Written by Raymond Chandler.

I am less familiar with the ""Glass Key"" . I haven't watched it yet. But I bought this set to have the other two. I am so glad it finally is available. If you like NOIRS, or simply mysteries done in the classic elegant style, snap these up!",1358467200,4,1040,4.561497326203209
5444140,5,B00AJU71OY,"This is an excellent set of movies and finally on Region 1 DVD. TCM and Universal did an awesome job on this set and I can't wait to see what they do next. The quality of the movies are great for both video and audio. All three movies come with bonus features and including an introduction by Ben Mankiewicz, just like your watching on Turner Classic Movie channel. There are three disks and these movies don't have any subtitles and any other audio except english.

All movies are in b&w and is in Full frame format. ""The Glass Key"" runs for about 85mins (1hr and 25mins); stars: Alan Ladd, Veronica Lake, Brian Donlevy, Bonita Granville, Richard Denning, Joseph Calleia, William Bendix, plus others and was  Directed by Stuart Heisler (Storm Warning '50). ""Phantom Lady"" runs for about 87mins; stars: Franchot Tone, Ella Raines, Alan Curtis, Aurora Miranda, Thomas Gomez, Elisha Cook Jr., plus others and was  Directed by, Robert Siodmak (The Killers '46, The Dark Mirror '46). ""The Blue Dahlia"" runs for about 99mins (1hr and 39mins); stars: Alan Ladd, Veronica Lake, William Bendix, Howard Da Silva, Hugh Beaumont, Will Wright, Frank Faylen, plus others and was Directed by, George Marshall (Destry Rides Again '39).

Overall this is a great set and I would recommend this to anyone and especially to Film noir fans. This set is only exclusive to TCM, so the best place to get it is either here, if a seller has a low price or at TCM, but I'd recommend getting where you think is more convenient.",1355356800,16,1500,4.735632183908046
5444141,4,B00AJU71OY,"""God Bless Mama, Papa, Captain America, Veronica Lake and the President of the United States"". That line of dialogue was said by the young Ann Newton character in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt""(1943). After watching it over the years, I've often wondered who Veronica Lake was. So I did my research and first watched ""Sullivan's Travels""(1941) the Preston Sturges classic and can honestly say that I wasn't that impressed with her. I knew about the famous 'Peekaboo' hairstyle but you have to have more than that to be a good actress. Then I watched ""So Proudly We Hail!""(1943) and I was hooked. She was terrific in her supporting role and probably like most of the GI's at the time I had to have more of her. Since then I've seen her in ""This Gun for Hire""(her first pairing with Alan Ladd in 1942) and now thanks to TCM and Universal, two more Lake/Ladd titles: ""THE GLASS KEY""(1942) and ""THE BLUE DAHLIA""(1946).  Between 1941 - 1946, Veronica Lake was one of the most popular box office stars in the world and after she and Ladd teamed for ""This Gun for Hire"" Ladd's career took off too. Most people remember him now for his performance in the George Stevens classic film ""Shane""(1953). Sadly, he's been mostly forgotten today along with other capable actors of his day such as Dana Andrews, Dan Duryea and Sterling Hayden. I'm not going to comment on the sad circumstances concerning Ladd and Lake's private life except to say that they each both died at the too young age of 50. After watching their first film together, the terrific ""This Gun for Hire""(part of the Universal Film Noir Series) I was hoping I'd get the chance to see some of the others. TCM and Universal have now finally released two of them, ""THE GLASS KEY"" and ""THE BLUE DAHLIA"" along with ""PHANTOM LADY"" in a nice three disc box set called DARK CRIMES. As far as I know, this is the first time all three have been released on DVD. I won't give away the plots except to say that all three involve a man wrongly accused of murder. The three films are very enjoyable and if you like William Bendix, he shows up in two of them. I wish I could have given the set five stars but the picture quality is not that good. It's too bad TCM or Universal couldn't have used better prints or at least restored them like they did with this year's ""Universal Classic Monsters"" collection. I know it's expensive but there is no reason why the DVD disc of ""PHANTOM LADY"" should look this bad. There are lines running through many of the scenes which makes it hard to watch. Of the three, ""THE BLUE DAHLIA"" fares the best video-wise and the story by screenwriter Raymond Chandler keeps you guessing right to the end. I'm recommending this set but if you're expecting the video to be nearly pristine for each of the films then you better skip it which might be hard to do if you love film noir like I do. There are many extras on each of the three discs and very informative interviews with film noir historian Eddie Muller. I would not pay the price that has been listed for this set on Amazon. I got it thru TCM directly for $23.99 plus shipping. ""DARK CRIMES"" is a good but not perfect film noir set from TCM and I'm looking forward to more TCM titles in the future.(note: there are no subtitles in this set)",1355356800,35,3273,4.473244147157191
8552714,5,B00AJU71OY,"A great collection all around - Ladd and Lake are sparkling together as always in The Blue Dahlia and The Glass Key - their performances have echoes of their first film together, This Gun for Hire (not included in this collection). The Phantom Lady was an unexpected pleasure - I was less familiar with this film than the Ladd/Lake entries, but it was a thoroughly engaging yarn about a man caught up in a twisty noirish conspiracy.",1502841600,,432,4.623376623376624
8552715,4,B00AJU71OY,"""Dark Crimes: Film Noir Thrillers"" is nearly a bare bones set. There are no subtitles or captions, audio commentaries, or scene menus for any of the films. Universal's unwillingness to put much effort into DVDs these days is unfortunate. These films beg for audio commentaries. But this set brings together three seminal, exemplary authors of hard-boiled crime fiction: Dashiell Hammett, whose novel ""The Glass Key"" is his most skillfully written and one of the best of the genre. Cornell Woolrich, whose pulpy novel ""Phantom Lady"" makes a decent film in the hands of director Robert Siodmak, even if the plot can't support much substance. Raymond Chandler, best known for his popular crime novels, wrote ""The Blue Dahlia"", his only original screenplay, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award. Frankly, ""The Glass Key"" is not as hard-hitting as the book. ""Phantom Lady"" is a bit silly and hampered by the would-be hero being in prison and hardly in the plot. The ending of ""The Blue Dahlia"" was lessened by censors. But these are genuinely noir films - though ""Phantom Lady"" is less so. They're not conventional murder dramas or crime thrillers packaged as ""noir"". They're good films based on books by great noir authors, or actually written by one.

The films are:

""The Glass Key"" (1944) takes on politics and murder In an unnamed American city, where political boss Paul Madvig (Brian Donlevy) has put his weight behind Senator Ralph Henry (Moroni Olson) in the upcoming gubernatorial election, in no small part because Madvig is smitten with the Senator's shrewd daughter Janet (Veronica Lake). Madvig's right-hand man Ed Beaumont (Alan Ladd) feels Madvig is being used by the Senator and criticizes his boss' decision to turn against local gangster Nick Varna (Joseph Calleia) by reneging on protection that Varna paid for and closing down his gambling houses, all to please the Senator. When the Senator's wayward, addicted son Taylor (Richard Denning) is found dead from a blow to the head, Madvig is a convenient suspect, and Varna does not hesitate to exploit that fact to get revenge.

In ""Phantom Lady"" (1944) , Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) spends his anniversary drowning his sorrows in a bar upon realizing his marriage has crumbled. He meets a woman (Fay Helm) there who seems similarly adrift. He invites her to the show he intended to take his wife to. After the show, the lady departs, saying that it's better if she doesn't give him her name. Upon returning to his apartment, Henderson is met by police officers who inform him his wife has been murdered, strangled with his tie. When Henderson tries to provide an alibi, everyone remembers him but no one remembers the mystery woman, who was wearing a distinctive feathered hat. When he's convicted of murder, Henderson's faithful secretary Carol Richman (Ella Raines) and the investigating police Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez), convinced of his innocence, try to find the phantom lady.

In ""The Blue Dahlia"" (1946), Lt. Cdr. Johnny Morrison (Alan Ladd) arrives in Hollywood from the South Pacific with War buddies Buzz Wanchek (William Bendix) and George Copeland (Hugh Beaumont) in tow. Morrison wants to surprise his wife Helen (Doris Dowling) at the bungalow where she is living, but he interrupts a party and starts a fight with Eddie Harwood (Howard da Silva), a nightclub owner and friend of Helen's, believing that the two are having an affair. The Morrisons quarrel some more, and Johnny walks out. The next morning, Helen is found dead, shot with her husband's pistol. Police Capt. Hendrickson (Tom Powers) immediately suspects Johnny, but the list of suspects is long: Eddie Harwood, Harwood's estranged wife Joyce (Veronica Lake), and Buzz, who visited Helen's apartment that night to discuss Johnny's leaving. Even the audience is not sure whom to suspect.

The DVDs (Universal 2013):

On the ""The Glass Key"" disc, there is a short introduction (2 1/2 min) to the set by TCM host Ben Mankiewicz, in which he says a few words about each film, including the repeated pairing of Veronica Lake and Alan Ladd. Other bonus features for ""The Glass Key"" are: ""Eddie Muller on Dashiell Hammett's The Glass Key"" (2  min), ""Eddie Muller on Lake and Ladd"" (2  min), in which the ""Czar of Noir"" offers brief comments on those topics, Publicity Stills (11), Scene Stills (12), Behind-the-Scenes Photos (the scroll on this feature didn't work for me), Movie Posters (9), Lobby Card Set (8 lobby cards), and an article (text) written for the TCMDb by Michael Sragow comparing the three films in the ""Dark Crimes"" set within the noir style and discussing themes in each film.

The ""Phantom Lady"" disc includes ""Eddie Muller on Robert Siodmak"" (3 min), in which the ""Czar of Noir"" has much praise for the director as a quintessential noir director, ""Eddie Muller on Phantom Lady"" (3 1/2 min), in which Muller talks about ""Phantom Lady"" among the early noir films that generated interest and profit from the style, ""Marsha Hunt on Film Noir"" (2 min), a brief clip of the actress talking about what defines ""noir"", Publicity Stills (11), Scene Stills (26), Behind-the-Scenes Photos (3), Movie Posters (6), and Lobby Cards (7). ""The Blue Dahlia"" disc includes ""Eddie Muller on Raymond Chandler's The Blue Dahlia"" (4 min), Publicity Stills (61), Scene Stills (65), Behind-the-Scene Stills (1), Movie Posters (5), Lobby Card Set (8). The interview with Muller is worth watching for his comments on the circumstances under which Raymond Chandler wrote the film.",1408579200,2,5531,5.036065573770492

This and women in danger are two of the best ( this one far better, the other is a campy fun kind of movie to watch with a crowd!)

8552721,2,B00AJU71OY,"The films lack subtitles or even captions. The sound in ""Phantom Lady"" has a harsh quality that is quite irritating. Understandable, but with an ""edge"". The plots of ""The Blue Dahlia"" and ""The Phantom Lady"" are of some historical interest due to their absurdity.",1363478400,3,262,4.9772727272727275

I was so glad when I found this Film Noir Album combing these movies.
All three are outstanding examples of this period in Films.

8552723,3,B00AJU71OY,"Was excited to hear Universal and Turner Classic Movies put this film noir set together. Have always loved the detail and clarity that Universal put in their older black and white films. They look to be from the original negatives, but this set is a big letdown from the awesome restoration Universal has done for many years (check out Universal's Sci-Fi collections volumes 1 and 2). These three films in this set (The Glass Key, The Phantom Lady, and The Blue Dahlia) the transfers seem to be struck from film prints. Scratches, arifacts and cigarette burns in upper right corner plague thse wonderful movies. On top of those problems, the prints are way too soft for DVD these days. It almost looks like these were recorded from a Laserdisc print because of the blurriness. It is sad that the best two actors (Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake) in film noir don't get the respect from Universal. Especially with Universal promoting their 100 years with great restorations of their classic films. It took forever for The Glass Key and The Blue Dahlia (my favorite) to get released on DVD. Even with the mediocre prints, its great to have these films on DVD! Each movie is on its own DVD with wonderful packaging.
Also note: TCM Shop has this set for under thirty bucks (including priority shipping). I wouldn't pay more for this set. These great movies deserve better treatment. Hopefully one day the negatives will show up and we will get immaculate transfers of these great film noir classics.
Would love to find all of Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake film noir on DVD!!",1359936000,15,1564,4.732600732600733
