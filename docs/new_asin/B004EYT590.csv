4367977,5,B004EYT590,"For some reason, people don't like Katie Holmes. Maybe it's because she married weirdy Tom Cruise. Maybe it's because she's a wealthy, successful and attractive woman. Who knows. What I do know is that this movie was really enjoyable. Not perfect-- but I wouldn't have changed much.

I thought it was a very pretty movie. The scene where the friends go swimming in the night-black ocean was particularly memorable.

So, thank you Katie (and Galt Niederhoffer) for making a movie for me! Finally. I'm sick of Iron Man 14 and Superman 22 and Jennifer Aniston's endless crap.",1297641600,14,572,4.88659793814433
4367978,1,B004EYT590,"I watch this movie yesterday and sadly I have to say that its terrible, I mean I love Josh and Katie so I thought that will be a great movie, but has not meaning, and the ending is really unexpected, you are waiting for the essence of the movie and a great ending or something, but is the worst ending that I have ever see in my life!! sorry!!

The movie is about a group of collage friends who assist to the wedding of Lily (Paquin) with Tom (Josh) who was the boyfriend,  and the love of Laura (Katie) Laura was girlfriend of Tom for 5 years and then Tom just decide to start a relationship with Lily and he didn't say anything to Laura and just disappears, then Lily the best friend of Laura from the collage, call her and ask her to be her bridesmaid, Laura has to accept and act like she doesn't care about that. when they arrived to the place when the wedding will be the feelings of Laura for Tom are showed, and she has to be strong.

In a part of the movie when all the friends (not Lily) are celebrating in the beach at night Tom decides to swim in the ocean and disappears, so all of the friend divided to start searching Tom, and Laura goes with Chip the Lily's brother (as I understand) but Chip is so bad that Laura goes alone to search Tom, she found him and they start to talk and is there where you know that Tom was afraid of have Laura and because of fear he decide to not be with her, but he still love her and she too. after a little discussion, each one take its way, while the others friends switch couples to search Tom, in the search they relate to each other, .....finally Tom go to Lily to tell her that he doesn't know why he loves her and that he was confuse, she ask him that control himself for 12hours more until wedding...

In the Wedding Laura tell the truth to Lily, and Lily just ignore her and start to show that she was jealous about Laura's success and seems (in my opinion) that Lily wants to marry Tom no matter what just to makes Laura understand that she has what she wants!

And while you are watching the movie you expect a normal end or something....but you have to look like 5 minutes more to see the worst ending I have ever seen...just she walked to the altar, Tom start to talk her about his votes and start raining all run away and Tom and Laura stayed in the garden watching the raining fall and that's the end!!!!!!  can you believed that? .....

By the way...The Romantics was the name of the group in the collage! haha",1297641600,,2473,4.161087866108787
4367979,1,B004EYT590,"Frankly, where was the romanticism in that boring movie? A bunch of desillusioned people, talking and acting nonsense most of the time. So much for being romantic! I am sorry to have wasted my time watching that terrible movie.",1297641600,3,227,4.846153846153846
4367980,2,B004EYT590,"I was so excited about the cast in this movie, I thought it would be entertaining at least....but I was horribly bored at the beginning and then it finally started to pique my interest but it was short-lived.  I felt the movie was a waste of time and I cant believe that these actors and actresses appeared in it.  I really was hoping for much better...I gave the two stars just for the awesome cast!",1297382400,,400,4.32
4367981,5,B004EYT590,"I found there to be a lot to like in ""The Romantics."" First, I really loved the ensemble cast. The film stars Katie Holmes, Josh Duhamel, Anna Paquin, Adam Brody, Malin Akerman, Jeremy Strong, Rebecca Lawernce, Diana Agron and Candice Bergen The actors were all working in top form, exploring their generally unlikable characters to the fullest. The writing is tart and incisive which gives the actors plenty to work with. It's interesting to observe these people who have such history between them for one night of their lives. Because of this storytelling device the narrative may seen rushed or incomplete, but those are things I loved about it. I enjoy stream of conscious storytelling and ""The Romantics"" is very much that type of film. The cinematography adds to the story by being almost dreamlike in style. Not only are the characters intoxicated for a portion of the film, for Laura (Holmes), this night is almost like a dream- but in the worst sense. Her drama with Tom (Duhamel) is emotional and well wrought. I believed these characters' past and it's easy to understand their flaws and longings. I really did think that ""The Romantics"" is a neat little gem. In fact, I enjoyed the book as well, but in all actuality this story works better as a film. There is more of a punch to see the characters working things out visually rather than in your mind. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys movies that take place in one day, movies that have unlikable but complex characters that you get to figure out, and to anyone who understands how messy life and love can be, and in the end, those two things are never, ever, what you expect them to be.",1297382400,28,1666,4.650847457627119
4367982,3,B004EYT590,"With a cast of this caliber, I would have thought that the movie would have been well done, but it wasn't. The gifted cast were made to look like amature actors in my opinion. It was also very predictable for the majority of the scenes. Dark and almost depressing, I'm very disappointed.",1297296000,3,287,4.538461538461538
4367983,1,B004EYT590,This movie is garbage.  It has been done better so many times.  The Big Chill is far better written.,1297123200,,100,4.2105263157894735
4367984,3,B004EYT590,"A group of old college friends reunite for a wedding.  The maid of honor (Holmes) and the groom Tom (Duhamel) are still not sure that thier relationship is over.  After the worst sequence of wedding toasts ever during the rehearsal dinner Tom disappears and Laura finds him and the begin to talk about thier feelings.  The other members of the wedding party are all looking for Tom and trying to keep the bride (Anna Paquin) from discovering what is going on.  This is another plot that has been done to death.  The cast and acting are enough to keep you watching and entertained but the writing really hurt this one.  I can't go farther without giving the movie away, but watch it and you will see what I mean.  I give it a C+.

Would I watch again? - I don't think I would",1297123200,13,774,4.326388888888889
4367985,2,B004EYT590,"Too bad this story / script wasn't better, because some talented young actors deserved better.  In the end, it's a shallow, superficial story about superficial, ultimately selfish and immature people.  There wasn't one person you could root for; you just wanted everyone to grow the f up already. By the ending, I was rolling my eyes.",1472342400,,334,4.946428571428571

4367996,1,B004EYT590,"How did this movie get made?! It seemed the while plotless point was to watch the characters self destruct. But by the end you don't even care that they do because they're such a bunch of self absorbed pricks that you hate them all anyway!

And how are we supposed to believe that not one but TWO women would be obsessed over Josh Duhamel's awful character? Tell me, if your fiance came to you the night before your wedding, told you he didn't know why he loved you and was unsure about the whole relationship, would you go ahead and marry him the next day anyway? On the other hand, if a guy you'd been dating off and on for five years slept with you one night, then proposed to your best friend the next day, didn't talk to you until the day before the wedding, at which point he confesses that he's still in love with you but was scared of the relationship because it was too perfect, sleeps with you anyway, only to abandon you yet again to go and marry a woman he doesn't love, would you still fight for him? No and no! He's a spineless douche bag who doesn't deserve either of them.

And I can't even address the ending because there wasn't one! I seriously thought my DVD had skipped when the credits started rolling but no, it was just a crappy end to a really crappy movie. Please learn from my mistake and stay far away from this movie!",1441843200,,1346,4.25390625

4368010,1,B004EYT590,"This movie has a great title and interesting premise.  Old college buddies reunite for a wedding in a beautiful old house and rehash their glory days gone by.  What could go wrong, right?  Pretty much everything.  From the beginning this movie is forced and tired.  The writing and directing is stiff and unoriginal.  Every trite movie technique is trotted out to pull at the viewer's emotional strings -  - drunken high jinx, skinny dipping, alchohol soaked tirades about ""selling"" out and becoming mediocre - (tired themes from the 60s that should stay in the 60s)!!

The actors try to do their best with the script but even the venerable Anna Paquin falls short and just seems too brittle and narcissistic to believe.  I laughed out loud when Katie Holmes started quoting romantic poetry to her former lover -  via text no less -  in an attempt to seduce him and then when he finds her  - he finishes the poem - seriously??  For me, the only redeeming quality of this movie is actually Katie Holmes -  who for the most part does a nice job with the goofy lines and extremely poor blocking of the movie (I nearly got motion sickness watching her character argue with another while wandering around on the lawn outside in awkward patterns). The most interesting scene takes place near the very end when Katie's character confronts the bride (Anna Paquin)and a heated exchange takes place between the two - wish the movies had explored more of their story as it had some sparks!  The ending leaves much to be desired and I will leave it unrevealed here - which, if you watch the movie will take on a whole new meaning!",1384128000,4,1618,4.608391608391608
4368011,3,B004EYT590,"The conclusion of the Movie was a bit abrupt. The overall plot was a great love story, but i feel like the ending should've shown what happens to Laura and Tom afterwards, it would've been nice closure for the audience.",1382918400,,219,4.5
4368012,5,B004EYT590,"So many people let smaller budget films slip under their radar, and it's a shame since this one brought so much to the cinema table. Anna Paquin, Josh Duhamel, Katie Holmes, and the entire ensemble give what might be their best performances as a trio of old friends whose complex and ongoing love triangle returns the night before two of theirs' (Anna Paquin and Josh Duhamel) wedding. Other fine performances come from Adam Brody, Malin Akerman, Dianna Agron, Elijah Wood, and Candice Bergen.",1375660800,2,493,4.951807228915663
4368013,4,B004EYT590,"IMPRESSION:
i read the bashing reviews, so i rented this without much expectation. to my surprise, i like the mood it emits. the performances are okay and it is strange and smug, but let's face it, it's a portrayal of something most of us have gone through: betrayals from people close to us and the temptation to betray others that we should care strongly about.

PLOT:
if read as a poem, i like it. it's not a mainstream movie with twist and turns, so if you watch ""between the lines,"" - to feel rather than to think - it is easy to relate to, eerily so. it frustrates you, satiates you, and gives you the feeling that none of the characters are real. In a world of superficiality, let's face it, this is the bull's eye.

ENDING:
As for the quarrel about the ending, let's face it, the main characters were never built to be consistent. make of the characters what you will and the ending, which is a bit open ended, will pave a road that is clearer for the movie watcher. i don't profess to know what the movie wants us to feel or think at the end, but i do profess to knowing that inconsistent characters stay inconsistent. without spoiling the movie, to me, that is what the ending is about.",1374451200,4,1196,4.334821428571429

4368015,4,B004EYT590,"This movie highlights the rivalry between steely Bride Anna Paquin and determined  Maid of Honor (MoH) Katie Holmes as they joust for the hand of fair Groom Josh Duhamel.  Long simmering resentments explode as the Bride, MoH, Groom, and assorted college chums gather for the wedding--a conflict that becomes especially intense between the Bride and MoH--who had been college roommates and best friends.

In one very memorable scene involving only the Bride and the MoH, the MoH lays claim to everything that she alleges the Bride stole from her in college.  It was the MoH who first saw the bewitching red dress during a long-ago college shopping trip with the Bride, only to have the Bride sneak back to the store and snatch it away before the MoH could return to buy it.  Also, the MoH's self-designed and trademark Apple tattoo was appropriated by the Bride for a college art project.  And, finally, it was the MoH who first dated the Groom in college, only to have the Bride steal HIM from her too--while wearing the hot RED DRESS!

It becomes clear that the entitled Rich Girl Bride is the very personification of the mercenary attitude that is often associated with Those Born into Wealth, and that all these entities, from the alluring red dress and Apple motif, to the Groom himself, are just things that she must possess at any cost.",1371254400,,1342,4.758620689655173

4368037,4,B004EYT590,"I watched this movie on Amazon Prime solely because of how poor the reviews were that it received.  Based on the description and cast, I had a hard time believing it was as bad as people professed.  Before explaining my opinion of the film, I have a few ideas of why other viewers rated it so poorly:

1)  High Expectations - seems like many viewers had very high expectations for this film.  They were likely holding it up to a high standard of another ""coming of age"" film, and when it failed to conform (however the individual expected or wanted it to conform), the user was displeased.  The result is a poor rating not because the film was bad, but because it did not match what the viewer expected; thus the viewer was in fact rating their viewing experience, not the quality of the film.

2)  Complex Characters - this is the type of film where it requires the viewer to read in between the lines.  The characters often express their emotions and feelings based on their actions, facial expressions and body movements -- not their words.  Viewers expecting the characters to guide them along by the dialogue will be disappointed.  Several poor reviews that I read described weak character development and poor acting; I think that the film Director intended the actors to express much of the plot and depth of characters without literally ""speaking the audience"" through it.

3)  Unspoken and Complex Plot - this film never clearly stated the plot.  The viewer was expected to decipher the plot based on the acting of the characters.  The viewer is required to sum up the parts in order to understand the whole - in each scene, characters offer more clues to guide the viewer along, but the viewer must be keen enough to pick up on them.  Again, many clues are unspoken and communicated through non-verbal means such as emotional expression and body language.

Overall, I liked the film.  I may be biased, since my expectation were not particularly high based on the reviews I read, but I enjoy these types of films and I thought this was one of the better ones.  I would recommend this film to anyone who initially seems interested in it - ignore the other reviewers on amazon and decide for yourself.  Just keep in mind that this is not a mind-numbing comedy that you can watch with one eye and while half asleep and still be able to know what is going on.",1362614400,3,2364,4.583333333333333

I disagree with the review that said this movie is too much like Dawson's Creek.  Dawson's was very well done and it touched on some really true topics, while this movie lacks even ONE topic worth watching!

Laura's toast at the rehearsal dinner is  painful to watch, but I think that was probably the point.

4368082,1,B004EYT590,"We saw a trailer for this, noticed it was available at Redbox, and gave it a try. I liked the idea of exploring life after college, still carrying romantic baggage and considering marriage, but this is one seriously flawed movie, despite its strong cast.

Katie Holmes arrives as the maid of honor for her friend's wedding. The problem is that Katie's character dated the groom for nearly five years, and those feelings between the two are still there. As the groom gets cold feet, quite literally by throwing himself in the nighttime ocean for a swim, the rest of the wedding party sets out to find him, but they are all such self-indulgent characters that they can do nothing but drink, do drugs, flirt adulterously, and--in Katie's case--actually betray her friend by sleeping with the groom. In a laughably bad line, she later tells the bride-to-be: ""He cheated on you,"" taking no responsibility for her own part in the betrayal.

I wanted to care. I sat through the whole depressing, cliched, dysfunctional mess, and in the final minutes I couldn't think of one outcome that would be satisfying. None of them deserved each other, and in that way, they all deserved each other. When lightning shows up to disrupt the nuptials, I dreamed for a moment that everyone would be struck by it to end the movie. The actual ending wasn't much better.

This is, without a doubt, a well-intentioned but horribly derailed wreck of a film. The attempt to explore romanticism has been much better done in other movies, such as ""The Mirror has Two Faces."" Here, every single character is looking into a cracked mirror, unable to face the truth about themselves or their choices.

4368086,2,B004EYT590,"I picked this movie as a rental because of Anna Paquin (I'm a fan of her performance in True Blood, the HBO series). My husband and  settled down to watch this last night and were very disappointed. The entire movie lacks credibility, the writing is awful and derivative, and cliches abound throughout. Even the so-called big names in the cast - Anna Paquin, Katie Holmes, and Josh Duhamel could not save this mess of a movie.

The premise is nothing original - a group of college friends come together to attend the wedding of friends Lila (Paquin) and Tom (Duhamel). Trouble is the maid of honor, Laura (Holmes) used to date Tom back in college and still appears to have strong feelings for him. Predictably, trouble arises, and the movie plods along to its expected conclusion.

The flaws in this movie are many so I'll just focus on some glaring aspects - there is no credibility in the supposedly close bonds between these 'friends'. From the beginning, viewers do not get a sense of the camaraderie between close pals who've spent their college years together. The interactions appear fake and stilted and very unnatural. There is no emotional connection between the characters whatsoever. Tom and Lila are supposed to be deeply in love, but there is a palpable lack of chemistry between these two. This may have been deliberate to show the underlying trouble in the relationship but it makes the whole idea of the wedding farcical.

Then there's the performance of the three leads - Duhamel is ineffectual in his role as the conflicted Tom who can't seem to decide what or who he wants in his life and the quotes he spews from classic English poetry is so wooden it made me want to gag; Paquin is equally bad in her performance as the lovelorn Lila who seems oblivious to what is going on, she is so bent on marrying Tom that she appears to tolerate any transgressions which just does not make sense, her acting appears fake and lacks emotion; finally, Holmes as the tormented maid-of-honor Laura is perhaps the best of all three in terms of her performance, there are some good emotional scenes, but ultimately, the poor writing lets her down too. Oh, and Candice Bergen is totally wasted in the role of the bride's mom! She is given these awful cliched lines and is supposed to be the feared matriarch but her role too is forgettable.

This was an utter waste of time - instead I would recommend watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Chill-15th-Anniversary-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00000G3I2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Chill (15th Anniversary Collector's Edition)</a>, or even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Gatsby/dp/B0000AUHQT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Gatsby</a>!",1300579200,8,2801,5.342403628117914
4368087,2,B004EYT590,"I was very anxious to see this movie, until I read several reviews, and then I decided I'd just watch it anyway to see if it really was as horrible as everyone said it was. Well, for starters, none of the characters (except Katie Holmes' character Laura, surprisingly enough) are likeable. There was absolutely no chemistry between the actors and it was all very awkward and uncomfortable to watch. It is very difficult to believe that these people are all actually friends. I couldn't decide if the viewer is supposed to like Anna Paquin's character Lila, but I certainly didn't. She is very one-dimensional and kind of a selfish b****. And because of that, there was no real conflict; the viewer doesn't feel torn by the Laura-Tom-Lila triangle, you don't sympathize at all with Lila(Paquin), and you just end up rooting for Laura(Holmes) the entire time. I did however like the ending, mostly because it wasn't typical. A lot of the time, movies beat you to death with the point just to make sure you got it (""Incase you didn't realize it already from the last scene, THIS is what the final result is""). I don't want to give it away, but I will just say that there is one last line that's uttered that subtly fills you in on what the outcome of the main characters is. No, you don't get to see everything that happens; there's no jump-ahead-5-years kind of scene where you get to see where everyone ends up, but that's not really necessary. And as for the rest of the characters, their futures are insignificant anyway. Bottom line is, I appreciated the uniqueness of the film's conclusion, and Katie Holmes isn't half bad in indie films, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend this one.",1300492800,3,1688,4.686868686868687
4368088,1,B004EYT590,"I can't believe how much I disliked this movie!  After reading the synopsis, I wasn't surprised that the plot was predictable.  Still, even a predictable plot can be interesting if the performances are good, the chemistry is there and the writing is decent. None of the above applied in this case. I didn't find any of the relationships remotely interesting.....not between the friends or lovers.  There was zero tension and little sincerity to make me care about the characters. Who cares who ends up together?  I certainly didn't. I blame the writing mostly, but this cast of capable and talented performers really did nothing to help it along.  I love all kinds of film and don't normally write reviews. This one was just so disappointing, it felt necessary to pass along a cautionary note to those who might be tempted by the famous ensemble. Don't do it!!",1299974400,2,860,4.8231292517006805
4368089,2,B004EYT590,"Having not read the book I feel cheated. I now plan to read the book so that hopefully it will give me more incite into these characters. I've read in other reviews that Anna Paquin demolished her character Lila. Which would be about right because I was rooting for Katie Holmes (Laura) the entire time. I honestly thought the movie was mediocre at best. It was also very boring at points as the characters mostly just talk. Even the parts that are supposed to be ""funny"" failed to even bring a smile to my face. There were parts that I almost liked about it, I am a sucker for tragic, angsty, love. However I guess I'm sad in a way because I cannot stand movies that don't at least give us an idea of what happens to the characters. If you're sick and demented and like to watch people cheat on each other and argue for an hour and half, this one's for you. Otherwise ...Save your precious time and watch something else.",1299715200,,921,4.329479768786127
4368090,3,B004EYT590,"The best part of this movie is the soundtrack. Anna Paquin still stole every scene she played, even though her character was so one-dimensional. Katie Holmes was somewhat wooden and maybe the worst bit of casting was the male lead. This is not the Big Chill for Gen Y.",1299196800,11,268,4.489795918367347

Not only was it a waste of time but a waste of money. Boring, Boring, BORING!!! I was thinking based on the description something like ""The Big Chill"", I loved a lot of the cast and thought how could you go wrong? Well wrong, wrong, wrong they went! No story line, not sure if the acting was bad or not, this movie was just bad! I hate to write a bad review, but I felt all should be warned!

4368093,4,B004EYT590,"I'm not a fan of romantic comedies but really like Anna Paquin & Josh Duhamel...also Katie Holmes so I bought this movie. I was pleasantly surprised that it was more comedy than romance. The friends that meet together for the wedding are the type of friends I think everyone wished they had. They make the movie lively and really seem to have a bond. It almost felt like a TV show, because by the end, I wanted to keep following their lives (imo, I think it would make a great series). Somehow after all these years after Dawson's Creek, Katie Holmes seemed to be playing the same part, (with the addition of cursing). I don't think the movie was meant to convey any meaning, but from what I got out of it was if you're young, friends and in love, there's no rush to get married. It adds extra stress to what could be a beautiful relationship.",1298160000,4,843,4.375796178343949

I wish I had never bought it or wasted my time viewing!

I don't recommendit-unless you enjoy 20 years olds acting like high school teengagers in their lust hunt which they call love hunt!
