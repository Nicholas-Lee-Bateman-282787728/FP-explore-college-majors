2558645,3,B000FBCC96,...but not by much. Semi-letterbox (still missing LOTS on the sides) with mix of English (with music from the US version) & German (opening/closing credits-music in opening matches Chinese version) with a few lines shifting to German on soundtrack (evidently for scenes not in the US release). Picture varies from spotty to VERY scratchy (reel changes?). If you MUST have a dubbed version this is at least better than the old VHS mastered blurathon that is now OP. Look for a Thai version of the Celestial Pictures remaster (R0 tho' it claims to be R3) or get youself an allregion player & get the legit version!,1147046400,5,612,4.783018867924528

 U will love this. Fine all the karate from the 70's.",1362960000,,117,4.043478260869565
2558649,5,B000FBCC96,"I remember this movie from the early 70's. True the voices don't match and the acting is a little over the top. But the action is really good for a movie made over 40 years ago. The plot is a little more original than ""You killed my teacher!!"" The fight at the fortress at the end is pretty good. Not trying to give away the plot. I watched this movie on a DVD player with 1080 upload on my 50"" Panny plasma. The picture is a lot better than I expected. If you like the old 70's Kung Fu movies you'll love this!",1361836800,,511,3.970873786407767

2558651,4,B000FBCC96,"The New One Armed Swordsman(1971) was an unsuccessful reboot of the One Armed Swordsman franchise, but it should never be forgotten. Lei Li(David Chiang) is a bold young swordsman who loses to a sneaky kung fu master(Ku Feng) and he loses his arm in the duel! A disabled Lei Li finds a job at a teahouse and men get sadistic joy from picking on him! A cute working class girl(played by Li Ching) falls in love with Lei Li and a young swordsman(played by Ti Lung) helps Lei Li regain his confidence. Lei Li's friend is killed by the same, sneaky kung fu master and he wants to avenge his death! Director Chang Cheh directs this third One Armed Swordsman movie and David Chiang replaces Jimmy Wang Yu in the title role. Like most Shaw Brothers movies, the film looks like it was filmed on a set. Music from On Her Majesty's Secret Service(1969) can be heard on the soundtrack. Shaw Brothers starlet Li Ching is lovely in this film and she's convincing as a wholesome, photogenic, sensual, sympathetic young woman. I like the character driven scenes where she helps a crippled Lei Li cook food. I've had a crush on Li Ching after seeing her in the musical Hong Kong Rhapsody(1968). The New One Armed Swordsman was dubbed into English and released in U.S. theaters as Triple Irons. This film isn't as good as One Armed Swordsman(1967) and Return of the One Armed Swordsman(1969), but it's still a good movie.",1309132800,10,1404,4.597609561752988
2558652,5,B000FBCC96,"Ok , why these clowns above me shot this great David Chaing film down is beyond me, I seen this film in drive in's when it came to the US.
This film has tons of great martial art and sword action that is uncomparable to any sword films ive seen even Kurosawa's movies. Only because of sure number of swings and balance from the movie's heroes and villians make this a rare piece of film making, unlike most films i counted over 100 plus dead in the final fight scenes. David Chiang played a great role of a self pity master swordsman , that reflects just how low a man can go in own life and spirit and then take revenge. I think out of the 200 plus martial art/sword films ive seen over the last 40 years i put this in the top 10 of all time martial art films. Too bad everyone is so spoiled over Bruce Lee and the latest street fighting style movies to come along in the last 20 years. There missing a great treat in the New One Armed Swordsman aka Triple Irons",1242950400,9,963,4.1005291005291005
2558653,4,B000FBCC96,"This movie was released in the U.S. as ""Triple Irons"" and it was one of the best Kung Fu movies that I had seen with David Chiang. The first copy I recieved was awful. Green screen, bad picture transfer mixed with German and French language. I contacted the seller and they sent me an excellent copy and I was satisfied! Sorry for some of u that recieved a bad copy, but if u contact the seller and let them know the dvd is bad they may send u a better copy.  Good Luck!!!",1219795200,,472,4.075268817204301
2558654,1,B000FBCC96,"I saw the original US release of this film in 1972 under the title ""Triple Irons"". The quality of this product is not worth even 1 star. The credits are in German. The dubbing switches between German and English. The contrast is so bad the night scenes are unwatchable.

I contacted the reseller, HKFLIX, and they were very prompt and helpful in my return request. I just hope they can find me a quality copy of the film.",1203033600,,421,4.397435897435898
2558655,1,B000FBCC96,when it IS a bootleg. This is a copy stolen from the HK IVL DVD of the same name. Be sure to order the HK DVD or wait for the legit release from the Wienstien company.,1160870400,5,167,3.6666666666666665
8119892,4,B000FBCC96,"First things first: that fight on the bridge is pretty awesome. When David Chiang is running across, and bad guys are not only chasing him but crawling over the sides to get at him? That kind of took my breath away. Besides which that must hold the Shaw Brothers' record for ""most bad guys killed by a lone hero in a climactic battle ever."" He must have left a couple of hundred corpses there.

The other truly notable thing about this movie is that Chiang and Ti Lung both get manahandled one-on-one by Ku Feng. I mean, we don't get to see either of them lose very often, much less both in the same film, but the choice of enemy is interesting as well. Ku Feng is maybe the Shaws' greatest actor (and certainly their most prolific) but he is not among their great fighters. Whether a hero or a villain, he tends to win by wits, strategy, and authority. After years of watching him out-smart and out-maneuver his enemies while getting his friends to do most of the actual fighting, it was nice to see him wade in with that three-segment staff (although of course he does still use his wits, strategy, and authority).

Second-class Shaw Brothers, I'm calling this, but it's right at the head of that class. Well worth a watch, if neither as artistic nor as emotionally satisfying as the original One-Armed Swordsman (to which this is not a sequel, anyway). Give it a shot.",1502064000,,1371,4.502008032128514

8119899,3,B000FBCC96,"Split decision here. I thought it was okay, but hubby loved it. I felt the storyline dragged. (Yes, there is a storyline.) And that the martial arts employed were only so-so. There are many other kung-fu films that I like better. I felt David Chiang and Ti Lung's acting abilities and martial arts skills were wasted in this movie. I would expect this movie to be the second feature of a martial arts double-feature.",1454371200,,416,4.635135135135135
