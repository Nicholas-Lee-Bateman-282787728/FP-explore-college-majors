1623316,5,B00005LQ1L,"I had never tried Pilates before, and was interested to do so. I purchased this dvd basically because it was the cheapest.
Well, it is 2 weeks later, and I just love it! The instructions are wonderful, and it has a really nice feature in the basic workout section that shows you the correct and incorrect way to do the excersise. The only way I can describe the feeling you get after doing this DVD is this: your body feels like you have been swimming. It is very obvious that your whole body gets worked, especially your midsection. I have a very weak neck (from a car accident years ago) and was initially afraid that I would get neck strain. But to my surprise that has not happened at all. No matter what your level of fitness--I would recommend this DVD!",1026691200,6,759,4.390070921985815
1623317,5,B00005LQ1L,"I rarely write reviews, but I felt I had to this time. I just finished my first Pilates session off of this DVD. I was sweating and my muscles were shaking from the exertion. But I feel incredible right now.
I alternate between running and weight lifting every morning and although I can always tell I've had a good workout, I usually feel so relaxed afterward that I just want to take a nap.
But not with Pilates.
All my muscles are humming. I know that sounds weird, but I don't know how else to describe it. They feel strong but limber, tired but energized. And for the first time in years I don't have this painful little kink between my shoulder blades. These exercizes must have stretched it out.
I hope I get a flatter belly out of this, but if all I get is this sensation after every workout, I'll be thrilled.",1026172800,10,818,4.318181818181818
1623318,5,B00005LQ1L,"This is an excellent beginners guide to the Pilates style of workout.  I am an advanced exerciser who has neglected flexibility in the past, so I decided to see what all of the fuss surrounding Pilates was about.
There are two workouts on the disc.  At this stage I have just being using the Beginner workout 1-2 times per week.  What I love about it is that it is 30 minutes long so I can use it after an hour of cardio for a thorough stretch.
Also, Michelle is friendly and her instruction is excellent.  What I particularly like is the modifications that are shown on the screen during the workout, as many of the moves I do modify to make them easier.
I see this as a workout that I can grow with, gradually trying the more advanced poses.  I have most of the New Method and Method Pilates DVD's also, but as they are more advanced, I am concentrating on learning the correct technique with Michelle first.",1023926400,27,910,4.3609467455621305
1623319,5,B00005LQ1L,"I had to have physical therapy because of back pain.  My physical therapist suggested Pilates as the form of regular exercise that would best suit my needs.  I purchased a copy of this DVD and I am very happy with it.  Dozois provides more instruction on posture and breathing than instructors in other videos (that I have seen).  I don't feel vulnerable to futher injury using this DVD.  It is true that the suggested modifications are provided during the actual exercises, but Dozois suggests that you watch the entire workout at least once before participating.  I've done this and am able to modify the movements without any problems.
An intermediate workout is also included.",1022457600,5,680,4.921052631578948
1623320,5,B00005LQ1L,"After reading some reviews and having some interest in trying out Pilates, I went out to find an instructional dvd. I'm not much into stretching. Really. I hate it as I find it the most boring aspect of any workout. So, then I heard about Pilates and the use of a pilates maching called the Reformer. Hmm, interesting. Almost a combination of stretching and machine work type of workout. Little did I know that it would be darn near impossible to find a pilates video using the maching without first buying the machine itself. But then I find out that there's matwork. Hmm, well, then I figured I'd try that first to see if I like it, and it's just not another boring stretching routine. So, I came across Pilates for Dummies at the store which was the right title and right price for me.
  Now, I consider myself pretty athletic being an avid weightlifter, runner and martial artists. That said, this pilates method is still tough. Didn't know there were other muscles that I never really learned to control under weight training and martial arts training. This workout really emphasizes control and mastery of your ""core"" which are the muscles of your midsection. And like other reviewers said, it really puts your abs on fire and I already have a nice set to begin with. I like how this workout stretches you  out for flexibility but it stil feels like a workout out with its reps and not just static stretching. The dvd itself is simple, but bright and attractive. The instructor gives great advice and explains the methods of eercises clearly. I had a little trouble with the breathing aspect caused it seemed too fast at times or held too long over several reps. I was half expecting it to be more of a yoga like meditative method of breathing. That, plus, when your abs are working it gets a bit harder to breathe but I guess I'll have to workout on that myself. Also, you get both a beginners and intermediate workout in the same dvd for that low of a price? It's definitely a winner for those who are just beginning or curious about Pilates. I'd say pick it up. What have you got to lose except excuses for not exercising?",1018742400,14,2131,4.52987012987013
1623321,5,B00005LQ1L,"This DVD is awesome!  The instructor is pleasant, the instructions are clear, and the pace is great for someone who has never done Pilates before.
After 3 weeks of using this DVD I'm amazed at the toning I have experienced, especially in my abs and legs - and that is just on the beginner section.  The intermediate is even more challenging, but yet still easy and effective.
I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to learn Pilates.",1017705600,11,435,4.636363636363637
1623322,4,B00005LQ1L,"I ordered this DVD because I wanted to try Pilates. I had read the reviews and they all seemed positive. I have to admit that the other reviews were pretty on target. I enjoy this DVD because it is very EASY to follow! I am not completely out of shape, but I am not in shape either and this DVD was totally do-able. For anyone who purchases this watch the DVD *first* before attempting the exercises. Depending on your level of health you may want to only start off with the first 5-6 moves, master them, then slowly add more moves.
The instructor is very good and explains everything very clearly. The reason why I give this DVD 4 stars instead of 5 is because of two reasons: 1) The tips for beginners are shown half way through the move. I believe someone else mentioned this in their review. 2) After you begin to master some of the easier moves you have to sit through her explaination, but that isn't too much of a big deal. One thing I really do like is that the DVD offers an intermediate workout as well. This is great because you don't automatically have to buy a new DVD after you mastered the beginners section. Another nice thing about this DVD is that it is well organized. It is set the way I think a workout DVD should be. The acutal beginner's workout is about 30 minutes. I have noticed improvements in my muscle tone and I have only been using it 3-4 times a week for the last 3 weeks.",1014681600,25,1404,4.262172284644195
1623323,5,B00005LQ1L,"I saw this video at a local discount store and picked it up on a whim. I didn't expect much, but it was cheap, so I grabbed it.
What a pleasant surprise! I use this video regularly and definitely feel and see the results. Michelle Dozios clearly explains and demonstrates every move but is never condescending, irritating or intrusive. She also shows modifications for beginners and advanced exercisers, plus demonstrations of what NOT to do.
I'm not a Pilates expert, but I've seen some of these positions before on other Pilates videos, so I'm guessing they're pretty standard. You'll really feel it in your abs. (I think that overall, Pilates is much more effective -- and interesting -- than crunches for toning abs. I know I see a big difference when I do this video regularly.)
This is purely Pilates. There's no cardio, no weights. I like to alternate this video with cardio and weight work; additionally, you can skip the ab section on your other videos and use this instead.
This is a great intro to Pilates, and you sure can't beat the price. I highly recommend it.",1012780800,758,1075,4.693121693121693
1623324,5,B00005LQ1L,"I just viewed this video for the first time and I love it!  Michelle is very likable and not intimidating.  She introduces the name of the move, demonstrates it, then tells the viewer how many reps they will perform.  The ""Dummies"" icons will come up while reps are being performed that caution the excerciser, give a tip, and a small corner box (tv within tv concept) will show the viewer either a basic modification or a challenge modification.  Michelle will also inform the excerciser of what area the move is helping to strengthen.  Everything is performed on a mat on the floor.  No music used.  Michelle explains at the beginning of the video about the ""core"" and the torso and the importance of stability.  I really enjoyed this video and look forward to doing the workout again!  The 40 minutes flies!!!",1011744000,11,812,4.702127659574468
1623325,4,B00005LQ1L,"It starts off slow with a lot of introduction, but eventually covers 18 Pilates moves at a good pace.
Probably the only real gripe I have - and it's a big one - is that modifications to make the moves easier or more challenging are shown AFTER you've started the exercise - sometimes even halfway through.",1006128000,17,305,4.464285714285714
1623346,5,B00005LQ1L,"This is the answer to all your pilates exercises..ofcourse it does lack some 4-5 exercises i guess..BUT, this DVD is a must.

1623347,5,B00005LQ1L,I love this dvd. It's just long enough to be effective but not so long that I get bored doing it everyday. And it's easy to follow.,1451606400,2,131,3.888888888888889
1623348,5,B00005LQ1L,"I LOVE this workout!! I've been using it on and off for 10 years and I really enjoy it. It's challenging as a workout, but has easy to understand directions. Michelle is a great trainer and makes it easy for beginners. I had severe exercise induced asthma as a child and teen, so this was the perfect thing to help me start strength training and working out every day. Pilates allowed me to gain the muscles and endurance to swim, and swimming led to bicycling and even spinning! Now I'm so happy to say that I worked my way out of my asthma. Anyway, this product was the beginning of that, and I love it and still use it. :)",1447977600,,625,4.216666666666667
1623349,5,B00005LQ1L,"This is first Pilates dvd I bought and have used for over ten years now.  I also have purchased many other good Pilates DVDs but this has become the standard that others are compared against.  In the beginning, the exercise explanations are clear and easily understood.  They also provide an opportunity to rest & catch your breath as a beginner.  As you become more fit, you can skip from one exercise to the next by using your remote's ""Next"" button.  This allows you to use the beginning of the explanation as a prompt for you to go ahead & do the exercise on your own which you will know how to do by then.  In this manner, you can get a pretty decent workout in a short amount of time.  The exercises are the standard ones you will see in most beginning & intermediate Pilates DVDs & at times you might want to substitute Michelle Dozois' version of a particular exercise in another DVD that you may be watching.",1445644800,2,917,4.390532544378698

1623369,5,B00005LQ1L,"This is my favorite dvd for pilates.  I love the explanation of each exercise, the option to make it easier or more difficult depending on your ability, the setting seems to be a gymnasium which I appreciate over the tacky 80s look or outside where the wind and background noise makes it a chore to listen to instructions.  Michelle has a calm, yet cheerful voice and makes every movement precise.

I love this video enough to give it as a gift to my brother who has back issues to recover from - he is greatly lacking in core strength.  Also, while my daughter was recovering from knee issues - a result of a weak core and no hip strength despite the sport workout - this workout was a great recovery technique for her.  It is nice to follow along with Michelle but should you find that you are traveling and cannot play this video, once you have committed the routine (there are two) to memory, you can do this anywhere.",1411171200,2,922,4.4

Some of the exercises are not for beginners and I think they should tell you that.  Some are in the ""Intermediate"" level if you look at the mat series by Joseph Pilates.  When I buy a workout video for ""dummies"" I am thinking it's truly for a beginner.  Also, I wish SO much that they would give another workout option showing JUST the workout.... so that you could go through it faster once you know it more.  Every time you play this, you have to stop and listen for every single instruction over and over again.....so it takes way too long once you know how to do it.

It is challenging and I had to work at it for several weeks but boy has  it made a difference.  I am 65-year-old female who was generally fairly fit but I did not have adequate core strength.

I couldn't have been happier - the moves are explained slowly, in great detail.  I am gaining strength and flexibility, and am really learning to relax.

I then tried&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pilates-Workout-for-Dummies/dp/B00005NRNG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pilates Workout for Dummies</a>&nbsp;(I thought I would alternate it with the Yoga tape) and must say I was disappointed.  I knew something was wrong as soon as I heard Michelle Dozois.  She's very pleasant, quite chirpy in fact.  But she speaks way too fast.  I just did not get the calm, relaxed feeling as i did from the yoga tape.

She starts by rapidly explaining the basics of pilates, ie, how to align the 'box' (torso, abdomen, hips) properly, as this is key to pilates.  As a person with poor coordination, I couldn't really follow what she was saying, and started getting discouraged.  Great, I thought, I can't even align my body right, how am I going to do the exercises?

Not very well was the answer.  Dozois speeds through the exercises (18 moves in less than 40 minutes!).  While many reviewers here feel her explanations are just right, and others feel they are too much, I share the opinion of the few who feel there is too little, and what is presented is presented way too quickly.  I couldn't really understand much of what she was talking about and demonstrating, and thus couldn't do the moves properly.  I really am a dummy when it comes to workouts.

Also, as other reviewers mention, easier modifications are presented not at the beginning of each move, but in the middle or towards the end.  By then, I either had sore muscles or stopped altogether because I was discouraged.

I quit trying in middle of the workout, watched the rest of the video, and then went back to my yoga workout.  I haven't used this dvd since.

If you want rock hard abs and buns of steel, and have at least a little coordination (ie, you aren't a true dummy when it comes to workouts) you'll like this tape.  However, if you are a true dummy, and therefore need to move quite slowly, and if you want to relax while gaining strength and flexibility, then this tape may not work for you.",1175990400,16,3100,5.853006681514477

My sister had purchased this, and so I bit the bullet and bought it to try myself.

I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was for someone who is as out of shape as myself to be able to get into it.  She shows the exercise beforehand and then you do it with her.  She even shows you how to do it if you can't quite get your leg up all the way yet (like me).

Also, she emphasizes that it is all about quality, not quantity, and she goes slowly enough with pauses in between the exercises that if you do need to stop and breathe, you're not feeling guilty for missing something (a big problem with me).

One tip, and she mentions this-watch it before you try it so that you know what you're getting into.

 This is a very well put together Pilates program that covers a nice range of the Pilates exercise Repertoire (including a thorough side kick series).

 Michelle Dozios is a very likeable teacher who gives clear instructions and inspiring demonstration of the exercises.

 Its takes just under 30 minutes to complete (once past the intro) and I find it to be a very enjoyable program to practice with.

 While this is a good beginner program (though to me it's probably  more intermediate in terms of how challenging it is and the inclusion of some more intermediate exercises), I would still recommend getting something like Stott Pilates Basics first because there is a lot more detailed instruction for someone brand new to Pilates.

 In Pilates, it is super critical to understand the basic principles because you can easily strain your neck or back if you are careless and try to force yourself, I found that the Stott Basics was the overall best program for that of the programs I have.

 All that being said, this Pilates program is a very well done and enjoyable practice that in my opinion won't grow obsolete even as you get more advanced because it can always be a nice program to mix into your exercise rotation for variety.

I really love the way Michelle Dozios paces the practice as well. She moves at a speed which is slow enough let you control and really feel each movement(but it never drags).

 I would also recommend getting a good Pilates book such as Alycea Ungaro's ""Pilates, Body In Motion"" or Brooke Silers ""The Pilates Body"".

The first thing that came to my mind was that it's a very do-able routine. The exercises are not too difficult, and choices are given if you want easier or more challenging. Michelle Dozois does a good job describing the correct movement/technique and breathing.

Before you know it, the 30 minutes are over because there's variety in the types of exercises and number of repetitions you do with each. The next day after my first Pilates workout, I could tell I had worked my core muscles, but nothing was sore or stiff. After using it even three times, I noticed that my core muscles are starting to get stronger and that my balance has improved (e.g., when I'm doing a fitness ball routine).

I was also pleasantly surprised that there is an intermediate routine on the DVD too. I haven't reached that point yet, but from the index, it looks as though some of those exercises are similar to the beginner ones (probably using the more challenging positions), but there are also some new ones too.

I wish that there was a segment on the DVD that is just the workout, without the explanation in between.

I have been using this dvd for 2 months now, and can do all the beginner's exercises, even the ones I thought I couldn't do.  Mainly I use this  to unkink myself after a good night's sleep.  Afterwards, I have no problem using my treadmill, and find the combination of the two, to be both rewarding and relaxing.  This is a really great buy, and well worth trying.  Without the Pilates, the treadmill was almost guaranteed to give me pains in my leg, but with it, I can make it through the day without my knee and back giving me problems.  I was pleasantly surprised at the enjoyment and sense of well-being that I get from the program.  The instructor is laid back, pleasant, and offers helpful hints.  You can actually see what she is doing at all times, and she explains things very well.  My son's girlfriend recommended I try Pilates, and I am so thankful that she did.  I had this for a month before I tried it, being convinced I couldn't do it, while my knee felt worse and worse.  When I finally tried it, I really liked it, which surprised me, since I like cardio, but generally don't do well with regular exercise regimens.  Aerobics is out because of the injury, and in fact, step aerobics was the cause of the bad knee.  This has been a real joy to do, and I am not tired of it.  I am taking it slow, and it may be another couple of months before I work up to the intermediate exercise.  There is no hurry, and I am enjoying the journey and the sense of accompolishment.

1623491,5,B00005LQ1L,"I'm 27 years old and have never, in my whole life, been ""in shape"" or even close to it. I've just always been utterly terrible at all forms of exercise. (I mean, seriously. They put me in remedial gym class.) I've never managed a push-up or pull-up in my entire life, even after forty-five minutes, five days a week for the last seven years of public school. (Oh, and if you're wondering-I'm a tad overweight, but not obese.)

That said, even I was starting to get restless with a 9-to-5 office job. About the only form of exercise I don't hate is walking (or hiking), but that was getting boring-I live in a small town, and once I had memorized where the sidewalks were uneven, I started wondering if there might be something else I didn't hate. I've always distrusted pilates because I hate fads, but my sister recommended it so I figured, well, it's only a $12 DVD.

After reading a *lot* of reviews here on Amazon, I decided to start with this DVD. (I admit it, it was partly so I wouldn't need to buy equipment.) When it finally came, I opened it right away and watched it for the first time.

The person on the DVD, Michelle Duzois, is fairly perky and obviously in good shape, but not obnoxiously so. I don't know quite how to phrase it, but her attitude seemed to be ""of course you can do this"" and not ""there's something wrong with you if you can't."" By presenting all the variations (regular, beginner and challenging) in the same tone of voice and having her demonstrate all of them (including the things that are wrong), I felt like there wasn't the message that there was something wrong with you if you couldn't do the regular variation (as opposed to DVDs where a different person is doing each variation, and they say ""Well, if you can't do what I'm doing, you can try what Kristy's doing instead"").

The video had a nice introduction to pilates that was six minutes long, which I felt gave me useful information without overloading me. The basic routine then begins and is about twenty-seven minutes long (she tells you to only do the first several if it's your first time). I can't vouch for whether this is or isn't ""real"" pilates, but I can say that the routine went smoothly from one pose to the next (exercises are shown as separate scenes, but mostly the scenes start from where the last one left off), didn't focus on any one body part until it was exhausted, got my heart rate up (possibly it wouldn't do this for everyone) and showed good transitions (I wish she would describe the transitions more, though-sometimes she says, ""Okay, now bend your knees like this, then extend them like this"" but other times she just does it, so I didn't really see how she was doing them at first). Some of the exercises were a little uncomfortable at first, but after just a few times I could tell I was more flexible (still have a long way to go, though!). I definitely felt like I was getting a workout-sweating and really feeling the stretches-but when I finished, I didn't feel exhausted. I felt energized and, most impressively, like I wanted to keep doing pilates until I could do it right. (I can assure you I never felt that way about push-ups.)

The video itself has a black background with a large box with Michelle on a purple mat [how tall is she? Her mat looks the same size as mine, but somehow when she stretches out her whole body is still on the mat, whereas if my head is on the mat, the other end comes about to my knees] on a wooden floor, and then the black area is where variations are demonstrated or text appears. Most helpful to me are the places where she demonstrates (in the black part of the screen) what not to do during an exercise, with a big ""X"" through it. As in the For Dummies books, there are also tips, reminders and other symbols that appear. She demonstrates each exercise, then does the repetitions (usually 6 or 10) while periodically reminding you when to inhale/exhale or exhorting you to make sure to really stretch or not let your back arch or to pull your navel in. To me, if I'm not doing those things it's a good reminder, and if I am, it feels like confirmation that I'm doing it right.

I suppose the video is a bit boring-just one person in bike shorts and a tank top, on a mat, on a wooden floor, with no music. For me, anything more elaborate visually would be intimidating, and music would be distracting.

I have to say, I love it when she says, ""all right, we're going to do our last three exercises now."" It's not like some sort of scorekeeping-she doesn't do it every time-but it makes me feel like the end is in sight.

It annoys me at the end when she says, ""You did a great job!"" because I always think, ""How would you know?"" But maybe that's just me. That's my only complaint.

I've watched the intermediate routine (not tried it!) and it felt like something that I will, in fact, be able to do eventually-and more importantly, that I want to get to the point of being able to do it.",1129593600,46,4958,4.403930131004367

1623499,5,B00005LQ1L,"About a year ago, I ordered ""plates Workout for Dummies"" from Amazon. Although I've since moved on to more advanced plates workouts, I still use ""plates Workout for Dummies"" as a refresher course in proper plates form.

Michele dozes, the incredibly perky instructor, provides clear instructions for eighteen plates exercises. She is meticulous about pointing out what each part of your body should be doing as well as slowly demonstrating each move. As a beginner, I had a tendency to start each exercises well, then slowly fall apart from lack of attention to each part of my body; pop-up windows during the exercises, with reminders about proper form and common mistakes, are helpful in this area. After using ""plates Workout for Dummies"" for a few weeks, I felt much more confident about my form, and I started to understand why each exercise was so effective.

No matter what your fitness level is, this DVD can accommodate you. As she demonstrates each exercise, dozes also presents ways to modify the movement, making it easier or more challenging as needed. The flexibility-challenged should not be worried, and the exercise gurus will not be bored; this is a good introduction for all.

""plates Workout for Dummies"" includes only mat exercises, so if you are unsure that you'll enjoy plates, this is an inexpensive introduction; there is no need for weights or other plates equipment. The exercises are well-varied, and movements that impact all majors areas are included; I personally found this quite nice, because when a particularly weak area of my body made a certain exercise difficult, it was easier to avoid discouragement.

Although most will probably quickly grow out of ""plates Workout for Dummies,"" it is extremely valuable as an introduction and as a refresher course--a must for every plates DVD collection.",1119744000,14,1830,5.09

I own the Windsor series and about a dozen others, including videos with Romana Kryznowska.  Michelle Dozois doesn't talk above your head.  Her demonstrations are clean, precise, and easy to follow.

I like that each section lists the series of exercises -- in their proper order -- considered basic, intermediate and advanced.  Beginners can start with the first section of the video, and work on perfecting these before moving into more intermediate or the advanced section. She makes the more advanced moves (i.e. leg pull front and leg pull down) look easy - which can be deceptive (and potentially frustrating?) to people new to Pilates.  Hopefully this will not deter individuals from continuing to work toward the more advanced exercises

Of course, I would highly recommend that anyone interested in Pilates attend a class with a qualified instructor as finances or availabilty allows.  Use this video to supplement your pilates/fitness routine.

1623501,4,B00005LQ1L,"Overall I'd give this 3 1/2 stars, but I rounded up.

Strengths: tips on neutral spine and breathing, which I think are essential to anyone beginning Pilates, but when you have watched these a couple of times, you can just skip to chapter 3 of the DVD for the workout.  However, there are pointers before each exercise which are very useful for the beginner but awkward to fast forward through.

Michele is a good instructor, not grating or annoying like some others.

Weaknesses:

Some of the poses are not exactly appropriate for someone completely new to exercise.  I was shocked by the last two exercises, which I find extremely difficult though I've been doing Pilates for several months.  One of them was you had to get into a push-up or ""Plank"" position (not the girly kind) and take turns lifting up your legs.  For the next, you had to do the opposite, facing upward and holding your body up with just your arms, then take turns lifting up your legs.  Think of it like a triangle...your arms forming the short side and your body in a perfect diagonal.  Well let's just say my arms are the weakest part of my body and cannot support my weight.  I think there are several other exercises she could have included that would be much more effective and appropriate for a beginner than these intermediate ones.

As has been mentioned, modifications are shown halfway through the reps, where they really don't do any good.  If you need to modify, you should be doing so from the beginning.

Although it includes an ""intermediate"" workout on the DVD, these have several different exercises than the beginner workout. In some cases they're harder, but in other cases they don't seem harder. Sometimes it doesn't make sense which exercises are considered ""beginner"" and which ""intermediate."" Anyway, I would like to see a flowing beginner workout that does not include the instruction before each exercise.  It seems like whenever I find a workout that does not include excessive instruction before each exercise, the exercises are too difficult for me to do properly.",1111363200,11,2067,4.81586402266289

Michelle is great; she's in shape but not absurdly so, and very calm and assuring as she gives instructions, even telling me when to breathe.

I like spending time with her, and after a few weeks, I began to have much better posture thanks to newly acquired abs. I am now begining to foray into the 'more challenging' modes, which are very much so.

There are two parts to the DVD: beginning and intermediate.  The work out for beginners is only about 30 minutes total, and I'm sure the intermediate one is as well.  So it's perfet for a quick and effective workout.  The workout for beginners explains the important points to know before you practice Pilates.  It's great because you can just skip by the introduction after you've seen it once or twice and understand it and get straight to the workout.
The instructor is very clear and concise about each exercise and shows you not only the correct way to do each exercise but also what is not correct.  That is very helpful knowing what NOT to do while working out.  The exercises go very quickly and are very effective.  I can't wait to work my way up to the intermediate level!

The foot positions for the Basic version of the Hundreds were not slightly turned out (toes pointed, upper inner thighs squeezed together) like they were in the intermediate.  Additionally, the camera didn't move in the basic version, yet moved around a lot more during intermediate, giving the viewer a better perspective of form.  i actually rented this from a library before buying it, in addition to reading various reviews.
i like how you can actually hear michelle breathing & working hard, so it's not as intimidating as many other videos who make it look easy and that totally psyches you out. i also love how they show you common mistakes and give you options to make it easier or more challenging.
i'm a newcomer to pilates.  i've tried to do all kinds of work on my thighs, buns...a girl's best friends...and after only about 10 reps of the bun & thigh exercises i was seriously feeling the burn.  now, keep in mind that i have muscular legs naturally. i work out on a stepper and have done all kind of calisthenics to get to that effective burning point, but this gets there almost immediately. pilates was a genius.  i've only done this workout about 5 or 6 times and i can already feel my powerhouse tightening.  i make sure that i workout before i do this dvd mainly as a warmup.  considering all the flexibility involved, (which i'm totally not) i'd definitely recommend warming up cardio-wise as well as good, proper stretching so you don't end up ""whacking something out.""
overall, this is a great workout that's fun, easy, and rewarding, and great for a newcomer.  Michelle is unintimidating and encouraging.  as much as the instructions get old, they kinda don't....you have to always keep proper form in mind & you have to make sure you do it right or else you defeat the purpose.",1078358400,20,2022,4.68361581920904

One of my errors is not keeping the abdominal area still when exercising because I did not notice that. After using ""Pilates for Dummies"", I realized that mistake because during the workout time, Michelle repeatedly reminded me to keep the abdominal area still.

It's very mediocre. Like most tapes out there, there's too much time taken by the instructor teaching and demonstrating before every exercise in the routine. This is ok if you're a real beginner, but after the first 5-6 times through, or if you have some experience and familiarity, it gets very old. Once you forward through, you've lost the flow (picking up and putting down the remote a zillion times) and only get about 20 minutes of workout.
The routines themselves are pretty good for newbies or out of shape people. The intermediate workout could really use more challenging exercises and less instruction between each one.

There are more authoritative DVDs, such as those from Classical Pilates, but they are more of a reference/documentary than a tutorial.  This, however, is a DVD to actually exercise with, rather than one to simply study.
It has background music which can be shut off.  This background music, however, is extremely tasteful.  I'm picky about music, and I found that this music did not detract at all, and might even have enhanced my exercise experience.
One thing to note is that the ""Beginner"" workout contains more exercises, and more difficult exercises, than some people might like.  I'm in fair shape, so I enjoyed this.  But it might be discouraging for some people.
There is also an ""intermediate"" workout with more exercises, and less talk between them.  I'm looking forward to it -- by the time I do it, I'm sure it will bring me closer to the ideal Pilates ""flow"" or groove.
The pacing is wonderful.  I found this DVD to be a perfect compromise between a too-slow, all-talk-and-not-enough-movement (GAIM Ana Caban) video, and a too-fast, perfect-form-but-not-enough-explanation (Classical Pilates) DVD.
Each workout is broken into tracks so you can easily skip or revisit any particular exercise.  This is NOT true of the Classical Pilates DVD, where there is one track per WORKOUT.

My only complaint is I wish she would count out the reps (she only counts the first rep)- it's hard to keep an eye on the video and also stay in alignment. Also, I know that using the video can't be quite as good as having an instructor there to check that I'm doing it right, but as I've taken dance lessons for 20 years, I'm pretty in tune to how my body's lined up. The workout is only about 20 minutes, so it's good if I don't have a lot of time to work out. I would like to look at some longer and possibly more intense workout in the future.

I also feel she left a few important explanations out--How to breathe--from the chest, not the abdomen, because you 'hold' the abdominal muscles tightly in (navel to spine) while concentrating on the correct form of the excersize; the Pilates stance, a VERY important part of all the different excersizes....Also, the hints and wrong ways to do the movements pop up while you are trying to concentrate on the excersize--very distracting as most of Pilates relys on breath, concentration, and quality of movement.

Despite the fact that I have a dance background, I had lost much of my flexibility and I didn't want something that would be too difficult. A friend of mine recommended ""Pilates for Dummies"". I was a little skeptical, but after reading the reviews here and seeing that this, like many other Pilates DVDs, wasn't overpriced, I decided to give it a try and I am glad I did.
The workout begins with a brief history of Pilates and explains some terms that are used throughout the DVD. Next, the workout begins. I cannot say enough good things about Michelle Dozois as the instructor. She explains things very simply and outlines some common mistakes. Breathing is an important part of Pilates and you are told when to inhale and exhale throughout all the different exercises. My personal favorite feature is that it gives you modifications on almost all the exercises, either to make them more difficult for the accomplished people or easier for those of us who need a slower start. Plus, there is an intermediate workout as well. I haven't tried this yet, but I have watched it through and it has the same merits as the beginner's workout.

The intermediate gives some instruction, but not as detailed, being that it is assumed that you are familiar with Pilates.

Pilates has intrigued me for awhile; I have one DVD but just never got around to doing it after the first time for one reason or another.  I bought this earlier in February 2003, and have been doing it this week.  I like it!  Some of the moves are kind of difficult at this time, but I fully expect my abilities to improve as I slim down and become more toned.
As others have said, this doesn't have a lot of glitz or music, and the instructor is the only one you see (though I haven't watched the more advanced sections yet, so this may be different in them).  That's okay!  The instructor seems very personable, and I don't ""feel bad"" because I can't do everything she's doing; she encourages you many times to do just what you can, and to take it easy if you find the moves a bit tough at first.  Soothing voice, an unassuming manner, and very good at explaining things.  It dawned on me the other night that she resembles Courtney Thorne-Smith!

Occasionally I had to skip one exercise, but most were fine on my aching back.  I like the whole 'dummies' idea when it comes to a new exercise type because I am a dummy in Pilates; and this workout was challenging enough without being too easy.

I am certainly no expert on Pilates, but Pilates for Dummies really introduces the form for each exercise and modifications for each one to suit your needs.  Michelle Dozios is a thoughtful instructor, and she demonstrates and explains each movement to you very carefully (with the beginner in mind).  There are 18 exercises altogether, and each has no more than 10 reps.  Some can be challenging, but you will definitely feel stronger and longer at the end.

The DVD comes with an introduction to each movement in the beginner section, and an Intermediate section that allows you to move quickly through the exercises as pilates is meant to be done.

This video is empowering for a broad range of people... from those just learning to even pronounce the word ""exercise"" to the professional athlete.

Pilates is not just about how to move your body. It involves other factors that you would not notice without an instructor pointing them out to you (breathing, focus, resistance).

 This tape is like a parable. The first few times through, you will most likely be focusing on ""am I doing this right?"" After you are familiar with the actual movements, you can move to the next level by focusing on resistance, keeping your body tight, and breathing deeply. After that, you will notice your posture, strength, and body-position awareness improving.

I think people who find this tape too-easy/ boring/ unchallenging are probably the same ones who jerk their bodies doing sit-ups and/or do not put a lot of emphasis on form.

 As the instructor on this video informs, Pilates is a mind-body exercise... And if you do not use the mind, this video gets old fast.

I recommend this video to EVERYONE interested in beginning or improving in Pilates. Once you internalize all the factors covered in this video, all other Pilates videos and programs will make MUCH MORE SENSE and become A LOT EASIER TO IMPLEMENT.",1041552000,18,1306,4.882352941176471

The video also gives you a more ""basic"" and a more challenging way of doing the exercises, so you can modify your workout accordingly if you are a beginner and as you become stronger. I would definitely recommend this video to anyone!",1030579200,6,451,4.65
1623587,5,B00005LQ1L,"I had never tried Pilates before buying this program and was worried that I would have problems keeping up with the instructor (Michelle Dozois), or hurt myself doing the poses incorrectly.  This workout is well organized and the motions are communicated very well.  Of course I can not perform them nearly as well as she can--because some are challenging for me--but in a good way.  This exercise tape fits any mood I'm in, even when I think I'm feeling lazy!",1029369600,4,460,4.725
1623588,5,B00005LQ1L,"I have only used the beginner section, but I've been using it for over a month and really enjoy doing the Pilates in the morning.  I'm not a young chick in great shape, so this is plenty challenging and a good workout for me.",1028851200,3,225,4.113636363636363
1623589,4,B00005LQ1L,"The recent hype on Pilates intrigued me and so I decided to try it out, thanks to the great reviews from the Amazon web-site. Yes, this is a great introduction to those who don't know anything about Pilates. I tried just watching the DVD the first time but found myself doing the moves on the couch itself. When I used a mat, I found that some of the initial moves were a lot harder and challenging. I felt very refreshed after the workout and surprisingly, a little sore the next day in a few places.
So, pl. don't push yourself the first time although it may seem easy; just stick to the non-challenging moves and you will be fine. A great beginner DVD for pilates!!!",1028505600,6,669,4.36
1623590,5,B00005LQ1L,"I brought this tape not knowing what to expect about a month ago. I figured it was time to try something new, since I became quite tired of just weight training 3x a week. Luckily for me Pilates for Dummies has turned out to be my new favorite video! Its actually made me look forward to working out regularly! Yes I said it! All you need is a mat and a towel and you're off for 30 minutes of 'core' conditioning. Which after the first try you will surely feel the next day! I also really like the instructor Michelle-not to bubbly to annoy, and not to dry to bore you to death. In fact I enjoy her so much I'm ready to move on to an intermediate tape of hers-Breakthru Core-Conditioning.  Good luck Pilates Dummies, it works for me and hopefully for you too!",1028332800,8,759,4.23448275862069

1623592,5,B00005LQ1L,"i bought this baed on the positive reviews, and let me tell ya, those people weren't lying. this is a great dvd for people beginning with pilates. she breaks everything down, and she has alternate ways of doing the exercises depending on your level.
the cool thing is that u get a great deal because when u are ready for more advanced workout shes got another section that is without all the pop-ups and goes a bit faster. therefore u don't have to buy another advanced dvd (but if u do, i like ana caban. nice rich color).
the dvd quality is really good, and the pop-ups don't really bother me like they did other reviewers. also the problem some people had where they said that she doesnt give the alternate until u are halfway thru the exercise, wrent a problem for me after the 2nd or 3rd time i watched it. but u should watch ur dvd before u do it anyway. at least that's what i do.
these exercises look really easy, but the next day my abs were feeling it. so don't sleep on this. who needs winsor pilates? the movements are basically the same in all pilates dvd's ive found. there might be a little more instruction in one, or the scenery might be a little better, but for the most part they pi;ates moves are the same.
another good one is pilates conditioning for weight loss with suzanne deason.
