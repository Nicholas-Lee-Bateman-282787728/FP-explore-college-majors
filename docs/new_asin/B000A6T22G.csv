2367911,5,B000A6T22G,"I will never forget watching the very first SNL broadcast, essentially """"by accident"". If you want to pick up on the attitude and edgyness of the time...get this ""Best of John Belushi"" DVD. He was unpredictable and uncanny.  What would he do next? A special and complicated talent. These SNL ""Best of's"" are lots of fun and have a knack for showcasing the moments that had the most bang for the buck. Samurai, Joe Cocker (hilarious over the top Belushi moment, but I'd forgotten how well John SINGS the part!), SNL Update Commentaries, a priceless full performance by the Blues Brothers, and much more. For me, though, the most important parts of this DVD are the incredible extras, including John's screen test  (Brando, etc.), and an appearance with Dan Aykroyd on the Today Show (early 80's) which is one of the more compelling insights into Belushi's off screen personality, and some obvious discomfort in that setting (being interviewed), so Dan takes charge. There is also a great and frank ""tribute/discussion"" with John's wife and SNL team members. I think you'll find it illuminating. (Interesting side-bar: The photo of John Belushi on the cover of the DVD I received is different than the one shown here at Amazon.).",1376006400,2,1227,4.9227053140096615

He didn't reach great heights in film beyond Animal House, but I imagine the hilarious movies that wouldve been made was he still around. His chemistry with Aykroyd was amazing, they made great comedic partners and best friends. I found it revealing in the Extras that he had difficulty dealing with the attention fame brings.

2367987,4,B000A6T22G,"One of the wonders of the original five year run of Saturday Night Live was how it served as a launching pad for so many entertainers.  Clearly, John Belushi was one of these.  His performances in The Blues Brothers and Animal House, to name his two biggest hits during that period, were classics that go beyond the slapstick moniker.

This little gem, SNL - Best of John Belushi, is best described as ""a taste of Belushi"" (John, not Jim).  As a regular on SNL those first five years, he developed characters and comedic performances that still are popular today (the Blues Brothers).  Others went splat (the Bee Band).  His athleticism, facial expressions, and attention to detail (note the Joe Cocker spoof/imitation) were his strengths.

This collection has some favorites... his imitations of rocker Joe Cocker, actress Elizabeth Taylor (the portly version), the Hulk, and his appearances on the SNL news program.  This collection also contains the piece of him as an old man visiting the graves of his former SNL colleagues.  Ironically, he was the first to die.

This DVD is a great bargain as a sampler.  If you like what you see, start collecting the complete SNL seasons (seasons 1 and 2 are out at the time of this review).",1201996800,3,1233,4.796208530805687

I read other of the coments and saying that they should have put more skits on the DVD and I agree Iv downloaded some clips off limewire and I love it, he was great. SNL should do what they did for Will Ferrell make volumes Belushi is 20x better then Ferrel and desierves more Best of DVD's",1201219200,,435,3.9545454545454546
2367989,4,B000A6T22G,"I simply didn't laugh out loud (except for ""Little Chocolate Donuts."")  Everyone should RENT this, but must OWN ""The Blues Brothers.""  Belushi on SNL was monumental in establishing some out-there American humor, but this collection has nothing on Monty Python.  I think early SNL was more about the excitement of being a late-night show with funny people rather than actually being chock full of 'knock-you-outta-your seat' laughs.  I see this more as a blueprint for what he did in 'Blues Brothers'--every single nuance he gave in that movie was sheer brilliance--rather than itself being the definitive John Belushi.",1176249600,,618,5.275510204081633

2367991,4,B000A6T22G,"Yes, this is a funny DVD and John Belushi really was an amazing character with both comic antics (eye brows!), mannerisms (H & L BROCK Tax Consultant with reason#3, ""We lie for you...) and musical performances (Joe Cocker!!!!).  However, consumers want the COMPLETE skits rather than what someone judges to be the BEST skits.  Even if all seasons of SNL are released, the COMPLETE skits would sell as many of his comedic performances touched so many people in different ways.  One Flew Over the Hornets Nest...... butter, butter with Raquel Welch as the infamous Nurse.",1170374400,,569,4.968421052631579
2367992,3,B000A6T22G,"I don't know if I am just older now or if they didn't choose John's best, but this lacks the humor that I remember. I laughed harder when I was younger. I found him cute in various skits, but there was nothing on here that was gut wrenching funny like I remember it. I remember my father walking in on my brother and I and saying, ""What do you you find so funny?"" and us telling him to go back to bed, that it was a generational thing. Now I wonder if it was an age thing. I am over 35 now-- does that make a difference? I feel very old. I still like this, however and showed my teenagers who weren't too enamored with it but did compare John's eyebrow raising to Jack Black and found certain nuances worthy of observation to take to acting class.",1169510400,7,747,4.08843537414966
2367993,4,B000A6T22G,"I only saw one reviewer mention the VHS but, for some reason they failed to mention the following....the DVD is incomplete!!!

Like some of the other reviewers, I was really looking forward to this being released on DVD. I bought the VHS way back in 1983(so old it's in mono!!!) and was greatly looking forward to hearing the musical performances in 5.1!

But....lo & behold... this isn't the entire VHS that was originally released!!! And among the missing parts is THE major reason I was looking forward to the DVD - the single greatest Blues Brothers performance (in my opinion)....B Movie Boxcar Blues!!! I was so disgusted that I have yet to do a skit by skit comparison so am not sure what else is missing but I am certain some comedy skits are missing as well.

I also soon realized that there are many new skits as well and one of them is the Samurai Night Fever skit with OJ Simpson. Since this wasn't on the original VHS it can only be an editing decision made after the OJ fiasco. As another reviewer noted, we definitely could have done without this skit and I hope OJ didn't get any proceeds from its addition. In fact the only reason I can think of for its inclusion is the demand for more Samurai skits. But they could have picked from many others, the 2 skits with Frank Zappa conducting his band & The Samurai musician are both priceless and rarely aired.

Also, I agree with the reviewer who stated there are better Joe Cocker skits too. In addition to the one mentioned with Joe himself, there is also a hilarious skit with Belushi doing his impersonation along side a female singer (I forget who....Ann Margaret?) and she ends up laughing so hard she can't finish the song!!

Bottom line....if you are a fan of Belushi by all means get this!! I only wish it contained ALL the material from the VHS. I guess I'll have to wait on the appropriate season DVD box set (or get the Blues Brothers DVD) to get my beloved B Movie Boxcar Blues in 5.1 hi-fi!!",1168905600,29,1968,4.455555555555556

2368026,2,B000A6T22G,Belushi's crowning jewel perfomance in my opinion is when he played opposite Monty Python's Michael Palin as the MANLY  Captain Ned in the Miles Cowperthwaite skits. They are both absent from this DVD nor on any SNL video I can find.,1144368000,10,233,4.682926829268292

2368029,2,B000A6T22G,"What a waste of money, not to mention of all the clips they could have shown. My family was totally dissappointed as with some of the other SNL Best of Clips. Wouldn't reccommend it.",1135468800,10,182,4.382352941176471
2368030,4,B000A6T22G,"I was a college student in the late 1970's, and back then, every dorm room and frat house on campus settled down at 11:30 on Saturday nights, so that everyone could gather 'round the tube to watch the original SNL. Man was that show funny, especially John Belushi.

This DVD does an admirable but insufficient job of conveying Belushi's comic genius. A few of the sketches, such as Cheeseburger, haven't withstood the test of time, and left me wondering why I thought he was so funny. But then he really shines on others, such as Samurai Night Fever, Godfather Vito Corleone in therapy, and his Joe Cocker rendition of ""With A Little Help From My Friends,"" which is so dead-on that on one episode of SNL (NOT the version on this disc) Joe himself comes out on stage in the middle of Belushi's performance, to the astonishment of the audience who thought Joe was already the one performing. But the skit that still has me laughing out loud every time I see it is Belushi's impersonation of Elizabeth Taylor choking on chicken in the middle of an interview. I know it's morbid, but it's oddly sublime, and no other comic could have pulled it off. In fact, no other comic would have even attempted it, and that's what made Belushi one-of-a-kind.

The main reason I'm giving this DVD only four stars is because the run time is a scant 78 minutes, and surely the SNL archives hold enough Belushi gems that they could have put out two or three hours worth. Nevertheless, this is as close as you can get to seeing Belushi in his prime.",1134950400,37,1528,4.532608695652174
2368031,5,B000A6T22G,"as with the golden age of film or the early days of rock, the early days of Sat. Night live are the ones that most people miss through out the shows history. John Belushi, Dan Akroyd, Gilda Radner, Garret Morris, Bill Murray, or the ""not ready for prime time players"" set the standard for a medium that had not existed before them. All the classic J.B. sketches are here, and for my money are the best. He was bigger than life, over the top and a true talent. Long Live John Belushi.",1129075200,5,483,4.260869565217392
2368032,5,B000A6T22G,"To begin with, the DVD has everything it ought too.  The extra's are just right, the selected scenes (pardon my not existing in 1975) all had me chuckling, and the synergistic aspect of Belushi's time and stage presence at SNL can be felt.

Only those who had the pleasure of working on SNL (Lemmings to boot) with John Belushi will ever surely know who and what he really was, and for those who are adoring SNL fanaticals, this DVD is a preface.  There's something eerily haunting and sentimental about this DVD, although SNL avoids that as much as possible in most of what they do (aside from the 25th anniversery).  Seeing John Belushi's ""Schiller's Reel"" was, um, disturbing but still hit the mark: ""Why me???? Cause...I'm a dancer!""

I must say the two skits, know this is unfair to state but will go ahead doing so anyways, that stand out most in my mind are the ""NBC Star Trek Cancellation"" (Chevy Chase is brilliant in this one as well) and John Belushi singing ""The Wonder Years"" theme song, well before the show ever was.  Another funnybone was the ""Super Hero Halloween Get Together"" with Belushi as The Hulk; and who can forget the breaking the bread over the forehead in addition to slashing down hunks of ham from wall nearby ""Samurai Warrior"" (have I seen real life renditions of this on Food Network...oh wait that's regular chef's on patrol finding stardom not through how the food's prepared, but its scrumtrulescent - Will Ferrel's coining - well, scrumtrulescence!).

Above all, my favorite snippet of the DVD in its entirety is the extra featuring John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd on the Today Show, where they both come across as engaging, bright, and genuinely funny.  Aykroyd really shines, as you get to see the young Dan Aykroyd full of energy and charisma.  Gene Siskell asks them each toward the end of the segment what they would desire for a one final meal, Belushi: cottage cheese & pineapple plate; Aykroyd: grapefruit juice and celerey (sounds good, I think I'll have to try some)!  Also, if recalled correctly, was Aykroyd selling ""Spies Like Us"" which came out years later to have he and Belushi as original leads?

And to think, I grew up loving ""The Great Outdoors"" and ""Ghost Busters"" and never had a clue of how close Aykroyd was to Belushi or how many blazingly genius pieces of comedy they pulled off together, in many instaces, on SNL.

There comes a mixed feeling when watching classic moments like these, perhaps a surge of sadness, what with all the horrors worldwide that have happened since 1975 dating SNL's inception, a time when great people were doing creative and downright uplifting things; namely making millions cross-country laugh to a whole new tune.  That's where the celebrity of SNL stands the test of time, and that's what gives one an inkling of hope for the so-called ""New Comedy"" even though it's always buzzing about us, with the majority never heard (some highschool prank) and some never spoken (your grandmothers kitchen).  Sure change is a good thing, and time certainly passes, but because I look back on these skits from never having seen their original airing, writing, and rehearsing, I bear the right to say this much: Long live comedy and acting, and God save us from ""24 hour cable news"" and ""reality T.V.""  Just when did the talented and the erudite lose out to commonality and repetition?  Finally, a personal debt of gratitude to all those mad minds who made SNL a national monument reaching like a beacon straight to higher places!  Amen. RIP John Belushi.... no, LIP (live in peace for all you in Rio Linda) everyone else.",1128729600,,3599,4.760450160771704

The old video skipped a bunch of stuff from the Star Trek sketch, and also the end of the Joe Cocker song where Belushi lays down on the floor and drinks down the beer from the can and then spits it back into the air. Just wondering why they only have 2 of 3 Beethoven sketches on the dvd. There were three on the show back in November of 1975 with Belushi doing The Temptations (My Girl). I would also loved to have scene The Honeymooners bit when they dress up in the bee costumes. But anyway getting back to the good stuff I am so happy that they put the Samurai Night Fever sketch on the dvd. Can you believe OJ Simpson is in that? The dvd closes with the King Bee song which I can watch 100 times. I love when Belushi does the cartwheel and tumbles. The Extras are also great with the screen test and the Today show interview with his pal Dan Ackroyd. Go out and get this dvd!",1126483200,12,1110,3.9820627802690582

8075035,5,B000A6T22G,"One of the best Saturday Night Live actors ever! Most people remember him from the movie The Blues Brothers and they will tell you that he is one of their favorite comedians of all time! Belushi was known to be a bad boy doing it his own way but the producers knew that is what makes them money. His impressions of Samurai, Marlon Brando, and Joe Cocker are just a few incredibly good comedy sketches from this expert. This DVD also has bonus sketches and interviews never before seen. How about the very first SNL sketch ever aired? GOT IT. A MUST HAVE.",1455840000,2,554,4.388349514563107
