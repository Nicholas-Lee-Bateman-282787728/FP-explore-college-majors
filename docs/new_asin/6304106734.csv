It was confusing & has left me questioning my life, my every moral fiber. Please spare your own lives & DO NOT purchase this!!! It's like that movie where those people die within 7 days after they watch it. Be afraid, BE VERY AFRAID!!!

b.t.w. -> the guy with the leather jacket & huge tie is quite scary.. almost petifilistic!",1192147200,,450,4.357142857142857

This approach sparked my interest in a field that has long intimidated me.  I can now proceed to  find more information with the understanding I got from this film. Thanks  for presenting the artistic, philosophical approach to quantum conceptual  understanding.",962496000,,379,5.25
