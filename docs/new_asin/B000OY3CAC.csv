8187235,2,B000OY3CAC,"I love step aerobics, but part of what makes it fun is good music to keep you moving and motivated.  I couldn't get into this video because the music was boring.  Instead of using stuff off the radio, they used this generic music which, although the tempo was good, I just couldn't get into.  I also felt that the choreography was boring and advanced steppers will tire of monotonous moves.",1306886400,2,390,4.542857142857143
8187236,4,B000OY3CAC,"I appreciate this workout. The combos are a little hard to pick up, but once you do, you will really enjoy the workout.",1300320000,,119,4.217391304347826
8187237,5,B000OY3CAC,"My wife decided she needed to eat better and lose some weight.
I found Nekea Brown's video's to be good for a beginner and beyond.
Her friendly, non-threatening approach was just what my wife needed.
My wife does her workout every day and really enjoys the dance steps.
Her weight has come down and she is sold on Nekea Brown.
She has this video and two other Nekea Brown videos.
I'm happy that my wife found a program that she can stick to and enjoy.",1281916800,,451,4.317647058823529
8187238,5,B000OY3CAC,This is a great step workout.  I love the different intervals - her pushes really get the heart rate up.  Her moves are basic but she uses some new and effective combinations which make it more challenging.  Her cues are timely and she does preview some moves or uses add-ons to create more complex combinations.  Her attitude is upbeat and energetic without being annoying and the music is pretty decent.  Her 9 minute core segment was a great finish to the workout.  I highly recommend this DVD for any one looking to rev up their step routines.,1242518400,8,547,4.587628865979381
8187239,5,B000OY3CAC,"If you are ready for a great step workout, look no further!! Nekea is great with her cuing and even shows a more complicated sequence before she does it. The first few times she showed a more complicated sequence I could only do some of the steps, but after awhile I was able to follow along. This video is definitely NOT boring. It is a challenge, but enjoyable. I would highly recommend this to anyone ready to step-up their workout and challenge themselves. It is long, with 5 combinations, but you could shorten it as your body/energy allows. The ab workout is short, but effective. Finally, Nekea finishes with a calming stretching segment. :)",1210204800,9,648,4.692982456140351
8187240,5,B000OY3CAC,"This is my first Nekea Brown DVD, but won't be my last.  I enjoyed the workout and I did sweat!
It starts with a 8 minute warm-up.  The good part is the 50 minute step/cardio/sculpt intervals.  The step portions are challenging, but not so challenging that you ""get lost""  All step portions are expertly cued and the music is appropriate.  The sculpt/cardio portions keep your heartrate up, and they also strenthen your muscles (squats, short lunges, etc)
Next is a cooldown and then a 9 minute Ab workout..whew!  It's tough. It ends with a stretch making the whole workout 73 minutes.
If you don't have 73 minutes to invest at one time, there are other shorter workout options in the ""extras"" section. You can pick, cardio only, or step only.
I'll use this one often.",1201824000,26,768,4.651851851851852
