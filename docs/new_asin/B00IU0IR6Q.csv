6297332,5,B00IU0IR6Q,"Amazing , Very well presentation of historical events. Armenian Genocide has been a dark chapter in humanity and precursor for other genocides that followed. The Jewish Holocaust followed by Nazi Germany and so forth... Turkish denials bare no fruit and shame on those people who subscribe to it. WE MUST ALL combat revisions of history and end this shameful acts of barbarism .,,

Great Movie and thank you for making this DVD available.  It should be available to schools for educational purposes ...",1411344000,10,502,5.036144578313253

6297334,5,B00IU0IR6Q,Only here to say that not only am I the descendant of a survivor of the genocide but I heard the gruesome tails told first hand. It is unfortunate that Amazon would allow the descendants of the perpetrators and deniers of this crime to slander the makers of this film and the Armenian people as a whole.,1406851200,8,303,4.333333333333333
6297335,5,B00IU0IR6Q,"This is a well-done film that does not cut corners on the truth. The filmmakers had the courage not to water-down history out of fear of offending ruling powers. Genocide is not pretty, and history demands an unblinking telling of this horrible chapter in Turkish-Armenian history. This is a two-set CD - beautifully done, powerfully told. It belongs in the history department of every college and high school in the world.",1406592000,3,423,4.971830985915493
6297336,5,B00IU0IR6Q,"1915 The Armenian Genocide is a brilliantly made film providing a detailed account of the horrors of the first genocide in the history of the world. The film makers masterfully explore the anatomy, origins and legacy of one of the most demonic crimes against humanity. This is a cinematographic  tour de force. Images of the magnificent past of Armenia (created by the auteur himself), are counterbalanced by archival footage providing evidence for the massacres, orgies of violence and the unspeakable barbarity and brutality surrounding the event. The contrast between the accounts of survivors and statements of deniers just further accentuate the pressing need for an official recognition.  The rare synthesis between historical accuracy and authenticity, attention to detail, creative expression, artistic diligence, genuine compassion and impeccable cinematography are stunning.  The lucidity of the images, the tasteful musical selection, and the commitment to excellence make this film a must see for everyone who believes in justice and human dignity. Especially now, on the eve of the 100th Anniversary, the 1915 Armenian Genocide film is more actual than ever.",1401926400,22,1171,5.604519774011299
6297337,5,B00IU0IR6Q,I've read about the genocide and watched survivors talk about it. This is the best video presentation of the Armenian Genocide that I've ever seen.

8645480,5,B00IU0IR6Q,"This film is an eye opener, even for those who are familiar with the events of 1915. I would strongly urge to get this film, especially those who are uniformed of the 1915 Armenian Genocide, which is an undisputed fact. Further, it exposes and explores, that is in depth, culture and reach history of the Ancient Armenian Civilization. Thanks to the wonderful crew who immortalized the History in the Centennial Edition of this great production!",1419206400,3,445,4.946666666666666
