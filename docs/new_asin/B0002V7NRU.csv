2120867,4,B0002V7NRU,This show is not for everyone. It was violent for it's time but I did find it to be one of my favorites. I also did not like it when they changed some of the characters especially the villan. Even with this you should give it a try,1298764800,,231,3.8333333333333335
2120868,5,B0002V7NRU,"Enjoyed this final season of Profiler.  The crossover episode with The Pretender - always well written, cutting edge in profiling for its time...  A great watch, worth being in anyone's collection.",1264032000,,197,5.32258064516129
2120869,5,B0002V7NRU,Discs and product is great shape and I live in Australia and these products were received by us in less than a week.  Very well done,1244592000,,132,4.076923076923077
2120870,5,B0002V7NRU,"I am a diehard Profiler fan and I was devastated when Ally Walker decided not to return . . . but I actually really enjoyed the final season starring Jamie Luner!  The action was great . . . and this DVD of the entire season doesn't leave any of that action out.  The only disappointment is that, of course, the show was cancelled. :)",1237420800,2,334,4.203125
2120871,4,B0002V7NRU,"I really liked Jamie Luner as the new profiler, she was different than Sam, which I liked. Sam became more and more depressed as the series went on and this began to bother me. I got the feeling it was not just for her role!

Although I like this season, I will not purchase it at this time because it's much to expensive, 80$ for 1 season is way too much.",1198627200,,356,4.014084507042254
2120872,1,B0002V7NRU,"Don't waste your money.  Ally Walker isn't on this one.

She was the show.  Then she left.  They should have offered her more money or called it quits.  But no, they kept it going.  It's like keeping a person alive, whose only future is that of a vegetable.  Worse than Terry Shiavo.  Terry should have lived.  This show shouldn't have.  Season four was a waste of film, money, and time.

So don't waste any of those things on adding it to your collection.  Sorry, Robert Davi.  Sorry, Julian McMahon.  You should have quit when Ally left.

2120873,5,B0002V7NRU,THERE IS NOT MUCH TO ADD TO THE TITLE BUT THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT SEASON AND PROVIDED MANY EXCITING EPISODES.,1120953600,2,107,4.4
2120874,5,B0002V7NRU,"Being the Ally Walker fan that I am, I was quite surprised that I took to her replacement as well as I did.  Jamie Luner was better than I ever thought she'd be and it's too bad that NBC didn't continue the series with her. (Though they did at least give her a full season.)

Also, I do have to say that I'd watch anything with Julian McMahon and/or Roma Maffia. (Thank you, Nip/Tuck).",1101772800,12,385,4.1891891891891895
2120875,4,B0002V7NRU,"Viewers who accepted at the time to keep an open mind still liked season four very much. Ally Walker's decision to walk out wasn't the brightest, still her replacement was a good one. The show still worked, the stories were still strong but most people deserted the show only because of Ally walker's departure. I'm still sorry the show was stopped and certainly will buy season four because profiler was for me one of the best show together with Millennium. I'm sorry they both were stopped.",1092528000,24,492,4.732558139534884

8032187,5,B0002V7NRU,"I know a lot of people shut this off when Ally Walker left.  I shut off X-Files when David Duchovny left only to realize years later (when I finally calmed down and watched the last seasons) that XF held up pretty well after his departure.  Well, I can now say the same for Profiler.  Sometimes we let our emotions get the best of us and don't even give the show a chance when the lead, well, ... leaves.  I happen to really like Jamie Luner as Rachel Burke.  She brought something new, different and refreshing to the show.  I won't sit here and say who I like better. Just like I can't compare season 4 to the others, I can't compare the actresses.  The show is good both ways. You just have to accept the changes with an open mind and enjoy the story! Good story, Good acting!  Give it a chance and complete your collection.  You won't be disappointed. I wasn't.  OK? OK!

As far as the dvd quality..  Could be better.  Maybe I'm just spoiled with HD now.  On a scale of 1 to 10, the quality in my opinion is hovering around a 7 or 8.  The picture is a tad grainy.  It looks like it was recorded in LP mode.  The sound.. Well, when I watch my regular TV, I have the volume at around 10.  When I watch the DVD, I have to put the volume up 3 or 4 notches. It sounds muffled in spots.

Still a worth while purchase.",1409961600,,1315,4.06640625

8032191,5,B0002V7NRU,"I loved the entire series, but found season 4 to be the best season.  I love Ally Walker in the role of Sam Waters, but her character was written in a manner that made it difficult to believe her role as an FBI profiler.  The new profiler, Rachel, is a strong character who is completely believable in the role.  I wish that series had been successful.  In my opinion, this is the series that opened the door for Criminal Minds and other shows in the genre.  A fantastic show and a great season!",1343779200,,495,4.279569892473118
8032192,3,B0002V7NRU,"SAMANTHA WATERS WAS THE MAIN CHARACTER OF THIS SERIES; HER STORY CAPTIVATED THE AUDIENCE, SO WAS DIFFICULT TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH THE NEW FACE. THE SERIES WERE NEVER THE SAME AND THE WRITERS, IN A DESPERATED MOVE TRY TO RECREATE THE SAME STORY FOR THE NEW PROFILER BUT THE AUDIENCE DIDN'T SHOW INTEREST...BUT, THIS IS AN OK SEASON...MAYBE YOU WILL LIKE IT...WHO KNOWS!!",1318377600,,369,4.873015873015873
8032193,3,B0002V7NRU,"Over all I liked the Series but with Sam (Ally Walker) leaving they could have renamed it to VCTF. Because in Season 4 it really seemed to become more about the whole team, as opposed to Sam and her being persued, victimized, attacked, harrassed, terroized and eventually tortured abit even by Jack and his fall guys. Im deffinitly glad he was taken down finally, unless it was just another fall guy...lol. =P
  Anyway, Yes I know the rest of the team was there and had thier parts, run ins and what not in the previous 3 Seasons. But it just really seemed centered on Jack and his hmmm...hard-on I guess for Sam. I guess because she was a challenge for him and gave him a reason to continue living, and yes continued killing, when he seemed about to quit from what was inferred. The others were thrown in here and there with thier own stories in the beginning, which thankfully did get more involved as the seasons progressed to add to the tapestry of the story.
  This last season, #4, started off fine but then they decided (The writers I guess) that Rachel (Jamie Luner) needed her own stalker. Im not sure why, maybe because it worked the first time around. But to me it was more like: Oh no, Not again. It all started because Rachel was not willing to kiss a superiors @$$, or lie to save face for him so he could get some recordings, was pretty much what I got out of it. I didn't like how It was left off at the end either with Rachel sitting in a jail cell and VCTF being shutdown, cliffhangers can be entertaining but this one just left a bad taste in the mouth, unless there was a TV movie or book made that I missed that addressed what happened it was very disappointing. If it weren't for some really good episodes, like the one on the city dam with the sniper is one that really stands out to me, then I don't think Id have kept this one. It just sounds like another victim of the Reality Crap craze that was getting started up then, Like recently with the way the economy has been its-(Reality TV) been able to take down many great shows these days which is very disheartening, I guess Ill go back to reading to get my dose of good stories in and periodically go back to re-watch everything thats thankfully made it to DVD.
  I loved the Cast and the acting and the interactions they had with each other, they were all great. Ally Walker, Robert Davi, Erica Gimpel, Roma Maffia, Peter Frechette, Jamie Luner and everyone were all great and it was very enjoyable to watch them, if a little serious what with being a crime show (Kind of supposed to be though, I thought. Crime is not usually funny unless it involves some dumb-@$$ criminals getting caught doing stupid stuff, like in 2 certain movies that were made in the 90's -H*** A**** Im not sure if its apporpriate to Name them here since this is about Profiler- At any rate it wasn't very realistic what happens to them but I laughed my @$$ off anyways when they got what was coming to them.) Maybe they could have had some lighter moments to offset the more heavy ones, and if the rumor was true about why Ally left then maybe she wouldnt have left if thered been some funny/lighter moments. Even so I enjoyed watching Jamie Luner even if for a short time.
  Another episode thats stands out to me though was the story with George (Peter Frechette) catching up to and almost killing the thug that robbed his friends video store and almost killed him and his 2 friends during the robbery but only didn't because the gun jammed. That was a powerful moment to me and great acting on Peters part in my oppinion. I was even yelling at the TV: Yeah how do you like it B1tc#!, when George caught up to the thug in the alley threw him against the wall and held his gun to the thugs head. ""Please don't shoot me! I got a kid!"" he pleaded. Im like: So that makes it ok for you to rob the video store, hurt the customers and employees and intend to kill George because hes FBI and you found his badge and you felt you had to act bad to the FBI agent? *Rolls eyes* Id have had a hard time NOT pulling the trigger on his lame-@$$ myself.
  Still they could have changed the name on this last season and made it a spin off, maybe even brought Sam back from time to time to help out or just pop in to see Bailey, perhaps even once a season so we can see the progress her and her daughter has made and what not, I doubt that Ally would have objected to that. It deffinitly had more potential though than to be left the way it was. Thats why Im giving this one a 3, instead of 3 & 1/2 since Im not sure how to or if its possible to give, 1/2 stars.

Anyway this is all only my oppinion, take care everyone. Cyn",1315785600,2,4664,4.240990990990991
