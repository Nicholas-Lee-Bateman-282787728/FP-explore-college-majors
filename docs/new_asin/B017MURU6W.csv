8739794,5,B017MURU6W,"I haven't seen this particular edition, but I watched the film several years ago and absolutely loved it. It's the story of a man who's spent his life working for the railroad and has worked his way up to station master. But when the spur his station is located on is going to be closed down, he's forced into retirement because of his age rather than being re-assigned to another facility. In this film, he reminisces about what his life as a railroad man has meant to him, what that life gave him and what it took away. Absolutely extraordinary and profoundly moving story. Ken Takakura is brilliant in his role as the railroad man. Highly recommended for anyone liking stories of human drama.",1503792000,2,695,4.612903225806452
