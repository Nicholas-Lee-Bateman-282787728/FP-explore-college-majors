2726975,1,B000M8026M,I bought this elsewhere and thankfully was able to return it. the DVD quality is abysmal-- I burned a copy from VHS that absolutely looks restored compared to this. the colors on this transfer are horribly washed out and fuzzy.

2726984,5,B000M8026M,I have always like this movie.,1459209600,,30,4.166666666666667
2726985,5,B000M8026M,"This DVD Movie reminds me of the statement in the news media that I heard many times as a young boy like Dean Stockwell during the Post WW II years that "" .... mankind has not crossed over into Jordan."" because the threats of war and nuclear proliferation remained.  In the 21st Century with the same threats we have not crossed over into Jordan also.  As a young boy, Dean Stockwell with the well known Irish actor Pat O'Brien and Robert Ryan portray a supernatural-fabled story that is a superb call for tolerance and being different does not mean dangerous.  Just like the end of WW II, in our days we have orphans of dead military parents who perished in the line of duty.  In this DVD fable an orphan boy finds sanctuary with an improvised Grandfather in a small town; then his hair turned green mysteriously and the whole town turned against him due to fearful ignorance.  The finale of this movie is superb with the parting message hope is the beginning of understanding, mercy, compassion and the courage to carry on in the future.  Excellent, comedy, drama and fantasy with natural meaning for all ages.  Although this DVD did not have language captions, especially English for the hearing impaired, still I rate as 5 stars plus!",1458518400,2,1238,4.651376146788991

2726991,5,B000M8026M,"Super movie for the time, post WWII. Very allegorical, with a great message on tolerance of others who are different from the majority. My family took me to see this movie in 1950, at a neighborhood theatre, and it remained etched in my mind all these years, so I finally had to buy it. It was as good as the first time around.",1439769600,,327,4.2063492063492065

2726998,3,B000M8026M,Nice story about an orphan boy who wakes up with green hair...as you might expect he is generally shunned...it all works out in the end as the boy completes a journey of self-discovery...my 7 year old granddaughter Molly loved it...it provides a timey message and O'Brien is very good...with a solid supporting cast...also gives the message that magic is very real!,1408579200,3,365,5.0
2726999,3,B000M8026M,"Many movies have a message. In this case it's a message surrounded by a movie.

A war orphan Peter Fry (Dean Stockwell) who leads the precarious life after hearing tales of how ""green"" is color of spring and hope for all mankind in times of peril finds that his parents turn green. His grandfather convinces him that it is a badge or a symbol that he is going to do something great. Being pre-hippie days everyone else thinks he's just strange and it must've been something in the water or the milk. He has a vision allowing him to realize that he has a message for the world about how bad were is and that it creates war orphans. The question is how will this message be received and what will they do about his green hair?

The film and the message may be a tad more complex. However this is the jest of the movie.",1408406400,,816,4.2243589743589745

2727014,5,B000M8026M,"I had been tape recording on VHS and then I found a DVD. That was a very bad recording of colour  in black and green. I sent it back. Now the new DVD on WB Archive Collection is a perfect recording. The kernel of truth in the story is, of course to stop war.  It has a catchy tune with his Irish foster granddad and the opening by Nat King Cole.  Always an excellent story and classic actors.",1400544000,3,392,4.0
2727015,5,B000M8026M,"Yes, Pat O'Brien does his Irish corn a bit, but makes good as a foster grandpa.  Overall, the film relates to any generation involving military service people whose children become orphans.  This was one of the few films my father took me to see as a kid that was so appropriate that I was moved emotionally as an eight year-old to understand loss and those who have suffered it.  It also made me more aware of how lucky my family was to have our service men back from the war.  For anyone looking for a little sensitivity in a film, this serves well- and compares somewhat with the recent THE BOOK THIEF, another view of a child's reaction to war.",1389830400,3,648,4.375

2727019,5,B000M8026M,"Don't let anyone put you off this film. It was a lot better that I had expected, and you will not be disappointed unless you are an unrequited cynic.

If you can empathize even a little with the struggles faced by those who are treated as outcasts because they are ""different"", you should find this little gem as absorbing and entertaning as I did.  While it is ostensibly a children's film (that should be required viewing for every child in the world), its message is a distinctly adult one, and is presented simply but powerfully with a charming touch of understated humor.

I'm more than a little critical of all too many films I see today, but this is one I have no hesitation to recommend.",1356739200,10,695,4.5
2727020,5,B000M8026M,"I love this film. I love it's messages of peace, love, hope, and acceptance. I love the hauntingly beautiful and ethereal theme song ""Nature Boy"" by Eden Ahbez. I love the stark realism couched in fantasy and fairy tale idealism. I love the ardent fervor the actors infuse into their characters, creating a wholesome, realistic and utterly believable atmosphere. I love the overall muted Technicolor shades that allow the vivid greens to stand out in stark contrast. I love the simplicity of this film - it is what it is. I love Dean Stockwell. I love that this film is virtually unknown, sort of my own secret little gem. I love this film.",1347148800,10,640,4.672566371681416
2727021,5,B000M8026M,"First off, this Warner Brothers dvd is excellent quality (crisp picture and great color).  There's another dvd release floating around, from Terra Entertainment, which I unfortunately ordered first (from another website) because it was cheaper, but the quality of that Terra Entertainment dvd is bad -- fuzzy picture and greenish tint throughout.  I'm guessing that's the release that the other reviewer, who was upset with the quality of the dvd, purchased (they said they did not get it from Amazon).

I recently ordered and just received this Warner Brothers dvd release and it's MUCH BETTER quality than the Terra Entertainment release, so don't worry about purchasing this dvd for its quality.

As for the film itself, I personally found it fascinating.... Its message is still applicable today, and was very unusual for its time.",1329436800,26,835,5.208955223880597
2727022,3,B000M8026M,"Pacifistic and antiracist parable. If you forget Pat O'Brien's clownings and some overdramatic scenes, you'll still have some meat on the bone left here. The scene in the barbershop when Peter Fry has his hair cut off is perfectly well shot. No word spoken but roaring bad consciences. A curiosity. Recommended.",1323129600,3,311,5.117647058823529
2727023,4,B000M8026M,"I haven't seen this movie since I was a kid, myself. Dean Stockwell is fine as a war orphan whose hair turns green when he learns of his parent's death.  Hiding out he encounters a group of war orphans that urge him to keep his green hair and wear it to remind people of the evils of war ""wind of winter"" and the green ""hope for the spring"" when all wars will end.",1301270400,2,364,3.9863013698630136

8167210,5,B000M8026M,"Having watched this movie every time it was on tv as a child, I at first didn't understand the children this boy with green hair came in contact with in his dreams. The message I got from it was this: We are ALL responsible for each other, the Golden Rule applies to everybody, and if you see a wrong being done-do all you can to help correct it. And most of all, remember that the way for history to repeat itself is to try to wipe out all memory of those terrible things that have happened in history !",1512777600,,504,4.101010101010101

8167212,5,B000M8026M,"It's amazing how relevant this film is today, given how many years ago it was released. Humanity seems to have remained static in many regards. While the young man is at first totally thrilled with his unique quality, he is gradually convinced that it is not so good to be different. A rude awakening for him. The film is a delight.",1485129600,2,332,4.459016393442623

8167215,4,B000M8026M,This was a movie I had missed when growing up during the 1940's. It showed that prejudice can be for the sometimes silliest reasons and was presented before such things were not really taken as seriously as they are today. Dean Stockwell was a credible actor even at such a young age.,1478131200,,284,4.480769230769231
