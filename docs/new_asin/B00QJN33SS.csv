6873010,5,B00QJN33SS,This season has a great finale. The best one of the series (until the Time Force finale The end of time that is.) Still has a great ending. Can't wait to get it!,1425513600,2,161,3.909090909090909
6873011,5,B00QJN33SS,"I'm a little biased cause this is my favorite season of Power Rangers. While this is a great season I will admit that it does have a very slow start. It's not until the Magna Defender stuff (around episode 9) where the season gets very interesting. But this is a fantastic season. It has 2 themes really, a space-opera theme, and an animal theme, which is such a crazy combination but it really works. The season total is 45 episodes. This is a much darker season of Power Rangers also, but is great!",1418256000,3,500,4.387096774193548
6873012,5,B00QJN33SS,"i love this season!! i remember watching it in 1999 when i was 11 and some of the best parts was when the psycho rangers came back, Mike(Leo's brother) became The Magna Defender, the in space rangers came to help the lost galaxy rangers fight off the psychos and when Karone took the place of Kendrix, after she lost her life saving Cassie's morpher. if you love Lost Galaxy or would like to see an old school season of this awesome show, then this set is for you :)",1417996800,6,466,4.247191011235955

6873025,2,B00QJN33SS,"I'm not a Power Rangers fan--even though I like the mesh of models, rubber suits, monsters, robots, et al.--so I am giving the American shows a new look because I should like it. (I still hate the early Morphin era).

Power Rangers, Aliens, Space Ships, and Colonies, and fairly snazzy uniforms sounds good. It is. When this show is good it is good. Those moments do not balance out the story inconsistencies and problems.

Despite not being a great series, I would still like some special features on these DVD sets. A few commentary tracks and behind the scenes features could have been better than the actual show.

The DVD transfer was fine, just bland content.",1499212800,,665,4.7155172413793105

6873029,5,B00QJN33SS,"For the longest time, I have longed to get one of my TOP #1 favorite series of all time since my 7-year-old self back in '99 on DVD.
For the longest time, I have been hoping that along with the others that some DVD making company like Shout! would remaster it.
AND for the longest time, I have finally brought the entire series home with me.

Power Rangers Lost Galaxy is definitely one of my Mega ultra series that graced my childhood further among the other Power Rangers I have watched prior since the MMPR days. As a fan of this Charlie Brown-suited season (yeah, the pun there), I had to have it and revisit what made this second, but last so far, Space-themed season until Lightspeed Rescue-onward (when that set the series back to Earth) one of my top greatest favorite incarnations of Power Rangers ever. Other than the original, but overrated MMPR series, Lost Galaxy (like In Space before it) took the Power Rangers universe in sheer deep seriousness.

There were so many great episodes for me to like (except for the fillers that I felt weighed the series down very much a bit like ""Green Courage"" and ""Loyax's Last Battle""):

- ""Quasar Quest"", considering it the ""Pilot"" of the season, was a brilliant strong start giving Lost Galaxy a great (and behindering sometimes weird and awkward) premise. Rangers possessing the legendary power (and yes I said ""LEGENDARY"") of the Quasar Sabers. And establishing what became one of my favorite Red Rangers ever, Leo Corbett (Danny Slavin), and his character arc.
- The Lights of Orion and Magna Defender episodes were soso for me. In the past, I thought the storyline was somewhat going further but in retrospective hindsight I start to realize (since I'm older now) that the Lights of Orion story arc was pretty much on the BLAND side of the series but the episodes ""Orion Rising"" and ""Orion Returns"" were the better episodes ending such a bland, boring and dull arc. The only time this arc got it's mojo of storytelling interesting was when anytime the Magna Defender is involved. And yes, Magna Defender is one of my favorite Sixth Rangers of all time (next to Orion/Super Megaforce Silver, Phantom Ranger from Turbo, Tommy as the MMPR White Ranger, among other Sixths).
- The episodes ""Stolen Beauty"", ""Heir to the Throne"", and ""An Evil Game"" are among the following episodes that showcase Trakeena's arc as the main villain in a arc I like to dub ""The Rise of Trakeena"" - it is of course the name of a Fan Film I was still working on (since 2010-11 in High School). Follow me on YouTube for that (PRLostGalaxy2014) -. Considering as soon as she lost Scorpius at the hands of the Power Rangers, then that's when Trakeena takes charge and bringing much harsh reckoning to them that was until the teamup and Karone's reintroduction episode.
- ""To the Tenth Power"", ""The Power of Pink"",""Protect the Quasar Saber"", and ""Facing the Past"" feels like a Trilogy arc (with ""Facing the Past"" being the bonus epilogue with ending ties from In Space considering Karone was the Space Rangers' main villain Astronema prior), but it was glorious. The writing with this arc was perhaps the major highlight of Lost Galaxy: Psycho Rangers joins Trakeena, Psychos square off against the Space and Galaxy Rangers. Psycho Pink's monumental battle with Cassie and Kendrix, and the most of all: The Death of a Power Ranger! Something I never witnessed as a child at the time of this series' dark progression.
- The Lost Galaxy/Captain Mutiny: The most boring, if not pointless story arc of the series. Rushed at mediocre. The only episode I liked was ""Enter the Lost Galaxy"" because I liked the Rangers v. Mutant Deviot fight. Captain Mutiny, Barbarax and Hexuba were perhaps the worst of the Lost Galaxy villains, next to Scorpius and Furio. Outside of ETLG, the Grunchor and Titanisaur episodes were....... Okay, but didn't have much of a wow-factor like the Psycho Ranger arc from In Space or the Diva-Zord arc from Turbo had.
- And lastly, ""Journey's End"". Perhaps the biggest fan favorite series ender of Power Rangers among many (that was until Time Force's finale): Trakeena goes psycho possessing Deviot's power, Terra Venture crashes to the moon, Suicide Squad of Stingwingers invading, Villamax's change of heart (which didn't last long), the destruction of the Scorpion Stinger and Astro Megaship, Trakeena's final LG battle with the Rangers (until the imfamous ""Trakeena's Revenge"" the next season) and the Rangers finally making it to the new world.

Characters:

- Leo is definitely one of my favorite Red Rangers ever. He had the most focus out of all the Rangers. He is perhaps the strong point of the season.
- Mike, Leo's brother, was okay but he didn't do much nor had any further focus episodes other than in share with his brother. I did like how he transitioned into becoming the Magna Defender after the original died one episode prior. For 17 years, I'm still pissed off on how the writers decided to let Mike lose the Magna Defender powers near the end of the series.
- Damon, for better or worse, was like the Chris Tucker of Green Rangers (and you know this, man!) - while in the next season Joel is the Kevin Hart of Green Rangers. Complaining about him being a decoy at times when distracting the villains. Sure he's the life of the party of the group (....for a mechanic) but there is hardly any time where some things can be taken serious. Not that I don't like Damon, but he can be on the annoying side. Also, for any who don't know, in real life his actor Reggie Rolle married Trakeena's actress (Amy Miller-Rolle)!!!!! Thus, brought us perhaps the most loyal actor marriage of Power Rangers. Let's think of Reggie and Amy as the Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie of Ranger actors.
- Kai, like Damon, was a jerk through and through. Always playing by the books as a security officer for Terra Venture. he was an okay Blue Ranger but never was one of my favorites and still isn't.
- Kendrix. Perhaps the most underrated characters in the season and PR as a whole. Her actress was diagnoised with Leukemia during the show's production for cryin' out loud. I figured that's why Kendrix got killed off. For 17 years, following the series' end, I could never understand why did they bring her back once the Rangers returned the sabers back in the stone to revive Maya's Mirinoi tribe.
- Karone to me was a better Pink Ranger than Kendrix was (no offensive), but I wish there was more to her as a Ranger this season after her biggest redemption of being a villain the previous series.
- Maya was, I hate to say this, the WORST of the group. Worst Yellow Ranger ever. Her actress (regardless if you like her) sucked. Wasted potental for a character arc. Could've been the team's mentor, but instead she was so boring. Also, I don't like her Jungle Princess outfit. Too skimpy in PR standards.

- Among most of the villains, Trakeena was and still is (you can tell my fanboy-ism for her character) my ONLY favorite villain this season. She went from being a spoiled, stuck-up, self centered, egotistical, bratty, narcissistic pretty face to a self-centered, and even more powerful and narcissistic woman you don't want to mess with otherwise she will have mercy on you. She's pretty much like any other female villain in fiction: Cold, heartless, careless, resist to no redemption at the end, cruel, black-hole hearted, ruthless, b*tchy, arrogant, cathartic, empty, lacking empathy for others, lacking suffiencent care of one's self, and most of all Out right Narcissistic. I like Trakeena. Still one of my favorite villains, but now I'm at the point where her narcissistic starts to ""bug"" me. Of course, as a narc, she is that type of Power Ranger villain that doesn't care for others' needs, want those to bow to her with loyal, wants the world to revolve around only her and nobody but her, lacks empathy, etc. I still adore her outfit, makeup most definitely (when I think of Trakeena's makeup now, I get an Elvira/Morticia vibe while in her Deviot form she looks like a psychotic schizophrenic - with NPD, Narcissistic Personality Disorder - who doesn't fully care about how they look. Too much psychology talk about my favorite evil PR queen here?).
- Deviot, Villamax, and Treacheron were also good.
- Kegler wasn't really all that evil. He was more of the Jimmy Cricket in a walking barrel of the villains, more like the Finster of the villains (but without the monster making, so what would make Trakeena then, the next Rita but bratty like Divatox?)
- Furio, Scorpius, Captain Mutiny, Barbarax and Hexuba like I said prior were the worst of the villains. Furio and Scorpius most indefinite.

- The staff of Terra Venture didn't do much in the series, but I do like the Commander Stanton character. He was pretty much the Captain Picard of the show and TV/GSA staff.
- Bulk and Phenominus. UN-NEEDED here! Seriously?

PROS:
- Great action, but pacing can be slow sometimes at it.
- Great villains (except again, Furio, Scorpius, Mutiny, Barbarax, and Hexuba), with Trakeena being the #1. Suppose if she was the only villain the Rangers had to face?
- A story that I am always so fascinated about: Terra Venture, a space colony finding a new world (spoilers: It is Maya's homeworld where the journey began).
- Great Megazords, but flawed considering how some can pass on the whole blockish animal vibe the Zords have to them.
- Solid follow up to Power Rangers in Space, considering the referrences (i.e: Astro Megaship, Karone, Psycho Rangers)
- Very dark storytelling.
- The use of the Starship Troopers uniforms for Terra Venture's military (Thank you Power Rangers for reusing outfits of a very popular, but underrated, Sci-Fi comedy movie - though R-Rated - to make me want to become a later fan of).
- Set of weapons. Quasar Sabers being my #1 favorite.
- Love 'em or hate 'em, the Ranger suits. Go ahead and say what you will about the designs, I still find them my top Ranger suit design. Charlie Brown-ish or not.
- The theme song. How can you not forget about it? ""Power Rangers Lost-Lost Galaxy! Far, far away deep in space to a galaxy you will go......(etc.)"". I like the instrumental of it more.

CONS:
- Fight music, although it's okay and well orchestrated, isn't all that compelling. I can do and compose way better fight/non-fight music for this season.
- Lack of further explainations to the Lost Galaxy mythology. (i.e: that Zordon referrence to this team that later got cut).
- Bland and boring filler episodes to weigh the series down.
