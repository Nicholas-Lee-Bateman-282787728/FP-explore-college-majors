8656161,5,B00K5ZLSS8,"This is MR. E's follow up to the slightly tamer and softer movie, ""Nerdy Girls"" (3D), which he did a couple of years ago... And boy is it different! First of all, this movie is super trippy. The sound track music, overall sound design, and even times when it just goes silent, are all really effective in the movie. Big points go to all of the actors in the film who do an amazing job. Kaci Starr has a really charming and alluring quality on film, and her acting is awesome. There are times when the film feels like it's going to get even more explicit (and it does get explicit!), but instead it becomes almost meditative and dreamy. A really cool and unusual experience that I would highly recommend to anyone who is into sexy girls, video art, or high-end erotica. ""Mystery World Of Sex"" is pretty much guaranteed to both disturb and arouse you. Highly Recommended!",1400630400,2,869,4.506329113924051
