8677378,5,B00NCD32KW,"The nice thing about punching mitts is that they're inexpensive and store easily. Unlike heavy bags, they work great for an apartment. In this DVD, Sammy teaches you drills for punching, kicking, and even ground strikes. I've had punching mitts for quite awhile, but had never considered using them for kicking, until I watched this DVD. Punching mitts are a critical piece of equipment to learn how to punch and kick, and Sammy teaches you how to use them to their full potential.",1415232000,3,481,4.807228915662651
8677379,3,B00NCD32KW,"I was looking for basic instruction in using punch mitts with a striker, but with a focus on boxing.  This DVD incorporates more MMA-style moves (grapples, kicks, elbows) than simple punches.  The instruction is good, but for the price, it's too much if you are only looking for basic boxing instruction.  There are some pretty good videos on Youtube that fit the bill.",1337040000,2,369,4.825396825396825
