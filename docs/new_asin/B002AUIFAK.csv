8360419,5,B002AUIFAK,"I love this workout!  It's a nice change from the routine, and a great way to use the ball for a wide variety of exercises.  I wouldn't want it to be the ONLY workout in my collection because it's not comprehensive, but it's a great addition.  You get a very intense workout in a short period of time, one of Joyce's strengths.",1420243200,,327,4.241935483870968
8360420,5,B002AUIFAK,"This went by really quickly.  I like how she uses the ball and it works muscles in a unique way.  Joyce is the real deal.  She seems to truly care for those who do her dvds.  She still even checks her own email if you contact her through her site. I have used a variety of her dvds over the years and she is no fluff, excellent workout.  The ones with Martha, I really like as she helps count in those.",1401148800,2,402,3.9135802469135803
8360421,5,B002AUIFAK,"Great to have in the mix so that workouts do not get boring.  Joyce is your coach, follow her lead for a no-nonsense free weight workout.  Some of the exercises require you to be on your knees but I use my gardening knee pad for those exercises to ease any pressure.",1385337600,,266,4.196078431372549

8360423,5,B002AUIFAK,"Joanna did a very thorough review of this DVD, so I'm going to just add some of my own points to it.

This is my favorite of Joyce Vedral's strength DVDs.  Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joyce-Vedral-Quick-Quartet-No-Stopping-Quick-Shape-Up-Workout/dp/B002ZXZJKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joyce Vedral: Quick Quartet- No Stopping Quick Shape-Up Workout</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joyce-Vedral-Speedy-Non-Stop-Fat-Meltdown-Plus-Stomach-Zapping-Abs/dp/B000R7I3UK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joyce Vedral: Speedy Non-Stop Fat Meltdown Plus Stomach Zapping Abs</a>, this is a pyramid-style workout with no rests.  All the Upper Body and Lower Body exercises are done together as one giant superset.  You do the entire set before shifting from light weights to medium, and medium to heavy.  Because of this, I was able to get away with one set of adjustable barbells (and a remote control to pause between sets for 30 seconds while I changed weights) for my first few workouts with this DVD.

Joyce claims that it is 100 percent aerobic.  While I am dubious about that claim, I have found this to be a solid and enjoyable workout that tones my entire body, and seems to burn quite a few calories while doing it.

What I love about this workout is that it is fast-paced and has some very fun workout moves to use with a stability ball.  This DVD also helped me adapt other weight-training exercises to the ball, which I found very helpful as I do not own a bench.  It does share the weakness of all Joyce Vedral strength workouts that it does not include an adequate warm-up or cool-down, but I found that I could easily provide those myself.

The upper body workout has some fairly standard strength training exercises and primarily uses the ball as a workout bench.  However, I love the cross-face extension triceps exercise, which I have not seen elsewhere, and the entire workout is fast and balanced.  The lower body workout has more unique moves that make use of the ball's more interesting qualities.  I think that my favorite exercise is the one that Joyce rightly describes as a ""killer"": the inner thigh squeeze that uses the ball as resistance.  It's a great exercise for an area that is relatively hard to tone.  In addition, I loved the squats and hack squats on the ball -- Joyce's variation here made an otherwise tedious exercise an outright pleasure.  Doing these exercises were just plain FUN.

Here is a list of the exercises from this workout.

UPPER BODY (all done on the Ball, using the Ball as a Bench)

Preacher Curl
Hammer Curl
Bent Lateral
Side Row
Alternate Side Row

Hack Squat on Ball",1341273600,5,3028,5.411513859275053
8360424,5,B002AUIFAK,"She is not flashy, but she knows what she is talking about.  I am already into a month and a half of doing her program and I can see results.  Try her.  She knows what she is talking about.  After years and years of reading and trying everything regarding diet and exercise I find that she is one of the few out there that will let you know everything you need to know to build a beautiful physique. My advise: read her books, do a fat-free diet and be super patient.  I have not weighted myself and do not intend to for a while.  If I am putting muscle there is no way I will be able to distinguish that by weighing myself.  Be careful about that and follow her advise.  When she was in her 40's, she had a perfect little body (watch her fantastic video Fat Burning Workout)and look at that body.  Now at 60's she looks awesome. What an inspiration!!",1338249600,,851,4.171779141104294
8360425,4,B002AUIFAK,"I like working out with weights; being a slow-strong type of person rather than a fast sprinter, weights are a natural for me. So combining them with either aerobics as in Joyce's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Speedy-Non-Stop-Fat-Meltdown/dp/B000R7I3UK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Speedy Non-Stop Fat Meltdown</a>&nbsp;workout or on a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/physio-ball/dp/B000K7EPLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">physio ball</a>, where more small muscles are called into action, is something I naturally enjoy doing. Balancing on a ball makes you unconsciously use balancing muscles, those smaller muscles in the limbs and torso that allow you to sit, stand, stay upright or in any position. Putting yourself on a slightly wobbly surface like a ball makes you constantly adjust, which increases your workout activity.

The workout starts with a short set of stretches. If you are the tightly-wound type, you will need more stretching, in my opinion, than this. I am usually pretty limber so this set is enough for me but it is not a whole lot of stretching. So run it twice if you know you need time to warm up.

Then you progress to an upper body workout. The workouts require three sets of dumbbells, which you will be adding to as you get stronger, the ball and that's about it.

You do two 16 minute workouts, on split days. The upper body workout begins with Preacher curls are a natural for the ball--you lean over the ball and using it as a bench, pull up your biceps while resting the upper arms on the ball. Then hammer curls and on to bent laterals lying on the ball, rows. You lean on the ball, lie on the ball or use it to lift. the leg exercises use the ball for inner thigh (hold the ball, flex) and for other leg exercises.

A round ball seemed to work best for me; I tried a capsule type (oblong) which for me was not so good for moving quickly between the exercises. You probably can use a capsule ball (as in Barry's Bootcamp.) if you are more agile than I am. Supposedly, you can use a chair if you have no ball; this is similar to an earlier book by Joyce that was designed for use by travelers in hotels rooms or people with little time, her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/12-Minute-Workout/dp/B001MTBTYO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">12 Minute Workout</a>. I didn't like using a chair as a workout bench, and I didn't like the 12 minute workout as a result. The Ball DVD is a lot more fun--but I tend to like doing my workouts on the ball as a rule.

Since anyone can do anything for 15 minutes and as one person put it, 15 minutes is ""not a big enough chunk of time"" to be scheduled, you probably can find this 15 minutes each day to do a decent workout. The ball and weights can fit almost anywhere. This is really a gym-in-a-box, and for under $100 you can have a thorough workout. I suggest alternating this with the fat-meltdown, as that workout is more aerobic. I knocked off a star for lack of music; the background set is pleasant enough, but the lack of music makes this a bit dull. But you can always mute the sound and put on your MP3 player or I-Pod and be happy.",1256515200,17,3232,5.0
