8463895,5,B005BAF68U,This was another great horror pack. It didn't matter if some of the movies were cheesy. They were entertaining.,1427155200,,111,4.894736842105263
8463896,2,B005BAF68U,"I love cheesy horror films as much as the next guy, but if you're familiar with other releases from this Midnight Horror line, then you know that ""low budget"" often ventures into the ""spare change"" category, and can separate the good-bad movies from those that are truly just bad-bad. In most cases you get a handful of both, and for the price, it's usually worth the risk to find out - up until now, that is, because 5 of the 8 films here are already available on the previous two volumes. Normally I hate reviews where the person doesn't own the product they are talking about, but in this case, because I do own the first two sets, I think a little warning from one prospective consumer to another might be in order. Anyhow, the following films are included on this Volume 3 collection:

Backwoods Bloodbath: Curse of the Black Hodag
The Dead Sleep
Decadent Evil (already appears on vol 1)
Demonic Toys (already appears on vol 1)
Evil Bong (already appears on vol 1)
Meridian (already appears on vol 1)
Witchcraft 13: Blood of the Chosen
Zombie Dearest (already appears on vol 2)

Of course if you don't own the previous volumes, then this compilation is fairly decent in itself. (Evil Bong might be worth the price alone, lol.) But as a so-called third installment for people who have kept up with it from the beginning, it's pretty pointless and a total double-dip. Had the three ""new"" movies been Full Moon and/or Charles Band productions I might be more inclined to give them a chance, as I personally find those to be the most amusing, but I don't believe any of them are, so I'm not going to lose any sleep over skipping them for now. Only when, and if, a really good Volume 4 comes out will I consider coming back to buy this, just to fill in the gap.

Update 3/22/12: I've since discovered that as far as these 8-film collections go, they're actually up to at least Volume 8, and have spawned another line called Masters of Terror, which is basically the same thing as Midnight Horror. (Check your local ""K"" store, if you catch my drift.) A lot of the sets still go the double-dipper route - I think I have Mortuary five times over by now, lol - but there are still some goodies to be found scattered throughout.",1326412800,9,2223,4.48395061728395
