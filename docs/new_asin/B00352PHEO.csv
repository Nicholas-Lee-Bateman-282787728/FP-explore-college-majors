4069861,3,B00352PHEO,"A beautiful girl can make me watch anything...kind of sad I know. Emelie is a petite, yet very attractive girl in this film, when she isn't all gothed up. Her acting isn't bad either.

My issues with this film are:

Too much going on.
You have the abuse, the blind neighbor with cancer, the defense class, the issues with mother, the school ""bullying"", the priest, the relationship with the girl, 2 class teachers and psychologist. Way too much going on which made each story too rushed. Her discovery of her sexuality was done badly, that girl had a boyfriend I didn't even know until he mentioned it so that was done badly too. Long story short all the side stories were done wrong and rushed. I don't mean wrong as in dumb, a simple rewrite and removal of a few characters would open up to better more complete storylines.

Writing.
As an author you don't want your readers to feel as if they missed something. With so many side stories you feel like you miss alot in this film. Some of the dialogue wasn't very good and any simple question triggers an emotional outburst. It didn't make sense. I would have loved to have some involvement in the writing, because it has potential and with a beautiful lead actress, it can work.",1366761600,4,1230,4.531531531531532
4069862,5,B00352PHEO,"When watching this movie I was appalled at just how...raw it can be. The fear that she feels, I felt it. It was a fantastic movie and one that I would highly recommend to anyone out there.",1319760000,,188,4.108108108108108
4069863,5,B00352PHEO,"The title of the movie is a reference to a line one of the characters uses, saying 'We all see the world through stained glass windows.' This is meant as an observation that we each of us approach the world and what we find in life through the lens of our own experiences and values.

Thus the reason for my disagreement with the previous reviewer. I really enjoyed this movie and found it to be well done. Yes, the production values are what you might expect from an independent film maker who doesn't have the Hollywood money machine to polish out every imperfection, but the story remains true to itself as a result.

I found the acting to be convincing and engaging, especially in the case of the main character, and her vile protagonist of an ex-boyfriend.

A good story about finding and being true to yourself.",1315440000,4,817,4.54421768707483
4069864,1,B00352PHEO,"I am not a professional movie review person, so please forgive my ignorant approach to this. Didn't really enjoy it. The production was cheesy, seemed like I was watching a daytime soap with terrible acting. Not truly interested in movies that identify with the teen lesbian, as I am 41. The video did not provoke any emotion except boredom, and regret that I spent money to purchase it.",1294876800,,387,4.705882352941177
4069865,5,B00352PHEO,This movie seems to be very helpful on self help. I love it.,1445558400,,60,3.6923076923076925
4069866,4,B00352PHEO,"I really liked this movie but I cant say why. The acting of the main character ""Cherry"" was good but everyone else was so so. The story was good but although I liked it and gave it 4 stars, that's all the praise I can give it. The score was the worst and the camera work only slightly better. As for the martial arts, they are exactly what they were meant to be, students with limited ability so don't expect much. The martial arts are only there to show the evolution of Cherry. Emelie O'Hara carried this movie and made it worth watching but just don't expect to see a big Hollywood production, More like an after school special in its film quality with a terrible music score and sound editing. For those who haven't been dissuaded, enjoy.",1445299200,2,742,4.384057971014493

8388610,3,B00352PHEO,"To be fare I don't want to tank the rating so I am giving it 3 stars but honestly I made it about 10 minutes in and I was done. This thing is way low budget. The acting wasn't great. The choreography of the first interaction between the GF, her abuser and the cop was terrible.  The worst part was the camera/lens.  It felt like it was being shot on an old super 8 and the audio was just as good.",1516838400,,396,3.876543209876543

8388615,1,B00352PHEO,"I wish I could have gotten past the first scene because it sounds like a great story of overcoming obstacles. However, the dialogue and lens was so cheesy, I couldn't take it seriously. It actually made me laugh.",1469923200,,212,4.605263157894737

8388617,5,B00352PHEO,"Emelie O'Hara takes this role by the horns and shows every girl in a similar position in life that there is hope for a positive change. While to some it may seem just too impossible, much of a teenager's life seems all too much too. But as the days go by, those with a smidgen of a brain and the will to overcome, may also find their way out of the darkness of their situation. That is what this story brings to light. I hope many girls and boys find inspiration to overcome life's difficulties through this film.",1456617600,,513,4.244897959183674
8388618,1,B00352PHEO,We didn't watch much of it. It did not appeal to us.,1456617600,,52,3.4166666666666665
8388619,3,B00352PHEO,"I found the movie very amateurish  both in the acting, the production, the scenes and even the content. So why did I watch it to completion in spite of continually muttering to myself about how poorly it was done? There obviously was something compelling about the challenges this poor girl had to live through and a curiosity about how she was going to handle it, heal and grow. Although just about every scene was predictable there is always something thrilling about watching a bullied person learn to take care of themselves and defeat their enemies.",1451433600,,554,4.831578947368421
