2466330,5,B000CNEQWI,This film is a must for O'Neill's devotees.  I teach high school English and have been surprised to find none of his plays in any American literature text our school uses.  He is the preeminent American playwright.  I especially appreciated the comments by the late Arthur Miller.,1233014400,3,280,4.914893617021277

Utterly moving, well made documentary about America's first and greatest playwright. Written by Barbara and Arthur Gelb, the difinitive biographers of O'Neill. Narrated by Christopher Plummer (none finer)and  both the Gelbs -  with tour-de-force acting from excerpts of O'Neill's works by Al Pacino, Jason Robards, Zoe Caldwell, Liam Neeson, Robert Sean Leonard, Vanessa Redgrave. Additional narration by no less than two of the former Deans of the Yale School of Drama (arguably the finest in the country): Robert Brustien and the late Lloyd Richards. As an acting major at the Yale School of Drama(66), I had the privilege to peruse a few pages of O'Neill's original manuscripts. (O'Neill's works are housed in the Yale Bieneke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.)",1204156800,5,991,6.549618320610687
2466332,5,B000CNEQWI,"Built around the idea of what it costs in emotional and psychological terms to be an artist, Ric Burns's captivating docu-portrait is disquieting rather than celebratory, and ultimately quite moving. O'Neill's cathartic personal struggles, like those of so many creative minds, fed into plays like ""A Long Day's Journey Into Night"" and ""The Iceman Cometh,"" but exacted a hefty toll on the man himself. Kushner and theater director Brustein highlight what made O'Neill's unrelentingly savage moral vision so effective--and his technique unmatched--while Pacino, Redgrave, and Zoe Caldwell demonstrate why the finest actors always sought to interpret his works.",1184716800,4,659,5.73469387755102
2466333,4,B000CNEQWI,"It has been said that great conflict makes for great drama. The life of Eugene O'Neill is living proof of this fact.  His was a life of physical, emotional, and spiritual anguish, and yet he is arguably the greatest American playwright, an artist whose work still speaks to us today.  As a matter of fact, it was the very torments that he lived through that fed his genius.  His Muse was his pain, and this is what this film explores in detail.

  The man that we encounter in this documentary is not one who was crushed by his trials, but rather, he was a survivor, who used his experiences to create some of the greatest works of dramatic literature to ever grace a stage.  He was a man who was truly dedicated to his art, and this film gives us a chance to realize and appreciate exactly what that means.

  Narrated by Christopher Plummer, and drawing on interviews with playwrights and actors of today, we are given a chance to see what made Eugene O'Neill the man that he was, and to appreciate just what he has done for the American stage.  It is the portrait of a tortured soul, who at the same time was a great artist.",1168300800,10,1127,4.344497607655502
2466334,4,B000CNEQWI,A wonderful presentation of O'Neill and his work.  It is remarkable for someone to produce his masterpieces after he had already been awarded his Nobel prize.  O'Neill was obviously an extremely complex and complicated genius of the theatre.  I would quibble a bit that more could have been presented about O'Neill's relationships with wives and children.,1168300800,,355,5.303571428571429
2466335,4,B000CNEQWI,"I enjoyed the Burns documentary about O'Neill a great deal, but his portraying of Carlotta was dismayingly flawed. She was increasingly horrific to O'Neill as years went on. I assume Burns was blinkered to this by the Gelbs who, in their works on O""Neill, also ignore Carlotta's near-savagery. For a detailed description of her conduct, see the book WHAT IS AN EDITOR? SAXE COMMINS AT WORK, written by Dorothy Commins. Saxe Commins was O'Neill's editor at Random House, and he saw the awful side of Carlotta up close.",1143590400,12,517,4.886363636363637
2466336,5,B000CNEQWI,"I just saw the preview on PBS last night, and came straight here this morning to get a copy - it's that good. Kushner and Gelb have great insights, the music and photos are wonderful, and Plummer does a heartbreaking rendition of James Tyrone's Booth speech from Long Day's Journey. If you've ever been a fan of America's greatest playwright, you must have this DVD.",1143504000,16,366,4.6461538461538465
2466337,5,B000CNEQWI,"Anyone can make a documentary. It's become quite formulaic. You start with a story you want to tell, have a narrator anchor your tale, illustrate with moving images or still images over which you move, layer music and sound effects to create a mood, and add a healthy dose of ""talking heads"" to gain intimacy and credibility.

Put together Muhammad Ali, Lloyd Price, Zaire, ""Rumble in the Jungle,"" and George Plimpton, and you get Leon Gast's ninety-minute ""When We Were Kings."" Put together Babe Ruth, Billy Crystal, Ebbets Field, ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame,"" and Bob Costas, and you get Ken Burns' eighteen-and-a-half-hour ""Baseball.""

Anyone could have made a documentary on Eugene O'Neill. Of course it helps to have a big brother, who plucks you from the Columbia University campus to help him fight nine episodes of ""The Civil War."" It helps to have already made a highly acclaimed documentary of your own on the Big Apple. It helps to have enlisted the venerable Arthur and Barbara Gelb, who know more about your subject than you can ever hope to know. It helps to have a bit of luck - to have your hand slapped by a PBS executive for stretching a two hour documentary into three, and then being told that your next project on Eugene O'Neill, which you had planned on running four hours, WILL come in at two - or more precisely, 112 minutes. And it helps to be a genius.

On Monday evening, January 23rd, some 150 invited guests filled the MGM Screening Room at 6th Avenue and 55th Street in New York City. They previewed the American Experience PBS documentary ""Eugene O'Neill,"" which will premier on Monday, March 27, 2006. They previewed the genius of Ric Burns.

""What does it cost to be an artist? What did it cost to be Eugene O'Neill?"" director Lloyd Richards asks in the opening moments of the film. ""It cost Eugene O'Neill a mother, a father, a happy marriage, children. It cost the many wives that he tried to have because he didn't know how.""

Burns uses Richards and his other ""talking heads"" to seamlessly tell his story. ""When I interview them, I sit across from them and look them in the eye,"" Burns related at his Steeplechase office, several days after the screening. ""If you don't look them in the eye, they lose interest, and you've lost them.""

Burns didn't lose playwright Tony Kushner, who movingly remarks in the film, ""In O'Neill, there's this absolute, sort of God-ordained mission, which is to keep searching, even if in the process he discovers that there is no God. It's a terrifying sort of mandate, but it also I think should be the mandate of all artists, and in a way, of all people."" Narrator Christopher Plummer provides the anchor for playwrights Kushner and John Guare, directors Richards, Sidney Lumet and Robert Brustein, and O'Neill scholars Edward Shaughnessy and the Gelbs. They all respond to Burns' deft technique, and are transformed from ""talking heads"" into eloquent orators. Burns uses these heads to speak words about O'Neill. He uses a second set of heads to speak O'Neill's words. Al Pacino, Zoe Caldwell, Christopher Plummer, Robert Sean Leonard, and others strategically speak dialogue from O'Neill's plays. They ""speak"" O'Neill's words, as opposed to performing them, and tell Burns' story in much the same way that the playwrights and the directors and the scholars tell it. It's a brilliant juxtaposition that helps Burns keep his story moving at a cohesive, break-neck pace.

Burns starts his story in 1937, when O'Neill moves into Tao House, his California hillside home. Burns uses this point in time as a fulcrum to look backward and relate O'Neill's break with his family, and then look forward, as O'Neill reclaims his family and, as his reputation declines and illness threatens to silence him forever, wrenches from himself three of the greatest plays ever written by an American.

Burns' story could have been told over four hours, or even eighteen-and-a-half. The Gelbs would have had no problem providing the necessary substrate. But that hand-slapping PBS executive fortuitously forced them to cut and cut and cut their story to 112 minutes. Integrated with Brian Keane's magical score, a perfectly accessible tale was crafted that can be easily consumed in one sitting.

The 150 invited guests in the MGM Screening Room already knew most, if not all of Burns' story. It wasn't necessary to give the likes of Ted Mann and Ben Brantley a history lesson on O'Neill. Had Burns' documentary served only to educate, it would have been just another formulaic example of its genre. But, it did much more than educate. It forced those gathered on January 23rd to feel what it cost to be an artist, and it forced many of them to shed a tear for O'Neill and for others they had known who had paid that price. Those assembled felt the tragedy and the genius of Eugene O'Neill. And they felt the genius of Ric Burns.",1139702400,59,4880,4.806912991656734
8099425,3,B000CNEQWI,"This documentary of the great playwright is, for all intents and purposes, a whitewash.  The man was a genius of course.  He was irrevocably scarred by his childhood of course.  But this documentary doesn't even address his failures as a father.  One could watch this entire film and not know that two of his sons committed suicide, that he was perhaps a worse father than his own, that he disowned his daughter.  These are fundamental flaws in the man and in the film.",1467849600,,469,4.602409638554217
8099426,4,B000CNEQWI,"A fascinating companion piece to Burns' more acclaimed, sprawling, complex 4 hour portrait of Andy Warhol released the same year.  The is the correlative opposite: intimate, personal, spending far less time on a complete biography of the man and his work, using much of its length to examine the creation and content of what are generally considered O'Neill's two greatest works (and two of the great modern plays ever written) The Iceman Cometh and A Long Days Journey Into Night.

An amazing group of actors including Christopher Plummer, Zoe Caldwell, Liam Neeson, Al Pacino, and (especially wonderful in his simplicity) Robert Sean Leonard read from the plays -- often longish chunks -- giving a flavor of the work being discussed.  Others like Jason Robards, who spent much of his theatrical career linked with ONeills work, speak with moving eloquence about the experience.  The number of academic talking head experts are few, and what they have to say almost always gives deep and unpretentious insight into the writer, his life and his writings.

If there are shortcomings, its that the film is a little flat visually  we see so many portrait photos ONeill, some repeated, that one sometimes longs for more visual context.  And -- for those familiar with the theater and ONeills work -- theres not as much new information here as might be wished for (as opposed to the Warhol documentary, which seemed to explore areas of he mans life even an educated lay-person had never heard of).  It also spares ONeill any harsh criticism for his self-centered abandoning of his children.  And finally, like the Warhol piece, Burns seems to have no interest in dissenting views.  As the New York Times pointed out when the film aired, there are some serious and thoughtful theater writers and historians who honestly question the greatness of ONeills work, but, as with the Warhol documentary, youd think there was only one unanimous view of the man, a tragic genius.

Yet, ultimately, I found this the more emotional of the two films, giving us a personal taste of a great writers pain.  It let's us feel his hope for release that his plays themselves provided.  And in summing up the film, Jason Robards captures as well as Ive ever heard exactly what the magic and potential of theater is.  There's much that is excellent here, but that few minutes alone would make this documentary well worth seeing.",1462492800,,2401,4.910891089108911
8099427,5,B000CNEQWI,"This is by far the most absorbing biography I've seen in some time.  Many of the PBS American Experience documentaries are beautifully put together; however, there are a special few that really do stand tall above the rest, and this is certainly one. Highly, highly recommended.",1421539200,,278,5.043478260869565
8099428,5,B000CNEQWI,"Watching this video I got the sense of deep old fashion gentle but trouble mind of a man who is indeed brilliant and lost at the same time but painfully uncovering layers apon layers of his life that almost pushed him to the edge. God bless his soul. For what ever he went through his life ,he wrote it down with truth and brilliance. Now the truth set him free. I loved the video.",1420934400,,381,4.162162162162162
8099429,5,B000CNEQWI,"*I have seen countless documentaries and nonfiction T.V. programs that depressed me due to subject matter, but this one is starkly different--it creates a profound sense of sadness in me.  O`Neill was able to take the sadness of his family and create something of value, something most cannot do with such personal devastation. The interview subjects all add to the whole, there is not an ounce of fat in it. [It could have been twice the length to expand the focus to include more on the plays only briefly touched on.] As a portrait of an imperfect man who created great art, it is unique. I think the subtle but powerful score and the excerpts read by Plummer and others add up to a great impression/introduction to O`Neill, and I`ve watched this four times, and each time have been moved. If you are at all interested in the subject, get this dvd.",1354838400,,851,4.598684210526316
8099430,5,B000CNEQWI,"Ric Burns' 2006 documentary, ""Eugene O'Neill"", is the finest, most profoundly moving film biography I have ever seen.  Done in a quiet, introspective fashion, and aided by Brian Keane's hauntingly beautiful music, we are taken inside the life of a great writer and inside the workings of his great masterworks.  Extensive time is given - deservedly so - to ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"", his greatest play and one that, near the end of his life, brought O'Neill back home to his childhood.
If you are a fan of O'Neill, you will enjoy this film immensely.  If you have not yet discovered his work, this film will lead you, as it did me, to seek him out.  The narration, performances and visual materials (photographs, film clips and manuscripts) are all first rate, combining to produce a film biography worthy of America's greatest playwright.",1329609600,,845,4.888111888111888
8099431,5,B000CNEQWI,"I was writing an English paper about Long Day's Journey into Night. All the websites gushed over O'Neil and his works as genius. I wrote a paper based on this information, but did not think it felt authentic. When I watched this DVD and saw the emotional pain he felt; the life he went out to live on his own. Subsequently how all this misery and questioning was funneled into his writings (even some of his creative writing process) affirmed that O'Neil was a genius. But the price O'Neil had to pay for his genius was great. Any lover of drama or American literature will consider this a must have.",1293408000,3,600,4.463636363636364
8099432,5,B000CNEQWI,A must see for any O'Neil fan. Beautifully executed with performances from some of the most talented theatre actors.,1281484800,,116,5.157894736842105
8099433,5,B000CNEQWI,"If internal emotional turmoil contributes to any writer's talent, then Eugene O'Neill has certainly earned his rights.  From the day he was born, life on this earth was difficult for him.  This documentary explores his life from his early childhood to his forming years as a writer.  We learn how O'Neill's experiences shaped him as a writer that made him one of the most prominent american playwrights and eventually Nobel Prize winner for literature.

At the end of this documentary, you may not like O'Neill as a father or a husband; but you will definitely find a path to better understanding of his craving for privacy and why he made both personal and professional choices that he did.",1255737600,4,691,4.830508474576271
8099434,5,B000CNEQWI,"I got exposed to Eugene O'Neill via this PBS documentary.  I watched the second half of it and was so moved that I had to buy it.  I hadn't bought anything from PBS in some years and I have many PBS works in my library, but I just couldn't resist after seeing this.  I didn't even know that I had only caught the second half until I got the DVD and watched it in its entirety.  Truly brilliant work on the part of Ric Burns.  I then ordered some of the DVDs of O'Neill's plays and saw first hand why the subject of this film was so admired.  This film does O'Neill and his work justice.  The readings of his plays from Al Pacino, Christopher Plummer, Liam Neeson and others are fantastic.  Jason Robards who performed in the original productions of some O'Neill plays says some great words on theater acting.  This is yet another great work from Burns.  Very moving and inspiring in its depth of exploration of such a powerful figure as O'Neill.",1254096000,6,945,4.348571428571429
