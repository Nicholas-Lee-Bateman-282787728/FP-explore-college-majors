2407411,5,B000B7MXFW,"Just accidently came across this quirky film on BBC2.
Missed the start so missed any reference to a real adventure by two very brave ( or stupid ) serving soldiers who were anxious to serve on the front line.
Thoroughly enjoyed it even though it was obviously made very cheaply and with a small but talented cast.
Would have liked to know more about the real people but only King is listed in any web search.",1313280000,,408,4.381578947368421
2407412,2,B000B7MXFW,"after you pop-in the dvd you are forced to watch (blocked FF and skip) an ad for another movie. The ad is very long, very bad and the quality is horrible.
The sound in the movie itself is poor and it is very hard to understand the dialogs. No subtitles. the movie is cheaply made. perhaps some people can find this movie funny, we did not.
we lasted about 15 minutes before the movie went back into the red envelope...",1303603200,,418,4.2375

2407414,5,B000B7MXFW,"A great movie -- I loved this -- both comic and thrilling. Two unlikely heroes -- dentists in the medical corps -- decide to ""do their bit"" by taking the war into their own hands. Many unlikely and comic surprises and the photography was excellent. It shows you can make thriller, and even a war movie, without a lot of gratuitous horror-movie type violence. The action takes place in 1942 at a low point in the war for France and England. Churchill's spirits are so low that his aides calm his spirits by offering to read to him from Kipling.

I agree that the English dialect (not the king's English) was a little hard to understand at first, but sticking with it pays off. (My copy did have captions for the deaf, though we didn't use them).",1256860800,3,744,4.430656934306569
2407415,5,B000B7MXFW,"Well worth it. Wish it had subtitles...Some of the slang and accent are a bit hard to catch, but a fun little movie. Loved it!",1197072000,2,126,4.08
2407416,5,B000B7MXFW,Two Men Went to War is like Gomer Pyle but with british humor. So it's a little more understated. The film is beautiful and looked great on my widescreen TV. Both the lead actors are great and Derek Jacobi is excellent too. Lot of fun this is the kind of film you'd see on A&E or Bravo. Definitely for the over 20 crowd.,1142985600,2,320,4.095238095238095
2407417,1,B000B7MXFW,"I wish I COULD rate this movie, but it just won't play in any of my 3 DVD players.  I asked for a replacement from Amazon, which they did graciously and speedily, but even the replacement fails to load and play in my player which plays other DVDs just fine.  Moreover, Two Men Went To War locks up the controls of the DVD player.  Obviously it isn't made to the standards of the hundreds of other DVDs I've bought from Amazon.

I have just discovered that the DVD DOES load and play in my Mac Powerbook G4.  That's nice, but I had planned to see the film it in my home theater on the big screen.  Bummer!",1139011200,,604,4.119658119658119
2407468,5,B000B7MXFW,"There are not many movies that I want to see twice.  I rented this film, and in that short period of time, I watched it twice, and then when it was erased from my Kindle I felt such a loss that I bought  it so I can watch it again and again and again.

I was also curious to know if this really happened.  And as incredible as it seems, the two characters in this film (Private Lesley Cuthbertson and Sargeant Peter King) really existed, and apparently they really did ""invade"" France in 1942.  And they really did escape being captured and they really did cross back  to England.  They were both court martialled so there has to be a written record of this somewhere to prove that it happend, and if it had been up to me, I would have given them both some kind of medal for giving the British a small victory at a time when there were very few British victories... even if this was absolutely crazy, crazy, crazy....

Much of the charm of this film is due to the songs and newsreel clips which give us a feeling of those bad old days.  The dialogue, I suppose, is the writer's imagination but it is very , very funny.  Just imagine one old and brave but very crazy sargent leading another crazy but very young private, and both of them are impatient to go to war against Hitler... and so, they did.... that is what they did, they invaded France in order to fight the war.

There is also a young girl in England, who is attracted to the young boy, and another young girl in France who is also attracted to the young boy... which make the situation even funnier....

The ending is heartwarming, when these two crazy soldiers get punished for being A.W.O.L. but also applauded for their crazy adventure where they actually helped the cause and lived to tell about it... in jail, but not for long, and not too harshly, I presume.

Don't miss it.  This is one in a million.  I really loved it.  Exceptionally funny, and based on a true incident of the Second World War.",1403049600,,1965,4.327868852459017
2407469,5,B000B7MXFW,"We're always looking for a well-acted story that touches the heart and the funny-bone. This exceeded expectations.  Our household is 'older' and we avoid the gratuitous violence, sex. horror and foul language that seems to make up so much of today's offerings.  This droll look at two men who only wanted 'to matter and make a difference' was a surprising breath of fresh air and have recommended it to our extended family.  Other reviewers have mentioned difficulty in understanding the accents, but as we frequently enjoy British productions we had no problem.  Thanks for a great flick.",1399075200,,589,5.041237113402062
2407470,4,B000B7MXFW,"Very matter of fact and overall although not mind bending, definitely entertaining !! It projects the uncomplicated thinking of the era !!",1396828800,,138,5.318181818181818
2407471,5,B000B7MXFW,"My dad is a WW2 vet, so I am drawn to stories from that era, but I think I would have loved this movie anyway! The fact that it's based on a true story within a genuine historic setting was an added bonus.

Set in England and France, two soldiers, one a novice and the other a veteran of the conflict we know as WW1, are frustrated with their non-combat assignments and take matters into their own hands to get a piece of the action in the fight against Hitler and his forces. In their own bumbling way, they help the war effort and impact the British military all the way to Winston Churchill's office.

Not a comedy, but with great comedic elements, this film calls to the would-be hero in all of us. It displays in an engaging story how our best and courageous small efforts can make a big difference.

The story is the star here. The war elements are believable but not graphic, with loss of life implied. There are no gratuitous strings of epithets or steamy bedroom scenes mucking up the flow of a story with enough character in the characters to stand on its own.

I'm not strong on noticing production values, shot selection, lighting, etc. but there were no distracting, obvious flaws to jar one from the movie back to reality in midstream.",1392940800,,1249,4.441048034934497
2407472,4,B000B7MXFW,"Based on a true life event, the story moves rapidly with a sizeable dose of English humor. It manages to depict the frustration of those caught in the ebb waters of major conflict while concurrently surfacing what the conflagration truly is about.",1391904000,,247,4.904761904761905
2407473,3,B000B7MXFW,"enjoyable in a wry, British sort of way. it was produced and written by a good actor friend who also has a bit part init",1388707200,,120,3.84
2407474,5,B000B7MXFW,"Great stpry.hard to believe, but very entertaining.  A great movie based on British Army of WWII Recommend it for all WWII fans.",1386201600,,128,4.818181818181818
2407475,4,B000B7MXFW,"Checking on this movie before I watched it, I found out it was based upon a true story.  It was a belly buster for me, really funny, they they bungled across occupied France, and did a bunch of damage.  The wanted to fight but belonged to the medical corp.  They did a great job of character development, but I cannot believe these two people were that stupid.  They crossed the English Channel in a borrowed boat.

Looking up the Sergeant, I cannot believe he was that old or that stupid, In reality he  went through Ranger training and ended up a Major. The script writer added his imagination upon a true story and added some color in the characters. Very, very funny.",1385510400,,671,4.459016393442623
2407476,4,B000B7MXFW,"I was excited by the promotion information of this video and awaited with baited breath.  Was i disappointed, not really, nor was I given to being overwhelmed with joy at the start either.  This movie starts out slow and for the first fifteen to twenty minutes it pushes on at a slow pace requiring some very attentive watching to keep abreast of the plot.  I should say at this point that I did initially think that this was a comedy based upon a Home Guard type scenario AKA ""Dads army"".  I was however pleasantly surprised to find out that this was in fact based upon factual information.  This kept my interest level high as I am an avid Military History buff as well.  The plot starts to liven up as the two intrepid Dentists actually begin to achieve some of their goals and the icing would have to be the escape and the end to the adventure.

Overall, after starting out mildly disappointed I found I was reasonably impressed and given the fact that this movie was based on factual information I would recommend it to any person who likes WWII movies.",1332806400,,1058,4.479166666666667
2407477,2,B000B7MXFW,"I didn't feel let down, but had greater expectations. Piecing together previews is obviously an art. We don't recall hearing about this movie when it was in theaters and were tempted by the video preview. The movie was good enough we didn't feel we wasted our time watching it, but don't feel it's anything we would watch again. And our copy didn't include sub-titles either - some dialog was hard to follow.",1319587200,,408,4.680555555555555
8083167,5,B000B7MXFW,"This 2002 British comedy-drama film is based on a true World War II story.  This film shows the adventures of two army dental corps soldiers who sneak off on their own personal invasion of France, based on Raymond Foxall's book Amateur ""Commandos"" .  This film is a true gem in my opinion, and is one of my top 25 film picks of all time.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.",1517616000,,375,4.04054054054054
8083168,5,B000B7MXFW,War is sorta hell as shown here...Love the idea of two dentists shoved into battle.,1509408000,,83,4.6
8083169,3,B000B7MXFW,"Ok...I like the movie but it is, in no way, true to the facts. Yes, there was a SGT King and a PTE Cuthbertson. Yes, they stole pistols and grenades and went AWOL. And, yes, they ""acquired"" a boat and landed unopposed in France and carried out a four-day operation where they cut some wires and blew up a few train tracks. What's missing is the true backstory of the two Soldiers and what really happened during their ""invasion"" (King was not in The Great War). Although I greatly enjoy all the actors involved, they were miscast in the roles of two rather professional (and much younger) individuals and acted like Laurel and Hardy. If you would like to get the real story, read Raymond Foxall's ""The Amateur Commandos"" (quick, easy read).",1499904000,,740,4.613636363636363
8083170,4,B000B7MXFW,"A very cute, watchable movie that is based on a true story.  It seems like a made up comedy-two soldiers from the dental corps deciding to make a commando-like attack on Axis troops but this really happened.  The movie takes some literary license as they say but still a good flick.  In cheesy fashion, I loaned this to my dentist and his wife (she is a certified assistant and medical officer manager) and both loved it.  I mention this because I'm a career cop and I DESPISE cop shows and cop movies (well meow...except for ""Supertroopers""!)",1481241600,,543,4.625
8083171,4,B000B7MXFW,"Two Brit dentists go AWOL to get into combat - what could possibly go wrong?  This is actually a well written Brit comedy that is actually funny and even more so since it is based on actual events.

8083173,5,B000B7MXFW,"A charming tale recalling the tale of Don Quixote, full of humor, human foible and courage. Highly recommended, a fine-tuned window onto the British homeland during the fight against the Nazi foe.",1412380800,,196,5.15625
8083174,5,B000B7MXFW,"Delighted to have this film available for viewing. It was LOL funny. Phyllida Law as great as she was in Saving Grace,loved her scenes with Sir Derek. Cuthbertson was like Gomer Pyle. Always see Ken Cranham in ultra serious roles,even in Hot Fuzz,or in Hellraiser movie. My father was chosen for Paratroopers in WWII,not by his choice,so it has some significance to my family,esp at end when they give King & Cuthbertson the ovation!",1410134400,,433,4.864864864864865

8083176,4,B000B7MXFW,"Not particularly believable, even if it is based on true events. But you have to love the characters, the scenery, the color. There is just enough suspense without being gory, lots of unexpected humor, it's quirky and out of the ordinary. This movie is a lot of fun, whether you are a World War II buff or not. Highly recommend.",1406246400,,328,4.483333333333333
