7622005,5,B01B6DP298,"This movie WILL NOT be for everyone. It is gritty and haunting. Though it's described as a thriller, it's really not. This is not some jump-scare post-apocalypse movie. But, I did have to cover my eyes at times simply because some of the scenes were hard to watch. Outstanding performances from actors who speak very little dialogue. Movie contains relevant but disturbing scenes of violence and full-frontal nudity. This is an uncompromising, brilliant film.",1495324800,3,459,5.216216216216216

The concept was really cool and it looked promising but after awhile the movie just dragged and dragged with no direction.  This is something you watch for free on cable or get it for a buck.

7622008,5,B01B6DP298,"The post-apocalyptic world is really trending these days.  Here, there is some mystery about its cause - somehow linked to oil production but that could entail lots of things.  Anyway, a lone man (Martin McCann, the titular character) lives in a cabin, tending to his garden and, above all, safeguarding them and him.  Atavism is in play - the fruits of communication, innovation and thought are basically gone.  He has lost millions of years of evolution and is forced, for the most part, to relearn what those who came before already knew.  When a mother and daughter arrive on the scene looking for food, the Survivalist doesn't simply give some over.  He searches them thoroughly and accepts sex from the daughter as pay.  The duo manages to hang on and we see them crouching over the lackluster garden, trying to make a miracle out of nothing.  The intrigues also develop (intrigue being notorious difficult for one person only) as the story wends it way.  It can be a touch slow but it gains momentum and keeps your eyes fixed.  Much credit goes to the excellent cast and shrewd directing.  I've never seen atavism done so naturally before.  It's certainly a depressing and explicit film that some will likely hate but its brutal honesty in showing a world no longer connected to reality is fierce and worth watching.",1495152000,4,1323,4.779735682819383

7622012,5,B01B6DP298,"Set in the future where the fabric of society has unravelled and one man lives deep in the forest where he has carved out some land to grow crops and eek out an existence for himself.

Then one day a mother and her daughter turn up and offer an unusual  trade in exchange for food and shelter. His loneliness leads him to striking a bargain, but in doing so he will set in train events that could undermine the very survival he has been fighting for.

Filmed in Antrim, Northern Ireland this film is minimalist for the most part and relies on the interplay of the three main protagonists  who are all excellent. It is imaginatively and beautifully shot, making use of all that was available and turning what could have been a seen it before scene into something else altogether. It had a menacing, desperate quality and is up close and personal whilst always dealing with the base question of existentialism. This is a film you will remember and that is why I find this one where the hype was justified and as such can thoroughly recommend.",1471478400,7,1040,4.51595744680851

7622019,4,B01B6DP298,"I lean toward films that present clever and strong character development. I had absolutely no expectation of this in The Survivalist but I was pleasantly surprised. The director and actors carried out the difficult task of presenting moviegoers with nonverbal character development. The changes of intensity in their eyes, the slight nuances in the movement of their bodies, and just the energy that each of them exulted as they interacted with one another was impressive. For example (spoiler): When Milja and Kathryn plotted the murder of the survivalist by feeding him poisoned mushrooms, the subtle hint that Milja was bonding with the survivalist coupled with the nonchalant, yet empowering way she prepared the dish lead me to suspect that Milja was going to protect her man while rebelling against her mom in one swoop. Mia Goth's unpretentious and youthful personality that she displays in her interview (in the Extras of the DVD) affirms her stellar skills as an actor.",1511654400,2,978,5.1572327044025155

The two women who will do almost anything to stay ""safe"" and their ""plotting"" is not emphasized enough, leaving the viewer to ask them self what the women's complete story is and how they found their selves in such dire circumstances.

This is on the grim side as in too grim to really believe and I really liked the Road, but that managed to sprinkle in some uplifting moments in the horror.  If life was this bad for this long why would you bother?  They barely talk, never smile or laugh, and generally seem like zombies.  The setting seemed uneven as well with scavengers showing up, looting what they could, but they stay?  I mean once they were found wouldnt it make sense to leave?  If there was a compound not too far away why not join them?  At lest explain the circumstances they are in so things happening have some context and make sense.  Maybe this is what an apocalyptic event would lead too, but not sure that is a recipe for a good movie.

The movie indicates what it could be like if there ever was a holocaust or some type of destruction of mankind. It makes me realize how vulnerable we all are.

It reminds me also of Quest for Fire, though less optimistic, because this movie is telling the story of an end, not a beginning. No zombies nor aliens here, nor even contagious pandemics, only desperate humans, struggling for breathing for another day. in fact, there are almost no dialogues, because words are another kind of luxury when the civilization ends. Feelings themselves are another kind of luxury, but we cannot dispense with them entirely, not even in a deeply hostile world.",1500249600,,594,5.01010101010101

7622051,1,B01B6DP298,"Another testimony to the paucity of American imagination this film unwinds its absurd plot grindingly. The presumption is that in a post-apocalyptic scenario men and women revert to their archaic, beastly, sexually dominant and submissive roles and are incapable of reconstructing their world in a civilised fashion is a sad comment on the present society, not the future. For, in the absence of government, men and women left to their own devices probably do not behave worse than they do now; needing each other to survive imposes rules of honesty and civility.

Another absurdity, the progenitors unwillingness to surrender his gun, is even more a commentary on American society's love affair with the NRA and arms. Guns are pretty useless for hunting in areas where there is not an abundance of large game and they certainly do not guarantee survival or freedom.

I truly wish Hollywood would once in a while try to produce something a little more realistic. Or at least let someone else do it.",1499904000,,998,4.970059880239521

Drama, action, in depth into the characters, it was long enough in duration, but if it were 30-45 minutes longer, I would have even enjoyed it more, all who made this I could tell are very talented, experienced.

How did he not venture out and find more varied food sources and setup more of a perimeter.  That part didn't make sense to me, why wasn't he fishing?  Not using snare traps for animals either? His only defense items were a bush filled with can chimes and a single steel trap.  I would think in 7 years he would have built some dead falls, whip traps, tiger traps and more.  It just seemed impractical that he basically did the can chimes and gave up in all of seven years.",1495843200,6,789,4.172185430463577
7622084,5,B01B6DP298,"This movie is described as a thriller which I thought was perfect. I see people who say in their reviews that there was no plot but the plot is right in the title of this movie. ""To survive"" and just what people will stoop to in order to achieve that when one's in desperate situations.. It takes place in a forest somewhere in Ireland with no big hollywood stars . Just great acting and twists as for as who can trust who. I recommend it",1495756800,,438,4.1647058823529415

7622088,1,B01B6DP298,"I love wilderness type movies but the entire movie was filmed in a small patch of woods with a cabin.  It's a disturbing movie and if you have kids in the room I would not let them watch as there is a lot of full on nudity, even male, which you hardly ever see in films.  Stupid, no plot and no acting. After it ended my husband said ""boy you sure now how to pick the winners!""  Lol.  I said I go by the reviews...clearly misleading in this case.",1495670400,2,446,3.9775280898876404

7622090,1,B01B6DP298,"If only I could give this swirling ball of entropy masquerading as legitimate film 0 stars, as I believe it isn't even worthy of one. First off, there is absolutely no plot or storyline to speak of. There is no direction given or even hinted. Im not one who needs to be spoon fed the details during a film, so this wasn't, by itself, enough to warrant by harsh criticism. Keep reading. The acting was horribly overdone in efforts to make up for the seemingly low-budget this nonsense had, but failed at every attempt and ended up coming across as clumsy and unthoughtful. The soundtrack.....ah yes.....I see what you did there sound engineers.....setting the most sensitive mics on every square inch of the set to capture every single sound and nuance in another failed attempt to convey the isolation of the situation. All that was achieved by doing this was highlighting a very evident and tangible failure at creating ambiance and being edgy. Script? Nope, you won't find that here. Nothing meaningful or significant was said by anyone, and anytime during the ""film"". The storyboarding looks 100% stolen from ""The Walking Dead"", right down to the color filters, except it's missing every single thing that makes ""The Walking Dead"" amazing. So what do we have here? NO plot, NO script, NO acting, NO soundtrack, STOLEN storyboarding, and finally, NO entertainment value whatsoever. There was ONE redeeming segment of the ""film', and that's when the final credits rolled, because thats when this horribly written and horribly acted piece of garbage was finally over. I only wish I could get back all that time I wasted viewing this car-accident of film making. I saw someone on here mentioned this film being like ""evolution in reverse"". That would be devolution. I agree. This is a perfect example of the devolution of film making. Remember film school kids, almost no one can pull off the ""minimalist film"".",1495411200,,1910,4.91640866873065
