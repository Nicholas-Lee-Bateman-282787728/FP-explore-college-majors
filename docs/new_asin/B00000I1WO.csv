7909280,5,B00000I1WO,"I use ""Gay Youth"" in my developmental psychology class when I discuss adolescent cognition.  Gina--the 16-year-old lesbian in the second half of this documentary--is a bracing example of self-possession and compassion.  She confronts homophobia without becoming hateful herself.  And the scenes with her family as they openly discuss their struggles are heartfelt and funny and absolutely beautiful.  The real heart of this production, though, is with Mary Griffith, the mother of the young boy who committed suicide at age 20 because, among other things, he could not accept his sexuality.  Mary Griffith looks at her own complicity in Bobby's misery without blinking.  She makes the viewer feel Bobby's pain and her own regret without resorting to drama or excuses.  It's devastating to watch.  I also talk with my students about Mary Griffith's struggle to grow from this terrible tragedy and the grace she exudes as she seeks to rectify her actions.  She shows how change is possible, that we don't have to be trapped by our limited, bigoted views.  She is inspiring.",1309305600,,1071,5.174418604651163
