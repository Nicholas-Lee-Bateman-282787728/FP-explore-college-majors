1613834,5,B00005K3OF,"This is a great old sci fi/horror flick by that master Mario Bava.  This movie starts out with two ships in orbit around a planet.  You are treated to some really cool electronic sound effects/music and the best technobabble I have ever heard -- Star Trek has nothing on these guys.  The ships are sucked in to the planet at 60 G's -- only the heroic captain is able to withstand that kind of force.  The movie goes on to deal with what they encounter on the surface as they search for the other ship.
The special effects are a bit cheesy by today's standard, but not bad for a film of its time.  They are not overused to ill effect either.  The overall atmosphere of the film is properly chilling.
Some of the visuals, plot elements, and even music remind so much of Alien.  I have to suspect that Ridley Scott has seen this movie at least once.
I rate this film excellent and highly recommend it!",1004659200,38,898,4.309523809523809
1613835,4,B00005K3OF,"I've been a fan of Planet of the Vampires for almost 23 years now. As a child I used to watch it with religous fervor any time it was broadcast on television. Over the years Planet...has been treated rather poorly on both VHS (SP and EP Mode) and laserdisc. The results betrayed the true genius of Bava's magic. Such neglect is not found on MGM's fantastic bare-bones DVD. I have never seen Planet of the Vampires look better. I'm not sure how this low budget oddity will fare with ""sophisticated"" viewers but I would rank this as one of Bava's best. The dialogue is dumb as dirt but the scenery and eerie tension of the film rise above it's low budget constraints. Scenes like the dead rising from their space graves, tearing off the plastic body bags that encase their decaying bodies and the exposure of a dead crewman's skinless chest gave me troubled sleep for many nights as a youngster. I imagine some newcomers  will find this film silly but keep in mind Planet...was made in 1965 and has had an amazing influence on (just to name a few) Alien, Night of the Living Dead, and Event Horizon. I'd like to extend my thanks for those involved in putting together this wonderfully priced DVD.",1001635200,6,1194,4.553488372093023

1613837,5,B00005K3OF,"I stayed up late one night to watch this, 10:oo which was very late for me as a kid. I remember the scene of the vampires rising out of their graves that scared me so much. When Alien came out this movie came to mind. The special effects are as good as Star Trek , but the movie has a very original story and an ending right out of The Twilight Zone. Seeing it on dvd is like seeing it for the first time- the print is flawless and its in widescreen. This movie is simply beautiful. Although its not part of the official Mario Bavo collection by Anchor Bay  buying this edition is just as good and cheaper.",1000944000,5,606,4.092436974789916
1613838,2,B00005K3OF,"An amateurish low-budget movie, complete with shoddy special effects, weak sets, stilted acting, and an unbelievably corny script. Perhaps if this film had been made in the '50s, its many shortcomings could be more easily forgiven. As it is, there is not much to recommend here unless you are a fan of Mario Bava and just want to see all his films. As for Bava as a filmmaker, I'm struggling to find the appeal. ""Black Sunday"" and ""Black Sabbath"" are certainly worthy films, but the rest of his films I've watched (""Planet of the Vampires,"" ""Hatchet for the Honeymoon,"" and ""Bay of Blood"") are miserable, lousy movies that are downright painful to watch.",1000425600,4,654,4.79646017699115
1613839,3,B00005K3OF,"Half-decent science fiction thriller is worth checking out mainly for its eerie atmosphere and good production design. The story, centering around a group of astronauts investigating weird happenings on a remote planet, is basically okay, but a bit dry and choppy at times. Not many extras, but the print is bright and colorful, and looks great on DVD. However, you might want to rent this one first. And is it me, or does the excellent artwork on the DVD box (a strong suit of the MGM ""Midnite Movies"" series) look like it was drawn by the great Steve Ditko, in his 1960s heyday?",999561600,,580,4.640776699029126
1613840,3,B00005K3OF,"This film was made by Italian director Mario Bava who made a number of good horror films in the sities and early 1970's. This film was made on a slim budget, but they did the bet they could. They utilized left over sets from a  sword and sandal epic, then they pumped in the fog and covered the landscape with lots of vibrant blues and reds to really give it an alien feel. The story starts with a spaceship responding to a distress call from another ship in their fleet. They discover the crew has murdered each other, but then the bodies disappear. The crew is performing repairs and then some of their members disappear one by one. They are forced to kill each other and then invisible alien invaders take over their bodies.  The plot is fair, but the odd camera angles and the look of the planet help to make this one worth seeing. This film is sometimes very strange, but sometimes near brilliant considering what little they had to work with.",992304000,12,948,4.442528735632184
1613841,4,B00005K3OF,"I know that the DVD is not out yet as of this writing. I am reviewing the VHS version.
If you are a fan of the original ALIEN, like James Cameron and I are, you will love this movie. Not so much for the plot, but for the many things in it that will remind you of the ALIEN and ALIENS movies that came later. Here are just some of the similarities:
1) They are answering a signal that has been sent from the planet, 2) Helmets setting on consoles like they were in ALIEN, 3) A somewhat cheesy landing sequence like ALIEN, 4) The planet surface will remind you of the one in ALIENS, 5) The round hatch is similar to the 3 openings on the green, horseshoe shaped ship from both ALIEN & ALIENS, 6) In order to keep production costs down, the two ships that visit the planet are identical both inside & out. This way, the same interior/exterior sets could be used for both ships. A distant shot of the identical ship will also remind one of the horseshoe shaped ship.
And,  On one visit to a derelict ship, they come across huge, skeletal figures which will remind one of the skeleton in the  horseshoe shaped ship. There are more things like these, but I will let you discover them yourself.
The music score is similar to the one in FORBIDDEN PLANET, with lots of electronic sounds, rather than real instruments. However, an electric guitar is obvious in this score.
Barry Sullivan, the American lead, obviously speaks his own lines. However, if the Italian actor's voices were dubbed in, this is one of the best looping jobs in a movie that I have ever seen!
The voice of the doctor Carron (not sure of spelling) sounds just like Paul Frees. Frees was a frequent voice in the Rock/Bullwinkle cartoons and he was also a news reporter in THE WAR OF THE WORLDS movie. You can also see him a little in a scientist role in the original THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD. I am not sure if Frees is the voice, but it is a dead ringer for his.
Despite the plot holes, this is sure worth the price that Amazon is asking for the CD, even if it does not have any special features. I am ordering the CD version right now.
Enjoy it and always watch the skies!

1613873,4,B00005K3OF,"I'm just chiming in to agree with everybody that, yes, this movie probably had some influence on Ridley Scott either before or during the making of Alien. The mysterious signal from an unknown source; ancient ruins of a crashed spaceship and its giant, fossilized pilots; and a fog-bound planet that obscures the top half of the shuttle as it lands on the planet's surface. You'll notice all this and more. The biggest difference between the two movies is that Scott had uniformly excellent actors to work with. Another big difference, of course, is the abundance of gore in Scott's film.

I'd gladly give this movie five stars, but beneath its glossy set design and art direction, there's not much more to it besides bad acting and a rather average boys' sci-fi adventure tale. The movie runs for about 90 minutes but feels like it's 2 and a half hours long because of the slack pace.

Make no mistake, its a beautiful film to look at. It will also make you question your admiration for Alien (that is, if you admire Alien), because I could make the same complaints about Scott's movie--extravagant sets and beautiful art design camouflage a thin, hackneyed plot about a creature running amok in a spooky old house. At least Bava's ultimate alien terror is a mindforce that turns humans into zombies, which is (as far as it goes) a fairly original premise. Scott's alien creature turns out to be just another guy wearing a monster suit.

I can safely recommend this movie to Alien aficionados. Anyone else might wonder what all the fuss is about.",1429401600,,1547,4.743494423791821
1613874,5,B00005K3OF,"One of my favorite science fiction/horror movies of all time. What Bava did with his miniscule budget is almost beyond belief.

1613875,4,B00005K3OF,"Saw this when I was eight years old (mid 40's now) and it still holds up. This was the first movie that incorporated lots of things we take for granted these days in sci-fi: like leather plug-suits and techno-babble. Though there's mild-sexism indicative of the times (ladies faint, even though they're given guns - oy vey!) it's not as overdone as it is in other films of the era. You'll notice immediately that yes, the makers of Alien saw this film too, as did King a la Tommyknockers--but the titles misleading. The baddies aren't vampires, but they're creepy all the same.

Very atmospheric, and is as fascinating to watch now, as it was when I was kid. (loses a star because of my feminist sensibilities). Definitely worth the price of the rental doe SD, but if you can catch it in HD on MGMHD, do it!",1424908800,,807,4.527397260273973

Bava  boldly paints a broad cinematic masterpiece with his brush that is rivaled by few, cost notwithstanding.

The shots, angles, colors, lighting, views, every detail, they are all presented with deft precision closely knitted to form a wondrously harmonic masterpiece of sight, sound, and color.

The scene where the grave opens and it's cover plate rises is nothing short of astounding. Anyone that has dared to spew a negative review here frankly has lost all credibility to review a movie IMO.

As far as the DVD presented here, it looks and sounds wonderful, I'd love to see this on a blu ray, but I can easily live with this DVD forever if that does not happen.

1613915,5,B00005K3OF,"This sci fi feature inspired and influenced so many later films that have gone on to be blockbusters or cult films. Both Alien and Lifeforce owe a lot to this Bava masterpiece. The movie was one of Bava's few treks into the realm of the week-end matinee movie making. I first saw this on a Saturday afternoon in our local theater with Frankenstein v.s. the Martian. Out of the two Planet of the Vampires was the far superior.
The movie is all studio bound but Bava does what he did best and that is make you believe your are on a whole planet. Sets were well utilized and Bava makes good use of colors. There is so much done with so little which is a Bava hallmark. Film makers today could never accomplish what Bava did then and with so little.  Great film must have for sci fi collectors. Good transfer on dvd.",1391990400,2,812,4.30718954248366
1613916,4,B00005K3OF,"That's right, PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES contains no vampires. Not a one. That's because the original title is TERROR IN SPACE which makes it sound more like ALIEN which it closely resembles or vice versa as this Italian-Spanish co-production was made in 1965, 14 years before Ridley Scott's epic. He and writer Dan O'Bannon swear they never saw this film but you watch it and decide for yourself. It's available as an Instant Video or you can purchase the DVD. If you do, make sure it's the MIDNITE MOVIES / American International version as it contains the best print out there. It was AIP who decided to rename it POTV as they thought it would sell more tickets.

The movie was Italian horrormeister Mario Bava's second foray into science-fiction after CALTIKI: THE IMMORTAL MONSTER (1959) where he was the director of photography. Having explored the possibilities of color in HERCULES IN THE HAUNTED WORLD (1961), Bava let his imagination for visual composition and background lighting run riot in POTV. The film is saturated with primary colors and lots of fog combined with ultra modern set interiors that remain with you long after the film has finished. It's also obvious that Gene Roddenberry was familiar with it too as there many parallels particularly in spaceship and set design between this movie and STAR TREK which premiered 2 years later.

The plot is very familiar to us now. 2 spaceships answer a distress call on an uncharted planet. Right before landing the astronauts attack each other and one crew survives. Headed up by Barry Sullivan (the only American in the cast) they land and explore the surface discovering no signs of life only the wreck of a ship of long dead giant aliens. They bury their crew from the other ship and try to make repairs only to have the dead crew members return to life possessed by the planet's actual life forms who exist as points of light. What they want and what happens make up the rest of the film which results in a twist ending that you may or may not see coming (NO SPOILERS HERE).

The dubbing is above average for a movie of this type while the performances by an international cast are about average. However it's not the story or the performances that make PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES great, it's the hallucinatory visuals combined with the (then) modern spaceship design and the cool black leather spacesuits. The bottom line is that it's an enjoyable way to spend an hour and half no matter what it's called and it has more alternate titles than just about any film I can think of. THE DEMON PLANET, PLANET OF TERROR, PLANET OF BLOOD, THE HAUNTED WORLD, and SPACE MUTANTS are among the best known ones.",1391299200,,2661,4.706008583690987
1613917,4,B00005K3OF,"I watched this again after seeing it many years ago.  It moves slowly, but has a lot of interesting features that seem to have been the inspiration for later movies.  One spaceship looks like the Star Trek Enterprise, another resembles the alien ship that was crashed on the planet in Alien.  Not sure why it's titled with 'vampires' because the aliens take over the dead more like zombies.  Maybe I missed the point.

Set far in the future when space travel is routine, Planet Of The Vampires features many elements fairly common to the space fantasy genre, as two huge spaceships, the Argos and the Galliot circle the planet Aura, trying to track the source of a distress signal.  While in orbit, a strange force pulls the Argos down to the planet's surface.  Upon touching down, members of the crew apparently go mad and begin attacking each other.  Captain Mark Markary (Barry Sullivan) manages to restore order.

What happened remains a mystery, and the crew of the Argos leaves their ship and heads off on foot to try and locate their sister ship the Galliot.  Trekking through the alien world, the survivors come across the Galliot.  The ship is intact, but they find only dead bodies, and evidence that the apparently crew killed each other.

Featuring an invasion by entities that can't be seen, but have the ability to take over and control their hosts when they lose consciousness, Planet Of The Vampires isn't your typical alien attack story.  The subtle ""body snatcher"" approach may be intriguing to some, but may disappoint those expecting a more traditional battle between man and alien.

Much that happens is silly, and the dialog is often unrealistic, but for an Italian production where almost everyone but Barry Sullivan was dubbed, the results are quite good, as Mario Bava appears to have more than achieved his goal.  As is often the case with Bava, he gets a lot of bang on a limited budget.  The special effects while dated, like some goofy ray guns, are generally entertaining.  The crew is dressed in distinctive black uniforms, and the sets are quite striking, colorful, and dramatic.  And the film features many examples of the director's cinematic expertise.

In fact, Planet of the Vampires can be quite enjoyable to lovers of underground sci-fi flicks. It is not boring. The idea is cute. It is visually interesting, and has an ending that is supposed to pull the rug under viewers' feet. Namely, viewers initially are led to think that the crew on the ship is composed of humans, but in the end we learn that they are human-like individuals.

This little trick, however, is ruined by a terrible oversight during the first 5 minutes of the film: one of the members of the crew makes a remark that could have been made only by an inhabitant of Earth. This man says that if it were not for their anti-meteor-crashing device, the ship would look like a piece of ""Swiss Cheese""! Now why would beings from another galaxy use an idiomatic expression that is used on earth?

1613978,4,B00005K3OF,"Attention: SPOILERS IN HERE, but not major. If this movie had been made with a bigger budget, it would have been remembered like Forbidden Planet. It shares some elements with that movie, in that a crew of humans land on a planet where a previous ship had landed previously, to check out why there had been a lack of communication from that first crew. That's the first major similarity, but it's not ripping it off. Also similar to FP is the discovery of a once inhabited planet. In forbidden planet, the Krell found a way to turn themselves into energy beings and destroyed themselves. In this movie aka ""The Demon Planet"" which I think is the more suitable title, we're not sure what happened to the natives. At least I wasn't. We know they are energy beings now, but not if they are the descendants of the beings which occupied the giant skeletons which the second crew, the main focus of the movie, found. I plan to actually find the book it was written from, I found the movie that intriguing. So the Krell destroyed themselves in FP but our planet ""Aura"" has hidden energy beings which attack the humans mentally in order to possess their bodies so they can leave their planet whose sun is in its last epoch of life, making their planet soon uninhabitable. Some crew members get picked off individually, as in ALIEN, but they start sticking together after that to be safer. The alien entities seem to be able to invade their bodies when they sleep or are weak willed. Indeed, ALIEN, STAR TREK seem to have borrowed, if unintentionally, from this flick, as it borrowed, I'm sure unintentionally, from Forbidden Planet. The ships in this flick look a little like the federation ships and they have a scanner on board and shields! There is no feel of rip off in this movie, just some good similarities that can and should be explored in other directions.
  I thought it had a great plot, it was not straightforward. The giant skeletons were a great mystery to discover. There was great scenery too, as others have mentioned. Combined, all these elements together with a bigger budget for more props and a few really good special effects would have made this like FP or something like that. Mario Bava should have made more sci-fi. There are some good horror moments when the aliens invade the newly dead humans, and good moody music throughout. There was no one 'jerk' character who thought he was cock of the walk either, I wasn't hoping for anyone to get killed off.

some reviewers pan the film because it doesn't meet the sci-fi film standards of early 21-st century hollywood (in special effects, pacing, and dialogue). this is unfair. in chronology, this film falls between forbidden planet (1956) and 2001: a space odyssey (1968). in a way, this film serves as a tribute to kubrick: watching this film, you can see how high kubrick raised the bar.

It is a little slow at points, but in general, it entertains.

Quite a cast and crew that produced this one.  It's an American International picture, written by the same writer who wrote Angry Red Planet and whose outlines inspired Irwin Allen's Lost in Space:  Ib Melchior.  And the director, Mario Bava is best known as a horror director, whose work Twitch of the Death Nerve, considered one of the first slasher films, was imitated in American theaters with Friday the 13th.  The actor Barry Sullivan I found, was a character actor all through the sixties and seventies, with parts in shows like Kung Fu, Hawaii Five-O and The Streets of San Francisco.

Blue planets whiz by as we sail into the velvet blackness, with the usual violins and weird musical accompaniment.

What strikes me is the roominess of the ship.  This was made in 1965, so I expected the effects to be better than a fifties sci-fi flick, but the lack of budget is fairly apparent.  The leather outfits with high collars, biker helmets and gray instrumentation were interesting if allowable.

The techie talk is really awesome, the jargon a bit much but fun to listen to.  Kinda like the techno-speak on Star Trek.  ""In sixty fractions of megon, we'll start the landing maneuver.""  Cool!

They're about to make a routine landing on the planet Aura with their sister ship.  Suddenly radio communications are blocked from the sister ship.  They are gripped in some kind of gravitational force and land quite hard on the planet below.  Good stuff so far.  The actual ship model that lands and the lighting a bit cheesy for 1965.

As soon as they land, they start beating each other up!  And then don't remember doing it!  Are they being taken over by some kind of invisible beings or (shall I say it?) VAMPIRES????  ..

Not really.  Despite the title, there are no vampires, just some invisible beings who want to take over bodies, living or dead.  They prefer dead and a bit beat-up.

The movie does its best to build suspense but it goes a little long for me.  Not a bad chiller on a midnight view.

The twist ending is worthy of Rod Serling.

Definitely worth the rent, though not as thought-provoking as The Angry Red Planet, the undead do have a great time!

1614015,3,B00005K3OF,"Although this 1965 film is an Italian production, directed by the famed Mario Bava, it was released by American International and stars American Barry Sullivan as the captain and main protagonist. Its original Italian title is (translated) ""Terror in Space,"" which is better than the American title ""Planet of the Vampires"" (also ""Demon Planet"") seeing as how there are no blood-sucking vampires anywhere to be seen.

THE STORY: Barry Sullivan commands a spaceship that goes to a strange unknown planet in response to a distress call from another ship. They soon discover that the creepy planet is home to incorporeal aliens who desire their bodies and ship to leave the planet.

Although ""Terror in Space"" came out a year before the original Star Trek appeared on television, both the film and Star Trek borrow heavily from concepts introduced in the ground-breaking ""Forbidden Planet"" (1956). It should be noted that ""Terror in Space"" did not technically come before Star Trek since the first Trek pilot episode ""The Cage"" was filmed in 1964. And the second pilot ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" was filmed at about the same time as ""Terror"" in 1965.

POSITIVES: I've heard a lot of good things about this film over the years, in particular the ultra-cool black leather uniforms with nazi-like emblems and the atmospheric creepiness of the planet, and was not disappointed.

In addition, the film features two women -- a redhead and a blond -- as prominent figures in the crew of the spacecraft, a notable thing for 1965 (although keep in mind that Gene Roddenberry featured a female first officer in ""The Cage"" a year before). Both of these women are stunningly beautiful, enhanced by the black leather uniforms.

Although the film borrows heavily from ""Forbidden Planet"" its story is original and innovative. So much so, in fact, that Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" (1979) ripped-off every main aspect of the first half (!!). No kidding. In defense of ""Alien"" Scott did take these concepts and made a BETTER sci-fi/horror picture.

NEGATIVES: The film is from 1965 and therefore has dated sets and effects, comparable to the original Star Trek tv series. If this fact turns you off, stay away.

Unlike ""Forbidden Planet"" and the original Star Trek the story isn't very compelling. Yes, the set-up is interesting but by the 35-minute mark I was highly tempted to tune out (and did the first time I tried to watch it). It's hard to say why the story isn't compelling despite the film's numerous innovations, but one reason for sure is that, unlike Star Trek, the crewmembers are bland and lack distinction.

Some point out that ""Terror in Space"" is a darker version of the original Star Trek. This is true only in the sense that the sets and uniforms are darker; certainly not in the sense that it's more serious and mature. I say this because Star Trek was ultra-serious and mature right out of the gate; for verification 9 out of the first 10 episodes were dark, serious and mature in the truest sense -- ""The Cage,"" ""Where No Man Has Gone Before,"" ""The Corbomite Maneuver,"" ""Enemy Within,"" ""The Man Trap,"" ""The Naked Time,"" ""Charlie X,"" ""Balance of Terror"" and ""What Are Little Girls Made Of?"".

FINAL ANALYSIS: If it were 1965 I'd give ""Terror in Space"" a solid B+ (4/5 Stars), but since it's been so outdone by the original Star Trek and ""Alien"" I can only honestly rate it C+. Regardless, it deserves a revered spot in any sci-fi/horror aficionado's video library.",1225411200,4,3463,4.8559322033898304

1614020,4,B00005K3OF,"First of all ""Planet of the Vampires"" is not about vampires, it is about aliens taking over the bodies of a group of space explorers. It alternates between science fiction and horror. Although directed by legendary horror filmmaker Mario Bava, it is technically science fiction. The production design and premise were heavily influenced by ""Forbidden Planet"" and would itself provide much of the inspiration for ""Alien"".

Bava is generally acknowledged as the founder of the ""gialli"" style of Italian horror/thrillers, which is characterized by a much greater focus on the deed of murder (whereas other styles emphasize the solving of the murder). They also have a lavish and lush look and in this regard could be thought of as the opposite of the ""film noir"" style. Dario Argento is the other acknowledged master of ""gialli"".

If you are looking for a sci-fi film heavy on atmosphere, with very original cinematography, and featuring the all-time coolest black leather space suits; then ""Planet of the Vampires"" is a must see.

There is also a subtle anti-fascist political message. Note that the crews of both the Argos and the Galliot wear Nazi ""SS"" lightening flash insignia and that the disciplined and militaristic natures of the crewman make it far easier for the aliens to successfully impersonate them. The ending implies that 1930's fascism was actually an attempt by the invading aliens to take over the earth.

Bava appears to cheat a bit to make the ending a bigger surprise. It is possible that this may just be the English dubbing which assigns earth names to the crew members and has the alien referring to them as humans.

The scene with the bodies of dead crewmen rising up out of their graves still wrapped in clear plastic is extremely eerie.

As in ""Alien"" the two spacecraft are lured to the planet by mysterious radio signals and find an earlier victim of the same trap. Both ships are damaged upon landing and an alien presence is able to turn various members of the crew into violent killers.

As the engineer works to repair The Argos, its crew is slowly being taken over. Most of the suspense comes from the race to fix the ship before everyone falls victim to the alien possession. But eventually the captain begins to worry that a successful repair will furnish the aliens with a means to leave this planet and invade his unsuspecting home world.

A historically significant film that is still very entertaining.

1614052,4,B00005K3OF,"I don't think I've seen a film that went by as many different titles as American International Picture's Planet of the Vampires (1965) has over the years...there's Terrore nello spazio, Demon Planet, Planet of Blood, Space Mutants, Terror en el espacio, Terror in Space, The Haunted Planet, The Haunted World, The Outlawed Planet, The Planet of Terror, and my personal favorite, The Planet of the Damned, which, I think, is a more appropriate title than the one used here, but whatever...directed by the legendary Mario Bava (Black Sunday, A Bay of Blood), who also co-wrote the original version, the film features Barry Sullivan (Shark!, Earthquake), along with a slew of foreign actors, mainly Italians, I'm not really familiar with including Norma Bengell (The Murdered House), ngel Aranda (Satan's Blood), Evi Marandi (Agent 077 Fury in the Orient), and Fernando Villena (The Blind Dead 4).

The film opens in deep space, as we're aboard a futuristic looking ship named The Argos, which features about the biggest control room I've ever seen...seriously, it's huge, and includes a whole lot of unused space...at least there's lots of room to move...anyway, this is one of two ships traveling towards a distant planet called Aura.  Apparently some sort of signal is emanating from the mysterious, fog shrouded, world and The Argos, along with her sister ship The Galilea, and have come to check things out.  After losing contact with The Galilea, Captain Mark Markary (Sullivan) and his crew finds themselves in trouble, as The Argos is caught in some sort of gravity well, one that is drawing the ship towards the planet.  After an emergency landing, the crew finds themselves in the grip of the space madness, attacking each other for no, apparent reason (it's like they turned Klingon), but eventually they manage to snap out of it, with no memories of their actions.  After spotting their sister ship off in the distance, the captain and a few hardy individuals hoof it on over, across a barren, craggy, molten wasteland, only to find the crew of The Galilea in bad shape, i.e. they're dead, Jim.  But are they?  After the `away team' buries the recently deceased and returns to The Argos we discover the ship is damaged to the point where they can't take off, which is really bad because, due to the wacky orbit of the planet, if they don't leave in like three days, they'll never get home.  The engineering dude says he might be able to make repairs enough for them to take off, or blow up (that's reassuring).  Only problem is crewmembers keep disappearing, and the bodies previously buried don't seem to want to stay buried...turns out the crusty fog planet is inhabited by unseen creatures that have their own designs for The Argos and her crew, ones that don't necessarily entail a peaceful co-existence, if you know what I mean.

Overall I really enjoyed this, creepy, highly atmospheric science fiction thriller, and it was really interesting to see various concepts in this early film adapted in other, more poplar films released later on, specifically Ridley Scott's 1979 feature Alien.  At one point the crew finds a large, derelict alien spacecraft, complete with skeletal remains of some rather large beings...sound familiar?  Now I'm not saying Dan O'Bannon, who wrote the story for Alien, stole the idea from Bava's film, but one can't help but notice various similarities between the two films.  One aspect that really sets this feature apart from many of the science fiction films of the time is the attention to detail regarding the overall atmosphere.  This may have been a modestly budgeted feature, but it's hard to tell given the expansive space ship interiors and creepy, intimidating landscapes of the alien planet.  One thing's for sure, Bava certainly knew how to set the mood utilizing effects, such as lighting, fog, spooky electronic scoring, etc. to create rich, vibrant, and imaginative backdrops for his features.  The pacing can get a bit slow here, but I really didn't mind, as there was so much to take in visually.  Something I really appreciated were the special effects in this film, often incorporating miniatures mixed in with live action footage, looking very realistic.  Whoever was responsible for this did an outstanding job, given the technology available at the time.  I'm no special effects expert, but I have seen enough films to provide an opinion towards this aspect, respective to when the movie was made.  As far as the acting goes, well, it works well enough for the film, but none really stood out as being overly impressive, partly due to the sometimes odd and expository dialogue.  The Captain's signature line seemed to be ""I'll explain it to you later.""  Another kind of goofy aspect was how, after a mysterious, unexplained occurrence it wasn't unusual for someone to make an incredibly intuitive deduction that was right on the money...it was almost as if the characters in the film were privy to the script.  One example of this is when a crewmember, apparently in a trance, tries to steal a vital component from The Argos, only to be stopped by Captain Markley.  Afterwards he tries to describe what happened, and another states his mind must have been controlled by some malevolent alien force inherent to the planet.  I suppose one would have eventually come to that conclusion, but given how little information was available at the time, it seemed like an amazingly accurate hypothesis.  These various, astute deductions seemed almost uncanny at time with regards to their accuracy.  I did like the mixture of males and females in the cast, along with the fact the female characters were relatively strong ones, expected to perform the same duties as their male counterparts, and not there just to serve coffee and such as was commonplace in films like this of the time.  There are a few unintentionally humorous bits throughout, my favorite being when the captain and a female crewmember were investigating the giant, derelict alien ship.  The female crewmember touches a disk found on the ship, only to get one heck of a shock, issuing an appropriate yelp.  The captain comes running over, asks what happened, and then proceeds to touch the very same object she did, receiving the same shock...it's like going to a restaurant and having the server delivering a plate of food and issuing a warning that said plate is very hot.  After she leaves, what's the first thing you see people do?  Touch the damn plate...but I digress...if you enjoy classic science fiction films oozing with atmosphere and don't mind sometimes overly talky characters, then this feature would definitely be worth your time.

The picture on this DVD, presented in non-anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1), looks very sharp and does justice to Bava's glorious, often haunting visuals, and the Dolby Digital audio comes across extremely well, highlighting the highly excellent and appropriate musical scoring.  The only extra available is a slightly worn, original theatrical trailer.

If I learned anything from this film, it's that if you ever find yourself on a derelict alien spaceship, don't go flipping switches...by the way, I almost forgot to mention why I didn't care for the title of this film...there aren't any vampires in the film, at least not in the tradition sense.",1138665600,13,7334,5.0024671052631575

Nothing could be further from the truth. Even at this early point in his career, one can see how talented a director Bava is.

Clearly shot on a low budget, like Roger Corman, Brava, by using some very clever camera approaches and wonderfully creative sets (its' quite obvious the makers of the Alien films used this along with other 1950s' B-movies as sources)constructs a film that is both intelligent and engaging.

An interplanetary crew from Earth, answering a distress signal from another planet, land and get more than they bargained for. Very smart, underplayed and scary.

1614056,2,B00005K3OF,"The dialog borders on the absurd; the optical effects aren't up to par even for a 60's science fiction film; the actors frequently give zombies a good name. Yet, despite its major drawbacks, Planet of the Vampires stands as an influential film. When making Alien Ridley Scott took his cue from this imaginative but low budget film. The alien planet, spacecraft and many of the more atmospheric sequences clearly were an influence on Scott's highly praised horror film (it's stretching it to call Alien a science fiction film). It's also clear that POTV had impact on director Tobe Hooper's Lifeforce.
So will you enjoy this movie? That depends on how forgiving you are. Mario Bava's direction and the cinematography are quite imaginative and the atmospheric production design make this a triumph of style over substance. Because this was shot in Rome (with a mixture of American and Italian actors), the acting and dubbing adds an odd quality to the film. Barry Sullivan's frequently detached performance isn't one of his best but given that his director and almost all the crew didn't speak English, It's understandable.
Bava's direction and the inspired production design make this a very influential minor film classic. It's clear seeing the film again after some years, that Bava was trying to create an atmospheric Forbidden Planet and he suceeds for the most part. While Planet of the Vampires lacks the intelligent script and lively performances from that classic film, its imaginative cinematography engage the viewer in a way that FP couldn't. Again, if you can forgive the movie's shortcomings and the minimalist screenplay, you'll enjoy this film.
A couple bits of trivia about the film: the story is basically an atmospheric variation on Invasion of the Body Snatchers; Planet of the Vampires had at least three or four different titles (some of them within the United States itself); Star Trek: The Next Generation borrowed  (or it was just one of those ideas in the air)the concept of POTV for an episode entitled Power Play from season 5.
The transfer is crisp and the colors vivid. I haven't seen a print this good since College. The widescreen presentation doesn't provide a huge advantage over the pan & scan version that's floated around for quite some time. This film wasn't shot in an anamorphic format and the aspect ratio is only slightly different than the traditional t.v. aspect ratio.
The mono soundtrack sounds fine although a bit flat (even for a mono soundtrack). It wouldn't have hurt to offer a track that reprocessed it for surround sound or, at least, to have tried to open up the sound a little bit. You won't be listening to the frequently clunky dialog but the soundtrack is interesting. It's clearly inspired by the atonal ""effects"" music track used for Forbidden Planet.
This Midnite Classic includes the original over-the-top American International Pictures trailer. Curiously, the dialog is only available in English and the subtitles in Spanish and French. Given that it's an Italian production, it would have been interesting to hear the film in its native tongue. There is a problem worth noting--the default setting for subtitles causes the film to automatically show the Spanish subtitles for the film everytime you start the flick. This problem has cropped up with one or two other Midnite releases from MGM. It's not a major problem just annoying.
It's a pity that this bare bones presentation doesn't include an overview by a film historian. It's important to understand the influence that Bava's film had on the 70's and early 80's. Perhaps someone else will license the film (doubtful) and do the job. Planet of the Vampires has a lot of positives and a few negatives as well. While it's not quite as good as it was to an 11 year old 20 plus years later, it's still an inspired bit of film making.",1054339200,8,3848,4.947449768160742
1614057,2,B00005K3OF,"Directed by Mario Bava and based on the short story ""One Night Of 21 Hours"" by Renato Pestriniero. Along with IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE, this also inspired ALIEN. It centers around a space expedition to a barren planet, Aura. But once the crew lands, members suddenly become given to random acts of violence against each other, caused by the ""vampiric"" mind control the planet has over them.
PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES (aka DEMON PLANET) is generally rather daft and wooden and is only saved by Bava's visual flair. Watching this, it feels as though you're watching a long lost episode of DR. WHO. This is the first Bava movie I've seen, I wasn't totally impressed after all the raves I read of BLACK SUNDAY and TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE. Maybe the next film of his I see will live up to my earlier expectations. Personally I just found this to be dull and plodding.

1614059,4,B00005K3OF,"With a title like PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES and a largely Italian cast dubbed to English, I expected this film to be little more than grade B sci-fi schlock--and indeed the first few minutes of the film gave me no reason to revise that expectation.  The producers of note (in this case really more importers than producers) are none other than Samuel Zarkoff and James (aka Jack) Nicholson, a partnership that produced a stream of tacky 1960s horror flicks; the opening special effects were dated as only 1965 special effects can be; and yes, the dubbing was evident.  So I was greatly surprised when, about fifteen minutes into the film, I realized that it was holding my attention in a way I never imagined it would.
One of the most astonishing aspects of the film is how much the opening scenes of 1979's ALIEN resemble the pace, style, look, and plot of PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES--so much so that a claim of co-incidence would be difficult to believe.  Like the later film, PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES finds a spacecraft investigating a beacon that may indicate intelligent life, only to find themselves on a misty, dark, and yet strangely fascinating planet that harbors a very hostile life form--and where they find an ancient, derelict spacecraft complete with calcified alien remains.
But whereas ALIEN doesn't really get underway until the explorers leave the planet, VAMPIRES finds the explorers trapped on the planet--and possibly forever.  The script is rather prefunctory, but the cast (which includes Barry Sullivan, Norma Bengell, Angel Aranda, Evi Marandi and Stelio Candelli) plays it in a tight-lipped and business-like manner that actually lends it a certain degree of credibility.  But the real star of the film is the tone director Mario Bava brings to the piece: a combination of languid tempo and hypnotic visuals that keep you glued to the screen--not so much via suspense as by style alone.
PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES isn't a film that will have you on the edge of your seat.  Indeed, in many respects the story is remarkably predictable--and any one taken aback by the ""surprise"" ending obviously doesn't get out too much.  But it is a fascinating thing to watch, and sci-fi/horror fans who like their films heavy on atmosphere, interesting cinematography, and truly remarkable designs will want this one their shelf.

1614060,5,B00005K3OF,"It amazes me how many intelligent reviewers forget that when this film was made, nobody had done anything like it, how scornfully the public at large viewed sci-fi movies, and how primitive the technology back then was compared to what we have now.  This was an italian movie, so yes, the dubbed voices are going to cast a pall over the performances (which were quite competent if you are an italian, it is only us americans and brits who speak in monotones, the rest of the world emotes).  The costumes were inspired, the atmosphere was creepy, the story was original (if the viewer has the imagination to understand that this came long before the imitations he or she had no doubt seen first) and actually, by 1965 standards, it WAS rather gory (more so than contemporary Hammer films)!  Few US-made horror flicks from that year, or the next couple of years after, were quite as grisly (Herschell Gordon Lewis aside, but Bava's film is done with a dead serious tone, and it isn't about gore but mounting fear).  Though the movie shows its age now, perhaps the problem here lies in the fact that for many years after its release, it gave the impression of being more modern than it was. The first half of this film you have seen re-made almost blow-by-blow as ""Alien"" many years later (including a primitive but nevertheless impressively ""artsy"" fore-runner to the Space-Jockey scene).  But there is no monster, and the rest of the film involves alien life-forces in search of bodies to inhabit, and almost turns into a zombie film.  Moody, fog-shrouded sets with wailing winds add to the tension created by the famed Mario Bava's eerie directing style(his ""Black Sabbath"" inspired certain scenes in Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"").  Bava uses his trademark psychedelic lighting and literally uses smoke and mirrors to obscure the low budget of the production (as he pioneered in ""Hercules in the Haunted World"" where he was in charge of lighting). Bava's work is essential for understanding the evolution of the horror film, and this one is essential for understanding the sci-fi horror film in particular.

A spaceship encounters hostile aliens on a remote planet.  The creatures seek to inhabit the bodies and minds of the space travelers.  Hence, the sensational title.  No space age Dracula to report.  Barry Sullivan is the ship's captain.  The rest of the crew are obscure European actors, including the obligatory beautiful women in tight fitting leather space suits.  Sorry, it's not that kind of a story.  I find it curious that female scientists on rocket ships in B movies rarely look as if they are academic types.  The story unfolds with a brooding air of mystery.  The color photography is dark and dreary, and enhances the grim mood.  There is a great plot twist during the last few minutes that is a real treat for first time viewers.  Bottom line, this European sci-fi flick from the '60s is good fare for genre fans.

1614084,5,B00005K3OF,"With little fanfare, MGM has quietly transferred a handful of great B films to DVD that they not too arbitrarily categorize as ""Midnight Movies.""  The nice looking digital prints are in their original theatrical format and appear as if they were taken from original material. The discs come with no substantial extras but care has been lavished on the box art, often reflecting the lurid lobby cards and posters of their initial release.  Even acknowledging the B category, these are for the most part fairly well-crafted and, well, almost adequately acted.
Italian shockmesiter Mario Bava's ""PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES"" was released under at least a half dozen other titles, including ""Planet of Blood,"" ""Space Mutants,"" and ""Demon Plant.""  And, perhaps to further enlighten, the screenplay was adapted  from the Italian sci-fi short story that translates in English as ""One Night of 21 Hours.""  Wonder what that means, if anything?  Missing time, apparently.
In any event, these various titles say it all. If you get my drift.
Barry Sullivan stars and gives the dark material everything he's got.  Which, frankly, is not a whole lot. The show biz rag Variety actually said of this off beat title: ""A psychological thriller that should keep the young on the edge of their seats.""  On the edge trying to figure out what's going on. Or maybe, on the edge after dozing off.  It's open to interpretation as is the movie. Warning:  Don't dare see this one in an altered state --  there may be no return.

1614085,1,B00005K3OF,"This is a cheesy, made in Italy, sci-fi flick, starring BArry Sullivan as commander of a space ship. While in flight, his ship gets signals coming from an unknown, dying planet. Another space ship responds to those signals and lands on the planet. While communicating with that spaceship, communication is cut off. Attempts to revive communication fail.
Barry Sullivan decides to land his ship on that dying planet and check out why they were unable to communicate with the other crew. When they land on this bleak and desolate planet, they discover that the crew from the other ship is dead. So, they bury them.
Unfortunately, they will not stay buried, as the planet is inhabited by another, superior race who takes over the bodies of the dead, as well as the living. Barry Sullivan leads the battle against them, as they fight their way off the planet. Once in the air, however, the viewer gets a big surprise.
Not even the surprise ending, however, makes up for the flaccid dialogue, the cheesy sets, and the bad acting. Even the title  is bad. This film has nothing to do with vampires, as here the undead do not resort to sucking one's blood. Do yourself a favor.

1614086,3,B00005K3OF,"Normally when someone says that a horror film is ""not for everyone,"" what they mean is that there's something about it that's just a little too intense for most viewers. That is definitely NOT the case here. ""Planet of the Vampires"" is not a particularly gory film, nor is it really very graphic, nor is it even really all that fast-paced. Actually, it's slow. Really slow. But...
Basically, it's a good movie for one of three audiences:
1. Nostalgists who remember this movie and others like it from Saturday matinees on TV.
2. People who like to watch movies to make fun of them...you know, old movies, made when movies were bad. I hate these people and like the idea of them throwing money at the folks who put out the Midnight Movies series. Better than that blowing all their excess income on WWF memorabilia.
3. Students of film, i.e., movie geeks. The open-minded viewer will be able to see through the awful dialogue, not-so-hot acting and general lack of action, and just bask in the lurid atmosphere that Bava creates for the alien world of his film. The color (bloody reds and luminous greens, primarily)is amazing to just look at, and the sets are worthy of much perusal. Not to mention an opening theme that really is creepy as hell, and somehow manages to make the first scenes -- which appear to depict a Go-Bot floating against a black curtain with holes poked through it to allow a flashlight beam to dimly shine out -- slightly unsettling.
Mind you, ""Planet of the Vampires"" is rarely more than slightly unsettling, and frequently much, much less. There is little plot, not much happens, and there aren't any vampires. I'll be honest and say I was kinda hoping for some whacked-out Italian vampire space goddess to appear, some kinky approximation of Barbara Steele in full cosmic vampire regalia, exposing much skin and gnawing at the necks of hapless spacemen with her wicked fangs, but no. Sadly, no. It was not to be. My hopes were dashed. No slinky vampire women, no Barbara Steele, just some reanimated dead fellas who stumble around and cause trouble. But...
I don't know, there are a few scenes that are genuinely cool. The emergence of the zombies from their graves is great. The climax of the film is -- amazingly -- rather suspenseful, almost shocking in that nothing else in the movie is. And the ending, while a science fiction cliche, works here because you never see it coming.
Further, film geeks of varying degrees will be stunned at first how Ridley Scott (blatantly!) swiped from ""Planet of the Vampires"" for the (so much better it goes without saying) ""Alien;"" how John Carpenter swiped the setting and the general plot of intangible aliens possessing human bodies for his (superior) ""Ghosts of Mars;"" and how...okay, maybe this one is just me, but it seems plausible...Lucio Fulci appears to have stolen the last scenes of ""The Gates of Hell"" (little kid emerges from Bava-ish mists to come into view and be revealed as a zombie) from a scene about two-thirds of the way through ""Planet of the Vampires!""
Can so much genius have been mined from one film that is (most charitably) more style than substance, and (least charitably) not really that great a flick on its own terms? Well, it sure looks like it. Unbelievably, ""Planet of the Vampires"" has evidently been influential on a lot of moviemakers; if nothing else, it should be seen for that reason.",1015977600,6,3392,4.750847457627119
1614087,4,B00005K3OF,"Well, I believe it now.  When I was in film school, one of my instructors told me that all the stories that could possibly be told were done prior to the 70's; anything else is just a re-make.  Ridley Scott ripped off Mario Bava, John Carpenter ripped off Mario Bava, and I'm sure there are plenty more!  I have 7-8 Bava films now in my collection, and it's so obvious that modern filmmakers have stolen ideas and scenes directly from Bava's films.
""Alien"", no doubt in my mind, was conceived using ""Planet of the Vampires"" as a basis.  All they had to do was create a frightening, living alien for that film series -- everthing else was written for them here!
But on to reviewing the DVD:  You won't notice them right away, but as the film progresses you'll enjoy the beautiful women featured.  They are Evi Marandi and Norma Bengell.  As they change costumes or remove parts of their opening wardrobe, they will become more visible.  They are your typically juicy, delicious women in a Bava film but in this movie there's no reason for them to be sensual.  They're still fine to look at, and it was great that Bava used more than one woman in the crew back then.
The DVD picture is rather nice -- beautiful and strange colors and the film is rather sharp for its' date.  All colors, mist, bubbling, etc. are rendered nicely from this old film.
The soundtrack is the real treat.  This is a mono soundtrack, but it again has the enveloping sound like ""Blood and Black Lace"", so if you have multiple speakers different sounds will come from different places.  The unusual spaceship, planet, and space sounds are quite effective.  The only problem with sound here is that during obvious loud parts the sound fades away.
I'd say this film will appeal to science fiction fans more than the horror/gore fans.  But if you insist on building your Mario Bava collection like I have, then you will want to own this remarkable DVD that holds up today as a very nice space epic.  Surprise ending -- something that ""Alien"" did not have.

1614089,5,B00005K3OF,"""Vampires from outer space possess the living and resuscitate the dead!"" Sounds like an Ed Wood tag line but it's actually the plot of Planet of the Vampires, the sole foray into the 'pure' science fiction genre by gothic horror maestro Mario Bava, best known as the father of the giallo movie and director of the seminal Italian horror masterpiece Black Sunday/The Mask of Satan. Planet of the Vampires overlays Bava's moody gothic visuals on an entertaining pulp SF script penned by Bava, Ib Melchior (Angry Red Planet, Reptilicus, Time Travelers), and a half dozen other writers. The plot (containing some interesting parallels with Colin Wilson's The Space Vampires) is fairly absorbing; there are some well-handled action scenes (and the usual fast zooms); Barry Sullivan is credible as Mark Markery (?!), captain of the spaceship Argus; and Norma Bengell (The Hellbenders) and Evi Marandi (Revenge of the Barbarians, Paris When It Sizzles) are easy on the eyes as Sanya and Tiona (everyone looks great in those black leather space suits). But what really distinguishes this movie are its imaginative visuals and doom-laden atmosphere; Bava's ""demon planet"" is no gray, dusty moonscape; it looks more like a day-glo hell: twisting, jagged rocks, dripping slime, boiling, smoking pits, the atmosphere dense with slowly swirling clouds of smoke and fog, lit by random splashes of electric blue, green, and red. Inspired moments include: creeping ground-fog used (a la Black Sunday) to signify encroaching evil; the resuscitated vampires ripping off their plastic shrouds in slo-mo; and the humans discovering the gigantic skeletal remains of the planet's former inhabitants. On balance, some of Bava's low-budget in-camera tricks and forced perspective shots, so effectively utilized in B&W in Black Sunday (check out the excellent commentary by Tim Lucas on Image's DVD), fall flat here in color; the spaceship/starfield scenes are only marginally better than the horrible effects in all those crappy Antonio Margheriti-directed Italian 1960s space operas (War of the Planets, Wild Wild Planet, etc.); and the sets suffer from that 'too clean' appearance that usually afflicts historical costume epics. But overall still probably the best pre-2001 SF movie of the 60s and an intriguing look at a different side of Mario Bava, especially for those familiar only with his gothic horror and giallo titles.
As with their other Midnight Movies releases, MGM-UA's DVD package is minimal but of excellent quality. The picture quality of the letterboxed trailer is very good to excellent, if marred somewhat by light-to-moderate speckling and blemishing. French and Spanish subtitles and 16 chapter stops are the only other extras, but the feature itself looks pretty fabulous. The brightness, contrast, and shadow/highlight detail of the 1.85:1 letterboxed source print are excellent throughout. The color by Pathe looks as good as it probably ever did, with rich saturation and reasonably accurate fleshtones. The image is not as razor-sharp as some other similar MGM releases, but more than acceptable. Physical damage is limited to some very light, sporadic speckling. Well worth grabbing for Bava cultists or ""silver age"" SF aficionados.",1010966400,8,3238,5.401185770750988

7942700,4,B00005K3OF,"Just a general warning: ""Planet of the Vampires"" has no vampires in it. Not even vampire-like aliens.

But if you can get past the issue of there being no Space Dracula, then ""Planet of the Vampires"" is unlikely to disappoint. This little cult movie is more like a hybrid of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and ""Alien,"" especially the heavy, haunting dread that hangs over it -- and though it has the same ray guns and hokey spaceships as many other sci-fi movies, Mario Bava gives it a gothic quality that few others had.

When they pick up a distress call, the captains of the starships Argos and Galliott decide to land on the planet Aura, so they can assist whoever is stranded there. But during the Argos' descent, the crew is suddenly seized by the desire to strangle each other to death, and only the intervention of Captain Markary (Barry Sullivan) is able to snap them out of it. To make matters even worse, they discover that the crew of the Galliott wasn't so lucky. All of them are dead.

As they repair their damaged ship, the crew begin to suspect that something strange and terrible is happening on Aura. Sleepwalking, vanishing corpses, ghostly visions and a string of murders haunt them, and the discovery of a strange alien spaceship indicates that this has happened many times in the past. Something terrible and cruel is alive on Aura -- and unless they can escape soon, the crew may suffer a fate worse than death.

""Planet of the Vampires"" is a movie that sounds like it should be hilariously cheesy at best, and simply bad at worst. After all, this is a sci-fi movie from the 1960s, which contains bodily possession, zombies, ray guns, rocketships, and a Star-Trek-like planetary set. But Mario Bava was a maestro of the horror genre, and he gave ""Planet of the Vampires"" a hauntingly creepy atmosphere that few other sci-fi movies can match.

Part of this comes from the creepy setting, which is full of fog, gore-splattered corpses and the half-buried skeletons of ancient aliens. Little by little, Bava reveals how very screwed the crew is, and that this nightmarish scenario is not a random accident. But it's also HOW he reveals this -- through glimpses of the dead walking in the distance, through glimpses of something out of the corner of your eye, through a crushing claustrophobia that settles around the shadowy, dark spaceship like the mist. It gives everything a magnificently gothic feel.

And despite the low budget, Bava managed to make Aura a genuinely scary place -- the artfully-placed alien skeleton and the constant rolling fog give the standard alien planet set a creepy look. The one part of the movie that doesn't quite work is the futuristic vinyl jumpsuits, whose collars are so high and stiff that they would keep the wearers from effectively turning their heads.

The various actors all do an excellent job, especially Sullivan as the fatherly captain who fears that his entire crew is going to end up dead, but isn't entirely sure what he can do to protect them. Norma Bengell, Angel Aranda, Evi Marandi, Ivan Rassimov and Massimo Righi are all solid, whether they are playing increasingly desperate crewmen or cold-blooded zombies. Perhaps the only problem with the acting is is that it's a bit too easy to spot when someone is possessed.

""Planet of the Vampires"" has no vampires, but it does have a solid cast and skin-crawlingly creepy story -- especially for those who like their horror and sci-fi to have a slow, suspenseful burn. Just try to ignore the hokey title and covers.",1479859200,,3536,4.775777414075287
