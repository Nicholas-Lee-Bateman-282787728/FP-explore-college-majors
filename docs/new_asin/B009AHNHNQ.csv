8538422,5,B009AHNHNQ,"Exactly what i wanted to find out about the steam engines in locomotive, how it works, with some technical details. I was finding online the inside of the locomotive, the descriptions but never clear explanation how everything works when put together. Great video. I think I'll rent it again to show it to my kid.",1475884800,,313,4.709090909090909

8538424,5,B009AHNHNQ,"There are so few videos that get into the specifics of how to run a steam locomotive that this find was a very pleasant surprise.  Much of the information was basic with a few surprises sprinkled in.  They give you a nice look inside of the fire box, boiler, and smoke box. My only problem was that it would not play on my computer even though it meets the system requirements and all software was up to date.  But, I was able to watch it on my phone with their free app.  I'll watch it again but will avoid longer videos until the issues with showing on my computer are resolved.",1377993600,,580,4.198198198198198
8538425,3,B009AHNHNQ,"This video was okay, but dry. In all senses of the word. Unfortunately, while there is much detail regarding the nuts and bolts (literally) of Steam Locomotives, the engine was static-- not fired. That said, it was still interesting. My kid liked it a lot too. He watched it three times.",1359849600,,287,4.647058823529412
8538426,3,B009AHNHNQ,"The narrator knew his stuff but came across as pretty dull and uninspiring.  Granted, the subject was pretty dry, particularly when there was no attempt to operate a train and used for example one that was torn down.  It is surely educational and I did learn something.  I think one of the myth busters (dare I say Carrie) could have made this a better, albeit more expensive, video.",1350864000,,383,4.602941176470588
8538427,5,B009AHNHNQ,"For those who like to ask questions, Lewis Carroll Epstein favors you with a journey 'down the smoke stack' into the bowels of a 19th century steam engine.  You descend with him into the cavities of the firebox and the smokebox, places you've barely imagined, and behold the boiler between them.  Only the curious need to take his hand on this trip for the details are rich and thorough.  If you've ever marveled at one of these behemoths, this is for you.",1347926400,2,456,4.536585365853658
8538428,5,B009AHNHNQ,Extremely detailed explanation of  a steam engine. And it is actually filmed inside. Amazing shots that most people will never see otherwise. Highly recommended for train affectionados.,1347580800,,185,5.851851851851852
