8129912,5,B000GAKNOW,"Got this and 2 others of Mesner's from the library.  The kids LOVE them (3, 6, 8).  Although he takes some liberty with the story (they are folktales so this is certianly allowed) it all fits with his wonderful, refreshing, KID-BASED humor.  They giggle through the whole thing, time after time.  Need to find a collection of multiple shows for purchase!",1196467200,,354,4.754098360655738
