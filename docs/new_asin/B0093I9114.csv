5256088,4,B0093I9114,"Except for the Pepe Le Pew disc, this release probably has the best selection of any of the new-to-DVD Super Stars collections.  There are still three mid/late 1960s total stinkers and two previously released shorts but the ratio is much more favorable than the Bugs, Daffy, Road Runner and Foghorn Leghorn sets. WB is still dumping a little bit of refuse on us but they've evidently learned not to go overboard with it. Even better, this includes 3 more of the neglected director Arthur Davis's toons.

My only regret is that, with the dwindling of unreleased Porky color cartoons, they couldn't have also included Brother Brat, Daffy Doodles, Little Orphan Airedale and Nothing But the Tooth instead  of the three bad ones or the two repeats. I'm not quite sure where those shorts will find a home now unless they decide to release a Porky collection which includes black-and-white toons since there aren't enough unreleased color ones to fill a second disc.

Still---glad to see that this series is not dead.",1347235200,18,1011,4.894736842105263
5256089,5,B0093I9114,"Those who thought that the SuperStarts collection would be discontinued are wrong. It's continuing with an awesome collection of Porky Pig cartoons. Two of which have been previously released to DVD in the golden collection, but that doesn't bother me much as the rest of the shorts are being released to DVD for the first time. All of which I still have on video cassette, but I am sure that it will be nicer to see them on DVD in a beautiful restoration.",1347148800,7,456,4.506024096385542
5256090,5,B0093I9114,"The Looney Tunes Super Stars series continues with Porky & Friends: Hilarious Ham. This collection features a whopping 18 shorts (12 of which star Porky Pig) and the list is very promising (although 2 have already been in the Golden Collection series). The shorts are as follow:

1. Tom Turk and Daffy
2. Wagon Heels (previously in the Golden Collection Volume 5)
3. Mouse Menace
4. One Meat Brawl
5. Curtain Razor
6. The Pest That Came to Dinner
7. Riff Raffy Daffy
8. Boobs in the Woods (previously in the Golden Collection Volume 1)
9. Dog Collared
10. Thumb Fun
11. Fool Coverage
12. Corn on the Cop
13. Corn Plastered
14. Gone Batty
15. Ant Pasted
16. Dog Gone People
17. Bunny and Claude: We Rob Carrot Patches
18. The Great Carrot Train Robbery

Now if you watch Looney Tunes on Cartoon Network, chances are you seen some of these cartoons with old transfers (and odd transfers like Ant Pasted having a PAL Master and Fool Coverage having an NTSC master with ghosting issues). All these cartoons will be restored and remastered to beautiful glory as always with the addition of them being in original full screen and having a widescreen option for the Post-53 shorts (like I said, the Post-53 shorts will be in full screen too). You can now see Porky classics such as Mouse Menace, Fool Coverage, Riff Raffy Daffy, and Curatin Razor with new remastered transfers and if you're also a fan of the Seven Arts era of Looney Tunes, you'll be happy to know that Bunny and Claude will be on the set too (infact, their entire filmography is included!). All this plus 2 Elmer Fudd shorts and 2 great one-shots; Corn Plastered and Gone Batty.

5256091,3,B0093I9114,"Since the Super Stars series contains mainly new to DVD cartoons (unlike the Esssential series and the Platinum Collection) this is very good news for the Looney Tunes fans. Sadly, most of Porky's more then 150 movies are unavailable on DVD, so this is still short of great news. Some of the Looney Tunes have smaller filmographies (Speedy, Roadrunner and Coyote, Tweety, Foghorn-who already has a super stars collection)-so maybe WB can at least give us complete collections of them, until the Full Collection will come one day?",1346457600,2,529,5.0227272727272725

This is a part of the Super Stars DVD series, now you have heard that they said they ended the series but they lied (mostly Wikipedia). Here's the list of cartoons that will appear on this release (there's a total of 18 shorts, 16 new-to-DVD and 2 double dips):

*Tom Turk and Daffy (1944) A good one
*Wagon Heels (1945) appeared on LTGC Vol. 5
*Mouse Menace (1946)
*One Meat Brawl (1947)*** Haven't seen in a long time but I know it's funny
*Curtain Razor (1949) Amazing
*The Pest That Came To Dinner (1948)**
*Riff Raffy Daffy (1948) Great
*Boobs in the Woods (1950) appeared on LTGC Vol. 1
*Dog Collared (1950)**
*Thumb Fun (1952) My favorite
*Fool Coverage (1952)** One of Daffy's hilarious performance
*Corn On The Cop (1965) Decent
*Corn Plastered (1951) Very funny
*Gone Batty (1954) My personal favorite
*Ant Pasted (1953) Too good to be hilarious
*Dog Gone People (1960)
*Bunny And Claude: We Rob Carrot Patches (1968) I hate this!
*The Great Carrot Train Robbery (1969) This sucks too! I wish they would stop releasing the 7 Arts. Looney Tunes shorts on DVD and Blu Ray! They're one of the worst cartoons ever! I hate all of those 7 Arts Looney Tunes shorts!! That's why I only gave this 4 out of 5 stars.

Note: The back cover contains screenshots from ""Tick Tock Tuckered"" (1944), ""Nothing But The Tooth"" (1948) and ""Daffy Doodles"" (1946) which are not going to appear on this release. But hopefully they will fix it and put screenshots from the shorts on the DVD and we hope Nothing But The Tooth and Daffy Doodles will appear on the next Looney Tunes DVD releases or on the next Platinum Collections after vol. 2 (Tick Tock Tuckered is avalible on the Daffy Duck Super Stars DVD).",1346371200,46,1960,4.610315186246418

5256113,4,B0093I9114,"I think this is a pretty good DVD. It showcases 16 new-to-DVD shorts (while two were reused from the LTGC series). My only complaint (hence the ""4"" star rating instead of 5) is that some of the cartoons (specifically two) lack satisfactory restoration: 1) ONE MEAT BRAWL, whose end card is the 1995 ""Dubbed Version""; and 2) RIFF RAFFY DAFFY, which has a somewhat bright/faded image (though this was probably a fault of the film's original production process and not of the remastering).

While not perfect in terms of quality, the people at WHV did a great job with the short selections for this release. Porky Pig himself stars in 12 of the 18 featured cartoons (and almost all of his shorts here are from the pre-'53 era so they're pretty much his best). One of his cartoons called CORN ON THE COP, which was released by DFE in 1965, is also a good one. Besides these 12 Porkys, there are also 6 other shorts, most of which were directed by Robert McKimson: two one-shots, two Elmer Fudds (one directed by Friz Freleng), and both ""Bunny and Claude"" shorts from the Seven-Arts era. Not a bad mix!

The thing I like most about this DVD, however, is that unlike earlier LTSS DVDs that had 15 shorts per disc and faux widescreen matting (except for the Pepe Le Pew disc which had 17 shorts and less widescreen options), WHV has now decided to remove the widescreen options completely and throw in *18* shorts. In my opinion, this trade-off would make the series a lot better if it kept going this way. I bought the LTSS Sylvester and Hippety Hopper DVD today (which was released after this Porky set, only a few weeks ago, and also features 18 shorts and no matting), and it is GREAT! Keep up the better work, Warner Bros!

P.S.- Here's something interesting I figured out about possible future DVDs in this line. If WHV keeps releasing more titles with the new ""18 cartoons per disc"" rule, they could do a ""Yosemite Sam"" DVD with his unreleased filmography. 15 of his ""classic"" shorts have yet to see a digital release (as do both of his ""revival"" shorts which have only been shown as special features on other LT DVDs), so they could even throw in one of his previously released cartoons or, better yet, one of Bugs Bunny's solo cartoons that also has yet to be released on DVD, since he's Yosemite Sam's most frequent rival.

It's really amazing to think about how more content can be configured onto DVD sans unnecessary special features.",1367625600,4,2440,4.589449541284404
5256114,3,B0093I9114,"Considering all the incredible Porky Pig cartoons in the Warner Bros. animation library, this could have--and should have--easily been one of the best entries in the ""Looney Tunes Super Stars"" DVD series.  But the shorts used here are an uneven mix.  While most of the Porky cartoons on hand are entertaining, they're not quite cream of the crop...especially when compared to the contents of the Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Pepe Le Pew volumes.  The last third of this set is made up of non-Porky cartoons, even though there was enough material to make this a complete Pork-fest, and not all of these represent Warner Bros' best.  The compilation is rounded off by BUNNY AND CLAUDE (1968) and THE GREAT CARROT-TRAIN ROBBERY (1969).  Designed to spoof the 1967 Warren Beatty/Faye Dunaway hit BONNIE AND CLYDE, the two Bunny & Claude shorts lacked the zest of earlier Looney Tunes lampoons and time has not been kind to them.  While it's still worth getting, this volume could have been so much more.  The next release in the Super Stars series, ""Sylvester and Hippity Hopper,"" promises to be better.",1366675200,,1097,4.865591397849462
5256115,5,B0093I9114,"Another fun collection from the Looney Tunes cartoons. Most of these feature the speech impaired Porky, though there are a handful of others in the mix.

5256119,4,B0093I9114,"I've been looking all over the Wal-Marts and Best Buys in my area for this one and they don't carry it, so I'll buy it here.  I'd be in heaven if Warner Bros. decides to release a DVD with about 20 of the black and white Porky Pig cartoons from 1936 to about 1942, a time when Porky was THE star of Looney Tunes.  Perhaps a dozen of these early Porkys are on the Golden Collections but there are probably about 80 others from this time span that have not been released to DVD.  Nevertheless, this collection has some great stuff that is finally coming to DVD.  Perhaps my very favorite on this set is Curtain Razor which has Porky auditioning a series of hilarious stage act hopefuls, beginning with a grasshopper hamming up a opera aria during the opening credits and ending with a fox swallowing explosives and blowing himself up.  Curtain Razor in particular is a testament to the amazing talent and versatility of legendary voiceman Mel Blanc.  Three of my other favorites are Thumb Fun, Fool Coverage, and Riff Raffy Daffy (all of these have Porky with his most frequent co-star, Daffy Duck).  Would have loved to see Daffy Doodles (Robert McKimson's directorial debut) on this one.  We do get Arthur Davis' directorial debut (Mouse Menace) at Warner Bros. (he had directed cartoons for many years at the Columbia studio before he came to Warner Bros. with Frank Tashlin in 1942).  From what it sounds like, Mouse Menace was the direct inspiration for a cartoon segment Chuck Jones created for the otherwise utterly forgetable movie Stay Tuned (robot cat pursues mice).  I'm also looking forward to One Meat Brawl (which has Porky and the dog from the Foghorn Leghorn cartoons going after a saucy gopher).

At any rate, if Warner Bros. decides to compile a collection of Porky's earliest cartoons, here's what I'd like to see:
* The Blow Out (actually the first cartoon where Porky doesn't appear with Beans the cat, who was meant to be Looney Tunes star of the late 30's.  In this one Porky innocently tries to return a bomb to a mad bomber so he can get some money for a sundae)
* Boom Boom (Porky and Beans as World War 1 doughboys with a hilarious commanding officer)
* Plane Dippy (Porky tries to join the Army Air Corps and ends up piloting a robot plane (amazing that aircraft engineers predicted drones way back in 1936))
* Porky's Duck Hunt (Porky encounters a variety of obstacles while hunting, including the debut of the duck that would become Daffy)
* Porky and Daffy (Daffy is a boxer and Porky is his trainer.  Daffy at his absolute craziest whose best gag has him riding an imaginary bicycle)
* Porky and Gabby (One of a couple WB cartoons directed by legendary former Disney animator Ub Iwerks.  Grouchy Gabby Goat was inspired by Donald Duck over at Disney, but he didn't last)
* Porky's Badtime Story (Bob Clampett's directorial debut, which had Porky with Gabby again.  Clampett remade this one as Tick Tock Tuckered with Daffy in the place of Gabby)
* Porky's Hero Agency (Porky fights against Medusa in this unique Greek mythology themed cartoon)
* Rover's Rival (Porky's new dog makes trouble for his ancient dog, Rover, but Rover shows up the newcomer in the end
* Porky's Movie Mystery (Porky spoofs Japanese detective Mr. Moto, a popular WB movie serial character at the time)
* Naughty Neighbors (Probably my favorite team-up of Porky and Petunia Pig, who play the heads of feuding hillbilly families who want to make peace)
* Porky's Tire Trouble (The highlight of this one is Porky's dog turning into rubber)
* We the Animals Squeak (Porky has only a small role in this cartoon.  The main story is that of a mother cat who is a champion mouser whose kitten is kidnapped by mice.  The mice demand that the mother cat stop hunting them or else they'll kill the kitten.  Of course, the mice are thwarted.  One of the few cartoons of the time where the cat was the hero and the mice were the villains).

As for the other early Porky episodes, I'll let WB pick them.  I wouldn't mind if they double dip Porky in Wackyland, The Film Fan, Porky's Hare Hunt, Porky Pig's Feat, Porky's Preview, I Haven't Got a Hat, or Gold Diggers of '49 because all of these were excellent.",1352678400,4,4200,4.603217158176943
5256120,4,B0093I9114,"Poor Porky! Acting as representative of the lesser lights in Warner cartoondom! With half of the Warner library already out, the bottom of the barrel's gotta be scraped some time. There are several from the 1960s, when the energy had inarguably disappeared completely from anything bearing the Warner logo.  This disc also features the home video debut of CORN PLASTERED, the greatest worst cartoon the studio ever did in its heyday.

We're also seeing the quality of the restorations slipping. The colors aren't as bright, and the picture isn't as clean as we've been accustomed to. In the case of ONE MEAT BRAWL, it hasn't been restored at all - merely the 1995 ""Dubbed Version"" from Turner.

Fortunately, there are enough funny moments to recommend this compilation without hesitation, most of them courtesy of Daffy Duck. TOM TURK AND DAFFY is one of Chuck Jones's cynical masterworks, and THUMB FUN and FOOL COVERAGE are among some of the last hurrahs from the Bob McKimson unit. Art Davis's RIFF RAFFY DAFFY still looks fairly crummy unfortunately. With the restoration budgets shrinking by the day at Warners, I don't think we're seeing it as good as it could be, but the cartoon may have just been processed badly at the lab when it was made. (I've had garbage film prints of this title dating back to the 1950s.) But don't take my word for it - it's a fun release that will surely evoke nostalgia of watching the cartoons on television, and most of the titles are solidly presented.

Please take note that in spite of saying so on the case's back cover, none of the cartoons are offered in ""widescreen"". Let us hope that Warner Home Video will no longer stay committed to this lie that the cartoons were designed to be seen this way.",1352246400,11,1742,4.720394736842105
5256121,3,B0093I9114,"When it has came down to the Looney Tunes cartoons on video for the past several years, there have been so many compilations from the classic Golden Collection from Volumes 1-6, and lesser-known collections from the Platinum Collection and the Looney Tunes Superstars compilation which have been more mixed after the ones that Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck were released. It seemed like Warner Brothers obviously should've kept the winning streak going after the release of the Pepe Le Pew DVD Zee Best Of Zee Best which was completely worth its effort and money. Because every Pepe Le Pew short was featured, with no shortcomings whatsoever. It has been a long time since Porky Pig had a cartoon release himself. It has been nearly 20 years since the most successful pig in show business has had a video compilation released. With Porky celebrating nearly 80 years as one of Warner Brothers most successful cartoon characters, the pig has shown no stopping in funny laughs. Now a new Porky Pig compilation has been released, with some keeping up with Porky's funnies, and others saying That's All Folks?

Looney Tunes Super Stars Porky & Friends: Hilarious Ham isn't as exactly a complete compilation of what has made Porky Pig so delightful in animation, but shows a bit of promise with many cartoons that haven't been released on DVD before. The collection isn't a bad delight for die hard Looney Tunes fans, but since the first compilation of Porky Pig cartoons came out in 1985, as part of the Looney Tunes 24 Karat Golden Jubilee collection came out, no definitive collection of Porky Pig cartoons has been perfect, and has always wanted to be better than the one before it. The collection nevertheless includes some of Porky's greats though including Tom Turk & Daffy where Porky is out to hunt a turkey for Thanksgiving dinner, and instead gets a craving for duck instead, and Dog Collared where Porky gets caught up on Be Kind Of Animals Day and winds up being caught up in love with a overexcited dog, and Riff Raffy Daffy where a homeless Daffy is seeking shelter and a place to sleep from the comfort from the cold night, as officer Porky tries and arrest and through Daffy away from seeking comfort, all the way to Fool Coverage where salesman Daffy tries to offer Porky an insurance policy with more than just limits. The compilation fairs well, but there are still nearly half a dozen of cartoons that aren't Porky related that are on here as well like Bunny & Claude and the lesser-recognized sequel where a fierce bunny couple are stealing carrots for their own game, and hunted down by a hard-headed sheriff and Dog Gone People where Elmer Fudd takes care of a unusual dog whom thinks he is like regular people and instead treats Rupert like a regular dog.

* are shorts without Porky Pig in them

All in all, I have honestly expected more cartoons from Porky Pig in them to be here on DVD. He has been either a sideman for Daffy Duck or a straight-pig himself in so many cartoons in the 1930's and 1940's. But there could've been so much more here to make it stand out as a great buy. I really was expecting more with this collection to make Porky & Friends: Hilarious Ham a excellent buy for the Looney Tunes Super Stars collection. Hopefully, Warner Brothers will get the next one right. They had turned a fork well before, but this one isn't completely the bacon that Porky had brought in with for Warner Brothers for nearly 80 years. No it isn't all folks that should be here, but was could've been thought of to make it a great buy.

The first eleven of these DVD shorts are prime Porky culled from Looney Tunes' golden era (Boobs in the Woods, One Meat Brawl, The Pest That Came to Dinner), including a handful of winners by underrated directors Arthur Davis and Robert McKimson. Mixed in towards the end, culled from the studio's dwindling years, you'll find a poorly rendered Porky/Daffy (Corn On the Cop), and Dog Gone People, an Elmer Fudd episode hampered by Hal Smith's unconvincing imitation of the late, great Arthur Q. Bryon. The less said about Bunny & Claude, two of the last Looney Tune characters to roll off the assembly line, the better. One of the finest efforts in the Looney Tunes Super stars series, Porky & Friends is a rollicking refresher course for people who mainly remember the rotund one for his ""Th-th-that's All Folks"" sign off.
