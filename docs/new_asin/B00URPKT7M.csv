7068014,2,B00URPKT7M,"we have here another story of the life of a paranormal investigator being tormented by a parasitic evil spirit which earned this movie 2 stars instead of one; simply because of the importance of making people aware that such a possibility does exist; like tourists, pets and luggage being used as drug smuggling ""donkeys"".

Unfortunately, this film is ruined by a poor script which focuses too much on the interpersonal problems within the team, which quickly falls apart.
The members of this group of ghost hunters are depicted as being incomprehensibly stupid with personalities to match.
The special effects are boring, conventional and completely unoriginal.

nobody expects a Spielberg production, but it's not unheard of to accomplish something substantial and satisfying out of very little; provided one actually bothers to make the attempt at preserving at least a modicum of intelligence and integrity in their work, which this writer/director obviously could have cared less about.",1432512000,5,991,5.387096774193548

7068019,5,B00URPKT7M,"First off I want to give full disclosure. I am friends with the film maker and I admire his abilities as a special effects guru, seeing his amazing work in several local New England horror films. This is Jordan Pacheco's first attempt at making his own film and he doesn't disappoint.  I watched this film under it's original title Provoked. To tell the truth I am not a fan of ""ghost movies"" but I did love this one. American Poltergeist tells the story of a group of amateur ghost hunters trying to get definitive proof of a haunting. So far they have failed and one of the group's most ardent believers is starting to lose faith. They get called in to investigate a particular nasty haunting where the spirit seems to enjoy inflicting harm on the family whose house it is haunting. Matt calls the spirit out saying it can't handle a real man and at first it seems to have no reaction but the spirit hitches a ride with Matt to his home where it targets Matt and his girlfriend Jamie. The rest of the film is Matt coming to terms with what he has done and how can he protect himself, Jamie, and the rest of the ghost hunters. The film is what I call a slow burn that builds to the final confrontation between Matt and the spirit. Well paced and very well acted with a nice cameo appearance by Tony Moran (the unmasked Michael Myers  in the first Halloween). The film stars Christopher P. O'Reilly (credited as Chris O'Reilly) as Matt, Nicole Lasala as Jamie, Dan Liebman as Paul, Jamie Tennille as Kristina, and Sean Carmichael as Taylor. The cast did a superb job as did Jordan with his writing and directing. For fans of ghost stories you won't be disappointed and for fans of good scary horror yarns you will also enjoy yourself.",1432339200,3,1734,4.449685534591195
7068020,5,B00URPKT7M,"sexy women and the supernatural are key elements in this film which explores interpersonal relationships among a co-ed squad of ghost hunters. This is not a by the numbers B movie, rather it is an ambitious independent movie that flexes it's strengths (Acting, Casting, Directing, Mood) and overcomes the obvious challenges that come with making a movie on a DIY budget.  What results is a film that will leave you wanting more, as this ""feels"" like a prelude to bigger and better things for the team - Writer , Director , Actors - involved. Perhaps a sequel which will further resonate with the intended audience or perhaps a departure for the filmmakers into another genre (comedy?) In any event, look for the gorgeous girl next door type Kati Salowsky (photo) to catapult into fame (girl next door if you live in Heaven that is) , she is just too gorgeous too miss and has too much of the ""It Factor"" to be denied. A great comedic turn by Tony Moran is the cherry on the sundae of this winning dessert of a film. Very much enjoyable!",1432252800,,1036,4.56989247311828

7068085,2,B00URPKT7M,"The film opens with 5 college kids renting rooms in a house in Fall River, Mass. (Don't get ahead of me.)  Taryn (Ashley Green Elizabeth) is the main character. Included in the group is her brother Michael (Luke Brandon Field) and his self centered girlfriend Nikki (Nikole Howell). Taryn's BFF Jenna (Jamie Sarchet) and her church friend Scott (Jakob Renken) who comes across as ""unnamed guy in landing party.""

The film moves into a birthday party for Nikki with 5 extra invites while weird stuff is already happening, like Nikki sleep walking with an axe in her hand.  At 40 minutes into the film, the plot is suddenly explained without any real clues about Taryn. The house is owned by Diana (Donna Spangler) who is described as ""cool and eccentric.""

The acting wasn't great, but I have seen worse. The sound track did nothing for the film, playing ominous music seemingly at random.  If you mention ""church"" you get a big knocking sound, apparently a denominational ghost.  You will see an axe, or a body being dragged, by no gore or horror.

Then all of a sudden when they all gave up because nothing was happing and they all went home, it became focused mainly on one of the characters for the rest of the film. His household (which consisted of he and his girlfriend) was where all the paranormal activity turned out to be. The acting and script writing were terrible, along with the special effects and all. Definitely a low budget flick,. good thing I didn't pay for this and watched it for free thru prime.

The audio was inconsistent, with the incidental sometimes competing with the dialog. Scripting and character development was a bit confusing.

Spoilers: In one case, a guy who just breaks up with his girlfriend and wants to try to work it out is compared to another jerk who wants to sleep with everyone. In another, a character who believes and has been researching, refuses to believe his girlfriend when she describes the same types of incidents at a recent investigation, that he hasn't shared with her, all for the climatic ending when the ghost tries to convince the girl to come back to lure the boyfriend out of his protected area.

8707934,1,B00URPKT7M,"I always like to watch movies like this  because they don't get enough credit.  I'm sure the director, at some point, was very proud to have directed this movie but I have to say that this move is... well.. it's terrible.  My 7 year old was laughing watching it with me and he said, ""Daddy, this is the worst movie I have seen in my life.""  I can't argue.  Sorry Tony.",1508025600,,368,4.126760563380282
