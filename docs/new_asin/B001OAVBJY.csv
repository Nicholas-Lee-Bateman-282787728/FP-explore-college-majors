8330038,3,B001OAVBJY,"Another bundle of movies that can only be described as a way to sell two adequate movies by slapping on one really good one. I believe this bundle set was on the Gold Box and the only reason I bought it was because I really wanted Superbad and the other movies were just good enough to warrant buying the bundle. I may have purchased Talladega Nights if it was really cheap, but Don't Mess With the Zohan is just kind of a dumb Adam Sandler movie that you watch once and get over it.",1256515200,,483,4.148936170212766
