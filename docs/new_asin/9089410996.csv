8216918,5,9089410996,"I live in Australia and have a 0 (open)zone DVD player so was able to view this DVD. I was very impressed with the quality of this DVD and have ordered 6, 7, & 8 series.
I watched the Onedin Line many years ago when it first aired on TV. It was my favorite show then and still is. I love the Spartacus theme music and find it quite amazing that Spartacus seems to suit the big tall ships breezing along on the sea, more so then its original setting. It's an amazing series years ahead of its time. One has a love hate relationship with James and as for Elizabeth she's my kind of gal. Just love the Onedin Line and highly recommend it.",1316217600,2,635,4.088
