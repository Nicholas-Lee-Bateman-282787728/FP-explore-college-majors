You will recognize him as a family member somewhere in your own family (but much nicer than in Thousand Acres!)

It is Winona Ryder that steals the show. Her future talent is all too evident here.",1369008000,2,237,4.619047619047619
7978827,5,B0000844J1,"Anyone who is of the opinion that Rob Lowe comes across as being 'dull' on screen, or perhaps 'just a pretty face', should take time out to watch 'Square Dance'. His 'Golden Globe nominated performance' was justly deserved for his portrayal of the 'mentally-impared man-child', Rory.
There are some films watched during your childhood or teenage years that have a profound effect on you and, for me, 'Square Dance' is one such film. It is nice to see it released on DVD format so promptly.
Lowe skilfully plays the role of Rory, eliciting what can only be described as an emotional reaction from myself and, I'm sure, many others who have watched this heart-warming drama. It is roles like this and his portrayal of deaf mute, Nick Andros, in Stephen King's 'The Stand' that substantiate Lowe's talent and versatility as an actor.
'Square Dance' also features Winona Ryder in her acclaimed screen debut as Gemma, a 13-year old girl tired of living in Texas with her quarrelsome grandfather (Jason Robards), and who decides to go live with her mother (Jane Alexander) in Fort Worth. Whilst there, Gemma falls in love with Rory. She also discovers some hidden truths about her mother and the father she has never met. Life in Fort Worth turns out to be not as exciting and uncomplicated as she had initially expected.
Critically acclaimed, 'Square Dance' is an emotional drama that will remain with you forever.
Music: Don Henley, Ricky Scaggs, George Strait and Trace Adkins.
Special Features: Widescreen presentation; Audio commentary by producer & director Daniel Petrie ('Cocoon: The Return' & 'A Raisin in the Sun'); Director's biography.",1081728000,19,1641,5.014652014652015
