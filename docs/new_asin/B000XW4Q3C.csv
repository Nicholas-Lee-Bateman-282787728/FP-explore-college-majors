8230049,5,B000XW4Q3C,"I saw this film in a Documentary film class, and it blew me away. Most descriptions say this film is a documentary about the difference in railroad gauges between Russia and Europe. That's simply a metaphor for the much wider difference between the gritty Belorussian workers in the railroad yard in Brest, and the rather posh passenger on the train they service. There is a huge gap between the two classes, in a supposedly classless society, and it is only bridged, for a few moments, by a small child. But the moment passes, and everyone goes back to their roles.

Justly deserving of its Academy Award nomination.",1378252800,,617,4.766355140186916
