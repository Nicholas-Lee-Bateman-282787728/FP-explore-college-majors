5186404,5,B008VVYB9Q,Great workout that really reshapes the lower body to sculpt and tone! Fantastic instructor. Very motivating.,1406073600,4,108,5.8125

5186406,1,B008VVYB9Q,"I had bought the Firm Volume 1 with Susan Harris and loved it,so I ordered this soon after and quickly sold it. It was not only so dull,but I just did not like the trainer and it was nowhere near as good as Volume 1. Volume 1 has an amazing Mat segment,which totally makes this dvd seem pointless. Save your money-it does not offer anything new. Buy Volume 1,which is so much fun,as well as a challenging,well rounded workout.",1393200000,5,426,4.405063291139241
8531275,5,B008VVYB9Q,I go to the YMCA four times per week but this video has wonderful exercises that I don't get there.  I have osteoporosis and am trying to improve  my bone density without drugs.  The YMCA exercises helped my spine density but not the femoral neck.  This video has exercises that the internet says you need for building the femoral neck.  That's the little bone that breaks when you break your hip.  Next bone density I'll see if it worked.  (I am 67.),1522454400,,451,4.426829268292683

8531278,5,B008VVYB9Q,I have always loved The Firm exercise videos and all of the ones from this particular series are the best.  You will definitely see results and there is no jumping around like a maniac.,1499731200,,185,4.4411764705882355
8531279,4,B008VVYB9Q,"Decent workout, although the instructor is not one of their absolute best, but she is OK. Get a handful of Firm videos and give yourself a few weeks to break into it. Once you are comfortable with the basics of lifting weights, you can make up your own workouts at home and play loud rock and roll while you're doing it! It gives a real endorphin rush and is addicting in a positive manner.

The Firm teaches a balanced and accessible approach to fitness and the early videos like this one were the best. Later, they started with a bunch of cheesy gimmicks. Fitness at home doesn't have to cost much, nor is it rocket science, but you do have to be disciplined enough to do it at least 4 or 5 days a week. The Firm provides the motivation.",1496016000,,739,4.2785714285714285
8531280,3,B008VVYB9Q,"This workout had potential, but if I didn't have aerobic dance experience I wouldn't even give this workout a second chance.  The cueing is very poor.  Overall, difficult to know what to do with such poor cueing.",1470009600,,212,4.702702702702703
8531281,3,B008VVYB9Q,"I've discovered that some of my favorite Firm tapes that I've finally replaced on DVD have not been transfered to digitall correctly. Some even have the end of the workout missing from the disc all together. Not reassuring as I would like to replace them all. That being said, this is a great, all encompassing workout and yes, I can finally quickly fast forward to customize the workout for that day, which is not true of all the tapes transferred to disc.",1468800000,,457,4.585365853658536
8531282,5,B008VVYB9Q,"Hasn't arrived yet but, had this on vhs along time ago. Loved it then , had to order again.",1456704000,,91,3.8421052631578947
8531283,5,B008VVYB9Q,This is a great workout.  I had this years ago on vhs but it's a bit harder then I remembered.  Great lower body and core workout.  Highly recommend.,1452297600,3,149,4.25
8531284,5,B008VVYB9Q,"If you want results, use the Firm DVD and watch your hips and thighs develop muscles and shape.  Your abs will be firmer and your core will be strengthened.",1448841600,3,156,4.379310344827586
