8753940,5,B01CRG40LO,Great nostalgic events shown! Luv it all!......ELI.,1498608000,,51,6.428571428571429
8753941,2,B01CRG40LO,"I had high hopes for this given the people involved but it was just okay and had irritating music throughout, even drowinging out some of the interviewees. Just a baffling example of poor production.",1496620800,2,199,4.882352941176471
8753942,4,B01CRG40LO,"I enjoyed this much more than I was expecting to.  The documentary portion was very educational, at least for us not around in the early days of films like this.  The extra clips (hours worth) were fun to watch and see how sexploitation films have changed/evolved over the years.",1485216000,,279,4.673469387755102

8753944,2,B01CRG40LO,"After docu's like Machete Maidens Unleashed this is such a big let down.  Being SWV and having MANY of their DVD's - I expected a cornucopia of clips and film samples with commentary and historical development dialogue.  What I got, might make a good film for film schools to show as education filler on schlock films - but not much for the home collector.  In a nutshell - bunch of retired film folks having a reminisce-day with little of the bally-who that those of us who love SWV have come to expect and rely on getting.",1468108800,3,524,4.4375
8753945,5,B01CRG40LO,"Covers exploitation completely, but not of course the mostly-female actors.  Dead but not forgotten, should be the tag line.  Includes some actual complete porn-ish stuff.  NOT for kids.  Some included footage is really disgusting and stomach-turning, especially when real STDs are shown in wartime warning films using close-ups of sick genitals.  I would NOT have called those WWII films exploitation but purposely frightening reality.  Soldiers in wartime probably threw up.  They just wanted to watch that redheaded bombshell featured on the Blu-ray cover picture.  Shut your eyes during the WWII health parts that deserve just one star or less!  Five stars for historical preservation of you-won't-believe-what-grandpa-watched junk.  Laughable but often sad.  Anything hidden becomes exciting?  Granny was an actress in those?  Yoicks!",1465862400,4,839,5.778688524590164
8753946,4,B01CRG40LO,Pretty tame for the most part ... Liked the nudest colony clips which were wholesome while stimulating and some others,1464739200,2,118,4.95
8753947,1,B01CRG40LO,"Christ!  What a disappointment!  Any fan/collector of SWV has seen these clips eight million times!  The big interview is with the late blowhard Drew Friedman, who rehashes the same stories he's told for decades!  This is a very lazy documentary and should have been much better!  I would have loved to have heard from the dozens of knowledgeable exploitation/sexploitation writers and experts that cover this subject on a daily basis.  Very upset I pre-ordered this Blu-ray!",1462320000,10,475,5.184210526315789
8753948,5,B01CRG40LO,"This is a great documentary and a lot of fun. Did not want to see it end. Would like to see some of these films in this documentary released on blu-ray. Great job to the folks at Something Weird Video and Severin Films! If you enjoy this kind of thing, you will love it! Highly recommended!",1461801600,6,290,4.196428571428571
