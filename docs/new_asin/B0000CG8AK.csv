7999254,4,B0000CG8AK,"This is a really fun and well made anime series (pre-digital) that focuses on the next generation of Grand Prix racers...ones with their own internal computer system that interacts with the driver, a 'cyber formula"" racer, all with new engines that no longer burn fossil fuel.  The machines are faster, smarter, and way cooler, so it takes quite a personality to master one.  Much of this series' appeal is character interaction, but the race scenes are light years ahead of the old Speed Racer show we all know and love.  It's a show for kids who really, really into cars (and don't mind subtitles)...and their dads.",1423872000,,617,4.80188679245283
7999255,1,B0000CG8AK,"I gave this item a low rating because the DVD set I received wasn't what was described on Amazon. Keep in mind, the real complete set has 8 discs and contains 37 episodes. It retails for around $100. If you are looking to save some money and purchased a USED set from an independent store/seller be aware that the 3 or 4 disc sets DO NOT contain all the episodes. Even though the box art was identical to what Amazon showed, my set only contained 19 episodes.

So if you are looking to pick this item up be certain you are getting the 8 disc set!",1327881600,3,546,4.150943396226415
7999256,4,B0000CG8AK,this was one of the anime that i watched as a little kid. its very good. it also has very good subtitles. i would recommend this to anyone,1222560000,,138,3.9642857142857144
7999257,5,B0000CG8AK,"Alright just to let you know this is my first review, so saying that i'll do my best to be honest and accurate. First off in reality i'd give this show a 4.5 rather than full 5 for me. The only reason is that Bandai never gave this show an English Dub.
  That is not a bad thing of course because i switch off between dub and sub here and there anyway but for those who have to do other things like i do focusing on subtitles on a show that long is not always possible.
  Besides that one flaw the series is actually pretty good. I won't give away any major spoilers but there is a predictable arc and a scenario similiar to Speed Racer but at the same time i din't mind that.
  The show to me could stand on its own. It had some great character devolopment (from the car to the main characters arch rivals), great race scenes that took place all over the world (racing along the African savahna to over Mount Kilamanjaro for one) at ridiculous speeds, and cars that could give the Mach Five and Nightrider's Kitt a run for there money.
All in all it was a good show for the price I paid.",1216252800,,1088,4.1084905660377355
7999258,5,B0000CG8AK,I don't remember when I first saw this cartoon.  It's been more than 10 year by now (at least)!  But the characters are unforgettable and the excitement in the plot has never let me down.  Definitely one of the best I have ever seen.  Love it!,1139702400,4,243,4.217391304347826
