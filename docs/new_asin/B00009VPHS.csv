7993177,5,B00009VPHS,"This label-unknown edition of CARTOON CLASSICS #7 was originally a 1987 VIDEO YESTERYEAR tape. Despite being dubbed at a slow playback speed, that tape has a clear picture and strong audio, and over 20 years later mine still tracks flawlessly. (I just watched CC#7 again for the first time in 15 years and was amazed at how well-preserved and functioning this antique is.)

The above out-of-sync ""product description"" and ""about the artist"" blurbs are the precise text of a bleached-white cardboard insert that comes with my generic yellow box tape. Best guess is that the product description's 2002 ""release"" date is actually the year this item was listed here, and ""Cartoon Classics #7"" is in fact the original 1987 Video Images VHS. If it is, you'll be pleased with its quality.

As to content:
Rita Rio supplies original Hammond organ music. According to pre-program info, the five animated shorts were processed with some sort of prismatic device that renders them flickerless even though they run at their original projection speeds, which were well under the 24 fps standard that was adopted with the advent of ""talkies"" in the late 1920s. The results (especially on that 1914 Winsor McKay blend of live action and animation) are silent movies that DO NOT appear to race at breakneck speed. They look here as they once did to audiences of 80 or 90 years ago-- naturalistic and unhurried.

""Early Animation"" is a delighful hour that's sure to please all fans of vintage cinema and cartoons. Hghest recommendation!",1253577600,,1519,4.996047430830039
