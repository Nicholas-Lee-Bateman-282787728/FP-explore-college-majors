841965,2,630434063X,"A gutsy Connery confronts corporate greed on a Jovian moon mining colony.
Not one of Sean Connery's most successful films, it is a must-have for sci-fi buffs. Unfortunately, the widescreen transfer is sub-par. Thin horizontal lines, horizontal edges of objects, and stars wink in and out of existence when they pass across horizontal scan lines and due to film jitter. Although noticeable at first, this defect becomes less noticeable as one watches the video.
Until a better transfer is available, it is still a ""keeper"". This 3-star film gets two stars due to the transfer problem.",980467200,3,583,5.083333333333333
841966,4,630434063X,"This action film is enhanced by Sean Connery, luckily, because the theme is rather trite. A rotten manager in a mine on Io organizes a better output with drugs and killers. Then he sprinkles everyone with his money and thus they are all either rotten controlers or rotten submissive slaves. The Marshall will of course succeed, we know that from the very start, but he only destroys a ring of pretty nasty and in no way respectable scavengers. So, the merit is light, especially since the professional killers that come to clean up the marshall are nor exactly very professional and get trapped more than very easily.",976579200,,617,4.775700934579439
841967,4,630434063X,"I like this film because it shows another side to a futurecop movie that moves realisticly. If you enjoyed blade runner, it's possible you'd might like Outland, that is only if you enjoy watching Sean Connery in action. I was fascinated with this movie when I was kid, because I had never seen sean connery in a science fiction film before, so it was something new to me. I like the idea of him being secluded from all the rest, and he is the only one being hunted. It's a good movie some favorite parts, are the meatlocker scene(hows that for a blow?) the ""green house effect"" (LOL) and the ending is awesome.",975974400,,610,4.407079646017699
841968,4,630434063X,"Thanks to ""Star Wars"", the majority of sci-fi movies in the last twenty-plus years has been annoyingly meshed with the action genre.
In many cases (such as the aforementioned ""Star Wars""), this adds to  the fun. Unfortunately, it also makes more dramatic/intellegent fare  (""2001"", ""Silent Running""), seem boring by  comparison.
""Outland"" has suffered this kind of criticism,  although there are action elements. I think this is unfair.  ""Outland"" is a gritty, dark picture, more focused on characters  and their situations than phaser blasts and starship attacks.
The film  has more in common with ""Alien"" than ""Star Wars"". There  is genuine tension generated in several situations, darkness, and the sense  that a deadly attack can come out of nowhere.
The feeling of isolation  on the Io moonbase is very well done, and several segments foreshadow  Hyams' work on ""2010"". The style of the sets fit with the feel of  the Io base (lots of metalwork, cargo containers, grills, bland flourecent  lights, heavy pressure doors, etc.).
True, some items are rather dated,  such as the computer readouts, the security cameras, present day cargo  containers, and shotguns on a futuristic space outpost. But I find the mark  of a quality film is the ability to look past those elements to see and  appreciate the picture anyway.
There also are some glaring errors, such  as bodies exploding when exposed to space (they don't), but again, I think  this is minor and in step with popular thinking in 1981, the year  ""Outland"" was made.
""Outland"" is really a character  study dressed up as sci-fi, much like ""High Noon"" was a character  study dressed up as a western. The trappings matter less than the acting,  writing, and characters.
Say what you will, but ""Outland""  delivers.",956448000,2,1769,5.041522491349481
841969,4,630434063X,"Not that often you see 007 running rampant with a shotgun on IO.  I can't say about the VHS version of the movie, another fellow critic has said the VHS version is better video-wise.  But I personally like the DVD transfer,  though it is subject to some shimmers especially when the scene is  comprised of various light/dark elements. If you're on-the-fence about  investing in the DVD version, mine came with both Widescreen and Normal and  looks clean.",947548800,3,454,4.8311688311688314
841970,3,630434063X,"Outland is a solid, if not outstanding, sci-fi film.  Sean Connery is always great, it was nice to see some earlier work from Peter ""2010"" Hyams, and it's a good retelling of High Noon.  But it has  some unintentional laughs, because I can't think of that woman as anything  other than ""Cliff's mum"" (from Cheers).
However, word has it  that the DVD version is damn near unwatchable, due to poor quality.  Be  warned.",940291200,6,417,4.63013698630137

Nothing against the story, or the acting, or  special effects, but this movie took no advantage of the format at all.  I  dare you to lock your eyes at a fixed point on the screen.  The picture  wiggles all over the place making the viewer uneasy and agitated.  Not to  mention dark and grainy sceans.  It's too bad, but don't waste your time.",917481600,7,520,3.9611650485436893

842115,5,630434063X,"Even before the first BLADE RUNNER movie was released and legitimized the dystopian-future ""grunge"" look, you can see it well at work here in this adaptation of the HIGH NOON story.  Sean Connery, looking beyond hunky in lawman's uniform and tight beard, is put on Io (moon of Jupiter) to maintain peace, which he does rather too well.  Just as in the Gary Cooper movie, bad guys are coming in on the next train (okay, shuttle).  Peter Boyle as the smirking corporate suck-up and Frances Sternhagen as the wisecracking company doctor add zest to what is basically Connery's feature.

Connery, Sternhagen are excellent; Boyle as the head villain does well but should have been on screen a bit more. The sets and effects are first class along with Jerry Goldsmith's score.",1501977600,,531,4.541666666666667

842315,5,630434063X,"This is a review for a DVD copy of ""Outland"" with Sean Connery sold by scannerama18.

I like this movie because it is not the run-of-the-mill sci-fi aliens vs. humans in space movie.  It's a good cop movie about humans and their problems (specifically drug addiction and corruption) in space.  Sean Connery plays a no-nonsense cop that goes up against the druggies, drug-runners and corrupt cops/administrators in a mining space station on Io, one of Jupiters moons.  There's that famous scene of a prisoner murdered in a zero-gravity cell.  Because it's space, all these people find that their options are limited.  If you like cop movies, this is a good one for your collection.

The DVD I got was a brand-new Warner Home Video release from November 2007.  This one was closed-captioned (not subtitled for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing for those interested since the formatting for both are different).  The closed-captioning works great; my copy did not have any glitches.  The vendor I ordered this from was scannerama18.  Highly recommend this vendor.  Will answer questions like they answered mine about the closed-captioning.  Shipped out quickly and arrived equally as quickly in a padded envelope.

I watched the DVD two or three nights later to check for quality.  Its perfect.

Five stars for both product and vendor.",1488326400,3,1327,5.074074074074074
842316,5,630434063X,Old school western in space. Loved this movie. It is like High Noon or Shane or any of those old westerns where the former gunslinger sheriff has to stand alone against the cattle-baron's (in this case drug dealers) hired gunfighters coming to town...but in space. I can't add anything that other positive viewers haven't already said about this film. I just want to add my voice to theirs.

This movie has always been underated because Hollyweird insists on adding a lot of campy crap to titillate moviegoers whereas the focus here is the story and the drama of it. It fits the late Robert Heinlein's definition of a story in other settings where the technology is taken for granted and forms a backdrop to the story. So, the emphasis is the story, not the special effects which serve to present the story. Like the film (the original) Rollerball the technology exhibited, in some ways, seems dated because of technology we now take for granted.

842881,3,630434063X,"Wow, an 80s movie preaching the dangers of drugs?  Say it isn't so!

Right from the start, the movie has some glaring technical issues.  The intro statements include two misspellings--actually it uses the wrong words: saying what the facility mostly mines, it uses ""principle"" (as in ethics) when it should say ""principal"" (meaning primary), and Connery is said to be a ""marshall"" (Marshall is a name; marshal is the law enforcement officer).  (His title is spelled right later on in the movie though.)  But worse, the movie goes out of its way to show people explode when they're exposed to vacuum.  One even explodes in a flash of light!  A human being exposed to vacuum won't explode--our skin really is good at holding itself together (you'd die in space, sure enough, but you wouldn't explode).  Given this and the spelling goofiness, I have to wonder who was doing the research and fact-checking for this film.

I also have misgivings about the movie's end.  He takes out the assassins sent against him, sucker-punches the manager who sent them, and then emails his wife that he'll be joining them in time for their flight to Earth?  Just like that?  That's ""Starship Troopers"" (the book, not the movie) levels of patness.

That said, there are some fun things to like about the movie.  It's a pretty good thriller, and leads you from one thing to the next, and it's very satisfying to watch without being entirely an action movie.  I was also very fond of the doctor's part in this.  Once past the initial gruffness, she was a great character--no-nonsense and very down to earth.  And she and Connery formed a ""having a few drinks together"" friendship--two professionals with something in common who respect one another and enjoy each other's company.  Usually in movies like this, the female lead is there just to be a love interest for the male lead, but that wasn't where this movie was going, and that was a refreshing change.

Overall, a good beer-and-pretzels movie; you just have to ignore the technical issues at the beginning.",1450051200,,2042,4.816091954022989

843043,5,630434063X,"Outland really flies under the radar when you mention Sean Connery's movie career. I believe this is one of his best films.  Every time I watch it the movie seems to get better and better.  I will take these old action movies with great stories and character development over new slick CGI films with no substance any day.

Connery owns this role as Marshal O Neil who comes across as an honest cop just trying to do his job amid a space mining facility overrun by psychotic workers on illegal drugs supplied by the stations lead foreman. The entire cast is fantastic down the line.  Frances Sternhagen should have won an Oscar for her supporting role as the stations doctor who can't figure out what is making the workers go nuts.  Her interactions with Connery really help carry the movie.  Peter Boyle who is more known for his comedic work in (Young Frankenstein and Everybody Loves Raymond TV show)plays a really despicable villain.  I really admired his acting ability even more after watching this film.  Peter comes across as ruthless and thinks O Neil is just some cowboy he can dispose of.  Other reviewers have summarized the film better than I can.  I was just glad to see all the positive reviews for the film.

The movie was riding the wave of SCI FI movies coming off the success of ""Star Wars"" at the time but that did not hurt the film in the least.  I loved the cinematography of the background of the planet.  This film kind of reminds me of ""Blade Runner"" of what the replicants would have been doing off world that you never get to see. The director really did a great job building the tension and letting the story unfold naturally.  I think this kind of film should be used for college courses on how to make a suspenseful movie.

It may be a simple SCI FI Western but it is really well done.  The people on the station all seem real have families and lives just like normal people.  You never get the impression that this could never happen in real life.  Quiet the contrary I easily believe this could happen if we had the technology to reach Jupiter and colonize other planets.  ""Alien"" also used the theme of a crooked corporation with its workers expendable but this film went in a new direction with it they both share the feeling of claustrophobic sets but hey nothings perfect.  I would highly recommend this movie for people who enjoy crime dramas, thrillers or action movie fans.  The film does take its time do not expect explosions every few seconds.  I thought it was a very good film.  The music and score also help and is well done.",1437523200,,2570,4.515151515151516
843044,4,630434063X,"THE STORY: In the future, (on the distant Saturn moon of Io), a mining colony responsible for the extraction of precious titanium ore begins experiencing an alarming rise in the death rate of its crew. An illegal performance-enhancing drug is being circulated among the workers. The extra energy & pain-killing effects equal big bucks for company boss (Peter Boyle), a total schnook who cares only about his increased profit margin. New sheriff in town Sean (James Bond) Connery starts poking around and soon finds himself in way over his head. He ends up doing a ""High Noon"" out in deep space, when everyone who can help is either on the take or looks the other way, leaving Connery to wage a one-man war against the corrupt creeps and their slimy corporate henchmen.

THOUGHTS: This unusual yet oddly routine crime thriller could have just as easily been set in a gold or diamond mine on Earth. There are a couple of slick kill scenes using decompression & weightlessness, but other than for the novelty factor (and sci-fi being a hot box office ticket at that time), I cannot see the reason for this taking place in space. Still, any chance to see ex-Bond Connery kicking arse is always a welcome one. Other actors are uniformly good across the board, the action sequences are well done and the special effects, though sadly dated now in the era of CGI, are still fun to look at. Peter Hyams, who directed CAPRICORN ONE and 2010, (along with the excellent 1997 monster amok thriller, THE RELIC), here returns to familiar extraterrestrial territory, but basically just goes through the motions and coughs up a by-the-numbers crime flick, thinly disguised by rockets & space suit trappings. A fun diversion and an acceptable time-waster, but that's really about it.

THE BLU-RAY: This high-def release from Warner looks & sounds very good, but is nothing to dazzle your senses. Picture is solid and clear, with only minimal artifacting & pixelation. Although no restoration or remastering appear to have been done, the dirt & grit present in the film source looks minimal. Dark scenes are mostly noise free and the midtones are even. Soundmix is strong & consistent. The disc includes the theatrical trailer and a full-length Director's Commentary audio track from Hyams. If you're a fan of Connery then you'll doubtless enjoy his odd turn here as a no-nonsense space sheriff. Others may want to just rent this one first before deciding to buy it.

an excellent sci-fi thriller set in space on a place called Jupiter moon- a mining colony
Sean connery plays his role brilliantly as the head Marshal trying to stop a Drug trafficking operation on Jupiter moon
and Peter Boyle plays His boss trying to fight him off
Brilliantly written script by Peter Hyams and of course brilliant Directing aswell, lots of suspense & action

the old dvd release had no special features of course, just the Theatrical trailer

well this time Warner bros has released the film on blu-ray with a new High Definition transfer in 2:40:1 widescreen
and i tell you the picture quality does look excellent, nice sharp & clear picture better than the old dvd version anyday
plus a new 5.1 Master audio mix which does sound alot better than the old Dolby digital mix
regarding the special features
besides the usual Theatrical trailer
a new Audio commentary has been recorded by Peter Hyams
as a fan of the film i was hopeing for a new retrospective featurette with Peter Hyams & sean connery at least
but you only get a new recorded Audio commentary just for this blu-ray
so think yourself lucky, sometimes WB does not bother getting new blu-ray extras for old classics like this film
they just release barebones blu-ray's as usual.
the commentary is worth listening to
Peter talks about the film, talks about writing the script, talks about getting sean connery, talk about the scenes
and other things related to the film
so the commentary is not to Dull, some of it is worth listening to

so definitely time to upgrade get this new Blu-ray version which has new Audio commentary by Peter Hyams
4 stars for the film itself, only 2-3 stars for this new blu-ray
if new extras were produced like a new making of featurette etc i would give the blu-ray 5 stars",1432771200,,1816,4.66875

High Noon with a sci-fi setting on Io has a simple story with good guys and bad guys heading for the final showdown everyone knows is coming with some twists and surprises along the way. Sir Sean Connery in his younger prime is the perfect lawman who is there to make sure the bad guys do not succeed in winning the day and making crime pay - at his expense.

If you want wall-to-wall sci fi shoot 'em up action with mind-boggling effects that blow you away, this one is not for you. Though not without good action and good effects that still hold up, the pace of Outland is deliberately slower and building, during which we learn about the personal and professional pressures the marshal and his family face, and gain appreciation for the dynamics of being stuck in an industrial mining operation on Io with some bad things going on and uncertainty about who your friends and enemies might be when the bad guys are coming to ""fix"" things. The dangerous, monotonous, and bleak environment with horrible and certain death in space just beyond each wall in every scene creates a claustrophobic and unsettling backdrop to the whole thing.

It is clear that they spared no expense in both set design or special effects, and the clarity of the Blu-ray version makes this perfectly clear. And of course, the story is just as good, even though the technology is pure early Eighties. It's not the tech, it's the tale- High Noon in space.

If you were despairing of ever seeing a good version of this movie again, get the Blu-ray, and watch it on an HD set. It'll be like seeing it in the theater again.",1429833600,,1133,4.314553990610329

Most people think of ""Outland"" as a western set in outerspace, and listening to the worthwhile director's commentary proves them correct. That may be one reason it holds up so well for a movie from 1981. These are flawed characters who when faced with the harsh realities of frontier life have to find out who they really are.  Connery may be the star, but there is a good supporting cast, especially Peter Boyle (Everybody Loves Raymond) as the corrupt head of a moon mining operation.

Much of the set is reminiscent of the original ""Alien"" movie, and while the special effects from then won't wow anyone there are only a couple times when their age is a little distracting. The ""space saloon"" features some hi-tech laser dancing I could have lived without. The rest of the film, which is ultimately a character driven movie about people, more than makes up for it.

Aside from a somewhat cheesy ending at the VERY end (the climax is great, we're only talking literally about the final minute here) this is almost a perfect movie. 4 1/2 stars.",1421625600,7,1319,4.595744680851064

The cat and mouse sequence where Connery fights for survival in the skeleton of the space colony is gripping and equal to any James Bond movie. This is also the sort of macho, morally upright and determined role that suits Sean Connery down to the tips of his space suit. The other characters such as they are, all very well acted and believable. Also the plot and story is totally credible.

My only caveat is the quality of the picture and compared with other movie offerings on DVD there seems to have been little attempt to source this from the original HD masters.

It was good to see him take down the corrupt governing entity that thought they could continue to use and abuse the workers and fatten themselves by corruption and abuse of power. This movie has become a real metaphor for today. Sean Connery is a whistle blower and the scum in charge of the mining station is either eric holder or an IRS  thug trying to prevent him from stopping the government corruption, at any cost.

Now to the film: Sean Connery and Peter Boyle star in this film which happens to be located on Io, a volcanically active moon of Jupiter. This is the moon whose huge volcanic plumes thrilled Voyager scientists.
In the film, a mining company has hollowed out an excavation beneath the Io surface for purposes of extracting valuable metals.  The problem comes when a series of accidents and incidents start to occur.  This, it turns out, is caused by a performance drug that the company gives to workers to raise productivity.  The company doctor, along with Sean Connery(as policeman/detective), discover this.  When Connery tries to trace its source and put a stop to it, he encounters resistance from the company hack(Peter Boyle, as mine superintendent).

I remember seeing this movie with great fondness and I still think it's one of the best Space Opera/ Sci-Fi Westerns which has ever been made. Until I received this DVD I had not seen the film in close to 15 years. This was the first time I'd seen the DVD and was very happy to add it to my collection.
The film follows the old Western formula of new sheriff in town dealing with an ingrained culture of lawlessness. In this case, the frontier town is a corporate mining operation on Jupiter's moon Io. Trouble begins not long before the new Federal Marshall arrives to take a one-year tour of duty. With him are his wife and son who are tired of bouncing around from one extraterrestrial colony to another. While the Marshall is learning the ropes, his wife decides to take their son back to Earth and hopes that the Marshall will join them. Meanwhile, the Marshall has become aware of traffic in a particularly nasty amphetamine which is causing insanity among the workers. He discovers that the dirt goes all the way to the top brass who were paying off previous Marshals to look the other way. His meddling eventually gets him targeted by two assassins and his only help comes from a middle-aged doctor who is as outraged as he at this criminal behavior. For the rest, you'll just have to watch for yourself.
Sean Connery, as always, delivers a fantastic performance. The rest of the cast is good as well. The special effects, though a bit dated, are still fantastic (remember that this was long before CGI came along). This is a classic sci-fi picture and it deserves to be remembered well.
Sadly, the execution of this DVD edition is a bit lackluster. It has not been digitally restored and in fact looks essentially as if it was copied directly from an old VHS tape. Personally, I'm just glad to have a copy of this film to watch. However, if you're a stickler for clear picture and updating and looking for really cool special features, sadly you're out of luck.

843585,5,630434063X,"OUTLAND [1981] [Blu-ray] This Science-Fiction Delivers The Goods! On Jupiters Moon Hes The Only Law!

Set on Jupiter's moon Io, Jupiters innermost moon, hosts a mining colony CON-AM 27, a high-tech hellhole. There a veteran marshal [Sean Connery] probes some mysterious deaths of miners. In pursuit of the truth, he is alone. OUTLAND is a 1981 British science fiction thriller film written and directed by Peter Hyams Timecop and 2010 depicts a chilling extension of todays corporation-driven world. Dehumanization is vividly evoked in Philips Harrisons striking production design and two-time Academy Award winner John Stears special effects.

FILM FACT: OUTLAND was the first motion picture to use Introvision, a variation on front projection that allows foreground, mid-ground and background elements to be combined in-camera, as opposed to using optical processes such as blue screen matting. This enabled characters to convincingly walk around miniature sets of the mining colony. Director Peter Hyams hired cinematographer Stephen Goldblatt. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound for John Wilkinson, Robert W. Glass, Jr., Robert Thirlwell and Robin Gregory. OUTLAND was filmed at Pinewood Studios, Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, UK, with an estimated budget of $16,000,000.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: 'OUTLAND' wasn't the first film to shift elements of the western to a sci-fi environment, and it certainly won't be the last, but it's still a relatively unique combination, one that makes for a wonderfully entertaining motion picture that might otherwise be thought of as a generic crime thriller. In fact, it could be argued that the marriage of the two genres essentially masks a rather simple plot that could just as easily take place on modern-day Earth. But the subtlety and restraint shown by British writer/director Peter Hyams when merging the two vastly different styles manages to elevate the story into something fresh and terrifically engaging. Aspects of either genre serve only as backdrop or narrative device for telling this crime drama that serves as a clever indictment of corporate conspiracy and greed which devalues the lives of the working class.

Set on Jupiter's moon Io, Jupiters innermost moon, set in the far distant future, the merger of the two genres is immediately apparent but never brought to the forefront. Instead, it's an understated framework inside a remote mining outpost functioning on Io, one of Jupiter's many moons, and order is kept by a small band of peacekeepers, led by Federal Marshal O'Niel [Sean Connery]. It's one of the reasons I find the film so brilliant and still highly enjoyable. Peter Hyams isn't constantly reminding his audience of what he's doing beyond the initial opening with the explanatory title cards. Yet, there's a rustic Wild West appeal to the overall film, thanks in part to the stage design and the cinematography of Stephen Goldblatt.

Story-wise, Peter Hyams doesn't shy away from stock characterization, such as Connery epitomizing the rugged town sheriff. As the bringer of justice and social order to the seemingly chaotic frontier of space, Sean Connery's Federal Marshal O'Niel stumbles upon a conspiracy to hide several unsolved deaths of miners. There isn't a whole lot for the Scottish actor to do other than act the determined and deeply committed lawman, but what he does he does exceptionally well, being a hard-nosed peacekeeper that won't back down in a fight. Peter Hyams does give the character a bit of depth as a married family man on the brink of losing what he cherishes the most because he believes so strongly that what he's doing is the right thing to do. And as with everything else, Sean Connery shines in these moments, carrying the thought of his wife and son heading back to Earth without him in his eyes and powering his will to fight.

Helping the Federal Marshal discover a secret drug-ring operating within the colony is the feisty, contentious town doctor, played delightfully by Frances Sternhagen. She's perfect as the spirited foil, almost comic-relief, to Sean Connery's stern temperament, coming to his cause at just the right moment when the man needs the assistance the most. Her involvement in the cover-up is somewhat of a mystery because she doesn't perform autopsies of the dead, though it does become fairly clear when the sergeant [James Sikking], replacing the customary trusty deputy, turns out to be paid a hefty sum to look the other way. While two dealers appear to do most of the footwork, the man at the centre of it all is none other than [Peter Boyle] the head-honcho and ruthless greedy landholder of the mining.

Peter Hyams makes that little piece of information pretty obvious early on. Discovering who's behind this large-scale crime is not really the point. In fact, it's used within the narrative as a means of generating tension and suspense because we know who the cause of the rampant drug use is, hiding the deaths of innocent workers in order to keep profits rising. As Federal Marshal O'Niel follows the clues and gathers the evidence to prove his suspicion, those involved will do anything to defend the flow of money, driving the plot toward a spectacular 'High Noon' showdown. Filled with a cold mechanical atmosphere and the ethereal music of by award winning Jerry Goldsmith, Peter Hyams's 'OUTLAND' is wildly entertaining sci-fi western warning of a corporate future where our greatest enemy remains the monetary greed plaguing our society?

One very interesting fact I have found out, is a comment by Peter Hyams and reads like so:

I wanted to do a Western. Everybody said, 'You cant do a Western; Westerns are dead; nobody will do a Western'. I remember thinking it was weird that this genre that had endured for so long was just gone. But then I woke up and came to the conclusion and obviously after other people and that it was actually alive and well, but in outer space. I wanted to make a film about the frontier. Not the wonder of it or the glamour of it: I wanted to do something about Dodge City and how hard life was. I wrote it, and by great fortune Sean Connery wanted to do it. And how many chances do you get to work with Sean Connery?

Blu-ray Video Quality  The print used for this 1080p encoded image appears to be in pretty good shape, because 'OUTLAND' looks great on Blu-ray. It doesn't quite match the best we've seen from other films of the same period, but this high-definition gives a gritty realism transfer is a vast improvement nonetheless over the terrible and inferior NTSC DVD release. Presented in an aspect ratio 2.40:1 frame, which is closer to its original aspect ratio and much preferred to previous letterboxed releases, it comes with the expected blurry sequences due to age, but the image is surprisingly sharp and distinct for the most part. Viewers can make out every wrinkle on Mr. Connery's face, and the smallest details of the mining outpost are plainly visible. Contrast is comfortably bright with clean, crisp whites, giving the picture a renewed, cinematic appeal. Colours are not particularly upbeat, which is deliberate to the cinematography, but they accurately rendered and consistent from beginning to end. The more problematic issues come from the wavering black levels, looking deep and intense one minute and murky the next. Exterior shots are excellent with rich contrast between light and dark, but several interior scenes can appear washed out, ruining some of the finer details in the shadows and making the natural film grain seem a bit noisy. It's not to the film's detriment, however, as the overall presentation looks great on high-definition video, a significant upgrade from the previous inferior and ghastly inferior NTSC DVD release.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The sound design for 'OUTLAND' was a bit of a pioneer, with a soundtrack that is essentially an early form of today's 5.1 surround system. Without any way of actually confirming this DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack derives from the original 70mm 6-track magnetic print on which it was recorded, this Blu-ray presentation appears to be faithful to the intentions of filmmakers. The design doesn't do much with the available back speakers, but Peter Hyams' sci-fi Western makes excellent use of the stereo sound field, which I'm assuming was always the intention of the new technology. Channel separation is well-balanced with flawless movement that perfectly matches the action. Off-screen effects broaden the soundstage with imaging that's convincing, and the excellent directionality nicely generates a persuasive sense of space. The excellent and brilliant Jerry Goldsmith's ethereally jarring musical score takes greater advantage of the soundscape by bleeding into the rears and immersing the listener. Vocals are plainly audible and well-prioritized while dynamic range remains wide and cleanly rendered. One of the best features of this early surround mix is the boosted low-frequency effects, which come off surprisingly hearty and accurate with excellent response for a 30-year-old movie, making this generally-stereo track a great listen.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Peter Hyams: British  Writer/Director Peter Hyams revisits his cult sci-fi western and shares many informative anecdotes about the production. He spends a good chunk of his time talking about Sean Connery, the legendary actor's presence on set and getting to work with him as filming progressed. There are also several great comments on the story's themes, the photography, set design and the overall look he was aiming to achieve. All in all, Peter Hyams is able to offer a generally pleasing audio track, speaking with a great deal of pride over his work and the finished product.

Theatrical Trailer [2:54] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for OUTLAND, where they inform you that The ultimate enemy is still man.""

Finally, written and directed by Peter Hyams, 'OUTLAND' is a sci-fi western starring Sean Connery as a deeply committed lawman, the cult film remains a wildly entertaining flick with a spectacular 'High Noon' showdown. The Blu-ray arrives with a great audio and video presentation that greatly improves upon previous home video releases, but sadly, comes with only one exclusive supplement. Fans will surely want to pick this up just for the joy of seeing Sean Connery shoot bad guys with a shotgun...in space. For me, OUTLAND remains sadly a very underrated, underappreciated film and it is worth appreciating it now as it was then when it was originally released in 1981. Technically the disc is one of the better catalogue titles Warner has put out recently, and the commentary track does great justice for fans of this brilliant shoot-em up film regardless of their age. If you are new to this film and fans of science fiction, you owe it to yourself to take a look for yourself; as I firmly believe you will wind up enjoying it now and for many years down the road and that is why it has gone pride of place in my Blu-ray Collection, especially with the ever star presence of Sean Connery. Highly Recommended!

The commentary adds interesting facts on making the film as well as Mr. Hyams' ideas about making films, using light and shadow, music and absence of it, filming in small spaces, using 70mm format for sound quality rather than image quality, and other noteworthy subjects. Anyone interested in technical considerations of film making will feel they have spent a day in film school after listening to this commentary.

843668,4,630434063X,"Hyams brought us Capricorn One in 1978, a NASA conspiracy thriller about a faked manned mission to Mars gone awry.  In 1981, he brought us Outland, a thriller about corporate greed and corruption in an age of deep-space mining on Jupiter's violent moon of Io.

Workers have been taking a company-provided narcotic that makes them work like horses, cramming a 14-hour work-day into 6 hours, giving them more time to play.  Management is happy because productivity is high.  Workers are happy because they have more play-time to eat, drink, indulge in company-provided prostitutes free of Syphillus, and be merry.  Only problem is the narcotic causes them to go buggo and do wacky things like pull the plug on their space suits allowing zero-atmosphere pressure in, or taking the elevator down to the vacuum of space without an environment suit, causing their bodies to explode.

Sean Connery as Marshall O'Neil has just been appointed the new Head of Security, and, with a little help from company Dr. Lazrus, played by Frances Sternhagen, gets wind of the plot, so investigates, much to the disdain of General Manager Shepherd, played by Peter Boyle.  Hijinx ensues.  Connery becomes hunted by a group of highly-trained assassins, and, with no help from his men, the lone prey has to become the hunter, with a little help from Dr. Lazarus.

What sets this movie apart, aside from wise casting, is the gritty ""dirt under the fingernails"" production design of the realistic sets (a move inspired by Ridley Scott's ""truckers in space"" Alien two years prior), sterile, fluorescent-light cinematography and Jerry Goldsmith's ""outlandish"", score, a bizarre mix of synthesizer and orchestra.  With these elements, the film becomes a sensual pleasure.

The blu-ray looks very crisp, with superb detail and rich colors, as rich as the sterile fluorescent lighting provides anyway.  I can't compare the blu-ray to the according to other reviewers apparently mediocre at best DVD, as I never got around to collecting the DVD, and thus didn't have to endure it.  I'm downgrading my review to 4 stars, because the blu-ray has no extras save for a theatrical trailer and very interesting commentary track by director Peter Hyams.  Hyams has been called a sci-fi director.  He prefers to call himself a science-FEASIBILITY director, because his movies are plausibly real.

Considering Outland's modest box office success, one can only expect a bare-bones home entertainment release.  Still, Outland is a very good film, spare on dialogue, rich in atmosphere.  It's a very realistic look at a bleak future of space mining operations and the dangers of greed.  ""Even In Space, the Ultimate Enemy is Still Man"".",1405468800,,2693,5.121281464530893

It was fun to see this (rather poorly made in the first place) movie after all these years, but damn, the transfer is bad.  Even worse its six years after Space: 1999 revolutionized effects for films like this and this looks like they never saw or learned from a single episode.  It just looks cheap and silly, as it did when it premiered in theaters.

For a remake of High Noon in space it's okay, but it could have been so much more.  That said, it's great to see a young Frances Sternhagen (Bunny McDougall from Sex and the City).  This is the first film I ever saw her in and I've enjoyed her screen exploits ever since.

The supporting cast, especially Peter Boyle as the heavy, are great. The sense of a man alone without backup, against heavy odds, is really well-communicated.

Suddenly workers begin going crazy and killing themselves.  When Connery finds out why and tries to put a stop to it, the person who runs the show tries to put him out of action.  When that doesn't work with the local talent, he has professional hit men come in on the next shuttle (which only arrives once a month).  He can expect no help from the workers.

Both predict that in the future pledging allegiance to a nation-state will be replaced by pledging allegiance to a corporate-state. The soundtracks for both films are done by Jerry Goldsmith and sound much alike. Alan Dean Foster wrote the novelizations for both films. Granted the Companies mentioned in the films are different organizations, but I've always thought that Weyland-Yutani (ALIEN) and Con-Am (Outland) were possible rivals for resources. Outland is a Western-in-Space story. Just as ALIEN is a Haunted House-in-Space story.

843776,5,630434063X,"Outland was released in 1981, right when Sean Connery's career began to taper off. During an era in the late 70's and early 80's when audiences were engrossed in blockbusters like Alien and E.T., this film is absent from most Cult/Sci-Fi movie lists you will find on the internet.

To enjoy Outland now, almost 35 years later, you must have strong nostalgia for 80's flicks. It's incredibly atmospheric, features a kick-ass score, and stars an aging Sean Connery to boot. You will not find many other movies that are both entertaining and reminiscent of Ridley Scott or John Carpenter. Outland hits the spot.

The plot revolves around a drug bust in a mining colony on Jupiter's moon IO. It's Sean Connery VS the bad guys. No help or sidekicks whatsoever. The plot thickens when *the* general manager of the colony's operation is uncovered as the kingpin responsible for a wave of recent drugged-out psychotics that wreak havoc while tweaked out of their minds.

It's got some High Noon in it, the mood reminiscent of Blade Runner, the gritty sets of Alien and the moral from Walking Tall.  A lot of work went into making the sets seem believable and definitely not pristine, a great lesson out of Star Wars.  So many earlier sci fi movies had slow moving, one dimensional characters that were never seen with the slightest speck of dirt on a single garment.  The plot is a little simple, but is made up for by the acting job of the lead characters which is the best feature of the film.  It is kind of fun to see the interpretation of the future as seen from over 30 years ago.  Foot long video cameras were undoubtedly state of the art at the time with grainy TV quality.  We are nowhere near mining the moons of Jupiter but we have cameras you can barely see that will show high definition pictures of the arm hairs belonging to a card cheat in Vegas.  If you aren't paying attention to too many details, such things as running at high speed through the airtight base as if they are in a normal gravity field won't distract you when movements outside in spacesuits are in slow motion and represent the one sixth gravity they are supposed to have on this moon.  The lighting is pretty bad at times, too, and it is hard to see what is going on in the darker scenes.  The quality of the acting and character play, however, tend to distract you from technical inconsistencies and production issues like that.

843918,4,630434063X,"""Outland"" is likened to ""High Noon"" in space or a space western. With the world now actually on the cusp of space mining, ""Outland"" deserves a fresh viewing. Surprisingly it holds up, largely because it does not emphasize futuristic technology and the plot is not reliant on technology, per se. The future world of ""Outland"" feels as if it might be today or tomorrow. --'Marshal O'Niel' is a role tailor-made for Sean Connery, but let's not forget Frances Sternhagen's terrific turn as the hard-nosed heroine, 'Dr. Lazarus'. Peter Boyle is always great, but as 'the villain' of this tale he has little to do. Looking back and even after today's viewing, Boyle's 'Sheppard' seems underdeveloped, a bit of a cipher. As a corporate shill, 'Sheppard' is probably more realistically drawn than Paul Reiser's 'Carter Burke' in ""Aliens"", but 'Carter Burke' is so rotten that we love it when he comes face-to-face with his doom; whereas 'Sheppard' only gets KO'd by Connery. Beyond that, 'Sheppard's fate' is only alluded to by his corporate 'handler'. Different grades of bad-guy, different fates.

843974,5,630434063X,"That's what you get when you cross the plot to ""High Noon"" with the movie ""Outland"" starring Sean Connery. That is not to say that this movie is as good as that classic western starring Gary Cooper but ""Outland"" is still a good suspense movie that will keep your attention and wondering what will happen next in the story. In a nutshell ""Outland"" takes place on the Jupiter moon Io at a mining colony. A rash of miners start committing suicide unexpectedly. Sean Connery, in one of his best non-James Bond performances, plays the roll of Sheriff William O'Niel at the mining colony who begins to investigate what is causing these unexplained deaths. The manager of the mining colony, played by Peter Boyle, advices Connery to not be concerned with what is going on and forget investigating the deaths. Turns out he has a good reason to not want Connery looking around. Boyle has been bringing in a drug and giving it to the miners that makes them work longer and harder which of course makes the profits for the mining colony higher. Problem is after awhile the drug plays on the mind of the user which makes them go insane and end up killing themselves. Connery finds this out and begins bringing down the operation. That causes Boyle to contact his bosses telling them of this sheriff who is causing problems. Hitmen are sent to the colony to confront and take out Connery. Everyone at the mining colony knows what is going on and when Connery looks to his deputies they are not around to back him up and the miners won't risk their lives to help either. Connery is on his own much the same way Cooper was in ""High Noon"". As I said earlier this movie does not compare to ""High Noon"" but this is still a good variation of that classic story.

The acting is first rate with Connery and Boyle playing well off each other in creating the tension between the two of them. Francis Sternhagen is also excellent as the cranky doctor of the mining colony who is the only one who seems to be concerned for the sheriff and is willing to help. The movie is written and directed by Peter Hyams. His direction of the film helps to create the tension plus the set design gives the viewer a sense of claustrophobia inside the mining colony and during chase scenes. The cinematography and film editing also deserves accolades as well in making this film suspenseful. If you have not seen this film before you got to watch ""Outland"".

On previous discs, the poor video became an irritating distraction from the story. This new version allows the viewer to enjoy the drama. The ""High Noon"" theme has been repeated in dozens of movies before and after ""Outland,"" so viewers may be jaded by the concept, but having Sean Connery play it in outer space is a treat.

In this film, space, technology, and effects serve as a backdrop to the story.  The effects are well done for the time period, and are good enough to not be noticeable, for the most part, and they don't distract from the story.

844126,5,630434063X,"The story will feel eerily familiar to anyone brought up watching movies as it is almost a direct remake of High Noon, the Gary Cooper/Grace Kelly feature that introduced the world to Grace Kelly as an actress.
Of course this is anything but a western but the story line is identical and if anything Connery is a better actor than Gary Cooper ever was despite Mr. Coopers long resume.
It is a superb movie that should appeal to just about everyone and actually shows little else than good triumphing over evil. The ""leading lady"" is a middle aged ships doctor and hardly the unbeliveable beauty that Grace Kelly was but she is a great actress that as recently as last year was still working, a bit ""long in the tooth"" and playing old lady roles but still acting. Her ""biggest"" recent role was as a school teacher caught up in the grocery store in the thriller ""The Mist"".
Sean Connery I believe has retired from acting and is devoting his time toward Scottish Independence. I haven't seen him in a role in at least 5 years, perhaps longer though he may do occasional work in Great Britain, I haven;t a clue.

844247,4,630434063X,"Science fiction films tend to date badly--but not so the 1981 OUTLAND, which encompasses a plausible story with plausible special effects.  Set in a mining camp on Jupiter's moon Io, the story pits an honest but tough marshal against a corrupt company man in a series of sets that look very much like they were lifted from an oil rig.  This is not a pretty movie with breath-taking effects, but instead a gritty space-age noir.

Marshall William T. O'Niel (Sean Connery) has been assigned a year long tour of duty at this very undesirable outpost, and it is not much of a surprise when wife Carol (Kika Markham) takes their son and heads for home--home in this case being earth.  But even as he struggles to cope with this emotional disaster, he discovers there is something really nasty going on at the mining camp.  For no apparent reason, workers become suicidal, psychotic, or both, and the body count is astonishing.  O'Niel finds an unlikely ally in the camp's grouchy Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen), and together they discover workers are being given dangerous drugs to raise their productivity.  When O'Niel confronts camp director Mark Sheppard (Peter Boyle), he finds his life on the line.

A good many people have noted that OUTLAND is similar in plot to HIGH NOON, but I myself found the similarity slight.  There is the subplot of a wife who can't cope any more and the idea of a countdown to deadly confrontation, but that is about it.  The script stands on its own merits--it is tight and clean--and both Connery and Sternhagen give knock-out performances.  They have an extraordinary chemistry, and it makes the film jump.  The DVD has nothing significant in terms of extras, and it could certainly use a remaster, but even so it's worth a look.  Recommended.

(3) A new sheriff comes to the planet and bucks the old corrupt system where lawmen are incompetent, paid off or just don't care. Even the mining workers don't care and a bit hostile; they have their well paying jobs and a red light district.
(4) The new sheriff has personal issues to deal with while fighting crime and corruption.

(6) The sheriff doesn't play along with the system, so how does the system deal with him ?  They send assassins to the planet which only receives a supply shuttle craft one or twice a week; you don't warp off the rock back to earth when you feel like it.  And even though Humans can do interplanetary travel, they still mostly kill with gunpowder & lead bullets.

Above all, it is a personal drama, and slow moving in direction, and dark in atmosphere and mood . . .  it's not Starship Troopers which has action, blood, special effects & daylight, but for the bargain price, this movie is worth it.

But the video quality is awful  . . .  . played it into my Panasonic model 220 blu-ray player, and the picture is 4:3 with horizontal black cut-off widescreen stripes, which means the screen was only about 50% filled.  Checked my settings, and played it on a hi-quality Sony 780, and the same thing happened.  On my no-brand 46"" LCD, I zoomed the picture, but blowing up any source will add unwanted distortion.

the plot revolves around Marshall William O'niel "" Connery "" who has just arrived to a human colony station at the Jupiter moon, and finds himself tangled in a drug smuggling operation trying to bust the bad guys behind it and finding that the majority of the people in the station, including the rest of the police personnel are keeping a closed eye about the whole thing. being isolated and alone against the drug smuggling mob, he finds himself cornered and targeted by them.

the production design was brilliant, a sort of space colony station that is dark and atmospheric that gives a claustrophobic effect. special effects were pretty good for an 80s film, and still stands solid to some extent today.

Connery shines here, it is one of his most memorable performances, he steals the show and his presence adds a lot to this picture. he brings on a solid character who likes to fight for what is right, and at the same time, at a certain points of the movie, you can feel his characters distress and weakness of being all alone and against the odds, being abandoned from all people around him. such a terrific performance.

Now i've seen this film at least twice before back when it was on VHS, and now years later, i was going through a Connery marathon and checking out all his movies that have been re-released on Blu ray, and so i bought me a Bluray copy of Outland, i must say, it is quite a fantastic Bluray transfer, the picture is so clean and smooth with much detail and color, and the sound was equally brilliant, it really deserves the upgrade.

and just like most of Connery films DVDs, the extras are lacking, though i'm not one of those big fans of extras, as all i care about most are the films themselves, however, i've always wanted to see some Connery interviews, but unfortunately he seemed to not make enough of them when marketing his films for some reasons ! and Outland is no different, we only have a trailer and a commentary "" that i haven't listened to "" here.

Overall, a fantastic Blu ray transfer of a brilliant Connery film with a memorable performance from the man, and an engaging story with some cool action.",1357516800,5,2579,5.044600938967136

On Jupitor's moon Io a titanium mining operation is in full swing when the new Federal Marshall, William O'Niel arrives to start his tour of duty.  After several miners die under mysterious circumstances the investigation points to a new drug that allows the miners to work for days without rest.  The mine's manager warns O'Niel to mind his own business or there will be consequences.  O'Niel presses on and finds himself outnumbered and alone with no escape.

The original Star Trek is considered by many to be a space western but Outland takes the idea to a whole new level.  Written by direct Peter Hyams, Outland is little more than High Noon in space where a sheriff must face off against deadly foes when his `town' turns their back on him.  Even though its not much more than a genre transplant Outland is a surprisingly effective sci-fi action-thriller.  Sean Connery is no stranger to science fiction but his film's rarely fit neatly into that one specific genre whether it be Zardoz, Highlander, or even Indiana Jones and Outland isn't any different.  Outland is a mostly forgotten film thirty plus years after its
release but that makes it no less enjoyable.

The original DVD was released in November 1997; that DVD is an ugly, non-anamorphic mess that was almost un-watchable on late 90s video equipment so just imagine what that same disc would look like today.  It was an early Warner Bros. effort featuring their notorious flipper discs (letterbox on one side, pan & scan on the other) housed in one of the ugly snapper cases.  Outland did receive a DVD re-issue in 2007 that axed the pan & scan version and came in a regular DVD case but still sported the same ugly transfer from the 1997 release.

The new Blu-ray edition of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Outland/dp/B007NR93KG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Outland</a>&nbsp;is nothing short of spectacular especially when you consider what fans of this film have been forced to watch since it left theaters in 1981.  While it doesn't look like a brand new film (thankfully) it does look amazing for its age.  Gone are the large artifacts, the shaking transfer, the muddy and indistinguishable blacks and in its place is a transfer that has been given real care.  The print used for the transfer was clean of debris like dust but was not scrubbed free of detail or grain.  Colors are vibrant, black levels are respectable for the most part with only a few shots not holding up well, and the level of detail is outstanding.

The original DVD release states ""Soundrack Remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1' but in all honesty it's a pretty miserable mix that I always thought sounded like I was listening to the movie through a roomful of police megaphones.  Theatrically Outland was presented in Warner Bros. short lived Megasound format which was used to enhance the  theatrical auditory experience mostly by adding a lot more bass than a normal theater could output at that time.  The 5.1 DTS-HD MA soundtrack is very enveloping leading me to believe that the original 70MM Six Track soundtrack was used in the remastering of the Blu-ray.  Surround activity is on the lighter side but the three front channels and the LFE channel are as distinct as you'd hear in many newer films.  Dialogue is well anchored in the center channel and Jerry Goldsmith's score sounds properly un-Earthy occupying the rest of the front soundstage.

After being mostly ignored on home video for the past three decades I wasn't expecting much in form of special features on Outland but Warner Bros. again blew me away.  There's not any new documentary or deleted scenes but there is an all new commentary track by director Peter Hyams.  It's a highly informative and entertaining track that must have been recently recorded because of some references to recently produced HBO programming.  He shares his personal recollections about working with Sean Connery along with many tidbits about all aspects of the production from casting to the then cutting edge special effects.  It's definitely worth a listen.  Also included is the film's theatrical trailer presented in very cruddy looking standard definition.  Give the trailer a watch just to get an idea of what the DVD looked like.

It's not a forgotten masterpiece but it has been mostly forgotten by audiences and its studio until now.  Warner Bros. has taken real care in restoring its visual and audio components plus kudos needs to be given for recording an all new commentary.  If you're a sci-fi fan, a Connery fan, or both you should definitely check out Outland.",1344124800,23,5430,5.306432748538012
844522,4,630434063X,"In the late seventies(Alien and the sequel of Invasion of the body snatchers) and even in the early eighties (Blade Runner, 2010, Outland and Terminator)the sci fi genre achieved a pinnacle in which recreation of the myth concerns.

And this classic of the genre, despite having been of the famous Western High Noon  erects itself as a truly icon in its own.

Sean Connery for that moment was by then,the most credible action-hero the cinema was proud to show. He had already filmed Zardoz under John Borman's direction nine years ago). And I think to myself Brian de Palma chose him to play the role that eventually would lead him to award an Academy Award (The untouchables)due this role.

Connery is a Marshal who is dispossed to bring it back an anormal situation (an anfetamine who makes of you major results within minor hours of job. But this illusion lasts ten years at last because you get beseek.

If the workers are happy, the production enhances, the high management is happy and me too. That's Schepard statement when he confronts himself with the Marshal.

High tension drama, first-order visual effects and credible plot make of this film a well rounded sci fi movie as well as an unforgettable cult movie.",1343779200,,1221,4.79047619047619
844523,4,630434063X,"The late 1970s and early 1980s were a groundbreaking period for science fiction films. It got kicked off by ""Star Wars,"" which fueled the imaginations of many directors of the time. It also caused studios to trip over each other in their search for the next big space saga. Some of those films were fun like ""Battle Beyond the Stars."" Others were serious works of art like ""Alien,"" ""The Black Hole,"" and Peter Hyams' ""Outland.""

Thanks to Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, ""Outland"" is available on Blu-ray for the first time. This was director Hyams' first journey into deep space. He worked in the sci-fi field once before with ""Capricorn One,"" but this 1981 cult classic took him to another world... or moon would be more accurate. Some say this was Hyams' practice for the more complex ""2010,"" which he helmed a couple of years later.

Veteran Federal Marshal William O'Niel (Sean Connery) is assigned to a mining operation on Jupiter's moon, Io. He soon discovers the foreman (Peter Boyle) of the mine, Mark Sheppard, is supplying his workers with a deadly amphetamine that increases their work stamina but causes psychotic breakdowns and hallucinations. O'Niel finds himself going up against Sheppard's hired assassins with only the help of the mining operation's medical doctor, Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen).

""Outland"" has all the elements of a classic sci-fi film of the 1970s / 1980s era. You have the claustrophobic environment of the space station. All the corridors and living areas are metallic or medical stark white. Everyone wears military / law enforcement ball caps and jumpsuits of some type. Most of the men in the film have big bushy beards and long hair. They also smoke in environments where they shouldn't be.

Jerry Goldsmith composed the soundtrack for the film. It resembles the score of ""Alien"" to an extent. There's a dash of ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" in it as well. I can't say the music is as memorable as either one of those, but it gets the job done.

The movie is very much a sci-fi version of the classic western stand-off and 1970s drug smuggling drama. Imagine ""High Noon"" mashed together with ""Serpico"" but on a moon of Jupiter. One of its most effective elements is the digital clock countdown which shows when the ship is arriving that holds the assassins sent to kill O'Niel. It's nerve-wracking to watch Connery's character preparing for his lone stand against corruption.

The practical and front projection special effects accurately reflect the time period the movie was made in. We get prosthetic heads blowing up, bodies bursting in space, and other visual atrocities. It's nice to see some effects reminiscent of ""Alien,"" ""Scanners,"" and ""The Thing"" versus all the CGI we're fed today.

The high definition transfer looks great. The picture is as clean as it's ever been. It exposes some of the limits on the special effects of the time but there's always going to be a give and take in these situations. The 5.1 surround sound delivers an excellent audio experience. Every blast of a gun, hiss of an airlock, and note of the musical score jumps out at you.

One thing consumers won't be happy with is the amount of special features included. There's commentary by Peter Hyams and a theatrical trailer. That's all we get. Where's the ""Making of"" featurette or documentary? Surely there's behind-the-scenes footage lying around somewhere.

If you're looking for the best audio and visual presentation of this classic film, the Blu-ray version of ""Outland"" is pleasing. Just don't expect this new version to include a great amount of bonus materials. It's still recommended for people who continually seek to upgrade their home entertainment collections.",1343260800,6,3706,4.993517017828201
844524,4,630434063X,"""Outland"" is one of my favorite '80s Sci-Fi movies due to the above par acting and solid plot line. I first saw this when it was released in theaters back in 1981 and, as it happens, that was the same night I met my future ex-wife and I still like the movie.

No plot spoilers from me; This is basically a western set in a corporate mining colony on Io, one of Jupiter's moons. The story is centered on William O'Niel (Sean Connery), a marshal responsible for upholding the law in the dangerous, frontier setting. O'Niel has the same problems that come up whenever men have too much money and free time, complicated by the remoteness of the outpost. This does take the time needed to give us good character development on the principle players so when the action starts you actually care about what happens to them. The industrial feel and claustrophobia settings inside the colony add a lot to the realism and the special effects are good enough for when the movie was made.

This is one of the movies that I can pick up and watch anytime that we can't decide on another movie and everyone will enjoy it.

844529,4,630434063X,"One of director Peter Hyams best films ""Outland"" came about because of Hyams desire to make a western at a time when westerns just weren't popular so the director changed the setting for his film--putting it in outer space.

As many have pointed out ""Outland"" is really ""High Noon"" in outer space but there's much more to this 80's film than that. Sean Connery gives a terrific performance new Marshall William O'Niel on the planet Io where mining operations continue to make huge profits for the company supervisor Mark Sheppard played by the late Peter Boyle. When the miners start to go crazy suffering from hallucinations that cause them to kill themselves, O'Niel seeks the assistance of his corrupt deputy Motone (James B. Sikking) and Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen who is, interestingly, the same age as Connery)to find out what the cause is of the termporary insanity that is killing the miners before it's too late.

""Outland"" received an indifferent DVD transfer so I'm happy to report that this budget priced Blu-ray receives a stellar, largely sharp and detailed transfer of the film. Blacks are often inky and skin tones look quite nice. There aren't really any digital defects to report with this nice presentation but keep in mind that this film was made in 1980 (and released in 1981)when film stocks tended to be a bit more grainy without the richer detail we often see with more contemporary releases.

The audio is a knock out with a sharp, immersive 5.1 lossless mix. Dialogue is always clear and directional effects are nicely used in ""Outland"".

Unfortunately the only special features we get are a commentary track from writer/director Hyams and the original theatrical trailer. The former is an informative track with Hyams remembering quite a bit of detail of shooting the movie including a discussion of how he composited the visual effects, simple gaffes such as the changing spelling of O'Niel's last name (from scene-to-scene it can be seen to shift from O'Neil to O'Niel)as well as his working relationship with Connery during the film.

There aren't any featurettes (I'm sure there must have been a vintage featurette produced for TV for ""Outland"" but it isn't included here probably because it's missing)but we do get the original theatrical trailer. It's interesting to contrast how trailers changed in the wake of films like ""Alien"" comparing this theatrical trailer to what came before and after. I keep hoping that one of these days we'll get a featurette on the production of trailers featuring the folks that put them together discussing what their intent was with certain films and comparing them as it's almost as important in how you sell a film to an audience in setting up expectations and the success of a film as the film itself.

A very nice looking Blu-ray that improves on the weak presentation on DVD, ""Outland"" looks and sounds quite good in its high definition debut. The commentary track is quite good giving us detailed background on the film and we also get the theatrical trailer. The Blu-ray uses the generic menu that is featured lately on all of Warner's budget titles.

Peter Boyle is the head baddie willing to buy everyone off so he can fulfill his lofty retirement plans and run some crooked goings on. Sean tries to stick to his morals all while dealing with threats of death non-stop. The picture quality is top-notch. The sound is also great as well. Frances Sterhagen and James B.

844556,4,630434063X,"Writer-director Peter Hyams' ""space western"" stars Sean Connery as a marshal assigned to a desolate mining colony on Io, one of Jupiter's moons. There, he finds a surprising number of workers perishing in a number of apparent suicides - but after uncovering evidence, Connery determines that their deaths are caused by a lethal drug being smuggled into the station by corrupt company man Peter Boyle. Connery and Boyle end up butting heads when the marshal decides he's not willing to play along with the latter's schemes, leading to a number of sharp-shooters being brought in to knock off the intergalactic man of the peace.

Hyams' original script pays obvious homage to ""High Noon"" and is certainly  structured more like a western than a typical `80s genre film. It does, however, look like a post-""Alien"" piece, with the entire appearance of the film evoking the production design of Ridley Scott's 1979 classic (Hyams confirms as much in the Blu-Ray's new audio commentary). There are some logistical gaps in Hyams' screenplay, and a fair amount of the dialogue is leaden, but Connery is both believable and sympathetic here, giving a finely tuned performance that encompasses the marshal's steadfast pursuit of justice as well as empathic scenes involving his wife and son, the former deciding that Io is no place to raise a kid early on. Frances Sternhagen is excellent as the good doctor who grudgingly comes to Connery's aid (she's the only one who does), while James B. Sikking chips in an effective, if brief, supporting turn as Connery's right hand man who's also, unsurprisingly, on Boyle's payroll.

Hyams generates a fair amount of suspense throughout - the countdown clock anticipating the arrival of a shuttle with the hired guns goes hand in hand with Jerry Goldsmith's tense score in keeping first-time viewers engaged - and the film culminates in a satisfying, if expected, conclusion. ""Outland"" may not be a classic film but it's still entertaining and compelling, one of Hyams' stronger works, and certainly one of Connery's more memorable non-Bond vehicles.

Warner's Blu-Ray is undoubtedly going to help the film's reputation, seeing as their original U.S. DVD was 4:3 and mastered from elements that looked like they were derived from their 1990s laserdisc release. This new 1080p AVC encoded transfer is an immeasurable enhancement over that monstrosity, doing as much for the cinematography as Hyams' penchant for shooting in low light allows. The DTS MA sound is robustly mixed, and an original trailer is included along with Hyams' new commentary track.

844637,3,630434063X,"I was 9 years old when OUTLAND appeared in theaters, and unless you were around then, and a sci-fi nerd, you probably can't concieve of the anticipation it caused. For many months leading up to its debut all the nerd magazines were in frenzies of excitement, and even kids like moi, who had no chance in hell of seeing it at the time of its release, were equally eager. We were still resonating from STAR WARS and STAR TREK and ALIEN, and this movie seemed to fall somewhere within that august category. The huge amount of effort being sunk into the film - the construction of huge, extremely functional sets, very much in the mold of George Lucas and Ridley Scott, was igniting our imaginations, as was the presence of a Sean Connery who in 1981 looked considerably better than he had ten years earlier in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. What's more, its director was Peter Hyams, who had also given us CAPRICORN ONE, a film beloved by kids of the day for its nonstop action and sarcastic dialogue. In an age before movie hype, this movie had some serious hype behind it.

Last night, 31 years after its release, I watched the movie for the first time in many, many years, under the vague theory that it might retroactively live up to all that fuss. Sadly, I must report in the negative. It is still just as straightforward, flat and underwhelming as it was back when, and that is truly sad, because on paper, this should be a damn good flick.

OUTLAND is the story of W.T. O'Neil (Sean Connery), a space cop who has just arrived on the mining colony of Io, with his reluctant wife and gelatinous son. O'Neil's wife is not happy about being assigned to a sleazy mining camp on one of Jupiter's moons, and promptly leaves him. Still absorbing this blow, O'Neil immediately butts heads with the camp's sleazy boss, Shepherd (Peter Boyle), who makes it clear that space cops ""cop best when they cop least."" O'Neil, however, is intrigued by a series of suicides and violent incidents among the miners, and with the help of a crusty company doctor named Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen), his investigation quickly uncovers a conspiracy involving the company operating the mine. It also riles those who want the secret of the miners' deaths to stay secret...and who are willing to kill to keep it that way.

Like its inspiration, HIGH NOON, this flick is essentially the story of a man who, in taking a stand against evil, finds himself completely alone - abandoned not only by his family and his fellow cops, but by the people he is trying to protect. Unlike HIGH NOON, however, the sum of its parts don't add up to a whole. There are things that do work - Connery is often enjoyable to watch, his morally confused partner Monton, played by James Sikking, does a good job, and the mining colony's set design is amazing and looks absolutely real - but as a story, it fails on almost every level. This movie has many, many problems, but what amazes me most about the film to this day is its extreme predictability and shallowness. The central mystery of why the miners are starting to go mad is no mystery at all, and in any case O'Neil solves it almost immediately, whereupon the film transitions into a simple battle of wills between him and Shepherd. There are no real sub-plots, and only one halfhearted attempt at a late-movie plot-twist, which is obvious from miles off and comes as no surprise whatsoever. After wowing the audience in the first half with his huge, lavish and highly realistic sets, we are bludgeoned in the final act with repeated, and hideously fake, shots of the exterior of the mining colony, which destroy all sense of credibility. To make matters worse, while the acting is generally solid, the dialogue is often stilted and sometimes just plain atrocious, and Hyams shoots almost every sequence from a middle distance or a wide angle, giving what should be the most emotional scenes a cold, detached, disinteresting quality. Even worse yet, some tearjerking moments between O'Neil and his son come off as hilarous because the kid who plays Paul O'Neil comes off like a serial killer in training. But what really got me is that while there are dozens or even hundreds of extras in this movie, there are really only four characters, and none of them have that much depth. I've seldom seen a movie that felt so impersonal, or failed so completely to connect me emotionally to my heroes and villains.

Don't mistake me. I really wanted to like OUTLAND, but in the end, I found it has just enough good parts to annoy me that it isn't better. Maybe in another 31 years.",1338595200,4,4573,4.63501849568434

I was intrigued how it would be updated to set it in space... except the 'High Noon' connection is more tenuous than I was led to believe; it's really only the last part of the film.

Like a lot of Hyams work it feels dated now, the special effects in particular. All the model shots, for example, have been filmed too fast; they needed more frames to give a sense of scale. This is mystifying because it was made post 'Star Wars'. Indeed the influence of 'Star Wars' and especially 'Alien' is felt throughout. I guess the production didn't have enough money. That said, it uses its budget wisely and by repeating the various sets over and over (from different angles and with a variety of lighting) you get the sense of a big colony - a trick I guess was learnt from Ridley Scott.

One thing limited budget can't excuse is the script. In places the dialogue is toe-curlingly stilted. The characters also lack depth and there's very little in the way of motivation for either O'Neill or Lazarus. Although the last line is neat, the ending is rather inconclusive.

Despite all this there are some virtuoso moments. The chase through the colony is exhilarating - a perfect example of mobile camerawork in an age when that was easier said than done.

Saying that, I still love this movie. Those reviewers who said it was high noon in space are exactly right, but it is also mixed with 1980s paranoia about the morality of private companies, and fears about drugs.

Taking Outland on its own merits, and having seen it before, I really can't say it made much of an impression on me (with either viewing).  I found it singularly uninvolving, almost passive; where was the excitement, the intrigue, the challenge?  Yes, there was a chase sequence through the complex, people died, hit men showed up, the Marshal's wife leaves him (in a very ho-hum fashion, bye).  And that's the problem with this movie.  Most of the characters were very relaxed in their approach, almost neutral.  The only one who stood out, start to finish, was the fabulous Frances Sternhagen (""I'm unpleasant, I'm not stupid!""), as the mining colony's resident doctor.  Everyone else faded into the mechanics of the place or their costumes (as so-called villains, Peter Boyle and sub-villain James B. Sikking were especially placid).  Even when Sean Connery was standing up for what he believed in I saw very little in the way of commitment.  The whole movie was just going through the motions, getting the job done.  I won't go as far as to say I was bored watching this film, but I wasn't overly excited either.  It was just okay.
Having seen it twice, decades apart, I now have no inclination to watch it again.  Not a keeper.

844730,4,630434063X,"Outland (Peter Hyams, 1981)

When you think ""great Sean Connery movies"", Outland, Peter Hyams' 1981 spac western, is not usually the first thing that springs to mind. In fact, I'm not quite sure it springs to anyone's mind, ever, these days. And yet every couple of years I find myself with a strong desire to rewatch it, which I did again last night. I first saw Outland some time in the early eighties--I can't be quite sure when, as I hadn't started keeping a record of that sort of thing yet--but I was in my middle teens, and I watched it because a friend of mine, who was an avid Fangoria reader, gushed about the decompression special effects. Of course, it wasn't long after that that the idea of a person blowing up in space was put to rest, but when you're thirteen or fourteen years old, what do you care about that sort of thing? And we watched it, and it was good. Didn't really stick in the memory too long, but it was enjoyable watching James Bond charging through a futuristic-looking space camp with a good old-fashioned pump shotgun and warming up to the prickly station doctor (Frances Sternhagen, one of America's great unsung actresses). I didn't know a great deal about film then, and while I heard the term ""High Noon in space"" attached to it any number of times, I really didn't get the concept. I just knew it was a pretty good action movie where instead of stuff blowing up, people did it, and that was enough for me.

Nowadays, every time I rewatch it, I find something else worthy of praise. Sometimes in the mid-nineties it occurred to me that Jerry Goldsmith's score was remarkably prescient about the way music was going to go when it was in rock-and-roll mode, prefiguring that interesting mix of goth and industrial that would briefly find a popular footing in bands like Skinny Puppy and Manufacture a few years down the road. This time, though, was special: for the first time, I had seen High Noon.

Plot: Connery plays O'Neil, a new marshal at a mining camp on Io. On the day of his arrival, one of the workers goes bugs, imagining spiders crawling up his leg and into his suit, leading him to try and take it off outside (and the first body explodes, with that cheesy/awesome face-expanding effect). The next day, another worker decides to take a smoke break outside without putting on a suit (we only see the aftereffects of that particular explosion, which happens in a descending elevator). Sheppard (Peter Boyle in a rare slick-villain role), who runs the station, passes it off as ""some people just can't handle space"", as does everyone else. When O'Neil asks the camp doctor to do a little digging, they find that the incidence of people not being able to handle space went way, way up about a year before. (Thanks to the omniscience of the camera, we already know this has something to do with drugs.) It's then that the movie goes into High Noon mode, and it really does make sense; O'Neil is talking about stopping the flow of drugs, and who in the camp wants that?

Hyams hasn't done much recently, and when he has it's been forgettable (A Sound of Thunder, anyone?), but let's not forget that when he focused on sci-fi in the seventies and eighties, he was one of Hollywood's go-to guys; Outland fell right between Capricorn One, a now-forgotten gem, and 2010: The Year We Make Contact. That was quite a sci-fi run there, and really, we can blame his sci-fi outings in the nineties on the scripts just being bad. (How many good sci-fi flicks did you see in the nineties? About as many as I did, I'd warrant--and none of those came out of Hollywood.) Outland gets better every time I watch it, not because of the cheesy effects or the occasionally-wooden dialogue, but because the more I know about film and culture, the more in it I find to appreciate. I always wondered why the assassins that come in on the shuttle at the end never spoke, and why the countdown to the shuttle's arrival, which dominates the third quarter of the film, was so prominent. Having now seen High Noon, I get it now, and I am willling to call this ""homage"" rather than ""rip-off""; after all, Hyams, who also wrote the film, grafted the techniques from High Noon onto a totally different plot. (As a side note, this also explains what I'd always thought was a useless tangent in Robert Rodriguez' Desperado, which is another brilliant High Noon reference. And includes guitar-case machine guns, which can never be a bad thing.) There's a lot to be said about the changing cultural anxieties dictating the plots of High Noon and Outland. Were you to remake either one today, I've no doubt the entering assassins would be Arabic, at least if you were remaking it in Hollywood. But (a) that line of thinking has already been done to death by other critics and (b) I've babbled on about this movie long enough. If you never got the chance to see Outland, which faded into unjust obscurity a few years after its release, I highly recommend it. If you saw it once back in the day and never revisited it, I still highly recommend it. Solid from front to back, and a barrel of cheesy fun to boot. ****",1300233600,,5118,4.559782608695652
844731,5,630434063X,"I can't articulate exactly why, but I find myself watching 'Outland' about once a year. It's funny because the movie actually leaves me with a slightly hollow feeling. Kind of like, maybe the film was not so great after all or maybe the subject matter was simply a bit depressing. But I seem to keep coming back to it. The anticipation of watching Outland again begins to build over time and there I am, popping the movie back in. One thing I know for sure is that it immediately transports me to a mining moon where a good cop is sorely needed and Connery was perfectly cast. Of course, seeing some guy explode in a space suit leaves a lasting impression when you are a little kid. Back then we were all like, ""Whoa!""

Note: About the DVD supposedly 'released' by Warner Brothers in 2007. It sucks worse than you can possibly imagine!! It is the same DVD transfer they originally released waaay back in 1997. The transfer is almost as bad as the old beat up VHS tape of Outland I have. The DVD is horribly grainy and the widescreen picture is TINY because it is boxed on ALL FOUR sides by thick, black bars!! What they did prior to 1997 was take the widescreen movie and 'shrink' it down so that it would play as widescreen on a square 1:33 TV screen (letterboxing). Doing this permanently printed thick black bars above and below the picture. But that's not all folks! Upon transferring the movie to DVD in 1997 the studio did not go back to the original film print. They just took the made for TV print and slapped it on a DVD!!! So if you play this DVD the widescreen picture will not size up to fill your widescreen TV... because the black bars above and below are PART of the movie! The end result is that you get thick black bars (pillars) on the left and right of the picture as well!!!

The only good bit of news is that in 2009 the studio announced that they hired some director to remake Outland. If that happens, as happened with True Grit, maybe they will release a quality Blu-ray print of the original Outland... to cash in of course.",1294099200,,2049,4.361256544502618

There are a few racy scenes, the area where workers, who commit to a year of service in a mining operation on a remote moon of Jupitor, relax.  Replete with prostitutes and exotic dancers, the men are able to enjoy some connection with the pleasures of earth.  But those scenes are done tastefully, and are very much part of the plot.

The only fault I would find with the movie is the ending.  Without giving it away for those who may have not seen it, it struck me that the 'agents' would have been more savy about using their weapons in space.

844807,4,630434063X,"This is a film that came out while I was in high school, that I didn't manage to see at the time, despite my interest even then in science fiction.  I believe I did see this once on VHS around 1988-89 or so, but my memory was pretty dim, and it was time for another look.  I've since seen quite a few of director/writer Peter Hyams' films and have generally had mixed feelings about them - he's something of a whipping boy in the science fiction film community I think, a guy with a genuine interest in the genre and occasionally some really good ideas who rarely seems to bring them to real fulfillment - from either a critical or commercial standpoint.  But he did do some fine work in the earlier part of his career, particularly with his first science fiction film CAPRICORN ONE (1977), and there's an unpretentiousness to those first several films that seems to appeal more to me as I get older.

So I'm pleased to report that OUTLAND, on a second viewing, shows Hyams at his very best.  It's been described as a ""western in space"" or even more specifically as ""High Noon in space"" but that is being unfairly simplistic I think, though there's no question that the film does have elements in common with that particular film and other 50s politically-oriented westerns.  The ""one honest guy against the system"" idea isn't specific to any particular western or even to that genre or to action films in general, of course, and that's really the heart of the film.

Sean Connery is that one guy, O'Niel (no first name is ever given), the new U.S. Marshall on the Con Am mining colony on Io, a moon of Jupiter rich in Titanium.  O'Niel is a career cop who has moved from place to place solving problems - and being the nasty cog in the machinery of corruption and slackness, apparently.  Which is why he's now stationed on a grungy mining colony, with an apparently quite boring year ahead of him.  Only it turns out pretty quickly to be more than he bargained for, as a rash of unexplainable apparent suicides is occurring, and his wife decides to leave him and go back to Earth.  This latter I suppose is mostly so that we don't have to bother with having a bunch of domestic scenes, and O'Niel can get on with his business; but it also rather quickly establishes the essentially solitary, obsessive nature of the man, which Connery conveys beautifully in one of his better performances.

O'Niel figures there's something just not right about a couple of guys in the space of a couple of days deciding they don't need to worry about spacesuits in an airless, near-absolute zero environment, and he quickly enlists the aid of a cynical, bored doctor (Frances Sternhagen) in getting a blood sample from one of the victims analyzed.  It's not easy to do, as the men are shipped off-world almost immediately for disposal - no autopsies as per the company's order.  Why becomes apparent at once, as O'Niel and Dr. Lazarus discover that the dead guy's system contains loads of an illegal and highly dangerous artificial amphetamine - pushed onto the hapless workers to increase productivity by agents of the unscrupulous manager Sheppard (Peter Boyle at his most garrulous and dangerous) and having the unfortunate side affect of sometimes making them go bonkers.

So it's O'Niel against Sheppard, or rather Sheppard's hired guns, as an eventual showdown is arranged and the rest of the ""town"" decides to get out of the way.  This is the part that really has a High Noon feel to it, albeit the environment of the station is used in several interesting ways against the ultimately hapless (am I spoiling too much? I don't think so) assassins by the expert, methodical O'Neil.  But what's really impressive in the end about Outland is the grungy environment, the feeling of a real working space, a real mining colony with it's various dangers, it's union, it's uneasy relationship with management and security, and it's few pleasures (hookers and booze).  Of course all of that is pretty Earth-like - except that here, nobody can go outside for a little stroll.  And the whole evil corporation thing is pretty well realized, though it's really used entirely as a plot point, rather than as any indictment on Hyams' part of real-world conditions; Hyams isn't trying to pretend to be some great anti-capitalist campaigner for the lowly workers here, like James Cameron tries to do at times.

All in all then, a very well-crafted action-thriller with a terrific, low-key and moody performance from Connery, matched by the sarcastic and witty Sternhagen, and a really nice sense of pacing and feeling for the claustrophobic insides of a large yet confining interior space amidst a harsh alien atmosphere.  Leaving aside the very obvious and only intermittently impressive models, the effects and production are pretty darn solid - though I do have to question the popularity of the sawed-off shotgun for the security forces!  I guess that's just a wacky touch that I'll have to accept.

A word about the DVD: you'll see lots of complaints from many reviewers about the quality of the presentation, and with some justification, but this 2007 remastering is watchable enough, though I wouldn't pay a lot for it.  It'd be nice to see a really good transfer with a director's commentary, but don't hold your breath - if you're interested in the film, it's worth getting as is I think, unless you're somebody that insists on everything looking perfect.  I'm not sure that on the budget Hyams had in 1981 and given the way the film probably looked new that it's realistic to hope for that, though - or realistic to hope that there's enough interest out there for somebody to pony up the money to do a really great edition of this somewhat forgotten film.",1271980800,,5739,4.7379518072289155

The movie is hard sci fi in the realism of its detail, with lots of realistic action.  I particularly like the portrayal of the uses of the space vacuum, which added something unexpected to the violence of life on Io.  But the core of the movie is the characters, who are played by fine actors.  Connery is great as a flawed but good man.  He is in a mid-life crisis and decided to bust out of his limits.  Much like the loneliness of Gary Cooper in an ungrateful frontier city, he thinks he must fight alone.  Boyle is the evil boss, under his own pressures.  Finally, the doctor is great as an unexpected friend.

I'm not an ""A/V geek"" who obsesses about his home theater system, has gold plated cables, etc. The problems with this DVD are obvious to even an untrained viewer.

I watched this using a projector, screen, and Dolby 5.1 sound.

The video transfer is inconsistent. Some scenes are acceptable, others are full of obvious encoding artifacts that are distracting to the eye. Some scenes are so bad that look like a bootleg copy.

The audio is another problem. The original film was shot with Sensurround, which was a short-lived audio format designed to provide intense low frequency sounds (rumbling, explosions, etc.).

There's nothing wrong with Sensurround, but it seems that in the transfer to Dolby 5.1, the bare minimum was done. The low frequency sounds are definitely cranked up to eleven, but the rest of the audio sounds like mono. So, the transition between action scenes and regular dialog is jarring.

The 1997 release of ""Blade Runner"" is famous for being a bad DVD transfer. The 2007 release of ""Outland"" is much worse, which is astonishing.

844904,3,630434063X,"Okay, so I'm going to sound off a bit on a particular pet peeve of mine.  Recently a lot of very good, classic movies have been suffering at the hands of the `eventual remake' when a lot of decent yet nothing special films remain forgotten and ignored.  So, I make my plea.  Instead of remaking comedic classics like `Clue' or attempting to revitalize `Gone with the Wind', why don't you focus on smaller films that never got the audience they deserved because the technology of the time failed to elevate the material.

Case and point; I give you `Outland'.

This is not a great movie, but it is a decent one, and it is one that would really excel with a fresh remake.  Touch it up a bit, add some new graphics, clean up the grit and add a glossy veneer and will take the film to another level.

This is the kind of film that begs for a remake.

The film revolves around a police marshal in the distant future who is stationed on a mining colony off one of Jupiter's moons.  He is immediately given the cold shoulder by the men aboard the colony, and when a few strange deaths raise concern he is really given the shaft.  He uncovers a drug smuggling scheme and is pretty much given direct orders to ignore it.  When he doesn't do as he's told he finds his life in danger.

Conceptually, the film is good.  The acting is even pretty decent, with Sean Connery fitting very nicely into the role of the macho hero.  But, in the end the film lacks in the technical department, and with the choppy editing and the poor transfer the film kind of goes all over the place as it reaches the end.  In fact, the last half hour was very hard for me to watch.  The thing is though, this would make for a great movie if it was made right now, with a tight and smart script (rework it just a little to bring it up to date) and a strong cast (I don't want to see Vin Diesel or anyone like that) coupled with a talented and visionary director (I'm thinking Danny Boyle) and you'd have a home run.

Alas, I doubt this will ever get the glossy treatment it deserves.  If that is the case I can't say that I'd run out and see this one.  It's good, but not good enough.  Connery isn't enough to make this entirely worth it, and the picture quality is very, very weak.",1238457600,,2247,4.217798594847775

The February 2008 DVD release seems to be marginally less grainy and distorted. However, the color intensity and resolution are still not quite up to par with present-day movie transfers. Low-light scenes suffer from fading and graininess which may become especially apparent on large screens. On smaller widescreen TVs (under 30 inches), filmed signs and lettering are acceptably crisp but post-production titles and captions remain blurred.

I have always liked Outland because it relied more upon mature characters (including a tough female country doctor) to tell the story, and resisted the temptation in Hollywood to fall back upon gun-blazing mayhem conducted by inexperienced young rookies.

Sci-fi fans may quibble over a variety of details, but all in all it is a very satifying piece of work.

Like the prototypical ""High Noon,"" ""Outland"" is about an idealistic sheriff in a company town who refuses to be bought. Set in a mining colony on a moon of Jupiter, the film pits a steely-eyed marshall (Sean Connery) against a corrupt boss (Peter Boyle) and his murderous henchmen. It has crackling dialog, particularly in the scenes between Connery and Frances Sternhagen, who plays a crusty doctor and his only ally.

Apparently in Europe they received a much better transfer of this movie which has none of the problems the US version does. I'll be finding a copy of it there. Way to go Warner!! AVOID THE US VERSIONS AT ALL COST!!!

Let me start out by saying first that for me Outland will always hold a special place in my heart. Growing up I was a bit of a black and white snob, stemming from the fact that I grew up with color television.  So due to this fact I was not exposed to the source material for this film until later in life. For those not aware, Outland is a Sci-Fi retelling of the classic movie ""High Noon"".  So this was my first exposure to the classic story of a lone law man against the odds where the ""towns"" people around him refuse to help.

While it may not be the best movie ever made it's a well done and well acted movie starring Sean Connery in one of his few true Sci-Fi roles. Here he plays Federal Marshall William T. O'Neil who we see arriving with his family at a Mining facility located on Io, one of Jupiter's moons. The basic plot sees Connery through tracking down an illegal drug that is causing some of the inhabitants of the facility to become violent and even graphically (if not realistically) suicidal.

The Marshal runs into a few stereotypical characters along the way. We have the cranky doctor, played wonderfully by Frances Sternhagen. Then we have the bad guy of the movie played with a bit of unusual casting, by Peter Boyle, most well known as the creature from ""Mel Brooks, Young Frankenstein"" and the dad on ""Everybody Loves Raymond"". Boyle's character is the one true week point of this film, but in a unique way. His character is the Administrator of the mining facility and his job is to ensure that everything runs smoothly, including the distribution of recreational drugs to his hard working miners. He is not scary as much as he is simply doing his job which makes his actions even more despicable.

When the Marshall finally captures the dealer of the drug operation who fingers Boyle's character the Marshall confronts him. This sets in motion the final and best part of this movie which is basically the same as the climax of ""High Noon"". Hired guns are flown in and are gunning for the Marshall, he has to avoid and outsmart them in order to survive and it's here that this movie really pays off. Using the environment and Sci-Fi setting to maximum effect, Director Peter Hyams creates a great cat and mouse sequence with some really fun results.

The movie is soon to be re-released on DVD and hopefully this time they will repair the truly horrible transfer that this movie has had up until now.  This was surprising given that it was one of the first movies ever to be released on the format but shows the relative poor performance that a lot of studios had back in the early days of transferring movies to digital formats.

If you're looking for a fun movie you can do far worse than Outland. A classic it may not be, but it's far better than most of the Sci-Fi channel movies of the week and hopefully this new release set for November 27th 2007 will finally do the movie justice on DVD.",1193529600,7,3361,4.452032520325203
845078,4,630434063X,"Sure it's ""High Noon"" in space, but it works well with a very powerful star turn by Sean Connery as a Marshall of a mining town on Jupiter's moon Io. Backing him up are Frances Sternhagen as the ""town"" doctor and his only help, and Peter Boyle as the bad guy who runs the mine and the drugs that are killing the miners.

  Miners are going mad on Io and they are killing themselves in very strange ways(exposing themselves to the outside and being blown to bits) and new Marshall O'Neil(Connery) wants to know why. With the help of the town doctor(Sternhagen, who almost steals this movie from Connery) he learns that a drug that makes you work harder and is very illegal is being given to the works and the town manager(Boyle reeking with venom) is the one getting it to him. Connery then begins to shut the system down.

  I won't say anymore, but it is really quite good. The production design has an ""Alien"" look about it and the tension is very well done. All in all a hidden ""gem"" worth a look.",1176249600,,1000,4.349462365591398
845079,3,630434063X,"Released in the space between ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Blade Runner,"" ""Outland"" is a decent if slightly lacking film.

The plot concerns Marshall O'Niel (Sean Connery) being appointed the head officer on a mining colony on Io, a moon of Jupiter.  As if his grudging family wasn't enough, he's got reports of miners dying after suffering psychotic episodes.  With help from his only real ally, Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen), O'Niel discovers the miners are being supplied with a performance-enhancing drug that has some nasty after-effects.  Mine manager Sheppard (the late Peter Boyle), after suffering a loss of product at O'Niel's hands, calls in some corporate thugs to fix things.

Director Peter Hyams (2010, Timecop) has on his side excellent production design and decent special effects for the 80s.  But the plot, while inventive, isn't much else.  Connery, Boyle and the rest do good with their roles, but the script has some pointless filler and awkward talk.  Aside from one excellent chase scene through the station, the action is limited and slow.  The film also plods at 109 minutes, with several interesting scenes balanced out by several patches of empty downtime.

Connery, post-Bond but pre-Untouchables, is probably the real saving grace of this film.  Whether smart-talking Lazarus (Sternhagen is also excellent), taunting Sheppard (Boyle does what he can with limited screen time), or staring dumbly at his wife's video message, Connery is one of the few actors who makes a credible action hero.  He gets hurt, he gets abandoned, he is left on his own to fight the mercenaries, whatever.  In the hands of a lesser actor, O'Niel would be generic, but Connery makes him human.

One more thing: bodies explode in this film (probably the only reason it was rated R).  You might think I'm telling you this as a warning, but it's also because it's physically impossible.

Overall, you should see the film at least once for its ambiance, but don't expect to be blown away.  Good performances and effects can't compensate for slow pacing and limited action.

On a scale of 1 to 10, this film gets a 6.

845080,4,630434063X,"Crime drama in outer space--inside a mining installation squatting on Jupiter's third moon, Io, to be exact.  The new Marshal in town, played by Sean Connery, actually arrives with a conscience (and a family that deserts him when the going gets tough, which is apparently right after the opening credits--but the conscience never deserts him) and when he tries to curtail the rampant use of a killer amphetamine that's being smuggled into the colony, it's pretty much him versus, well, everybody.  The mine's General Manager, Sheppard, played by Peter Boyle, rules with quiet arrogance and it seems that when he wants a minor inconvenience like O'Niel tagged and bagged, it's best to just step out of the way.

This film is assisted--over twenty-five years later--by four key elements:  Sean Connery, Peter Boyle, James B. Sikking, and Frances Sternhagen, not necessarily out of that order.  Two of those people don't have all that many scenes (Boyle is effective both in direct confrontation with Connery, and as an unseen controller of his many pawns; and I won't tell you who ends up strangled and bound in a locker), but all these actors slowly reveal their true characters to us as the tension mounts.  Sikking and Sternhagen, in supporting roles, each go through very different metamorphoses before the viewer's eyes, and both do wonderfully well at playing people who are not necessarily saying at all what they're thinking.

Special mention should go to Sean Connery, who probably doesn't get enough credit for the tight-lipped, stubborn but honourable old goat he plays in  this eerie, claustrophobic film.  One of my favourite Connery moments is when he gets home after a hard day's work only to be greeted by a video message from his wife explaining why she has taken the kid and abandoned him.  Connery's facial reactions to all the woman's comments say as much as any of his Untouchables rantings--feeling like a dope for not seeing it coming that morning (all the clues were there for him and the viewer); feeling anger and hurt; feeling truly alone; feeling like quiting the job and running after her.  But if a silent Connery doesn't work for you, he's got some great lines here, especially when trading dry wit with his one reluctant ally, Sternhagen as the crusty old doctor.

Meanwhile, the sets, the music, and the action sequences still maintain a vigorous pulse even today.  I wish O'Niel had had to do a bit more deducting rather than simply watching bad guys reveal themselves on monitor screens if you sit there monitoring them long enough, and I wish the writer/director had not made some things a bit too obvious well before they were officially revealed (the wife's planning to bail out being hinted at four different ways; lingering camera shots on faces turning from friendly to sinister at the end of scenes, as Connery walks away).  And I wouldn't have minded if there were SOME kind of a subplot to make the whole affair a bit less straightforward.  But the hectic chase through what seems to be the entire installation, ending in Connery sticking his hand in a boiling pot of liquid rather than let crucial evidence melt away (while the bad guy goes for the nearest knife),  was cool--as was the revelation of one final villain (unless the director tips you off on that surprise, too).

If you haven't seen this film, then it's a no-brainer: check it out.",1171584000,,3389,4.866086956521739
845081,3,630434063X,"It's a ramshackle little mining town. Everything is either the work, the bar, or the prostitutes. (For the prostitutes, it's the work or the bar, and that's work.) Then, as happens every year, a new marshall comes into town. The gang bosses let him know with lead-pipe subtlety who's in charge, but he's gonna stick by his star and his guns. That means the big showdown: hired guns come in on the next train - professionals. The word gets out, and his deputies cower. ""They're young, they have families."" Even the bar's cootchie dancers go into hiding. Then it's sawed-off shotguns at dusk, man against men. You know, the usual.

The time, the mining camp is on one of Jupiter's moons, as if that changes anything. The marshall is Sean Connery, the only reason for watching this drivel. I mean, this movie lost credibility faster than just about any I can remember: it had those space helmets with the lights conveniently pointed in so we can see who's there, night vision be darned.

Effects are mostly absent, by 21st century standards. Sets and models are good, in keeping with what they probably had to pay Connery even then. The story moves along well, and I really liked Lazarus (did I mention the rustic and humble but brave country doctor? Leonard McCoy, shove over). Connery's career had his debonair young man phase and is currently in his suave elder statesman phase. In between he went through the dumpies, epitomized by ""Zardoz."" This comes from the end of that unfortunate period, and is better for its distance from the worst of it.

845082,4,630434063X,"Though it was largely dismissed by critics and audiences when it was originally released in 1981, writer/director Peter Hyams' science fiction film OUTLAND has since gained a considerable cult following.  Much of that has to do with the notion that this is essentially a reworking of the classic 1952 western HIGH NOON set in outer space--or more specifically, on Jupiter's major inner moon of Io.

Sean Connery, who rarely gives a subpar performance in anything, more or less steps into the Gary Cooper role of a newly-appointed marshal at a mining operation on Io run by a corporation known as Con-Amalgamated.  When several miners start dying off in horrible ways, Connery begins to ask questions--which obviously doesn't sit well with Con-Am's chief (the late Peter Boyle).  With the help of the operation's sarcastic coroner (Frances Sternhagen), he manages to uncover the reason why: a powerful drug injected into the workers that makes them work twice as fast, and sooner or later turns them psychotic or suicidal.  When Boyle sends hired killers on a space shuttle to eliminate Connery from the scene, no one other than Sternhagen is willing to help, leading to the HIGH NOON-style showdown.

Hyams, who wrote and directed the 1978 sci-fi conspiracy film CAPRICORN ONE, and who would later direct the superb ""2010"" in 1984, does a fairly credible job here both as writer and director in depicting how such an outer space mining operation might go about, especially on a moon like Io which, by the time of OUTLAND's making, was known to be the most volcanically active body in our Solar System.  Much of the credit for this must go to special effects supervisor John Stears, who worked on the original STAR WARS and the fourth James Bond opus, 1965's THUNDERBALL.  The effects may seem plenty dated by the CGI standards of today, but they still work, even given some minor plot holes in them.  It also helps, however, to have the presence of Connery, in one of his best post-Bond roles, as the hero, ably matched by Boyle's steely villain role, a role not unlike the one that Henry Fonda essayed in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST (itself a film that also borrows a bit from HIGH NOON).

Though it may not be derivative, and is arguably a bit more violent than it really ought to be (hence the 'R' rating), OUTLAND still manages to deliver enough action and suspense to work.  This is a film in serious need of reassessment and a possible revival.",1170028800,3,2451,4.7706855791962175

But... watching it was like dragging fingernails over a blackboard. It jitters. It blurs. It hiccups. The color is bad.

The only other DVD I've ever run into that was even close to this bad was ""The Final Countdown""; I can't help but think this DVD is actually defective in some way, except for the fact that it plays continuously without any complaints from my hardware.

845125,3,630434063X,"THE BAD NEWS: Like other science fiction movies of its time, OUTLAND devotes lingering and loving shots to its now not-so-special effects. In 1981, the response may have been ""Wow! Look at that mining city! And look at those futuristic communication devices!""

But in the 21st century, one is plagued by thoughts like, ""Wow! Look at that model! And is that an Apple IIe masquerading as a futuristic communication device?"" Also, as pointed out elsewhere on this review page, this is one of the worst jobs of transferring a film to DVD I've seen.

THE GOOD NEWS: If you can turn off your inner voice for the first 20 minutes of this movie, once the plot kicks into gear, it's solid enough to keep you distracted. OUTLAND is notable for trailing right behind ALIEN in its portrayal of outer space as being home to gritty, industrial blue-collar workers, as opposed to the shining ""gee whiz"" future of STAR WARS. Sean Connery is in his prime here as a combination noirish lost soul/tough guy, and Frances Sternhagen is entertaining as a plainspoken frontier doctor.

SIDELIGHT: James Sikking and Sean Connery play some of the most unconvincing racquetball ever committed to film. Oh yeah, and set pieces from ALIEN were supposedly re-used for this movie.",1154563200,7,1250,4.859154929577465

845127,5,630434063X,"After leaving the James Bond franchise in 1971, Sean Connery gave a number of notable performances in films such as THE OFFENCE and THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING but OUTLAND is  really the film that  started him on the comeback trail that culminated in his Oscar acceptance speech 6 yrs later for The Untouchables. No one seems to recall this but at the time of OUTLAND's release, no one had seen or heard from Connery for a few years and most of the reviews, while not kind to the film for a variety of reasons--chief among them being the fact that most movie critics (at least back then) harbored serious prejudice against sci fi--the main comment was ""Its good to see Sean Connery back in action"".

This film has one of the best production designs ever. Obviously the look was copped from ALIEN--blue collar workers in space--but i am here to tell you that the whole look and feel of OUTLAND resonates for many reasons. I have never worked on an oil rig and i have never been in space but i did spend 7 yrs in prison and there were times when i would walk thru the institutions and look at the masses of unwashed humanity crammed into little metal cages and think, Jeez, this looks like something from OUTLAND.

Nothing special about the plot--but who cares? Sean Connery gives a splendid performance and the whole film moves at a nice clip. Very enjoyable.",1147910400,5,1356,4.5
845128,3,630434063X,"This movie came out during the Star Wars science fiction craze of the late 70s and early 80s.  This movie is kind of better than the very weird movie, Zardoz.  However, the science fiction and pure science of ""Outland"" feels dated.  It's not cheesy but is dated.  Dated is worse than cheese.  Why?  Dated means stale.  Cheese is timeless.

This movie is a direct copy of the old '50s western ""High Noon"" with Gary Cooper.  Instead of a western town it's set on a moon of Jupiter.  This movie was done before later space probes found that radiation levels in the Jupiter moon system would kill a human in a few days.  Io, where the movie is shot, is far too volcanic to support any type of settlement.  The problem with science fiction is it can be demolished with science fact.

The plot is bones simple.  Sean Connery comes to a space colony as a Federal Marshall.  His job is to enforce law and order.  During this time people start killing themselves in very gruesome ways.  Connery looks at the suicide rates on the computer system and figures that some sort of drug must be making people commit suicide.  He find this in an blood sample taken from a man killed committing a brutal rape.  The Marshall then goes after the drug dealers.  In the way the Marshall does his job he upsets the local plant manager.  The drugs does two things for the plant: it increases the productivity of the workers and makes them happier.  The only danger of the drug is it induces insanity after about a year of use.  Most of the time the workers go insane after they leave the mining colony.  Once in a while they go insane at the colony.  That is how it becomes the Marshall's problem.  The plant manager wants the Marshall killed and sends for a group of assassins to kill the Marshall.  Connery monitors the whole transmission.  Why the main government does not back up this Marshall is beyond this reviewer.  Our government, with all of its problems, still feels an assault on one officer is an assault on the whole government.  Why isn't the Marshall backed up by the central government is beyond the understanding of this reviewer.

""Outland"" really was not a bad pop-corn munching movie in 1980.  You saw it if the line for ""Star War 'Empire'"" was too long or if you had already seen ""Caddyshack"".  This science fiction movie is a nice grade ""C"".  Yes, it could have been better. However, it could have been far worse.  Remember ""Star Trek the Motion Picture""?  Conversely, it's a far cry from the chilling ""Alien"", perhaps one of the best movies from 1979.

Now, there is a nice part in the movie where the plant manager is playing golf in his office using a computer simulation system for a golf course.  Such a thing is now true.  I like to think this movie planted the idea for such a thing.

Personally, I would not buy this movie.  I would rent it from the video store if there was not much else to see.  Sean Connery does a great job.  Really, you can see how his star power helps this movie.  But this movie is very dated.  It's not borderline stupid, like some of the science-fiction is from the 1950s.  However, it was only grade ""C"" back in the days of Star Wars and Alien.  Star War and Alien are still very good movies; Outland has not been helped with the test of time.

All in all this movie isn't bad.  I've seen worse in Science Fiction.  Just four years later a ""Terminator"" comes to town and pure adrenalin hits the science fiction crowd.

Rent it but don't buy it.

I recommend this one to sci-fi fans who also enjoy a fairly good thriller.

845224,5,630434063X,"I went to see this movie at the theater when it came out.  I am not, by nature, a science fiction fan but the possibilities of ""Outland"" appealed to me.  I came away satisfied that my expectations had been exceeded.

The story is a futuristic ""High Noon""; the local law enforcement officer angers everyone when he enforces the law.  A hit squad of three men is coming in on the next spaceship.  Spaceship?  Well, this story takes place on a a moon of Saturn or Jupiter or something like that.  Actually it take place on an elaborate space station built for the miners who work on the moon.  They definitely need their entertainment, being so far away from home.  The cop, played by Sean Connery is there to keep things relatively under control.  However, bad things start to happen and he discovers the cause is a synthetic drug that more and more miners are taking.  When he cracks down, the drug peddlers look to eliminate him.  The eventual shootout is as good as that in ""High Noon"".

What I enjoyed the most about ""Outlook"" was the conception of the future.  Discoveries of different metals on distant celestial bodies lead to innovation in mining the metals.  What we see are space station mining camps and they resemble a sort of Buck Rogers at Sutter's Mill.  I thought the concept was interesting and I enjoyed the way the writer, director and all the special effects people worked it out.  I also enjoyed Connery's acting in the movie.  He gave the Gary Cooper cadence of the reluctant hero.

I mentioned that I am no big fan of science fiction and I think that may have helped me appreciate ""Outland"" more.  I gather through reviews I skimmed here that many did not care for ""Outland"" and I have no qualms with that.  However, I think if you take it with limited expectations, you'll discover a very good movie.",1118016000,3,1822,4.561728395061729
845225,5,630434063X,"Besides the great cast, detailed plot and good music, I really enjoy the feel of the setting.

Io is a harsh, terrible, place to live and mining is always hard on the workers.  The story shows us one future, mankind's guest for wealth and profit, even on one of the moons around Jupiter.

Sean Connery as William T. O'Neil is perfect - he is a flawed man, a father whose family don't want to live in a mining colony, a Marshal whose men refuse to help him, a law officer of a colony that is too scared to support him.  A Hero who does not know why he is a Hero.  The plot and the characters are in the foreground, as specil effects and designs are used to bring out the story, not overwhelm it.

845226,3,630434063X,"Firstly, the opening of this movie reminded me of 1979's ""Alien"", opening with the visually-emerging movie title followed by text explaining where the movie was taking place and why the characters were there.

Our hero, O'Neil (Sean Connery) has been sent to yet another lousy assignment because of his non-conformist ways.  And it is exactly those non-conformist ways that will identify him as our protagonist.

And, of course, one cannot have a protagonist without at least one or more antagonist(s).  The chief bad-guy is Peter Boyle leading a gang of ne'er-do-wells who drug up the local mining work crew (miner 49-ers?) so that they produce like crazed machines (ah, pervasive corporate greed without regard to human life a la ""Alien"").  Well, some things never change.

The Western feel is reinforced in many ways, replete with ""saloon doors"" which the marshall runs through after grabbin' a shotgun from the gunrack, some frontier justice and even the Ike Clanton-beard of James B. Sikking.  I reckon there's gonna be a shootout!

Of course the *really* bad guys are comin' in on the noon stagecoach (in this case it's the space shuttle from the space station).  I'm a big Sean Connery fan but Frances Sternhagen and James B. Sikking really help carry the film.

With that said, let's talk about a few of the problems.  For one, the marshall's kid is a casting mistake because he's just awful.  He looks 12 years old but talks like the 7-year old on ""The Rifleman"".  Whenever he's on screen, some of the most awkward dialogue takes place so that's a clue it's probably a good time to get up and get another Coca-Cola and some more Cheez-Its.  Also, Connery reaches into boiling soup to grab some drugs with his bare hand.  Yep, he gets burned, so one wonders why he didn't knock the boiling pot over with the shotgun?  Also, their space helmets have lights on the inside, which is roughly like turning on your dome lights, turning off your headlights and going for a midnight drive in your car.  Also, blasting their shotguns in the near-zero gravity would send them spinning like pinwheels.  But I digress...

And at the end, Connery is giving his farewell speech to Frances Sternhagen but is delivering his lines like a rank amateur.  It's so awkward you'll have to see and hear it to believe it (ex. ""Well, I have to go, now."").  C'mon Sean, you were a better actor than this.

So what have we learned?

1) There are no spiders on Io so don't freak out, they're not real.  (Dang varmints!)

2) Don't go outside without your space helmet.

3) This film gets 3.5 stars but there's no 1/2 rating.

4) No western is complete without at least one character named Flo.  Yer darn tootin', pardner!

See, out on Io (a moon of Jupiter), there's a titanium mining operation owned by some interplanetary mega-corporation. Federal Marshal William O'Niel (that's how it's spelled) gets assigned there and starts to investigate a series of odd deaths that don't seem to be murders but don't pass the smell test all the same. Getting almost no support from the mining station's personnel, O'Niel is on his own in uncovering the unpleasant truth behind the deaths. I won't tell you any more than that; what follows contains no spoilers.
The mind behind _Outland_ is Peter Hyams, who later brought us the excellent _Timecop_. But the movie benefits also from a wonderful ensemble cast. Sean Connery is, well, Sean Connery; he's worth watching as Bill O'Niel or as anybody else. Frances Sternhagen is delightful as the crusty and somewhat scatterbrained Dr. Lazarus (not the one from _GalaxyQuest_; she's an M.D. at the mining station). There are also the ever-reliable Peter Boyle and James B. Sikking, and a handful of other well-cast and competent supporting players. Since so much of the 'action' is dialogue and character interplay, it would have failed miserably with a lesser cast; here, it succeeds very well.
The special effects are pretty good too, particularly for 1981. The whole thing looks pretty dark and gritty, which wasn't the standard in 1981 but works much better today. At any rate, the mining colony looks right and not at all dated. (However, longtime SF geeks, of whom I am one, will have no trouble finding things to complain about, beginning with the inconsistent gravitational forces.)
The one real problem is that the plot stops developing before the movie is over. Once the reason behind the mysterious deaths is revealed, nothing further is uncovered; the plot settles into a simple _High Noon_ resolution that doesn't really take us anywhere new.
The DVD has other problems, too; as other reviewers have noted, the transfer to digital format isn't very good. It's watchable, but it's not crisp and clean and the sound occasionally gets muffled. (That's especially too bad with respect to Jerry Goldsmith's wonderfully dark and brooding score, which is brilliant in its own right as well as a perfect match with the movie.)
Still, it's well worth seeing and even owning. It's not as ambitious even as some of the other films of the early 1980s. But it's held up better than most of them.",1071964800,77,2583,4.940229885057471
845229,4,630434063X,"Director Peter Hyams appeared to have been inspired by the Western drama ""High Noon"" when he made this movie.  Indubitably ""Outland"" presents the ingredients of a cowboy movie.  The town is represented by a mineral colony on Io -a moon of Jupiter -in spite of the fact that they are in outer space and, if you go out, you might take the chance to explode your guts inside out because of the gravity.  The town's people don't help anybody who goes against the powerful conglomerate.  And then there is the sheriff in the body of Sean Connery.
Connery plays Marshal William O'Neill, a law man who believes in truth and justice in a ""town"" where those things are unaccounted for.  Unfortunately he goes against the powerful general manager of the mining corporation (Peter Boyle) under the suspicion that his company is giving some poweful drug to the workers who, later, end up dead.  The manager decides to hire assassins to have O'Neill killed, and the clock -just like in ""High Noon"" -is ticking.
This movie is quite a treat.  The claustrophobic settings are very adequate for the plot development.  However, this movie sometimes goes slow in the middle, but the suspense catches up with the viewer for the climax.

Nonetheless, the image quality is an annoying distraction which degrades the overall enjoyment of this finely done Sci Fi thriller.
If you must get this DVD, write to Warner Studios and tell them how lousy a job they did on this DVD transfer.  This film deserved much better attention to image quality. I am sure many of you would have screamed bloody murder if ""Alien"" had been so poorly done.
Warner needs to come out with an ""Outland SE"" to rectify this problem. ...",1056499200,5,885,4.617834394904459
845299,4,630434063X,"Released In 1981 this often overlooked film is a great exercise
in suspense and Intrigue. Sean Connery plays a rough honest federal marshall newly assinged the task of being a watch commander to the new regime  when he becomes determined to solve the bizzare murders of workers on a mining planet. Peter Boyle plays Connery's new boss who is in on a conspiracy to use the workers by injecting a dangerous substance in them to increase workers's produtivity ratios but the downside is that it eventuly makes the workers go beserk and go on a killing rampage. Connery is on to Boyle's scheme and sets out to stop him with a ruthless determination as the film goes on it plays like the classic western ""High Noon"" With the two leads playing oppiste sides of good and evil with great dramatic impact. This film deserved much better accaimed than it did when it was released. Connery was great and totally belvable in his portayal as a new man in a new world with a reputation of fighting the system his style and presence carried the film with great results. Outland is a great film that shocases a good storyline and proves That Sean Connery can act and go far beyond James Bond.",1048550400,,1176,4.57345971563981
845300,3,630434063X,"Peter Hyams' 1981 release of Outland starring Sean Connery and Peter Boyle leaves the viewer a bit disappointed.  The plot is not too deep and things move quickly without giving situations time to take root and develop.  It's as if the movie doesn't know which path to follow.  For example, subjects such as corporate greed and corruption, chemical abuse, O'Neil's relationship with family, and a good ol' good guy vs. bad guy scenario appears shallow having not been developed to a greater degree.
The viewer is left with little to hang on to as the movie just rolls right along.  The high point of the movie hits you before you feel as if much has happened, then is just not compelling enough.  Another story of thugs coming after the little guy trying to do the right thing.  On a personal note, this viewer had to wonder why the story even had to take place on Jupiter.  The storyline could have occurred anywhere because it is mainly aa cop/detective show.  Why must it take place on Jupiter?  Does  Hyams have a Jupiter fetish or was he just hungry to use some special effects (which were used pretty lightly, by the way)?  He later got his chance to play with Jupiter in his 1984 release of Arthur C. Clarke's sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey.
The characters in the movie are few, and one would expect that this would allow the movie to really delve into them, but again we are left short.  The characters are also thin and we do not get a chance to really get a feel for them but only on the surface.  The irony is that the character that we get to know the least is actually the main character, O'Niel, played by Connery.  In fact, in those rare circumstances where he does show emotion, he appears out of character.  The character that creates the greatest impression is the general manager of Con-Amalgamate, played by Boyle.  He does a good job at showing us that he is not such a great person and functions out of personal profit to himself.  The relationships in the movie are weak also.  We fail to realize the true struggle between O'Niel and his wife, and it is hard to feel emotion over his family struggles.
O'Neil's relationship with the doctor is also weak.  They nearly pair for a battle against the stronger forces, but this too fizzles out.  All in all, the characters are very two-dimensional and it is hard to bond with any of them.
Hyams had a good idea to begin with, but for whatever reasons, he failed to follow through.  What we are left with is a light movie that fails to really pull in the viewer.  This viewer was left disappointed.
Other than that, it was wasn't bad.",1032393600,,2602,4.479830148619958
845301,4,630434063X,"Director Peter Hyams and film legend Sean Connery make a powerful duo in the making of the film ""Outland,"" which can be described as ""High Noon"" in space. Very nice sets, a complex script and excellent fight scenes power this film about a police officer on a mining colony on a moon of Jupiter. Peter Hyams is at his best when he's directing sci-fi. His other credits in the genre include ""2010"" and ""Timecop,"" with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Connery proves once again that he's the best there was the best there is the best that ever will be... with apologies to Bret Hart.",1031270400,,570,4.543689320388349
845302,4,630434063X,"""Outland"" is truly an enjoyable film.  Sean Connery does an excellent job portraying William O'Neil, a Federal Marshall sent to one of Jupiter's moons to provide security for the mining colony on this moon.  Several apparent suicides begin to occur while O'Neil is performing his tour, so he begins to launch his own investigation to uncover the truth behind these suicides.  O'Neil finds out that a new drug is being administered to the miners so they can produce more output, but the drug's side effects cause the miners to go crazy and kill themselves.  When the general manager of the mining operation realizes that O'Neil has found out about this drug, he dispatches two paid assassins to kill O'Neil.  The suspense in the film mounts as O'Neil prepares to fight while the assassins are being transported to the mining colony.  The movie features good special effects and performances by the main actors, Sean Connery and Peter Boyle.  I definitely recommend this film to any sci-fi or action film fan, as well as anyone looking for a good suspenseful movie.",1028073600,2,1063,4.905027932960894
845303,5,630434063X,"I suspect the same reviewers who hate this movie would also dislike ""Andromeda Strain"" and ""The Abyss""
Some folks seem to think ""science fiction"" equates with ""action""
If you like intelligent, hard scifi for it's glimpse into a realistic possible alternate history then this movie (and the above mentioned) are for you. PS - only get the director's cut of Abyss, the one with the restored subplot which makes the movie make sense.
So what if Outlands story ""has been done"" or reminds you of ""High Noon""??  How many times can a story be rehashed in the same format?  ""Drug runners vs the law"" has been done countless countless countless times set in ""real world"" settings; it's refreshing and original to see it in a futuristic setting.
Also refreshing, the future not as a grand adventure but rather as just life as we know it, only with a few more gadgets and a couple of space stations ; )  Very very cool movie, bad DVD transfer notwithstanding.
One more counterquip:  sure some FX scenes are obviously using miniatures, but I could pose a similar criticism to most modern FX where they are ""obviously using CG"" - one is not necessarily worse than the other; they are simply obviously fake.  I look forward to the day when CG is so darn good that you really can't tell. (Episode 1 comes close in a few landscape shots, though fails at showing living creatures, except for the giant fishies).",1004659200,5,1394,4.650406504065041
845304,4,630434063X,"Okay, I've heard this film called uneven, poorly paced, and a slow retread of 100 different westerns that got by on the basics of the plot.  I've seen [people] praise the film for its supposed ties to the Alien franchise.  I've read the reviews from the die hard Sean Connery fans talking about how great he is in it, and offering that opinion up like his performance is the only saving grace of this film....  This is a good picture all on its own.
The pacing is excellent, the atmosphere created is tangible, and the setting is interesting and engaging.  The cast delivered here in a big way, and not just on Sean Connery's part.  Yeah, he is gives a good performance here, but I personally felt that the rest of the cast outshined him at moments and stole some key scenes.  I particularly enjoyed Frances Sternhagen as the company doctor here.  She begins with a character that is presented as fairly two dimensional and fleshed it out with her own flairs.  Peter Boyle is also noteworthy here.  This is a far cry from the dancing Frankenstein's monster in Young Frankenstein, and still further from his current primeime sitcom drivel.
The downside I will concede here is that people who enter into the film with a notion that this is an action flick are going to go away dissapointed, particularly those jaded by the last few years of 'summer blockbusters' that favored MTV style direction and Matrix level special effects over content and film making.  If that's what you want, I heard Swordfish is a nice DVD to own.
Leave this one to people who appreciate film as a story telling medium, and I think that this may well become a rediscovered treasure in the DVD collections of many.

Again, the movie is wonderful, but wait for a better transfer, with more extras.",1003622400,5,329,4.409836065573771
845306,3,630434063X,"This is an odd film - although released some time after 'Star Wars' it seems closer in spirit to the mid-70s wave of dystopian sci-fi flicks, combined with the look of 'Alien'. It's not particularly good, but it's entertaining and watchable - the kind of thing that, if you were swapping channels and you came across it, you'd probably watch the rest of it. Although everybody remembers this for the exploding people, it's still obscure enough to be a little bit culty (a bit like 'Saturn 3' which came out at the same time and was similarly old-fashioned). The effects and the general look'n'feel have worn quite well, although it's still odd seeing Sean Connery stomping around a fragile, pressurised mining base with a shotgun. Connery is, well, Connery, in his lengthy post-'James Bond', pre-'Untouchables' wilderness years (he'd just done the awful 'Meteor'). It was directed by Peter Hyams, who had just done 'Capricorn One' and was on the way to doing '2010'. Despite these three films Hyams is strangely obscure, not quite a star director. He's very much a technically-minded director, and 'Outland' seems as if more effort went into the sets (which are still quite striking) than the plot, which is essentially 'High Noon', and the script, which contains precisely no memorable lines. It's still fun, though.",993081600,,1317,5.018264840182648
845307,4,630434063X,"Io, one of Jupiter's moons, is probably as close to hell as the denizens of ""Outland"" will ever get.  Paid exorbitant sums to toil in indescribable conditions in Io's mines, the miner's need only a few months of their yearlong hitch to decide that they were fools to ever leave Earth.  US Marshals keep the peace, but nobody doubts that Io belongs to the mining combine - ""Con-Am""  (the same name used for the fictitious designer of the fatally flawed spacecraft in Hyams' earlier ""Capricorn One"".)  When bonus checks and prostitutes aren't enough to keep the miners happy, Con-Am's slippery manager (Peter Boyle) turns to illegal drugs.  The miners' suddenly work harder and boost production.  They also start killing each other and themselves.  One man cuts open his spacesuit convinced its full of spiders.  Another walks into an airlock without his spacesuit.  Director Peter Hyams so superlatively and convincingly creates the compartmentalized and pressurized hell of Io's colony, that it's hard not to imagine the whole thing teetering on the edge of explosive decompression.
When the rhiteous marshall (Sean Connery) decides to take Con-Am alone, even those who've never heard of ""High Noon"" may feel some deja vu.  Still, the duel of wits (and bullets) between Connery's marshall and the hired killers brought to get him out of the way creates enough tension to make up for that.",980726400,,1388,5.048245614035087
