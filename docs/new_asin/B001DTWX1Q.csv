8294880,4,B001DTWX1Q,"This is one strange, confusing, but ultimately interesting storyline.  The kind of plot that's intelligent, thought-provoking, and nonetheless moves the viewers like no other.  This defines Forfeit.  As a bonus, you get a free education in understanding how big businesses work along with an understanding in how the human mind can be smart, sincere, kind and yet, totally abnormal on the inside but completely normal on the outside.  There's quite a bit someone can learn from Forfeit.",1247875200,3,486,5.2727272727272725
