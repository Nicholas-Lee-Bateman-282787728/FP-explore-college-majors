8644940,5,B00ISAFEQY,Superb almost like being there. Could have been more film of the races.,1510876800,,71,4.538461538461538
8644941,1,B00ISAFEQY,"Sorry to say it was a total waste of money. I have gone to the air races in Reno for many years, but I couldn't even get through the whole video.",1489449600,,145,3.7096774193548385
8644942,5,B00ISAFEQY,"Superb quality images particularly when played on a 4K Blu- Ray player, these old restored War Birds look fantastic in the way they have been restored, a real treat. If I have to offer any criticism it would be that a bit more footage would have been welcome.",1475107200,,259,4.416666666666667
8644943,1,B00ISAFEQY,"Again, another bad movie for this event.",1464912000,,40,4.857142857142857
8644944,2,B00ISAFEQY,"Okay at best. There isn't much content for the price. They are clear about the (short) running time but the video doesn't go into very much detail about the planes, pilots, etc. It's more about planes flying in 3D than it is a documentary or informative about the Reno Air races. Maybe for $15., but overpriced as is.",1451260800,,317,4.482758620689655
8644945,3,B00ISAFEQY,Cool movie but way too short.  Great footage and high picture quality.,1436745600,,70,4.833333333333333
8644946,5,B00ISAFEQY,"Howdy;

I have to agree with the other two FIVE STAR reviews.  Not only is the 3D effects outstanding and the high def clear and bright, but the history was most interesting,

I definitely recommend this title to anyone interested in air racers, history or 3D.

8644947,5,B00ISAFEQY,"Love it, this is a great 3D filmed entertaining documentation video with many beautiful breathtaking stereoscopic real 3D scenes of airplanes in flight and on the ground, and I highly recommend it to all who love 3D like me. A movie in 3D well done, and not a computer generated video like fake ones I've seen from other companies. This is the real deal and well worth watching. It is narrated well and the video quality is also crisp and clean. A fun film for the whole family and for airplane enthusiasts. I give this one five stars all the way !",1416700800,,548,4.382352941176471
8644948,1,B00ISAFEQY,"This movie is embarrassing.  As a pilot myself, and a huge air-race fan, as well as a novice photographer, I really can't find a single thing about this movie to be happy about. It's choppy, dull, sloppily narrated, and the cinematography, while having the potential to be REALLY good, was full of novice, you-tube-esque errors such as water spotting that could have been edited or cropped out, as well as actual film flaws such as lines and grains in the picture, not to mention the amount of recycled footage, and worst yet, re-purposed footage from 40s pictures, that really lower this down to a high school film101 level rather than an iMax feature.  If the Air Races notices a pointed drop in new attendees, it's probably from all the people who were interested/curious/wanted to attend until they saw this film.

I feel a little sick that i paid $30 for the BluRay",1407024000,,870,4.7105263157894735
8644949,5,B00ISAFEQY,"Great 3d scene, Nice documentary about reno air races. But the movie is a little bit short.
Anyway if you like air racers buy it.",1401753600,,129,4.2
