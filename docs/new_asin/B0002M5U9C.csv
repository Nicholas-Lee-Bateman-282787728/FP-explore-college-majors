8029066,1,B0002M5U9C,"This DVD is NOT digitally re-mastered. There are two episodes on it; the first freezes and locks up on you and the second episode jumps around while playing. The quality is definitely not up to a re-mastered version. I do not blame the seller unless they knew about this; I blame the manufacturer for their misleading. I am throwing it away.

8029070,3,B0002M5U9C,Saw these episodes when I was 12 % 14. Stories good...Of course theme music great...many memories... video quality questionable.,1163030400,,128,5.7894736842105265
8029071,2,B0002M5U9C,First let me say that I love Ozzie and Harriet but this DVD is a major disappointment.  One of the shows is so grainy and blurry that it could pretty much only be listened to as it was hard on the eyes to view.  I hope in the future so see these shows digitally remastered and will check for that before purchasing any more DVDs of theirs.  I gave it two stars for the stories but it did not deserve more due to the quality of the DVD picture.,1157587200,8,443,3.955056179775281
8029072,3,B0002M5U9C,"This 2 episode DVD is really only 1 episode, since you can not watch the first episode. 'The Late Christmas Gift' which is from 1954 is so grainy that it is difficult to watch without getting eye strain or a headache! I was very disapointed to have spent the money on what I thought was 2 shows, and I could only watch the second episode from 1956. The one thing that makes this worth buying is a commerical by Ozzie & Harriet for the New York World's Fair (1965). Since I went as child, it brought back some found memories. Again let me stress the second episode is fine and very enjoyable. Even Ricky sings a Christmas song at the end, so it was not a total waste of money.",1136592000,23,675,4.2
