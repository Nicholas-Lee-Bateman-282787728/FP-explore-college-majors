8135588,5,B000H0M42U,"I collect Modern Marvel episodes and this is one of my top 3 favorites (St. Louis Arch, Golden Gate Bridge other 2). Super mind blowing to think of what they did, where they did it, and how they did it. Excellent story telling and footage.",1438128000,,239,4.333333333333333

8135592,5,B000H0M42U,"Being an engineer who has designed dams and is quite familiar with the story of Hoover Dam, I didn't expect to gain much from this video, but figured I'd give it a shot anyway.  I'm glad I did, because they did an excellent job with this!

You can only cover so much in ~45 minutes, and I would have liked more attention paid to the design of the dam, but they still made excellent use of the time and went into enough depth to meet the needs of everyone other than dam engineers and specialized historians.  And even the latter two audiences will benefit, because the historical footage of the dam construction is excellent and irreplaceable.

Highly recommended to all audiences, young and old, generalist and specialist.  Watch this to learn about one of the great engineering and construction achievements of the 20th century.",1336521600,12,830,4.736111111111111
8135593,5,B000H0M42U,"I have driven across, and gone down inside Hoover Dam many times..This film shows how it was made..And inside it is still clean enough to eat off the floors..It was well designed, and made by good ol' American ingenuity and sweat..And no,,there are no bodies buried in it..It is hard to bury a body in a 5' deep form of concrete. Several workers died in its construction, from heat related causes, and falls..This is a great movie of a great American iconic project.",1335139200,10,466,4.626506024096385
