8375583,5,B002NXSTHI,I loved Honey and Clover. It is a real life college drama. It is centered around 5 art students. It follows them through freshman year to graduation. The animation in this series is one of a kind. I've never seen an anime that was animated like this. All of the characters are very compelling and unique. The drama and comedy is amazing as well. I fell in love with this series from the minute I started watching it. If you like anime You can't miss it.,1350345600,,453,4.27906976744186

8375585,5,B002NXSTHI,"First of all there is not much to say other then this and Box 1 are both great and anyone who likes this kind of anime should own this series.

Second AMAZON LIES!! This is English Dub. I was sad and wondering why box 1 was English dub and Box 2 was not, when it arrived at my house I was happy to see that indeed it is dubbed and Amazon was mistaken in saying it is Japanese only.

I do really enjoy subtitled anime but only if there is not an English dub version, it is also nice to have a choice in case  I do not feel like reading.",1262822400,5,535,3.8018018018018016
8375586,4,B002NXSTHI,"This set of Honey and Clover maintains the tone of the first set.

As it begins, Shinobu's departure sends both Yuta and Hagu reeling, their reactions as complicated as money-hungry, generous Shinobu himself.  Meanwhile, Takumi finds that he can't have his cake and eat it too when Ayumi starts dating and his decision not to be part of her love life means that he doesn't get to have a say in it.

As those following the series already know, anyone wanting a fast-paced, action-packed story will be disappointed.  What Honey and Clover excels at is depicting the pace of everyday life and the interweaving of the Yuta/Hagu/Shinobu and Ayumi/Takumi plots, perhaps on best display in a wonderful little scene between Shinobu and Ayumi.  With the exception of some of Shinobu's wilder antics (his reappearance is a comedic classic), much of the series is strikingly realistic; from the job hunts of the older members of the gang to Ayumi's reaction to her Takumi dilemma and Takumi's tightrope walking attempt at turning Ayumi down while still trying to remain close friends with her - all with Yuta remaining the heart and soul of the series as it's narrator as well as a participant.

Although it may not get the attention of flashier series, Honey and Clover continues to deserve notice as one of the best slice-of-life anime.",1262131200,,1327,4.875555555555556
