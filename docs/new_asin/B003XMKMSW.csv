4218128,5,B003XMKMSW,"A great gift for any ufc fan. It includes some of the top fights the heavyweight division has given us. All fights are full length and most of them end by knockout, submission, etc. 40 fights 20 bucks...its a no brainer!",1294876800,,220,4.390243902439025
4218129,4,B003XMKMSW,"You get exactly what is promised on this dvd but if you are like me and own the best of 2008, 2009, and 2010 when it comes out along with ultimate knockouts 1-8 then probably over half of these fights you will already have on dvd.  If you are only going to buy one dvd you would probably be better off with the best of 2009 dvd unless you just really like heavyweights over the lighter classes.",1293408000,,394,4.116883116883117

4218131,5,B003XMKMSW,"I own this on Blu ray, and let me tell you if you love watching hard hittin' action then this dvd/blu ray is a must have. It's packed with a punch! nothing but the best action and knockouts showcasing the best in the heavyweight division. If you buy the blu ray there's even more fights then the dvd version and this is one release from the UFC that doesn't disappoint.",1291680000,,369,4.285714285714286
4218132,5,B003XMKMSW,"Well I got this 4 days ago from my local F.Y.E. It wasn't until that night that I realized that it actually comes out tomorrow and that someone at F.Y.E must have messed up and put a copy on the shelf.

I must say, as more of a fan of Light Heavyweights and Middleweights, this set is awesome. It's only 1 disc and doesn't have any real features (unless you count the ""extra"" fights),but it's content is worth the $20 I paid for it. None of the fights go to a decision, which makes this an exciting compilation for a newer UFC fan or someone who loves watching people drop or tap. The best part in my opinion is the addition of a few Fight Night and UFC on Versus fights never before released on DVD.

The ""20 Full Fights"" in the program are accompanied by a brief setup and are as follows:

Tim Sylvia vs Frank Mir from UFC 48
Cro Cop vs Gabriel Gonzaga from UFC 70
Brock Lesnar vs Frank Mir from UFC 81
Christian Wellisch vs Shane Carwin from UFC 84
Fabricio Werdum vs JDS from UFC 90
Randy Couture vs Lesnar from UFC 91
Big Nog vs Mir from UFC 92
Gabriel Gonzaga vs Shane Carwin from UFC 96
Brock Lesnar vs Frank Mir from UFC 100
Tim Hague vs Todd Duffee from UFC 102
Randy Couture vs Big Nog from UFC 102
Roy Nelson vs Brendan Schaub from the Ultimate Fighter 10 Finale
Frank Mir vs Cheick Kongo from UFC 107
JDS vs Gilbert Yvel from UFC 108
Big Nog vs Cain Velasquez from UFC 110
JDS vs Gabriel Gonzaga from UFC on Versus *
Frank Mir vs Shane Carwin from UFC 111
Roy Nelson vs Stefan Struve from UFC Fight Night *
Cro Cop vs Pat Barry from UFC 115
Brock Lesnar vs Shane Carwin from UFC 116

The ""Bonus Material"" consists of 10 bonus fights, 5 ""classic"" and 5 modern day, in their entirety as well.

The ""Bonus Fights"" are:

Frank Mir vs Brandon Vera from UFC 65
Frank Mir vs Antoni Hardonk from UFC 74
Cain Velasquez vs Jake O' Brien from UFC Fight Night *
Shane Carwin vs Neil Wain from UFC 89
Brendan Schaub vs Chase Gormley from UFC on Versus *

The ""Classic"" fights are:

Tank Abbott vs Joun Matua from UFC 6
Don Frye vs Thomas Ramirez from UFC 8
Mark Coleman vs Dan Severn from UFC 12
Randy Couture vs Tony Halme from UFC 13
Vitor Belfort vs Tank Abbott from UFC 13

So you get alot of bang for your buck and it's well worth the purchase.

* denotes a fight never before released on dvd

If you do -- you might want to re think if you're an MMA fan. lol  It shows tons of finishes, from submissions, to the good o' fashioned caveman knock out. lol It has alot of back story, and just over all is a great mix to add to your collection!

- All the fights are exciting, suspensful and bloody. There is no pause, no boredom from the beginning till the end. It's much better than the other UFC dvds. Those disc are a mix of spectacular and boring fights.

The other best disc is UFC 121. The fight between Lesnar and Velasquez alone is already worth the cost of the dvd. It also has other interesting fights.",1298073600,3,419,4.428571428571429
