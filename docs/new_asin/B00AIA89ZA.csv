5425886,5,B00AIA89ZA,"I have to comment that as a child in the early 1960's, I watched Mr. Chase's shorts on my local TV station so they were around but I have not seen them since that era. I enjoyed the films included, especially The Heckler, as they are a nice adjunct to The Three Stooges series by Columbia. If Sony is reading this, please release the remaining Chase films and I would like to also see Andy Clyde's series released to the public. I enjoyed his comedies, too, when they were televised. Thanks,Sony, for releasing these and other classic comedies.",1372982400,5,544,4.561224489795919
5425887,4,B00AIA89ZA,"Different from his best work at Roach studios, these Columbia shorts have always been hard to access. Finally, here are some, from gorgeous 35mm transfers! Very entertaining! And a rare Smith and Dale short directed by Chase! (Smith and Dale were the inspiration of Neil Simon's Sunshine Boys) Beware- it took me 3 attempts to receive a disc that played!",1361404800,6,354,4.916666666666667
5425888,5,B00AIA89ZA,"Thanks to Sony/Columbia for at last making these great two-reel comedies available to we Chase fans. His comedy approach is well documented here, with such great ones as ""The Heckler"" and a Smith and Dale which Chase directed. By all means get this DVD and let Sony know that we want Volume Two!",1360972800,3,295,4.584905660377358
5425889,5,B00AIA89ZA,"Charlie Chase is not a household name yet, but he may soon be. Long championed by critics such as Leonard Maltin, Chase's work was out of circulation for many years. But within the last year, he has gotten two DVD releases: ""Cut to the Chase"", a collection of his best silents, and the Columbia ""Charlie Chase Shorts - Vol 01"". Now we can see why his boosters were so enthusiastic. Both of these DVDs are filled with comic gems. I heartily recommend this set, and I will definitely pre-order Vol-02 as soon as it becomes available.",1359158400,2,531,4.541666666666667
5425890,5,B00AIA89ZA,This is a wonderful and charming selection of Columbia comedy shorts by the very talented Charley Chase. Not as inventive as his earlier work for Hal Roach but still quite funny. These films deserve to be rediscovered. Picture quality is excellent. Volume two please?,1358812800,3,267,5.090909090909091
5425891,5,B00AIA89ZA,"Here it finally is! CHARLEY CHASE SHORTS - VOL. 1 is a great showcase of this great comedian's work at Columbia Pictures. One of comedy's legends, Charley Chase was a polished film comedy star who began work in the 1910's, and finally landed at the Hal Roach Studios in the early 1920's. He left there in 1936 and landed at Columbia, where he starred in his own series of two-reelers 1937-1940. Like many of Columbia's shorts other than those of the Three Stooges, most of these have been (and many still are) difficult to see and not available on DVD or on TV. Now, Sony has done a meticulous job in saving and preserving the Charley Chases. These transfers are gorgeous! In addition to 8 of Charley's starring shorts, Sony has included ""A NAG IN THE BAG"", directed by Chase and starring Smith and Dale. This is a must have for fans of classic comedy!!",1358035200,6,853,4.509677419354839
5425892,5,B00AIA89ZA,"This is the long-awaited set of two-reel comedies starring Charley Chase, probably the most underrated funnyman of the 1920s and 1930s. Chase specialized in the comedy of embarrassment; his screen character would become embroiled in a misunderstanding, and spend the rest of the film innocently but amusingly proceeding on the wrong assumption. This formula had served him well since the silent-movie days, and by 1938 -- when this set begins -- he adapted it to the faster-paced, slapstick-oriented comedy unit at Columbia Pictures. He starred in 20 comedy shorts for Columbia; this collection includes eight, plus one that he directed.

The director of most of these shorts is Mack Sennett/Three Stooges veteran Del Lord. Chase contributed some of the gags and even entire screenplays to the series, and both Lord and Chase reached back to their silent-era shorts for surefire comedy ideas. Through most of this set Charley is a victim of circumstance. His ""reconditioned"" car falls apart on him in RATTLING ROMEO; he doesn't recognize his wife when she goes blonde in THE CHUMP TAKES A BUMP; he hosts a disastrous dinner party in SOUTH OF THE BOUDOIR; he's an expert on marital problems who has troubles himself in MAN BITES LOVEBUG. In the one radical departure from his usual pleasant persona, he's an obnoxious sports fan who makes life miserable for players and spectators alike in THE HECKLER. Most of these funny situations were strong enough that Columbia could refilm them years later with other stars, but not with the signature Chase charm.

You'll notice that by 1938 Chase was a little too old to play the boy next door opposite college-aged starlets, but he projects the same young-man-about-town personality. Chase's vis-a-vis here is usually Ann Doran, whose plain-Jane looks and demeanor (and enthusiastic performances) are a welcome change from the uninspired glamour girls drafted from the studio's stock company. The supporting casts are filled with familiar faces from the Three Stooges comedies: Vernon Dent, Bud Jamison, John Tyrrell, Richard Fiske, Bess Flowers, etc. Stooge director Jules White had no hand in these eight Chase shorts, so there is much less of the standard slapping-around, pants-on-fire, knocked-out-cuckoo slapstick typical of White's Columbia shorts.

If there's one problem with these engaging shorts, it's that they sometimes end before we want them to. Director Lord sets up a comic situation, builds up the complications, and often just calls things to a halt when the two reels are up. Sometimes the films end on a cute note: RATTLING ROMEO concludes with a marriage proposal. Other films screech to a stop with no real payoff (THE HECKLER has Charley held at gunpoint, and suddenly the screen goes dark!).

Charley Chase was himself a talented director, and this set includes as a bonus the 1938 Columbia short A NAG IN THE BAG, starring vaudeville's Joe Smith and Charlie Dale, and directed by Chase. This one has lots of laughs, as drive-in restaurant owners Joe and Charlie get gambling fever and try to win big at the race track. Director Chase balances their strength as dialect comedians with Columbia's broad visual gags, so the comedy is physical but not violent (Joe and Charlie tangled in a phone booth with burly Bud Jamison, for example). Listen for a cameo by Mr. Chase: his voice is heard on the telephone, on a car radio, and as the racetrack announcer!

Print quality throughout is superior, restored by Sony's Grover Crisp from glowing 35mm materials. UPDATE: You'll find the other 12 Chase comedies in Volume Two, also sold by Amazon.

Charley Chase and the Columbia shorts have quite a large following among vintage-comedy fans, and these comedies are great fun to watch. Highly recommended.",1357689600,25,3763,5.10064935064935
5425893,5,B00AIA89ZA,"First, let's get this out of the way:  Charley Chase's Columbia shorts are not nearly as good as his comedies done for Hal Roach.  BUT - Chase's Columbia shorts are prime examples of how a comedian working under one studio for nearly two decades is able to adapt himself to another studio with an entirely different style of comedy and picture making.  At the time Chase was hired by Jules White, Columbia was the home of The Three Stooges, Andy Clyde, Collins and Kennedy, Walter Catlett (a casual contributor), Harry Langdon (another Roach veteran, as well as Mack Sennett) and try-out series such as Polly Moran, Guinn Williams and Franklin Pangborn.  Chase was a double terror as he was a fine director as well as a seasoned comedian.

His first several shorts for Gower Gulch are not presented here.  The cache begins with MAN BITES LOVE BUG and presents eight comedies made between 1937 and 1940, when Chase died of a heart attack at the age of 46 (alcohol had taken a deadly toll).

The shorts are presented in impeccable 35mm materials with only slight noise reduction done to the typically splendidly recorded Columbia soundtracks.

The welcome bonus on this set is the Chase-directed short A NAG IN THE BAG starring the veteran vaudeville team of Joe Smith and Charlie Dale.

This is a bare bones presentation, but Sony/Columbia has long been lobbied to release the Chase shorts so I suppose being crowbarred into putting out the shorts was enough without ""getting fancy about it"".  Hopefully the response in sales will inspire some extras in subsequent volumes, including some commentary tracks by Chase and Columbia Comedy scholars.  As Chase made only 20 starring shorts at Columbia, there is ample room to include the shorts he directed for other comedians (his Stooges shorts are, of course, already and readily available!).

This is a great set.  Don't hesitate to buy it.",1357603200,20,1888,4.8808777429467085

8551925,1,B00AIA89ZA,"Although some might regard it as a bit ""hokey"", Charlie Chase's humor is guaranteed to put a smile of the faces of many viewers fortunate to obtain this volume of his shorts.

8551929,5,B00AIA89ZA,"I went into this with quite a bit of trepidation.  After seeing what happened to Buster and Langdon at Columbia, I was afraid that these would be painful.
Not only are they not painful, THEY ARE EXCELLENT.
I have both collections and there are some very, very funny shorts here.  They are different than the Roach Classics, but Chase had some control over most of these, I believe, so they came off quite well.
Everybody talks about the top 3 silent comedians.  They never include Chase.  I think I reluctantly agree.  However, Chase and Langdon are surely in the top 5.  Maybe Lloyd Hamilton would round out at #5, but I have not seen enough of his work.  There's also Linder, Arbuckle, Charley Bowers, and a few others who consistently did top quality work.
And consider this. After sound came in, who would remain in the top 3?  Chaplin, surely.  Lloyd?  Yeah, I guess so.  But Buster (who is my choice for #1 of all time in the silent era) couldn't be included.
Now think of those Charley Chase Roach sound films and then these.  I think Chase is #2 right under Chaplin.  It's arguable, but not out of the question.",1413763200,2,1119,4.507462686567164
8551930,5,B00AIA89ZA,"Why should such a gifted comic artist like Charley Chase be almost forgotten today? Probably because he stuck to shorts and never really tackled feature films. And if that's the case, it's a sorry excuse. Chase, who had humble beginnings at Keystone Studios as a bit player (at least he rubbed elbows with greats Charlie Chaplin, Mabel Normand & Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle) and later expanded his talents at Hal Roach Studios, really hit his stride with the advent of talkies. Chase's comic style was firmly embedded in what is known today as ""situation comedy"", so the while his silent shorts were good, the addition of dialogue helped deepen his appeal on screen. Somewhat dapper & slender in appearance, Chase portrayed the typical everyman of situation comedies. Oh sure, his character was quite a brighter than say, Laurel & Hardy or The Three Stooges (which he got to work with both teams). But naturally, his character always managed to get up to his ears in trouble. He had impeccable comedic timing, making him supremely talented as both a verbal & visual comedian.
Luckily, Chase is finally getting his due, thanks to the two-volume DVD collection created by Sony Pictures. At a point in his career when other comics were winding down, Chase had the good fortune to actually excel in his latter years at Columbia Pictures. His comic style worked surprisingly well within the framework of Columbia, in which he stayed in command of his work, whether co-producing or occasionally directing; compare this to the sad stories of such great clowns as Buster Keaton or Harry Langdon who were at the mercy of the studio system and were told to either perform according to what was written for them or else.
Each and every short presented here is a little gem. Chase was also ably supported by such Columbia stock players as leading lady Ann Doran or foil Bud Jamison (the latter often seen in The Stooges shorts).
Looking forward to Volume 2!",1399766400,2,1941,4.849397590361446
8551931,5,B00AIA89ZA,"DVD arrived today perfectly sealed. Films are crystal clear, and Charley is as funny as ever. Charley is supported by some of the Three Stooges' supporting actors in these funny and clever two-reelers.",1396310400,,201,5.121212121212121
8551932,5,B00AIA89ZA,"Even though this is a bare-bones package, these shorts are a real pleasure to watch. Charley Chase's work has been neglected for too long, so it's great to have these films available in such beautiful condition. Hats off to Sony for making these sets available. I'd love to see Andy Clyde's and Harry Langdon's Columbia shorts on DVD too. And if we could only get more of Charley's films from the Hal Roach studio in wider release!",1391212800,,431,4.6103896103896105
8551933,5,B00AIA89ZA,"Columbia Pictures may not have offered the cream of Charley Chase's comedy film shorts, but the studio certainly had a flavor of their own. From Hugh Herbert, Vera Vague and The Three Stooges, hits and misses, these are certainly worth watching. Sony Entertainment now owns the films and your purchase of this DVD will send a message to the studio: WE WANT MORE! You see, if the disc does not sell well, there will not be a volume two. I could be picky and complaint they are not in chronological order but who cares? As long as future volumes come along the world gets more perfect. From an inside source I know that just because it says ""Volume One"" does not mean there is definitely a volume 2 coming.

The best of the shorts is ""The Heckler"" (1940), considered one of the two best comedy shorts Charley Chase made at the studio. It was later remade with a different cast (Shemp Howard in the lead) and re-titled for a later Columbia comedy short but this one is the better of the two. So do your part and buy it today.",1374105600,4,1022,4.378947368421053
8551934,4,B00AIA89ZA,"With the glorious exception of ""The Heckler,"" the Charley Chase two-reelers for Columbia do not equal his best work for Hal Roach. However, most of the 1937-40 shorts remain enjoyable comedies in their own right. Among the highlights in this Sony DVD are ""The Chump Takes a Bump,"" ""Rattling Romeo,"" ""The Awful Goof"" and ""South of the Boudoir""  all directed by Del Lord, who tones down the slapstick to emphasize Charley's situational humor. Were it not for Chase's untimely death, the Columbia series would have continued indefinitely.",1373328000,3,535,5.149425287356322
