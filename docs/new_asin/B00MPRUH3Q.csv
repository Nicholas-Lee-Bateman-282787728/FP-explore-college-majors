With that said though, i think the main subject of the DVD (counterpoint/guitar polyphony) is really interesting and well worth a thorough look, especially if you're into Gilad's playing in general. He shows a lot of exercises with scales and explains really good and he also leaves alot of suggestions for you creating your own exercises.
Although the counterpoint thing seems like a big part of Gilads playing i personally feel like i wanted a little bit more. Don't get med wrong i really liked what he talked about, and i am working on it myself as we speak, but a little bit more would be nice.

Another thing which i think is nice is that Gilad talks alot about how he approaches practicing things and he actually play some wrong notes in the video and explains how he go about that when he is practicing. He also talks about ""getting in the zone"" and also the importance of always having good focus when you're playing (both in the practice room and playing live) which i think is an important thing to be reminded of (at least for me). On that subject he also leaves suggestions and exercises.

As for the production of the DVD goes it is TOP NOTCH. It really shows that the team at jazzheaven has put down a lot of work with this. Filming and audio couldn't be better. 5 stars.
All in all a very nice DVD! If you're into Gilad's playing i would definitely recommend you to buying it.",1437696000,,1651,4.533557046979865
8673839,5,B00MPRUH3Q,"This lesson provided great insight into the mind and philosophy of Gilad Heksleman, from both his perspective as a player and person, which actually strike me as one and the same. Gilad opens up your mind to the creative process of developing your own voice through discovering different tonal colors using various exercises that he applies to his own development, but continually reminds the listener that this was how he did it, but not necessary what will work for you, so the material should just be used as a source of musical possibility for determining what will work for you; some of which may come directly from his own exercises or another exercise you develop on your own. Even if I don't get a lot of time to spend on his particular exercises, just receiving confirmation that I am on the right track, was worth the time and money, and I really will try to practice some of his individual approaches.......there are just so many other combinations of variables I'm working on putting together that, as Gilad says, ""you have to pick and choose what you like, because the combinations are infinite"" Maybe not a direct quote, but that is his point.",1434931200,2,1157,4.732673267326732
8673840,4,B00MPRUH3Q,"Great video where Gilad is dealing with his approach to counterpoint. Showing exercises on scales, talking about the importance of hearing both lines, the use of different note values and polyrhythms.
He also talks about the master J.S. Bach and his approach to one of his inventions. He shows his use of voice leading in Look for the silver lining, totally inspiring.
He also emphasize that this will not only improve you ability to play counterpoint but also your focus and concentration, to be and stay in the zone. Can really recommend this one.",1426291200,,549,4.851063829787234
8673841,3,B00MPRUH3Q,"First off, Gilad is one of a handful of top young players(along with Kriesberg,Lund,) in the world. This production is extremely well done. Crystal clear video. When I listen to him live or on record I am struck mostly by his great phrasing and legato playing on an instrument and with strings normally not associated with lots of hammer ons and pull offs. The counterpoint thing he goes over here might have worked if he had some kind of system or approach that a student could work from. Basically, I feel you are on your own with this material after watching this video in its entirety . He could have talked about how he approaches learning standards or how he approaches composing and I would have likely found that more interesting but maybe not. Perhaps teaching is not his  forte. I get a sense that  he has a very idiosyncratic and non methodicial approach to learning new things which works for him because the results are stellar. It just doesn't work for me.",1421280000,4,970,4.601156069364162
8673842,5,B00MPRUH3Q,"I ordered this DVD that it seems like I have been waiting DECADES since it was first announced as ""coming"" (OK, not ""decades....."") and it came in the mail this morning. I took Gilad's advice and just looked at the first chapter. He suggests not going thru the whole thing but look at it one bit at a time and absorb it like that. Even after just the first chapter, I can say that it is WELL worth every penny; the audio and video quality is astounding, crystal clear and extremely well done. The PDF, done by my good pal, Quentin Angus (a pleasant surprise to see) is in beautiful, clear type, easy to read and to follow; the material is clear, challenging, and its refreshing to see how often Gilad screws up!!!! He just says so and says, ""let me do it again"". One of his mistakes led to a counterline he had not prepared!!!!  LOL!!! I love it!!! This one is so well done that as soon as the Finance Minister will allow, I'm gonna get the Lage Lund one too. HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommended.",1411171200,5,987,4.306451612903226
