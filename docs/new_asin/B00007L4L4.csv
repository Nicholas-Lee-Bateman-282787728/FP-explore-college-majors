7977669,5,B00007L4L4,I love this DVD. This DVD has the most character development on it of all the DVDs currently available. There still is plenty of action though so don't worry. The 3rd episode on this DVD is my favorite. Its packed with great action and story. Plus this DVD sets up the next one perfectly and will make you want to buy Round 6.,1049241600,,326,4.190476190476191
