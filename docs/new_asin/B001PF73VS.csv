8333190,4,B001PF73VS,"I rented this on YouTube and I'll likely purchase the DVD. Cherylll combines shopping with sightseeing (it's roughly 60% shopping, 40% sightseeing). In this episode, she heads to Copenhagen. Copenhagen is one of the friendliest cities in the world. It's not as popular as London or Paris (Cheryll should film some episodes there), but you'll have a good time if you visit Copenhagen.

The other day, I watched Cheryll's Tokyo episode and I found her to be a bit of a diva. In this episode, however, she was much more pleasant. I also must say that she is quite attractive for an older woman. This episode showed many of Copenhagen's popular attractions, including the Little Mermaid statue, the iconic Tivoli Gardens amusement park, Thorvaldsen Museum, and the Changing of the Guards ceremony. She also rode the water taxi.

She visited a bakery and a candy shop where she enjoyed hot cocoa, cookies, and licorice (I'm perplexed as to how she maintains her figure). This episode was not quite as in-depth as Rick Steves' Copenhagen episode, but it's still quite enjoyable.",1399766400,,1072,4.95
