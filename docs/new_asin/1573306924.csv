7798125,1,1573306924,I was so disappointed with this. It's so dated and not in a good way. 90% of the visuals look like filler and it's all hyper edited in the most annoying way. Like their trying to make up for the under achieving material by over editing it.,1502236800,,239,4.1063829787234045

7798128,3,1573306924,"As a longtime fan of the Mind's eye series, I enjoyed this. As a watcher, I was sort of creeped out. A lot of the material is somehome psychologically unsettling. I can't put my finger on why, but parts struck me as nihilistic and abstract, very unlike the uplifting feeling brought on by the other videos. You can buy it if you want. Just be careful.",1356912000,,351,4.333333333333333
7798129,3,1573306924,"I have all of the Odyssey Productions videos and this is by far the worst. It's very similiar to the early X-MIX series. It's more of a screensaver than something you'd sit in front of and watch for a half hour. Don't buy this unless you're like me and need to complete your collection. I reccomend this to you instead:

Cyberscape
The Gate to the Mind's Eye
Odyssey Into the Mind's Eye (although I hated the music)
Beyond the Mind's Eye
Imaginaria (not just for kids!)
The Mind's Eye",1281398400,,484,4.438202247191011
7798130,2,1573306924,"all i can say is that ""The Gate:to the mind's eye"" is the best computer animation trip i have ever experienced still to this day in 2009 and it was made in 1994. Thomas Dolby does a score to the film that's half trance and half Pink Floyd sounding. It is by far the best film and soundtrack out of all of the mind's eye series. This Turbulence is okay during one scene which is really trippy, but it's very very short and altogether i was unhappy when it was over. I'd like to compliment anyone who had anything to do with the making of it though. It did take some talent to make i'll give it that. Just poorly arranged and should not be sold in stores in a box with art on the cover. someone made alot of money on this back in the day and it just doesn't hold a candle to the 1994 one i was talking about.",1253577600,,806,3.9814814814814814
7798131,3,1573306924,"AS A DISC JOCKEY I'M ALSO LOOKING FOR GREAT GRAPHICS
TURBULENCE IS SHORT IT'S ONLY 28 MINUTES. WHICH WILL MAKE THE GRAPHIC SHORT, WAS PLEASED WITH SOME GRAPHICS, SOME GRAPHICS I WISH WOULD BE LONGER. SOUNDTRACK DID NOT DO ANYTHING FOR ME.",1238457600,,238,4.690476190476191
7798132,3,1573306924,"I bought this video in the VHS format, and I'm glad I did not spend extra for the DVD, though I tried to find it on laserdisc.  Great computer amination, but it was too short compared to other computer animation titles in the mind's eye series.  Portions of Turbulence had already been presented in Beyond the Mind's Eye and Oddessey to the Mind's Eye, but with different music.",1156291200,,378,4.544117647058823
7798133,5,1573306924,"One of the better CG videos out there. My only contension is it could have been a little longer, maybe 50 min or an hour. 30 min is too short. The music was very diff from other CG DVD's of the past. Very tranqull. Relaxing to watch.",1017273600,5,233,3.978723404255319
7798134,5,1573306924,"I must disagree with the previous reviewer. I have seen all of the titles in the Mind's Eye series and in my opinion this is the best. I enjoyed the others but this was a breath of fresh air. Do not buy this dvd expecting  realistic animated characters or enviroments. If this is what you like try  the first three Mind's Eye productions. Rather, this dvd presents some very  imaginative and engaging abstract animations. Eye candy, at its best. Not  all of the chapters have musical scores. Those which do fit well with the  imagery. The remaining are layered with soundscapes and voices which  brought the visuals to life and set this disc far apart from the others I  have seen. The last chapters play like a resume but a top notch one from an  innovative artist. All in all I enjoyed Turbulence more than any computer  animation video I have watched.",956361600,19,854,4.565789473684211
