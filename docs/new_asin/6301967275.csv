388604,5,6301967275,This is the best movie ever,945993600,,27,3.6666666666666665
388605,5,6301967275,"With all the classic remakes of this most classic of Christmas stories, this 1938 version is still the best.  Reginald Owen is a magnificent actor who must never be forgotten.  He captures Dickens' Scrooge in a performance  that is technicolor ... even in black and white.  Supporting actors are  vivid, the script is a perfect cinematic adaptation of the book and changes  made for this screen story only serve to enhance the total experience.  I  have seen this film dozens of times and still laugh and cry in all the  right places.  Buy it before it disappears forever.",945302400,5,572,4.744897959183674
388606,3,6301967275,"The world still awaits the perfect version of this ""song in prose"" cautionary Christmas tale, but I like this version primarily (as a supplement to the Sim version) because of its increased focus on the  story of Bob Cratchit's family and Scrooge's relationship to them before  and after his night of spirits.  There simply are beats here that are  missing from the other classic version, with Alistair Sim.  There were many  famous personages who in their day tackled the task of a definitive Scrooge  for film or radio, among them Ronald Colman, Lionel Barrymore (signed for  this movie but released due to ill health), and Orson Welles.  But out of  all of those who have attempted the role on film, including Patrick  Stewart, George C. Scott, Albert Finney, Tim Curry (in an animated  version), and others, none has brought him to convincing life as well as  either the Sim or the Owen versions.  In fact, my next favorite Scrooge may  well be Henry Winkler in the updaged American Christmas Carol.  So I  recommend first the book itself by Dickens, then this version along with  the Sim for a more complete experience of the classic story of A Christmas  Carol on film.  And give Winkler a try, too.",944956800,33,1205,4.729468599033816
388607,3,6301967275,"A well-intentioned, glossy film, but those who know and love the Charles Dickens story will find fault with M-G-M's super-production. Gene Lockhart (cast because he traditionally held readings of the story at his family  parties) is too prosperously well-fed to be totally convincing as the  meager-salaried Bob Cratchit, and as my wife points out, you can tell this  is an M-G-M movie because the slums have DRAPES. For something truer to the  story, we recommend the famous Alastair Sim version and the unjustly  obscure 1935 version with Sir Seymour Hicks.",944784000,3,559,5.166666666666667
388608,2,6301967275,"MGM, who gave the world the classic 1935 film versions of Dickens' ""David Copperfield"" and ""A Tale of Two Cities"", seriously missed the boat on this one, perhaps because David O. Selznick,who produced the first two films, relinquished this one so that he could concentrate on ""Gone With The Wind"". It's especially unfortunate that one of MGM's best  and most renowned actors, Lionel Barrymore, who played the role of Scrooge annually on radio, was unable to repeat his role onscreen because of his arthritis.

But what on earth was Metro thinking when they assigned the role to second-rate character actor Reginald Owen? Owen plays the role exactly as he plays everything else - with hammy, shallow, comic-book, one-dimensional enthusiasm, as if he had to work hard at feeling any emotion convincingly. He comes across as a  bad imitation of Ralph Richardson. It's hard to believe M-G-M couldn't have  found a better actor--why on Earth didn't they try for Claude Rains or Basil Rathbone? Owen gives the kind of performance that even does a disservice to the popular stereotype of Scrooge.

Fortunately, Gene Lockhart, so often cast as a slimy, weaselly villain, gives an unexpectedly warm, deeply felt performance as Bob Cratchit,making him, for once, into a believable character. (Film musical fans may remember him as the Starkeeper in ""Carousel"".) And Leo G. Carroll is excellent as Marley's Ghost.  But,unfortunately, the studio again takes the easy way out by watering down  the more sinister side of this tale--gone are the two starving children hiding in the robe of the Ghost of Christmas Present and the wandering  spirits whom Marley joins outside Scrooge's window. This would br all right if we were dealing with a twenty-minute recording of the story, where time is limited, but this is supposed to be a full-length film version, so there's no excuse for leaving all those scenes out - unless M-G-M wanted to play it safe, as it so often did, with disturbing scenes in a novel or play.

In fact,that's the primary problem with this version - it tries so hard to be cozy,warm,and  comforting that it misses completely the spirit (pun intended) of the  story---poor Marley isn't even allowed one scary howl. And the producers  make a ghastly error by casting, glamorous, well-endowed Ann Rutherford (of all people) as the Ghost of Christmas Past; she looks like someone from a bad school pageant. Scrooge's fiancee has also been left out, and the death of Scrooge's sister goes entirely unmentioned. Instead, M-G-M has concentrated on good production values and a classy look---typical of their  cowardly ""family"" approach to a classic with some bite.",927158400,14,2662,5.050228310502283

388772,4,6301967275,"This version of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol was really different from other versions that I've seen. First of all Scrooge isn't as miserable, he's got a child-like quality that shows through the miserly disposition, secondly Tiny Tim looked healthier than any other member of the Cratchitt family, and third the visits from the spirits were shorter and left out sizeable Chunks of each spirit's part in the story. But in the end this was a somewhat lighthearted and enjoyable version of a classic tale, I enjoyed it.",1515974400,,523,4.954545454545454

388792,4,6301967275,"An interesting portrayal of Ebinezer Scrooge - more sour, less overtly ""evil"" than other portrayals out there. It follows the book reasonably well. This was the only portrayal I've seen where the Ghost of Christmas Past was played by an old man. My ONLY criticism is the lack of sound quality, particularly with the music and the ""echo chamber"" voices of the ghosts. This needs a serious digital restoration.",1512345600,,408,4.927536231884058
388793,5,6301967275,My favorite version of this tale. Believable acting and mostly true to the story. The creative license taken does add to the enjoyment of the film without tainting the true storyline.,1512000000,2,183,4.935483870967742
388794,2,6301967275,This version of Dicken's  Christmas Carol is in it's original form the best version available.  It is  a shame that it has been so deeply edited that many of the good chapters have been deleted to fit the TV time restraints.  I am very disappointed in the end results.,1511827200,,268,4.408163265306122
388795,5,6301967275,"I have watched this with the Beta video player, VHS video player, DVD player, and the Blue Ray player.  Makes no difference they're all great.  Of course the VHS and Beta were B&W.  B&W is the way it was originally shown in theaters.  So if you only want to watch this in B&W be careful this version is colorized, i.e. colorized is not true to color.  With that said,  I love COLOR.  Sorry but I do even. If it's not true to the original color, I don't care.  Color makes it so much more believable to me.  I'm not buying this for someone else, just me.  If you must see it  B&W look for that version.  So relax and enjoy what ever version you like.  As you can tell, I've finely reached the age of Scrooge.
Why an I buying another DVD?  My old one was ruined in a flood due to a rupture my humidifier line.  Note:  I also love It's a Wonderful Life in color-colorized.",1511654400,,869,4.11377245508982

388929,4,6301967275,"I am building a library of the various incarnations of ""A Christmas Carol"" and so added this version into the mix. It is moderately well done although Tiny Tim isn't very tiny and the overall movie lacks an abundance of emotion. What emotion does come through seems forced: acted out rather than felt. Reginald Owen does a decent job although he walks as if he needs to use the bathroom and then visit a chiropractor. Leo G Carroll as Marley delivers his lines with a wooden expression for which he became famous during his career. Some of the more glaring changes include the interaction between Tiny Tim and Fred, and between Bob Cratchit and Fred. (Did you know that, in the story as written, Cratchit isn't even named until the Ghost of Christmas Present takes Scrooge to his house?); the fact that Fred and Bess are engaged, rather than married; and Belle - there is no mention of Belle in this version. I think you get the point - which is that, despite the changes, this is a version worth watching, especially for those who enjoy old movies. The production is done in black and white which adds to its charm, in my opinion.",1482364800,3,1131,4.549019607843137

389059,3,6301967275,"I would call this production of A CHRISTMAS CAROL the fast-forward version:  at 69 minutes, it's hardly feature length, and although Scrooge is sufficiently crochety and the Cratchits sufficiently Cratchity, Scrooge's abrupt turn about and his blustering ""I *love* Christmas!  I *love* Christmas!"" is more irritating than heartwarming.  I'd rank this version fourth, after the Alistair Sim, Patrick Stewart, and George C. Scott renditions.  I did enjoy seeing a *very* young June Lockhart as one of the innumerable Cratchit urchins.",1455753600,,532,5.6125

389099,3,6301967275,"This 1938 version of ""A Christmas Carol"" achieves the standard MGM studio gloss. This version is ""so studio era Hollywood."" Hugo Butler's screenplay ignores the darker and scarier implications in Charles Dickens' classic 1843 novel in favor of a Merry Christmas time at the movies, courtesy of MGM.
  Reginald Owen is a serviceable ""Bah Humbug!"" Scrooge, but he hardly needs hauntings  from three ghosts to reform to holiday happiness. After his visit from Ghost of Christmas Present, he shouts, ""I love Christmas! I love Christmas!"" The final visit from the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come is included, but seems obligatory and unnecessary. The first ghost Of Christmas Past is played by a young and pretty Ann Rutherford.
  Much of the movie's swift 70 minutes running time is taken up with scenes of characters sliding on the  fake studio snow or otherwise having a jolly good time. When Scrooge fires Bob Crachitt (Gene Lockhart), he doesn't seem very upset about it. Perhaps he knows that a happy ending is a forgone conclusion. Lockhart's real family members portray  most of the Crachitt clan. Terry Kilburn as the allegedly ill Tiny Tim is obviously not very tiny and is glowing with good health.
  DVD Extras include Judy Garland singing an all too brief version of ""Silent Night"" with a boy's choir in 1937. There's a featurette titled ""Jackie Cooper's Christmas Party"" with several stars of yesteryear, including child star Cooper, of course, and Norma Shearer, Clark Gable, and-- Oh, look!-- a very young Bette Davis. And the theatrical trailer.",1453593600,,1556,5.023346303501945

As for the blu-ray, the source print for this release must have been in very good shape, or a lot of remastering has been done - for a film this age it sure looks and sounds great, much better than the most recent VCI Blu-ray of the Alastair Sim version (which is still my favorite).  A lot of changes were made to the story, some folks might take offense, I just came away thinking I didn't care for this version that much.  The extras are pretty interesting.

389186,1,6301967275,"This is without exaggeration the very worst adaptation of all films of Dickens' classic work. It strays so far from the written work that is hardly recognizable as having any relation to what Dickens penned. Dramatic scenes are removed in favor of gushing, cheesy sentimentality. The script is so poorly written it is as if the writer had been given a brief outline of the source material and instructed to fill it out with whatever he might come up with. It's a text book example of how not to adapt a classic piece. Everything about it speaks down to its audience. Unless this cheaply stuffed turkey is the earliest association you have of ""A Christmas Carol"" and fond memories of your innocent childhood cloud better judgment, I would suggest you go elsewhere to experience Dickens' most famous book and an important inspiration for how we experience the Christmas season since 1843 when the work debuted. Read the book or view the 1951 version with Alistair Sim as ""Scrooge"", arguably the finest interpretation available. But, by all means, do yourself a lasting favor and avoid this travesty.",1449273600,,1097,4.903225806451613

My only complaint is that it felt like they sped through some of the material. Scrooge's change of heart felt like it came on very quickly and didn't quite seem believable. Did they cut out content from the play for the sake of having a shorter movie?  I'm not sure, but it was still a decent film.",1421971200,,423,4.341772151898734

389666,4,6301967275,"This version is one of the shorter and more upbeat of all Scrooge/Christmas Carol movies that I have seen. It's only about 69 minutes long, so it breezes right along smartly. Reginald Owen is good as Scrooge.

The film is probably most notable for having many of the Lockhart acting family playing the Cratchits. Gene Lockhart (who would later play the judge in Miracle on 34th Street) is Bob, his real-life wife plays Cratchit's wife in the film, and a very young June Lockhart (who would later star in Lassie and Lost in space) plays one of the Cratchit children.

389678,3,6301967275,"Having just watched this 1938 version pretty much back to back with the 1951 version this one, to me,  in many ways is the weaker film,  from the music score (not near dark enough where it needed to be) to the acting.  Owen isn't bad but doesn't compare to Sim. The actor playing Morley was weak compared to the 1951 versiond actor. (this one seemed to be doing a Karloff impersonation so that was amusing) I did like Gene Lockhart and it was great to see June Lockhart in such an early role as one of the daughters - she even gets a line towards the end.

A main reasons though that I give it 3 stars is the drastic change to the first ghost: The first ghost recast as Glenda, the good witch from Oz? Why? Theat almost makes it 2 stars. There were also a few scenes not in the book that didn't move the story along at all and in a film just over an hour long that tends to slow things down quite a bit.",1419897600,,903,4.027932960893855

389982,5,6301967275,"Public sources relied upon while writing this review:
  *1*  History, movie adaptations of ""Christmas Carol"": en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptations_of_A_Christmas_Carol
  *2*  Public Domain: 1910 Silent 11 minute Movie: archive.org/details/AChristmasCarol

I love every version of ""Christmas Carol"" -- even the crazy ones like ""Scrooged"" and the ones with role reversal (ladies as Scrooge, etc.).

I used to think that this 1938 version, and the 1951 versions that many people claim is the best movie adaptation, were the oldest versions, but now I know there are many more. These were just the best-known ones.

On Christmas Day 2014, I found out that there is a 1910 silent version, which is in the public domain archives. You can watch it here: archive.org/details/AChristmasCarol

It was only natural that I would then think that the 1910 movie was the oldest version, and that the 1938 might be the oldest ""Talkie"" -- but

when I looked at the historical summary at < en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptations_of_A_Christmas_Carol >, I found out that 1910's was only the third oldest movie, and that 1938's was nowhere near the oldest talkie.

I will continue to try to watch as many versions of Christmas Carol as I can every year. Needless to say, I recommend all of them as 5 star movies. Each one has little things that endear them to me, and I hope that they are endearing to you also.",1419465600,,1383,5.125

After watching this one with Reginald Owen, I have to say that I love both of them.  There are some aspects and scenes that I like better in one, and some in the other.  It's an uplifting, inspiring story of redemption and hope.  In the one with Alastair Sim, he says to the ghost of Christmas Future that he can't change because he's too old.  Of course, he does change which shows that way of thinking has no basis and is just an excuse for not making an effort. It's a good movie for young and old.",1419033600,,647,4.305785123966942

What struck me on this viewing was how lean and well-written the script is.  Nothing goes to waste, so the pace of the movie is pretty quick when compared to today's behemoths.

Not a opinion, nonfictionally speaking it was produced geniusly, and of all the remakes
and attempts to improve upon same, they have failed to match this magnificent
most loved classic that I believe Charles Dickens would agree w/me.

Remember, the movie is set in London circa 1825-ish.  Of course it's going to be a little ""cheesy.""  They speak English (not American) and lived almost 200 years ago.  But if you can allow yourself to travel back in time, you will find yourself in a world you may regret leaving when the movie is over.  And the hand of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come has NEVER been surpassed in Hollywood filmdom despite exponential leaps in special effects technology.

I love this movie, and is my all time favorite christmas movie, It reprsents the two sides of a persons character. A Christmas Carol indeed explains the consequences of being selfish,and not caring for the needs of others. Yet it shows the more happier and giving side of a person that brings joy and a good outlook in the act of giving. I recommend that everyone watches A Christmas Carol ,.

391167,4,6301967275,"This is a family friendly adaptation of A Christmas Carol.  It strip-mines the source material, keeping very few scenes intact.  Most of what Dickens intended was tossed aside, replaced with a lot of fabricated nonsense by screenwriter Hugo Butler.  If you prefer a sanitized version of the classic story, you can't do better than this.

The enthusiasm of the actors for their roles is obvious.  Most of them are quite generous with their gestures/expressions (the notable exception being Leo G. Carroll who plays Marley so dead it's a wonder he even bothered to show up).  Terry Kilburn makes one of the healthiest looking Tim's ever to play the role.  For a family supposedly starving, living hand-to-mouth, they certainly were a substantial looking bunch.  It was also a bit jarring when Polly Benedict (Ann Rutherford) shows up as a beauty queen contestant sent to fly Scrooge to school.  Speaking of `bald caps,' Reginald Owen certainly wore his well.  Love Christmas Present (Lionel Braham) with his magic horn.  At least the grim reaper looked the part, showing Scrooge the error of his ways.  But I miss Want and Ignorance, Scrooge's fianc&eacute;e, the thieves who ransack Scrooge's room after he dies.............

It just doesn't have the same feeling as the more faithful adaptations.  Still, there is some entertainment value to be had.  And at only 69 minutes, a passable diversion for a lonely winter's night.",1387411200,,1424,5.077586206896552
391168,5,6301967275,"I'm probably in the minority, but this is my favorite version of the Dickens classic.  This is the 1938 version.  The 1951 version starring Alastair Sims is more famous, but I usually watch  both versions each year.  The 1938 version is only an hour or so long, and goes along rather briskly, so kids should be able to enjoy it as well as adults.  The best things I like is the fact that Gene Lockhart (Bob Crachit) gives a wonderful, hilarious performance.  Reginald Owen is a good Scrooge.  He is a selfish old man in the beginning, but turns into the joyous Scrooge very early.  He plays the role a little more subtlety than Sims does.  Terry Kilburn as Tiny Tim is a bit over the top, but to me, it adds to the magical charm of the movie.  In fact, If you have never seen this version, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.",1387411200,,831,4.303225806451613
391169,5,6301967275,"This 1938 version is filmed in poorly- lit black and white...just perfect to depict the look and feel of the Dickensian England.

I would recommend this movie to any one who wants to see how Christmas was really celebrated in the old days.  Remember that this story was really a criticism of England's position on debtors, work houses, and treatment of the poor masses.  The book and the movie moved above the social critique to become a Christmas classic for the ages.  I think that on a deeper level it hits home to everyone.",1387238400,,553,4.48

It is superior to all later versions, excepting the above-mentioned, including animated ones.

I have always liked this one, it's true enough to the story, but with some warmth that only the early studios could put in a movie.  By far the best Bob Cratchit played by Gene Lockhart (the judge in Miracle on 34th Street), the sweetest Tiny Tim with the biggest eyes and kindest spirit.  Gene Lockart's wife is his real wife and daughter June is one of Bob's brood too.  Scrooge is wonderful, but maybe it's Gene Lockhart as Bob that makes this my favorite version--the tearful, lovng look down at Tiny Tim while singing O Come Let Us Adore HIm in church, then Tiny Tim slipping his hand into his father's as they sing.

I found it on Amazon and watched it again for this first time in more years than I can count. It took me back to those early years with many of the same emotions - excitement and anticipation.

391199,3,6301967275,"""A Christmas Carol"" revolves around Scrooge.  The actors in other parts may be fine and even excellent, but without a Scrooge you can believe in and come to cheer for, they can never save a production.  Reginald Owen is a cardboard cutout of a Scrooge, maybe too much from the old ham actor school of stereotyped posing to portray particular attitudes and emotions.  He studiously maintains a bent and wooden attitude and a wooden expression through much of the movie.  Most of his lines are delivered in an unvarying bark.  Set him against someone like Sim and he comes off like a marionette.

The rest of the actors were decent, with Tiny Tim and Bob Cratchit having some good moments.

The screenplay is a little coarse, with actors sometimes telling you in the dialog what you're supposed to be feeling.  Also, Scrooge reaches his epiphany about half-way thru the time of Christmas Present, with little left for Christmas Yet to Come to do.  And there is nowhere the bleak, stirring emotional body blow of Want and Ignorance clinging to Christmas Present for protection from their fetters.

The production also gave away its (I think) American roots with the often spotty execution of the English accents and a sort of half-hearted insistence on ""uplifting"" and ""lighthearted"" vignettes scattered among the central story line.

All told, a harmless little movie but not one worth watching more than once.",1386892800,3,1408,4.923728813559322

After the Patrick Stewart version, this 1938 version is the best one. The 1951 Alistair Sim version, which people keep saying is the best version, is FAR from it. It's overblown, pretentious, and extremely hammy. Not to mention the atmosphere is severely lacking. Not so with this 1938 version. The atmosphere is almost perfect. Reginald Owen is a great Scrooge. Him and Patrick Stewart are as close to the Scrooge from the book as you can get. The only real downside of the movie is Gene Lockhart as Bob Cratchit. He's far too fat to be a believable Bob Cratchit. But he does play the role very well, even if he doesn't fit the part. If you want a realistic version of A Christmas Carol, skip the 1951 version and go with this AND  the 1999 Patrick Stewart version.",1358294400,,933,4.620481927710843

It is very well acted and for 1938, the special effects are actually quite amazing. The message is timeless and it really makes one think about the true meaning and spirit of Christmas. It is a tearjerker and has an amazing ending. It's not Christmas if I do not watch the original ""A Christmas Carol!""",1357171200,3,477,4.494252873563219

391445,4,6301967275,"The story is timeless with the massage that is well known to fans of the Dickens classic. At least some of the acting in this version doesn't seem to quite measure up to some of the other movie versions. And to apparently make this version a little more family friendly, a few scenes or portions of scenes were left out of this production (i.e. the lamenting spirits outside of Scrooge's window and the entire scene in which Scrooge's possessions are fenced at Joe's in ""Christmas future"" are omitted in this movie).
  What makes this version special to me is the final scene. I love the traditional ending (which this rendition greatly alters) in which Scrooge sends the anonymous entree to the Cratchits and the next day Scrooge convinces Bob he's about to be sacked before telling him he will raise his salary and take care of his family. But the altered final scene in which Scrooge, Nephew Fred and Fred's wife-to-be show up at the Cratchit home is a touching one. In my opinion, it's a well written scene and Gene Lockhart's wonderfully comic work as Bob and Scrooge's new found cheer and generosity are a delightful end to this version. This final scene of the movie ends with Reginald Owens' Scrooge giving a toast that touches my heart and brings a tear to my eye every Christmas season.

TMC shows movies commercial free. Then I had to replace my receiver for my sattelite system and the recoreded movie was consequently gone with the old receiver. Then I noticed this year that AMC was showing this movie at 2AM. I recoreded it and it wasn't the same. The run time of the movie is only 69 minutes. AMC's run time was 105 minutes which meant that they loaded the movie with 36 minutes of commercials! This took away from the enjoyment of watching the movie. I bought my own and am happy that I did.

Naturally, I have evaluated in my own mind the relative quality of each version, from George C. Scott, Albert Finney, Alistair Sim, this one, and a fifth whose actors I cannot identify.

One of the factors I consider most important is whether the version agrees with Dickens' novel.  Where there are differences, I consider whether the new version is at least credible and something with which Dickens perhaps would have agreed.

This version I would call ""good"" for the viewer who knows nothing of the book and has never seen another version.  it's weakness is in its overly fanciful additions to the story.  Lengthy accounts of sliding on the snow-packed streets, sprinkling of magic dust to resolve men's differences,  Cratchit's being ""sacked"" from his job for hitting Scrooge with a snowball, etc. are simply too much for original plot to sustain.

It's easier to give MGM a pass on their customary license taken, for giving it a much needed facelift. And, the advances reflected in the spirit visitors were appreciable.  What a difference three years and no doubt a larger budget make.  This is one of the shorter versions of the timeless classic tale, not so dark, perhaps the least scary one, with Scrooge changing his tune almost with the first spirit visitor. It takes you more quickly to the gratifying climax - the turned around Scrooge and the impact of his largesse. It is a more family friendly version, lighter, more conducive to children's shorter attention span, and the language is more simplified. For my own or an all-adults situation, I would choose another version.

Even the cartoon versions are better than this one.  Some of the stories on here aren't bad, and Gene Lockhart as Bob Cratchit is good, as are his kids.  But ultimately this movie really lacks the energy it needs to sustain such a story, especially the Marley character.  There are too many important scenes that aren't even in this, while some of the other scenes are pure drivel.

If this had been the first version I ever saw, I would never have watched another Scrooge or Christmas Carol ever again! Do yourself a HUGE favor and watch the 1951 version.  Nobody can compare to Alastair Sim as Scrooge!",1353715200,6,761,4.478260869565218

391861,1,6301967275,"I love ""A Christmas Carol"" and collect every version I can get my hands on.  I can honestly say that this is the only reason I own this movie.  Where to begin?  This is such a watered-down, sanitized version that it barely resembles the Dickens classic.  MGM took the bite out of this story in favor of something warm and fuzzy and the result is atrocious.  Reginald Owens' portrayal of Scrooge is one-dimensional and his makeup is horrible, like something out of an Ed Wood film.  Particularly ridiculous is the embarrassing overacting by the Cratchit children.  Their reaction to their father's purchases of chestnuts and a goose goes beyond simple joy and excitement and can be more accurately described as sheer lunacy.  Watching this scene makes one wish Cratchit had also brought them some much needed Ritalin.  The Ghost of Christmas Past, instead of being a uniquely childlike old man, is an insanely beautiful woman, more reminiscent of Glinda the Good Witch of the North.  Just way too much candy coating on this overly family-friendly version.  I don't think even Lionel Barrymore could have saved this cinematic drivel.",1323820800,8,1131,4.962765957446808

If I was only able to own just one version of this awesome Christmas movie, this would undoubtedly be the one version I would own. To me Reginald Owen IS Scrooge, he doesn't just ""play"" him, he does a spectacular job giving you the feeling what Scrooge is all about. Just my opinion, but I would like to think watching as many different versions as I have, I know a GREAT version when I see it.

I would wait to watch it on Channel 9 WGN Family Classics at Christmas time, It is a great childhood memory. Now to be able to see it whenever I want is just terrific. I have watched all the other versions, and this one stands the test of time. Like Jimmy Stewart in It's a Wonderful Life. Reginald Owens version of Scrooge is the one that always stands out in my memory as the most mean and dispicable. Yet you find yourself happy for his newfound redemption by the end of the movie. I think that because most of these actors in the 30's were classically trained, you get a greater sense of emotion and feeling for the characters. You feel bad for, Bob Cratchit when he gets ""sacked"", you smile with him when he regains his sense of optimism, and you feel good when everything comes together in the end. My opinion is that many modern actors fail to achieve the same effect. Which is why the 1938 version is my favorite. The Victorian settings and costumes portrayed on black and white film are just the wonderful. I think this is less a review and more a rant on what this movie means to me. Either way it's a wonderful classic. Enjoy !",1321056000,3,1229,4.278969957081545
391865,4,6301967275,"All in all this film presents a rather liberal rendition of the Dickens story, adding some unnecessary details and unique scenes while removing important scenes from the novella.  The production quality is high, however, and the acting quite good.  The characters of Bob Cratchit and Fred are especially well portrayed.  For example there is no party at Fezziwig's warehouse.  Likewise there is no mention of Scrooge's fianc from an earlier time.  Neither does the Ghost of Christmas Present take Scrooge across the sea nor around the world observing Christmas practices elsewhere (an element often left out of film treatments).  Nor does the ghost reveal the children representing Ignorance and Want.  Though Scrooge is shown the shrouded corpse on the bed he is not taken to the beetling house to see his possessions sold off.  There is also no reference to the couple in debt who are relieved at the repayment extension they get as a result of Scrooge's death.  Other scenes have been created by Hollywood including aspects of Marley's visit.  Upon seeing Marley in his bedroom, Scrooge promptly opens his window to call three night watchmen who rush upstairs to rid the place of the intruder.  Finding no one they ask for a drink and are refused.

391942,4,6301967275,"In 1837 in London, an old rich miser named Ebeneezer Scrooge (Reginald Owen) who has an underpaid worker named Bob Cratchit (Gene Lochart)treats nearly everyone like dirt over the years since his partner Jacob Marley (Leo G. Carrol) died 7 years ago and has no feeling for Christmas in his icy heart. He also doesn't like his nephew Fred (Barry Mackey) as he refuses an offer to the next day's Christmas dinner, Scrooge also doesn't know how poor the family of Bob is especially poor Tiny Tim (Terry Kilburn). But on Christmas eve, he is visited by the spirit of his former partner who warns him about the fate that he suffered and that the same thing will happen to Scrooge but worse if he doesn't change his ways as he must listen to three ghosts such as Past (Ann Rutherford), Present (Lionel Braham) and Future (D'Arcy Corrigan) to make him change.

Co-starring Katheleen Lockhart, it's one of the first and weakest of the many Christmas Carol stories of many years. It's not as brilliant as 1951's movie which is the definitive Scrooge movie but what isn't? the performances are very good especially from Owen who does a convincing job of playing Scrooge. It's still a fun and pleasant adaptation of the greatest christmas story of all but not quite like 1951's or 1984's movies or even the Muppet's.

This is the version I watched on television most often as I was growing up,on WGN TV's ""Family Classics"", show in Chicagoland. So many people are diehard fans of the Alastair Sim version, and it is good, but there is a warm old-fashioned genuineness to this 1930's MGM version. I always think of the Tiny Tim from this version, Gene Lockhart as Cratchit, and Reginald Owen as Scrooge.
  This version always seems superior to me...It's older, more traditional,...the snow seems more real, the fireplace warmer. Everything about it is top-drawer, and how about the great Leo G. Carroll as Jacob Marley's Ghost? No one has ever played the part better.
  I got my copy from Amazon in the ""Warner Classic Holiday Collection"" with ""Christmas In Connecticut"", etc.. The DVD here is exactly the same (as far as I can tell) as the one included in the ""Collection"".

We finally settled on the 1939 version starring Reginald Owen and Gene Lockhart. It also stars his wife Kathleen. Not mentioned in the credits is the fact that some of their children are in it as well. One of their children June Lockhart, who played one of the Cratchett girls in the movie, went on to movie success and also played the mom on the TV show Lassie for a few years in the 50's. Her daughter Ann Lockhart played on the 1980's TV series Battlestar Galactica with Lorne Greene. Another thing that Johnny Carson said on his show many years ago was that he was the little boy who took the coin from Scrooge to buy the Goose near the end of the movie.

And, Bob Cratchet's wife was actually played by Gene Lockhart's wife in real life (as was one of the Cratchet children - June Lockhart of ""Lassie"" fame).

392003,5,6301967275,"Although a number of film versions of the Charles Dickens classic, ""A Christmas Carol"" have been made, our favorite is the 1936 version starring Reginald Owen as the miser Scrooge. We have watched this movie every year as a family tradition to connect us to the Christmas season.

The black and white format lends a seasonal spirit to this classic story and makes you believe that you are a part of the story.

We like the shorter, concise version of this movie rather than the longer, more dramatic versions that followed. The story flows well and the characters are believable. While this story does not go into the in depth detail of other versions of the story, it is not necessary as this version does cover the essentials of the Dickens story.

Owen does a masterful job of portraying the miserly Scrooge who has spent his life in acquiring wealth but never really enjoying his life. It is only through the help of his past departed business partner, Jacob Marley, and the three spirits of Christmas Past, Christmas Present, and Christmas Future does Scrooge get to evaluate his life and see how he has wasted it on greed.

Once Scrooge realizes that he still has time to make amends for his selfish, greedy and insensitive existence, he turns into a new man who keeps Christmas in his heart everyday.

This is a great version of the Dickens classic that the entire family can enjoy.",1264809600,3,1389,4.676229508196721

The story needs no recounting (but I will anyway). Nasty old Scrooge treats all the world like dirt until he's visited by the enchained ghost of his dead business partner, Jacob Marley (Leo G. Carroll) whose face first appears in the midst of Scrooge's demonic doorknocker (""Oh look! A Leo G. Carroll doorknocker! He won it in a contest, you know""). Marley warns Scrooge to mend his ways or suffer the same miserable eternal fate. Scrooge ""Bah! Humbug!""s him, but is then visited by the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future who review his life with him.

Scrooge does mend his ways, but in this version he changes so fast from creep to christian that there's the scent of something insincere about it. The insincerity is reinforced because (quite inexplicably) the scriptwriters drop Dickens' wonderful coda about how well old Ebenezer Scrooge kept Christmas year 'round thereafter. I was left with the feeling Scrooge would be in Christmas rehab next coming December.

Still, it's Dickens.",1259884800,3,1378,5.004366812227074
392034,5,6301967275,"A Christmas Carol (1938) directed by Edwin L. Marin, based on the novel by Charles Dickens, written for the screen by Hugo Butler.

Starring: Reginald Owen as Ebenezer Scrooge
Reginald Owen was not set to play this part until his long time friend Lionel Barrymore had to cancel his part as Scrooge because of sickness. Fate had other plans it seems.

We all know the story: Mean man Scrooge humbugs his way through life eschewing Christmas as if it was a nagging sore that rooted itself more deeply each year, that he could not get away from. It seems everyone under the moonlight was celebrating this holiday called Christmas, with global cheer and good will. Scrooge, who had been bittered and shriveled through a life without love, and without forgiveness, was a man of business, of rules, and of ascetic necessity. He did not know happiness and he wished that anyone he came across would keep the optimism away from him, especially a man he worked for named Bob Cratchit, played wonderfully by Gene Lockhart (whom made this film with his wife and daughter).

Bob Cratchit counted on Scrooge for his survival and the well being(or living) for his family. Bob oozed with altruism and obsequiousness, and Scrooge knew this, turning his blind eye to it as much as he could till one a Christmas Eve Bob, having fun with the local kids, unintentionally threw a glittering white snowball at Scrooge as he passed. Upon finding this out, Scrooge fired him. Cratchit walked home that night on Christmas Eve holding his dignity in his hand and left his confidence in the melting snow that was stepped on by Scrooge himself. He wanted this night to be a night for his children and family, selflessly not revealing to them what had happened just moments prior.

Everyone who is a fan of Charles' Dickens A Christmas Carol knows how the story plays out, with some tweaks in different film adaptations here and there, knowing the moral that Scrooge learns at the end of this fateful Christmas night.

What I find different in this film than all the others out there is in the characters that are portrayed wonderfully by the cast of actors here. Scrooge is a bitter, curt, presumptuously crass old man while Reginald Owen poses the look of those qualities perfectly. He grumbles his way through the night and humbugs all who try to help him. You can see the years of misery on his face. As the ghosts progress through the night, you can sense and see the gradual inclination towards redemption and hope that he expresses with nothing but a slight opening of an eye that had been squinted  from a life of lost passion and lost love, all with a little dribble of a tear down his left eye. I like how Owen grows as the film goes on and we see this happening before our eyes, as the audience, and I don't think it has been matched since. Owen makes the film for me and till this day I have not been filled with as much saving grace for this character than the 1938's version of Ebenezer Scrooge. It is my definitive version and hopefully with a little Christmas cheer, will be yours for years to come in this ageless timeless film.",1256342400,4,3116,4.595323741007194

If anyone were to see A Christmas Carol staring Reginald Owen for the first time I'm sure they would take a likin' to it.

392153,4,6301967275,"There have been countless adaptations of Charles Dickens's ""A Christmas Carol"" over the last century. One of my favorite Christmas traditions is to watch several of them. This is one of my favorites...

Trivia: Reginald Owen was a last-minute replacement for the ailing Lionel Barrymore.

The Good: The cast is terrific. Owen is a perfect Scrooge. Barry Mackie's Fred is probably the best interpretation of the Fred Holywell character and he exudes a joie de vie that can barely be contained. And there's real chemistry between Mackie and Carver (Bess). The Cratchit family gets a lot more screen time and you see how happy the family really is, and how much they love each other. For 1938, the special effects are good, and you need to squint to see the wires when Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Past are flying. Start to finish, this is a sweet, likeable film and frankly underrated, as it's one of the better adaptations of the Dickens classic.

Liberties with the story (all good): The idea that Scrooge would fire Cratchit (and on Christmas Eve) isn't in the original story (or any other adaptation) but really shows how mean old Scrooge can be. Despite his sacking, Bob still finds his Christmas spirit. I LOVE the church scene on Christmas day with the characters singing ""O come all ye faithful,"" and the sliding on the ice outside the church. The snowball fights are cute. The scene where Fred takes Tiny Tim on his back so he can slide on the ice like the other kids shows Fred's kindness and is heartwarming. I like the scene where Scrooge is so enjoying watching the Cratchit's and Fred's Christmas gatherings that he smiles and tells the Ghost of Christmas present, ""I won't go with you! I'm going to stay! I love Christmas!""

And finally, I love that Scrooge makes Fred his partner, ensuring financial security for his nephew so he can marry Bess.

The Not-So-Good. The enthusiasm and cheer throughout the film (except in the possible future) are a bit too much--everyone in the cast except Scrooge is on a sugar-high. The Cratchit children are so enthusiastic and happy that the acting goes wayyyyyyy over the top. We get that they're poor - we get that they don't have goose too often - but the exuberance is too much. Another example of this is Bob Cratchit shouting, ""Merry Christmas"" in the streets just moments after lamenting being fired - the over-the-top happiness take away a little from the ""haunting ghost story"" the film is supposed to be. But perhaps that was the director and producer's intention, to keep the mood light. This version of the classic is not at all a ""dark"" film.

And despite the additional scenes not in the novel, production feels rushed because other scenes were cut or not filmed. Scrooge's transformation feels just a little bit forced. There's no exposition as to how Scrooge became so mean (the Ghost of Christmas Past mentions that she has yet to show Scrooge his descent into greed and his darker years, and then Scrooge basically says, ""No more, I can't stand it,"" and that's it, he's back in his bedroom). There's no scene where people are selling Scrooge's personal items right after he died (recall the famous line about the housekeeper tearing down the bed curtains while Scrooge lay dead) but on Christmas morning Scrooge still looks up at the bed curtains, noting they have not been torn down.

The ending feels a bit rushed and wraps up everything in a few moments at the Cratchit house.

Summary: My dad's very favorite version (and the only version that holds a true place in my heart for that reason). I remember when I was a kid, Dad and I would stay up late to watch this version on TV (no VCRs or DVDs back then). None of the ""not-so-good"" moments I cited detract from the story too much, and the liberties and additions are for the most part refreshing and welcome. Despite minor shortcomings; and a few liberties (most of them good) with the story, this is one of the best adaptations of the oft-filmed Dickens Yuletide classic and one I love.

I would argue that there are many superior Christmas movies than either version.

One issue here is the casting.  I didn't picture Bob Crachit as a chubby guy, nor did I picture Tiny Tim as a healthy teenager, but the performances themselves for those roles were for the most part solid.  Scrooge was played far less effectively than he has been since and the make-up to make the actor look older is absolutely terrible, even for the time.

Mostly, I'm pretty easy on films that deviate from the literature they are based on, but when the deviations effect what made the story so great in the first place I can't help but be critical.  The ghost of Christmas Past is played by an attractive 18 year old Ann Rutherford.  In the novel the ghost was a disturbing looking boy with grey hair.  Scrooge's nephew Fred's character is more of a crucial subplot to add some romance to the film.  It is also missing quite a bit of other more grim details.  Jacob Marley's arrival is for the most part quiet and dull where it should be accompanied with painful wails.  The thieves who ransack Scrooge's dead body to sell his stuff and the two creepy children under the Ghost of Christmas Past's robe that represent ""ignorance"" and ""want"" are not present at all.  Very little is mentioned of the death of Scrooge's sister Fan, which is really the turning point for Scrooge's downfall in the original story and there is of course no mention at all of Belle, the love in Scrooge's life who left him because of his selfish behavior.  The movie also centralizes the location of Scrooge's redemption on Christmas Day to Cratchit's house in the presence of Cratchit's family, his nephew Fred, and Fred's fiance (already his wife in the original story).  All of these deviations mean that MGM wanted to create something much more family friendly, but in the process they lessen the thunder in Dickens's original theme denouncing poverty and other social ills.  It also effects just how profound the overall portrayal of Scrooge's redemption actually is.

It lacks the teeth of other versions of the story but it is still worth looking back on.  The ending is always rewarding and the theme, however superficially displayed in MGM's film, is still captured and that is crucial for me.  Perhaps Scrooge's contempt for Christmas is an apt point for the exact opposite reasons his money-hungry soul found it to be ""humbug"" back in the middle of the 19th century.  Modern times offers a MacDonaldized Christmas that Ebenezer Scrooge might appreciate, a season that is mostly void of sentiments such as charity and hospitality.  A Christmas Carol, even a diluted film version such as this, is one of the few bastions of holiday fiction that captures the resolution to most selfish desires.  Perhaps that is the reason this story resonates and fascinates 160 years after its initial creation.",1197590400,7,3413,5.260147601476015

While to my mind, Gene Lockhart is too plump and lives too grandly (his house seems quite palatial when compared to that of David Warner in the George C. Scott version&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Christmas-Carol/dp/B00000K3CJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Christmas Carol</a>) to properly represent Scrooge's underpaid clerk, Bob Cratchit.  His Cratchit lacks the overworked and underpaid look of someone who who toils through a 12 hour day for someone like Scrooge; whose generosity to himself is almost as lacking as his generosity toward others.

The acting, while not exemplary, is serviceable.  Leo G. Carrol is outstanding as Marley's ghost, but then Marley's ghost in most productions is, if not outstanding, more than adequate.  Compare Michael Hoddern in the Sim version or Alec Guiness in the musical&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scrooge/dp/B0000AQS5D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scrooge</a>&nbsp;to Carrol's performance to see what I mean.  They are all good.

On the whole, my opinion of this version is that it is good - not great.  However, my opinion, like those of the other reviewers here is subjective; influenced by the many associations one has with both the movie and the season.

392198,3,6301967275,"Frankly, all that saves this film from mediocrity is the stellar cast. Reginald Owen is faced with a part that has little character development, but manages to express a range of emotions and make the peripheral view of Scrooge which the script allows believeable. Gene Lockhart, as a sacked Bob Cratchitt who maintains a pleasant demeanour not to ruin Christmas for his family, does a superb job in a rather cartoonish version of the character - seeming to be the ultimate fun-loving, devoted father.

The film certainly is suitable family fare. The magic of Victorian toys, circles of Blind Man's Buff at Fred's party, the laughing Cratchitt's at the table, and cinematography which capture a fictional but ""museum village"" view of ""Dickens London"" would be especially suited to children, since the dark side of the story is nearly entirely eliminated. There is nothing to trouble the very young, who indeed might find the Cratchitt home to be a place where they might care to visit.

Yet the adaptation is a poor rendition for any lover of Dickens. Scrooge seems to be in self imposed loneliness, and insensitive towards his clerk, but (aside from the 'surplus population' line, which seems more a rebuff to charity collectors than an indication of Scrooge's miserly nature) there is no hint of, for example, Ignorance and Want and the tragedies arising from these. Most of the scenes from Dickens, when Scrooge is visited by any of the three spirits, have been eliminated. For example, in Christmas Present, none of the tragic, sordid plight of the poor is shown, nor is Scrooge's hardness of heart. We merely see him watch a party at Fred's (and beg the spirit to stay for the rest of the games), and want to hear Bob Cratchitt tell the rest of the story of Aladdin to his unusually happy family. Scrooge suddenly calls out that he 'loves Christmas,' and the effect is of one who did not know how to enjoy company rather than one whose heart is hardened with greed. Nor do the Christmas Past sequences, which are limited to his going home for Christmas with his sister and remembering Fezziwig's including him in Christmas dinner, include any of Scrooge's adult life.

The plot has no depth, and characterisation is shallow. My impression was that it was intended to capture a mythical Christmas where all have fun and frolic. The only note of pathos is in the future, seeing the Cratchitts weep for Tiny Tim.

It is a pleasant holiday diversion, good for nostalgia or for keeping the children occupied whilst one stuffs the turkey, but it bears little resemblance to Dickens.",1197072000,2,2581,4.832579185520362

392202,5,6301967275,"If you or your family are looking to settle into viewing a particular adaptation of ""A Christmas Carol"" but are not quite in the mood for the somewhat darker tellings starring Alastair Sim or  George C. Scott, and instead desire a compartively more light hearted version, then your best bet is this b&w version from 1938. Unlike the British version starring Seymour Hicks from a few years back in 1935, this version does not necessarily bring up too many comparisons between the rich and poor. Perhaps, as America was still in the throes of the Great Depression, audiences didn't want to be reminded about how bad things already were. Instead, the London the viewer is presented with is sparkling city lights, and kids dashing through the streets, sliding and throwing snowballs at one another. Markets and shoppers are happy. Sure, there are those that are poor, and could be doing better, but they are by no means malnourished or starving. This is best emphasized by the Cratchit family (which I'll go into shortly). Everyone is festive. Until all the gaiety is interrupted by the tall, gaunt shadow of Ebenezer Scrooge (Reginald Owen), when he walks in to the office on his nephew and clerk, Bob Cratchit (Gene Lockhart), getting ready to share a Christmas toast.

  Reginald Owen's Scrooge is in the classic mold. Old, and mean, and to whom only money matters, as that's all he knows. But, as this version is on the lighter side, this Scrooge does have a heart and its strings are pulled without too much effort by the Spirits. In fact, Scrooge seems almost reformed by the time the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come makes its ominous entrance.

  The Cratchit family do not necessarily live in the neediest of circumstances. In fact, their home is pretty modest and comfortable looking. Bob looks particularly well-fed. It seems the filmmakers were trying to cast aside strong references to the Depression. People had seen enough of the real thing with their own eyes, and movies were meant for escape. So the images of poverty and starving so much a part of Dickens' original tale are softened and cleaned up in this more cheerful version. No scene of the Ghost of Christmas Present revealing to Scrooge any disturbing representations of Ignorance and Want as children. In fact, the Spirit reveals to him all the enchantment of Christmas Cheer he's missing out on.

  Reginald Owen makes for a fine and miserly Scrooge. What's interesting to note is that Lionel Barrymore was set to play the role, as he had been doing so as a tradition every year at Christmas time on the radio. But, due to health reasons he had to pull out and suggested the fifty year old Owen, a British thespian to replace him. Also, I think Barry Mackay as Fred, Scrooge's nephew, gave the most bright and charming interpretation of the charcter I've seen in any version of the story and it remains my favorite. All the players in the film give charming and warm performances, especially Terry Kilburn as Tiny Tim.

  To sum it up, while this version is softer in how it deals with some of the darker elements of the story such as in the images of poverty the novel raises, it succeeds in being warm and cheerful at heart. That makes this a version perfect for family viewing.",1194998400,4,3253,4.726148409893993

A Christmas Carol with Reginald Owen is the version that was aired every Christmas season in the Chicago area.  My grandmother, who was from Moravia, would say to us, ""Come on kids, der Scrroog iz on!""
I ordered this version because each Christmas season I'd miss it.  We have the other versions that also are superb, and I understand why others would state the one with Allistor Sim is their favorite.  This time watching it ... after not seeing it for at least a decade, I picked up on something:  When Gene's character Bob is talking about Tiny Tim, his real life daughter gives him a look that transcended acting in the scene.  My lady friend is rather stoney as she watches movies, and I had to fight back tears when I picked up on that.  The actor that portrays Scrooges nephew is also the best in that role.  The scene at the church where he is singing along with the others ""Oh Come All Ye Faithful,"" I've never witnessed on film (aside from the recent Amazing Grace story) anyone sing with such enthusiasm and in the Spirit.  Again, something that transcended acting in this movie.",1191456000,5,1139,4.603960396039604
392204,5,6301967275,"This is by far and away the very best version of A Christmas Carol to ever be put on film (better than the terrible Alastir Sim version everyone raves about).

This movie cuts out the depressing things, like Scrooge's home being pilaged after his death and Marley removing the cloth from around his head and letting his jaw drop creepily, as well as the ""too much"" stuff like the scene from the past showing Scrooge and his girlfriend.

It's not overly mushy, just warm-hearted and charming, and it gets right to the point of telling the story with charm and a bright Christmas message. There are many light-hearted, fun scenes we get to see as they warm Scrooge's heart, and the movie does a wonderful job of showing us Scrooge's reclaimation in an uplifting way.

No one, but no one, can touch Reginald Owen as Scrooge. Lionel Barrymore hand-picked Reginald Owen to replace him as Scrooge for the movie. The best cast that could be assembled was already signed and the sets already built when Lionel, who'd always played Scrooge on the radio, was injured and couldn't do it. It speaks volumes that Lionel Barrymore thought enough of Reginald Owen's ability to have him be his replacement. And Lionel was right! Owen plays and looks the part perfectly.

The supporting cast is absolutely wonderful as well, including the great Gene Lockhart. Everyone from Tiny Tim to Fred, Scrooge's nephew, to the Ghosts of Christmas to Marley are superb. There is not one thing to be changed that could make this movie any better (except when Ann Sheridan says to Scrooge after he remarks how kind his old boss was, ""Yes, but he's dead now.""--my whole family laughs at the remark ;) ). Everything is done to complete perfection. I've watched every single version of this story, including many plays, and now I will not watch any other version because they seem so horrible by comparison. With Reginald Owen's brilliance in the part, the wonderful cast, and the wonderful interpretation and telling of the tale, nothing is more perfect than this version.

You get some good laughs with this warm, ""fuzzy-feeling-inside"" version and a big smile through the whole thing. It's not Christmas without watching this version.",1187827200,4,2204,4.851063829787234

The actor who played Fred, Scrooge's nephew, was a bit ""over the top"" (maybe he was a stage actor more accustomed to broad acting to a live audience, I don't know), but he brought enough energy to the role that this is only a minor complaint.

I watched this film recently after seeing the Alastair Sim version and I must say that this film kind of reeks. You could call this film The Bob Cratchit Story co-starring Ebenezer Scrooge. This film presents the Cratchit family in unremitting detail until the story of their lives becomes quite nauseating.  And, Tiny Tim (who isn't so Tiny) is on camera entirely too much. In contrast, the Sim film focuses on the life of Scrooge and psychoanalyzes him in depth. It is also much truer to the allegorical aspects of Dickens' novel, including the shocking presentation of the children ""Want"" and ""Ignorance"". Do yourself a favor and watch either the Sim film or the excellent TV production starring George C. Scott. I'm sorry, but The Cratchit Story pales in comparison.",1135900800,8,878,4.89261744966443
392266,5,6301967275,"Reginald Owen shines brightly as the star, not a supporting actor, in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's 1938 version of Charles Dickens'
""A Christmas Carol."" This is one of those classic MGM films with a superb cast, beautifully done costumes and sets, a fast
paced script, and an excellent score.

Reginald Owen was not the first choice to play the role of Ebenezer Scrooge. Owen replaced the ailing Lionel Barrymore, whose accident on the set of ""Saratoga"" (1937) would confine him
to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Owen makes the role his own as we watch his reclamation from a penny pinching anti
Christmas businessman in 1800's London to a wealthy philanthropist who faithfully celebrates Christmas every day of every year.

Owen is supported by a first rate cast which includes Gene Lockhart as his overworked and underpaid clerk and Barry MacKay
as his nephew who enjoys life to the fullest. This particular version gives special focus to the Cratchit family and Kathleen
Lockhart adds much to the canvas as Mrs. Cratchit. ( This is the
only film where Gene Lockhart, his real life spouse, Kathleen Lockhart, and his daughter, June Lockhart, all appear together.)

Additional lustre is added by Leo G. Carroll as the haunting ghost of Jacob Marley and Terry Kilburn as ""Tiny Tim"" Cratchit.
This film, which has stood the test of time, is a must see for everyone.

This film has just been released as a DVD from Warner Home Video
and contains lots of holiday goodies. The best being ""The Christmas Party"", where child star Jackie Cooper asks ""The First
Lady of MGM"", Norma Shearer, to arrange a Christmas party for him and all his friends on one of Mr. Mayer's soundstages. Shearer is radiant with beauty and charm as she receives young
Cooper in her dressing room and agrees to negotiate the party with Mr. Mayer. Another Christmas gem is a very young Judy Garland singing ""Silent Night.""",1135468800,11,1891,4.845201238390093
392267,5,6301967275,"The 1938 version of ""A Christmas Carol"" is full of colorful renderings (even though it's in black-and-white) of very familiar Dickens characters, Scrooge, Bob Cratchit, and Tiny Tim among them.  Reginald Owen does a good job as Scrooge - showing both his stingy ill-humor and his awakening as a human being -- although one wonders how much better the movie might have been if Lionel Barrymore had reprised his regular radio role as Scrooge here.  (This was apparently the original intention of MGM, but Barrymore had health problems that prevented his participation.  And he eventually played his own version of Scrooge in ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" of course.)  Well-known character actor Gene Lockhart is a bit more portly as Bob Cratchit than I had imagined that character, but he does his usual great job of portraying the downtrodden Cratchit who maintains a good humor while enduring Scrooge's abuse.  Lockhart's real-life wife and kids, including young June Lockhart, are featured as other members of the Cratchit family, with the exception of Tiny Tim, who is played by Terry Kilburn.  Kilburn is a bit too cute for my taste, but I have to admit that Dickens seems to have intended Tim to be cute.  Ann Rutherford, often seen as Andy Hardy's girlfriend Polly Benedict, does a fine job as the ghost of Christmas past (although the blonde hair gives her a very different look).  Others have pointed out that MGM cut and changed the story a good bit, but if you can overlook that, this is a nice, brisk telling of a great tale.

The extras on this disc are outstanding, although perhaps not as numerous as those for some modern movies.  The ""Christmas Carol"" trailer is especially interesting, because Lionel Barrymore appears in it to tout his friend Reginald Owen as Scrooge, apparently to help audiences get over their disappointment that Barrymore himself wasn't playing the role himself after appearing in it famously on radio.

The ""Christmas Carol"" disc includes ""Jackie Cooper's Christmas Party,"" in which the child star (""The Champ,"" ""Treasure Island"") hosts a party for his friends on an MGM soundstage, with Clark Gable, Marie Dressler, Wallace Beery, and other stars serving dinner for the kids.  (Look for a very amusing Santa Claus played by - well, I won't ruin the surprise.)  The disc also has a short film of young Judy Garland singing ""Silent Night"" with a choir, and the Oscar-nominated cartoon ""Peace on Earth"" (1939), which laments man's self-destructive warring instinct (and which was remade in the 50s as ""Good Will To Men"" - both with a message that's still directly relevant).

If you like this great movie, you may want to consider getting the excellent Classic Holiday Collection, which includes this film along with two other great classics, ""Christmas In Connecticut"" and ""Boys Town.""",1135209600,11,2818,4.993589743589744

My only frame of reference other than this film is ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"" and ""Scrooged"" with Bill Murray.  I can say that MGM pulled out all stops because this is a great looking film.  The film is well acted by a talented cast. This is a sincere effort and definitely not a cynical exercise on the part of the filmmakers.  If I would summarize this movie it's a more than competent film but falls short of classic status.  If it were on TV I wouldn't turn it off unless  ""It's a Wonderful Life"" was on another channel.  Nice extras on the disc make it a must.  Firstly, there's ""Jackie Cooper's Christmas Party"" featuring alot of MGM's contract players.  It's alot of fun if you're a film buff trying to spot the actors of yore.  Next, there's a too short clip of Judy Garland singing ""Silent Night"".  Lastly is the Oscar winning animated short, ""Peace on Earth"" made prior to the U.S. entry in World War II.

They are also too dark and depressing when it comes to the scenes about the third ghost. The cast in the 1938 version is perfect.

However the Ghost of Christmas past is played with far more joviality, Scrooges sister is much better as the younger version seen in this movie, I firmly believe that the Scrooge Character is more palatable than the one that Sims plays.

I never understood why Alastair Sims' 1951 version was heralded as the ultimate version; for me, it was too contrived, too melodramatic, and Sims chews up the scenery.

This 1938 version is a warmhearted take on Dickens' classic tale of greed and redemption. Bob Crachit's family is given a greater role than in the original novel, and the strength of the ensemble cast shines. Reginald Owen as Scrooge was a last-minute replacement, since Lionel Barrymore (Mr. Potter in ""It's a Wonderful Life"") was ill.

However, I'm stuck with a semi-defective VHS tape, patiently waiting for MGM/Warner to come to their senses and do right by those of us who love this movie. Not releasing this title on DVD seems to be the studio's way of acknowledging the inferiority of their release to the 1951 British production, which--at least to some of us--isn't the case. In fact, in some ways, this interpretation is much closer to the spirit of Dickens than the much darker and more complex later version--let's not forget that A Christmas Carol is a very short work, more novella than novel, really.
MGM knew how to mount a good Christmas production--let's see justice done to this one (including Lionel Barrymore's radio production, a la the recent Random Harvest release, would be nice). I'd like it to become a next-door neighbor to the other two Christmas Carols on my DVD shelf.

This 1938 version was the first big Hollywood version of the classic Dickens story and unfortunately it gives all the good and bad that Hollywood has to offer.  The movie stars Reginald owen as Scrooge and Gene and kathleen Lockhart as Bob and Mrs. Cratchit.  Thier real-life daughter June (of Lost in Space and lassie fame) even played one of the Cratchit daughters.

The movie's big budget is well on display with fantastic set pieces and costumes and a very proficient and likable cast that also included Ann Rutherford as the ghost of Christmas Past.  While I love Gene Lockhart I found him a bit too jovial as Bob Cratchit.

Owen's Scrooge is as mean as they come and looks among the most terrifying of any on-screen SCrooge with his bald head and wisp of gray hair adorning it.

The maing failing of the movie for me is its very heavy deviation from the original Dickens story.  For instance, in this version, bob Crachit, teaching some boys the best ways to make a snowball, throws one and knocks the hat off Scrooge.  The hat is then runover by a wagon.  Scrooge forces Crachit to pay for the hat and then fires him!

Of course, because he is fired, we do not get the payoff of Crachit coming in late to work the next day and finding the changed in attitude Scrooge.  Rather, Scrooge shows up at Cratchits house bearing food and gifts and the film ends there.  To me this was a totally unneeded change and just screams Hollywood destroying another classic book.

My mother died last year and when I get blue and need to remember why we should ALL enjoy every day and share joy every day and I need to feel the security and comfort of going to 'an old friend' even though it is a film, I find it as comforting as a hug from my mother.

Even a middle age woman of 50 can feel the magic of Christmas as vividly as a 5 year old when watching this wonderful film!!!

June Lockhart as an adult was the mom on the TV series ""Lassie"" and ""Lost in Space"".  My mother and grandmother told me they would listen to Lionel Barrymore in the days when families gathered by the RADIO -- Lionel made the story a Christmas classic.  When Lionel was injured and could not star in the movie Lionel hand picked Reginal Owen for this part. After seeing the film Lionel said Reginald Owen was the perfect Scrooge!

The 1951 version with Alastair Sims is far less faithful to the language and spirit of Dickens, mixing in large dollops of Freud and existentialism. Perhaps for that reason, it is invariably praised by critics.  This version, while taking some liberties with plot details and greatly compressing the story, has dialog that is often lifted directly from the original, and a tone that matches that of Dickens, though it does soften the darker side of the great author's depiction of poverty and want (this version is not alone in that respect).  Reginald Owen, a replacement as Scrooge after Lionel Barrymore's injury, portrays Scrooge's transformation with near perfection.  His depiction of Scrooge ""post-conversion"" can still make me cry; Alastair Sims' interpretation is far too ironic and self-referential ever to do that.  Critics may sneer, but this is #1.

392334,5,6301967275,"I have read several not so good reviews here of this, talking about bad acting and such, you must remember this was 1938, I consider this movie overall to be the best of the  Christmas Carol films, because the acting is great, it's just natural, I don't think they even seem to be acting, they are just being typical of 1938 and the times,less of everything, stores, ads, selling everything bad they have tunred Xmas into, was not even around then, it's a completely believable and natural environment for such a film.

And the fact that Gene Lockhart, uses his real Family in this, makes it even better, June Lockhart is in it, from Lost in Space fame and many other things, and also his real wife, and Scrooge is awesome, clearly the best ever, and Fred his Nephew, seems like such a good, honest man of his time, and the little girl that plays scrooges sister, is so sweet, and Bob, well Gene Lockhart, plays a perfect sincere honest father and husband, that although not so bright, is a good person.

And the Ghosts are very good, some of the ghosts in other Christmas Carol movies are good also, but as far as the people that say Alistair Sim is the best Scrooge, I think he sucks, he does seem like a very nasty man, but I don't like his attitude in the part, and well he is too nasty, and his tranformation to being good, stinks, he still seems nasty, Reginald owen makes a great transformation, and a believable one.

Get this movie and enjoy it's sincerity, back in a time when Xmas really was Christmas.

I remember THIS one and no other version will ever be able to replace it! I hope they decide to release it on DVD soon. Reginald Owen makes for a very believable Scrooge and his transformation from skinflint to human was played with great skill. I know from the many write-ups that Alistair Sim has a lot of fans who believe that he did the best job of playing Scrooge.

392336,5,6301967275,"This 1938 MGM adaptation of Dicken's ageless classic, ""A Christmas Carol,"" is absolutely hands down the best version out of all the other movie versions that have been attempted, but unfortunately it is the least known of all.  This is a must see for those attempting to find the best Scrooge movie out there.  This is true, especially now that it has finally been released on DVD.

MGM's casting of Reginald Owen as the miserly Ebeneezer Scrooge in their 1938 production was the best decision they ever made.  He is a natural, and absolutely the most believable Scrooge I have ever witnessed.  Moreover, the screenplay helps him by cohesively flowing from one scene to the next, while at the same time continuing to reveal the most depth and christmas spirit within his character, as well as within all the other supporting characters.

Compared to all the other portrayals of Scrooge out there, Reginald Owens is the only actor who gives true love and meaning to his character.  This allows the viewer to actually witness Scrooge's frozen heart slowly melt away as the movie unfolds, to reveal a sincere and genuinly kind old man, who, in the end, actually wants to truly help his fellow human being.

Personally, I don't understand why the other reviewers applaud Simm's portrayal of Scrooge in a later version of this movie, as I found Simm's personality to be much too abrasive and a bit overacted [especially the scenes where he is laughing after he has supposedly found redemption].  However, in contrast to the poor acting by Simms, Reginald Owen's character is acted with an honest sincerity and love that grows deeper and deeper after each succesive visit from the three spirits of Christmas.  This allows his character to slowly transform into his new and redeemed self as each new scene unfolds.  You can actually feel his heart opening up to receive the Christmas spirit and love that is meant to be shared during the holiday season, which is something that the other less believable movie versions try to hold back until the very last visit from the spirit of Christmas future [but then it is much too late to be believable, or to be viewed as a sincere transformation].

Finally, this MGM version is the only adaptation that shows substantial interaction between Scrooge, his nephew, Fred, and Bob Crachit's family at the very end.  It is only through this in depth amends with Bob Crachit and his entire family, that a sincere sense of completion is created.  For example, Scrooge actually gives some indication of what will transpire in the very near future for Crachit, for his sons, and for his nephew, Fred, who he names as his new business partner.  I found a similar sense of a fulfulling conclusion to be lacking in the other movie versions.  For all these reasons, I thoroughly recommend this 1938 MGM version of ""A Christmas Carol.""",1078531200,18,2857,4.823770491803279

It is fine for children to watch.  The film starts and ends with the song ""Silent Night"". This is the black & white 1938 film, Charles Dicken's ""A Christmas Carol"" with  Reginald Owen as ""Ebenezer Scrooge"".
  Scrooge is a hard working older man.  His nephew (Barry MacKay) is full of Christmas cheer, but Scrooge does not care for Christmas at all.  Christmas makes him angry. He doesn't want to hear about it.  ""Bah-Humbug""!  He doesn't like to give his loyal worker Bob Cratchit (Gene Lockhart) a Christmas day off, but he will.  Mr. Cratchit even has to ask for his wages.  At least Mr. Cratchit will spend Christmas with his family, his wife (Kathleen Lockhart) and five children, the youngest boy, ""Tiny Tim"" (Terry Kilburn) is crippled.
  Scrooge lives alone.  On this night, Christmas Eve, he thanks he saw his former work partner, Jacob Marley's face on the door knocker.  In fact, as Scrooge readies for bed at 10:00pm, he is visited by the ghost of marley (Lynne Carver).  He warns Scrooge he will be haunted by three spirits this night. At 1:00am, he is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past (Ann Rutherford).  She takes him on a journey to his past as a young boy (Ronald Sinclair).  At 2:00am, he is awaken  to see the Ghost of Christmas Present (Lionel Braham).  He shows Scrooge the way things really are.  And at 3:00am, he meets the Ghost of Christmas Future (D'Arcy Corrigan).
  Ann Rutherford next year would play ""Carreen O'Hara"" in Gone With The Wind (1939).  That is a young June Lockhart (Lassie, Lost In Space) as ""Belinda Cratchit"".  She says ""I know, I know.  Sausages!""  As of this writing, of the cast, Ann Rutherford, Terry Kilburn and June Lockhart are still with us and no doubt enjoying this classic they were in and will enjoy many Christmas Days to come.
Film runs 69 minutes.
Also available in color-computerized version.
  The computer-colorized version is a process that was used in the 1980's to add some color to an original black & white film.

392389,4,6301967275,"This 1938 film of Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" is the ""other"" version of the classic Yule time story, which is to say that when most people think of the great black & white version they have in mind the 1951 film with Alastair Sim.  The 1938 film stars Reginald Owen as Ebenezer Scrooge, and if it is not a great version of the tale it is still a solid effort.  Owen made over 100 films in his career, playing first Dr. Watson and then Sherlock Holmes in the early 1930s and ending his career as Admiral Boom in ""Mary Poppins"" and Commodore Dodds in ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks.""
Almost exclusively a character actor and supporting player throughout his career, he got to play Scrooge when a last minute replacement was needed for an ailing Lionel Barrymore, who had regularly performed the story as a radio play each Christmas (similar to Patrick Stewart's recent experience doing ""A Christmas Carol"" as a one-man show before doing the 1999 made for television version).  Barrymore suggested Owen for the role.  Of course, Barrymore would eventually play one of the greatest Scrooge-like characters when he was Old Man Potter in ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" but it was Owen who got his biggest share of cinematic immortality with this film, the oldest of the various versions of ""A Christmas Carol"" that is still worth catching.
From a production standpoint MGM's film is better than the 1951 black & white version, but the latter has Sim as the definite Scrooge and that makes all the different.  Still, Owen is more than competent in the role and his performance is distinguished from the rest in that he clearly enjoys being a mean one more than any other Scrooge.  In the early scenes, when Scrooge is able to give full vent to his feelings and before his ghostly start his spiritual rehabilitation, Owen makes this Scrooge the most detestable of them all.  The rest of his performance is solid, but the early stuff is his best, although I do like his line at the end to his stunned nephew that he appreciates how much difference a smile on his Uncle Scrooge's face makes.
The production values are pretty good for this 1938 film, which was a fairly big budget effort by MGM.  The most familiar faces are those of Leo G. Carroll, who plays a textbook Marley's Ghost (he would be the scientist whose experiment goes astray in ""Tarantula"" and Mr. Weatherby on television's ""Man From U.N.C.L.E""), and Ann Rutherford, who is the Ghost of Christmas Past (she would be Polly Benedict in the Andy Hardy series and Carreen O'Hara in ""Gone With the Wind"").  The final judgment is not that there is anything markedly wrong with this version of ""A Christmas Carol,"" but just that there are others that are better.  Still, fans of the story should make a point of checking this one out at some point during a future Holiday season.",1069286400,46,2826,4.6909090909090905
392390,5,6301967275,"A most worthy film to have in your essential classic holiday collection. Anyone who is a die-hard Scrooge-ophile should already have this. If you only like modern holiday tales, I'm not sure whether you'd like it. The acting, and production is very oldtime, so those who long for Christmas Past would enjoy this.

The MGM, 1938 version is one of the best Scrooge films, coming from a traditional holiday buff. The ones I have so far are: Scrooge (1935), Christmas Carol (1951), Scrooge (1970), Christmas Carol (1984) and the animated 2009 film.

I had hoped the animated one would have had a more complete story; all the versions have some vital storytelling missing.

The 1984 film with George C. Scott looked like television, so the budget wasn't very fat, and it was filmed in standard TV format.

I like the 1970 musical with Albert Finney, but it's musical. The film explored more about the relationship of Scrooge with Isabel, and added some footage beyond the grave with Ebby, which was fun, though, and the tunes are a little catchy.

Seymour Hicks played a really crotchety Scrooge in the 1935 version, and you see Bob Cratchit weep over Tiny Tim's lifeless body. But it seems too short.

Which leaves me with debating which Christmas Carol is better? The 1951 version, or this one?

I guess the 1951 film is a smidge better, but I still rate this five stars. Alastair Sim played a top notch Scrooge in 1951, better than Reginald Owen, here. We see the wandering spirits early on in the later film, and the '51 version also has a better music track. This film also ignores the relationship between Scrooge and Marley, and about the people who rummaged Scrooge's belongings after he passed on.

But the other characters make up for those flaws: I absolutely love watching Scrooge's nephew early on, in his jovial spirit, meeting the Cratchit cubs as they take a slide. Fred, Scrooge's nephew, really shines better here, as do all the Cratchit family, from Gene and Kathleen Lockhart, the real-life couple who play the parents of Tiny Tim, so much more humanly-played by Terry Kilburn. I think the supportive cast does a better job here, while Alastair Sim makes the best in his 1951 role. You really can do no wrong by getting both versions, because they have a different way of presenting this classic tale of greed and repentance. I just can't deduct a star from this, even though I think the '51 film is better. This just has too many moments and good supporting staff for me to deduct a star.",1064793600,,2504,4.700913242009133

And there is an overall stiffness and emotional understatement to this version -- Leo G. Carroll's Marley is a lack-lustre example.  All that said, it is still a fun movie, and none of the quirky strayings from Dickens detract from the thrust of the story -- the power of the Christmas message to transform even the hardest heart.

There is no sense of a man's redemption, and no drama or pathos in his confronting his past, present, or future.  The whole affair seems hasty, half-baked, and dashed off as though the cast, et al couldn't wait to be done with it.  Unlucky viewers will feel the same way.  The Alastair Sim version had its problems too (like a 5' 8"" Tiny Tim) but even with its numerous departures from Dickens' masterpiece, that  film creates a powerful mood and packs an emotional punch.  This version packs no punch. It's a crummy Hollywooden version of the best yuletide tale ever written.  Simply following the outline of Dickens' story, the film-makers could have at least made something watchable.  But  they knew better, and the result is a mash-mash of hokey acting, bad writing, and dreadful editing. Advice to those who actually watch this wretched howler as an annual tradition:  buy the book on Amazon.com.

Remember, the book has many more scenes and information, but MGM is who put it down in the nutshell we all know.  Even the special effects (i.e. Marley, etc) were all ""invented"" by the 1938 version.
Not only is the 1938 version the superior, but Reginald Owen is the better Scrooge.  Critics claim his performance is narrow, but I would argue that it is more focused as opposed to the borderline deranged interpretation of Scrooge by Alastair Sim.

This is the version I grew up with but every other version seems to have strength that this one doesn't.  I haven't seen the new Patrick Stewart one but the Alaster Sim and Geroge C. Scott versions are much better but also much heavier.
This one however is lighter than the others.  Owen doesn't seem down deep as nasty as the others, it is more of a playful film.  Short of the Muppet version I'd say the best for kids to start with.
Worth a watch.",1009152000,2,879,4.46875
392422,5,6301967275,"My family and I first saw this colorized version of ""A Christmas Carol"" back in the 1980's on television.  Since then, we have made it a yearly tradition in our home!  On Thanksgiving weekend, we pull this video out and watch it as a kind of  Christmas Season Kick-off!  We always end-up watching it again at least one other time...usually the week of Christmas!  Of all the versions out there, this one get's eight thumbs up from this family of four!  It has the look and feel of the Victorian Age! We love it, and you will too!!",1008720000,3,530,4.357142857142857
392423,3,6301967275,"A nice, short, family version of the Dickens classic. Good for the kiddies to introduce them to this great story. But for the purist, it has its shortcomings. First of all, Marley just speaks his part instead of wailing it (""Business? Mankind was my business."" Instead of ""BUS-A-NESS?!? Man-KIND was my BUS-A-NESSSS!!!"" like it should be). Bob Cratchit IS a bit too portly to be believably poor. And, I'm sorry to say, Kathleen Lockhart DOES over-act. Watch her as she sets the pudding down on the table. Also, Reginald Owen becomes converted just too darn quick to believe that he is supposed to be this mean, crusty old sinner as he's supposed to have been. As stated in previous reviews, there is more telling of the story here than actual portrayal of the story. Sort of like a Reader's Digest condensed version. Too bad the script writers wrote so many of their own scenes and changed Dickens' own 'staves,' too.
I will say this, though. This is the only version I have seen that explains about the Cratchit's goose being cooked at the bakery, to be picked up at an appointed time on Christmas Day. Many poor people in Victorian England did just that since their homes had too small of an oven or no ovens at all.
My advice is to purchase the George C. Scott, Alistair Sim, and even the Patrick Stewart versions first (although, the Patrick Stewart writers have also added their own scenes as well - but not quite as dramatically as this version) to get a more accurate portrayal of not only Dickens' original story, but Victorian London as a whole. Contrary to what another reviewer has stated, it IS the little things that count!
This is not a God awful version. Rather, a mediocre one that has its moments.
By the way, Scrooge's sister's name was FAN not Fran (as in Reginald Owens' and Patrick Stewart's Version).",1007856000,2,1822,4.643962848297214
392424,5,6301967275,I think that this is the best version of Dickens A Christmas Carol. I think it is much much better that the version that stars Alstair Sims. If you want to get the feel of the season then get this version.,976665600,4,205,4.024390243902439
392425,5,6301967275,"There are four SCROOGE movies that we own to enjoy the Christmas Season: 1.) with Alistair Sim - - for a dramatic, eerie feel. Look for the ghost of  Marley Star Wars Fans - - Obi Wan? 2.) Reginald Owen - - this is swift  Scrooge tale that doesn't scare the boohoogies off the kiddies. Scrooge is  portrayed as a glum, bitter hermit that is in love with wealth and who  finds a new chamber in his heart of cares. 3.) Albert Finney - - musical  Scrooge. The snappy tunes and melodies are great.  4.) SCROOGED - - Bill  Murray. This is a comedy / modern day / Scrooge. We love them all!",968889600,,584,4.115044247787611
392426,5,6301967275,"This version is geared to lift our spirits by giving us the most upbeat and delightful Fred, and Bob Crachit of any version ever made.  Although the 1951 (Alastair Sim) is my favorite, I strongly recommened this version.  Gene Lockhart gives a delightful performance as Bob Crachit, along with  his  wife who plays his on screen spouse, Mrs. Crachit and his daughter  June (making her debut) playing his on screen offspring.  I do recommened,  however; the colorized version.  It enhances the quality.  A must own for  all true fans of the classic tale.",946339200,,553,4.849462365591398
