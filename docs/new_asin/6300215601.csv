247193,4,6300215601,"This film is a bit of a mess, but nevertheless very entertaining, mostly because of Audrey Hepburn...her charisma and enthusiasm make up for a lot of the muddled and mixed performances that surround her in this star-studded production of Tolstoy's masterpiece.
Hepburn's then real life husband, Mel Ferrer, does a pretty good job as Prince Andrei and Henry Fonda is Pierre, who despite sounding like ""Young Mr. Lincoln"", gives a convincing performance, and has several fine scenes. Nino Rota's score is a curious one, as the beautiful Italian-flavored melodies we're accustomed to hear from him are replaced by Russian folk tunes and battlefield music.
Perhaps too many big names and too many writers (6 of them !) made the heart of the book get lost, but this is Audrey's movie, and she's a delight to watch.",998524800,25,809,4.955882352941177
247194,5,6300215601,"Well, looks like ever-lovin' Moscow is being attacked again! And man does it look good! Unfortunatly, Audrey Hepburn is really the only redeaming character in this movie. Have you ever bit you tongue really hard, and then for the next two hours, you are constantly bitting it as you try to eat? That's what movies like 'Mission: Imposible 2' and 'Solo' are like. The first tape of this piece however, is not near as bad as any of those brutal movies. The second tape is like getting your mollars removed. Not Audrey's best, But still has a certain production value. Even if watching it by your self can lead to boul movment faliure. A must see. Big Truck",985651200,4,654,4.5508474576271185
247195,3,6300215601,"I adore Audrey Hepburn in all of her movies, but even she couldn't make WAR AND PEACE entertaining enough to keep my interest through one much less two tapes. Now, this is not an opinion based on lack of attention span since GONE WITH THE WIND is one of my favorite movies. Tolstoy's story is simply dry and confusing no matter the format.",977011200,3,339,4.396825396825397
247196,4,6300215601,"THIS movie is a typical Hollywood production. Highly entertaining but the too familiar faces detract. Production good. However, I have never been a big fan of Audrey Hepburn as an actress (adore her as a person). She was  the right look for Natasha. The suffering of Russia didn't come forward.  The Russia version made me feel the agony of war.
I know I will not find  many that agree with me. I gave this movie 4 stars simply because of its  entertainment value.",945216000,12,464,4.554216867469879

247309,3,6300215601,"I am finally getting around to reading ""War and Peace,"" after being frightened off by its length for all of my literary life.  What a wonderful read!  So now I'm viewing video versions, none of which I have ever watched before.  Audrey Hepburn is a wonderful Natasha, but as much as I love Henry Fonda's acting, it's hard to square him with the Pierre In Tolstoy's novel.  Paul Dano in the recent video version is a wonderful choice and presents a very believable Pierre.  So far I also prefer the recent, lengthier version over this one since it doesn't skimp as much on the side-stories for Nicholas and Mary (and Mary in this version is far too Hollywood-pretty).  Nevertheless, it's fun to see lovely, young Ms. Hepburn doing what she does so well.  I've yet to view the 15-hr version with Anthony Hopkins.",1509667200,,810,4.6223776223776225

247416,5,6300215601,"***SPOILERS***
I feel like this is an interpretation Tolstoy would have enjoyed. I don't even think ""interpretation"" really applies because it was so spot-on. I've seen criticisms for unnecessary scenes of sex and violence and it's true that had a rating been applied it would have to be MA, but nothing was added that the book did not actually describe in detail or allude to. I think a lot of people have this romantic idea of W&P as a beautiful fairy tale but there was a lot of dirty grittiness that was heavily veiled because of the literal censures of the times. If you didn't catch it the first time, read it again? The incest, adultery, dueling, war wounds, botched abortion, it's all in there. I've watched this again and again and fast forward through the sex, I'm not a fan of watching it on-screen personally so I feel like they got a little carried away but otherwise I adore this production. The score, it's the most beautiful I've ever heard. The costumes are superb. The casting- wow. You know how when you've read a book your entire life you get really attached to these characters and you imagine they should look and sound and move? Now here they are, on screen, just like you imagined them! It's brilliant. Every single last character- Andre is stoic, Pierre is hilariously awkward, Maria is heartwarmingly ""beautiful on the inside"" but somehow still pretty but somehow still not... Nikolai is perfectly Nikolai-ish! Dolokhov is an adorable scoundrel, everyone is just perfect... Except for Lily James.  But she grew on me. She wasn't supposed to be blond, for one thing, and she always has her mouth hanging open, but she does have this childish playfulness that is very Natasha-like, I think it worked out well. Anyway, this whole thing is so good that before I'm even partway through I want to stop and start it all over again. That's how great it is. In fact I'm going to go watch it right now.",1495065600,,1918,4.657817109144543
247417,4,6300215601,"Good product.  It is as challenging to follow as the book is, so I'll have to re-watch a couple more times maybe.  Henry Fonda is a great actor, but his American accent is distracting.",1494892800,,184,4.382352941176471

(oh yeah) the movie was long as was the book,  Because of the excellent acting I liked the unfolding of the story (story within a story) I love period stories that take one to another time in history it was all of that. I will not speak about the lives that unfolded,The war scenes toward the end were well done and pretty accurate from a novices point of view it is well known that Hitler got a very large dose of the same mud, snow ice, extreme freezing, unprepared.  It was not noted that Napoleon had two choices of retreat from Russia he picked the worst one. (Yeah I did read a little history somewhere.) It is recorded that out of over 200,000 man army little more or less than 30,000 got back alive. The fighting and retreat was was a big splash toward the end of an interesting story.

247528,4,6300215601,"On major works of world literature what should a thoughtful person do first-read that classic work, even if as in the case of the film adaptation under review of Leo Tolstoys War and Peace the novel runs to a thousand closely-spaced pages, or the film adaptation where, as here, it is available in some version. Well, I think naturally that one should read the book first, or as here, slug through the book but maybe I am old-fashioned about books in the digital age and younger reviewer would reverse the order. Each way this is a must read or see.

Of course most people know that Tolstoys master work was his take on the battles royal between Napoleon and his French Revolution-derived armed forces and new ideas and old serf-ridden Mother Russia, his homeland back in the early 19th century when the figure of Napoleon struck fear or delight in most of Europe. Tolstoys take here is that good the old despotic Czarist order needed defending against the invaders from the West whatever his later more pacifistic notions might be. History is a funny mistress and so it very much depends on which side of the political spectrum you are on how you see the figure of Napoleon and of the after effects on the French Revolution on the historical process. Most leftists, including later Russian leftists, sensed a liberating mission, maybe distorted, but liberating nevertheless by Napoleons push to Russia (which as with the French Revolution would presumably free the endlessly soiling peasants). Obviously the novel takes a different tact and certainly the film paints Napoleon as nothing but a low-rent invader of sweet Mother Russia stirring the blood of every Russian patriot even those few who had sympathy for the French Revolution.

Well that is the historic slant part because what this film is about beyond the various umpteen battles with Napoleon is an old-fashioned coming of age romance, and about thwarted romance if you think about it. Here against that military campaign backdrop one Countess Rostov, played by angelic Audrey Hepburn in her ingnue days, Prince Andre, a Russian military officer as well as noble played by Mel Ferrer and Pierre, a civilian intellectual and inheritor of a landed estate, played by Henry Fonda go through a long process of both longing for love and being thwarted in that quest by the various turns of military fortune and personal obstacles.

In the end, as at the beginning, it will be whoever is left standing, and the Countess and Pierre will finally be the two after more trials and tribulations than you could shake a stick at including Pierres marriage to an unfaithful wife, the Countess infatuation with neer-do-well Army officer, her devotion to the widowed Prince Andre before he passed away from his mortal wounds, and Pierres captivity as a prisoner of the French Army love will out, love as life will out. Oh yeah, and those monumental battles with a cast of thousands which take up the rest of the film act as filler for this epic. By the way if you are going to watch this one end to end better have plenty of popcorn at hand since it is over three and one-half hours long. And by all means take a few weeks and read the literary classic to get the other story lines of the minor characters who are left out of the film.",1473033600,,3281,4.742556917688266

Henry Fonda was Ok, but not one of his best roles.  I stopped watching it half way though and fast forward it to certain scenes, but they too were disappointing.

No way should the biggest fan of this movie even give it 4 stars. It's an awful adaptation of War and Peace, barely watchable.  Miscast, poorly written by a clown-car 6 writer team that thought they could outwrite Tolstoy in a fraction of the space. It's been better adapted several times on Blu-ray.  The best is the 2016 version on the BBC.  This King Vidor version is the WORST version of War and Peace on Blu-ray.  Even the rightfully forgotten 2007 miniseries version was way better.

247821,5,6300215601,"Forget that this is War and Peace and just enjoy it as an excellent Hollywood movie.  If you want something that approximates Tolstoy's War and Peace, then check out the Russian adaptation made in 1968.  The 1956 Hollywood version is under-appreciated; the 1968 Russian version is over-praised.  It's a pity that we couldn't have the heart of the 1956 version and the intelligence of the 1968 wrapped up in the same film.

The solution:  If you want Tolstoy's War and Peace, then read it.  It's a long novel, but it not a difficult novel. But as far as movies go, the Hollywood treatment works well.

A few years have passed since I wrote the above review.  I liked the film even better on a third viewing.  It's not Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace, but it's a good movie.  Think of it as another Gone With the Wind.  Maybe this War and Peace only deserves 4 stars, but Audrey Hepburn always rates an extra star or two.",1447632000,2,915,4.451807228915663

I enjoyed John Mills short appearance, he was a great actor.  Henry Fonda was 50 when he made this movie and sometimes he seemed tired in his acting.  Audrey Hepburn as always brings life to the movie and every scene she is in.  Even when she is supposed to be sad she brings the scenes alive.

248097,3,6300215601,"This, acclaimed director's King Vidor's last feature length film, was an ambitious recreation of Tolstoy's epic novel. Until the Russians made their own even more epic production (over 6 hours!) to commemorate the Russian revolution, employing the Soviet military to reproduce huge Napoleonic battles, this Carlo Ponti international production was the go-to dramatization of the classic novel. It's hard to distill a mammouth novel like War and Peace into about three hours, but Vidor is largely successful. The Russian version directed by Sergei Bondarchuk fills out the gaps better, captures Tolstoy's pacifistic philosophical underpinnings better and is immeasurably more visually spectacular, but this 1956 version was a pretty big show for the time. By today's standards, the movie is paced a bit slowly, but the cast is mostly up to the job, except for Henry Fonda who sounds just too mid western American to be a Russian count.
This biggest disappointment for me is the transfer. War and Peace was originally filmed in VistaVision and should look much sharper and clearer on blu ray. Presumably Paramount no longer possesses the original elements because this edition looks as soft and dull as the previous DVD release. Also, the film was released in 1956 in ""Perspecta"" stereo sound. If you have seen (heard) the blu rays of Gigi or White Christmas, you get an idea of the fidelity we are missing in this release, which is dull and boxy monaural. Hopefully one day better elements will be discovered and someone will give this film the restoration it deserves. The same holds true for King Vidor's early Cinemascope epic, A Farewell to Arms--not a great film, but notable and spectacular enough to warrant some extra TLC.",1427846400,,1729,5.113074204946996

The film script had to be condensed because of the length of the original work (over 1,000 pages) and in the film, we focus mainly on Count Pierre Bezukhov (Henry Fonda), Natasha Rostova (Audrey Hepburn) and Prince Andrei Bolkonsky (Mel Ferrer). In terms of relation to the novel - this is a very, VERY abridged version, leaving out so much, but as a Hollywood love story and tale of growth and maturation against the backdrop of the historical events of the Napoleonic invasion and movement through Russia, it entertains.

248325,4,6300215601,"As with most literary adaptations, it is fundamentally pointless to speculate on the extent to which King Vidor's memorable movie either departs from or reproduces the themes and style of Tolstoy's source-text.  Film and literature are fundamentally different media and should be treated as such.

What is perhaps more suggestive is to look at this version of WAR AND PEACE in its context of production.  Napoleon (Herbert Lom) has the desire to invade Russia and hence expand the scope and range of the French Empire, just like Hitler had imagined fifteen years before the film's release.  Initial success was followed by ultimate failure, as the Russians, spearheaded in the film by Field Marshal Kutzorov (Oscar Homolka), fight a war of attrition, eschewing direct combat in favor of occasional guerrilla raids.  Napoleon cannot understand his opponents' behavior: no one will come to sign an official surrender.  Eventually he is forced to withdraw, and his troops have to complete a 3000+ kilometer journey out of Russia while enduring the exigencies of winter.  With little or no capacity for resistance, they are easily overrun by Dolokhov (Helmut Dantine) and his forces.  Vidor's film offers a powerful denunciation of dictators, who are often so crazed with ambition that they have little or no concern either for military logistics or for the welfare of their forces.  Napoloeon, like Hitler, gets what he deserves.

Yet WAR AND PEACE is equally critical of the Russian side.  Natasha Rostova (Audrey Hepburn) inhabits a bourgeois society where outward show matters: as in many latter-day Austen adaptations, most members of her class spend their time trying to see and be seen at balls.  Vidor includes several dance-sequences that might be pretty to look at, but suggest the trivialities of the Russian world; even though the French army are drawing nearer and nearer, no one seems to be taking any notice.  Eventually her lover Prince Andrei Bolkonsky (Mel Ferrer) is sent away to the front and discovers the realities of life.  Natasha has a brief fling with another man, but comes to discover the realities of life when she and her family are forced to evacuate Moscow to avoid being annihilated.

The film contains some spectacular battle-sequences, no more so when the French and Russian forces meet, and Pierre Bezukhov (Henry Fonda) tours the Russian battle-lines and discovers to his cost just how hellish the world of combat can be.  Having been taken prisoner by the French, he is marched back to France with the departing forces, where he meets a fellow-prisoner Platon Karataev (John Mills) and discovers a way to survive even in a world seemingly crashing to destruction around him.

WAR AND PEACE contains a happy ending of sorts, as Pierre and Natasha reunite after several years apart, but the scene of utter destruction facing them makes it a pyrrhic happiness.  The only way they can survive - as the film reminds us in a title-card taken from Tolstoy's novel - is to love life itself, and accept all that it can throw at us with equanimity.  This might have seemed a rather optimistic message during the mid-Fifties, at a time when US-Soviet relations were lukewarm, to say the least, but it still holds sway today.

Vidor's film is extremely long, but sustains our attention throughout.  Definitely worth watching if time and attention permit.",1414972800,6,3376,5.046846846846847

Haven't seen the uncut version but did see the two part dubbed U.S. release which is very impressive BUT I'll still prefer the U.S.-Italian release. The cinematography is stunning in the VistaVision format and Nino Rota's score outstanding. For me Audrey Hepburn IS Natasha and lights up the screen with her performance. Henry Fonda, Mel Ferrer, Herbert Lom, John Mills, Oscar Homoka and Vittorio Gassman all bring their characters vividly to life. Being familiar with the Vidor film was a great help when I tackled the reading of Tolstoy's massive novel. I would give the film a FIVE STAR rating but give the Blu-ray Import release FOUR STARS. It plays just fine on U.S. machines and looks very sharp -- but it doesn't compare to Paramount's Blu-ray releases of Hepburn's BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S or FUNNY FACE which are both stunning. The WAR & PEACE Blu-ray is an upgrade from the DVD (which is actually very nice) but as it has nothing in the way of extras and the import price is on the high side I would say this is worth the purchase if you are a real fan of the film.

248477,3,6300215601,"Academy award nominations: Director-King Vidor, Costume Design and Cinematography.

March boy nominations: Cinematography, Costume Design, Set Design and Original Score.

Wins: Leading Actress-Audrey Hepburn and Supporting Actor-Herbert Lom.

King Vidors War and Peace is just one of those nutty campy movies that grab me. I would by no means call it a terrific or groundbreaking piece of cinema but I think it is well worth watching nonetheless.
 Some of the acting is as professional cineastes have said, less than perfect. Henry Fonda (Pierre) seems more American country farmer than European aristocrat, Mel Ferrer (Prince Andre) has a tendency to stare off in space and say his lines in a harsh, flat monotone (he does get better towards the end, though, especially when hes with Audrey Hepburn) Jeremy Brett (Nicholas) says some of his lines a little too fast and Anita Ekbergs blond bimbo wife Helene is syrupy and supremely annoying (although it is somewhat appropriate given the extreme unlikableness of the character) but what makes this movie special is the intelligence and overall scope of the scripthow it summarizes one of the longest novels Ive ever read and does full justice to the plot. There are several scenes right out of the book; Natasha on the balcony, declaring her love for Andre, Pierres duel with Fyodor Dolokov, (He even says I don't know how to use this gun. Show me. I just forgot) Natasha begging Andre and Pierres forgiveness, the deathbed vigil in the monastery, etc.)

Purists of classic literature (like Jane Eyre, Sense and Sensibility, etc.) who complain about movies not putting in every little detail of the book are not using their heads. Literature and film are two very different mediums of art. The purpose of a book is to add detail and richness (every incidental, unnecessary subplot and peripheral character) to the story; the purpose of a movie is to summarize, to keep everything brief, concise and to the point. If you try to cram ever little detail you usually end up with a very boring movie.

There are some good strong supporting performances mostly from Oscar Homolka as the elderly general Kutuzov and Helmut Dantine and Vittorio Gassman as the libertine soldiers, Fyodor and Anatole. Gassman is extremely handsome and simply oozes roguish charm and masculinity; I could feel the hairs of the back of my neck stand up when hes stalking Audrey Hepburn at the party. John Mills is warm and endearing as the Christian prisoner Pierre makes friends with near the end of the film.

Best of all though, is Herbert Loms energetic characterization of Napoleon Bonaparte who delivers his lines with just the right amount of wit, spark and dramatic flourish. He has the scariest eyes, especially towards the end when he says the title of my review.

I wish Audrey Hepburn had won an Academy award for Natasha Rostov in War and Peace instead of Princess Ann in Roman Holiday. Her performance in this movie was actually an improvement on her ingnue roles in her previous romantic comedies because she got to play a more complex character. She does so much with the soft, soothing sound of her voice and her subtle facial expressions. What I love best about her performance is that she doesnt sanctify her character. She can be silly, annoying and say a lot of nonsense but what makes her special is how she endears herself to her family and three suitors; how she slowly grows in a wiser and more sensible woman; the number of lessons she learns throughout the film such as maturity, constancy, responsibility and being wise in matters of the heart.

And her character transformation doesnt just happen all of a sudden like a light turned on and off. Yes, Pierre saving her from Anatole is a major wake-up call for her but there are still several shades of gray throughout the first half of the film (as opposed to just black and white) that foreshadow the fully accomplished woman that is to come, like:
1. When she tells Pierre at the beginning she would vote for him for Prime Minister because his heart is pure.
2. When she goes down the stairs right before Andres proposal. Her off-screen voice says Is it possible that I Natasha am to become the wife of this strange, dear clever man whom even my father looks up to? Can it be true that now I am grown up (and here come the kicker line) and on me lies the RESPONSIBILTY OF MY EVERY WORD AND DEED?
3. Anatole dancing with her alone after she has entered the engagement with Andre. He declares his love for her. She gets an uneasy look on her face and runs out of the room begging her father to take her home. Even though shes still the silly, nave, namby pamby twit, at this point, she senses something is not rightshe has given this man too much attention.

Hepburn has so many terrific moments like the tense, disturbing interactions with Anatole, the final scene where her face radiates with joy now that Pierre has come back and that scene where shes crying uncontrollably and begging Pierres forgiveness for trying to elope with Anatole just slays me every time. I have no problem with Ingrid Bergman winning Best Leading Actress for her broad, grand, showy turn in Anastasia but its a crying shame Audrey Hepburn didn't even get nominated.

Nino Rotas music contains rich, beautiful, pseudo classical melodies. Jack Cardiffs shot composition is superbrich shades of earth and flesh tones, gray, tan, brown and green. My favorite shot is when Prince Andre dies. The monastery is very simple and stoicgreyish white walls, a dark brown floor and arches in the back with radiant shafts of reddish orange light. Ive never really cared for Mel Ferrers cold, detached style but in that one scene he really gives a great performance. The gentle, wistful, airy way he gives his final speech always gets to me. I had a wonderful dream. I dreamt that I died. I saw an open door with light shining from it. Then I awoke. Yes, death is an awakening. You see? Its all so simple.

What I like about King Vidors direction is how he doesnt opt for slicked up costumes and sets. Hes not afraid to make the Rostovs mansion simple and elegant and the interiors of the Moscow invasion scenes dirty, gritty and realistic.

I recommend this movie. It definitely has its flaws (hence my three star rating) but there is still much to admire and enjoy.",1399334400,6,6332,4.7611668185961715

Audrey Hepburn, Henry Fonda both great actors in this fil.",1346889600,,114,4.75
248723,4,6300215601,"Audrey Hepburn is incandescent in this movie. She seems like a silly, if charming, child at the beginning, and a wise but still charming woman grown at the end. In between is 208 minutes (nearly 3 1/2 hours) of grand scope. Lavish sets and locations, marvelous costumes, magnificent actors, and of course a towering story. Henry Fonda and Mel Ferrer are both worthy of the love lavished on them.

Yes, with 3 1/2 hours of Russian intensity, it can get tedious at times. But the basic story is of the Emperor Napoleon's ill-fated invasion of Russia. The Russians fall back and fall back, leaving nothing but burned countryside behind them, all the way to Moscow. Napoleon is furious when there is no one left in Moscow to surrender to him. His ego is bruised beyond repair. Eventually he realizes that winter is coming and he'd better get back to France. But of course, it's a very, very long march, and the snows catch him. The Russian Army did very little; Mother Russia and her snow did it all.

The story is as much about complex romantic situations as about the war. Like Scarlett O'Hara (but with much more class), Natasha returns to her ruined home, determined to rebuild her home and her family and her life. In fact, this movie has a great deal in common with Gone With the Wind, a fact which may have occurred to others before me. I'm a bit slow at times.

I read the book and wanted to see the movie because my favorite actress, Audrey Hepburn, starred in it. This time I wanted to see it from the viewpoint of an adult who is intensely interested in history, and still thinks Audrey Hepburn was the best actress ever. Lots of Hepburn in this film, and lots of romantic interest along with the war action. During the battle scene, which was almost dreamlike in a way with Henry Fonda walking through it as a non-soldier, to see what war was really all about, I felt as if I were there. As old as the technology was, that battle scene seemed real to me. I felt the fear of seeing all of the troops assembling for battle. That was well done.

Toward the end of the movie, the scenes of the battles were amazing! I've never seen anything like it. Yes, some of the acting is typical for the time in which the movie was made but, if you think about it, the real events would have seemed 'dated' if we were able to view them as they happened.

The clothes and settings were magnificent. It was a pleasure watching these top-of-the-line actors portraying the characters in this classic novel.

248725,5,6300215601,"I recently read this epic novel by Leo Tolstoy, all 1350 pages of it.  I loved it and consider it one of the greatest books of all time.  Therefore, I must say I was skeptical about any movie based on the book but I was willing to give this 1956 version a chance.  Frankly, I was delightfully surprised.  This 3-1/2 hour film captured the essence of the book.  The sets and costumes were great, the battle sequences expertly captured, and the actors all did a fantastic job of giving depth to the characters.

Set in the early 19th Century in Russia, Audrey Hepburn is cast as Natasha, an impetuous aristocratic young woman.  She plays her role like a breath of fresh air and is so pretty that it was hard to take my eyes off her.  There is a great ballroom scene where she meets and falls in love with Prince Andrei, played by Mel Ferrer, who is a titled widower who wants to marry her immediately. However, his father insists the couple wait a year because she is so young.  During that time a flirtation with another man leads to a dissolution of the relationship.  Another important character is Pierre, played by Henry Fonda, an illegitimate son of a wealthy aristocrat who unexpectedly inherits a fortune and makes a bad marriage to a avaricious and unfaithful wife.

In the meantime, war is coming to Russia in the shape of Napoleon's army.  Prince Andrei goes to war. And Pierre, even though he is not a soldier, experiences the battlefield.  Eventually Napoleon enters Moscow.  Everyone flees, include Natasha and her family and these scenes capture the essence of the horror of war and its effect both on the soldiers and on the populace.

Of course, not all the details of the literary masterwork can be captured in a film.  However, I hardly realized it as I let myself get caught up in the fine story, the pageantry of the settings and the very excellent acting.  If you loved the book, you'll love this film.

(For accuracy go to the Anthony Hopkins BBC production or the Sergei Bodnerchuck versions.) But give this a shot too.",1251331200,2,524,4.46875
248780,4,6300215601,"I was tempted to title this 'Tolstoy for Dummies"" but that would have been too mean.  In truth, I did not buy this film, but found it, free at the public library.  So I can't complain too much.

I was a bit surprised (shocked?) at the cast...Henry Fonda?  Mel Ferrer?
But it was free and so I watched it one summer night when I didn't have anything else to do.  Low expectations make for happy surprises.  Henry Fonda has the most American, nasal, reedy, accent but after a while I could get past that as he did a good job of playing the sincere, good Pierre who goes from being a philosopher who stands back from the action of life to one who enters the realm of love and war and learns a lot.  Fonda is always good at playing ""sincere"" in any culture.

Audrey Hepburn shines as Natasha, whose luminous charm lights up the screen as her presence lightens the lives of those around her.  One of the best scenes in the film is the ball where Natasha dances almost magically, while her Prince Charming, Andrei, watches transfixed.  It's her first ball, her first love and she is full of beauty and the love of love.  Hepburn, trained as a classical ballerina, is just perfect here.
I admit I got a bit tired of her by the end, though.  Her particular brand of quixotic charm palled a bit after three hours.

Mel Ferrer, Hepburns' real life husband at the time, is ok for the part.  We don't see a lot of him, which is probably just as well, as his acting ability seems rather limited to looking handsome.

I loved the small bit of John Mills as the philosophical peasant.  He seemed to embody Tolstoy's philosophy of life and I wish we'd seen more of him.  His was, frankly, the only death I really mourned.

When you think that this was made in Hollywood in the 50's, it's not so bad.  I would prefer something deeper, more Russian, more philosphical, but for that I'll have to look elsewhere.",1248566400,5,1892,4.369627507163324

Tolstoy depicts polite Russian society and how its world is ripped apart by Napoleon's ambition. Henry Fonda plays the bumbling, intellectual Pierre. Audrey Hepburn is the naive Natasha. Swede Anita Ekberg, dripping with sex, is Helene. As an astronomy buff, my favorite scene is Pierre observing the comet of 1812. Its tail was long and luminous. While many people in those days believed comets to be bad omens, Pierre sees its beauty and feels a kinship with it. To Pierre, the comet represents hope. Jean Louis Pons discovered the comet in July. It was visible through September.",1203638400,3,753,4.890625

This Tolstoy's classic is wonderfully played by Audrey Hepburn as Natasha, a young woman who experiences the hardships of war. Henry Fonda provides a great performance as he lives through and observes Napoleon's invasion.

The Russian General, who retreats, and refuses to engage in battle, waiting for the winter to become his ally is superbly played and provided a chance to discuss strategy and books, such as the Art of War. The insight gained was excellent.

The battle scenes leave a sense of desolation, and as Napoleon retreats, we were able to discuss how Russia has benefited from a harsh winter as the defense against intruders.

Highly recommend watching this film.",1196035200,,856,4.923611111111111
248826,3,6300215601,"I guess I am a purist when it comes to the classics. I like the movie script to follow the original work which I am sorry to say this movie does not. From the first scene in the movie, it is almost like they took extracts from all of the book's events and rearranged the entire timeline. Some of the scenes never happened, others did not happen as they were portrayed, there are many lines in the movie which never were uttered by any of Tolstoy's characters and to me the choices of actors for some of the roles were very misguided. Who in their right mind would choose Henry Fonda as Pierre (he sounds like he is from Kansas). Pierre was described all through Tolstoy's epic as being fat, slovenly, very large, etc., wide of girth. Though Henry Fonda was a very fine actor, they seemed to have missed their mark. There were many such misses.

Of course, the scenery and the action shots are also very dated. But if the script had followed Tolstoy's work, I would have been happy; but it did not.

The only saving grace was of course Audrey Hepburn who to me was a perfect Natasha. I wish that they had had a younger actress playing the younger Natasha who plays with dolls but they only used Miss Hepburn for the entire sequence of events.

Ms. Hepburn was wonderful in this role, beautiful and so full of life. I think that she and Mel Ferrer were the two (2) jewels of this film and at the time I believe they were actually married.

I think as a true depiction and adaptation of Tolstoy's masterpiece this movie production failed. But as an entertaining and whimsical portrayal of extracts of this fine book and as pure entertainment with some very fine actors even if it was sadly a broad detour from the book itself, I would give it three stars for the efforts of Ferrer and Hepburn alone.

Be forewarned if you are counting on an accurate depiction of the book. It is just the Hollywood version with all of its literary liberties fully exploited.  But at least enjoy the beauty of Hepburn and her wonderful charisma.

No one can in a million years could believe Henry Fonda as a Russian in the 19th Century or any century for that matter.  John Wayne or Gary Cooper might as well been cast in the role of Pierre.  I doubt if anyone would have noticed.  Where was Laurence Olivier?  He would have been a perfect Pierre.  Other than the miscasting, this movie is strong in just about every other respect.  The battle scenes are superb, some of the best in cinema history.  However, the soldiers didn't seem to object to Fonda's presence at the battle outside of Moscow.  It's surprising that no one told him to get out of the line of fire.  Napoleon's retreat from Russia is also very unforgettable.

Mel Ferrar comes off best of the bunch. He is well cast in historical drama and the charcter he plays is suited to his personal style.  Anita Ekberg is also extremely well cast, but seems to be poorly dubbed.  Her non verbals are excellent. The story is sweeping, the costumes beautiful.

Too bad so much time, money and energy was spent on such a ""calvacade of stars"" cast.  The best scenes were thanks to the cinematographer & lighting.  UGH.  What a tremendous disappointment.

I held out some hope for the battle scenes but, again, disappointment.

If you want to see a brilliantly-done War And Peace DVD, watch the Russian one (subtitled) and forget this cumbersome Hollywood Juggernault of a film. Here it is:

248832,4,6300215601,"It's odd that this movie runs three hours and twenty eight minutes and it's considered the short, condensed version of Tolstoy's literary masterpiece.  The novel is actually much better known and deserves to be.  As much I acknowledge King Vidor as the one of the pioneer directors and a maverick who went his own way throughout his career, this movie is a bit of a disappointment.  After all, this is the same director who directed ""The Big Parade"", the anti war movie that launched MGM.

King Vidor was not your typical Texan.  Movies he made just before this was ""Duel in the Sun"" for Selznick and ""The Fountainhead"" written by Ann Rand.  This ""War and Peace"" was made in Italy and was produced by Dino deLaurentis.  Vidor and six other writers had the tast of condensing Tolstoy's classic, eliminating major subplots and streamling the storylines of the three protangonists.

The main protangonist in the book is Pierre Bezahov, here played by Henry Fonda.  In 1968, Sergie Bondachuk played Pierre and wrote and directed a nine hour and much better movie than this one.  Sergie even looked more like the book Pierre.  Fonda could have played him more accurately, after all, he made ""The Wrong Man"" around the time and he was no longer a spring chicken.  But here, he's dashing even when he wins a duel literally by accident. However, he does his best work when forced to walk as a prisoner to the French.  He shows dignity in such adject conditions.

Audrey Hepburn should have been perfect as Natasha and at times, is.  However, it's not very convincing that she's just a naive little girl in the beginning and a woman who's been though a lot at the end.  Not that's not her fault.  Vidor with makeup artists, etc. should have created that illusion.  In fact, the story is supposed to take seven years and this movie doesn't convince us of that at all.

Mel Ferrer was Audrey's leading man offscream but he's missing the meloncholy about Andrei is supposed to project.  He does have passible good looks and be standoffish but not really much else.

However, he and Andrey do look well together and she also has excellent rapport with Fonda.  Herbet Lom plays an interesting Napolean.  Anita Ekberg looks beautiful and is not asked to do much else.

The battle scenes are very well done and there is good levity when Fonda appears as a spectator.  Ferrer's death scene is way too long and a bit unforgivable as some interesting bits of Tolstoy could have gone in.

Tolstoy's musing about life are basically unfilmable but something could have gone in.  Instead, the movie ends with Henry and Natasha reunited. However, the main parts of the basic story were covered.

I just wish it had more the transcendance that the ending of ""The Crowd"" did.  For that, I guess read the book.",1174348800,6,2783,4.6921487603305785

Fonda plods along as Pierre, Mel Farrier makes an effort to be the Byronic Hero that was Prince Andrei.  The production quailty is pretty good.  This is deffinitely more you romantic version of the story.  Battle scenes are pretty much limited to a fairly impressive, albeit short Borodino sequence.  The one gripe I have is that all French infantry are shown as Imperial Guard!! The Retreat scenes are not bad, and convey well how the Grande Army fell apart.

248913,4,6300215601,"Although often naive, even crude, the films of King Vidor were frequently distinguished by their sheer energy and forceful visual style... As his career progressed, his films became increasingly grand in terms of narrative scope and visual bravura...

Tolstoy and Vidor tell the epic story through a handful of major characters...

As Napoleon Bonaparte prepares to invade Russia, Pierre Bezukhov (Henry Fonda), an aristocrat so liberal in his views, visits his friend Count Rostov (Barry Jones) and his radiant, young daughter Natasha (Audrey Hepburn). They all witness 'those handsome Russian men marching away to fight, to be killed.'

When his father dies, Pierre falls under the spell of the attractive Helene (Anita Ekberg) and finds himself unable to resist her passionate response... He marries her even though everybody knows that she's fooling around on him with Dolokhov (Helmut Dantine).

His closest friend, Prince Andrei Bolkonsky (Mel Ferrer), achieves success as a soldier under General Kutuzov (Oscar Homolka) but returns wounded, a condition made the worse by the death of his wife in childbirth...

With his own marriage ended by the adultery of his woman, Pierre introduces the grieving Andrei to Natasha, and the pair fall in love... But before they can marry, Andrei goes to fight the invading French and the pacifistic Pierre goes along as an observer...

The motion picture deals with war and its effect on people... It contains many marvelous pictorial moments as the colorfully uniformed regiments marching through the excellent streets of Moscow; snowy landscapes; a magnificent Ballroom sequence; and most of all, Napoleon's forces at the epic battle of Borodino; the march on Moscow and the tragic retreat of Napoleon's army through the Russian winter...

Most of the military side of the story takes place in the second half, and it seems slow to arrive, but the battle of Borodino is fairly well handled... It is focused (through Pierre's eyes) with long shots of the invading and retreating French troops...

Audrey Hepburn whose boyish figure provided a refreshing antidote to the film, is lovely as Natasha... Her flaming innocence and blossoming sensuality set her sweet heart ablaze... This charming spirit, with so much enthusiasm and romanticism, is full of life and true love... Hepburn matures from an impulsive, kind-hearted teen-ager, to an understanding woman who uses her courage and impetuousness to love, to care, and to serve...

Henry Fonda is pure, brave, and noble... He projects with sincerity the confusion of an honest man caught up in an angry twist of history... He witnesses the horrific events of war, experiencing days of misery as a prisoner of war... His remarkable adventures lead him to understand at least part of the mysteries of life, humanity, love and loyalty... Pierre is strikingly different from others, with a deep love and esteem for his country and his sweetheart...

Mel Ferrer is the sensitive prince who doesn't come around until he meets the sweet Natasha... Andrei is intelligent but arrogant... He ignores the feelings of his wife and fails to carry out his responsibility as a husband...

Vittorio Gassman is the legendary seducer, darkly handsome, sensuous, magnetic, who lives in a world of debauchery... Anatole is a man dangerous to love, impossible to resist...

Herbert Lom is the 'greatest man of Europe' who sees his men walking hardly under fatiguing conditions through the snowy fields of Russia... Napoleon had a tough decision to make...

Oskar Homolka is General Kutuzov who forms a reasoned judgment against an enemy who has a larger, more efficient force... It is unclear whether he did this out of weakness or whether it was part of a brilliant strategy with the purpose of drawing Napoleon's army way beyond their means of supply for the winter, which Bonaparte had not prepared for...

Anita Ekberg is Helene, the charming and reckless libertine who goes to a world of cheats and insults her husband's ego making his life depressed and miserable...

Helmut Dantine is Dolokhov, the officer, challenged for a duel, who puts on view the better side of his character much later...

Tulio Carminati is Prince Vasili Kuragine, a man of the world who familiarizes himself with people who are influential and tries to obtain favor from them...

Barry Jones is Count Rostov, a loving family man and an excellent friend... He is indulgent towards his family and provides them comforts and luxuries of life...

Wilfrid Lawson is Prince Bolkonsky, a despot aristocrat who imposes his authority on his son without caring for his feelings..

May Britt is Sonya, the tender young girl who is devoted to the Rostov family and loves Nicholas...

John Mills is Platon, the cheerful Russian peasant whose philosophies comfort Pierre...

Vidor's 'War and Peace' is massive in scale, faithful to the larger historical events... Its heart is really with the romantic side and so it's most successful as a period melodrama...",1168905600,8,5001,5.156983930778739
248914,3,6300215601,"Okay, maybe you need more time than this standard Hollywood blockbuster to do justice to Tolstoy.

But there are bigger problems with this movie than that. Begin with casting-granted, Audrey Hepburn is a very capable Natasha Rostova.

She looks like one imagines the character should, and does show some of the growth the character showed in the novel.

But Henry Fonda as Pierre Bezuhov??!!??  Henry Fonda is Mister Roberts. Henry Fonda is Tom Joad. He is not a somewhat bumbling, philosophical Russian noble.

And Mel Ferrer as Andrei Bolkonsky....  Supposedly he got the job because of his marraige/relationship (can't remember which) with Audrey Hepburn. Bolkonsky is supposed to be a

brave,philosophical (hence Pierre's friend), intelligent, good-looking Russian noble/officer. Ferrer does the good looking part ok. As for the rest, he displays the emotion and intelligence of a rock.  So, for two of the three

crucial parts, this movie is stuck with actors either inept or inapt.

  But there's also a sort of non-Russian feel to this. For example, Andrei's sister is Princess Maria Bolkonskaya in the BBC and Russian versions. Here she is Mary Bolkonsky. Princess Maria Bolkonskaya

is the Tolstoy character. Mary Bolkonsky is a dockworker's wife in Hoboken, New Jersey. The whole movie has that sort of 50s Hollywood blockbuster feel to it, and you never feel that any attempt to capture the smallest portion

of the novel is really being made. Not that it's awful-it's just blah.

  There are two better versions. The best, if you can find it, is the late 60s/early 70s BBC version. Originally shown on Masterpiece Theatre in 12-13 parts (15-18 hours?) and starring a young & brilliant Anthony Hopkins as Pierre

Bezuhov, it is by far the best at making the characters come alive. You understand their motivations and actions almost as well as reading the book. Also, you're given wonderful characterizations of Napoleon, Kutuzov, and other leaders and can really understand the military

campaigns of 1805 and 1812. The one downside is that the battles of Austerlitz and Borodino and the burning of Moscow are not nearly the spectacles of the Hollywood version or the much more imposing 60s Russian version of director Sergei Bondarchuk. The battle scenes of this version

may be the most spectacular ever filmed as Bondarchuk was reportedly given tens of thousands of Red Army extras to use. I suppose, with computer graphics, nothing like this will ever happen again. Still, the Russian version, at least to my American eyes, can't match the depth and characterization of the BBC's version.

  So, in my humble opinion:

1) BBC 70s- for depth, story and acting

2) Russian 60s-for grand spectacle

3) Hollywood 50s-for....I don't know...Audrey Hepburn?",1168732800,12,2766,5.131991051454139
248915,3,6300215601,"This film does have some good points. Audrey Hepburn is always worth watching. The Napoleonic era costumes are gorgeous and the splendors of the Romanov court are a fine spectacle. These points do not make up for the lack of interest, however. The plot plods along and there is very little excitement or drama.

The story takes place in Russia. Napoleon is defeating everyone who stands against him. Some, including some in Russia, see him as the wave of things to come. He is an enlightened ruler and the truth, that he is concerned with little other than his own power, is slow to sink in.

Pierre, a Russian noble played by Henry Fonda, begins as one of Napoleon's fans. He is not caught up in the militarism of the court but is interested in great affairs. Natasha, played by Hepburn, is a long time friend of his. She is a bright and cheerful young lady, taken in with the exploits of the men around here. She falls for another Russian noble but his family is not eager for the match. They agree to delay things for a while.

Things get more complicated when Bonaparte invades Russia. Natasha's beaux heads to war. In the meantime a womanizer back home manages to capture the nave Natasha's affections. She thinks he loves her but he is only interested into getting into her bloomers. Pierre warns him off and saves her virtue but her fianc finds out about it and they become estranged...until he is wounded at Borodino. By this time, though, the French Army is on its way to Moscow and the place has to be evacuated. Pierre is captured there and learns what Bonaparte is really like.

In the end, lots of people die, hearts get broken and the Russian winter does what the Russian army cannot. Everyone ends up dead or with the spouse they should have had to begin with.

The plot is much more complex than outlined here but the movie cannot do it justice. Still, Audrey kept my attention and the costumes were nice also.",1158883200,7,1926,4.522988505747127
248916,4,6300215601,"This audacious endeavor to bring Leo Tolstoy's brilliant epic novel ""War and Peace"" to the silver screen deserves kudos. Director King Vidor manages, superbly, to coherently condense the novel's almost 1500 pages into 208 minutes of viewing time. Here he successfully captures the flavor of Russia at war and at peace from 1805, around the time of the Battle of Austerlitz, where Napoleon and his army of the First French Empire engaged the armies of the Russian and Austrian Empires to Napoleon's invasion of Mother Russia, and Moscow itself, in 1812.

The focus is on the social, political, and military upheavals of this period in Russia...with some philosophy thrown in. Co-producers Paramount Pictures, Carlo Ponti, and Dino de Laurentiis apparently spent over six million dollars to make this cinematic extravaganza. The phenomenal battle scenes, directed by Mario Soldati, reflect the cost and the effort as, at times, they appear to be taken from newsreels - in living Technicolor. They are detailed and, frequently, heartrending in nature.

One of the major differences between the book and the movie is that while Tolstoy was able to write, in depth, about the lives of five Russian families - both noble and peasant, fleshing out each character brilliantly, director Vidor has had to concentrate, out of necessity, on just a few representative characters from the aristocratic Rostov and Bolkonsky families and Pierre Bezuhov. Pierre begins life as the natural son of a prince and goes on to become legitimized and made, unexpectedly, the extremely wealthy heir to a title and large fortune when his father dies. The serfs and their historic plight are way underrepresented here, however.

Henry Fonda does a good job in his role as Pierre Bezuhov, probably the central character of both book and film - although he comes across as much more of a Yankee than a Russian or European. Beginning as a somewhat befuddled, carefree outsider - an observer of others with a philosophical nature, he becomes burdened with his newfound responsibilities as a nobleman. He aspires to free his peasants from their lives of drudgery and to improve his many estates, but accomplishes little as he becomes mired down in a marriage with a sophisticated, shallow, immoral women whom he comes to despise. He is an intimate friend of the Rostov family.

Audrey Hepburn is at her best here as Natasha Rostov, an exuberant adolescent who grows into a beautiful, vivacious woman. Hepburn demonstrates her ability to capture a wide range of moods and emotions as Natasha matures and experiences love, joy, profound sorrow and loss.

Mel Ferrer is the proud, somewhat cynical, tragic Prince Andrei Bolkonsky. Descended from a military family, his only sense of romance is related to war and heroism. This romanticism does not last as he becomes exposed to the true horrors of the battlefield. While Ferrer is not my idea of a talented actor, he does carry this part off well. Prince Andrei is not called upon to portray a variety of emotions.

Although Vidor's ""War and Peace"" is far from perfect, I think he does an admirable job of capturing Tolstoy's major themes of family relationships, social and political change as a result of war and as the younger generation comes of age. While much of Tolstoy's spiritual and philosophical thoughts and theories are absent here, ""War and Peace"" works well as a romantic epic... of Russia before, during and after tremendous upheaval.

This is a colorful and entertaining movie with no pretensions of being profound. And then there's Audrey Hepburn...reason enough to rent the epic production.

248917,3,6300215601,"This story revolves around Natasha Rostov.  She is the daughter of Count Rostov and lives in Moscow. She is a close friend of Count Pierre Bezukhov  She falls in love with the widow Prince Andrei Bolkonsky after the Battle of Austerlitz and gets engaged. After Natasha falls in love with another man, Prince Vasili Kuragine, she is forced to break up her engagement with Prince Bolkonsky. Prince Bolonsky then fights Napoleon at the battle of Bordino and gets mortally wounded. This improves Natasha's and Bolonsky's relationship before he dies.

This story is very historically accurate. The only real person in this story is Napoleon Bonaparte. According to wikipedia.org, ""Others consider him (Napoleon) a tyrannical dictator whose wars and rule led to the death of millions and the permanent loss of prestige for France"" (""Napoleon I of France""). This movie displays Napoleon as a man who only wants to fight. He doesn't care how many people he kills in this movie, he just wants to win glory. The two battles shown in this movie are also very accurate. Napoleonguide.com regarded the battle of Austerlitz as Napoleon Bonaparte's greatest victory; Austerlitz was a sublime trap that destroyed the armies of his enemies Russia and Austria."" (napoleonguide.com). This movie showed a decisive French victory. The second battle scene in this movie showed the Battle of Borodino. According to wikipedia.org, ""the battle ended with inconclusive tactical results for both armies, and only strategic considerations forced the Russians to withdraw"" (""Battle of Borodino""). This movie shows the aftermath of the battle as happening that way.

This movie was set in early 19th century Russia. The movie starts in 1805 and ends in 1812. The movie takes place in Moscow, Borodino, and Austerlitz. All of the locations seemed realistic. Moscow had many Russian Orthodox churches and all of the nobility's houses were baroque in style.  These details are correct for early 1800's Moscow.  One prop that I thought were well presented were dueling pistols. According to answers.com, duels were common in 19th century Russia and pistols were the weapon of choice for duels (about.com). Another aspect of the movie that was good was the costumes. In Alan Schom's Napoleon Bonaparte there are pictures of the French uniform's and Napoleon's standard dress. In this movie the dress matched the dress shown and described in the book (Schom).

I would rate this movie seven out of ten. Henry Fonda was a terrible actor in this movie. Somehow his Midwestern accent failed to convince me that he was Russian. Mel Ferrer, on the other hand, did a much better job. He looked and acted like he was a noble. The plot moved very slowly in this movie. A lot could have been taken out without disrupting the story at all. One character that was a stereotypical Russian was Pierre. He spent the nights in a pub drinking vodka a lot, which was really not something the nobility did everyday. The story did build to a logical climax and resolution. The story did lose the viewers interest in the middle of the movie because the story was so long, 208 minutes. This movie would have been done much differently if it was made today. One major change would be that the battle scenes would be realistic. This movie made history more clear. If I made this movie I would get better acting and make it about half as long. I would not recommend this movie to another student because it takes so long to get through and it would not hold their interest throughout the whole movie.",1151366400,,3692,4.935587761674718
248918,4,6300215601,"'War and Peace' is a book I in my teen years loved to read, sensing that it gave a picture of life as something 'large' and 'deep ' and beyond anything I had known in my own experience. The movie so oddly constructed, and of course so poor in language and feeling as if not to be spoken of in the same breath with the book, nonetheless has its virtues. Its picture of the opening ball, its world of bright color and costume enabled me to 'image' in my own mind its world as I had not been able to in reading the book.

One of the things which most struck me in watching the film was my sense of comparison of the images on the screen, with the images in my mind of the characters as I had somehow 'thought of them' from reading the book.

Henry Fonda was certainly not 'Pierre'. He was too thin and did not have the overall bearish strength , the Tolstoyan power that the book makes Pierre have. On the other hand , Audrey Hephburn as Natasha in the film replaced any picture I might have had in my mind, and became 'Natasha'. So this at least the film gave me.

The film is too long, and confuses at times. But it does have as I have said, a picturesque, colorful quality which makes it more enjoyable as spectacle than as anything else.",1147564800,6,1238,4.15
248919,4,6300215601,"As a deeply-adoring Audrey Hepburn fan, I have mixed feelings about this movie, as do many Hepburn devotees. It's hard not to wonder what the then-new epic master, David Lean, might have done with it, had he been in charge instead of King Vidor, a giant of the silent era from decades before.

The story I gather from Hepburn biographies is that the producer of this movie shrewdly cast Hepburn's husband, Mel Ferrer, before offering a part to her. Immediately a rival pre-production group shut down their preparations for a ""War and Peace"" adaptation, knowing that the plum actress for the part would surely not sign with them. (To my knowledge, Lean never got anywhere near either production.)

Well, if that's the case, then ""War and Peace"" might have been flawed from the start. The domino effect of starting with Ferrer's casting, securing the directorial efforts of a somewhat-aging Vidor, and also having Hepburn to make love to her own husband onscreen, might have meant that something about this movie seems a bit too comfortable for all involved in making it. It's not as dramatic as it needs to be, as cruel in its cruel moments as it needs to be, and therefore not as inspiring and revelatory of what's great about the human spirit when it needs to be. It does -- to my mind -- feel a bit bloated, a bit slow, and never quite at that high-stakes level you might hope.

Indeed, another story about the movie and its ""problematic-ness"" was told by King Vidor himself in his autobiography. Apparently, at the time of the movie's production or maybe release, his wife had chid him for letting his own, rather fatherly affection for Audrey Hepburn prevent him from letting her play the fullness of Natasha's character -- which is not always a pleasant one in the book. Vidor copped to this accusation, accepting that he had not pushed her as he might have. Tellingly, in the autobiography he went so far (I believe) as to name young Hepburn as his favorite actress to have ever worked with. There is something touching but not quite fortunate in that, because ""War and Peace"" will never be remembered as a Vidor masterpiece or even a work of the man in his prime. Perhaps it illustrates that, again, this movie was only going to go so far with itself.

Who knows? But my favorite story about this movie shows the intelligence of Hepburn herself. She had asked that Peter Ustinov be cast as Pierre, which to my mind would have been completely perfect casting. Pierre in the book is a bit rotund, a bit clumsy, but also strongly intellectual and bursting with questions about life and society. Ustinov would have been perfect, given the mind and the comic talent he had. (Ustinov also wrote a lovely eulogy upon Audrey Hepburn's death, which is quoted in his book ""Still at Large."" He thanked her for thinking of him when Pierre needed casting, saying that her choice of him had continued to surprise him throughout his life. He too was a UNICEF representative in his lifetime, and when he passed away, my mourning for him was mixed with thoughts of Hepburn as well.)

But as to the movie ... I will say that there is nothing inept or embarrassing about this adaptation. There are world-class actors in this movie, and if you're waiting for mistakes from them, don't hold your breath. (Henry Fonda, whatever his speaking accent, definitely understood something about Pierre, as did Ferrer about Andrei and certainly Hepburn about Natasha.) You can watch this movie straight through or in sections on DVD, and probably come to like it quite a bit either way. It's gorgeous for Hepburn alone, but also in so many other ways. But once you know the background of the movie, you do risk getting a case of the what-ifs? If you can ignore them, more power to you.",1099958400,69,3761,4.683812405446293
248920,4,6300215601,"This is a tough one. In this film adaptation of one of the greatest of the literary classics, one is left wondering whether the magic that one feels comes from the film or is carried over from the novel. For those of us who have read the novel, the artistic license that King Vidal takes is difficult to swallow. Even if we understand that something must inevitably be sacrificed in the distillation of such a massive tome, the abridgement of so much literary genius is troubling. Whole characters, episodes and entire subplots are missing, to say nothing of the larger drama of an ancient and honourable culture teetering on the brink of ruin. As hard as the film tries, it misses this sense of awful grandeur and fails to invoke the overwhelming sweep of history conveyed so well in the novel.

Where it succeeds is in the smaller stories: the lives of the key protagonists, their loves, passions, accomplishments and deaths. We see some admirable performances, especially by Audrey Hepburn as Natasha. She is stunning as a precocious innocent who journeys into womanhood through the brutality of war. Henry Fonda at first seems miscast as a gangly nebbish Peter, until you see him decisively defending Natasha's honour and then confessing his love to her, or clinging to life and hope as a grimly determined prisoner of war. And Mel Ferrer invests his Andrew with what I think is just the right mixture of aloofness, sensitivity, passion and angst. When he first asks Natasha to dance, standing there in his uniform of white and serge, you can understand how Audrey Hepburn fell in love with him in real life. Their scenes together show the tension and tenderness of a real couple, and bring a believable romantic chemistry to the screen. Then there is the splendid cast of supporting actors from Natasha's endearing parents to Andrew's martinet of a father to Herbert Lom's surprisingly complex and sympathetic Napoleon. They don't make character actors like these anymore.

It goes without saying that the plot is magnificent. But this is once again more of a tribute to the novel than the film. Only an idiot could have hashed such a wonderful story.

However, this film is no more about plot than it is about politics. I always felt that Tolstoy's choice of title does his novel an injustice, giving it the air of a political treatise that belies its humanity. War and Peace is only peripherally about either war or peace. While his book does polemicize about war, politics and history, it really only finds its stride when focusing on its ageless themes of hope, love, loss and redemption. And because his characters are constructed so skilfully, we care for them and feel their emotions as if they were our own. To this extent, the film largely succeeds. It is true enough to the heart of the characters that it effectively conveys the novel's essence, even if it doesn't adhere strictly to the novel itself.

It's not perfect. For one thing, it contains irritating affectations that are simply unnecessary. For example, Napoleon is shown directing his army in the midst of the battlefield while reclining and with his legs propped up on a footstool. In fact, Napoleon never showed such contempt for his soldiers and often placed himself dangerously near the front lines astride a white charger as an example of courage and trust in his men. And this movie, like Gone with the Wind, to which it is often compared, commits the sin of glossing over the treatment of its underclass. The front line Russian soldier was a starved, ill-equipped peasant pressed into service and kept from deserting with whippings and the threat of death. The movie focuses on the lives and loves of the nobility to the exclusion of practically all else, and this is one area where the film could have gained by departing from the novel.

This is more than a ""period"" film and even those who are allergic to such fare might wish to give it a chance. In all, it is a fine film to be admired more for its characterizations than its accuracy. It comes off especially well when compared to its contemporary ""epics"" like Cleopatra, or Ben Hur, because the characters were created not by Hollywood screenwriters, but by a literary genius, and are thus imbued with an almost Shakespearean presence. However, it will not appeal to people with unbending views about either their literature or their history. Tolstoy's novel subsumed his characters to the larger story of a Russia under siege. This is why he populated the world of his novel with so many people. In this film, Hollywood justifies the presence of its big stars by ignoring the larger canvass to concentrate on the lives of a select few. The result is a film much reduced in scope from the spirit of the novel, but still effective in its diminished way.",1094947200,39,4793,4.79081015719468

This is based on Leo Tolstoy's great classic story, War and Peace.  The movie reflects the book well, and it would be presumptuous of me to make commenton the novel, except on the movie itself.

This was, possibly, one of Fonda's best efforts, as Pierre, an illegitimate count, legitimatized only at his father's death, who hated violence and war.  Also, Audrey Hepburn was exquisite as Natasha Rostov, a naive, innocent and passionate little Russian girl that everyone loved and some took advantage of.

The novel was complex, but essentially it was rather simple.  It was the struggle of the Russian people against the minions of Napoleon, and the horrors of the war he brought to Russia.

A truly great great classic in scope and cast.  A superb production.

248975,4,6300215601,"It has been almost 50 years since this film first appeared, allegedly based on Tolstoy's novel and stolidly directed by King Vidor. Since then, of course, there have been dozens of other epic films whose special effects were aided and enhanced by technologies then unavailable to Vidor and his crew. However, given the scope and depth of Tolstoy's examination of Russia in the 1805-1815 time period, even a film produced today could not possibly do full justice to his novel. My rating takes into full (and respectful) account when this film was made; also, I admit being charmed by Audrey Hepburn's style and grace in the role of Natasha. However, Vidor's direction seems to me uninspired, at times listless, and Henry Fonda (one of my favorite actors) is woefully miscast as Pierre. However, there are several magnificent, truly memorable scenes. The cast and crew are inevitably multi-national, adding at least some seasoning to a bland screenplay. Strong performances in a supporting role are provided by Vittorio Gassman (Anatole), Oscar Homolka (General Kutuzov), and Herbert Lom (Napoleon). Jack Cardiff and Aldo Tonti's cinematography is first-rate. ""All things considered,"" the film is often entertaining despite a running time of 208 minutes. It is what it is...but not what it could have been. Hence my rating of Three and One-Half Stars to which I add half a Star in special appreciation of Audrey Hepburn's performance.",1077062400,6,1432,5.176724137931035
248976,4,6300215601,"War and Peace is about the Napoleonic invasion of Russia in 1812.  This edition, verses the Russian (1967, Soviet Union era) edition, is of course shallower.  However, for half the time investment it does give one a good taste of the subject.  The longer, 1967 edition has more to say, yet it also ends with a sort of propaganda message of ""compassion towards one's defeated enemy"" that does not align with history (it was made during the Soviet Union days).  This 1956 edition ends more like it did in real life.  Both editions are worthwhile.",1062979200,6,544,4.684210526315789
248977,4,6300215601,"Great Cast with a great story is not always the best combo, but this DVD is a keeper. Audrey Hepburn as Natasha does the best with her multi expressions & cute dialogue during the many courtships throughout the film. Henry Fonda as Pierre comes in a close 2nd, but at 1st he seems out of place, too passive. Later this lack of emotion or evolvement shines forth as he goes though many hardships as a prisoner of Napoleon. Mel Ferrer as Prince Andrei, then Audrey Hepburn's real husband, has the same problem as Henry Fonda, he drifts in & out of character. I believe the problem with the main male actors is that they played it too straight. The woman who played Prince Andrei's 1st wife did the worst, she over acted like a silent movie star. The supporting cast does a great job, specially the actor playing Nepoleon. This is exactly what I think Nepoleon looked & acted like in the early 19th century. The phyical height & size for the French emperor are perfect, & the letting of free opinion to be express, yet at the same time having the over powering will to bring Europe to his knees. Desite the flaws, this version of ""War & Peace"" will give you a short stroll, with a ""to the point"" idea of a western classic with great photography & sound. I try not to watch it too many times because I don't want to wear it out.",1050537600,9,1324,4.342741935483871
248978,4,6300215601,"I bet most people have heard of WAR AND PEACE, but few people have read this hefty tome.  It gives many people the connotation of zillions of characters and eons to read.  But guess what, it really is a good story and the best way to find out frankly is with the movie at only 3 and a half hours long.  Why am I telling your about it?  Because it is a Napoleonic movie and there aren't all that many of these.  Yes, the ""war"" part deals with Napoleon's wars with Russia.  Of course Leo Tolstoy was Russian so you get to see Napoleon's campaigns mostly from the Russian point of view, the battles, strategy, heroes, agony, etc.  The battle scenes aren't epic sized, but still inspiring, sweeping, and worth the wait.  In particular, we get to see the battles of Auschwitz, Borodino, and the long, terrible, cold retreat from Moscow.

No those don't take three and a half hours because the other part of the movie is `and peace'.  The movie focuses on the various love stories swirling around Audrey Hepburn and Henry Fonda.  But what I particularly like is the view of Russian aristocracy during the Napoleonic age, the splendid houses, ornate buildings, conflicting mores, charming gowns (and the women wearing them), and country dachas.  It does particularly well for showing the affects of the war on the families at home including the men marching off to war, the women waiting for them, and the families evacuating Moscow just ahead of Napoleon.
So whatever your perceptions of WAR AND PEACE may be, see the movie and find out for yourself.  I know, even at 3.5 hours, the movie condenses the book and what Tolstoy wants to say to us, but it is still a fine story and movie with legendary actors, beautiful sets, a large cast, and sweeping plots.",1040428800,9,1750,4.588424437299035
248979,5,6300215601,"This film came out on DVD this month and I rushed to buy it. This version is the first to render all the detail and perfection of Jack Cardiff's a-ma-zing compositions and brilliant, varied photography. As a collection of definitive, memorable images, this film is better than any comparable historical epic of the period and even gives GWTW a run for its money. King Vidor's direction is a series of `tableaux vivants' where the characters are not posing but acting in a very natural, period-specific way. I have never had a problem with this adaptation of Tolstoy's novel. I think it is a wonderful introduction to the period and the novel and that it is a very poetic, very original work in its own right. The most conspicuous handicap of this movie, in my opinion, besides a few rough patches in the generally pristine celluloid - Natasha unevenly shifts from light to dark while waiting for a dancing partner at the ball and she has a hole in her nose at the opera - is its soundtrack (in glorious mono). The barely hi-fi recording of dialogues and music sounds pinched, hollow and tinny and it always has in every version I have ever seen: in the theatres, on TV and on video. Even the soundtrack album is an abomination. As limited as it is, this soundtrack is at least free of static and scratches. In some scenes, however, before the necessary adjustments (With a Dolby 5.1 receiver, try the ""Mono Movie"" CD setting and amplifying the ""surround effects"" and subwoofer volume to a maximum), Audrey Hepburn's and Mel Ferrer's voices actually hurt your ear. Nino Rota's very Russian-sounding score is serviceable and melodic, although rather sparse in its orchestration and in the number of players. But maybe that's his hommage to Mozart's simplicity... One can only wonder what `War and Peace' could have sounded like with a cohort of Hollywood arrangers, decent recording facilities and lavish, varied orchestrations in true high fidelity and stereophonic sound. According to Lukas Kendall of `Film Score Monthly', the original recording elements of the soundtrack have long ago disappeared, which is the common lot of international, independent co-productions of the era. Someone somewhere is certainly guilty of skimping on quality or embezzlement for this 1956 movie to sound so much worse than a 1939, pre-hi-fi epic like GWTW. But it's still a masterpiece!",1040083200,10,2370,4.957286432160804
248980,3,6300215601,"I was 16 went I saw the original theatrical release of  Paramount's 1956 version of War & Peace.  I was enthralled... but then in those days I was enthralled with every wide-screen, stereo sound movie I saw.  I even enjoyed Beneath The 12 Mile Reef !!!  Since those heady days I have tried to watch this Hollywood version of Tolstoy's epic novel on TV and VHS, but was always panned-and-scaned into numbness.  With the Dec. 3rd , 2002, release, after nearly a half-century of missing its left and right sides, this solid, and beautifully mounted film emerges once again in its wide screen glory.
Of course condensing a 1000 page novel into three hours eliminates many of Tolstoy's details, but the basic story remains very much in tact.  What is stellar here is the cast.  In 1956 Audrey Hepburn was peaking, both as an actress and a beauty.  Henry Fonda played a sympathetic Pierre with considerable grace, and Mel Ferrer did admirably with the difficult role of  the moody Andrei.  Most impressive is Oscar (Mr. Eyebrows) Holmolka as General Katuzov, and Herbert Lom makes a believable brooding Napoleon.  You even get Anita Ekberg!  Then when you add John Mills, Vittorio Gassman and a number of other accomplished performers, this becomes a film well worth watching.  It is also notable because it was the last major directing effort by silent film master, King Vidor.
But hang on!  Also in December the eminently preferable, 1968 Sergi Bondarchuk Mosfilm six-hour version of War & Peace also comes out on DVD.  Paramount put together a ""cast of thousands,"" but Mosfilm appears to have assembled a ""cast of millions""  To portray the vast French and Russian forces, Bondarchuk did not need ""digital clones"" for he had the services of the entire Red Army.  In 1956 I was very impressed with Vidor's Battle of Bordino sequence, but compared the action Bondarchuk puts on the screen during the defense of Moscow, it almost seems quaint.
Paramount's version is fine, but wait until Bondarchuk takes you on a ride across the battle field by hitching his camera to a cannonball.

248981,4,6300215601,"With 10 years in the making, two years of filming and (as a previous reviewer noted) no less than six writers, Tolstoy's epic masterpiece  la Hollywood does get a bit muddled and lost at times, but who cares!?!?  The film's cast is stellar.  Audrey Hepburn, Mel Ferrer and Henry Fonda were each born to play their respective roles in this monumental film.  Fonda plays the quixotic Pierre almost as good as Sergei Bondarchuk does in the more accurate (though also more brutal and heart-wrenching) 1967 Russian version.  Hepburn, as the dazzling and ingenuous Natasha is a perfect foil to Mel Ferrer's Prince Andre, who loses his melancholy and determined seriousness only in the presence of Natasha (the same could almost be said of the film!).
Where the Hollywood version is lacking in battle scenes, historic detail, commentary from ordinary Russians and several key character developments (Mary Oblonsky, Nicholas Rostov, the Tsar, Denisov et al), it more than makes up for it with personal performances (above mentioned actors), set and costume design and an overall mood and tone consistent with the book.
