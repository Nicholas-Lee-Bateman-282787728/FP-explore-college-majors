8752052,3,B01C1QVICY,"This Euro Western double bill explores the theme of revenge through young boys experiencing the cold blooded murders of their families and maturing into serial killers.  Both films are directed by Rafael R. Marchent, the actor brother of Director Joaquim R. Marchent and may be the best of his Western forays.  Up first is the best of the two, 'GARRINGO' aka ' DEAD ARE COUNTLESS' aka 'I MORTI NON SI CONTANO'-1969 starring Peter Lee Lawrence as the psycho kid and Anthony Steffen, the Union soldier hired to apprehend him dead or alive.
It seems that Lawrence is bumping off the Union army due to witnessing his father's execution by Union thugs when he was a boy.  Steffen walks through his role as Lawrence for once plays the villain and is the true highlight of the film.  Along for the ride are Frank Brana and Raf Baldassare as the slimy backup for Lawrence.  The music by Marcello Giombini is catchy and the images by Aldo Ricci elevate the film beyond its routine running time.  Next is 'TWO CROSSES AT DANGER PASS' aka 'DUE CROCI A DANGER PASS' -1968, a Western resembling Director Guilio Petroni's excellent 'DEATH RIDES A HORSE' aka 'A UOMO A UOMO'- 1967 right down to the young boy witnessing the murders of his family which makes him become a notorious gunslinger.  The film does veer into other territory by placing Peter Martell as the psycho kid seeking vengeance on the bounty killers responsible without an older mentor teaching him the ropes.  It's just OK with the highlight being the music score by the great Francesco De Masi.  Both films are widescreen and dubbed in English in the excellent standards we come to expect from Wild East Productions.  Included in the package is an over 29 minute interview with Director Rafael R Marchent who as of the time of the interview was 84 years old and had difficulty remembering his 25 film output.  He did remember an amusing story about actor Klaus Kinski and his brother Joaquim on a Western shoot and the interview is peppered with clips of his films and photos.  Photo galleries and theatrical trailers round out this nice Western package by Wild East and makes for an adequate double bill
