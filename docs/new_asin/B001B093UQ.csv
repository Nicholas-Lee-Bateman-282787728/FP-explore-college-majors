3477408,5,B001B093UQ,"I found this film to be poetic, thoughtful, and beautifully shot.  It invites you from the very beginning to slow down and experience an intricately layered story on its own terms.  Strathairn gives an amazing performance as a troubled English teacher searching for answers to a tragedy he's witnessed, and the rest of the excellent cast--Jane Adams is my favorite--help lead him toward the healing he seeks.",1220313600,16,408,5.074626865671642

No fanfare, no marvelous camerawork speaking of vistas that are breathless, no actor that requires contractual close-ups and a minimum amount of screen time.  Only each element working within the context of the story and delivering an unequaled effort full of pathos and believability.  The viewer cannot help but being drawn in to this wonderful piece of magic.  Thank you for making this...not for me, but for you, the writer, director and craftsman.  You have broadened not only my experiences of 52 years, but have helped connect the dots of discord and dissonance within my own creative life.  Again, thank you.",1478649600,4,655,5.132075471698113

Yes it does feel long in some places, and perhaps that should have reduced it to 4 stars instead of 5, but it seems a minor editing issue to me.  If there were such thing as Art Cinemas these days this would have been there.....this doesn't telescope the events for you, you have to let it unfold...restrained and spare in dialogue and sound creating a fragile, isolated mood you will be enveloped in beautiful cinematography as characters and events  bloom as the threads of this tale weave together. I don't want to say more for fear of spoiling it for you....suffice to say if you aren't in a hurry  allow yourself to go where it takes you, it is a beautiful character study of one man's survival as the story's subtle eye scans his silent fortress of  mundane routine.

3477457,1,B001B093UQ,"By far and away, this is the most stupid use of film, a waste of time & $.  Do not purchase or view this film, I was unable to finish it was so bad.",1361491200,3,148,3.3529411764705883
3477458,4,B001B093UQ,"Despite mixed reviews, I'm glad I gave this a watch because it was worth it. It's a bit of a journey but the emotional pay-off is superb and the characters will stay with you long after.

It's a quiet film essentially about the way people interact with each other in the world while at the same time functioning inside a bubble of isolation and the ultimate effect that can have.  Each of the characters are struggling with some sort of emotional grief - their stories all connected - and yet they`re unable to help or, at times, even be fully aware of each other.

While the primary theme is fairly tragic, there's a sense of lightness that keeps the film from bogging down. The cinematography is gorgeous in a minimalist setting that lets the performances stand on their own.  There were also some flashes of dark, unexpected humor, if you pay close attention. I had one laugh-out-loud moment when Somerhalder's character - who is often so isolated and restrained that he's almost like a ghost - has a moment of painful irony with a young boy, Josh.

The downside of the movie is that it sometimes tries too hard to reach a level of quirk that can be expected in indie films. It's also a shade pretentious, taking itself very seriously and can be a bit heavy-handed trying to get it's ideas across. Perhaps the writer/director should have just let this one unfold a bit more organically at times.

The brightest spots were the actor's performances. I fully expected Strathairn, Adams, Scott and Cusak to be wonderful and they absolutely were.  I was pleasantly surprised by almost the entire cast, though. A few of them particularly stood out for me.

Daniel Gillies shone as Dylan, a troubled, lonely man with so many issues - past and present - but with a desperate need to continue to make a connection with others. He can only seem to do it on a superficial level though, attempting to form bonds with strangers but unable to find his way back to his own family. Gillies performance was so bold and funny and sad that it makes me wonder why I haven`t seen more of him. He was fantastic.

Ian Somerhalder was another revelation. Early on his character, Drifter, is so understated that he seems almost one-note. Soon, though, you realize that he's just so damaged that isolation and repression are the only way he has to keep from coming completely unglued. In the moments when his character breaks through his barriers, Somerhalder shows a surprising ability for handling the grueling emotional aspects of the role. Although his is the quietest performance with the least dialogue of any of the main characters, I was haunted by Drifter and found myself completely invested in his outcome.

Elisabeth Waterston was just gorgeous. Completely natural and never forced, her performance was spot on. Her character is the thread that weaves several of the stories together and Waterston handles the task so lightly, so delicately that there's never a sense her character is any sort of device created for this purpose. Although a bit overly quirky (a fault that doesn't lie with the actor but in the writing) there is still substance to her story. Waterston is able to portray strength and independence while still remaining whimsical and vulnerable and make it all believable.

In the end, the story comes full circle and we see what Finn's true purpose has been all along. It's a long and sometimes convoluted path, but the pay-off is worth it.",1347494400,8,3446,4.755443886097153
3477459,3,B001B093UQ,"One of those movies you need to watch more than once to really get the gist of.  Im still watching again.....  Superb actors though!  It just may have been a not me story so I cant comment really.  I do recommend watching it as it is not the usual movie of good guy, bad guy or romance.  Interesting.",1336176000,,300,4.103448275862069
3477460,3,B001B093UQ,"I can see why this is more a film festival type movie.  I got it as I am a Ian Somerhalder fan (well actually Vampire Diaries fan) and was interested in some of the other work he has done.  The movie story is about how the events in ones life can mould that persons future.  Ian and the book seller are linked through the death of a young boy. The other characters have their own issues but their paths cross those of Ian and the book seller. Ians voice the same but he had longish hair, which I am not used to.  Events unfold to the point where the book seller and Ian are greiving about the same situation, at the same time in the same place.  The book seller is on the way to recovery but I guess Ian was not - had to put my own interpretation on it. Most memorable two moments - Ian smoking a cigarette and Ian trying to portray grief - his face twisted crying and all I could see was his pretty white teeth (which seemed out of place) and his beautiful face as per Damon Salvador from Vampire Diaries.  I am glad his acting has improved but I guess we all have to start somewhere.",1316476800,,1085,4.070422535211268
3477461,1,B001B093UQ,"I ONLY watched this movie for Ian Somerhalder and i regret it, no matter how much i love his acting, and his face, i could not handle the boring neverending drone of this film, it was just too much of the same gray uneventful happenings though the final parts were dramatic the climactic build to these parts were dull and a 10 degree sidewalk climbing to a -90 degree drop off. i would never force anyone to watch this movie",1285286400,9,425,4.325
3477462,5,B001B093UQ,"The opening shot thrilled me--for a rather personal reason. I recognized the scene as the one that's been fascinating my brother and me since we were kids. It's an old stone barn we used to drive past on the way to visit our grandfather.

After admiring the barn, I realized that nothing was really happening. Nothing much, anyway. I waited while the movie's dawn turned to daylight around the barn and the morning mists burned off. I began to wish I hadn't bought it.

But it gets better. We meet a man named Finn (David Strathairn) and watch as he tells his wife he's going away. Finn seems to be tortured and have a driving need to search for some sort of answer. His message is ambiguous and almost confusing--as it should be.

In another scene, two guys come together to wash cars, and they're discussing the fact that one is working and the other is not. But there are three guys there, and the third one isn't working, either. And he's wearing a suit. I wondered why. And I wondered why, in the age of the internet, Finn decides to go-to-door selling encyclopedias.

Eventually I learned that the third guy is a ghost. It's not that this is a `paranormal' movie. It's just that Finn's burden of unresolved tragedy is as real to him as any physical presence could be. The people around him can't see the ghost--most of them, anyway. What they can see, can touch, are the encyclopedias.

Finn is not glamorous. He's not fabulous. He's not even successful or collected or sexy, at least in the classic sense. He's real. In fact, he's so real, so imperfect, so nakedly human that I relate to him. I identify. I feel.

""The Sensation of Sight"" contains no pat answers. It depicts life, complete with anxieties and uncertainties. But it leaves us with a sense that we need not be its victims: we can be its participants.",1283212800,5,1821,4.536585365853658
3477463,5,B001B093UQ,"I bought this movie knowing that it was filmed in New Hampshire. I watched it to see New Hampshire - and because I was curious about this guy pulling a wagon and wearing a hat and sneakers. Loved it.  The characters grew very important to me.  I was so surprised as stories and relationships unfolded. I had to keep rewatching, because, every time I would try to concentrate on the scenery, indoors and outdoors, I would get distracted by the people and their stories. This is an excellent film for the story and for the New Hampshire stuff....I will watch it again.",1264982400,2,566,4.53921568627451
3477464,1,B001B093UQ,"You're kidding me with this facockta movie.  This is the most tedious, boring, pointless, pretentious movie I've ever seen.

First of all, let's address all this hype about this movie being ""about life.""  Are you serious?  OK, the protangonist, David Strathairn, is a teacher who witnesses one of his students commit suicide, right in his class. ... Are we told WHY?  No.

Then there's another thread to the script in which a young man is estranged from his father. Are we told WHY he's estranged from his father?  No.  Not a clue.

And what does the teacher, David Strathairn, do?  He quits teaching and sells encyclopedias door-to-door -- the encyclopedias he was given by the suicidal student. ... Oh YEEEAH!  Sure! ... And he sells them not as a ""set"" but volume at a time.

Then throughout the movie there's this guy who doesn't say anything -- whereupon in the last few minutes we come to find out that he's the ghost of the student who blew his brains out. ... And guess what David Strathairn does -- he shoots the ghost!  He shoots the ghost in one of the most tedious scenes ever commited to celluloid.

My God, what an incredibly pretentious movie!

I don't say that the movie was photographed poorly; it wasn't.  But it's about absolutely nothing.  You can't purport to tell a meaningful story and then *not* tell a story.  At all!

You can't purport to make a film ""about life"" and then render the plot, the structure, the dialogue, and the character-interaction ... lifeless.

A great deal is made of the various plots in this movie being ""interwoven.""  They're not!  They don't relate at all to one another.  One dizzy gal asks David Strathairn, the encyclopedia salesman, if she's sexy.  OK, lady, you're sexy.  But what's the point?  Ok, fine, she's lonely.  Yeah, we get it.  But then what?  There has to be some meaning, even if it's simply impressionist, to her lonliness.  But the only impression I get form these characters is that they're over-socialized, self-centered, and incredibly boring.

Yes, there exists in the world a great deal of loneliness, but to make a meaningful movie about loneliness you can't simply *refer* to it and then point to yourself and say: ""Look at my film, it's about loneliness.  I Have all these lonely people in it.""  You can't simply have actors wandering around cryptically referring to tragedies in their lives that the audience doesn't have a clue about.

A (relatively) young woman is concerned about whether she's sexy.  So she asks this lonely, traumatized salesman if she's sexy.  And he takes five minutes and twelve camera angles to say yes. ... And then what?  I suppose we the audience are supposed to say: ""Gee, have I learned a lot about life from this gal!""  (Not!)

The movie is especially annoying when it periodically quotes people like Shelley and Plato and Lord Chesterton; as if to say: ""See, what these guys are saying is what's being said in the movie.""  But guess what, sports fans, this movie *isn't* about what these famous people have said about life.  It's just a cheap high school trick whereby a lazy student punches up his or her really poor, really disjointed, really pretentious term paper with quotes from people the student *wish* had written their term paper.

Finally, I had a great deal of respect for David Strathairn *before* this movie.  I appreciated the fact that he's been very selective in the roles he's accepted.  But when I saw this movie and then saw that he also *produced* the movie, phffft! out the window went my respect for him.

This movie is right up there with ""The Big Chill"" and ""Ordinary People"" for precocious, self-righteousness, empty-headedness, psycho-babble fiddle-faddle.  In short, it stinks.  On ice.

In fact, if you look the ""S"" voulme of any encyclopedia, under the word ""stinkeroo"" you'll see a cast picture of this turkey.",1262044800,11,3851,4.781155015197569
3477465,5,B001B093UQ,"As a frequent New Hampshire visitor for approximately 20 years from Maryland, I truly enjoyed this independent film for many reasons. In addition to this film's award-winning cinematography, every viewer has the opportunity to familiarize him/herself with each characters' interconnected stories from within the ""old B&B"", otherwise known as the former Peterborough Manor. Personally, I stayed at this wonderful Victorian hostel/Bed and Breakfast for ten years over time in almost every room! So, I also enjoyed this film because it provides me with fond memories and closure of the entire B&B and its tranquil surroundings from one of my favorite small towns. I was fortunate to attend the '07 premiere with 900 other attendants and met some of the castmembers, which was great!

3477469,5,B001B093UQ,"I went to see this film to support a friend who was involved in the project.  Living in New York City, I have been exposed to a lot of independent film, some very good, but most too quirky and difficult to understand.

When I walked into Pioneer Theater to view this film, I didn't know that it was going to touch me in the deepest layers of my being.  Every shot was beautiful; the actors lived in their roles, showing genuine emotion, and the story line was intelligent, dealing with issues that affect many of us in our own life.

The film asked important questions and didn't leave me hanging with those questions at the end.  It offered insight and hope that wasn't insulting to the realities of everyday life.  It left me feeling less alone with my own thoughts about similar questions.

This film is the best I've seen all year.  I went back a second time and loved it even more.  I look forward to receiving the DVD.  I will be very proud to share it with my friends.

8280748,4,B001B093UQ,Those saying they couldn't get past the first 15 min should have watch it a little further. I thought the same thing then it got better. And those that are saying it is boring are shallow minded. Simple as that. Good story about getting over grief.,1514764800,,248,4.413043478260869
