137840,5,0792153685,"I have always loved nature films and this ranks among the best. It was filmed in a real setting with real bears and very little dialogue. It began with a cub losing its mother and, in wandering around, came upon a huge Kodiak wounded by a hunter. Rather than fleeing from the huge, snarling male, it gingerly approached him and began licking its wounds. It bonded not only the two bears, but those watching the movie as well. The focus though is on hunters looking for a bear to hunt and one hunter in particular who in the end find out the awesome power of the bear. A unique look at how bears communicate and how they deal with human preditors. A remarkable piece of cinematography and the wonders a good trainer and a good director can bring about.",994377600,8,751,4.410071942446043
137841,5,0792153685,"This is the most touching story I've ever seen put to film.  Whether you love bears or not, this movie will touch your heart forever. It's the story of a cub and his protector friend, an older male bear that takes care of him after his mother is killed.
  This is not a documentary but a movie with exceptional actors, animals included. One-of-a-kind and containing maybe five or ten lines of dialogue, the Bear is an incredible achievement that anyone would appreciate. This movie would be especially appropriate for children.
  The DVD is a must, the scenery is gorgeous! did I just say gorgeous?
  Even though the disc is only single layered and there were dust particles on the original film at the time of transfer (in the beginning of the movie and at the end only), the overall transfer to DVD is awesome. 2.35:1 aspect ratio (the widest) AND enhanced for widescreen TV's (not the 2.35:1 that just squishes everybody on a 16x9 TV).
BRAVO!",976492800,15,945,4.656626506024097
137842,5,0792153685,"How I love this movie! Very touching... Even brings tears to my eyes whenever I see it. A beautiful story about love between two bears and friendship and sympathy between bears and human beings. I think that  Jean-Jacques Annaud, the director, should be admired for his excellent job  and sincere efforts for years given to this movie. I can't resist  commenting that the baby bear is so cute and seemed to be very good at  acting(?). I also liked the nature scenes and music played by London  Symphony Orchestra.
The technical quality is great. I think it's more  than 3.5/4.0 described here. The DVD provides some  special features  including ""making of the movie"" and two screen formats of regular  and 16:9 wide  you can choose from. I have 4:3 TV but found the wide  version more watchable. If you like this  kind of nature movies, I would  recommend you to try ""Adventures of Milo & Otis"". You will  love it  too.",960768000,13,919,4.62111801242236
137843,5,0792153685,"Quite simply, this movie is outstanding. Set in the mountains of British Columbia (you North Amercian's are lucky, we don't have those sorts of stunning mountains in Oz), it is a story of a grizzly bears experiences,  and a cub, and their interactions with a few hunters, and the wild.  However, for once it is told from the bears perspective, so to speak, and  consequently there is very little dialogue in the whole film. But don't be  put off, pictures speak thousands of words, and in this case an  enyclopaedia. Adventures with pumas, 'magic mushrooms', hunters, a  honey-laden beehive, 'Mrs Grizzley bear', hunting dogs, a man-campsite; and  all done intelligently and realistically-trust me. Everyone I know who has  seen the film, from juppies to scientists, has enjoyed it immensely.

137863,3,0792153685,"We recalled loving this film when it first came out, but time has not been kind to it. Because it was shot in 1988, the stunning scenery of the Canadian Rockies is somewhat dark and muted-looking compared to how it would look if filmed today. The little bear is cute, but the story is pretty lame. As anyone who has watched nature shows on bears knows, a male bear in the wild would kill an unprotected cub, not adopt it. The cub's interaction with a mountain lion is also highly unrealistic. The human characters are more like caricatures, spending half their time laughing maniacally like cartoon movie villains. Very disappointing.",1496016000,,634,4.7727272727272725

137866,1,0792153685,This movie is like a Disney film on steroids. It is such a waste of time. It's only purpose is to try to demean people who hunt. At the end of the movie the cub ends up pairing with a full grown male. WRONG. In the wild the Big male would automatically kill the cub so as to keep him from competing in the gene pool.

137888,5,0792153685,"If you are even a little bit like animals, you should watch this movie. And because its free and HD remastered, please enlarge the image and 5.2 channel stereo you are just blessed to have a chance to even look at it. Even if you already have watched, you still can enjoy the second time. It will still make you cry, smile at this kid bear befriends with wounded big bear, lost his mom and you will cry for being sorry, happy that he finally be free from human, having this feeling that he will eventually grow to be a king of jungle later and be willing to see him one day later.
Director of <THE LOVER><FROM THE NAME OF THE ROSES><ENEMY OF THE GATE><SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET> comes this movie spending 5 years documenting some of the footages but staged meaning it is a fictional movie.
If you watch this film you will fall in love with the bears instantly. Especially the little one.
When the humans releases him, he even tries to say goodby to them and cannot let go of them because he fed him once or twice. He thought that they are his friend already. Although they did some mean things to him, he didt remembers them.
He even dreams. The dreams he dreamt was so pure and artistic that we just have to smile. The butterfly the frug so amusing, amazing artiscic. He is an artist.
Thin about it. Jean-Jacues Annaud spent hours and hours to achieve what he wants just keep running the camera in front of the bears years and years. Like documentary films but not making docu film but ficional movies.
And it was 70 mm film back then. At that time there was no such thing as HD so tones of film stock they spent.
And the result was what you see a masterpeice family drama.
You will end up with purchasing this HD remastered bluray anyway after watching this movie just like I bought the German version and didn't satisfied with the sound and end up with buying the American version again. I previously owned the crappy dvd.
Where to find: Bluray is 13.55$ no dvd available. In Korea dvd is about 2$ but video image is really bad.

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

137972,5,0792153685,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Its been 25 years since the movie THE BEAR was released. Hard to believe its been that long but it has. When released the movie was a critical favorite but never did huge box office numbers. If it were released today my guess is that would happen as well with the number of television programs dedicated to nature in all of its many forms. When this came out I had no interest. I was part of a generation who grew up being force fed Disney nature films that we saw repeated every year. I loved nature but not so much movies about it. I hope that doesnt hold true for those who have a chance to see this movie now in blu-ray format from Shout Factory.

Set in 1885 British Columbia, the movie follows two stories that blend together to be one, both involving bears. A small cub plays and watches as his mother forages for honey in a nearby tree. Shes unaware that the tree holds in an outcropping of rock above her and while shaking the tree digging at it she loosens the stones which fall and crush here. The cub is left alone, an orphan in an unforgiving world.

The second story involves a full grown grizzly, a huge animal wandering the countryside. As he makes his way in search of food, finding mushrooms and berries to eat, a pair of hunters begin to track him down. One shoots, wounding the bear. As they rush to where it was shot its long gone, or so the older of the pair says. The screams of their horses make them realize how wrong they were and they return to camp to find one partially eaten and another wounded. Swearing revenge the older of the two heads out to get supplies intending on returning once hes well-armed.

The two stories collide when the cub comes across the older bear. While the full grown bear has no need or interest in the cub, the younger wants companionship and help to survive. At first the grizzly warns off the cub, but when laying down the cub moves up to the grizzly and begins licking his wounds in an attempt to help him. The two become a team and head out into the wilderness.

As they move on the grizzly goes after game that the two share, a learning experience for the cub. As the two bond we get to see something only the world of movies can show us, the dreams of the cub. Using stop motion animation, the cub dreams of the loss of his mother and of the frog he came across when he first set off on his own. These moments provide us with a reason to care about the cub, a way of putting our emotions into the story. We don't hate the hunters but we find the bear cub adorable.

Trust me when I say the cub is adorable. While small animals are always cute this one takes the cake. When you see him try to imitate the larger bear for instance as the grizzly topples a tree, the cub pushing over a sapling, it makes you smile through the whole thing. It becomes funnier when you find that the display put on by the grizzly was a mating ritual, another act the cub watches unaware of what is going on. Whats amazing to watch is how they animal wranglers on this film were able to get the cub to act the way the director wanted it to. The same holds true of the large grizzly who I think has been used in several movies and TV shows over the year.

Halfway through the movie the hunter returns with a fresh horse and tracking dogs to find the bear. The pair of animals does their best to avoid the hunters, climbing the nearby mountains to get away. Turning the dogs loose and nearing the pair, the bears become separated. Catching the cub they use him as bait, hoping the grizzly will return for him. What happens from there on Ill leave to those of you willing to watch this movie. I guarantee you that you won't be disappointed. I won't say this is family friendly entertainment because of several bloody sequences but with the exception of that and a few what I call Disney moments (like the mother dying at the start) this is something you could watch with your kids if you talked out various moments with them.

Director Jean-Jacques Annaud does an amazing job here of bringing an incredible amount of emotion from how two main actors, and Im not talking about the hunters. For the most part real bears were used in the production of this movie but during sequences such as the fight scenes animatronic bears were used, created by Jim Hensons people. The combination is seamless and Annaud mixes them so well as to making it impossible to tell which is which.

The movie also doesnt just tell us a story about a bear and a hunter, it brings into play so much more. There is a depth of story here that is far and above what we get from tons of regular movies these days. In presenting it as such it touches your heart and works your emotions to a fever pitch. At the same time the entertainment value found is there as well.

The blu-ray edition from Shout lives up to any and all of their previous efforts. The picture quality captures the beauty of the locations used to their full extent. The extras are limited but having watched the movie start to finish I don't think extras would have benefited this film. It was enough of a pleasure to watch and touches the heart in so many ways I think it would only take away from the film. What greater praise can one give than that?",1443484800,5,5284,4.2908726178535606

138096,3,0792153685,"I don't relish being the bearer of an inconvenient truth which undermines the premise of ""The Bear"", which details the tentative, grudging, but growing relationship between an orphaned cub and a full-grown male grizzly.  In the true wild, adult male bears do not take kindly to young bears and cubs.  Quite the contrary, they will take every opportunity to kill and eat young bears and cubs.  Why do they do this (to human eyes) detestable deed?  They do it for two evolutionary reasons 1) to eliminate future competition for food and mates, and 2) if the mother is present, to induce her to go into estrus again and be receptive to mating.  So sadly, the underpinnings of ""The Bear"" are really a sentimental fantasy, instead of the gritty, naturalistic, unforgiving reality it purports to be.

  That said, ""The Bear"" is nevertheless meticulously, lovingly, and finely made, and still, despite the sentimental fantasy framework, teaches the viewer much about nature's conmingled majesty and menace, man's illusory, tenuous ""dominance"" over nature, learning to respect nature, and learning to leave nature alone and largely take its course. And, darn it all, the male bear/baby bear partnership, however unlikely, is certainly interesting, engrossing, fetching, and slyly humorous (especially the sequence where the baby bear (Youk) rears up on his hind legs and thinks he's scaring a cougar off, when actually his ""guardian angel"" (played by the late ursine thespian Bart) is responsible.  Props must be conceded to the animal handlers and trainers who were able to coax these engaging performances from the two bears, who were probably acting against deeply-ingrained instincts.  Even if ""The Bear"" is not strictly true-to-natural-life, it's still quite an influential ""beast fable"" that people, say 7 years and up, can learn from and appreciate.

(P.S.: On the National Geographic channel, they did show a program about odd, ""unnatural"" animal couplings such as a lion tenderly caring for a baby oryx, a giant tortoise palling around with a baby hippo, and a dog forging a bond with a lonely adult elephant. Hmm, maybe the bears' relationship in ""The Bear"" is not so far-fetched after all.)

Great wildlife photography, and great bear `performances', but there's also a very Disney
(the bad side) element mixed in; the anthropomorphic attempts to capture what the bear
`thinks' and feels.  It makes a beautiful semi-documentary approach to a real story suddenly
feel fairly tale like in a distracting way.

I also have to dock this a star for being full screen.  The strongest element of the film

It is absolutely amazing what can be done with trained animals. This looks like footage from the wild.

I have to agree with previous viewers on the lack of wide screen vistas. Many times I pondered what was being missed as the wider view was narrowed for the adaptation to a TV screen. The setting is stunning, none the less. It's hard to only watch this once. One time for the story, then an immediate replay just to look at the background scenery.

Some bloody animal scenes, and bears attacking honey bees as well as salmon, but other than that, this is one for the entire family. You'll be inspired to animal love, but I recommend a kitty, not a fluffy bear.

There is a small amount of dialogue in the movie, but it is basically a story of a bear cub's first year of life; one endearing scene after another.  The bear cub's mother is killed while digging in a bee's nest for honey.  A large rock drops on her and the baby cub at first does not understand.  He digs out rocks around her, but gives up and sleeps close to her the first night she died.  Somehow the cub latches onto an adult male grizzly who has been wounded by a bullet from a hunter.  Despite male grizzly's instinct to kill cubs, he lets the cub follow and learn.  He takes care of this young cub during the summer, including tossing fish his way before eating himself.

138126,5,0792153685,"I first watched this film many years ago and loved it then.  However, I had almost forgotten about it until I saw an excerpt on an e-mail (""The Cougar"").  I purchased the DVD and was entranced by my second acquaintance--and I, for one, was thankful it was in full screen because widescreen is so constricted on my TV that it is almost impossible to watch.  I expect that the scenery does shine even more in widescreen that works but it's plenty beautiful for me as is.
  The story of the orphaned bear cub and his big Kodiak protector is one of the most poignant I've ever seen and I didn't detect anything phony about it.  I was truly amazed at the way the director managed the animals and the glorious scenic shoots, especially after seeing the two special semi-documentaries in the DVD's special  features.  They should cure anyone who thinks the animal sounds aren't real or otherwise distrusts the legitimate nature of the film.
  I do agree that this is not a film for young children or particularly sensitive ones as there is a considerable amount of violence (rock slide killing the mother bear; shooting of Bart; bloody fight with the dogs; killing of the deer))fairly early in the story and the menacing presence of the hunters is always hanging over the bears.
  This is clearly a pro-animal film but I do not think it portrays the hunters in a totally unfavorable light.  They are seen as rough men but not without a certain sense of justice and fair play, since Bart is spared in return for sparing one of the hunters. And if that seems a bit preposterous to the cynics in the crowd, please just try to go with the flow here.
  However, after all is said and done, the star of this film is Youk, the cub, who is completely endearing throughout.  And he is followed closely by Bart, his big friend, a really  astonishing performer. All in all, a truly dazzling film--beautiful, funny in parts, engrossing and ultimately satisfying.

138129,5,0792153685,"I own the original dual widescreen/fullscreen Tri Star 1999 Region 1 Dolby 5.1 release of this DVD. I saw one review that asserted that widescreen was only released overseas, but that is not true--I have the American widescreen release. Every year my brother asks me to search for a widescreen version for him, and every year, all there is is the Sony fullscreen release. This movie is a 5 star classic in widescreen. Like Never Cry Wolf, it was breathtaking up on the big screen in its original theatrical release. Why is there no current widescreen release of this DVD?

The Tri Star dual widescreen/fullscreen release had the same cover art, and included a 'making of' featurette, behind the scenes documentary, talent files and trailers. Also included was a beautiful 4 page insert, including stunning photos, 'making of' notes, and list of scene selections. Too bad they don't do that anymore.

Why wouldn't Sony have simply released the very same DVD? Why take the widescreen 2.35:1 version off of the disk? If there are more features on the 2000 release, then why not release both widescreen and fullscreen in separate versions?

For both my brother and I, the fullscreen version is NOT something we can stand to watch. Sony, can't you re-release this disk in widescreen? A special edition or collector's edition would be great.

Since few people have this original Tris Star release, let me share the liner notes with you:

Director Jean-Jacques Annaud first came up with the idea to make an animal film while working on Quest for Fire (1981).

Annaud: ""When I did Quest, I did a lot of research, trying to find out what was universal about human behavior, and how one could communicate through attitudes and behavior--without the use of language. I discovered that man's behavior was only one of the behaviors of mammals, and that we had a lof of reactions, feelings, and emotions in common with other animals. I was astonished that I hadn't seen any fiction film based on this material, where an animal would be the star of a psychological drama. So I decided to do an entertaining, commercial, adventure and psychological film that would have 'a bear' as a hero.""

Explaining his idea to Quest for Fire screenwriter Gerard Brach, Annaud soon received Brach's personal copy of The Grizzly King, an adventure story written by hunter-turned-naturalist James Oiver Curwood. Published in 1916, the novel was based on a true incident where Curwood, while hunting in British Coumbia, had wounded a bear and then lost his rifle down a cliff. The bear returned, confronted Curwood and then left him alone. Enthralled with the story, Annaud had Brach proceed with the screenplay.

While Brach worked on the adaptation, Annaud met with behaviorist Doug Seus to make sure bears could perform the stunts required by the film. Although the trainer could condition the bears to do most anything, Seus believed that any comradeship between an adult brown bear and a stray cub was impossible, due to inherent cannibalistic tendencies. Accordingly, Annaud contacted Jim Henson to design remote-control animatronic bears to double for the two 'stars.' Amazingly, Seus was able to train two adult bears--brothers named Bart and Doc--to actually tolerate cubs, as well as walk with a limp, fish with their paws, climb slopes, etc. Henson's 'bears' would only be used in the scenes that depicted violence.

Shot in the Dolomite mountain ranges of Northern Italy between May 18 and September 21, 1987, THE BEAR, opened in France on October 19, 1988, followed by a worldwide rollout beginning in November; by the time of its U.S. release on October 27, 1989, the $24 million project had grossed over $100 million. Oscar-nominated for its editing, ""THE BEAR is to other films about nature what Star Wars was to Science Fiction movies: a redefinition of the state of the art"" (Richard Schickel, Time Magazine).

Particularly exceptional is the absence of a narrator, and a miniscule (less then 5 minutes) of Human dialogue, yet the storyline is very clear.
I strongly recommend watching the ""Special features"" before the Movie, in order to appreciate the full extent to which the Director went to make the Movie as authentic as possible.  He even created a ""sound stage"" for the Animals to record their ""voices"", as it was impossible to record sound in many of the scenes, without affecting the behavior of the Animals.
Rarely seen behavior is captured, up close, like raiding an actual Beehive in a tree trunk, and mating.  The cinematography is suburb and the Movie does not have that amatuerish ""home-movie"" look of many documentaries.

The things I did like included the following:  the beautiful scenery of British Columbia; the ""documentary"" feel of the movie, that is, it feels like you are simply observing a bear a couple of yards away, going about his daily life; and the ability of the director to get the bears to act.

Things I didn't like included the following:  it anthropomorphizes the bears too much--the dream sequence and also the the fact that the main male bear doesn't act like a bear when he encounters the hunter trying to kill him, as he spares him so as to rescue the cub.  It just struck me as fake--a real grizzy would have mauled the hunter.  But, then again, this movie is definitely has a pro-animal rights feel to it, with the desire to make the bears look human, compassionate, morally just, etc. (just look to see who are first named in the credits: WWF and American Humane).  Not that I want to kill bears or anything, it just seems to over-simplify things (hunters: bad, bears: good).  Plus, the film shows its age, as the two special effects sequences (the cub's dream, and the mushroom trip) are just plain cheesy.  Star Wars, made in 1977, had better special effects.  And the thing of it is, they don't add to the movie but rather just detract.  That the cub is struggling with its mom's death and that it is tripping out is pretty clear, and those special effects don't enhance the telling.

Now, looking over my post, you might wonder why I gave it 3 stars, yet commented more on the negatives.  Well, I did that because most every other review has simply raved about the positives (which there are many), but no one has discussed what I feel are its drawbacks.

From the obviously skewed image of the hunters as ruthless pigs, to the most shocking:  actual dubbing of human infant voices and whimpering on a cub bear, as if the bear were a human baby.  Made without regard for the true lives of bears and to put out an anti-hunting message.  For undeniable proof of such, it was made with support from The Human Society of the United States, a terrorist animal rights group with an official sounding name to fool you, but in truth it has no connection to any government agency at all.

Due to a freak accident, the bear is orphaned as a tiny little thing; not knowing what else to do, he stays with the body of his mother until hunger gets the better of him and he must go in search of food. Before long he meets the old and wise Kodiak male who will become his friend, teacher and protector.

Yes, he did cry (quietly) when he thought the cougar was going to hurt the cub, and we did discuss other sad bits of the film, but it's about real life which children can actually be very good at dealing with. (I will conceed that if I'd had 3 children and been in a cinema this may have been more difficult!)

I have 5 year old twins now and my daughter gets scared watching most children's films because of the scary 'baddies' in them, but I'm not going to start telling all parents to avoid them!

138161,5,0792153685,"Jean Jacque Annund has a rare gift, he seems to be able to almost communicate to the animals he films exactly what he wants them to do, and the animals do it. Not only do they do it, but also they do it well. The bear is Annund's animal adventure prior to Two Brothers, and it's an even more daring endeavor than the enduring and tragic tale of Kumal and Sangah. The reason its so daring is because there is less than ten minutes of human dialogue in the entire film. Despite the lack of human dialogue there's still a lot about this film that makes it enjoyable, watching animals do what they do, and communicate with each other and others in their environment. While some parents may express concern over the ""violence"" of this film I must stress that the movie isn't as violent as it is sadly realistic. The sad thing that parents need to realize is that people DO this sort of thing to the animals, and it needs to stop. That's the whole point of this film. We have our place in the world, and we need to stop encroaching on theirs. It's a message as necessary to children as the message of Schindler's List. They need to see this while they still have a heart to care. The Bear was the film that got me into Animal Welfare Activism. And even now I am a proud supporter of the World Wildlife Federation and the Save the Tiger Fund with what time and money I can give. We need more activists, more people that care. And the best way to do it is to let the kids see this film and be exposed to the reality of human ignorance, and cruelty, and the mindless slaughter of innocent animals for petty sport. Aside from that this film shines on many artistic levels. It's a true classic for animal lovers, and I love it. This film does for animals what Star Wars did for special effects.

The film takes you through the trials of Youk's first year as a bear cub. You see that Youk and other animals have feelings, just like people do. To those who say that we share no qualities with animals, you are wrong. In my opinion, animals are more truthful in their emotions and feelings than people often are.
This film has a very touching story, with powerful scenes that will make you laugh, cry, and put you on the edge of your seat from the start of the film through to its finale.

This amazing film provides an almost unbelievable window into the lives of the two bears, from their perspective, with but or two false steps. There are many small, non-dramatic moments that cumulatively fill the canvas. The attention to detail is extraordinary.
With hardly any dialogue, only the spare speech of the hunters, the film yet moves forward, sometimes dramatically, more often over over a small moment. In many instances we do not see the entire animal or person, but only enough so that the essence of whatever is occurring is so clear and immediate. The film makers' framing, shot selection, and editing is so completely convincing.
With awe inspiring scenery that takes away the breath (and pangs over missing the deeply felt emotion that backcountry beauty has provided me) and a view of animals being animals in nature.
Yes, there is some sentimentality. But it is little compared to most other fictional films, and I no longer think of animals in the wilderness as I did before.

What makes this movie so great is the way all of its characters are portrayed. There is no clear villian or hero, but rather simple creatures following their basic instincts, including the humans. Our first impulse is to judge the humans (played wonderfully by Jack Wallace and Tcheky Karyo) as evil, but really pay attention and you'll find they are quite, well, human. The bear characters, Youk (cub) and Bart (grizzly) portray emotions and feelings stronger than any other animal in any movie I've ever seen. They truly steal the show here.
But the obvious difference in the sides is that while the bears kill only for survival, humans kill for recreation, which, as this movie clearly intended to say, is wrong. ...

But never mind the middling source material; the important thing is that director Jean-Jacques Annaud has used it as the basis of a truly astonishing film.  The cinematography alone justifies the project -- but it must be seen in its proper widescreen ratio.  Once the film is panned and scanned, most of the stunning British Columbia landscapes are lost, leaving viewers with a slow-paced, sentimental story about a bear cub they never quite see.
But in the proper widescreen ratio, the film's apparent flaws turn to strengths.  The slow pace gives us time to contemplate characters' relationships to the land (even as it allows the film to establish its own rhythm).  And the wild vastness of this land undercuts any sentimentality; it is always clear that the land is harsh, and that its dangers are real and terrifying.
By the way, this is probably the only film to depict (albeit fictionally) an animal getting high on psychedelic mushrooms.  I suppose this is because bears don't have the sense to just say no.  Or maybe it's just because the director is French.

One disturbing point about a movie that has been made with such care: the most memorable segment of the musical score, played several times during the movie and throughout the closing credits, is in fact by Tchaikovsky.  It's his Barcarolle in G minor, Op. 37, No. 6 (""June"" from ""The Seasons"" suite).  Nowhere in the film is Tchaikovsky credited as the composer.

Of course, the Blu-ray (which wasn't made exclusively for kiddies) avoids that issue altogether, as there's no full screen hack job on it - and the picture quality's a lot better, of course.",1525046400,,664,4.462809917355372

The story line is attention grabbing and I have no idea how they captured the essence of wild animals as they did (especially before special effects became so sophisticated)!",1517875200,,313,5.0
7792016,5,0792153685,"A fantastic film!  Beautifully filmed, and the life story of the little bear is true to nature and deeply touching without sentimentality.  Teaches a great lesson in humanity  and kindness.  Great touches of humor, too.",1517616000,,219,5.171428571428572
