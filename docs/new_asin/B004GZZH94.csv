4374377,5,B004GZZH94,"Okay, so I had never ever seen Black Butler until I attended AMA a few weeks ago. There I met a woman dressed as Madam Red and attended the midnight showing of it. I was intrigued by the show (I only got to see one episode) so after I returned home I had to buy it. I bought both parts and watched them immediately after their arrival. After I started watching I found myself unable to stop. I literally stayed up until 3 in the morning watching this show!! Then my best friend borrowed it and now we are incredibly obsessed with it! This is defiantly my favorite anime of ALL TIME! My favorite episode has to be the extra one where they put on Hamlet. ""Hamlet, I want to wrap you in the bacon of my arms. Ham, Ham, Ham, I want to be your Eggs! Ham!"" - Viscount Druitt :D :D",1310947200,2,774,4.065359477124183
4374378,5,B004GZZH94,"I love it! I fell in love with the Black Butler series from the moment I first picked up the manga when it first came out last year, and when I heard about the anime I was quick to jump at the chance to add it to my collection. Anyone who hasn't read the manga or bought the DVD's yet should go out and buy them now before you miss out. *lol*

Now I can't wait until Season 2 of Black Butler comes out. I hope it comes out as quickly as Season 1, Part 2 did, and they don't make us wait until the end of the year, or even NEXT YEAR for that matter, for season 2 to come out. *pouts*",1304035200,,582,3.731707317073171
4374379,5,B004GZZH94,"The folks on DeviantArt.com were such a twitter about Black Butler that when I had the CHANCE to watch the entire first season, I knew I'd eventually succumb to curiosity and utilize that chance. Although, I hesitated--I don't do well with horror movies, and I couldn't quite imagine a story about a boy selling his soul to a very dark, savvy demon butler to work out well. Especially because there are so many animes that don't mind being disturbingly violent.

That being said, as soon as I started, it couldn't be stopped. I was taken in, dark or not. Though... I never thought I would laugh so hard, despite the grim subject matter. I constantly found myself laughing out loud! Sebastian is not a demon who's above goofy repeat lines or a good solid pun. He may be out to swallow Ciel's soul, but you really seem to forgive him because he's so fun to watch and so fun to listen to. That and the anime will slide back and forth between a ""Hello Kitty"" style to something similar to ""Vampire Hunter D"" so quickly, it will make your head spin or, if you're me, giggle with delight.

That being said--it gets dark on the last episode. I won't spoil anything, but you should know that you might get disturbed by the darkness. And you will probably not laugh, unless there's something wrong with you, because there's nothing funny about it. The last couple of episodes can make you get goosebumps, and the end (which is the 12th episode) will probably slap a frown on your face and it will stay there for at least a few solid hours. Still, I can't take away a star. It DOES *end* solidly, despite the end being a little hard to swallow. I actually had trouble sleeping after I saw it.

You get the treat in Part 2 to learn more about Ciel, more about his parents, more about the contract, and more about his servants and WHY he allows for so much incompetance. Truthfully, I wished there was more. Still, there isn't too much meat on any one episode--they're EXTREMELY short episodes. That being said, they're all very good. But if you think you can just sit down and watch them one at a time, think again, because you would find yourself very unsatisfied if you did.

In fact--my only FAIR complaint is that the beginning title and end title together take up about 6 minutes of every 24 minute episode because no one told them a show's title should only take about 30 seconds...  In this season, you'll watch about an hour of title or more. Still, it won't put you off to keep coming back until you reach the grim conclusion. After all, he's one HELL of a butler!",1303948800,18,2562,4.454157782515991

4374385,5,B004GZZH94,"Unlike the japanese box sets, we don't get all the nice extras here in the US. But it's still worth the purchase. Sadly episode 13.5 doesn't seem to be on either parts of the set. Which for a collector as myself is abit of a disappointment. But atleast they included the ova =D Which is nice.

It takes place where part 1 ended of course. But the wait was entirely worth it, even if we didn't get the character art that the japanese sets get.",1299542400,3,442,4.2
4374386,5,B004GZZH94,"Update: I deleted my 1st post because I didn't seem to make it clearly and I wanted people to get off my butt with my recent post.  (And people have been addressing me as a HE and not a SHE...)Plus, I've purchased both this part and the 1st part and the manga by the way.  Not trying to sound rude or anything but people have different views of this.  So, this is what I see in this second part:

A while ago FUNimation released the first installment of Black Butler's first season. The show proved to be a fun enigmatic supernatural romp with fan-service (on the yaoi side) and a rather interesting premise. Ultimately I was left with a positive impression of the show and was eagerly anticipating the second installment. Guess what I just finished watching?

In case you missed my review of the first release, Black Butler is a series about a young boy named Ciel Phantomhive. He is the heir to the Phantomhive estate and along with the riches comes power to some extent, as he's a tool for the Queen to use as she sees fit. Cie's reputation precedes him in nearly every circumstance, which is remarkable considering he's just a young boy. Behind every great boy is a sketchy man (at least in the perfect yaoi world) and in this case that guy is Sebastian, Ciel's butler.

Sebastian isn't just an ordinary butler. Sure he can make a mean set of tea and crumpets, but he also happens to be a demon that answers to Ciel's command. The cost of such a relationship is the inevitable consumption of Ciel's soul by Sebastian. I suppose it's a small price to pay for power and influence, even if it just lasts for a short time. In the first volume we were introduced to the two protagonists and a host of secondary cast members. The series was often episodic in the sense that there were self-contained storylines, but most of these lasted for multiple episodes. A little bit of lore came through towards the end of the first half, and this second volume picks up where the original release left off.

This installment picks up with episode 13. As the episode opens we are introduced to Prince Soma and his servant, Agni, who quite literally wind up bumping into Ciel and Sebastian. Soon enough they mend their rocky introduction and the pair of master and servant actually wind up staying at the Phantomhive Estate for some time. There's more to Agni's character than initially meets the eye, however, and by the end of this storyline we actually get to see the Queen in the subsequent episode. The conclusion of the Soma and Agni plotline is rather corny, but there's a certain charm to it.

As the show moves forward there are some episodic episodes, and a smallish storyline that deals with an angel of sorts. The show continues to introduce new characters at it heads towards its finale, though I must say they add something to the show. The villains in this series have always been intriguing in a sense and I'm pleased to report this installment is no different. I also don't want to divulge much about the conclusion of the series, but let's just say it's rather dramatic and finite (though there is a second season, so maybe it's not as definite as one might think).

If you saw, and appreciated, the first installment of Black Butler, then you'll definitely enjoy what's in store with these episodes. The show provides some solid adventures at its midpoint and towards its final run, and ultimately it's entertaining. I'd still profess that it's not entirely for everyone though. The yaoi fan-service, though relatively light, is still omnipresent, and that's definitely something that's not for everyone. Even so the show is intriguing and enjoyable enough to warrant a universal recommendation.",1297641600,3,3701,4.681538461538461

4374395,3,B004GZZH94,"I wasn't a fan of the ending, but I liked most of it. The characters aren't very dynamic and some of them are more annoying than anything.

4374396,5,B004GZZH94,"Let me start by saying this: I am a total Black Butler fan, but have only recently become one. I love the manga and read it before watching the anime, and well... I was shocked at how different the two were.

The anime is very well put-together, without unnecessary flashbacks or fillers, and the music and voice-acting all very much add to the increasingly dark tone in this second part of Season 1 (episodes 13-24.)

But one thing you MUST be aware of if you haven't seen this before is that the ending is NOTHING LIKE anything that has happened in the manga up to now (Book 14 is the most recently released at the time of this review.) It diverges completely from the manga's plot, adding characters - and character deaths - that were not included in the books. It was a bit of an adjustment for me at first, but I learned to love them both separately, and so it hasn't affected my opinion of the anime at all.

J. Michael Tatum and Brina Palencia once again give great performances as Sebastian and Ciel, as do the rest of the cast. The accents of some of the characters, especially the more minor characters, are pretty rough at times, but this doesn't detract from the enjoyment in my opinion.

The DVD's packaging is pretty nice, too, with gorgeous art on the front as well as on the two thin cases contained in the cardboard cover. It is fairly sturdy, as well, and doesn't feel like it will just fall apart like some TV seasons' collection packaging does.

Overall, this is a very nice collection of a very entertaining anime. If you're a fan of Black Butler, pick yourself up a copy today!",1376956800,,1599,4.4436860068259385

4374405,3,B004GZZH94,I was actualy excited to hear black butler was going to be turn into an anime. And I enjoyed the first volume so much that I ran out to go get the second volume. I thought they tried to stay true to the manga as they could since there only been about 6 books so far but with a few different story lines. But I just hope it doesn't end like it did in the anime I thought was really depressing. You already know there was a good chance it's not going to have a happy ending but I hope they don't kill everyone off that's just so sad.,1316304000,,531,3.8807339449541285
