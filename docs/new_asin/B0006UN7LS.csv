8043478,5,B0006UN7LS,"As a teacher of Creative Writing at a college level, who has an MFA in Creative Writing, I want to concur with the other teacher. Poetry Lounge is a wonderful, if not remarkable, DVD to show Creative Writing students, or any student for that matter. My students loved it. The poets give helpful tips about how to write spoken word poetry, while the spoken word pieces the diverse (not yuppie) poets read are tight and contain moving socially conscious messages, I couldn't ask for more. As faculty, I could check out the DVD from our college media center for free, but wanted to own both Poetry Lounge and Poetry Lounge 2.

I'm not sure what DVD the other reviewer saw!",1522108800,,669,4.575

8043480,5,B0006UN7LS,"I purchased this DVD for my ninth grade English class (my seniors asked to see it also) in order to show them that poetry is not ""just dry words"" on paper or written by ""old dead people"". This DVD showed them how they can be creative and passionate about the things that interest them. Profanity-wise: a ""damn"" or ""hell"" (I think) and one curse word that is bleeped out. The length is great (30 or so minutes), long enough to hold their attention, but not too long where they became bored. The poets speak about subjects of self-love, self-esteem,and racism (very interesting duo piece with a white poet taking the black's man perspective and the black poet taking the white's man perspective). The readings borderline rap and it was great to show my students that you can express yourself without loads of profanity and bashing women (or anyone else). The readings are postive and relevant to young people, acutally all people. I plan to purchase The Poetry Lounge 2 and 3.",1340928000,2,974,4.701754385964913
8043481,4,B0006UN7LS,Do not listen to the negative reviewer who called this lame. I am an English and Creative Writing teacher and I found this DVD to be a great tool for the classroom. I watched it with my 13 year old daughter who loved it. The messages of the poets are timely and important and they relate to teenagers AND adults as well. The poets featured are talented and creative and perform their poems with passion and skill. I can't wait to purchase the second and third volumes.,1318032000,4,468,4.390804597701149
8043482,1,B0006UN7LS,It was less than an hour and I suppose I was looking for something more like Def Poetry.. You get nothing like it... a couple of yuppies just trying to explain how to write your own slams.. LAME.,1188777600,2,195,4.157894736842105
