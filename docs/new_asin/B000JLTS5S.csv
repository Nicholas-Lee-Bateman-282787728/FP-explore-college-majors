2675811,3,B000JLTS5S,"You can most always rate any movie with Richard Chamberlain in it with an ""A"" in my opinion.  There's no heavy involved plot here and you'll pretty much know which way the story is headed.  STILL....No blood, no guts, no drug busts or super heros....just a nice clean movie that gives you that warm fuzzy feeling at the end.",1227225600,,324,4.47457627118644
2675812,4,B000JLTS5S,"I am a huge Richard Chamberlain fan. This had a host of excellent players, too like Karen Allen. Not the kind of a movie that is a box office smash but a quiet movie that makes you think about age, where you are in life, the past and future. Beautiful photography. I don't want to relate the plot before you view the movie. Do view this movie. No loud bangs and special effect just a quiet thoughtful movie.",1202428800,,407,4.230769230769231

 A great love story with Richard Chamberlain, Karen Allen an Hal Holbrook giving believable and moving performances. It has drama and romance.
 Chamberlain, after betrayal 20 years earlier of his love, Karen Allen and her Eskimo family, comes back to the region to see his dying uncle. At first, Karen does not want to see him, but later, they get back together. But, what Chamberlain does not know, and what has never been told to him, is that he has a son who is grown up and had been raised by Karen and her husband, who later had died. This is where the drama comes. Does Karen tell Chamberalin about the son, which may upset the son who loved his adopted father, or not?
 A great sentimental love story.",1200614400,,886,5.398550724637682
2675814,5,B000JLTS5S,"This came out as a book first, then a movie. They are a little different. It is one of my favorites. It has a little bit of everything. Passion,longing,betrayal and forgiveness and romance.
  Richard Chamberlain plays Dane Corvin and Hannah Raven is played by Karen Allen, and Hal Holbrook is Dane's uncle.

  Karen Allen is an artist and Richard Chamberlain is in wild life. Then comes all the surprises. It is filmed in Canada

2675816,5,B000JLTS5S,"When I saw that Richard Chamberlain and Karen Allen together, this just didn't seem like it would work. I was so wrong!  This roll for both of them is so fitting. Her sweet quietness and the back woods man in Richard worked out perfectly. I was touched by the passion that grew in these two characters.  I was nice to see true love win over in every way. For all of the bad events to have been solved and made better.  This is a must watch for all hopeless romantics!",1177027200,,467,4.166666666666667
2675817,5,B000JLTS5S,"The movie is an enthralling, romantic drama full of passion, longing, betrayal and forgiveness. One has a fever with the central figures with and hopes sincerely that everything turns to the good. The subject is built up logically, the tension grows constantly up to the countdown.

Between Richard Chamberlain and Karen Allen to all the chemistry is right. The sparks of the passion jump. They form her part both very well. Also the cast of the other parts, in particular the part of the uncle, has succeeded very well. I love this film and find, he is - what Richard Chamberlain concerns - one of his best at the ripe age.",1168473600,,624,4.621621621621622
2675818,4,B000JLTS5S,"All The Winters That Have Been is  a compelling  story , based on the  novel written by Evan Maxwell. It is divided in two parts, each containing a strong message.  In the first part,  agent  Dane Corvin  (Richard Chamberlain) is posing as a businessman interested in buying  fish illegally caught by members of the  Swinomish Indian Tribal Community. A law passed to limit fishing and  protect fish resources in the area makes it impossible for this community  to continue living from their traditional salmon and shellfish fisheries if they do not resort to poaching .  Although it is true that the Swinomish violate the law on fishing, this law does not take into account the fact that they have always made a living out of fishing and cannot survive without.  Dane Corvin, who falls in love with the  half Swinomish and half Irish Hannah ( Karen Allen),  understands the plight of the Swinomish but fails to postpone the operation. The arrest of Hannah's brother puts an end to Dane's and Hannah's  relationship  leaving both characters deeply hurt.
The second part starts when 20 years later Dane Corvin comes back to the area to visit his dying uncle (Hal Holbrook) whose last wish is to bring  Dane and Hannah together again.  Dane who has been hurting and missing Hannah for 20 years has taken refuge in his loneliness that keeps  him most of the time in Alaska for preservation campaigns in favor of bears and wolves. Hannah who has become an important artist  and whose art contributes to the development and well-being of  the  Swinomish community,  has  moved on with her life and her secret.  Hannah unconsciously has forgiven Dane but circumstances prevent her from verbalizing her forgiveness. She has to meet Dane again in order to listen to her heart, accept her love for him  and tell him her secret. It is now  Dane's turn to find in his heart and soul how to reconcile all the elements of his shattered life and so make forgiveness and love the main messages of the second part of the movie.
 The great director,  Lamont Johnson,  ( who directed Richard Chamberlain in several episodes of Dr Kildare in the early 60s and in Wallenberg in 1985)  succeeds in making a movie with a quick sequence of scenes that follow each other very smoothly but allows  at the same time the actors to make great performances and fully take advantage of the dialog that sounds in some instances like a theater play...  Richard Chamberlain, Karen Allen and Hal Holbrook  are magnificent,  sober intensity is the key word for their acting in a movie that allies hard facts of life with  tenderness, romance, love and forgiveness.  Beautiful locations in British Columbia,  excellent lighting and spectacular photography  - you really feel the cutting touch of the crisp air blowing from the bright blue sea and you smell the fresh fragrance of the dark green spruces -  are an added reason why I like to watch and re-watch this movie.  The sunset  light that embraces with its magic aura Dane standing on the porch briefly  reminds a scene of Marcel Camus  renowned  Orfeo Negro of 1959.",1166572800,,3087,4.750472589792061
8151813,5,B000JLTS5S,"All the winters that have been is a really magic tale about decisions and human relations. In the beginning it is the story of a man who has the dilemma to decide if he betrays his job or the family of his love: A situation resembling a classic greek drama.  He tries but finds no way out and decides - as most men probably would - to do his job. After that he and the betrayed pay a high pice for that decision: She hates him for the betrayal, he doesn't dare to confront and hurt her even more. So he leaves. They are separated for many years and need much help and courage to find back together in the end. But - and that is the magic - they find the help and the courage. Having just gone through the death of a person they both liked -  a warm, caring person - they help each other and they dare to be completely honest for the first time. They find out, that being there for a person can be more important than relationship. And they still love ...",1522108800,,954,4.042328042328043
8151814,3,B000JLTS5S,"I really like Richard Chamberlain and most of his movies, but this one was a bit strange, and I didn't like it much.  Plus, to team him up to Karen Allen was a very unusual choice in women, even though she is a good actress, I was not impressed.  Just not what I had expected in this movie and now I'm having to try and sell it just to recoup some of my money back, as what I had paid out for this movie wasn't cheap, and definitely not worth it.  So disappointed in myself for purchasing this.",1509321600,,494,4.020408163265306
