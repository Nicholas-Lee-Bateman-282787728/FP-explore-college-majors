1259653,2,B000038I18,"A strange movie about a particularly horrific rape, JADED unnecessarily plays up the male-oriented eroticism associated to rape and voyeurism as the woman's victimization is show progressively over a series of disjointed flashbacks.  Interestingly enough, the rapist(s) and victim are both female, also feeding into another series of male fantasies.  The conclusion is rather forced and, sadly, unclear ... leaving the viewer wondering about the true consequences against those who perpetrated the deed.  Certain scenes, particularly of the rape sequence, are not for the light-hearted.",1020902400,14,586,5.870588235294117
1259654,5,B000038I18,"I bought this movie on dvd because I was able to get a discount on it.  It seemed to have an interesting premise so I watched it with an open mind and began to find myself drawn into the story. First of all, its a different story than I've ever seen in a movie.  The subject of women raping each other is something that most films don't touch on.  I found it to be an interesting portrayal of something that actually could happen and probably does more than anyone will ever know.  Its not a big-budget film but Carla Gugino was very good in the movie.  The two women were both wild, crazy and sinister characters that made the movie interesting to watch.  It unfolds rather slowly but I found it to be good enough to watch more than once.  I liked the way it made you think about a subject that no one talks about.
If you are looking for erotica, you won't find that much in this movie but if you are looking for interesting film noir, this is a good one to watch.  My only complaint was that the DVD quality wasn't all that good but the film itself was quite entertaining!",982886400,28,1074,4.204878048780488
1259655,1,B000038I18,"....This movie never decided whether it wanted to be a police procedural, a psychological/character study, or an indictment of the legal system. Instead it covered all bases. Poorly.
The police were incompetant. The lead detective investigating the rape has sufficient evidence to arrest the two suspects. A competant detective would have gotten the arrest warrants, arrested both suspects when they didn't talk, and never given them a chance to talk to each other. Alex would have crumbled in 5 minutes of interrogation, and the movie would have been over. Instead, our detective goes to see Pat, but doesn't bother to ask the name of the other woman present. Turns out it's Alex, the other suspect. The detective asks Pat about the incident, then leaves, having given both perps a heads up and plenty of time to start getting their stories straight and destroy the evidence.
The characters are unbelievable. We either don't know why they act the way they do, or are given an unbelievable explanation. For example, the victim has a ""secret"" she goes to great lengths to hide, but it's something she did when she was 7 or 8. It didn't seem like much of a secret to me. We are never given any information about why she feels the need to hide, just told the secret and expected to agree that the victim should be hiding it. Second example: the defense lawyer acts as if this ""secret"" will let her get her clients off. To reach this conclusion, the lawyer has to disregard the overwhelming physical evidence and assume that the jury will have the collective IQ of a turnip.
Finally, the acting is simply not very good. To be fair, a great deal of this is due to the script with which the actors were afflicted. However, it seemed that the 'sleepy seaside town' setting infected the actors or director. There was no tension, no energy, no suspense. The whole movie is flat and dream-like. If you're thinking of buying Jaded, be sure to rent it first so you know what you're getting.",976060800,11,1978,4.703170028818444
1259656,5,B000038I18,"The cover, the nudity, the use of the ""f"" word, and the R rating may make you think this is an exploitation movie but actually director and co-writer Caryn Krooth's psychological drama is full of surprises. It  begins with Meg Harris (Carla Gugino) claiming to have been raped by two  women. Rape is apparently legally defined as a male crime only so, in order  that the assailants are prosecuted to the full extent of the law, Meg must  have them charged with sodomy which is defined in terms of subjugation and  force. The rape is shown in flashbacks but Krooth suggests rather than  makes the acts explicit. This strategy probably goes one better than the  scene in The Accused since here, in spite of featuring 3 naked females, the  sex is de-eroticised and marginalised. The narrative follows the course of  the investigation leading to the trial, which Krooth cleverly skips, and  the plot develops in more and more interesting and unexpected ways. The  subject is probably handled so well because the writers and director are  female, and the strength of the film is the acting of the women. There are  good performances from Aida Turturro as a policewoman, Catherine Dent as  the prosecuting attortney, Lorraine Toussaint as the defendants attorney  and Ellen Greene in a cameo. The actors playing the rapists aren't given  much depth though and oddly, Krooth's male characters are all weak. Meg has  additional problems so Gugino's twitches become repetitive and even the one  good time she is given is marred by her wearing a disfiguring black  lipstick. Could Krooth be saying that shade is fortuitous?  Don't ask me  what the title is supposed to mean though.",964656000,44,1671,4.896428571428571
1259687,5,B000038I18,"I first watched this movie about 15 years ago.  It is a very disturbing movie, but it provides an important point.  Violent crimes can come from any one and be directed at any one.  Carla Gugina is an outstanding actress who does not get full credit for the quality of her performances.  This is a difficult role for her, but I think she does a great job in playing the part.",1384819200,,375,4.23943661971831

1259691,4,B000038I18,"Considering the storyline evolving around a woman seeking justice on two other women for sexually assaulting her, I'm going to say this film was well put together. You even learn back in 1996 the year of this films release that the law changed its ways and begin taking rape victims accounts more seriously when it wasn't always a man who was accused. Beforehand only a man could be charged with the crime of rape and not women.",1355961600,,428,4.571428571428571

1259694,3,B000038I18,"I own this movie and am never disappointed by repeated viewings. It is is not, however, a film for everyone. It is stark and ugly in the vein of The Accused in its depiction of a twist on a rape trial. There is very poor character development here, but of course how much can you manage in 2 hours? There was much attention paid to the development of one of the rapist (the actress's name escapes my memory but she also appears in the fabulous ""The Intern""), but the other rapist is left as just a nasty bully motivated by, um, nastiness? I love the performance of the main character and her reaction to the rape. However, there are flashbacks that elude to a past that is horrifying but none of that is fully developed and thus only distracts from the true plot line.... same for her relationship with the vaguely introduced best friend/potential lover/mainstream drop out??? Who is this guy anyway??? Again there is a lot of extraneous material here, but the basic story will draw you in and is highly entertaining.
 I like this movie despite how my review might read. I think the concept is good if not well developed and there are a couple great performances (the main character and the defense lawyer and investigator, along with the bar owner). I may have an attration to this film because of the fact I am a lawyer and the interesting twist the way the local law is written affects the plot, but I think a layman can appreciate this fact as much as I can. I sincerely hope this is *not* based on a true story and if it is,I hope the laws have been re-written to clearly reflect the dilemna faced by both the detective and the victim here (Note: the detective is Tony Soprano's sister in a bit over the top, but nonetheless effective role).
  It is well worth a watch if nothing else, but if you are a fan of indie character films as I am, this is one for your collection.",1046649600,21,1878,4.390804597701149
1259695,5,B000038I18,"to tell you the truth, i mean thats what i expected to, i mean just look at the girls on the cover(though i want to make one thing clear, the 2 on the cover are models used for a cover,  they are not the actors in the movie,  the girls in the movie are on the back in the black and green tinted picture of them all dancing, though the large photo on the cover is carla gugino ""meg""), ""BUT"" there is also blood on the cover, is there not.  Its about a girl named Meg.  A strait girl.  Shes had a rough night and wants to go to the bar for drinks with her friend.  She ends up going stag and meets up with 2 girls named pat and alex at ""jacks"" a local bar.  jack introduces pat and alex to meg and they buy her a drink.  What she believes to be a fun night with the girls is actually a meditated sadistic rape being planned out.  They go to the beach together to skinny dip and they sense she may be bi curious and decide to use that against her and they cut her up, rape her and leave her for dead.  for the most part this movie is prep for their trial.  See a while back women couldn't be tried for rape in the first degree.  it didn't exist in legal terms, only sodomy in the first.  it follows her throuought the process of trying to get justice.
its a great movie.  i wouldnt be rating it if i didn't think so.",1045440000,10,1313,3.887218045112782
1259696,1,B000038I18,"I had this movie given to me, and have to admit, I am glad that I did not pay money for it.
The back of the box makes it seem like some kind of sex triangle, with 2 women trying to seduce her.  But the reality in this movie is far from that.
In reality, the main subject is the victim of a vicious and sadistic rape by the two other characters.  There was absolutely nothing in this that I found interesting at all.
Even movies like Silence Of The Lambs and Wild Things (which the box tries to compare this movie to) were riveting, because of the unexpected turns and suspense.
But Jaded has none of this.  It concentrates on the rapeists and the sick relationship with the boyfriend of one of them.  And the persuit of a videotape that may prove the victims story is true.
While it does show that same sex rape is possible, it is not a movie worth watching.
If at all possible, pass this movie up at all costs.",1036368000,5,911,4.159090909090909
