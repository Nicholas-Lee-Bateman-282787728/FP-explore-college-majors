7888925,5,6305436312,"I had been trying to obtain a copy of this dvd for some time and was delighted to finally purchase it via amazon. It is a beautifully presented dvd with three superb examples of what makes film noir (a movement, not a genre!). Aldrich's direction is as tight and claustrophobic as you would expect and the cinematography of John Alton can be seen to define all the charactersitics associated with noir. Long may films such as these be available on dvd.",1020124800,4,452,4.592592592592593
7888926,5,6305436312,"It was a great idea from the Roan Group to present three movies directed by Anthony Mann in the late forties. Unfortunately, their copies have seen better days ! Too bad.
So, the sound and the images of HE WALKED BY NIGHT  are simply awful. There's a slight improvement for RAW DEAL and only T-MEN  could be qualified as visible for the average DVD addict.
But, as always,  if the movie is interesting, I try to forget the imperfections and  concentrate myself on the movie. And, believe me, these three are good  movies. I personally have a little preference for RAW DEAL with its typical  Film Noir mood : a hero, played by Dennis O'Keefe, two girls - the blonde  and the brunette - and a sadistic villain impersonated by Raymond Burr.
HE WALKED BY NIGHT and T-MEN are typical examples of the  semi-documentary style used in a lot film noir of the 1945-1950 period.  They present a case which, if you want to believe the narrator, was a real  story. Well, well, well. Naturally, it's one of the numerous clich&eacute;s used  by Hollywood in order to nail the viewer.
Director Anthony Mann is known  for his westerns of the 50's starring James Stewart ; he deserves also to  be recognized as a Master of the Film Noir genre.
No menu... and hardly  a scene access.
A DVD for your library.",955929600,15,1288,4.51948051948052
7888927,2,6305436312,Three entertaining movies but the sound quality is so poor that it greatly detracts from the experience.,949276800,5,104,5.176470588235294
7888928,4,6305436312,"This is so representative of the B-movies of the '40's and early '50's!  BUT - Director, Anthony Mann and Cinematographer, John Alton decided to be artistic, despite the low budgets and moderately corny scripts.  I wonder  if the studio heads even knew what was going on?  Anyway, Mann and Alton  weren't the only ones to explore Film Noir (see Orson Welles' ""Lady  from Shang Hai,"" for example, or ""The Third Man""), but if  you haven't seen these three films like I hadn't, since I was a kid, you  should take advantage of the availability. Two of them were released on  Laserdisc, awhile back, but were pricey.  This is reasonable, there are 3  movies, and the film prints and DVD transfers look great, too!",932601600,10,709,4.682926829268292
