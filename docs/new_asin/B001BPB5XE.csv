8284131,5,B001BPB5XE,"I cannot get enough of the Stooges and their silly slapstick comedy! I have to say I prefer the colorized version of the DVD versus the black and white, though both were done flawlessly. The Stooges is where comedy began, and so glad Legend Films continues to bring these old classics back. My husband loved watching these as much as I did so we both gave this one a 5 star rating! Well done!",1396137600,,392,4.3108108108108105
8284132,5,B001BPB5XE,"The Stooges' famous intro music, ""Three Blind Mice,"" takes me back to a simpler, happier time.  A time without color, a time with grainy film, a time with Shemp...

Well, maybe that wasn't such a happy time after all!  But, fear not, your nostalgic fantasies need not go unrealized because of technological limitations, because now you can watch the fabulous Three Stooges shorts in full, re-mastered color! (Nothing can be done, however, about Shemp.)

Classic movie house Legend Films has taken several of the boys' most distinguished shorts, including the fan-favorite Disorder in the Court, applied its trademark colorization process to them, and the result is wonderful.  In fact, the colorization is so faithful to reality (through extensive research, I understand) that you might be aghast at the director's use of bright colors, until you consider that they were selected to look unique when shown in the day's standard grayscale.

Though the shorts are billed as being in color, and this is in fact the highlight of this particular DVD, Legend has also provided the untouched black and white versions along with their rainbow-imbued counterparts, so you don't have to make a choice between the new experience and the nostalgic one, you can have both for the same price.",1227657600,,1278,5.090909090909091
