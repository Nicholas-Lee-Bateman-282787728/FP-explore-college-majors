5091599,5,B007JLATW2,"Magic Johnson contracted the HIV virus through unprotected sexual relations.  In 1991 he was given the diagnosis by the team doctor, and a short time later, he made the announcement that he was retiring from basketball.  The announcement was such a shock that most people who heard it knew exactly where they were and what they were doing at that very moment.  Magic retired from basketball, not knowing what he was going to do or how long he had to live.  Fear could have overcome him.  He could have slunk away into isolation.  He could have given up and died.  But he didn't do any of those things.  Instead, with the support of his loving, wonderful wife, Cookie, he decided to be the face of HIV and bring awareness to the world that anyone could get this disease, not just gay men. At the time, an HIV diagnosis was akin to having leprosy in biblical times.  HIV infected people were feared and shunned.  They were avoided like the plaque, for so little was known about HIV transmission, that people were legitimately scared of contracting it.  Magic Johnson dispelled all the fear in his courageous stance to bring worldwide awareness to HIV/AIDS.

This documentary, one of the very best in the ESPN 30/30 series, tells what happened to Ervin Magic Johnson from the day of his announcement to now, 20 years later (2011).  If his story does not inspire the heart, either there is no heart, or the heart has stopped beating.  This is what TV is meant to be: it tells a story, it educates, and it inspires.  It is riveting viewing.

In this jaded world we live in, where people are often not what they seem (Lance Armstrong), I admit not have many heroes; but Magic Johnson is my true hero.  His courage, his honesty, and his unwillingness to back down from what was at that time a certain death sentence, speaks volumes about the man.  The dictionary defines a hero this way:  ""a man of distinguished courage or ability, admired for his brave deeds and noble qualities.""  John Wayne added that ""courage was being scared to death but saddling up anyway.""  Magic Johnson admitted his overwhelming fear when he was first diagnosed, but this fear did not stop him from going forward.  He did not quit.  He overcame his own fear, and the fears of all society, and emerged a hero, a noble man of distinguished courage.  In an age where there are no heroes, Magic Johnson is my hero.

I absolutely loved this documentary.  It is 5-stars plus. Thank you to ESPN for producing this gem.

The bonus features were a pleasant surprise.  I had never seen the full press conference before that I recall.  The film itself made me cry, as details of this day often do, but then Magic would smile and make me happy again.",1343692800,5,390,4.216216216216216

Magic's story is truly inspirational and I feel the kids really relate well to this video over others due to the content......they really love basketball! As for the film itself, as an adult it is extremely interesting. I know I had no idea about his 25+ year battle with HIV. I knew he had it, and was one of the greatest players, but that was about the extent of my knowledge. This video goes into details the stigmas involving Magic after his announcement from fans and players. This is a must for any basketball fan and a great way to teach kids about HIV/AIDS.",1463443200,,654,4.368852459016393
8518373,5,B007JLATW2,"The announcement was one of the biggest moments in sports history.  I was a young teenager when it happened and I remember it was a huge story.  On par with the OJ Simpson trial, it was that big of a media event.  Magics announcement really brought the AIDS epidemic home to the American public like nothing else before it.  The Ronald Reagan administration did a terrible job of identifying the virus and educating the public about the disease.  Until Magic came out that he had the disease did the media and American public really start to pay attention and get educated about the disease.

Magic Johnson was a megastar someone who transcended sports itself.  He seemed to be universally liked by just about everyone even if you hated the Lakers and always rooted against them.  (Portland Oregon native no Laker worship in this review go Blazers.)  He was an advertising marketers dream with a million dollar smile and easy going attitude.  Magic had tons of charisma and he was an exceptional athlete and team leader.  Looking back at other documentaries Magic was not a huge trash talker like Michael Jordan, or Larry Bird.  All Magic had to do was tell them to look up at the scoreboard.

The documentary focuses solely on Magic Johnsons point of view and it is fascinating viewing.  Magic goes through his whole basketball career leading up to the announcement and the aftermath of living with the disease.  And transitioning into one of the best former athlete businessmen of all time.

The best part of the entire documentary to me is when Magic gets married to his longtime college sweetheart and when he found out he had the disease.  Magic talks about having to come home and not only tell his wife about the virus but that their unborn child could also have the disease was chilling.  He says in the documentary that is the most pressure he had in his entire life and he is totally believable down to the core.

The documentary really puts into focus what it was like at the time.  Magic seemed like such a lonely tragic figure at the time right after the announcement.  I am sure that was his come to Jesus moment where his true friends were the ones who stood by him during the hardest adversity in his life.  Larry Bird supported him which showed a lot of character on his part being his greatest rival on the court.  What I remember most was that Magics coming out was the first time the public did not see AIDS as just a gay disease.  Magic was definitely a ladies man looking at all those gorgeous women around LA at that time could you really blame him.  I actually think he did it right by waiting to get married and having his fun until he was ready to settle down with the right woman.

I remember Karl Malone getting a lot of heat because he didn't want to play basketball against Magic when he made his short return to the NBA for fear of contracting the disease.  The NBA is a very physical game and I cant find fault in Karls opinion right or wrong.

Watching Magic rebuild his image and empire was really interesting.  Small things like movie theater complexes and 24 Fitness.  Magic must have had one of the best financial strategists in the world or he is just really smart because just about everything he branched out into was a major success.  By the end of the movie Magic has defied the odds a happy family man and incredible businessman.  He is an American success story if there ever was one and is revered everywhere he goes today.
.
Overall the documentary is excellent and definitely worth your time I would rate it 5 stars.",1463443200,,3563,4.527386541471048

8518376,5,B007JLATW2,"I purchased this after seeing it on Netfilx and thought it would be great to screen in the waiting area as alot of people still believe that Mr. Johnson has somehow paid his way to a cure.  I was really drawn to the fact that he is the film's narrator.  Who better to tell your story than yourself?  Great film that helps dispel myths and stigma about this disease and hopefully will leave a lasting impression on clients in our waiting area.  I will also add that since we've started playing it, less people have complained about about when they are going to seen because they are so engrossed in what's on the tv!",1419811200,,615,4.368421052631579
