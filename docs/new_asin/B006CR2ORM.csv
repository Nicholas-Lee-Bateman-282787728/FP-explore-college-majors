4983676,4,B006CR2ORM,my little girl loves Dora! This is just added to her collection of Dora DVDs! its a cute one too!,1371427200,,97,3.9
4983677,1,B006CR2ORM,"I found this heading deceptive- as this is not a 1+ hour Dora movie, but a collection of three episodes- with only ONE being Easter related.  Amazon should remove this from the library.",1367193600,3,185,4.606060606060606
4983678,4,B006CR2ORM,"I have to write this review from him, as he was the only one to view it on the kindle. he interacted with it and was upset when we ran out of time to watch again.",1367107200,,162,3.5277777777777777
4983679,3,B006CR2ORM,"This one is rather juvenile.  It really didn't hold the attention of my preschoolers.  The younger crowd would probably enjoy it more.  It certainly only reflects a secular Easter, as expected.",1364428800,,193,5.161290322580645
4983680,5,B006CR2ORM,Keeps my daughter entertained. I love Dora and I LOVE amazon prime. It has changed my virtual life!!! Way better than netflix or hulu!,1355270400,,134,4.625
4983681,5,B006CR2ORM,Daughter loves watching Dora and this mom loves low prices. She has watched this over and over again. She loved seeing Boots with bunny ears on thought it was silly,1350777600,,164,4.5
4983682,4,B006CR2ORM,"My daughter loves this movie. She follows along with the stories. It's educational and fun. It doesn't drive me crazy, which is nice.",1334188800,,133,4.826086956521739
4983683,5,B006CR2ORM,My daughter loves Dora and we've only had this DVD since Thursday but she has watched it at least once a day.,1333843200,,109,4.0
4983684,3,B006CR2ORM,"There are 3 episodes with this instant video.  The first one is Dora's Easter Adventure, which is the same as the DVD.  It's a cute episode which my girls loved.  The other two episodes differ from the DVD version, however. The instant video version included episodes where Dora goes to school and Dora going on an egg hunt.  The DVD version includes Dora's Easter Adventure and episodes about a troll wedding and a trip to troll land.  Hoping this review will help someone else not make the same mistake, if the item description continues not to reflect these differences in the future.  Rated 3 stars due to my daughters loving Dora's Easter Adventure, but would have bought the DVD instead if I would have known that there was a difference.",1331683200,,743,4.676923076923077
4983685,4,B006CR2ORM,"My boys love Dora and this is actually the first Dora DVD we have.  The DVD features one Easter themed episode and two others.  We have literally watched this DVD on repeat for two days when we got it, they love it that much!  The Easter episode is more vibrant and newer looking compared to regular Dora but my boys didn't even notice the difference in animation.  It also features a bunny who sings though his hip-hop journey.  I liked that this episode helped my boys remember that the Easter bunny will be coming here soon.  Their favorite episodes though were the other two with featured the Grumpy Old Troll getting married and Troll Land.

Overall this is a DVD we will be watching year-round.  As much as I am not a Dora fan I do think she is great for preschoolers as my boys are always repeating after here and trying to say her Spanish words.  I actually encourage them watching Dora!  This DVD would also make a great Easter present!",1328486400,9,945,4.441860465116279

4983695,5,B006CR2ORM,"This particular item was an Easter present for my one year old niece and she absolutely adored it. Of course, Anzi, got stuck watching it a few million times, but it was definitely worth it. Dora can teach her anything Spanish, English, Counting, Manners, you name it.",1383264000,,268,4.723404255319149

8496536,5,B006CR2ORM,"The Dora series has a great formula. It pulls the kids into the story, giving them a few seconds to verbally respond to a question before moving onto the next part of the adventure or participate in a physical activity. This was inline with other Dora shows. My daughter is 5 and loved it!",1431302400,,289,4.37037037037037
