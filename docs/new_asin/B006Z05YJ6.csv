8506706,4,B006Z05YJ6,"I haven't bought any of these DVDs, but I've been hooked on seeing the various tournaments on YouTube. These are bowling tournaments for professional Japanese women bowlers, and any one of them can kick any other bowler's posteriors. The commentaries for each tournament are in Japanese, but you really don't need to know Japanese to enjoy these videos; the exciting bowling competition speaks for itself.  When I first found these videos, the first strong bowler I saw was Miki Nishimura, apparently nicknamed ""the Bomber from Osaka."" Any bowler's jaw will drop when you see her sky-high backswing. All the women are strong, dedicated bowlers.  Very exciting, addicting action for anyone, but especially if you're a league or tournament bowler.

ADDENDUM: According to Amazon, this DVD is not compatible with US DVD players, and won't play on them, as it was formatted for Region 2 (most of Asia, I guess?). That's a shame, but I can always watch them on YouTube. I hope someone can prepare a version for American DVD players. Some of the videos have English subtitles, some don't. Either way, enjoy!",1385078400,3,1101,5.005464480874317
