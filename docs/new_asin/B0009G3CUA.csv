This tape has a killer ab part,great weight training with heart pumping cardio intervals. It also has killer leg work with the Firm Fanny lifter and has very nice leg floor work.

  Beginners should start with light weight or no weight and work up to heavier dumbbells. This tape is very easy to follow though and I get a great workout. The Firm master instructers and ver pleasant and pretty and I can understand them very well. You will have a better body and buns after doing this one.",1150848000,2,646,4.278688524590164
