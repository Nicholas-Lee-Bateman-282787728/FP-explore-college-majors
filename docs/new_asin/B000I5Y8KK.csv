8144153,5,B000I5Y8KK,"The title was what got my attention, with an artistic air to it that seemed like it would have a meaningful plot. I then read the reviews and learned that it was full of fanservice, something that tends to ruin a lot of Anime.

All in all, the fanservice was obnoxious at points, but the plot was maintained in the background at an appreciable level. It wasn't so deep as to boggle any minds, but it was an enjoyable story with enough depth to keep me interested, but was layered so that if that's not your interest, you still may find something to like about this one.

For a finale, I was pleased with how they completed the character development and explored the main character's hearts and motivations in a very captivating manner.",1168732800,4,735,4.518796992481203
