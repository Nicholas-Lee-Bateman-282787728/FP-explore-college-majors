5695647,4,B00C7CLHG0,"I didn't really know what to expect when I watched this film.  I'd heard so much hype on 'certain' doc. style films, only to be met with disappointment on viewing them..in other words, I personally, couldn't see why they were getting this hype. That being said, this one gave me what I was looking for...a super natural, very realistic (loved this doc style approach, even the actors acclimated to a 'home video' atmosphere) creating an absolute terrifying view.  I loved the culture combinations, the mix of personalities inside this family.  You quite literally go from watching a darling couple, with the quirks of a newbie coming into a family of the woman he loves, to heart pounding and mind twisting configurations to it's conclusion.  I will be watching this again, but NOT in the dark, and not without the arm of at least one more person with me!",1372723200,8,855,4.756756756756757
8578122,3,B00C7CLHG0,This is one of those movies I'm on the fence about.  The story was interesting but I can't say I enjoyed watching it.  Some scenes were really tragic and disturbing but that is what horror is supposed to be.  I could have done without the hysterical screaming in some of the scenes but overall it was creepy and did leave me feeling unsettled so if you have Prime give it a watch.,1527379200,,380,4.25
8578123,1,B00C7CLHG0,According to this movie autistic male teenagers really enjoy filming people having extremely boring conversations.  Just awful.,1506643200,,127,6.470588235294118
8578124,4,B00C7CLHG0,"I loved everything about this movie, but the sound was muffled and the close captioning really poorly done, so I had a tough time following along. I don't usually leave reviews, but in case the folks who put this together are reading this comment (as they often seem to do), please fix the CCing! Ya'll did an outstanding job with this little gem. I'd watch it again if I knew I'd be able to understand more than half of what was spoken.",1503360000,,437,4.341463414634147
8578125,1,B00C7CLHG0,"Let's talk about what is going on in Darkest Night because it's honestly confusing.

A husband and wife visit a family in the Philippines.  The daughter of this family has a bad mouth and says the B word.  A bird eerily drops from the sky.  The husband introduces himself to the family and says he's into computer work.  Later the family and husband/wife have dinner and an earthquake/power outage occurs.  Nobody's freaked out.  A man and woman reconnect after a year of being apart, make out in a field, hear scary sounds and run back home.  A woman slaps another woman upstairs for... family reasons?  One woman didn't think she was loved enough I guess.  The husband and wife talk about their first date and how the wife didn't know what to think.  After this the mother almost faints in the kitchen.  A brother comes in screaming that his brother is dead.  Not sure how it happened but the one woman is distraught.

A pregnant woman tells her young son to behave and he disappears when she goes to hug him.  She falls to the floor and gives birth while a monster crawls by to help with the delivery.  The grandson appears in front of a grandmother then she dies.  Did she die from natural causes?  It would seem that way because the boy didn't do anything to make her die.  The two women who got into it earlier grab annd strangle each other.  Okay the one girl's screams are really good I admit.  A woman's hand glows on the TV screen.  After this a woman in bed just dies.  No suspense or anything.  Is this the story?  People just die suddenly? Oh geez!

The family hear sounds upstairs.  The picture on TV turns black and white as we see a woman with dark figures behind her.  A man lies on the floor and asks everyone to leave him alone so he can depart in peace.  The woman closes the cabinet door on the floor so he can rest.  The family suddenly sees words on a wall, hears loud roaring and runs downstairs.  Outside a crazy man walks strangely in the fog while the one woman shoots him.  By this point the killings improve and the movie gets better for sure, but the story?  Don't even try to make sense of this mess for real.

The husband and wife talk about a woman who asked the husband if he wants to see a magic trick.  We see a woman in a field sprinkling powder all over everything and reaching for the sky so it can rain dead black birds.  A gust of wind then blows all the blackbirds away.  This woman was satisfied and ecstatic.  It scared the husband to his bones.  We find out a temple that specializes in demon's was built where this house stands.  The wife bought this land because she was talked into it.  The temple burned down and the cult that used to occupy it is gone.  The husband says he slept with that magic woman (named Michelle).  The wife asks if it was a spell or his decision to sleep with her.  He says he doesn't know.  He says 2 months ago everything went bad.  The husband prayed for more business at his coffee shop.  This Michelle woman made sure every other coffee shop owner was dead.  With Michelle around they are screwed.

The wife freaks out when she hears a growl that turns into an earthquake.  We see a huge hunk of moving flesh just appear on the kitchen table and be slapped on.  The husband screams.  Michelle couldn't fight the demons in the house.  Others were sacrificed.  The husband asks about the mutations.  After intercourse the bravest would castrate their groom.  The wife insists there must be a way to end this madness occurring in the house.  To break these spells a marked one must summon a soul of a special sacrifice and a 4-time request to let us go.  They need to a do a seance and summon the virgin.

During the seance the wife stands up and talks to her one relative.  Her husband talks to Michelle and says she can't hurt him anymore.  The husband and wife hug and afterwards the wife finds herself knocked out in the kitchen with furniture knocked around.  The husband and wife realize everyone in the house is gone.  The wife says ""Don't you see?  We're next!"" after the husband questions what's going on.  The wife and husband sit around for a while until the husband finds himself cut up and lying on a bed.  The wife grabs a lamp and walks away.  She returns to talk about the TV being on despite the power being off.  She says she didn't mean to scare her husband.  The wife wants a hug.  She has sex with her husband until her relative screams in another room.  We now see the ritual taking place.  The wife was a member.  Suddenly a boy walks in.  We see all the girls who were part of the ritual.  The message we saw earlier on the wall appears on the floor, as the movie ends.

This is a bad movie.  For the most part the characters sit around mumbling in a dark hard to see room so you can't see them.  They even walk around holding lights so there's no excuse for the darkness.  You can't hear what's going on either, and even if you can hardly anything storyline-related or constructive is being said until the final 20 minutes.  By that point the storyline is just a mess of confusion.  For the most part we see people freaking out for unexplainable reasons or talking to each other like regular folks.  This movie doesn't even try to tell a story.  It's just characters having conversations with each other whenever they want.  Avoid.",1500768000,,5331,4.355102040816327

8578129,5,B00C7CLHG0,"IMDB calls this ""An excellent, provocative... horror film. The acting and writing in Darkest Night is superb"". Sometimes the price of eternal life is eternal death and this is the story of one family's gateway to Hell. A rich family in the Philippines meets at a remote place in the mountains for Christmas. However, they were unaware of the site's past and find out that the supernatural(good TV show!) exists and is not always angelic! One by one, they are dying in mysterious ways. They try to survive fighting against demons and finding out just how ugly the afterlife can be. They find an occult book and start reading it to figure out how to defeat these demons. True horror personified! This film is unrated but I would rate it R. Enjoy!",1427500800,2,744,4.643939393939394
