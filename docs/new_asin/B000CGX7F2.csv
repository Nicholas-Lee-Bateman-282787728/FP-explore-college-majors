2464857,4,B000CGX7F2,Liked the movie.  Fun and relaxing.  My husband seemed to finally relax with the help of this movie.  Thank you.,1377734400,,112,4.5
2464858,3,B000CGX7F2,"This was a good old movie  it was basic and an easy watcher. It takes up back to when we didn't need murder, fight, or something blowing up every 5 seconds. It's basic good over evil",1376611200,2,182,4.055555555555555
2464859,5,B000CGX7F2,This wasn't a bad movie for being in black & white. I don't know about others but I enjoy watching real old westerns as well as the newer ones. I guess ya have ta really be into westerns to enjoy watching the older ones.,1368057600,2,220,4.0227272727272725
2464860,5,B000CGX7F2,"I enjoy watching John in all his westerns whether he plays the good guy or the bad guy. This was a older movie in black & white but I still enjoyed watching it, I will probably watch it over again.",1361664000,,197,3.95
2464861,3,B000CGX7F2,I still like these old westerns. I do not have to worry about the bad words when watching with my grandchildren,1360454400,5,111,4.333333333333333
2464862,5,B000CGX7F2,"Another example of John Ireland's ""great"" presence on screen both physical and performance wise.  He is one of the most underrated actors of his time.  This movie and Hurricanae Smith are his best examples of his physical makeup with Spartacus as his best supporting role of his career.",1359849600,3,286,4.9375
2464863,4,B000CGX7F2,"Standard story - Man returns from Civil War seeking peace and becomes involved in range war.  Result - Good guys win.  Not so much the story itself as the character developement which holds my interest.  I always thought that John Ireland was under-used since his bravura performance in ""Red River"".  I found that his differences with a director caused him to be relegated to mostly ""B"" pictures and perhaps a fine career was nipped short.  The rest of the cast turns in well-thought out performances and makes for a very entertaining presentation.  The DVD cut is not the greatest in the world but is reasonable for the price.  I have no regrets at this purchase and would recommend it to others.  Again, there is no close-captioning and that can detract from the enjoyment of the movie.",1214956800,4,788,4.742647058823529

2464879,3,B000CGX7F2,"This is an old black and white western.  The story line isn't bad, but the acting not up to today standards.",1441756800,,108,4.142857142857143

2464896,4,B000CGX7F2,"This was the sort of movie I watched as a kid on Saturdays.  Yup it was simplistic, the acting sucked and yet it focused on values and the now dead American ethics.  What the hell.  The movie, with newsreel, popcorn, soda and the short :""along came jones"" stories...are pleasant memories.  It was a time when I still believed in heroes and the magic dragon...rather than the greedy, lazy folks who seem to control today - the immediate orgasmic nihilists who would pimp their sisters and mother.",1415145600,,495,4.72093023255814
2464897,2,B000CGX7F2,Did not care for this film,1413676800,,26,3.5
2464898,3,B000CGX7F2,"Fans of the golden age of westerns (50's & early 60's) will enjoy it.  The plot is pretty standard, former civil war veteran having given up guns, travels west to find a peaceful life and walks into a hornets nest.  A arthritic old rancher is trying to run the small ranchers out because he knows the railroad is coming in.  Good henchmen in Lawrence Tierney and some evil closeups of Jack Elam advancing on his victims.  John Ireland was good as the non-violent hero who eventually stands up and fights back.",1413072000,,509,4.56043956043956
2464899,5,B000CGX7F2,Very fast moving pace of story. Good plot to story. Fast moving action. I would recommend to all western buffs.,1403568000,,111,4.6
2464900,3,B000CGX7F2,"This movie is your basic western with some rather weak acting.  John Ireland turned in another one of his standard performances, while Dorothy Malone was a little more polished.  Lon Chaney Jr, although never a talented actor, was pathetic in this film.  It still was a watchable movie and that's all.",1395964800,,301,4.862745098039215
2464901,1,B000CGX7F2,Another movie we could not watch after about 5 minutes.  This was definitely a B or C movie.  A waste of time,1392681600,,109,3.909090909090909
2464902,4,B000CGX7F2,"I remember liking this movie, but I can't remember why.  Maybe it was just because I like westerns.  Maybe it was the actors.  The only thing for sure is that it was a forgettable movie, but entertaining as ""B"" movies go.",1382745600,,221,4.341463414634147
2464903,2,B000CGX7F2,"Thus did the war between the states come to an end for Jefferson Waring.  But, in his beloved south, there was still no peace ... only a continued struggle for power that was, in many ways, worse.  And so, like many of his comrades, Jefferson Waring rode toward the new virgin lands of the west ... and their promise of a rich, full life .. to fight the struggle within himself ... to seek a way of life where he would never again have to bear arms against man.

8099012,3,B000CGX7F2,"I was surprised that Amazon Prime carried old westerners. It was a good classic in black and white. Black and white movies are never dated, because there is no color fades  that will give away the time or era when the movie was made.",1476057600,,233,4.295454545454546

8099015,2,B000CGX7F2,i only watched this film because the main star was named Jeff Waring. since I am a Waring I thought it would be fun to watch it. sorry to say I feel asleep.  for its day guess it was ok.,1468886400,,186,3.65
