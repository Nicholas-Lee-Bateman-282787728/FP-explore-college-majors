493872,5,6302638828,"This is a wonderful movie about how one man acted on a very real problem.  It wasn't just that the Veterns of Vietnam  were not treated well by some, but that those who served, couldn't remember the names of those with whom they served and who eventually gave everything.  Jan was so very upset that he couldn't remember the 'names' of the ones lost.  He could see the faces and remember the men, but couldn't remember the names.  That is what he wanted...for people to remember the names.  The men, by their names, couldn't be forgotten.  That was the original purpose of the wall.  A very good and real purpose it has been.  I want Jan to know his dream was not lost, but most do not remember this part of the reason for the memorial.  Thank you Jan...you were and are right, the names have to be remembered.  Glad this is finally on DVD...sean.",1341273600,4,847,4.4

Thank you",1330300800,,257,4.14
493874,5,6302638828,"This is one of the best movies that I have ever watched. Like others, I opposed not as much the war, as the way our politicians fought the war on paper. I never opposed the men who actually went over seas, and fought and died in this war. Eric Roberts should have won an oscar for this movie. The movie should have won an oscar, but it was about an unpopular war, and no one said much.

If you haven't seen the movie, I want to recount two scenes.

The wall is finally under construction, and workers are adding the names; cutting into the stone. A woman who is working suddenly starts to cry. Other workers come to her thinking she's been hurt by the stone cutting equipment, but that isn't why she is sobbing. She has just found her baby brother's name, and her tears are tribute to the power of the names on the black granite.

During a hearing before construction begins, someone is complaining about the black stone in a black place in the ground, and all sort of negative black comments. A highly decorated African American officer stands up, reminding the others of all the 'black' men who died in the war, and makes it very clear that the speaker better think before he makes any more negative black references.

I really wish this would go to DVD. It's something that belongs in every school and in every library.",1249430400,5,1322,4.42798353909465
493875,5,6302638828,"This was a made for T.V. movie, I had seen when it first came out, 1992, I believe.  I am a Vietnam veteran.  This movie touched my heart, in ways I can not explain.  Its a must see movie for all ages.  When this war ended and young men came home, It was a very different time.  I hope and pray that those who see this movie will come to understand how hard it was for those of us who served.  We all loved our country.  A great deal of young men at that time joined the Armed Forces.  I did! The Air Force was my choice.  I was proud to serve my country.  But the home coming was in some ways worse than death.  I am happy to say, I have had some people in the past few years, thank me for my service.  In three cases I recall it was from young Americans.  Thank god, thank all who served, and all who gave there lives.  See this movie.  I think you will agree.  And watch it again and again.  One last important note, I was one of the lucky ones, I never went overseas, or to Vietnam, I know many who did!  And some who never came home.  This movie is a fine tribute to all who served.  Eric Roberts was awesome as Jan Scruggs.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Heal-a-Nation-VHS/dp/6302638828/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Heal a Nation [VHS</a>]",1249171200,2,1287,4.418803418803419
