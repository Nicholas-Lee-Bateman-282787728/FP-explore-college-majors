4978898,5,B0068MNNLW,It Was A Pretty Good Film Only Because of Robert Englund and William Forsythe. All In All It Was good enough for Me To Buy and Put In My Collection. I Look Forward To Some More Great Movies With Robert Freddy Kreuger Englund In Them.,1337126400,,233,4.2
4978899,4,B0068MNNLW,"The movie opens with a weird ""It's Alive"" scene. A creature that should only inhabit Sigourney Weaver is performing its own c-section. After the credits we see Detective Tom (Joey Fatone) who is in a straight jacket telling us about what happened that night at the police station...even the stuff that happened when he wasn't present. Tom makes love to fellow officer Erin Cole (Michelle Ray Smith) a woman who keeps her bra on while love making, apparently something she learned from watching Natalie Portman films. During the course of a homicide investigation, the Inkubus (Robert Englund) shows up with the victim's head and confesses to gruesome crimes that date back 100's of years.

He tells us the Inklubus story and why he is there. Then things get weird, but not intense or frighting.  If you have enjoyed the cocky supernatural bad guy Robert Englund before, by all means check it out. What is unfortunate is that the supporting cast really didn't have any decent lines or personality. William Forsythe plays a near lifeless man, which was his role, but it made things a bit boring. If you enjoy the supernatural havoc at the police station stuff, check out ""The Traveler"" with Val Kilmer.

4978901,3,B0068MNNLW,"Ever since joining horror icons as the hellacious Freddy Krueger, Robert Englund has never really found any truly memorable roles.  INKUBUS is possibly the closest he's come to finding a similarly insidious character as Krueger.  Too bad the film itself is not as convincing as Englund.  Newcomer writer/director Greg Ciano offers little cinematically and the script is contrived and muddled.  Unfortunately, there is some potential here:  the premise of the Inkubus being responsible for classic unsolved murders, e.g. the Black Dahlia, is intriguing.  However, the film's too talky and its barebone setting is yawn-inducing.  There are some gory, albeit not frightening, scenes.  Joey Fatone from N'Sync is woefully miscast and the usually dependable William Forsythe is bland as the retired detective.  Jonathan Silverman is wasted in a dull turn as another cop.
A more experienced director might have made a better feature, but INKUBUS is just another straight to DVD offering that may appeal to Englund fans as he is the movie's redeeming point.",1332633600,,1050,5.353658536585366

4978903,3,B0068MNNLW,Although im a fan of robert englund and jonathan silverman and william forysthe and even though joey fatone did a decent job it is not worth the asking price when u can rent it on redbox for a buck. i would pay 5 bucks at the most to own. but its worth a look low budgety? yes. but probly kinda had to be considering the cast they were able to put togethet. would like to see jonathan silverman in bigger roles in the future. give robert englund some better scripts and bigger budget movies.,1329955200,2,491,4.23404255319149
4978904,5,B0068MNNLW,"I know what you are thinking. How good can a horror film be with Joey Fatone from N'Sync being in it. Let me tell you it can be one of the most original and fun horror films you can see in years. The film revolves around Robert's character who has just walked into a police station carrying a severed head. This happens in the first 10 minutes. It gets much much better from there. The amazing dynamic is seeing Robert go toe to toe with William Forsythe who portrays a retired police officer chasing after Robert from the old days. Well written and sharply acted (even by Fatone), this is one of those horror gems that comes once in a great while. Robert is hasn't been this sadistic since the first Nightmare on Elm Street. Truly one for the ages check it out.",1329696000,12,762,4.335664335664336

While working at a police station on it's last day the few cops that are left begin to question a young teen on his girlfriend's murder. When a stranger walks in holding her severed head the night takes a wicked turn and they wonder if the stranger is an Inkubus out for revenge. This is a movie that will very much appeal to horror fans, and that may be it. The movie is just one step above a movie made for cable TV and if it weren't for the cast it would have been that. I'm not saying that the cast and acting are great but the fact that Freddy Kruger is in this adds a level of creepy that actually helps the movie. The budget is very very low and the film quality is blurry at times. 95% of the movie takes place in a very plain and boring station but that actually helps the movie I think. Overall, not really impressed at all but worth watching for the cast or if you are a huge horror movie fan. I give it a C+.",1329436800,,1011,4.034825870646766

4978918,5,B0068MNNLW,"Ok. I really  liked  this movie. It could be that I've watched a few this week, found footage, shot in abandoned insane asylums, that were beyond bad, so maybe Inkubus was the refreshing change that sparked some light  in my boring horror~filled week. It might have been some great names and performances by Robert Englund (stellar-ly creepy and provocatively bad), a fine Joey Fatone performance and the adorable Jonathan Silverman among others that  I found to be equally as good. Yes, if you are a die hard horror movie afficienado then you know that 1 out of 10 -20 horror movies, if you're lucky, ever have even a minor creep factor so I'd say this was on the top portion of my 100`s list; not perfect, not super scary, not many scare factors , a little goryier than my usual preference but all in all a solid, well acted movie.

That's why other films of this sort, dealing with the birth of a demonic being, have the birth occur in a private/secluded home.

4978938,2,B0068MNNLW,"Inkubus (Glenn Ciano, 2011)

Glenn Ciano's debut film, Inkubus, is not all that great, though in hindsight it is leagues better than his followup, Infected. But then he's starting from a pretty good place: casting Robert Englund (Nightmare on Elm St.) as a demon who walks into a police station during the night shift and starts confessing to almost seven hundred years' worth of crimes. Why this station? You'll find out eventually, if you stick around long enough. Whether you will want to or not depends entirely how you feel about Robert Englund; this is his movie entirely, and if you feel he's good enough to carry it, then you'll probably like it.

4978967,3,B0068MNNLW,"INKUBUS (2011) - Interesting horror film that is somewhat marred by its shot-on-HD-video look (filmed using Canon 5D Mark II cameras). Most of the film is shown in flashback, as we watch seemingly disturbed ex-Detective Tom Caretti (Joey Fatone; ex-member of the boy band NSYNC and one of this film's many Executive Producers), who is in a strait-jacket in a rubber room, telling his psychiatrist what happened to him and his wife Erin (Michelle Ray Smith), also a cop, on a fateful day in the near past. Tom believes his wife gave birth to a demon baby and he explains why. He was on duty at a soon-to-be-closed police station (shades of ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 - 1976) when a man known simply as Inkubus (Robert Englund, in one of his largest roles in recent memory) walks into the station holding the decapitated head of a recently murdered girl (the police already have a suspect in custody for her murder and didn't believe his story when he told them that someone mysteriously appeared out of thin air and cut off his girlfriend's head with a large retractable blade while they were making love). Inkubus instantly begins playing heads games with the skeleton crew after they arrest and handcuff him, starting with Officer Tech (Jonathan Silverman; WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S - 1989). While Tech begins typing his report (Inkubus insists his name be spelled with an inverted ""k"", which Tech does on his computer with a simple keystroke!), Inkubus effortlessly slips out of the cuffs, disappears, reappears this time with his hands cuffed in front of him and seemingly makes Tech's gun disappear and reappear. Tom and the rest of the small crew check out Inkubus' van, where they find a whole bunch of blood and human body parts. Inkubus demands his one phone call and makes the phone dial by itself; the call being to retired Detective Gil Diamante (a white-haired William Forsythe; THE RIG - 2010), who nearly caught Inkubus thirteen years earlier after he killed Gil's wife and his young son disappeared. He wants Gil to come to the station, but first Gil needs to bring along his personal psychiatrist, Dr. Emily Winstrom (Dyan Kane), who has to accompany Gil everywhere since his wife was slaughtered. Meanwhile, Inkubus tells the stationhouse residents that he was responsible for most of the unsolved (and some that were thought to have been solved) murders throughout history (including the Jack The Ripper murders), but he needs to be reborn every hundred years. Since he is very near that date, I guess you can already determine what is about to happen. None of the cops believe his story, thinking that he is just some crazy serial killer, except Gil, who shows up with Dr. Winstrom. Their minds are about to be blown. Inkubus disappears and begins to slowly force everyone to face their most personal demons, killing some by himself with his large retractable blade and making others believe they are killing Inkubus when they are, in fact, killing each other. At the end of the day, only Tom and Erin are left alive, which leads to the birth of the demon baby. Or was it all in Tom's mind?  The screenplay (by Carl V. Dupre; HELLRAISER: HELLWORLD - 2003), effects and acting are basically above par for such a low-budget effort (Even Joey Fatone, who in flashbacks is bearded and is clean-shaven in the rubber room, is somewhat effective), but since director/co-producer Glenn Ciano (INFECTED - 2013, also starring Forsythe) decided to film it using HD cameras, it gives the movie a washed-out cheap look which detracts from some of the film's more scary moments. Some of the gory effects push the film's R-rating, especially the death of Dr. Winstrom, who is cut in half by Inkubus using his handy blade. When he pulls her two halves apart and her guts and intestines spill out, you'll be wondering if the MPAA was asleep at the wheel when they viewed this. Robert Englund is very effective in his role and seems to throw himself into it. The delivery of his dialogue and his overall acting here doesn't make it seem like he's phoning it in, like some of his roles in other recent horror films (like HEARTSTOPPER - 2006; although he was pretty funny in ZOMBIE STRIPPERS - 2008). Overall, besides the muddy photography, this is a halfway decent horror flick that should satisfy genre fans. Filmed in Rhode Island. Also starring Tom Paolini, Tom DeNucci, Mike Cerrone, Aubie Merrylees, Kevin DeCristofano and Fred Sullivan Jr. A Screen Media Films DVD Release. Rated R.",1373155200,,4478,4.815584415584415

I don't like everything he's done, cause he has some real BAD movies, the Nightmare on Elm St series was fantastic, and he's made some great cameos since then but nothing stellar really....zombie strippers is funny but horrible, This is the best he's done lately, and He's got some new stuff coming as well. He did great, overall the movie was pretty good at keepng your attention. If you're not familiar with him I advise you check out his old stuff before getting this, or borrow it from a friend.",1365811200,,595,4.622641509433962
4978983,4,B0068MNNLW,this movie has a little humorous. if you like funny and scary this is a good movie to watch. I don't want to spoil anyone but it ended sadly,1364083200,,140,3.8620689655172415
4978984,2,B0068MNNLW,Surprisingly effective low budget horror/thriller. Not too original but well done for the most part. But it all goes for nothing because of a ho-hum ending that leaves you wondering just why you bothered to watch the movie at all.,1363305600,,230,4.775

4978987,3,B0068MNNLW,"I met the cast of Inkubus and the directors, writers, etc right before this came out so naturally i purchased without seeing it first. it is a drawn out movie it seems and i got a little bored. I kept it to go with the autograph collection and robert englund merch in my home but if you aren't a movie buff or if you don't have a collection like i do, i don't reccomend getting it. you may be dissapointed.",1354665600,,406,4.0875
4978988,3,B0068MNNLW,"Inkubus is a horror b-movie. Robert Englund stars as a demon and is amazing; his performance is a highlight for this film. It has some cheesy effects, but if you know what you're getting into beforehand, it shouldn't bother you much (it didn't bother me). It wasn't scary, but i did like the demon storyline and the setting (isolated in a police station). Some of the movie is illogical, and the ending was predictable. It also got a little confusing towards the end. Some of the acting was also flawed.

Overall, it's a fun little film and has a very solid performance from Robert Englund. I recommend Inkubus. If you have Netflix streaming, the movie is available as of 7/22/12, if you're not sure about it yet.

Inkubus has strong blood and gore. It has a sex scene, but it doesn't have any notable nudity.",1342915200,,809,4.572413793103448
4978989,1,B0068MNNLW,"I rarely leave a movie at the theaters but this was one of them.  Everything about this movie is terrible. The plot, the special effects, the acting, the low carb Freddie krueger they tried to create, just all around a big giant mess.

8494865,3,B0068MNNLW,"Not bad for a mediocre budget movie...  3 stars.

Robert plays a fun character as usual, but most of the other characters fall a little flat.

For people complaining that they didn't understand the story, did you guys watch the same movie?  It was all pretty well explained throughout the course of the flick...

Some of the ""magic"" special effects were on the cheesy side, although the blood / gore / slashing parts were done pretty well.

They clearly didn't spend a lot of cash on the set, but I guess for an ""old / closing down police station"" it kind of worked.

The camera work and sound weren't anything to write home about, but pretty much on par for a movie with this budget.  No major complaints there.

Overall, I thought this was a mildly entertaining slasher / horror flick.  Thus 3 stars.

Would I watch it again?  Probably not...  but it was fine for a boring night with nothing else to do...",1516924800,,907,4.4573170731707314

8494871,3,B0068MNNLW,"All told, Inkubus was better than expected, but not as good as it could've been. I was especially surprised by producer and star Joey Fatone (yes, that Joey Fatone) in his ability to pretty convincingly portray a man wrongly believed to be insane, even if his general delivery through the majority of the film fell flat. The intensely choppy sex scenes throughout the film did little more than provide time to unwind between one exhibition of unsettling violence and gore and the next. Perhaps the most glaring issue, at least for me, was that the supposed Incubus, a demon both fueled by and eliciting lust, only exhibited this aspect once out of several murders.
 Please don't take this to mean, though, that I consider the film completely unsalvageable. Again, Fatone did play into the ""I know it sounds crazy, but I'm not"" vibe surprisingly well and, despite the apparent necessity of explaining the entire plot, Robert Englund delivered his signature mixture of charm and outlandish creepiness, playing well against a convincingly grizzled William Forsythe. I couldn't really recommend this one in general, but it's not too bad if story isn't too important compared to sheer violence.",1462665600,,1189,5.066326530612245
