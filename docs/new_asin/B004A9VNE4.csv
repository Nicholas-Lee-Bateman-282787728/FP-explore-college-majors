This has a complicate story that makes an interesting movie. Its obvious that scenes were edited to reduce the running time to an hour, but the story remains interesting, even though you know how it will end well. Those long shots suggest a stunt double. Toms activities are certainly strenuous.",1506297600,,2890,4.314917127071824
8419902,4,B004A9VNE4,"Since Amazon does not have the VCI DVD-R edition listed, I will put it here.  This is the Tom Tyler Double Feature, Vol. 2.  ""Roamin' Wild"" (1936) from Reliable Pictures is a decent print with 1 dialogue splice.  The second feature is ""When a Man Rides Alone"" (1934) from Freuler/Monarch.  The title card and end title have been replaced for TV re-issue by Gotham, removing all references to Monarch.  No dialogue splices, but could be missing a minute or two of footage.",1356566400,,471,4.695121951219512
