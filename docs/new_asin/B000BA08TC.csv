8084020,2,B000BA08TC,"Kimba The White Lion is a classic anime series that has been released on DVD by several different companies. The ""Ultra Edition DVD set"" has the original Kimba; the others have later re-workings of the series. This DVD here is one of 4 Kimba DVDs released by Genius Products. It comes in a carboard envelope and contains 2 Kimba episodes: ""Rumble in the Jungle"" (original title: Battle at Dead River) and ""A Flood of Grasshoppers"" (original title: Insect Invasion). These are the 1993 version of Kimba, not the original. The picture quality is really washed out; these DVDs were very poorly made. The only thing they have going for them is that both episodes have both an English soundtrack and and a Spanish soundtrack. Both of these re-worked episodes are also available on the Bazooka Joe Presents Kimba DVD with much better picture quality, but without the Spanish soundtrack.",1132876800,4,880,4.912751677852349
