2200227,5,B0007514CG,"First, allow me to answer the ""Billy Bands"" question so many have in below comments. If you cannot buy ""Billy Bands"" then go to your local sporting goods store and purchase any resistance bands. They are the same thing. Or you can use wrist and ankle weights if you cannot find resistance bands.

Now, I must say that this is a wonderful highly effective work-out. I have taken Cardio Kickboxing (Tae-Bo) for six years, and taught it for the last three years. I am definately in the advanced category. I've done some of Billy's work-outs at home once-in-a-while. Most were interesting, some too easy for me, some a good work-out. The Fat Blasting 2-Pack which includes Total Body Fat Blaster and the Fat Blasting Cardio DVD's are the best that Billy has put out. The bands are fun and I sometimes alternate with free weights to achieve different results. My husband enjoys doing them with me and we both think these are very challenging cardio work-outs. Keep in mind that these realy are pure Cardio with very little, if any, ab work. However, if you have done any Tae-Bo before or have taken a Cardio Kickboxing class in a studio, then your proper form will work your abs enough during the work-out.

I would not recommend this work-out for beginners. I also urge anyone that is interested in Tae-Bo or has only done it at home to take a couple of Cardio Kickbox classes at a local Martial Arts Studio (not a health club). You will be surprised how hard it is to get the form correct without live instruction... and improper form leads to injury or slow results.",1115078400,18,1564,4.602150537634409
2200228,5,B0007514CG,"This is the workout for you.  The first time I did it, I had not ordered the resistance bands.  It did not seem to do much without the bands.  I had been doing the Advanced Tae-Bo before this.  Well, I finally got the bands (it takes about 3-4 weeks to get them), and it is extremely challenging.  I have not been able to get through the whole thing yet.  I am slowly working my way up so I am not so sore that I cannot walk the next day.  If you want to burn fat, tone, and gain muscle I highly reccomend this DVD.  Be prepared to sweat and hurt!",1114560000,5,547,3.909090909090909
2200229,4,B0007514CG,"This is a great workout. I was a little aprehensive being a ""Get Ripped"" Freak. I thought nothing could beat the advance workout of that, but I was wrong. This workout was better because it wasn't as long and there are a lot more intricate moves that targets more critical areas. Of course I enjoy Billy's encouraging words and the moves are more sharp and precise. I didn't sweat as much as I do with the ""Get Ripped Advance"" but my heart was pounding a mile a minute and I felt really ""worked"".

This is a great addition to anyone's workout collection. Once again Billy doesn't disappoint. Try it, you'll love it. I've lost 28 pounds eating a sensible diet and working out to Taebo every morning for 4 months along with going to the gym.

This workout truly brings results!!!!!!!!",1114387200,,782,4.539007092198582
2200230,3,B0007514CG,"A word of warning - if you live outside the US or Canada you will find it extremely difficult to find the resistance bands used on this DVD.  Don't bother trying to buy them from the offical Tae Bo website - they won't ship to you if you live overseas. Although the workout is still good without the bands, it is very frustrating to see how much better it could be and not be able to join in. I think it is poor planning to make the DVD available to anyone in the world but not the products that accompany it.",1113782400,8,509,4.03960396039604
2200231,5,B0007514CG,"Hi, I bought this DVD from your site a wee while ago. It is a GREAT workout, I really recommend it. What I want to know is, how can I buy Billy Bands from outside the US/Canada? I'm in New Zealand, and would really like to be able to add this resistance option to my workout... any comments/suggestions?",1113264000,5,303,4.241379310344827
2200232,5,B0007514CG,"I ordered this dvd and I have been doing the workout without the ""Billy Bands"" for a couple of weeks and I found it amazingly effective for the intermediate level! You WILL definately feel it the next day , but when I went to Billy's site ([...]) and I finally purchased the Billy Bands, I wasn't prepared for the challenge it brought!  To put it bluntly, I am a person that hardly ever curses, but with these bands, the resistance makes the workout so much more intense, that I was cursing up a storm everytime I stopped to sip some water!  The bands make all the difference and unfortuneately are only available on the above website.  So, I highly recommend this if you've done Billy's other workouts. However, if this is your first Billy Blanks DVD, start with the Instructional DVD.  THE REST OF YOU, GET READY TO CHALLENGE YOURSELF, BUY IT NOW!!",1112745600,79,850,4.5359477124183005
2200233,4,B0007514CG,"I have added Tae Bo to my work out and have really worked my way up from, just watching through many parts, to at least walking in place in some parts, to jogging while he did his leg kicks to now being able to get all the way through a 50 minute work out with out my heart coming out of my body.  You will lose weight and inches and feel really great.  This tape is a great addition to his normal insanity and his daughter Shellie is really hurtin' for certain so you know they are getting in a great workout along with you.  As always Billy is the most encouraging coach on any tape I have, and I love his personal style.  This is a must have for intermediate workouts and if you get the bands you will have a great advanced workout in your arsenal when you can't get to the gym or outside for that 5 mile run.  I did only give it 4 stars cause as usual Billy sometimes does not tone evenly on each side, but this is really only a minor issue in a couple of places. If you have worked out with Billy before, you are already aware of this short coming of his tapes.",1112486400,6,1066,3.9859154929577465
2200234,5,B0007514CG,"this is one of the best tae bo workout you can have.  NOw I did not have the resistance band like he did in the workout and I still got a great workout out of it.  the energy was there and you could feel you working your body to the point where the fat are just poping out of you.  The students in the video looked like they were really challenged by the resistance band and basically screaming after each reps.  I can't wait to add resistance band to my workout as I can tell it will help me not only burn fat but also tone up.  it is like having two in one.  Fat burning and tone up at the same time.  it is great Go for it, it won't disappoint.",1112313600,52,647,3.856060606060606
2200235,5,B0007514CG,"I did this workout and boy did I sweat.  It is much better than all of the other tae bo tapes because of the billy bands.  It is better than the ultimate Bootcamp dvd bacause there are no squat thrusts, or push ups; or abs; just all cardio! There are very few ""walk it outs"" Most of the exercises are double time.  Get this one and enjoy a sweat fest.  If you don't have the billy bands, go to Billyblanks website and order them.  You won't be sorry.",1112227200,3,450,4.068181818181818

I found them really entertaining and challenging... But doable. I've done billy workouts before and I think these two are some of his best! You can do them with light weight dumb bells if you don't have the bands and if you want to challenge yourself a little more... And you get two DVDs for under $20!!!

Its a great workout. the movements are not very hard except few. but most of them are easily followed, but do not give up just do what you can. and you will feel so great aftera month. its a great buy and you don't lose anything except weight..But you do not have to have the band. you can do without a band too. it has the same effect.
i bought billy's ultimate boot camp , basic boot camp, ab exercise. and other dvd.i love the way  billy keep you busy all through the workout.. and also i love the way his followers counting and shouting and very enthusiastic and very happy / so it motivate you every minute of it. totally i love billy blank's all dvd s and i recommend this to everyone does not matter how old you are. you can do this dvd without any difficulties.thanks billy",1354924800,3,1122,4.146788990825688

I'm in pretty good shape, but these DVD's humbled and challenged me....Definitely HUMBLED and CHALLENGED me. Billy Blanks moves you from one intense interval to the next with slower-moving breaks. But, keep in mind, you never stop moving and the counting makes the workout a bit more difficult. I highly recommend these DVD's. You feel really accomplished afterward, because you work your butt off! He uses bands in these videos, but I do just fine with light weights.

They are good if you are having a hard time getting motivated one day, or you don't want to leave the house for the gym, or don't want to think much about your workout.

2200273,3,B0007514CG,"I find it amazing that no one else mentioned how difficult it is to hear Billy's instruction over the music. The sound quality is quite poor, and he seems not to be wearing a microphone to pick up his voice.
The workout is intense and provides a good cardio, arm and lower body workout. However, the pace of many of the moves is simply too fast to maintain good form if you are not a professional athlete/dancer type. Plus, since I couldn't understand the instruction, I had to watch first, then rewind, then do. Toward the end, he talks about the importance of counting out loud, but if you were to do that, you couldn't hear anything but yourself.
I bought the Billy Bands from his website. They do help with the workout, but they are definitely awkward to use, with the bands rubbing across your legs or places they,re not supposed to while doing the moves. The adjustment mechanism doesn't work well, as every time I shorten the bands to make the resistance greater, the adjustment balls slide out of place after a few reps and put me back at the default.
I find all the negatives frustrating, since it is hard to find a good cardio/strength workout that's intense enough to do some real good.",1294790400,2,1197,4.52073732718894

However, this morning my SECOND pair of Billy Bland's snapped (this set after only 6 uses). I am finding out on the web that many people have had this problem too. Unfortunately, Billy Blanks no longer sells the ands on his website (according to customer service).  I have to agree with the reviewer that said without the bands this particular workout is somewhat boring.

2200286,5,B0007514CG,"The workout in these videos is similar to the one in the first video of the original workout but instead of being beginner, these ones are intermediate.
Each video has a workout of about 45 min (including warm up and cool down which take 15 min approx.).
The cardio consists in never stopping and doing fast repetitions, while the flex video consists in holding the poses for one set which is more of a workout than I thought at first. I like both videos, but if you want to buy only one I prefer the cardio. Personally I like to be able to switch between routines and don't do the same one every day even though they're very similar.
I bought these because my original videos are VHS and I wanted a DVD and the original workout is way to expensive. If you liked those videos I'm sure you'll like these too.",1287360000,2,807,4.315789473684211

What I found is one workout is good while the other completely misses the mark. Total Body Fat Blaster was a good DVD (not his best) but provided a good solid workout that incorporated the bands well; however Fat Blasting Cardio was probably one of my least favorites of any Tae Bo workout.  The moves did not flow well and at times they seem awkward.  It looked as if Billy was improvising on various moves leaving some of the crew looking uncoordinated and awkward, especially when it came to combination move, which is exactly how I felt at times.  My advice is try Ultimate Bootcamp in his bootcamp series, which is seems this workout was trying to follow that same formula but misses the mark on so many levels. Total Body Fat Blaster = 4.5 stars / Fat Blasting Cardio = 1 star",1263340800,5,958,4.305555555555555
2200293,3,B0007514CG,"I've been doing tae bo on and off for about eight years.  That being said I have a considerable collection of DVDs.  This review is geared toward people who are familiar with kickboxing, in pretty good shape, and looking for a good cardio workout with some resistance work built in. If you are a beginner with kickboxing or looking to get back in shape, I recommend billy's original systems like Tae Bo and Tae Bo II, if you can get a hold of those.  They typically come in a set of two videos, the first one being an introduction video that shows you the proper form so you are not injuring yourself and are maximally using your muscles. This is critical. I don't recommend a newcomer to jump into a more advanced video without having the proper foundation for form, because you're either going to hurt yourself or you're going to be flopping around like a fish out of water with poor form.

As for the ""fat blasting cardio"" DVD, this really is not a good cardio workout.  All around, its kind of a disappointment. The resistance bands are highly annoying and uncomfortable (leave my wrists and my hips bruised and don't offer enough resistance).  I have the ""billy's boot camp"" set of resistance DVDs and those offer an adequate resistance workout that uses your muscles a little differently than freeweights or machines, particularly the ""second mission,"" and those work pretty nicely to rotate with other workouts if you're looking for a different kind of burn. However, beyond that, I don't recommend purchasing any other videos that use the billy bands.

Here is Why: Billy spends an arduous amount of time plugging the bands and insisting how great they are, fully stopping the workouts several times just to blab on and on about them. They also take putzing to get on, which ruins any heart rate elevation you have created (and he takes them on and off several times in the video).  And this is my personal opinion, but I also don't feel the bands do much except get in the way and slow you down in this particular video (which again, nixes the so called ""cardio"" workout).

With the ""fat blasting cardio"" workout I will uses the bands for a few things but usually opt to go without or add light freeweights, which I think actually gives more of a burn (and involves less bruising and putzing).

Another annoyance with this video is that billy NEVER stops talking, which, beyond being irritating, means he loses count of sets, does uneven reps on alternate sides, and spends too much time doing the demonstration slow pattern repeats, and again, plugging the bands.

 So, to get a good cardio workout from this video I typically turn off the volume and follow the basic patterns at faster speeds, and when he stops to talk or stand there and lackadaisically step from side to side, I will put in more kickboxing work or things like side skip jumps or power jump lunges just to keep my heart rate up and to ensure I'm actually keeping my heart rate pumping and getting a good workout. When I do the workout this way, lose the bands, and add in light freeweights, I do get a good workout. As Billy says, you get what you put in...

If you are a beginner you will find this challenging but as far as Tae Bo goes there are better videos available, and I think the ones without product gimmicks like the billy bands are going to offer you a a more fun and more effective kickboxing experience.  Billy Blanks really does believe in what he does but I think after the initial success of the first couple sets of workout videos there was a lot of pressure to keep pumping out ""new"" renovations to his kickboxing workout to keep consumers interested and investing in more Tae Bo products, but I think the reason people liked it in the first place was because it used to be good wholesome, no-frills, no accessories needed, relatively fun cardio workout that gave a nice burn and delivered results with consistency.  That being said, go for the vintage videos and if you're a beginner make sure your starting with an introductory video that shows you the proper form, for your own safety.",1262390400,,4086,4.593406593406593

I wanted to add these to my collection as they use the Billy Bands - I was extremely annoyed and disappointed to discover that the DVD's sent to me are only viewable in Region 1 (UK is region 2) - No mention was made of this in the description, so I had (wrongly) assumed they would be viewable as are my others. I am currently trying to see if I am able to unlock my DVD player (no success yet) otherwise I will have to wait until I replace my player for a universal one and just imagine how great these workouts are until then.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Billy-Blanks-Tae-Bo-Fat-Blasting-Cardio-Total-Body-Fat-Blaster/dp/B0007514CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Billy Blanks' Tae Bo: Fat Blasting Cardio & Total Body Fat Blaster</a>",1256601600,,866,5.282608695652174

2200309,4,B0007514CG,I enjoy this video more than most i've tried! I sweat up a storm and am usually slightly sore the next day!

2200310,5,B0007514CG,"I`m using the Tae Bo workouts for over three years here in Germany. I have different Tae Bo workouts including the Amped-workout and the new T3-workout.
I can tell you that you don't need the new ones, because this workout is the most intensive one of all workouts I have seen. I am doing the ""Fat Blasting Cardio"" and the ""Total Body Fat Blaster"" for over two weeks now and my muscles became incredibly strong and Im feeling better than at any time before.
You won't find a lot of new Tae Bo moves in the new workouts. What you get here is a very taff solid workout that will challenge you. I bought the bands and use an extra weight on each hand to get the maximum results. It is really challenging...
You`re working on all body parts, this is very special. Normally the taebo workouts are linked to just one special body part. Here you are toning muscles and legs your back and so on.
As many other people said before, you don`t need the bands, but you should use at least handweights to get your muscles change.
All in all I can say that this workout is a combination of the Bootcamp workouts with some elements of the Amped workout.
You should try it!",1245110400,2,1156,4.331797235023042
2200311,4,B0007514CG,"So many people have said so much already, I'll just add this: I don't have the bands and am not interested in buying them, so I use a combination of 1-lb. (for fast parts) and 3-lb. (for slower parts) hand weights--which I already had--and I definitely feel it! I don't have ankle weights yet, but I assume they would provide similar resistance on the legs. Obviously you can't punch fast with a big dumbbell in your hands, but depending on your arm strength you could try different small weights. It is almost certainly not as intense as the bands, but that may be OK for you too if you're just not as strong, or are just starting out. You could even start with no weights or bands if you need to and work up to it--Billy says as much in the video. Using hand weights, I find this to be a well-paced, moderate workout that's more about strength, but has some nice cardio too.

Update: I ultimately did get ankle weights, and they worked just fine!",1239235200,3,948,4.386363636363637
2200312,5,B0007514CG,"Both of these DVDS are excellent.  They are so difficult, but that's why I like it because it's a challenge.  I've done each one several times now, but each time I do it, I still think I'm going to die.  Billy's pep and good attitude keeps me going though.  He is an awesome and motivating instructor.  The bands may feel a little awkward at first, but you will get used to them.  The blue video is more cardio based and you can feel the results even without the bands, but for the other video, you want the bands.  If you don't have the bands, grab some hand weights.  It will make all the difference.  This one is still a lot of cardio, but also some strength training.  This video is also ten minutes longer (55 minutes as compared to 45).  My suggestion is not to start with this video if you are new to Taebo.  Get the elite boot camp set.  The ""get started"" video is awesome to teach you form and the basic moves, but it's not so easy that it doesn't give you a great workout.  This particular package is TOUGH.  You will feel the burn, and if you don' have a hard time keeping up, you're in amazing shape.  Even Shelley struggles in the longer video and look at her!  By the way, if you need the bands, you can get them at[..].  I actually got mine from the set of ""bootcamp elite.""  It came with the videos.  This set of DVDs does not come with them.",1236556800,2,1358,4.15
2200313,5,B0007514CG,"I really love this video!  I am a nursing mother of a 7-month old so I can't really diet to lose my baby weight.  I was pretty fit before pregnancy, but now have a lovely fat layer to get rid of!

I am a long time Tae Bo user, and actually was working out post-baby with my 10-year old Tae Bo video before I picked this one up for an added challenge.

This video, with the resistance bands, has allowed me to do a challenging workout, in about an hour, that really gives results.  The resistance bands are key.  I bought this video in a store, so I read on the back of the DVD that it requires resistance bands, so I bought some cheap ones at the same store for about $5 instead of buying Billy Bands.

I find that even though a lot of the video is upper body workouts, you are constantly in a plie-2nd position-squat, so Billy forces you to use your entire lower body and core for most of the video.  It is very intense, your heart rate stays up, and it's challenging!

So in summary, while I can't diet to lose my baby weight right now, thanks to this video, I am losing weight, I look better, my clothes fit better, and my body is becoming sculpted and toned!  I am even running again with the jogging stroller and have more endurance! Thank you Billy!!!!  I recommend this to anyone who needs to tone, sculpt, lose weight, and get in shape!",1235606400,3,1344,4.190661478599222

2200315,3,B0007514CG,"somewhere, sometime, i misplaced my tae bo advanced dvds which are now WAY too expensive for me (but if you can afford them they're awesome). so i tried this. and honestly, i was underwhelmed. it's a great workout, just not that fun. the energy seems to just not be there as it was in earlier videos. it'll still get you looking good though :)",1232582400,2,343,4.375
2200316,4,B0007514CG,"I know that many have said that the Tae Bo workouts are mostly the same and having only the Basic DVD that has instructional, Basic & Advanced dvd's I would not know if this is much different or not.  Many of the moves I knew from the set I had, but the moves were done in different combos and I felt this dvd was somewhere between the basic & advanced versions that I do now.  I had my pedometer on while I did the dvd and logged in 3700+ steps in the 46 minutes that the dvd ran and I did work up a sweat, even without the strength bands.  I am quite sure adding extra resistance would tone you up even quicker and would be a nice challenge, but even as a daily exerciser, if you use your own body's resistance and are mindful of working the muscle you will get a good workout.  Hel-lo triceps....I can still feel them from doing the workout this morning.

A few cautions: if you are a beginner you need to pace yourself.  It is too easy to start at a level that you are not up to yet and it is easy to start off with sloppy form because you are trying to go fast or harming yourself without having your body in proper alignment. It is much better to go more slowly and make sure that you are doing the exercise correctly. The speed will come, but good form should always be a constant.  I would also caution that you will need to be careful if you are working on carpet to make sure you do not twist your knees.

I tried this as a borrowed dvd and am considering purchase.  I felt the dvd gave me a good workout and was fun.  If I do purchase this I would also seek out the resistance bands used in the workout as well as I would like the option of taking it up another notch, but again, without the weights it is a completely satisfying cardio workout in and of itself.",1231977600,,1773,4.054441260744985
2200317,5,B0007514CG,"Several years ago, I lost about 30 lbs with the original Tae Bo video series. Now, at 32 (and with a slowed-down metabolism), I have about 7-10 lbs to lose again--and as soon as I saw this DVD, I knew that this was the way to go. I love Tae Bo because it's never boring--I've tried countless at-home fitness video/DVD workouts, and Tae Bo remains the only one I've ever stuck with. It's very high-energy, and he changes up the moves often enough to keep you challenged and entertained.

I consider myself to in moderate shape. For years, I've been fitness walking 3-5 times a week for 30-40 minutes. However, this DVD kicked my butt. I only made it through the first 15 minutes on my first try. As before, I know that I'll slowly have to work up to the speed and length of the workout on the DVD.

Right now, since I'm just starting, I'm doing the workout without the resistance bands. You do NOT need the bands to do this workout, especially if you're a beginner. In fact, several of the people featured in his workout are not using the bands, either, so that you can see how it's done. Once you can get through the entire workout without the bands, then you may want to challenge yourself by ""relearning"" the workout with the bands. And again, that's why I LOVE Billy Blanks and Tae Bo--it continues to challenge you and give you something to work towards.

I've just started with this DVD, but I have no doubt that it will be as successful for me this time as it was in the past. I call this Billy Blanks--Back and Better than Ever.",1230854400,,1535,4.36013986013986
2200318,4,B0007514CG,"I bought this video at an outlet store for $4.99 and it is worth well more than the small price I paid for it.  I have seen Billy Blanks on T.V. for years, and wondered if his videos were all they made them out to be.  IT IS NO LIE!  I work out fairly regularly and am in good shape, but when I started his video, I felt like my body was being worked harder than ever before.  The workouts are simple, but intense.  The first few times I watched it, I had to stop half way through just to breathe and drink some water.  But it didn't take me long to get used to it and go all the way through.

Some pros:
1.  It is simple and effective.  It keeps your heart pumping through most of the video, but is not so intense that any regular person can't do it.

2.  The people are down-to-earth and encouraging.  They make a few mistakes, but who doesn't?  They laugh and tell jokes and encourage you and each other through the whole video.

3.  It is short.  It is only 45 minutes long, and it has a quick break between all of the exercises.  But, most of the video, you will be working hard.

Some cons:
1.  It can be hard on the knees.  I have never had knee problems, but noticed that some of the side to side movements caused my knees to feel like they were stretching in the opposite direction.  There was some soreness the next day, but by making a few adjustments, it is easier now.  I just had to turn my knees outward instead of straight on those exercises.

2.  There are a few times when the exercises are not even on both sides of the body.  But even then, you only do about one set more and can easily adjust by adding or subtracting sets once you get to know the routine.

Overall, I found this video to be compelling, interactive, enthusiastic, and just plain fun.  It makes me want to exercise even when I don't feel like it, and I'm glad that I bought it.",1230768000,2,1864,4.091412742382271
2200319,5,B0007514CG,"I walk a lot daily and post baby find that my metabolism is a litle slower. Do dieting and walking aren't cutting it. So instead of a costly gym membership (and the likelihood I wouldn't want to travel there daily) my husband got me this dvd. I was terrible, laughed at him and said 'Awesome, the hyper informercial guy! YAY!' but I changed my tune once I did the dvd. Most exercise tapes are annoying with god awful music and shrill instructors. Billy focuses on warming up properly here and encourages you to stick with the cool down too. Beginners feel it not necessary but it is to avoid injury. Very key- also a few moves I felt like a clutch they aren't complex but for someone like me unused to such instruction it took a few extras days to feel like I had the hang of it.
Just push pause and take your time if you need to.
One thing mentioned here is the constant counting. You tune it out after the first few times and it's not a big issue. He's motivationg, very down to earth not cutesy/hyper/cloying like most video instructors. I was so impressed I just ordered the Bootcamp to advance. I think the key is to get a few of his videos and rotate them to work all the muscles.

He's very positive, seems really genuine and he melted my cynical,sarcastic little heart haha. I look forward to doing it and that is HUGE in sticking with a dvd. You feel motivated like you're in an actual class not at home.
Strongly suggest this. After a week my husband noticed I look way more toned (with good dieting this really works) and I am a Billy convert!",1227398400,2,1554,4.321917808219178

2200321,5,B0007514CG,"As most other reviewers have said, this two DVD set really does provide a great workout!  I bought some of the Elite (weighted) Billy Bands and when used with both DVDs they make for a really awesome cardiovascular exercise!  I've been doing Tae-Bo for around ten years and I suppose I would describe myself as Intermediate/Advanced; consequently some of Billy's workouts are a little too short or not enough of a challenge but these two are definitely hard work!

I am amazed at the difference the Bands make; I've got muscles and (good) bulges where I never used to so I would recommend getting hold of some bands if you can!

At 46 minutes the Fat Blasting Cardio is a great length and quite easy to fit in on a daily basis.  The Total Body Fat Blaster runs for 55 minutes and I suppose some people might find this hard to fit in to a busy day; however I think it is certainly worth making time for it!",1218499200,3,905,4.363095238095238

2200323,5,B0007514CG,"Let me start this review with this: I started this workout at 412 lbs, and I'd never worked out before. Never. I would get winded walking up a flight of stairs. So when I popped in the Billy Blanks' Fat Blasting Cardio DVD, I didn't think I had a chance in the world of making it through the entire workout--let alone half of it. The first few days, I was only able to make it through 15 minutes (including the 3 or 4 minutes of stretches), huffing and puffing like mad. After a few days I was able to force myself into doing half an hour. Wthin 2 weeks, I was able to make it through the entire 45 minute workout.

How did I do it? The key for me was pacing myself. I didn't punch too hard or kick too hard, and if there was a workout that I thought would do damage my body (such as the jumping jacks--bad for my knees), I substituted that section for a different move, such as jogging in place. Once I got more stamina and could keep my wind, I would punch harder, kick harder, and exert as much energy as I felt I could sustain. It's good for beginners, but also good down the line when you have the stamina to put more energy into it.

This video is great for beginners who need little breaks to catch their breath. Billy does a few sets of the technique slowly to make sure you have it down, then a set or two quickly, then you walk it out and move on to the next move. You won't be going strong non-stop for a full 45 minutes.

The moves are simple enough for anyone to do. You do punches and kicks and knee raises, with just a few jumping jacks thrown in. Jabs, hooks, uppercuts, speedbag, front kicks/back kicks, side kicks, all in different variations. It's cardio designed to keep your heart rate up, but it won't wear you out. I have yet to purchase the bands, but the workout is great even without the bands! On the video, there's even one guy in the back who doesn't use the bands, so they aren't absolutely necessary.

You'll only need about a 3' x 5' area in front of your television to do this workout. I just push my desk chair to the side and have plenty of room if I adjust my body a certain way for left kicks and right kicks. Just be careful not to punch or kick anything!

As someone who began Fat Blasting Cardio at over 400lbs, I definitely recommend this for beginners looking for a do-able workout routine. Billy will keep you motivated and excited to keep going. Definitely worth the money!",1217721600,17,2417,4.200431034482759

2200325,4,B0007514CG,"When I first did this DVD I did it without the bands and it was a decent cardio workout. I do have 1LB hand weights that fit in your palm and I used them with this DVD also... However, I went and got some medium level work out bands (a bit harder than they ones they use in the video) and man does it change the level of the work out. The kicking is pretty much the same... but if you have a good workout band while you're doing all the punching - it is hard to keep your hands up the whole time. I have a feeling some of the people that didn't like this DVD and thought it was easy were either not using the bands or using ones that were too easy..

 It is a bit disorganized and I try to focus more on Shelly on one of the other people while Billy is talking b/c he is a bit distracting. Plus once I got used to the sequence of the exercises I knew when he was going to have us quit early or do an extra set so it didn't bother me as much.

 But overall this is a good workout, by the end I am (no lie) dripping sweat onto the floor. The kicking can be a bit much for people that are not that flexible - so you may want to be cautious of that.",1217462400,,1145,3.7385892116182573

1) The exercise is hard on my knees, and i never had knee problems before.

2) There are parts where they are going super fast and it's hard to do the exercise properly. Billy even says to make sure you do it properly if you want results, but by watching the people on the DVD, you can tell that they're going so fast that even they can't do it properly.

3) The counting is way off and you do work out one side more than the other, this is not what I spent money for.  I could work out on my own if I didn't care about the counting and such, they're supposedly professionals and should pay careful attention to details like those.

4) The chit chat, or 'encouragement' of the background people is obnoxiuos, specially the blond.

5) No where on the DVD does it mention anything about the bands, that was also very upsetting. i tried using ankle weights and light weights, but it is not the same, I'm afraid of kicking too hard and have the ankle weight fly into my tv screen.

The bands were throwing me off the whole time - they just didn't feel quite right - awkward.  It will take some getting used to.  I feel I wasn't able to get a real good cardio because of it. I was sweating, though. Next time, I will use small hand weights instead of the bands to get strength into the cardio.  When I've got the form down, I'll incorporate the bands.

Unfortunately I can't use the two DVD's, why the code 1 is not compatible with Europe. The others DVD's that I bought are working well. The code should be for ""all"" or number ""2"". What can' I do? It is possible to sent the two DVD's back?

The thing I hate the most about Billy Blank is the fact that he LOVES to talk.  He will talk as the repetition of the exercise gets ridiculously long.  This will often times lead to doing more reps on one side than the other.  It is really frustrating and off putting.  I also don't like the fact that he doesn't have a good stretching section after such a strenuous workout.  I'm usually extremely sore the next day.,1172793600,3,596,4.315315315315315

To get an awesome work out YOU NEED TO BUY THE BANDS!!!  I did both workouts once with out the bands.  The fat blasting cardio was okay without the bands but the total body one,you need the bands.  After I did both I went on line and ordered the Billy Bands. I did the Fat Blasting Cardio when I go them and it was the difference between night and day. I was dripping with sweat and breathing really hard.  The total body one with the bands? Woah! Now, I'm in excellent shape. I work out every day. I run 5-6x a week, lift weights 4x a week and even in my shape, I had to stop and stretch out every now and then during the work out.

NOT this one. It took everything I had in me to get through this video the first time. I thought I was going to pass out on the living room floor. After three weeks of doing it three to four times a week, it is getting a little easier. If you really want a tough work out that melts the fat away, this is the one. I have lost three pounds in two weeks after not being able to lose any weight for over a month.

I really like how the people in the video are all in amazing shape and they all seem to be enjoying the work out. (They are all sweating profusely as well!) I love that they all count out loud together and whoop and yell when it gets tough. It helps me keep going. The moves are very rhythmic and fun and I find myself wanting to do kicks and punches while I am doing mundane things like house work. Billy Blanks sometimes urges you along in a way that almost sounds like he is rapping to the music, which makes it interesting and upbeat. (Move your butt, c'mon, move your butt!) Haha.

What I don't care for is the following:  It gets really old listening to the people on the dvd hootin and hollerin, clapping and yelling out cardio every ten seconds!  I also noticed that Billy is not consistant when it comes to doing certain exercises equally on each side.  There is one point in the DVD that the excerise count should be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and he has you stop on 6 but on the other side we went to 8.  And another point where we did more kicking on one side then on the other.  The fast pace of this workout is also not good for someone who has weak knees or recovering from an injury.  I found it difficult to use proper form when they get into the cardio mode of the dvd (mostly the kicking).  I will continue to use this on and off because it is a good cardio workout.

2200357,4,B0007514CG,"The workout is great for cardio. I don't have the resistance bands (wasn't aware they were used in the workout until I did the workout for the 1st time) but it's still great if you don't have them. It is advanced--it's 45+ minutes of solid, hard-core cardio, which is great for when you're really looking to sweat and get fit.

I'm giving this 4 stars out of 5 because some of the moves feel way too fast--combined with the bouncing and kicking, there's a lot of jumpy-style movements. In my experience, these type of movements are a lot more prone to injury than a ""softer,"" more seamless workout such as a dance workout where you concentrate on flow from one movement to the next. So if you've got weak knees or joints, I'd say stay clear.

I'm a Billy Blanks novice, and his style, and the style of his workout buddies behind him is... different. He has everyone count every single rep of every single move that's made (the theory is that you should not be so winded as to not be able to speak). So you as the viewer are constantly listening to: 1, 2, 3, 4... and then at the end of each set, lots of folks yell, really loudly, in what can either be described as a victorious ""yay, I'm done!"" to ""I'm just yelling 'cuz it's expected""--which is super duper annoying to me.

Billy is alternately awesome and annoying--he talks SO much during the whole workout that it's tough to discern what's instructions for the next set and what is just extraneous ""come on, you can do it!"" But he did melt my heart a couple of times because he is just so THERE for you, and you feel like he really cares.

All in all, I'm satisfied with my purchase. I was looking for a hard-core cardio workout for days when I really need to work it, and this workout delivers. Everything else--the yelling, counting people--is a minor distraction.",1169337600,7,1821,4.4431137724550895

I consider myself a relatively athletic person, but I hurt my right knee during a class at the gym a year ago.  I healed enough to want to increase my cardio workouts from walking and low impact aerobics and so I purchased this tape.  Big mistake.

What I found was that all of the twisting, kicking, and herky jerky moves are not demonstrated in a way that insures safety and subsequently this served only to aggravate my knee all over again.  I also agree with one of the reviewers above who felt the warm up/cool down was too short and she's a trainer, so she should know.

Billy really motivates, especially when you fell like giving up.  I can tell you from my experience this is both for those who want to burn fat and for those who love to work out.  Make these DVDs a part of your collection.  At certain points the counting is off, but the trick is to keep count in your head and you'll be fine.  I am seeing the results!!  Do not think that without the bands this dvd is useless.  I got results from the very first week (without the bands), I must say though, the results got even better with the bands, these workouts depend on you and how much effort you put into it.

The tempo is sufficient to get your heart rate up and keep it there.  The routine is easy for anyone familiar with Tae Bo form.  The reps are balanced for each side of the body.

Using the tape consistently has made all the difference for me.  My arms, abs, legs and gluteus muscles are firm and strong in just 2 months time!

All of the moves are shown rather quickly before a set of them is performed, but the moves are easy to catch on to.  As a beginner (or someone getting back into an exercise program), it is difficult to find something that is going to be do-able at a beginning level that you won't have to discard later because it is too easy.  This set is great for beginners with initiative as well as advanced students. Though the program goes at a very fast pace, it is very easy to follow along and execute the same moves at a slower pace.

My suggestion is if you are a beginner, take the moves at half pace the first couple times until you feel comfortable with them.  It is really a great work out, but it is important to pace yourself to be sure you do not injure your body.

This program is not for you if you want something to slowly ease into.  It is for you if you are prepared to just jump right in and get in shape.  There is a lot of jumping in this program and there are optional (sold seperately) resistance bands for the more advanced student.  The programs work very well with or without the bands, though.

I am very excited to continue to use this program to get in shape.  I would recommend it to all levels, but it really is a high paced work out so be careful not to over do it!  He is very motivational and really interacts with you throughout the workout (as much as a recording can, mind you).  I just loved the workout and felt great at the end.

As a side note: if you are the type of person that needs to have every move explicitly described to you, this program does not do a step by step really.  Billy shows the moves briefly at a slower pace and then jumps right into them.  I personally didn't have a problem with the way the moves were presented.",1159228800,15,1877,4.169444444444444

The only downsides (and these apply to ALL the Tae bo videos I've done)are 1) quite lame pseudo tai'chi ""cool downs"" that don't really offer any stretching, and 2)Billy Blank's inane pseudo-spiritual babbling at the end which is supposed to be inspirational, I guess, but is totally incomprehensible and annoying. But it doesn't really matter because you can just turn it off at the cool down and do your own stretches and spare yourself the pablum. I'd definitely recommend this set (as well as the earlier ""Get Ripped"" Advanced workout).",1155427200,5,898,4.837662337662338

2200380,2,B0007514CG,"I have to say, I've been a fan of the Tae Bo routine for years, but I think the latest edition of the ""Billy Bands"" has been the biggest downside of the new workouts.  I find myself just feeling awkward and discomforted when doing the moves, especially when doing the kicks.  They just sort of jiggle around like bungi coards rather than providing any intense resistence.

I agree with those who say this workout isn't nearly as heart-pumping as it claims to be (you actually just end up being persuaded into thinking you've done an intense workout, when you're really doing a lot of walking in place and very slow moves that feel like a waste of time).

Yes, it will make you sweat, and it will get your heart-rate up evetually, but Tae Bo veterans will be extremely bored and unsatisfied with it.  For some serious calorie crunching, I'd reccommend the Tae Bo Get Ripped series.",1149379200,,880,4.579617834394904

It is very important to know the techniques .. a wrong technique could cause injury . Also don't always look at the students for direction/guidence I noticed that several students  billy were preforming the wrong techniques throughout the video... not good.

I didn't even use the resistance bands and the workout still kicked my butt! Try it--you won't be disapointed. The Total Body Fat Blaster requires the use of the resistance bands--you will not get much of a workout without them.

2200383,5,B0007514CG,"It's rare to find a DVD that provides a good solid 45 minutes of cardio exercise.  Typically they are stop-again-start-again kind of things, not able to raise the heart rate.

I have been doing the Fat Blasting Cardio DVD for a couple of months now and still cannot complete all the reps while wearing the Billy Bands.  My heart rate stays in a good zone for the entire workout.  I feel that during the winter, when I cannot run because my asthma is aggravated by the cold, this DVD is my best cardio option.  I have not tried the Total Body Fat Blaster.

One problem with Tae Bo is that if you've never had experience with either Tae Bo, kickboxing, or some form of Martial Art, you will have trouble mimicking the form you see on the DVD.  This is a good way to get an injury early in the process of learning, which can be frustrating.  I recommend a small amount of instruction on proper form while kicking, and don't be afraid to start out doing slower reps than you see on the DVD.  I would say that it's pretty easy to blow the knee of your standing foot if you try to do more than your body is capable of.  Also, unless you have a good deal of upper body strength, it is wise to do the workout without the Billy Bands until you feel confident.  Believe me, it's still plenty cardio.",1141689600,64,1289,4.241803278688525

2200386,3,B0007514CG,"I've been doing taebo for many years and was excited when he came out with the Billy Bands.  I have the bootcamp workouts and really enjoy them.  My sister told me of two new workouts that go along with the Billy Bands so I decided to try them out.  This was the first one I tried and felt that it was good, but definitely not Billy's best video.  The bands definitely add power to some of the moves causing you to sweat a lot more, but there are a few things where I feel that the bands are pointless.  The first move I'm thinking of is a jab, cross, jab and then a round house kick.  The bands are great for the arm part, but when you go to the round there is no resistance on the band so the band flies around.  The other move is a jab, cross, jab and pause and then a contact jab.  This combo is fine when doing it slow because there is an actual pause, but when he ups the tempo it's just a very awkward combo.  I noticed that even a few of the people in the background messed up.  In the beginning his counting is uneven and during one of the combos, I felt that Shellie and the others were counting at super speed.  Having said all of this, I did like the challenge of the bands and felt that it was a good workout.  It was a lot of the same things that were in the other videos and if the bands weren't involved it would just be another Taebo video.  I will keep the video and use it periodically, but it is by far not my favorite Taebo.",1140220800,6,1445,3.958477508650519
2200387,2,B0007514CG,"I was very dispointed with this workout.  I was simply looking for a good, fat blasting, cardio work out, and this was not it.  Billy stops in the middle of each move to talk to his team, and instruct them on doing the moves properly.  However, on several of the moves, he goes into little detail, leaving you wondering if you're doing them properly.  If you haven't done Tae Bo before, it will take some time to master the moves.  Billy stops and speaks so often, that it was hard for me to get my heart rate up from stopping so much.  So much time is wasted, that it gets boring - you'll find yourself pacing back and forth, waiting for the routine to start up again.  I'd say 25 percent or more of the program is wasted.

I also was unaware that you need ""Billy Bands"" in order to participate in this work out, which didn't come with the DVD, and aren't available in stores.  The bands are rubber resistance bands that wrap around your feet that you hold in your hands while doing the moves.  These would be more appropriate for resistance and strength training - not cardio.  They in no way, help to get your heart rate moving faster.

What a waste of money.",1139011200,7,1162,4.304147465437788
2200388,4,B0007514CG,"I just bought this from another retail store similar to Walmart on sale for $12.99.  You do not need the bands mentioned here -  you could easily use 3 - 5 pound ankle or arm weights so I'm not sure what the fuss is over the bands.  Most people who exercise somewhat regularly have those anyway.

I enjoyed this workout immensely. Some parts were a bit too fast to focus on correct moves...however every single person (even the guy not using the bands) was sweating in this tape and you really feel like your heart rate is up there.

I enjoyed how Billy addresses you once in a while right in the camera stating to punch higher or to keep going - I found him very motivating.

Unlike some of his other high intensity tapes, I enjoyed this much more. I feel like the very high intensity tapes can strain the back if your moves aren't right on the money.

I found no section on the DVD that outlines moves and he goes right into moves without explanation - so know your moves first, get your own bands from Walmart, Target, etc., and grab a big bottle of water and towel you're going to need it.  Just keep in mind that you can start without the weights and add the weights later making this a versatile DVD and workout.",1137024000,23,1218,4.288209606986899

2200390,4,B0007514CG,"This is a mind blowing workout if you have the infamous 'Billy Bands', but if you are living overseas, you might find getting the Billy Bands difficult.

There are a few options at your disposal

1.  Do the workout without the bands.

There is one exerciser showing a band-less modification.  Of course, you do not get the 'fat blasting' aspect of the workout, so this is not ideal.

2.  Buy some regular resistance bands and use those instead.

I have been doing this a bit hap-hazardly, and have been getting some benefit, but since regular resistance bands generally aren't designed to loop around your foot, you might get a painful THWACK every now and then.

3.  Order Billy Blank's Boot Camp from Amazon.

The Boot Camp package contains the Billy Bands.  This is the only way that I have found been able to get the bands for a customer living outside the US and Canada.  If you want the Billy Bands but don't want Boot Camp, there's not much that I can recommend that you do other than buy it and give it to someone as a gift and run away giggling before they notice that it needs the bands.

Other than that, this workout is incredible, and it is a shame that Billy Blanks has not been transparent with the equipment needed to gain all of the benefits of this workout - and that is the only reason why I have given this product 4 stars out of 5.",1135641600,,1352,4.356

There is no information on where to get the exact bands that Billy is using (they look thinner and longer than some I've seen.)  Fat Blasting Cardio can be done and be useful without the bands, although having them would probably increase the workout.  Total Body Fat Flaster on the other hand is basically worthless if you don't have the bands.  It's not even really a kickboxing or Tae Bo tape.  I used weights and copied their moves.  I'm not sure I will buy the bands, because the people on the screen with Billy appear to be having issues with the bands so it just looks like it would be very awkward.

Part of me is sorry that I bought this set, because it is not actually what I was expecting from what is advertised on the box and in the marketing materials.  But I'm trying to give them a chance for what they are, which I guess is good but not great.

Personally, I think the ""Total Body Fatblaster"" is more cardio intensive and gives a better workout.  However, it is 55 minutes while this workout is only 45 minutes, which is nice.  If you are a beginner or have never done any of Billy's workouts then you will find this workout difficult.  He does alot of kicks and punches with and without the bands.  You need to know what you are doing so you don't injure yourself.  As always, his warm-ups and cool downs are a bit short.  Overall, I gave it 3 stars because compared to his other workouts, I don't think it is as cardio intensive.  If you have been doing Tae Bo and Billy's workouts for a long time, then you may find that you can get a better workout with some of his other tapes.

The DVD is 55 minutes long, so without the bands your just kind of standing there.

I would rather not have to buy props to go with these videos, as with Billy's other videos, you don't need anything but yourself.  As the other reviews stated, I could definitely see how the workout would become much more challenging when adding the bands...I guess I felt duped!

But after I had my daughter this past March, I knew I needed something to melt the pregnancy pounds away & quickly!  I gained almost 40 pounds on my 5'3"" frame- I started with the ""Get Ripped"" advanced about 7 weeks postpartum; unbelievable how quickly the pounds & inches just flew off.  I was still doing Cathe for weights but wanted to switch up the cardio, so I purchashed this set.  One of the best things I've done so far!

  This is cardio & toning in one- but more effective than I could ever anticipate.  I'm currently down to my prepregnancy size (4/6) and want to go even further.  My arms, shoulders, back and waist are even more defined than before pregnancy! And my legs are getting there but these are my trouble spots so I know I have to continue on to really change the shape of my thighs!

  I'm only giving it 4 stars because of the infamous Bily Blanks off counts but I'm used to it now, so it doesn't really bother me as much as some of the other posters.  Get this set plus the bands (sorry but you need them to tone up), you won't regret it!",1123113600,9,1304,4.316872427983539

The title of ""Fat Blasting Cardio"" had me in hopes of finding the ultimate Tae Bo workout that would really challenge me. Boy was I disappointed! If you have watched any of the previous tae bo videos, you will see most of the same moves recycled here.

And even more disappointing is the fact that Billy hasn't bothered to remove the flaws found with the previous workouts: He (and the background people) still looses count during the workout; both sides are not worked equally; both the warmup and cool down are not long enough (increasing the chance of muscular injury or soreness); and there are still some potentially dangerous movements (such as the jumping jack-sidekick combos) that could cause serious injury to your knee joints, no matter what condition you think you're in.

One plus is that, unlike some of the other videos (Cardio Circuit 2, for example), he does cut down on some of the more ineffective movements, like the one where he bends down and does a knee raise, which he says is for abs yet is not as effective as doing a simple crunch on the floor or even a side knee raise.

Still, one would think that after so many years of producing Tae Bo videos/dvds, he would revamp it and not keep putting the same old thing out under different titles.",1123027200,19,1400,4.682926829268292

Well, this video challenged me from the start.  I like the instruction, the music.  Billy Blanks does explain things, but yes, once in a while he does more reps on one side than another. I usually get bored with tapes- but I am excited to do this one.  I just ordered the resistence bands he uses, and two other Tae bo DVDs.

Tae Bo Fat Blasting, as opposed to other Tae Bo workouts I've done, really works the upper body. Usually with Billy's other tapes it's my legs, thighs, and bum that are completely worn out aftewards, but with this one it's my arms, shoulders, and back. After doing this I can barely feel my arms they are so tired. Try lifting them and it feels like weights pulling them down, lol!

You can order the resistance bands at Billy's website (or you can buy other general resistance bands at your store or Amazon). I've done this workout with and without the bands and it is definitely exponentially harder with them. But is a great workout.

My only two complaints: 1) Billy gives a cheesy motivational speaker sort of speech at the end that makes me roll my eyes (no biggie), and 2) you have to learn how to use the bands by yourself. Maybe a little short extra on the DVD explaining how to hold them, how to use them with the moves, ect, would have been helpful.

Anyway I highly recommend this. Other tapes I recommend: Kathy Smith Kickboxing Workout, Tae Bo Get Ripped Series, Tae Bo Flex, and the Yoga Zone series. GOOD LUCK!!!",1120176000,9,1190,4.444954128440367

Once you do it consistently, you pick up the moves and it is fun. I have been doing Billy Blanks exercise videos for about 3 weeks and notice a huge difference in the shape of my body, my core strength, flexibility, and power.

The kicking was hard at first. Now I am able to hold my leg out straight, I have really good technique and my abs have become stronger which help with the kicking.

The resistance bands are a must and you have to order them through Billy Blank's website. They only cost $14.95 and are a great piece of equipment to have. You can do the workout without them but you really should invest in the bands.

The only thing I would recommend is to stretch prior to starting the dvd. He does a warm-up but this dvd is a bit on the advanced side and his stretching period is not a long one.
