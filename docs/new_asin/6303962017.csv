I bought it and watch it every couple of months. It's a classic 60s comedy.",1138665600,5,254,4.204081632653061
740869,1,6303962017,"Thank goodness Dick Van Dyke's brilliant Never A Dull Moment recently got the classy widescreen treatment it so richly deserved, but Divorce American Style? Nope! They threw it into the crummy standard screen bin, like it was a piece of trash!

I mean it only starred Van Dyke and Debbie Reynolds,was directed by Bud Yorkin, with Conrad Hall as the Director of Photography. So I guess the studio (Columbia/Tristar) just didn't think these people were GOOD enough to deserve a widescreen release!

I will gladly buy this DVD, because the theatrical version was GREAT, but only IF it ever comes out in its original widescreen aspect ratio. Continue to boycott all standard screen butcher jobs, everyone!",1103846400,38,701,5.0344827586206895
740870,4,6303962017,"That si nothing but a comedy, but a very good one. No real depth about life but a very clear vision of divorce as nothing but business for both sexes. A man can be nearly destroyed by a divorce, but he can be regenerated by the remarrying of his ex-wife. So everything is organized by everyone so that ex-wives remarry and ex-husbands remarry too. It means no real love but only some business agreements here and there along the way. The twist comes through some hypnosis that completely meddles with the cards of the game and everything can start from the very same point the whole film had started from. Divorcing is some kind of artistic game in the middle-class suburbs.

741004,1,6303962017,"I like Dick Van Dyke, but this was a really stupid movie. I didn't find any of it funny. It was actually very depressing. No wonder I've never heard of the movie.",1448841600,,162,4.09375
741005,5,6303962017,"Looked all over for this movie and finally found it hereon Amazon. I think this movie is a true story of a divorce. It is basically how it goes. You get divorced, find yourself in limbo for awhile and try to figure out what to do next, and then you figure it out. Sometimes after it is all over, you go back to the way you were doing things before. That is what this movie shows. This couple only knows how to communicate one way....by arguing. Maybe this is how they show they love each other. Perverse to be sure. Each of the two date other people for awhile. They then find out that they don't exactly feel comfortable with that new person in their lives and those new people have their own sets of baggage. So, at a club one night, Debbie Reynolds and Dick Van Dyke go back to each other because that is what they know. If you expect a comedy with lots of light-hearted moments, you will probably be disappointed. If you watch this movie and see it for the study in divorce that it is, you might like it. It's suburbia. It's conflict. It's families. It's redoing. It's about relationships. I liked this movie---always have......",1447804800,4,1132,4.395238095238096

741008,3,6303962017,"This movie is the sad reality of bad communications, leading to some divorces in a marriage.  Too many people were involved in breaking up this couple. Not even a therapist could help them.  Dick Van Dyke's character did not understand his wife's definition of a real man.  Of course, he would be offended at what she had said. Neither of them were truly understanding each others needs.  This of course, divided them greatly.  Listening to all of the wrong advice, along with their bickering, didn't make things better.  This is a comedy I suppose, but found it sad at times.",1436659200,,576,4.71

741056,2,6303962017,"If you are looking for a film that embraces the more traditional roles of Dick V. and Debbie R. this is not it. I turned it off after about 30 minutes. The theme seemed to be that with enough sex and alcohol you can save your marriage. With the title already declaring the problem I didn't need 30 minutes of anger and fighting to set the stage. The humor in that part of the script helped relieve some of the tension but it was still too much for a 'comedy' film. This is the first film I have watched by either of these actors that I could not recommend, and being 60 years old myself I can promise you I am not new to their style or genre of films.",1390953600,2,651,4.015384615384615

741058,4,6303962017,"I first watched this on netflix and thought it was worth buying. It really captures the signature style of the 60s clothing, architecture. Unlike a lot of cute innocent themes of that time, this one delves into less talked about issues of relationship woes, sex and of course..  divorce. It's worth adding to your dvd collection.",1353801600,4,329,4.875
741059,5,6303962017,"Just saw this GREAT movie over holidays --came out originally in 1967.
I don't know how to explain that arguing could ever be therepeutic but somehow the WAY this movie is done, makes you realize how inane the topics of disagreement are, how ridiculous --how common divorce is and how it is a plight of America and the times in some ways so you really leave it having a much lighter outlook and I found the 60s themes actually ironically hilarious !
You leave not feeling depressed and sorrowful but with a new outlook and understanding of the situation --and exactly how and why it happens --so often. With a refreshing recollection or preview of the appliances and gadgets of the 60s that makes you stifle a laugh more than once and laugh out loud at how ridiculous the topics of that era were and how slanted and sexist often.
VERY WELL DONE Oldie in my opinion --highly recommend",1326844800,,883,4.559748427672956
741060,4,6303962017,"Screenwriter Norman Lear well and truly blew the lid off the previously taboo subject of divorce, in the brilliant social satire DIVORCE AMERICAN STYLE in 1967.  Dick Van Dyke and Debbie Reynolds play against type as a bitter married couple whose nightly fights end up landing them in divorce court.

Married for 17 years, Richard and Barbara Harmon (Van Dyke and Reynolds) have finally hit a stalemate in their relationship.  Constantly fighting and squabbling over every single little thing, the obvious cure is divorce.  The alimony and child support payments send Richard to the brink of the poverty line, where he meets fellow divorcee Nelson Downes (Jason Robards).  Nelson operates as a matchmaker of sorts for his lonely ex-wife Nancy (Jean Simmons) and pretty soon, Richard is in love all over again; but he'll never be able to marry her and maintain Barbara's alimony at the same time.  So Nelson and Nancy arrange for Barbara to ""meet"" rich car salesman Al Yearling (Van Johnson) in the hopes of an express trip down the wedding aisle...

DIVORCE AMERICAN STYLE ushered in a new wave of sophisticated romantic comedy with it's sharp script and canny performances.  Dick Van Dyke must have relished playing against the ""Rob Petrie"" image and has great fun with his role.  Jean Simmons is lovely; also keep your eyes out for an all-too-brief appearance from Eileen Brennan, playing Nelson's pregnant girlfriend (plus Emmaline Henry, aka Mrs Bellows from ""I Dream of Jeannie"").  Pat Collins (the ""hip hypnotist""), has a self-indulgent cameo towards the end of the picture, but does little to provide a genuine look at what hypnotism can really do...her scene looks hideously staged and Collins sadly comes off as a real pretender, much the same as her cameo in an episode of ""The Lucy Show"".

Debbie Reynolds, also playing against type for the first time in her career, will amaze you with her ferocious performance as Barbara.  In a recent interview, Ms Reynolds was quoted as saying: ""'That was a really hard part to get. The producer (Norman Lear) didn't want me. He didn't think I could play a married, ordinary woman. I think he thought I had to be all ""diva'd up"" and in a musical. And yet I really wanted to do it, and I knew I could do it. I kept auditioning for it and finally they let me do it. And I thought I was good in that. We all had a good time doing it. And I think Norman Lear liked me in it, after it was all done.""

DIVORCE AMERICAN STYLE is still light-years away from most of the rom-com dross on the shelf today.  Pick it up where you can; I guarantee you'll be in for a rare treat.",1255046400,,2614,4.654347826086957
741061,5,6303962017,"I also agree that they should have the wide screen. Dick is excellent, and Debbie is OK. Being a comedy writer, I appreciate the outstanding script by Norman Lear. Very clever indeed! I like the part with all the divorced kids at one of the houses, with the poor little girl, with the SECURITY BLANKET, being left behind. Also very interesting, is the couple preparing for bed: how well they work together, even after a nasty fight. And don't forget the orchestra leader standing on top of the hill, waving his baton at all the fighting couples behow. A great movie!",1172102400,4,566,4.6138613861386135
741062,5,6303962017,"Back in the day, as Dick van Dyke stumbled over a hassock in the Petrie living room week after week, somehow managing to rescue himself from ignominy and tumble right side up again, in triumph, the kids who watched him thought of him as their generation's version of Chaplin.  He seemed to take these comparisons to heart, however, and how painful it was to see Van Dyke tackle serious roles, the kinds of parts they gave Jackie Gleason when he got the serious bug as well.  It was horrible and, though we loved him deeply, that love only lasted for about a minute, replaced by a frantic indifference that sought to minimize even his obvious gifts.  He had an easy way about him, and he seemed to break into song as easily as falling off a log: not such a simple gift, for many stars never got the hang of it, even Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, you watch them inhale uncertainly right before the music starts up on the soundtrack.  They're panicking, and Van Dyke was always Mr. Cool, even when he wasn't cool.  His attempts at ""characterization"" were always, like Olivier, built on some physical trick, like playing Caracactus Potts the inventor in CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG with that unsightly squint, as though he were going blind instead of driving through the clouds.  And yet the sincerity he brought to Potts, and to Bert in MARY POPPINS and to Albert in BYE BYE BIRDIE, though bland and unexceptional, guaranteed the success of those pictures.  But in DIVORCE AMERICAN STYLE the unexpected thing happens and Dick Van Dyke gets sexy on us.  And in addition he displays some of the gift for comedy not of Chaplin perhaps, but of the revered French genius Jacques Tati.

In fact PLAYTIME, which must have premiered around the same time as DIVORCE AMERICAN STYLE, hasn't a patch on the latter when it comes to that strange, misty cinematography--its mise en scene, nothing less than everything in modern life including romance.  The great setpieces of DIVORCE are so reminiscent of those in PLAYTIME that one would be hard pressed to decide which came first.  The celebrated sequence in which Dick Van Dyke and Debbie Reynolds, furious spouses who aren't speaking to each other and in loud closeups, prepare for bed by getting in and out of each other's way, is just like the PLAYTIME sequence in which the hero enters the glass-walled apartment in Paris and encounters all the modern appliances.  How about when Debbie Reynolds and her girlfriend try to close down a savings account at the bank while Van Dyke and his buddy empty the safety deposit box, the camera cross cutting between the two groups of action like invisible arrows of distress and Eros.

And when Dick Van Dyke, stung by Reynolds' intention to divorce him, winds up on the darkened lawn of Jean Simmons, gazing up at her window, trying to make up his mind, stretching and lean in a pair of slacks and a windbreaker, he's like John Cusack with the radio over his head in SAY ANYTHING, except, yes, he's sexy.  I'm looking at him in profile and marveling, like a perve, my God, he's got some butt on him!  And then to top it all off there is the insane hypnotist sequence at the end where all the main characters assemble at a club while Ms. Pat Collins, an adult hypnotist of the era, goes through highlights of her notorious act.  She's from Fellini--they seem, eerily, and possibly in contrast to her, like real people in a real world of grief, pain and hope.

And how about Tim Matheson as the older of Van Dyke and Reynolds' two kids.  Has there ever been a more natural teenager in the movies--I don't think so.",1147737600,4,3583,4.615748031496063
