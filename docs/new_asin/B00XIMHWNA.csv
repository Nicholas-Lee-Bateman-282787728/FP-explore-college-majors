7168015,5,B00XIMHWNA,"I saw Apur Sansar (The World of Apu, the third film in the trilogy) in this new restoration in a recently-concluded theatrical showing at Film Forum NYC.  It is magnificant, like (or close to like) the movie must've looked when it was originally released.  And the story is very touching, very engaging.

This will be the new DVD or Blu-Ray version to get.  Of the existing ones (of Apur Sansar) that I've seen, I prefer the Columbia Tri-Star/Sony version, even with annoying bits of dust and dirt and such it's still very watchable.  There's also a newer one (I'm not certain of the label) which is digital remastered and ends up with less detail and an annoying light-to-dark pulsing.",1436054400,23,686,4.73109243697479

The community that allows life to grow with the ability to let go, not just the outcome but the process we hold onto to sleep at night in the arms of an angel. One that's violent but present aware yet no pushy. One the provides and teaches. The scens and the ligth is beautiful and the cut scenes in the drama is.

7168020,5,B00XIMHWNA,"Taken together, The Apu Trilogy represents the greatest achievement in cinema history. It's not just because Ray pawned off everything he (and his wife) owned to make it, scraping together money for equipment, sets and talent, it's also because of the incredible vision and humanity on display on the screen. If you're a human being, if you have parents, a sibling, if you've dealt with the death of a loved one, if you've ever felt like life was a hopeless, unfair and miserable struggle, if you've even experienced grace that only pure love can give, you will identity with every moment in these films. I tell people that The Apu Trilogy are three films that must be seen before you die. Having said that, I find myself resisting re-watching the films. Why? Because these aren't just films. They're like fragile keepsakes. They feel so vulnerable. They have no irony or ""attitude."" Their intent and message are very simple. The music score by Ravi Shanker itself will haunt you for the rest of your life. Here's the thing, watching these movies will re-trigger memories of loss, joy and loneliness in your own life. That's really saying something. After watching ""Aparajito"" and ""The World of Apu,"" I was seriously in what I can only a call a poetic funk. The movies reminded me how fragile life is, about the inevitability of death, and about the voids that open up after someone you love dies. ""No one should be alone,"" was something I said to myself over and over. Yet nature and life are both beautiful and cruel. They give and they take away, with no warning. The trilogy's ultimate message is one of redemption, but, like the rest of these movies, it's so delicate. Like love itself.",1486857600,3,1691,4.735593220338983

7168038,5,B00XIMHWNA,"There's no mystery that these are among the finest, most insightful films ever made.  What is especially worthy of remark is how wonderfully they have been restored and how good they look in Blu-ray.  Equally valuable are the many supplements which give us a real sense of Ray the artist and man.  My previous copies of the films were those issued without supplements by Sony, and while the Criterion dvds of the set issued some years ago included supplements which are repeated here, there are several extremely enlightening new ones in the Blu-ray set.",1449792000,11,554,4.872340425531915

If you are not even at least passing familiar with these films you can't be considered a fan of world cinema. It is a simple story of a boy named Apu from boyhood to manhood, filled with both tragedy and humor, and most importantly, finally enlightenment. It may be slow moving to some,but the themes of love and loss are universal. But I watched it all three at once in a five hour marathon and I was mesmerized. The score by the great Ravi Shankar is also amazing!",1447891200,6,554,4.4411764705882355

8715985,5,B00XIMHWNA,"This extraordinary trilogy earns it's place among cinema's greatest masterworks. The saga a young Bengali boy's journey into adulthood, feeling his way through the mysterious world, as he experiences living in rural poverty, trains to be a priest like his father, attends university in Calcutta, the unusual circumstances that he meets the love of his life, and becoming a wandering writer. Filmed in an unpretentious neorealist style, simply told but complex in nature, life, loss, love, family, religion, and one's place in the world are all confronted with uniquely gentle and artistic charm and heart breaking tragedy. These films are so pure, so genuine, and so thoughtful, they reach the heights of humanity in cinema. This towering landmark in Indian cinema was a shot heard around the world when first released in the 1950's , winning awards, establishing Satyajit Ray as a world class director, popularizing the music of Ravi Shankar, and has enchanted film-lovers ever since. This Criterion Collection set is superb. Extra content includes plenty of interviews, documentaries, and essays. The restoration is excellent -nothing short of a miracle, considering the original prints were damaged in a fire (this is documented in one of the many extras). These are must-see entries in world cinema and highly recommended to fans of foreign film (especially Kurosawa and Italian neorealists) and those that appreciate great storytelling.",1533859200,,1441,5.408888888888889
8715986,4,B00XIMHWNA,"My heading echoes the adult Apu who, in the last movie in the trilogy says, ""What is the use?"" and allows the pages of his autobiographical novel to blow away in a wind.

In the first two movies we enter the very real life of a rural Indian family whose members are all lovingly created by director and actors.  But their story is rather sad.  First Apu's young sister dies of illness, a fate shared much later by their father.  Then the life of the mother dwindles away and Apu is left alone.  The restoration of the nearly-destroyed films is a technological marvel, but I wondered if this tale would attain to anything of lasting value by the end.

With the third and last movie in this series, I can reach a somewhat different conclusion.  There is death and suffering in this last part too as Apu's wife dies early on but the entire narrative reaches a sudden and surprising resolution when Apu unites with his long-abandoned little boy who is himself a mirror of Apu growing up.  There is something of a vacuous Asian experience in this cinematic telling but it doesn't really come to nothing as the stereotype might suggest.  I recall that experience in David Lean's rendering of E.M.Forster's Passage to India, a wonderful movie too, but lending itself to earlier Western ideas about the East.  An element of life, freedom, joy bursts upon us at the end of Ray's movie and transforms everything we have seen before.  Yes, life is risky, unpredictable, filled with suffering, but it can still lead to something wonderful.",1522627200,,1527,4.681647940074907

8715989,5,B00XIMHWNA,"Years before trilogies were in vogue, way before ""The Godfather"" there was ""The Apu Trilogy"".  The original negatives were lost in a fire and yet Criterion has managed to work miracles with this masterful restoration of this beautiful classic tale of the life of a Bengalese child to adulthood over 3 films.  The story is compelling and absorbing and directed as only a master like Satyajit Ray can.  Any attempt to further describe this movie would just not do justice to it; it has to be experienced and rewards repeated viewing.  This release also includes a 48-page booklet of essays on the film in addition to the 3 blu ray discs of the films.  Great sound and picture quality is evident as well considering the film's age and source master.

This worthy addition to any art-film buff's video library comes highly recommended!",1511481600,3,831,4.816901408450704
