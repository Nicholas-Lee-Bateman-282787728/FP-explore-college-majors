I will say that the quality of this Blu-ray is great; it plays fine in players built in North America (it was shipped from Hong Kong, I think, but arrived in about two weeks). I have about 40 Miike films on disc and this is one of my favorites. If you're a fan and don't have this: don't hesitate. Order now!",1455148800,4,384,4.0
8585836,5,B00CSTLYBU,"If you're a fan of Takashi Miike than this is a must buy for you. This also became one of my favorite horror movies ever.

Their is some much going on in this movie. Their are a lot of weird things, such as a gun growing an eyeball and talking, and crow electrocution. It is also written very well. Their are a lot of characters, and a couple of them do get lost in the shuffle, but most of them are well done. Their I some really good camera work as well, and some creative editing.

Overall, this is a technically sound film, with some really creative stuff in it.",1451779200,3,566,4.136363636363637
8585837,5,B00CSTLYBU,"This was exactly what I was looking for. Please do understand that this movie is *not* for everybody but, if you like this sort of thing, it has a good payoff. It's not in English right now but I'm sure that may change soon.",1419724800,2,224,4.113636363636363

8585841,5,B00CSTLYBU,Daring. Bold. Jaw-dropping. Bloody. The opposite of Hollywood slasher fare -- pushing boundaries of on-screen violence. Superb video and audio.,1387843200,7,143,6.2
8585842,5,B00CSTLYBU,"at least for a big fan like me.  This on is tamer that many but still has plenty of blood.

 an attractive and seemingly popular high school teacher has no problem bedding a female student or blackmailing a gay colleague - in fact, he's kind of fond of murder to the point of excess.

Some see this as a comedy but that is a bit of a stretch.  I'd classify it as a thriller with some dark humor.  Oddly, I kind of cheered for the villain.",1382140800,5,438,4.034883720930233
8585843,5,B00CSTLYBU,"Miike's ""Lesson of the Evil"" is without a doubt the most gory, active, killing movie ever made.  Takashi Miike has overdone it this time taking a mild mannered handsome high school teacher who the students adore and use him as a father figure and make him into a cold blooded killer.  The first two thirds of this film leads us up to the slaughter by providing in very unique glimpses our teacher's background (thus a ""to be continued"" frame at this film's end). Then the last third is the killing part with shotgun in hand and samurai sword at the ready our teacher attacks his students and faculty at their nighttime graduation party, and the slaughter makes the ""Battle Royale"" series of films seem like child's play.  First there's the teachers 17 year old student girlfriend, and a friend of hers who leaves the dance to check on her whereabouts, then there is the hallway of students trying to escape all 12 of them trapped in a stairwell cause the connecting doors are locked.  Every student who tries to hide or get away is hunted down and dispatched.  My body count came out at  42 and everyone of them shown in gory detail.  As the white gloved business suited police lead our rambling teacher away you must be prepared for more in a film yet to come.  If you can stomach this kind of thing watch it, but I truly want to know if anyone enjoys it?  And, oh yes, Happy Graduation.",1378598400,7,1388,4.476190476190476
