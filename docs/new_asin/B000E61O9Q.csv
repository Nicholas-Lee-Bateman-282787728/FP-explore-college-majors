8106304,5,B000E61O9Q,"A wonderful combination of interviews with real people from the Fruita area and absolute silliness. They obviously had too much fun making this. If you can't get it at Amazon, go to Fruita for the Mike festival and get a copy there. Worth the trip to Colorado.",1275091200,,260,4.553191489361702
8106305,4,B000E61O9Q,"Hilarious, and true.  I wish this would happen today, so I could see it up close.  Some of the film quality was grainy, but it was also of film clips that are 60 years old. Funny comic book style.",1144886400,,196,4.0
8106306,4,B000E61O9Q,"I just watched this film and was inspired to immediately write about it.  I would not believe this to be legit if I hadn't watched this film.  I figured it was like most carnival side shows in the '40s....phony.  But this proves it to be true.

The movie itself is very artsy yet very factual and in many places quite funny. The people from this little town of Fruita take this thing very seriously.

Definitely worth the money.",1138060800,2,428,4.435897435897436
