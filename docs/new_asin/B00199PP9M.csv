3430613,2,B00199PP9M,"Hollywood Star Leigh (Amanda Crew) returns to her small home town (of about 200,000 people) with her manager. In the films she plays ""squeaky clean"" roles. She oddly stays in a hotel, until we realize she has a checkered past, one that the owner of an adult entertainment establishment blackmails her over. She attempts to steal back the material and things go awry as Tess (Katie Boland) a fan, comes to her rescue.

The bulk of the film takes place in the dark at a closed strip joint with people bonking and stabbing each other. It was rather boring as Amanda Crew doesn't soar above a ""B"" acting status. The plot goes no where in this Canadian thriller.

Okay as a desperation rental.

Parental Guidance: F-bomb. Blurred sex on TV. A grope scene. No nudity.",1381449600,4,761,4.622222222222222
3430614,5,B00199PP9M,I must say that I loved this movie.  The actors were extraordinary and believable.  This movie flowed very nicely.,1224633600,,114,4.947368421052632
3430615,1,B00199PP9M,"Ferocious like a newborn puppy. It should have been titled Atrocious. The actors must have paid to be in this movie. Watch it if you must. Why does it appear that all of the free prime movies that are available, most are not worth watching?",1462406400,,240,4.355555555555555

3430617,2,B00199PP9M,would have been ok as an old drive in movie.,1456617600,,44,3.5
3430618,1,B00199PP9M,"The title is a misnomer, this should have been called ""Atrocious"". The plot strains credulity and drags on, the acting is wooden, and it's not campy enough to make it at least entertaining. This low budget production makes most Lifetime thrillers look sophisticated in comparison. Briefly, it's a complete waste of time.",1446681600,2,320,5.173076923076923
3430619,2,B00199PP9M,"I bought this because I'm an Amanda Crew fan, but not much new here just a little mystery and some killing. So I got my Amanda Crew fix and it was reasonably priced.",1442016000,,165,4.03030303030303
3430620,2,B00199PP9M,I really like Amanda Crew and Kim Coates is a decent actor who usually plays a villain.  This movie was poorly conceived and I felt that effected the acting.  The plot progression was extremely predictable.  The dramatization seemed like what I would see in a daytime soap opera with a little slasher B movie mixed in.  So this movie probably isn't worth your time and certainly not worth your money.,1434067200,2,400,4.671428571428572
