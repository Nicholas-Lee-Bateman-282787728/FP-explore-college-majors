8064059,3,B0009NZ6OS,"The David Steinberg Show is a variety show, with an unconventional format.  This four disc set contains 21 half hour episodes from 1976, plus an interview with the comedian.  David Steinberg is Canadian, and this program recorded in Toronto, features the early work of some comedians who later achieved some notoriety, including Martin Short, John Candy, Joe Flaherty, Dave Thomas, Trudy Young, and Andrea Martin.  The show also features major contributions from Bill Saluga, as both an actor and writer.  The name conscious Raymond J. Johnson, is Saluga's most famous comedic character.

Steinberg typically opens the show with a monologue, telling a few jokes.  Often during the monologue, Steinberg will be interrupted, either by that week's guest star, or by the character Raymond J. Johnson.  David then introduces singer Johnny del Bravo, played by Martin Short.  Typically while Del Bravo is singing, David leaves the studio and heads over to the Hello Deli, a small diner run by Vinny DeMilo (Saluga).  At the diner, David, Vinny, and the week's guest star(s) engage in some kind of comedy sketch.  After this, the show usually switches back to the studio for some kind of performance featuring the guest star.

Steinberg's show has an unusual format, but unfortunately is seldom very funny.  The many attempts to incorporate guests into the pet routines featuring Johnny del Bravo and the Hello Deli, are only occasionally successful.  With so many supporting players, the focus is often so diffuse, that in some episodes the guest stars actually do very little.  In general, the talents of the various guest stars are not showcased very well.

The program has a nice variety of guest stars from the 70's, from the legendary Milton Berle, to USC running back Anthony Davis.  Other notables appearing are Jon Voight, Ethel Merman, Robert Vaughn, Ruth Ruzzi, Tommy Smothers, Norm Crosby, Michele Lee, and Adrienne Barbeau.

What David Steinberg probably does best is standup comedy, making astute and quirky observations on current events.  Sketch comedy, and performing songs does not appear to be his strength, which is somewhat unusual for the host of a variety show.  Steinberg's most memorable recurring role probably involves a sketch where he plays a nutty physiatrist whose favorite lines are ""Get off!"" and ""Booga booga"".

In an informative half hour interview segment, David Steinberg explains how the show adapted its format from The Jack Benny Show, and The Burns and Allen Show.  He also discusses some of the guest stars, and the supporting cast, many who went on to bigger things.  One thing not mentioned is Bill Saluga, who had such a major role on the program, and seemingly limited appeal.  Steinberg was apparently the youngest person to guest host The Tonight Show for Johnny Carson, reportedly appearing on the program over 130 times.

Bouncing around between the studio and the diner, the David Steinberg Show is just unfocused.  The progressive format might have been an admirable experiment, but comedically it misses the mark more than it hits.  Showing improvement, the programs at the end of the season are significantly better than those at the start.  But The David Steinberg Show is still mostly an acquired taste, that will probably be most appreciated by those with a deep affection for the 1970's, or the early works of comics Candy, Short, and Flaherty.",1321056000,5,3395,5.103260869565218
8064060,5,B0009NZ6OS,"David Steinberg was one of my favorite comedians and when he got his own show I never missed it.  Having the opportunity to watch the show now with my grown children and grandchildren has been such a treat.  You can't believe how good it is to hear, ""Booga Booga"" coming from the living room while we are all cooking in the kitchen!",1319500800,3,332,4.338709677419355
8064061,3,B0009NZ6OS,"I originally purchased this set for the cameo appearances of numerous SCTV stars, including Martin Short, John Candy, and Joe Flaherty. For better and worse, the DS Show is a slow, somewhat plodding, 'behind the scenes' look at Steinberg's fictional, Toronto based variety show.
The DS does indeed seem to be a precursor to the Larry Sanders Show, but it lacks momentum and timing. Additionally, the guest stars are much less relevant today than they were 30 years ago. This is to be expected, but it's hard to enjoy 30 minutes of Conrad Bain in the 21st century.
Still, for aficionados of sketch comedy TV, there is still merit in the DS show. Some of the appearances of Candy and Martin Short (as the beloved Johnny Bravo) are priceless. And I cannot deny the stage comedy of david Steinberg himself. It But the show as scripted just never drew me in.
Unfortunately, the true comedy sketches are too far and few between. I will admit to watching the show in 4X fast forward play, essentially covering a 23 minute episode in less than 10 minutes.",1265673600,5,1047,4.664864864864865
