204571,5,1936906260,"My two and three year old grandsons, love this DVD.  They enjoyed learning all the names of the creatures.  It took some time for them to be able to distinguish between the manattees and the seals, etc.  but caught on after awhile.  It is a great way to share time bonding while helping them develop numerous skills.  The dvd is a combination of real photo film and animation.  One grandson kept asking for the ""dolphin movie"" , his favoritite creatures.  It was great to have a dvd that we could interact together with.",1134777600,3,520,4.526881720430108

""Hi sir,

If you looked in the comments section when you bought the dvd you should of noticed that I stated I only had one DVD. I unforunately don't have the other DVD for you. If you don't want this DVD just send it back and once I receive it I will give you a full refund.
Thanks,

Now, if you take a look at the amazon.com you will still find the same advertisement advertising 2 DVDs in the package. Whoever sells this thing is a liar and a thief. Amazon, how come you allow this?",1298851200,2,743,4.21830985915493
