8379747,5,B002SZQCA2,"Excellent program.  Beware, this is the same program as ""How the Earth Changed History.""  Amazon recommends buying them together.  Don't.",1485561600,,137,5.75
8379748,3,B002SZQCA2,"The content of the Multi-format DVD is excellent.  Iain Stewart is knowledgeable and entertaining as the host of this documentary.

HOWEVER, THE MULTI-FORMAT BLU-RAY DISC DOES NOT PLAY IN MY STANDARD AMERICAN BLU-RAY PLAYER.

The description says that this item will play in all regions, but it does not.",1483315200,,304,5.163265306122449
8379749,4,B002SZQCA2,"While I'm not a great fan of Iain Stewart, this is a well done and interesting DVD without too much of the usual anthropogenic global warming nonsense thrown in to try to educate the unwashed masses about this non-problem.",1424476800,,222,4.717948717948718

8379752,1,B002SZQCA2,"Terrible. I live in the USA and the seller apparently lives in Europe and it does not play on my dvd player. I should have been notified before purchasing that it might not work hence the shipping address. Furthermore I just found out about the different regions and how that works, had I have known I would have not purchased it.",1380672000,,330,4.426229508196721
8379753,5,B002SZQCA2,"I reviewed the DVDs before sending them on to my grandchildren. The professor leads the expedition to places that are unknown to the vast majority of us, explains in clear and easy to understand presention why mankind developed the way they did and where they lived over that past 10,000 years. This is a must see for everyone above the age of 10.
