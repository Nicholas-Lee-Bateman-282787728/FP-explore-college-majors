8557910,5,B00AUC46H6,"I own many of Roberts methods, and love them all. Learning from Robert is like learning from Wes Montgomery, Grant Green or Johnny Smith in person. He is one of the last great guitarists who was there when jazz reached its high-water mark. Robert has spent 50 years discovering the secrets of guitar and man does it show. His solos rock harder than Metallica ever thought about rockin', and his chord melody will bring you to your knees. And if that wasn't enough, check out ""Big City Blues"" instructional series for the best blues YOU have ever heard in your life. Why he isn't a household name, I'll never know.",1451606400,,613,4.581818181818182

As many of you, I have spent over a 1K$ in jazz guitar methods alone. They all have the same structure; learning all the scales, modes and try to make music approche.
Robert Conti, is the first to really use the old masters methods of learning and they have proved to be the best approche to this day final word.
Thanks a million for giving me the drive to finaly make music with all the blabla...

8557913,5,B00AUC46H6,"Everything's there to get you started providing you already have your guitar ... even a simple acoustic guitar is enough to establish your own modest set-list of widely popular classic jazz standards featured on this DVD; the unique live performances always seem to capture the inner spirit of the song solos which you'll learn to apply your own feel to within a short period of time playing. The intimacy of the ""personal coaching"" and the philosophy on how solos are executed on the guitar, among a lot of other things usually referred to as 'off the sheet tips', help the focused viewer advance to the goal of being a significantly better jazz/blues guitar player.",1377734400,2,667,4.859649122807017
8557914,5,B00AUC46H6,"This is a great DVD. I've been trying to learn jazz guitar and have spent a lot of money and time studying scales and modes.  Although my knowledge of music theory has developed, my soloing sounded bad.  My teacher would say use ""D Dorian here"" - solo still sounded bad.
I didn't have the language / licks to use.  This is very helpful.  Will be getting more.",1367539200,3,359,4.313432835820896
8557915,5,B00AUC46H6,"Robert Conti is the most prolific author of jazz guitar instruction books in history. He is a bonafide virtuoso player who had gigged and recorded with the greats over a 50 year career - and is still going strong.

Conti's approach is unique in emphasizing playing and connecting melodic lines versus the traditional approach of first learning many scales and modes. His teaching receives rave reviews and there are many examples of his students playing amazingly well on YouTube using techniques learned from him.

If you are seriously interested in jazz guitar, start with this book and you will likely be hooked and go on to purchase many other of his vast array of learning products.",1367539200,4,687,4.913793103448276
