5092848,5,B007K7IAVC,We watched this show and enjoyed every minute of it.  The actors did a really good job of portraying this story.,1352851200,5,112,4.333333333333333
5092849,4,B007K7IAVC,"Need another lightweight romantic comedy?  With LeAnn Rimes and good ol'boy veteran Burt Reynolds at the reigns or is it fishing reel?

Up and coming lawyer(Rimes) rushes back to her country hometown at the news that her father(Reynolds) suffered a heart attack.  She crashes her yuppie boyfriend's snazzy car and meets the auto repairman, a potential, heartthrob of her life, maybe.

There's lots of folksy humor and a bit of hero and heroine at odds romance as Rimes character deals with whipping her somewhat estranged father, whom only wants to fish, into shape, dealing with her career and boyfriend and getting back to Chicago vs. a developing love, getting to know her dad, and realizing what she may have been missing in her rush for success.

Yes, yes, it's quite predictable, but the countryside is pretty, I think they shot it in Canada, and LeAnn Rimes can act; however, don't expect any singing.  She, also, wears the same outfit for most of the movie.  In the short extras, she states she was ready to burn it by the end of the shoot.

It's a PG kind of movie by CMT, but the kids will be totally bored.  For adults seeking some mindless, RC escapism- I seem to need more and more of that lately.  3 1/2 stars.",1341792000,3,1224,4.599078341013825
5092850,3,B007K7IAVC,"Holly (LeAnn Rimes) is a Chicago lawyer with a lawyer boyfriend Carl (Jeff Roop). Carl is given a typical Hollywood shallow personality. When Holly's dad (Burt Reynolds) has a heart attack while fishing, Holly returns home to help out, although her presence is not overly appreciated. While in route she wreaks her boyfriend's car, something he seems to care about more than her.

While in town in Alabama Holly meets her old girlfriend from high school (Mary Ashton) and the proverbial hunky nice guy mechanic who works on her car (Shawn Roberts). There is also a record sized bass in the lake Burt calls ""Queen of Sheba"" and has been trying to catch. Christian Potenza plays Everett, Burt's son who likes his drink.

This isn't ""Tamara Drewe"" funny. The humor is light as is the drama. It is a simple non-offending story that we might expect Doris Day to play the lead, a chick flick that may be viewed as a light romantic comedy with a fishing theme in an attempt to get males to watch it too.

PARENTAL GUIDE: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Some implied nudity in a hot tub (all shoulder up) and some PG sex references.",1341619200,7,1120,4.59
5092851,3,B007K7IAVC,"It was a little too predictable for me. I feel that this story has been made a million different ways and they all end up the same. Girl comes home to help her dad who is sick even though she has left to escape that town and make something of herself. She has an obnoxious boyfriend you can see from the beginning won't last. She meets a guy that is much better looking and much better for her. There are a few crazy things happen and then of course all problems are worked out with family and she ends up with the right guy and realizing the town is just where she wants to be. Blah, blah, blah. Like I said the story has been told in so many movies over and over again in about 10 different ways. It was cute and cheesy and the guy was fun to look at, but the story is tired.",1432857600,,777,3.9554140127388533

5092860,1,B007K7IAVC,"Regardless of what others say, this to my wife and I, was a real turkey. We couldn't even make it through the first half of the movie. The actors did were stiff and unbelievable, and did not develop any depth of character. The story line is weak and and seems to have a hard time identifying a real purpose for the movie, except to give actor has beens and hopefuls a chance to be in a movie.  Didn't save this one it went straight to the trash bin.
