5109955,5,B007TWKH50,"Very highly recommended. But, it is not perfect. It is 2 hours of instruction and demonstations along with practice ideas. Everyone who has ever done martial arts training and thinks it might be useful as self defense needs to watch this.

This DVD is about the transition from martial arts training to being prepared mentally and physically for real world self defense. The dojo is a safe place to practice. The bar or street can be a completely different environment. In the dojo you train with people who are helping you improve technique without getting injured. In the bar or street you encounter people who want to hurt you, steal from you, cripple you. Different places and different approaches are needed if you want to survive.

Rory Miller will show you why the techniques you have learned in the dojo are not going to protect you. For example, he has participants demonstrate a standard martial arts knife defense. Then he shows you why they will not work if you get ambushed by someone who wants to hurt you and who hides the knife behind their back until they are 6 inches from you. You have to learn how the bad guys think and act.

He also talks to you about how to deal with the police and the legal system after you have ""won"". Here is a hint: the bad guys will often claim that you attacked them. The police will often assume that the person who is standing at the end of the fight (hopefully you) is the criminal who initiated it. Even if you are not charged in a crimal court, you also have to be prepared to be sued in cival court to pay the expenses and damages suffered by the person who actually attacked you. Just because you won the fight does not mean that you have survived financially. He also talks about the medical consequences of your fight and the physical and mental therapy you may need to recover.

Most martial arts training involve what can best be described as ""training exercise techniques"" that are designed to build your fitness levels and teach your muscles how to do certain techniques. You block, then move and then counter attack. Too slow. You need to proactice single step techniques that combine the 3 steps into a single move. The exercise techniques are not even used after you get a black belt level and do free fighting exercises. They are strong. But too slow so you abbreviate them. Rory Miller describes the different approaches needed to survive violence in the real world.

Having praised the DVD, I have to mention some of the limitiations. First, it is just too shor to completely cover the subject. Several times he tells you to go read his book for more information. I am going to do that next. Finally, while he does tell you to develop and practice a single reflex technique that will give you a few seconds if you are ambushed, none of the reflex techniques he suggests would have protected you from that guy with hidden knife.",1337817600,3,2893,4.566473988439307
5109956,5,B007TWKH50,"If you've been to a self-defense or martial arts seminar, you'll hear all of the same fluff and same best case scenarios and same pontifications, but who has really been in the heat of things, been shot at, trained prison guards, and had the honesty to come clean about how things really are?  Sgt Rory Miller has and is completely truthful and brutally honest about his own experiences in a way I haven't seen or heard since talking with combat vets over my own kitchen table.

This is absolutely required viewing for anyone seriously trying to learn to protect themselves and/or others, travelers, those of us who don't live in ivory towers and are protected by armed guards.  According to some, there are three kinds of people in the world: sheep / sheepeople (the average citizen), wolves (the bad guys, tangos, etc), and sheep dogs (those who protect the sheep like law enforcement, our military, etc).  This is indispensable eye-opening view into violence which needs to be viewed by the sheepeople (yes, that's my creation and I should have it trademarked) and for those sheepdogs to have a better understanding of all phases of having to face violence from the mental training to the aftermath.

This is absolutely required viewing for those who care about those around them. Sgt Miller, if you ever come through Oklahoma, the first beer's on me.",1336953600,4,1354,4.8441558441558445
5109957,5,B007TWKH50,"Much like the book Facing Violence, this DVD is simply amazing and needs to be on your shelf.  Rory Miller breaks everything down into simple terms and covers the Legal and Ethical implications, violence dynamics, how to avoid dangerous situations and so much more.  A lot of instructors will teach you how to fight, maybe how to win, Rory Miller takes the time to talk about the realities of what can and will happen, with freezing up to the after math of the violence.  Not buying this DVD is doing yourself a disservice.",1336521600,3,523,4.602150537634409
5109958,5,B007TWKH50,"Rory Miller makes it very clear that the quality of defending against violence is very different than training martial arts.
He has very strong opinions and some strong language too. (should not be a problem for adults, but I would not play this DVD for young children.) He makes it very clear from the opening frame that violence can be unexpected and like nothing you train for in the gym or dojo. He invites a student up to introduce himself to the camera and then sucker punches him to make a point.

Even before reading the book and watching the DVD, I knew in my heart that 15 years of martial arts training is still nowhere near what I need to defend myself against violence. Luckily,my little world has been fairly peaceful. Not so for many others, and we should all be prepared. You can push your thumb into an orange for practice, but can you push it through a human's eye? You would shoot an attacker raging at you with a huge butcher knife and you are cornered with no place to escape. But if that attacker were 15, or 12 or 8, or a woman, a pregnant woman, kids in the room, your kids in the room?  Mr. Miller puts a real face on violent situations.

He plays out how to defend yourself in the courts after you have defended yourself against a live attack. It is an important point, maybe you survive an attack, but spend your fortune and spend years of your life in jail because a jury does not believe it was self defense.

Perhaps you have trained for decades in a deadly martial arts. For decades you have pulled punches and kicks, choke holds and strikes because you do not want to injure your students or training partners. Your groin strike hits the thigh so you don't disable the groin. Now what happens in a violent situation? You have trained to miss, so your reaction is trained to miss.

This DVD and the companion book clearly shows that violence is different animal and you need a different mindset to defend against it.
Buy both the book and the DVD, and recommend them to your friends and students, it may save a life.",1336435200,6,2047,4.404761904761905
5109959,5,B007TWKH50,"This DVD was, in my opinion, outstanding and very informative. Rory continues to keep my interest and mind open. He discusses and gives examples of the multifaceted violence contiuum, from before it happens to the aftermath. He pulls no punches and tells it like it is with straightforward honesty. Thank you, Rory, for bringing your book to life on DVD so that we can understand better what you gave stated in the written form!",1336348800,3,428,4.797297297297297
5109960,5,B007TWKH50,"Mr. Miller puts his all into every book and video. I think this is a must have for anyone serious about their safety, and the safety of their loved ones.",1396656000,,153,4.133333333333334
5109961,5,B007TWKH50,"I'd read the book, but I was still surprised by how much I learned from the DVD.

Normally I try to give more details when I review. Yet I feel almost redundant reviewing this.

Of great interest to me was the portion at the end where he is discussing the harmful effects of violence, including the effects of surviving and even ""winning"" a fight, on most people. This is something rarely discussed and he discusses it well. Great product.",1396310400,,439,4.544303797468355
5109962,4,B007TWKH50,"This is the first of many videos I am buying from Rory Miller, He talks about practical self defense and how to prepare for an attack. Rory goes over things that I always knew but it didn't really hit me until he says it like how every training drill has its flaws, something I always knew but never thought too much about before. There are really no techniques shown its more about strategy.

BOTTOM LINE, EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE should watch this video, if you have done martial arts or not is irrelevant. This is a good DVD and I recommend it to anyone that I talk to about self defense.",1394668800,,595,4.3125
5109963,5,B007TWKH50,"No, I don't get a kickback, but 30 plus years of first hand experience on the street and in various sub-cultures have shown me that Sgt Miller knows his stuff, and the no BS approach and real world/time information found in the book and this DVD is absolutely worth the money.  I bought a spare just in case this wears out or is borrowed from my personal library... it's good.",1377648000,,376,4.371428571428571
5109964,4,B007TWKH50,I feel that Rory Miller does a great job of not only teaching self-defense; but also the legal implications involved in defending yourself.  It is a great video for both experienced and novice students.,1372809600,,202,4.9411764705882355
5109965,5,B007TWKH50,"Love this guy.  I read his first two books during my last deployment and was able to immediately begin to apply concepts to my instruction to other service members and students.  The video, however, fills in the little things that just couldn't be clarified in the books.  The training exercises demonstrated were also very interesting.  I'd love to meet Miller face-to-face and pick his brain on matters.  If you don't have this, and you're at all serious about REAL self defense training, BUY IT!",1359763200,2,498,4.880952380952381
5109966,4,B007TWKH50,"I have read Rory Miller's book Facing Violence and like other reviewers this is a must own with the book. I thought the ""Articulation Wars"" and ""Aftermath"" talks were awesome.  There is so much more information and tactics Miller can share that he can make DVDs on each topic alone and I hope he does in the future. Check out his book ""Scaling Force"" as well, another excellent work by him.

Only drawbacks was there was this annoying low music being played in the background. It did not ruin the content at all but like I said it was noticeable. Miller could also have gone into more depth about ""Articulation Wars"" and Deescalation but I guess it's hard because of time constraints for one DVD.

In closing it was very informative.",1358553600,2,733,4.580152671755725
5109967,4,B007TWKH50,"As said by others, the format is similar to a seminar: you get brief lectures followed by demonstrations. This seminar is for those who are interested in the whole spectrum of self-defense, from avoidance/de-escalation to the legal repercussions. Even though you may have attended your martial arts classes regularly, will you be prepared for the predator who looks to make you his next victim? The point is driven home that how it goes down in the street or bar is much different than the martial arts studio or dojo. I especially liked the instructor's reflex technique. In real life, the attacker may look for the element of surprise and you'll need an aggressive flinch type of technique to stop the attack. It needs to be simple, taking into account the adrenaline dump which causes diminished vision, breathing and fine motor skills. The only problem I have with this DVD is that it skims over some important points, but to its credit, it covers a lot of material in two hours. For an introductory overview of self-defense, it's a fine production. You don't need to quit your regular martial arts training because this is complementary. Like anything, you need to practice this stuff on a consistent basis to gain the benefits. It's a solid supplement to a standard martial arts skill-set, especially for realistic self-defense.",1350950400,5,1334,4.959821428571429
5109968,5,B007TWKH50,"Excellent DVD fills in some of the missing parts of martial arts training.  First - how not to be there in the first place (best strategy yet.)  Last - the 3 part mantra on what to do if the worst day of your life happens.  By better understanding what will go on at each step, anyone can become better prepared.  I wish I lived in a world that was safe for everyone, but until Utopia breaks out, anything that makes us all a little safer is a step in the right direction.  I would recommend this video for all women and martial artists.",1350172800,3,537,4.174757281553398
5109969,5,B007TWKH50,"Although there is also a book of the same title, this DVD discusses certain topics in great detail which the book only touches upon, and as this information is extremely valuable it is important that you get the DVD in addition to the book.

One of those topics is ""articulation wars,"" in which Rory gives several examples of how important it is to watch what you say to responding officers immediately after the incident.  Massad Ayoob and a few other instructors have addressed this topic in the past, but never in such detail nor from such a realistic and relevant perspective.  The most important things you need to know are: 1. Officer Friendly is not ""on your side""; and 2. If your attacker is an experienced criminal he will know the magic words and linguistic tricks that will paint himself as an innocent victim and you as the aggressor.  These are facts, and very few instructors talk about it because, to be perfectly frank, most instructors have never actually been in that situation since very few have ever been in an actual fight outside of training.  Fighting is a complex thing which does not end with the physical altercation.  Nope.  When Officer Friendly arrives on the scene, he doesn't know what happened and will be relying upon witness statements as well as both sides of the story . . . and an experienced criminal's story will be well rehearsed and very convincing, whereas you will likely be highly adrenalized and blurting out all sorts of damaging and potentially incriminating information that will be taken down verbatim and used as evidence against you.  The criminal will lie, as will all his friends, and they will all say the same thing: they weren't doin' nuthin' wrong and you attacked them for no reason.  Rory demonstrates how easy it is for an honest citizen to unknowingly incriminate himself simply by speaking freely to the police.  It is so important for you to meditate upon certain phrases to use in response to police questioning, as well as certain points which need to be clarified and other statements which might make it appear as if you somehow violated the law.  Surprisingly, this is one of the most important aspects of self defense as what you say at that moment will likely determine if you are going to be arrested and prosecuted . . . yet it is rarely addressed at all.

Another topic is the difference between ""social violence"" which is common dominance based aggression committed by amateurs, usually over hurt feelings and drunken stupidity, which over 90% of all self defense training addresses - and ""predatory violence"" which is committed by career criminals who have practiced their technique and know exactly how they are going to strike without warning and take you out of commission instantly so they can rob you.  Very few instructors discuss predatory violence at all, because it is a scary subject as the attacks tend to be extremely brutal and very difficult to defend against as they are ambushes rather than a traditional fight.  Rory reinforces that a predatory criminal is experienced, skilled, and far more dangerous than a barroom brawler - and the attack will be completely different, and if you have no idea what to expect you will not be able to defend against it.  A predator has no intention of ""fighting"" anyone - he just wants to hurt them so badly that there will be no ""fight"" - and he is not going to square off against you like your training partner does, but will suckerpunch you and beat you repeatedly, possibly with a weapon, until you stop moving.  That is what you need to be prepared to face, not a flurry of ineffective roundhouse punches after an exchange of insults.

A third topic is that of ""breaking the freeze,"" which is extremely important as, like Rory says, it happens to everyone and seems to be a hardwired natural reaction to sudden danger.  I have rarely heard anyone discuss this at all, yet it is vital.  Rory goes into great detail about different types of freezes and how to prepare for it and overcome it.

Again, the DVD goes into great detail about several essential topics that were briefly addressed in the book, and it is vital that you be familiar with this material.  I have seen dozens of self defense videos and this is, by far, the best - even though it does not discuss moves or techniques at all.  Technique is secondary to proper mindset, and as Rory says, he doesn't want to teach you how to fight like him - every student needs to discover what moves feel right for them rather than copying some instructor.  Very good advice about how blindly copying technique will make you an inferior fighter, and how most common sparring methods are setting you up to fail in an actual fight.  Absolutely brilliant instruction.  Rory is the best instructor I have ever seen . . . and I have seen all the top rated guys over the past two decades.  This DVD gets my highest recommendation.",1347580800,23,4906,4.695449241540257

5109973,5,B007TWKH50,"No secret here, I 'm a fan of Rory Miller's work, no question. And in the interest of transparency, he is a friend, so I am predisposed to say good things about his work. And I will do just that.

The 7 sections in this DVD range from; The legal and ethical implications, dynamics, avoidance, and more. Miller wraps it all up in a violent colored bow with, The aftermath. These subjects are dealt with in a solid, and real manner. Further these subjects are field tested and made available here for you to integrate into your own training, as well as your students.

Rory Miller, ""The Minister of Reality,"" brings the truth from the beginning, through the middle,

5109975,5,B007TWKH50,"""Facing Violence"" is a very good guide to preparing for all aspects of a violent encounter, not just the physical aspects but also the ethical, legal, and even emotional fallout. The instructor, Rory Miller, is an experienced Corrections Officer and martial artist, and it is very clear that he is not a stranger to the judicious use of force in his career working in the prison system.

First of all, it is important to know that this is not a purely action centric fighting video. To be sure, there is plenty of training and fighting instruction but there is also a lot of lecture based instruction that imparts very good information that goes above and beyond ""how to fight"", but it does come across somewhat dry. The video is divided into sections covering ""Legal and ethical implications"", ""Violence dynamics"", ""Avoidance"" (usually the best option), ""Counter-ambush"", ""Breaking the freeze"" (the mental freeze before acting), ""The fight itself"", and ""The aftermath"". The slow motion training and parts of the fight practice sections were new to me and will be integrated into my training sessions.

It should be noted that even though this DVD is great on its own, you will get more out of it by reading the companion book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Facing-Violence-Preparing-for-the-Unexpected/dp/1594392137/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Facing Violence: Preparing for the Unexpected</a>, since it is referenced throughout the video.

5109977,5,B007TWKH50,"I watched this video with a group of people that was composed half of serious martial artists, and half of people who have never set foot in a dojo.  The discussion afterwards turned to whether the information in the video was stuff that every adult should know.  The overwhelming majority said yes.  Those who said no did so with the disclaimer that they felt they needed more of a martial arts background for the material to really appreciate the material.

The DVD is shot as though the viewer is taking part in one of his seminars, and there are several of Miller's long term students featured in the video.  Having taken a couple of his seminars I can say that this video comes fairly close to the experience.  The material is well organized into seven interrelated sections, each of which is clearly articulated and put into realistic and meaningful context.

Much of the material is not typically covered in most martial arts curricula and will open important paths of thought.  That said, the tone is clearly respectful of traditional martial arts.

The drawbacks are that this is really more of a companion to the book than a stand-alone product (and he refers to material in the book as topics that are covered in more depth), and that the background music is distracting.  As it is a two hour condensed version of a full day seminar there are some topics that are clearly underrepresented, but it is an excellent introduction to the topics regardless.

5109978,5,B007TWKH50,"Facing Violence Review

EXCELLENT! This should be mandatory viewing for all martial artists. Mr. Miller has put together a very succinct and knowledgeable format on the current state of violence in the United States, plus touching on the cultural and social norms of other countries. The drills were very good and I picked up a few new tricks for my students and me to play with. But, the MOST important parts of this video are the very first and the very last sections.
 Legal and Ethical Implications is worth the price of admission. We typically do not think about today's current laws, only what we have trained. This can be so wrong. A lot of our combat/family arts have been passed down to us from generations long ago with much different legal and social systems from the ones we live with today.
Aftermath should be like dessert, something to take in small bites so you can contemplate and savor each morsel. Mr. Miller's suggestions as to what to say and not say, how you will react, etc. is very important. The suggestion that nobody can tell you what is the right or wrong way to deal with the aftermath of a violent encounter is a necessary thought process. If the person with more initials after their name than they have in their name hasn't lived through what you just did, how can they truly understand?
Do you really know how you are going to cope with being involved in an act of extreme violence? If you are not sure or even think you're sure you should watch this video!",1338249600,2,1490,4.5353159851301115
5109979,5,B007TWKH50,"Facing Violence by Rory Miller demonstrates real-life scenarios where a person can get caught in a fight and the consequences that comes along with that. The DVD teaches how to defend oneself and more importantly how to try to avoid these situations.

Rory explains how knowing Martial Arts will not necessarily help in actual street or bar fighting. The explanation is simple that in practice, one learns to hold back in hitting someone. This might cause the person involved in a fight to automatically hold his strike. The essence of this is to not go into a fight merely because you are a trained martial artist.

He also explains the consequences in the aftermath of a fight where there may be legal or civil actions taken against you. This can become costly and even with legal charges pressed against you, even without being the instigator of the fight. Neither is a very good situation to find yourself.

Rory tells how actual events can happen anywhere, such as a bar, a school, in the street. This DVD demonstrates what could happen, how to react and how to survive both physically and legally.

I highly recommend this DVD for being informative, instructional and passing on good commons sense regarding street fighting. The seven chapters are clearly presented, have a lot of information and the demonstrations are very life-like.

This DVD is highly recommended for just about anyone's viewing with the admonition to practice avoidance more than anything else. If I could change anything it would be to edit out Rory's cursing because it becomes distracting.",1338163200,2,1570,4.9543726235741445

I consider myself a fringe martial artist - I know a few ""techniques"" but I respond on instinct.
