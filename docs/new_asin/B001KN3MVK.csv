8315457,5,B001KN3MVK,"I have been a fan of Shawn and MJ's for a long while now.  I heard about this short film on Youtube and made the call to get a copy.  I also believe in them as film makers.  They have a lot of talent and are just trying to express it.

Joe Frantz, Don, and Murph make special apperances in it as well.

It's even got extras which are cool to watch.  Shawn and MJ discuss their first taste for film making.  They also fill the fans in on some info on their lives.

Bottom line, support these guys.  They are the coolest duo around.  I can't wait to see what they have in store for us next.",1226966400,5,588,3.906779661016949
