3876686,5,B0029EW7BA,"I liked the 1st movie, this one was much better. Don't listen to most of these reviews. The majority of them are from failed or wannabe movie critics. People who couldn't make it in the real world,so they come to amazon to try and influence peoples buying decisions. This movie is worth the money.",1276646400,5,297,4.518518518518518
3876687,2,B0029EW7BA,"Yes, this movie has some thrills and chills...but nothing that you have not already seen before, and probably better.

My biggest issue is continutity. This film does not use it. It does not match the history presented from the first film. You will also notice it doesn't match itself throughout the film. The biggest blunder is when John's new neighbor drops by and gives Johna six pack of beer. I said six pack. It is stated that John does not drink. He drinks one can. Later, after a fight with his wife, he drinks a TON of beer on the porch, cans everywhere! How did the six pack multiply?

When the scarecrow is first discovered, it is barely recognizable as a human shape. It barely has legs. By the end of the film, it has feet and looks fat. The family tear it apart, and as they are tearing, you can see that it was barely a figure. I didn't know scarecrows could gain weight, lose it, gain it, lose it....

Overall, this seems like a script was written for a different movie, but was bought for the Messenger franchise and stretched to meet the needs of this horror line.

My reccomendation? Buy it used CHEAP, or rent it if you have time to waste. It's really not worth your investment otherwise.

3876688,2,B0029EW7BA,"In ""Messengers 2: The Scarecrow"" Norman Reedus plays a struggling farmer John Rollins. The water pump is broken. The crops are destroyed by crows. Just when things couldn't be worse, he finds an old scarecrow in the barn and puts it up in the field (while his son really dislikes the idea). That's when luck begins to come way. But John soon realizes that everything goes too well, especially when people suddenly start to drop dead in an inexplicable way.

The film (penned by Todd Farmer, ""Jason X"" and the 2009 remake of ""My Bloody Valentine"") begins promisingly with nice photography (shot in Bulgaria) and very good acting from Norman Reedus (The Boondock Saints) as a troubled husband of a beautiful wife Mary (Heather Stephens). Each character is given enough background history and in fact the film in the first half is convincing as a drama.

Somewhere in the middle, however, the story (that at first reminds us of one Stanley Kubrik film) starts to get clumsy, or even silly. As you expect, John Rollins sees things and hears voices - some real, some not - but none of them creates mystery or enhance dramatic tension. The film includes pretty graphic nudity (twice), in an attempt to show the psychological aspect of the hero (depressed sexuality or something?), when more subtle touch is needed. The worst is the incoherent and confusing climax that looks as if someone stepped in and changed the scenario.

""Messengers 2: The Scarecrow"" is supposed to be a prequel to the 2007 film ""The Messengers"" starring Kristen Stewart, who went on to be the star of the ""Twilight"" saga. You don't have to see the original if you want to see the ""prequel"" as the two stories do not directly connect to each other. Or will there be ""Messengers 3""? I hope not.

""Messengers 2: The Scarecrow"" is not a total disaster and avid fans of Norman Reedus shouldn't miss it. Still this one needs a better wrap-up and more coherent story.",1265500800,3,1928,4.729166666666667
3876689,3,B0029EW7BA,"THE MESSENGERS 2
THE SCARECROW

What do you do when a film is a series refuses to follow its own rules and come by a story already determined? That is a question I was asking my self after watching the second in ""The Messenger"" series, I don't know what they were thinking. Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert's Ghost House Pictures for the most part as been fun and entertaining and in fact this one is entertaining. The thing is it does not follow the same story as the first film even though this is a prequel.

The first film was about the family that moved in after the Rollins family, this one is about the Rollins. John who was Burwell in the first film is a struggling farmer who just wants to take care of his family and live a nice quiet life with them. Things are not going as planned as luck would have it since it seems his crops are not coming in. Add in the fact that he is not getting a break any where and his wife is still buddy buddy with an ex. He is getting offers to sell and a neighbor of his seems like a nice guy so he does have options and help, even if it is very little. One day he comes across a scarecrow inside a little room in his barn, and after putting it up things seem to turn around.

His crop starts to turn up growing very well and the money starts to come in but the banker who was pressuring him to sell comes up dead. Also the man who was hitting on his wife who is her ex or whatever also turns up missing. Each time the scarecrow seems to have played a part. This is all well and fine and plays into the horror thing well and makes you think if the scarecrow is doing this or if John is going crazy. As you go back and forth between the possibilities the story seems real entertaining and fun. Things go wrong when the film while obviously a prequel tries to distance itself from the original.

It is the exact same family from the beginning of the first film so obviously we know how they end. In this film though how do we get a happy ending, it just not make sense unless their ending happens later some how. Also the story moves along as if the scarecrow is just all in his head as he is actually committing the murders, but as you will see the thing comes to life some how. That would be fine if the first film would have had some crazed straw packed lunatic in it as well picking people off, also that does not explain the fate of this family in the first film. There are other things like how did the son know the scarecrow was evil and alive and what about all the other unexplained things that never pay off.

Now while there are other things this film does have some things going for it such as lead Norman Reedus who plays John Rollins. He plays the role well playing it as if he is loosing his mind much like the first but to a more extreme extent. Richard Riehle is excellent in this as is the woman who plays his cheating and seductive wife [who is in a good sex scene and nude scenes]. The banker guy was good in this but pretty much every one else just seemed average, not bad.

Writer Todd Farmer who was a writer on the first and director Martin Barnewitz are actually not to blame for the mishap that is this film. During the director/writer commentary which is actually one of the best I have listened to they talk about how the producers of this film basically said ""we know it is a prequel but we want a happy ending"" writer then follows with ""but the first one established what happens to the family"". The producers then replied with ""yeah we know but lets make this prequel a stand alone film with the family from the first, but still make it a prequel""

Well that all sounds interesting and to be honest it may have worked if they did not make the scarecrow come to life. They could have just had John going crazy and made it a psychological horror film. Even with a happy ending it could be assumed he never truly got over it and relapsed back into insanity at some point. That would have made more sense and made for a better movie. So the question is do I recommend this film, unfortunately yes. I say that because the average fan will most likely like this and all Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert fans will have to own this.",1256860800,,4179,4.145499383477189
3876690,1,B0029EW7BA,"I mean, really!  That field should just go off forever in every direction but it really looks like some nasty two acre garden.  Also, I realize that EVERY single movie now has to feature people who are younger than thirty since it's impossible to believe that anyone over the age of thirty could possibly contribute to society but I have a hard time believing that the wife is old enough to have given birth to that teenager (popped her out at the age of 14?  I guess...) and the sheriff is, oh, what do you think, maybe twenty?  Are there still sharecroppers?  If a nearby sharecropper decided to pull off her top and pour water all over her naked torso, do you think you would even be anywhere to actually see it, if your farm was at least one or two quarters large?  What?  There's nudity?  Yeah, a little bit, but not even enough to merit a rental, so maybe you ought to just go hang out by the local corn field, and one day, she'll come along.",1256342400,10,948,4.286516853932584
3876691,4,B0029EW7BA,"I liked the fact that it didn't show the scarecrow move and attack til the end of the movie b.c it questioned whether or not this movie was like the 1st Messengers where the guy goes insane at the end. But i thought it had great suspense and a good ""monster"". The first Messengers was good, but i liked this one better.",1251331200,3,319,4.161290322580645
3876692,4,B0029EW7BA,"Having watched the ""The Messengers,"" it wasn't hard for me to enjoy this sequel. The first one itself was really just a blend of ""The Grudge 1 and 2,"" ""Amityville Horror,"" and ""The Birds."" The combination made for an entertaining movie, not to mention having the now top-status actress Kristen Stewart as the main character.

The sequel, ""The Messengers 2: The Scarecrow,"" is a little different. It takes on the backstory that wasn't fully explained in the first of the why the man went nuts and murdered his family. It keeps the whole ""Amityville Horror"" feeling, but looses the whole Grudge feeling in favor of some ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" elements, save the Killer Scarecrow that will also remind people of The ""I know what you did last summer"" movies. All in all, it's another entertaining movie. No, it isn't original, but is very entertaining and interesting from start to finish.

Though, in the end, it is not 2/3 as good as the 1st. However, if you enjoyed the 1st, then this movie is worth seeing. I would've went for a 7/10 for this movie, but I opted for 4 instead of 3 stars in favor of trying to be as positive as possible when reviewing a movie. Reccomended for fans of the 1st or those looking for easy entertainment.",1250899200,7,1230,4.6118721461187215
3876693,1,B0029EW7BA,"Before you waste your time watching this movie, try watching the original ""Messengers I"" film. The original movie had a pretty good plot with a decent ending. More importantly, ""Messengers I"" was set up whereby the original family who first owned the house that was bought by the film's main characters had been murdered (don't worry, this shouldn't be a spoiler in terms of ruining the first film if you have never seen it). ""Messengers II"" is supposed to be a prequel that reveals the history of what happened to the original family who died in the house years before the current family of ""Messengers I"" ever moved in.

""Messengers II"" is mainly about a farmer named John Rollins, who was played by Norman Reedus. Reedus' overall performance as John was pretty good and I found his character to be quite relatable. The film, however, first appears to focus on his soon approaching psychological meltdown after struggling to keep his wife and family together, creating a productive crop when drought and crows destroy everything in sight, and retaining his house and land before it is seized.

Several clues hinting to John's mental deterioration are scattered throughout the film (strange people continually popping up who only he can see), especially with the introduction of a creepy scarecrow that John mysteriously discovers in his barn that continues to disappear and reappear after horrible things occur to the people with whom John interacts. Then after nearly two hours the plot unfolds and the ending answers none of the clues concerning his seemingly imaginary companions or his failing mental state, leaving the viewer confused and incredibly agitated at having spent so much time waiting for the plot to unravel. More importantly, the ending left me particularly confused as to how John Rollins' family ended up LIVING ""happily ever after"" when they clearly were supposed to be the DEAD Rollins family of the first movie ""Messengers I.""  Yes. I must say that the inexplicable discontinuity between the two films was my greatest disappointment. At the end of the day, I recommend viewers avoid this straight-to-DVD flick and just stick with the original film.",1249084800,20,2173,5.064245810055866
3876694,1,B0029EW7BA,"I like ""horror"" flicks.  I give a lot of leeway when it comes to rating horror movies.
In this case, there is nothing I can say to salvage one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

  Every aspect of this movie is terrible. From the script, to the actors, all the way down to the ridiculous FAKE corn stalks.  Enough said.",1248998400,4,320,4.180327868852459
3876695,2,B0029EW7BA,"In my movie watching experience, I've learned that it's usually important to watch an original film before its sequel. With this day and age though where sequels are actually prequels and we get prequel trilogies sixteen years AFTER the original trilogy, there aren't really any guidelines to follow  when it comes to watching films anymore. So being somebody who had no interest in seeing The Messengers, the sequel didn't really interest me until they announced Norman Reedus in the title role. Since Reedus had been impressive in films such as The Boondock Saints, Blade II, and even his brief (but rather incredible) cameo in Antibodies, I felt it was my obligation to at least give this film a chance. The results are pretty much what you'd expect for a direct to DVD horror film.

The acting isn't terrible, but doesn't really do much to stand out. Norman Reedus, Heather Stephens, and Richard Riehle are pretty much the cream of the crop as far as acting goes. Reedus does a good job of acting like a farmer who's going through troubled times and just wants to support his family. He was easy to relate to since just about everyone is either going through tough times or has so in the past. Stephens played the concerned wife and was able to portray the widest range of emotions in the film. Riehle always seemed to show up to encourage John Rollins to do mischievous things, so the seeds are planted from the get-go that something isn't quite right with him. The boy who played John's son, Michael, is the only actor in the film that could really be considered atrocious as his lines are delivered so nonchalantly.

The way the rest of the film plays out just feels like it borrowed heavily from Jeepers Creepers 2 and the Children of the Corn films. The scarecrow drags its scythe on the ground as it's stalking its victims, which was a nice touch but was really the only enjoyable part of the scarecrow. Once it reveals itself at the end of the film and starts walking around, it makes pterodactyl sounds and trust me, that's just as incredible as it sounds. The film actually starts going downhill in the second half, which is when the cheesy effects come in and unanswered questions begin. The latter half of the film is filled with a lot of moments that will leave you scratching your head wondering why you even decided to watch this film to begin with.

Messengers 2: The Scarecrow isn't exactly the greatest film to watch, but it isn't the worst either. While it does have its fair share of blood and isn't half bad at times, it doesn't really offer anything most horror fans haven't seen before. Messengers 2 is really only recommended for die hard fans of Norman Reedus since it's basically just a rehash of Jeepers Creepers 2 with a lower budget. It's the type of film that's a decent watch at 3 o' clock in the morning when you stumble across it channel surfing, but isn't worth deliberately tracking down on DVD.",1248134400,14,2933,4.6238003838771595

3876702,2,B0029EW7BA,"I love Norman Reedus in ""The Walking Dead."" Who doesn't? But he's just not a good enough reason to watch this film. The super freaky scarecrow is almost a good enough reason, provided you are also drinking while watching. However, said drinking may make the ho-hum moments scary enough to power through. I love horror movies with sinister cornfields (living in the Midwest I find cornfields disturbing), so I'll watch even bad ones, which most of them are anyway. This one is no exception. The cornfield had potential but the people ruined it. The characters are woefully underdeveloped, and their motivations are a mystery. It seems that Reedus' character is being possessed by...the cornfield? The scarecrow? It's anyone's guess. But just in case you get so frustrated you're ready to turn it off or really up your drinking, here comes a winsome blonde who inexplicably takes her clothes off in the cornfield (a very bad idea, let me tell you), while Reedus lurks nearby, spying on her through the cornstalks. That's not creepy at all. The family members are nothing but cookie cutter characters from central casting. A nagging worried wife. A cute worried teenage daughter. A psychic worried young son. You've seen it all before, and slept through it. If you have nothing else to do, watch ""Messengers 2: The Scarecrow."" The production values aren't bad. But it's all better with a drink.",1472342400,,1391,4.948717948717949

A true prequel would have the end of this film sequing seamlessly into ""The Messengers."" It does not even come close! The writers had an excellent opportunity to set the base for The Messengers mythology, and they end up with a confusing mish-mash of characters and black-magic and plot lines and soft-porn. I thought they would do a straight-forward tale of the father slowly unhinging something like ""The Shining"" due to some curse or ghosts inhabiting his farm land. Why film makers can't stick to a single plot line, or even a plot line with one sub-plot is beyond me. Maybe they have no confidence in their audience to even be able to maintain their attention on one or two plot lines..who knows.

**SPOILER** They also ended this movie on a happy note, when the whole premise of ""The Messengers"" is he slaughtered his entire family! How in the hell does that match up as a prequel!!??

His wife in the flick was simply a prude and I was actually hoping she would be a victim of the scarecrow just to get her to stop her incessant whining.  This ""prequel"" has very little to do with the first Messenger and leaves no cliffhanger for the second (first) Messenger.  As some reviewers already mentioned, the scarecrow creature started out in the movie as just that, a skinny, poorly put together scarecrow.  Toward the end when we really get to see him, he's two times as big and extraordinarly muscular.  He actually looked like a guy in a black body suit with grape vines tied around his arms.  Pretty poor.  Also, at the end, there's a dead body in the barn and the family just walks away, arm in arm as if everything is all over. What did they do with the body?  No hurry since the guy is already dead?  His police cruiser is still in the yard.  I might feel better about the ending had the second (first) Messenger picked up when the family called someone about the body in their barn, but it doesn't.

3876760,1,B0029EW7BA,"I didn't see the first Messengers movie and I wish I had skipped this one. The only thing that seemed appealing about it was Norman Reedus but the film was too disappointing for him to make an impact.

This movie is NOT scary whatsoever in fact its attempts to be frightening are comedic. The film is boring, slow and has absolutely no point. The writing seemed nonexistent and it's like the movie is being made up as it's filmed. The characters weren't well-developed at all and things that were put out there to enhance the plot never came to a head.

For example, John and his wife have obvious friction from the beginning of the movie but we never really know why. We can only guess it's because John can't properly support his family but then again we get the idea that John resents his wife for her capabilities in comparison to his. Why I can't comprehend because she didn't do anything but stay in the kitchen. So I can't see why he felt threatened by her. It's not like she was some career woman. Whatever the reason, it wasn't executed. We just see two wooden characters with a huge lack of chemistry going back and forth for no reason.

I saw no point of the daughter in the film and she looked older than the parents. The little boy was thrown in to do a cliche ""The Sixth Sense"" type role. That's another plot hole. Supposedly the son can see and hear things others can't but it's NOT followed up or executed. We never know why the son has these powers. Is it just so someone could warn John? We also never understand why it's important for him to have these powers when he only ""saw"" something once or twice. It made no sense.

The wife was useless. I would've much rather the film be with John as a single dad with his son because the daughter and wife were not needed.

John's hopping around the cornfield for 90 minutes was relentless and torturous. I kept waiting for something scary to happen but ended up dozing off every five minutes. I had to keep rewinding scenes because the film was so slow I couldn't stay awake! If a horror is putting you to sleep then something is wrong.

The only interesting character was the old guy with the young wife. The wife was just an excuse to have a lame sex scene. And let's not forget the ridiculous scene when the dead girl pops outta the cornfield. Yawn!

This film is a big fail. They had a lot of interesting things to work with but fell incredibly short. The plot was horrid but if the story and acting had been decent I could've overlooked it. Unfortunately everything sucked.

3876762,1,B0029EW7BA,"<strong>The Messengers 2: The Scarecrow</strong> (Martin Barnewitz, 2009)

By far the best thing about <em>The Messengers 2: The Scarecrow</em> is that it has absolutely nothing to do with the Pang Brothers film to which it is supposedly a sequel. Danish director Barnewitz, a Ghost House veteran (<em>Room 205</em>), and writer Todd Farmer, who wrote the original (how much input did he have here? Hard to tell), turn in something far less than we got with the first film.

The setup is similar: John Rollins (<em>The Boondock Saints</em>' Norman Reedus) is a down-on-his-luck farmer who's about to lose his farm. To add insult to injury, the guy from the bank who's supposed to take it from him (<em>The Grudge 3</em>'s Michael McCoy) is both an old friend of Rollins' and an old boyfriend of his wife Mary's (<em>Lost Highway</em>'s Heather Stephens). One day, while poking around in the barn, John finds a false wall, and when he breaks it open, he discovers an old scarecrow. He takes it out to put it up, but his son Michael (<em>X-Men: First Class</em>' Laurence Belcher) thinks it's evil and begs his father to burn it. On the other hand, Jude Weatherby (<em>Office Space</em>'s Richard Riehle) and Jude's seductive wife Miranda (<em>Bruce Almighty</em>'s Darcy Flowers) offer more level-headed advice: it's a scarecrow, what harm can it do to put it up? So John does, earning his son's mistrust, and the next morning, John walks out of the house and discovers every crow in the area is dead...

You know where this is going, and that is the movie's greatest failure; at no point does this movie ever attempt to surprise you. As soon as Jude shows up you know who he is. And the fact that a sixty-year-old farmer who looks like Richard Riehle is married to a twentysomething housewife who looks like Darcy Flowers pretty much telegraphs what her role is going to be in all this. The second Mary brings up John's previous drinking habit, you know he's going to fall off the wagon. Etc., etc. There are no surprises at all here.

This is even more distressing when IMDB trivia reports the whole Todd Farmer confusion: according to IMDB, this was actually supposed to be the script for the first one, but it was so extensively rewritten by Mark Wheaton that Farmer, for the first movie, was just credited with ""original story"". He should have left well enough alone; Wheaton's finished product was far superior to this. *",1312761600,,2426,4.824519230769231
3876763,2,B0029EW7BA,"Screenwriter Todd Farmer (My Bloody Valentine remake) who co-wrote The Messengers (2007), came up with the story for The Messengers 2: The Scarecrow (2009), where the supernatural powers of a scarecrow, changes the fortunes of a struggling farmer.  Besides being set on a farm, The Messengers 2 has very little in common with the previous film.  The plot is somewhat unoriginal, but the serviceable special effects and steadily paced action, helps make for a mildly entertaining watch.

Things are desperate for farmer John Rollins (Norman Reedus), as his farm is close to going into foreclosure, his credit has run out, and his corn crop is in danger of failing.  Things are a little shaky at home between his wife Mary (Heather Stephens), and his two kids.  He needs a loan to get his irrigation system going, and the crows are ruining what meager crop he has been able to produce.  His situation changes dramatically, when he finds an old scarecrow hidden in his barn, and ignoring the advice of his son who tells him to get rid of it, puts it up in his cornfield.

Rollins is soon cleaning up a slew of dead crows that have mysteriously dropped dead in his cornfield.  Then his broken sprinkler system mysteriously begins to work, when the wife (Darcy Flowers) of his new neighbor Jude Weatherby (Richard Riehle) happens by.  Matters turn darker, when an unscrupulous banker is mysteriously killed, while planting foreclosure signs on his farm, and Rollins later discovers the dead man's cash and watch near the scarecrow.

While his crops continue to improve, Rollins finds his personal life beginning to fall apart.  When a friend of his wife Mary mysteriously commits suicide, Rollins finds the man's ring in his field hanging on an ear of corn.  Mary quite understandably finds his explanation of how he acquired the ring, very hard to swallow.  Rollins assumes that the scarecrow is responsible, and turns to the law for help, after his efforts to get rid of it fail.  From there, matters progress rather quickly, as the scarecrow comes to life threatening the entire Rollins family.

A direct to video release, The Messengers 2: The Scarecrow has virtually no connection to the first film.  It isn't particularly original or exciting, and tries to makes do mostly by blaming weird events on a scarecrow.  When the straw-filled scarecrow comes to life, it's more funny than scary.  If you don't expect too much, the silly story with supernatural elements holds together well enough to be mildly engaging.  The acting is passable, there is very little gore, and aside from some brief nudity, the film is mostly in PG-13 territory.  If you are interested, you might check the Sy Fy Channel, where it typically plays with The Messengers.",1306195200,,2743,4.908893709327549
