5424582,5,B00AGMTA62,"Having reviewed these New Year Concerts ever since 2000, I'll choose to mention mainly new features this year, rather than repeat the same adulatory comments.

Brief items by Wagner and Verdi are included, not only because it is the 200th anniversary of their birth but also because they each had a great admiration for Johannn Strauss Jnr, the waltz king.  Another of his admirers was Franz von Supp whose ""Leichte Kavallerie"" Overture is also included.  There are also several ""first timer"" Strauss Family items.  And watch to see what cuddly toys are handed out to some of the orchestra's leading players during an item by Johann Strauss, the Father.  The waltz king himself conducted his own compositions in this magnificent hall, looking just as dapper by all accounts as this year's conductor Franz Welser-Mst.  Welser-Mst even allows the cameras to follow him into the wings when he departs the podium, so we can see what restorative treatments conductors receive between appearances.

Ever modest and generous, the waltz king once said, ""I might be the most popular Strauss brother but Pepi (Josef) was the most talented"".  Judge for yourself as you hear two of their best waltzes: Josef's ""Sphrenklnge"" and Johann's lovely ""Wo die Citronnen blh'n"".

Finally, providing a link to the Strauss Dynasty we see in the audience a great-granddaughter of Josef  Strauss, after the playing of ""Plappermaulchen"" (Chatterbox), an item he dedicated to his little daughter Karoline Anna.",1357603200,9,1483,5.167364016736402
5424583,1,B00AGMTA62,I have been buying a DVD of each one of these end-of-year concerts produced by the Vienna Philharmonic. So far every DVD has been rather different than the watered down 90 minutes we get on NPR with Julie Andrews. In comparison the DVD has exactly what was played during the concert while the NPR concert is heavily edited for some reason. The DVDs are always far superior than what is shown on NPR while they are asking fo $$$ (contributions). Thank you for reading this.,1357171200,6,472,4.564705882352941

The dance sequences are in the ""extra features"" and there is a very nice short film featuring Austrian landscapes and some small groups from the orchestra performing some fun music.",1360368000,6,435,4.481012658227848
5424602,3,B00AGMTA62,"I've been a committed viewer of the Vienna Philharmonic New Year's Day concerts since the early 1980s, when Lorin Maazel took over the duties from Willi Boskovsky, leading the concert in consecutive years as conductor and occasional violin soloist.

There have been many memorable New Year's Day concerts over the decades: those led by Maazel, Karajan, Kleiber, Prtre, Mehta, Muti and Abbado, for example. Even Ozawa's single star turn in 2002 was surprisingly enjoyable. There was always a feeling of anticipation with the approach of this concert, and for the most part, it delivered the goods, most notably when conductors one might consider to be a bit staid in their typical stage demeanor let their hair down and joined in this traditional lighthearted welcome of the new year.

Recent years have been less consistent in delivering an event that can be called truly memorable, especially in regards to the quality of the music making on display. In fact, I count more than a few of the recent concerts to be failures: both of Harnoncourt's appearances (2001 & 2003) and Barenboim's cheerlessly pedantic appearance in 2009. Mixed in with the ""not so much"" concerts given in the first decade of the new century was a stellar first appearance by Georges Prtre in 2008, followed by his still-enjoyable but less-stellar follow-up in 2010, and Mariss Jansons' two appearances in 2006 & 2012.

Franz Welser-Mst (FWM) made his first appearance at this concert back in 2011, a concert in which I felt he acquitted himself well. He's a native Austrian and the current head of the Vienna State Opera, ie: the kind of person one would assume is to the manner born. Alas, FWM's reappearance in 2013 is a decided come down from the promise he displayed but two years ago.

On the one hand, FWM is to some extent held hostage to the repertoire selected for this concert. Fully eleven of the twenty pieces played on this concert receive their NYD concert premieres. That happens because the concert has been programmed to salute the 90th birthday of Hedwig-Aigner Strauss (who was in attendance at this concert), by featuring music of her great-grandfather, Josef Strauss, and by including works of Richard Wagner and Giuseppe Verdi, both of who were born in 1813, and who are having the 200th anniversaries of their births celebrated in the music world. This leads to a bit of a hodgepodge of music that might not otherwise feature so prominently on this concert, ie: fewer warhorses/chestnuts and more obscure repertoire. It also puts a lot of pressure on the performers to deliver the goods to the audience - it's always a bit harder to sell a ""new"" piece to an audience that is expecting to hear many of the old favorites.

I can see the Josef/Richard/Giuseppe concept working in theory: pulling off such a repertoire mix would be child's play in the hands of a Mehta or a Maazel. But FWM is not either of those conductors, and his best effort here falls short in making the case for these new arrivals. They are given straight-forward performances that - to me - aren't much better than highly competent run through-s. It's almost as if FWM is a second-string conductor who has prepared the orchestra for the star conductor - who then fails to show for the concert, and which results in the second-stringer being shoved out on the stage, with fingers crossed that somehow the traditional magic will just happen.

It doesn't.

Lest I imply that this concert fails due solely to the unusual repertoire, I'm sorry to report that that's not the worst of it. The biggest disappointment comes when FWM tries his hand at the few warhorses that are included on this concert. It starts off with a rendition of ""Music of the Spheres"" (Sphrenklge) that is blanched to an interpretive white when set alongside Muti's expressive 2004 version, let alone Karajan's colorful and nostalgic version from 1987, which is in a class of its own. It doesn't fare much better when considered against the virtuosic interpretation of Carlos Kleiber from 1992. FWM is careful to a fault in this piece, missing any feeling of echt-Viennese nostalgia that is always coupled with a sense of sadness.

The same goes for FWM's interpretation of ""Where the Lemon Trees Blossom"" - a piece that drips heavily of nostalgia mixed with a feeling of regret, if not remorse. In FWM's hands, it's a well-played (if cautious) laying out of the notes that seems to betray a conductor who maybe hasn't yet suffered enough in this life to bring an experienced perspective to his music making.

But the worst misfire occurs via a big helping of forced humor that falls absolutely flat in Strauss Father's ""Carnival of Venice,"" where FWM's handing out of stuffed animals to the orchestral soloists comes off as a contrived moment of conductor and orchestra ""just bein' regular guys."" This is the kind of staged, too-cute-by-half, wince-inducing ""humor"" that reinforces the idea that classical music is entirely disconnected from normal human experience. You know - like when you feel the obligation to laugh at the stale jokes being told by your rich uncle. Surely, classical music can do better than this embarrassing substitute for actual humor!

In the encore section of the concert, we're offered a ""Blue Danube"" minus many of its internal repeats (which makes for a Blue Danube dispatched in record time), and a Radetzky March on automatic pilot, save for a few ineffective accelerandi that crop up when they're not needed.

One of FWM's glaring faults in this repertoire is that he lets the energy sag in the transitional bars of the longer pieces, pieces that feature many different sections built on new themes (""Music of the Spheres"" is the best example). In the best hands, these transitional bars have a frisson that makes one excitedly anticipate the next big section in the composition. In FWM's hands, these transitional bars fall flat - they feel like a vamp, rather than a wind-up to the coming pitch.

Another problem I notice is a lack of unanimity in the string playing. Listen closely enough and you'll occasionally hear the sound of one violin sticking out from the rest of the section. It's a small thing, but it serves to testify that the orchestra isn't playing in the kind of ""zone"" they do under the best conductors, when everyone is of the same mind, and is being swept along by the vision of the conductor. It's the kind of high-level musical nuance that only gets noticed by its absence.

As far as production values, the BluRay's HD picture and camera work are excellent, while the soundtrack lacks bloom, though it seems to get better as the concert proceeds.

I had high hopes for this concert after FWM's 2011 appearance, but this concert was quite disappointing. It's average, at best. Considering my disappointment in both FWM and Harnoncourt in this concert, I'm starting to wonder if perhaps this concert is best kept away from being entrusted to the natives.

I'm hoping that this concert gets back on track over the next few years, though the fact that Daniel Barenboim has been announced as conductor for the 2014 affair doesn't bode well for that hope being realized any time soon. I get that many of the star conductors of this event are well past their sell-by date, but there has to be *somebody* out there who can restore the excitement and sense of event this concert has always delivered in strictly musical terms. Perhaps Vienna should simply alternate Prtre and Jansons for the next six years and hope someone new comes along who warrants an invitation.

Recommended only for completists like me, VPO junkies and the FWM fan club.

Two-and-a-half stars.",1360108800,9,7650,4.863287250384024
5424603,5,B00AGMTA62,"This is one of the long series of New Year's Day concerts from Vienna and features the conducting of Franz Welser-Most for the second time. This may not come as too much of a surprise as Welser-Most's Viennese credentials have been recognised and supported by a major bank in Upper Austria for over 25 years as a cultural envoy for upper Austria. This level of commitment to Welser-Most is more than justified by this particular release.

There is an unusual number of first performances in this year's concert, partly to do with the 2013 anniversary celebrations of Wagner and Verdi's bicentenaries. As a result we hear Wagner's Lohengrin Prelude to Act 3 and Verdi's Act 3 ballet music from Don Carlo. In addition there are other references such as J. Strauss II's Melodies Quadrille based on Verdian themes.

Another emphasis in this year's concert is the music of Josef Strauss with seven of his works of which five receive dbut performances at these concerts. His popular Music of the Spheres waltz is included and is a reminder of his own qualities as a composer of Viennese music. One extra link with Josef Strauss was the presence of his great-granddaughter whose 90th birthday took place the previous July and who was briefly identified on film, clearly enjoying the concert.

Hellmesberger II and Lanner, both important figures in the Viennese musical world, are included too and the concert includes Suppe's Light Cavalry overture, last heard here in a gripping performance with Muti very much in charge. Welser-Most takes a more genial view which fits in with his whole approach to the concert.

Geniality is a strong feature of the Carnival of Venice Fantasy by J. Strauss I which allows individual members and sections of the orchestra to be highlighted as the piece progresses. Once again, this is not the first time it has been played in recent memory with the last performance being conducted by Pretre in 2010. On this occasion each of the highlighted members receives a gift, mostly in the form of a soft toy which goes down very well with the audience and the orchestra. Welser-Most is presented with a chef's hat as befits his role as chief chef.

The concert then rapidly reaches the end with the traditional New year's greeting, the Blue Danube and the Radetzky March which is started with a particularly energetic and enthusiastic side-drummer. The audience clap very well and show considerable appreciation at the end.

The camera work has some remarkable shots from high up and which make use of phenomenal zoom capabilities of the lenses to cover all sorts of angles and views within the hall. This avoids rapid changes of cameras and inter-cutting and is a considerable technical advance. The imaging is especially crisp and with excellent colour. Attractive and short sequences of Austrian images are cut into the footage of the concert during some items. The sound is of an equally high standard and is presented in DTS 5.1 surround and stereo.

There are several bonuses including the ballet sequences which follow the usual pattern of mini-stories of dance-based romantic situations. There is also the option to watch the concert items previously shown with Austrian images seen as by the audience and therefore without the Austrian scenes. There is also a 24 minute feature called 'Honeymoon' which follows a newly married couple, attractively acted, touring round various Austrian venues. This is really a travelogue set to music largely played by sub-groups from the orchestra. All the venues, the music and the performers are sub-titled which makes the film far more informative than some previous films of this type. Once more, the photography is outstanding both artistically and technically.

I would suggest that this disc continues the fine standards of previous issues and surpasses some. As such it deserves to be considered seriously both as an 'only' purchase or one of a sequence for committed collectors.",1360022400,16,3951,5.021374045801527
