5228850,4,B0090W3B6E,"In Adventures of Bailey Christmas Hero the beloved Bailey is up to his antics and mischief once again as the Baker Household gets ready for Christmas. Bailey, the cute pooch, is worried that he won't get any presents from Santa because he has been a bad dog. He is told of a mysterious Indian chief that will answer his questions and make his wishes come true. With visions of tennis balls, dog bones and squeaky toys dancing in his head, he sets off with his brother Duke on an adventure to find this Indian chief. However, his pursuits get in the way of the Baker Family plans. Will this doggy ever learn the true meaning of Christmas?

This family friendly live action film is sure to help you get into the spirit of Christmas. We loved the cute ""tail"" and the message that it had. I am glad to be able to add it to my collection of Christmas movies. I have to admit I am a sucker for cute animal movies. I am also very fond of dogs myself and my kids enjoyed the movie very much. If you love dogs and would love to get into the true spirit of Christmas with your family, this movie might be right up your alley.

5228851,1,B0090W3B6E,"The makers try and jump on the success train of the ""Buddies"" franchise and fail utterly. Terrible sound, editing, production quality and acting. Virtually unwatchable. Yet it costs more than most big-budget DVDs. The only thing your eyes will be able to stand watching are the numerous shots of dogs panting (with unimaginative dialogue added for them later). Even our two year old wanted to turn this show off halfway through.",1356393600,,428,5.042253521126761
5228852,5,B0090W3B6E,"I am going to order several more copies of this movie, because the movie has a lot of quality
meaning for kids. I will be using it to give away to other kids,plus all of my grandchildren.
BAILEY, is such a cute dog and such a delight to watch.
The kids will learn a lot when they watch it and I hope that they will share it with their friends.
I have really enjoyed the song in the movie too"",I WISH EVERYDAY WAS CHRISTMAS"".
Great song and Congratulations to GARY DAVIS who wrote and sang the song in the movie.

MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL & A HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!MAMA JEAN",1354406400,,566,4.1454545454545455
5228853,5,B0090W3B6E,Bailey discovers the true meaning of Christmas and delivers a beautiful message of selflessness to young and old. The acting was very good and the dogs were precious once again. This movie really puts you in the Christmas spirit. Watching this movie will become an annual tradition in our family.,1353715200,3,296,4.94
5228854,5,B0090W3B6E,A great clean family film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.  Parents can feel at ease letting their young ones watch this movie.  It carries a great message of love and selflessness.  One young boy never gives up hope of finding his lost dogs before Christmas.  Choke full of funny moments and tender ones too.  If you like Christmas movies than this one will be a keeper to watch every year at this time.  If you like animals then you will want to watch it all year long.,1353283200,6,481,4.230769230769231
5228855,5,B0090W3B6E,"What a wonderful Christmas movie for the whole family! I believe it is something both children and adults will enjoy. And it has the neatest story - so moving, so positive and so heartfelt. I really loved this movie! It put me in the holiday spirit, and my two children (a boy and a girl, ages 6 and 10) had the best time watching it. It was also nice to see a Christmas movie with a deeper meaning, as opposed to one of those stereotypical, somewhat superficial Christmas movies.

My kids were actually crazy about the first one, ""Adventures of Bailey - The Lost Puppy."" (That movie was definitely geared toward a younger audience, but I have to admit, I ended up liking it, too.) So when we saw the second Bailey movie had come out, we had to get it. And I have to tell you, I was elated when my kids liked this one as much as the first one, if not more. I was also so impressed with the movie, I went online to order some copies as gifts, and that's when I decided I should post a review. I don't want to give away the story, and I do not want to spend time detailing the plot. I just want to take the time to point out some of the things my kids (and I) liked about this movie.

They thought it was cool to see Bailey as he has grown from a puppy to a dog, and they loved being part of his new adventure. His brother, Duke, accompanied Bailey this time, which really added to the fun. We're dog lovers at our house, and we feel like our dogs are members of our family. So it's not that difficult for us to buy into the dogs being main characters and talking and doing all these things. Besides that's the fun of it! And I actually prefer the dogs' mouths don't move - it can look so fake. My kids are fine with it, too. Unlike the first Bailey film, the family is an integral part of the movie, and I think the human and dog stories blended together really well. It kind of reminded me of the Disney film, ""Homeward Bound,"" which I loved.

If you love Christmas and you love dogs, it's a must see! It has both entertainment value and an incredible message. It flowed really well (my kids were never bored -- neither was I, for that matter), the acting was solid, the scenery and all the Christmas lights and decorations were great, and the dogs were awesome. It's simply a beautiful, little film.",1352073600,12,2300,4.187358916478555

No need to have the remote in hand when the children are watching, there is nothing that will cause you to change the channel.  Good clean family movie.",1418342400,,314,4.344827586206897
