8159619,5,B000KYOCO6,"I bought this some time back, I use to do some trapping years ago. I used my chevy 4x4 instead of a dogsled. This movie kind of
touches base with the way times use to be, and still are in places like Alaska.",1448755200,,207,3.8372093023255816
8159620,5,B000KYOCO6,"The film came in a little cardboard case, wish I could read the credits, look at more info.....but I knew that prior to purchase.  Thank you for selling this awesome film to me.  We have enjoyed watching it!!!",1368057600,,209,4.473684210526316
8159621,5,B000KYOCO6,"Beautiful wilderness, stunning photography, Leonard Cohen songs plus evocative original music, and dogs. What more could you want? How wonderful to be able to live so close to, and part of, nature. The human race has so lost its way, and this movie reminds us of the beauty of this planet, and the harshness too. The dialogue is not its strongest point, but who cares? I'd like to have seen it in the original French.",1344988800,,417,4.573333333333333
8159622,5,B000KYOCO6,"When I first saw the Last Trapper, I loved it. When I went back to the Video store, they no longer had it, so I e-mailed Amazon and requested that they send me the DVD. In a very short time, the DVD arrived and I got to enjoy my show again and also show it to my family and friends. It is a very gritty description of life in the Yukon.",1330214400,,336,3.7464788732394365
8159623,4,B000KYOCO6,A docudrama. Slow moving but still entertaining. I watch it every year. What a great life Norm has had and a fine woman to enjoy it with.,1302998400,,137,4.111111111111111
8159624,5,B000KYOCO6,"I think this DVD is worth buying just for the spectacular scenery and photography.  It is nothing short of stunning the way they could make what would seem to be a hostile and barren part of the continent look beautiful.  There are many sub-artic animals and birds shown, so it is partly a wildlife documentary as well.  Finally, for many kids raised in the city, this offers a wonderful glimpse into a totally different way of life.

For me, watching this docudrama brought me back to when my family lived out in the bush.  Back in the early 1970s I was called to lead a conference of a small group of boy's leaders in Northern British Columbia.  The morning of the day I arrived, the temperature dropped to 57 degrees below zero (F)!  [My wife and I camped out that night closer to the coast, near Prince Rupert, so the temperature where we slept was a down-right 'toasty' 10-below!]

  A couple of days later, on Saturday, the men wanted to take me back to see the summer camp they were building for the boys.  It was a crystal clear day, no wind, and simply as beautiful (and similar to) as the scenes in this movie.  They took snomobiles with sleighs to haul our stuff back some ten to fifteen miles into the raw wilderness.  For lunch, we built a fire and roasted hot dogs.  The high temperature for the day was minus-35 degrees!  So, when this movie shows the trapper camping at temperatures of forty-below, it not only just seems believable, it really happens.

I lived for four years one mile from the Continental Divide in the Canadian Rockies.  We had all the animals shown in this movie in our area.  People from all over the world came to camp in a public campground only a 'stones throw' from our house.  Those people were fortunate enough to travel to the wilderness to experience it first hand.  Until your family can make the same trip, this movie is an excellent way to vicariously experience life in the Canadian Wilderness.",1199059200,4,1943,4.528735632183908
8159625,4,B000KYOCO6,"The film is exremely motivating.  Part documentary, with several scenes re-enacted in Norman's life, it left me wishing I could be in those places and experience the beauty of it.  Modern urban life has become so detached from nature that most people have lost all sense of contact with it.  I've heard criticism of the actors in a couple of reviews.  These people don't seem to realize they are not actors! they are playing themselves and doing their best to get the point across and display their way of life.  I highly recommend this film.",1165708800,9,542,4.663157894736842
