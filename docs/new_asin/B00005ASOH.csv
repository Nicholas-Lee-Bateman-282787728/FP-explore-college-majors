DVD`s has a fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) Transfer and clear Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono Sound. This has fine running commentary track by director:Steve Miner (Friday the 13th Part 2 & 3, Forever Young), Writer:Ethan Wiley (House 2:The Second Story), Producer:Sean S. Cunningham (Friday the 13th, Jason Goes to Hell:The Final Friday) and Actor:William Katt (Carrie). House was an box office surprise back in 1986. This film has an good tongue in cheek humor and it`s unexpectedly impressive, imaginative and ambitious black comedy for a horror movie. Entertaining film. Grade:A-  25 years ago, Jesse (Arye Gross) parents has been murder by a mystery man. He returns to the house, where his parents were murder with his girlfriend (Lar Park Lincoln) and then his friends Charlie (Johathan Stark) and his girlfriend (Amy Yasbeck) are moving in the house also. Jesse discover, there`s something missing in the house and he find out a missing skull, which it`s worth money. Jesse & Charlie discover the skull could be bury in the cementary of Jesse`s great great grandfather named also Jesse (Royal Dano). Once they dig up his grave, Jesse & Charlie find out his still alive, because of the magical skull. Once Jesse & Charlie bring Jesse`s great great grandfather back to the house. Everything is starting to break loose another people from different dimensions of time, want to take the skull back in thier time. The three have to protect the skull from anothers.
DVD`s has the same Widescreen anamorphic transfer and the sound also for the film. There`s an amusing commentary track from the director:Ethan Wiley and Producer:Sean S. Cunningham. Which is much better in the commentary than the first film. This is well made entertaining film has nothing to do with the first film. Great fun. Grade:B+.",1004400000,,2250,4.921052631578948
1417328,5,B00005ASOH,"I love House.  It was the very first horror movie I ever watched.  I watched it for the first time with family that are no longer here.  So it is in some ways a show very near and dear to my heart.  This Dvd version is great.  It is the clearest version of House that I have ever seen.  It sounds great.  And it has the most hillarious commentary.  I spent all day yesterday watching House 1 and 2 and then listening to their commentaries.  Both Dvd's had the producers commentaries.  Im not as big a fan of House 2 as I am of 1.  But its a free add on so Ill take it.  But you can see how House 1 can be both scary and funny by listening to the people that made it.  Funny guys.  William Katt the star is on the commentary too.  Great shows, good price, Must buy in my opinion.",1002067200,,778,3.8974358974358974
1417329,3,B00005ASOH,"Perhaps one of the quintessential 1980s horror films, House makes its explosion onto the DVD format in this (relatively unadvertised) Anchor Bay Special/Limited Edition disc.  The digital gurus at Anchor Bay's studios have given us another finely restored film, and the first 20,000 DVDs produced are actual limited editions with a bonus DVD that contains a restored House II: The Second Story.  Fans, be speedy: these two-disc sets aren't going to last long, and this is House II's ONLY anticipated Region 1 release on DVD, ever.  Once it's gone, it's gone.
But, is the 2 disc set even worth getting?  House tells the story of Vietnam vet and writer Roger Cobb (William Katt) who, looking for solitude and a break from his ex-wife (Kay Lenz), decides to move into his aunt's old house after she commits suicide.  Coincidentally, this is the same house where Cobb's son disappeared a couple of years ago - apparently one of the deciding factors in the divorce, and Cobb's current writing slump.  After he checks in, all manner of strange things happen, from Vietnam flashbacks to ghostly goings-on.
As a horror film, House certainly holds its own against more serious slasher-fare.  Like Sam Raimi's Evil Dead, House doesn't take itself as seriously as other movies in the genre, and the result is an oftentimes humorous piece of work (unintentionally or not).  The horror elements are strong: you are never completely sure if the house is actually causing the events, or if the main character is slowly going insane.  Unfortunately, the story is so disjointed that the main creep value is lost when baddies are revealed too early, and the final sequence turns into an action movie instead of a horror film.  While farces aren't intended to be subtle, the subtle, layered effect created in the first 20 minutes is utterly ruined as soon as we see the monster, and from there on out everything either becomes more stereotypical 80s horror fare, or the comic version of the same.  This problem doesn't render House unwatchable, but it certainly detracts, as if the director couldn't quite make up his mind about what way he wanted the movie to go.
The DVD, on the other hand, is fantastic.  The sound, while in mono, is clear and crisp, and the video transfer is remarkable (although anything less from Anchor Bay would be a crime).  The commentary track is loads of fun, and a 12-minute featurette on The Making of House provides a little historical context and amusement, too.  Luckily, Anchor Bay didn't spare the bonus House II disc any of their normal bells and whistles, and again the sound (mono as well) is great along with the near-flawless video.  The bonus disc also contains a full-length commentary which isn't nearly as entertaining as the other, but hey, neither is the movie.  Fans of House (and House II, if anyone is willing to admit to it) will definitely want to get the Limited Edition as soon as possible, because House II is going to be gone for good once it sells out.  Otherwise, if you liked House, and know what to expect from Anchor Bay, you know what to do - and at this price, it's hard not to.",996969600,,3122,4.76252319109462
1417330,5,B00005ASOH,"I was so happy to find out that ""House"" was finally coming to DVD.  This is one of my all time favorite horror movies.  In fact, this was the very first horror movie I ever saw when I was little.
William Katt plays a writer who is stuggling on a current project.  When his aunt passes away, he decides to move into her house, being that it was the same house that he grew up in.  It was also the house he lost his little boy in.  He's about to find out that moving into the house was a BIG mistake.
Katt realizes the house is haunted and is trying to kill him, sending monsters, ghouls, and killer household applainces after him.  But Katt isn't going to surrender that easily.  He decides to take the house head on, and hopes to find his lost son.
The picture quality of the movie is fantastic.  I did not expect to see so much sharpness and color from such an old film.  The sound is also great, even though it's dolby digital mono.  It sure doesn't sound mono!
""House"" is a classic horror film, and is one of my favorites.  Forget about ""Scream"" and all of those other horror flicks.  This is an all time classic, and is a must have for anyone who enjoys scary films.  Filled with horror and comedy, ""House"" is an easy five out of five stars.",995328000,4,1245,4.180672268907563
1417331,5,B00005ASOH,"Steve Miner's House has always been an underrated, underlooked little film.  Although not your average 'haunted house' film, there's plenty of jumps and laughs to be had here. House perhaps isn't the scariest movie around (okay, not even close), but the intent here is not to shock, if you're looking to be entertained for 90 minutes with some wildly funny special effects, a smirking sense of humor and several great performances, look no further than this little winner from 1985.
William Katt plays bestselling author Roger Cobb, a writer whose made a living penning gruesome horror novels.  It seems however, of late, Roger has fallen on hard times.  His son was kidnapped right out of his backyard one afternoon, he and his wife (Kay Lenz) are divorced and Cobb has developed quite a case of writers' block.  He's been struggling to get his latest novel written, a story about his personal experiences in Vietnam.  He's got a rapidly approaching deadline to meet and to top it all off, his elderly aunt has committed suicide leaving Cobb to inherit the big, spooky home in which she lived.
The house, as it is, is the same home where Cobb's son was abducted from years ago, despite warnings from his aunt claiming the house alive and the culprit behind the abduction, Cobb never took these 'ramblings' very seriously-until now.
To combat his demons and get his book written, Roger moves into the house and immediately, strange things begin to happen.  He's attacked by garden tools, there's a creature living in an upstairs closet, a big, purple witch running about and demon children living in the chimney-and this doesn't begin to scratch the surface!  To top it all off, Roger's nosy neighbor (George Wendt of Cheers fame) thinks he's gone insane and keeps a watchful (and comical) eye on him.
House is a horror movie, but it's one that will make you laugh more than scream.  It contains a few jumps, but overall, is none too scary.  Where House is strongest perhaps, is in its portrayal of its main character.  Roger Cobb is a fully fleshed out character haunted by demons of his past while frantically attempting to bury them.  It's not until the evils of the house force him to confront his past demons that Roger can begin, once again to assume control of his life.  While House is a horror film, it's also a well written (by Fred Dekker-helmer of Night of the Creeps-what happened to this man?) story of a man obsessed with finding his missing child.
House may not be everybody's cup of tea, there are moments which some viewers may find just too silly, others may find it rather dull and too 'dated'.  Genre fans and overall movie goers with an appreciation for a well-written film won't want to miss this film.  A nice place to visit, a great film to own on DVD!
-For the record, the DVD transfer is beautiful, and the first 20,000 copies include House II:  The Second Story which, is also a great film.",995328000,5,2918,4.694117647058824
1417332,5,B00005ASOH,"I loved seeing this movie when I was younger.  Very campy, funny and at times scary.  ....This DVD was a pleasant surprise.  I stumbled across the fact that it was being released and pre-ordered it without knowing anything about the features that were to be included.  I received the DVD and noticed a sticker on the front that said: 20,000 copies will also have House 2: The Second Story included as a bonus.  Nothing else on the jacket/clamshell mentioned it.  I opened the wrapper and looked inside...low and behold.  They secretly stored two seperate DVDs in there, one for each movie.  It's not promoted anywhere.

1417333,3,B00005ASOH,"Remember when you first got cable?  Our connection opened a whole world to me.  A world populated by Killer Clowns from Outer Space and Canabilistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers who lived in Funhouses at Camp Crystal Lake. Late at night I would sneak out into the den at the back of the house and watch those movies that my parents swore would scar me for life with the sound turned down low enough so that I wouldn't be discovered.  This was one of those flicks that got my alarm set for 2am. I haven't seen either of the House movies in a long while but remember watching them with a fondness that ""normal"" folks would probably relate to The Wizard of Oz on Thanksgiving every year.  Popcorn in a crinkley plastic bag that made too much noise and was covered in orange powder that at the time I assumed was some sort of cheese-like substanceaccompanied by a 2 liter of Jolt soda so I wouldn't fall asleep and be discovered the next morning.  That's how you have to watch these movies.  Late at night, all alone, with the sound turned way down surrounded by junk food hoping you don't get caught.  The plot wasn't important then and isn't important now.  It made no sense anyway.  What makes this movie enjoyable is the absurd black comedy:  The corpses that just won't die no matter what you do to them, The portals that open up without rhyme or reason, the unbelievable bad timing of the neighbors and the jungles of Vietnam that lead to a swimming pool in the back yard.  It's disjointed, absurd and an absolute waste of time, (not unlike this review) but I wouldn't want this movie any other way.",992908800,5,1602,4.489655172413793

and Directed by Steve miner
very funny comedy Horror, even the special effects make-up is silly
William Katt plays a Writer of Novels, Horror novels
who inherits a big Mansion from his Grandmother
the Mansion happens to be Haunted with Evil spirits
but the way the film is Directed makes the scary scenes look Hilarious

this Anchor bay version released back in 2002 which is still available to buy from amazon
is the best version to get
5.1 Digital dolby audio and picture is in perfect widescreen format
there's an audio commentary by Sean cunningham who talks about the making of the film
and there's also behind the scenes footage from 1984
there's stills Gallery, and Trailer, that's about it

this House film was re-issued two years ago by Midnight madness
Midnight madness version is terrible, there's no extras at all, just bare bones
so just buy this Anchor bay release it's still available to buy and worth the cash for sure
and until anchor bay releases it on blu-ray
this anchor bay release will have to do",1388707200,,1095,4.727748691099476
1417423,4,B00005ASOH,"Roger Cobb (William Katt) is a successful horror novelist who has recently gone through turmoil, and is looking for some solitude to write his next book.  Roger's beautiful TV star wife, Sandy (Kay Lenz), has divorced him.  Roger is a Vietnam Vet attempting to come to grips with his past in the jungle.  Roger and Sandy's young child, Jimmy, disappeared months ago, and is now a cold case.

In the meantime, Roger's Aunt Elizabeth has left her house to him after hanging herself inside.  She always believed it was haunted.  It was also the last place Roger saw Jimmy alive.  What better place for a writer's retreat?

So begins the scary funhouse movie ride. It is funny and maybe a bit tame for today's horror fans.  But then, the ride takes you into deeper and darker caverns, twisting and turning, until you are not sure when - or how -  it will end.

William Katt is a phenomenal actor, and he has lots of help.  George Wendt plays Cobb's nosy, funny, but caring next-door neighbor Harold.  Alan Autry, Richard Moll and other recognizable actors all have roles in the movie.

If you want lots of blood and gore, look elsewhere.  If you want a movie that will give you some laughs and thrills and has true heart, buy this one.

The effects were actually really good for a film of this age, and I especially liked the effects of the last monster/ghost (I won't go deep into detail because it is a twist in the story). It's has some creepy imagery and some spooky moments. I really liked that this film works well as a monster, ghost, and even a psychological horror movie with some dark humor. I also liked the music. Acting was also great, not the best, but not bad at all.

Overall, I recommend House. It was a fun time-killer, and horror fans will definitely appreciate it. As of 8/27/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming.

1417460,4,B00005ASOH,"One film that may have been swept under the rug amidst the wave of current '80s nostalgia is ""House."" The fact that it's been forgotten is a probably a good thing seeing as how it is about the only film in its time that hasn't been remade or isn't currently being targeted by Michael Bay or anyone else who would do it harm. In a way, ""House"" is a cult classic that is destined to stay a cult classic forever, and there are many reasons why.

The first reason lies in its plot structure. To say the film's biggest weakness lies in its sloppy story-telling would be an understatement; at times, the film flat-out makes no sense. There are no rules when it comes to the supernatural elements of the story; therefore, the film gets away with murder, so to speak.

Another reason would be its quirky sense of humor, achieved by its assorted cast. William Katt plays the straight man against the nosy and over-bearing neighbor, played by George Wendt of TV's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cheers/dp/B00008NV4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cheers</a>"". On the other side of the coin, Richard Moll (he being of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-Court/dp/B0006N2EZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night Court</a>"" fame) plays the chief bad-guy, glorious special effects make-up job and all, disguising his usual persona all while adding to further amusement when he fails in harassing his former war buddy.

Then, of course, we have the creepy yet amusing practical effects which define the film. The monsters or ghosts or whatever you'd like to refer to them as appear to be straight out of someone's nightmare, resembling nothing seen before and often achieved by something as simple as a latex mask. You'll giggle yourself silly as you watch Katt's character struggle with the skanky-looking goblin his ex-wife becomes. The laughs are derived partly because the scenario is so over-the-top and silly but also because the effects by which it is executed are just too good to be true and reminiscent of a time when horror movies had a certain authenticity to them, even when they didn't take themselves too seriously.

Rather than go any further into analyzing the film and why it should remain an '80s relic, it must be said that ""House"" is simply a boat-load of good times. Director Steve Miner (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th-Part-2-and-3-D/dp/B0002JP572/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Friday the 13th Part 2"" and ""3-D"")</a>) truly comes into his own with the film, which is both stylish and competently paced (too bad the director crapped out in the '90s). Meanwhile, William Katt carries the film on his shoulders, giving a performance that is both manic and sympathetic. Somewhere amidst the horror and the humor lies a story of redemption, and Katt somehow sells it. Although the film never quite settles on a specific tone or makes much sense throughout, it's still an enjoyable film that will deliver chuckles and jumps time and time again. It's certainly not a film for everyone, and that's the point. For those who prefer their horror off-beat and with a sense of humor, you'll found ""House"" to be worth entering.",1294790400,3,3247,5.3858267716535435

1417502,4,B00005ASOH,"When is a house not a home? When it's trying to scare the pisss out of you, that's when. In retrospect I had to think about why I liked this flick, because it does have stuff going against it. HOUSE is cheesy and campy, and yet also fun, and I guess maybe it's fun because it's so cheesy and campy. HOUSE is very much a product of the 1980s and this absolutely includes its featured lead William Katt, the Greatest American Hero himself.

HOUSE sets itself up to be a sinister horror film with dark psychological overtones. Roger Cobb (Katt) is a popular horror fiction author who's been recently coasting on his past success. Roger's in a slump, and it's not helping that he's been so obsessed with cranking out his Vietnam War memoirs. The writing doldrums go back some time ago to when his kid mysteriously vanished at his aunt's spooky  house. So to recap: languishing career, vanished kid. And, because certain things crop up in threes, Roger's hot actress wife also divorces him.

When his eccentric aunt hangs herself, Roger inherits her house and, rather than selling it, Roger decides to live in it for a while, hoping for inspiration to kick in. But an evil house does not a muse make. Soon all the weird stuff starts happening.

A lot of the movie is presented as a one-man act for William Katt, broken up by cutaways to Roger's ex-wife and by occasional drop-in visits by his nosy neighbor and his sexy neighbor. For the first half hour or so you sink into William Katt's character as he finds himself tormented by the haunted house, which is somehow dredging up traumatic memories of Roger Cobb's stint in Vietnam. There's a whiff of THE SHINING going on as we see Roger gradually going off the deep end. But then, somewhere along the way, things descend into slapstick territory. And while the story does drum up scattered scares here and there, they're undermined by the painfully obvious rubber monster suits and all the (intentional) goofiness. We get rehashed zaniness that recalls the EVIL DEAD series, but lacking that Sam Raimi's inspired frenzied touch. For a horror movie, the victim body count is practically nil. But the champion killjoy are all those Vietnam flashbacks that feel totally out of place and very dated. To me, these scenes established a jarring effect.

So why do I like this movie? I really think that a huge chunk of the reason is that I saw it during its theatrical run when I was a teen, so I'm pulling the nostalgia card. If you're an '80s buff, then you've got William Katt and George Wendt (Norm!! from CHEERS) and Richard Moll (NIGHT COURT) who in this one plays a soldier in Roger's platoon in the flashbacks. For a low budget production HOUSE actually boasts some decent acting. I like that William Katt never breaks character, even though all kinds of crazy shizzy rain down on him, and he takes on this fascinating tunnel vision mentality. You and me, the first time the house does something scary, we're probably out of there so fast there's you and me-shaped dust clouds left behind. But Roger Cobb decides to fight and beat the house at its own game. That is some impressive (and very stupid) brand of singlemindedness. And I even relish the bizarre turn which finds Roger Cobb babysitting a neighbor's young kid.

I also enjoy the film's juggling of the serious horror elements and the tongue-in-cheek stuff. What can I say, I'm a child of those times. I roll my eyes and make all the proper groaning noises, and yet I can't help but laugh with appreciation at all the kooky. William Katt takes it all so seriously, it's friggin' endearing.",1262736000,3,3596,4.655118110236221
1417503,3,B00005ASOH,"Most people know the star, William Katt, as the star of 80s TV show, Greatest American Hero.  Here, he takes a slightly different role about a Vietnam veteran with a troubled past.  His character loses a friend in Vietnam & his son dissappears mysteriously which everntually leads to the breakup of his marriage.  William Katt's character inherits an old (haunted) house when a late aunt dies & wills it to him.  Mysterious things start to happen after that.  House is a bit horror, a bit comedy with some good makeup and special effects thrown it.  I think this was an entertaining horror film with George Wendt (of TV's Cheers) and Richard Mol (of TV's Night Court) as part of the supporting cast.  This movie was a lot of fun.

1417504,4,B00005ASOH,"From the director of Friday The 13th Parts 2 and 3(Steve Miner)and from the producer of Friday The 13th:Part I; HOUSE was an awesome movie that had a lot of the same actors and actresses from the FRIDAY THE 13TH saga like Ron Carroll(Friday The 13th:Part 1)and had the same music composer(Harry Manfredini)which also did the music scoring for most of the FRIDAY THE 13TH installments as you may notice, especially during the major action scenes that are violent.

It was also interesting seeing William Katt from THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO doing his first real horror flick in this movie, with the exception of CARRIE and doing this movie 3 years after ABC had cancelled THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO, due to a hug dip in ratings since newer shows that premiered between the Fall of 1982 like KNIGHT RIDER and in the Spring of 1983 like THE A-TEAM led to THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO's cancellation by the Summer of 1983.

HOUSE also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when I was still living in the Imperial Valley when HOUSE had its theatrical release in the Spring of 1986 when I was in 7th grade at Wilson Jr. High School in my hometown(El Centro, CA).

It's just too bad that HOUSE 2:THE SECOND STORY wasn't as good as this one was, but I'm sure part of the reason why HOUSE II wasn't as good as the original was probably due to the fact that since HOUSE 2 was Rated PG-13 instead of Rated R like HOUSE I, which resulted in HOUSE II having a lot less action and a lot less violence than the original along with the fact that sequels usually never measure up to the originals either, especially since they don't make sequels like they used to, unlike HALLOWEEN 2, FRIDAY THE 13TH:PART II, and PSYCHO 2 for instance which were all very exceptional sequels and probably the best sequels of all time.",1252972800,,1805,4.496951219512195

1417507,3,B00005ASOH,"Those of you familiar with the hit TV show ""House, M.D."" will surely be left scratching your head after watching this ill-conceived prequel.

From what I gathered after watching the movie, ""House"" shows us the early days of the titular character we've all grown to love from the hit Fox TV show.  What I don't quite get is why House's name in this movie is Roger Cobb.

But let's forget that for a moment and move onto the plot.

Set in the days before House went to med school, ""House"" tells the story of Cobb (played here by the talented William Katt), a Vietnam vet/writer staying in his aunt's house.

Now, I have to admit, I liked this aspect of the story.  Every week we see House as this curmudgeon with a penchant for solving the most complex of medical cases.  What we don't see is why he is so difficult to get along with.  Well, for those of us who are veterans of the Vietnam War, we can certainly understand House's short-comings now.

I also liked the fact that House was a writer before he decided to become a doctor.  As an aspiring writer myself, I can empathize with wanting to quit the profession altogether and start over.  Perhaps we'll see the writing-side of House come out in future episodes!

Unfortunately, that's the only thing I liked about ""House.""  It doesn't take long for the movie to get completely weird.

While staying in the house, Cobb's son mysteriously disappears.  That doesn't sound weird to you?  What if I told you that [SPOILER ALERT] the house took him?  That's right, the house that Cobb is staying in is haunted.  The house causes him to have Vietnam flashbacks, monsters start coming out of the closet, and medicine cabinets open up different dimensions.  Like I said - weird.

All of that aside, I think it's fascinating that Cobb would later move on with his life and change his name to House.  An interesting choice of surnames, but after watching the movie I'm sure you'll agree it's an appropriate one.

While I can't recommend ""House"" to all fans of ""House, M.D.,"" I will say that some of you will glean some new details about your favorite character that you never knew.  So for that, I applaud it.",1240963200,5,2153,4.549479166666667

1417529,4,B00005ASOH,"Well, I can't quite call this essential Horror or Halloween material. but that said, it is an interesting horror movie.

It starts quite normal and plausible. William Katt (a writer) is trying to tie up some loose ends. He goes to sell his aunt's house carrying the sorrow that his aunt killed herself. (So he has to go through some painful moments of walking through the house.)

However, he decides he has some unfinished business and decides to hold off on the selling. (At least for the moment) We are also permitted sympathy for him in that he has lost his son, and that he is separated from his wife. But his wife and he are still on speaking terms, and somehow he get the impression that they may get back together. An especially comical moment is when he is talking to her on the telephone and he turns up the stereo to make it sound like he his having a party.

There are some overdone moments, but the story is interesting enough so that we are inclined to forgive that. While trying to resolve the matters of his missing son, he is having flashbacks of his experiences in Vietnam, while he is trying to think of ideas for his new book. (The writer of this may have been familiar with the stream of consciousness technique of writing.) There is also a scene that alludes to Edgar Allen Poe's ""Tell Tale Heart.""

George Wendt is an interesting character. He offers some badly needed comic relief; in addition, he may appear to be out of it, but he does offer worthwhile help sometimes. In a light hearted moment, Katt gets a chance at romance.

In this story of horror, mystery, and suspense, we have some well placed laughs, and even an interesting soundtrack. The climax interestingly links the past to the present, and we have an ending that resolves a number of issues. While I can not quite call it essential horror, it is certainly good. At least give it a chance.",1224201600,2,1879,4.4985337243401755

The movie is at once both silly and shocking. Yes the plot is trite and the acting is shallow but on a whole the HOUSE is never lack luster or slow. The plot never plods along. This House is always rocking with some new interdemensional ghoul or porthole to an alternate reality just begging to be explored.

I really hate to say this but the way the movie protrays the grandmothers death is a weirdest sort of funny. You must admit for her to live in a house with all these odd, ""Features"" she had to be a unique woman indeed. This is the first movie I have ever where death was made to appear part of the campish fun of the movie.

Anyways the house unintentionally ends up helping the Nam Vet author come to terms with with unresolved issues that went back to his service in Veitnam.

When I saw the movie trailer for HOUSE, I thought it would be just another throw-away film that is a waste of time, but after watching it I now own it and am not at all disappointed.

HOUSE tells the story of a nephew named Roger who's aunt has committed suicide in a house that he used to live. Now an author and divorced, he has decided to move into the house for awhile to finish a new book he is trying to work on about his experience in the Vietnam War. The neighbors in the movie (was that gorgeous woman in that bathing suit good-looking or what?) are more than curious about what's going on (Norm from Cheers makes a good impression here), but Roger doesn't want anyone to bother him while he writes his book, but the strange happenings at the house leave him bewildered. There are some good scares to be had in the movie, but also a good amount of fun and I don't want to give it away so just rent this movie and watch with the lights down or out...you'll be glad you watched this HOUSE.",1129075200,3,1141,4.135135135135135

OK, Greatest American Hero was not a hit but Cheers and Night Court were. And I always thought William Katt was underrated anyway.

1417589,4,B00005ASOH,"As far as campy ""B"" rated horror/comedy films go, House ranks up there near the top.  First of all, look at the cast.  You have an ensemble of television stars getting into the big screen using this film as their vehicle.  George Wendt and William Katt are prime examples of this.  Their acting level is below minimal standards and you can really tell that they are acting.  You never really see the struggle of Cobb trying to write his manuscript for his next novel while having to deal with the demons in the house.  You never really understand why Wendt is against Katt so adamantly.  You never really get an answer as to why he stayed in that house and dealt with the spirits the way that he did instead of just bolting out the door after the first scream.  There are several questions unanswered and plenty of cheapness to this film, but ... and get this ... that is what makes it phenomenal.

Let's take a deeper look at this film.  To begin it is a horror/comedy made in the 80s, which already sets the standard.  The 80s were notorious for brining to light the horror/comedy genre and they made no exception here.  The set and sound are not the best in this film, while the monsters are completely 80s (for lack of a better word).  You can definitely see the differences between gory monsters of today, and those made yesteryears.  There seems to be a focus on the absurd in the 80s, instead of the grotesque and unbelievable of today's standards.  This is a cheesy film, and it was meant to be.  That is definitely something I miss with today's films.  I saw it briefly in Shawn of the Dead, but it still hasn't come full circle yet.  I need a rebirth of this genre.  Less nudity, less gore, and more undeniably 80s monsters.  I believe that people would still flock to see it.  I know I would be in line.  The set, cinematography, and acting were all perfect for this film.  When I watched this movie again with some friends, there were some that had not seen it and jumped on several occasions.  That says to me that it has maintained a fright factor.  You can tell if a horror film has lasted the test of time if nearly 20 years later others are still jumping.

What also worked perfectly in this film was the comedy aspect.  I don't know if it was trying to go for the sub-genre of parody, but there were scenes that I saw in this film that reminded me of some of the classics like The Shining, Nightmare on Elm Street, Ghoulies, and Evil Dead.  It was a very good mix that worked exceptionally well in building that extra chuckle whenever Cobb did something you know is absurd.  He is the perfect example of your uneducated hero.  When he should be running outside to regroup and collect his ideas, he is instead running upstairs where the terror is greater.  Whenever he attempted to write, but was constantly interrupted by ghouls, goblins, or even the neighbor, it made me smile.  He was not your average hero, yet somehow I found myself cheering for him at the end.

Overall, this was your average ""cult"" horror film that the 80s were notorious for.  If you walk into this film expecting today's standards, you will be disappointed.  If you go into it thinking of what the 80s were like, especially in the horror genre in Hollywood, I think you will be utterly surprised.  I have seen this film several times, and it continues to get better each time I watch it.  Katt does a superb job with the material and experience that he has, and nearly rockets himself into a Bruce Campbell clone.  Well ... almost ... I don't think Campbell's status could ever be compromised!  Enjoy ... scream ... and have a good time.  Just watch out for when that clock hits midnight, you never know what parallel universe may be clumping around in your closet ...

I remember seeing this in the theater in 86, and remember it being one of the most fun experiences I've ever had in the theater.  They just don't make horror films like this anymore.  This is an extremely entertaining 90 minutes.  It's a wonderful balance of horror and comedy.  Actually, it's one of the best examples of horror/comedy out there(another great one is the 86 alien invasion/zombie/axe murderer spoof ""Night Of The Creeps.""  Remember that one?  About the alien slugs that jump into peoples' mouths?).  Most horror/comedies today focus too much on the comedy angle(like Army Of Darkness) to the point that you've forgotten that it's categorized as a horror film.  ""House"" manages some genuinely creepy moments to totally make you forget the comedic moments, and on the other side of the coin, some utterly hilarious scenes.  And the comedy in this film isn't so overblown and exaggerated.  It's actually believable most of the time.  William Katt does a helluva job in his role.  He accomplishes a large task carrying the whole film, I mean, he's on camera for 98% of the film.  I wonder why he never got any more big roles after this.  But, all I can say is that I'm very glad that I bought this dvd.  As for ""House 2"", it's okay.  It's a comedy totally unrelated to ""House.""

If you are looking for a scary or Gory movie, look elsewhere. However if you have a spare hour and a half and have nothing better to do, then give house a shot. It starts slow, but there are enoguh sight gags to keep you interested. However there are some flashback scenes that are painfully slow, and most of the time not very funny. The acting is pretty damned good though, and their facial expressions are priceless. If you make it half way thorugh there is some pretty cool looking makeup effects in this film. From the monster in the closet to the bloated opaque clown woman. There are some plot problems, which are to be expected in this type of film, but House feels kinda rushed. Everything during the second half of the movie moves very quickly and does little explaining as to what the house is or why it does what it does. Overall this film is a cross between Killer Clowns form outer space and Army of Darkness. Despite all of ist problems the film is still a fun little waste of time, if thats what your in the market for. You probobly won't watch it very often, but its good to pull out around halloween or on a boring weekend.

1417635,5,B00005ASOH,"HOUSE is a horror movie in the same category as EVIL DEAD 2. It's a movie that has elements of horror, interlaced with dark comedy and even a little bit of action/adventure.

The movie stars William Katt as Roger Cobb, a famous horror writer who hasn't written anything new in over a year. A few years before, his son disappeared from his Aunt's home in which they lived and from there his life has gone downhill leading to a divorce and his current writer's block. His crazy aunt claimed the house stole the child, but his aunt was crazy. Or was she? After his Aunt's apparent suicide, Roger moves into the house to finish work on his memoirs of the Vietnam war, but he gets much more than he ever bargained.

HOUSE is a classic. It's full of psychological suspense and frightening creatures. For the first half of the movie, the audience is left wondering if the house is haunted or if Roger is going insane and the things he sees are just manifestations of his imagination. The movie has living, flying garden tools; scary monsters; a wormhole-like wardrobe; and one mean dead Vietnam war buddy.

Both contain a commentary track, and I have to disagree with the previous review that the House 2 commentary track is the weaker of the two. I found the House 2 commentary to be very informative, more so than the House commentary. The House DVD also has a short  ""making of"" featurette that doesn't really satisfy, but hey, that they were able to dig this footage up at all is amazing for a New World picture.
Also included are two movie poster cards for both House and House 2, a nice touch by the fine folks of Anchor Bay. Finally, the transfers are beautiful, and the sound is clear. You just can't have a horror/genre DVD collection and not include these discs. But hurry, only the first pressing will have the bonus House 2 DVD.

1417640,4,B00005ASOH,"House is a uniquely unpredictably droll haunted house flick that chronicles an ailing creatively challenged horror author's artistic rediscovery as he investigates his recently late-aunt's haunted house. As the novelist's perception of reality becomes increasingly blurred, inanely blemished by unreality, and dispersedly interconnected with the subject matter of his new autobiographical book about the Vietnam War, the author finds himself killing off his estranged wife who's unpredictably been morphing into a monster, capturing monstrosities randomly annoying him from the guest room's closet, or hearing the espondent cries from his dead son. Despite the extremely morbid sounding nature of the House's plot, the film is actually a quite hilarious horror-comedy as it totally exploits your interest in it by erratically buoying its mood between terror and camp so effectively and confidently you can't keep track as to what's going on or how you're feeling as you're watching it. The House is such an awesome curiously innovative little film that contradicts ALL of you're expectations ,while delivering one heck of a revitalizing romp through horror irrelevance. You can't help but be assimilated into its capricious glee.
As for the House 2, it's definitely geared more directly towards self-conscious camp and giddy B-Movie conventions by telling a tale of dueling late 19th century corpses bidding for a magical skull. Regardless of its lack of horror, House 2 continues it's predecessor's preoccupation with exuberant unpredictably and immensely amusing comic delirium in the finest tradition of the Evil Dead series.
As for the limited 20,000 copies edition, it does contain commentaries and a few interesting editions. However, it's these amazingly fresh horror-camp classics that you should be buying them for.

7935636,3,B00005ASOH,"House isn't what I expected at all.  The story made it seem like it's going to be a super scary horror film about a haunted house, but it's actually scary in a silly playful way intended for kids with emphasis on one's own imagination opening a world of wonder.  Maybe some of the horror is supposed to be silly, like for example the way the monsters look, since they clearly look like costumes to me.  Or maybe House is just a low budget movie so the monsters looking like people in costumes is unintentional.  Then again some review sources list House as a comedy and if that's the case, this changes my entire outlook of the movie.

When William Katt's child character walks into a house he heads upstairs to a bedroom and sees an old lady hanging on a rope.  She committed suicide which freaks him out.  The way she's hanging freaks ME out as well!  Graphic moment for sure.  Turns out this woman is William's aunt.  Years later, William's a troubled writer.  He moves into his aunt's home, even though it's apparently haunted.  Take note William's the only one who thinks it's haunted.  Well besides his haunt.  He's also popular around town because of his writing and his neighbor -played by George Wendt- wants his autograph and won't leave him alone.

The story's strange in that we can't tell if William's character is actually being tormented by monsters or if his writer's imagination is playing with his head.  For example we see William reflect on an incident where he couldn't find his son.  When he runs to the front yard a car quickly speeds off.  This assumes the son was kidnapped... but when he runs to the back yard he sees his son drowning in the swimming pool.  When William jumps into the pool to save his son... the son disappears.  If this isn't confusing enough, the question of ""Is William reflecting on a traumatic past event or he activating his crazy imagination for the purpose of trying to come up with story ideas for his writing?"" comes into play.  It's so weird really.  At least in this case we get another flashback when the aunt was alive, and she explains the house took the kid.  She knows it's haunted.  This implies William's thinking of an actual event from his past and not something he made up for the purpose of his writing.

And the monsters themselves... they clearly look like people in costumes.  One of them is some kind of slimy alien creature that walks out of the bedroom closet.  William's so fascinated by this -or fascinated by his imagination- that he wraps a rope around the doorknob and pretends to open and close the door repeatedly hoping the monster will appear again.  In the process William turns really silly and runs around the house acting goofy.  When he runs outside he runs into George who thinks he's just weird.  I'm with George!

The neighbor seems to turn on William as the story goes along.  When William thinks his wife is visiting him in the living room, she reaches down to grab something only to jump up as a bloated ugly-faced monster.  The fight is on between the two.  Williams runs around the house avoiding not only this monster, but avoiding tools such as shovels and rakes that lift up in the air by themselves (on numerous occasions) and chase William around the house.  It comes off silly instead of scary hence the reason I think House was made for kids.

I enjoyed the cop scene the most.  The cops arrive after George calls them, and they want to know why he's illegally firing a gun.  They realize he's a famous writer so the two cops give him a break.  The one cop wants to use the bathroom so Williams lets him inside... reluctantly, since his wife's monster body in stuffed inside a cabinet.  The cops look around the house while William tries to protect the shelf where his wife is hiding.  Nice writing.  The cops suspect William's behavior is off but they eventually leave.  The feeling is that, given the playful imagination of William, that even if the monster woman/wife had appeared in front of the cops, only William would see it.

Then you have silly things like a stuffed fish on the wall come to life.  The eyeball movements and the way it flaps around is comparable to the silliness and cheese of Jaws.  Jaws was about the un-scariest movie I've ever seen since viewers can easily tell it's not a real fish, and the monsters in House come close to that level of silliness.  To be fair I recall people telling me Jaws was scary when it came out since there was nothing like it at the time, but House was made at least 10 years later so I'm sure by then people realized how silly these monsters look.  This is all assuming House is actually a horror and not a comedy.  I have a feeling House was a horror when it came out but over time people realized how silly it is so it became an unintentional comedy.  If people didn't realize how silly House was when it came out, they surely realize it now.

The main part of the story is that William's focusing on his Vietnam War story, and he constantly pretends he's in war with an apparent bully who's part of his troop (Richard Moll's character- oh hey it's Bull from Night Court!)  At first the bullying is innocent- William wants a cigarette but Bull fills the cigarette box with worms or snakes prompting William to drop it as Bull laughs.  Eventually, and perhaps this is when William's imagination turns into reality, Bull returns as a demonic version of himself and chases William around the house.  This leads to several quality moments that I enjoyed.  Really far-fetched and silly ones (such as William hanging on the edge of a cliff- where did that steep cliff come from?) but Bull does a great job as a monster.

This is only a horror for those with an overactive imagination.  It's not like the story focuses on William having mental issues or anything.  Perhaps House is one of those cases where William's son really was kidnapped and perhaps he really did have problems with his wife.  Being secluded in this house only took his imagination to bad places.  But the house is supposed to be haunted according to both William and his aunt.  Who knows really.  It's either ""The house is haunted and only William can see these monsters"" or ""Every monster you see is made up because William is either an imaginative guy or is completely stressed out and losing his mind"".  I do remember watching this movie in the 80's and thinking it was scarier then, back when I was a kid.  Either way House is okay.  I like the movie- I just don't think it makes much sense and isn't scary at all.",1497657600,,6544,4.524296675191816

This is absolutely one of my favorite films, this and part two both are just super fun. These films are the horror/comedy types in the vein of the The Evil Dead films. I remember seeing this as a kid, renting both this and two and just loving them. When this film came out on DVD I had to have it. My brother and I busted out the drinks and feed and sat down to enjoy both this one and part two once again.

The story follows a man who has released a very successful horror book but Roger Cobbs life has crumbled apart. He tragically lost his son, as in his son went missing which lead to his wife leaving him. Add on top of that that his Aunt hung herself and left him her house, the house in which his son went missing. Also just for fun, the house is haunted. Now not only does he have to deal with a house on the fritz but a nosy neighbor and maybe even a face from the past.

This film is so much fun, from the acting to the great 80s special effects and music, to just about everything. The comedy is great as is the elements of horror that bring the whole thing together. This time period had some of the most fun and original horror/comedies of all time. In fact only a handful of films since the 80s have entered into my best of list since this time [Shaun of the Dead being the most obvious along with Tucker and Dale vs. Evil and maybe a few others]. Also the cast is amazing here with William Katt excellent as our lead and George Wendt is always great.

Director Steve Miner did an amazing job with this film, it may be my favorite from him and that is saying something since he also directed the first Warlock film and the first Lake Placid movie, both of which I love. Add on to that he also directed such films as Friday the 13th 2 & 3, Halloween H2O, Texas Rangers and the second Day of the Dead remake among others. Also credit must go to the great writers of this film which are Fred Dekker [House 2, Night of the Creeps, The Monster Squad, Ricochet, and Robocop 3 among others] and Ethan Wiley [Children of the Corn 5, Brutal and Elf-Man as well as others].

This is one of my all time favorite films and the DVD comes with some great special features. You get the behind the scenes look and the trailers but the real gem is the audio commentary. The commentary is done by Director Miner, writer Wiley, lead actor Katt and legendary producer Sean S. Cunningham. Great commentary which is fun as always.

This is old school especial effects, which often work extremely well (the undead soldier was particularly good).  House spends most of the time as horror, but veers into comedy often enough (and does so successfully) that it stands in the same category as Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness.  The writing is good and the acting excellent, with a fairly good story behind it.  There is a 12 minute making of film in the special features that has some interesting material, but about half of it is movie clips rather than behind the scenes.
