2383576,4,B000AABKYK,"I really enjoyed this video. It was edited well and had some real history and insight to these elite units. I liked that it tries to cover each of the services rolls. I of course loved the USMC's Silent Drill Team; I did how ever thought it could have shown more coverage. The overall presentation was great, but to put it over the top to 5-stars in my opinion it could have offered more coverage of the pop & circumstance that often is associated with presidential funerals and obscure rituals.",1171411200,,495,4.511111111111111
2383577,5,B000AABKYK,"From 1969 to 1971 I had the honor of serving with the Army's ceremonial unit in Washington -- ""The Old Guard"" -- which is one of the units featured in this documentary.  The film does a masterful job of capturing the spirit and the essence of not just the The Old Guard, but the ceremonial units of all four of the armed services.  The film's production values are outstanding, and it does a wonderful job of capturing all of the color and pageantry, and in many cases the sorrow and solemnity, inherent in the work that these units do.  What it does best, however, is reflect the mentality of the troops who serve in these units -- the privilege they feel in serving, the gratitude and deep respect they feel for those whose sacrifices they honor.  For anybody who sheds a tear when Memorial Day comes around each year, this film will deepen your appreciation, heighten your love of country, and give you a deserved sense of satisfaction over the way that we, as a people, are true to our promise not to forget out fallen heroes.",1070323200,14,1030,4.491978609625669

8076939,5,B000AABKYK,"History Channel has done a great job with the ""Honor and Glory - America's Elite Military Honor Guards"" DVD. It really gives one insite into the life of our Militray Honor Guards. Very informative and easy to view.",1374796800,,214,4.657894736842105
8076940,4,B000AABKYK,"This DVD is the work of the History Channel.  There is quite a bit  history about the honor guards, and how they came into existence.  People tend to think that the honor guard consists of just Marines or Army personnel, but the military honor guards come from every branch of the service and that there are women who are in the color guard as well.  The training is extensive when vying for positions in the guard.  I was disappointed in that some of the DVD skipped around, never staying very long on a subject.",1323907200,,513,4.414893617021277
8076941,5,B000AABKYK,"Excellent, colorful and fantastic.
It is good to know the history of US honor guards, how they were trained to be qualified and their duties.
If the producer spend more details to US marines guard rifle drill like in A few good men movie, that would be much more enjoyable.",1319241600,,273,4.48
8076942,5,B000AABKYK,"I first saw this VHS tape about 10 years ago, and unfortunately lost it in a move across town.  I have looked for it ever since, since it is one of the most patriotic and stirring films I've ever seen.  The DVD was a little different than the VHS I had, but the content was still along the same lines.  It shows the dedication and drive of all the individuals connected with the armed services Honor Guards.  What I consider particularly moving, is the Marines Silent Drill Team.  They are awesome, the skill and precision using razor-sharp bayonets--all in silence!  I can watch this DVD for hours.  There, of course, is the added bonus of learning the history of all the different branches of the service.  I plan to re-watch this DVD on all patriotic holidays, flag days and any other occasion that warrants it!",1305849600,,814,4.56551724137931
8076943,2,B000AABKYK,"I'm a former member of the United States Navy Ceremonial Guard. As a former member of the guard I was terribly disappointed in this documentary. While I certainly appreciate the attention given to the United States Marine Corps Silent Drill Team and to the United States Army Old Guard - Tomb Guards, I was bothered by the limited attention given to the other branches of service. The Coast Guard was barely mentioned at all, the Navy Guard Unit was extremely limited and not well represented. In fact, the most attention for the Navy Unit was focused on the female Lieutenant that served at the time as the Commander of the Guard and the fact that at the time she was the first, and only female Guard Commander...  so what! This was a documentary about the units, not about breaking gender barriers. Based on the documentary one would believe that only the Army's Old Guard does burial details and that only the Air Force Guard does Firing Party Volley details, none of this is true. Each unit does burial details on a regular basis, each unit has a Drill Team, a Color Guard, Pall Bearer Specialists and more. The Guardsmen and Guardswomen that serve in these elite units are special young people that are carefully selected, highly trained and they serve with pride and distinction. I would have liked to have seen a documentary that highlighted all of the units and their special and unique qualities. It should also be noted that every one of these units has a specific assignment related to military duty, they are not simply toy soldiers! One other thing that really bothered me too was the fact that there was little effort to show only the best of the best. I don't know who the individuals were that approved the final edits but the footage I saw showed flaws that should have never been allowed to be captured on film. Crooked covers (hats), inapproriately worn gun belts, improper sizing of troops according to height, flawed cadences and a host of other inadequacies were evident to this old Guardsman. Of course the Tomb Guards were perfect, but that is the highest calling and catching them off guard is unheard of. I am critical of this DVD because I firmly believe that this is a story that deserves to be done right and that should give equal attention to each branch of service and their Guard Units. It is very obvious that the producers and directors of this film didn't know their subject matter and it appears that the Commands of the Guard Units either didn't know what was being done or didn't really care...  I know that my former Commander, Commander Green would have never approved the material that represented the United States Navy Ceremonial Guard in this film.",1298592000,9,2693,4.703389830508475
