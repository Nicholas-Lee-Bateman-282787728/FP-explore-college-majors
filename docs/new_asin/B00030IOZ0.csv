8035758,5,B00030IOZ0,Not Vishal Bharadwaj's best effort (Omkara is my personal favorite) but this is a solid showing by one of Bollywood's few trailblazers.  Irrfan's transition from follower to leader is a bit unconvincing and Tabu goes a bit overboard in some scenes.  Pankaj Kapoor is excellent as usual.  Naseeruddin Shah and Om Puri are delightful in strong supporting roles - they manage to steal the show during their scenes.,1418774400,,411,5.014705882352941
8035759,5,B00030IOZ0,"Intelligent and inventive updating of Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"" to the culture of the modern Indian underworld in Mumbai. Director Vishal Bhardwaj and screenwriter Abbas Tryewala walk the tightrope between fidelity to the original and inventiveness rarely making a misstep. Indeed, you don't have to have any knowledge of ""Macbeth"" to appreciate ""Maqbool"" as a well above average gangland film, filled with interesting characters, and tons of politics, violence, alliances and deals made and broken.

The acting is generally excellent. Pankaj Kapur practically steals the film with his performance as Maqbool's boss, a savvy mob leader who has kept power not only through fear, but through inspiring loyalty and even love from not only those around him, but from 'the people' as well, by standing up for India's many minorities, who in turn elect officials inclined to look the other way at mob activities

The film is an interesting mix of old and new for Bollywood. The style and tone is naturalistic, the performances unforced. There are echoes of ""The Godfather"". And while there are songs, there are only a few, and generally within a context where someone bursting into song actually makes sense  a wedding celebration for instance.

The film does wind down a bit towards the end, but so does (for me) Shakespeare's play  the most interesting thing being Macbeth's (or Maqbool's) seduction by and rise to power, more than the seemingly inevitable consequences.

This is well worth seeing for anyone interested in Shakespeare, or Indian cinema, or just a good tale of power struggles whether in the mob or in society at large.

The Eagle blu-ray is of poor quality, so this DVD (which I haven't seen) may be the better deal for the money.",1398470400,2,1741,5.066433566433567
8035760,5,B00030IOZ0,"This is a great Bollywood interpretation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Well acted, nice soundtrack, interesting take on theme of ambition gone amok.",1355875200,2,144,5.904761904761905
8035761,5,B00030IOZ0,"Even for those in the wider world who think little of the 'glizz' and 'glamour' of the usual Bollywood film output this is a MUST.  It is a brilliant reinterpretation of 'MACBETH' (Shakespeare). Serious, dramatic, brilliantly filmed and acted it is well worth any film viewers' time.
As a follow up, if you do enjoy this,try 'OMKARA' (OTHELLO) it is equally as good. With the widespread Shakespeare festival going on this year these two films are a very welcome addition for those who do not know them. Especially suitable for those wise folk who are willing to broaden their scope and 'get-into' the brilliant range of serious Bollywood films which are now being produced.",1345334400,3,673,4.9035087719298245
8035762,5,B00030IOZ0,The product (DVD) quality and service I received was outstanding. I particularly enjoyed the accurate messages informing me of the status of my order.,1293840000,,150,5.291666666666667
8035763,5,B00030IOZ0,"Director Vishal Bhardwaj's first foray into the world of Shakespeare is nothing short of astounding--'Maqbool' is one of the finest adaptations of 'Macbeth' ever produced. His interpretation, while faithful to the story, is no slave to it, and he spins an enthrallingly distinct version of the Scottish play. The elderly king here is an Indian mob boss called Abbaji, Macbeth is his underling Maqbool, and Lady Macbeth is Abbaji's wicked mistress Nimmi, who goads Maqbool into supplanting Abbaji and claiming her as the reward. And instead of three witches, there are two comical astrologers. Equal credit for this masterpiece goes to lead actors Irrfan Khan and Tabu, who dig deep into the warped psyches of Maqbool and Nimmi and flesh out these disturbed characters with original, mesmerizing portrayals. Nimmi's motivations are complex and myriad as she manipulates Macbool's insecurities, and his transformation from mild-mannered servant to monstrous leader is frightening. Bhardwaj even improves upon the play by adding a reason for the lady's otherwise inconsistent, guilt-induced descent into madness: the uncertain paternity of her unborn child. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bollywood-Ticket/dp/B002Q0WPWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bollywood Ticket</a>)",1256601600,4,1389,6.239583333333333
8035764,5,B00030IOZ0,"There's a reason why Tabu is considered one of the best actresses in Indian Cinema. To me she is one of the best actresses in the world. if only, the US audience could see her body of work, then they will know what the Indian Cinema have been been raving about. And this movie just proves what a great actress she is. Her versatility astounds me. In this movie, you will like her, you will hate her and sympathize with her. The very last scene with her and Irrfan Khan (who plays Miyan Maqbool) is a classic. The way those two actors execute the scene was just flawless. Irrfan and Tabu have a great on-screen chemistry and their top caliber acting is really something to marvel.

I have always admired Tabu's selection of films. She's known to do low-budget films and tackle different roles. She's also one of very few actresses who can pull off any role with ease. Her movie with Indian movie legend Amitabh Bachchan in ""Cheeni Kum"" just proves what a versatile and intelligent actress she truly is. No other actress in India could pull off that role with Amitabh, being it a May-December relationship. You will truly believe in the story.

I just can't say enough about her immense talent. I just wish she did more films. And I do hope that Mira Nair does come up with a story to put Tabu and Forest Whitaker (who is a big fan of Tabu)together.",1208390400,,1347,4.449392712550607
8035765,4,B00030IOZ0,"I enjoyed this take on ""the Scottish Play"". A very atypical Bollywood movie.. understated, well-acted, solid. Some of what seemed like awkward edits I read as symbolic of Maqbool's thought processes falling aprt. I could be very wrong, but it allowed me to not worry about it!
The director did some creative re-thinking of the play: Om Puri and Naseeruddin Shah as cops who are corrupt/prescient were great as the witch stand-ins. Making Nimmi/Lady M. a mistress first rather than wife gave her social-climbing a different, even vulnerable edge. And while it may seem typically Bollywood to add a daughter and son-in-law to the mix ( Sameera & Guddu), it opened up the storyline.
Performances: Om Puri and Naseeruddin Shah were prefectly cast, Tabu was fabulous as Nimmi and Irfan Khan was oddly magnetic as Maqbool. The supporting cast did a fine job.
While the movie was roughly faithful to the play in broad strokes, I wouldn't try to force the parallels; it will only confuse you. Maqbool is an excellent watch. I hope the director isn't sick of spinning off Western classics. After Omkara and Maqbool, I'd love to see what he could do with another Shakespeare play, or even Greek tragedy.",1188432000,8,1193,4.8817733990147785
8035766,5,B00030IOZ0,"This probably is the best screen adaptation of Macbeth I have come across. It is a haunting morality play set in Bombay underworld. The whole movie is completely non-judgemental and thin boundaries between good and evil explored by making you think. The performances are amazing. Throughout the movie I was not sure whether to root for Tabu (playing lady Macbeth) or hate her. Pankaj Kapoor will be known for his portrayal of strong yet cunning ""Abbaji"" for years to come. The atmosphere created by Vishal is amazingly realistic. Over that Vishal has rendered some great tunes to great words of Gulzar. Hats off to this guy, I expect to see one of the greatest Indian director in him in time to come.",1095811200,6,700,4.745901639344262
