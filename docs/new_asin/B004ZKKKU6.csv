4509900,4,B004ZKKKU6,"I enjoyed this collection.  It brought back a lot of memories for me going back to the eighties.  A lot of the moments were something and were fun to watch again especially uncut.  But moments that should have been there and weren't were the Matt Hardy return when he first attacked Edge that was an OMG moment as many people wondered if that was scripted or not and it was shocking, and the biggest surprise of all Bret's return.  True WWE really is a never say never thing, but after years of bitterness, and talk it really didn't seem likely that Bret would ever come back so his return qualified as an OMG moment in my opinion.  There weren't any Hogan moments except for one but I felt his title loss to Yokozuna qualified too especially that camera flaming up in his face.  And how could they leave out when Flair first arrived back in 1991 with the WCW title belt?  And even when Hogan first arrived as Backlund's partner?

These are just some moments I would have picked, but hey I guess you can only get so many moments for the 50 they chose and they probably didn't want to go that far back as some of these incidents went.  There were a few that I didn't think needed to be there like Undertaker being chokeslammed through the ring, and Cena lifting both Big Show and Edge, these were Okay moments but not OMG moments.  Still overall this is one of the better ones they've put out and I highly recommend it.  A lot of the moments were funny as well so you will be enjoy it.

4509901,4,B004ZKKKU6,"I was a big WWE fan in the 1990's during the Attitude Era and this video brought me right back to that time.  Loved seeing all the older clips.  The theme music got to be annoying after a while though, as it played after each segment.  Other than that, good stuff!",1316476800,,264,4.137254901960785
4509902,4,B004ZKKKU6,"As someone who's a product of the 80s and grew up with the WWF/WWE, there's plenty of memorable moments that I remember experiencing thanks to Vincent McMahon and company. Recently, I started getting back into the WWE again, and one of their newest DVD releases appeals to all groups of fans, whether you just started watching in the past few years, or your an old timer like myself. 'OMG! The Top 50 Incidents in WWE history' promises just what it's namesake entails: some of the craziest moments you probably remember from the past thirty or so years in the WWF/WWE. Since it's a DVD release, I'll be talking about what's provided on the three disc set, and not so much a normal ""review"" of the movie.

First off, I'm going to get my main complaint out of the way. OMG! is a 3-disc set broken down in the following way:

Disc 1: All 50 moments shown in short clips
Disc 2-3: Random full matches/moments from the list

The complaint comes in the fact that on the full match/moment discs, they must have randomly drawn numbers out of a hat to figure out which ones to show (most of which are already released on other WWE DVDs anyway). Some of the higher ranked moments aren't shown in full, but don't worry if you want to see Shawn Michaels throw Marty Janette through the barber shop window (a 20 second moment anyway), you can watch the ""full"" version to your hearts content.

Now on with the good stuff, and believe me there's a lot. If you were a fan of the WWE at all, ever, one of your favorite moments will probably be shown on this DVD. They did an amazing job at picking the most memorable moments from the past, and they managed to find a good mix of both old and new. They also have a handful of the newer popular wrestlers commentating on the clips (The Miz, CM Punk, John Cena), so it's interesting to hear what the new blood thinks of the older wrestlers and ideas. Once or twice they talk as though they saw the moment live, but if you crunch the numbers, you would realize that they were one or two years old when the moment happened. Along with that, it's fun to see the dates on the countdown and be able to go ""Holy cow, I was five when this happened!"" If you're a Stone Cold fan, you'll have a field day with this release, as he easily has 10-15 of the 50 moments in the show.

One thing that I picked up on now from all of this was how ""racist/offensive"" the WWF used to be back in the early 80s. Two of the moments are Piper's Pit moments, one of which involves picking on an African little person dressed as Mr. T, and calling Jimmy Snuka a monkey (along with other insults) while throwing fruit at him. None of it is bad or super tasteless, but it's just funny to see how ridiculous some of their ideas were back in the beginning.

Overall, this is definitely a DVD that should be seen, especially with friends (and alcohol). I'm glad that I took the two hours to watch it all and reminisce about the randomness of my childhood that was the WWF.",1315526400,,2970,4.313620071684587

4509904,2,B004ZKKKU6,"I will not write a very long review since I did not finish watching this program.  Basically it is another top 50 WWE events list.  I made it through to number 45 before the theme music completely ruined this production.  After each event, the them music of about 30+ seconds would start and then another 2 or 3 minute piece of WWE history would start.  I think I turned off the program after it showed the Big Show tossing the Undertaker through the WWE ring.  Overall, It might have been a good program if the editors had chosen not to over play the theme music throughout the DVD.",1314835200,2,583,4.361111111111111
4509905,4,B004ZKKKU6,"In the decades WWE has been around, there have been numerous incidents that have happened that made you do a double take or think ""Did I just see that?"" & made you say ""Oh My God!"" Well WWE compiled their own list of these type of incidents here.  Now this set is no different than WWE's previous ""countdown"" sets (""Top 50 Superstars"" & ""Best Of SmackDown"") where the incidents picked & order they are in won't please everyone so you just have to take it for what it's worth.  Now I'm not going to give you a list of the incidents because others already have (and some may not want to be spoiled) but I will tell you that the main highlight for this set is that this is not a ""TV-PG"" censored presentation meaning that you'll see the blood, no blurring when seeing Austin's middle fingers, and you'll hear MOST of the foul language. The documentary is strictly that countdown with highlights of each incident with comments from various WWE talents mixed in such as WWE director Kerwin Styles, David Otunga, Wade Barrett, C.M. Punk, Booker T, Jim Ross, Kofi Kingston, Evan Bourne, Daniel Bryan, Dolph Ziggler, The Miz, Curt Hawkings, Chris Masters, John Cena, William Regal, Santino Marella, Tyson Kidd, Todd Grisham, Matt Striker, JTG, Jerry Lawler, Zack Ryder, Drew McIntyre, and Scott Sanford.

Matches Include:
No Holds Barred Match: WWE Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Diesel - The buildup to this match was very unusual & different than what we've seen in WWE pre-Attitude Era as far as Diesel having a ""shoot"" persona where he openly acknowledged Vince McMahon as the owner instead of just the color commentator while threatening to come for him after the match based off his frustration of changing him into a ""corporate puppet"" while champion while Shawn was out for revenge for Diesel turning his back on him & attacking him with a chair.  HBK took the fight to Diesel right away showing his athleticism with a top rope moonsault to the outside while also showing he can get dirty too using a boot from the spanish announcer before Diesel took advantage of the match stipulation taking out anyone he felt got in his way & using weapons like a belt & chair while delivering to low blow before sending Shawn through the announce table that even Vince at ringside felt was going too far but both men continued to just use whatever they could get their hands on from a fire extinguisher, a chair, and something from wrestling legend Mad Dog Vachon at ringside that you have to see to believe.  I said this earlier in that this match was pre-Attitude Era & ECW was still not known to a national audience so it was rare to see this type of match using the weapons & punishment they gave each other during this time so this match was definitely a classic for it's time & still stands the test of time to this day.

[From The Vault: Shawn Michaels]

WWE Intercontinental Champion Hunter Hearst-Helmsley vs. Undertaker - For those who don't remember the original concept of Shotgun Saturday Night, WWE would hold wrestling matches in various nightclubs in New York City but this episode took place at Penn Station (a train station) and just like the traffic in New York, this was completely out of control with the referee getting nailed in the first minute followed by it being taken out of the ring resulting in a tombstone that didn't send him to hell but he was definitely sent crashing down.
""Shotgun Saturday Night"" Feb. '97

Hell In A Cell Match: Mankind vs. Undertaker - You knew this match was going to be special the moment both men started at the top of the cage where they brawled & almost fell through at one point before Mankind was thrown off the top with Jim Ross yelling his now infamous line ""GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY, THAT KILLED HIM! AS GOD AS MY WITNESS, HE'S BROKEN IN HALF!"" The match looked like it was over with Mankind being put on a stretcher with a dislocated shoulder before he decided to go back up only to be chokeslammed through the cage with the chair on top hitting him in the face on the way down. Taker ended up twisting his ankle coming down from the top as one person who came into the ring to check up on Foley ended up getting chokeslammed out of his shoes before they continued the match with Taker ramming the steps into Mankind's arm multiple times but missed a suicide dive that busted him open allowing Mankind to take advantage using the chair before bringing out a back full of thumbtacks. This was probably the most famous Hell In The Cell match & the match that launched Mick Foley into wrestling immortality for the beating he took from start to finish.

WWE Hardcore Champion Shane McMahon vs. Steve Blackman - This was only memorable for one thing...Shane McMahon's falling backward from the top of the SummerSlam stage. The rest of the match was just Blackman battling Test & Albert while Shane was trying to get his cheap shots in whenever he wasn't running away from Blackman.
SummerSlam '00
[WWF Hardcore]

T.L.C. Match: WWE Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Edge & Christian - The rematch from SummerSlam here at WrestleMania except this one also including each team's associates (Spike Dudley, Rhyno, Lita) getting in the action as well. You got all the crazy spots as expected here such as Bubba powerbombing Jeff onto Edge through a table, Christian falling off a ladder in the ring straight to the floor, Spike Dudley delivering a dudley dog off the apron through a table on the floor, Rhyno giving a gore through a table, various loud chairshots to the head, Jeff Hardy doing a swanton bomb off the highest ladder through a table & later attempting to walk on the ladders like a tightrope, Matt & Bubba falling out off the ladder through the stacked tables at ringside, and the highlight reel of Edge spearing Jeff while he was hanging from the tag titles that WWE used in promotional videos for years after this match. T.L.C. II followed the same patterns as their previous matches in that this was full of ""Holy S..."" moments one after another.
WrestleMania X-7
[The Ladder Match; Hardy Boyz: Leap Of Faith]

Street Fight Match: Kurt Angle vs. Shane McMahon - This match was one of the matches of the year as these two delivered such an amazing performance that it ended up injuring both men for at least a month afterwards such as Shane McMahon being constantly thrown into the glass stage walls that had no give resulting in him landing on his head. This had something for everyone's taste. Brawling, weapons, high impact moves, storytelling...and even some amateur wrestling. I consider this a lost classic that's not finally made it's way onto a DVD set.
King Of The Ring '01

WWE Championship Match vs. Big Show - Show dominated early using the steps on the outside along with power moves like the sidewalk slam while even using a half crab submission while Brock showcased his power with his offense like the german suplex although Brock's ribs were clearly hurt. Brock Lesnar was one of the people who is able to bring out the best quality that Big Show has based off their previous encounters but this was one of those cases where something had to give...but nobody expected WHAT did end up giving away.
""SmackDown"" Jume '03
[Brock Lesnar: Here Comes The Pain]

Concrete Crypt Match: Undertaker vs. Dudley Boyz - Wrestlecrap at it's finest as Undertaker for the most part beat up the WWE Tag Team Champions with Paul Heyman running his mouth non-stop for most of the match until the end when Taker won the match & scared off Heyman & ended up burying Paul Bearer in the concrete himself. This is one of those matches & moments that should be forgotten, not remembered.

WWE Champion John Cena vs. Edge - Edge earns his nickname ""the ultimate opportunist"" here as he cashed in his ""Money In The Bank"" at the right time to finally win the WWE Championship.
New Year's Revolution '06
[Edge: Decade Of Decadence; Satan's Prison: Elimination Chamber Anthology]

Hardcore Match vs. Mick Foley - Edge went on the offense right away using a cookie sheet & even executing a baseball slide into a road sign but it was when he attempted a spear that for some reason hurt himself more than Foley & causing his shoulder to bleed in the process as he revealed a strand of barbed wire wrapped around his waist underneath his flannel shirt. Foley continued to whip Edge across his bare back with the wire with Lita getting involved only for Foley to do his famous Cactus clothesline over the top rope with Lita on his back going over as well. They started to brawl on the outside with Foley thrown into the steps more than once & head whipped back onto the ramp before Foley own weapon of ""Barbie"" was used against him. Edge ended up taking more punishment of his own when he took a drop onto thumbtacks, a barbed wire ""Mr. Socko"" that Lita even felt the effects of, and ""Barbie"" resulting in Edge bleeding before he was able to give a spear to Foley that resulted in not only such a visual but also Mick Foley finally getting his ""WrestleMania Moment.""

(Blu-Ray) WWE Intercontinental Champion Jeff Hardy vs. Randy Orton - Don't let the title fool you because Randy Orton had no intentions of winning the Intercontinental Championship here but everything that happened after the match is more memorable here as we saw the biggest swanton bomb Hardy has ever given in WWE.
""RAW"" Jan. '08
[Jeff Hardy: My Life, My Rules]

(Blu-Ray) World Champion Edge vs. John Cena vs. Big Show - As usual, Cena had quite an entrance as it was an almost scary sight seeing that many John Cena's and I even joked with my friends saying that it was the ""Cena Clux Clan""...will the real Slim Shady please stand up? All three men put in a good performance here with various highlights featured the Guerrero's getting involved & Big Show putting in a dominate performance along with doing a classic Andre The Giant spot, and Cena showing strength lifting Edge & Show on his shoulders at the same time. This was one of those main events were it solid & had some fun moments that surpassed all the buildup going into it (thought the storyline was pretty weak myself) but it wasn't the best match each man has had against each other.
WrestleMania 25

(Blu-Ray) John Cena vs. C.M. Punk - Long before they would have their more famous battles over the WWE Championship, they met here in a match on RAW that's more famous for how they were in the wrong place at the wrong time as a group of rookies decided to make an impact that left a lasting impression.
""RAW"" June '10

Other DVD extras include outtakes of Jerry Lawler's comments on events, Roddy Piper cutting Haiti Kid's hair, Jake Roberts' snake biting Randy Savage, The Rockers' breakup on the Barber Shop, Stone Cold stuns Vince McMahon for the first time, Zamboni 3:16, Austin drives a beer truck into RAW, Big Boss Man at the funeral for Big Show's father, Kurt Angle's Milk Truck, Austin & Booker T brawling in a supermarket, Chris Jericho's Highlight Reel with Trish & Lita, Vince McMahon's limo explosion, and Jeff Hardy on The Cutting Edge on the Blu-Ray edition.

In the end, it was a good countdown as some moments made me laugh while others really made me go ""OMG!"" along with reminding me of some incidents I completely forgot about.  There are some DVD repeats on here but I'm not going to complain because some of the releases were so old (going back to almost a decade ago) that they needed to be put out there again to enjoy.  Some incidents I felt like shouldn't have been on here at all (Cena picking up Edge & Show wasn't that special to me plus did I need to be reminded of Tim White's suicide attempts?) & I personally wouldn't have put them in the order they did but at the same time, I'm glad incidents from the different eras of WWE were spread all throughout the countdown from top to bottom.  It's a good highlight reel which was the point of this presentation so it's something I would recommend...just wish they would have let Joey Styles host the set as this is his catchphrase.",1314748800,18,12304,4.626660558863949
4509906,4,B004ZKKKU6,"This is a high-quality WWE production and all is as stated except for the rating. The Amazon listing says ""PG"" but the rating on the packaging says ""TV 14 V"" - the V is mostly for the blood in the hardcore matches. The content on this collection is much more adult, edgy & bloody than the current TV product. All is good if that's what you're wanting, but if you're buying this for preteen WWE fans the sexual content, edgy humor (the Snitsky baby kick bit, ass-kissing in the ring segments and Tim White suicide skits in particular) plus the blood might be more than you're expecting.",1314576000,,585,4.4766355140186915
4509907,4,B004ZKKKU6,"First...the negative...the ""OMG!"" jingle in between each moment gets VERY annoying. That and the fact that the only people commenting on the incidents are the jobbers, sans CM PUNK. Curt Hawkins, Tyson Kidd, JTG, Santino, Regal...half these ppl aren't even employed by WWE. Why couldn't they get Rock, Austin, HHH, or even a few ppl that were even involved in these incidents.
Now the positives...no censorship. They showed the uncut incidents...swearing, violence, BLOOD. Its about damn time! I mean it's a DVD. It's not tv. You don't have to go to black and white when there's a little blood.
Bravo WWE...thank you for not PG-ing this release.",1314057600,8,645,5.037383177570093

4509978,3,B004ZKKKU6,"So this WWE release showcases the top 50 moments of WWF/WWE history... but take note that it is only WWF/WWE history, so do not expect to see anything involving WCW, NWA, ECW or any other promotions history of events that WWE now owns.

It's expected that certain events that really made people say OMG, but are not exactly shining moments in wrestling history, are not included in this top 50. As well as certain wrestlers never to be mentioned again not making the cut of some moments of the past that did make people scream OMG. But the chosen 50 moments is a decent selection, as well as a few selections that they probably could have found better moments than those to show. The selection for what it is, is OK, however the order they are shown in can be debatable as to why something is a high number, and one of the lower numbers is supposedly better than that? However, that is always expected.

However there is a couple of things that really brought this DVD down. Firstly, the god awful music they picked that sings out ""OMG"". It was torture to my ears at the beginning of the DVD, and yup, you guessed it, it's played another 49 times throughout the whole program. Secondly what was annoying was that they show a clip of what happened, then they have someone talk about there memory of it. Now, I didn't mind Jerry Lawler's comments, he was at least there... but a half a dozen or more wrestlers with the company today are giving there thoughts and memories on something they where not apart of. This annoys me, as I hate this type of stupid visual commentary that seemed to have started with ""The Weakest Link"" and has grown into something so irritating to watch someone give their thoughts on something they had nothing to do with. I wouldn't bother listening to a historians commentary on a DVD movie of Charlie Chaplin, nor would I want to watch Star Wars with some random no-body who thinks he knows everything about Star Wars doing commentary over something. For one, it's just the same old boring thing over and over, things like ""Oh, it was so cool"", ""I was sitting at home watching at the time..."", ""My friends and I thought this and that""... WHO CARES? You reserve commentary for those involved in what happened to shed more light or insight into whats playing for those interested in it... why would anyone care less about hearing where someone was when they saw this on TV, who they where with, just for them to smile and say, ""Oh, I Remember that. It was awesome""... sorry, but that ruins any video, WWE, or not. I just don't give a monkeys rear end what someone like Brian Daniels thought about something that happened WAY before he was even a wrestler. Just because you are part of the WWE now, doesn't mean anyone could care less about what you thought of something that happened in the WWE 20 years ago. If they couldn't interview the people involved directly... then don't have their comments at all. It's a waste of time.

Another thing that brings the whole thing down is Kay Fab. Some moments where picked, and the interviews are talking like this actually happened and was not planned, it's an insult to wrestling fans intelligence. Yes, we know events like the Montreal Screw Job was 100% real... but talking about Hogan vs Andre like it was too... get real. Cherish the moment of entertainment, but don't try to claim it was a controversial moment in history. God, this is not Tony Shaviani on WCW, so don't claim every week and every match is controversial.

One more thing brought this thing down for me.. as a huge DX fan, i'm yet to actually see the WWE release the entire, full length, uncut version of the DX invasion on WCW. On disc 2 and 3 of these set, you get the full length, or most of the event of what is in the top 50 moments presented on disc 1. However, there is no full length or even short length footage of the DX invasion. It's a damn shame, because the snippets of it that get released on WWE videos have done it no justice as to how funny and brilliant it was when it first aired in it's entirety. Not even the first DX video showed it all, and I am still anxious to see it all once again in better quality than someones shoddy and blurry VHS recording on Youtube. Even most of those videos have been removed from there now and the only ones you can find are the edited versions from other WWE releases.

Overall... it's ok for one viewing. A couple of matches are worth keeping on discs 2 and 3, however you most likely already have them in some form or another on other WWE released videos. There where a couple of things on here that I had not seen before, but then again, there where a few things I never wished to see again too.",1364947200,3,4692,4.425925925925926
4509979,3,B004ZKKKU6,The movie was entertaining.  I was good to see some old wrestlers from the WWC.  If you rent it you will enjoy seeing some of your favorite wrestlers.,1363651200,,150,4.321428571428571
4509980,3,B004ZKKKU6,"I watched this through my prime membership and was happy I didn't have to pay for it...but even though I watched for free I still can't give it more than 3 stars.

Spoilers ahead: Look about half of the moments are great.  Some of them I missed because I was watching WCW at the time and some I missed because Is topped watching wrestling and of course some I saw along the way...certain things belong on a disc called ""OMG"".  Things like Mick Foley's fall, the screwjob, the spear from the ladder, Hardy's dive onto Orton, Shane falling from the Smackdown sign, etc.  However, some of this stuff was just crap - Mae Young's birth of a hand, Stone Cold supermarket brawl, Stone Cold hospital room attack, the milk truck, etc.  And throughout most of the interviewers talk like this is real/a shoot which I find horribly distracting.

In the end this is strictly a slightly below average to average disc...if Amazon allowed for half numbers I would have given it 2 1/2 stars.",1363392000,,974,4.568965517241379

4509994,3,B004ZKKKU6,"This is a pretty good DVD with some rarely seen footage, but I wish WWE would retire the 1998 King of the Ring HIAC match footage. It's on 'Mick Foley's Greatest Hits and Misses', it's on 'A History of the Undertaker', it's on 'Hell in a Cell' DVD and I can understand it being on those DVDs but I have all three of those and now OMG! has it too. I'm not saying it wasn't a shocking and amazing match, it's one of my favorites for the simple fact that Mick continued the match after his fall. But come on, WWE, do you have to find a way to include it on any DVD about shocking things? Or, you could've included it in the documentary because it was shocking, but not include the match in the special because I can't be the only person who now has multiple DVDs with that match on it.",1339027200,,782,4.084415584415584
4509995,1,B004ZKKKU6,this dvd is not worth buying its boring dull and yes annoying and it makes my ears bleed the wwe is going nowhere since it has since gone down the pg rated era when it was the wwf and it was the attitude era the wwf had its run and now its all about familys and kids show its no longer a real wrestling business its now pg rated crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1333670400,3,353,4.057142857142857

While most of the selected footage is appropriate, the commentary on them IS NOT!  They are talking about these incidents like a full blown shoot!  The Hebner/Hogan/Andre angle is discussed as though a real conspiracy took place!  That's insulting the fan's intelligence.  Perhaps they're trying to protect the business again since more kids are fans but who knows.  Total bomb!",1330300800,3,506,5.0120481927710845
4509997,3,B004ZKKKU6,"The 2 hour special was honestly very good. It lived up to exactly what it was and that was the best OMG moments. It covers from the 80s all the way to 2010 so it's a good spread, some moments we'd figure would surely make the set along with moments that I didn't think would make it onto the set. (And moments like Lunchtime suicide that should not have been on the list lol)

But the 2 discs of extras are all moments and matches that are already on numerous dvds. Not to mention the whole video is done in the ""slightly bootlegged quality"" of video. Not bad, but not the best either.",1328918400,2,585,4.176991150442478

4510002,3,B004ZKKKU6,"Let me first off start by saying that with a countdown u are never going to please everybody.  Each person is unique and each person has in their mind what they feel should be number for the top 50 incidents in wwe history.  I did like the countdown but there were some things I thought could have been left out and some things I thought should have been in the countdown.  Like I said though, u can't please everybody.  The countdown begins with Hulk Hogan seeing double against Andre the Giant at The Main Event when Hogan lost the title and the twin refs show up.  Pretty good angle.  Afterwards we get the Nexus invading, Big Show chokeslamming Taker thru the ring on Raw, the backlot brawl at wm 12 which I feel didn't belong, the snake in the present box at Macho Man and Elizabeth's wedding reception courtesy of Jake Roberts, John Cena lifting both Big Show and Edge up on his back at Wrestlemania 25, the stupid concrete crypt match at Great American Bash 2004 where Taker buried Paul Bearer in concrete, DX invading WCW, the New Age Outlaws putting Terry Funk and Catcus Jack in a dumpster and pushing them off the stage, Triple H and the escalator, Mr McMahon introducing us to new GM Eric Bischoff, in a very tasteless spot we see Tim White committing ""suicide"", Randy Orton being dumped on thumbtacks at Backlash 2004, the unholy wedding with Taker and Stephanie McMahon, Shawn Michaels and Diesel using Mad Dog Vachon's artifical leg at In Your House, Haiti Kid getts his hair cut, Vince McMahon gets attacked by Austin in the hospital, Jeff Jarrett cracking Fabulous Moolah over the head with his guitar, Edge cashing in his Money in the Bank against John Cena, Kurt Angle spraying WCW and ECW with milk, the McMahon kiss my ass club, Jeff Hardy pyro malfunction, Austin blowing up the DX bus, Triple H's wedding to Stephanie in Vegas, another tasteless spot with Snitsky punting a ""baby"", the spot where Austin dumps concrete in Vince's corvette, the cobra biting Macho Man, Shane McMahon's fall at Summerslam 2000, The Rockers break up on the Barber Shop, Edge spearing Jeff Hardy off the ladder at Wrestlemania 17, Kane setting JR on fire, Austin stuns McMahon, Kurt Angle and Shane McMahon's street fight at King of the Ring 2001, Jeff Hardy's swanton off the Titan Tron, Edge spearing Mick Foley through a burning table at Wrestlemania 22, Austin arrives on a Zamboni, Roddy Piper hitting Jimmy Snuka with a coconut, WWE buying WCW, Mae Young getting powerbombed off the stage, Big Show's daddy's funeral, the infamous Montreal Screwjob, Big Show and Brock Lesnar break ring, when Tyson and Austin met, Vince McMahon's limo blows up after Mr McMahon's appreciation day, Sable's ""binkini"" at Fully Loaded 1998, Jimmy Snuka's dive off the cage on Don Muraco, the spot with Brian Pillman pulling the gun on Steve Austin, when Austin gives the Corporation a beer bath and finally Mick Foley and the Undertaker's Hell in a Cell match at King of the Ring.  Pretty good countdown but could have been better.  Disc 2 and 3 had matches and moments.  The moments from disc 2 are:  Piper giving Haiti Kid a haircut which is more funny then an OMG moment.  I don't think one deserves to be on here.  Jake Roberts turning the cobra loose on Macho Man and having him bite Macho is freaking good.  I remember seeing this as a kid and just being scared to death for Macho.  This is a great choice.  When the Rockers split is next and was very good as well.  It was kind of dark for the WWE in those days and that's why I liked it.  You get the full segment when Austin stuns McMahon and this is a great one as well to include.  Up next is when Austin arrives to the ring in a Zamboni and then leaps over the top rope and onto Vince.  Great moment.  Then we get another classic where Austin comes to the ring in a beer truck to confront Vince, Shane and Rock and proceeds to give them a beer bath.  Awesome moment.  Lastly of the moments is the funeral for Big Show's father on Smackdown and this was just stupid.  I did like the matches from Disc 2.  The first one was Shawn Michaels vs Diesel for the WWE title in a No Holds Barred match at In Your House.  Great match with some very good spots although I did think that the use of Mad Dog Vachon's leg was pushing it just a bit.  The next match is when Triple H took on the Undertaker at Shotgun Saturday Night and this one isn't that great so really don't waste your time.  The next match is one that has been released all the time:  The Hell in a Cell match with Mick Foley and Undertaker at King of the Ring 1998.  I've discussed this match on other DVD reviews and will not do it again.  It's a good match and if you haven t seen it yet then where have u been?  Lastly, on disc 2 we get the Hardcore title match with Steve Blackman and Shane McMahon at Summerslam 2000.  This is a pretty good match and may very well be the only time we get to see Blackman on a DVD set.  I think really though the only reason to watch is the fall from Shane.  Disc 3's moments are:  Kurt Angle spraying milk all over the WCW/ECW regime which is kind of a copy of the beer bath but it was still cool, when Austin and Booker T brawled at the grocery store which is kind of dumb, the highlight reel with Trish and Lita is ok, the whole Mr McMahon appreciate night which is ok and some Jerry Lawler outtakes.  The matches are good as we begin with the TLC II match at Wrestlemania 17.  Great match lots of high spots and just all around good fun.  It's easy to see how this match did win Match of the Year.  We also get the Kurt Angle/Shane McMahon street fight from King of the Ring 2001.  This match is like a movie as it builds and builds and builds to one awesome conclusion.  As a side note, just think to yourself:  How is Shane McMahon still alive? after seeing this one.  We get the Brock Lesnar vs Big Show match from Smackdown in 2003.  Really this match is ok but the only reason to watch is when the ring explodes under the weight of these two.  You do get the Concrete Crypt match with Undertaker taking on both Dudley's.  Stupid concept and even dumber match.  We also get to see Edge cashing in his MitB briefcase against John Cena at New Year's Revolution in a great 20 second match.  Waste of time.  Lastly, we get the WM 22 match with Edge and Mick Foley going at it.  Fantastic way to end the DVD set and just a really good match from both.  Again a pretty good DVD set that could have been better.  Some things I would have liked to have seen is:  Sgt Slaughter whipping Bob Backlund, Ricky Steamboat getting his throat squashed by Macho Man and the Ring Bell, the dozen chairshots taken by Mick Foley at Royal Rumble 1999, Steve Austin being hit by the car at Survivor Series 1999, how about when Kane unmasked, the story with Mark Henry and the transvestite, the Kat exposing her puppies for everyone at Armaggedon 1999, when Earthquake sat on and killed Damien in front of Jake Roberts, the breaking of kayfabe in MSG with the Clique, that kick to Shawn Michaels's head by Owen Hart on Raw, what about Owen's death (to me what should have been number 1 but didn't even make the list), Mae Young giving birth to a hand, Val Venis getting his u know what choppy chopped by Kaientai, when Rick Martel blinded Jake Roberts, that shooting star from Brock Lesnar at Wrestlemania 19, ECW invading WWE in 1997 and when the Undertaker put the Ultimate Warrior inside a coffin and left him there.  These are just things I would have liked to have seen on the list.  Like I said you can't please us all.",1323993600,,7555,4.373209169054442

Almost 50 years in existence, countless hours of programming and tons of jaw dropping and shocking moments and matches and now WWE has produced a countdown of 50 of the most shocking, awe-inspiring moments in their history. With comments from various WWE superstars and personnel, we have a set of clips and moments that is of course filled with controversy but more often than not entertaining (with the exception of the extremely irritating ""Oh My God"" beat that plays before every clip).

Disc 1

#50, 2/5/88, Seeing Double: On Saturday Night's Main Event it was the Wrestlemania III rematch between Hulk Hogan and Andre The Giant for the WWE title. Thanks to a referee being paid off by The Million Dollar Man Ted DiBiase, Andre won the title then gave it to DiBiase. Nice how they had both Dave & Earl Hebner in the clip, which is a good one.

#49, 6/7/10, Nexus is Here: During the Raw main event of CM Punk vs. John Cena, the NXT Season 1 rookies made a shocking appearance and laid waste to both Punk & Cena as well as the ringside crew and the ring itself. Great moment.

#48, 6/7/99, Chokeslam to Hell: When Undertaker faced The Big Show on Raw, the end of the match resulted in one of the most devasting chokeslams in history as Taker was thrown through thr ring. Good memorable moment.

#47, 3/31/96, Backlot Brawl: At Wrestlemania XII Roddy Piper faced Goldust first in a back alley, then after a car chase they both fight into the arena and Piper beats up Goldie in the ring. Nice clip.

#46, 9/7/91, Wedding Surprise: On an episode of Superstars during the Randy Savage/Miss Elizaebth wedding celebration as they were unwrapping gifts they got an unwanted gift in the form of a king cobra courtesy of Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts. Very good one here.

#45, 4/5/09, Cena's Feat of Strength: At the silver anniversary of Wrestlemania there was a Triple Threat Match for the WWE title between Edge, John Cena and The Big Show. During this match Cena lifted both Show & Edge onto his shoulders in what was truly a major feat of strength. Average one for this countdown though.

#44, 6/27/04, Concrete Crypt: Undertaker beat the Tag Champions, prevented Paul Heyman from burying Taker's manager Paul Bearer in cement, but then buried Bearer himself. A true OMG (in a bad way) clip.

#43, 4/27/98, DX Invades WCW: After WWE had finally reached the top of the ratings war two weeks before, WWE took the fight to Turner's organization by sending DX to the arena Nitro was being taped at. Pretty goofy segment here.

#42, 2/2/98, Dumpster Stage Dive: While Cactus Jack and Terry Funk had a match that spilled onto the stage and ended in a dumpster. Enter Billy Gunn & Road Dogg who pushed the stage, which was modestly shocking.

#41, 12/13/01, Grocery Store Attack: On Smackdown Stone Cold attacked Booker T in a supermarket, which was easily one of the best moments in recent memory. So funny and entertaining, one of the last great things Stone Cold did as an active competitor.

#40, 2/8/97, Triple H Meets Escalator: On an episode of Shotgun Saturday Night, Undertaker faced Triple H and Hunter got the tombstoned onto the top of the escalator and ended up riding it all the way down. Not a bad one, but average.

#39, '05, Tim White Ends It All: In one of the more tasteless things WWE ever did (and that covers a lot of ground), former referee Tim White is all down about never being able to referee again and tries taking his own life in a bunch of different ways. Honestly this one was pretty bad and not in a good way.

 #38, 7/15/02, New Raw GM: Vince McMahon promised to shake things up and he did by hiring his former hated enemy Eric Bischoff as the General Manager of Raw. Loved this one.

#37, 4/18/04, Orton Thumbtacks: In a No Holds Barred Match against Mick Foley, Randy Orton went for an RKO but it was countered and Orton went back first into a pile of tacks. One word: Ouuuuccchhhhh!!!!!

#36, 4/26/99, Unholy Wedding: On Raw Undertaker attempted to wed Stephanie McMahon but Stone Cold broke up the ceremony and saved Stephanie, which was a tad shocking to say the least.

#35, 4/28/96, Mad Dog Vachon Loses Leg: Shawn Michaels & Diesel fought a war in April of '96, Diesel attacked hall of famer Mad Dog Vachon, even taking off his fake leg and attempted to use it on Michaels. I guess this was shocking, but kind of unnecessary.

#34, 3/7/86, Haiti Kid Gets A Haircut: On an episode of Piper's Pit, Roddy shaved the head of the midget wrestler while Bob Orton held Haiti back. Funny stuff.

#33, 10/5/98, Hospital Visiting Hours: After suffering a busted leg, Vince McMahon was in the hospital and was visited by Mankind (who introduced Mr. Socko) then Stone Cold came in disguised as a doctor and proceeded to beat Vince senseless. Funny stuff here.

#32, 9/9/99, A Classic Hit: During his last run in WWE Jeff Jarrett decided to target some of the women past and present in wrestling, on this night the woman was hall of famer The Fabulous Moolah. After she insulted him, he hit her with a massive guitar shot.

#31, 1/8/06, Edge Cashes In Money In The Bank: After winning a brutal Elimination Chamber match to retain his WWE title, John Cena was faced with another challenger in Edge who cashed in the briefcase and became the champion, in shocking fashion.

#30, 8/20/01, Got Milk?: Kurt Angle surprised the Alliance, driving a milk truck into the arena and dousing the superstars in milk, including Stone Cold (much like Austin did to the McMahon's and The Rock a couple of years before). Not a bad one.

#29, Kiss My Ass Club: Vince McMahon established a new club where various superstars were forced to kiss his.... well you know. Funny stuff here.

#28, 1/16/09, Jeff Hardy's Pyro Goes Bad: During his entrance for his match Jeff's pyro malfunctioned and he was ""burned"" by it. Its an eh type of moment.

#27, 4/27/00, Austin Blows Up The DX Bus: On Smackdown Steve Austin promised he would be there and he was as he dropped a steel beam onto the DX bus which blew it up.

#26, 11/29/99, Wedding In Vegas: As Test and Stephanie looked to tie the knot, Triple H appeared and showed some footage of him and Steph (who was out cold) getting married in Vegas. This would lead to the McMahon/Helmsley regime beginning a month later.

#25, 11/8/04, Snitsky Punts Baby: After Snitsky had burst onto the scene a couple of months back, causing Lita to lose her baby, then beating Kane in a match at Taboo Tuesday. He then appeared in the ring on Raw and punted a ""baby"" into the crowd.

#24, 10/12/98, Concrete Corvette: Vince drove himself into the arena on Raw in a beautiful corvette, Austin brought a cement truck in and filled the car with the contents. Nice segment.

#23, 11/23/91, Snake Bites Macho Man: On Superstars Randy Savage ran to the ring and jake Roberts attacked him, tied him in the ropes and Jake's king cobra latched onto Macho's arm and wouldn't let go. Loved this one.

#22, 8/27/00, Shane McMahon, Daredevil: At Summerslam 2000, Shane O'Mac & Steve Blackman faced off and Shane took a massive plunge off the side of the video wall about 50 feet in fact. Again one word: Ooouuuuchh!!!

#21, 1/11/92, Barber Shop Window: Years of friendship and as tag team partners ended when Shawn Michaels put Marty Jannetty through a window face first.

#20, 4/1/01, Edge Spears Jeff: On the grand stage of Wrestlemania in the TLC match, Jeff Hardy was hanging from the steel cables trying to get the title belts, but Edge climbed a ladder and hit a massive spear as both tumbled to the mat.

#19, 7/14/03, Kane Sets JR On Fire: This was about a month after he was unmasked, where Kane ended up setting J.R. on fire. Cheesy but fun stuff.

#18, 9/22/97, Stone Cold Stuns Mr. McMahon: Austin and Vince faced off in the ring, where after Steve agreed to work within the system he stunned the chairman, which set off a fantastic rivalry that would go on for years.

#17, 6/24/01, Kurt and Shane Battle: In at Street Fight these two battled in and out of the ring and had a couple of OMG moments.

#16, 1/14/08, Jeff Swanton Off The Tron: On Raw before the Royal Rumble, Jeff would make a statement by climbing at least 25 feet high and hit a huge swanton.

#15, 4/2/06, Edge Spears Foley: In a hardcore match at Wrestlemania 22, it was a great one that had an awesome finish as Edge speared Foley through a flaming table on the outside.

#14, 9/28/98, Stone Cold Zamboni: Taker & Kane were about to be awarded the WWE title by Vince, when Austin crashed the party in a zamboni, drove it to the ring and dived off of it onto McMahon.

#13, 7/17/84, Piper Hits Snuka With A Coconut: Probably one of the top 3 moments in Piper's Pit history as Roddy hit Jimmy with a coconut shot that knocked Snuka into the staging and out cold.

#12, 3/26/01, WWE Buys WCW: The Monday Night Wars came to an end as Vince finally bought WCW, but Shane McMahon ended up buying WCW and then this led to the Alliance storyline (ugh).

#11, Unbreakable Mae Young: So many odd and strange moments from Mae Young from over the years including Bubba Ray Dudley powerbombing her from the stage through a table.

#10, 11/11/99, Big Show's Father's Funeral: While at the funeral for his father, the Big Bossman appeared and ended up dragging the casket away while Show was on it.

#9, 11/9/97, Montreal Screwjob: Champion Bret Hart didn't want to lose in Canada on what was to be his final night in the WWE, so when Shawn Michaels had Bret in the sharpshooter, Vince ordered the bell to be rung thus becoming the infamous screwjob finish.

#8, 7/12/03, Big Show & Brock Lesnar Break The Ring: At the conclusion of a match between Big Show & Brock Lesnar, Brock hit a superplex on Show that broke the ring and shocked the announcers and the crowd.

#7, 1/19/98, Tyson & Austin: On Raw we had a face/off between boxer Mike Tyson and Stone Cold, which led to a memorable boiling point that launched the WWE to bigger heights.

#6, 6/11/07, Mr. McMahon's Limo Blows Up: On Mr. McMahon Appreciation Night, Vince seemed to be in such a weird mood as he walked to the ring, said nothing and walked backstage and out of the arena. Once he got into his limo, it exploded. But of course we never got to see the conclusion of this storyline thanks to a certain terrible act by a certain wrestler that forced WWE to go PG.

#5, 7/26/98, Sable's Handprints: This was the launching point for Sable's major push in WWE as she revealed she was wearing next to nothing with handprints on her chest.

#4, 10/17/83, Snuka Off The Steel Cage: After he failed to beat Don Muraco for the I.C. title, Snuka took a dive off the top of the cage onto Muraco, in what was truly an all time great moment.

#3, 11/4/96, Pillman's Got A Gun: This was at Pillman's home where he wanted to do an interview talking about how Austin will pay for breaking his ankle. Steve of course shows up, breaks in the house and the infamous gun scene is shown and the footage gets cut off. Pretty tense for that time period.

#2, 3/22/99, Beer Bath: On the Raw before Wrestlemania XV, Stone Cold drove a beer truck into the arena then sprayed Rock, Shane & Vince McMahon with beer. Great one here.

#1, 6/28/98, Mankind Thrown Off The Cell: Easily one of the most memorable moments ever in WWE history as The Undertaker threw Mick Foley off of the top of the Hell In A Cell structure. This immortalized Foley as a legend in the eyes of the wrestling fans.

Matches on Disc 1

-4/28/96-In Your House: Good Friends, Better Enemies-No Holds Barred for the WWF Title, Shawn Michaels (Champion) vs. Diesel: Very good hardcore match, probably one of Kevin Nash's (Diesel) best matches of his career. Liked the David vs. Goliath concept as after Shawn beat on Diesel for the first couple of minutes, Diesel dominates the rest of the match for the most part. Diesel uses plenty of power moves of Shawn and then he chokes out Shawn with a belt and even hangs him from over the top rope. Diesel even jack-knife power bombs Michaels through the announce table, you can even hear Vince telling Shawn to stop that it's not worth it, saying ""Let it be over."" Diesel grabs the fake leg of Mad Dog Vashon (of AWA fame) who was at ringside, and tried to hit Shawn with it but he ducks and starts hitting Diesel with offensive moves and then uses the fake leg and after a bit, he hits Sweet Chin Music on Diesel to retain the WWF Title. 11/10.

-2/8/97, Shotgun Saturday Night, Intercontinental Championship Match, Hunter Hearst-Helmsley (Champion) vs. The Undertaker: Glad they decided to start putting SSN matches on DVD as the locations were always unique and this match while short isn't a bad one. Once the ref gets taken out, Hunter uses the title belt to knock down the big man then starts kicking and choking him out on the ring ropes. Taker sits up after a neckbreaker, then uses the title belt on Hunter which causes a DQ. 5/10. Of course the more famous part was the tombstone on the escalator shortly after.

-6/28/98, King of the Ring, Hell In A Cell Match, The Undertaker vs. Mankind: Without question the most famous cell match in history. Mankind takes a huge fall from the top through the announce table in the first couple of minutes, after some time he comes back up the aisle and climbs the cage, takes a chokeslam through the ceiling of the cage and almost blacks out from the fall and a chair smashing him in the face. Pretty brutal action as there's thumbtacks, blood and a tombstone that puts Mankind down for the 3 count. 10/10. I do like that the post match ovation was included as the crowd cheered big for Foley.

-8/27/00, Summerslam, Hardcore Championship Match, Shane McMahon (Champion) vs. Steve Blackman: The action starts off good and quickly goes into the crowd, then back to the ring and Steve beats up on Shane until Test & Albert come into the ring, so Blackman had to try and fight off three men, throughout all this is some good weapon usage. Steve finally got his hands on Shane, who climbed up the side of the titan tron. Blackman followed and after a few cane shots Shane fell 50 feet to the floor, then Steve jumped off landing on Shane and covered him to win the hardcore title. 8/10.

Matches on Disc 2

-4/1/01, Wrestlemania X-7, TLC II Match For The World Tag Team Championship, The Dudley Boyz (Champions) vs. Edge & Christian vs. The Hardy Boyz: It told a better story than the first one as all three teams got some great spots in, Rhyno, Spike Dudley and Lita all made appearances. Of course there was the Edge spearing Jeff spot, but also Jeff hitting a big swanton onto Rhyno and Spike through two tables, Bubba Ray and Matt Hardy taking a huge fall from a ladder to the outside through four tables and so many others. Rhyno helps Edge & Christian get the tag belts as they become the champions. Great match here, 10/10.

-6/24/01, King of the Ring, Street Fight, Kurt Angle vs. Shane McMahon: After wrestling two matches earlier Kurt faced Shane in this fantastic and amazing fight as there was some good mat wrestling, plenty of weapons used. After a suplex on the floor broke Kurt's tailbone, he had to hit multiple belly to belly suplexes as he drove Shane through two glass windows at the entrance way. Back in the ring, Shane makes a comeback even hitting a variation of the Angle Slam but this was Kurt's night as he used a plank of wood to set up a huge Angle Slam off the top rope and made the cover to win. 11/10.

-6/12/03, Smackdown, WWE Championship Match, Brock Lesnar (Champion) vs. The Big Show: This was a good main event to the end the show, but it's basically the same as other matches they've had before. Man, those chops from Show sound like they hurt. The finish comes when Big Show goes to the top rope, Lesnar follows and superplexes Show down to the mat, which causes the ring to implode, thus ending the match in a no contest. Major league pop for the finish, 9/10, for the finish mainly.

-6/27/04, Great American Bash, Concrete Crypt Match, The Undertaker vs. The Dudley Boyz: The story here was if Taker didn't do as general manager Paul Heyman commanded then Paul Bearer would be buried in a concrete crypt. Honestly this match was crap at best, while the Dudley's got in some offense, Taker just beat down the tag team champions. The constant yelling by Heyman was irritating beyond words and the match was pretty much garbage and Taker nailed the tombstone to win the match. 2/10. The segment post match where Taker could've saved Paul Bearer but didn't honestly made no sense to me.

-1/8/06, New Year's Revolution, WWE Championship Match, John Cena (Champion) vs. Edge: Right after the Elimination Chamber match, Edge appeared and cashed in his Money In The Bank briefcase. It doesn't take long after the match begins for Edge to hit the spear and cover Cena to win his first WWE title. 6/10, for the shock factor.

-4/2/06, Wrestlemania 22, Hardcore Match, Edge vs. Mick Foley: This has a really big match feel and it delivered as both men took it to each other, using weapons like barbwire, street signs, a barbwire bat and even a flaming table. Pretty sick spot where Foley whips Edge with some barbwire. This was likely Foley's last great match in WWE and what a way to make a Wrestlemania moment as Edge speared Foley through a flaming table on the outside and made the pin for the win. 10/10.

Blu-Ray Exclusive Matches

-1/14/08, Raw, WWE Intercontinental Championship Match, Jeff Hardy (Champion) vs. Randy Orton: Really this was just a backdrop for Orton to get his hands on and take out Hardy before their match at the Royal Rumble. It quickly ends as Randy hits a low blow causing a DQ, the aftermath had some good brawling but was more memorable with Jeff hitting the biggest swanton in his WWE career onto Orton. 7/10, for the aftermath.

-4/5/09, Wrestlemania 25, Triple Threat Match for the World Heavyweight Championship, Edge (Champion) vs. John Cena vs. The Big Show: Good entrances by all three including the usual over the top type from Cena and it wasn't a bad match, all three got some good moves in as well as chances to shine. Show was dominate at points, Edge picked his spots and Cena showed his strength lifting both Show and Edge on his shoulders. John of course ends up picking up the win here to become the champion, again. 7/10.

-6/7/10, Raw, Viewer's Choice Match, John Cena vs. CM Punk: Very good and competitive match here between both men, but its more memorable for the NXT Season 1 rookies appearing at ringside and making their mark by destroying Cena, Punk, the announcers, the ring crew and the ring. The crowd was in absolute shock to say the least. 10/10, for the post match beatdown.

While obviously a controversial DVD release as some of the moments could've been shifted around or some left off completely this was a pretty good set of moments. The matches and segments are well worth watching and I was so thrilled to see segments like the supermarket brawl in full and matches like the King of the Ring street fight and the Viewer's choice match included as well.",1317600000,13,19936,4.588400900900901
4510009,2,B004ZKKKU6,"This would have been a very good DVD release if not for the incredibly annoying, hip-hop tinged intonation of ""Oh My God"" in between every single segment!

The segments themselves were pretty good and thankfully there was no censorship, but I just had a really hard time getting past what has to be the most annoying theme music of all time being played between every segment.",1317081600,2,436,4.64935064935065
