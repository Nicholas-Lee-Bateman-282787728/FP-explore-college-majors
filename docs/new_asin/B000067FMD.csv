1714696,5,B000067FMD,"I was very impressed with the quality and instruction in this video. While I would have liked some more in depth instruction on some of the fundamentals in the video, the video is meant as an introduction to the basics of pitching and it does that very well.",1212537600,,258,4.395833333333333
1714697,4,B000067FMD,This DVD is great. I did not know anything about windmill softball pitching. My daughter and I watched it together and it was explained in a common sense step by step procedure. I highly recommend this to any beginning softball pitchers.,1212192000,,237,4.804878048780488
1714698,3,B000067FMD,"I bought this to help my 10 yr old pitch.  It is a good starter in the absence of no material.  The problem I have with this dvd is the material doesn't cover enough trouble shooting.  My daughter's form developed very nicely thanks in part to this dvd but her accuracy wasn't improving and there wasn't much if any advice on the cause.

I then purchased Windmill Pitching 101 by Nancy Evans.  The cost is twice as much but it is also over two times longer and is much much better in instructing, and adds more clarity than this dvd.  Also Better drill exercises and superior troubleshooting.",1209859200,,592,4.485981308411215
1714699,5,B000067FMD,Very informative on the basic fundamentals of pitching.  Many coaches have viewed this video and found it extremely helpful when trying to start young girls out pitching.,1181174400,,170,5.296296296296297
1714700,4,B000067FMD,"This video is fairly informative, however, I don't go for the robotics type training.  I have trouble getting my students, who have started with this type of training, to get into the reality of pitching.

I pitched fastpitch softball for over 35 years and I wouldn't recommend the robotics type of beginning.",1170028800,2,309,4.923076923076923
1714701,4,B000067FMD,Bob Todd does a good job in this video showing the basics of windmill pitching. He shows the process step by step and explains each step very clearly. My daughter watched the video (as has a friend of mine's daughter) and both learned a great deal about how to throw a windmill pitch in softball.,1144368000,,296,4.4
1714702,5,B000067FMD,I will immediatly use this with my young pitchers. The coach is clear and concise. He breaks down each step and then puts it all together. I highly recommend this DVD!,1143072000,7,167,4.419354838709677
1714703,5,B000067FMD,"This video is truly worth the asking price.  In a few minutes of watching the video, my 10 year old daughter went from not being able to reach home plate from the pitchers mound to being able to reasonably throw pitch after pitch over the plate at speed.  The techniques are simple and easy to emulate.  The video shows the things to do correctly and also the things to NOT DO and trouble areas.  It is geared towards both older and younger players with no experience.  My 10 year old watches it daily and then runs outside to try what she just learned.  It is a world-class coach in a box.  Unlike many sports training tapes this video is long and filled with key tips.  It is not just 12 minutes of a single tip leading you to another tape to get the other techniques.  This video stands alone.  Well worth the money a dozen times over!",1122940800,17,838,4.280254777070064
1714704,3,B000067FMD,"Excellent information for the beginner.  However, for the price it was too short.  It needs more information,",1115337600,7,109,5.352941176470588
7962654,5,B000067FMD,Just what I'm looking for,1466121600,,25,4.2
7962655,4,B000067FMD,Very informative and useful to help our daughter with learning how to become a pitcher for her softball recreational team.,1453507200,,122,5.15
7962656,5,B000067FMD,Great video on the basics and drills to enhance the performance of young pitchers,1434240000,,81,4.857142857142857
7962657,4,B000067FMD,"As some others have noted, this is not your fancy shmancy video, it is your basic teaching of the correct mechanics of softball pitching. I bought it for my 9 year-old grand daughter. It is for beginners and does an excellent job of clearly explaining and demonstrating the basics of the ""windmill"" pitching motion. Why would anyone want something more for a beginner?",1402963200,,368,4.857142857142857
7962658,5,B000067FMD,"I bought this video 8 years ago.  At the time I was a volunteer coach at a recreation park and needed a pitcher.  So I thought, why not get the video and see what we could do with it.  It turned out to be the best decision ever.  My daughter 8 years later has always used his technique and has been extremely successful.  Countless strikeouts!  Three up Three down.  People are shocked when they ask who coached her and i answer Bob Todd's video and me.  Also, Amie has never had a backache, shoulder issues or wrist problems.  Try it, apply it.  You will be amazed at how easy it is to learn.",1392508800,,593,4.168141592920354
7962659,5,B000067FMD,The coach is the best. I enjoyed and I applied for myself the training and advise how to be the best.,1375488000,,101,3.857142857142857
7962660,5,B000067FMD,"My granddaughter is a pitcher for her softball team and is just starting out. This video showed foot placement, exercises to release the ball in the correct position, it gave her a lot of information without taking the coach away from the rest of the team.  I would recommend this video to girls starting out and players who want to get stronger and better.",1373328000,,357,4.578125
7962661,5,B000067FMD,"I bought this when first teaching my daughter to pitch, and damned if it doesn't work.  The video is a joke, and a 12 year-old could do better now with a cell phone camera.  The coach's methods are also pretty funny, as he draws a line in the ground with his foot to make a pitching mound.  Come on, you are making a video.  Could you at least paint a line?  All just quibbling though.  If you have no idea how to pitch a softball, this is the book for you.  As the title says, it is just the basics, but those basics have held up over time.",1360540800,,541,3.9537037037037037
7962662,3,B000067FMD,"This video did the trick for beginners.  Basic windmill mechanics and form, etc.  It did not go into advanced things and just brushed over everything.  It was a good starting point.  Not recommended for more advanced players and just for pitchers wanting to get a good foundation on mechanics.  Has a few recommended drills, but wish it went into more depth.",1269820800,,358,4.80327868852459
7962663,5,B000067FMD,"This was one of the only DVD instructionals that didn't talk over my daughter's head.  Coach Todd dosn't seem to worry so much about impressing you with his technical knowledge so much as he seems more interested in getting the girls excited about practicing and learning correctly.

I've already bought this DVD twice because every time I lend it out, the person always offers to buy it from me.

I wouldn't necessarilly recommend this DVD for advanced players, but for average 9-10 year old beginners, it PERFECT!",1256515200,2,515,4.896551724137931
