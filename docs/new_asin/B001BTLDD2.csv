8284786,5,B001BTLDD2,"the DVD is in two sections. One section is various videos.  All of these, and others, are available on YouTube, so I was disappointed with that half of the DVD; I had seen them already, and a few good ones are actually missing. But the other half is in interview with George, interspersed with clips.  He is just sitting in a chair, talking about what it was like to lose, and then to win.  He is a calm, thoughtful person, with the most infectious smile, who seems to love life.",1272931200,,479,4.3

8284788,5,B001BTLDD2,"This young man won Britian's Got Talent at the ripe old age of fourteen. I highly recomend this DVD for all those who love dance. George Sampson brings something special to a next generation of dance with his interpretation of ""Singing in the Rain"". This is a must buy for young and old alike.",1226793600,2,293,4.444444444444445
