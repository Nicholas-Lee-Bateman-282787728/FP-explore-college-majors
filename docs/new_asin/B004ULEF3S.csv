8441666,5,B004ULEF3S,"Excellent low budget Western with Ben Johnson on the trail of army deserter-turned-outlaw Dane Clark, the man who killed his brother. A stop at the outlaw's family ranch only serves to cause Johnson inner conflict as he finds himself growing fond of the miscreant's blind brother (Peter Graves) and all three are shortly under attack not long after the bad seed returns home.  A gem.",1502323200,,383,4.892307692307693
8441667,3,B004ULEF3S,"While the film is almost a copy of many other 1950s westerns and is somewhat ho-hum, it is overall not so bad. A man seeks revenge for the murder of his brother because a man deserted his troops which led to the death of virtually all of the soldiers in his Civil War unit. He finds a blind man who is the brother of the deserter and strikes up a very close relationship. Many ideas mentioned in the film are not fully developed. For example, the blind man has a very close relationship with an Indian chief but this is forgotten when the Indians attack. I would have thought the blind man could have save everyone by recalling his relationship to the Indian chief.",1474761600,,665,4.370967741935484

8441670,4,B004ULEF3S,"I saw this movie when I was 10 years old. I am now 70 . My wife has been looking off and on for 30 years and we finally got it. It is every bit as good as I remembered. It would have a five star rating on the strength of Dane Clark's acting alone, but after viewing it for the fourth time in three days the errors in the writing bring it down. However it is highly recommended.",1399161600,2,377,3.7848101265822787
8441671,4,B004ULEF3S,"Good western. Great story. Great ending. Ben Johnson,Peter Graves,and Dane Clark are the stars of this movie. The transfer is a 3.5 out of 5. Everything kept changing shades of colors. For the right price its worth the watch.........support your favorite artists.",1361318400,2,263,5.285714285714286
8441672,4,B004ULEF3S,I ordered Fort Defiance which I had never seen before. Upon watching it I found it to be a very good western and I liked it very much. I bought it mainly because of the title and the fact that Peter Graves was the main star. I liked the story and the action and acting of the actors.,1355961600,,283,3.896551724137931
8441673,4,B004ULEF3S,"So, Dr Nagi, done it again haven't you. I can't compete with with your thorough, entertaining (and helpful) reviews, but here goes. ""Fort Defiance"" has, for 50 years or so, been on my want list since reading the Maurice Speed Western film Annual Circa 1952 and seeing a still, I have never seen it until now, and, yes, I am glad I got it, and I did enjoy it, but it didn't quite set my soul on fire so to speak. It's got a good, slightly different plot, a variation on the vengeance theme, and good spectacular location work. Ben Johnson is one of my favourite actors, and whilst he is very good this isn't really his finest hour (Shane and One eyed Jacks are my personal faves along with the Ford films, and indeed most of his supporting roles)> He just doesn't seem to feel at ease with a lead role, or maybe that's just me. Dane Clark (who I normally don't like much) steals the show and has some surprisingly tough ""modern"" lines whic he spits out with gusto. Plenty of action - Indians/Stagecoach chases/ gunfights/ 2 good fistfights and a fairly brisk running time of 80 mins. It really should have pushed all my buttons, and I did like it, and I recomend it to Ben/western fans, I just couldn't in all honesty give it 5 stars. (Good print and sound, but it's Cinecolour which is a bit wishy washy, but OK to watch.)",1327363200,2,1322,4.3562753036437245
8441674,4,B004ULEF3S,"This movie was first released in 1951(2011), in Cinecolour, full screen 1.33.1 and runs 81 minutes. The sound and picture quality are good. There are no extras. The film starts with Ben Selby (BEN JOHNSON) riding into 'Triple Ranch', checks his gun and finds Ned Tallent (PETER GRAVES) training a black horse. Ned says his brother Jonny (DANE CLARK) was expected in 4 to 5 weeks. Ned was blind. Ben saves Ned and his uncle Charlie (GEORGE CLEVELAND) from 2 gunmen and agrees to stay and help out until Jonny came back. Ben says his younger brother was killed in war. Ned says that Jonny was very fast with his gun. Ben takes Ned for a ride to see his cattle, when the Indians ride in and start rounding the cattle. Chief Brave Bear (IRON EYES) says that he was going to take all Ned's cattle. Uncle Charlie goes to FORT DEFIANCE, while Ben still awaits Jonny at the ranch. When uncle Charlie comes back, he says that Jonny was shot dead robbing. Ned realises that Ben had come for Jonny. Back at Fort Defiance, Ben writes to his wife JANE, to say he was on his way home, but changes his mind to go into partnership with Triple Ranch. Jane would join Ben there. Soon Dave Parker, saloon owner and rancher comes riding in with his men, saying he lost 2 of his brothers on account of Jonny and had now come to kill Ned. A gunfight follows. Ben takes Ned and rides into Navaho Canyon. As Parker's men are burring uncle Charlie, a fast gunman comes there, saying he was Jonny and still alive.
How will it end? Why was Ben after Jonny? What had Jonny done to upset Parker? What will happen to Ned if anthing happened to uncle Charlie? Will the Army take the Indians to the reservation? What will the Indians do when they find Ned and Ben on their land? What will Ben do if he finds out that Jonny was still alive? Will Ned and Ben get out alive from this Indian Country?
This story of LOUIS LANTZ is beautifully photographed by STANLEY CORTEZ and slowly directed by JOHN RAWLINS. DANE CLARK(BERNARD ZANVILLE - 26.2.1912 to 11.9.1998) gives excellent performance and steals the show.
