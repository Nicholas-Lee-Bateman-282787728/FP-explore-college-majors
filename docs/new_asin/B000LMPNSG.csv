8162206,3,B000LMPNSG,"The DVD is basically a tourist momento, of the sort that is often on permanent loop in booking offices at tourist locations and bought by people visiting for the day from cruise boats.  It covers the history, people and character of Key West, but was a bit shallow in its treatment and I was left feeling unimpressed.

Perhaps I was expecting too much, but I'd hoped for a more in-depth coverage of some topics.  Conch houses and their gardens could in themselves be the subject for an entire DVD, as could the history of wrecking.  No mention at all of the railroad that was so important to opening up the Keys, or of the military history of the area (apart from a brief mention of the Dry Tortugas).

If you have been to Key West the DVD will make you feel nostalgic, and if you havn't been it might encourage you to go, but on the whole it was only of average quality.  The narration was OK but not inspired, and the camerawork was pretty average.",1206748800,6,950,4.369318181818182
