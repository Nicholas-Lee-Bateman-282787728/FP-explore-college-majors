Unlike  most anime, the english dub works very well in this series.
And the  theme song is catchy too.",934848000,,304,4.392857142857143
1027703,5,6305460116,"This series has had me hooked from the first episode on! I've seen the first 6 episodes and recently got the US DVD release. And what can I say? It's weird, no doubt about that, it's mind-boggling, like, what's real and  what's not real? It's also a refreshing title in the endless stream of  titles that keep popping up. All in all it's simply a great series that  deserves to be seen!",933638400,,386,4.333333333333333
1027704,5,6305460116,"Must see this thought provoking work of art. The first 4 Lain programs trace a philosophic line between the nothingness of childhood to ""birth"" realization/creation of self.  Are you weird?",932860800,,189,5.3
1027866,5,6305460116,In the first volume of lain you are shown some weird things that are hard to understand. If you can't stomach this than I guess you steer clear of Gantz or Elfin lied but unless you have the weakest stomach on earth I didn't see anything here that would have you turning your head. In the beginning a girl commits suicide and that's when the weird stuff happens. An e-mail from the girl is sent out to all of her fellow class mates if that's not really creepy lain replies to the e-mail and she gets a reply from someone saying they're not dead but they have crossed over to the wired world. Not only is lain getting e-mails from dead or crossed over people she is seeing images of zombie like people. The animation is Ok it's nothing to get overworked about but it's the story and the mystery behind everything that keeps you coming back for more episodes. The theme song for Lain is very nice so you can replay it over and over with this DVD.,1137283200,,944,4.279329608938547
1027867,3,6305460116,"Lain is a very weird anime, and while this first volume is intriguing, it's still too early yet to know if it's going to be any good, since this first volume is heavy on the mood and look and light on plot. An email is being sent to local schoolgirls from a fellow student. The weird thing is that the student committed suicide a week ago! Shy and reclusive Lain is one such student and the email from the dead girl says that she is still alive on the ""Wired"" which seems to be another name for the Internet. Then some of Lain's friends tell her they spotted Lain, or her double, at a nightclub, but it couldn't be because this girl was totally opposite in demeanor. And who are these strange people following Lain? Maybe there will be some answers in the next volume as the real world and that of the ""Wired"" become more and more blurred as Lain's true self emerges.

I wouldn't say that Volume 1 of Lain was good, but I will say it was interesting and makes me want to continue the series to get some answers. The character designs are done by Yoshitoshi Abe, the same mind behind Haibane Renmei and Texhnolyze, two series that are equally strange and worth seeking out if you like Lain. Lain also has a very distinct look and an unsettling sound design which adds to the ominous feel of the show. I liked it but I wonder if it's going to go down the road of the Matrix trilogy in the end, even if this show actually came out before those movies were made.",1126656000,,1458,4.263537906137184
1027868,4,6305460116,"Serial Experiment Lain: Navi contains the first four episodes, or ""Layers,"" of the addictive anime series about a junior high-school girl caught in a ghost story/conspiracy involving the ""Wired,"" or Internet world.

Lain takes place in modern Tokyo, but the Wired is more powerful and more interactive than the regular Internet.  PC's are called ""Navi's,"" I presume for navigating the Wired.  There is a new drug in this world called Accelo.  It is a nano-mechanism that when swallowed, increases the brain's awareness and activity.

Lain is an adorable, childlike young teen who surrounds herself in stuffed animals and bear-themed accessories.  Lain's father is fairly obsessed with computers.  He talks to his daughter, not looking at her once, while working on four modems.  Lain's mother is distant emotionally, subtly putting Lain down for being immature.

A thirteen year-old girl Lain knew only casually has committed suicide.  Since her death, Lain has been targeted by the girl's ghost, which seems to be ""alive"" inside the Wired.  Lain is also being watched by mysterious Men in Black types.  Lain seems to have a mysterious doppelganger with an extreme wild side.  Some of the mystery takes place in the youth club Cyberia (great name).  When Lain finds a mysterious device called a Psyche in her locker at school, and asks her father what it is, you sense that her parents know a lot more about what is going on than they let on.

The animation in Lain takes a little getting used to.  Backgrounds are not fully developed.  Characters' faces  seem flat, lifeless, and one-dimensional, especially the eyes.  Shadows and depth are minimal.  The lighting is too bright.  For example, there are scenes of Lain riding a subway.  In the far car, you can see the people in the same light and color as the car in the foreground.  It is almost as if you expect an artist's hand to come down with a pencil and start sketching.",1123718400,2,1929,4.885802469135802

It says 16 and over on the box, but i think, purely content wise, it is a 13 and up. It features some profanity, but mostly just in the episode ""religion"".

1027870,5,6305460116,"""Navi"" is the first of the 4-volume ""Lain"" series I've seen, and so far the only (hopefully I'll soon remedy that).  Beginning with a number of Japanese schoolgirls receiving e-mails from a classmate who recently committed suicide - emails supposedly written after the suicide - ""Lain"" is part of the science fiction/metaphysical 'What is reality?' crossboundries genre that's materialized in recent years, and if the remaining chapters are as good as this one,it's going to contend heavily for the title of best of its kind.

  Ambiguity abounds at every turn, with more paths than not leading in sinister directions, with a unique animation style whose cameras often focus ominously on the powerlines, wires, computer plug-ins and so on that are becoming so evermore omnipresent in the modern world that they've practically become invisible.  ""Lain"" requires close attention from its viewers if one is to follow the story, much like the recent ""Solaris"" remake, and once I've seen the full series I'll probably rewatch the whole thing from square one.  Based on this one DVD, things are very open to the individual's interpretation.

  With an endearing title protagonist and some of the most unique, innovative use of colo in animated (or live-action) history, ""Lain"" ranks with the cream of the crop.  Recommended to fans of ""Solaris"", ""The Animatrix"" and ""Dark City"".",1096502400,2,1372,5.195454545454545
1027871,5,6305460116,"My wife and I rented this and were at first thrown by the slow pace and at-first confusing style, but became enthralled by this beautifully drawn, high symbolic, and often disturbing four episodes tracking a schoolgirl named Lain.

We see Lain grow entranced with ""the Wired"" (evidently the Internet) after she starts receiving messages from a classmate after she committed  suicide. The Wired has taken on a life of its own, and Lain's perceptions of reality change as she gets sucked into the Wired's subculture.

This series immediately begged a comparison to the Matrix, but this English dub predates the Matrix's  releases by a year. I would not get too caught up with such comparisons, as this series has its own opinions on man and machine, particularly with respect to the family life, and should be viewed on its own merits.

The artwork and ideas behind this series apparently had a huge influence on Shinchiro Watanabe's ""Kid's Story"", a piece from the Animatrix when a boy discovers Neo and joins him in the real world by jumping off the roof of his high school. The suicide theme and several artistic motifs are quite similar between the two pieces.",1096070400,3,1162,4.848484848484849
1027872,2,6305460116,"I had high hopes for an interesting and different film, but I was disappointed. It is different, but unfortunately boring. There are some aspects to the artwork that are unique (shadows have fun treatments) but thats about it. Otherwise, the artwork is a let down. The eyes on the main character (Lain) were a window to nothing and she really wasn't endearing. It was very slow and not a ""ghost story"". Maybe the next few layers get more excitng, but I'm sure the anime doesn't get better.",1082764800,,489,4.632183908045977
1027873,5,6305460116,"I purchased the first DVD mostly out of curiosity, then after watching the 1st 4 episodes, immediately went out and purchased the rest.  The only thing missing is an ongoing plot that could spawn OVA's and feature films, as everything 'ends' in the last episode (no spoilers, you'll have to see what I mean, and I guarantee you'll be surprised).  Since it seems to have preceded both 'The Matrix' and 'Ghost in the Shell' I expect that the writers of both would have been inspired by it directly.  If you are into computers, if you are into the paranormal, or if you've ever questioned your own existence, it's a must-see.  There seems to be at least some influence from 'Akira' and 'Roujin Z', especially in the last 2 episodes.  No doubt this series was influential in '.hack/sign' as well.",1067558400,2,792,4.669064748201439

 Lain was one of he first anime series I really seen all the through, before i really couldn' get into anime cause I thought if you've seen one you've seen them all, stupid right? But I was always searching for somthing smarter, because i don't like being treated like an idiot when i watch anything, when the plot, conflicts, relationships between the character are fully explained within the first few episodes, and the ending is just thrown in there at the last minute. This one really caught me by surprise, I first heard about it from one of my friends who is an anime freak. I decided to check it out and I was blow alway emotionly, I rented the first tape and I got so addicted to it that I just went out and rented he rest of the series and watched it all in one sitting, that is somthing you shouldn't do because I was so tired mentally that I couldn't watch anything for days cause it was to much to take in all at once.

Just think, the picture on your screen stays exactly the same for about half a minute, without anybody saying anything...and on the length of the whole episode just nothing significant happens or is said... It's not thoughtful or philosofical or anything, just...boring :) I really wonder how people could compare this anime to Neon Genezis Evangelion, which is really high quality film by the way, or any other good anime...",1065744000,3,595,4.8431372549019605
1027955,1,6305460116,"This is absolutely the worst anime I have ever seen.  The story is slow, predictable and full of the same flashbacks ad nausiun.  The artwork is boring.
Just awful!",1050969600,4,164,4.620689655172414
1027956,5,6305460116,"Lain Iwakura is a singularly unassuming 14 year old.  The classic waif, surrounded by stuffed pets, and a habit of wearing bear pajamas.  Suddenly inexplicable things are happening around her, culminating in her receiving an e-mail from a classmate several days after the girl committed suicide.  This triggers a set of changes in Lain's life, many of them small, but ominous when taken as a whole.
Soon Lain is surfing the net with her powerful new Navi (which she barely understands) and eerie connections multiply.  Lain is invited to a nightclub where another guest goes berserk and commits suicide right in front of her.  Gradually, she discovers there is another Lain - her opposite - who is a master participant in the Wired, an online world where the stakes may be as high as death and transformation.
The primary plot of the series is the gradual diffusion of the boundaries between realities, and the building identity crisis with Lain at its epicenter.  The story is very carefully paced, steadily turning up the sense of impending doom.  As other participants in the Wired begin to die in some way related to the net.  This isn't done with blazing animation, or even an excess of dialog or action. Instead, an almost minimalist style makes symbols out of everyday objects like teddy bears and telephone lines.  For example, the use of space in Lain's home is almost reminiscent of Woody Allen's 'Interiors,' and depicts the same sense of distance and isolation.
Lain's world is dystopian, marked by a culture lacking even the motivation necessary to communicate effectively.  In this first DVD, the viewer will often feel as baffled as Lain does, desperately reading an instruction manual that never stops to explain anything.  But gradually her knowledge develops, and her personality strengthens until we are sure that something wicked comes this way.
Animation is, as I've said, minimal.  Sufficient for the purposes of the series, but never allowed to become a distraction.  Instead, the key element is the carefully composed graphic imagery and a well made score.  This is very much an original story, and not one intended for pure entertainment.  The silences in the film require thought on the part of the viewer.  Even so, it is a very attractive series; one of those that stretch the boundaries of Anime is a quest for a higher esthetic vision.",1049414400,12,2365,4.949367088607595
1027957,5,6305460116,"Anime is a very broad genre, encompassing all sorts of subgenres, and more often than not a particular anime series will belong to several of these subgenres at once. There are, however, some series that defy categorization, series that can only be classified as ""in a league of their own."" The haunting and equally disturbing ""Serial Experiments Lain"" is such a series, demanding a certain something from its audience in order to be fully appreciated. With that realization, ""Lain"" is most certainly not for everyone, but for those who dare to watch this series will set out on a journey unlike anything they've ever experienced.
The first DVD in this series, ""Navi"", introduces us to Lain, a shy thirteen-year old girl with a seemingly typical life. But everything changes when a classmate of Lain's commits suicide and emails supposedly from the dead girl suddenly circulate to everyone in the class. Curious, Lain reads the email and reads its chilling words: ""I just abandoned my body. I still live here..."" Thus begins her journey into the Wired, the internet-like world that has a life of its own. Could Lain's dead classmate be right? Has the line between the real world and the wired world begun to blur?
Anyone expecting a straight-forward story will be in for a rude-awakening; ""Serial Experiments Lain"" is anything but straightforward. Rather than simply lay out everything for the viewer, the show instead asks the viewer to decide for himself what is going on. Every shot, every sound, every moment in ""Lain"" contains some kind of meaning or symbolic imagery, meant to be deciphered by the viewer based upon what he believes is happening. The result is a surreal and eerie presentation with an almost ominous atmosphere. And yet there's also enough to fascinate, even seduce the viewer into continuing, drawing him deeper into the story and closer to what the ""truth"" is. Some will find it boring; others will find it mesmerizing. Only those willing to move on will ascertain the series' secrets...or discover there were never any to begin with.
Visually, ""Lain"" makes good use of its anime medium. With moody colors and vibrant psychological stimulus, the series knows how to present its macabre imagery in the best way possible. Granted, it's not the most detailed anime series ever produced, as evident by the character models in certain situations, but that's not what the series is trying to accomplish. And what it accomplishes it accomplishes so well, that's all it needs.
The audio of the series is just as important and well-executed as the visuals. With its evocative score done by Reiichi ""CHABO"" Nakaido, ""Lain"" paints an unsettling portrait of sound to amplify the mood already set by the visuals. The sound effects also do their share of sustaining the atmosphere, from the eerie silences to the hiss of smoke to the ghostlike hums of the power lines.
As for the dub, Pioneer has put together a marvelous English track that is sure to please dub fans and maybe even a few sub fans. Every voice actor matches his or her respective character and gives a performance matching the solemn performances by the original Japanese voice actors. Definitely one of the better dubs on the market today.
Overall, ""Serial Experiments Lain"" is a fantastic anime series, but only if you're the right kind of viewer. Many people will understandably dislike what this series attempts to create and others will be uncomfortably confused by what ""Lain"" is trying to attempt. But for those with an open mind and a desire to explore one's own psyche and personal convictions, ""Serial Experiments Lain"" is the perfect choice.",1044057600,4,3630,4.962233169129721

not your typical anime. it has a different drawing style to it and definitely not like the happy, silly comedic anime i usually watch.
lain sets a very sad, and mysterious tone. throughout this series, i found myself very depressed watching it. its not recommended if you don't like watching suicide in anime or serious dark tone set throughout an anime. the violence and disturbing images in this anime are very high. you see people live in fear and kill other people out of paranoia. very mysterious...
i actually don't really like this anime since it is kind of depressing, but it is extremely unique. and i have only watched the first volume. yet it is sad enough for me to want to avoid watching it further. the drawing style of this anime is too realistic like, not your typical huge eye anime you usually see. the characters drawn in this anime don't look like the silly, adorable characters you see in other anime. this is very realistic style with a sci-fi twist. its a story about the wired. what we call the internet in our time and age basically, and goes into concepts such as client-server applications. this would probably be an interesting series to watch if you were into the information technology jargon. while it is very interesting, the disturbing images of murder and suicide might offend some people. even though i didn't like watching it; i have to give it five stars because it is very unique and is well drawn and very original in its content. only too graphic in its violence. not recommended for children. that's for sure. even some adults shouldn't watch it.",1023753600,,1653,4.683848797250859

This first DVD introduces the viewer to the mature themes (suicide, drug use, the link between the 'wired' and the real world), as well as the protagonist Lain and most of the minor characters - her parents, Taro and her friends Alice, Julie and Rika.  It may seem slow in places, but a lot of attention needs to be paid to everything in this 13-part series for it to make sense.",1021248000,,462,4.554216867469879

At first sight you may think you're seeing some serious ideas about identity, and about the relationship between the real world and the virtual. But the writers apparently thought long, portentous silences and willful obscurity were acceptable substitutes for well-thought out themes and genuine insights. It's hard to care very much about Lain, with her constant gasps and maddening passivity, and everyone else in the series fades into gray. By the end it's clear the writers have lost track of whatever it was they were really trying to say. I wish I had nicer things to say about the series, but the visual look is really the only exceptional thing about it. Serial Experiments may be a break from the usual pyrotechnics and fisticuffs, but today's anime fans have a right to expect more.",1017446400,5,871,4.891891891891892

She is the focus of this series, quite obviously shown by the title.  Lain seems to be your average girl, but when she receives a strange e-mail from the dead girl, who happened to be her schoolmate, Lain begins to transform into a new person via the internet.  Confusion sets in as it becomes dificult for Lain to distinguish between reality and the digital world.",1012780800,,605,4.723809523809524
1028019,4,6305460116,"I will try not to ruin the series for you. I gave it four star because I know many people won't understand Lain and will dislike it. But in its genre I would give it 5 stars.
  This is not an action or adventure or exciting or fun anime. It is a serious one that questions the meaning of reality and how reality can be viewed.
  If you have watch the whole Evangelion series you know toward the end it become a mind trip, or if you watch Ghost in the Shell that too become mind trip, but Lain Serial Experiment is a solid mind trip.
  I know I am making it sound like Lain is a bad anime, but for the few who like the anime that question reality this is the one for you. And for those that see the first DVD and said it was junk, take you time and watch the whole series.
  This is an anime that you must be in the right mood to watch and have the right mind to understand what is going on.
  On to the review: Lain is a school aged girl that is shy, with only one close true friend Alice. Lain become interested in computers, which is called a Navi, and ""the wire"" after a she receives an e-mail from a class mate that has committed suicide.

 Lain explores the wire and finds out that there maybe another world out there, where one can also exist. Lain finds out that she can control one of these world which will end up changing the other. She is able to connect to all people in all world and try to destroy the border to the two worlds, but accidently hurts he friend Alice. It hard to determine what Lain thinks but she commits herself to endless loniless as much as a god would have...It is a must see
  On the first time viewing the whole series you will not understand many things happening, you will need to see the series at least twice maybe more, and still many part won't make since, but that is the way the series is made, it is made for the viewer to think and think and come up with there own oppions and understandings.

p.s. if you are in a good mood and want to want to stay in don't watch Lain, and if you are in a depressed mood by no means watch this, you become suicidal ^_^",1011830400,5,2098,4.021686746987951
1028020,3,6305460116,"(WARNING: Review is based on Navi and Navi alone)
I'm a Otaku in the genre of freaky, wierd, and brain twisting anime. Lain (layers 1-4) is most likely one of them, but it still flops for many reasons...
First off, Layers (1-4) and what I presume to be the rest of the series have shamefully awful background art. It seriously looks like someone cut a pice of fabric and traced a street scene on it. Then they make up for that with hundreds upon hundreds of totally unessasary head shots. I'm quessing a good 11% of the whole four episodes consist of those pore examining scenes. They just seem to be trying to be freaky a little too hard, making it a complete waste of time...
Second, sound effects and music are alright but still are second rate compared too alot of the Anime i've seen.
Third, the plot line is so incredibly easy to pick up, I smelled it coming the moment I opened the UPS box. I like a challenge, I want to be totally mind blowed and I want to too be totally stupified into watching it about 3 times just to understand the plot. I quess it adds to the re-watchability, gives people space to fill in their own thoughts on the stuff they could not comprehend. So If your a person who finds entertainment in watching the bug zapper flash when it catches its prey, this is your anime!
In conclusion, if you want a pure blood freaky and mind twisting anime ,get the first three DVDs of Boogiepop Phantom, don't invest your money in Navi.

Most of the suff was either dubbed(badly), too cute, or too cute. (because  there were twice as much too cute than badly dubbed) They turned on Lain, and my weary, bloodshot eyes widened, and my tired head lifted from my palm. I stood up, still staring at the screen, listening to the beautiful Duvet by Boa as the opening theme, and sat down in the front row, and watched 'til 7 AM. By then, I was obsessed. I tried finding videos, (since some of us are sadly DVD-less.. grrr...) anyway, they were either on DVD of too expensive. but, i finally got my hands on one, with my wonderful amazon.com coupon, and now i can watch it over and over and over and over. uh, but, i guess i should review it now...
*ahem* okay. Lain is not for the action DBZ lovers,not for kids, since they'll be scratching their heads. it is for deep-thought sort of people--with a visible darkside.watch it, and then think about it. try. just TRY to figure out the plot in the first watch. just TRY to end your hunger for more with the first volume... i dare you.",1010707200,,1150,4.373831775700935

In either case, it will leave you saying ""what the hell?"" for days. I happen to like the head trip type of anime, so I thought it was great. The animation is simplistic, but very effective. The whole series moves slowly, allowing you to gradually feel disturbed and nervous, without using cheesy suspense tricks like dark tunnels and enemies lurking just around the corner. The story moves between seemingly unrelated incidents randomly, only to have them come together at the end in a way that makes you think oh, well, of course. Except often the oh, well, of course will only come after repeated viewings and long periods of thought. But when you get it, it is so worth it.",1010016000,2,812,4.493243243243243

This is _not_ Akira. This is not shoot-em-up anime. This is mystery,  philosophy, psychology, all wrapped in a beautiful package. Yeah, its slow, but in the way Hitchcock can be slow--every moment matters. It's very cyberpunk, postmodern kind of stuff. It challenges reality & makes you pay attention.
This is by far my favorite anime--I've seen a good amount and found nothing that compares.",1007424000,,590,4.619047619047619

There really wasn't a plot that I could point out to you.  Basically, the main character is this shy girl that no one pays much attention to.  A girl at her school kills herself and she starts receiving e-mail messages from her.  She gets a new computer, is accused of being at some party, and is mocked by her ""friends"".  It really doesn't make sense and is VERY slow moving.  There's this side plot about some guy getting high off of some drugs and he is at ""the party"" and starts trying to kill people.  It's very strange and doesn't make sense.  I recommend that no one buy this and be as disappointed at wasting money on it like I was.",1004918400,4,842,4.2125

It's weird...it's like the show teases you with the promise of getting really good, only it never quite does. Every episode contains at least one scene where I found myself thinking ""Woah, that was cool! Now I think I know where this is going!"" The next thing I know, it's ten minutes later and nothing has happened. That's how it gets you. You sit through the entire series just so you can figure out what the (EXPLETIVE) is going on!
The series is worth a rental, at least. If you don't understand what's going on, don't feel too bad, because I don't think you're supposed to. Just make sure you eat a lot of sugar beforehand and turn all the lights on, lest you drowse off halfway through. If nothing else, you can tell your friends that you sat through a ""deep, thoughtful anime"" for once.

1028103,2,6305460116,"I have always felt that the true charm of anime is its strong story telling and solid sci-fi plots. Lain is an attempt to produce this in a very pure form. If you like action or comedic gags, take a look at some of the shallower offerings like ""Slayers."" If you are like me, however, and enjoy a strong story, you might get steered this way. In many ways, Lain is similar to ""Key the Metal Idol"" which is possibly the greatest series ever made. (Take me seriously when I say that, I have a collection of 600 anime tapes that I have been assembling since 1984!). However, having finished it, I must say I was disappointed. I have two problems with this series. The first three episodes are REALLY slow. Like watching paint peel. If you make it through that, it does get interesting, even facinating, and the remainder of the series is very entertaining. Except for the other problem. The show raises all kinds of questions and virtually none of them are answered at the end of the series. I know the Japanese are fond of ambiguous endings but this doesn't even meet that standard. I was left staring at the TV, saying ""that it?"" to myself. So little was answered or explained that it makes the body of the story devoid of meaning. If you want to see a series with a tremendous story, get ""Key."" This one might be worth a rent but I would not recommend buying it.",998697600,3,1361,4.383399209486166

Somehow it manages to be slow and deliberate without seeming to drag.  The use of background noise is incredible.  The show can build tension with no movement, no dialogue, no sound effects, just the background hum of electricity behind a static character.  AHA! That's it!  Every single thing in this show: the art, the sound, the dialogue, the characters, the music, the backgrounds, seems to have been carefully selected and placed.

The storyline was incredible for an anime (atleast for the anime i've seen), and the voice acting was incredible.  There is nothing wrong with this series at all.  A definate 5 star review for Lain.

Well, after watching the first three episodes, I decided I would be one who hated this Anime.  The director uses the same cuts over and over throughout the first three episodes and you soon become sick of seeing the same animation so many times.  The plot seemed boring and straigh-up confusing and so I soon began to hate it.  Then I came to the fourth episode.  This is where everything molds together to create a great movie.  The past three episodes begin to make sense and the repitition of cuts become worthwhile.  The end of the fourth episode leaves you begging for more, and so I look forward to seeing the rest.  I recommend you rent this title or borrow it before you purchase it though for you'll either love it or hate it.  I plan on renting the next disc before buying it for I am not sure if it truely worth it.  Buying series is risky for it may become very boring in the last episodes.

The animation looks like it can be played in a very hi-tech night club. The storyline is very slow, but like Mononoke Hime, you must look at every action, for not much dialogue is not used in the Lain series and then you will most likely be satisfied. And if you can stand the pain stakingly long fights in DBZ like me, you can stand Lain.

I've watched all 13 episodes and I'm utterly confused.  Nothing in Lain is clearly defined and the story only gets stranger with each episode.  In the end nothing much is explained and it's up to you (the viewer) to tie up the loose ends and draw your own conclusion.
  The Lain series was done with a limited budget and aired at 1:00am in Japan. It definitely has that low-budget, late-night, creepy, strange, horror shows feel. It has some excellent graphics, but those frames are re-used quite often during the course of the series. If you watch this show for the animation, you'll be disappointed.  If you like clear-cut explanation of plot twist you'll not get them here.  If you like fast-moving rapid-fire anime with sharp dialogs then look elsewhere.  Lain is slow, it's strange, it's creepy and it leaves itself open for all sorts of interpretations. It's one of those shows that you'll either love to death or hate with all your heart. I've watched it once, and I'll watch it again just to be sure I don't like it as much as I think I do.

1028215,4,6305460116,"I gave this series 4 stars simply because it contains certain features that will not be liked by all age and genre groups. With that said, the series is recommended for 16 and up, I don't believe violence or language plays a roll, but more so the complexity of the series.
If your interested in getting in involved in a series that lacks action, but uses visuals and sound fx to get inside your head, then this is definately a movie I recommend for you.  There may be a drawback to this series, since the creators intend to use visuals to get you through the series rather than with spoken explantion, the voice acting is sub-par . However the excellent art direction makes up for this. Certain backgrounds seem odd and bland, but you soon realize that one object stands out and is so well designed its utterly amazing.  The art direction and the visuals add so much depth to this series its almost impossible to not sit back and watch in awe.
As for the story and the plot, thats something else to contend with, I definately would not recommend this to those who are impatient with a progressing story or to action junkies or to little kiddies.  I like the concept that they are trying to portray though.  They set-up the begining with a suicide, eventually everyone of this persons classmates receives an e-mail, Lain(the main character) decides to respond.  Basically what you can assume is the suicide victim is living in the internet. Subtle hints, through the visual and sound fx, seem to depict life brewing within the power lines.  In the episode ""Girls"" your introduced to a techno drug that messes with the brain. Also, you'll notice Lain, who in the begining despises computers, seems to be drawn to them as the series continues.  Thats all I'll give you, as I don't want to give too much away.  Bottomline, if you find odd and bizarre directed movies, like ""Lost Highway"" amusing, then this is the series for you.",985824000,5,1925,4.608187134502924

I didn't sleep the rest of the night cause I was too busy trying to figure out what the HECK just happened.  'Lain' follows the young girl of the same name in her dabbling with the world known as the 'wired'.  Her curiosity really begins after she recieves an e-mail from Chisa Yomoda, a girl who commited suicide only two days earlier.  What? Not weird enough you say? As the story continues Lain begins to see strange children getting run over by trains, appearing out of walls, and disappearing in to thin air.  In layer 02: Girls, Lain finds out that there is another version of herself running around (hmmm...wereLain?) and in Layer 03: Psyche, Lain becomes involved in a game called Phantoma that allows people to fight in the 'wired' without limitations 'cept there are still a few bugs in the system.  Last, in Layer 04: Religion, Lain finds out about a group of people called the KNIGHTS who may prove to be a tad problematic.  If you love technobabble and solving puzzles then this is probably the title for you.  It walks on the darker side with no comedy relief and a lot of suicide, homicide, and a little bit of drug use.  The blood and death are handled quite tastefully so the only real reason that an older audience should watch this is for the material covered in it.

It does move slow but it's kind of like it sneaks up behind you and squeezes you brain. When the story kicks in the slowness drifts away and you find yourself in another dimension. You have to be a patient viewer with an open mind, and if you are you will be very rewarded. After the first DVD I ran out to get the rest! The music is gently awesome!  Very much like Brian Eno's early stuff, very strange and disturbing and compliments the visuals perfectly. I love a flick that you can't understand right away. It is like X Files only if X Files were on acid. There is no need for drugs when you see a masterpiece like this. The train wreck scene with the stange music was to me hypnotic. I have waited for a combination of Vertigo Sandman-esque storys and off center music together for a long time. Not for the average anime viewer I have found. Some people just won't get it.

How could something which goes by soooooo slowly suddenly have such a weird, twisted plot? I have no idea, but one things for sure when I got to the end of the 4th episode what I thought was ""...I gotta watch the other volumes..."" So if you're willing to check it out even though the warnings on the pace, I really recommend it. Also, the animation quality is excellent...OVA like (or is it OAV? i never got that right...) and it goes very well with the mood, I really like the animation sequence in the opening title part. The music is good, theres not much of it but it seems good. But once again, when i got this anime, despite the warnings, I didn't think it would be this slow or artsy, but its really good (it might sound like I'm contradicting myself though).

Lain is an exellent anime with a very different style. Although character design may seem overly stylized, too simple maybe, combination with computer-generated images, and effective use of sound, such as the eerie hum of electric lines, create the perfect atmosphere for its story.
I've only seen this first DVD which has 4 episodes, and I'll be honest with you, I have no idea what's going on. My advice is that if you are looking for fast action and excitement, stay away from this one. ""Lain"" is really slow most of the time, and will certainly test your patience.
I don't mind the slow pace at all because the visual is just wonderful, and music is great too.

1028281,5,6305460116,"i can't think of enough adjectives to describe this series. from the opening sequence, with its almost creepy play of time and space, and great music, lain had me. for the rest of layer 01 i watched the images go by in an almost trancelike state.
the basic idea of this series: our world and the Wired are not separate entities. they exist in parallel, sometimes elements from one cross over to the other, and it's possible to leave this (physical) world to exist solely in the Wired. lain, a painfully shy, disconnected young girl, finds this out through an e-mail sent to her by a classmate who committed suicide.
this series does move more slowly than most anime i've seen, but each image has so much to it and it's all so bizarrely beautiful that it needs to move slowly in order for us to absorb it all. the pacing also reflects lain, who moves around in a slow deliberate daze throughout most of the first 4 layers. the almost silent scenes do a wonderful job of showing us the alienation she feels from the rest of her world. the story is mostly within lain's mind, and mostly in the images, and so excessive dialogue/action would have added nothing to the experience. the series has been compared to the x-files by other reviewers, and i agree, in the sense that the plot and pacing of the layers and general ""atmosphere"" is similar to that of the x-files, especially earlier episodes. there is no clear beginning and conclusion to the layers, and in the end, the viewer is left with more questions than answers. in other words, the viewer is actively involved, is thinking, during the entire series.
someone looking for an action movie with your basic beginning and end shouldn't watch this, it will be extremely frustrating. however, if you're looking for something that leaves the conclusions and thinking to the viewer, with unusual and striking imagery, and sometimes unsettling similarities to our own world, then lain is the series for you.",972345600,16,1955,4.702623906705539

You'll either patiently  absorb the philosophical tales, the existentialist ideologies, the  theological implications or the length'll drive you mad, to the depths of  cursing Lain as a crappy anime.  That's my two cents.  Personally, if you  can stand philosophy/theology, if you can stand the somewhat dark  atmosphere, try the first one.

1028359,5,6305460116,"This is anime at it's finest. Deep story, gorgeous animation, creepy  atmosphere.
Let's get to the storyline. Lain, a shy and quiet  schoolgirl, receives an e-mail from a classmate who committed suicide a  week before, informing her that the girl simply abandoned her body and  still lives in the Wired (the SE: L term for the internet). What ensues is,  to say the least, STRANGE. Lain soon finds out (from various sources) about  at least two other versions of herself: a Wired personality that's  supposedly her opposite, and a tough, commanding persona that hangs out at  Cyberia, a local club. She meets people who seem to have met her before,  but as a different person. (""Hey, you're Lain, aren't you? I saw you  on the Wired once. You were totally different from how you seem now"").  Her changing personality, her growing obsession with the Wired, an e-cult,  and a couple of mysterious men stalking their house (I assume we'll find  out more about them in future volumes) add to the great plot.
This isn't  for everyone. First off, you have to want to THINK. It's fairly complex,  with no comedy and almost no action, so some may get bored. Second, it's  not for young children (I'm 14 myself). If you do show this to children,  take into account the disturbing story (including suicide) and chilling  images (I can think of one in particular). They would also be bored (I'm  sure my little brother would sleep through it).
In conclusion, this is an  incredible series. It deserves a casual look by any anime fan (like  myself). But be warned, it takes a certain personality.",966297600,6,1584,4.728937728937729

Boy, not only was the animation and colors better then I expected, but it  was also as bizare and involving as I hoped it would be, even better. I  never have any problems with the Japanese voice actors, and Shimizu Kaori  does a great job of giving you the mysteriousness and curiousness of the  main character, Lain. I don't want to say too much about the actual plot or  characters, I find it best to take everything in fresh, which is what I did  for this series.

After seeing the unique design for the series' boxes, I decided it would be in my best interest to see the series itself.  Not wanting to spend a lot of money on  a series I wasn't even sure would be good, I decided to wait until my local  video store got a copy.  Thank goodness they did, because it turned out to  be one of the most impressive pieces of anime I'd ever seen apart from the  few Hayao Miyazaki films I've been fortunate enough to view.
Right from  the get-go, Serial Experiments: Lain is an attention-grabber.  I enjoyed  the opening theme (""Duvet"") by Boa so much that I am currently  trying to find their debut album ""The Race of a Thousand Camels""  somewhere at a decent price.  (It's only available as a Japanes import thus  far.)  The animation in the opening credits sequence is also very creative,  due to the fact that it is quite rare to see the hand-held camera look and  the use of jump cuts in animation.
The show itself took me a while to  warm up to.  It wasn't until Layer 03 that I realized I was watching an  amazing example of anime.  It is deliberately slow-paced, so as to give the  viewer as much information in the amount of time as the makers so choose.  I was quite pleased to view a story unfolding in which I could honestly say  that I had no idea where they were going with it.  I was also striken by  the stark, minimalistic style of the animation, yet another aspect that  makes Serial Experiments: Lain such a unique work.
Serial Experiments:  Lain is obviously not for everybody, but it is sure to please those who are  tired of the only successful anime being the blood-and-guts and sex-laden  series.  Lain is a series that respects both the intelligence and attention  span of the audience.  Now if only the video store will get the rest of the  series...",960768000,6,1863,4.398230088495575

The whole  series relies on repetition, strangely  distant human interaction, and  surreal layouts that make you wonder exactly what reality you are looking  at.
The dubbing is excellent, and the voices are believable and agreeable  to the ear.  (I have the dubbed collection)
The pace may be off-putting  to some, but I personally enjoy suspense and deliberation.
Not many guns  or bouncing breasts.  No mecha. You do get to see what God looks like,  though.
Beware Lain's mom's face....I don't know what is with that  woman.
The opening song is outstanding; it's one of those that sticks in  your head, but you don't mind too much.
As for the comparisons to Eva, I  see some resemblances, of course, but I also see some relation to The  Matrix.  All in all, Lain is an accomplished addition to the whole Plato's  Cavern/questionable-reality film genre.",958608000,7,1049,4.770949720670391

The story almost made me believe that  ""WE'RE ALL CONNECTED"" as what the ""GOD"" of the  ""Net"" said.

By today's standards, Lain moves  very slowly, but that is a large part of the appeal.  The story is unfolded  so lovingly and deliberately, that by the end, you're desperate for more.  And the series gets better with each set, up to the rousing climax in  Reset.
If you're a fan of 2001 you'll very likely enjoy Lain as well.  Much like 2001, the Lain series examines humanity and its origins through  the ways in which we interact with technology.  And also, as in 2001, this  exploration is done with stunning imagery and visuals.

That's how wide open this  particular anime is for personal interpretation and meaning.  The writers  never explain anything outright, with intelligence-insulting dialogue; the  significance of each bizarre little moment is entirely up to the viewer to  figure out.  Spend the money and get the whole series, because you'll come  back to it again and again and again.

If you're prepared to watch all the visual white noise, and pick  out the plot line, you'll find an interesting tail about reality, and how  we each perceive our place within it.",945216000,4,624,4.526785714285714

Definitely something I'd watch over just to catch different things. Action fans beware, lain is about  questions...sometimes things aren't really answered... but that's what  makes this DVD really interesting.. it's a great take on how much  technology influences and (de)sensetizes our lives.  The dialogue is  written such that we're expected to be intelligent, not some dumbed down  crowd.. If you like dark moods and cyberpunk themes, get this DVD.",945129600,6,563,4.863157894736842
1028778,5,6305460116,"This is definitely an excellent series.  The first thing that caught my eye was the awesome cover artwork.  The theme song is haunting, yet catchy.  You totally get caught up in the story.  It may seem slow to people who  are used to non-stop action, but its has a lot more to intrigue you that  just that!",943660800,,306,4.280701754385965

A rare treat.  Can not wait for more  episodes of Lain to come out on DVD.  It is my favorite anime-keeps me  thinking.",941241600,2,379,5.098360655737705
1028781,5,6305460116,"WOW!  I've never seen an anime this original or mindblowing before.  No SUPER-Humans, no evil nemesis, no robot armor.  Just a chilling and peculiar story following a small teenage girl.  I've watched this DVD about  5 times, and I'm still discovering new aspects of the film.  I'm eagerly  awaiting the arrival of Knights!",940032000,,323,4.981132075471698

7889283,4,6305460116,"Don't let this volume put you off the series.  Things get much more interesting with episode #5.  Yes, it's hard to get past the English voice acting, particulary for Lain and her friends, but stick with it, it's worth it.  It could be that the actors speak the way they do to symbolize how disconnected people are from each other, or maybe the voice actors just stink.  I bought this, watched it, and let it sit on my shelf, but I kept reading folks on Amazon saying how great the series is, so I decided to give it another chance and bought the second disc, and then finally discs 3 and 4 as well.",1339372800,,599,4.228070175438597
7889284,5,6305460116,"""Lain"" is one of those anime series that surpasses your expectations, leaves you speechless, confused and completely engrossed in the storyline. Lain is a teenager who gets an e-mail from a classmate that committed suicide. She tells her that she is alive, that she left the flesh and lives at The Wired. This starts Lain's quest to find out the truth about The Wired, an enormous computer network, like the Internet, but it is actually a reality apart from the physical world.

Lain starts to find out the truth about The Wired and sees her life change in the process. This is an amazing series that deals with philosophy, identity, culture, reality, computers, and the ever-changing culture and way of life of people due to technology. It is truly one of the deepest and most amazing series I have ever seen. This is one to watch.",1219276800,,832,4.698630136986301
7889285,5,6305460116,"One of the best animation ever, before watching the series remember what the cover says, ""close the world, open the next."" I won't explain the plot but you should do the following to fully enjoy this anime(turn down the lights). Watch the entire series before forming an opinion, be sure to watch the beginning and ending credits also since you will realize it is part of the plot of the series, never miss the subtitles info( if yours isn't english language version). You should have plenty of quesions popping in your head, now watch it again( it is better if you let it soak in your head a little while, since we need time to process the info) and realize what the story is trying to say verbally and through the background scenery.

  This anime is for mature people, and so is the content( this is how life is like there(maybe here.....in the distant future?)) and graphics of this series(nothing really obscene though but keep in mind this is how the world really looks in the mind of the story teller), little kiddies shouldn't be watching this. If your happy you probably won't after watching this, sad maybe, since it is dark and ominous, but definately worth watching. Turn the lights back on but you might be scared to turn your computer now... wireless internet connection...yeh, that is a scary thought.",1177804800,,1316,4.688311688311688
7889286,2,6305460116,"Great artwork.  Intriguing story that gets...very wierd.  Hard to follow.  It's like David Lynch on (even more) acid.  Kindof a shame since it's an interesting concept, but one almost gets the feeling that the writers tried to do way too much with it.  Artwork still makes it worth watching.  Not sure if I'll bother with the later layers.",1150848000,,339,4.758620689655173
