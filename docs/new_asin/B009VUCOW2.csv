5369418,5,B009VUCOW2,I purchased this movie because I am a Disney movie collector. Personally I liked Cinderella III A Twist in Time better that Cinderella II Dreams Come True. But of course neither beat the original.,1354233600,,196,4.794117647058823
5369419,5,B009VUCOW2,"When we realized there were two other movies, sequels to a favorite of the family Cinderella, we decided to acquire this set, including Cinderella II and III.

We have watched II so far, and the movie moves beyond the ending, exposing us to what the life of a princess is after we are told they ""lived happily ever-after.""

While predictable, the movie is adorable and we see our favorite characters come back to life through the mice, birds and Town's people.

Highly recommend this movie, especially now that the Christmas season is here. Makes a great children's present!",1353888000,,574,4.836734693877551
5369420,5,B009VUCOW2,"I pre-ordered this DVD through Amazon and received it this week.  It was sooner than I expected and my Grand-Daughter, age 9, and I immediately sat down and viewed both of them in our home.  We both enjoyed the video's and look forward to the next selections on pre-order to make decisions on whether or not to purchase.  I would recommend this offering to any and all.",1353715200,,369,4.477611940298507
5369421,4,B009VUCOW2,"I love it when Disney opens up their vault to bring back movies that have been off the shelf for some time and now they have done it again bringing two Disney movies back on one DVD/Blu-ray. Both of these movies had a cute storyline that my girls really enjoyed when they first saw them. While I do have to say that my favorite, and I think my girls' favorite of the Cinderella trilogy is still the original, the second and third movies in the trilogy add much to the overall story of Cinderella's life. You also get to know many of the other characters to a much deeper extent in the second and third movies too which in my opinion allows the viewer to go deeper into the overall story! I have heard both praise and criticism for both of these movies, but for me, as a fan of all Disney movies, I still have to say that overall, these movies were great additions to the overall Disney collection, and my girls enjoyed the opportunity to get see their favorite princess and her friends a bit more!",1352851200,,997,4.308510638297872
5369422,4,B009VUCOW2,"My daughters have wanted Cinderella 2 for a long time now, but Disney had discontinued it.  We have seen Cinderella 3 and really enjoyed the twist, plus a more in depth look into Prince Charming and the king.

These reviews are opinions and while some might not care for C2, others might - especially the girls.  I suggest that you give this collection a chance - I have 3 daughters (ages 2-8) and we enoy watching C2 & C3!",1343433600,17,423,4.329113924050633
5369423,2,B009VUCOW2,"I actually really enjoyed Cinderella III, but Cinderella II is horrible!

Cinderella II is a collection of shorter cartoons, and can't even really be called a movie. The animation is poor, and the story lines are kind of ridiculous, (Cinderella has to have a party, one of the mice wants to be human, and one of the step-sisters wants to date a townsmen.) Alone, Cinderella II would get one-star, and that would be generous.

Cinderella III is an actual full-length movie about what would happen if Cinderella had no magic. It starts on their first anniversary, but then Lady Tremaine, (the wicked step-mother,) gets her hands on the Fairy Godmother's wand, causing them all to go back in time to the morning after the ball, and causing Prince Charming to forget he danced with Cinderella. She remembers, and tries to get him back. It's a good story, and had a strong girl power feel to it. The mice provide great comic relief, and the characters are well developed. The animation isn't that bad for a sequel either. It's nowhere near as good as the original, but it is entertaining enough to watch more then once.

I would suggest looking for a single copy of Cinderella III if it's available at all, but save your time and money with Cinderella II.",1343260800,44,1250,4.672727272727273
5369424,4,B009VUCOW2,"I can't remember much about Cinderella II, other than it being the typical sequel movie (if I remember correctly it's about Cinderella trying to fit-in with the palace life).  However, the third Cinderella was very interesting.  When this movie first came out, it was heavily advertised about what would happen if the glass slipper was taken away--would Cinderella still get her prince.  So unless someone purchased it much later on than the original release it could not have been any surprise of what was going to happen.  This movie doesn't take away from the first movie--it just adds to the Cinderella story.

Spoiler Alert:

The movie begins after Cinderella is with the Prince and the Wicked Stepmom and daughters are miserable.  But then, the wicked step mom discovers the magic Godmother that had helped Cinderella and steals her wand.  She used the wand to turn back time before Cinderella was with the prince, but this time there is no magic to help Cinderella and the Prince.  I think the movie illustrates that with true love, it will find a way to work out.",1340323200,24,1071,4.808743169398907
5369425,2,B009VUCOW2,"I loved Cinderella all of my life. Saw Cinderella 2, and that was good, but C3 was TERRIBLE! I wouldn't bother with owning or watching 3. It was a poor attempt just to make some money in dvd sales.",1340323200,4,197,4.076923076923077

Nice to see sequels with stories which stand alone although I do wish that Disney would start adding to its creative departments folks who actually take the time to draw elaborate, beautiful layouts and stronger script writers.

I think for a little girl who is obsessed, this movie might be fine as ""filler"" and something different. However, the plot lines were kind of stupid. The second sequel is about one of the stepsisters getting her happy ending (true love). I'm not exactly a fan- since the first movie, I could care less about the stepsisters because they were the villains of the story. I don't exactly like the idea of villains getting ""rewarded."" The third movie was a bit better. The third movie is where time is altered and the prince forgets Cinderella.

It had something to do with the recording, because we sent the first one back and got a replacement one, and the second one did the exact same thing....it got stuck in that same scene the first one did.

My kids love Cinderella, though--so they really enjoy watching both of these films.  I agree with some critics--the animation might not be as lush as the Disney animated films that are released for theaters (vs. those that are made straight to DVD) and the songs/story line as strong as the original--but even so, these are pretty entertaining.  Plus, I like that the overall message of both movies is positive.  Plus, no swearing, excessive violence, sex, etc that seems to have crept into kids programming.

Well now that I have a daughter of my own I can't wait to introduce all the Disney princesses to her and I love that they released a Cinderella 2 and 3 on DVD from the Disney vault in a 2 Movie Collection.  I didn't even know they made a Cinderella 2 let alone a Cinderella 3.  Now as with all Disney sequels the quality is not as amazing as the original but it is still pretty good and the storylines follow the original movie.  Cinderella 2 is actually a movie showing Cinderella adapting as a princess and in Cinderella 3 it shows what would have been had there not been a glass slipper.  It basically shows that true love will find each other.  I liked both movies and will definitely be watching again with my kids.  This is a great DVD set to add to your collection if you have a little Disney Princess fan in your household.  I admit I was super excited to watch them.,1357171200,,1001,4.177083333333333

Cinderella II: Dreams Come True
As a newly crowned princess, Cinderella quickly learns that life at the Palace and her royal responsibilities are more challenging than she had imagined. There are three heartwarming tales that focus on life after Cinderella marries the prince. In the first tale, Cinderella's new role as princess involves her planning a large banquet and making some changes in the way things are done at the palace.  The second tale has Jaq feeling small and wishing he were bigger. The Fairy Godmother turns him into a human for awhile, and he learns to be happy with who he is as a mouse.  In the third tale, Cinderella's stepsister Anastasia falls in love with a common baker and her family is not too happy about it.  Cinderella finds out and encourages the match.

Cinderella III: A Twist in Time
Princess Cinderella is living a charmingly perfect life until her stepmother gets her hands on Fairy Godmother's magic wand. With a wicked spell that turns back the clock, she erases the Prince's memories of the girl he met at the ball and shatters Cinderella's happily ever after! Jaq and Gus scurry to save the day before time runs out. But was it all really just a dream in Cinderella's heart, or will true love triumph over all?

Bonus features include:
""Becoming a Princess"" - 1st edition
Musical Magic
""Put it Together"" Music Video
""Becoming a Princess"" - 2nd edition

Our Thoughts:  This was our first time watching Cinderella 2 and 3, the sequels to the Disney classic favorite, and they didn't disappoint!  Cinderella 2 is less like a full-length movie and more like a series of three shorter episodes, not all of them starring our favorite princess, but we still enjoyed it immensely.  It was fun to see a softer side to one of the previously mean stepsisters (Anastasia), to revisit the mice (Jaq and Gus), and to see how Cinderella is faring in her new role as princess.  Cinderella 3 is an actual full-length movie (well, a little over an hour) in which we find out what would have happened if somehow the glass slipper had been tampered with so that it fit one of Cinderella's stepsisters rather than Cinderella.  Both movies had my 4 1/2 year old giggling and she asked to watch them again after the films had ended, so I'm obviously happy with these.  I think anyone who is a fan of Cinderella or any of the Disney princesses will enjoy this combo pack!
