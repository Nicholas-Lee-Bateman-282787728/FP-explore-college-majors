8009685,5,B0001BKAPS,"Being an older adult, I got the chance to see all of  these episodes  when they were first shown on tv so it brought back a lot of memories.  My husband and I had a great time laughing and enjoying this fantastic comedian.",1426032000,,222,4.116279069767442
8009686,5,B0001BKAPS,"If you want to learn how comedy is done and where these guys get their material from this show will tell you. These comics are not original, they simply retell and recycle jokes and skits already written and performed by the creative genius and improvisation of Richard Pryor and Paul Mooney. The Richard Pryor Show Rats out these comic rip offs who consider themselves students of Richard Pryor. Oh by the way, that goes for our white and latino bruthas too passing themselves off as original. Make me laugh without using curse words, southern twang and put downs as the punchline. The card inside the DVD said Check Out my Website MF, that was an insult because Rich was more than profanity which was just honesty while he told his story, He was being Richard Pryor and he was a god of comedy and just an unmatched, unbridled GENIUS....",1378425600,,838,4.630872483221476
8009687,1,B0001BKAPS,"I don't have to reiterate the comic genius of Richard Pryor, but it is also a reality that the material of gifted talented artists cannot be manipulated or edited because it destroys the very essence of the talent, and whats left is only a very poor representation of the gift itself.  Thats what NBC did in this case.  Clearly Richard was too ""raw"" for TV in the 1970s, and so this should have never been attempted.  The failure of the show, when Richard himself cancelled it out of frustration, only confirmed this.  The only good episode was the ""Richard Pryor Special"" which is not included with Vol 1 or 2.  True Pryor fans will only be disappointed with these DVDs...I know I was, and I have been a fan his entire career.  Better off buying his ""Live"" concerts which are classics!",1265673600,3,786,4.539007092198582
