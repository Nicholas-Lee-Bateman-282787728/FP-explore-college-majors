8137509,2,B000H7OCF0,"Beauty is obviously in the eyes of the beholder because I found the acting in this one so bad that it was a joke. In addition to bad acting the story was so exaggerated as to verge on the ridiculous.

I would definitely suggest watching before buying.",1318118400,,251,4.340425531914893
8137510,4,B000H7OCF0,A rather good story of corporate greed and corruption.  Miners trapped inside a collapsed mine.  Oxygen running out.  HELP!  John Phillip Law and his crew to the rescue.  What is great about this movie is that JPL never takes himself too seriously.  If you're a JPL fan  --  don't miss this movie!,1169596800,,297,4.576923076923077
