8127658,5,B000FZEQTQ,"This show is like a breath of fresh air compared to what is now available for children's television.  Why do we not produce more shows like this one?  The book reviews are wonderful, the interviews are great, and the host doesn't speak down to children. We enjoy this series and it is a chance to get introduced to some great books out there.  My five-year-old is new to the show and she is enjoying it. I recommend the series. It is educational and enjoyable.",1359590400,2,460,4.4523809523809526
8127659,5,B000FZEQTQ,All Reading Rainbow titles are a must for your child's library.  The videos are not just standard videos; they really are an extension to your child's learning.  I have used them at home with my daughter and in my classroom too.  Very well put together.,1332374400,,253,4.5777777777777775
