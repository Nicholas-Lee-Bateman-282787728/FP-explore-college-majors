2378766,5,B000A7LR96,"I was talking to a friend one day about horror movies, and my friend asked me if I had ever seen From a Whisper to a Scream.  My friend basically looked at me as if I had eight heads and he responded with the comment and I quote ""You have not seen this movie and you call yourself a horror fan?""  so my friend in disgust refused to speak to me until I saw this movie.  I found the movie for a decent price, and needless to say I was blown away by this movie, I went into viewing this movie not expecting much as I thought it was just going to be some cheesy horror movie, little did I know I would be proved wrong. There are a total of six stories in this movie and they are rather graphic and gory.  The two that stuck out the most to me where the story about the necrophiliac, the love scenes between the guy and the dead girl was very disturbing, do not ask  just see for yourself.  My other favorite was the story of the glasseater, there is a seen in the movie where the glasseater meets his fate and I will say this in my years of watching horror movies this scene is probably the most gory and graphic scene I have ever seen, I challenge anyone to put anything up against it, nothing holds a candle to the madness that took place it that scene.  This is a great movie and I ashamed that it took as long as it did for me to stumble upon this movie. Hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did.",1213142400,2,1398,3.9537366548042705
2378767,4,B000A7LR96,"I really like ""From a Whisper to a Scream"", it caught me off guard. I was not expecting a truly depraved quartet of stories and was assuming it would be more in the vein of the Amicus Studios anthology films. Those were a little ""cleaner"" in their presentation and now seem dated. This film really captures the feel of the old ""Tales from the Crypt"" comic book and results in an excellent choice for horror fans. I especially liked seeing Vincent Price in the wrap around segments as he brings a nice air to the proceedings. The four stories themselves are truly ""out there"". They deal with things like zombie babies, glass eaters, voodoo and all the stuff that made the fifties comic book mentioned above worthwhile. The gore content is high and well executed, the acting is good and many fringe stars appear in this film. I think it is a great movie for Halloween. The only complaint is the last story is not as good as the other three. If you have a stomach for ""unclean"" horror, this will fit the bill.",1128902400,8,1006,4.4728260869565215
2378768,3,B000A7LR96,"The 80s saw a mini-resurgence of the horror anthology film format popularized in the 60s and 70s, primarily by a studio out of England called Amicus (affectionately known as `The Studio That Dripped Blood').  This new crop included The Monster Club (1980), Creepshow (1982), and this little, late entry nugget titled From a Whisper to a Scream (1987) aka The Offspring, to name a few...co-written and directed by Jeff `Mr. Sequel' Burr (Stepfather II, Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, Puppet Master 4), the film includes some notable performers like Vincent Price (The Abominable Dr. Phibes, The Monster Club), Clu Gulager (The Return of the Living Dead, Nightmare On Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge), Rosalind Cash (Tales from the Hood), and Susan Tyrrell (Big Top Pee-wee, Cry-Baby).  Also appearing is Terry `Bernie' Kiser (Weekend at Bernie's, Mannequin: On the Move), Harry `Grandville' Caesar (The Longest Yard), Cameron Mitchell (The Toolbox Murders, The Swarm), Ron Brooks (Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III), Miriam Byrd-Nethery (Stepfather II), and Martine Beswick (Thunderball, One Million Years B.C., Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde) in a small, but memorable part.

The movie is comprised of four tales of grotesque ghoulishness, tied together with a fifth, or wraparound story, featuring Price as a librarian/historian of the little southern town of Oldfield, Tennessee (Tenneseeing is believing!).  Seems the town, which has a dark and troubled past, draws upon people to do nasty things...the first tale proper features an almost unrecognizable Gulager as Stanley Burnside, a mild, mousy man with about the thickest pair of glasses I've ever seen.  Anyway, Stanley's got the hots for a babe he works with, but she seems hardly interested (not surprising as Stanley's got an creepy `albino' vibe going on).  Stanley finally manages to wrangle a date, but things go from bad to worse (worse being murder) as an obviously repressed Stan loses his cool (I'm thinking he probably should have tossed one off prior to the date).  Things get particularly weird as Stan wants a second date, even if he has to break into the funeral home to do so...the second story, set about thirty years earlier than the first, features Kiser as Jesse Hardwicke, a two-bit hood who, after being betrayed by his girlfriend, is shot, left for dead, and found by a resident of the swamp played by Caesar.  Turns out the old man practices some kind of voodoo, and has a valuable secret which Jesse, being the greedy, ungrateful, rat slimeball he is, will stop at nothing to acquire.  The third story, set in the 30s, features Rosalind Cash as a cruel and sadistic owner of a traveling carnival show that stops in Oldfield.  Seems most everyone who works for her has done something bad in their past, and now she provides them protection, asking only one thing in return...complete and utter devotion.  Did I mention she's a witchy woman?  The trouble begins as one of her `performers' tries to break free of her grasp.  The fourth and final story is set near the end of the civil war, and features Cameron Mitchell as an a-hole leader of a small group of Union soldiers separated from their unit.  Learning that the war has actually ended, the group decides to sack and pillage some towns, Oldfield being first on the list.  They get waylaid though, by a band of local orphans who've got plans of their own.

I liked the overall structure of the film, in that the intent being to show how the town was build on a history of violence, starting from the present and working back in reverse, chronological order.  As far as the individual stories, they were hit and miss.  The first was okay (Gulager especially good), but lacked the strong twist I was hoping for...it could have delivered a more powerful punch had the director not telegraphed the ending with text displayed on the screen (if you've seen the film, you probably know what I mean).  The second tale, however, did have a most excellent twist, and turned out to be the best of the bunch, in my opinion.  It kept things simple, which is probably why it worked better than the others.  This one actually reminded me a lot of the stories from the old EC comics like Tales of the Crypt, or The Vault of Horror.  The third story, the one about the traveling carnival, was my least favorite, as it had no real twist, was an anemic tale, and contained a whole lot of really bad acting, especially by Ms. Cash, who proved she could chew up the scenery as well as anyone.  The other thing it had a whole lot of was blood in a spectacularly pointless sequence.  I liked the fourth story about as much as I liked the third, which is to say not a whole lot.  It was interesting, and showed some promise, but eventually petered out, especially in terms of the expected twist ending.  And then there's the wrap around story...Vincent Price, looking pretty aged here, adds a lot to anything he's in, as he was an actor with incredible screen presence, along with being a consummate professional...too bad he wasn't utilized better than he was here.  I did like the notion of who his character was and how he presented the stories, but again, there was something lacking, and I grew tired of his character continually harping on the evil inherent in the town (yeah, we got the point by now).  The wraparound pieces in these horror anthologies general tend to be weak, but this one is especially flaccid.  Overall the direction throughout is solid, but the writing was lacking in general, producing one, really good tale, one so-so, and two not so hot.  I do enjoy a good horror anthology, and while I felt the effort was here, I have seen better...

The picture is presented in both fullscreen and anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) on this DVD.  The picture quality is decent, but I did notice some slight `graininess' resulting in a lack of overall sharpness.  It's not terrible, but I think it could have been cleaned up a little.  The Dolby Digital mono audio comes through well enough.  The only extra feature is a poor looking theatrical trailer for the film, which really is much of a feature, but oh well...

If you enjoy horror anthologies like this, I'd recommend checking out some other films like Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965), Torture Garden (1967)*, The House That Dripped Blood (1970)*, Tales from the Crypt (1972), Asylum (1972)*, From Beyond the Grave (1973), and The Vault of Horror (1973).  Not all are available on DVD at this time, but should be...

2378769,4,B000A7LR96,"1987's FROM A WHISPER TO A SCREAM (a.k.a. THE OFFSPRING) is a horror anthology that offers four fear vignettes tied together by a weak, though well-acted, wraparound featuring genre great Vincent Price. Price portrays the town librarian of Oldfield, Tennessee, whose niece has been executed for a series of brutal killings.  When a reporter (Susan Tyrell) comes snooping around for the ""story behind the story,"" Price explains that it is the town and its history that drove his niece to become a serial killer, and he illustrates his point by telling four supposedly true stories from the town's historical archives.

Yarn #1 is about a sexually repressed milquetoast who kills and then rapes women to relieve his urges, but one of his victims returns from the grave seeking revenge...or at least child-support payments.  This story is the lamest of the four.  Segment #2 is about a small-time thug who stumbles across the secret to eternal life.  Only problem is, the secret rests with an old hermit who practices voodoo, and the hermit isn't keen on giving up his knowledge.  Story #3 also involves voodoo, only this time it's a voodoo priestess who uses her powers to create freaks and geeks for her travelling sideshow.  When one performer decides he can no longer stomach a life in show biz, he suffers more than a mere case of indigestion.  The final segment is about a troupe of Union Soldiers who stumble into the hands of a band of Confederate orphans.  Their minds tainted by the horrors they've seen, the children have formed their own theist government and plan to dish out some justice to the hapless Yanks.  It's not hard to see the influence of William Golding's novel LORD OF THE FLIES on this yarn, and though one might also compare it to the screen adaptation of Stephen King's CHILDREN OF THE CORN (1984), this one is actually more chilling.

The wraparound ends the flick with a bit of a surprise ending, but it still just not as interesting as the individual segments.  Though Price and Tyrell do an outstanding job with what they are given, each of the vignettes also feature stellar performers--performers such as Clu Gulager, Rosalind Cash, and Cameron Mitchell, to name but a few--and since they are working with better scripts, it makes the wraparound come off as a bit disappointing.  Indeed, each of the individual segments, with the possible exception of #1, could certainly stand alone as a strong episode of TALES FROM THE CRYPT or NIGHT GALLERY.

Overall, then, most genre fans will really enjoy FROM A WHISPER TO A SCREAM, and the DVD from MGM will make a fine edition to any fan's collection.  It's relatively no frills, offering only the theatrical trailer as bonus material, but the double-sided disc does offer the film in anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) on one side and the full-screen butchery on the other.  Well worth the very reasonable price of admission.",1127952000,10,2897,4.869653767820774

2378787,3,B000A7LR96,"Ive always loved horror anthology films. Perhaps it was because the reminded me of the horror comics I wasn't allowed to read when I was younger yet always snuck a peak at when perusing the comic book racks. In any event when I was old enough to go to the theater on my own and a new anthology movie came out I was there. But not all played in my area. Thank goodness video at the time took care of that. But even with that this movie passed me by somehow. Now thanks to Scream Factory I have a chance to make up for that.

The movie opens with the execution of a murderess being witnessed by reporter Beth (Susan Tyrell) who then drives to the womans home, a building where she grew up in the town of Oldfield, TN. A library run by her uncle Julian (Vincent Price), Beth confronts him with the womans stories of how the town made her do the killings she was responsible for. Julian confirms the stories to a doubting Beth and then begins to tell her of the terrifying legacy of Oldfield via several stories.

The first involves a nebbish of a man played by Clu Gulager who lives in a home where he must take care of his grown sister. At work, he longs for a woman he meets there and eventually asks her out. Things don't go as planned and between the ridicule he faces at work and the forced care of his sister, he loses his mind, killing the woman. A bit of necrophilia, some possible incest and later on the true terror of his actions confronts himliterally.

Our second story involves a con man on the run from mobsters he owes money who escapes into the swamps only to be rescued by a possible voodoo priest. Nursed back to health, one day he begins looking at the things inside the mans cabin. When he finds pictures of the man dating back 100 years he begs him to give him immortality as well. But as they say, no matter how well made the plans might seem things never seem to go as you would hope.

The third story is the weakest of them all involving a glass eater at a carnival sideshow. When he meets a young woman in the latest town he falls in love with, the star crossed lovers temp fate as well as the leader of the sideshow group he belongs to. A gory ending will satisfy gore hounds but the story seems to take far too long to tell.

The fourth and last tale involves a group of Civil War Yankee soldiers led by Cameron Mitchell who run afoul of a group of children who seem to be in charge of their town. These same children worship a false god who cries out for blood. If it seems a bit like CHILDREN OF THE CORN that comparison has been made time and again by folks talking about this movie. Perhaps it isn't quite that but its easy to see where the comparison would come up.

The movie ends as it began with Tyrell and Price in the library talking about the horrors of Oldfield. Is she convinced after spending the night listening to Prices tales of woe? The only way to find out is for you to make an effort to watch this on your own.

Of the anthology films Ive been able to watch this one doesnt qualify as the worst one Ive ever seen. It does have some good spooky moments in it but nothing that I would call terrifying. Then again perhaps that depends on the number of horror films youve watched. For me it made this one a bit weak. The acting is solid, the directing works well but the budget limitations on the film show in various episodes on display here. That doesnt make it a bad movie, just not one of the better in this genre.

As always Scream Factory has done a great job of extras with this film. Included are stills from the film, the theatrical trailer, audio commentary by director Jeff Burr, audio commentary by producer/writer Darin Scott and writer C. Courtney Joyner, TV spots for the movie under its original name THE OFFSPRING, a documentary on making super 8 films during the 70s involving the film makers and a comprehensive documentary on the making of this film, Return to Oldfield: The Making of From A Whisper To A Scream that runs as long as the movie itself!

Fans of the film will be delighted with the package involved and want to add it to their collection. Horror fans will want to add it to theirs as well. For everyone else it makes a solid evenings entertainment from the 80s, a time when effects were yet to become the CGI spectacles they are now and everyone seemed concerned about their style choices. In other words its fun to go back and watch but not a place youd want to hang around in too long. In the end you will have a bit of fun with this one.",1431043200,3,4516,4.241860465116279
2378788,5,B000A7LR96,"A GOOD 80,S HORROR MOVIE WITH FOUR VERY GOOD STORY, THE BLU-RAY IS ALSO VERY GOOD ALL IN ALL WITH LOT,S OF EXTRAS,",1430352000,,114,4.0
2378789,4,B000A7LR96,"Scream Factory brings the forgotten anthology collection From a Whisper to a Scream to Blu-ray for the first time ever. Some horror fanatics might know the film by its other title, The Offspring. Director Jeff Burr and the screenwriters take the portmanteau formula and inject their own brand of bloodletting and revolting deeds of dementia into it. Their approach takes the art form to a whole other level of graphicness and disgust that couldn't be explored in previous decades.

Beneath the small-town exterior of Oldfield, Tennessee lies a history of shocking violence and terrifying phenomena, as recounted by local historian Julian White (Vincent Price). In the '80s, an office worker (Clu Gulager) nurses a deadly crush. In the '50s, a witch doctor (Harry Caesar) holds the secret to unending life. In the '30s, fighting breaks out in a traveling carnival over forbidden love. Finally, in the 1860s, Union soldiers discover a group of orphaned children with a deadly agenda.

When you see Vincent Prices name attached to From a Whisper to a Scream, your mind will drift to the classic films he made in the 1960s and 1970s, which were tame by todays horror standards. I assure you thats not the case here. The four tales presented come stuffed full of the gore and gruesomeness we all expect from 1980s genre movies.

From a Whisper to a Scream is rated R for violence and gore, adult situations, nudity, profanity, alcohol, drugs, smoking, and frightening and intense sequences. Necrophilia is insinuated which spawns a deformed monster baby in one of the most disturbing segments of the film. No nudity is shown in relation to sex. It was still unnecessary and added nothing to the story or plot.

Scream Factory packs the Blu-ray edition of From a Whisper to a Scream full of bonus material that will thrill collectors of the macabre. New audio commentaries are provided by Director Jeff Burr, Producer Darin Scott, and Co-Screenwriter C. Courtney Joyner. A feature length documentary about teenagers making Super 8 movies in 1970s Georgia is included. Director Jeff Burr, Producer Darin Scott, Co-Screenwriter C. Courtney Joyner, Actor Clu Gulager, and others star in a feature documentary about the making of From a Whisper to a Scream. It also contains a still gallery, foreign theatrical trailer, and TV spots.

From a Whisper to a Scream fits perfectly somewhere between other portmanteau films made in the 1980s like Tales from the Darkside and Creepshow and 1960s classics such as Tales from the Crypt and The Vault of Horror. Vincent Price serving as the teller of the sordid stories lends an air of nostalgia which leads the viewer to expect a bit more quality to what might be mistakenly thought of as just another attempt at an anthology collection. However, youll find yourself glad you made the trip to Oldfield as the ending credits roll.",1429488000,4,2861,4.976987447698745

I've said a great deal about American attempts to make horror anthology films since Creepshow, and it feels silly to reiterate it all here. From a Whisper to a Scream is another of those American anthology films where the framing device ends up working better than any of the stories therein, but unlike many movies of that stripe, the shorts in this one range from competent to pretty durned good, and the cast they dug up for this thing is pretty spectacular, with Vincent Price as the framing device's narrator and a solid B-movie cast with names like Clu Galager, Susan Tyrrell, Larry Kiser, and Lawrence Tierney delivering the fun. I wish Burr had pushed a little harder to try and send this one into the realms of Creepshow (though in hindsightBurr's later output would include Pumpkinhead II and the fourth and fifth Puppet Master movieshe simply might not have had it in him), but what we got is watchable enough if you're looking for a handful of short, sharp shocks. ***",1410134400,,1026,4.668508287292818

2378803,1,B000A7LR96,"Last night we watched 'From a Whisper to a Scream' (aka 'The Offspring') on Amazon Prime.  It was one of those horror anthology movies I often enjoy.  This film was from 1987. Here they used Vincent Price as the framing character that ties the different stories together. I figured with him in the film it might be decent.  Plus it had a 5.8 out of 10 rating at the IMDB. Turns out the stories were pretty sick.  Especially the first one about the killer necrophiliac who gets a surprise visit from the grave 9 months after an encounter.  The other sickest in the series was about some psychopathic and vengeful little orphan kids during the civil war.  About the only redeeming aspects to the stories was some really evil people get their comeuppance.  There was just one story about a guy in a carnival that was the exception to that.  In that segment two young lovers are forbidden to run off together by an evil female carnival owner.  She has strange voodoo like powers to give her performers weird abilities and keep them like prisoners working for her.  Anyway, the stories were a bit too sick and gory for my taste so I don't recommend it.  Why I didn't just turn it off after the first segment is a good question.  I guess I  hoped it would improve and I like seeing Mr. Price. He gave it his best as usual right to the end.  I give it a 1 out of 5 rating.",1362873600,6,1365,4.322834645669292

2378806,2,B000A7LR96,"I thought this horror anthology might be pretty good as it stars Vincent Price and the premise of four stories about a Tennessee town and the evil stuff that happened there from the Civil War to the late 20th century sounded intriguing.  Vincent Price appears in the wraparound story that links the four tales and though still very recognizable he was definitely past his prime when he filmed this movie.  As has become almost tradition in horror anthologies the wraparound ends with a ""shock"" that in this one seems totally unconvincing.  Of the four feature stories the first THE OFFSPRING has a lot of chilling if very distasteful aspects but doesn't make much sense to anyone who gives it a second's thought even by the standards of the horror genre.  The second story is probably the best though the plot and ending are nothing new to anyone who has watched THE TWILIGHT ZONE or anything similar on  made for network TV though admittedly those TV offerings don't leave the viewer with such a gory image as the end of this.  The third story is also ""OK"" especially if you like carnival freak shows and voodoo but the ending is  very blood soaked plus the final ""surprise"" didn't really surprise me.  And the last segment is set in the aftermath of the Civil War, stars some cannibal children and is nothing less than repulsive. So many better choices if you are in the mood for some short scary stories that sort of fit together into an anthology.",1287360000,,1451,4.640625

2378808,4,B000A7LR96,"I have been a fan of Vincent Price and old school horror for years but I never heard of this modern day anthology until just recently. Perhaps I missed it when it was retitled THE OFFSPRING and only played what was left of the drive-in circuit in the mid to late 1980s before disappearing into the night. Whatever the reason, it doesn't matter because I have finally caught up with it and I'm glad I did. It's no secret, if you read my reviews, that I prefer older horror films to today's effects driven gorefests. It's not so much about the gore as it is about the lack of atmosphere and the lack of theatricality in the performances. FROM A WHISPER TO A SCREAM manages to have its cake and eat it too. It's an updated version of all those old Amicus anthology films giving us old style performances with new style gruesome effects. Think of TALES FROM THE CRYPT (the 1972 film) or NIGHT GALLERY as directed by Rob Zombie and produced by George Romero.

There are four different stories linked together by the 74 year old Vincent Price who expounds upon the evil inherent in his hometown of Oldfield Tennessee which causes people to do violent and murderous things. The first story has mild mannered Clu Gulager killing a co-worker and then receiving his comeuppance from her offspring who was conceived after she died. In the second a wounded man discovers the secret of an extremely long life but at an awful cost. Story number three is there to satisfy the gorehounds as it tells what happens to a carnival glasseater who crosses the woman who first gave him the power. The last tale involves renegade Yankee soldiers led by Cameron Mitchell and a devastated Southern town inhabited only by children. This town turns out to be Oldfield and what happens here is the origin of the town's evil nature. Well directed by Jeff Burr (PUPPET MASTER 4 & 5) on a really low budget, this film apparently sat on the shelf awhile which is too bad because it's very effective although some may find the stories a bit too cruel. The DVD transfer looks great. Recommended for fans of both the old and new schools of horror.",1278547200,,2111,4.5552631578947365

8075904,5,B000A7LR96,"Labor-of-love project horror anthology picture features four sinister tales of the macabre wrapped around a frame story involving the Oldfield (named in tribute to the musician Mike Oldfield) town historian Vincent Price relating his many found secrets to a reporter named Beth Chandler, a rapacious but quietly sinister woman out to expose the truth about the town, and maybe Julian White (the historian) himself...
FROM A WHISPER TO A SCREAM may not scar many viewers today, but for its time it completed the fears of many moral watchdogs who felt that the 1980s video store horror boom was going to damage their children for sure, what with those lurid VHS tape covers and the seedy narrative terrors that awaited them on the small screen; ironically, FROM A WHISPER TO A SCREAM did receive a theatrical release (albeit not on a wide scale) but it was really geared more to make back its investment in the video stores after a wide home media release. Best among the film's segments, though, is the episode with Clu Gulager (doing a cinematically unforgettable combination of George McFly, Ted Bundy, and Delbert) playing a frustrated man who lives with his sister (yeesh) and works an unfulfilling job as a grocery clerk but ends up turning to both murder and necrophilia in order to break his dull plight in life--and things only get more seedy and fantastic from there! This segment inspired the title THE OFFSPRING (which was not christened upon the film by the creative team but rather by the early distributor The Movie Store) but I have always preferred Jeff Burr's original title myself. Other anthology segments offer a few provocative thrills, but FROM A WHISPER TO A SCREAM is really more about the process of people trying to make a movie more so than it is about people who know how to avoid every narrative trap in sight. Still, it's a picture that remains entertaining and worthwhile, due to its nostalgic flavor and for its TV-movie like style, which calls to mind programs such as ""Matlock"", ""Tales from the Darkside,"" and the 1990s TV series ""Swamp Thing"" as well. I first saw this picture on DVD (packaged with a copy of ""Theater of Blood"", also featuring Vincent Price) and even then I knew it was an unusual horror offering (mostly because of Clu's grotesque segment). It was obvious that the picture was not put together by the Hollywood factory and that an independent series of minds was instead behind its creation. There is a criminal lost in the voodoo flavored swamps segment, a cannibalistic children segment, and even a glass-eater at the circus segment, some of which do reflect Gothic literature of the American South, some of which reflect the late-night B-horror film, but all of these segments reflect the love and labors of their creators. If you haven't thought much of the movie prior to this release, Scream Factory will put it all into perspective for you and show you how to better respect and appreciate these lower-budget, genre related films.
Scream Factory's scholarly breakdown of the complete conception, making of, and eventual distribution and release of this picture is what makes this disc a must-own property, and perhaps the finest work that Scream Factory itself has done thus far. The extras offered on this disc are invaluable, and offer enough inspiration and insight for any and all struggling producers and writers out there to go ahead and pursue their own cinematic dreams. An extensive documentary entitled ""Return to Oldfield"" has the most complete interviews imaginable with director Jeff Burr, producer Darin Scott, and even co-screenwriter/novelist C. Courtney Joyner as they all offer how they came to work together on the film and the somewhat precarious routes that they travelled while trying to get the picture finished. The disc is a serious must-own for horror fans for Jeff Burr's story about how the filmmakers talked Vincent Price into coming aboard alone (although I am personally hoping that this disc will also get more viewers interested in seeking out some of director Burr's other work). A regional film made by kids and young hopefuls who wanted to conquer the industry, ""Return to Oldfield"" walks you through every aspect of this charming (if not quite professional) production, and may make you feel quite inspired (or envious) when considering Jeff Burr's major hutzpah in planning, preparing, and eventually shooting his very rough (but still entertaining) film. Scream Factory's documentary leaves no stone unturned when it comes to investigating what it was that made this picture tick, and it may make you question why some of their other (more high brow) releases have not delved quite so deeply into the intellectual and physical backgrounds of their respective film productions. Still, Burr charms the beast in his interviews, and especially in his audio commentary track, in which he pulls no punches concerning the picture's production and his own relationship with the insurmountable Vincent Price (""It's s***! It's sh**! It's s***!""--apparently Price was a gentlemanly man and erudite in his choice of words, except when it came to working with lower-level filmmakers!). Equally as charming and humorous, but nowhere near as informative or on task, is the Courtney Joyner and Darin Scott audio commentary, in which the two are quite hilarious in recalling working on the production--unfortunately, they get off topic quickly and they don't share as many juicy details about the film as us fans would appreciate. Yet another terrific extra is the 68-minute gem ""A Decade Under the Innocence: Adventures in Super 8 Filmmaking"", which traces the evolution of the 1970s Georgia-based filmmakers from young boys to young men as they pursue their own cinematic desires through the avenues of low-budget, independent filmmaking. What an inspiration it was to see this documentary! The Super 8 days helped to build Burr into a stronger independent filmmaker, but the documentary never lets you forget the fact that he had a lot of help along the way on the producing/business side, namely from his brother Bill and his close friends (some from his own neighborhood). This is almost like a secret history of the low-budget, regional film, and it moved me in ways that I had not anticipated, and it is never less than informative and enjoyable. Burr and friends grew up in a close-knit small town, and when he first began entering film festivals as a boy the response was less than enthusiastic, but nonetheless he knew that by the time he co-directed a Civil War drama entitled ""Divided We Fall"" that he would be on his way to Hollywood to become someone (for me, I'm glad that he didn't become another Spielberg or Craven). Burr's story shows us what can be done when a director has a limited cult following and fewer funds; in fact, the lower-budget picture should have become the norm, but it was quickly enough displaced by all of these greedy, Cameron-esque big budgeted travesties that sacrifice entertainment for political correctness and big star salaries. Without the big money, one is certainly limited, but within these limits great things can be achieved--and no big paychecks have to be wasted upon unworthy talents in order to secure these measures of B-level greatness. Burr and company were having fun pursuing film, and he eventually made a career out of it--but for my money, he's best when he's held back in these carefree lower budget days (once he moved closer towards Hollywood's grip, he quickly lost the free feeling spirit of his more personal independent productions). Watching what these boys came up with on Super 8 is quite entertaining in itself, but the ideas offered by this home grown documentary are refreshing and memorable and now have erased all of my doubts about Scream Factory being the number one company putting out the most quality Blu-Ray home media packages available.
The picture and presentation on this disc is about as good as we are ever going to see of this film (keep in mind that your Blu-Ray image won't look spectacular exactly, since this movie was shot on the old Mitchell camera of the type that Hitchcock used to use and as such the remastering is limited in terms of picture sharpness and grain removal) but the audio track is fine, especially through a good set of large headphones. Thankfully, Scream has given us nerds a complete Blu-Ray package with this one, offering us the reverse wrap around cover art for the Movie Store's OFFSPRING poster art on the flip side of this insert sleeve. Lastly, my copy came with a touching, print tribute letter to the viewer from Jeff Burr himself, praising not only his hard-working brother Bill Burr (the brains behind the film's financing) but also the production staff who stuck it out even when the production became difficult for all involved. It is printed on a kind of blue, light cardstock sheet and it fits snugly inside your Blu-Ray case. In short, if you are interested in filmmaking and you want to see how a real labor of love should be approached, get this Blu-Ray and learn how it's done. I had a bit of trouble playing the theatrical trailer on my personal Blu-Ray copy, but other than that this is the best edition of this picture that anyone can hope for.
Sadly, the market for these kinds of horror/exploitation films has changed drastically and really there aren't many ""real"" films like this being made anymore, certainly not for the kind of markets that these young boys were trying to target (and did successfully target at the time). With this respectful and engrossing tribute to Jeff Burr's movie, here's hoping that Scream Factory has LEATHERFACE in the works for a deluxe edition, double disc Blu-Ray set featuring the fully uncut version of that movie. Given what we now have with this excellent Blu-Ray package, I would guess that further Burr movies might be cued up for future Scream releases, or at least his horror genre offerings. This Blu-Ray set has set the bar quite high, and it will keep you busy for quite awhile if you take the time to investigate its many tremendous features. A+++",1458432000,3,10117,4.944770857814336
