5763855,5,B00CZCZCUY,"This is a fantastic advanced workout that keeps you moving the whole time, works your whole body, and will leave you drenched in sweat.  I'm an avid exerciser who regularly runs , strength trains, and incorporates various HIIT workouts into my weekly schedule.  I have run half marathons and have tried many different advanced workout videos and classes. I have this and her Peak 10 cardio Inteval burn remix, and they are hands down my favorite workout videos.  Michelle is upbeat and high energy the whole time.  There are no breaks that lower your heart rate unless they are intentional, such as a return to basecamp to help you reboot.  You will burn major calories and feel like you haven't wasted a second of your workout.  I am left with that exhilarated winded feeling that I used to get after an intense sports practice and am excited to try it again tomorrow.  An intense workout that I look forward to!  I will be buying more of her Peak 10 series.",1376611200,4,959,4.6
5763856,5,B00CZCZCUY,"Excellent mix of cardio and strength training.  One of my favorite workout videos right now.  It is tougher than Michelle's Cardio Interval Burn, especially if you use heavier weights.  Definitely for a more advanced exerciser, but all the moves can be modified.  Love it!!!",1375056000,3,274,5.159090909090909
5763857,5,B00CZCZCUY,I love Michelle Dozois and have the first two Cardio Strength DVDs.  I am an advanced exerciser and have been looking for ways to ramp up my exercise and this one did the trick.  Michelle is great with cuing and is so motivating.  LOVE it!!!,1374105600,2,241,4.311111111111111
5763858,5,B00CZCZCUY,"Great workout!!  I was looking for a challenge and this was it.  I can barely make it through this without stopping.  I am sure in a few weeks I will be better, but I was sweating buckets.  If you are looking for a fun and intense workout try this!!",1372204800,,249,4.020408163265306
5763859,5,B00CZCZCUY,"Peak 10 workout series is made up of 5 blocks of exercises, each repeated twice (hence the 10 in name) In the first two blocks, you start to breath just a tad bit heavier and say to yourself, 'Hey this isn't that tough', and then the fun begins. Starting with Block 2, Michelle turns it up to 11 and you start sweating, muscles shouting. Despite all this difficulty, I am never aware of how fast 60 minutes flies by. There are some moves I have not seen anywhere else which is another big plus for this program.

Overall, very highly recommend for advanced level exercisers.",1370908800,8,574,4.466666666666667
8587876,1,B00CZCZCUY,For the cardio I wish I could give zero stars-she moves so fast with not enough reps before she switches to another move and I found myself getting so aggravated that I wound up doing my own moves-several cardio moves she also has you using heavy weights and this made it hard to keep proper form-several hours later I had such bad neck pain. Some of the strength moves I really liked so if it were a strength only review I may give it 3-4 stars. I really liked her Cardio Strength workouts from her Peak Fit set but I doubt if I'll do this again anytime soon,1509840000,,559,4.185185185185185

8587878,5,B00CZCZCUY,It is a great DVD. Very challenging.,1493164800,,36,4.285714285714286
8587879,5,B00CZCZCUY,"Like other posters have said, this workout is a lot of fun.  Even though it's really challenging, the hour flies by.  It's a great mix of cardio and strength training.",1469145600,,167,4.533333333333333
8587880,4,B00CZCZCUY,"I'm very athletic and work out 6-7 days a week, so I wanted a DVD that's challenging and this one didn't disappoint! I've done it twice so far.  The first day, I discovered that I needed heavier weights as I was not as challenged by some of the strength movements.  I went up from 5 lbs. to 8lbs and it made a huge difference the second day! I have a library of DVD workouts including Turbo Fire, Insanity, and Taebo series so I wanted something new to the mix.  Michelle's ""warm up"" doesn't include stretching,, so I do my own prior to pressing play.  While the movements are pretty fast paced,( both the strength and cardio),"" I was able to catch on after a few minutes (she does each ""block"" twice around).  The only thing I don't like about this dvd is t hat I'm not a big fan of pushups, so I do another exercise when she does them.  This definitely isn't a beginner workout, IMO, so if you're new to working out, start out with something easier like Turbo Jam or one of the beginner Taebo's and work your way up.  I really like
Michelle!  She is motivating, does a great job at cueing the movements and the quality of the video was surprisingly good!  I will be adding more of her workouts to my collection!  As an added bonus, the 55 minutes flies by!  I couldn't believe that although I was working hard, the time went by fast!",1442966400,3,1335,4.278884462151394
8587881,4,B00CZCZCUY,"There is not much of a warm-up for this workout.  It is for the advanced exerciser, I am intermediate/advanced, so this workout was a challenge to keep up with from the cardio side, and she does move quickly--which is nice.  However, I do weights, too; so, I wasn't  sore after completing this workout--think I need to increase my weights.",1410912000,,339,4.711864406779661
8587882,4,B00CZCZCUY,"This workout was hard, but I was able to catch on to the movements by the second time I did it.",1404000000,,95,3.5714285714285716
8587883,5,B00CZCZCUY,Awesome really great hard workout great music really Michelle duzois is  about as good as it gets if you like a tough workout,1401926400,,125,4.434782608695652
8587884,5,B00CZCZCUY,I really liked this workout.  Gets both my cardio and muscles going! I liked climbing the mountain.  Getting to the peak was very satisfying.,1388534400,,141,4.833333333333333
8587885,4,B00CZCZCUY,I like Michelle Dozois' Peak 10 workout. I like her music and HIIT approach. I prefer a 25-35 minute max workout;her format does not make this time interval easy.,1386720000,,162,4.620689655172414
