Armed with is Canon Cameras, Art show why he is a pro and give us insights on how to become a great photographer.

If you desire to buy this series to learn about specific , highly techie details about camera equipment, tripod brands, image stabilized lenses and techie techie, this is not for you, though you will see cameras, tripods, filters and such; It's just that that is not the point of the series. Instead, this is about craftsmanship, art, creativity and splendid, stunning imagery.

8337773,5,B001RDIOAC,"I've admired Art Wolfe's photography for years, but his Travels to the Edge series is the best I've seen. I recently bought both season 1 and 2 after seeing many of the episodes on TV, and they are all outstanding. Not only is Art's photography excellent and artistic, as you would expect, but the video footage shot by the members of his team is amazing. As an armchair world traveler, I don't have a favorite episode, they are all good. You can learn about season 2 locations on his website at

His wildlife and landscape photography is wonderful, but he also captures people with such sensitivity and humor that allows you to gain a deeper understanding of their culture and how they interact with their environment.

These dvds are for everyone whether you are interested in wildlife conservation, travel to exotic locations, or how to take good landscape photography.",1235779200,14,878,4.846666666666667
