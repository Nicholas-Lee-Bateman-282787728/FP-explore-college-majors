1333058,4,B00003TKFT,"If atomic bomb explosions fascinate you, then this is a must-have collection. There are three DVDs:
1. Trinity & Beyond
2. Atomic Journeys
3. Nukes in Space.
Trinity & Beyond documents the history of the A-Bomb tests from
July 16 1945 (Trinity test) to the last atmospheric Test (by China in 1964)
Atomic Journeys visits numerous US & a few Soviet Test sites and there is plenty of footage of explosions at each site.
Nukes In Space deals with among others the Rainbow series of space atom tests - some of which knocked out communications (and worse) in the USA for many hours afterwards.
This collection would have gotten five stars from me but for a couple of minor niggles.
1. Particularly in Trinity & Beyond, the DVD could have done with being an extra half-hour longer to allow longer footage of the various A/H-Bomb tests. As it stands some of the sequences appear very hurried. For instance, the footage of the first H-Bomb test (Ivy Mike) is butchered to hell and the superb original soundtrack is ruined, which IMO spoils some of the most spectacular footage of a nuclear test ever shot. And on occasions the original footage of some tests has been dubbed with CGI enhancements which don't enhance but detract from the viewing experience.
2. There is a heavy USA bias and at times a slightly nauseating USA patriotism portrayed in the DVDs. Understandable I suppose considering they are made in the USA!
But don't let these gripes put you off buying. This is on the whole a well-made, informative and strangely compelling set of DVDs which contain a lot of atom test footage that has never been shown elsewhere. The collection comes highly recommended!",1073692800,13,1662,4.774305555555555
1333059,5,B00003TKFT,"This collection is essential viewing for anyone interested in this subject.
I live in England and had heard of these DVDs but was never able to find them. I finally found them... and ordered them. Boy was it worth it.
The images of the detonations are spectacular, beautiful, and absolutely terrifying. Couple this with superb narration, research, and extra features, and you have probably the best all-round documentary on the history, science and politics of nuclear warfare around.",1052956800,7,484,5.217948717948718
1333060,5,B00003TKFT,"In what is probably the most dramatic look ever at the U.S. atomic weapons program, the Atomic Bomb Collection is a stunning and oftentimes frightening realization of what man can create.  Using declassified footage from government archives, you can now view material never shown or reported to the public.
The material shown on all the discs is remarkably clear, well defined, and visually impressive.  The audio for all programs are in Dolby 5.1 surround sound and, believe me, will give your home theater system a serious workout.  Each disc also contains a large amount of special features that make this set a very worthwhile value.
Trinity And Beyond is the starting point of it all.  You are treated to the inside story of our atomic program from it's infant stages at the Trinity site in Alamagordo, New Mexico and continuing on to designing, making, and producing hydrogen thermonuclear weapons.  The footage of hydrogen bomb testing in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific ocean is truly astonishing and disturbing both at the same time.
Atomic Journeys: Welcome to Ground Zero is probably the most outstanding of the lot showing dozens of bomb detonations in startling detail.  Much footage is relegated to the Nevada Test Site which was openly known in those days to conduct such tests.  What wasn't widely known to the public is that subterranean detonations were also performed in Mississippi and Alaska and some other areas.  This footage is featured also and is quite unbelievable.  One subterranean detonation in Alaska was so large (incredible footage here), it permanently changed the landscape of the surrounding area.
Lastly, we have Nukes in Space: The Rainbow Bombs.  This is the least interesting of the 3 discs but still has good material to offer.  You are shown nuclear detonations, performed by the U.S. and Russia, in our upper atmosphere.  Whatever the intentions were by our scientists, this was probably not the best of locations to test atomic weapons especially considering the bombs affected radiation belts around our planet.  Pretty scary.
If you're interested in the entire history of our atomic program from start to finish, look no farther than here.  This is the premier collection that won't ever be matched.  Highly recommended to everyone.",1049932800,20,2282,5.113207547169812
1333061,5,B00003TKFT,"This set of 3 documentaries is both visually stunning and very engaging. All 3 movies are very interesting, but i would say that Trinity And Beyond is the coolest of the bunch. It is a little more sweeping than the others, and covers a more broad amount of general information on the history of nuclear weapons. It also has the most actual bomb footage, and the DVD extras- like the 3D short movie on a Nevada test site, are fantastic.
  Nukes In Space has some startling footage of atmospheric nuclear testing which resulted in rainbow auroras and electromagnetic disturbances. It also dives into the space race and how it was connected to the nuclear arms race, very interesting stuff. Atomic Journeys is pretty cool too, but just not quite as exciting. The movie returns to ground zero at several different nuclear sites, and then proceeds to dive into the history of the site. Both Nukes In Space and Atomic Journeys have great DVD extras as well.
  All in all, this set contain 3 great documentaries with some truly spectacular and frightening footage. All 3 DVDs are presented wonderfully- from the way cool DVD menus to all the extras they packed on, Goldhil Home Media and Peter Kuran have presented a wonderful addition to anyones DVD collection.",993340800,3,1255,4.796296296296297
1333062,5,B00003TKFT,"THIS IS MEARLY A COMPOLATION OF NUCLEAR BOMB DOCUMENTARIES WHICH I ALREADY  OWNED. IT CONTAINS THE SHORTER VERSION OF TRINITY AND BEYOND: THE ATOMIC  BOMB MOVIE, ATOMIC JOURNEYS, ATOMIC FILMMAKERS, AND NUKES IN SPACE. ALL OF  THESE ARE VERY SOUND WORKS, BUT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE MOST OF THEM, DONT BUY  THE BIG BOX THINKING YOU'LL GET SOMETHING EXTRA. BUT LONG LIVE PETER KURAN.  HE IS DOING MUCH, TO HELP PUSH THIS CRUCIAL KNOWLEDGE INTO THE MAINSTREAM  CURRENT OF THINKING. THIS IS INFORMATION WE ARE NOT ONLY WELCOME TO KNOW  ABOUT,..BUT WE ARE ENTITLED TO KNOW WHAT AMREICAN MILITARY AND POLITICAL  OFFICIALS DID WITH THE USE OF THE BOMB! IT IS OUR LEGACY AS AMERICANS, AND  MOSTLY AS HUMANS. IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN ANY OF THESE, BUY THE WHOLE THING  NOW, BECAUSE THEY ARE ADDICTING. ONCE YOU'VE SEEN ONE, AND KNOW THAT  THERE'S MORE TO IT, YOU WANT TO COMPLETE YOUR KNOWLEDGE. THESE ARE  BREATHTAKING, INFORMATIVE PIECES OF ART, IF I MAY. THEY ARE MORE THAN  DOCUMENTARY WORKS. THEY ARE NOT YOUR STALE HIGH SCHOOL BUSY TAPES. THESE  TAPES CONTAIN IMAGES OF MANY OF THE NUCLEAR BOMBS WE TESTED. WANT TO SEE A  BOMB GO OFF THAT'S 50 MILES WIDE? BUY THIS SET AND SEE.",968716800,8,1166,4.592233009708738

7919435,5,B00003TKFT,"This is a collection I'll always own & usually watch at least once a year.  Welcome to Ground Zero is great if your planning a trip to visit any of the test sites as they provide almost every detail you need. It also includes Trinity & Beyond, the best video on the subject out there. The copy of Trinity & Beyond included a set of 3D glasses & a short 3D feature on the Nevada Test Site. Cheezy, but I adore that kinda thing. Nukes In Space is great as well.. you won't be disappointed.

The movies took 3 days to show up and were in excellent condition. 50 dollars well spent!",1298073600,2,578,4.151785714285714

7919437,3,B00003TKFT,"The BBC released the great mini-series ""Oppenheimer"" on Region Two DVD(PAL) format last year.

This great mini-series is still felt to be the best re-creation on film of the people and events leading up to the explosions of the atomic bombs in August 1945. A young SAM WATERSTON plays Oppenheimer brilliantly.

It took years for the BBC to decide to release the series in DVD format, and then it was only in Region Two (PAL), the format used in the UK.

You'd think that they'd release it on Region One (US format), given the fact thatit starts Sam Waterson. However, it has not yet been released in the US.

The three-disc series, which also stars a brilliant David Suchet as Edward Teller, is available thru Amazon in the UK (www.amazon.co.uk) and on eBay in the UK ([...]) for about $22.00 plus shipping.

Multi-format players are available in the US. It is my understanding that they have to be hacked to play other formats than Region 1,? due to licensing restrictions. I purchased an inexpensive player on eBay (US), which with shipping cost $50.00. The supplier provided the easy instructions to adapt it to Region Two format.

It is worth going to all of this effort to view again this great mini-series, which was virtually ignored in the US when it was shown here, but which remains unrivaled for both its acting and its accurate re-creation of the events surrounding Oppenheimer, his downfall, and the creation of the atomic age.",1189209600,3,1440,4.763052208835341
7919438,3,B00003TKFT,"Overall, this is a somewhat mediocre set of movies.  Depending on what you are looking for, this may not be the set for you.  I bought these movies in anticipation that they would deliver, for the most part, good footage of atomic explosions (maybe that wasn't such a good assumption on my part).  In the end I was rather disappointed.  While Trinity and Beyond was perhaps the most 'exciting' of the three movies, even that fell quite a bit short of what I was hoping for.  In Trinity, what I found was more or less scattered segments of this and that with probably about 10 minutes or less of what I would call really good footage.  There wasn't much information either on that video - in case you were at least hoping to learn something.  The other two seemed to be more informative than Trinity, however they largely lacked actual video shots of nuclear explosions.
I was also disappointed that in the parts you thought were really interesting and cared to see, they seemed to be cut short and you end up only getting a 'taste' of the action.
There are some decent scenes, but they are rather few and far between (if you're going for the action-packed stuff).  If you're looking to be educated on these films, I don't think you will be entirely disappointed, but you may want to look around and see what the market has to offer.  So far, I'm unable to recommend anything, as these are the first videos I've bought myself.
This was my general impression of this set of videos.  Looking back, and given my disposition, I think that if this were priced about 10 dollars lower, I would probably consider it a worthwhile purchase.",1184284800,10,1629,4.5479452054794525
7919439,5,B00003TKFT,"This collection of atomic bombs footage is chilling and horrific. If seeing atomic destruction fascinates you, this is the collection for you. A couple of good books on atomic bombs are 100 Suns and Shockwave. 100 Suns has 100 pictures of atomic bomb detonations. Shockwave tells the inside story of the crew that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima. Both are very good.",1144195200,2,364,4.887096774193548
7919440,5,B00003TKFT,"The Cold War is a very interesting period in history.  For the US and the world, many important events were happening, and these events tell us much about the key historical figures of the times.  And, like all good hsitory, they tell us a lot about human nature, strenghts, and frailties.

The nuclear weapons race was a key part of the Cold War.  The development of these weapons and the technologies associated with them are an interesting story of science, engineering, and politics wokring together to address the difficult issues of the day.  Having said this, this forms the backdrop for the films in this package, which focus mainly on the development of the weapons and their testing.  This presents a fascinating story and provides the opportunity to show many mesmerizing and nightmare-inducing images.

The explosions and tests in these films visually show the power of these weapons.  I found myself getting chills down my spine numerous times as the power and destructive ability of the bombs were shown.  And, at the same time, many of the images are hauntingly beautiful, kind of like seeing a huge tidal wave or powerful storm.

These films are also interesting documentaries about the types of testing and data collection needed to develop a technology like this and understand its impact.  Experimentation is needed to validate theorectical scientific understanding, and much was unknown about nuclear technology when these weapons were being developed.  It's interesting to get a sense for what was done to build the knowledge base needed to understand this technology and its implications.

For anyone who wants to understand the Cold War, scientific development, or nuclear technology, these films are highly recommended.  The music and narration also help to make them compelling and enjoyable to watch.

I thought that this information was presented with little or no detectable political bias.  The films were focused mainly on the US programs, and they did not empahsize much the developments in the Soviet Union or China, etc., as context, but they did not seem to be strongly pro or con to the US and it's work.  That's how documentaries like this should be done.",1128038400,7,2191,5.0584958217270195
7919441,5,B00003TKFT,"Nukes are like, soooo cool! I hope I get to see a real one some day. Excellent footage in these DVD's, well put together. And narrated by Captain Kirk! I highly recommend this set for all nuke freaks. Interesting glimpses of life and culture in the 40's and 50's also. Soundtrack has hints of ""Red October"" and ""Posieden Adventure"", and even the first Star Trek movies. Also some politico stuff - there were liberal pacifist wimps back then too, just like today with the Gulf situation.

Nukes in space is my favie - a very well put together documentary, with cool videos of nukes as well as early rocket and missile tests (and failures). Hints of the old ""B"" movies and ""Outer Limits"", complete with sound effects.

Videos of underground tests and the blast damage are very interesting, also air bursts and space bursts, called ""rainbow nukes"". Gotta Luvit!

What I wonder is, we spend gazillions of $ developing this technology, why don't we ever use the dang things? Like now in the Gulf? Just two of these cuties put an abrupt end to the biggest war that ever happened!",1107648000,6,1073,4.636842105263158
