There is simply nothing approaching the drek which can be found in our country.

i might give this comedy five stars if i hadn't already seen BLACKS BOOKS, AB FAB, ONLY FOOLS AND HORSES, VICAR OF DIBLEY, PIGLET FILES, FAWLTY TOWERS, JEEVES AND WOOSTER, FAWLTY TOWERS, etc., etc., As it is though, this is very good tv.

It involves a group of adults in their 20s to 30s who get together for a book group.  They are supposed to be talking about the book but very few actually do that.  What develops instead is a series of friendships with some romantic entanglements.  Two of the women start out with professional soccer playing husbands. These men are portrayed as utter dolt jocks.  I would accuse this of being a stereotype except they are so hilarious doing it that one does not want to accuse them of anything. The women involved with the jocks are looking for something else, especially the one married to Jack, who ends up hilariously becoming an advocate for UK agricultural rights, of all things!

Although our heroine is Claire from Cincinnati, eventually Claire's sister is brought into the show.  I may be alone on this but I thought the sister was comedically better than anyone.  She is this blunt talking women's rights activist set loose among the polite Brits, who don't know what to make of her.  She delivers this utterly deadpan as well.

There are a bunch of romantic sequences where the characters imagine themselves as people in a fairy tale setting.  This is one thing I did not like about the show. I also found Claire's boyfriend obnoxious but not funny obnoxious.  He often came across as repulsive instead.

Well I would say that wouldn't I? As they choose Kerouac's
On The Road as their first book for discussion. But seriously
(and I was being serious)- it's a lovely sit-com, or whatever
you might call it. Wonderful actors, brilliant script, - and
Annie Griffin - are you married? I found it very engaging,
- the Scottish footballer's wife is outstanding (or do I mean
entrancing?)- both! They're all great, brilliant British
production, shame it was made by a Yank!
