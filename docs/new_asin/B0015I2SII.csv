8258675,3,B0015I2SII,"I bought this movie after reading strong reviews on it. Let's start with what I liked about it. The first 15 minutes had an interesting spy thriller story. And the ending was kind of cool. But...
Look, I realize that this is a Christian movie. I'm a Christian, myself. But you don't need to always use a sledgehammer to drive a point home. The middle of the movie is basically 2 short evangelistic messages delivered by the lead actress. She somehow manages to convert both her prison guard and the government agent sent to save her. In 15 minutes. It kind of felt contrived to me.

The acting was okay. The cinematography was pretty good. But the story could have been fleshed out better. The scriptwriters committed a cardinal sin of writing on this movie- they told a lot, but showed little.",1393200000,2,794,4.591549295774648
8258676,5,B0015I2SII,"The music is vey good and Vern Jackson does a great job singing.  I think anyone who likes Christmas music would enjoy this and especially the song, ""Daystar"".  It has an excellent message and it's a song for any time of the year not just at Christmas.",1389312000,,252,4.340425531914893
8258677,5,B0015I2SII,"The story is engaging, powerful, and exciting. Excellent for the whole family.

Set in the Cold War, a bible smuggler meets a Jason Bourne and the results are explosive. The movie deals with making hard choices, standing for what you believe in, and hope in hard time.

If you like action and family movies, this is for you.",1285804800,,324,4.568965517241379
8258678,1,B0015I2SII,"Not as expected. I was expecting a full length movie and received a short skit! Less than an hour long. Acting was sub par and unrealistic, even from a spiritual point of view. Had a sense of being rushed through the short film from start to finish. The desire to do a good work for Christ is A plus.",1243728000,,300,4.101694915254237
8258679,5,B0015I2SII,"I just purchased this from here two weeks ago an very good film. It was short, but it was great and everyone just did an awesome job and this was worth getting. interesting Anthony Tyler Quinn(Best known for Mr. Turner on Boy Meets World and he's an awesome actor) played Bill Donley, who works for the US government and in the end, gets emotional, but everything turns out great in the end and sends out some good messages.",1218412800,3,424,4.448717948717949
8258680,4,B0015I2SII,"Smuggler's Ransom is written, directed, and produced with a passion not only for creating a finely-crafted Christian film, but in presenting both a strong, plausible story, and God's life-changing message of hope and love. The actors deliver excellent performances that serve the story well. Anthony Tyler Quinn stands out depicting his struggles between what he does, and ultimately, who he is. This film would have benefited greatly from a larger budget as the directors would have been able to develop the characters' back stories more. Even so, with the story ""cutting to the chase"", the plot holds together and the message of God's love for each of us, no matter what we think we are, is loud and clear. A great effort from a film-making team certain to be noticed in this genre.",1215129600,8,784,4.902255639097745
