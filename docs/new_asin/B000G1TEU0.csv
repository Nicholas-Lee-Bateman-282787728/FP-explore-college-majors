8128653,5,B000G1TEU0,"This DVD contains Pictures and Music Files as well, but the core content are the ""Demos"". It does not matter if you are familiar with the ""Demoscene"" or not. It does matter if you remember the Commodore 64 computer from the eighties or not.

If you do remember the C64 or owned one and if the memories are good ones, this DVD is for you. Showcased are several older Demos, but also newer creations that were released when the C64 was declared ""dead"" and Intel PCs with 3d Gfx Cards became the defacto standard. The interesting thing about those newer creations is that they utilize the absolute maximum amount of resources the machine has available to demonstrate abilities that would even the C64 creators make their head shake in disbelieve.

The only thing I miss are some of the legendary demos like Smash Designs - Second Reality Demo from 1997, Fairlights Legoland III Demo from 1993 or some Oxyron Demos, but I think space was limited and sacrifices had to be made. Hey, you can find Camelots Tower Power Demo on the DVD. If you loved the C-64 then I am certain that you will love this DVD.

For the non-demoscener:

If you owned a Commodore 64 and remember the old cracktros before the games that you got from your buddy at school and the programs that were nothing else but a long crack intro with several parts (also called demo), then you will love this DVD.

Sure, you can download all the demos free on the Internet (they are public domain) and get them to work on your modern PC with Emulation software like WinVice or CCS64, but are they not more enjoyable on your TV screen? I don't know where you had your C-64 hooked up to, but most people I know had it up and running on the TV and not a fancy monitor like your PC today.

The blur of the TV screen also blurs the hard pixels of the low resolution, causing the images to appear much smoother than they actually are.

It's also easier, just as it was to load the stuff directly on your C-64, no configuration needed, no tweaking to get everything to work, just load, play and enjoy.",1155254400,5,2050,4.4217506631299734
