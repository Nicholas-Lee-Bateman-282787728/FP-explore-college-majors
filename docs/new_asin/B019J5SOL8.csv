7575892,5,B019J5SOL8,I have watched this film every night since I bought it and each time I get so overwhelmed and overcome by the sacrifices our brothers and sisters are making everyday to live for Christ. This is a must see for every Christian.,1453248000,2,225,4.380952380952381

7575894,5,B019J5SOL8,"Hearing from the men and women in this film is humbling and inspiring, unlike anything else I've watched. Well worth the one hour!",1453248000,,130,4.695652173913044
7575895,5,B019J5SOL8,"This film is cinematographically breath taking and is a humanizing, compassionate wind in the midst of much heated discussion and fear. It is most definitely a hugely helpful resource for all Christians (and any other person, for that matter). It gives clarifying insight into the persecuted church in the Middle East and the realities of the daily hardships for our surrendered brothers and sisters. It is a sobering look into an overwhelmingly tender region of the world. It is an excellent resource for singles, married couples, families, churches, small groups, friend groups, etc. Host a screening, watch it in your free time, or turn it into a date night--but watch it!

They mean another to folks born and baptized in Muslim-majority nations of the fundamental variety, who face very different decisions and consequences than we do about something as simple as ""church on Sunday."" You'll be encouraged, challenged, and deterred from sensationalism and xenophobia. This isn't about ""good guys vs bad guys."" This is about making much of Jesus where He isn't known becausein the words of one of the interviewees""firstly God, and secondly the people going to hell, are worth it.""",1453248000,3,581,5.258064516129032

8745372,5,B019J5SOL8,"Incredible and moving. I have seen many missions-based films and this one (by far) takes first place. Well written, incredible production, and a great soundtrack. The best part? It provokes you to take action.",1454284800,2,209,5.176470588235294

8745374,5,B019J5SOL8,"I have never seen a film that drew me into the world of the underground church in the Middle East as this film did. The cinematography is amazing, the dialogue is brutally honest and inspiring, and the call to Middle Eastern missions work is solid and impassioned. It's massively important for every Christian in the West to watch this film.",1454198400,2,341,4.7
8745375,5,B019J5SOL8,"The most humbling film I've seen. The Christians in this film are remarkably gentle and humble about the danger they face daily as they minister in restricted nations. Amazing, and totally worth the one hour it takes to watch ;)",1453852800,3,228,4.725
8745376,5,B019J5SOL8,"This film was an amazing eye-opener for us westernised Christians on the reality of what it means to follow Christ in the Middle East. Meet the people, including  former radical Muslims who have turned to Christ, and who have counted the cost and prepared themselves spiritually and mentally for the day that they will be beaten, jailed, raped, tortured, killed, etc, simply for choosing to follow Jesus. Meet also the people who have given up all in order for the name of Jesus to be heard and known where He has not yet been known, and to be the ""hands and feet of Jesus"" in war-torn and devastated areas in the Middle East. Hear them share about their journey of self-denial and losing their cultural Christian identity to find their identity in Christ alone. This film is deeply inspiring and thought-provoking, an inspiration for unchallenged Christians, and an encouragement for suffering Christians. Great for watching in small groups followed by discussion!

This very timely production has also given me a larger, broader perspective of the Great Commission, one that has direct relevance to the events and conflicts happening around the world today and their eschatological significance. It draws a biblical and radical conclusion as to how we as Christians should respond to the evil (e.g. ISIS, persecution) that is happening today in the Middle East. Be convicted, be challenged and be called.

Finally, take a peek into Middle Eastern Islamic culture with the breath-taking cinematography; the film is shot in various locations in the Middle East. It is accompanied by a haunting and soul-stirring soundtrack. Having watched Frontier Alliance International's (FAI) other films such as ""Better Friends Than Mountains"" and ""Covenant and Controversy"", I would highly recommend FAI's films for their scripturally-informed and well-thought-out convictions, passion, and relevance to present-day events. Show this to our brothers and sisters in Christ!

I set a reminder on my iPhone ever time you announce a release date because I've learned so much watching them: End Times Eyewitness, Better Friends Than Mountains, Covenant and Controversy, and now Sheep Among Wolves.
