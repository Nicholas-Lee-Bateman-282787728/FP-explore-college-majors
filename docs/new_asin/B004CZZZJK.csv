My husband and I are on different sides of the argument and we both found appreciation in the thoughtful critical thinking.

8424270,4,B004CZZZJK,"This production represents (for me) one of the best treatments of a very delicate and controversial topic in the U.S., at that time (1999) and now. There are so many points of view from all sides of the argument that a complete presentation of all points of view would be difficult, if not impossible. This production, however, did as good a job as I have seen with this basic conflict of ideas and morals in our U.S. society and deserves much more recognition than it has received over the years. Perhaps if it were brought back in prime time TV and the hard liners on both sides were forced to watch it everyone would benefit greatly.",1402531200,2,636,4.491379310344827

8424273,4,B004CZZZJK,"La eterna pugna entre la libertad de la madre de disponer de su cuerpo y el derecho a la vida del feto.
Me parece que fue tratado con mucha seriedad y la manera en la que razona su voto el Ministro de la Suprema Corte, en la que involucra ambos derechos, ambas libertades, sus implicaciones; pero las liga con el derecho a una vida digna de los nios no deseados, creo que fue sensacional.
Realmente la recomiendo.",1306108800,4,413,4.376623376623376
