8165782,5,B000M2DNJ6,"This DVD is great for many reasons. First, it offers us a look at a rare art seldom heard of outside of China (with the obvious exception being California.) Secondly, the instructor, Wang Cheng An, shows very clear applications to all 78 movements from various angles. Third, the movements of the form are explained step by step, in a very precise manner.

The subtitles could have been a bit clearer, they do get the message across, and do not detract from the overall quality of the DVD. While it is impossible to learn from a DVD, this product is certainly a good start for those who are already familiar with Taijiquan, and don't have access to an instructor.",1260489600,,663,4.61864406779661
