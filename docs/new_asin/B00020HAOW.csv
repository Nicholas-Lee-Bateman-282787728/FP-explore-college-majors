8450496,5,B00020HAOW,"A Spanish platoon of soldiers is set down in Kosovo to ""protect"" the local populace and to carry out humanitarian missions. They are sent to the section of the area known as Kosovo and there begin to suffer what is really war. An excellent turn by Eduardo Noriega as the platoon leader and Eloy Azorin as Private Vidal will leave you both in wonder and saddened by what the troops went through, for no real reason at all.",1298678400,,421,4.410256410256411
8450497,4,B00020HAOW,"We often watch world conflicts on TV and think they could never occur in our own country: we're too civilized to surrender ourselves to such brutal behavious. This thought is one of many that haunts a group of Spanish peackeepers in the embattled Serbian province of Kosovo. The troops represent a spectrum of personalities: the pacifist, the trigger happy, the professional soldier, the UN translator with conflicting loyalties, the soldier who wants no part of somebody else's conflict and who just wants to go home. As they undertake their duties - rebuilding a Church, restoring electricity to a town - the conflict becomes their reality. They are swept into it, and far from being the placid observers & peacekeepers they think they ought to be, they now must fight for their own survival. They slowly begin to lose that veneer of civilization that they though only they possessed, the same patina these embattled locals once had, but lost long ago. The director based many of the stories on actual events as told to him by Spanish soldiers returning from the region. It is filmed in a very gripping and heavy way - drawing you into it all, along with the lost soldiers. It drew great acclaim at the Toronto International Film Festival, 2002. For those who followed the events of the last decade in the Balkans, it is a stark and honest portrayal that will leave many re-thinking the versions they may have formulated in their own minds, reading newspapers and watching TV, comfortable, in their own very civilized, and very insular, homes.",1082246400,7,1545,4.8783269961977185
