2701961,5,B000LC3IB0,"I generally try to resist rebuying updated special editions, or Blu-ray versions of a film that I already own, but once in a while I make an exception.  In this case it turned out to be a pretty good decision, as the Terminator 2: Judgment Day/Total Recall Blu-ray two pack is economically priced, and features some decent looking transfers of two of Arnold Schwarzenegger's action classics.

Of the two films, the Blu-ray of Terminator 2 (1991) is more impressive, as the image quality is more vibrant and sharp.  While the disc isn't loaded with extras, you do get a 2003 commentary by director James Cameron and William Wisher, as well as a cast commentary from 1993.  This is the 137 minute theatrical version of the film, not the 154 minute extended special edition.
Rating: *****

The image quality of the Blu-ray for Total Recall (1990) is sharp at times, but there are also scenes that look dull, dark, or grainy.  Looking at the film now, it may be hard to believe that Total Recall won an Oscar for special effects, as they don't seem that impressive today.  Adapted from a story by Philip K. Dick, Paul Verhoven's futuristic adventure is still a very entertaining watch, but the spotty quality of the Blu-ray, and a lack of significant extra features, besides a generic featurette called Visions Of Mars, is a disappointment.
Rating: ***1/2

For those who do not already own these films, this a sweet deal at around $11.50.  Even if you already own previous versions, the Blu-ray editions are still probably worth having, particularly Terminator 2.  Don't get rid of your older editions though, as they may contain bonus materials not included on the Blu-rays.",1301702400,2,1671,4.831578947368421
2701962,2,B000LC3IB0,"If you already have one or both movies on DVD, you do not need to buy this 2-pack on Blu-Ray.  Each movies is on its own Blu-ray disc and the back of the box claims it is in 1040p.  Maybe it is in 1040p, but high rez of a grainy, dark transfer is not worth looking at.  If you like the movies enough to want to own them, avoid this collection.",1300233600,5,343,3.8028169014084505
2701963,3,B000LC3IB0,"Total recall is nice movie in my memory. So I bought it and disappointed. Because bluray is not better than dvd version.

Anyway I think total recall is not perfect bluray version.
But terminator is good even though is not perfect.",1300147200,,231,4.634146341463414
2701964,5,B000LC3IB0,Beware purchasing this may mean you're going to watch both movies back to back with whomever you give it to.  Really good deal for the two movies.  Saw them individually for the same price at Best Buy.,1297123200,2,201,4.405405405405405

2702036,5,B000LC3IB0,"I like Arnold Schwarzenegger, so I had to have this two-in-one.  I don't like the remakes, so I buy the original movies.  You have to watch Terminator 2.  The movie is more than two hours.  It was great!  Total Recall is the same.  There is more to the movie than you think.  It was nice to see a movie without parts of it cut out.",1427932800,,331,4.0

2702073,5,B000LC3IB0,Enjoyed the movie. A bit biased because Arnold is one of my favorite action heros. I would recommend it to all action movie fans.,1407283200,,129,4.416666666666667

2702076,4,B000LC3IB0,Arnold was me and my brother's favorite action star. I bought this for my son and he loves it. It's funny because who would think that we would both enjoy something from that many years ago? Looks better on the big screen TV then our small one but great quality either way.,1349481600,,273,4.269230769230769
2702077,5,B000LC3IB0,I placed this order on a weekend and during the following week it arrived as scheduled. It is a quality product with superior movie quality. I would recommend this to others who are looking for these two awesome arnold movies,1315958400,,225,4.65
2702078,1,B000LC3IB0,I was really disappointed with the Blu ray transfer of Total Recall. It's just like the first DVD I owned with many areas of grain and uneven pic. T2 is simply ok but could have been much better. If Red Heat and Running man can have good transfers I fail to see why they didn't care about this set. Time to stop ripping off customers. Very sad.,1303603200,10,344,4.149253731343284
