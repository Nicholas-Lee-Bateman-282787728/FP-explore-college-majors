4460900,5,B004RIW1S0,"I just got my Zen Garden Waterfalls DVD a little while ago. Love it. Very relaxing. There's just something about water flowing and waterfalls in general that I find very calming. Good music too. (Better than the usual New Age dreck one gets on typical relaxation videos.) Images are beautiful, lush, dreamy even. Also, when I pushed my DVD remote control audio button I found that it has a nature sounds only track too, which is great because sometimes I'm in the mood to just listen to the wind and birds without music. I find that Waterfalls is now my favorite relaxation DVD to put on when I come home after a long day at work. Highly recommended.",1334448000,4,650,4.516949152542373
4460901,3,B004RIW1S0,"The video portion is very nice.  However, the music is repetitive and the clacking bamboo in the music after 20 minutes is so distracting that I muted the sound.  Natural sounds only of water, birds, etc. would have made for a much better presentation.",1334275200,11,252,4.704545454545454
4460902,5,B004RIW1S0,"This DVD is amazingly gentle.  The flow of water is soft and calming.  The color quality is excellent with slowly changing scenes, filling you eyes with dazzling color delights, giving color therapy with every fluid scene. My mind drifts peacefully as I feel my shoulders, stomach, and body yielding to the complete sense of relation that the gentle flow of water bring. Listening to the everchanging sound of water, I am reminded that every second is different than the last, each moment bringing newness. I can tell you that each scene is vastly beautiful and it is; but I realized halfway through my breath had slowed and became more even, and that seems more important to say.  It is the effect that great video and music have on our minds and bodies that make us reach for that special one over and over.  This profoundly moving video is to be experienced deeply and fully with nature sounds and all your senses. When played with music it brings a joyful and playful element to your surroundings.  In writing this review, it is important for me to share how I experienced Zen Garden Waterfalls, as well as how much I appreciaate the work and love that went into the making of this very special disc. Use the waterfalls to create any mood you like for a quiet dinner, reading, healing treatment, tai-chi,etc.  The music is well chosen as it works so perfectly with all the waterfall scenes.  Let this be a water massage of your inner being, sit quietly alone and experience the restorative and healing power of the sound and sight of cascading water.",1300492800,26,1554,4.670329670329671
4460903,5,B004RIW1S0,Very relaxing and comforting.  Well produced and the visuals are great on this video.  My hubby even loves it.,1423699200,,110,4.7368421052631575

4460905,5,B004RIW1S0,I keep this one or Reefscapes on during the day for ambiance.  We seldom have the TV on for viewing during the day so this works great.,1414281600,,135,4.0

4460910,1,B004RIW1S0,we bought this to run on a big screen and the resolution is so poor we do not use it. It would be fine if just for personal use on a smaller television or screen.,1403049600,,162,3.657142857142857
4460911,1,B004RIW1S0,"The video is only ok. The problem is that the gardens and ponds were dead. Not one bird or creature in the whole video. A beautiful garden like this should have had the presence of nature not just nature faking. I would return this, but it is not worth the energy.",1389052800,4,264,4.196078431372549
4460912,3,B004RIW1S0,"I've always found running water and waterfalls very soothing...so, i love just about ANY 'Rain' or 'Waterfall' relaxation/Zen/Meditation dvd.  This dvd was okay....but I was hoping for some footage of some really BIG POWERFUL WATERFALLS! (ala' Niagara Falls)  The waterfalls in this dvd were medium to small size.  At some points....I thought I was watching little man-made water gardens in someone's backyard.  I would have preferred long continuous static shots of big waterfalls with no editing or fancy cuts.  The footage here has an assortment of waterfalls, with nice editing, auto replay of the entire sequence, a feature for music and natural sound audio...or just natural sound...or just music.  The variety of different waterfalls means you won't get bored and you get more bang for your buck---but I personally found it very distracting, with the video constantly changing to different scenes.  Just when you start to get into one waterfall....the video cuts to something new.

But these are minor complaints and personal biases.  All in all....this dvd is very helpful with relaxation, meditation, and a useful tool as a good 'soothing background ambiance' for bathing, napping or getting a massage.

I recommend this dvd.",1387238400,4,1234,5.314432989690721
4460913,2,B004RIW1S0,I love these types of DVD's and have a significant collection. This DVD showed about 3-5 minutes of one scene and then moved to a different part of the waterfall for another 3-5 minutes...and then again and yet again. What a disappointment!,1384128000,,240,4.738095238095238
4460914,4,B004RIW1S0,"great DVD.  look under reviews to see how to play with/without music over the waterfall sound track.  wish there were instructions on DVD.  wish I could choose one waterfall scene and stay there without transitioning, but still a very peaceful and beautiful movie.",1380153600,,264,5.093023255813954
4460915,3,B004RIW1S0,"I bought this after carefully determining that the soundtrack could be with or without music. I was looking for the water sounds alone but thought the music option would be nice. Although the package lists two soundtracks the only one I get is with music. There is no disc menu that I can access with my player and I am stuck with the music. It is not offensive, but as it is not what I wanted or bought it irritates me, defeating the ""relaxation"" intent.",1379635200,4,455,4.364705882352941
4460916,4,B004RIW1S0,"I just love the sound of the music and whenever I'm a bit too stressed, I turn it on and just listen to the soothing sounds of the water and the pictures are really quite helpful as well. It put me in a quiet frame of mind.",1366156800,,223,3.765957446808511
4460917,5,B004RIW1S0,"I bought this for a friend going through life changes, to help her relax and meditate.  She reports that she absolutely loves it!",1359504000,2,129,4.608695652173913
4460918,5,B004RIW1S0,"I am a stroke survivor with depression, anxiety, panic disorder, PTSD, agoraphobia, sleep disorder, and I still have ongoing mini-strokes. My counselor told me that I needed a way to be able to get myself calm during panic attacks or anxiety. So I purched the digital copy of ""Zen Garden - Waterfalls"". The music and images of the waterfalls, that I use with my Kindle Fire, are so relaxing and beautiful. I can't travel very much, so this video helps me feel like I've gone to an exotic relaxing place. It helps calm my nerves, and if I put it on at night time I usually fall right to sleep. It is just what I needed to calm my nerves and take me away to a far off beautiful land. I highly recommend it if you need to relax, get away from it all for a bit, and need some serenity in your life. Being a single mother hasn't been easy either, so it helps me when my kids overwhelm me. It's worth the price to find peace again.",1356912000,11,925,4.173184357541899
4460919,5,B004RIW1S0,really nice scenes and great music.  soft new age style meditation music. really enjoy playing this thru out the day.,1354233600,4,117,4.85
4460920,5,B004RIW1S0,Nice to have as background sound.  Everyone that comes over wants to know where I get these videos.  I love them!,1348790400,3,113,4.333333333333333
4460921,5,B004RIW1S0,"This video felt refreshing, almost like bathing in the waterfalls. The soothing musical accompaniment contrasted nicely with the lively water, and the compelling images of the water falling drew the eye. I like the sight and sound of water, and find it very relaxing.",1341792000,3,267,5.090909090909091
4460922,5,B004RIW1S0,"I love this DVD! I am a displaced northerner stuck in one of the hottest deserts on the planet, so for me, this DVD is worth it's weight in stormy weather! Believe me, here, stormy weather is a rare and treasured treat.  Not that this video has storms on it, hehe, but the waterfalls, trickling cascades and visuals are more than enough to satisfy my need. This video has two sound options with which you can toggle back and forth between using the audio button on your TV's remote. One of them is a very new age spa element filled track graced with sounds that inspire, refresh, soothe and enrich. Not exactly a music track, this ambiance brings an element of modern zen with an aire of polished simplicity. The second track embodies the visuals within the imagery itself, matching what you see on screen. The natural sounds track goes right along with the water; trickling, bubbling and refreshing coolness pours from your screen in such a way that you might actually feel like you have that water element in your home. Very real sounding, if that makes sense. The visuals in this DVD are vivid, vibrant and clear, well selected and artistic. In one of the scenes, my favorite, you'll peer through a pine branch towards some rushing water. When this scene comes on especially, I always feel as if the room just got a little bit cooler, as an imagined breeze introduces the smell of the needles into my livingroom. It's powerful stuff! All pretty words aside, I really do mean that! This DVD takes you on a mini vacation to someplace else! They do a fantastic job bringing the images to life, in such a way that you truly do feel transformed, reinvigorated and physically renewed. I rely pretty heavily on this DVD as I have seasonal affective disorder here with the lack of seasons, and can say the effect is profound. I like to leave this looped when I have company over, and get many compliments. In my dealings with the company itself, I have been most impressed and touched by their kindness! I had to contact them once due to a question about their audio set up, and have nothing but nice things to say about them. Buying this DVD online is not a risk, it is a gift that keeps on giving because it introduces you to them. They have many titles that are not on this particular site to see, and I have experienced quite a few (5 to be exact) and am continually delighted and curious to see what they will come out with next! Please, if you are looking for something that will transform your home into a place of refreshment, relaxation and hospitality, buy this DVD and follow the link on the packaging to see their other titles while you're at it. You will be hooked for life! I love being able to change the feel of my home instantly without having to redecorate, being able to go on tropical vacations without cracking open a suitcase, and I love this company! Please make a STORMS DVD!",1337904000,18,2894,4.501901140684411

8439090,1,B004RIW1S0,I waited in anticipation for this DVD.  I was very disappointed as to its quality.  The pixelation was off and it looked like a patchwork quilt.  I do not know if just this one DVD was defective but I think it is not a product made in the US so it does not play well our US DVD players.  I tried it in both of my high quality DVDs and had the same outcome.  The DVD also has an extra ring around it on the back which is not common practice of DVDs made in America.  I would suggest communicating with the seller before purchase.,1463788800,,528,3.980952380952381
