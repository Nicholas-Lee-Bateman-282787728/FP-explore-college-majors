960023,5,6305074143,Damn this video production. it is the cause of my having to get a new 68cm television set..and a good one..a Leowe. A musical delight..a technical achievement. Choreog and staging is SIMPLY wonderful. The sound is  astonishing and it all complements the great talent and artistry of so many  ALWebber performing devotees. I wish I'd been in Albert Hall. I'd have  flown from Sydney. Let's have the DVD version now. Please..and more from  this production team.,916704000,,459,5.0

I hadn't a clue that she had a voice like that. The drama she brought to the  number was superb. Buy this video and share it with your friends.",915580800,,286,4.607843137254902

960026,5,6305074143,"This is the best concert I have ever seen!  A must for all Andrew Lloyd Webber Fans!  Michael Ball was amazing in all his songs, including Vaults of Heaven.  Antonio Banderas sang beautifully with songs from Evita and  Phantom of the Opera.  Although, I wonder why Michael Crawford was not  included in the concert.  He should have sung Music of the Night instead of  Sarah Brightman.  The Boyzone were terrific with No Matter What.  Donny  Osmond singing Any Dream will Do and Close Every Door is wonderful.  Also,  the two Whistle Down the Wind versions were spectacular.  Most of all, the  finale featuring all the cast members singing Love Changes Everything, just  took my breath away. MORE POWER TO MUSICAL THEATER!",914889600,,721,4.8347107438016526
960027,5,6305074143,Excellent video. Captures many great performances featuring all of the works of Andrew's except Jeeves and Tell me on a Sunday...I wonder why? Some of the editing is obvious (people disappear off of the stage too  quickly) I question why Antonio Banderas performed the role of the Phantom  in the Phantom of the Opera portion- were none of the other Phantoms  available? Too busy smashing chandeliers I suppose. Overall a very  entertaining video that you will want to share!,911520000,,475,4.974683544303797
960028,5,6305074143,"This is such a good video! It has songs from almost all of his musicals,  and they're sung by very good people. There is also one song from his  musical in work-the sequel to the Phantom Of The Opera! This is a must buy  for all ALW fans!  END",906768000,,243,3.8979591836734695

My daughter was so excited to get this concert for Christmas. If you are an Andrew Lloyd Webber fan, this concert is for you. The performances are outstanding with Elaine Paige, Glenn Close and Michael Ball being the standouts. Sarah Brightman is amazing on her songs from Phantom.

960187,5,6305074143,"I like most all of ALW works, and many of them are performed well here, but Glen Close knocked me out with her two performances, absolutely beautifully done.  I suppose mostly because I see songs sung by lots of folks but don't believe I have ever seen them with such a combination of singing and acting.  Elaine Page in Cats did the same, but here the costume didn't really get the feeling. Good entertainment here and very re-watchable with an easy to use ""pick the song you want to hear"" feature.",1478563200,,499,4.472527472527473

960251,3,6305074143,"Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything by Andrew Lloyd Webber, or these performers.  I enjoyed most of the songs on this DVD... it's just that if you are going to spend money there are much better selections available for Andrew Lloyd Webber.

This DVD is a birthday celebration of Webber where a small group got together and sang songs from his most popular shows at the time.  Additionally, the 'extras' were absolutely nothing ... as in nothing... just one little interview with Glenn Close.  Nice, but NOT something I'm going to ever watch again.

I was hoping this DVD was going to be on par with his 25th Phantom Celebration... and it wasn't... not even close.  This DVD goes to the library!",1475798400,2,701,4.658536585365853

960893,5,6305074143,My family wore out the VHS version of this so it is a joy to have the DVD. Highly recommended,1395100800,,93,3.7
960894,4,6305074143,The only problem is the video was made in the old days with 4:3; probably the best technology then but looks just old. Singing and show itself were great.,1394841600,,154,4.344827586206897
960895,4,6305074143,"I had hoped for more music from Starlight express.  In addition, it had a number of repeats of certain songs such as ""Whistle Down the Wind"".  But otherwise, the video and music was great.",1394323200,,188,4.5
960896,3,6305074143,"The content was wonderful-there were 8 skips in the DVD within 10 minutes! If the dvd wasn't flawed, I would have given it a 5 star rating!",1393286400,,139,4.185185185185185

960968,5,6305074143,"Wow I must have played this 20 times over the first day I got it. Having singers performing parts they did in the Andrew Lloyd Webber productions in one place, is so great. Do not even need to watch, just listen it is spectacular. What a tribute to such a talented man. You can put the captions on and  sing a long, if you had not known the lyrics before.",1392854400,,355,4.071428571428571

960970,2,6305074143,"Gosh, was I ever surprised and disappointed in this DVD.  All the black & white costuming was tedious which would not have been a problem had the music been good.  There was such talent there but some of the songs dragged to such a slow tempo that I finally just went through the 'song selection' in the menu and listened to only those ones that I really liked, but after hearing them sung, didn't like them quite as much afterwards.  There was once a show on TV with an evening honoring Andrew Lloyd Weber and quite a few excellent singers were in it, unfortunately, I thought this DVD would be like that - it wasn't.",1391126400,,618,4.356521739130435

960973,3,6305074143,"It was OK but not the best.....of course, anything Mr. Webber produces is good to begin with....the singers can only help make it better.....or worse......in this case it was a case of 50-50.....so I gave it an OK.  ( I'll keep the DVD tho )",1387929600,,241,4.355555555555555

961103,2,6305074143,"I bought this DVD because of the wonderful comments. Sure there were some good numbers,but for the most part the emphasis  was on visual and camera work,many of the songs were too loud,and the quality of the performance was not there.

This is a surprise 50th birthday party for ALW and many celebrities were on hand to play and sing his music. It was a treat, eye and ear candy. I was disappointed Madonna wasn't in it to sing Don't Cry for Me Argentina as I thought she owned the part of Eva Peron but, other than that, this was a great celebration of Andrew Lloyd Webber's talent and genius.",1361145600,,456,4.193181818181818

I would recommend this most highly to anyone who loves musical theatre and the excellence Andrew Lloyd Webber brings to the stage.",1354406400,,385,5.278688524590164
961205,1,6305074143,This was such a major disappointment. I expected the musical tribute to Andrew Llyod Webber. Instead it was a series a narrations by singers followed by ads for dvd in the series. there was a small trailor but one never could actually see the performance at all. A total waste of money.,1349136000,3,286,4.519230769230769

961208,3,6305074143,"I really enjoyed the ballads with Sarah Brightman, Antonio Bandaras, Elaine Paige, Donny Osmond,  and Michael Ball, and others, but truly disliked the upbeat and jazzy numbers a lot. A mixed bag to be sure!",1341792000,,206,4.885714285714286
961259,5,6305074143,"This DVD is a must have for all Andrew Lloyd Webber fans!

With commentary from Glenn Close (who starred in the musical version of 'Sunset Boulevard' as Norma Desmond and for which she won a Tony) and Donny Osmond (who starred in 'Joseph and the Amazing Techincolor Dreamcoat' and played the lead role) both of whom never knew that they would ever be in Operetta musical before-but later would be. They too have well done numbers in this concert as well.

Antonio Banderas gives a wonderful performance with the 'Evita' tribute; just as well as he did in the film version and 'Phantom of the Opera' tribute with Sarah Brightman.

Sarah Brightman still brings perfection in the songs from 'Phantom of the Opera, The' which made her a household name.

Elaine Paige does amazingly in her version of 'Don't Cry for Me Argentina' and really knows how to convey emotions; along with her performance of 'Memory' from 'Cats'.

Everyone else also does wonderfully in this concert as well and deserves just as much credits as the ones who've become major successful thanks to these Broadway shows.

The choreography for this show is polished and well organized.

This is a DVD of pure enjoyment for all and is a must have for every Andrew Lloyd Webber fan who loves his brilliant work.",1337212800,,1275,4.742081447963801

961415,2,6305074143,"I just finished watching this and decided to look it up online to see who sang what since I didn't recognize all of the artists. I was shocked to see all of the ""5"" rave reviews.  There are certainly some excellent performances, but many weak ones and the production value of the recording is very sub-par in my opinion. There are very awkward cuts between several numbers, a few really poor wardrobe choices and miscasting. I can't believe one reviewer said that Antonio Banderas is better than Mandy Pantinkin. Huh? Oh, well, guess everyone is entitled to their opinion. Besides the bad production, the order is very odd at the end. There is a big number that seems like a great finale, but then several other numbers are ""tacked on"" at the end. I'm not sorry that I watched it because good composition is good composition and I did enjoy a few of the performances very much. Michael Ball in Jesus Christ Superstar and Glenn Close doing Nora Desmond made the whole thing worth it for me. But I certainly would not buy this for a friend, recommend it to anyone to purchase or watch it again.",1245456000,,1092,4.543147208121828

I was prepared to love the DVD; I was not prepared to spend $300 in the 2.5 months following the purchase of the DVD buying up all the Michael Ball items I could get my hands on--including joining his fan club.

He steals the show, and you absolutely fall in love with him from his first song. Words cannot describe...so I will not even try.

As for the other performances, Elaine Paige was amazing, of course. Antonio's Evita performances were very enjoyable but found him lacking in Phantom. Tina Arena gives a powerful performance, and Donny and Glenn were better than I expected.

Outside of Memory and Ball's performances, my favorite has to be ""No Matter What"" by Boyzone. They give boy bands a good name.

This DVD will be watched and re-watched and become a household favorite but be prepared to become hopelessly devoted to Michael Ball.",1215734400,,1043,4.55614973262032

I appreciated the variety of works, and that is what you would expect from someone who produced Broadway musicals. Some of the music was not the type that I would choose on its own, but I knew that ahead of time from other reviews. Even though it might not have been something I would choose I appreciated everyone's effort. Some performers are past their prime and I can't expect as much from them as when they were younger. Possibly other choices of performers could have been made, but maybe that was not possible on that night at that location. I enjoyed the performance and will enjoy listening to it many times. Some performers were better than others, but that is always the case with entertainers. Some you will like and others you will not. Try to choose those that you do like. I found the performance pleasant and relaxing and isn't that what entertainment is all about?",1201392000,,1058,4.544502617801047

The songs on this DVD, are the most popular songs from most of his musicals.  The cast of singers is fantastic.  There is music from Phantom, Super Star, Evita, Joseph, the list goes on and on, most of the songs became hits on their own seperate from the musicals.  In a lot of cases the original singer of the popular songs performed the songs on this DVD.  Webber did not produce the DVD.  He was merely a guest, and of course the singers wished him a happy birthday.  If you love Webbers musicals you will love this album.

961570,5,6305074143,"Truly an amazing video filled with some of the most familiar and powerful Andrew Lloyd Webber songs.  I was blown away from the start with Tina Arena's version of ""Whistle Down the Wind,"" although can certainly agree with some of the other comments about her being a little too angry for that song.  But, she is an incredible singer and an extremely classic entertainer.  Donny Osmond's performance was perfect and I think the children singing backup were fantastic.  I think this DVD should be called, ""The diversity of Michael Ball.""  He was the brightest star in this entire ensemble and every song he sang was powerful and moving.  His version of Gethsemane gave me chills, even though I think that it should be more true to the original rock version.  It's amazing how he could hold his notes and sing the rest of the night.  His version of ""Vaults of Heaven"" is outstanding!  He really seemed to get into character and have fun with that song.  Again, his voice was steady and powerful.  I was able to see Ball in concert and he has been my favorite performer since.

I have already watched this DVD 3 times and it never gets dull for me.  My only complaint about the DVD is that I really wish they would have not included Boyztown in the performances.  They sounded OK, but in my opinion ruined the song, ""No Matter What"" with their boy band sound.  The original London Cast version is 100 times better and actually has more meaning.  I usually just pass over that one but the rest of the DVD is just amazing.  This is the best DVD that I have seen in a while!",1187654400,,1567,4.461267605633803

The scene (songs) of ""Sunset Boulevard"", by Glenn Close, would be enough to give 5 stars to the product. But then you add Elaine Paige (she was the first Evita I saw on stage, London/March 1979), and her performances of ""Don't Cry for Me, Argentina"" and ""Memory"", and you feel rewarded enough. But the parade goes on: Lottie Mayor, Michael Ball, Donny Osmond, Tina Arena, Boyzone, Bonnie Tyler, Marcus Lovett, even Antonio Banderas (not exactly my choice as the Phantom but still acceptable)... A big plus is Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, and a tragic moment is Sarah Brightman trying to pass for a soprano. But not even the boring Julian Lloyd Webber justifies rating the Concert less than a 5 star spectacle. The DVD offers you the possibility of skipping such slippage...

961642,5,6305074143,"Overall this is certainly worth adding to your DVD collection if you love ALW's music as I do, especially,  ""Phantom"" and ""Evita"".  However, Antonio Bandaras, needs some voice lessons before he tries singing this music again.  Very disappointing, no matter how cute he is.  As Che he can get by, barely. I hate to see a performer struggle to sing the material and he was in big trouble vocally.  I didn't like the rock numbers  and the Whistle Down the Wind music never thrilled.  I found the performances of Michael Ball, Elaine Paige and Donny Osmond to be the best in this concert.  I love Kiri and have a huge number of her recordings, but this song wasn't worthy of her talent.  I've never been able to stand Brightman as she is far too mannered with inferior vocal technique,so the Phantom music was a disappointment except for the duet, All I Ask of You, with Ball.  Ball can sing ""Music of the Night"" better than Brightman.  Right! where was Michael Crawford?!  Seems he has disappeared from ALW's doings.  Too bad but Michael Ball is better in almost any song than Crawford.  Colm Wilkinson does a credible Phantom on another concert called ""Hey, Mr. Producer"" from 1998 and now only available on VHS.  Too bad that the movie of Phantom was such as disaster.  I'd really like to see a full length video of the stage production with great voices.  The production of ""Cats"" for video was terrific!  If you like all these shows this is a great addition to your collection! There is so little available on video of great Broadway shows that you can't afford to pass this DVD up.  Ball is the star though!  Very passionate performance and good vocal technique. He nails everything!  Osmond was surprisingly good as well.

Also, the Phantom of the Opera, which is my favorite, was a little weird with Antonio Bandares. It was still wonderful, but...different.

Micheal Ball was Amazing as usual, as well as Sarah Birghtman, Elaine Page, and Of course Bonnie Tyler.

961718,5,6305074143,"""Andrew Lloyd Webber: The Royal Albert Hall Celebration"" was put together to honor the composer's 50th birthday and the only down side to watching this concert today is that it now seems like they were celebrating the end of his career.  The title song from ""Whistle Down the Wind"" is actually done twice, at the beginning of the evening by Tina Arena and at the end with Lloyd Webber playing the piano for Lottie Mayor.  But that show never made it to Broadway and neither did ""The Beautiful Game.""  ""The Woman in White"" recently closed after a very short run in New York, so that it seems like the only success Lloyd Webber has had since he turned 50 were getting an Oscar nomination for ""Learn To Be Lonely,"" the new song he wrote for the film version of ""The Phantom of the Opera.""  But that did not win the way """"You Must Love Me"" did for ""Evita.""

But if the present is not all it should be, that certainly does not take away from the glories of the past.  You can quibble about the selections and the performers (you want Michael Crawford, I want Bernadette Petters, but would settle for the banishment of  Boyzone), but overall this is an impressive collection for this sort of concert.  I thought the standout performances were Michael Ball, on ""Gethsemane"" and when he leads everyone in ""Love Changes Everything,"" Glen Close, who shows up as Norma Desmond to do ""With One Look"" and ""As If We Never Said Goodbye,"" and Elaine Paige, who is okay on ""Don't Cry for Me Argentina"" but then gives everybody chills when she belts out ""Memory.""

I liked how director David Mallet and producer Andy Picheta  get beyond solos and duets to come up with larger ensemble pieces for the chorus, so they surround Donny Osmond with a children's choir for ""Any Dream Will Do"" (remember, ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"" was originally a children's cantata), and use the funeral opening of ""Evita"" to set up Antonio Banderas' ""Oh What a Circus.""  I also like the way they used the theme music of ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" to set up the selections from ""Requiem,"" which always makes me thing that there are not that many soprano duets involving a woman and a boy that I know about besides ""Pie Jesu"" (""Come To My Garden/Lift Me Up"" from ""The Secret Garden"" comes to mind).  Fans of the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber should end up either absolutely loving this concert or at least liking it a whole lot.  I wonder what sort of cake they served.",1146182400,5,2445,4.567505720823799

I only bought it because I heard that it contained my favorite singer of all time Michael Ball! But after listening to it I can now understand and appreciate the true genius of Webber.

The singers were all singers who gained fame from Webber's masterpieces-all except Glen Close. Donny Osmond opens the show with his ""Any Dream Will Do"" with the help of the London's Children Choir. Followed by such wonderful and impressive hits as ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina."", ""Hosana"", and ""The Music Of The Night."" I was so excited to see Michael Ball perform he performed the most moving piece of ""Gestheme"" in this DVD. I only wish that there was a CD from the night. I also loved his performance singing the song that launched him to super-stardom ""Love Changes Everything"" which was the highlight of the night- sung along side the entire cast... Michael Ball seemed to really be enjoying himself(Lately he said he has been getting annoyed with the song since he has to sing it so much). A little dissappointed in ""All I Ask Of You"" which has always been my favorite Webber song- for some reason I didn't feel it this time. I loved Boyzone's performance of ""No Matter What""- THOSE BOYS CAN REALLY SING!

But my favorite part of the evening was seeing Andrew Webber come on stage, while the cast sang a surprise ""Happy Birthday"" song. At the end of the evening Webber got on the piano and began playing ""Whistle Down The Wind."" All in all it was a beautiful evening and wonderful music. You can tell that the stars put enormous event into this special birthday event for Andrew Llyod Webber.

I was a little disappointed that there were not really any special features... it would be nice if it had a biography on Webber's life and career. My biggest regret is this was not made into a CD. However it's nice to own a DVD you can watch again and again. Broadway and Michael Ball fans must own this DVD in your collection!",1120003200,4,2063,4.4668435013262595

This is the BEST ALW DVD I have ever purchased. It has a little something from nearly every single one of his shows with many people that were in the original cast (Sarah Brightman, Michael Ball) of the shows.

I especially loved ""Love Changes Everything"" since I love Michael Ball! The cast came out as he sang and they joined in; it was such a wonderful moment! Everyone stayed on stage until the end of the show after that song.

If you're an ALW fan, BUY THIS!!! You will not be sorry!",1117238400,5,1991,4.441666666666666
961780,2,6305074143,"After watching/listening to Antonio Banderas struggle through his Phantom of the Opera I can only say how grateful I am that Joel Schumacher chose Gerard Butler to be our Phantom instead of Banderas who vigorously campaigned for the film role. Zorro can't sing. Not at all. And his aging cherub's face is not sexy and it is not menacing. I'm glad he took his mask, his cape and his sword to another movie set. Butler was extraordinary, evidenced by the fact that the film soundtrack went platinum!

Butler's Phantom was everything I hoped it would be. Incredibly sexy,cunning,murderous,childlike,sympathetic, and quite mad.",1114992000,4,623,5.1683168316831685
961781,4,6305074143,"When in March 1998 Andrew Lloyd Webber turned 50, a full two-hour celebration gala concert was given in his honour at London's Royal Albert Hall. He certainly deserved it, since by that time he was rightly thought of as the most successful musical composer of all times. As it is wide known, he wrote numerous hit shows, including the two longest running musicals in the history of the West End and Broadway, i.e. ""Cats"" and ""The Phantom of the Opera"". So the numerous artists who performed his shows and singles were called together and they delivered this stunning concert accompanied by a wonderful symphonic orchestra. Every show up to that date, except ""By Jeeves"", ""The Beautiful Game"" and his latest, ""The woman in white"", was covered, the former from 2000 and the latter premiered in September 2004. I'll give you my brief impressions of the songs performed here.

1. ""Whistle down the wind"" performed by Tina Arena: This is the single version released before the show was put to stage. It's a beautiful pop song with the nice guitar and drums use. Tina has the right voice, but her stage presence here is too aggressive.

2. ""Any dream will do"" and ""Close every door"" from ""The Joseph and his amazing Technicolor dreamcoat"" performed by Donny Osmond: These two songs from Webber's first musical Osmond sings with a group of young kids as the backs vocals that blends perfectly with his strong voice.

3. ""Variations"" is the piece for the cello and the orchestra that Webber based on the work of the Italian violin virtuoso Paganini and wrote for his cellist brother Julian Lloyd Webber, who plays the cello here. He gives a spotless rendition of the two numbers, with professional dancers dancing in front of him.

4.  ""Evita"" follows. The choir of youngsters appropriately dressed performs ""The requiem for Evita"". Then comes Antonio Banderas dressed as Che and sings his two numbers: ""Oh, what a circus"" and ""High flying, adored"" very well, as he did in the movie. ""Don't cry for me Argentina"", one of the best songs Webber has ever written, is nicely sung here by Elaine Paige, who had the honour to be the first who in 1978 brought Evita to life in the West End. She wears a beautiful white gown and the fitting jewellery, similar to the one she had on stage when she was in the show.

5.  ""Starlight Express"", the Webber's show about trains, is represented here by one ensemble song called ""Light at the end of the tunnel"". It is performed by one of the Original Cast members from 1984, Ray Shell, who is, with the rest of the singers here, on roller-skates, as the actors in the show are. It's a flashy piece, better to watch than to listen.

6. ""Jesus Christ Superstar"", Webber's first big success, is next. We have a short reference to the number ""Hosanna"" and the two solos. Michael Ball, the star of ""Les Mis"" and Webber's ""Aspects of love"", sings ""Gethsemane"" in the right tone and with the needed passion; a touch of sadness is present here. Marcus Lovett, who starred in ""Whistle down the wind"" that year, with the help of the soul girls, gives a rocky rendition of ""Superstar""; very neat. Some will probably enjoy his costume: a tight jeans and shirtless T-shirt, showing his muscles. :-)

7. ""Requiem"", for which Webber won a special award, comes next in line. He wrote it in 1985 to commemorate the death of his father. The opera singer Dennis O'Neill sings ""Hosanna"" with his perfect tenor. Then, for the first time that evening, appears Sarah Brightman, who was Webber's second wife. She looks beautiful and reminds me here of a porcelain doll. She sings the most famous song from ""Requiem"", called ""Pie Jesu"", together with Ben De'atah, a small choir boy. It is the most solemn rendition of the evening.

8. ""The Phantom of the Opera"", the most produced of all Webber's shows, starts next, with a strong Overture. Sarah Brightman comes out, with a beautiful smile on her face. She sings in all of the three numbers here, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" being the first. My main complaint here is that Antonio Banderas joins her as the Phantom, which is very inappropriate.  He is good as Che in ""Evita"", but the Phantom needs a totally different voice. Where was Michael Crawford that evening? Antonio's voice is trembling in this number and you can tell he's really struggling. Michael Ball joins Sarah in a beautiful rendition of the love ballad ""All I ask of you"" and they share a nice kiss in the end, just like in the show. Sarah wraps up the Phantom part with ""The music of the night"", originally sung by the Phantom, but here, they rightly didn't want to risk it with Banderas.

9. Two pop singles from ""Whistle down the wind"" come after that. Bonnie Tyler sings a stunning big number, ""Tyre tracks and broken hearts"", together with the very well choreographed dancers and the black girls as the back vocals. This whole number looks and sounds great. ""No matter what"" was an instant hit and is given here by Boyzone, then still existing as a boy band. Very well sung. But they saved the best for last of this part: Michael Ball comes out then and gives an amazing rendition of ""The vaults of heaven"", backed by the soul choir. This remains one of my favourites here; the sound of this is beyond description, as the applause proves it.

10. ""Sunset Boulevard"" part is next. ""Sunset"" remains for me one of Webber's best scores; lush and beautiful. I listen to the original cast recording with Patti LuPone all the time. However, here the songs are performed by Glenn Close. A big mistake. If you've ever listened the American premiere recording with her, you'll know what I am talking about. Yes, her stage presence is strong, as the applause of the audience shows, but her vocal abilities are too limited, and her aggressive approach to the role lacks any subtlety. I can only imagine how it would sound if Patti LuPone was there, or anybody else who sang it properly, like Betty Buckley or Petula Clark. This is one of the main reasons I'm giving this concert 4 stars. In this way, the three songs here, ""Once upon a time"", ""With one look"" and ""As if we never said goodbye"" only give a hint of what they may look like with the right singer. The funny thing is; this was the first time I heard these songs, and thought Glenn Close is OK, until I heard Patti LuPone. So do yourself a favour and get the London cast recording of ""Sunset Blvd"" to hear it how it should sound.

11. ""Aspect of love"" is represented by its hit song, ""Love changes everything"", Michael Ball's number one hit and standard. All the artists come out to the stage and join him in this song; very lovely.

12. Elaine Paige then makes her second appearance to sing ""Memory"", probably the most famous song of Webber, dressed in a nice feline gown. Her voice is lovely and gentle, though not as strong as on ""Cats"" DVD, from which it was put to her latest two-disc compilation, ""Centre stage: The very best of Elaine Paige"", issued in May 2004.

The master himself, Andrew Lloyd Webber, comes to the stage after that, to give a brief thanking speech. He also introduces the next artist, dame Kiri Te Kanawa.

13. Dame Kiri performs a song called ""A heart is slow to learn"", which belongs among the finest Lloyd Webber's ballads. It was initially intended to use it in a sequel of The Phantom of the opera"", but in the year 2000, Webber used this melody with the changed lyrics for his musical ""The beautiful game"". Dame Kiri's soprano fits the melody perfectly.

14. Another rendition of ""Whistle down the wind"" follows, this time Webber is playing the piano and the young Lottie Mayor, who played the lead in the show that year, is singing. Her rendition is very opposite to Tina Arena's from the beginning: I like the touch of gentleness that Lottie brings to this song.

15. During the end credits, the orchestra plays ""The jellicle ball"" from ""Cats"".

I hope I gave you an interesting description of the whole show. Anyone who, like me, loves Andrew Lloyd Webber's music and musicals is in for a sheer delight. My only regret is that Michael Crawford and good singer for Sunset Blvd part weren't there. Other than that, this concert is a must have for all the Webber fans and those who enjoy quality musical theatre.",1104969600,237,8217,4.622770919067215
961782,4,6305074143,"This is a very nice collection of Andrew Lloyd Weber's musical pieces.  I've seen it many times, but the experience of listening to and watching these excellent singers never gets old.  My highlights are Bonnie Tyler, Boyzone, and, well, almost all of them!  However, one act that I did not enjoy was Antonio Banderas' performance.  His voice sounds strained and raspy, and compared with the clear, beautiful sounds created by his predecessors, he is not even in the same league.  There's a good reason he didn't sing Music of the Night!

On the other hand, Elaine Paige's performance was magnificent.  Her costumes were appropriate to the time period of the musical, and her acting ability was superb.  Boyzone and Bonnie Tyler were only some of the other good acts in this recording.  I do not hesitate to recommend this to anyone.  Just keep in mind that some of the acts are more appealing to some people than others.",1099440000,4,921,4.772151898734177
961783,3,6305074143,"Of course, most of what I want to say the 221 other reveiwers have beat me to.  I'm going to be different, however, and say that Michael Ball's ""Vaults of Heaven"" was NOT the most memorable performance.  I prefered his rendition of Gethsemane (I only want to say).  Antonio Banderas did an excelent job with the songs from Evita, though if you want to be knit-picky Evita's dress was distracting.  I also have a personal disgust for Sarah Brightman, she can't sing and she looks weird when she tries, but I'm in the minority there and I apologise if I offend anyone.  If you like Andrew Loyd Webber's music you'll love this DVD, as it has practically everything he's written on it sung by many good performers.",1097539200,7,710,4.559055118110236
961784,2,6305074143,"I consider Lloyd Webber the British heir to Richard Rodgers, and this is what Sondheim would have done if he could have.  (In fact Lloyd Webber at 50 even looks like Rodgers.)  But I shut the thing off when a church choir-type started singing ""The keys to the vault of heaven.""  Was this thing a retrospective of the composer or a religious revival?  It was absolutely sodden with Christianity, nauseously so.  Like almost every last song!  I hung in there for over an hour and a half because there were some things I very much wanted to see and hear (as a rule, I love Lloyd Webber's music very much, sans the rock), but at this point I'd had enough.  Sarah Brightman was absolutely beautiful and natural, what a charming open smile and such a wonderful voice.  I loved what she did, and applauded all by myself in my living room at the end of her duet ""All I Ask of You,"" though I dislike that show very much.  I thought the fellow who sang Che (right name, spelling?) near the start was worlds better than Mandy Patinkin (whom I'd always loved before he went on to bigger and more pretentious things), also he had the right accent and was prettier.  In fact, he was beautiful, as were several of the young men.  I learned from reading some of the other reviews that this was an international cast (all unknown to me, ignorant, insular, xenophobic American that I am), all quite famous, and that Lloyd Webber is loved the world over.  I can well understand why he is so much loved.  However (I have CDs of all his shows that I know of, he may have written more since I stopped buying musicals), it seems to me that his wonderful talent (genius?) diminished as he grew older, his inspiration, gift for melody deserted him.  I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who likes rock music (I do not) and who doesn't mind feeling they're in a 21st Century church.  I'm sorry I had to stop it.",1085616000,5,1887,4.413294797687861

But, I have to hand it to TINA ARENA, I never heard of her, but came back on Amazon and purchased 4 of her CDs,I thought her rendition of the title song was just fabulous, what a voice, what emotions were generated from her voice. I played that segment over and over again......I was hoping that they made a CD of the whole show. All the performers were just GREAT!! I loved watching Glenn Close get into character for her TONY AWARD performance of Ms. Desmond, I was standing up in my living room giving her an ovation too, she was just wonderful to see again. I was surprised of the musical talents of Antonio Banderas too.

She gave a powerhouse performance all looking sultry and sexy in a gray figure hugging lacy gown. She gave a strong performance and the crowd was obviously delighted with her interpretation! The vocals and the emotion are so evident. Encore for Tina Arena!!! Other internationals include Boyzone, Michael Ball, and Bonnie Tyler and gave justifying performances as well.

But in the search I stumbled across this live performance of Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""greatest hits"" which seemed to be getting fabulous reviews by Amazonians, so I just recently purchased it, and what a blast this DVD is--well worth the reasonable price.
Last night I played the almost 2 hour DVD through twice. I'm sure I'll watch it again tonight.

I have to agree with a number of the reviewers...he steals the show, not only with Gethsemane, but with the strength of his personality and vocal ability in each of his other three performances.

Sarah Brightman(she can still hit high A's!) was great, but I thought she was going way too slow for ""Phantom"". Also some minor rhythm glitches with the Phantom overture. Speaking of which, it was cool with that guy in the Phantom costume really playing the organ.
The kids in ""Every Dream Will Do"" and ""Close Every Door"" were really cute. Did you see that one kid let go of the balloon? :)
""Don't Cry For Me Argentina"" is one of the best songs. The thing that is weird though, is that ""Oh What A Circus"" has the same melody.
I loved both of the ""Whistle Down The Wind""s, but especially the one where Lloyd Webber provided the accompaniment with the piano.

961967,4,6305074143,"I had seen bits and pieces of this on PBS several years ago, and purchased the video recently on the advice of a friend.  I've long enjoyed Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, and enjoyed just about every performance in this show.  Some of the highlights for me were:
Michael Ball -- Unknown to me before seeing him in the West End in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, (somehow I missed his parts of the show when I saw it on PBS), he was one of the main reasons I purchased this video.  The four songs he sang here were absolutely marvelous;  Gethsemane -- very powerful and full of emotion.  Vaults of Heaven-- wonderful as was his duet with Sarah Brightman, All I ask of You.  And Love Changes Everything -- quite simply, magnificant, made even more so with the full cast joining in.
Glenn Close was magnificent singing her songs from Sunset Boulevard.
Antonio Banderas surprised me -- he was very good with the songs from Evita, but not so good with the title song from Phantom of the Opera -- there were minor problems with his phrasing, and, in certain parts of the song, he sounded as though he were singing out of his range.
Donny Osmond -- loved his renditions of Any Dream will Do and Close Every Door.
Sarah Brightman -- for the most part her performances were lovely.  However, I was disappointed with her performance of Pie Jesu.  Rounding her mouth as she did through most of the song rendered the words almost unintelligible, and spoiled the beauty of the song for me.  I have seen her do this song without rounding her mouth and the words were much clearer and the sound just as good.  Ben De'ath, the boy soprano who sang with her on this performance was much clearer in his enunciation.
All in all the concert was spectacular.  If you enjoy ALW's music, I recommend this.",1041465600,12,1773,4.492211838006231

Tina Arena is one of those performers who owns a song when she sings it. She tears up ""Whistle Down The Wind."" Her performance is incredible. I can't wait to hear more from her. I would love to hear her sing more Broadway-- I wonder how she would sound on ""On My Own"" from Les Mis?
I love Michael Ball in Les Miserables, but here I didn't really care for the songs he sang, except ""All I Ask of You."" That was great. But he seemd to strut onto the stage with a kind of ""Yeah, it's me. Aren't I wonderful"" look on his face.
I thought Antonio Banderas made a wonderful Che in the movie and here as well as in the Phantom performance with Sarah Brightman. His accent added something to the song. Glen Close was, for lack of another word, incredible. I wish I could have seen her on stage in Sunset Boulevard. The final performance of Whistle Down the Wind was awful. I don't know why they included that-- it couldn't even come close to Tina Arena's performance at the beginning. Every other performance is first class.

961973,5,6305074143,"The opening song WHISTLE DOWN THE WIND is sung by Tina Arena. The music and the way Tina performs the song is very powerful. She has a great voice but she sings it too aggressively, I better like the way Lottie Mayor sings it, at the end of the concert.
Donny Osmond sings ANY DREAM WILL DO and CLOSE EVERY DOOR together with a children choir. Donny has a great charisma and voice. It sounds fantastic with the children. Julian Lloyd Webber plays cello - the music from VARIATIONS (a symphonic concert from 1977).
Antonio Banderas: HIGH FLYING ADORED. Elaine Paige: DON'T CRY FOR ME ARGENTINA. She sings it as beautiful as 20 years ago, when she had the leading role as Evita.
Dennis O'Neill sings in Latin the song HOSANNA from Requiem. There is a girl in the choir, she looks like Charlotte Church? Sarah Brightman appears like a magic woman, and the dancers fall to the floor. Sarah sings in Latin and the young boy Ben De'ath comes to the stage. They sing PIE JESU together - a very beautiful and moving church mess song. Sarah's voice is incredible beautiful.
Michael Ball: I ONLY WANT TO SAY (GESTHEMANE) from Jesus Christ Superstar. A very vigorous song.
At THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, when Sarah Brightman enters the stage I get chills because of her beauty and presence. She is the most wonderful person, with a warm-heartedness charisma. She definitely has the best and most beautiful voice in the world. She and Antonio Banderas sing THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA together. It's 10 years ago, when Sarah played Christine in the Phantom.
Michael Ball and Sarah sing the beautiful duet ALL I ASK OF YOU. They suit each other well. Michael Ball has a great charisma. THE MUSIC OF THE NIGHT, Sarah sings it as beautiful as ever.
Boyzone: NO MATTER WHAT - the best sound on this DVD.
Michael Ball: VAULTS OF HEAVEN together with a gospel choir - it sounds fantastic.
Glenn Close plays Norma Desmond from Sunset Boulevard and sings WITH ONE LOOK.
Michael Ball sings the great song LOVE CHANGES EVERYTHING and all the artists from the concert appear, singing together. Elaine Paige sings MEMORY from Cats.
Kiri Te Kanawa sings the very beautiful song THE HEART IS SLOW TO LEARN. Kiri has a beautiful soprano voice. It could be great to hear Kiri and Sarah together in a duet. All the artists sing HAPPY BIRTHDAY for Andrew. At the final song, Andrew plays the piano while Lottie Mayor sings the beautiful song WHISTLE DOWN THE WIND.
Andrew Lloyd Webber must be the greatest composer of all time.
This DVD is fantastic, whether your are a fan of Andrew, Sarah Brightman, Michael Ball, Elaine Paige or you just love great musical music. The picture and the sound are excellent on this DVD.",1027123200,45,2684,4.628930817610063
961974,5,6305074143,"Andrew Lloyd Webber - The Royal Albert Hall Celebration; what a DVD !!  I can't begin to say enough about it.  If I had to say only one thing about this DVD, it would be that this is one intense, emotional, and passionate performance.  Every performer performs with great passion and intensity.  Most performances start out easy, but build to an intense ending.  From Elaine Paige to Bonnie Tyler to Michael Ball to Antonio Banderas to Sarah Brightman, this DVD is a ""must have"".  The orchestra is flawless, just as every performance is.  I never tire of watching it.  I take it and my laptop on trips, and even to work - of course I only ""listen"" to it at work (yeah!).  You will not be disappointed.  Since watching this, I have purchased other Webber musicals - Cats, Evita, Jesus Christ Superstar, and enjoy them immensely.  Sarah Brightman DVD concerts (Eden and LaLuna) also grace my DVD collection.  Antonio Banderas does an outstanding job with Evita, and also with Sarah Brightman in Phantom Of The Opera.  Antonio's eyes burn with intensity, as does Sarah's.  Elaine Paige sings ""Don't Cry For Me, Argentina"" with such clarity, that you almost wait for her to slip up, but she does not - it is flawless.  I never heard of Michael Ball before this concert, but I now have 3 of his CDs.  Many of my friends have purchaced this DVD after watching it.  I could go on and on, but I think you get the picture.  Oh, one more thing - watch out for goose-bumps.  I didn't know they came with the purchase price, but I sure get them when watching this.  Buy it and enjoy it.",1025049600,4,1574,4.475352112676056

That caught my interest the first time - but the program continued to (really) thrill me.  After I saw/heard Boyzone sing No Matter What, I scoured the stores for their CD's. Bonnie Tyler rocked the house!  Where's she been?  Anyone who loves Musical theater should have this.  Absolutely something for everyone.  Watch it on the big screen TV, surround-sound, volume up.

It was my first exposure to BoyZone and the song No Matter What is my absolute favorite of the DVD.  I also love both versions of Whistle Down the Wind.  Donny Osmond did a tremendous job with Any Dream Will Do and Close Every Door....I could go on and on I just loved it.  The only song I don't particularly care for is the song from Starlight Express.  If you like Andrew Lloyd Webber's music believe me you won't be disappointed.,1015113600,,544,4.1826923076923075
962048,5,6305074143,"I bought the VHS of this concert a long time ago and fell in love with it instantly. Now the DVD is released and I can finally say goodbye to all the frustrations of rewinding or forwarding, and enjoy the show to the full pleasure.

Fascinating music, dazzling stars, it truly is a gala night. Andrew Lloyd Webber definitely is the master of melody. You don't have to be a music connoisseur to understand his music; you don't have to be a musical fanatic to appreciate this concert. There are so many songs and music pieces in his musicals that can be singled out and performed in a concert without losing their original glamour. I am sure the concert could go on and on if time permitted. This two-hour concert has included his most popular musical pieces, if not all of his best ones.
Among all the male stars, Michael Ball rules. He looks gorgeous and sounds great. Each of his appearing on the stage gives the show a rocket boost. No one could deliver a more powerful ""Gethsemane"" than him. Among all the female singers Sarah Brightman is in the limelight, but vocal-wise, Eilain Paige and Kiri Te Kanawa lead, especially the latter. What's great about Kiri Te Kanawa is that she sounds so natural while singing operatically. Although she just sang one song, no one can match her power and solid skill. One big disappointment is the Phantom song. The fact is Antonio Banderas can't sing phantom. He is not bad in ""Oh, What a Circus"", but his voice is too weak for phantom. I'd certainly like to see Michael Ball singing the phantom (especially after listening to his rendition with Lesley Garrett in his recent album ""Center Stage""), or anyone else with a strong and sexy voice.
I could continue on and on with the songs and the singers, but I don't want to spoil the fun for those who haven't seen the performance. Seeing is believing. Seeing it yourself, you'll treasure it for the rest of your life!",1014940800,,1906,4.573099415204679

I had the vhs and as soon as the dvd came out I was right there to get it!  My only regret is that it is not available to CD.  Why is that?  It is such a a tremendous, beautiful production.

To hear and see Donny Osmond and Antonio Banderas was another treat! Michael Ball really put gusto into the songs'Vaults of Heaven'and 'Gethsemane'. But when Glenn Close appeared, her presence filled the entire Albert Hall and apart from Andrew LLyod Webber the night belongs to her!",1010448000,2,458,4.961038961038961

Try to just watch 10 minutes -- it's impossible.  Each song is better than the last.  Brightman is brilliant, Michael Ball is fantastic, BoyZone will touch your heart, and Glenn Close delivers an absoloutely superhuman performance that will bring you to tears because she can sing (who knew?) AND act.  I've had this on VHS for years, but now that it's on DVD (thank you!) it's fabulous.  It is a MUST HAVE.

962053,3,6305074143,"I truly expected a whole lot more than what this show actually put up. Tina Arena, Kiri, and a slew of others were terrific -- alright, including Antonio Bendejo! Donny Osmond, on the contrary, puts this entire show to shame -- he really shouldn't go beyond ""I'm a little bit country and a little bit of rock and roll."" That is a voice that should be captured on cassette only, because a CD or, moreso, a DVD is just too much technology and class for half-baked prettyish boys like this -- if even that! Check out Hey, Mr. Producer instead. Now, that's a marvelous production by leaps and bounds. If you have been unfortunate enough to have recently watched ""By Jeeves"" on Broadway, this is exactly the same disappointment that you'll be experiencing, and at least for me, Sir Andrew was right down my row in that production -- the only treat to a very sour experience.",1007596800,2,869,4.54140127388535

I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED. My advice? don't buy---wait until they come out with a ""second edition"" because this is an embarasement to andrew lloyd webber. <and yes if someone i didn't know would have told me this i wouldnt have believed them either...so i bought it too > i hear the VHS version is also poorly recorded....",1006819200,,560,4.61

There's also a special performance from Julian Lloyd Webber ( I think that's his name) and of course Sarah Brightman steals the show as usual. My most favorite performance is given by Michael Ball singing ""Vaults of Heaven"" with the choir. I could just rewind and play that back ALL DAY LONG.. If you love Andrew Lloyd Webber, you'll love this video celebrating his 60th birthday at the Royal Albert Hall.

Donny Osmond and his chorus of kids, though they had little time on stage, started the show magnificently. Michel Ball, who I later realized, after thinking over and over that I had heard him before, was Marius in the Les Mis dreamcast in the tenth anniversary concert, was a great inspiration to young singers in his many contributions during the show. The only thing I found wrong with it was Antonio Bandaras' attempt at the Phantom. The guy's got a nice voice, but he's no Phantom. It really could have used Micheal Crawford at that point, but the rest of it was just perfect.

Michael Ball delivered the most spectacular performance I have ever seen during this moving song. Incredible! I only wish that all of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's videos could be so wonderful. The ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" segment of the show was splendid and performed very well by various artists. Also, Donny Osmond's voice is so pure and youthful and has wonderful tone quality. He dazzles the audience while singing happily to the children's choir and later giving 120% in the emotional ""Close Every Door."" Donny Osmond is such a fantastic performer that *he* never steps out on stage. Instead, from the moment he comes out from the darkness, the audience sees *Joseph*, not Donny.

Sarah Brightman is brilliant as usual,  but especially in the beautiful ""Pie Jesu.""  Lottie Mayer's  rendition of ""Whistle Down the Wind"" is inspirational, especially  with Webber accompanying her on the piano.  He is visibly moved.  Michael  Ball with his signature song of ""Love Changes Everything"" and  joined in by the entire cast is worth the price of the tape alone!  There  are two disappointments.  Antonio Banderas was good in songs from  ""Evita"" but he does not have the voice necessary to to perform  the Phantom, both in range and power.  The beautiful ""The Heart Never  Learns"" written by Webber for Dame Kiri Te Kanawa has its weak  moments, especially at the end.  Te Kanawa has been criticized before for a  thin voice in the upper octaves, and this is true in this song as well.

This  guy sings with all his heart and soul. Such devotion. And you can tell the  difference it makes. I have seen Michael Crawford sang the same song in a  concert on PBS, no I am sorry his performance could not compete with  Michael Ball's. Somehow Mr. Crawford treated the song indifferently.

962257,5,6305074143,"Andrew Lloyd Webber has written some of the most beautiful music of the last 30 years.  This amazing video captures the highlights of his brilliant career and brings them to a new level.  The variety of music and performers  worked wonderfully.  Sarah Brightman, Antonio Banderas, Glenn Close, Donny  Osmond, Elaine Page and all the artists are great, but Michael Ball took  the cake!  WOW!  His performance of ""Gethsemane"" will leave you  breathless.  ""Vaults of Heaven"" (on which Michael was joined by  The London Community Gospel Choir) will leave you swaying and clapping!  Michael's gorgeous voice complemented Sarah B.'s on their duet ""All I  Ask Of You.""  He is THE HIGHLIGHT of this video.  Other noteworthy  performances include Donny Osmond's ""Joseph..."" segment,  ""Memory"" sung by the one and only Elaine Page and Glenn Close's  ""With One Look"" is amazing.  And all things considered, I must  give Antonio Banderas some credit.  Sure, he doesn't have the best voice,  but his ""Phamton"" (hehe) is likable.  I had never heard of Tina  Arena, but her performance of ""Whistle Down The Wind"" is  wonderful.  This is a great video, filled with the best ALW has to offer.  He does write beautiful music, but he sure knows how to pick the right  singers to show it off!  This is worth every penny and even more.  You will  be pushing the ""Rewind"" button more than once!",957139200,61,1372,4.860262008733624

962333,4,6305074143,"I need not say much about Andrew Lloyd Webber - his talent at composing great music is well known to everyone. In this video, you will hear some of his greates melodies. However, there are a few flaws in the concert -  mostly involving the Phantom segment. I will outline them here. Most are  pretty minor but keep them in mind when deciding on whether to purchase  this video. Remember, there is a lot of other great Broadway and Andrew  Lloyd Webber stuff out there.
1. The Phantom of the Opera overture - It  was a bold decision to use a real organ instead of a synthesizer to perform  the overture. It was also a bad one - the organism lost track of the tempo  and went out of sync with the orchestra.
2. The Phantom of the Opera  title theme - First thing - why isn't Michael Crawford singing it? Antonio  Banderas did on OK job with it, but he is by far NOT the best to sing the  title theme with Sara Brightman. Furthermore, his rough voice and heavy  Spanish accent do not allow the song ot have that magical flow that other  renditions have. He acts it out nicely, though.
3. Music of the Night -  Again, Where is Crawford? Music of the night is HIS song. Many sang it, but  no one did it the way he did. Why not Crawford? Why a woman? Music of the  Night (unlike the rest of Phantom) was not written for a soprano!
4.  Memory - The rendition was not bad for an ordinary singer. But considering  the fact that Elaine Paige was singing the song, it could have been  delivered a lot better. She must have had a problem with her voice or  something.
Now for some good qualities of the video.
Sunset Boulevard  segment - A wonderful performance by Glenn Close - she is a great singer  and a great actor, and she shows both those traits in this concert.
Evita  segment - Great performances by Antonio Banderas and Elaine Paige. Both are  perfect for their roles, dramatically and vocally.
Love Changes  everything - Great (as always) performance by Michael Ball.
Tire tracks  and Broken hearts - Bonnie Tyler is perfect for that song. Listen yourself  and you'll understand why.",956707200,3,2082,4.384816753926701

Antonio Banderas does the most beautiful ""High Flying Adored"" but his Phantom was lacking  power. This is the first time I got to hear Byzone and was quite impressed.  Michael Ball looked and sounded great and Tina Arena did as well.  The  biggest disappointment to me on this entire video was Sarah Brightman. I  used to love listening to her but in this video she holds her mouth in a  constant ""o"" no matter what sound she is singing and dips into  her notes way too much.. She totally destroyed Pie Jesu and the combination  of her and Antonio on Phantom of the Opera was enough to make me shake my  head in disbelief.  Everyone else, however was fabulous!

This was also my  introduction to my new favorite band--Boyzone!  I really hope these guys  make it big in America so I don't have such a hard time finding their  recordings anymore.

The performances of Elaine Paige, Marcus Lovett, Tina Arena, Ray  Schell, Donny Osmond and each of the choruses were stunning.
The REAL  reason I bought the video was to hear Michael Ball's interpretation of  ""Gethsemane,"" a wonderful work that, to my knowledge, Michael has  not recorded.  It is positively haunting.  I am so pleased with each of the  three Michael Ball solos on this video.
If I had to find one fault with  the video, it would be that the individual artists were not introduced nor  associated with their individual works on the video's cover.",935280000,,719,4.725806451612903

I can't say enough about Michael Ball -- his rendition of ""Gethsemane"" brought goosebumps and ""Love Changes Everything"" rocked the audience.  Antonio Banderas seemed a little out of his league as the Phantom but his eyes were sexy and mesmerizing and kept my interest.  Glenn Close was excellent as was Elaine Paige.  ""Whistle Down the Wind"" was so clear and crisp - a wonderful performance.  Boyzone's ""No Matter What"" is my new personal favorite.

Sarah Brightman and Michael Ball you'll be right.  I thought Julian Llyod Webber was fantastic (JAMMING ON A CELLO? WHOEVER  HEARD OF THAT?!!!!!) Elaine Page did well as did Boyzone....but my  favourite was KIRI TE KANAWA.

Sarah Brightman was magnificant  as always, and Lottie Mayer's version of Whistle Down the Wind was, to say  the least, beautiful.  I also enjoyed Boyzone.

He alone is reason enough to add this to  your collection. Donny Osmond is great. Elaine page as Evita is superb.  Michael Crawford was sorely missed.

However, I could not but buy this  video for my own since I didn't want to miss previous parts. Actually I  bought 3 copies, two of which were for my brother and sister who also love  this concert.
How I love this video! It shouldn't be better. I've already  enjoyed another Andrew's video ""Premere Collection"", but this one  is a lot better; exciting, absorbing and mersmerising. I do like all the 24  songs and tunes performed mostly with beautiful chorus, exciting dances and  harmonic accompaniment by the great orchestra. In particular, ""The  heart is slow to learn"" by Kiri Te Kanawa is too beautiful to express  with words. And it's good to see Donny Osmond and Bonnie Tyler again. I  never knew before Glenn Close and Antonio Banderas were such good singers.  And Michael Ball, Elain Paige..... Yes, it's a night of a thousand stars.  Only one thing this concert misses I think is the original Phantom: Michael  Crawford.
How funny it is that my nephew and nieces aged 8 to 10 got  crazy for  Boyzone with the song ""No matter what"". They are even  eager to learn  English and play the song with their instruments: piano and  violin. (Is there  anyone who can advise me how to get the score?) This  video really is my  family's favorite.
I'd like to urge  ""PolyGram"" to release this video to DVD very soon. And  thank you  Andrew for your marvelous works!!",918172800,6,1615,4.582456140350877
