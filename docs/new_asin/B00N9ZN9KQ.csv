6619141,3,B00N9ZN9KQ,"I thought the message was great, but not sure why the beginning information is important when discussing diet and health. I just thought the intro was too long and a bit hokey/amateur. Almost made me stop watching it. This has nothing to do with how I feel about Juan-Carlos' rise our of prison--I think it's awesome that he changed his life, just think it was to large a part of the movie. I htink his story could have been told in less time without lessening the impact.",1444176000,,472,4.436781609195402
6619142,1,B00N9ZN9KQ,"Really wanted to like this movie. I think the message is a great one, but this movie was shot and edited by a 2 year old. Multiple scenes are completely out of focus, with audio being so mismatched that you go from clearly hearing people to not hearing them at all even without any extra background noise and there are also quite a few scenes where clearly someone is just holding the camera during an interview because the video is nowhere near stable. On top of all of that many of the people being interviewed are talking like they're reading a script that the author prepared for them, not just having a conversation about their own thoughts. I would MAYBE give this movie a 3 star if it was shot in focus and had audio properly taken care of or even just a tri-pod.",1442448000,8,770,4.354166666666667
6619143,3,B00N9ZN9KQ,"This was a good film. Like all health films, there is a chance editing can veer watcher into all the goods things about the video. We didn't see any struggle with the main characters transformation, but she did make a significant change to her appearance. The main thing that bugged me, was that it seemed like a bigger commercial for the personal trainer's Zen Fitness gym, than anything. At the very end he pushes his product for beet juice, and his gym. Science has also shown that a whole foods diet {even with meat} can yield very similar affects. This film was based off the China study book which states that eating animal protein can cause cancer. If that's the case, carnivorous animals in the wild would be dropping like flies do to cancer rates. I just feel the film doesn't look at the whole picture or tell the whole story. Do your own research and find what works for you.",1441584000,7,886,4.509316770186335

6619146,3,B00N9ZN9KQ,"This movie was ok. While inspiring, it's hard to believe the subject suffered no setbacks, no valleys and went 100% cold stone vegan/plant based. They say she lost 200 pounds, which I guess is durable, but I have a difficult time believing it took only one year.

The freeze frames, slow motion and cheesy music is a bit over the top.",1440201600,2,334,4.475409836065574
6619147,5,B00N9ZN9KQ,Don't let the low budget appearance of this documentary distract you from the important message. The story is a great example of how a plant based diet and exercise can transform someone from obese to fit and healthy.,1439856000,5,217,4.7368421052631575

When I watched Unsupersize me, I tried the WFPB diet and exercise and it worked and worked quickly! It wasn't just my weight loss that excited me but how I handled stress and emotional moments better. My whole demeanor improved. Change your life and start by getting this!

6619158,1,B00N9ZN9KQ,"MAYBE there was some good information in this video, but it was so poorly produced that it was laughable. The ""dialogue"" was so stilted, it was obviously scripted, but that's forgivable. But the camera work and the ""titles"" for each chapter looked as if it was done by a high school student. WORST of all, when Tracy (the subject) had her pre-diet medical testing, the video never says: what her cholesterol was, how her blood sugar was, what was her body fat percentage (and they showed her holding the device that measures that, so they HAD the info). I couldn't even watch the whole thing -- forced myself through most of it.",1513814400,,628,4.616071428571429

All of these people got fat with the same brain that will make them fat again. Googling the participants it seems that regaining the fat has been universal. And sadly, one invited her employees to the ""premiere"" as if she were Jennifer Lawrence. I can't even snark on that it's so pitiful.",1490486400,,427,4.558441558441558

6619162,5,B00N9ZN9KQ,This is great little low budget documentary!!  VERY INSPIRING!  I think they did  an excellent job with a small/no budget.  DEFINITELY worth the watch!

The key to my weight loss was WFPB diet and exercise! That's it! I have never been successful on any other diet.. until now! Honestly, this movie changed my life.. for the better!

6619169,3,B00N9ZN9KQ,"I watched this movie on Hulu. I'm very happy the main subject in the film lost weight, and I'm really happy that Mr. Asse was able to turn his life around after being in prison. However, you can lose weight on just about any diet and feel good. Regular guys like me don't have luxury of being able to afford personal trainers, time to prepare food, or are under the microscope of a documentary film. I'm not arguing the dogmas on the dogma of the vegan diet, but these are just my thoughts.",1464307200,,490,4.279569892473118
6619170,2,B00N9ZN9KQ,"First off, the fact that this young lady lost the amount of weight that she did was definitely an achievement and it shouldn't be knocked. Good for her for making lifestyle choices and reaching her goals. I did find a recent pic of her and she did gain some of the weight back, but not much, which isn't all that surprising given the type of diet she was on and that when you have that much weight loss, you're bound to gain some back when habits start slipping here and there. No big deal though. Bravo to her!

HOWEVER, my main gripe was this self proclaimed personal trainer. I don't recall seeing any certifications going on, just a lot of reading information from not always legit sources (The China Study? Really?). While his general coaching, encouragement, and wanting to promote healthier lifstyles was a plus, just so many tidbits of misinformation, as well as some of the techniques he used in the small bits of exercise we actually saw in the film... gah. I have a degree in exercise science, but have chosen NOT to get into personal training because I would lose my mind. It's people like this guy (spreading misinformation) and the lazy who want miracles in a month (you want to lose how much in a month??) that turned me off to the field. Weight vests? Having someone of her weight (at the time) attempting to run on hard surfaces? Nevermind the amount of weight she lost in the first week was highly concerning and unhealthy. The average weight lost should be about 2-3 lbs weekly, not 17. Overall, she averaged out to about 2-3 lbs in that whole year, but my jaw dropped when I saw she lost so much weight the first week.

Another review here thoroughly took apart the plant based worship diet, which I agreed a lot with. There is nothing wrong with it per se and if someone chooses to be vegan, go for it. However, don't go around making uninformed and sweeping claims that it's this magical cure all diet. Weight loss is simply less calories taken in and more expended. This can happen with just about any diet, tbh.

The intent of the video meant well, but it was clearly an advertisement, as some others have mentioned. The production was slow (I started skipping every few minutes when things got cheesy dramatic), the amount of misinformation was nerve grating. The biggest problem in this field is the amount of misinformation because you got some gym rat, or someone who decided to exercise for a living, deciding that they're going to become personal trainers with zero educational background in the appropriate sciences to understand how any of this works. It makes it difficult for the factual information to get out because there are so many myths floating around due to ignorance and lack of appropriate education. It makes me sad that something like this actually got funding to become this self described documentary.

Props to her accomplishments and props to him for wanting to help make a difference for people like this. He just needs to get properly educated. ...and to get rid of that weight vest. ....I hope he doesn't believe in using sauna suits, too.",1464134400,2,3092,4.657509157509158

6619173,4,B00N9ZN9KQ,"The film is a wonderful documentary that presents a more realistic approach to tackling weight loss,but also emphasizes a healthy lifestyle.

6619174,2,B00N9ZN9KQ,"Anybody can lose a ton of weight following just about any diet. Being (probably) incentivized for participation in a doc film--and having a (most certainly free) personal coach every step of the way--would make it almost impossible not to lose weight. People lose weight all the time and gain it back. Weight maintenance, not weight loss, is our problem. You can google the subject of this movie and find her LinkedIn profile pic. She has NOT kept the weight off. I'm not judging her at all. I'm just making a point about people watching this film and thinking they're going to change their life for good by doing the same things.

6619179,2,B00N9ZN9KQ,"I realize this was pretty much an advertisement for Zen Fitness,(I don't really appreciate having to pay for an advertisement) but since the description of the movie states it's supposed to be about following someone on a weight loss journey, it was too much Zen Fitness and not enough about the subject of the movie. The bio of Carly could have been 2 minutes just to give a brief background on the trainer. He says in the beginning that it is his journey too. The description only talks about Tracy's journey, which is the one most people viewing this video want to see. Once it finally gets past that, it was interesting to hear Tracy talk about the every day struggles of being overweight. So, then they go to the grocery store and show she can eat from the produce department. That's great. What isn't great is they never show her making meals, an example of how she eats for a full day, what about cravings? What about cooking? What about the emotional ups and downs of losing weight. If she never had a bad day, never was ambivalent, just jumped right into a totally plant based diet without any struggle along the way, she is a miracle. They should have showed more meal prep. It gives the impression she was just eating carrots and apples with juicing. Was she? I'm giving it 3 stars for 1, Tracy talking about how it feels to be overweight, and 2., Promotion of plant based diets. Other than that, zero stars",1451174400,11,1418,4.5

8676739,5,B00N9ZN9KQ,"I was so inspired by this movie.  I was only one step close to being diagnosed as diabetic the Jan of this year.  I started the Whole foods, plant-based vegan and I lost around 30 pounds. Not only I lost weight, my blood works got all improved - My cholesterol profile, my blood sugar profile. Even my thyroid got improved to the point that the doctor told me and she could cut down my thyroid medication dosage in half or get me off the medication if I keep improving. I was on the same thyroid medication dosage for the last five years.  Eat Whole foods, plant-based vegan diet not only is good for our health and the planet, but also relieve so many animals from so much suffering and set those poor animals to freedom from their lifetime cages and torture.

In terms of the real reason people watch these things (diet and nutrition): ""Plant based"" is not correct. He's promoting a vegan diet. Why the blurb is cagey about that I don't know, unless they know vegan diets are really hard for most people to stick to and don't want to scare viewers off.
