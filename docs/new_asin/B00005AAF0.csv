7935141,5,B00005AAF0,"I absolutely loved this DVD.  I only had it for a few days and about wore it out, even my Australian friends here now know Commissioned first hand.  One thing about Commissioned, and that is you don't have to guess who they are singing about.  I cry everytime I hear Ordinary Just Won't Do, especially the part where Marcus Cole burst out in song, then Fred has to take over, because Marcus gets caught up in the Spirit.  How about Running Back To You.  That could be the theme song for a majority of  Christians, I mean the way the crowd accompanied Fred through the whole song.  I didn't get a chance to go to the concert due to my location (Australia), but I tell you what this DVD is definitely the next best thing to being there.  Man, I thank God for these gentlemen who still know what it means to worship God in Spirit and in Truth, but most importantly, how to relay the gospel of Jesus Christ to the masses through song.",1041120000,4,930,4.274285714285714
