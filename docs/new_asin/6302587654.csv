7827927,4,6302587654,"The mix-up is a result of the Burt Reynolds/Sam Fuller film ""Shark!"" having an alternate title of ""Arma de Dos Filos""...which is also the title of this 1990 SOV (shot-on-video) horror anthology, starring Gonzalo Vega, Gabriela Goldsmith, Rebeca Silva and Sergio Bustamante (as the Cryptkeeper-ish host in the filmed wraparounds); Oscar nominee Emmanuel Lubezki (""Tree of Life,"" ""Children of Men"") did the cinematography for the fourth and final (and, as you would expect, best-looking) episode, 'David.' The other three are entitled 'Cuestion de Honor' ('Matter of Honor'), 'Carta Urgente' ('Express Letter') and 'Equivocacion' ('Mistake').

Like most horror anthologies (especially ones with different writers and directors on each episode), this is a mixed bag, but overall pretty satisfying. Gore hounds beware as this is not a slash-&-stabber (nothing against them - I love 'em too), but more of a classic Mexican horror movie, like ""La Llorona."" It's more about atmosphere and dread, not blood and guts.

So obscure, it doesn't even show up on the Internet Movie Database!",1348963200,,1077,5.4431137724550895
