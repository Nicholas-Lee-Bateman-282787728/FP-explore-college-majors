8729732,5,B0145TNSSM,"Really enjoyed this DVD, it really does a great job of wholly sharing what really the Neurophone experience is all about and how the most amazing inventor on the planet, G Patrick Flanagan, has evolved with it!

It's packed with fun and fascinating interviews with some one-liners not to be forgotten...it's also beautifully done, with engaging graphics and has an artistic zeal all it's own.  At times, it's also quite moving, and as all great films tells a story that moves the heart and expands the soul.

And of course Dr. Flanagan and his wife Stephanie will keep you entertained throughout, a truly amazing couple, both with great senses of humor!

In addition, if you are new to the neurophone world, and have just purchased a NEO neurophone, it's got some really helpful video tutorials that you can watch in addition to the Neurophone experience.

By the way got my NEO here & love it:  https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/neo-neural-efficiency-optimizer-neurophone/x/10412227#/story",1440633600,13,991,5.32051282051282
