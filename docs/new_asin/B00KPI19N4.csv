6437567,5,B00KPI19N4,"After reading various positive reviews from Dread Central and Horror News, my
curiosity got the best of me. As a huge fan of bizarre 80s cinema, I decided to give this
one a whirl. I was pleasantly surprised when I found this movie to be a half art house
flick/half 80s homage. The story seems hard to follow at first because its non-linear, but
if you watch it to the end youll find out that its in fact circular storytelling (the end is the
beginning is the end). This piece is visually stunning and relies on good old fashioned
practical effects instead of cheesy CGI. Modern day audiences will probably hate this
film because it challenges the viewer to think rather than spoon feed a generic plot to
them. From the amount of negative customer reviews Ive read, it seems to me that
mainstream audiences have lost a bit of intellect in recent years, and were expecting
something along the lines of Transformers or Spiderman 2. Theres many underlying
hints within this film that seem to poke fun of the medical industry as well, where the
doctors use humans as guinea pigs (affordable heath care act anyone?). At the end of
the day, its up to the viewer to determine whether or not this is a series of hallucinations
that the main character is suffering from or that hes really traveling through time
somehow. Parts of the movie come across as cheesy, but you almost feel that the
filmmakers did this on purpose. The best way to describe this motion picture is a cross
between David Lynchs Mulholland Drive, Hardware, and just a pinch of Mad Max:
Beyond Thunderdome. I highly recommend this film to viewers who are interested in
weirdo cinema with a heart, and for all others, avoid it at all costs, because you just
wont get it. This is the kind of movie that you would have come across on the shelves
of your now defunct video store chain across the U.S. with a cool cover and a crazy
plot. All in all this is a very thought provoking and stylish low budget gem thats much
better than the garbage that is pumped out every month by the likes of Troma and the
Asylum. I highly recommend it for fans of obscure weird movies. Another plus is the
super cool techno soundtrack.",1411171200,8,2175,4.508860759493671

6437569,2,B00KPI19N4,"Jack Slade (Kyle Morris) is an S.E.K.  (solar eclipse kid) who has the ability to randomly time warp between 1998 and 2035. Dr. Shector  (Mark McGarrey) has transported an alien being to the earth and has created a toxic drug creating mutants. 2035 is a low budget ""Mad Max"" type of world which includes the Unit 5 Military Girls. Jack is on a quest to find Khadijah (Jamie Katonic) in order to stop this, but his quest is disjointed and haphazard for him as well as the viewer.

The film uses a techno sound track. It is all over the place and confusing, recreating Jack's mind. It brings in new characters at random whose sole purpose appears to be introducing new characters.

If this film was made in the 60's it would star Peter Fonda and would have deep philosophical meaning, like ""Don't eat the brown acid."" The production is cheesy by design. The sets and special effects were decent for an indie. This film is from the bizarre mind of Christopher James Miller writer and director who also gave himself a meaningless character role as ""Tracker"" someone who was supposed to follow our main character around, but then disappears from the script. The movie had repeated scenes of Jack's blind mother telling him her last remembered vision was that of a drip coming from a faucet. In a Peter Fonda film that would have been deep and meaningful, coming from C.J. Miller, not so. As Tom Hanks would say, ""I don't get it.""

This is perhaps a new class of films which I will just call ""Molly Movies.""

Now here is my review....WHAT? What did ANYTHING mean? This movie was horrible. The premise involved a dweeb named Jack Slade, it could have been David Spade for all that matters. He is a ""time traveller"" yet he only travels between 1998 and 2035, which makes no sense. Also, it is not a normal time travel, if that exists. He just disappears then reappears and does not even seem to have any control over this. Obviously the director is a fan of Road Warrior because there are subtle little bits that seem to have been taken directly from Road Warrior or Mad Max. I noticed a police car that was the car Mel Gibson drove in Mad Max. Then there was a dude dressed like the Vernon Wells character - mohawk, football pads. Neither was important to the script. Along his time travels, we meet some bizarre characters, a bonkers ham-acting doctor, some wanna-be punks, some wanna-be punk women, some weirdo who tracks people (I found out from the other review that this was the director), some ham-acting cop. The doctor is doing experiments making people into mutants, for no reason. Some characters we meet, and they have no backstory. Who was the creepy smiling douche in the wheelchair or with the oxygen mask? We meet the skull-faced leader of a gang, but he is gone in an instant. Some of the effects were bad, as in ""mutants"" were obviously wearing bad masks because their mouths didn't even move. I watched the whole movie with a look of disgust on my face. This movie should never have gotten any green light to be made. If you want to watch a horrible movie, with no point and horrible acting/effects, then watch this ""movie"".

6437880,4,B00KPI19N4,"Forbidden Dimensions is a loving, accomplished (if not entirely period-accurate) homage to '80s straight-to-video science-fiction post-apocalyptic time-traveling rubber-mask monster movies.

Story? Let me give it a shot. Jack Slade is an S.E.K.a ""solar eclipse kid"" (somehow having been born during an eclipse has given him certain abilities)who finds himself jumping back and forth in timefrom 1998 to 2035 and back again. He works for the Kronos Corporation, which in 1998 creates a ""wavelength generator"" that brings aliens into our dimension. The maniacal Dr. Schector then uses alien tissue to, um, do some stuff, thereby destroying the world. As the last surviving S.E.K., it's up to Jack to find some chick named Khadija in 2035 and stop Kronos and Schector (who looks and sounds like he's fronting an '80s metal band) in 1998. I think. It's weird in spades right from the get-go, and things get even more confusing near the end. I would have preferred a slightly more linear story with less jumping around. But whatever.

Overly ambitious? Well, define ""overly."" I am a big supporter of independent filmmaking and I understand how hard it is to even get a movie made, so I will let an indie get away with a lot of things I'd criticize a big-budget movie for. FD is either unintentionally bad or lovingly bad. I prefer to think it's lovingly bad. Do not take this movie seriously. It is what it is, and it knows it. As such, there's no such thing as a goof. Post-2010 cars in 1998? Crew walking around in the background? It's all good.

FD displays all the trappings of a bad '80s movie: shots that last much longer than they should, bordering on indulgent; overly expository, on-the-nose dialog (""I have to save the future!""); actors taking extra time with movements to be sure the camera is seeing it. The dialog is not just unsubtle, but often it seems like characters are having two separate conversations.

I love the total lack of adherence to medical reality (the ""reverse embryo"" scene in particular); that is, the total impossibility of it. It's as if writer-director Chris J. Miller had a bunch of weird ideas and just decided to cram them all in, whether they made sense or not. Evidently a lot of the budget went to practical makeup effects. The weak-of-stomach should probably avoid this one.

There is a pact between B-movie makers and the audience, and the director knows it: Namely, if we're going to watch your low-budget movie, we want boobies. Miller delivers. He also gets very good performances from most of the rest of his (non-nude) cast, which was unexpected. Detective Giger is a hoot. Based on the trailers on the DVD, I gather he's a recurring character in Miller's movies.

Shot compositions are remarkably good, and there's interesting and clever integration of original footage with ""guerrilla"" footage shot on location at Wasteland Weekend. There are some interesting real-world locations, and even Laurel Canyon Studios' ""sci-fi corridor"" set.

If I have one complaint, it would be the overuse of different fonts for super cards and too many modern video effects. That said, there are enough '80s-era video graphics to satisfy purists. FD features great original music, plus an extra bonus: the same music that Epic Meal Time uses!

Is it logical? No. Easy to follow the story? Not really. But is it fun to watch? Absolutely.

Note: The distributor didn't do the filmmakers any favors when they ditched the original '80s-style cover art and tried to make it look super professional. They completely missed the point, and I think a lot of viewers felt misled. Hence a lot of bad reviews.

Final note: If you pirated this movie and then didn't buy a legit copy, you suck. If you pirated it and then gave it a bad rating, there is a special place in Hell for you.",1422403200,8,3799,4.857805255023184
