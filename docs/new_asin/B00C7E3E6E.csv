5695709,4,B00C7E3E6E,"I'm officially tossing my hat in the ring for an early MST3k volume review, as I've already pre-ordered this one and have recently re-watched 3 of the 4 episodes.  Why did I pre-order it?  ""The Deadly Mantis"" was one of the very first episodes of MST3k I ever saw, watching it on the Sci-Fi channel at the tender age of 10, so this set already has me with its sentimental/nostalgic value.  EDIT:  Now that I actually *have* it, I'll give you my full review, complete with bonus features, etc.

Here's the episode breakdown:

THE SLIME PEOPLE:  A film predating&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/C-H-U-D/dp/B0053TWW36/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">C.H.U.D.</a>&nbsp;that features reptilian type creatures coming up from underground and causing trouble for the surface dwellers.  A scientist, his two daughters, some reporter guy, and a marine named Cal that apparently is played by Conan O'Brien's older brother get caught in an invasion by the Slime People, some gross monsters that live underground and put out a bunch of fog that surrounds L.A., turns to stone, then creates a barrier so the fog can sustain the Slime People's life.  While this idea did have some interesting possibilities, including a story structure that, in the first act at least, seemed a bit like an earlier prototype of Night of The Living Dead (a group of people trapped in a building surrounded by an unstoppable, unknowable menace) the movie eventually peters out into a bunch of dull chasing and fight scenes in some California hills with a bunch of fog overlay so no one is supposed to notice that a bunch of stuff *isn't* really happening.  This is a Season 1 episode, so for those of you that don't know, this episode will seem a tad slower than later efforts, there is more emphasis on sight gags, Tom Servo's voice is not done by Kevin Murphy, you will see a dull Commando Cody serial before the movie, and the riffing is still honestly pretty funny.  This episode isn't the best Season 1 effort (see Robots Monster and Holocaust for that) but its not bad, and the host segment where they deconstruct and reject the central premise of MST3k is pretty stinkin' funny.  Its made all the more funny in that, while the discussion is going on, Joel is casually disassembling and reassembling Servo.  These guys were always funny, even if the early years show them a bit rough around the edges.  Overall, its enjoyable and worth watching, but probably not one you'll use to introduce your pals to the show.

Bonus features include the trailer (I love old exploitation trailers, its always fun to see how much of the movie they spoil, how hyperbolic they get in trying to sell the film, how inept the movie still looks even though they can cherry pick the best scenes) which actually comes off kinda boring so its pretty well representative of the film itself, and a new interview with Judy (Morton) Fraser, the younger professor's daughter.  She actually looks better here than in the film (she didn't look good in the film) and her interview is enjoyable if a bit ""Hollywood"" in its telling (i.e. fake nice).  Enjoyable tidbits include the fact that The Slime People apparently had very little direction, which only comes as a surprise to anyone who hasn't seen the film yet.

ROCKET ATTACK U.S.A.:  Wow, what a crappy movie... (long rant with spoilers ahead!)  A difficult to watch, super low-budget cold war thiller, this film is bad in many ways.  After Russia launches Sputnik, the US sends a spy to Russia to investigate their advancing missle program.  His contact is a woman sleeping with a heavy, bald, nasty Russian general (""Tor Johnson Jr."" as he's called by Servo at one point) as the general apparently talks when he drinks, and he's usually drunk when he comes a callin'.  Hilariously, the US spy has to hide in closet during the general's visits, resulting in some good jokes from Joel and Co.  The US spy finds out the reds are planning a nuclear strike, gets some bad intel from a British spy, rushes in along with his female contact (who's fallen in love with him now I guess) to stop it, and they both get shot dead(!!!) with 20 minutes of the movie left.

What could possibly happen in the last act, now that both main characters are dead, you ask?  Well, the title is ""Rocket Attack U.S.A."" isn't it?  That's right, we get to watch a cardboard cutout of a missle slowly approach NYC while various schmaltzy moments of Americana play out and generals scuttle about to do something about the attack.  Some people go to a shelter, some people ignore the warning sirens, a blind guy says ""Help me"" with all the enthusiasm of a guy asking a gas station clerk for a lottery ticket, and eventually the bomb hits, kills millions, and the movie ends.  It takes 20 minutes, but feels like 40, probably due in part to the constant array of incredibly annoying sirens and alarms going off in any given scene.

The movie as a whole is completely ridiculous, with bad acting, terrible effects, no budget, awful pacing, boring characters and a 3rd act that just blindsides you with annoying stupidity.  All of it serving a very unsavory message against human feeling.  Sure, by the end of the movie we're *supposed* to be afraid of Soviet Russia, but the inept US agent is gunned down AND his mission fails only when he returns to the woman he fell in love with.  So remember kids:  Never fall in love, or New York will explode!  Its truly bad, but in a way that makes you confused and angry.

Overall, this is one very unique episode of MST3k, though I hesitate to recommend it.  Sure, the riffing is solid from beginning to end (and the Bela Lugosi serial at the start is fun), but the film itself might prove intolerable to anyone who isn't already a seasoned bad movie watcher.  What I'm getting at is ""Rocket Attack U.S.A."" is truly a funny episode, but this is one I would absolutely NOT show to someone who's never seen the show before, they'd be driven mad by the film.

Bonus features include no trailer, but only a Life After MST3k: Trace Beaulieu (he was Dr. Forrester and Crow during the Comedy Central years, in case anyone didn't know that).  I like these Life After MST3k segments.  Not for the information they provide (that's easy enough to track down thanks to the INTERNET), but because we get to see the personalities of the performers as they reflect on their body of work.  For instance, based on these segments I now know that:  Mike Nelson is self-critical, Bill Corbet is gracious and appreciative of all his opportunities as an artist, Frank Conniff is very humble and kind, and J. Elvis Weinstein is an awful, pretentious, insufferable, delusional toolbag.  In this segment, not only do we learn how to correctly pronounce Trace's last name (finally!), we also learn that the man is a true comedian, glad to make hilarious jokes through his entire interview.  I've never laughed so hard at a Life After MST3k segment before, the guy is seriously funny.  He also seems warmhearted happy with his life, but he's not one to take himself too seriously, which is awesome.  Very enjoyable interview.

VILLAGE OF THE GIANTS:  Another Bert I. Gordon film, this movie combines Mr. Gordon's trademark ""enlarging"" special effects (as seen on previous Gordon flicks and MST efforts like ""The Amazing Colossal Man"" and ""Earth Vs. The Spider"") with those stupid bikini beach party teen movies with the result being one crazy little movie.  Basically, a young Ron Howard makes some goo with his chemistry set, his older sister's boyfriend feeds it to some ducks and discovers it makes the ducks grow really big (what else?), then a bunch of juvenile delinquents find and eat it (because they *dare* each other to, of all the stupid reasons), grow really big, and take over the town demanding all the adults stop hassling teenagers and bring them fried chicken and stuff.  As with most of these beach party movies, the plot is light, there's perfunctory romances, and most of the film is a flimsy pretext to show teens dancing to crappy sixties music and women shakin' all over.  Most of Gordon's films are very serious, ""Village of the Giants"" is definitely not, and his trademark special effects actually come off much better in a movie that's supposed to be silly and campy.  I laughed out loud at the giant ducks crashing the dance to jump around and shake their *actual* tailfeathers to the 60's rock playing in the background.  This is an unusual movie coming from Gordon, and while its not exactly his most interesting film, there's some great riffing in this episode, so it ends up being pretty fun overall.

Bonus features include the trailer (which focuses mostly on the teens dancing and the women shakin' it yet goes out of its way to say its based on a novel by H.G. Wells) and a brand new interview with Joy Harmon, the scary-faced, overly-tanned teen in the movie that burst out of her sweater and put guys in her bra while she was big and dancing in slow motion.  As you'll recall during the episode, Mike and Co. said about Harmon, ""just think, now that girl looks like leather, smells like Marlboros and Giorgio and makes her grandchildren call her by her first name...""  and they seem to have been right!  Unlike Judith Fraser from The Slime People, Joy Harmon has absolutely *not* aged well, and is now even more scary then when in the film (which was still pretty scary)!  Her career path is not surprising, seeming that she got parts for looks more than ability, but I'm happy to report that she started a nice cooking/bakery business in Hollywood that's still family run.  Her most interesting tidbit is that the tiny buckets of fried chicken that they ate for the movie were actually some kind of small bird that was slaughtered and fried, and that they ACTUALLY ATE!!!!

THE DEADLY MANTIS:  This one really takes me back.  As I said earlier, this is one of the first, if not THE first MST3k episode I ever saw, so its one I have fond memories of.  Revisiting it recently, it remains a very solid, very funny entry, and one I'm happy to see get released on DVD.  The movie itself is another Universal sci-fi flick, the titular monster being a giant praying mantis frozen in Antarctica that breaks free and takes down some planes, then causes some trouble for a military base and later a city.  As usual for these types of films, the first half is taken up by a scientist and various other personel trying to figure out what's causing the disasters, then the monster reveal, the military takes it on, etc. etc. etc.  You know the formula.  So do the MST3k crew, they did plenty of these types of movies.  This being Universal (as opposed to AIP or some other, smaller studio) the monster looks pretty good for its era, and the military action isn't bad either.  On the whole, its a nice little creature flick, if a tad talky at moments.  So the movie is fun enough, and the riffing is very good.  My favorite segment is when the main scientist is explaining the mantis claw to someone and the old man pops up on the side, silent during the whole explanation, and Mike and the Bots just keep inserting senile, confused old man lines inbetween the pauses of the explanation.  I'm describing it horribly, but trust me, its hilarious.  A very fun episode.

Bonus features include the movie's theatrical trailer (which gives away most of the movie INCLUDING THE ENDING!!!), a somewhat dull and droning introduction by Mary Jo Pehl (sad, considering she brings a lot of energy to her characters in the show... not so much here) and a short (under ten minutes) yet nice doc about William Alland, who worked on the film with Jack Arnold.  If you've seen the doc's Ballyhoo does for these type of movies on other MST3k volume bonus features, you know what you're getting.  They're always well done and interesting.

Not a bad set, all things considered.  If you're a fan, absolutely pick it up.  If you're for some reason brand new to MST3k yet still reading this review, you should probably grab&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystery-Science-Theater-3000-Vol-XIX/dp/B003XL6EJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystery Science Theater 3000: Vol. XIX</a>&nbsp;first, as it has some of the best the series has to offer.  But there's tons to enjoy, you really can't go wrong with any volume, it's one of the best shows ever to grace TV.",1365638400,35,12421,4.777621722846442
5695710,5,B00C7E3E6E,"Mystery Science Theater 3000 Collection Volume XXVII features three episodes from the Comedy Central era of the show and one from the Sci-Fi Channel era. Two episodes feature show creator Joel Hodgson as host and two feature head writer Mike Nelson as host. These are four solid episodes and three of the feature films used are low budget science fiction, the core film genre of the show, though personally I think the incredibly low budget cold war propaganda film makes for the strongest episode of the four. This is another solid set with a wide variety of episodes spanning the history of the show from seasons 1, 2, 5 and 8.

108- THE SLIME PEOPLE with short: COMMANDO CODY PT 6
Los Angeles is invaded by an army of subterranean monsters in this black-and-white film from 1963. A pilot, a scientist with his two daughters and a marine fight to retake the city. It's silly fun with cheap costumes, lots of smoke effects, and a very low budget look all around. 1940s star Robert Hutton both stars in and directs this mist-shrouded film. MST3K host segments focus both on the ridiculous nature of the Commando Cody short and of the feature film. I personally like this one a lot, maybe because I enjoy these kinds of silly monster movies from the period so much and because I think they worked very well for MST3K. Good riffing makes for a good solid effort in just the eighth network episode of the show.

205- ROCKET ATTACK USA with short: THE PHANTOM CREEPS PT 2
This black-and-white 1961 cold war propaganda film comes shortly after the launch of Sputnik, so the premise revolves around the Soviets gathering data from it to launch a nuclear missile against the US. An American spy is sent to Russia to determine how far along the Soviet missile program has progressed and discovers that a nuclear strike is imminent. This is one of my favorite episodes as there are so many poorly constructed scenes and dialogue in the film and MST3K just jumps all over them with great jokes. Some of the best jokes are during the early scene where the spy has to meet his contact in a restaurant, the scenes where the male spy is hiding in the closet of a female spy while she ""entertains"" (ick!) a gross Russian general, and the later scenes where the two spies try and sabotage the rocket. The movie is so cheap in one scene the Soviets are inspecting their nuclear armed rocket and thanks to the lighting and shadows in the scene it's clear there is no rocket at all. The short, Phantom Creeps, starring Bela Lugosi is also hilarious. I'd buy this DVD set just for this one episode which features the very first ""stinger"" ever, a short clip from the film that caps off the episode after the MST3K credits have rolled. This one is the blind man saying, ""Help me"" in an oddly flat tone of voice during the air raid panic after the Soviet missile has been launched.

523- VILLAGE OF THE GIANTS
This 1965 color film by Bert I. Gordon stars Beau Bridges, Tommy Kirk and Ron Howard. The Beau Brummels make a musical appearance as well. This film is a lively science fiction comedy, but it falls somewhat flat and comes off as mostly campy and silly. A teenager's girlfriend's kid brother (Ronny Howard) whom they call, ""Genius"", invents a compound that makes animals grow extremely large. When some bad teenagers get hold of the stuff they grow to unstoppable giants and it's up to the good kids in town to stop them. Some of the special effects look okay while others are so fake looking as to evoke laughter. The host segments feature TV's Frank getting sacked by Dr. F, interviewing with Mike and the 'bots and then eventually getting his job back.

804- THE DEADLY MANTIS
A prehistoric giant insect spreads winged terror in this 1957 black-and-white film that used to run endlessly on UHF channels back in the 1960s and 1970s. The special effects are passable and the movie is somewhat fun when it's not stuck on some slower scenes added for padding. This is the fourth episode from MST3K's first season on the Sci-Fi Channel so the host segments are full of new characters and story arc elements that the network asked them to add to the show, including bomb worshiping mutants inspired by Beneath The Planet Of The Apes. This episode is solid fun from the classic giant bug movie to the first appearance of Pearl Forrester's VW ""Astro-bus"".

5695717,4,B00C7E3E6E,"If you end up enjoying just one movie out of the four on any of the MST3K sets, then it's well worth it.
On this one it's ""The Deadly Mantis"". Actually a good 1950's Sci-Fi, and the gang is again at their best.
""Village of the Giants"" is a typical teenage drive-in movie, and I probably won't watch that one again.
""Rocket Attack U.S.A."" is fairly good just because of the state of mind people were in at that period in our history.
""The Slime People"" was a REALLY low budget film of the early 60's, and pretty bad, but the guys get in a lot of good jabs, so that's one I'll watch again also.
In all, I have six MST3K sets. They still entertain even after many viewings.
This is not the best IMHO (I really like ""The Lost Continent"" with Cesar Romero-I have the MST3K set and the original 1951 movie), but it's good.",1441843200,,816,4.203821656050955
5695718,3,B00C7E3E6E,"This is the one MST3k DVD I really wanted. The set includes the episode ""Village of the Giants,"" a cult classic starring 60s pin-up Joy Harmon who provides an interview rather than a commentary of the movie, but being as this is MST3k, a commentary would not be possible. As far as the other movies in the set, it includes ""Deadly Mantis,"" from the SyFy years accompanied by a short review of the career of horror movie maven William Alland. Not a bad movie, but it doesn't rank with other movies in the series. There's ""Rocket Attack USA"" and ""Slime People,"" two of the worst movies in the series; so bad that none of the show's signature riffing can save them. Although, ""Rocket Attack USA"" does have one of the chapters of a Bela Lugosi serial, but it's not enough to help save the movie. The best part of the set is ""Village of the Giants"" which by itself should have had numerous bonus feature, and that alone is worth the price of the set. The only problem with ""Deadly Mantis"" is that it's already in the sets of everyone who taped the series. The only other good thing is the interview with Trace Beaulieau. Overall, not a bad set, but it could have been made superior with two better movies to go along with ""Giants"" and ""Mantis.""",1437868800,,1239,4.43859649122807

5695768,5,B00C7E3E6E,"The good people at Shout Factory have released another outstanding volume of Mystery Science Theater 3000 movies.  The low-budget flick ""The Slime People"" (1963) boasts some scary looking monsters.  Unfortunately, because the slimy creatures have enveloped L.A. in an impenetrable fog, it's hard to see a lot of the action in the film.  Being a Season 1 episode, Joel Hodgson looks like he's in a fog!  (Yes, that's a compliment.)  ""Rocket Attack U.S.A."" (1961) is more of a paranoid fever dream than an actual movie.  Characters come and go with no rhyme or reason.  At least comic actor Art Metrano bought a necktie before the cataclysmic ending of this flick.

My favorite film in this volume is ""Village Of The Giants"" (1965), directed by Mr. BIG himself, Bert I. Gordon.  When asked what he wants for breakfast, big man about town Fred (Beau Bridges) good-naturedly replies ""Sheriff, on toast.""  What a kidder!  If you think Beau is a good actor, just wait until you see him dance.  My only complaint is that, because of time constraints, they cut out Freddy 'Boom Boom' Cannon's performance of the song ""Little Bitty Corrine.""  The final film is ""The Deadly Mantis"" (1957), another giant insect film from the fabulous fifties.  Those type of movies really bug me, especially with lines like the following.  ""In all the kingdom of the living, there is no more deadly or voracious creature than the Preying Mantis.""  I wonder if Ed Wood was an uncredited script writer on that movie.  I hope Shout Factory has enough movies left to keep releasing more Mystery Science Theater 3000 volumes as good as this one.

P.S. - On November 3, 2013, I saw Cinematic Titanic's presentation of ""The Doll Squad"" at the Wilbur Theater in Boston.  The show exceeded my wildest expectations, and was hilarious from start to finish.  At the meet and greet after the show, I asked Joel Hodgson how many more MST3K movies were left to release at this point in time.  ""Sixty movies"" was his answer.  I asked above the crowd noise, ""You did say sixty 6-0, not sixteen, 1-6.""  Joel replied, ""Yes, there are still sixty MST3K movies that haven't been released yet.""  The line of people had to keep moving, so I couldn't get any more details about getting the movie rights to release all of the films, how frequently they would be released, etc.  But, I must say, that was very encouraging news to me!",1375574400,2,2380,4.746341463414634
5695769,5,B00C7E3E6E,"The art of movie riffing is almost dead, but the MST3K sets keep the art alive and the laughs coming.  In the 27th set the 4 movies are great, with one actually having a pretty good cast including Beau Bridges, Tommy Kirk, in the Village of the Giants. As usual the sets are well matched and great for a long weekend!",1375401600,4,317,4.19672131147541
5695770,4,B00C7E3E6E,"Preface: I am sharing my personal opinion on here. If for some reason you strongly dissagree and need to vent - please create your own review - and do Not create a scene on my review.

Here is my break down - DVD by DVD - then my overall review/rating of this 4 DVD set.

#1, THE SLIME PEOPLE (black & white), Feat Joel, J. Elvis & Trace.
Starts with 'SHORT' Comando Cody #6 (also B&W). This short didn't do anything for me. rating 1.5 (out of 10)
At 39:49 mins a comment about Bobcat Goldthwait and mentioning an upcoming 'Police Acedemy 8' - which as of this writting (July 2013) is actually slated to happen in 2015 - I met Micheal Winslow recently who said it's likely to happen). At 103:39 mins a funny riff about 'going parking'. Most of this movie is in the fog and like 10 guys in scary suits. The movie didn't cut it for me - and not much for laughs from me. Rating of 'Slime People' 1.5 (out of 10) (I usually don't go for these early ones)

#2, ROCKET ATTACK (B&W), Joel, Kevin & Trace.
SHORT 'The Phantom Creeps' w/ Bella Lagosi - I really like this short!! Great riffs at times - sometimes one after another that cracked me up!! Rating on this short 7 (out of 10)
Rocket Attack: At 26:06 mins a funny intermission about 'Charlie McCarthisum'. I had a few smiles and laughs, but it just didn't click for me. - I guess I'd rate this at 3.5 (out of 10).

#3, VILLAGE OF THE GIANTS (Color mid 60's), Mike, Kevin & Trace. An odd cast of (young) Ron Howard, Beau Bridges, the Rifleman's Johnny Crawford and Toni Basil (of the Go Go's?). An interesting set up of a potion and 8 teenageers becoming like 50 feet tall - but the movie didn't do much with it - and it fizzles out. However - I really enjoyed the riffs and although it may sound like a low rating - I gave it a 6.75 out of 10 (my favorite of this set!

#4, THE DEADLY MANTIS (B&W) Mike, Kevin & Bill (and Mary Jo - not a fan of her). Movie itself a bit more interesting than the riffs. I thought it was kind of cool when the mantis flew. I had a few laughs - it just didn't click for me. Rating 3 out of 10.

In general - I LOVE MST3K (and Rifftrax - and Cinematic Titanic) - I hope they release everything!! I went to see two back to back shows of Cinematic - loved the meet & greet afterwards. Most of them were nice - Mary Jo said she'd post with me for a photo - but pulled away when I went to put my hand on her shoulder - she's too fussy for me. - The rest - Trace, Frank and J. Elvis were super!! I met Joel - but didn't get to talk with him much.
I wonder if they are running out of 'SHORTS' to release on DVD.
Anyways - As someone else said - no matter - I hope they release EVERYTHING!!
My overall rating on this set - is only about a 3.75 out of 10. - But I still would have bought it again!!

Remember - you can disagree - but please don't spout off on my review. Kind words on here only please. - Or fell free to write your own seperate review - like I did. Thanks.",1375056000,,2945,3.972927241962775
5695771,5,B00C7E3E6E,"The movies, as usual, are horrible.  And this set is no exception.  The riffing is, as usual, really good.  Some of the quips are hit or miss, but 99.9999% hit the mark and run anywhere from a guffaw to fall on the floor hilarious.  The extras are pretty good and give some background to the movies and the stars of MST3K.

And again, Shout Factory has done an outstanding job of the lead-ins and cover art.  If you are an MST3K fan (as I am - and you must be if you are here), the purchase of this set is a foregone conclusion.  If you are just starting to discover MST3k, welcome - and hit the ""buy"" button.  Then, sit back and enjoy the madness that the rest of us have been telling people about for years!",1374883200,8,709,4.124087591240876

8578134,3,B00C7E3E6E,"A mixed bag of mysties, teh Giant Mantis is my favorite of the bunch, although no way Paul doesn't get hte girl.

Slime people has an interesting premise.

Village of the Giants - Well, it's an  exploitation movie, and Bert I Gordon, so you get what you pay for.

Rocket Attack USA is really bad.",1523145600,,296,4.327272727272727

8578139,5,B00C7E3E6E,"THE SLIME PEOPLE, Episode 108. A pilot (Robert Hutton) hooks up with a professor, his two nubile daughters, a Marine and, along the way, a cynical writer (Les Tremayne) to alternately hunt and evade mysterious slimy creatures from below who terrorize Santa Monica under an inescapable veil of solidified fog.  This black-and-white 1963 movie is every bit the loser it sounds -- applied fog is used to cover nearly every sin, from the fact that the monsters are not in the least convincing, to the fact the production ran out of funds nine days into shooting. Once the fog clears enough for us to see that the monsters look like eczemic rubber suits, the joke has already run its course.  The riffs are fun, but the host segments reveal this to be a part of the first (or formation) national-broadcast year, though I did like the Mads invention of scary cotton candy that screams when Dr. Erhardt (Josh E. Weinstein) bites into it.  The feature was preceded by a Commander Cody short when Our Hero was still on earth.  The disc includes an interview with Judee Morton, who played the professors younger daughter.

ROCKET ATTACK USA, Episode 205.  I never thought the end of the world would be so boring"" says Tom Servo, and he has a point.  This bottom of the bottom-of-the barrel 1958 movie succeeds neither as entertainment nor as propaganda, and comes across as preachy and tiresome.  Even the acting is sub-par, except for career actor Art Metrano in a brief role as a truck driver.  Except for some mockery of the Commies (per Joel, their head of government phones up the local tobacconist to see if they have Prince Albert in a can), this overly serious bit of exploitation almost entirely free of comic relief often lacks for parody material; on the other hand, Joel and the bots do well drawing on the discrepancy between then and the Nineties.  (Crows advice on how Manhattanites should have prepared for a sneak Soviet attack:  Move to the suburbs.)  Some fun exists in a parody game show about atomic topics, and the beginning short features Bela Lugosi, whose accent alone is riffable.

VILLAGE OF THE GIANTS, Episode 523.  This colorful and well-funded 1964 movie is a study in how to aim for multiple audiences and not quite reach any of them.  Producer Bert I. Gordon (whose initials form the highly appropriate acronym B.I.G.) tried to hitch his 1950s movie themes of big creatures terrifying helpless humans (such as THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN, EARTH VS. THE SPIDER, and WAR OF THE COLOSSAL BEAST, all sent up at MST3K) to the hedonistic go-go spirit of the middle Sixties.  All this is set in a Disneyesque small town (actually the Columbia back lot) when a ten-year-old genius (nicknamed Genius and played by a young Ron Howard) cooks up an experimental goo that expands local animals to super size.  The plot really kicks in when a gang of malevolent teenagers from another town (headed by a teenage Beau Bridges) steals the goo, expands appropriately, holes up in the local movie house -- and then Beau takes the sheriff's little daughter hostage in the name of Youthquake.  Listen hard, and you can practically hear the a crack widening into a full-fledged Generation Gap as horror, teen, and Disneyesque kid themes all struggle for supremacy.  Happily,  S-O-L riffing is perfectly tuned to the many challenges posed by this slumgullion, though there were a few too many Opie references for my taste.  An interview with Beaus sexy girlfriend Joy Harmon, filmed at the time this compilation was made, adds interest.  I can honestly say I liked my second viewing more than my first.

THE DEADLY MANTIS, Episode 804.  This 1957 Universal creature-feature stars Craig Stevens, William (Paul Drake)  Hopper and Alice (Alix) Taunton and is typical of what the studio tossed out with such apparent ease that year.  In the far north of Canada, above the DEW (Distant Early Warning Line, a real thing), a gigantic praying mantis is set free who goes looking for humans in lieu of other insects for sustenance.  If you don't know that the U.S. military is heavily involved in things, that a scientist will explain just why an enormous mantis is so fearsome, and that the creature will eventually attack the population centers of the Continental U.S.A., you haven't seen many of these.  By this time Mike and the bots could take on a film like this with several eyes closed, but they come through as usual.  In an interview included with this disc, Mary Jo Pehl astutely points out that one of the chief flaws of this kind of movie -- perhaps more apparent in this film than similar ones out of Universal -- comes in not getting the monsters scale consistent.  Is the mantis somewhat more than human-size, or half as big as the Pentagon?  At present, THE DEADLY MANTIS is the only episode of the four not available for streaming from Amazon.

Although only one of these movies lands on my close-to-favorite list, the new lower price and the fun of watching the host segments and riffing grow in sophistication and confidence make this Volume 27 well worth having, in my opinion.
