8167918,5,B000MD1IUQ,"I just saw the film. I had heard stories about the killings when India was partitioned in 1947. It was a blunder on part of leaders on both sides to let the British cut up the country like that. Two million perhaps more died, and many many more lives were disrupted. The sub-continent is still affected by those events. The film Train to Pakistan is a captivating film and several actors give brilliant performances. But my hat off to Divya Dutta to plays the dancing girl. She played her role to the hilt! Nobody could have done it better. I had no knowledge of her acting career until today. Now onwards I will watch out for her other movies. For those who have hard stories of and have lived through the partition this film will be worth watching. This film and TV series such as Jewel in the Crown partially bring the horror of partition in to the homes of the viewers. Watch if you can stomach it.",1493683200,,902,4.375

Although the movie is based on a fictional novel of the same name, the storyline is great and the acting is amazing !",1240704000,3,224,4.463414634146342
