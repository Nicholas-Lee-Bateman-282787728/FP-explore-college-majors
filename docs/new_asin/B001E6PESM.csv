It totally takes me back to my younger days when my elementary school class would watch the film every year on the day after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day,but watching this film really takes you to the reality of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and how a young boy legend who would become to be our future civil rights leader activist hero with an instant vision that  this great Nation of ours would one day succumb racism & segregation. Now although they're maybe some parts missing to this autobiography film however it still is to be a great story told about our fallen hero and legend. So you see his legacy that starts from when he was just a little boy.",1526515200,,757,4.293706293706293

8296787,5,B001E6PESM,I remembered watching this show as a 4th grader and the huge impact it had on my life! So I was extremely excited to find it on sale here. It is defintely a must -have for any parent wanting to teach their children about the civil rights movement through the lens of a great American leader. It prompts discussion and ultimately inspires.

8296788,1,B001E6PESM,"This dvd cost $25.00 and the movie is only 31 min. long it cut all the good parts,and skip alot of important parts, you can tell when it is skipping a part the blinks like it is going to commercial and is not worth the money, thr company should have how long a movie is on the details for the movie. The only good thing about this is that I called the company and informed them that I am not happy about paying 25.00 for a movie that is not even 30mins long and they are going to let me return the movie and credit my card back<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Boy-King-Short-Version-Home-Use-Version/dp/B001E6TFXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Boy King (Short Version) (Home Use Version)</a>",1267574400,11,733,5.220338983050848
