6898727,4,B00R4JLIDS,"As a track sprinter, this yoga series was very challenging and I felt like it was a great off day workout. His commands were a bit fast so I found myself pausing a bit.

6898734,5,B00R4JLIDS,"So I started doing yoga to help my running. I love yoga classes, but they can get $$ and the times offered aren't always a good fit in my schedule. I bought 4 of these Giam Athletic Yoga DVDs and I am very happy that I did. I admit it can be hard to get yourself motivated to use them, at least with a class you have to be there and if you paid you don't want to waste that money. So sometimes I do struggle with using these regularly enough. It has helped having spent 2 years going to yoga classes to have a better understanding of what they are doing in the video, bc I feel at some points they go a little fast. I haven't quite gone through EVERY single sequence on all DVDs yet, but I do feel there is a bit more overlap than I would prefer, I would want more unique sequences so I don't feel I'm doing the EXACT same routine every time. But overall, these are fantastic and I recommend  them!",1496620800,2,898,4.016759776536313

6898739,5,B00R4JLIDS,"All I wanted was a system that is easy to follow, and that leaves out all the Hindu spirituality stuff. Great program.",1484352000,2,118,4.409090909090909

8694076,5,B00R4JLIDS,"The Gaiam yoga for athletes series is fantastic! Only 20 minutes a workout, I don't feel like the Tin Woman anymore and look forward to a gentle day. It would be a good idea to know some of the basic yoga moves like downward dog, cobra, warriors, and triangle. Kent's voice and instruction are soothing and clear. And I love all the athletes! I've been doing these almost daily for 6 months and am over 55. I often modify the pose, so as not to injure myself. Highly recommended!",1518566400,,479,4.393258426966292
8694077,1,B00R4JLIDS,"Dont buy it. Kevins advisor, not yoga teacher has him do possess. What a snooze. You cant do yoga WITH HIM because the teacher rarely tells what hes doing.",1518393600,,155,4.379310344827586
8694078,5,B00R4JLIDS,This video is a hit with me and my son. We are able to do these exercises together and have fun doing them. The fact that it is a professional athlete doing the exercises helps my son to want to do it more often. All blocks of exercises are basically 20 minutes which is rather easy to do morning or night. It provides a good workout in a short time.,1515801600,,350,4.014285714285714

8694080,5,B00R4JLIDS,"This video enhances my  my home yoga practice. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, simple not confusing does not make promises that can not be fulfilled. Love this video. I would recommend it to anyone who is starting a yoga practice or a nice change if you are an experienced yoga practitioner .",1510531200,,307,4.581818181818182
8694081,5,B00R4JLIDS,"This is one of my go-to yoga discs and I use it at least twice a week.  I like Kevin Love and he's actually pretty good at the routines too.  The sequences are put together very well and I use this when I need just to stretch and restore my body, but still give the lower body strength training at the same time.  I feel refreshed and loose when I'm done, so I'd recommend this to anyone looking to just let your body open up and relax.",1504656000,,436,3.9885057471264367
8694082,5,B00R4JLIDS,"Purchased this DVD on a whim and it turned out to be an instant favorite. I bought it because the routines include my favorite poses (half moon, twisted triangle, warrior 3) and find I'm using the DVD two or more times a week because the 20-minute stretch segment allows me to add a nice, thorough yoga-based stretch after my cardio and/or strength routines. I love Kent Katich's instruction. It reminds me of the Anusara classes I used to take. The four segments are wonderful whether used together or alone and it's easy to customize your practice. A gem of a yoga DVD!",1504569600,,571,4.607843137254902
