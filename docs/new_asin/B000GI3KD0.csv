8132560,3,B000GI3KD0,"These are okay if you can purchase them at a low price. The films are copied from okay prints and some, such as the George O'Brien show off some spectacular Utah scenery in and around Zion's National Park as well the rim of the Grand Canyon. This is also interesting as Zane Grey wrote the original story for the film rather than it being based on one of his novels. Each of the discs include in additional to the feature film a Special Features section BUT all of the same material is included on each disc! If you really enjoy early ""B"" Westerns then you'll likely enjoy this series.",1398816000,,585,4.376146788990826
