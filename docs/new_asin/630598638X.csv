7899192,5,630598638X,"I'm not one of those weirdos who like big muscle babes usually, but I surely love Sue Price.  I loved the original Nemesis, missed the others till I saw this on cable one time, and bought it...yep, for a nekkid Sue Price, especially for her very nice boobs.  (I know they are fake, but would you want to see her chest as only muscle?)

It's a decent movie, but I admit, if it wasn't for a very often nekkid Sue Price I wouldn't bother, and I love Pyun movies.  Bonus for an actually not bad cyborg sex scene.",1396483200,,508,4.153061224489796
7899193,3,630598638X,"I liked N2 and N3 better than this one. The first two were normal filmaking and storytelling. This was a little weird and artsy. I think director Albert Pyun shows very good vision in his work, but this just felt a little awkward like an art film that just doesn't make it. Maybe it's only me. If you like Sue Price, buy this DVD. She looks great and is worth the viewing.",1059609600,3,372,4.180555555555555
7899194,3,630598638X,"The muscle of Sue Price is not to big. I'm very happy if she want to workout more hard and back to the next film with bigger muscle. The thing in this film where i not like is:she don,t appealing her muscle and the running time is too short. But i still like this film.",974332800,,269,3.909090909090909
