8059919,2,B0009EWJEM,"I'm pretty sure I'm reviewing the right tape here.  It's 30 minutes long and is from Kids Klassics.  There's no image shown on the previous web page but everything else matches up with the tape I have.

These cartoons feature the old version of bugs bunny from the 1940s.

I gave it 2 stars since I don't like this incarnation of Bugs.

I don't know exactly when they transformed Bugs into the more familiar version which to me was his best incarnation. Probably in the 1950s sometime.

They took some of these great stories like Falling Hare and created new versions I think with the newer Bugs.
