5409640,5,B00ADRYEDE,"Loved this movie!  The cinematography and soundtrack were simply amazing and who doesn't like Rashida Jones?!  It was funny, whitty, and a little heartbreaking - the perfect mix for a great film.",1346371200,,195,5.0625
5409641,4,B00ADRYEDE,"Can a couple remain friends while they are divorcing? Our eponymous lovers have been a couple for so long and are so compatible, not even a pending divorce can interrupt their constant joking, role playing and bawdy horseplay. They are best friends. This unpredictable and intelligent R-rated script, written by Harvard graduate Rashida Jones and Trinity College graduate Will McCormack, doesn't whitewash any of the characters. In fact, Celeste is the most flawed character in the film!

We see:
  * Rashida Jones (""Parks and Recreation"") is Celeste, a whip-smart ad agency executive, stuck with an unwanted contract to promote The Next Lady Gaga, much to her chagrin! She and her best friend/husband of six years are separated, but she's ""doing GREAT!""
  * Andy Samberg (""Friends With Benefits"") is Jesse, her slacker husband. He's an artist who can't seem to meet any deadlines and is currently renting a mother-in-law apartment from his soon-to-be ex.
  * Rebecca Dayan (""Limitless"") is Veronica, the gorgeous but unexpected element who appears out of nowhere and sparks a crisis. Even though we may want to, we can't seem to make her the villain.
  * Chris Messina (""Like Crazy"") is Paul, a nice fellow who signed up for yoga because he wanted to meet women.
  * Ari Traynor (""What's Your Number"") is Beth, the patient best friend who can only watch in baffled frustration as her chum has a meltdown.
  * Eric Christian Olsen (Lots of TV) is Tucker, the fourth member of their constant foursome, who finds the antics of his separated friends to be disconcerting.
  * Emma Roberts (""It's Kind of a Funny Story"") is Riley, the tween diva who is petulant, spoiled, vain and desperate. She's the one destined to be ""The Next Lady Gaga!""
  * Elijah Wood (""Lord of the Rings"") is Celeste's boss, who counsels her to ""get out there and start dating again!"" (Well...maybe not those exact words...)
  * Will McCormack (Lots of TV) is Skillz, the drug dealer who naturally manages to maintain a friendship with both friends.

Expect drug use and profanity, but no sweaty bodies, car chases, gunshots or blowie uppie stuff. The lovely Ms. Jones (who, by the way, is the daughter of Peggy Lipton and Quincy Jones) is a capable and appealing actress, and everyone else does a fine job, too!

Idle speculation: Is Hollywood trying to tell us that being a slacker is normal for young men? When this comes out on DVD with Amazon.com, watch it and tell me what you think.",1346198400,,2459,4.8349282296650715
5409642,5,B00ADRYEDE,"This is a comedy and drama, very much like 1989's 'When Harry Met Sally.' Most important, it portrays the ups-and-downs of relationships in today's world, on TV shows and in the Real World. The question millions of people have asked themselves after a loving relationship ends, can we still be friends? Celeste and Jesse met in high school, married young, and after reaching age thirty, began to grow apart. Celeste became successful in her career and Jesse is content at being unemployed. They clash in opinions and arguments until Celeste asks for a divorce. Jesse accepts the transition, still in love with Celeste. As they are apart, Celeste had second thoughts, and they both realized that in order to truly love someone, you may have to let them go. There are mixed-emotions, humor, and heartfelt moments. Acting Performance Very Good. Enjoyable and Highly Recommended!",1344038400,14,875,5.083333333333333
5409643,5,B00ADRYEDE,"I love love love this movie.  It's mostly funny and sometimes sad but gut-wrenchingly honest all the way throughout.

This film is about two people who truly love one another and get along fantastically, but fundamentally want different things out of life. I found this movie relatable, funny, smart and refreshing. Plus, Andy Samberg and Rashida Jones have great chemistry.",1499040000,,303,4.96078431372549

5409660,3,B00ADRYEDE,"I ended up renting this movie because my wife really loves Parks and Rec, and had been wanting to check this out for a while because of Rashida Jones' involvement. It's a well-made film, in that the overall production is solid ; however, I found the characters in the film, and their overall development throughout the film, to be incredibly irritating. That said-- my wife, who was super excited to finally see this, was left more disappointed than I was with this movie. It's one of those films where... it's not bad, it's just sort of OK. Overall it's worth checking out. I'm sure some people will love it, that just wasn't the case here.",1473206400,,641,4.582608695652174

5409666,4,B00ADRYEDE,"This was a surprise. Truly felt connected to the main characters and their emotions. Sure, the main story is about relationships and breakups but the message goes deeper than that. It's about taking chances, failing to recognize great opportunities, and just realizing how confusing life can be even when you think you've got it all figured out.",1468108800,,345,5.0701754385964914

5409674,4,B00ADRYEDE,This was a good movie too bad it didn't do well in the movies however I find quiet a few gems on Amazon by honest reviews and not critics. Everything that Hollywood promotes are high budget action movies while they have their place we miss out on alot of good movies. I usually find a good share by putting in the actors name that I like and seeing what comes up. In this case Elijah Wood although his part wasn't big I still enjoyed this movie quiet a bit..rent it you won't be disappointed. Although I will say its not a laugh all the time type of thing.,1460678400,,556,4.157407407407407

5409678,5,B00ADRYEDE,"I heard about this movie and I was a fan of both the actors, so I decided to check it out. I really enjoyed it. There was some humor within it, but there was also a lot of heart. There were moments where my insides like scrunched up. It tells a story of a couple in such a realistic way that I really appreciated it. If you're looking for a romantic comedy that is more realistic to real life and not just a fantasy, then I suggest you watch this. Perhaps not recommended for people who just experienced a break-up, unless you want to be extra sad. The DVD came in a standard plastic case with one disk. It arrived in a timely manner.",1454198400,,634,4.120967741935484

Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg have always been two of my favorite actors, and when I found out that they were in a movie together, I had to watch it. I first rented it, and watched it three times in twenty four hours. I cried each time I watched the ending, and I never cry at movies. It was so sweet and genuine. This movie is (as the tag line says) a loved story. It is amazing and completely underrated, and I will watch it no matter what my mood.",1449446400,,517,4.078431372549019

5409686,5,B00ADRYEDE,"An amazing movie that explores the relationship between two people who are getting a divorce....but are still best friends.  The script by Rashida is amazing and hilarious and heart-breaking, and it portrays romance and break-ups in such a real, messy way.  This is also a truly remarkable performance by Andy, who is almost exclusively known only for his comedic work; It truly makes you wish that he did more drama. Very, very funny, but it also made me ball my eyes out....so there's that :P",1447804800,,494,4.8
5409687,3,B00ADRYEDE,"A bittersweet rom-com that will ring true with anyone who has been caught in that middle ground between friends/lovers with your ex, where you can't quite let go, and continue to be best friends until all of a sudden, one of you moves on.  I have been there.  However, Andy Samberg has no charisma or acting ability. I found Celeste and Jesse together insufferable and I just kept thinking...""Celeste, you're mooning over whiney, self-centered, sophomoric Jesse when you have hot, sweet, funny Chris Messina waiting in the wings?"" I would have rewritten the movie to have less Jesse, and more of her finding herself with Paul.",1447113600,,626,4.89622641509434

5409694,5,B00ADRYEDE,"I love this movie. About a relationship in which one person is an adult and the other still a child. Men at any age can always find a young attractive mate who will support them. Jessie manages to get a one night stand pregnant and ends up in a relationship, yet the woman who supported him (paid for everything, gave him a place to live) gets screwed over. This is an honest picture of reality. As a successful woman, I can say that this movie made me take a good look at myself and my standards in a mate. Never again will I settle for someone who isn't my equal. I saw myself in Celeste's character, holding onto a relationship that was long gone just for the comfort of familiarity. I have watched this movie over and over again and don't see the value in its ""patience"" message. Was Celeste supposed to support him his whole life? No way, she needed to move on and find a mature guy who actually could support himself. The woman Jessie knocked up seemed like an idiot to me. Who has a baby with a guy who was a one night stand? That being said, I still love this movie. I think it is a great example of why women shouldn't settle and should move on quickly when a relationship sours. Dwelling in the past, hanging on to bad relationships only causes more suffering.",1440460800,,1270,4.295833333333333
5409695,2,B00ADRYEDE,"I thought this movie was going to be funny given it's cast of mostly comedy actors, but it was just a slow burn emotionally draining movie.  Even if I was in the mood to wallow, I would find this too depressing to watch.",1439769600,,220,4.116279069767442

5409707,3,B00ADRYEDE,"Whats it about?

Celeste (Rashida Jones) and Jesse (Andy Samberg) are the perfect couple. Well, except for the fact that they are getting divorced.

What did I think?

For all the cheesy romantic comedies that Hollywood churns out, there are those films that invert the genre with aching honesty and richly drawn characters. This is definitely the latter. A smart and original flick written by Jones herself, this is an intensely human portrayal of what comes after the happily ever after. Theres no big, romance-conquers-all, orchestra-swelling finale; no big, looking-back-on-moments-past-only-to-realize-youre-really-in-love-with-your-ex-who-is-just-about-to-get-married-to-someone-else montage.

5409719,4,B00ADRYEDE,"Celeste and Jesse have been best friends forever and have so many cute and not-so-cute quirks and habits and inside jokes that it seems they can read each other's mind. However, they're officially separated, though living on the same property, and don't seem to be in a hurry to move ahead with their divorce. Celeste is the career-minded breadwinner, and Jesse is the goof-off who never realizes his potential - always disheveled and late. Celeste is tired of waiting for him to grow up, but not ready to play the dating game and find someone more suitable.

The need to move ahead with the divorce takes front burner when Jesse announces that he has been dating another woman and that she has become pregnant. This brings up all sorts of anger and angst in Celeste because he was never ready to have a baby with her. The second half of the movie revolves around how they navigate this new phase of their relationship - will they go ahead with the divorce or will they get back together? Is there really a ""Forever"" for Celeste and Jesse?

""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" starts out funny and cute and clever, but doesn't ultimately live up to the promise of the first hour of the film, as the plot sort of peters out at the end. Nevertheless, I found it somewhat charming and entertaining and felt that the two main characters were perfectly cast.",1420070400,,1345,4.6
5409720,3,B00ADRYEDE,"Although I did not hate the movie like some of those that only gave it one star, I somehow expected a lot more from it. I think Rashida is trying too hard at having the things she is part of be amazing (such as was the case with the tv show from A to Z). It has it's moment but I just thought the story line was going to take me somewhere else. I did not expect poor Jesse to be so involved all of a sudden making it impossible for the story to go anywhere else. I don't know, I thought it would be simpler I guess. It's not a bad movie but I'm still glad it was only three bucks. Watch it if you have nothing else to do and just want to see a new movie, but don't expect too much out of it.

I have watched it several times within a few days. Rashida Jones is a brilliant writer and should write more movies.  Great acting by everyone involved. It was also extremely well directed, I felt a lot of the ups and downs along with the pain and suffering with the interesting shots. Lastly if you are a fan of music they use some perfect songs that capture the mood. I am someone who hates it when movies overuse corny music, but this was well done tastfully and worked extrememly well so I will be able to enjoy this movie forever.

5409788,5,B00ADRYEDE,"Comedy and drama are deftly blended in this touching and unusual movie about a couple on the verge of divorce who are having trouble letting go and moving on.  Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg are perfectly cast in the title roles; their characters are flawed but lovable, and both actors give sensitive and honest performances.  The supporting players are uniformly excellent, and director Lee Toland Krieger capitalizes on all the inherent laughter and heartache in the clever script which was written by leading lady Jones and Will McCormack (who also plays the part of Skillz in the film).

The blu-ray offers superb picture and sound, and contains a numbers of bonus features, including a ""making of"" featurette, a Q&A session conducted at the LA Film Fest where the film made its debut, a few deleted scenes, two commentaries, and the theatrical trailer for this film and several other Sony Pictures Classics releases.  For me, the biggest surprise contained in the bonus material was interview footage of Andy Samberg, in which he expressed a certain level of insecurity about his ability to play the more serious scenes in the film; I've always detected a layer of truth in his comedy, even when he was playing slapstick, and so it didn't surprise me at all that he was able to tap into that same humanity and play drama convincingly.

""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" is highly recommended to fans of the various cast members, to moviegoers looking for a new spin on an old theme (romantic comedies about divorced couples), and to student filmmakers interested in seeing how a small, modestly budgeted film can be expertly put together.  A gem.",1391472000,5,1646,4.924187725631769

5409821,5,B00ADRYEDE,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The plot, as described by Amazon, is about a couple who have been best friends for a while but are going through a divorce. However, they still are inseparable best friends that have their friends confused. Once Rashida Jones' character goes draws the line and pushes more for a quicker divorce, Andy Samberg's character matures and moves on with a new love interest. This maturation hurts Rashida's character and realizes her mistake of letting him go.

The movie is funny with decent acting. It is a bit slow but it is a drama/romantic-comedy so you must appreciate the genre it is in. There were moments I was rolling on the floor and other moments feeling sad for the characters. Overall it is a great movie and would recommend it.",1379376000,2,767,4.723880597014926

5409824,4,B00ADRYEDE,"Breaking up ... Then breaking up, is hard to do?  This is the question to be answered within this surprising romantic comedy with substance and heart.  From what could have been just a mediocre story, this one gets lifted from the movie-watching doldrums due to an amazing performance by Rashida Jones.  She brings a much needed warmth, depth of emotion, and palpable vulnerability to Celeste.  Jones lifts up this plot and shines as her character's fire continually flares-up - then burns-out - only to ignite again.

The movie begins with a germinal opening montage of the history of Celeste and Jesse (Andy Samberg).  From High School sweethearts, through college, to their subsequent wedding day, their relationship plays through with an inerrant soundtrack which makes all the difference with this treatment.  Original songs along with smoky melodies (Sunny Levine and Zach Cowie for 'Biggest Crush') add intelligence and quiddity with a soulful touch.

The couple is out having dinner with their close college friends Beth and Tucker, feeling quite pensive and dismayed while watching the demonstratively frisky pair across the table.  They are making ready for their own wedding.  Celeste and Jesse are now divorcing and live separately, although are still affectionately close friends.

These two are constantly together; going out socially, are extremely playful with one another, but things just didn't work out therefore they still are having too much conflict over their decision.  While the movie gives a great look into their friendship and the love that remains, the reason for their separation is not altogether clear. This is where the whole drive of the plot would have stalled, although these actors' solid treatment of their characters counterstep this and make the following situations plausible.

Deciding to date others is a major problem, especially for Celeste while an old flame, Veronica, reenters the picture for Jesse.  While her entire life dives into a histrionic tailspin, Jesse discovers his new girlfriend is pregnant.  He, after much back and forth with Celeste's and his own antics, decides he may want to ""make things work with Veronica"" while seriously contemplating being a father.  All of this happening just in time for their best friend's wedding.

Rashida Jones co-writes 'Celeste' to be the primary character and easily shows her ability to carry a movie.  Director Lee Toland Krieger (The Vicious Kind) includes bit, but never too small, character roles. Elijah Wood is her comically direct boss and Emma Roberts portrays her risible, self-absorbed musical client (who doesn't know the meaning of ""regime"") adding a shift to the storyline and pulls it from the questioning and unresolved couple.  This is a smarter indie comedy that is refreshing, digging deep in many places and introduces Rashida Jones as a major player.",1378339200,6,2868,5.25

5409860,5,B00ADRYEDE,"Rashida Jones wrote a wonderful movie about true love and friendship, albeit, this movie ends in divorce. As fictional as this story may seem, very much of it is based off of real life events. The genuine nature of this film will enamor even the most extreme romantics who plead for a fantasy ""Happily Ever After"". It really is a great movie. You should watch it.",1373587200,,363,4.515151515151516
5409861,4,B00ADRYEDE,"Like others, I found this movie to be better than I had anticipated.  You get a couple of convincing and well developed characters in Celeste and Jesse, and some of the secondary characters such as Jesse's best guy friend are also given some good lines.

I felt that Celeste's motives for ending the marriage were very clear.  Unlike others who were so dissapointed that they did not stay together, I thought it was inevitable that they would not.  On the contrary, found myself wondering how they had decided to get married in the face of such overwhelming evidence of the differences in their priorities and temperaments.  Yes they had been best friends since high school, but seriously, do we marry our best friends from high school?

While both experienced a great deal of emotional distress, both emerged in a far better place.  Jesse is with someone who loves and appreciates him without wishing he would change, and, he feels that for this woman, he really does want to strive to make things work.  Celeste comes to understand what she has lost, and becomes a bit more expansive in her ability to tolerate if not accept the imperfections and foibles of friends and strangers alike.  Along the way she meets someone with whom you feel she might eventually be far happier than she was with Jesse.  I find it interesting that so many other viewers were disappointed that Jesse and Celeste move on with their lives when you have been shown that they have both grown and have both connected with new partners with whom they can have mutually appreciative and respectful relationships.

Rashida Jones did a great job with the script, bringing these characters to life, giving them convincing psychological depth (though some of the Jesse/Celeste shared antics were cloying beyond belief).  As an actress she  reminded me not a little of Meg Ryan, who, it must be said, did the cute sheepish grin/big eyes thing much better.  But I do hope she keeps  on with her writing.",1373414400,3,1971,4.789940828402367

5409885,4,B00ADRYEDE,"""Celeste & Jesse Forever"" is a sweet romantic comedy that attempts to twist some conventions of the ever popular genre. The film is about Celeste and Jesse who were high school sweethearts. They went on to get married, but later Celeste, now a successful trend analyzer, decided that they should divorce while maintaining a friendship. They are still best friends - their divorce is not finalized - and, with her nice ""ex-husband"" around (who seems still attracted to her), the life of Celeste is going well.

But one day Jesse confesses that he has been dating a new girlfriend (who is now pregnant). Now Celeste must face a difficult choice: Will she really move on or not? Told largely from Celeste's viewpoint, the story of ""Celeste & Jesse Forever"" (directed by Lee Toland Krieger, ""The Vicious Kind"") reminds us that breaking up is hard to do, especially when we, like Celeste, don't know what we really want to do.

The film's greatest asset is, not surprisingly, the title characters Celeste and Jesse and the chemistry between Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg. Whenever they share the screen, the film is amusing with the charming couple Celeste and Jesse. Unfortunately, most supporting characters including a spoiled starlet Riley Banks (Emma Roberts) and Celeste's business partner Scott (Elijah Wood) are far less interesting.

""Celeste & Jesse Forever"" is a sweet, or bitter sweet, little romantic comedy. It may not be as unique as it thinks it is, but still entertaining.",1371600000,,1485,5.004048582995951

But I've been dying to see Andy Samberg (one of my FAV comedians) in a semi dramatic role & this one delivered 100%. This movie had a unique story line I have never seen -- EVER. Not to mention, I've heard about Rashida Jones (Celeste) in other roles but never watched, but I'm a HUGE fan now of her acting & writing abilities. Oh & get this, she wrote this movie with another co-star (Will McCormack) who plays Skillz in this movie too. This entire cast is incredibly talented & top it off it was directed by someone I just ran across in IMDB (Lee Toland Krieger) a few months ago for his direction on another movie. Great movie.

The writing and acting are both very good, and Jones and Samberg have great chemistry. Jones' likability in particular carries the film through some of its more uncomfortable moments. And Emma Roberts' character, which has more shading than secondary characters in this type of movie generally get, is a delight. While not quite as good, it reminded me of one of my favorite romantic comedies -- (500) Days of Summer -- for its honest-feeling portrayal of how love unravels.

I thought the movie was charming, the actors were all just great, and I really enjoyed the story. Rashida Jones is absolutely lovely and Andy Samburg is funny, yet subdued in this movie.

The lesson here is a good one, that love and marriage take patience. And, a good relationship is worth the effort.",1367193600,2,576,4.58252427184466

The story weaves through the end of a marriage between to best friends.  The writer skillfully takes us along for the ride as one of the characters unexpectedly grows up, and moves on, leaving the ""adult"" one to figure it out.  I don't want to be a spoiler, so I won't go into the plot.  But the film was beautifully acted, and like life.. it has humor, and tears, and awkwardness.  Don't dismiss this as a small film, it can easily become your favorite.

5409929,5,B00ADRYEDE,"I did not expect this movie to be as good as it was when I decided to purchase it.  This is one of those movies that, when you reflect back on the situations the main characters find themselves in, you really appreciate the movie and may end up watching it a second or third time through.  The acting was solid, especially when it needed to be (like when she finds out the big news), and most of the time when I asked myself: ""How would I react to that?"", their reactions were largely similar to what mine would have been.

My favorite part is the ""climax"" when the two main characters finally confront their emotions outside of the bar and they do it angrily and storm off.  You can really feel Rashida Jones' heart breaking in that sequence of scenes as she is at her wit's end and has nothing left to lose so she goes for broke and comes up short.

This ending was the type of ending I LOVE because you will like it, or dislike it, based on who you are as a person.  No doubt they are perfect for each other and had great chemistry (both in the movie and as actor/actress) and this really made the point stick that sometimes life just doesn't happen the way we want it to and no matter how much we kick and scream, it carries on with or without us.

I actually loved the language in this movie.  I feel like it was placed well.  I will never understand how people consider vulgar language to be indicative of anything other than a different way to express yourself.  Her use of the f-bomb when she finds out the big news framed this movie's dialogue and was awesome.",1364860800,16,1569,4.252525252525253

JUDGMENT CALL:

Once in a while, you watch a romantic comedy that distinguishes itself from rom-com's.  In the case of ""Celeste and Jesse Forever"", co-writers Rashida Jones and Will McCormack take on the storyline of relationships that were meant to be, find your soul mate but yet due to circumstances, a (wrong) decision was made and now there is regret.

""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" will be sure to tug on those who have experienced heartbreak and regret.  I don't know how many times I have heard many couples breaking up or divorcing because of status or financial status.  you often hear about how some find it difficult to be in a relationship when the woman is the breadwinner and the man, is not.

In the case of this film, Celeste is the owner of a company, a driven woman who is great at what she does.  But the problem is that Jesse wanted a family, he wanted more from the relationship but unfortunately he was unemployed.

And while these two are best friends, they have the same mannerisms, they enjoy the same entertainment and jokes and literally are in sync with each other, for Celeste, she was so used to having Jesse around her, no matter what.  He lived behind her, if she calls him, he's always there.

But because they are separated and are divorcing, he has now tried the dating circuit and met someone and also has gotten her pregnant.

And for this business woman who had lived her life quite well, is starting to realize while she gave so much to her business and professional status, she really never gave so much to her relationship and that one person that she did love and was her best friend, she is now losing her soulmate.

Actually for both Celeste and Jesse, they know that they are each other's soulmate but because of their divorce and now that he wants to raise a family with his new girlfriend, despite being in love with each other, they know it's too late to go back.

While I enjoyed the film, especially when it focused on Celeste and Jesse, there were some times through the film that other side characters didn't make so much sense and I was actually turned off by it.

Jesse's good friend Skillz is a druggie that somehow becomes Celeste's good friend during her time of need.  Getting her high and seeing her go from this strong individual to this mess that starts getting drunk smoking weed or drinking alcohol, I just didn't think she had to fall that far down, nor did the writers have to go there just to get a point out of how miserable she is.

While the scenes of Celeste and Jesse doing stroking jokes with lip balm or food, to show how both have an awkward style of humor, although I didn't care much for it, I actually was expecting it, considering comedian Andy Samberg was in the film.

As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is fantastic and because the number of club tracks or party tracks featured in the film, music is also brings a lot of bass to the lossless soundtrack of ""Celeste and Jesse Forever"".  As for special features, you get a good number of special features especially two different kind of audio commentaries which was cool.  And also a Q&A that was held at the LA Film Fes which was a great addition to this Blu-ray release and other special features included as well.

Overall, ""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" is an entertaining romantic comedy about love, marriage, divorce and regret.  But it's a different type of romantic comedy that is fresh and different from what one will usually see in a film.  While most romantic comedies tend to focus on falling in love and finding that one true soulmate, ""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" is about a divorced couple who realized they were true soulmates but unfortunately, drifted apart and realized that they actually had something quite special, a little too late.

""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" is recommended!",1364601600,,7129,4.8031173092698936

I get it, we all screw up our lives, some of us better than others, but I didn't feel myself rooting for someone to come out ""ahead"" in the end.  Also, the weird little rituals between Celeste and Jesse were just too over the top.  They were shooting for a bonding quirkiness, but instead fell into offputting.  (Is ""offputting"" even a word?)

Jesse takes up the new relationship with hesitancy but he wants to move on with his life and heal. The new woman is offering him everything that Celeste was afraid to give, acceptance, love, and a family. Celeste learns the very hard way what a gift it was to have been truly loved.

5409996,2,B00ADRYEDE,"What this movie has going for it is the suspense of seeing how the wreckage of disintegrating lives will turn out. We keep hoping for a redemptive ending of some sort, but the ultimate lesson here is that life's mistakes really can be irreversible, and trivializing marriage vows--or treating them as a refundable warranty--can lead to a lifetime of regret. This film is a treatise on how to lose true love, and be stranded in something less...forever.

The acting is strictly midrate; Samberg is especially unconvincing in his decision to not just move on but actually love another, even as he looks at Jones with the same longing. The ending is not uplifting by any means, but it does make an effort to give us a brighter, more ordered verdict after rollicking through so much chaos and lost opportunities. A depressing story--despite all the efforts at humor--but at least the lesson is as clear as it is timeless.",1360540800,8,917,4.80379746835443
5409997,2,B00ADRYEDE,"Leaving aside the dimwitted dialogue, meandering plot, gratuitous drug use and generally unsympathetic characters, what really impressed me about this movie was how technically awful it was.

Nearly every scene is heavily colored with blue and orange.  They do this with computers after filming.  At one point it was considered cool, but now that everyone is on to it it just looks stupid.  People will look at this movie in a few years and find it ridiculously dated looking.

Next is the shaky camera.  At points during the movie you might be getting into it, finding yourself immersed in the story and trying to understand the characters.  Sorry, then you'll be distracted by the neverending wobbling of the camera.  It's like they paid a cameraman to drink a Super Big Gulp and film the entire thing handheld with a full bladder.  Just very distracting and unartistic for a film that claims to be about artists.

Finally the makeup is awful.  They just pancake it on most times.  When they're trying to make the characters look haggard, i.e. with less makeup, is when they actually look more beautiful.",1360454400,2,1106,4.855614973262032

The premise of the movie was new, or at least I hadn't seen this take on a movie relationship before and it looked like it might be a nice change from the usual movies in this genere.  Unfortunately, I found the movie to be unfunny, unmoving, and overall unintersting.  A quick summary of the movie:

**spoiler alert**

The basic premise of the movie is about Jesse and Celeste who were married for a number of years and when it didn't work out they borke up but continued to live together.  Jesse lives in an art studio in the back of the home occupied by Celeste.  They are still oficially married, but haven't yet signed the divorce papers.  Celeste seduces Jesse one night when they are both durnk and they end up sleeping together.  The next morning Celese blows off Jesse who thinks that sleeping together was a sign there is still potential to be a couple.  Jesse then knocks up a girl he had seen in the past and he decides him and this new girl will make a realtionship work for the sake of the baby.  Meanwhile, a jealous Celeste goes on various dates and questions whether she really wants to divorce Jesse. At the conclusion of the movie Jesse and Celeste share a laugh when they sign the divorce papers and the movie ends.

I laughed once the entire movie and found the other attempts at humor to fall flat.  I didn't connect with any of the characters and didn't develop any feelings toward them.  Every time I thought a scene might develop into something interesting, the camera cut out and went to the next scene.

I'm not really sure who I recommend this movie to.  Other reviewers seemed to like it a lot and maybe it just wasn't my type of movie.",1360108800,9,1747,4.395638629283489

I also have to say that the large supporting cast (that includes Elijah Wood, Emma Roberts, Mark Messina and Will McCormack is excellent.

5410013,3,B00ADRYEDE,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  'Celeste and Jesse Forever' is a witty comedy about an ex-couple who are still best friends and seemingly have everything in common together, but are on the verge of getting divorced. When we first meet Celeste and Jesse, played by the talented Rashida Jones (who was a co-writer of the screenplay) and Andy Samberg (of Saturday Night Live fame), it's evident that both these actors have tremendous chemistry together. Their best friends walk out on them at a restaurant because they can't believe that they're getting divorced, when they seem to be so in synch with one another. The couple does their 'shtick' together, adopting simultaneous mock German accents and simulating masturbation with a lip balm.

  Why is it that Jesse and Celeste are getting divorced, since they seem so compatible? Well, Celeste, an extremely successful 'trend forecaster' and cable news commentator, looks down on Jesse's lack of ambition; he's an aspiring artist who's taken freelance assignments, but really not making much money at all.

  I was expecting the plot to go in the direction of the couple drifting apart but eventually reconciling. But the story becomes something entirely different when Jesse reveals that a fling he had with old friend Veronica, a few months before, results in her becoming pregnant. Jesse decides to try and make things work with Veronica and Celeste must now cope with that new reality. Samberg virtually drops out of the film for a good part of the second Act, with everything now focusing on Jones, who plays Celeste as a young woman who is unable to have that one epiphany which will lead to self-discovery. When Jesse does interact with Celeste, the witty banter is gone, and ultimately he decides to throw his lot in with Veronica, a complete cipher of a character.

  Meanwhile, there are a succession of 'loser dates' Celeste goes on which don't quite make the grade in the comedy department. Much better is the Yoga Guy (Paul) who Celeste eventually ends up with. Fortunately Jones has just as much chemistry with Chris Messina who plays Paul as with Samberg. There's also a humorous sub-plot with Riley, a pop star, who Celeste ends up bonding with, despite a marketing gaffe with a gay theme.

  'Celeste and Jesse Forever' morphs into a tale of a young woman who must finally give up her arrogance in order to have a successful relationship. There's quite a bit of wit in the writing here but when things get 'serious' (after things sour between the once compatible couple), the film isn't quite as successful. 'Celeste and Jesse Forever' is mainly worth seeing for the chemistry between the principals (in the early part of the film), witty dialogue and some of the sub-plots that keep the story moving.",1359244800,2,2779,4.9081196581196584
5410014,5,B00ADRYEDE,"I went into this movie with unfairly high expectations.  I could already tell by watching the trailer thirty times that this movie is right up my alley.

I was not disappointed. In fact, it exceeded my expectations and then some. I came out of that movie dealing with emotions that I haven't felt in a while that I really thought were out of my system. And isn't that the point of movies sometimes? To be able to relate to them on the deepest of levels without it being too pretentious or forthcoming?

The script and storyline were amazing. Rashida Jones and Will McCormack did a phenomenal job creating a story that everyone knows and really being able to relate and connect with those characters. Rashida Jones, Andy Samberg and the rest of the cast did a great job portraying these characters. We all have those friends that wonder why we still are friends with an ex. We all have that gay voice of reason.

And the soundtrack.  The soundtrack is ridiculous and has been the only thing I've listened to since purchasing the mp3 album three months ago. It's soul meets electronica meets lily Allen meets Latin music. Noteworthy tracks: No Other Plans by Sunny Levine and Young Dad, Love Will Find a Way by William Bell and Rescue Song by Mr. Little Jeans.

In conclusion, this movie may not be for everyone. For those people on the mend, come hither and watch Celeste + Jesse Forever. It may have the power to help you heal.",1358553600,9,1427,4.5546875
5410015,5,B00ADRYEDE,"I never heard of this movie before I saw it so I didn't know what to expect. Usually I'm not a fan of breakup movies but I really enjoyed this. You can really relate to the things they are going through the entire movie. Anyone who's ever gone through a rough separation or breakup will really connect with this movie.

I highly recommend 'Celeste & Jesse Forever' to everyone!",1358467200,5,377,4.463768115942029
5410016,4,B00ADRYEDE,"""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" (2012 release; 92 min.) brings the story of Celeste (played by Rashida Jones, who also co-wrote the script) and Jesse (played by Andy Semberg), who have been ""best friends forever"" since their youth, got married 6 years ago, and now are separating but still remain friends. One day Jesse runs into Veronica, a Belgian girl (played by Rebecca Dayan), and starts dating her, even though he remains tormented by the loss of Celeste. In the rest of the movie we watch and wonder whether Celeste and Jesse ultimately will reconcile.

First off, you need to take a leap of faith that, despite still being BFFs, Celeste and Jesse are in the process of divorcing. It's never explained why that is happening, other than a general ""taking each other for granted"" type explanation (which does not square with the two spending all their time together). But once you can get over that, the movie works like a charm. Jones just oozes charisma, and with her recent roles in The Social Network, The Muppets, and Our Idiot Brother (not to mention her TV work on Parks and Recreation), she is cearly an up-and-coming talent. Can't wait to see what she will do next. There are several other smaller but still choice roles in here, notably Elijah Wood as Celeste's boss, Emma Roberts (niece of Julia Roberts by the way) as the Ke$ha-like pop singer, and the already mentioned Rebecca Dayan as the Belgian girl.

Bottom line, I really enjoyed this more than what I expected going in, and in that sense ""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" is another winning indie rom-com, not unlike, say, Ruby Sparks, Friends With Kids or even Your Sister's Sister. ""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1354838400,30,1699,4.815068493150685
5410017,4,B00ADRYEDE,"One thing this serious-minded 2012 romantic comedy does is prove that Rashida Jones (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Parks-Recreation/dp/B002DPPH6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Parks & Recreation</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Social-Network/dp/B004HWT6DO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Social Network</a>) can carry a film. Like Debra Winger and Holly Hunter before her, she's one of those actresses who comes across as a little too smart for the room but still elicits affection when she allows herself to reveal her vulnerability. This must also be the way she sees herself since she co-wrote the screenplay with featured player Will McCormack (the stoner pal of Andy Samberg's character) and is in almost every scene of this movie. Fortunately it doesn't come across as a self-serving act of megalomania despite the character she plays. She's a type-A career woman, a celebrity trend-spotter who compulsively controls all her impulses, while Samberg plays a slacker graphic artist who's fine with not working for long stretches and repeatedly watches videos of the weightlifting competition from the 2008 Beijing Olympics for inspiration.

Directed with a surprisingly deft hand by Lee Toland Krieger (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Vicious-Kind/dp/B0037UU848/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Vicious Kind</a>), the movie focuses on how these two characters, married but separated, remain an absurdly compatible couple whose failed attempt at marriage initially seems quite dumbfounding. They both contend they can divorce but remain best friends, an assertion that appalls best friends Beth and Tucker who are about to get married and can't understand why they won't move on with their lives. That's the simple premise, and the rest of the story deals with what happens when one starts to get serious about someone else and how neither is prepared for what it will do to their relationship. Their stop-start confusion is palpably played out amid a cool but lived-in LA that feels like an appropriate setting for this familiar story. Jones has Celeste carry most of the emotional burden, and she lends genuine likability to a character that could have otherwise been downright insufferable, which is a constant source of humor in the clever script.

Samberg is good in his first serious role although he sometimes seems too recessive to counterbalance Jones' energetic presence. Emma Roberts (Julia's niece,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Valentine-s-Day/dp/B002ZG99UE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Valentine's Day</a>) plays Celeste's petulant Lady Gaga-wannabe pop star client Riley Banks with fervor and brings a nice edge to her scenes with Jones, while Elijah Wood has coiled fun playing Celeste's uptight gay business partner. Ari Graynor (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conviction/dp/B004LQEZ3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conviction</a>) and Eric Christian Olsen effectively play Beth and Tucker to their accustomed stereotypes. Chris Messina shows up yet again in a prominent supporting role, this time as Celeste's acerbic patient suitor in waiting. There are moments, scenes even, where I felt the movie was a little too satisfied with itself, but it usually recovers with amusing twists on conventional romcom situations mostly involving Celeste's inability to accept the inevitable. That, of course, places the pressure on Jones to deliver the goods as both star and screenwriter, both of which she handles quite well here.",1354752000,6,3643,6.417515274949084
5410018,4,B00ADRYEDE,"While much of this romcom may seem familiar, it is not your traditional glossy Hollywood affair. Written by Rashida Jones (TV's ""Parks and Recreation"") it is based on a real life relationship she had with co-star Will McCormack who plays Skillz, a close friend.

In a breakout performance Jones carries the movie as a just turned 30 year old whose marriage to Jesse (Andy Samberg) she summarily decides to end. He doesn't resist but they vow to remain best friends. Their relationship goes back to their school days and while they seem perfectly happy, Celeste can't see children with him or a traditional future. Jesse is an artist who has no motivation to be successful. He's satisfied watching reruns of the Beijing Olympics.

Celeste is a borderline successful marketing executive who has just signed one of the young vapid pop stars of the day (Emma Roberts). A series of blunders puts the two at odds but ultimately close. The real story here is the emotional roller coaster Celeste and Jesse go through once Jesse finds another beautiful woman who becomes pregnant. Celeste plays the dating game for a while but is uncomfortable with the whole idea. It is then they both realize they didn't understand each other as much as they thought.

Backed by an excellent supporting cast, especially Elijah Wood as Celeste's gay business partner and Ari Graynor as her best friend, Jones is a wonder in this slightly off-kilter film. She shows remarkable range as she goes from hysterically funny to drunk and disorderly to being drained emotionally. It all felt very real.",1354752000,2,1570,4.916981132075471

5410021,4,B00ADRYEDE,"""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" (2012 release; 92 min.) brings the story of Celeste (played by Rashida Jones, who also co-wrote the script) and Jesse (played by Andy Semberg), who have been ""best friends forever"" since their youth, got married 6 years ago, and now are separating but still remain friends. One day Jesse runs into Veronica, a Belgian girl (played by Rebecca Dayan), and starts dating her, even though he remains tormented by the loss of Celeste. In the rest of the movie we watch and wonder whether Celeste and Jesse ultimately will reconcile.

First off, you need to take a leap of faith that, despite still being BFFs, Celeste and Jesse are in the process of divorcing. It's never explained why that is happening, other than a general ""taking each other for granted"" type explanation (which does not square with the two spending all their time together). But once you can get over that, the movie works like a charm. Jones just oozes charisma, and with her recent roles in The Social Network, The Muppets, and Our Idiot Brother (not to mention her TV work on Parks and Recreation), she is cearly an up-and-coming talent. Can't wait to see what she will do next. There are several other smaller but still choice roles in here, notably Elijah Wood as Celeste's boss, Emma Roberts (niece of Julia Roberts by the way) as the Ke$ha-like pop singer, and the already mentioned Rebecca Dayan as the Belgian girl.

Bottom line, I really enjoyed this more than what I expected going in, and in that sense ""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" is another winning indie rom-com, not unlike, say, Ruby Sparks, Friends With Kids or even Your Sister's Sister. ""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1346457600,,1699,4.815068493150685
