7431826,5,B0159OSRNI,"""A Brilliant Young Mind"" has a two-fold purpose:  It is a good title for this DVD movie, and the acting of this brilliant young lad named Asa Butterfield.  I have a copy of this DVD in my collection when its first primer occurred.  Whether a true mental genius or just an average youth, the sudden death of a parent at a young age is very traumatic.  Although inspired by true events in the life of a High School teenage math prodigy named Nathan, the challenge for a young lad like Asa Butterfield to fulfill this role in this movie production is astounding.  It is remarkable how Asa Bullterfield acted out the twofold reality that true Genius comes from the personal ability of a prodigy balanced by opening his heart.  One of the best examples was Nathan and his Chinese Girlfriend who came to show him real love of a friend with no sex play.  The supporting actors - Sally Hawkins, Rafe Spall and Eddie Marsan were magnificent in performance as they reached the epicenter of reality that closure to life's problems have no quick solution, and may require years in tandem with a succession of several episodes for a person - of any age to arrive at positive closure.  Sudden death is real, especially with thy young who lost a parent or loved one in the military due to combat or terrorism.  Here is a DVD movie that can speak to any young person who suffered sudden loss.  What better resource, than this movie production in DVD format in which any person grieving can find hope - especially in the example of a young teenage youth.",1453852800,10,1537,4.536231884057971
7431827,5,B0159OSRNI,This is a wonderful well made film about the triumph of the human spirit. The cast performances are fantastic especially Sally Hawkins and Asa  Butterfield but real star is the story.,1453766400,,183,4.903225806451613
7431828,3,B0159OSRNI,"The British film industry loves a good underdog story. From the dancing feats of outcast Billy Elliot, to that One Chance Billy Corden gets in the recent tearjerker, the desolate weather of the otherwise-beautiful Kingdom of Great Britain clearly needs to be counterbalanced by the occasional serving of inspirational fluff. (That trend doesnt so much translate to British television programming, which is as dry as the streets are wet, and utterly fatalistic, often to hilarious effect). Some of those feel-good films work (the recent Pride, about gay activists, was touching and relevant), some not so much (see (or, rather, dont): Blow Dry, Pirate Radio); Morgan Matthews A Brilliant Young Mind falls right in the middle. It goes through all the usual motions of such fare, but its dependable cast and unexpectedly subtle ending keep things from becoming too maudlin.

The tone and characters are swiftly established from the outset. The prologue, scored by an almost-unbearably twangy soundtrack, wastes no time introducing us to the dismal world of the Ellis family: the young child, Nathan, is declared unique by his doctor, who goes on to  somewhat harshly  state that the boy will remain socially awkward for the rest of his life. Nathans parents, Julie (Sally Hawkins) and Michael (Martin McCann), are naturally horrified. I have lots of things to say, Nathans voice-over whispers, Im just afraid to say them Ive always been like that. (Asa Butterfield plays the older version of Nathan, while Edward Baker-Close shows up as the young Nathan in frequent flashbacks that halt the story-line.)

Michael is your definition of the perfect father, sticking french fries up his nostrils to amuse his kid, but never forgetting to sprinkle a little wisdom here and there. One day, as they're driving, just as Michael utters another gem  You shouldnt be afraid, to be exact  a car smashes into them, instantly killing the father, and forever scarring Nathan and his mom.

Cut to the present. A pot-smoking, foul-mouthed, self-loathing math professor who suffers from a debilitating illness and depression (yep, thats some heavy stuff right there), Martin (Rafe Spall), recognizes Nathans incredible arithmetical talent and agrees to tutor the boy. From that point on, we see the events unfold mostly from the boys perspective, as he is accepted into the International Mathematics Olympiad, travels to Taiwan with another tutor, Richard (Eddie Marsan), meets a girl, learns how to play piano and speak Chinese (!!), bunks with another socially-awkward teenager, and has his triumphant moment, overcoming his fear and figuring out a math sequence, making everyone smile/nod in recognition, and then proceed to clap uproariously. In the meantime, Julie and Martin engage in a little romance of their own  a minor but affecting subplot that buoys the film in much-needed sincerity, maturity and novelty.

Matthews is a TV veteran, and while his direction is confident, his filmmaking roots are apparent: Brilliants visual approach and structure are quite pedestrian. Its pretty shots of despondent city districts, courtesy of cinematographer Danny Cohen (The Kings Speech), keep the film just this side of having that Lifetime special feel.

The cast, saddled with sometimes-overbearing characters, handle their roles with aplomb. And therein lies the strange juxtaposition: the films thoroughly predictable story beats are counterbalanced by the actors, whose little mannerisms (one scene, involving an awkward kiss between Julie and Martin, is particularly memorable), gentle humor and barely-perceptible nuances keep all the triteness imminently watchable.

The same disparity can be applied to the films dialogue: for every obvious mathematical analogy (Its about adaptability Sometimes we have to change our shapes to fit in; Music is math) there are shining moments, perhaps improvised by the actors, such as when Richard calls Martin a wasted opportunity, and then proceeds to describe his flock of genius outcasts as the sixteen cleverest young brains in the country.

Matthews made the sensible decision to focus the film on the characters, not the the competition. Butterfield is quickly becoming one of the more promising contemporary young actors, though, to be hypercritical, his performance here does lack a little depth (the blame is on the director, who seems to have failed to elicit more from the actor than a mystifying blankness). The kid does show range and growth, after his roles in Hugo and Enders Game. Sally Hawkins reunites with her Happy-Go-Lucky co-star Eddie Marsan; though they barely share the screen, both have moments of real warmth. But the heart and soul of the film is Rafe Spall, making his character a lonely, passionate, caring bear of a man.

There is a commendable anti-bullying message  especially powerful in a scene where an angry, socially-awkward boy cuts himself (If you're not gifted, you're just weird). Other themes have been explored before  and better  such as those of loneliness, physical ailment, depression, the meaning of success and how theres no mathematical formula for love (ugh). What Matthews nails is the ending. In fear of spoiling it, Ill just say that, instead of the usual victory you get in such films, there is another one, infinitely more powerful, involving two hands connecting over a cars stick-shift.

In Britain you get The Full Monty and The Theory of Everything. In the United States, Land of the Underdog, filmmakers clone the uplifting plot over and over: A Beautiful Mind, Dead Poets Society, The Emperors Club and Good Will Hunting, just to name a few. At one point in Mathews film, a fellow young mathematician tells Nathan, were painstakingly average. A Brilliant Young Mind comes close to that definition, but  by a hair  progresses to the finals.",1453334400,,5829,5.268608414239482
7431829,5,B0159OSRNI,A great representation of the difficulties of having aspergers as well as the brilliance. Asa Butterfield did an excellent acting job.,1449964800,2,134,5.428571428571429
7431830,3,B0159OSRNI,"Morgan Matthews' A Brilliant Young Mind (formerly X + Y) is a film full of equations, calculations, and math formulas 99% of the world could never crack. In a way it's like a smaller scaled cousin of The Theory of Everything or The Imitation Game, centering on a young genius whose incredible intellect has set him outside of society's norm. While figuring out how to solve a complicated numerical problem requires very specific steps, finding the right emotional formula is less exact but can be surprisingly rewarding.

Asa Butterfield plays Nathan, an unusually gifted boy, obsessed with patterns, numbers, and finding the order in all things. We come to figure out early on that he's ""on the spectrum"", showing signs of Autism, and it poses a unique challenge to his blue collar parents, Julie (Sally Hawkins) and Michael (Martin McCann). Nathan's social awkwardness manifests in long periods of withdrawn silence, but his father finds ways to get the boy to open up, mostly by being silly and sticking French fries up his nose. But one day an accident takes Michael away, and disrupts the order that is Nathan's life in a way he can never understand.

With his mother burdened by loneliness and unable to communicate with her son, Nathan's intellectual needs are filled by professor Martin Humphreys (Rafe Spall), a pot smoking former math Olympian with multiple sclerosis. It doesn't take him long to see Nathan's full potential, and enrolls him in the International Math Olympiad tryouts in Taiwan, where his world is thrown upside down once again.

After a painfully slow start, the film really opens up just as Nathan's world begins to open up to new possibilities. While his ability to decipher near-impossible patterns is crucial, the story really focuses on Nathan's emotional needs and of the people around him. And what he needs more than anything else is companionship; a chance to be a regular boy. At home he's an oddity whose intellect causes him to shun his own mother, Youre not clever enough, he tells her at one point.  But in Taiwan among a group of equal acumen, he's considered average at best, and needs to find something new within himself to be the best. We see him bond with Zhang Mei (Jo Yang), a Chinese competitor who helps him overcome social anxieties and break out of his shell. He also learns a thing or two about dealing with bullies, and how to open up his heart to love.

While James Graham's syrupy screenplay tugs at the heartstrings a little too hard at times, this is a film that largely benefits from the outpouring of emotion. Butterfield's performance is mostly a physical one, revealing much about Nathan's fears in simple looks and cautious movements. Hawkins and Spall are magic together, and it's a credit to them and Graham's script that their story is strong enough to be a completely separate movie. Yang brightens up every scene she shares with Butterfield, and Eddie Marsan provides solid comic relief as Nathan's pushy instructor.  Matthews makes up for the relatively modest size of his film with clever visual cues and splashes of color, all reflecting Nathan's mood. It's always touchy any time a film attempts to depict the realities of autism, but A Brilliant Young Mind figures out the equation is care, respect, and undeniable heart.",1443484800,25,3296,4.897849462365591
7431831,5,B0159OSRNI,"This is an excellent art house movie about Nathan (superbly played by Asa Butterfield) a socially awkward teenager and maths prodigy, who overcomes adversity and enters an international mathematics competition.

On the way, he finds love, acceptance and insight.

This is a well made film, with uniformly excellent performances, a well written and nuanced script, and sensitive direction.

The film makers have taken what could be a difficult subject (Nathan has an autistic spectrum condition) and made a sensitive, poignant, charming and appealing film which successfully blends drama and comedy to make an entertaining and rewarding experience.

What is it about?

Nathan is a teenager who struggles to connect with others, including his loving parents.

The story opens with tragedy: Nathan and his father are involved in a motor accident, in which his father is killed.

His mother Julie (an excellent performance from Sally Hawkins) tries hard to raise Nathan as a single parent, and encourages Nathan when he is discovered to be a mathematics genius.

The story then moves on to follow Nathan's participation in the International Mathematics Olympiad, exploring several themes:

- Nathan's growth in understanding of human feelings and emotions
- the competition and characters involved in an international maths contest
- the emotions felt by a mother with a demanding teenage prodigy
- the unconventional teacher who becomes Nathan's teacher and later his mother's companion
- teenage first love

This is a special movie, and a rewarding experience.",1442016000,36,1558,5.400826446280992
7431832,5,B0159OSRNI,Great movie. Totally worth watching. Contains a lot of valuable messages.,1531612800,,73,5.7272727272727275
7431833,5,B0159OSRNI,"Nathan (Asa Butterfield; Esward Baker-Cohen,as 9 year-old) is a math genius, miserably uncomfortable socially. His dad (Martin McCann) adores him, grabs him,  sticks fries up his nose (his own) to amuse him.  Then Dad dies. His fathers simply spontaneous, equalizing, loving behavior models a sort of normalizing of ones own approach to kids on the spectrum.  There are more than enough peers, et al, who will have imprinted the weird label.  Mom, winningly played by Sally Hawkins, also adores Nathan, but shes tentative, chronically apologetic and unsure.  Her behavior feels almost enabling, so obviously self-doubting and lost, fearful shell say or do the wrong thing,  that she seems to reinforce his sense of differentness, requiring special effects, which prompts his rejection of her.  Nathans math teacher (Rafe Spall), preparing him for international math competition, is fabulously irreverent, has some deficits of his own, and picks up where Dad left off, even calling him some playfully acceptable names.  Therell be more significant characters that come into Nathans life: a lovely and smart teen, Zhang Mei (Jo Yang) and Richard (Eddie Marsan), who leads the math squad to the Cambridge Olympiad.  All the acting is first-rate.  I must say that Eddie Marsan is a uniquely gifted actor.  Its sometimes hard to initially recognize him, because he so inhabits every diverse role he plays, that he feels utterly new each time. James Grahams story is fully-engaging, Morgan Mathewss direction successful, as is Danny Cohens cinematography with editing by Peter Lambert.  Martin Phippss score is just-right.  The film is well-done on all counts, with a welcome, fresh perspective.",1531612800,3,1689,5.3522727272727275

Beyond a traditional theme that like many before me have stated has been used many times, this film approaches the protagonist in a completely different light. It sheds the need to expand the talent of the protagonist no matter the cost, to make you realize that life isn't something that can be calculated or quantified, and that there is an infinite of possibilities and outcomes for every one of us.

Excellent film. Will be purchasing hard copy.",1519948800,,591,4.628571428571429

7431864,5,B0159OSRNI,"Maybe not everyone can relate, but this simple story of a brilliant and talented young person, who is also profoundly challenged in some ways, and how he finds his priorities and his humanity... well, it really struck a chord with me. In truth, I think it's a universal story. Who hasn't felt like they were better at something than their immediate milieu? Who hasn't felt like they just didn't understand how people around them were operating, at one time or another? And who hasn't wanted, in this turbulence of feelings of inadequacy or dismissiveness, to simply be liked? While dealing with all his difficulties and differences, the protagonist and his family discover the great significance of what connects him to the rest of humanity, instead of just that which separates, devalues, or elevates (depending on one's perspective) him from them. A memorable film, and one that I think portrays some sides of life on the spectrum accurately. Apart from the story, the film is well executed. Asa Butterfield's performance is believable and engaging, probably more impressive in that it's portraying an individual with a different (and sometimes limited) manner of engaging his feelings, and Sally Hawkins is very moving as the long-suffering, bewildered, hurting, hopeful mother. Highly recommended for those who have patience to watch a beautiful, human, imperfect story about an imperfect, beautiful human develop.",1511308800,6,1418,5.278761061946903

It stars a talented young actor, Asa Butterfield, as a math genius who also has a diagnosis of autism. I've seen him in a couple of other movies but I think this part is his breakout role. He tackles the awkwardness of being in a different environment with strangers incredibly well while always maintaining his character's flaws. He gives a realistic portrayal of a young man trying to cope with his broadening scope of people in his life and the confusion that accompanies his growth as human being.
A number of movies have come along trying to dramatize different mental health diagnosis and only a few really hit their mark. Most end up being characatures of people who have diagnoses of mental health and/or developmental disabilities. There are a few exceptions and thankfully this is one.
My career was working with children and adults within this population. This movie made me sad, happy, angry, and hopeful. It takes its time establishing relationships but it is time worth spending.
I won't give away anything because that would take the enjoyment out of watching.

scared me to death, Hugo, Ender's Game and others. This boy, young man is becoming a very versatile actor, adapting his person to the
part he is playing. Johnny Depp does this, Tom Cruise does not. The latter simply plays himself in every movie, Depp, however is a different
person in each movie. Butterfield is becoming very Depp-like. In Ender's Game he was strong, almost headstrong. He was a leader, proud
and forceful. His hidden secret (killing off a sentient species) hidden inside. Brilliant Young Mind shows a quiet introverted young man,
very un-Ender like. He is a savant, almost autistic with a secret to learn. Butterfield is a star in the making and a young person to watch.

7431968,4,B0159OSRNI,"I really enjoyed this movie, but must note that it's really for adults, due to a fair amount of language, and some recreational drug use.
That said, Asa Butterfield was remarkable in this, as was the rest of the cast.  The story is heart-rending from the perspective of the special-needs child (""Nathan's"" diagnosis was complex...autism + at least one other illness, as I recall) as well as that of his parents, tutors, peers, and society in general as they interacted with Nathan.
The story gave me a better understanding of this kind of handicap, and increased my compassion for all who deal with handicaps that aren't physically visible.
If you have a love for others, and want to better understand the workings of the mind (and heart) of an autistic child, and the challenges faced by family and community who long to interface with that child, ""A Brilliant Young Mind"" may give some insight.  It's not a documentary, however, but a drama, and should probably be taken as such.  I didn't watch it to learn; I chose it because I thought it would be entertaining - an interesting story.  It was, and I feel that I learned from it as well.
I highly recommend this movie for adults.",1483747200,2,1182,4.668269230769231

I, the adult, skipped bits here and there because it was just too long and I really wanted to know how it ends.  But, there are many effective scenes (the character Luke, and how it develops, is excellent).

Know that that English have no problem throwing a bunch of ""f-words"" and occasional nudity into an otherwise family drama.  They are rare, but sudden and without warning.  Sadly, a number of films that are both good for my child to experience and that he'd enjoy are riddled with such, making choosing it a toss-up.

7432340,5,B0159OSRNI,"This was written, complete with a love story, in a way that was charmingly innocent and very compelling. The story begins with the childhood loss of his father which creates a 'does not compute' mental block that defeats years of preparation for an international math competition right at the critical juncture of the contest itself. During the final preparation for the contest he is paired up with a girl prodigy that is certainly his equal. Will his new love create resolution for his newly reconstituted family and complicated mental landscape?",1478649600,,548,5.1

The movie is insightful, and compelling, while staying true to the conditions of autism reality. The autistic spectrum is hinted at with some of the gifted people the main character is grouped in with, but here too he has problems. Autistic people can't process emotional stimulus well, but their brains are pre-wired to handle analytical idea of music, maths, and memory well.

I was unaware of the original version which came out a few years ago and I am glad I found this among the new prime movies.

Nathan, (Asa Butterfield) as the autistic math prodigy, expresses ably this dichotomy between an overdeveloped brain and an underdeveloped heart. His immediate circle--his mother and his private tutor with MS, both of them plagued by their own deep-seated insecurities, seem unable to make Nathan break through his social isolation. It is another combination of people--a Chinese math contestant who gets to love him, and memories of his dead father who made him laugh--that finally bring him to an emotional rebalancing act.

7432454,5,B0159OSRNI,"This is a cautionary tale about progressing in mathematics (and with other activities as well).  The main character is drawn to focus on mathematics, and eventually is able to enter a prestigious competition involving young  people like himself.  However, because of distracting and disturbing incidents in his life, he lacks stability and focus.  The result is a lot of inconsistency, and he actually leaves the competition in progress due to these disturbances.  The need for focus and stability in our lives is sometimes paramount to our success.  However, people are subject to many factors beyond their control, and, as we see from this movie, even a highly skilled, dedicated and motivated person for the type of competition depicted is by no means guaranteed success.  The movie demonstrated this in several ways, but I was especially impressed with the enormous stress in the math competition the young people were preparing for, the extreme competition, and the need to acquire an extremely high skill level by study over a period of years.  The movie, overall, presents people, not just this character, trying hard, struggling with motivation, and trying to accept hard realities, when we are faced with difficult tasks, not simply competitions.  This then, is a movie about acceptance of our lives, as they are, in a world that can be far from ideal.  Thus, this is more than just a movie about a competition, it is also about the human condition itself.  It is an inspiring movie about courage.",1473033600,,1506,5.032258064516129

7432483,1,B0159OSRNI,"This movie was featured on MAA site in the context of a talent search. After watching the part they posted, thought would be a good inspiration for my own little math ""wiz"". Wishful thinking.
As a child, I participated in math competitions, and would had never thought that a movie related to it would also include drugs, sex, profanity. My child was in shock, and I had to explain that ALL kids, without any exception, I met as a child and taught as a teacher, those who truly loved math were NEVER mean, sarcastic and competitive over the edge as some characters in this movie. Many of these kids, whether autistic or not, would indeed appear having some degree of social impairment, though mostly because of their own choice between popularity and specific scientific topic that appealed to them more than popularity. They did not have capacity to be concerned about being popular, nor how to be mean to others.
Though I had never heard of a child who worked hard for IMO and then simply stood up and left, suppose such situation is possible, yet VERY rare and hardly should be depicted under such title.",1457395200,3,1107,4.653061224489796

7432488,5,B0159OSRNI,"Butteerfield is great for the part.  Even the math seems real.  The film stereotypes young mathematicians a bit--you know, a touch of autism, e.g.,-- but maybe there is more truth in that stereotype than is often admitted.  Unfortunately, the script never got around to suggesting why math is such a mountaintop experience for those who do it.  Furthermore, what is that mountaintop like?

This movie is heart warming, and yes, I cried.

7432503,4,B0159OSRNI,"Being a British made film, I was not familiar with this movie other than the trailer.  Although this movie starts a bit slowly and has its slow moments, this is a very nicely done movie depicting the social awkwardness of growing up as someone who has a form of autism.

Butterfield does a believable portrayal of Nathan, who is brilliant with math but lacking in other social skills.  In some ways this movie reminds me of others such as a Brilliant Mind, as it follows a similar formula in its story and although I won't say it is as well done as some of those other movies, this movie is likeable and the story is entertaining with its sweet teenage love story that enables Nathan to find something within himself that forces him to adapt to something other than his familiar math formulas.

Jo Yang as Zhang Mei, the rival from the Chinese team, was both sweet and adorable and brilliantly played as the girl who helps Nathan find his way.

At times the movie lacks a bit of focus with certain elements of the story and sometimes gets a bit lost in the complexity of the math aspect of the story but this movie, although not perfect, has its charm that makes it a worthwhile watch.
