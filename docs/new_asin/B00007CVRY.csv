7975271,3,B00007CVRY,"It is an ok movie, got it because some of the actors went on to have bigger carrers.  Has your typical drug underground theme.  Also bought is becasuse it was filmed where I live.",1365465600,,179,4.235294117647059
7975272,2,B00007CVRY,"I suppose meeting the cast and crew of this film in LV, NV was informative and entertaining but that doesn't excuse the obvious failings of this film. First, as another reviewer mentioned, the boom should get co-starring credit and the focus and lighting was all over the place. I half-expected a furious Steve Buscemi to appear, yelling ""Cut!"" (see DiCillo's ""Living In Oblivion""). Given the script's staleness and unoriginality (a fat guy named Tiny? a silly motel clerk?), the acting was relatively fine - notably Doyle. There were a few amusing moments, I'll give it that. (note to writer/director: do a comedy next time - leave the indie suspense and crime flix to others). Otherwise, an unremarkable film, which is unfortunate as I really wanted to enjoy it since writer/director/producers (all amiable guys) were gracious enough to let me hang out for a day while they filmed in my old home county of SLO - the reason for the two-star rating. Rent it, if you must, but it really has very little to do with raves, if that's what you're looking for.",1044576000,2,1054,4.7967032967032965
7975273,4,B00007CVRY,"I liked this film, I think it could have been better in areas. But as a whole it was done well. I am a film student and just finished a short, I can't even fathom shooting this feature. I also heard it was made for $50,000 not $400,000. If that is the case, what this filmmaker did for the money is on the same talent as what Robert Rodriguez did with ""El Mariachi"". If you can look past a boom shadow here and there and focus on the guts of the film, you will enjoy it.  It is a very COOL film and if you don't get that, you will not understand it. I have read that people thoght the dialoge was cheesy. I beg to differ, the movie does have a cheesy line every so often, but the charaters make fun of them.  Worth the rent, I bought it. Can't wait to see what this filmaker is going to do next.",1043971200,3,795,3.9012345679012346
7975274,5,B00007CVRY,"I saw it, it was cool. I would tell my friends to see.  Probably not my grandma.  You should dig it.",1043452800,4,100,3.7142857142857144
7975275,1,B00007CVRY,"There is no doubt the effort is there and for some of the first features I've seen from so-called up-and-coming directors recently this isn't bad.  In fact, with a tighter script, photography (lack of focus and boom in the shots are just NOT acceptable) and better acting this could have been a sleeper hit.
But unfortunatly, thats like saying with better acting, shooting and scripting Plan 9 could have been Citizen Cane.  This film was obviously trying to mimic the likes of Doug Liman and good ol' Quentin.  But the final cut is just to amaturish to be compared with either of the two.  The writing is shallow, callow and wooden.  The characters we've all seen before, acted better and written better.
I'm sorry to have to crush frist-time director Chirs Mazzei's spirit, but the reason for this bad review is mostly lack of talent on his part.  He makes the mistake most young untalented filmmakers make in trying to mimic the style of previous celebrated filmmakers by mixing nihlism with humanism (in this case right in the wretched dialogue).  They fail to see that humanism is found in nihilism and thus, the scripts fall flat and wind up detaching the audience.  For how is an audience supposed to accept characters who don't know themselves?
I can't say I recommed this film to anyone.  This film is an example of where independant cinema is headed if young, under-educated directors are consistantly allowed by financiers to make their drivel.",1043193600,,1455,4.834677419354839
