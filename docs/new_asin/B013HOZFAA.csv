8727745,4,B013HOZFAA,"These people are barbaric and from the dark ages. They don't deserve to be treated like third world wackos, they are true evil barbarians from the dark ages. The whole ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Taliban are part of the slowest offensive in history. They are still after the infidels who destroyed most of their culture and religious infrastructure in the Dark Ages. This super slow offensive goes back to days when a call to arms by Pope Urban II who was responding to a request for military support for the Byzantine Empire started trying to stop the westward migrating Turks in Anatolia; sound familiar? The lack of an omnipotent leader, like other religions have, confounds finding a solution. If the Catholics went Dark Age barbaric and started beheading people and advocating other horrible acts against mankind, world leaders would contact the Vatican and Pope in short order and straighten things out. Since the Muslims don't have a clear leader to deal with they will just keep up the death and destruction until they are stopped. This is some bleak insight into an ISIS component of Islam that have a blood lust and no clear, reasonable,realistic, goals or objectives. These people enjoy what they do and they shouldn't. Mankind and civilization have advanced way past the space and time ISIS inhabits.",1463702400,,1300,4.967889908256881

Tonight on Frontline, they live under the veil in fear.  With undercover footage, Frontline shows the Islamic States brutal treatment of women and follows an underground network helping them escape.

The above is what the narrator says at the beginning of this stunning documentary by Frontline.  Frontline is a critically-acclaimed, award-winning public affairs television program that produces and broadcasts in-depth documentaries about various subjects.

This episode of Frontline was televised on July 14, 2015.

A warning message is given to the viewer before the actual film begins.  It states that tonights program contains graphic imagery and descriptions of violence.  Viewer discretion is advised.

In this documentary, we get to actually see the plight of women and children who belong to a religious minority (called the Yazidis). They have been targeted by ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, a terrorist organization) for especially brutal treatment.  What ISIS is attempting to do is to impose on this religious minority its own interpretation of a pure version of Islam (the second largest religion by number in the world) which includes harsh restrictions on women.

We get to see a former Iraqi lawyer, who leads the effort to rescue both women and children taken captive by ISIS.  As well, there is a young Syrian who heads another group against ISIS.  Instead of smuggling out women and children, his group instead smuggles out undercover film footage.  It is this footage that provides a gripping look inside the brutal reign of ISIS.

Finally, were told by the narrator that the fighting in Syria and Iraq has created the largest refugee crisis since the Second World War and the Yazidis have been particularly effected.  With ISIS continuing to seize and hold territory, the situation as depicted in this documentary will only get worse.

In conclusion, this documentary provides first-hand accounts of woman and children who have escaped the capture and enslavement of ISIS!!

(2015;  53 min excluding end material and end credits;  wide screen;  PBS)

8727748,5,B013HOZFAA,Shadows a guy who aspires to rescue females of a minority sect that have been abducted. The capturers say a nine-year-old is alright to have a relationship with according to their religion. One gal appears to have PTSD upon her return. What appears to be the beginning of a stoning is shown. Insightful and sickening. Difficult to comprehend.,1454630400,,342,4.913793103448276
8727749,5,B013HOZFAA,"They interview a young female who claims that she has to keep brushing her mouth constantly since she can recall when ISIS soldiers kept rapping her day after day, time after time where she could still taste their dirty breath in her mouth even after being freed. When they interviewed the individual who kept putting his life in danger to rescue these girls and families, he said his hope was to allow the world to see the cruelty of ISIS so hopefully he could get some help. Probably it would help to show those people that rape is a common act everywhere in the world even in the most civilized societies where they allow individuals like Cosby or Catholic priests commit such acts without facing any punishment. Rape is an act that recognizes no boundaries. Many use every tool that they have to justify their sickening act through some faith or nonsense logic but there is no solution for such act with criminals in middle East who chose to push their agenda by their dirty acts regardless. Wish those unfortunate individuals health and happiness.",1438819200,4,1052,4.7228260869565215
