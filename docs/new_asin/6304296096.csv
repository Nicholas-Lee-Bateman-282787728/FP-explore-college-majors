about this movie. Highly recommended!",1407196800,,149,5.0
8243971,5,6304296096,"I first watched this movie few years ago with my best friend. We both loved it and looked for it everywhere until we finally found it here on Amazon.com.

This movie is pretty much a lesbian/friendship/thriller movie and the lesbian subject is not very strong. I totally enjoyed it, it's got a little bit of everything together: drama, murder, sex, investigation, suspense and it keeps you wondering who the murderer is until the last minute... and the funny thing is, you'd never imagine who it is! wow!

This movie keeps being one of my and my best friend's favorite movie! it's a shame it's not so popular and they don't have it on DVD, but it's a great movie.",1163376000,7,663,4.563025210084033
