1992160,5,B0001DMXCE,I started my pratice in a yoga studio which was great.  I wanted to take my practice further and felt I needed alittle more detail than what the yoga class instructor could offer in a large class.  This DVD was perfect and it gave me lots of insight on how to correctly perform the asanas.  I especially like the two sessions included in the DVD-one instruction session and one practice session.,1095292800,5,395,4.535211267605634
1992161,4,B0001DMXCE,"Clear in depth focus on the basic asanas: Sun Salutation A&B, followed by Warriors I and II and final Triangle pose.  Natasha explains very thoroughly what to look out for and feel in your body; along with working at your pace.  The chalk drawings demonstrate further what each asana should bring forward in your body for optimum benefits.  Super training DVD for teachers and the new to yoga students.",1094515200,5,402,4.797101449275362
1992162,3,B0001DMXCE,"Though I did yoga briefly years ago, I've forgotten most of what I learned then from Richard Hittleman. Today, I exercise regularly, but find myself physically inflexible and uncoordinated. I thought yoga would help, and I've been working with DVDs for a while. While I think the instructional material in this DVD is very  complete, the routine it teaches is way too hard for me. The flowing workout is hard to keep up with, and some of the combinations are extremely challenging. It's often tough to perform the combinations and watch the screen to see what's next. The pace of the instruction is very brisk. I often find myself rewinding review sections of the presentation. In addition, Natasha Rizopoulos uses the Sanscrit and English names for poses interchangeably, and I have trouble knowing what she's talking about. In general, this video presents more information than a beginner can reasonably absorb quickly, and I don't think it is a good first choice for a beginner.",1093824000,17,981,4.9817073170731705
1992163,5,B0001DMXCE,"About four months ago I began taking yoga classes and discovered how reqarding and challenging yoga can be.  I also realized my body was very weak and a full 1 hour session in class was difficult for me.  So I picked up the Yoga Journal:  Step by Step series of discs and found what I needed to practice at home.  The DVDs provide expert/detailed instructions for each yoga pose, the option to follow along to modified poses, and an easy to follow sequence of standard poses.  I was able to go back and refine my posture and breath for each pose and the vinyasa.  In doing so I built up the strength I needed.

Although I bought all three DVDs at once, I spent a couple weeks on Session 1 before I moved to the Session 2 DVD and then another couple weeks before using Session 3.  Now I use all the DVDs together for a longer yoga practice.  That leads me to my only complaint; it would be great if there was a way to combine the sessions without having to stop one DVD and then start another.

I have viewed a few other ""beginner"" tapes and DVDs that provided the basic beginner poses, but the instructions were lacking in detail or non-existant.  That is not the case with this series.",1093305600,4,1186,4.297297297297297
1992164,5,B0001DMXCE,"I became an instant devotee when I first saw Natasha in action. I'm usually not one for fitness videos, but when a friend insisted on having me watch Step by Step, I was instantly hooked and bought it for myself.

I've attended yoga classes for years, but I didn't realize how much I still had to learn about the basic poses until I saw and heard Natasha's instruction.  I've been recommending this video to all my family members and friends - especially the ones who have never before practiced yoga.  To me, the Step by Step series seems like the perfect way for a beginner to precisely learn the basic poses, and at home with privacy.

Not only is Natasha supportive and graceful to watch, but you can watch her assistant modify each pose - a huge benefit for someone like me with shoulder pain and tight hamstrings.  In fact, everyone who thinks they can't practice yoga because of body pain will be thrilled to learn they can modify the poses and still get huge benefit from it.  And, there's tons of other helpful content on the DVD.  In one section, a doctor talks about the medical benefits we derive from doing each pose as Natasha is demonstrating the poses.  I knew yoga was good for me, but now I know WHY it's good for me!

If you couldn't tell, I'm really excited about these DVDs -- series 2 & 3 are just as good and maybe even better!  Yoga Journal puts out the series and, if you've seen the magazine (it's been around for umpteen years), you know you can trust them with all your yoga needs.  Enjoy!",1091923200,4,1517,4.401433691756273
1992165,5,B0001DMXCE,"I love this video and I love the entire series.. Great instructor,great instruction, it takes the time to teach you each move, what the name means, little tips about the poses and how not to do each pose.. if you have never done yoga this is a great video.",1088035200,17,256,4.244897959183674
1992186,5,B0001DMXCE,"This whole series is a great set to have in your collection.  If you are doing some type of beginner yoga dvd that is doing the poses without power and are ready to move to the next level, then this is the series for you.  It will go through the entire routine step-by-step (as the title says) showing various levels of doing each pose and then there is a follow-on routine (shorter in length) that does the whole routine of what was covered in a nice flow in about a 20 to 25 minute routine.",1153008000,6,492,4.168421052631579
1992187,5,B0001DMXCE,"I agree with Rebecca's Spotlight review.

I'm an intermediate practitioner, and I love this series.  Out of all the yoga DVDs in my library, this series is used most frequently along with DVDs by Shiva Rea and Bryan Kest.  It's basic enough for the beginner and excellent for those of us who would like to keep our foundation strong while experimenting with more advanced poses.  Whenever someone asks for a good DVD to start out with, I always recommend this one.",1147305600,8,464,4.691358024691358
1992188,5,B0001DMXCE,"If you are looking to begin a home practice or supplement a studio practice at home, this is definitely one of the best-if not THE best. Natasha Rizopoulos walks you through the poses step-by-step, explaining how to perform the pose and providing alternate versions if you are not able to do the full pose. There is an option to review each pose separately, and to do the entire sequence with or without music or instruction. The music is nice, and the poses are ""do-able"" for beginners, unlike many other ""beginning"" yoga DVDs. In all, I think this is the perfect intro to the practice, and one that you will actually use and feel very comfortable with and not intimidated by too many ""pretzel"" poses or a too-fast sequence of poses.",1139788800,7,734,4.653846153846154
1992189,5,B0001DMXCE,"What I liked best about this DVD was enough information to really get the Sun Salute right. The instructions were very clear and smoothly repeated so that I gained confidence in the moves. Compared to a class where the teacher keeps on going, the DVD let you pause and go to a ""chalk talk"" to review moves and common mistakes, then you could return to the practice. There was also a session of the practice with a doctor explaining the plusses of the program - that was nice and motivational.

With the confidence in poses from this DVD, I feel that I have better form and breath control in real classes or even practicing on my own.",1117238400,6,633,4.410256410256411
1992190,2,B0001DMXCE,"I was not happy with this workout, which was disappointing because it was more expensive than most DVDs.  I found it difficult to follow, especially where many of the positions were at an angle that I could not see the TV screen.  And personally, I didn't care for the very serious tone of the DVD.  The Yoga language was all a bit much for me.  And I felt that the same combination was done over and over again.  This DVD would be better suited for someone with at least some yoga background and someone who is very serious about getting into the practice of yoga.  I guess I was looking more for something that just focused on stretching and lengthening with a bit of Yoga mixed in.  Karen Voight's Yoga Sculpt was more what I was looking for.",1116892800,11,745,4.355072463768116
1992191,5,B0001DMXCE,"Yoga can help you fully relax and prepare for meditation or just feel more relaxed while reading or cooking. Your mind will be cleansed and while the world surges around you in all directions, there will be an inner calm you can carry with you all day.

While this DVD may seem to be for absolute beginners, it seems to be more for students of yoga who want to ""begin"" their own home practice. Yes, you can follow the instructions if you are an absolute beginner because there are variations if you are just starting yoga. I'd consider myself to be intermediate and the workout on this DVD completely heated my body and was challenging at places.

Natasha Rizopoulos has a beautiful teaching style that allows you to fully experience the body mind connection. She encourages you to experience yoga in order to balance your life. After watching her Yoga demonstration you may start to think of Yoga as an art form and not just an exercise routine. She turns yoga into ballet and her upper body strength is astounding.

This DVD has interesting menu options. There are really two main parts:

A 35 minute Instruction Session - You explore the postures in depth
20 minutes of uninterrupted flowing practice

You can follow the Instruction Menu, Practice Menu, go straight to the Yoga Chalk Talk (a great way to explore the poses) or Medical Commentary. The Practice menu has four sections:

Begin Practice (Different from Begin Instruction)
Follow Jason - This is an excellent option if you want to use props like blocks.
Practice with Medical Commentary - A discussion of the nervous systems of the body and why stress hormones can affect your immune system.
Practice without Music

If you are completely new to Yoga, you might want to start with the ""Begin Instruction"" for the first few days (so your wrists get used to the poses) and then move on to the Begin Practice or practice along with the Chalk Talk to master the poses.

Natasha Rizopoulos teaches you about ujjayi breathing, then teaches you how to move skillfully into downward-facing dog, cobra, upward-facing dog, simple cross-legged pose, chair pose, plank, warrior I, warrior II and extended (right) angle pose.

This is the first DVD in a series of three high-quality yoga packages. You will need blocks and a mat for the first practice session. The orange mats, rich wood furniture, lamps, sage walls, sun filtering through lavender shades and a beautiful wood floor make this a beautiful and inspiring space in which to develop your own home practice.

I can highly recommend this DVD and the entire Yoga Journal's Yoga Step By Step series to beginners (if they follow the initial modifications) and intermediate students (if they want a flowing practice session to warm and energize their bodies). Advanced students may enjoy this as a refresher course. Even after years of yoga practice, it is exciting to find out there is so much more to learn. This is a must-have series for
anyone who is interested in yoga.

1992192,4,B0001DMXCE,"If you've never done ""power"" yoga before this will definetly give you in depth instruction on breathing and posture.  <br />
They show decent modifications for beginners with yoga blocks, although I couldn't tell if the blocks were used when you went from downward dog to cobra.<br />
I wish it had been labeled more clearly about the Ashtanga vinyasa style of yoga taught because I was looking for something that also had meditation too.<br />
It is definetly a good buy if you're mostly fit and want a beginners yoga DVD.",1100476800,11,523,4.684782608695652
1992193,3,B0001DMXCE,"Since this program is marketed as yoga for beginners, I thought it would help me develop a practice of my own. Unfortunately, it didn't work that way: Even though variations are shown, most of the poses here are very challenging if you're starting from Square One (i.e., being completely out of shape and out of practice). Also, the program's WAY to fast-paced to follow if you're out of shape. That said, if you're IN shape, you could get a lot out of this program.",1098921600,16,466,4.559523809523809
1992194,5,B0001DMXCE,"This yoga DVD was exactly what I've been looking for.  Having just begun doing yoga about 6 weeks ago, I wanted to have a video that I could use in between my classes.  Being cautious about just buying any DVD, I decided to try this one.  And I'm glad that I did.  Natasha was wonderful.  I did the instruction segment first then moved into the practice segment.  The practice segment is perfect for an early morning routine.  I found her to be easy to understand and follow and she was not boring nor slow.  I'm definitely looking forward to trying the other 2 DVDs in this series.",1098489600,5,582,4.373831775700935
1992195,5,B0001DMXCE,"If you're a beginner and need a ""first tape"", I suggest this one.  Natasha Rizopoulos is a great teacher: very specific, yet very understanding and forgiving of beginners.  The DVD has all sorts of added value showing how to modify the exercises if you're a beginner.  The medical commentary points out potential issues to be aware of as a beginner.  You can get the whole three volume set if you're feeling flush, but you can start with just the first one and see if you like it. (That's what I did)  This is a great and inspired DVD.  I just wish Natasha taught class in NYC so I could work with her directly. Hint, hint, Natasha!",1098403200,5,632,4.405172413793103

8010813,1,B0001DMXCE,"I am a beginner and have never done yoga. This DVD is not for me.
The instructor moves at a fast pace. I had to keep rewinding. She does have a calm, soothing voice but when she speaks, she does not open her mouth so it sounds like mumbling to me. The camera is at a bad angle, right up close to her (in order to squeeze in her assistants in the background) so I had a very difficult time seeing what's she is doing.
In short, she moves fast, she mumbles, and I can't catch everything she does.",1350777600,,494,4.0

I have a double fusion in my neck and a single fusion in my lumbar spine.  I had a physical therapist turn me on to simple yoga to help align my spine and strengthen my core, and a friend of mine pointed me to Natasha to help me continue.  She has been a blessing.

I appreciate that it takes the time to explain form, but even with that then I found it very difficult to actually follow through on the form.  My husband was watching me nearby and even when I thought I had good form then I apparently did not.

8010816,5,B0001DMXCE,"I really love this dvd!  I needed a yoga tape that was very basic - like remedial beginners.  Although, this is a beginners dvd, there is a section called instruction that shows the yoga positions that will be used in the actual practice.  I used this section to get me started since I am very out of shape.  With a little modification (which they show you how to do) I was able to recreate the yoga positions.  I used this section for about 2 weeks to get comfortable with them and build up some stamina, then moved on to the practice portion of the dvd.  Even though this is beginner level, it will definitely work your butt off!  I sweat like a pig every time and was sore for the first week, but I am gradually getting better at it.  This dvd was exactly what I was looking for and I will buy the next two dvds in the series when I am ready for them.",1283212800,,854,4.102409638554217

8010818,3,B0001DMXCE,"Rebecca Johnson wrote a great review. The instruction & detail is great in here, the extras have a quick ""chalk outline"" that shows the most popular wrong things people do such as letting their head fall into their shoulder in triangle pose that I found concise & succinct & informative.
Natasha has great strength, flexibility & does move like a ballerina almost during her demonstration, but still looked stiff with little body awareness of energy.
I did find the video to be too stiff for me, the instruction didn't flow and felt very long & boring. Many other people will enjoy this, but I felt it was disjointed.. some it flowed fast with stiff instruction, other parts were more like a lecture so you'd move fast, stop & watch, move fast.... The extra by having the doctor talk about the medical benefits of yoga really killed me in monotony. I learned better benefits from Wai Lana & others stated below.
I did learn a few things when she was using Autumn as a model, but during the movement practice part, I didn't learn anything I didn't already learn through Gaiam's Rodney Yee, Susan Deason, Rainbeau Mars, Seane Corn (great detailed instruction, better analogies, more flow, etc.)
I find it surprising someone had issue with using the original Sanscrit names. The words are written, and the English names are used as well to make the connection. I am sadden when true artistry, body awareness & mind/body connection intentions are destroyed so that people who have no desire or believe in learning the beauty above can demand the watered down version which is barely a reflection of the true craft, can say they practice that system too to seem cool & the true immensely knowledgeable intentions of the craft are lost through the years.

A very advanced student would probably get bored but if you want an introduction or review to sun salutations or just a quick routine this is great.,1193184000,,444,4.5125
