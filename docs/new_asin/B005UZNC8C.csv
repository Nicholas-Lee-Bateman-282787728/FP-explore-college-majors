4896126,5,B005UZNC8C,"I have been a Busby fan since I first saw his productions on TV back in the 50s.  This one I had never seen until it became available on DVD.  Dissappointingly it has only one BB number...""Spin a Little Web of Dreams"".

Bette Davis in a BB musical?  Well...yes and it only goes to show the versatility of this great actress.  This is an e-z going movie that is fun to watch and fortunately, my wife enjoys BBs movies as well.  Own it...you won't be sorry.",1359676800,5,455,4.232558139534884
4896127,4,B005UZNC8C,"Classic film buffs that you and I are, we're so used to seeing Bette Davis as this powerhouse dramatic actress that we tend to blink whenever one of her old (and rare) comedy ventures hits the screen. I admire her fire and steeliness, but I really get a kick out of those moments in which she lets her hair down. I think I've seen most, if not all, of her more frivolous efforts, from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jimmy-The-Gent-Remaster/dp/B0046CM8VW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jimmy The Gent (Remaster)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bride-Came-C-O-D/dp/B000MTEFW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bride Came C.O.D.</a>&nbsp;(both with James Cagney) to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Arrow/dp/B003UBLKTG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Arrow</a>&nbsp;(with her frequent cinematic partner George Brent). My two cents is that her three best comedies are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-Who-Came-to-Dinner/dp/B000EU1Q1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man Who Came to Dinner</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-Love-I-m-After/dp/B002KE4ZIC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's Love I'm After</a>&nbsp;(with Leslie Howard and Olivia de Havilland), and JUNE BRIDE (with Robert Montgomery). And then there's FASHIONS OF 1934, which features her only pairing up with my favorite all-time actor, William Powell. It's a comedy I rate 3.5 out of 5 stars. The plot is a bit hackneyed, the sort of plot of which elements, during that era, were purloined heaps of times. And yet the presence of Powell and Davis makes the thing watchable and, at times, even sparkle.

It says something about William Powell's unflappable, man-of-the-world temperament that he rolls with it when his office furniture is suddenly repossessed, leaving his current shady enterprise in a lurch. Powell plays dapper New Yorker and swindler Sherwood Nash who's always eyeing a new angle. When Lynn Mason (Davis), a comely fashion designer, steps into his office, that lightbulb goes off in his head. Nash and Lynn are soon off to Paris, these two fashion bootleggers, bilking them gullible marks with stolen designs and sending the haute couture industry into a panic. Except that Nash's cons grow ever more extravagant. And when his latest scam involves a fake Duchess (Verree Teasdale) with whom he shares a past and a musical revue and the cornering of the ostrich feathers market, he may end up losing his loyal but increasingly fed-up assistant Lynn (who's only in it for the guy and not the greed).

Bette Davis, at this juncture of her career, was feeling underappreciated and marginalized. She'd been clamoring for more serious roles. She'd been stumping to be loaned out to RKO for a role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Of-Human-Bondage/dp/B00005RERS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Of Human Bondage</a>. Instead Jack Warner plonked her in FASHIONS of 1934, a decidedly less prestigious affair. Bette Davis had to endure getting made over into a glamourous platinum blonde type la Greta Garbo or Jean Harlow, a look with which she professed to have been very ill at ease. Nevertheless, onscreen, she exhibits her patented spunk and spine, making the most of her thankless role. She finds moments to shine. I love her banter with Powell, especially when they exchange fond endearments (he refers to her as his lieutenant, she gazes at him with those big, big eyes and calls him ""My Captain""). William Powell is the center of attention and he is flawless and casually urbane, predictably. It's a fun supporting cast that includes Frank McHugh (and his distinctive breathy laugh) as Nash's sidekick and Hugh Herbert as Nash's ostrich feathers financier. Busby Berkeley submits a lavish musical number or two, choreographing a wide-ranging gaggle of models who flaunt Orry-Kelly gowns as they navigate those sumptuous art-deco sets. It's too bad the tunes aren't so memorable.

Again, it's not so much about the fashion stuff or the Busby Berkeley spectacles or even the plot. It's about watching two film icons delightfully bouncing off each other. While Bette Davis was lukewarm to her role in the film, she at least must've had a riot working with William Powell, how could she not? On the scale of one to awesome, Powell was freakin' awesome. In any event, Bette Davis soon after was cast in OF HUMAN BONDAGE. And then her days of being underappreciated were forever in the rear view.",1335398400,19,4654,6.048484848484849
8487174,3,B005UZNC8C,"An amusing trifle.

Bette Davis is basically 2nd fiddle in this one, looking bored with little to do.

Worth it for the Busby Berkeley number.",1514764800,,142,4.64

8487176,5,B005UZNC8C,"One of Busby Berkeley's most controversial films.  The pre-code costumes actually reveal female navels!!!! This is the film with the ""human harps"".  The feathery costumes are quite beautifully displayed in his traditional kaleidoscopic perspective, representing opening and closing flowers. As opposed to the Golddiggers series, this is not a backstage musical with DICK Powell and ensemble, but a ""screwball comedy/musical"" with the ever sardonic WILLIAM Powell.  The appearance of a platinum blonde Bette Davis in one of her early films is certainly not Oscar quality, but then, who cares. William Powell and sidekick Frank McHugh are effective as swindlers. Hugh Herbert is very subdued as is Davis, who looks bored with the whole thing.  It is Depression Era fantasy. This film only has one musical number, but has the fashion show required by its title.",1488758400,,858,5.333333333333333
8487177,5,B005UZNC8C,Love the old Bette Davis Classics dvd plays well and meets expectations.  The dvd plays well and you can read the plot on wiki if you want to learn more.,1478736000,,153,4.1

a lot of fun t watch",1477872000,,87,3.1904761904761907
8487179,3,B005UZNC8C,cute story but could not adjust the zoom. Picture looks squashed.,1474848000,,65,5.0
8487180,5,B005UZNC8C,"Hilarious from the first scene onward!  I've become a big fan of William Powell's.  His character was ever charming even though it sorely lacked any integrity!  Though my favorite couple is William and Myrna Loy, he and Bette were good on screen together. . . who would've thought that!  Loved the art deco dcor and the fashions.  Even in couture what goes around comes around.  Though the plot is thin, I'd recommend this movie just for the hearty laughs!",1430092800,,456,4.708860759493671
8487181,5,B005UZNC8C,Just LOVE the fashions - the price of the DVD is worth it for that reason alone.  But how can any movie with both William Powell AND Bette Davis fail?  Delightful.,1426291200,,163,4.225806451612903
8487182,4,B005UZNC8C,"Not much of a story but is to watch Bette Davis as a platinum blonde, made up as Jean Harlow, as afashion designer in Paris. She and William Powell are good together",1395014400,,165,4.1875
8487183,5,B005UZNC8C,"This movie displayed what dressing up was all about.  Even though there was much more clothing on the models (unlike the models of today).  If you like ""skimpy"" cladded women, please don't order this one.  Movie was in great condition for it's age just like me.  Excellent transaction and movie was received as promised.",1393286400,,320,4.87037037037037
