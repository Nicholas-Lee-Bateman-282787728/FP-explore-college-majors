7912409,4,B00000JLUM,"This video sums up the 1998 season quite nicely.  You know a video is good when it makes a touchdownless game(Miami's 12-9 win over New England) seem exciting.  The drama on the sidelines and in the lockeroom is displayed in an exciting manner.  And how 'bout that list second hit on Doug Flutie causing the fumble that sealed the playoff win over Bufallo.  Whereas the season ended on a big time downer in Denver, this should somehow have been mentioned in the video.  None the less the highlights of Dan Marino, Zack Thomas, Oronde Gasden, Olindo Mare, and others should bruighten up the screen for any Dolphins fans out there.",973036800,,629,4.681818181818182
