8683368,5,B00OFTGKTW,"This was SO AMAZING! I am a long-time fan of the anime version of this movie done by Studio Ghibli and stumbled upon this here while looking for something else Kiki-related. I was able to find a copy that I could actually watch (with subtitles) and would LOVE LOVE LOVE it if this movie could be released either region free (DVD and/or BluRay) or at least a version for every region.

Many who have watched the anime version will be familiar with the basic story: teen witch goes out into the world on her own very bildungsroman story. It isn't an exact copy of the anime version as a live-action, the story is changed in some of its details, and is a little darker and more in-depth in the character building. The version of Timbo realized here alone was brilliant. It's like the story grew up with those of us who have loved it for so long. Yet it still has the same heart, the same essential nature that defined the anime version.

I'm going to go out on one of those limbs with the bells tied to it and say that I loved this version better, simply because it confronts and the coming-of-age story in a grounded fashion (pardon the pun). It confronts Kiki's growth as a person through a more realistic portrait of a young woman seeking acceptance and friendship in the community in which she chooses to live.",1488412800,,1311,4.435684647302905

8683370,5,B00OFTGKTW,"Excellent live action version of the popular animae.  The entire cast was chosen very well.  Especially Kiki.  Her cat was CG but was well done. The story follows Kiki after she leaves home to spend the year alone living among humans.  At the end of that year she has to decide if she chooses to be a human or a witch for the rest of her life.

Kiki's Delivery Service animae is a classic, so they couldn't afford to mess it up.  If you love the animae like I do, then this live action version will not disappoint you.  I'm critical of books to movies, animae to live action, etc. and was extremely satisfied with this version.",1426982400,4,627,4.3076923076923075
