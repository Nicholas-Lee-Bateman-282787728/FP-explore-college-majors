7991651,5,B00009MEJF,A masterpiece. Hope the person I gave it to thinks so too!,1515801600,,58,3.9166666666666665
7991652,5,B00009MEJF,Watched it several times and received more insight each time.  Teddy's line of work enabled him to read his wife quite well and he wouldn't have been surprised to see her follow him home very soon despite her enthusiasm for the new plan rthat was being offered.  That is why he was able to leave so easily.  I love Michael Jayston in anything.,1428796800,,343,4.412698412698413
7991653,5,B00009MEJF,It's a marvelous treat to have Pinter's masterpiece directed and acted this well on film. Peter Hall keeps a stylized minimalism in focus at all times.,1422230400,,151,4.846153846153846
7991654,5,B00009MEJF,"Harold Pinter's plays deal with the tension between our animal nature and our most cherished construct, 'civilization'. They reveal in step-by-step fashion the unreasoning furies that rage beneath the surface of the English class system and by extrapolation, human society in general. No etiquette is strong enough to disguise the brutish impulses of this working-class family - an animal hierarchy based on aggression, cruelty, shame and despair. Because this revelation takes place in real time, it's a visceral process and your first taste of Pinter can be an emotionally stunning, dislocating shock. That's his 'schtick', if you will - he put a human face on the stark, symbol-laden existentialism of his mentor Samuel Becket, refining it into a naturalistic style that was able to reach and shake a wide popular audience, and he was highly acclaimed for that. His work still has power, but in a way that first emotional whammy can really weaken later viewings of Pinter and I think for this reason, his reputation has already faded quite a bit from its peak. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch - especially if you've never experienced his plays before.

In answer to a question here: ""Why can't these characters find redemption?"" Pinter's people are way beyond traditional third-act 'redemption'. The closest they can come is that final scene: shattered, ravaged and numb, this alleged ""family"" shows a pathetic need for some kind of human warmth - literally, a loving touch - which may once have come from the long-gone mother but which now can only be supplied by the disturbed, self-destructive wife/mother/whore... hey, maybe there is some symbolism in there after all.

""The Homecoming"" is Pinter's best known work, but if you want another pint of bitter Pinter brew check out Joseph Losey's ""The Servant"", which may be his best screen adaptation.",1376784000,5,1864,5.128289473684211
7991655,5,B00009MEJF,"One of the reviewers despairs over this film failing to ""open up"" the play.  The play does not require ""opening up"".  What would opening up the play entail?  A joyride through London in which the brothers laugh it up while guzzling cheap wine a la The Blues Brothers?  One watches this for the beauty of the language, also, of course, because there aren't all that many revivals of this seminal play and one wants to get as close as one can to the theatrical experience.  Only one slight problem in the casting - Pinter chose his wife to play the female role. Big mistake.  The play, i would argue, needs a woman with a modicum of sexual attractiveness, not a bombshell by any means, but at least one who might get a few shillings as a working girl.  Otherwise a superlative, faithful rendition of a fine and funny play.  Those who fail to see the humor in it stick with ""Dumb and Dumber"".
  Max is played by Mr. Rogers in what is a spectacular performance, espeically considering the actor usually played uppercrust characters. Ian Holm, always a superb actor, shines in thos adaptation.",1371945600,3,1088,4.590673575129534
7991656,4,B00009MEJF,"I showed this film to a college English Literature survey class in California.  At first it was heavy going, in part because of the language, but gradually the chuckles spread among the more astute students.  Having previously read Beckett's Endgame and struggled through Eliot's The Waste Land, for the most part they were prepared for Pinter's bleak vision of mid twentieth century English family life and may have come away more appreciative of Californian mores.",1369872000,,466,5.2
7991657,1,B00009MEJF,"Watched it because a relative was in it.  Read the review line ""cried out to be made into a movie"" and somehow interpreted that to be cried out loud (Because of what I thought was humor - 3 brothers and one girl right?) Well it may have been well acted but they were miserable lot of folks",1359936000,,289,4.0701754385964914
7991658,4,B00009MEJF,"A refreshingly nasty and rarely moving chamber drama with an improbable twist. Superlative performances.

Though the cinematographer might beg to differ, nothing has been done to make this play film-like by opening it up. The ""action"" basically transpires in the confines of one large room.

The Dvd transfer lacks sharpness, though on an analogue television it should appear more than satisfactory.",1284336000,,399,5.524590163934426
7991659,4,B00009MEJF,"The Homecoming (Peter Hall, 1973)

I read Harold Pinter's play late last year, and then saw this adaptation of it crop up on a couple of thousand-best-films lists soon afterwards (for the record, they were Peter Travers' and the New York Times'). Synchronicity! I had to see it ASAP, and here we are.

If you're unfamiliar with the play, a quick synopsis: Joey (Elizabeth's Terence Rigby) and Lenny (Ian Holm), their father  Max (the gifted stage actor Paul Rogers), and Max's brother Sam (My Left Foot's Cyril Cusack) all live together in a flat in London. None of them is of a great deal of use; the one truly productive member of the family, Sam, is an insufferable prig, while the others are generally layabouts. We see them in the beginning going through their normal lives, until the other brother, Teddy (Michael Jayston) arrives for a visit with his wife Ruth (Vivien Merchant, then Pinter's wife in life). Teddy assures her a number of times that his family will like her a great deal. Then they all finally meet, and, well, things get absurd.

It's a smashing play, both straightforward and complex at the same time, both uproariously funny and possessed of a deep hopelessness at the human condition. And really, when you've got such a great play, the only thing you need to make it into a great film is a cast who can actually bring a good interpretation to the material and a director who's willing to film the thing without changing too much. Well, Hall was a stage director before he was a film director, so no problems there, and there's a top-notch cast to be had here. How can you possibly go wrong? Short answer: you can't. Has been seen by far too few people these days, and should be seen by many, many more. ****",1223596800,16,1734,4.583870967741936
7991660,5,B00009MEJF,This is a must see movie for those unfamiliar with Harold Pinter. He is a master story teller with convoluted language and plots. He will open the world of absurdest theatre to you. Next stop Samuel Beckett. Enjoy.,1156032000,9,214,4.657894736842105
