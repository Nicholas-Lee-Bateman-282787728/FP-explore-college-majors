8648837,2,B00J92CSDW,"Having enjoyed DVD's with Danielle de Niese performing as Cleopatra in Giulio Cesare, and as Poppea in L'Incoronazione di P, I was looking forward to seeing her as Norina in this production.  Unfortunately, I think she has gone too far in modifying her singing style from Baroque, to bel canto, and has gone overboard with the vibrato.

Disappointingly, I didn't find much to inspire in the performances of the other signers, either.

I also found the staging a little wooden.

After watching this Glyndebourne production I immediately ordered the Met offering with Anna Netrebko as Norina, for comparison.  I have to say that I much prefer the Met version.",1419811200,2,657,4.990825688073395
8648838,3,B00J92CSDW,"It's quite clear from the extra features of the BD release that the cast and creative team behind the 2013 Glyndebourne production of Don Pasquale are of one mind about what is the essential purpose of the work. The audience should come away from a performance of Donizetti's charming and delightful comedy feeling that they have been amused and entertained. And they are absolutely right. Don Pasquale is a very funny work, it has some amusing comedy characters and situations, some lively melodies and songs. So why then does the Glyndebourne production feel so lifeless and just plain unfunny?

Well, for a start everything feels forced. The work demands a lightness of touch from both the orchestra and from the cast. Not necessarily subtlety - you can ham-up Don Pasquale as much as you like and it can still be riotously funny - but with at least some measure of fluidity and consistency. Enrique Mazzola at least understands and projects the right tone for the work and the London Philharmonic fairly romp through the work, but the staging, the direction and a few of the the performances leave something to be desired. Many of those elements introduced in the form of props are bewildering and just plain unfunny. Characters that are witty and entertaining in their own right are inconsistent here, working against the natural humour towards a forced twist that doesn't really work.

Some good singing and comic timing can hide a multitude of sins and implausibilities in the plot, but none of them really seem to make the characters work. You would think that the bubbly and irrepressible Danielle de Niese would at least make a sparkling and bright Norina, but she looks and sounds uncomfortable in the role, her singing a little strained and the effort showing in her exaggerated actions. It might look fine in the Glyndebourne hall, but in close-up in High Definition it seems overplayed. By way of contrast Nikolay Borchev doesn't quite have enough personality or a voice big enough for the role, but he copes well with the singing and with the characterisation that he's been asked to play. Alek Shrader lovely pure tenor voice is on form here, but any impression that he might have made suffers from the lack of direction and trivialising of his role in this production. Alessandro Corbelli too is left to make what he can out of his Don Pasquale, but does so marvellously with a luxurious tone, precise enunciation and deft weighting of delivery.

These are small compensations though for the lack of real wit and humour in Mariame Cl&eacute;ment's characterisation and direction. Comic opera is difficult to carry off, but when it's done right it can be dazzlingly brilliant. Unfortunately once you've seen one such a work done really well it does colour your view and sets a standard that is hard for others to live up to. In this case of Don Pasquale, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Met-s-production/dp/B004QQDUOW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Met's production</a>&nbsp;with Anna Netrebko's Norina is a masterclass in comic opera performance. The attention to character, situation and comic timing in that production makes it all look so effortlessly easy, and emphasises just how forced and awkward the Glyndebourne one is by comparison.",1399593600,2,3302,5.156716417910448
8648839,4,B00J92CSDW,"This is a 2013 recording and blu-ray presentation of the acclaimed 2011 production from Glyndebourne. The musical values are outstanding with fine singing from all main characters and the chorus. The experienced Donizetti conductor, Enrique Mazzola, inspires the LPO to sparkling and sensitive playing and the acting is of a quality to match. As with most operas there are controversial elements and in this case such controversy will inevitably concern the nature of the sub-plot as described below.

The controversial sub-plot, not suggested in the actual plot, is that Dr. Maletesta (a close match for 'headache' in Italian), is clearly having an affair with Norina. His close physical proximity is established early on and then made blatant when he joins Norina, both clothed, in a bath filled with soap suds to imply a real bath. The end of the finale makes a point of Norina twice rejecting the attempted embrace of Ernesto and being cautioned to be more subtle by Malatesta with a warning finger held to his lips. Thus in this concept, Malatesta is not much of a friend to either Pasquale or to Ernesto but clearly self-seeking in terms of his relationship with Norina. Their joint manipulation is thus projected into the future where both Pasquale and Ernesto will be equal victims of their machinations.

This ending throws inevitable doubt upon the concluding celebratory quartet where relationships are prized above both rank and wealth and where marriage in old age is seen as unwise. providing that purchasers can accept this dark twist to the story then everything else about this disc raises the bar very high indeed.

Alessandro Corbelli is renowned for this type of role and this is not his first recorded performance. He is able to blend all the contradictions of the role seamlessly and produces a characterisation that is totally believable. His diction in the fast patter arias is extraordinarily fleet and clearly defined and leads to the only, pre-determined, encore with Malatesta. Overall he could be thought of as the leading exponent currently performing this role.

Malatesta is, as described above, cast into a very dark role of double subterfuge. Dressed in black and emotionally distanced from the other characters he becomes the arch manipulator. Nikolay Borchev carries this role off very well and is possessed of a very fine voice which places him as one of the best sung Malatestas on disc so far. He is also able to match Corbelli's skill in the fast patter song as above.

Alek Shrader as the love-lorn and rather idle Ernesto is also possessed of a notably fine voice. His good looks are an additional asset in terms of making his possible attraction to Norina more viable. He is portrayed as being a far weaker character than either Malatesta or Norina so his implied future role as cuckolded husband in this production s made feasible.

Danielle de Niese as Norina is a formidable character and characterisation. She is possessed of a flexible and powerful voice that is completely on top of the demands of the part. As a character she is more than a match for anyone and she enacts the role like a duck taking to water. This is arguably the strongest Norina yet recorded and quite a challenge to any man. She, not surprisingly, earns enormous applause from the highly enthusiastic audience.

The sets are presented on a revolving stage and imply a traditional situation. Costumes are traditional too. There is no attempt made to modernise the production. The role of the chorus, which sings and acts to perfection, is changed from gossiping servants to society 'sophisticates' appropriate to the period. This may be to underline the likelihood of a sub-plot in such a society. Their changed role does not affect the plot although they remain on stage in a tea party setting as a backdrop to the final denouement as Pasquale challenges the two lovers. Once more this is a complete deviation from an undercover night time assignation.

There are bonus interviews with the cast, conductor and the director during which the plot and the staging are explained in some detail.

The recording is exemplary with involving camera work, state of the art imaging and sound, presented in DTS-HD Master Audio as well as stereo. This is a multi-region disc with subtitles in a range of languages as is usual.

 In summary this is arguably the best musical and recorded option currently available but beware of a controversial sub-plot which will certainly not be to many tastes and seems an unnecessary deviation from the original and expected plot
