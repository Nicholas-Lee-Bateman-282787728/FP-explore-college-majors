8079042,1,B0002DVAFE,"I bought this DVD and the other one (successful strategies). There are big contrast btw them. In this DVD, the authers are always talking about something else unrelated to the film (in my point of view). The only good point is they show where they are fishing. If you really want to learn something about trout fishing, pick the other DVD.",1124928000,3,339,4.573770491803279
