8127447,1,B000FVQLXY,"I'd like to say something nice about this movie but I can't. Ronnie Burns (son of George Burns and Gracie Allen) is the biggest name in this movie. Mr. Burns plays a nice guy in this movie. His role is not the lead. The plot is unbelievable, the acting is bad, and production values cheap. You can skip this one.",1525478400,,312,4.216666666666667

8127449,2,B000FVQLXY,"Anatomy of a Psycho is an early cinematic examination of psychosis. What will an old black-&-white flick do with the criminally insane? Let's find out...

Duke, a vicious criminal, has been executed. His brother Chad maintains his innocence based on Duke's word. Chad can't even tolerate the truth from his own family. He begins plotting revenge on anyone associated with his brother's trial. When the son of the primary witness decides to marry Chad's sister, the excrement hits the oscillating unit. A fortuitous death gives Chad the perfect opportunity for the ultimate revenge.

The plot is pretty interesting in concept, particularly because Chad proves to be wily and rather vicious in his revenge plots, but ultimately ends up being forgettable. The character may be wily, but the story isn't clever enough to be truly engaging.

The characters aren't very strong, either. Poor dialogue and weak acting drag the whole thing down a good bit. At best some of the actors are tolerable, but others are downright awful.

Content:
Typical of old B&W movies there is virtually nothing questionable in this save for some of the concepts.

DVD:
I got it in a 50 pack called Night Screams. The audio is plagued by white noise with moments of bad crackling. It's distorted almost to the point of being difficult to understand. The image is very trashy and dark. There are no extras.

Other DVD options include editions by Reel Enterprises and Alpha Video. There's also a 2-pack by Vinegar Syndrome. The only one that shows any real promise is the 2-pack which has gotten some praise for its presentation quality.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
Anatomy of a Psycho isn't the worst I've ever seen which is why I give it 2*, but it's certainly nothing to get excited about. Check it out only if you really like old films and don't have to put any effort into seeing it. Vinegar Syndromes 2-pack appears to be the best bet for quality so go as cheap as possible other than that.",1496707200,,1956,4.803571428571429
8127450,4,B000FVQLXY,"This was a good movie and suspenseful as to how it would resolve.  I did not give it 5 stars because of the description of a seemingly 'secret' trial and the contrived situation involving Chet's sister Patty, her boyfriend Mickey, and Mickey's father as the eyewitness whose testimony sends Chet's brother to the gas chamber.  Chet looked up to his brother Duke, who raised him and Patty.  Chet goes crazy thinking Duke was wrongly convicted, while Patty thinks he was guilty.  The movie does a good job of establishing the growing estrangement between the two siblings.  Finally, Chet gets a golden opportunity to exact vengeance with the help of adoring acolyte Bobby.  There are some interesting dated views as Patty says she is a girl and does not need to go to school, but that her brother should.  Check it out if you like early sixties movies.",1484006400,,850,4.741496598639456
8127451,3,B000FVQLXY,I like old movies and this was a descent movie that I had to watch to the end. I would recommend watching.,1389139200,,106,3.8636363636363638
8127452,5,B000FVQLXY,I would love to have seen this on the big screen or stage. The acting reminded me of something you would see on broadway! Couldn't stop watching! I'd definitely watch it again.,1369526400,,176,4.53125
8127453,3,B000FVQLXY,"I read a few of the other reviews and was surprised. The movie is black and white and made in 1961 - a gentler time - when everyone knew that morals are not something that hangs on a museum wall. Horror movies of that era didn't tend to lean towards rape, foul language, and hacking/axing people producing lots of blood. I enjoyed the movie because I appreciated the lack of mayhem. The body language of the actors was typical of that time and so is the script. Next time you feel the need for what qualifies as a horror movie in this day and age, rent or buy one that aired in the 21st century. But if you want a movie that doesn't make you wish you hadn't eaten dinner right before watching it, check out ""Anatomy of a Psycho."" I can't imagine it would give you nightmares, but view it for what it is and what it was meant to be - don't compare it to the movies of today. I liked it and enjoyed it and didn't feel sick to my stomach not even once ... and that's a good thing!",1289088000,,977,4.067357512953368

During one of these incidents, Chet attacks Mickey (Burns) because his dad helped convict the brother. Moe (Don Devlin) comes to Chet's defense after Mickey wins the fight. He grabs a table knife, Mickey wrestles it away then Moe accidentally walks right into it! Mickey runs away. As Moe lies seriously wounded and pleads for help, Chet plunges the knife into the boy's gut right up to its hilt.

Mickey is charged with murder and because of Chet's courtroom testimony he's found guilty. But Lt. Mac (Michael Granger knows the truth and he's determined that Chet will to confess to Moe's killing.
