5181809,5,B008U0XKZO,"Stunning cinematography, beautifully done. I bawled my face off watching this wonderful telling of a story of the man who struck out and put Ethiopia's name on the map and led East Africans to dominance in long distance running. His story is beautiful, the real footage of his races interspersed with the new film was seamless and well done and added so much.

Abebe is a hero, and anyone who loves running must see it. Anyone with ties to Ethiopia MUST see it. Well acted and directed, I can't say enough about it.",1390780800,3,515,4.537634408602151

5181812,4,B008U0XKZO,"In 2009, this film was released and it took almost three years to run the festival circuit and make it to a limited release in North Hollywood, Film-Flix Festival for its short run. As their first full length feature docu-drama, writers, producers and directors Dav
ey Frankel and Rasselas Lakew (who also stars as the lead in this) this film is about the underdog, once again overcoming the odds and winning for more than himself, but principals.

Story is that of a man running the streets of Rome in the year of 1960, who was an unknown runner at the time, who ran barefooted. An Ethiopian man who stunned the world by winning Olympic gold in the marathon.

Then, overnight, Abebe Bikila became a sports legend in the annals of history. He was a true hero in his own country and to the continent and Bikila was the first African to win a gold medal, and then four years later in Tokyo would become the first person in history to win consecutive Olympic gold medals in the marathon. He was a soldier who was the quiet son of a shepherd would be acknowledged by many as the greatest long distance runner the world had ever known.

As it would happen during one evening while returning to his home in Addis Ababa from training in the Ethiopian countryside, Bikila was involved in a tragic car accident which left him paralyzed from the waist down. He became unable to walk and faced with the greatest challenge of his life, he struggled to maintain his will to live and in the process discovered a deeper meaning of competition by taking up archery for the Paralympics and competing as a handicapped dog sledder in Norway.

Even though his running career had come to a tragic end the real race of his life had a new beginning. This is the true story of Bikila's epic quest for life and sport comes to the big screen in a very dramatic way.

Overall the movie is uplifting and heartfelt with a very limited cast and even a wonderful score. A nice foreign film, subtitled in English, that will or should inspire those who feel the odds are always against them. A refreshing film of passion and honesty.",1353196800,6,2100,4.515789473684211
