8301303,5,B001F8LFU0,"This was a poignant but way too short documentary on the small town my mother grew up in and my grandfather (Earl Murray) was Mayor of for 3 terms (decades after the killings).  My Mom's best friend's Dad was one of the klansman that was involved in the violence towards blacks who were merely exercising their Constitutional rights.  This documentary is thought-provoking and should provide a glimmer of how we may or may not have come as far as we think from 1920.  My only wish was that there was more primary source material available (much of it has been hidden or destroyed) for the production and that it was at least an hour long.
