8393055,3,B003AO6FSY,So you end up getting a bunch of mediocre to forgettable stinkers to overall rather surprisingly decent or nostalgic material. Some of the stuff is barely worth it for fans of the names on the package while others will deliver beyond what they could've ever promised. Some hardcore and beginning fans will adore this set but some of the bad movies on here will leave a smile for fans of laughable premises or films you can easily heckle with pals.,1502928000,,447,4.6

8393058,5,B003AO6FSY,"20 Wild Westerns Marshals & Gunmen contains films from many of your favorite actors; John Wayne, Patrick Wayne his son, Chuck Connors and Lee Van Cleef are just a few of the great western actors you'll enjoy with this set.",1349136000,,222,4.575
8393059,5,B003AO6FSY,"Enjoyable, riveting movie set. Glad that I made the purchase and at a decent price, also. Will look for similar movie sets in this genre.",1342915200,,137,4.52
8393060,5,B003AO6FSY,"I collect many of these cheaper B and low budget or pubic domain westerns, and none of them are as good as this one.  Only a few of these movies are on numerous sets, some of them are not on any of the other sets I own.  Highlights of this set are:

Revenge of the Gunfighter--If you like Companeros you will love this one too, very similar with one of the same actors, Franco Nero.

The Young Land--Patrick Wayne, son of John Wayne stars in his first starring role with Dennie Hooper who seems to be channeling James Dean in this film. This movie is not available many places and is also about some forgotten history of smaller texas border towns after the Mexican War.

Long Live Your Death--this one is similar to Revenge of the Gunfighter, both have Franco Nero but this one also stars the great Eli Wallach and is a cross between The Good the bad and the Ugly and Companeros.  Any western with Franco Nero is going to be good.

Raiders of Old California--is a black and white western with Lee Van Cleef rarely seen in other sets. It is also about the aftermath of the Mexican War but this time in California. There is also some forgotten history in this film also.

The other films in the set are also good including:

Pioneer Woman with William Shatner another one not in most other sets.

The Proud and the Damned with Chuck Conners which is a decent movie but is  widely available.

The Proud Rebel,a very good film but widely available.

Kentucky Rifles with Chill Wills is also very good.

There are also 4 John Wayne B westerns, Sagebrush Trail being one of the standouts of those Wayne days and 2 Roy Rogers B-westerns all of which are in many other sets.

One other film that is available here I haven't seen elsewhere is called Red Blood, Yellow Gold which is also pretty good, this is a civil war story about the North and the south and their clamoring for gold.

Then There are two Trinity movies--There is a Noose for you Trinity and Trinity and Sartana are Coming.  Both of these are ok but not as good as the rest of them.

I really really love this set and the price is very right for this.  If you are a fan of westerns and spaghetti westerns it is worth it just for the Franco Nero films.  Highly Recommended.  Pick it up!",1323734400,,2244,4.346153846153846
8393061,5,B003AO6FSY,This video will bring many hours of joy to an old Cowhand and a current Oilfield worker. Many of these titles are not available anywhere else.,1304985600,3,142,4.5
8393062,3,B003AO6FSY,"This isn't so much a review as a description. With 20 movies, you know that some of them are pretty good and some aren't.

First, there are three DVDs in the package. The first two are double-sided; the third is single-sided. They come stacked on one spindle, as with other TGG sets I've purchased.

Here's what you get, along with some ratings (1-10 scale, updated March 2012) and info from IMDB, an Amazon company:

(6.1) Beyond the Law, 1968, Lee Van Cleef
(4.1) The Proud and the Damned, 1972, Chuck Connors

I bought this set mainly for the Trinity movies, but the IMDB reviews suggest that ""Trinity and Sartana"" has nothing to do the rest of the Trinity series. Oh well, for this many movies at this price, it's hard to complain.",1279324800,2,1569,4.757352941176471
