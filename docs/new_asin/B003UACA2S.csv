8405774,5,B003UACA2S,"I think this is a great instructional DVD.  Its also $2.00 cheaper than the same DVD, sold by the same guy, that is supposedly for Intermediate guitarists that are stuck in a rut.  Save your money and buy this one.",1482105600,,214,4.325
8405775,5,B003UACA2S,"Guitar Consepts is the second DVD I have purchased from JoeDoc Music.  I also have his Travis Picking Guitar video.  I have been playing guitar for decades and have purchased numerous books, DVDs and e-lessons.  I was very pleased to see the clarity of Joe's instruction and the quality of the teaching materials he provides.  I have found that many of the well known players who publish books and DVDs are lacking in teaching experience and good quality materials.  I believe that Joe is a refreshing change from the sea of humdrum ""same old"" materials that are published and republished every year.  Joe's teaching style is relaxed and informal and, in my opinion, loaded with fresh insights and tips that are quite helpful, even for an intermediate player like me.  The cost of the DVDs and books are very competitive with most comparable items on the internet.  The books can be previewed through Kindle and the DVDs can also be previewed on You Tube.  I rarely review products and will make an exception when I experience a really outstanding product.  Guitar Concepts is appropriate for both beginning and intermediate levels.",1379462400,3,1132,4.910526315789474
