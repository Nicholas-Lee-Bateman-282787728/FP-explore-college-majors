7891970,4,630553859X,"After many years during which I'm collecting the transformers series, and after watching this box set, I agree with other buyers that the box set combines various episodes not in the order that it was originally released nevertheless, I liked all of them, because if you like the transformers stories it doesn't really if the episodes are not arranged as they were when they were first released. Especially that each episode stand alone.",1518393600,,437,5.0
7891971,5,630553859X,"Transfomers 3 Pack volume 1 is one the best video packs from the series. Not only does it print randomly selected episodes of the American Transformers cartoon series, it is the first in a series of volumes distributed by Rhino Home Video! The first video contains episodes ""A Prime Problem"" and ""City of Steal"". The second video contains episodes "" the Search for Alpha Trion"" and the post-movie episode ""Dark Awakening"". Dark Awakening is the prelude to the Return of Optimus Prime two-parter episode. (Transfomers: Volume 7 Kid Rhino) The Third video Video contains episodes Starscream's Brigade and AutoBeserk. There a-lot of mistakes made by Rhino Home Video on this paticular video. The first mistake, The cover on the Video features Rodimus Prime but he is not in this video. The people that packaged the video mistook Rodimus Prime for the other Autobot Red Alert! They both have a similar color scheme (red armor) But are very different Autobots! The second mistake Rhino Home video made is that Starscream's Brigade is actually a two-parter. Instead of AutoBeserk it should have been "" The Revenge of Bruticus"" episode. After the very last scene where Starscream and the Combaticons are abandoned on the astriod by Megatron, The should have next episode on the video, The Revenge of Bruticus, The combaticons land the astroid on Cybertron ploting their revenge against all the Transformers. Starscream is suppose to leave them to find his way back to Earth. the Autobots are saving the humans on Earth Because the weather temperature keeps climbing,the heat, the hot weather, and the city being infest by Insecticons. The Combaticons bult a device on Cyberton that allows the Earth to fall into the Sun. Optimus Prime and other Autobots, Megatron,Shockwave, and Starscream rush to Cybertron to save Earth from destruction. It was disappointing that this particular video was not handled carefully. Other than that, Volume three still has two of the best episodes from season 2 and I am still going to recommend it. Buy the 3 pack! It's good to have if you were a part of the Cartoons of the 1980s generation.",991872000,7,2118,4.9858757062146895
7891972,3,630553859X,"I have the set mentioned here. As a fan of the Transformers I was rather anxious to watch them. I was rather disappointed at the misleading title of the box set. It says its a three pack Vol. 1 VHS (and you therefore expect it to be the first three tapes of season 1), not the case however. They are three random tapes of various episodes and seperate seasons. To someone who's new to Transformers this would confuse the living daylights out of them. Personally I hate it when this sort of thing happens and can only imagine that someone was trying to make alot of money with very little thought as to the way they market their product. If you are a fan of the Transformers and watch often than this would be a good investment. If however you are new to Transformers this will only prove to be a disappointment.",974246400,10,811,4.342105263157895
7891973,5,630553859X,"I love all of these vidoes. As a longtime fan of the Transformers from the first cartoon, I recently purchased the first two three packs and soon will purchase the 3 pak 3 and 4.  The only problem I had with the set is the episode ""Starscreams Brigade"" should have had part 2 on the same tape.  The episodes could also relate to each other a little better.  Only hardcore Transformers fans like myself can understand the episodes.  THE CARTOON NETWORK SHOULD BUY THE RIGHTS TO THE TRANSFORMERS!!!!!",970185600,2,498,4.625

7891975,4,630553859X,"These episodes are wonderful! If you love the Transformers then you'll love this. The only problem I had was trying to follw the order, of which there was none.  One minute I see Spike as a kid and the next I see Rodimus  Prime leading the Autobots then back to somewhere in between.  The first  tape is great, the second I personally didn't care for but I know those who  do.  The third is still good, but I felt that it lost a bit of the old  Transformer feel that the first tape had. All in all a buy that I don't  regret making!",958953600,2,532,4.048076923076923
7891976,5,630553859X,"Transformers really stands out among such a guck of all those1980s kartoonies - in fact, despite the fact I happened to be a14-year-old girl back then, I was really drawn into such a wonderful action-adventure world full of all those robotic creations with such handsome, noble, and sometimes fearsome faces. Instead of just your typical macho little-boy stuff, you get all sorts of really interesting nonsexist stories shot through with humor and fantasy as well as really serious conflicts and sci-fi violence. Why, there's even a romantic tale between one of the chivalrous Autobots and a human woman, believe it or not!  No Transformer fan will ever forget Optimus Prime, who seems like such a loving old father who's always looking out for his faithful warriors, that cute, bumbling little Bumblebee who can rearrange himself into a perky yellow Volkswagon (my most favorite Transformer character), and all the rest as well as the evil, sneering Megatron, the cocky Starscream, and all those really cool villians! So now you Transformer buffs can have a very happy reunion with all your old friends, nice or naughty!",954892800,3,1121,5.092391304347826
