2533594,5,B000ETRA46,"I picked this one up as a free rental because an earlier film would not play properly.  My decision process went something like; hmmm... a film with Kwai Chang Caine and Pocahontas in it has just got to be good.  So much for my sophisticated thought processes.

Some times it really is that simple, however.  David Carradine did not disappoint in his performance and neither did Irene Bedard, who, for those folks who don't read the credits, was the speaking voice of Disney's Pocahontas.  Wes Studi, who plays the father of Irene's character, absolutely shines in his role.

It is a modern classic Western that has all the things that made the Western genre king in times past, and quite possibly will bring it back to dominance in times to come.  In some ways, it is reminiscent of an old Disney film like Old Yeller, though it is blessed with a happy ending.

The values portrayed and celebrated are those I would want my children exposed to.  For the cast and crew of this movie, thank you so very much for a really good film!  May God be with each and every one of you.",1160611200,17,1074,4.461538461538462
2533595,5,B000ETRA46,"This was a good film. The director did an awesome job and must have wanted to do a real family story. I would not hesitate letting my kids or grand kids watch this movie. The actors were great, I love Wes Studi and David Carradene. The role of Daniel played by Fred Griffith was a great touch that brings the story to a close. I had not heard of Fred Griffith before this movie but I'm now looking for other movies he's been in.

I would definately reccommend this movie to anyone at any age. I wish I could say that about more movies.",1150761600,14,535,4.144230769230769
2533596,5,B000ETRA46,"As more westerns hit the screens, it is refreshing to find a family western that stresses loyalty and portrays the importance of bonds between family and friends, and even more amazing when that film blends this between cowboys and Indians.

""Miracle at Sage Creek"" hits this mark; it is a story about two families, era 1880's Wyoming settlement- one lead by a bitter patriarch rancher and the other a mixed white-Indian household. David Carradine plays the father/grandfather who, blinded by the loss of his wife at the hand of Indians, ultimately finds forgiveness and acceptance of his Indian neighbors- his eyes are opened to see that it is the community and love for each other that matters most.

Also refreshing is to see the strong friendships the children of these mixed families have for each other, and how they are both taught by their parents to seek guidance- one through prayer to God, and the other to the ""Great Spirit""- albeit to lien not on their own strengths. ""Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and he will direct your paths."" PROVERBS 3:5-6

The acting is clean, the sets superb. Amazing work with the horses, dog, and children! Young upcoming actor Wyatt Turner does an excellent job portraying the sick grandson, along with the outstanding acting talents of these young actors: Masam Holden, Darian Weiss, and Marissa Baca.

WHAT a cast- West Studi and Irene Bedard play their Indian parts without flaw, Tim Abell, Michael Parks, Francine York, Buck Taylor, Sarah Aldrich, David Quinn round out the all-star cast.

NO profanity, horse chase scenes, and shooting make this an all-around western that any western genre lover should see, and that every family should share with each-other!",1143676800,42,1789,4.95

There are some scary moments for young children when characters in the movie are in danger, but nothing graphic or gory is shown.  ""Family friendly"" story that includes the ideas of how we treat each other and why and how we should treat each other despite differences, and all the things we share like the joy of family and a belief in something greater than ourselves.

2533615,4,B000ETRA46,"Leave no cliche' untouched, and finish with no bow left untied.  This well made movie is completely predictable for anyone who grew up on 1950's family Westerns. Good cast, well-acted, never a hair or a shirt button out of place.  If you want ""realistic"", you'd best look elsewhere, for something more recent and ""gritty.""  If you want a tidy period piece of period family entertainment -- set in open range country of 1888, this one meets that timeless standard.

It is structured as a classic ""teaching story"", with idealized characters and clear cause-and-effect relationships. It is suitable for kids of older than perhaps 8.  There is a bit of on-screen violence -- classic old Western Movie stuff -- but  isn't particularly gory or overplayed..  The moral messages are suprisingly up-to-date; they are presented at a child's level of complexity, yet aren' simplistic enough tol annoy most parents.

But be warned!  The movie's ""breathtaking backdrop of Wyoming majestic open range"" is all in Arizona.  Yep, it's purty and very Western-movie rustic and sagebrushy ... but Wyoming it ain't!

if you don't mind a few bad guys meeting their earned rewards, with no gore, there are moral lessons throughout, with a very up-to-date (at a child-friendly level of complexity) treatment of",1479600000,2,1286,5.105263157894737

2533664,2,B000ETRA46,"Its a morality play basically.  The dialogue is so simple and obvious that this movie clearly was not intended for adults.  It might be a good movie for kids up to the age of 8-10, but even older children are likely to see it as so obvious they would be bored by it.  There are several subplots running: cruel rich rancher trying to expel an Indian family from his land; same rich rancher despises his preacher turned rancher son-in-law;  his grandson befriends the boy in the Indian family the rancher despises, and his other grandson become critically ill.  Somehow all of the evil running through these subplots is defeated - the assassination attempt on the half Indian father fails and he miraculously survives a deadly fall and even walks home after losing his horse, the two boys who are friends are saved from a wolf by the stray dog one of them has befriended and are miraculously  found in the high plains late at night by the ex-minister son-in-law,  the old Indian grandfather saves the life of the ill grandson who is near death with some magic native medicine, and the embittered rancher who caused much of the tragedy suddenly loses all of his bitterness and invites the Indian family he tried to destroy to Christmas dinner with his now highly respected son-in-law and everybody lives happily thereafter.  Its as if Santa Claus, the tooth fairy, and the Easter Bunny all turn out to be real and all appear in the flesh at the same time!  The actors in the movie did a credible job, making a valiant attempt with a script that would be expected to be seen on a Saturday AM children's show.",1468886400,,1604,4.6

A very wealthy rancher, bitter over the death of his wife accused a neighboring Native American, whose daughter was married to a white, of stealing his horses off his land.  The land was open range and the horses were wild but he coveted everything and used to wealth and connections to expel the ""squatters"" and confine them to a reservation.  Circumstances that followed that convinced the old man that all people have worth.

I have no idea what this movie was doing in the Action section of Blockbuster. I have no idea how Kirby Jones of Western Writers of America (one of the endorsers on the jacket)could possibly believe this is ""one of the best Westerns in 20 years""--absolutely BIZARRE comment. I also have no idea how it could have won a Spur Award for Best Western Drama (unless there weren't many Westerns made in 2006?).

I suppose the main problem is that the movie is misrepresented in terms of its genre. It's fine for a family film or a TV Christmas special (although I thought it snows in Wyoming in December?). It's a family drama with two odd, short gun fights (the first one was okay but the second one was totally unbelievable--guys unable to hit the other guys at close range?) that happens to take place on a Wyoming homestead in 1888. The filmmakers are not at fault for this--they clearly say that  they wanted to make a Western-flavored film that kids would like.

I think the biggest criticism I have for it, though (genre mix-up aside), is the lack of simple details that would make it more believable as a period piece. First, with the exception of Wes Studi (who is believable as a diplaced Crow chief in his diction and bearing), the actors all sounded and looked like 21st century people wearing 19th century clothes and saying lines that either you'd say today or which someone today would imagine someone might say in 1888. Most of the actors do admirably well with the not-too-great script (although the kids are certainly miscast). But my other complaint is that there wasn't one speck of dirt anywhere! I will admit, however, that it wasn't any help that I watched 3:10 to Yuma (the new one) yesterday. Night and day. True, it's not exactly a family film and this one had to tone down typical Western violence, but I don't see how it would be bad for kids to see frontier people with bad teeth and the grime, dust, and sweat that comes with working hard on a homestead. This kind of realism wouldn't make anything dismal--it would actually make the story more uplifting. Ah well.

I must say that, as a fan, I was also slightly disappointed that Wes Studi didn't have more lines and that Irene Bedard's lines were not very well-written (although she did well with what she had to work with). The ubiquitous David Carradine was good, as was the actress playing his daughter. Probably the best praise I can dole out is for the DP. Many very nice exterior shots, particularly of the land and horses. A great use of HD.",1223769600,2,2774,4.584677419354839

8114105,4,B000ETRA46,"RELEASED IN 2005 and directed by James Intveld, Miracle at Sage Creek (aka Christmas Miracle at Sage Creek) is a Western about two families in 1888 Wyoming who overcome bitterness, hatred, prejudice, doubt and death during Christmas. MAIN CAST: David Carradine, Wes Studi, Sarah Aldrich, Daniel Quinn, Irene Bedard & Tim Abell.

The problem some viewers have with this Western is that the events take place near Cheyenne in southeastern Wyoming around Christmas time, but it was shot in southeastern Arizona outside Tucson where theres desert, cacti and no snow. For comparison, the wintery scenes of The Hateful Eight (2015) were shot 250 miles FURTHER SOUTH from Cheyenne near Telluride, Colorado.

Whereas this is a glaring problem for Miracle at Sage Creek, particularly for people who care about geographical details, the obvious reason the producers shot the movie in southeastern Arizona was to save money. After all, there are ready-made movie sets near Tucson, like Old Tucson and Gammon's Gulch Movie Set, but generally not in the Cheyenne area. The only way I could overlook this issue was to imagine the events taking place in southern Arizona. Really, I have no idea why they didn't just tweak the story so that it takes place there.

Another thing to consider is that Westerns, particularly older ones, are notorious for being shot in places far from where they propose to take place. A good example are the many ones that take place in Texas, but were conveniently shot in Arizona or California. With this and the above in mind, perhaps we can have mercy on ""Miracle at Sage Creek.""

Overlooking that transgression, this is a decent inspirational Western focusing on drama rather than conventional Western action, although there some of that (shootouts). And, despite the error in locations, the settings are magnificent (theyre just not anything close to southeastern Wyoming). Moreover, both Carradine and Studi are stalwart in their roles while the others listed above offer capable support. What I appreciate most, beyond the picturesque scenery, is the palpable tone of reverence, which is helped via the venerable score by James Intveld & Michael Turner.

While this is a feel good movie with one predictable element at the very end, it addresses several heavy topics, like prejudice, injustice, bitterness, hatred, life-or-death situations, confrontation, unexpected violence, the humbling need for a miracle, the power of simple faith (heathen or not), positive confession and the beauty of a change of heart.

THE FILM RUNS 90 minutes and was shot in southeastern Arizona (Benson, Mescal, Old Tucson, Douglas & Gammons Gulch). WRITER: Thadd Turner.
