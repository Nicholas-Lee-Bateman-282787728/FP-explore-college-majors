2994748,5,B000X1CMXO,What can I say about this iconic film upon the 30th anniversary DVD release? If you weren't alive when it came out it is probably impossible to understand the impact it had on pop culture and moviegoers. The DVD re-issue is very well updated with extras not found on the earlier versions and the picture and sound have been remastered to excellent standards-this is the best-looking JAWS release and the sound is incredible for a DVD. Only Blu-Ray remaster might surpass it.,1428278400,3,474,4.7926829268292686
2994749,5,B000X1CMXO,"Geez, this movie scared the hell out of me as a kid. I wasn't able to go anywhere near the beach for years, as far as I can remember. Very effective  movie.

2994808,5,B000X1CMXO,"In this, probably the VERY first ""Summer Blockbuster"" as it would be known today, we have a fully RESTORED version on Blu-ray HD! Wow! Is it every bit of glorious fun as it ever was 40 odd years ago. In 1975, Steven Spielberg set out to make a ""splash"" with JAWS. Before that date, there had been no movie about The Great White shark and what it could do wreaking havoc on a summer vacation Island, if you will. The idea was set, now to make the movie happen.
Remember folks, no CGI. All props. I think Steven and the Crew did a great job on all aspects of this movie, even recording behind the scenes footage, deleted scenes, etc. It's a masterpiece of Cinema film making to this date.
If you get a group of film goers together and say ""What summer movie can you name right off that's exciting, yet tense and horrific?"" The answer would most likely be JAWS.
THIS is the Edition you want to get. Flawless and Restored as it should be with a great DTS HD 7.1 mix and other mixes, of course in Audio.
This movie has one of the most ICONIC musical scores ever on screen. Anyone that has seen this movie KNOWS when you hear that first few notes of the song, you are talking JAWS.
See this movie in June or July, perhaps August. Whatever you do, make sure you have your sound way up when seeing it!
So many special features on this newest RESTORED Edition! Well worth every penny!!",1509926400,,1376,4.275862068965517

Fine details such as sand granules, cloth, pores, etc. are very pronounced. The film honestly looked like it had been made recently. All of the original special features in the older dvd's were included as well as some new behind the scenes featurettes, such as ""the shark is still working"" and a detailed look at the restoration process used for the Blu-ray release. My father, who had seen the film several times when it was originally released in theaters, was very impressed with how well the film had been restored. Suffice to say, this is the best that Jaws has ever looked. The picture and sound quality were well above what I was expecting, and I can't recommend it enough.",1509235200,,839,4.7534246575342465

She mentioned specifically the Swiss Family Robinson and Jaws; I felt yet again, light-years away from the time of my youth, when, as today, times were not fair, nor easy, but a hell of a lot simpler and at least for us in the U.S., a lot safer and with fewer people looking to complain, or to find ways to steal from you.  I then was prompted to order both aforementioned movies, and enjoy them greatly, knowing that today, their filming would have my neighbor as the nemesis rather than a shark, and the other film would be recast and re-titled as the [Confused Family Robinperson], the cast on some remote island, finding creative ways to develop a soap-opera environment, rather than just have some fun as they survived another day within their fantasy setting.

Jaws is easily without question one of the all time greatest movies ever, and it is also been my favorite movie ever since I first saw it in it's full entirety when I was 11, and it is still my favorite movie to this very day. I just absolutely love this movie. I could just watch it over and over and never grow tired of it at all whatsoever. Penned as the original summer blockbuster, this 1975 film classic forever set the standards for the edge-of-your seat suspense and instantly became a cultural phenomenon, shattered box office records and forever changed the movie industry. Directed by legendary director Steven Spielberg, and also featuring an unforgettable soundtrack score courtesy of John Williams, Jaws remains one of Hollywood's most influential and gripping adventures in motion picture history. The film itself also received an Academy Award nominee for Best Picture (""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" would go on to win that award), but it would go on to win three other Academy Awards including for film editing (Verna Fields), music score (John Williams) and best sound (Robet Hoyt, Roger Heman, Earl Madery and John Carter) as well. And yes, while Steven Spielberg would go on to direct other masterpieces such as ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial"", ""Jurassic Park"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", etc, but Jaws in my humble opinion remains Spielberg's ultimate and definitive masterpiece hands down, and it would also put Spielberg on the map and forever made him a household name director wise as well. Being such a huge fan of Jaws, I am very happy and fortunate to own several VHS and DVD copies (including the 1983 MCA Home Video VHS release) and of course this Blu-Ray edition which I'm gonna be reviewing at this time.

Based on Peter Benchley's best selling novel of the same name and shot on location on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, the film's story centers around a giant man-eating great white shark wreaking havoc on beachgoers in the fictional New England summer resort town of Amity Island thus prompting the town's local police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) to join forces with old grizzled shark fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) and young marine biologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to put an end to the monster's reign of aquatic terror once and for all. The film itself is also notorious for it's troubled production which included having a troubled shoot and going far over budget and past schedule, as well as the full-sized mechanical monster shark nicknamed ""Bruce"" having frequently malfunctioned at sea during filming in the Atlantic Ocean, and among other things. However Spielberg and the rest of his crew would manage to turn what could've been a major disaster into a triumphant and timeless masterpiece.

The story

The films starts off with a young girl named Chrissie Watkins who leaves a party on Amity Island and decides to go for a swim. While swimming out near a buoy, Chrissie is soon seized by something from below, and she is then violently thrashed around and pulled under the ocean. Chrissie Watkins' death scene in the opening of the movie is unquestionably one of the most legendary scenes in the history of film ever.

The next day, Amity police chief Martin Brody investigates the problem after finding Chrissie's partial remains on the shore. The medical examiner informs Brody that Chrissie's death was due to a shark attack. Brody plans to close the beaches but is overruled by the town's mayor Larry Vaughn, who fears that reports of a shark attack will ruin the summer tourist season, the town's primary source of income. The medical examiner consequently attributes the death to a boating accident. Brody reluctantly goes along with the explanation. The shark then kills a young boy named Alex Kintner while swimming at the town beach. His mother places a bounty on the shark, sparking an amateur shark-hunting frenzy and attracting the attention of local professional shark hunter Quint, who offers to hunt and kill the shark for $10,000. Meanwhile, Brody enlists the help of marine biologist Matt Hooper who examines Chrissie's remains and determines that she was killed by a shark, not a boat. A large tiger shark is caught by fishermen, leading the townspeople to believe the problem is solved. Hooper asks to examine its stomach contents, but Vaughn refuses. That night, Brody and Hooper secretly open the shark's stomach and discover that it does not contain any human remains. They head out to sea on Hooper's boat to find the shark, but instead find the wreckage of a half-sunken boat belonging to local fisherman Ben Gardner. Hooper explores the vessel underwater and discovers a sizable great white shark's tooth embedded inside the damaged hull before he is startled by Gardner's partial corpse, causing him to drop the tooth. Without evidence, Vaughn refuses to close the beaches or hire Quint to hunt and kill the shark.

Many tourists arrive on the Fourth of July. A prank by two kids with a cardboard cut-out of a shark fin causes panic at the main beach while the real great white shark enters a nearby estuary and kills a man in a rowboat. Brody's son Michael, who narrowly escapes the attack, goes into shock. Brody finally convinces Vaughn to hire Quint, and Quint reluctantly allows Hooper and Brody to join in on the hunt. The three heroes set out to sea to kill the shark aboard Quint's vessel, The Orca.

While at sea, Brody is given the task of laying a chum line, and as he is chucking away chum and blood away over his shoulder to attract the shark, suddenly an enormous great white looms up behind the boat startling Brody which then leads him to reply to Quint: ""You're gonna need a bigger boat!"" As the trio watches the shark circle around the Orca, Quint estimates it's size as twenty-five feet in length, with a weight of over three tons. He harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears. We then get to my favorite scene in the movie where our heroes retire to the vessel's cabin that night, where they show off and compare each other's scars and wounds, and Quint relates his experiences with sharks as a survivor of the tragic sinking of the USS Indianapolis. This is definitely my favorite scene in the whole movie here. The dialogue delivered by Robert Shaw in this particular scene is just absolutely brilliant and impeccable, and also very chilling beyond words, you just can't even dare to take your eyes off the screen when he delivers that speech. It is just pure genius. And as the trio are singing ""Show Me the Way to Go Home"", the shark suddenly returns, damages the hull and slips away. It reappears the next morning. Brody attempts to call the U.S. Coast Guard, but Quint destroys the radio, enraging Brody. After a long chase, Quint harpoons two more barrels to the shark, and the men tie them both to the stern, but the shark drags the boat backwards, forcing water onto the deck and flooding the engine. Quint severs the line to prevent the transom from being cut. He then heads toward shore, hoping to draw it into shallow waters and suffocate it. In his obsession to kill the shark, Quint burns out the Orca's engine.

With the boat immobilized, the trio attempt a desperate approach: Hooper dons scuba gear and enters the ocean inside a shark proof cage, intending to lethally inject the shark with a hypodermic spear filled with strychnine. The shark attacks and demolishes the cage from behind, causing Hooper to drop the spear before he can inject it. When the shark becomes entangled in the wrecked cage, Hooper escapes and hides in the seabed. The shark then leaps onto the boat and attacks it directly, crushing the transom. Quint slides down the deck and is devoured alive by the shark. When the shark attacks again, Brody shoves a pressurized scuba tank into its mouth, then takes Quint's rifle and climbs the sinking Orca's mast. The shark, with the tank still in its mouth, begins swimming toward Brody, who shoots the tank, causing it to explode and blowing the shark to pieces. Hooper swims to the surface and he and Brody use the barrels to swim back to shore.

All in all, Jaws is just absolutely perfect on every level of movie making. The characters are so incredibly well developed, so well that the audience can feel their fears, emotions and of course stupidity when they're supposed to. The screenplay courtesy of Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb is also very tight and well written, and Spielberg's direction is just downright masterful and top notch throughout. His timing is superb and he does an incredible job at mixing suspense, horror, comedy and adventure to brilliant and genuine effect. He really makes the audience feel like they are nothing but puppets in his fingers and the way he pulls peoples strings whenever he wants them to feel whether it be scared or horrified or even amused is just masterfully done. For a good example, take Alex Kintner's death scene. It all starts with a bunch of people playing on the beach and in the water while Brody is watching intently. We along with Brody hear playful screams from a young girl, and then we see a young man and his dog playing fetch the stick, and then later when the stick is floating in the water, the dog is nowhere to be found. Then we finally see young Alex who goes out into the water with his raft. More kids are then seen splashing around, and following that, there's a shot approaching Alex paddling away on his raft from underwater thus showcasing the shark's point of view, and then composer John Williams' music hits and of course we all know what happens from that moment on. That scene just shows how truly masterful Spielberg can be at manipulating the audiences by showing the shark's point of view via camera rather than showing the shark entirely in the early stages of the film. And of course, that's what made Jaws so gripping is that Spielberg didn't show his monster until most of the second half of the film. Until then, you only saw people in the water reacting to attacks, screaming and writhing as the invisible killer underneath them turned the water blood red. The music score courtesy of John Williams is what really drives this brilliant piece of cinema from the very beginning to the very end. If there's one specific word to decribe Williams' score in Jaws and that one word would have to be 'incredible' especially that infamous main shark theme (which is a simple alternating pattern of two notes - variously identified as ""E and F"" or 'F and F sharp"") which is no doubt a classic piece of suspense music, and is very synonymous with danger approaching. According to John, the main theme was meant to represent the shark as an instinctual, relentless and unstoppable force. Whenever you hear that theme, you know danger is approaching and things are definitely getting serious here.

The acting from the cast in the film not to also mention is very brilliant in every sense of the word as well. You've got Roy Scheider who gives an amazing performance as Amity police chief Martin Brody, the film's main hero as he is determined to close the beaches and protect the beachgoers despite Mayor Larry Vaughn's objections, and he also has his fear of the ocean put to the ultimate test along the way. Richard Dreyfuss is also perfectly cast as Matt Hooper, the young marine biologist whom Brody calls in to lend a hand with the shark crisis and he also tends to land in some very funny bits in along the way especially during the scene in which he and Quint are comparing each others scars, and of course, you've got Robert Shaw whose memorable performance as Quint, the crusty, old and grizzled shark hunter whose character is both funny at times and very chilling at others as well. His famous Indianapolis speech is without question absolutely chilling and powerful beyond words, and I always find myself memorizing every single line from his speech everytime I watch that scene. Just absolutely pure genius. The overall chemistry of Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss is just absolute perfection as seen in the second half when they're all out at sea on Quint's vessel, The Orca, and it showcases the growing respect and bond among the three men. You also have Lorraine Gary who is excellent as Brody's wife Ellen who is also the mother of Brody's two young sons, Michael (Chris Rebello) and Sean (Jay Mello), and Murray Hamilton is also fantastic as the town's mayor Larry Vaughn who despite Brody's warnings is more concerned about the summer economy and keeping the beaches open.

Now, as for the Blu-Ray edition here goes, it is just absolutely amazing, and not to also mention the overall picture quality and sound is just top notch. It's also filled with a boatload of awesome bonus material which includes a documentary entitled, ""The Shark is Still Working"" which is narrated by Scheider himself, and provides an amazing in-depth look at the trials and tribulations into the making of this film and how Spielberg took what could've been a terrible disaster in resulting in having his directing career sink to the bottom, but triumphantly turned Jaws into a timeless masterpiece that continues to keep generations out of the water and also inspire those to get into the film business at the same time. Bottom line, Jaws is an absolute masterpiece of suspense and terror. Absolutely brilliant in every sense of the word, and they'll never be another masterpiece like it...Period!!!

However, you have not thought about the film than we humans may be more frightening in the great white shark? We can see from the human point of view, because we are a group of ideas, but we can justifiably hurt the other different types of creature, and even harm people to fulfill their own selfish desires.

2995047,5,B000X1CMXO,"Included is a short interview with Spielberg wondering why this Blu-ray reissue looks and sounds as good as it is. He says that the original negatives that the restoration team scanned were in bad condition. Spielberg goes so far to say that audiences watching the Blu-ray version are experiencing better picture and sound quality than theatre audiences back in 1976. For the most part, he's right.

The biggest improvements come in the famous night scenes on the beach that open the movie. Darks are richer and darker rather than fuzzy and hazy. Shots of the ocean after the shark attack on the swimmer are silvery and rich. The many ripples in the ocean are sharp. You can tell DP Butler and Spielberg put lots of work into these opening shots which was not apparent in the DVD version.

This movie is such a legend that I can't say much more about it. If it's over-rated, it's over-rated only by a little bit. It suffers from its final 30 minutes, which feature many improbabilities all crowned by an unlikely (but satisfying) climax. ""Smile you son of a b---."" It's always a great moment,  but really now...

John Williams' famous score--comprehending everything from The Rite Of Spring to La Mer and Baroque fugues--sounds about the same as the DVD, only louder and more immediate. Sound effects are more immediate as well, especially during the last half hour.

This movie is one of the few older classics that has appeared on the CNet list of Top 40 Blu-rays for over a year, competing with all those superhero movies and Pixar cartoon movies.

2995093,5,B000X1CMXO,"Not so much a reviewer as a regurgitator as I won't be saying anything new; still, I want my two cents in. Jaws has snagged a place in landmark cinema. It holds bragging rights as the movie that launched the summer blockbuster. Before that summer of 1975, popular thought amongst the studio execs and marketing savants was that only kids ventured to the movie theater during them hot summer days. Jaws forever changed that landscape. Jaws was a B-movie creature feature that was elevated to box office gold, courtesy of savvy, improvised filmmaking, a superlative cast, and an insanely aggressive marketing campaign. It's almost like the movie-going audience had no choice but to flock to the theaters.

Did you know shark attacks can happen in three feet of water, ten feet away from the beach? Jaws was awful mean to beach tourism as that bit of enterprise plummeted in the summer of '75. Everyone was just too scared to go into the water. I guess there weren't too many intrepid police chiefs, ichthyologists, or shark hunters around to ease the anxious revelers. Luckily for the New England island resort community of Amity, all three types eventually converged to take on a freakish, three-ton, 25-foot-long Great White predator that's staked claim to the waters around Amity. It certainly doesn't contribute to anyone's peace of mind that that guy (Richard Dreyfuss) from the Oceanographic Institute keeps saying ominous stuff like ""What we are dealing with here is a perfect engine, an eating machine."" To belay such alarmism, the mayor, shoveling deep into the mercantile politics of resort tourism, tells the press: ""Amity, as you know, means friendship."" He insists that the beaches be kept open for the 4th of July holiday. It's all good, the water's fine. The water's not fine.

Adapting Peter Benchley's best-seller, Jaws' biggest triumph is in humanizing its cast for maximum intrigue and empathy. The folks we meet onscreen feel like real people, squabble and get frightened and bond like real people. Take Amity's police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) whose distaste for open water is revealed early on. Chief Brody hates water so much he stays in the car whenever on the ferry ride to the mainland. And yet he's gutsy enough to challenge the mayor when that fool puts commerce before saving lives, and gutsy enough to join in on the shark hunt on the Orca, Quint's 29-foot fish trawler. Oh, man, and Quint. Robert Shaw grabs the film's most colorful part as the crazed, cranky old sea dog, Quint, hired by Amity to hunt and kill the Great White. He's got the best acting moment, too, as he delivers a chilling and utterly mesmerizing monologue about his wartime experience on (and then off) the USS Indianapolis. Up-and-comer Richard Dreyfuss adds tremendous energy and likability as ichthyologist Matt Hooper who brings doomed hi-tech gadgetry to the fray. This trio's layered interactions went a long way into convincing us to give a crap about what happens to them.

There are several gory moments, but not as many as you'd think. Young director Steven Spielberg and his crew had a torturous time of it shooting the movie; wasn't long before it dawned on all that they were dealing with an albatross, a dead weight. Things just kept going wrong. The movie was over-budget and crept past its original finishing time. Spielberg had these three mechanical sharks - collectively called ""Bruce"" after Spielberg's lawyer - with which he was gonna shoot many more shark attacks than what we ended up with. Except the mechanical sharks kept breaking down, thus forcing Spielberg to come up with a work-around. The result, amazingly, is a movie that unfolds more like an elegant Hitchcock suspenser than a B-movie horror schlocker. Spielberg had to be sparing in how much he showed the shark. Instead, he relied more on establishing mood and atmosphere and memorable character beats... and on John Williams' inspired, driving score. Much of the unease felt by the theater audience was rooted in their imagination's doing most of the heavy lifting. And there's something to be said about a shark being a real creature - as opposed to some sci-fi monster - that plays havoc with our primal fears. A shark is real, yo, a frightening true-to-life ""miracle of evolution."" This sh-- could actually happen. And me for the inside pool.",1468713600,,4341,4.9519890260631

2995131,5,B000X1CMXO,"The classic movie that will have you terrified of the ocean. Its pretty much a given that after seeing this, everytime you go swimming in the ocean this movie will be in the back of your mind. Its really unfortunate that they had to make three abysmal sequels to this great movie. They should have left it alone at this one. You know, if you think about it, if this movie had been made today, the shark would have been cgi, would have had far more screen time, and would be forgettable, but I digress. They just don't make movies like this anymore.

I don't have to go over the plot, we all know it by now. Ill just share a couple of my thoughts about the movie. The first half of the movie, while good, is nothing spectacular. Its the last half when Brody, Hooper, and Quint are out on the boat hunting the great white that makes this movie what it is. Its very intense, includeds some great bonding scenes between the men, and some great dialouge like Quint telling his story about the U.S.S Indianapolis. Spielburg wisely keeps the shark out of view most of the movie until the famous scene where Brody is throwing chum in the water and we see the shark for the first time. His reaction is perfect, and quietly says to Quinn, ""We're gonna need a bigger boat."" From then on its heart pounding suspense as the men try to kill the shark, and shark tries to do likewise to them.

This movie is a classic that everyone should see, and filmakers today should learn from, because nothing they make today even comes close to being this good.",1467158400,,1536,4.3671328671328675

It's amazing that they could get true blacks and such depth out from the old grainy stock. The only thing lacking is the sound; don't get me wrong, it's good, but the music (which is an integral part of this movie) is a little more muted than previous releases. Watch it in MONO sound and It packs a little more punch; but it's not as much in the foreground when on DTS or Dolby digital. It's just my one little quib, but the picture more than makes up for it.

If you have not seen this movie yet, the only thing I have to say to you is, ""Why haven't you seen it?"" OK, so you love the beach and love to swim. I can understand that. I do too. However, you should see it, especially with all the recent shark attacks that have happened. When I first saw it, shark attacks were very, very, very rare. But JAWs still scared me enough to keep me in very shallow water all summer. Now it will probably keep you out of the water for quite a while, especially in the areas where Great Whites are being spotted. Talk about adrenalin rushes. If that's not enough of a reason for anyone to see this movie for the first time, or for the 100th time, I don't know what is!",1465084800,14,809,4.0625

I will say that I enjoy comparing movies with the book or story they are based on.  I purchased the book after seeing the movie.  I wished I had done it the other way around.  The book was OK.  The movie was better than the book.

The movie is a true thriller.  Tension is built while seeing very little of the shark.  The movie also does a great job of humanizing the characters.  The interactions of the chief and his son is heartwarming.  The pathos of a mother of a dead child is extremely accurately conveyed.  At this point In time, there is also a certain time capsule aspect to this movie that I greatly enjoy now.  This movie now provides a great viewing experience.

I will not bother reviewing the movie for its plot or production values, that has been done by many others here. But I will say that when the movie was released in 1975, I thought it was a bit overrated after having looked forward very much to seeing it, but upon viewing it recently on TV and then purchasing this Blu-ray and viewing it in even better high-definition quality than on TCM, I enjoy the story itself more, and I'm very glad at having purchased this Blu-ray.",1463011200,3,731,4.801587301587301

2995237,5,B000X1CMXO,"Jaws, now an iconic American film, was a film built around the premise of suspense.  Why was the film so successful?  What separated this film from other scary movies from the 70s & why are we still talking about it in 2016?  To begin with, the soundtrack of the film utilizes an escalating trombone to instill tense, dramatic, and suspenseful moments in the film and counter it with silence, another tool of suspense, to build to those moments through emotion before the action starts.
Throughout the film they utilize the technique of matching eye lines across cuts to form continuity and the illusion that these two separate images are looking into each others eyes.  Most notably this is seen in the opening scene with the kids on the beach.  The guy is in one cut looking to the right, in the next cut the girl is looking to the left of the screen.  This implies eye contact between these two characters, a method used commonly in film making nowadays.  Lighting was also used effectively for continuity purposes in Jaws, using the angle of light to indicate that people are in different sides of the room in different shots, primarily in the cabin of the ship at night when the men are out hunting the shark.  In fact, certain shots of individuals faces make this movie stand out because of the effect they have.  In one of the first few scenes with the character of Brody the camera moves with Brody as he walks through crowds of people along the dock.  Were following him because he is the main character, & the use of the camera like this shows the audience this in a subtle way.  Close ups of peoples faces can also do a number of things as are shown in this film.  They can make you wonder what the character is thinking and bring you inside their head, or they can bring you, the viewer into the scene, creating a feeling of intensity or shock.  Intensity is created when close shots are taken in the water during the shark attacks bringing you into the moment.  Shock is found in the close up of the womans face staring straight at the camera when she sees a fin in the water.  Because of the close up, as a viewer, you can relate to her emotions and feel the shock for yourself.  In one of the many beach scenes close ups and wide range shots are used to show our main character Brody viewing the water beyond the people who are close in the shot.  A quick zoom occurs on Brodys face when he sees the shark, giving us a similar sense of realization as we watch.  Techniques like this bring us viewers into the story and make it relevant to our own lives because we can relate to the emotions we are feeling on screen.
 Close ups aren't the only thing that make Jaws an effective and timeless film.  As I had previously mentioned, lighting plays a role as well.  Silhouettes and shadows lend an eerie and otherworldly, even dangerous, quality to the scenes.  Youre never shown everything.  Shots were taken from beneath the surface of the water up at swimmers implying the perspective of a sea creature.  These shots add to the suspenseful element because paired with the soundtrack of the film you start suspecting that something will come from that depth you are looking at the swimmer from.  The same techniques are used in slasher movies when the camera approaches the unsuspecting victim from behind.  You don't see the attacker but you know they are there.  When the lights flicker and go out in the cabin of the boat near the end of the film the scene then cuts to low lit silhouettes bringing the story from the somewhat lighthearted sense of camaraderie with the men singing together to the dark realization that a shark is hunting them down (and vice versa).
 The shark itself is mostly portrayed through things being pulled through the water.  The ominous presence of the shark can be attributed to the fact that the shark itself is not seen (at least not fully) for a large portion of the film.  Its movement is implied through the dragging of these objects.  The viewer doesnt need to see the shark to know it is there.  When the line on the fishing boat starts being pulled, little by little, you know the shark is responsible and that something in the scene is about to happen.
There is so much to discuss about Jaws and why it stands out, the scene of the nails on the chalkboard disturbing chaos and making even the audience uncomfortable, the boat setting out through the image of shark jaws to remind you what they are setting out to, or even how Hooper and Brodys reaching shore in the closing scene imply a happy ending, because honestly Jaws is filled with so many scenes and well used techniques to warrant its recognition.  It is suspenseful and daring, as well as comical and overall entertaining.  The film brings you in as a viewer to feel a part of the story, as any great film should be able to do.",1461715200,,4840,4.493714285714286

2995256,5,B000X1CMXO,"This movie terrified a generation! Steven Spielberg did everything right when he made this movie.

I have seen this movie many times growing up and I loved it. Although I believe this movie might be the main reason I hated going to the lake when I was younger. This movie came out when my mom was growing up and she wouldn't go in her town lake for a couple of years and she lived in a small town in Northern Utah in the mountains with a man made tiny lake.

My wife had never seen this movie and I wanted her to watch it with me but I didn't want her to watch it until after our honeymoon because we were going to be swimming with sharks (small ones). After we got back I had her watch this movie with me and it scared her to death, but she loved it. After the movie I asked her if she had seen that before if she would have gotten in the water and she said no, which would have made our trip pretty boring considering we went tropical.

Now about the movie.

Spielberg changed the way scary movies were done. For example never giving us a clear shot of the shark until more than halfway through the movie. The musical score is amazing and gets your heart beating and your blood pumping and just builds up the suspense. The dialogue was fun and the script was fantastic. Quints monologue about the U.S.S. Indianapolis is the best and most spine chilling monologue in the movie, and honestly I think it is one of the greatest monologues in movie history.

If you have never seen this movie and are a fan of scary movies I would recommend this one.",1460678400,,1547,4.212837837837838

2995259,5,B000X1CMXO,"The original JAWS is one of my favorite movies.

It is one of the few movie transitions that closely follows the book from which it was adapted.
The movie itself has lost none of its appeal although the fashion of the time does make for some comical moments. It is rare that a movie can combine the dynamics of three powerful actors and have it work so well together. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss pull it off superbly.

I will not go into the plot as I think the only person that does not know it has probably been living off the grid for the last forty-some years. Instead I will focus on the Blu-Ray DVD.

I have owned the VHS and standard DVD versions of this movie. Not too long ago I had to replace my television which I did with a 4k capable model. The resolution was so good I felt it would be worth getting a compatible Blu-Ray player. When I found JAWS on Amazon, I just had to try with the new setup. I was not disappointed.

Universal Studios has embarked on a project to restore and in some cases improve the picture and sound quality of many of its old films. This version of JAWS is one the results of that project.

The restoration of this movie is excellent. The colors are vibrant and true to life. The sound has also been dramatically improved which greatly added to enjoyment of watching it in a surround-sound environment. In a nut shell the restoration efforts take good advantage of todays hi-resolution DVD players, televisions and surround-sound systems.

The DVD comes with a number of extras including the making of Jaws, the impact & legacy of the movie, the restoration process and deleted scenes and outtakes to name a few.

This DVD is one any JAWS fan would do well to add to their collection.",1460592000,8,1742,4.4420062695924765
2995260,1,B000X1CMXO,"most of the one star reviews for Jaws on here are erroneously aimed at the quality of the service of their purchase or the lack of special features on subsequent releases of the film, but my main complaint is that i just don't see what makes this film so great. ive seen it many times, i've caught all the subplots...the greediness of the mayor and keeping the beach open, Brody's frustration, the badass great white hunter getting his just due...all of it. the problem is...where does the necessity of all this overwrought characterization become necessary? its a shark eating swimmers...the end. the shark needs to be found and killed. thats it. no monologues, no overacting, no romantic subplots or endless drunken dialogue. imagine Friday The 13th, a much better horror film, being an hour longer because each character receives the time it takes to force the audience into believing these are REAL people? characterization IS necessary, but when it eats up 80% of the film's running time...you're boring the audience. had this film been made by someone other than Steven Spielberg, it would not have gotten all the awards and praise that it has. the proof is in Jaws 2, a much more entertaining film..an exploitation film...that was not done by Spielberg and deemed an unworthy sequel. its 10 times the fun, and low on boredom. when you're making a film about a killer fish eating teens and swimmers...take the boring parts out of the novel your screenplay is based on and add more action...and less dialogue from drunken fisherman.",1460246400,2,1537,4.915384615384616

2995263,5,B000X1CMXO,"Any individual who has been living and watching movies in approximately the last fifty years has heard of Steven Spielberg, and his legendary films. The film Jaws is one that everyone has heard or seen, whether it be the actual film or a reference on a t-shirt and even social media. At the very least the majority of the population has heard the iconic Jaws theme song by John Williams. This 1975 film is one that can either instill fear of the unknown ocean into the bravest or confirm the 100 plus reasons those that suffer from galeophobia should remain on the beach  like because of 100 plus sharp teeth. While the scenes and shots of the ocean from the beaches of Amity can be pretty terrifying, it is nothing in comparison to the shots of three main characters on a boat in the ocean. Spielberg does a fantastic job of capturing the claustrophobia and suspense of hunting this massive killer in one of the biggest and most open oceans in the world. The underwater shots help to provide an extremely different type of film experience. In example, there are many underwater shots that are from the perspective of the shark. It creates a sort of disorienting feeling, as it is hard to figure whether it is more terrifying or interesting to get this first perspective visual of the monster itself. The dynamic between the chief of police, rich marine scientist, and experienced fisherman also provides a second plot line for the audience. While this movie seems to be one focused around terror and suspense, there is this hero and adventurer undertone to it. Battling one of natures most terrifying hunters in part of the world that is still mainly undiscovered.",1459900800,,1665,4.721649484536083
2995264,5,B000X1CMXO,"When you hear the name Steven Spielberg, a few excellent films come to mind: Saving Private Ryan, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, and last but most definitely not least  Jaws. Jaws has been captivating audiences since it's release in 1975, the film has survived the test of time for a few reasons; for instance the structure of a strong cast. The film is lead by Roy Scheider who does a spectacular job of telling the story of lead character Chief Martin Brody, he is able to use his emotion in the film to tell the audience that there is more than what meets the eye of Chief Brody. The other shining light acting wise in this film is the star Richard Dreyfuss and his portrayal of Matt Hooper; Dreyfuss truly establishes himself as a top tier actor in this film even though it isn't a film where he has the lead role. Dreyfuss exhibits something that is truly difficult to show, and that is believable body language throughout the film, which is what separates high-caliber acting from just average acting. The acting itself isn't the only thing to carry this film into greatness, the score of this film is what truly brings this film into fruition. The score by John Williams is iconic in a way itself.

The score for Jaws is a score that will live on in film history as it is the perfect culmination of story telling and emotion inducing. Everyone recognizes the suspenseful music that goes on throughout the film, and it tells two stories one of the story of the main character, the Shark, and then one of the victims; it portrays the shark as an unstoppable force and it creates an atmosphere which is overpowering to us humans that aren't so relentless. What makes this film truly stand out is the subject manner in the film. Jaws brings out the wrath of one of mother nature's children and causes the fear that is generated from this film to be real; it does something many films have tried to do and some films are still trying to do and it creates a real fear using real-world monsters. Jaws is and will continue to be a contributing factor in the history of film for all these reasons and solidifies the thriller genre as a very important.",1459900800,,2164,4.546153846153846

2995266,5,B000X1CMXO,"SPOILERS AHEAD
Steven Spielbergs Jaws has had a lasting effect on cinema and the public psyche since its release in so many ways. Aside from the fact that the film still (mis)quoted quite often or that suspenseful music plays in our heads whenever were about to sneak up on someone, the film has influenced so many of our other favorite films since its release. The idea of the summer blockbuster began with Jaws. Spielbergs use of a simple plot with a high-concept such as giant man-eating shark has been refurbished for audiences over the last forty years. Ridley Scotts Alien was even marketed to studios as Jaws in space. Jaws is terrifying and comes off as a horror film, even though it lacks some of the persistent iconography that exists in previous films of the genre. However, the remote location out on the ocean takes the places of the isolated haunted mansion and there is a fight between what the audience might consider good vs. evil  unless you find yourself rooting for the shark. Jaws is a film that is able to successfully transcend the genres of both horror and thriller.

The suspense of the film is only made greater by John Williamss score as we quickly realize the music is there not only to set the films tone, but to imply the sharks presence. As the ominous and iconic music builds, we do not even need to see the shark to know he is about to make his grand entrance. Although much of the film takes place on the open ocean, Spielberg utilizes very tight framing within the confines of the Orca to show just how trapped Brody, Quint, and Hooper really are upon their encounter with the shark. With stellar performances drawn from Shaws Captain Ahab impersonation, Dreyfusss comic relief, and Sheiders every-man persona that has you rooting for the sharks explosive demise, Jaws can easily be considered a timeless classic that will continue to influence filmmakers and have new generations of audience members gripping their armrests.",1459814400,,1960,4.778761061946903
2995267,4,B000X1CMXO,"Steven Spielbergs Jaws is a great example of what filmmakers can do to heighten the audiences suspension of disbelief. Modern films rely on the use of CGI to create settings, and creatures that are not real. CGI is used to create a situation that may otherwise may be impossible, yet the audience still has a hard time believing the situation. Before a dependency on CGI was common Jaws was able to create situations, that instilled fear into the audience and did not disturb the suspension of disbelief. One big difference between Jaws and modern films is that the monster, or situation in modern films is given to the audience. There is no mystery or illusion. Jaws leaves a lot to the imagination. Nothing is put in plain sight and leaves a lot of mystery. This paired with good acting and great writing, leaves the audience at the edge of their seats. The icing on the cake is all the practical effects. The use of CGI to dramatically intensify a scene is not believable for a viewer. There is nothing for an audience to relate to because these big Hollywood scenes don't happen in real life. Jaws is grounded in reality. People have seen sharks, sinking boats, and beaches. This is easier to believe entire cities falling apart or big explosions everywhere. The practical effects put the audience in a familiar situation with strange circumstances. This fools the mind into thinking that this could be real. The practical effects to make a physical shark adds to the terror. The textures are believable as opposed to a smooth CGI finish. The shark seems to feel real and not have any questionable ways of movement. The film grounds its plot by delivering emotion through the actors and the illusion of danger. Nothing is more terrifying than what the mind creates, that is why Jaws gives the audience the freedom to fill in the blank spaces instead of using CGI to show everything.",1459728000,,1886,4.735562310030395
2995268,5,B000X1CMXO,"Best thriller of all time. Great acting, great story, and great directing. Probably the most perfect movie of all time. With a rewatchable factor of 100%. Blu ray transfer perfect. Perfect sound and picture.",1459728000,,207,5.117647058823529
2995269,5,B000X1CMXO,"It has been decades since the release of Steven Spielberg's Jaws, and this film stands the test of time. Despite the plot being rather simple and ridiculous in a way, Jaws still manages to create amazing suspense and fear in the audience with brilliant cinematography, amazing characters, and a phenomenal yet simplistic sound track. The plot is simple: there is a killer shark patrolling the waters of an island and the main character Brody has to find a way to deal with this problem.

First of all, the shots in this film are beautifully crafted. Despite the latter half of the film being shot  out in the open seas, the shots remain very still and breathtaking as the audience feels as if they are out in the middle of the sea. The setting of the ocean and an island help create a sense of claustrophobia in an ironic way. Even though there is open space all around you, you feel trapped within the boat amongst the watery abyss.

Secondly, the characters in this film are amazing and bring life to this film. Brody is chief of police and is headstrong about making sure the beaches are safe and no one else dies due to a shark attack. Matt Hooper is an oceanographer, a brilliant yet hotheaded man, who wants to help rid of this killer shark. And Quint as the shark hunter, who is as mysterious as he is creepy. These three main characters help give this film a more realistic feeling to it and helps create amazing interactions between characters.

Finally, the soundtrack is probably the most influential part of this film despite its simplicity.  For what sounds like only two notes, the main theme music of Jaws is memorable. creates a chilling sense of suspense, and is a major part of pop culture. The music in this film stands strong today as it did during its release and proves as an example that the right music can make anything terrifying.",1459641600,,1856,4.578313253012048
2995270,4,B000X1CMXO,"""You're going to need a bigger boat,"" says Brody to Quint.  What makes Jaws such a great film is the way it uses suspense.  Most horror films, especially the classics, like to make the audience feel the sense of being trapped by using tight framing or the use of lines or bars.  Instead, the shots in Jaws mostly contain of the open sea.  Usually when you see open space, you think someone is safe or out of harm's way, but in Jaws, the open space of the water makes a person more vulnerable to where the big great white has more of an opportunity to get you because there's nowhere to hide.  Being in the water means you are entering the monster's territory... and there is no hiding from a monster once you enter its territory.  Jaws shares as many characteristics as any other classic horror film.  Like Halloween, you share the perspective of the killer (Michael Myers in Halloween and the shark in Jaws).  You see what they see.  When the shark swims up to the surface, our perspective matches the shark as we look at his prey splashing in the water from underneath.  With Michael Myers, we also see him stalk his victims.  Along with perspective is the use of color changing from light to dark.  When it is our own perspective, the surface of the water, we see the bright blue sky reflecting on the water, but when we get to the shark's perspective, underwater, there is a darker blue with the shadow of the shark lurking by as it stalks its prey.  It's the leit-motif that really makes Jaws a lasting classic though.  Just like any other classic horror movie monster, the shark in Jaws gets its very own score of music.  It's the sound that lets the audience know when that shark is lurking about, ready to attack and from the first moment we hear it, it is a sound that sticks with us long after the movie is over.",1459641600,,1822,4.397014925373134

What was supposed to be one of the all time bombs at the box office has turned into a favorite classic for all ages. The premise of a huge man eating shark is a stretch, but the terror factor is played to the hilt.
Robert Shaw steals the show as the captain of the boat paid to find and kill the shark. Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss are frustrated in their attempts to convince the business people and mayor of the seasonally vulnerable island community catering to tourist trades that their livelihood is in grave jeopardy unless they close their tourist season after several shark attacks.
Shaw convinces the council and mayor to fund his hunt and Scheider and Dreyfuss hitch a ride to assist. Once they are on the water the fun begins. Shaw was on the US Navy cruiser ""Indianapolis"" in World War II and told the story of that tragedy to set the stage for their own confrontation with the huge shark.
Lots of action and more than a little wry humor to spice things up.
Dreyfuss thought this was the worst film he was ever cast in, but the popularity led him to declare ""What do I know?"". He also did a fine job acting.",1459123200,2,1245,4.347639484978541

It's definitely a classic of cinema. PG, but probably would more accurately pass as PG-13 today for the gore, suggestive dialog and religious profanities.",1455321600,,687,5.035087719298246

2995344,4,B000X1CMXO,One of the classics.  It was still good after so many years.  Roy Scheider does pretty good as the lawman. I think the Jaws shark was the best.  I saw this in the movie theatre when it first came out oh so many years ago.  On the large screen it was pretty scary and now on the TV screen it is still pretty scary.  Love it.

It didn't quite have the shock factor as it did when I first saw it, of course, but the script and the acting felt quaint, rather than hokey, as a lot of the 70's ""classics"" feel. And Robert Shaw! I don't think I realized what a tremendous character he was until now.

If you don't already know this, I wouldn't recommend this for small children. Unless YOU have a terrible fear of the water and you don't want your kids to swim...

2995379,5,B000X1CMXO,"Why is Jaws' titular character one of the scariest movie monsters? Ultimately, it's a common great white shark that lacks the genetic and/or supernatural enhancements expected in horror antagonists. One explanation is its hunting ground, which is a place we cannot imagine anything bad happening. Besides its safety and beautiful weather, Amity Island is perfectly evocative of childhood beach-going memories. Adding terror to this idyllic blend makes it all the more terrifying. The three leads' all-consuming relationship with the beast also explains its near-mythological status. After all, it would take some kind of monster for someone like Hooper to devote his life to studying it and a hell of an encounter for someone like Quint to devote his to turning them into trophies. As for Brody, while hardly a shark expert, his every waking thought concerns stopping a single shark from ruining paradise and harming his family. Regardless, all of these elements could still result in a monster that makes audiences laugh instead of shudder. Spielberg and company prevented this from happening in one of the most famous instances of doing more with less in movie history. Since the mechanical shark prop was too cumbersome for extended use, the director made substitutions such as showing the beast from a first-person perspective and by revealing the aftermaths of its feeding frenzies instead of the shark itself. Besides adding tension, these flourishes make it more possible to imagine the monster not as a shark, but as the stuff of nightmares killing machine that Hooper and Quint describe. John Williams' theme for the shark is another prime example of doing more with less. Its simple repeated phrase not only adds an undercurrent of dread, but also mystery as to when and where the beast will attack. In the end, Jaws proves that a monster does not need an elaborate history or otherworldly origins. With enough movie-making magic, it can simply be an animal looking for its next hot lunch.",1447718400,,1999,5.134969325153374

The story of a shark terrorizing a small town and the terrifying or sometimes idiotic attempts to capture the killing machine is perfect pitch suspense in the hands of Spielberg.

2995413,5,B000X1CMXO,"Noted for being the first summer blockbuster, Steven Spielberg's 1975 adaptation of author Peter Benchley's Jaws was a groundbreaking cinematic achievement. A thriller that continues to terrify audiences to this day, Jaws combines a great story with interesting characters and a threatening monster to create an iconic and timeless movie.

The film takes place in the small New England tourist town of Amity Island. The town is shocked when the remains of a young woman who died of an apparent shark attack washed on shore. Police Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) is determined to protect beach-goers from any further attacks, even if that means closing the beaches. Amity's mayor is equally motivated to keep the beaches open, and enlists oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to examine the remains. But the mayor, sensing a publicity nightmare that would destroy the town's reputation and financial stability, refuses to search for a long term solution to the problem.

When Brody and Hooper discover the remains of another victim, this one with a great white tooth embedded in their boat, they decide to enlist the help of eccentric shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw). The unlikely trio heads out to hunt the animal and restore peace to their small town. Along the way, they learn that they are not facing any ordinary animal. The shark that is preying on their town is a real monster with only one goal. . . killing any person who comes in contact with it.

Jaws is one of those rare horror films that scares not by shock but by imagination. In fact, many of the scenes that do not show Speilberg's monster are far more terrifying than when we actually get to see it. Composer John William's iconic score instantly creates an ever mounting tension that foreshadows the impending doom of the shark's next victim. Populated with unique characters who each receive a fair amount of development, Jaws becomes the standard for a blockbuster film that succeeds through emotional connections, not purely spectacle. The greatest achievement of this classic movie is the way in which Speilberg trusts his audience to imagine things far scarier than anything he could ever put on the screen. Ultimately, Jaws stands the test of time and remains a highlight of Speilberg's illustrious career.",1445472000,,2285,5.0396825396825395

The Blu-ray edition of this film is absolutely fantastic - and is a ""Must Have"" for any movie lover. It's ""JAWS"" like you've never seen it before - with amazingly clear picture and sound, you might even notice some background conversations, sound-effects and details that you've never noticed before in other viewing formats.

I have literally seen the film thousands of times (I tend to watch it at least once or twice a week... sometimes multiple times in one day). I've seen it on Standard TV, HD-TV, VHS, DVD, Blu-ray and in theaters, including in IMAX. This Blu-ray edition, however, is my favorite way to watch it. With the high-quality picture and sound - it truly is the best way to experience this film.

2995460,5,B000X1CMXO,"JAWS is a 5 star adventure movie.  It is as relevant today as it was when it came out in 1975.  It is amusing to know that everything seemed to be going wrong onset but everything that was captured on film was amazing.  The editor of JAWS will never get the full credit they deserve because in someone else's hands the film could have been a bomb instead of a classic.

JAWS is the quintessential summer blockbuster which made over 200 million during its initial release run.  It has all the elements that make a great movie, riveting story, suspense, great acting, wonderful cast, sense of adventure, beautiful music and a great climax.

JAWS made Steven Spielberg a household name and after a few more big budget successes the movie studios would greenlight any future project he wanted.  JAWS is easily one of the best films ever made.  It is hard to image Roy Scheider in any other role than as ""Chief Brody"" or Richard Dreyfuss as ""Hooper"".  Or the captivating scene of Robert Shaw as ""Quint"" describing the sinking of the Indianapolis heavy cruiser.  All 3 actors would go on to star in other major films but they will always be linked and best remembered for their roles in this film
.
JAWS had such a big impact in and out of the Theaters.  It is one of those rare films that kept people out of the water or at least think twice about going into the ocean.  Funny thing is the common mosquito kills thousands of more people each year by spreading diseases than being eaten alive by a great white.  But the terror and idea of some unseen killer below you is much scarier.

The town of Amity could be seen as any costal town in the whole United States, they all survive by the big spring and summer tourist seasons and live bare bones through the late fall and winter.  About midway through the movie, the film takes on more of an adventure element as our 3 hero's go out on their big fishing trip.  While out at sea it is hard to tell who is the hunter and who is being hunted.  One of my favorite scenes in the film is when Quint has the Great White hooked on the big fishing pole and the look on his face as he is bracing to reel in the shark and the fish breaks piano wire line.

For my generation JAWS would be seen as closest to the Titanic phenomenon of the late 1990's.  A movie that kept smashing box office records and was unsinkable at the box office.  JAWS was the same way only 25 years prior in 1975.  It topped Gone with the Wind and held the title of highest grossing movie of all time until Star Wars a few years later.  The current highest grossing movie is Avatar but in no way is it even close to as good a movie as JAWS.  Avatar and a lot of the current movies are seen on 4 times as many screens as films like Jaws and GWTW upon there releases.  The theaters also charge more per ticket than they did back in 1975.

JAWS is a wonderful film, it is frightening and wonderful all at the same time.  I would recommend it to any cinema lover.",1441497600,,2966,4.251785714285714

2995464,5,B000X1CMXO,"I love this movie! Sharks, 70's fashion, an anxious and arrogant Richard Dreyfuss, and of course John Williams' classic terror inducing score all come together for a pleasing cinematic experience.  My young teen son and I can watch this without those awkward ""mature"" scenes found in many films, and the blood/gore is really manageable for this scary-movie-hating mom.
Here is a link to a great interview of Richard Dreyfuss' kids about their feelings growing up with the ""hero"" of Jaws:

2995579,4,B000X1CMXO,"A classic film.  Current news about east coast shark attacks made me remember the movie's treatment of parallel concerns by the tourist industry versus public safety and I remembered that I didn't have copy of my own.  Not any more.  This B-D version was very crisp after the restoration of the original prints.  The sound was good as well.  HD playback  in my home theater made me jump just as the original theater experience did.  The bonus material was an education in film making.  The director and crew turned monumental production problems into what was probably an even better movie.  Problems with the mechanical shark made its appearance on the screen limited and created a ""less is more"" result.",1437091200,,705,4.857142857142857
2995580,5,B000X1CMXO,Despite being such an old movie it holds up quite well.,1437091200,,55,4.090909090909091
2995581,4,B000X1CMXO,"I'm surprised Criterion hasn't gotten their hands on this movie and remastered it, as it sure would be nice to see a high quality transfer.  Hard to believe  that it was 40 years ago that Jaws scared everyone out of the water, but times have changed and recently a group of beach goers rescued a beached Great White on a Cape Cod beach.  What would Sheriff Brody have thought of that?

I grew up in Redneck Riviera, near Navarre, Florida, where the second Jaws movie was filmed, as it was cheaper to do so than Martha's Vineyard, where this movie was made.  Universal Studios threw a bundle of money behind this movie and were rewarded handsomely.  Spielberg had nothing to do with the awful shark movies that followed.  Unfortunately, these films inspired shark rodeos all along the panhandle of Florida with just about every trawler hauling in some kind of shark, usually sand sharks, hanging them on racks to be measured and slaughtered.  Shark jaws could be found in all the local shops and shark's teeth became popular to wear around the neck.  It took years for this mania to die down.

Now, we can look back nostalgically at this film and admire it for what it was -- an escapist summer movie with some great performances, notably by the late great Robert Shaw and Roy Scheider.  Richard Dreyfus was the new kid on the block as oceanographer Hooper, who Spielberg decided to save in the movie.  Hooper met a pretty gruesome end in Peter Benchley's book.  Still, the star of the show was Jaws, a latter-day incarnation of Moby-Dick meant to thrill audiences moreso than make them think.",1437091200,,1592,4.663082437275985

I felt a little disinterested in the first portions, and almost felt like leaving to do something else. I knew what was going to happen despite not really knowing anything about this film. The later parts really pulled me in, however, as the characters started developing more and the atmosphere began getting really tense. At this point I didn't know what to expect, and was really pleased with what did.

2995677,5,B000X1CMXO,"I have always been perplexed why Hollywood thought they needed sequels to this great film. As far as I know, Peter Benchley who penned the original novel never wrote a sequel, and Spielberg declined to direct Jaws II. Of course the answer is the producers and executives believed they would make even more money off the Jaws franchise, particularly among those who just could not get enough of the original. But as an artistic statement, this movie really doesn't warrant sequels as it covers just about everything you could possibly do with the subject. Aside from the shark killings themselves, the characters and the audience actually learn a little bit about sharks, there are political ""currents"" regarding whether or not to close the beaches, forces more interested in profits than safety are exposed, and there is even the lynching of a poor tiger shark which turned out to be a case of mistaken identity, i.e. he wasn't ""the shark"". I always felt sorry for the little innocent tiger shark.

Two characters represent somewhat opposing views of the knowledge spectrum concerning their understanding of sharks: an expert scientist from the oceanographic society, Matt Hooper played by Richard Dreyfus, and a fisherman who makes his living catching sharks and other large sea animals, Quint played with convincing realism by the immortal Robert Shaw. Quint is not college-educated but he learned his trade through direct experience. Late in the film when Hooper and Quint are asked to sign on to a charter to kill the shark, their worlds collide. At interesting points, both characters misjudge the shark. Roy Scheider as Chief Brody, who used to defend innocent victims from mobsters in New York, finds his number-one most wanted man in Amity is not a human being but a shark. He ends up playing referee between Hooper and Quint. But as the last segment unfolds, we find Quint has some ulterior motives which may run contrary to killing the shark.

The brilliant dramatic decision which pushed this movie into the realm of par excellence (rather than merely very good) is the delay in seeing the shark for nearly half the film. Despite the posters which show a young woman enjoying a care-free swim in the ocean with a large set of teeth propelling toward her from the depths like a menacing underwater rocket, the audience never actually experiences this scene as shown. Yes, the young swimmer is the first victim, but you never see her killer, sort of akin to a murder mystery in which you see and hear the victim's demise but you don't see the murderer. Certainly, the title of the film JAWS is a give-away as to the identity of the perpetrator, but the story begins as a kind of mystery, and almost immediately, the politics of the town begins to encroach on the decisions of Chief Brody who is mainly concerned with public safety. In one of the most memorable scenes, Brody and Hooper come upon the remains of the shark's destructive power without actually seeing the shark itself.

This film was Steven Spielberg's big-time debut into the upper echelons of cinema. All kinds of interesting camera techniques are used to heighten dramatic and suspenseful effects. He even borrows a couple of trademark tricks from Hitchcock and Welles. The cast is A-list, although none of them were and ever have been big movie stars, but simply top tier actors doing what they do best. As the producers pointed out, the star of the film was the shark himself, so there was no need to put big name stars into the feature. If there is a standout in the acting department, I think it would have to go to Robert Shaw as Quint who is absolutely believable as the rough-and-ready harpooner, ""sharker"" and World War II veteran, a modern equivalent of Captain Ahab of Moby Dick fame. This is one of the all-time great action/suspense films, but don't waste your time on the ridiculous sequels. I think the original says all that needs to be said.",1433808000,,3933,4.823703703703703

2995697,5,B000X1CMXO,"I have friends and family ask me all the time (and they know I am a HUGE movie and movie history buff) :  ""What is your favorite movie?""  I say JAWS.  They laugh out loud and say things like...""are you kidding me that shark looked so fake"" etc.  Yes, but for 1975 that shark looked pretty damn good by the standards of even today with all the CGI crap that looks worse.  In fact, it was so convincing they rarely even had to show it. Take a note horror movie directors.

This movie is really not about a fake looking shark. It's about an offshore tragedy, how a seaside community responds, the people the places etc. of Amity Island (playing Martha's Vineyard, I suppose). This film is really about acting in an a seafaring adventure.  The 3 main actors are perfectly positioned for each other.  Police Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) is afraid of the water, but very level headed and wants to protect everyone.  Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) is the scientist from the Oceanographic Institute and has just arrived on the scene to help Chief Brody.  (He might as well be from Wood's Hole) Then comes along our Ahab, or shark pirate in Quint (Robert Shaw) the best blue collar seaman of all time. It's a match in heaven for me. Oh, but they still gotta catch and kill that bastard 25 footer (3 ton of 'em)

This movie for me has all the elements that make a great film:  Great acting, great plot, great storyline, great scenery, great effects, great beaches, great ocean adventure, great horror, great action, great research, filmed on the ocean and not in a water tank...blah blah blah.  Great Soundtrack...two major notes or whatever the theme is.  Finally the little Gem:  Robert Shaw's (Quint's) USS Indianapolis speech may be the best single scene in all of Hollywood history.

2995700,5,B000X1CMXO,"Jaws, 1975 film

It is night on the ocean. A buoy clangs its warnings. Young people are sitting around a campfire at night. A couple goes to the water's edge. The girl goes in alone and finds an unpleasant surprise. She screams, then all is quiet. The next morning a man gets a telephone call. There are body parts on the beach, with crabs. What will they do? Amity Island is a small town that depends on summer tourism, the Town Council does not want the beaches closed. Will the truth be covered up? We see people in the water. ""That's some bad hat, Harry."" Where did that dog go? ""Did you see that?"" People rush from the water. Where is Alex? The Town Council wants this news suppressed. Will they close the beaches? One man offers to catch the shark for $10,000. Quint says ""you know me"".

Chief Brody does research on sharks. Two men try to catch a shark with bait. The dock collapses! ""Swim, Charlie, swim!"" They can go home now. People volunteer to hunt this shark. Matt Hooper from the Ocean Institute arrives. Its not a boat accident, it's a very large squalus. One shark was caught. Hooper measures its mouth for the bite radius. Mrs. Kintner objects to Chief Brody's failure to close the beach. Can you believe the reports on the news? Most shark attacks are about ten feet from shore in three feet of water. The shark is still out there. The boat sails at night. They find a small boat. Hooper gets a shock! ""It's a great white."" The Mayor's politics override any warnings. Brody says they need men with guns and boats. Tourists arrive for the July Fourth weekend. All seems peaceful, but nobody is in the water yet. Some boys go sailing in the pond, others in the ocean. The people see something in the water. You see the reactions as they race for the beach. False alarm?

The shark appears in the pond and gets a man. Larry seems confused, but he will sign the voucher. Quint presents his terms for hunting the shark. Hooper will go along on this fishing expedition. [Note how the story changes focus here.] They throw bait into the water to attract sharks (""chumming""). Noise from the reel sends a signal: a bite on the line. They change course. Brody sees the shark. Quint and Hooper compare scars in a bonding ceremony. We hear about the USS Indianapolis in 1945. It was torpedoed and only 316 of the 1,100 survived. Then bumping noises alarms them, something is hitting the boat.

Quint fires a rifle into the sea to no effect. A barrel floats close to the boat. The shark is back. Quint puts another harpoon and barrel into the shark. Tying the line to the boat? There is a problem with the boat. Hooper will try to stab the shark in the mouth. [Sounds easy?] The shark-proof cage is lowered into the ocean. What if it fails? The shark attacks the cage! Next it attacks the stern and weighs it down. Quint slides towards it. Brody throws a tank of compressed air. The ship lists to port. Brody climbs to mast with his Garand. He spears the shark. Next he shoots at it. One shot hits the air tank for an explosive result. The shark leaves the half-sunken boat. There is a new development for a happy ending. [What's next?]

Note the message from the ending to this story. Was it an echo of ""Moby Dick""? Why should the most experienced sailor be the lone victim? Its still a good movie, but not as impressive after 35 years. Note the presence of firearms, would they do that today? [Shouldn't Quint have used an exploding harpoon to finish off that shark? It kills bigger fish.]

I wonder why Quint didn't take any explosives along. An exploding harpoon would have quickly ended the attack; it kills the much large whales. The use of a military rifle to kill the monster must have kept this film off broadcast TV for many years. One version used electronic editing to remove the guns used in the early part of this film! This reflects the corporate politics for gun prohibition, and the mocking of the armed people who respond to the threat of the shark.
There were attacks along the Jersey Shore in 1916. There are two books that go into more detail. Note the freedom to keep and bear arms then.",1432166400,,4114,4.464095744680851

2995714,5,B000X1CMXO,"I was born in 1974 and for whatever reason never saw the movie in its entirety.  Even in 2015, this movie still holds its own perfectly.  Brilliantly written, acted, and directed, the times were rare when my thoughts wandered enough to consider that this movie was made before all the technology we have today. The shark is stunning, terrifically accurate, and terrifying.  The musical score is both parts suspense and adventure, creating a dichotomy between whimsy and horror that works in conjunction with that masterful visual onscreen imagery. The movie just breaths this time period, the ocean, and the quest of a man with secrets desperately trying to protect against ""nature"". Highly recommended.

Parents Should Watch Out For:
Alcohol/Smoking/Drug Use:
Because this movie was made in 1974, there is a lot (as in most of the central characters) of socially acceptable smoking and drinking.  There is also a short shot of drug use at the very beginning of the movie.
Nudity/Sexuality:
There is some female side view nudity and full frontal (although very blurry due to woman being in water) nudity.  There is a suggestion of two young people swimming naked together.  There is also a comment between a married couple about ""messing around"".  There is kissing between a married couple. There are also a few sexually inappropriate jokes made by one of the characters.
Violence:
This is a movie about sharks attacks so there are definitely many of those.  Most of the action happens below the water though until the final act of the film.  At the point where you start to see more of the shark, expect to see attack sequences with blood, teeth, and some mangled limbs. There is also arguing between characters, a few swings of a bat, characters get hit and injured while on the boat, and one person is slapped by another. It is implied that dog is lost or possibly killed off screen.  A dead fish is strung up and later gutted.
Adult Themes:
A descriptive war story is told with high causalities although most children may not understand the content.",1431216000,,2053,4.870689655172414

3229305,5,B000X1CMXO,"In this, probably the VERY first ""Summer Blockbuster"" as it would be known today, we have a fully RESTORED version on Blu-ray HD! Wow! Is it every bit of glorious fun as it ever was 40 odd years ago. In 1975, Steven Spielberg set out to make a ""splash"" with JAWS. Before that date, there had been no movie about The Great White shark and what it could do wreaking havoc on a summer vacation Island, if you will. The idea was set, now to make the movie happen.
Remember folks, no CGI. All props. I think Steven and the Crew did a great job on all aspects of this movie, even recording behind the scenes footage, deleted scenes, etc. It's a masterpiece of Cinema film making to this date.
If you get a group of film goers together and say ""What summer movie can you name right off that's exciting, yet tense and horrific?"" The answer would most likely be JAWS.
THIS is the Edition you want to get. Flawless and Restored as it should be with a great DTS HD 7.1 mix and other mixes, of course in Audio.
This movie has one of the most ICONIC musical scores ever on screen. Anyone that has seen this movie KNOWS when you hear that first few notes of the song, you are talking JAWS.
See this movie in June or July, perhaps August. Whatever you do, make sure you have your sound way up when seeing it!

I then was prompted to order both aforementioned movies, and enjoy them greatly, knowing that today, their filming would have my neighbor as the nemesis rather than a shark, and the other film would be recast and re-titled as the [Confused Family Robinperson], the cast on some remote island, finding creative ways to develop a soap-opera environment, rather than just have some fun as they survived another day within their fantasy setting.

Jaws is easily without question one of the all time greatest movies ever, and it is also been my favorite movie ever since I first saw it in it's full entirety when I was 11, and it is still my favorite movie to this very day. I just absolutely love this movie. I could just watch it over and over and never grow tired of it at all whatsoever. Penned as the original summer blockbuster, this 1975 film classic forever set the standards for the edge-of-your seat suspense and instantly became a cultural phenomenon, shattered box office records and forever changed the movie industry. Directed by legendary director Steven Spielberg, and also featuring an unforgettable soundtrack score courtesy of John Williams, Jaws remains one of Hollywood's most influential and gripping adventures in motion picture history. The film itself also received an Academy Award nominee for Best Picture (""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" would go on to win that award), but it would go on to win three other Academy Awards including for film editing (Verna Fields), music score (John Williams) and best sound (Robet Hoyt, Roger Heman, Earl Madery and John Carter) as well. And yes, while Steven Spielberg would go on to direct other masterpieces such as ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial"", ""Jurassic Park"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", etc, but Jaws in my humble opinion remains Spielberg's ultimate and definitive masterpiece hands down, and it would also put Spielberg on the map and forever made him a household name director wise as well. Being such a huge fan of Jaws, I am very happy and fortunate to own several VHS and DVD copies (including the 1983 MCA Home Video VHS release) and of course this Blu-Ray edition which I'm gonna be reviewing at this time.

Based on Peter Benchley's best selling novel of the same name and shot on location on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, the film's story centers around a giant man-eating great white shark wreaking havoc on beachgoers in the fictional New England summer resort town of Amity Island thus prompting the town's local police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) to join forces with old grizzled shark fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) and young marine biologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to put an end to the monster's reign of aquatic terror once and for all. The film itself is also notorious for it's troubled production which included having a troubled shoot and going far over budget and past schedule, as well as the full-sized mechanical monster shark nicknamed ""Bruce"" having frequently malfunctioned at sea during filming in the Atlantic Ocean, and among other things. However Spielberg and the rest of his crew would manage to turn what could've been a major disaster into a triumphant and timeless masterpiece.

The story

The films starts off with a young girl named Chrissie Watkins who leaves a party on Amity Island and decides to go for a swim. While swimming out near a buoy, Chrissie is soon seized by something from below, and she is then violently thrashed around and pulled under the ocean. Chrissie Watkins' death scene in the opening of the movie is unquestionably one of the most legendary scenes in the history of film ever.

The next day, Amity police chief Martin Brody investigates the problem after finding Chrissie's partial remains on the shore. The medical examiner informs Brody that Chrissie's death was due to a shark attack. Brody plans to close the beaches but is overruled by the town's mayor Larry Vaughn, who fears that reports of a shark attack will ruin the summer tourist season, the town's primary source of income. The medical examiner consequently attributes the death to a boating accident. Brody reluctantly goes along with the explanation. The shark then kills a young boy named Alex Kintner while swimming at the town beach. His mother places a bounty on the shark, sparking an amateur shark-hunting frenzy and attracting the attention of local professional shark hunter Quint, who offers to hunt and kill the shark for $10,000. Meanwhile, Brody enlists the help of marine biologist Matt Hooper who examines Chrissie's remains and determines that she was killed by a shark, not a boat. A large tiger shark is caught by fishermen, leading the townspeople to believe the problem is solved. Hooper asks to examine its stomach contents, but Vaughn refuses. That night, Brody and Hooper secretly open the shark's stomach and discover that it does not contain any human remains. They head out to sea on Hooper's boat to find the shark, but instead find the wreckage of a half-sunken boat belonging to local fisherman Ben Gardner. Hooper explores the vessel underwater and discovers a sizable great white shark's tooth embedded inside the damaged hull before he is startled by Gardner's partial corpse, causing him to drop the tooth. Without evidence, Vaughn refuses to close the beaches or hire Quint to hunt and kill the shark.

Many tourists arrive on the Fourth of July. A prank by two kids with a cardboard cut-out of a shark fin causes panic at the main beach while the real great white shark enters a nearby estuary and kills a man in a rowboat. Brody's son Michael, who narrowly escapes the attack, goes into shock. Brody finally convinces Vaughn to hire Quint, and Quint reluctantly allows Hooper and Brody to join in on the hunt. The three heroes set out to sea to kill the shark aboard Quint's vessel, The Orca.

While at sea, Brody is given the task of laying a chum line, and as he is chucking away chum and blood away over his shoulder to attract the shark, suddenly an enormous great white looms up behind the boat startling Brody which then leads him to reply to Quint: ""You're gonna need a bigger boat!"" As the trio watches the shark circle around the Orca, Quint estimates it's size as twenty-five feet in length, with a weight of over three tons. He harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears. We then get to my favorite scene in the movie where our heroes retire to the vessel's cabin that night, where they show off and compare each other's scars and wounds, and Quint relates his experiences with sharks as a survivor of the tragic sinking of the USS Indianapolis. This is definitely my favorite scene in the whole movie here. The dialogue delivered by Robert Shaw in this particular scene is just absolutely brilliant and impeccable, and also very chilling beyond words, you just can't even dare to take your eyes off the screen when he delivers that speech. It is just pure genius. And as the trio are singing ""Show Me the Way to Go Home"", the shark suddenly returns, damages the hull and slips away. It reappears the next morning. Brody attempts to call the U.S. Coast Guard, but Quint destroys the radio, enraging Brody. After a long chase, Quint harpoons two more barrels to the shark, and the men tie them both to the stern, but the shark drags the boat backwards, forcing water onto the deck and flooding the engine. Quint severs the line to prevent the transom from being cut. He then heads toward shore, hoping to draw it into shallow waters and suffocate it. In his obsession to kill the shark, Quint burns out the Orca's engine.

With the boat immobilized, the trio attempt a desperate approach: Hooper dons scuba gear and enters the ocean inside a shark proof cage, intending to lethally inject the shark with a hypodermic spear filled with strychnine. The shark attacks and demolishes the cage from behind, causing Hooper to drop the spear before he can inject it. When the shark becomes entangled in the wrecked cage, Hooper escapes and hides in the seabed. The shark then leaps onto the boat and attacks it directly, crushing the transom. Quint slides down the deck and is devoured alive by the shark. When the shark attacks again, Brody shoves a pressurized scuba tank into its mouth, then takes Quint's rifle and climbs the sinking Orca's mast. The shark, with the tank still in its mouth, begins swimming toward Brody, who shoots the tank, causing it to explode and blowing the shark to pieces. Hooper swims to the surface and he and Brody use the barrels to swim back to shore.

All in all, Jaws is just absolutely perfect on every level of movie making. The characters are so incredibly well developed, so well that the audience can feel their fears, emotions and of course stupidity when they're supposed to. The screenplay courtesy of Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb is also very tight and well written, and Spielberg's direction is just downright masterful and top notch throughout. His timing is superb and he does an incredible job at mixing suspense, horror, comedy and adventure to brilliant and genuine effect. He really makes the audience feel like they are nothing but puppets in his fingers and the way he pulls peoples strings whenever he wants them to feel whether it be scared or horrified or even amused is just masterfully done. For a good example, take Alex Kintner's death scene. It all starts with a bunch of people playing on the beach and in the water while Brody is watching intently. We along with Brody hear playful screams from a young girl, and then we see a young man and his dog playing fetch the stick, and then later when the stick is floating in the water, the dog is nowhere to be found. Then we finally see young Alex who goes out into the water with his raft. More kids are then seen splashing around, and following that, there's a shot approaching Alex paddling away on his raft from underwater thus showcasing the shark's point of view, and then composer John Williams' music hits and of course we all know what happens from that moment on. That scene just shows how truly masterful Spielberg can be at manipulating the audiences by showing the shark's point of view via camera rather than showing the shark entirely in the early stages of the film. And of course, that's what made Jaws so gripping is that Spielberg didn't show his monster until most of the second half of the film. Until then, you only saw people in the water reacting to attacks, screaming and writhing as the invisible killer underneath them turned the water blood red. The music score courtesy of John Williams is what really drives this brilliant piece of cinema from the very beginning to the very end. If there's one specific word to decribe Williams' score in Jaws and that one word would have to be 'incredible' especially that infamous main shark theme (which is a simple alternating pattern of two notes - variously identified as ""E and F"" or 'F and F sharp"") which is no doubt a classic piece of suspense music, and is very synonymous with danger approaching. According to John, the main theme was meant to represent the shark as an instinctual, relentless and unstoppable force. Whenever you hear that theme, you know danger is approaching and things are definitely getting serious here.

The acting from the cast in the film not to also mention is very brilliant in every sense of the word as well. You've got Roy Scheider who gives an amazing performance as Amity police chief Martin Brody, the film's main hero as he is determined to close the beaches and protect the beachgoers despite Mayor Larry Vaughn's objections, and he also has his fear of the ocean put to the ultimate test along the way. Richard Dreyfuss is also perfectly cast as Matt Hooper, the young marine biologist whom Brody calls in to lend a hand with the shark crisis and he also tends to land in some very funny bits in along the way especially during the scene in which he and Quint are comparing each others scars, and of course, you've got Robert Shaw whose memorable performance as Quint, the crusty, old and grizzled shark hunter whose character is both funny at times and very chilling at others as well. His famous Indianapolis speech is without question absolutely chilling and powerful beyond words, and I always find myself memorizing every single line from his speech everytime I watch that scene. Just absolutely pure genius. The overall chemistry of Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss is just absolute perfection as seen in the second half when they're all out at sea on Quint's vessel, The Orca, and it showcases the growing respect and bond among the three men. You also have Lorraine Gary who is excellent as Brody's wife Ellen who is also the mother of Brody's two young sons, Michael (Chris Rebello) and Sean (Jay Mello), and Murray Hamilton is also fantastic as the town's mayor Larry Vaughn who despite Brody's warnings is more concerned about the summer economy and keeping the beaches open.

Now, as for the Blu-Ray edition here goes, it is just absolutely amazing, and not to also mention the overall picture quality and sound is just top notch. It's also filled with a boatload of awesome bonus material which includes a documentary entitled, ""The Shark is Still Working"" which is narrated by Scheider himself, and provides an amazing in-depth look at the trials and tribulations into the making of this film and how Spielberg took what could've been a terrible disaster in resulting in having his directing career sink to the bottom, but triumphantly turned Jaws into a timeless masterpiece that continues to keep generations out of the water and also inspire those to get into the film business at the same time. Bottom line, Jaws is an absolute masterpiece of suspense and terror. Absolutely brilliant in every sense of the word, and they'll never be another masterpiece like it...Period!!!

However, you have not thought about the film than we humans may be more frightening in the great white shark? We can see from the human point of view, because we are a group of ideas, but we can justifiably hurt the other different types of creature, and even harm people to fulfill their own selfish desires.

3229544,5,B000X1CMXO,"Included is a short interview with Spielberg wondering why this Blu-ray reissue looks and sounds as good as it is. He says that the original negatives that the restoration team scanned were in bad condition. Spielberg goes so far to say that audiences watching the Blu-ray version are experiencing better picture and sound quality than theatre audiences back in 1976. For the most part, he's right.

The biggest improvements come in the famous night scenes on the beach that open the movie. Darks are richer and darker rather than fuzzy and hazy. Shots of the ocean after the shark attack on the swimmer are silvery and rich. The many ripples in the ocean are sharp. You can tell DP Butler and Spielberg put lots of work into these opening shots which was not apparent in the DVD version.

This movie is such a legend that I can't say much more about it. If it's over-rated, it's over-rated only by a little bit. It suffers from its final 30 minutes, which feature many improbabilities all crowned by an unlikely (but satisfying) climax. ""Smile you son of a b---."" It's always a great moment,  but really now...

John Williams' famous score--comprehending everything from The Rite Of Spring to La Mer and Baroque fugues--sounds about the same as the DVD, only louder and more immediate. Sound effects are more immediate as well, especially during the last half hour.

This movie is one of the few older classics that has appeared on the CNet list of Top 40 Blu-rays for over a year, competing with all those superhero movies and Pixar cartoon movies. It really is one of those classics that you can't go wrong with, even if it may not be your favorite movie.",1470960000,,1658,4.683848797250859

3229590,5,B000X1CMXO,"Not so much a reviewer as a regurgitator as I won't be saying anything new; still, I want my two cents in. Jaws has snagged a place in landmark cinema. It holds bragging rights as the movie that launched the summer blockbuster. Before that summer of 1975, popular thought amongst the studio execs and marketing savants was that only kids ventured to the movie theater during them hot summer days. Jaws forever changed that landscape. Jaws was a B-movie creature feature that was elevated to box office gold, courtesy of savvy, improvised filmmaking, a superlative cast, and an insanely aggressive marketing campaign. It's almost like the movie-going audience had no choice but to flock to the theaters.

Did you know shark attacks can happen in three feet of water, ten feet away from the beach? Jaws was awful mean to beach tourism as that bit of enterprise plummeted in the summer of '75. Everyone was just too scared to go into the water. I guess there weren't too many intrepid police chiefs, ichthyologists, or shark hunters around to ease the anxious revelers. Luckily for the New England island resort community of Amity, all three types eventually converged to take on a freakish, three-ton, 25-foot-long Great White predator that's staked claim to the waters around Amity. It certainly doesn't contribute to anyone's peace of mind that that guy (Richard Dreyfuss) from the Oceanographic Institute keeps saying ominous stuff like ""What we are dealing with here is a perfect engine, an eating machine."" To belay such alarmism, the mayor, shoveling deep into the mercantile politics of resort tourism, tells the press: ""Amity, as you know, means friendship."" He insists that the beaches be kept open for the 4th of July holiday. It's all good, the water's fine. The water's not fine.

Adapting Peter Benchley's best-seller, Jaws' biggest triumph is in humanizing its cast for maximum intrigue and empathy. The folks we meet onscreen feel like real people, squabble and get frightened and bond like real people. Take Amity's police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) whose distaste for open water is revealed early on. Chief Brody hates water so much he stays in the car whenever on the ferry ride to the mainland. And yet he's gutsy enough to challenge the mayor when that fool puts commerce before saving lives, and gutsy enough to join in on the shark hunt on the Orca, Quint's 29-foot fish trawler. Oh, man, and Quint. Robert Shaw grabs the film's most colorful part as the crazed, cranky old sea dog, Quint, hired by Amity to hunt and kill the Great White. He's got the best acting moment, too, as he delivers a chilling and utterly mesmerizing monologue about his wartime experience on (and then off) the USS Indianapolis. Up-and-comer Richard Dreyfuss adds tremendous energy and likability as ichthyologist Matt Hooper who brings doomed hi-tech gadgetry to the fray. This trio's layered interactions went a long way into convincing us to give a crap about what happens to them.

There are several gory moments, but not as many as you'd think. Young director Steven Spielberg and his crew had a torturous time of it shooting the movie; wasn't long before it dawned on all that they were dealing with an albatross, a dead weight. Things just kept going wrong. The movie was over-budget and crept past its original finishing time. Spielberg had these three mechanical sharks - collectively called ""Bruce"" after Spielberg's lawyer - with which he was gonna shoot many more shark attacks than what we ended up with. Except the mechanical sharks kept breaking down, thus forcing Spielberg to come up with a work-around. The result, amazingly, is a movie that unfolds more like an elegant Hitchcock suspenser than a B-movie horror schlocker. Spielberg had to be sparing in how much he showed the shark. Instead, he relied more on establishing mood and atmosphere and memorable character beats... and on John Williams' inspired, driving score. Much of the unease felt by the theater audience was rooted in their imagination's doing most of the heavy lifting. And there's something to be said about a shark being a real creature - as opposed to some sci-fi monster - that plays havoc with our primal fears. A shark is real, yo, a frightening true-to-life ""miracle of evolution."" This sh-- could actually happen. And me for the inside pool.",1468713600,,4341,4.9519890260631

3229628,5,B000X1CMXO,"The classic movie that will have you terrified of the ocean. Its pretty much a given that after seeing this, everytime you go swimming in the ocean this movie will be in the back of your mind. Its really unfortunate that they had to make three abysmal sequels to this great movie. They should have left it alone at this one. You know, if you think about it, if this movie had been made today, the shark would have been cgi, would have had far more screen time, and would be forgettable, but I digress. They just don't make movies like this anymore.

I don't have to go over the plot, we all know it by now. Ill just share a couple of my thoughts about the movie. The first half of the movie, while good, is nothing spectacular. Its the last half when Brody, Hooper, and Quint are out on the boat hunting the great white that makes this movie what it is. Its very intense, includeds some great bonding scenes between the men, and some great dialouge like Quint telling his story about the U.S.S Indianapolis. Spielburg wisely keeps the shark out of view most of the movie until the famous scene where Brody is throwing chum in the water and we see the shark for the first time. His reaction is perfect, and quietly says to Quinn, ""We're gonna need a bigger boat."" From then on its heart pounding suspense as the men try to kill the shark, and shark tries to do likewise to them.

This movie is a classic that everyone should see, and filmakers today should learn from, because nothing they make today even comes close to being this good.",1467158400,,1536,4.3671328671328675

It's amazing that they could get true blacks and such depth out from the old grainy stock. The only thing lacking is the sound; don't get me wrong, it's good, but the music (which is an integral part of this movie) is a little more muted than previous releases. Watch it in MONO sound and It packs a little more punch; but it's not as much in the foreground when on DTS or Dolby digital. It's just my one little quib, but the picture more than makes up for it.

If you have not seen this movie yet, the only thing I have to say to you is, ""Why haven't you seen it?"" OK, so you love the beach and love to swim. I can understand that. I do too. However, you should see it, especially with all the recent shark attacks that have happened. When I first saw it, shark attacks were very, very, very rare. But JAWs still scared me enough to keep me in very shallow water all summer. Now it will probably keep you out of the water for quite a while, especially in the areas where Great Whites are being spotted. Talk about adrenalin rushes. If that's not enough of a reason for anyone to see this movie for the first time, or for the 100th time, I don't know what is!",1465084800,14,809,4.0625

I will say that I enjoy comparing movies with the book or story they are based on.  I purchased the book after seeing the movie.  I wished I had done it the other way around.  The book was OK.  The movie was better than the book.

The movie is a true thriller.  Tension is built while seeing very little of the shark.  The movie also does a great job of humanizing the characters.  The interactions of the chief and his son is heartwarming.  The pathos of a mother of a dead child is extremely accurately conveyed.  At this point In time, there is also a certain time capsule aspect to this movie that I greatly enjoy now.  This movie now provides a great viewing experience.

I will not bother reviewing the movie for its plot or production values, that has been done by many others here. But I will say that when the movie was released in 1975, I thought it was a bit overrated after having looked forward very much to seeing it, but upon viewing it recently on TV and then purchasing this Blu-ray and viewing it in even better high-definition quality than on TCM, I enjoy the story itself more, and I'm very glad at having purchased this Blu-ray.",1463011200,3,731,4.801587301587301

3229734,5,B000X1CMXO,"Jaws, now an iconic American film, was a film built around the premise of suspense.  Why was the film so successful?  What separated this film from other scary movies from the 70s & why are we still talking about it in 2016?  To begin with, the soundtrack of the film utilizes an escalating trombone to instill tense, dramatic, and suspenseful moments in the film and counter it with silence, another tool of suspense, to build to those moments through emotion before the action starts.
Throughout the film they utilize the technique of matching eye lines across cuts to form continuity and the illusion that these two separate images are looking into each others eyes.  Most notably this is seen in the opening scene with the kids on the beach.  The guy is in one cut looking to the right, in the next cut the girl is looking to the left of the screen.  This implies eye contact between these two characters, a method used commonly in film making nowadays.  Lighting was also used effectively for continuity purposes in Jaws, using the angle of light to indicate that people are in different sides of the room in different shots, primarily in the cabin of the ship at night when the men are out hunting the shark.  In fact, certain shots of individuals faces make this movie stand out because of the effect they have.  In one of the first few scenes with the character of Brody the camera moves with Brody as he walks through crowds of people along the dock.  Were following him because he is the main character, & the use of the camera like this shows the audience this in a subtle way.  Close ups of peoples faces can also do a number of things as are shown in this film.  They can make you wonder what the character is thinking and bring you inside their head, or they can bring you, the viewer into the scene, creating a feeling of intensity or shock.  Intensity is created when close shots are taken in the water during the shark attacks bringing you into the moment.  Shock is found in the close up of the womans face staring straight at the camera when she sees a fin in the water.  Because of the close up, as a viewer, you can relate to her emotions and feel the shock for yourself.  In one of the many beach scenes close ups and wide range shots are used to show our main character Brody viewing the water beyond the people who are close in the shot.  A quick zoom occurs on Brodys face when he sees the shark, giving us a similar sense of realization as we watch.  Techniques like this bring us viewers into the story and make it relevant to our own lives because we can relate to the emotions we are feeling on screen.
 Close ups aren't the only thing that make Jaws an effective and timeless film.  As I had previously mentioned, lighting plays a role as well.  Silhouettes and shadows lend an eerie and otherworldly, even dangerous, quality to the scenes.  Youre never shown everything.  Shots were taken from beneath the surface of the water up at swimmers implying the perspective of a sea creature.  These shots add to the suspenseful element because paired with the soundtrack of the film you start suspecting that something will come from that depth you are looking at the swimmer from.  The same techniques are used in slasher movies when the camera approaches the unsuspecting victim from behind.  You don't see the attacker but you know they are there.  When the lights flicker and go out in the cabin of the boat near the end of the film the scene then cuts to low lit silhouettes bringing the story from the somewhat lighthearted sense of camaraderie with the men singing together to the dark realization that a shark is hunting them down (and vice versa).
 The shark itself is mostly portrayed through things being pulled through the water.  The ominous presence of the shark can be attributed to the fact that the shark itself is not seen (at least not fully) for a large portion of the film.  Its movement is implied through the dragging of these objects.  The viewer doesnt need to see the shark to know it is there.  When the line on the fishing boat starts being pulled, little by little, you know the shark is responsible and that something in the scene is about to happen.
There is so much to discuss about Jaws and why it stands out, the scene of the nails on the chalkboard disturbing chaos and making even the audience uncomfortable, the boat setting out through the image of shark jaws to remind you what they are setting out to, or even how Hooper and Brodys reaching shore in the closing scene imply a happy ending, because honestly Jaws is filled with so many scenes and well used techniques to warrant its recognition.  It is suspenseful and daring, as well as comical and overall entertaining.  The film brings you in as a viewer to feel a part of the story, as any great film should be able to do.",1461715200,,4840,4.493714285714286

3229753,5,B000X1CMXO,"This movie terrified a generation! Steven Spielberg did everything right when he made this movie.

I have seen this movie many times growing up and I loved it. Although I believe this movie might be the main reason I hated going to the lake when I was younger. This movie came out when my mom was growing up and she wouldn't go in her town lake for a couple of years and she lived in a small town in Northern Utah in the mountains with a man made tiny lake.

My wife had never seen this movie and I wanted her to watch it with me but I didn't want her to watch it until after our honeymoon because we were going to be swimming with sharks (small ones). After we got back I had her watch this movie with me and it scared her to death, but she loved it. After the movie I asked her if she had seen that before if she would have gotten in the water and she said no, which would have made our trip pretty boring considering we went tropical.

Now about the movie.

Spielberg changed the way scary movies were done. For example never giving us a clear shot of the shark until more than halfway through the movie. The musical score is amazing and gets your heart beating and your blood pumping and just builds up the suspense. The dialogue was fun and the script was fantastic. Quints monologue about the U.S.S. Indianapolis is the best and most spine chilling monologue in the movie, and honestly I think it is one of the greatest monologues in movie history.

If you have never seen this movie and are a fan of scary movies I would recommend this one.",1460678400,,1547,4.212837837837838

3229756,5,B000X1CMXO,"The original JAWS is one of my favorite movies.

It is one of the few movie transitions that closely follows the book from which it was adapted.
The movie itself has lost none of its appeal although the fashion of the time does make for some comical moments. It is rare that a movie can combine the dynamics of three powerful actors and have it work so well together. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss pull it off superbly.

I will not go into the plot as I think the only person that does not know it has probably been living off the grid for the last forty-some years. Instead I will focus on the Blu-Ray DVD.

I have owned the VHS and standard DVD versions of this movie. Not too long ago I had to replace my television which I did with a 4k capable model. The resolution was so good I felt it would be worth getting a compatible Blu-Ray player. When I found JAWS on Amazon, I just had to try with the new setup. I was not disappointed.

Universal Studios has embarked on a project to restore and in some cases improve the picture and sound quality of many of its old films. This version of JAWS is one the results of that project.

The restoration of this movie is excellent. The colors are vibrant and true to life. The sound has also been dramatically improved which greatly added to enjoyment of watching it in a surround-sound environment. In a nut shell the restoration efforts take good advantage of todays hi-resolution DVD players, televisions and surround-sound systems.

The DVD comes with a number of extras including the making of Jaws, the impact & legacy of the movie, the restoration process and deleted scenes and outtakes to name a few.

This DVD is one any JAWS fan would do well to add to their collection.",1460592000,8,1742,4.4420062695924765
3229757,1,B000X1CMXO,"most of the one star reviews for Jaws on here are erroneously aimed at the quality of the service of their purchase or the lack of special features on subsequent releases of the film, but my main complaint is that i just don't see what makes this film so great. ive seen it many times, i've caught all the subplots...the greediness of the mayor and keeping the beach open, Brody's frustration, the badass great white hunter getting his just due...all of it. the problem is...where does the necessity of all this overwrought characterization become necessary? its a shark eating swimmers...the end. the shark needs to be found and killed. thats it. no monologues, no overacting, no romantic subplots or endless drunken dialogue. imagine Friday The 13th, a much better horror film, being an hour longer because each character receives the time it takes to force the audience into believing these are REAL people? characterization IS necessary, but when it eats up 80% of the film's running time...you're boring the audience. had this film been made by someone other than Steven Spielberg, it would not have gotten all the awards and praise that it has. the proof is in Jaws 2, a much more entertaining film..an exploitation film...that was not done by Spielberg and deemed an unworthy sequel. its 10 times the fun, and low on boredom. when you're making a film about a killer fish eating teens and swimmers...take the boring parts out of the novel your screenplay is based on and add more action...and less dialogue from drunken fisherman.",1460246400,2,1537,4.915384615384616

3229760,5,B000X1CMXO,"Any individual who has been living and watching movies in approximately the last fifty years has heard of Steven Spielberg, and his legendary films. The film Jaws is one that everyone has heard or seen, whether it be the actual film or a reference on a t-shirt and even social media. At the very least the majority of the population has heard the iconic Jaws theme song by John Williams. This 1975 film is one that can either instill fear of the unknown ocean into the bravest or confirm the 100 plus reasons those that suffer from galeophobia should remain on the beach  like because of 100 plus sharp teeth. While the scenes and shots of the ocean from the beaches of Amity can be pretty terrifying, it is nothing in comparison to the shots of three main characters on a boat in the ocean. Spielberg does a fantastic job of capturing the claustrophobia and suspense of hunting this massive killer in one of the biggest and most open oceans in the world. The underwater shots help to provide an extremely different type of film experience. In example, there are many underwater shots that are from the perspective of the shark. It creates a sort of disorienting feeling, as it is hard to figure whether it is more terrifying or interesting to get this first perspective visual of the monster itself. The dynamic between the chief of police, rich marine scientist, and experienced fisherman also provides a second plot line for the audience. While this movie seems to be one focused around terror and suspense, there is this hero and adventurer undertone to it. Battling one of natures most terrifying hunters in part of the world that is still mainly undiscovered.",1459900800,,1665,4.721649484536083
3229761,5,B000X1CMXO,"When you hear the name Steven Spielberg, a few excellent films come to mind: Saving Private Ryan, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, and last but most definitely not least  Jaws. Jaws has been captivating audiences since it's release in 1975, the film has survived the test of time for a few reasons; for instance the structure of a strong cast. The film is lead by Roy Scheider who does a spectacular job of telling the story of lead character Chief Martin Brody, he is able to use his emotion in the film to tell the audience that there is more than what meets the eye of Chief Brody. The other shining light acting wise in this film is the star Richard Dreyfuss and his portrayal of Matt Hooper; Dreyfuss truly establishes himself as a top tier actor in this film even though it isn't a film where he has the lead role. Dreyfuss exhibits something that is truly difficult to show, and that is believable body language throughout the film, which is what separates high-caliber acting from just average acting. The acting itself isn't the only thing to carry this film into greatness, the score of this film is what truly brings this film into fruition. The score by John Williams is iconic in a way itself.

The score for Jaws is a score that will live on in film history as it is the perfect culmination of story telling and emotion inducing. Everyone recognizes the suspenseful music that goes on throughout the film, and it tells two stories one of the story of the main character, the Shark, and then one of the victims; it portrays the shark as an unstoppable force and it creates an atmosphere which is overpowering to us humans that aren't so relentless. What makes this film truly stand out is the subject manner in the film. Jaws brings out the wrath of one of mother nature's children and causes the fear that is generated from this film to be real; it does something many films have tried to do and some films are still trying to do and it creates a real fear using real-world monsters. Jaws is and will continue to be a contributing factor in the history of film for all these reasons and solidifies the thriller genre as a very important.",1459900800,,2164,4.546153846153846

3229763,5,B000X1CMXO,"SPOILERS AHEAD
Steven Spielbergs Jaws has had a lasting effect on cinema and the public psyche since its release in so many ways. Aside from the fact that the film still (mis)quoted quite often or that suspenseful music plays in our heads whenever were about to sneak up on someone, the film has influenced so many of our other favorite films since its release. The idea of the summer blockbuster began with Jaws. Spielbergs use of a simple plot with a high-concept such as giant man-eating shark has been refurbished for audiences over the last forty years. Ridley Scotts Alien was even marketed to studios as Jaws in space. Jaws is terrifying and comes off as a horror film, even though it lacks some of the persistent iconography that exists in previous films of the genre. However, the remote location out on the ocean takes the places of the isolated haunted mansion and there is a fight between what the audience might consider good vs. evil  unless you find yourself rooting for the shark. Jaws is a film that is able to successfully transcend the genres of both horror and thriller.

The suspense of the film is only made greater by John Williamss score as we quickly realize the music is there not only to set the films tone, but to imply the sharks presence. As the ominous and iconic music builds, we do not even need to see the shark to know he is about to make his grand entrance. Although much of the film takes place on the open ocean, Spielberg utilizes very tight framing within the confines of the Orca to show just how trapped Brody, Quint, and Hooper really are upon their encounter with the shark. With stellar performances drawn from Shaws Captain Ahab impersonation, Dreyfusss comic relief, and Sheiders every-man persona that has you rooting for the sharks explosive demise, Jaws can easily be considered a timeless classic that will continue to influence filmmakers and have new generations of audience members gripping their armrests.",1459814400,,1960,4.778761061946903
3229764,4,B000X1CMXO,"Steven Spielbergs Jaws is a great example of what filmmakers can do to heighten the audiences suspension of disbelief. Modern films rely on the use of CGI to create settings, and creatures that are not real. CGI is used to create a situation that may otherwise may be impossible, yet the audience still has a hard time believing the situation. Before a dependency on CGI was common Jaws was able to create situations, that instilled fear into the audience and did not disturb the suspension of disbelief. One big difference between Jaws and modern films is that the monster, or situation in modern films is given to the audience. There is no mystery or illusion. Jaws leaves a lot to the imagination. Nothing is put in plain sight and leaves a lot of mystery. This paired with good acting and great writing, leaves the audience at the edge of their seats. The icing on the cake is all the practical effects. The use of CGI to dramatically intensify a scene is not believable for a viewer. There is nothing for an audience to relate to because these big Hollywood scenes don't happen in real life. Jaws is grounded in reality. People have seen sharks, sinking boats, and beaches. This is easier to believe entire cities falling apart or big explosions everywhere. The practical effects put the audience in a familiar situation with strange circumstances. This fools the mind into thinking that this could be real. The practical effects to make a physical shark adds to the terror. The textures are believable as opposed to a smooth CGI finish. The shark seems to feel real and not have any questionable ways of movement. The film grounds its plot by delivering emotion through the actors and the illusion of danger. Nothing is more terrifying than what the mind creates, that is why Jaws gives the audience the freedom to fill in the blank spaces instead of using CGI to show everything.",1459728000,,1886,4.735562310030395
3229765,5,B000X1CMXO,"Best thriller of all time. Great acting, great story, and great directing. Probably the most perfect movie of all time. With a rewatchable factor of 100%. Blu ray transfer perfect. Perfect sound and picture.",1459728000,,207,5.117647058823529
3229766,5,B000X1CMXO,"It has been decades since the release of Steven Spielberg's Jaws, and this film stands the test of time. Despite the plot being rather simple and ridiculous in a way, Jaws still manages to create amazing suspense and fear in the audience with brilliant cinematography, amazing characters, and a phenomenal yet simplistic sound track. The plot is simple: there is a killer shark patrolling the waters of an island and the main character Brody has to find a way to deal with this problem.

First of all, the shots in this film are beautifully crafted. Despite the latter half of the film being shot  out in the open seas, the shots remain very still and breathtaking as the audience feels as if they are out in the middle of the sea. The setting of the ocean and an island help create a sense of claustrophobia in an ironic way. Even though there is open space all around you, you feel trapped within the boat amongst the watery abyss.

Secondly, the characters in this film are amazing and bring life to this film. Brody is chief of police and is headstrong about making sure the beaches are safe and no one else dies due to a shark attack. Matt Hooper is an oceanographer, a brilliant yet hotheaded man, who wants to help rid of this killer shark. And Quint as the shark hunter, who is as mysterious as he is creepy. These three main characters help give this film a more realistic feeling to it and helps create amazing interactions between characters.

Finally, the soundtrack is probably the most influential part of this film despite its simplicity.  For what sounds like only two notes, the main theme music of Jaws is memorable. creates a chilling sense of suspense, and is a major part of pop culture. The music in this film stands strong today as it did during its release and proves as an example that the right music can make anything terrifying.",1459641600,,1856,4.578313253012048
3229767,4,B000X1CMXO,"""You're going to need a bigger boat,"" says Brody to Quint.  What makes Jaws such a great film is the way it uses suspense.  Most horror films, especially the classics, like to make the audience feel the sense of being trapped by using tight framing or the use of lines or bars.  Instead, the shots in Jaws mostly contain of the open sea.  Usually when you see open space, you think someone is safe or out of harm's way, but in Jaws, the open space of the water makes a person more vulnerable to where the big great white has more of an opportunity to get you because there's nowhere to hide.  Being in the water means you are entering the monster's territory... and there is no hiding from a monster once you enter its territory.  Jaws shares as many characteristics as any other classic horror film.  Like Halloween, you share the perspective of the killer (Michael Myers in Halloween and the shark in Jaws).  You see what they see.  When the shark swims up to the surface, our perspective matches the shark as we look at his prey splashing in the water from underneath.  With Michael Myers, we also see him stalk his victims.  Along with perspective is the use of color changing from light to dark.  When it is our own perspective, the surface of the water, we see the bright blue sky reflecting on the water, but when we get to the shark's perspective, underwater, there is a darker blue with the shadow of the shark lurking by as it stalks its prey.  It's the leit-motif that really makes Jaws a lasting classic though.  Just like any other classic horror movie monster, the shark in Jaws gets its very own score of music.  It's the sound that lets the audience know when that shark is lurking about, ready to attack and from the first moment we hear it, it is a sound that sticks with us long after the movie is over.",1459641600,,1822,4.397014925373134

What was supposed to be one of the all time bombs at the box office has turned into a favorite classic for all ages. The premise of a huge man eating shark is a stretch, but the terror factor is played to the hilt.
Robert Shaw steals the show as the captain of the boat paid to find and kill the shark. Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss are frustrated in their attempts to convince the business people and mayor of the seasonally vulnerable island community catering to tourist trades that their livelihood is in grave jeopardy unless they close their tourist season after several shark attacks.
Shaw convinces the council and mayor to fund his hunt and Scheider and Dreyfuss hitch a ride to assist. Once they are on the water the fun begins. Shaw was on the US Navy cruiser ""Indianapolis"" in World War II and told the story of that tragedy to set the stage for their own confrontation with the huge shark.
Lots of action and more than a little wry humor to spice things up.
Dreyfuss thought this was the worst film he was ever cast in, but the popularity led him to declare ""What do I know?"". He also did a fine job acting.",1459123200,2,1245,4.347639484978541

It didn't quite have the shock factor as it did when I first saw it, of course, but the script and the acting felt quaint, rather than hokey, as a lot of the 70's ""classics"" feel. And Robert Shaw! I don't think I realized what a tremendous character he was until now.

3229876,5,B000X1CMXO,"Why is Jaws' titular character one of the scariest movie monsters? Ultimately, it's a common great white shark that lacks the genetic and/or supernatural enhancements expected in horror antagonists. One explanation is its hunting ground, which is a place we cannot imagine anything bad happening. Besides its safety and beautiful weather, Amity Island is perfectly evocative of childhood beach-going memories. Adding terror to this idyllic blend makes it all the more terrifying. The three leads' all-consuming relationship with the beast also explains its near-mythological status. After all, it would take some kind of monster for someone like Hooper to devote his life to studying it and a hell of an encounter for someone like Quint to devote his to turning them into trophies. As for Brody, while hardly a shark expert, his every waking thought concerns stopping a single shark from ruining paradise and harming his family. Regardless, all of these elements could still result in a monster that makes audiences laugh instead of shudder. Spielberg and company prevented this from happening in one of the most famous instances of doing more with less in movie history. Since the mechanical shark prop was too cumbersome for extended use, the director made substitutions such as showing the beast from a first-person perspective and by revealing the aftermaths of its feeding frenzies instead of the shark itself. Besides adding tension, these flourishes make it more possible to imagine the monster not as a shark, but as the stuff of nightmares killing machine that Hooper and Quint describe. John Williams' theme for the shark is another prime example of doing more with less. Its simple repeated phrase not only adds an undercurrent of dread, but also mystery as to when and where the beast will attack. In the end, Jaws proves that a monster does not need an elaborate history or otherworldly origins. With enough movie-making magic, it can simply be an animal looking for its next hot lunch.",1447718400,,1999,5.134969325153374

3229910,5,B000X1CMXO,"Noted for being the first summer blockbuster, Steven Spielberg's 1975 adaptation of author Peter Benchley's Jaws was a groundbreaking cinematic achievement. A thriller that continues to terrify audiences to this day, Jaws combines a great story with interesting characters and a threatening monster to create an iconic and timeless movie.

The film takes place in the small New England tourist town of Amity Island. The town is shocked when the remains of a young woman who died of an apparent shark attack washed on shore. Police Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) is determined to protect beach-goers from any further attacks, even if that means closing the beaches. Amity's mayor is equally motivated to keep the beaches open, and enlists oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to examine the remains. But the mayor, sensing a publicity nightmare that would destroy the town's reputation and financial stability, refuses to search for a long term solution to the problem.

When Brody and Hooper discover the remains of another victim, this one with a great white tooth embedded in their boat, they decide to enlist the help of eccentric shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw). The unlikely trio heads out to hunt the animal and restore peace to their small town. Along the way, they learn that they are not facing any ordinary animal. The shark that is preying on their town is a real monster with only one goal. . . killing any person who comes in contact with it.

Jaws is one of those rare horror films that scares not by shock but by imagination. In fact, many of the scenes that do not show Speilberg's monster are far more terrifying than when we actually get to see it. Composer John William's iconic score instantly creates an ever mounting tension that foreshadows the impending doom of the shark's next victim. Populated with unique characters who each receive a fair amount of development, Jaws becomes the standard for a blockbuster film that succeeds through emotional connections, not purely spectacle. The greatest achievement of this classic movie is the way in which Speilberg trusts his audience to imagine things far scarier than anything he could ever put on the screen. Ultimately, Jaws stands the test of time and remains a highlight of Speilberg's illustrious career.",1445472000,,2285,5.0396825396825395

The Blu-ray edition of this film is absolutely fantastic - and is a ""Must Have"" for any movie lover. It's ""JAWS"" like you've never seen it before - with amazingly clear picture and sound, you might even notice some background conversations, sound-effects and details that you've never noticed before in other viewing formats.

I have literally seen the film thousands of times (I tend to watch it at least once or twice a week... sometimes multiple times in one day). I've seen it on Standard TV, HD-TV, VHS, DVD, Blu-ray and in theaters, including in IMAX. This Blu-ray edition, however, is my favorite way to watch it.

3229957,5,B000X1CMXO,"JAWS is a 5 star adventure movie.  It is as relevant today as it was when it came out in 1975.  It is amusing to know that everything seemed to be going wrong onset but everything that was captured on film was amazing.  The editor of JAWS will never get the full credit they deserve because in someone else's hands the film could have been a bomb instead of a classic.

JAWS is the quintessential summer blockbuster which made over 200 million during its initial release run.  It has all the elements that make a great movie, riveting story, suspense, great acting, wonderful cast, sense of adventure, beautiful music and a great climax.

JAWS made Steven Spielberg a household name and after a few more big budget successes the movie studios would greenlight any future project he wanted.  JAWS is easily one of the best films ever made.  It is hard to image Roy Scheider in any other role than as ""Chief Brody"" or Richard Dreyfuss as ""Hooper"".  Or the captivating scene of Robert Shaw as ""Quint"" describing the sinking of the Indianapolis heavy cruiser.  All 3 actors would go on to star in other major films but they will always be linked and best remembered for their roles in this film
.
JAWS had such a big impact in and out of the Theaters.  It is one of those rare films that kept people out of the water or at least think twice about going into the ocean.  Funny thing is the common mosquito kills thousands of more people each year by spreading diseases than being eaten alive by a great white.  But the terror and idea of some unseen killer below you is much scarier.

The town of Amity could be seen as any costal town in the whole United States, they all survive by the big spring and summer tourist seasons and live bare bones through the late fall and winter.  About midway through the movie, the film takes on more of an adventure element as our 3 hero's go out on their big fishing trip.  While out at sea it is hard to tell who is the hunter and who is being hunted.  One of my favorite scenes in the film is when Quint has the Great White hooked on the big fishing pole and the look on his face as he is bracing to reel in the shark and the fish breaks piano wire line.

For my generation JAWS would be seen as closest to the Titanic phenomenon of the late 1990's.  A movie that kept smashing box office records and was unsinkable at the box office.  JAWS was the same way only 25 years prior in 1975.  It topped Gone with the Wind and held the title of highest grossing movie of all time until Star Wars a few years later.  The current highest grossing movie is Avatar but in no way is it even close to as good a movie as JAWS.  Avatar and a lot of the current movies are seen on 4 times as many screens as films like Jaws and GWTW upon there releases.  The theaters also charge more per ticket than they did back in 1975.

JAWS is a wonderful film, it is frightening and wonderful all at the same time.  I would recommend it to any cinema lover.",1441497600,,2966,4.251785714285714

3229961,5,B000X1CMXO,"I love this movie! Sharks, 70's fashion, an anxious and arrogant Richard Dreyfuss, and of course John Williams' classic terror inducing score all come together for a pleasing cinematic experience.  My young teen son and I can watch this without those awkward ""mature"" scenes found in many films, and the blood/gore is really manageable for this scary-movie-hating mom.
Here is a link to a great interview of Richard Dreyfuss' kids about their feelings growing up with the ""hero"" of Jaws:

3230076,4,B000X1CMXO,"A classic film.  Current news about east coast shark attacks made me remember the movie's treatment of parallel concerns by the tourist industry versus public safety and I remembered that I didn't have copy of my own.  Not any more.  This B-D version was very crisp after the restoration of the original prints.  The sound was good as well.  HD playback  in my home theater made me jump just as the original theater experience did.  The bonus material was an education in film making.  The director and crew turned monumental production problems into what was probably an even better movie.  Problems with the mechanical shark made its appearance on the screen limited and created a ""less is more"" result.",1437091200,,705,4.857142857142857

3230078,4,B000X1CMXO,"I'm surprised Criterion hasn't gotten their hands on this movie and remastered it, as it sure would be nice to see a high quality transfer.  Hard to believe  that it was 40 years ago that Jaws scared everyone out of the water, but times have changed and recently a group of beach goers rescued a beached Great White on a Cape Cod beach.  What would Sheriff Brody have thought of that?

I grew up in Redneck Riviera, near Navarre, Florida, where the second Jaws movie was filmed, as it was cheaper to do so than Martha's Vineyard, where this movie was made.  Universal Studios threw a bundle of money behind this movie and were rewarded handsomely.  Spielberg had nothing to do with the awful shark movies that followed.  Unfortunately, these films inspired shark rodeos all along the panhandle of Florida with just about every trawler hauling in some kind of shark, usually sand sharks, hanging them on racks to be measured and slaughtered.  Shark jaws could be found in all the local shops and shark's teeth became popular to wear around the neck.  It took years for this mania to die down.

Now, we can look back nostalgically at this film and admire it for what it was -- an escapist summer movie with some great performances, notably by the late great Robert Shaw and Roy Scheider.  Richard Dreyfus was the new kid on the block as oceanographer Hooper, who Spielberg decided to save in the movie.  Hooper met a pretty gruesome end in Peter Benchley's book.  Still, the star of the show was Jaws, a latter-day incarnation of Moby-Dick meant to thrill audiences moreso than make them think.",1437091200,,1592,4.663082437275985

The later parts really pulled me in, however, as the characters started developing more and the atmosphere began getting really tense.

3230174,5,B000X1CMXO,"I have always been perplexed why Hollywood thought they needed sequels to this great film. As far as I know, Peter Benchley who penned the original novel never wrote a sequel, and Spielberg declined to direct Jaws II. Of course the answer is the producers and executives believed they would make even more money off the Jaws franchise, particularly among those who just could not get enough of the original. But as an artistic statement, this movie really doesn't warrant sequels as it covers just about everything you could possibly do with the subject. Aside from the shark killings themselves, the characters and the audience actually learn a little bit about sharks, there are political ""currents"" regarding whether or not to close the beaches, forces more interested in profits than safety are exposed, and there is even the lynching of a poor tiger shark which turned out to be a case of mistaken identity, i.e. he wasn't ""the shark"". I always felt sorry for the little innocent tiger shark.

Two characters represent somewhat opposing views of the knowledge spectrum concerning their understanding of sharks: an expert scientist from the oceanographic society, Matt Hooper played by Richard Dreyfus, and a fisherman who makes his living catching sharks and other large sea animals, Quint played with convincing realism by the immortal Robert Shaw. Quint is not college-educated but he learned his trade through direct experience. Late in the film when Hooper and Quint are asked to sign on to a charter to kill the shark, their worlds collide. At interesting points, both characters misjudge the shark. Roy Scheider as Chief Brody, who used to defend innocent victims from mobsters in New York, finds his number-one most wanted man in Amity is not a human being but a shark. He ends up playing referee between Hooper and Quint. But as the last segment unfolds, we find Quint has some ulterior motives which may run contrary to killing the shark.

The brilliant dramatic decision which pushed this movie into the realm of par excellence (rather than merely very good) is the delay in seeing the shark for nearly half the film. Despite the posters which show a young woman enjoying a care-free swim in the ocean with a large set of teeth propelling toward her from the depths like a menacing underwater rocket, the audience never actually experiences this scene as shown. Yes, the young swimmer is the first victim, but you never see her killer, sort of akin to a murder mystery in which you see and hear the victim's demise but you don't see the murderer. Certainly, the title of the film JAWS is a give-away as to the identity of the perpetrator, but the story begins as a kind of mystery, and almost immediately, the politics of the town begins to encroach on the decisions of Chief Brody who is mainly concerned with public safety. In one of the most memorable scenes, Brody and Hooper come upon the remains of the shark's destructive power without actually seeing the shark itself.

This film was Steven Spielberg's big-time debut into the upper echelons of cinema. All kinds of interesting camera techniques are used to heighten dramatic and suspenseful effects. He even borrows a couple of trademark tricks from Hitchcock and Welles. The cast is A-list, although none of them were and ever have been big movie stars, but simply top tier actors doing what they do best. As the producers pointed out, the star of the film was the shark himself, so there was no need to put big name stars into the feature. If there is a standout in the acting department, I think it would have to go to Robert Shaw as Quint who is absolutely believable as the rough-and-ready harpooner, ""sharker"" and World War II veteran, a modern equivalent of Captain Ahab of Moby Dick fame. This is one of the all-time great action/suspense films, but don't waste your time on the ridiculous sequels. I think the original says all that needs to be said.",1433808000,,3933,4.823703703703703

They laugh out loud and say things like...""are you kidding me that shark looked so fake"" etc.  Yes, but for 1975 that shark looked pretty damn good by the standards of even today with all the CGI crap that looks worse.  In fact, it was so convincing they rarely even had to show it. Take a note horror movie directors.

This movie is really not about a fake looking shark. It's about an offshore tragedy, how a seaside community responds, the people the places etc. of Amity Island (playing Martha's Vineyard, I suppose). This film is really about acting in an a seafaring adventure.  The 3 main actors are perfectly positioned for each other.  Police Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) is afraid of the water, but very level headed and wants to protect everyone.  Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) is the scientist from the Oceanographic Institute and has just arrived on the scene to help Chief Brody.  (He might as well be from Wood's Hole) Then comes along our Ahab, or shark pirate in Quint (Robert Shaw) the best blue collar seaman of all time. It's a match in heaven for me. Oh, but they still gotta catch and kill that bastard 25 footer (3 ton of 'em)

This movie for me has all the elements that make a great film:  Great acting, great plot, great storyline, great scenery, great effects, great beaches, great ocean adventure, great horror, great action, great research, filmed on the ocean and not in a water tank...blah blah blah.  Great Soundtrack...two major notes or whatever the theme is.  Finally the little Gem:  Robert Shaw's (Quint's) USS Indianapolis speech may be the best single scene in all of Hollywood history.

3230197,5,B000X1CMXO,"Jaws, 1975 film

It is night on the ocean. A buoy clangs its warnings. Young people are sitting around a campfire at night. A couple goes to the water's edge. The girl goes in alone and finds an unpleasant surprise. She screams, then all is quiet. The next morning a man gets a telephone call. There are body parts on the beach, with crabs. What will they do? Amity Island is a small town that depends on summer tourism, the Town Council does not want the beaches closed. Will the truth be covered up? We see people in the water. ""That's some bad hat, Harry."" Where did that dog go? ""Did you see that?"" People rush from the water. Where is Alex? The Town Council wants this news suppressed. Will they close the beaches? One man offers to catch the shark for $10,000. Quint says ""you know me"".

Chief Brody does research on sharks. Two men try to catch a shark with bait. The dock collapses! ""Swim, Charlie, swim!"" They can go home now. People volunteer to hunt this shark. Matt Hooper from the Ocean Institute arrives. Its not a boat accident, it's a very large squalus. One shark was caught. Hooper measures its mouth for the bite radius. Mrs. Kintner objects to Chief Brody's failure to close the beach. Can you believe the reports on the news? Most shark attacks are about ten feet from shore in three feet of water. The shark is still out there. The boat sails at night. They find a small boat. Hooper gets a shock! ""It's a great white."" The Mayor's politics override any warnings. Brody says they need men with guns and boats. Tourists arrive for the July Fourth weekend. All seems peaceful, but nobody is in the water yet. Some boys go sailing in the pond, others in the ocean. The people see something in the water. You see the reactions as they race for the beach. False alarm?

The shark appears in the pond and gets a man. Larry seems confused, but he will sign the voucher. Quint presents his terms for hunting the shark. Hooper will go along on this fishing expedition. [Note how the story changes focus here.] They throw bait into the water to attract sharks (""chumming""). Noise from the reel sends a signal: a bite on the line. They change course. Brody sees the shark. Quint and Hooper compare scars in a bonding ceremony. We hear about the USS Indianapolis in 1945. It was torpedoed and only 316 of the 1,100 survived. Then bumping noises alarms them, something is hitting the boat.

Quint fires a rifle into the sea to no effect. A barrel floats close to the boat. The shark is back. Quint puts another harpoon and barrel into the shark. Tying the line to the boat? There is a problem with the boat. Hooper will try to stab the shark in the mouth. [Sounds easy?] The shark-proof cage is lowered into the ocean. What if it fails? The shark attacks the cage! Next it attacks the stern and weighs it down. Quint slides towards it. Brody throws a tank of compressed air. The ship lists to port. Brody climbs to mast with his Garand. He spears the shark. Next he shoots at it. One shot hits the air tank for an explosive result. The shark leaves the half-sunken boat. There is a new development for a happy ending. [What's next?]

Note the message from the ending to this story. Was it an echo of ""Moby Dick""? Why should the most experienced sailor be the lone victim? Its still a good movie, but not as impressive after 35 years. Note the presence of firearms, would they do that today? [Shouldn't Quint have used an exploding harpoon to finish off that shark? It kills bigger fish.]

I wonder why Quint didn't take any explosives along. An exploding harpoon would have quickly ended the attack; it kills the much large whales. The use of a military rifle to kill the monster must have kept this film off broadcast TV for many years. One version used electronic editing to remove the guns used in the early part of this film! This reflects the corporate politics for gun prohibition, and the mocking of the armed people who respond to the threat of the shark.
There were attacks along the Jersey Shore in 1916. There are two books that go into more detail. Note the freedom to keep and bear arms then.",1432166400,,4114,4.464095744680851

3230211,5,B000X1CMXO,"I was born in 1974 and for whatever reason never saw the movie in its entirety.  Even in 2015, this movie still holds its own perfectly.  Brilliantly written, acted, and directed, the times were rare when my thoughts wandered enough to consider that this movie was made before all the technology we have today. The shark is stunning, terrifically accurate, and terrifying.  The musical score is both parts suspense and adventure, creating a dichotomy between whimsy and horror that works in conjunction with that masterful visual onscreen imagery. The movie just breaths this time period, the ocean, and the quest of a man with secrets desperately trying to protect against ""nature"". Highly recommended.

Parents Should Watch Out For:
Alcohol/Smoking/Drug Use:
Because this movie was made in 1974, there is a lot (as in most of the central characters) of socially acceptable smoking and drinking.  There is also a short shot of drug use at the very beginning of the movie.
Nudity/Sexuality:
There is some female side view nudity and full frontal (although very blurry due to woman being in water) nudity.  There is a suggestion of two young people swimming naked together.  There is also a comment between a married couple about ""messing around"".  There is kissing between a married couple. There are also a few sexually inappropriate jokes made by one of the characters.
Violence:
This is a movie about sharks attacks so there are definitely many of those.  Most of the action happens below the water though until the final act of the film.  At the point where you start to see more of the shark, expect to see attack sequences with blood, teeth, and some mangled limbs. There is also arguing between characters, a few swings of a bat, characters get hit and injured while on the boat, and one person is slapped by another. It is implied that dog is lost or possibly killed off screen.  A dead fish is strung up and later gutted.
Adult Themes:
A descriptive war story is told with high causalities although most children may not understand the content.",1431216000,,2053,4.870689655172414

All of the original sounds are in it, most notably the gun shots before the shark is blown to Kingdom come, and many other sounds they either changed or took out entirely for the DVD release. I bought mine completely new still in the original factory wrapping.",1429228800,,424,4.379746835443038

3230243,4,B000X1CMXO,"It's a classic film. I appreciated it even more after reading the Wikipedia and IMDB pages for it. I particularly dug the 70's costumes, especially in the beach scenes. And Quint's long speech was just amazing acting, something I didn't appreciate when I first saw the film.",1428710400,,274,4.851063829787234
3230244,5,B000X1CMXO,Watched it with my dad as a kid. Just sat down and watched it with my daughter. One of the great classics.  Kept out of the backyard pool at night most of my childhood. My daughter didn't have the same reaction. Still a classic and always worth watching....  Spoiler alert..... Avoid Jaws 4..... It's dumb,1428710400,,305,4.527272727272727
