8413721,4,B0042HOQ2K,"It was a great film for those of us who like period biopics.  I learned so much about the Astors; and, I feel enriched for having made this purchase.  The audio quality is poor in certain segments; which is the only reason i do not give it 5 stars.",1517097600,,248,4.040816326530612
8413722,3,B0042HOQ2K,"The sound is spotty in places, but, it brought back so many memories for me since I was there during filming in Charlottesville....",1477872000,,131,4.739130434782608
8413723,5,B0042HOQ2K,"I loved the series in the 70's, when it was first released.  It has aged very well.  Nancy Astor is a very interesting person, and the series gives a good representation of her life and views -- which include some that I endorse and others that I find truly odd.",1463788800,,262,4.22

8413725,1,B0042HOQ2K,"I was totally disappointed with this.  I was SO looking forward to seeing this again after 20+ years but when I received it and put it in my player, it would not play!  This was printed for European sets, not American and my player cannot read the disc.  I know I should have saved the receipts etc so that I could return it but too much time passed between receipt and my opportunity to watch it anyway.  I will be sure to NEVER order from this particular company again.",1434067200,,471,4.258426966292135
8413726,5,B0042HOQ2K,A terrific series when aired on Masterpiece Theatre in the United States.  What a shame this story about Anglo-American society and the Virginia born woman who was the first woman elected to parliament is not available in a format designed for the US and Canada.  I would have purchased this immediately - it was that good!,1429315200,4,323,4.75
8413727,5,B0042HOQ2K,"even though he is in it just at the beginning - Steve Meek, as Esmond sets the tone for this delightful BBC production. Even though it is region 2 and 4 - I can see it on my HD-TV with DVD player ( we live in Canada - region 1) - buy it - enjoy it -",1373760000,,249,3.3859649122807016
