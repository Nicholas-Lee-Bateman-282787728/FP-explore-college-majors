This is a sci-fi action movie that is a remake (some say it's not a remake) of the classic 1987 film of the same name.

It is about a police officer named Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) who becomes a cyborg police officer.

This movie has plenty of action and special effects as well as some big-name actors: Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton, and Samuel L. Jackson.

Unfortunately, this movie fails to make any significant improvements over the 1987 original.  There is lack of violence, lack of biting social satire, and lack of character development.  It just does not have the playfulness and wit of the original with its many underlying themes.

Some may see it as odd that I mention lack of violence.  However, a movie of this type has to be violent especially at the beginning.  Why?  Because you have to be convinced that a man (in this case, Murphy) has to become a cyborg.  In this movie, I was NOT convinced.  As a result, the Robocop character seemed to be just a man in a fancy suit.  (In the original movie, I was definitely CONVINCED that Murphy should become a cyborg.)

Another reason violence is needed is that you need to feel that Robocop is in danger.  If he's not in danger, then the movie becomes boring.  This is what happened with me.  The movie became boring and as a result I lost interest in it quite fast.  (I NEVER lost interest in the original.)

This movie chooses to focus on Murphy's relationship with his family after he becomes Robocop.  I felt doing this made the movie drag.  (In the original film, Robocop has only flashbacks of this family.)

It takes a skilled actor to show his humanity while in the Robocop costume.  I did not feel that humanity coming through with Kinnaman playing Robocop.  (In the original movie, the actor who played Robocop, Peter Weller, was able to superbly show his humanity while in the Robocop costume.)

There is no real main theme music in this movie.  With the original, the theme music is unforgettable.

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2014) has three extras.

In conclusion, this is a good action movie with equally good special effects and some big-name actors.  However, it fails to make any significant improvements over the original 1987 classic.
