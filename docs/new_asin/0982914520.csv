South Dade County(Now Miami-Dade County)had a Gem,aside from the environmental mumbojumbo and so-called ""Environmentalists"" which ironically(Thank God) had nothing to do with the downfall of Aero Jet Dade,only Corrupt NASA officials (JFK and Corruption need I say more?),Now Homestead is still as it was then nothing to do,only farmland and vast middle of nowhere despite ""development"".I am glad I came upon this DVD that shows a Bygone era when Jobs Mattered,This place should be Turned into a Museum sadly I doubt that Miami Dade ""Water"" will do anything.",1420243200,,834,5.374045801526718
