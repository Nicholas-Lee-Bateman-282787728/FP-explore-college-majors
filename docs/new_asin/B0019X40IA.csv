3444602,4,B0019X40IA,"Finn's Girl"", a narrative about a woman named Finn. The girl is her daughter, Zelly. Finn is a (lesbian) widow in contemporary society who is working toward piecing aspects of her life together re matters of the heart. Finn is a well respected medical doctor/gynecologist who manages a busy and demanding abortion clinic. Finn, finds herself constantly receiving death threats from fanatical right-winged Christians and is protected by police security 24/7. She is rearing a 12 year old child who's testing the boundaries on levels, with Finn and with the law.

Brilliant little film. I agree, intelligently scripted. Brilliant in how it addresses controversial subject matters such as: rearing of children with gay parents, recreational drug use, science and technology & abortion.

Beautifully cast on all levels. Brooke Johnson does a wonderful job.

Strongly recommend.",1224892800,8,873,5.451851851851852

8275551,1,B0019X40IA,"Really slow and dull. Might possibly appeal to the older lesbians with family sector of the community - aside from that you're going to be tempted to switch this one off halfway through. I bought this one without reading the reviews properly, a compulsive buy based on an Amazon suggest-sell recommendation based on my lesbian tv/movie binge with the $AU riding high. Don't make the same mistake as I did!",1290816000,,405,4.8
8275552,4,B0019X40IA,"This is a very well-produced, directed and acted movie - a pleasure to watch every minute.

The Lesbian aspects are dealt with in an even-handed, non-sensational, up-to-date and interesting manner.  I liked the characters and wanted to follow through the film with them. I won't elaborate on the plot as other reviewers have provided that.

Anyone wondering if this dvd is worth it - YES is the answer. Recommended.",1265500800,,415,4.9855072463768115
8275553,4,B0019X40IA,"Ordered Finn's girl and finally I get a good decent lesbian movie.  Yeah of course some of the actualization was off but the film was done very well.  Good film.  I am tired of lesbo films with no quality, poor boring slow stories or one's that look like my mom filmed it on her home video camera. Anyhow, I bought 6 lesbo films this time and Finn's Girl was the far best.",1236470400,3,372,4.138888888888889

More accurately described as a single mother/rebellious daughter or parenting movie. The clincher to the flick is so unrealistic as to cast negative light on the entire movie. What I mean is that the movie goes along and seems quite realistic and believable until the issue that is hidden is articulated.  That issue is unbelievably unrealistic that it ruins the rest of the movie.",1233964800,,606,6.289156626506024
