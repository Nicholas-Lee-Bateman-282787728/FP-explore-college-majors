And the effects: for crying out loud, if your creature makeup/effects are poor, please keep the creatures in the shadows! The ""wolfpeople"" of the title are laughable; we're talking the Muppet Show here! This film looks like a group of high school kids made it with their allowance money.",1418428800,,410,4.554054054054054
8383502,1,B002X78QG8,"Although this movie has some decent parts to it, it is mostly a major disaster. Whoever directed this feature should retire...",1362096000,,126,5.0476190476190474
8383503,3,B002X78QG8,"I thought the film was well-done for an inexpensively made Indie. Good story line; well written and the actors surprisingly good. The fact that it was shot near where I live and the fact that I know one of the producers may have colored my critique, but I think I would have given it a good rating nonetheless. Looking forward to their next production; which I understand is in the works.",1262131200,,388,4.47887323943662
