7905420,4,B000009H9A,"The Final Option is about the SDU which is basically Hong Kong's version  of SWAT (though they owe more to the British SAS than the Americans).  It  follows one officer's path from regular constable to SDU applicant to  trainee and finally to action.  Along the way, a good amount of time is  spent on the personal lives of the officers and their camraderie.  Macho  action fans shouldn't worry - For the most part, these scenes are not sappy  and in fact are rather engaging.  They are really quite good.  The training  scenes are very entertaining as well.  Credit has to go to director Gordon  Chan for keeping the pace up and his smooth and competent shooting style.  In the background is a subplot about a bunch of petulant arms-dealing  punks, but the focus is on the officers and SDU training.  The arms dealers  are only there for the inevitable final showdown against the SDU.  And what  a showdown it is!  The second half of the movie is basically wall-to-wall  action, with the SDU taking on gangs in the streets of Hong Kong as well as  the arms dealers in a gigantic warehouse gunfight.  As an action movie,  it's a good one as it delivers both characters/human drama as well as  thrilling action.  As a movie about elite forces, it is frankly the best  ever made (granted it's not exactly a competitive field).  If you're into  military/police special units stuff, you must get this movie.  There is  also a sequel (prequel actually) called The First Option that is more  action-packed but spends far too little time on the characters.",962755200,3,1549,4.66044776119403
7905421,5,B000009H9A,"Director/writer Gordon Chan has an impeccable ear for dialogue, and he creates wonderful characters and mines them brilliantly for dramatic tension.  The Final Option is a Hong Kong action film that doesn't rely on  fast pacing, set pieces and the gangster myth (the John Woo model that's  dominated the HK action genre for  years).  Instead, The Final Option is  one of the best police films ever made, a perfect balance of drama and  action.
The cast of mostly unknowns is marvellous, achieving a great  degree of emotional connection and truth.  Michael Wong is simultaneously  funny and affecting in the pivotal supporting role of Stone, utilizing his  flawed Cantonese and edgy way with dialogue to the fullest.  And Chan has a  brilliant sense of pacing -- when the romantic relationship develops you  never feel lost, and he juggles the personal subplots with the action  sequences with the sure hand of a pro.  The training and action sequences  are quite marvellous, really, with a minimal amount of gore, relying  instead on the characters, atmosphere, and tip-top staging.
I'm an avid  supporter of the action genre, and I'd say The Final Option ranks among the  best I've ever seen.",957484800,2,1194,4.994897959183674

7905424,4,B000009H9A,"Directed by Gordon Chan, The Final Option is Chan's attempt to do a SWAT team movie with sincere accuracy. It does go into the psyche as well as the physical of being a SWAT guy. Not just a action/hero movie. I would  strongly recommend it to any action movie fan. The technical accuracy is  particularly good.
In the Internet Movie Database it is listed as  ""Fei hu xiong xin"". But there is hardly any info.",948585600,,408,4.413333333333333
