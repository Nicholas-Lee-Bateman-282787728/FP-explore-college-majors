3953261,4,B002MZZMRM,"(No spoilers - don't worry.)

By some fortunate twist of fate, I won tickets to the London Premiere of Inglourious Basterds. Here's what it was like.

Sitting snugly in my seat in London's Leicester Square Odeon, a buzz fills the room as people are ushered into their seats and away from the Red Carpet and Paparazzi outside. Popcorn and Doritos are sold at nearly six dollars a bag but nobody is counting the pennies as they eagerly await Quentin Tarantino's new offering to the world of cinema. In stylishly late fashion he takes to the stage, confidently wielding the microphone like any good stand up comic.

""Are you ready to see some Basterds!"" He yells. And in true panto tradition, the audience scream ""Yeah!""

""ARE YOU READY TO SEE SOME BASTERDS!"" He yells again.

""YEAH!""

""Say what!?"" Quentin calls out.

""YEAH!!!"" We cheer.

""HELL YEAH!"" He calls back.

""HELL YEAH!"" We reply.

""THEN LET'S GET THIS MOTHER ****** STARTED!!"" He screams. The audience erupt in cheers, and with everybody psyched up and ready, Quentin throws the mike to the floor with a bang, the lights go down and he exits stage as the curtains part and the movie begins.

So, my review:

Lawrence Bender (Tarantino's Producer since Reservoir Dogs) in an interview about Inglourious Basterds said that it had the layers of Pulp Fiction but with more maturity, because, in fairness, Quentin's had 15 years to grow, learn and develop, although his last two outings of Death Proof and Kill Bill showed little sign of the writer/Director maturing, merely stamping his mark on genres that weren't in the spotlight, and in some ways, recreating them.

So, did Inglorious Basterds live up to this claim of the new and matured Quentin Tarantino? Well, yes and no. Tarantino's staple dialogue, when not pushing a story, is often crude. That, for once, is not the case with Inglourious Basterds, so perhaps that can be taken as a sign of maturity. The dialogue is excellent, as expected, but at times without the poetic rhythm that his first three pictures had in abundance. The only drawback of this is that on rare occasions you'll find that you've zoned out for a moment, but, with a Tarantino film, chances are you'll see it again sometime and catch up on missed dialogue. It is dialogue heavy, which today's audience seem to shy away from, however it is always better to see a film driven by a good script rather than special effects.

The story is layered in true Tarantino fashion. The Basterds themselves could have been developed more, since there are many and we get to know so few, however this isn't a small film like Reservoir Dogs, revolving around a group of Basterds as the trailer makes out, and there are plenty of other characters to compensate for it.

Also, as we've come to expect, the film is violent, which I didn't think would bother me, but it's the only thing that left a bitter taste in my mouth. I'm pretty desensitized to violence on screen and have been for many years, but I expected the violence of Inglourious Basterds to be understandable under the topic of War. I also expected a few points to emphasize the cruelty and senseless of war, but I found that in many ways this was a glorification of war and Quentin has used it as a playing field for his imagination without considering the consequences. As Uncle Ben taught us in Spiderman ""With great power comes great responsibility"" and when I was going into Inglourious Basterds, I felt that the uneducated audience who love Tarantino might leave this film having learned a few things. Sadly, I don't feel that is the case, and for me that is its only downfall. It's becoming more and more obvious that Quentin Tarantino makes the films that Quentin Tarantino wants to see, and while that is precisely why they're so good, I do find that if he was a little less self indulgent he could make something just as hip, funky, violent and entertaining, but with more depth.

However, as a crafted piece of work, in script, style and care, it fires on all cylinders. I do not believe that a Tarantino film will ever not live up to the standards we've come to expect and I honestly feel that he is the most reliable director in the world today, but while some are calling this a more mature piece of work, the reality is that his first two ventures on the big screen were in fact more mature and with less glorified violence than what he is making now.

Be that as it may, he is one of the few Director's who I feel is really worthy of the title 'Artist', and if somebody is an Artist then they should be free to make what they want. Tarantino is fortunate enough to be able to make what he wants without being hampered by producers, and while I wouldn't want it any other way, I believe that for a man who's first three films often had the theme of honour cropping up, he has now made a war film with little to no honour or respect for the real people who suffered and died in World War 2, and although it's entertaining, that sure as hell doesn't make it right.

Enough said. Go and make up your own minds about it.

3953284,1,B002MZZMRM,"I don't understand the good reviews of this film.  I found the movie confusing because it did not feel like WW2 and because the ""Americans"" were more like Nazi's than the Nazi's in this movie.  There are many scenes that are pointlessly graphic and violent.  The entire movie comes off as some kind of sick, twisted, serial killer's fantasy idea of fun which is very disturbing.  I did not find the characters and actors in the least bit convincing. The movie seems to have a clear message which is: ""it is okay to be more bloody, more violent, more morally deprived, more disturbing than the enemy because they are the symbol of evil.""  I would like to think of America and its Allies of being on the ""good side"" and that they fought so that we would not have to live our lives in that manner.  And I would like to think of Jews as people, victims of the Holocaust and not as blood-thirsty demons out for revenge.  In this respect, I find the movie insulting to the Jewish people in general.  I saw no wholesome American values presented in this warped fantasy.  Maybe it was under all the murderous hate and blood?",1518912000,2,1116,4.458128078817734

3953292,2,B002MZZMRM,"I find Tarantino movies hit or miss. This is definitely a miss. Too long, scenes drag and dialogue went on endlessly. Tarantino is overly self indulgent and in love with his own writing. He thinks he is being clever when he adds details like the milk drinking at the beginning, but it just adds to the monotony. He needs a good script editor and film editor. I bailed 2/3 of the way through this, didn't care about the characters or how it ended. I think his concept here is great, but bogged down by making simple scenes that could be 3 minutes, 10 minutes long. This is an example of a successful director given too much control. Edit this down to 90 minutes, might be decent film. Don't waste the 2 and a half hours.",1515369600,,719,4.333333333333333
3953293,4,B002MZZMRM,"So, to enjoy this movie you have to see it as escapism. It is not a historical text. It is a fresh and campy version of events that is a little bit escapism and a little bit serious.  The movie suggests that Hitler was not, in fact, killed in a bunker at the end of the war but secretly killed in part by a rag tag group of American solders and one jewish woman name Shoshana. Shoshana's family was killed by a very evil German called Hans Lauda. And though a series of happy luck happens to be running a movie theater where the german dignitaries are showing a film, this includes Hitler. So she burns the theater down with them all locked in. The basterds are there too. The whole movie is done in the way ""Kill Bill"" was which shows a lack of creativity. What was creative was the plot between Frederick Zollar and Shoshana. Showing a german solder who perhaps wasn't pure evil and had some humanity left.  One reason for the four instead of five stars was the horrible Brad Pitt performance. He was an embarrassment to the excellent work done by the rest of the cast.",1514678400,,1071,4.323383084577115
3953294,5,B002MZZMRM,"""Inglourius Basterds"" appealed to me on par with / same as a ""campy"" spaghetti western. Viewed as such, the film is a five.

If my train of thought tries to categorize the film as ""campy war movie"", the film becomes ""absurd"" (ruined) not camp. Giving up five stars, just because it's Tarantino.

3953300,5,B002MZZMRM,"Tarantino's ""Inglorious Basterds"" really is to paraphrase Aldo Raine, Tarantino's masterpiece; clearly Tarantino thought so as well.

This movie is almost completely perfect: the one lingering question anyone who's seen this movie 2 dozen or more times has is this: Why did Yudovich get arrested?

This movie, like several others (e.g., the original ""Shining"") was completely misinterpreted by critics, which is kind of strange.  Most critics called this flick a kind of ""fictional Jewish murderous revenge"" flick, but ...WATCH THE MOVIE! The ""Jewish murderous revenge"" theme is there, but it's not really what powers this movie.  It's part of the plot of course, but it's not really the main theme of the movie at all!

The movie is in fact one magnificent multiple hour trolling of the American moviegoer, who, we have been told time and time again won't watch ""movies with subtitles.""  This trolling takes place within the plot as well: It moves along *pretty much in every scene starting in the first scene* by using miscommunication usually including failing to take into account knowledge of foreign languages!  EVERY SINGLE MAJOR PLOT TWIST IS DONE THIS WAY!

Seen this way, Lt. Raine's habit of carving swastikas into his surviving Nazis obviously takes the form ""I have to carve a swastika into your head so people get the message that you're a Nazi!""

I should also mention that Christoph Walz's Hans Landa is one of the most evil chilling Nazis I can remember from all the Nazi movies I've watched.",1511395200,,1509,5.004
3953301,4,B002MZZMRM,"Inglorious Basterds (2009) can be appreciated for its dialogue (traditionally a Tarantino strongpoint) and it's superb acting and direction. However, the film is rather long (2:33), and the dialogue is long-winded and weaves back and forth between German and English. This film seems to be an all or nothing affair; there are long periods of soft, subtle dialogue, followed by jolts of action, with not much middle ground or balance. One thing that I've noticed about the recent Tarantino films is the excessive amount of time it's taking for him to tell a story. This film could've been 2 hours in length, as some of the dialogue doesn't seem necessary. Now for the good stuff: I respect Tarantino as one of the best directors of the past 50 years, as he has a style all his own, and I especially respect the fact that he refuses to cave into digital technology (CGI). His films are still pure and honest efforts, and for that, his films get props from me. Inglorious Basterds is a good film, but not in the category of excellence of his first 3 films in his filmography (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown), but definitely in the top half. This film commands your undivided attention in order to know what's going on, so a passive viewing probably won't resonate very well. The blu ray is loaded with special features that really complement the film, and make this a worthwhile purchase. I recommend Inglorious Basterds.",1510358400,2,1430,4.793522267206478

3953303,2,B002MZZMRM,"The movie was one of the worst I have ever seen; however, it had its good parts and bad parts:

Good Parts

1) The scenes where different foreign languages were used was excellent.  If you want any positive motivation to learn several languages, then this movie will encourage you to do so.  it will also motivate you to know more about the culture particularly how people speak, eat, walk, various body movements, etc.  That British officer knew about German film; however, his body movement of ordering drinks the British way was a dead, and I mean a dead giveaway.

2) The German uniforms used in the movie were also excellent.  The only one thing that was different was that Colonel Landa's collar rank tabs at the farmhouse were an earlier style.  The SS later change them to a different style late on.

Bad Parts

1) There should have been more scenes where Colonel Landa used his Sherlock Holmes' Deductive and Inductive Reasoning plus showing more of that stern face of his liked he displays it at the farmhouse.

2)  Colonel Landa not checking out Emmanuelle Mimieux 's story to see if she really was the owner of the theater and if that was her name.

3) Colonel Landa trusting Lt. Raines.  If he was more like Sherlock Holmes, Landa would not trust Raines at all considering how Raines was putting a swastika on any surviving German soldiers who manage not to be killed by Raine and his men.  Sherlock Holmes would not even treat a common thief with respect.

4) How does a squad of GI survive in France for 3 years since none of them speak French and only one of them spoke German until they got that other guy out of prison who spoke German?  BTW, what happened to the rest of the GI squad?

5) Colonel Landa not checking to see if Brad and his two men were really who they said they are about being from the Italian film industry and not noticing that they had an American accent?

6) Security at the theater was one of the worst I have ever seen in the film.  Only two guards at the door where Adolf Hitler was seating at.  No armed guards outside the theater, inside the main lobby of the theater, and at both the top and the bottom of the stairwell.  In the 1978 movie, The Inglourious Bastards, the rocket train had more security with more armed guards, more machine guns, and an armored cannon turret.

One thing that Landa and Raine had in common was that they pride themselves on their nicknames; however, at the end, both of them did not like those nicknames at all when they were facing each other across the table.",1508889600,,2538,4.457700650759219

I've heard the film was originally supposed to be a miniseries; that would explain a *lot*. In particular, the disappearance of a third of the Basterds from the story and the rushed ending given to the Nazi private's subplot were, I thought, poorly managed.

Truth is.. Mr Quentin is a complete coward. He advocated extreme violence in every single one of his movies; however the thought or need to actually take a human life is so beyond him that it eludes even his own sense of irony. What a turd.

Tarantino is so hypocritical. He has no knowledge of the need for violence; and I suspect he'd never actually have the stomach or backbone for it. Yet he has the nerve to judge others who make a real difference in the world. At the same time he changes the narrative to fit a narrow minded point of view.

3953349,1,B002MZZMRM,"Some parts of this graphic, pseudo-historical, fully-gratuitous horror flick were not badly done. I give one star for the actors.
Brad Pitt was, unfortunately, a characiture of a character. Just seemed like a bit of a joke, too much fake ""accent"" to be believable.
It started out interesting. The SS officer played by Christoph Waltz is a piece of art. He really played that part to the bone. Frankly, his fate in the movie was simply milquetoast. Blah. Not even sort of. He was practically the only reason to watch the movie at all. Boooring.
I expect better from Tarantino. I have seen several of his movies and this is the most disappointing yet.
Frankly, if the actors had been less good, I would have scarcely changed my rating. It's pretty bad all around. This is interesting subject matter and more could have been done with it. Yes, it has a few moments (when Waltz' character is in the restaurant with the movie theatre owner. Very tense. Then he leaves, and she bursts into tears. It was believable. When the German soldier who has a newborn son is at the tavern and tries to stay alive to see his son again, and the actress shoots him...it was a sad moment, but poignant.
The end was just fire, explosions, and more violence.

3953351,2,B002MZZMRM,"No idea how this movie got so many four and five star reviews. It's not a good movie. It does have a fair amount of gratuitous violence maybe what got it so many 4 and 5 Star reviews. The cockamamie plot involves some kind of silly idea of sending a squad of Americans to occupied France to kill Germans to scare the Germans.

There really are only two characters in this movie that are interesting. one is a psychopathic German colonel and the other is a drunken German sergeant celebrating the birth of the son.

Brad Pitt has probably the worst Tennessee accent ever. I can't really recommend this unless you just want to watch a Tarantino film with the requisite graphic violence and a nonsensical story. It's bad enough that at several points in the story I came close to just quitting on it which would have earned it one star in my personal rating system but I sat through the whole thing so it got two stars.",1497139200,2,916,4.414201183431953

3953355,2,B002MZZMRM,"I had really high expectations for this film. Brad Pitt finally teams up with the magnanimous Quentin Tarantino for a WWII story of a group of elite soldiers that murder high ranking Nazi officials. You have comaderie, action and a witty sense of humor. The first 30 minutes of the film are rather good as long as you get used to the violence. The scenes featuring angry Adolf Hitler are rather funny.

The issue arupts when the french woman character appears and somehow ends up doing espionage for the guys. The movie just seems to forget there is a plot and just waddles in endless talking scenes of supporting filler characters that nobody cares about. Adolf is angry and throws temper tantrums but there doesn't seem to be a real villain that will rival the group.

Compare this movie to that awesome and highly underrated Enemy at the Gates starring Jude Law. Jude is a really awesome sniper and it doesn't take long for the Russian army to assign him in an elite mission killing unsuspecting enemies. His success in the war only become hindered when Ed Harris playing a fellow sniper of extraordinary talent shows up and it soon becomes a battle of military tactics and wits. Neither one of the two characters is truly good or evil, they are just two warriors that face off in an extraordinary manner.

To this day, I have never seen the ending of Inglorious Basterds. The lack of a real sense of direction of this film and the forgetable characters just didn't seem to grab m attention long enough to sit through this (4 hour?) film till the very end. I think an edited version of the film that cuts fluff scenes to shorten it would have made it a far better film.",1496102400,,1672,4.548172757475083

 The part of Colonel Hans Landa was also very well written and well played by Christoph Waltz.

I don't knock Brad Pitt's portrayal of Lt Aldo Raine, but it's far from Brad Pitt, or Tarantino's best work.

And that's pretty much how this whole film is,
there's a few surprises, and suspenseful scenes, a few memorable ones, and a some gore.

That's it.

Good for a rental if you need to see every Tarantino movie,
but you could just as easily skip it and not be missing anything.

3953384,3,B002MZZMRM,"Writer/director Quentin Tarantino re-imagines history by matching against each other two amiable psychopaths--one an American Army officer and the other an Austrian Nazi--in a customary Tarantino bloodbath, with nothing less than the outcome of World War II at stake.

Brad Pitt, as the American, ironically has never been quite so appealing, endearing, charismatic, loose, or just plain funny. And character actor Christoph Waltz, as the Nazi, is a real revelation: His performance received not only the Oscar but also most of 2009's other supporting actor awards.

Filled with stylish anachronisms, references to other films, and arch homages to period propaganda, 'Inglourious Basterds,' like the other films in the Tarantino lexicon, is not for all tastes, and most definitely is not recommended for the timid or the squeamish. Additionally, the middle expository interlude bogs down the remarkable momentum of the opening segments but in comparison adds the necessary zing to the climactic hour.

All-in-all, 'Inglourious Basterds' is much, much better than pulp fiction has any right to be. By the end of the picture the knowing viewer might very well be not only laughing at the ultra-violence, but also ravening for more.

Which was probably the whole point.",1487721600,,1266,5.411167512690355

It's how World War 2 should have ended, with brave Bradd Pitt scalping history's worst monsters, that Nazi hunter who has such a great performance that even seeing the actor's Wikipedia page makes me want to reflexively punch something, and an ending so over the top I'm surprised the benny hill theme wasn't playing in the background.

Oddly, it's just not my cup of tea.  For a Tarantino movie, it's raw and rude.  Yes, Tarantino IS raw and rude but his movies seems to fair better.

The long and the short of this flick, for those one or two people who might be reading reviews to see if it's something they want to watch because they know nothing of it, Brad Pitt is LT Aldo Raine.  Now, DO NOT confuse this character with his _other_ WWII character of Don 'Wardaddy' Collier in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fury/dp/B00OLI95R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fury</a>&nbsp;as the only similarity is the uniform.

Brad Pitt dominates whenever he's on screen, an over-the-top no-holds-barred American on a mission to take out as many Nazis as possible, but in order to demoralize them, to do so with as much visible pain and suffering as possible.

Movies like 2012 have a garbage plot that at least moves but the scene with the dairy farmer felt like it lasted thirty minutes because it was so boring.

the head nazi and Brad Pitt is alot of fun. It also has the stunning Diane Kruger. The rest of the cast is outstading as well. Like every Tarantino movie the
performances are just an amazement to watch. It also has one of the coolest, bad ass scenes in movie history at a movie theater. I`ve known alot of people who
hate this movie and couldn`t even finish it and I cant for the life of me figure out why. It is one of Tarantino`s top best which you can pretty much say about all
 of his movies except for the disappointingly terrible Death Proof. As much as I like the Kill Bills they don't come close to the best of his movies
either in my opinion. Just go into Inglourious Basterds knowing that there will be alot of subtitles which makes it even better. This is one great movie",1461456000,2,978,4.344262295081967

If you are squeamish avoid thrillers, or horror movies, or war movies, or westerns, or anything that's not a comedy or romance. People don't watch these films for the violence, the violence  just adds a seriousness to story and the film itself that allows the audience to remain interested and care about the characters and casual movie goers don't seem to realize violence is a means to an end, not just an end.",1456531200,,697,4.531746031746032

Brad Pitt's hillbilly character was pretty entertaining too, as were pretty much every one of these characters.

Some of the scenes in this movie are just heart stopping intense and enthralling.  The opening scene as someone else mentioned.  The dialogue is just irresistible.  And the scene in the basement tavern.  Every time I watch it, I still squirm with uneasiness,  the tension is truly griping.

This movie IS a classic.  It's outlandishness is somehow balanced by incredibly good acting, making the unbelievable become real.

3953593,1,B002MZZMRM,"Quentin Tarantino has long been criticized for the violent nature of his movies. Tarantino has stood by his films and sometimes just avoided questions targeted at the amount of violence they feature. He denies any suggestion that his violent movies are connected to violence in real life. Despite this he has been acclaimed as protesting against ""real life"" gun violence.

It is time to consider his legacy in a somewhat more realistic light: Tarantino is for better or worse an accomplished director, which in Hollywood means that he plays the game according to Hollywood rules while grossing huge profits. Hollywood rules do not require films to be ""realistic"" or true to life, historically correct or logical and as ""Inglorious Bastards"" proves, no subject is sacred, even the Holocaust can be completely distorted and made into sensationalized, fun. Many in American audiences may consider this film some sort of legitimate satirisation of the Nazi's but they laugh at Tarantino's ""jokes"" at the expense of understanding the tragedy of the history that is the subject of this movie, and its historical repercussions today.

For one thing, the movie exploits a cheap trick by portraying its violence as legitimate revenge of its Jewish heroine. The entire Nazi top, including Hitler are burned to death in a cinema, ending the 2nd world war. Wishful thinking? Methinks that there is a subliminal message buried in this film that few viewers will be aware of.

The ""bastards"" are in fact a scavenged group of military men, majority Jewish, who are turned into a commando group charged with attacking and hideously mutilating German soldiers (all of whom are referred to as Nazi's and therefor legitimate targets for the groups tortures, which are necessarily to remain secret owing to the fact that they violate the Geneva conventions). Thus, what the movie is really providing is a legitimation of the USA's contemporary wholesale dismissal of the UN convention on human rights and the Geneva convention. These conventions were mostly upheld by the Germans and the Allies with respect to enemy combatants during the war, albeit not with respect to civilian populations or ""undesirables"".

In addition, very few cases of Jews ""taking revenge"" occurred during the war. Jewish resistance occurred mainly in self-defence and was, on the whole, legitimised by their weakness and vulnerability. Tarantino's legitimation of the inhumanity the ""bastards"" perpetrate in the movie thus proposes that Jews have a legitimate right to ""take revenge"" and the underlying message is thus that the State of Israel has a right to abandon all conventions on human rights to maintain its position because the ""others"" were or are ""evil"". However, Jewish ethics and Israeli laws do not sanction wanton murder or torture. Eichmann, it will be recalled, was given a fair trial in Jerusalem, not scalped. Those who think he ought to have been scalped rather than put on trial seem to think that our best interests are best served by meting our justice directly, without intervention of the law. Tarantino's bastards are a lynch mob. They don't care about justice or humanity, and they are therefore no better than the Nazis. Indeed, in some instances they seem worse. Is this a subliminal hint of Tarantino's that all is not well with the state of the union? I think not. It is more symptomatic of a profound loss of values that this piece of trash should ever be shown to audiences at all.",1454284800,6,3469,5.059440559440559

3953610,4,B002MZZMRM,"Quentin had a blast making this movie, and it shows. And I had a blast watching it. If you want to enjoy this movie, you have to do a little prep work. Get your snacks and beverages all ready, turn off/down your phone, put on your comfy PJs/whatever, make sure the dog(s) are squared away, if you have kids (12 or below) wait until they're in bed, or at the grandparents/cousins, etc, set the thermostat/AC to optimum, adjust the lighting, take care of your head if that's your thing and get yourself situated in your comfiest chair. Take a minute or 3 to relax yourself, sit back & click ""play"".

A few suggestions regarding the actual viewing. First and foremost, remember this is going to be Fun. Quentin had fun making this and he wants us to have fun watching it, so in order for that to happen you're going to have to suspend disbelief. Rid yourself of any preconceived notions or knowledge , any expectation of historical accuracy, any adherence to significant dates or milestones, known sequencing of events, etc., etc.. If you are a WWII buff, and are expecting this movie to engage you on that level or test your expert WWII nerd brain, lose those expectations.

However, that's not to say this movie is not accurate in it's portrayal of the periods atmosphere, paraphernalia, accoutrements, trappings, idiosyncrasies, etc.. It is. Tarantino has brought Nazi-occupied Paris to life for us. His talented eye has captured the moment so adroitly one can almost taste the tension humming through the small knots of random French citizens scattered about, here or there, while, simultaneously, we are  acutely aware of the sadistic, yet placid Gestapo SS officers, who also occupy seemingly random positions along les rues calmes de Paris. I must say, Quentin took the same great care with each and every scene in this film-the staging, the set, the lighting, the mood, the camera placement(s)...it's all there. He's become a real master at his craftwork.

But remember, I said this was a fun movie, and so it is. Now, in order for that to work, a director usually puts more emphasis on the situation than on the performance, generally speaking. It's no different in this movie. That's not to say there aren't some fine performances here, there are. By far, the best role in this film is that of SS colonel Hans Landa, aka the ""Jew Hunter"". The movie turns on this character. So, as this is a Quentin Tarantino movie, iow, a Very Big Deal, the most important role/character in the film, SS colonel Hans Landa, the ""Jew Hunter,"" is not going to be handed to just anyone. This is a role for one of the Big Guns. Clooney? Nope. Bradley Cooper? Nope. Leonardo? Nope. Colin Firth? Nope. Joseph  Gordon-Levitt? Nope. Matt Damon? Nope. Christian Bale? Edward Norton? Gerard Butler? NopeNopeNope!

There was only one Huge Star that could carry this film. Who else could it be but Christoph Waltz?! Wait...who?! Who is that? Christoph Waltz, an Austrian actor, who has done basically zero work in La La Land, was picked...or should I say plucked, to play Hans Lander, Gestapo officer, SS SOB, Jew hunter, carrier of entire Quentin Tarantino production. No big gamble there. Another reason I dig QT--he has balls and he does it his way. And in case you haven't heard, Christoph Waltz f'ing NAILS THIS CHARACTER! Best performance of the year, easily. Oh, what an evil, monstrous, cruel, very scary Nazi SS bastard! But, in a very demented sort-of-way, QT made him kind of interesting and relatable, too. I'm like-hey! I'm not supposed to relate to this creep! Stop it, Quentin! But you can't help it. Oh well. I'll tell you, though, this is one juicy role for an actor. And Waltz (pronounced Walz, me thinks) slam dunks it. He's great in this. Well worth the price of admission.

Brad Pitt is in this, too. He plays Aldo ""The Apache"" Raine, an American ""Special Services"" Lieutenant who puts together a squad of Jewish-American Nazi killers. Their idea of a relaxing afternoon is ambushing, hand-to-hand killing, then scalping Nazi soldiers or watching their fellow hunter, ""The Jew Bear"", beating some Nazi's brains out with a Willy Mays Super Slugger. I mean just going to town, hitting it out of the park, homerun, swinging for the fences head smashing. Gruesome? Yes. This is quite a bloody movie--at least for me. I don't usually go in for the gratuitous, but, in this case, Quentin somehow makes it seem almost cartoonish...imo. Anyway, speaking of cartoonish, Brad Pitt played more of a caricature than a character. Slo una dimension. No depth to his character. Likeable, though. And Martin Wuttke as Adolf Hitler is a scream! Lol! My 2nd favorite character, I think. This movie is just a blast.

Hans tells the father that he's familiar with him and his family, and when the father answers Hans's question, ""Are you aware of my existence?"" you can see the father's eyes light up in anticipation for the impending marriage.

3953640,1,B002MZZMRM,"I know, I know. This is downright blasphemy.

Tarantino (due to TWO terrific films he has made) is now given an automatic pass when he releases a new film. I delayed seeing this for years because of the amount of hype associated with it. The film's plot is a WWII revisionist exercise in which a select group of American soldiers look to wreak havoc inside Europe. The film is action-heavy and production-wise is extremely stylish. Unfortunately, that's about all for the positives.

This film almost immediately sets about being as obnoxious as it possibly can be -- this is a direct result of Tarantino's waning ""style"" in film making. Christoph Waltz plays a German Colonel whose scenes are meant to be terribly suspenseful, but they all land flat due to the most inane, purposeless, drawn-out dialogue I have seen in any film... until I watched a number of other recent Tarantino films. As I said, this drawn-out, meandering dialogue is supposed to create suspense, but all it does is unnecessarily extend the length of MULTIPLE scenes in the film.

And if you think this new style by Tarantino isn't a problem, or that it doesn't seriously detract from his films, I encourage you to (after watching this turd of a film) go back and watch ""Reservoir Dogs"" or ""Pulp Fiction."" The gigantic difference in those two older films is that the dialogue-heavy scenes actually went somewhere towards a conclusion WHILE being genuinely entertaining and in-line with the characters involved. Sadly, Tarantino just seems willing to spew garbage onto his recent scripts and enough hollowwood industry slaves immediately chant about how ""artsy"" and ""stylish"" it is.

The film's sequences are very well choreographed/edited and hard-hitting, but when that's ALL a film has, does that supposedly make it ""good?"" If anyone reading this review still thinks ""Inglorious Bastards"" is actually a good, original film, go watch ""The Dirty Dozen"" and tell me Tarantino didn't try his best (LOL) to steal as much as he could from that film and repackage it as this crap. The best thing I can say about Tarantino's recent style change is that I have yet to actually pay to see it. Thankfully, when Quentin has used a script as toilet paper -- like in this film's case -- I have not paid a cent to him or the industry to see it.",1447804800,3,2304,4.8253164556962025

3953662,4,B002MZZMRM,"This isn't for anyone seeking historical accuracy or a reason to be proud of the U.S. and the Allies.  This movie has only one target audience - Tarantino Fans.  Tarantino doesn't bother with the pretense of ""Good Guys and Bad Guys"".  He just makes a movie where everyone is a Sick F**k.

At the beginning a young Jewish girl, named Shosanna, barely survives the Nazi attack on her family.

The Basterds meet their Commanding Officer, and are then dropped into France, as a Guerrilla Group.  The kill, scalp and terrify the Nazis.  They seemed to appear and disappear at will.  Inspiring the Germans to create, fear induced , nicknames for each.  Watching the suffering of Germans was the only entertainment the Basterds had.

The Climax has the Nazi High command dieing in a burning movie theater.  The film had been replaced with a message of Jewish Vengeance from Shosanna.  Her face was projected onto the smoke, giving it a ghostly appearance as she laughed maniacally.  Hitler was shot at point blank range, with a machine gun - whole clip emptied into him.  All that was before bombs went off.

Lt. Aldo Raine was the psychotic leader of the Basterds.  He hadn't any allegiance to the allies or the U.S.  He killed out of sadistic pleasure.  He tortures and mutilates.  Marking anyone he doesn't kill.

Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz had been a German enlisted man.  Then he killed 13 gestapo officers.  He became infamous among the Nazi's.  They planned to ship him to Germany, to make an example of him.  Once the basterds learned about him, they came for him.  They massacred the prison guards, then gave Stiglitz the chance to go from "" Amateur Nazi Killer"" to ""Professional Nazi Killer"".

Col. Hans Landa, aka the Jew Hunter.  He was quite high in the Nazi ranks, guilty of countless atrocities.  Then at the end he thought he'd just make a deal with the Allies and get away with everything.  They agreed, but Hans made the mistake of surrendering to Aldo.

Hans had been essential in killing Hitler and barbecuing the Nazi High Command.  Aldo had let Nazis live for far less than that.  But his price was always the same. Hans had his deal, he could spin any web of lies he chose.  Still the truth was literally carved into his forehead.",1444089600,,2238,4.656410256410257

3953722,5,B002MZZMRM,"Quentin Tarantino is one of my favorite directors. Pulp Fiction is his best film (and probably my favorite film of all time). But after Pulp Fiction, it's difficult for me to pick which movie is his second best, third best, so on and so forth. This movie is one of his best ones for sure (and one of three to get nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture of the Year). I have two issues with the film. Sometimes I feel it's too silly and the subtitles. Most of the dialogue in this movie from my understand is foreign so the English must be read from subtitles. That means if you're really going to watch the movie, you have to be paying full attention to it (how else would you a watch a movie for the first time though?). Also the subtitles can be difficult to read at times, but for the most part they're alright. Other than this, I really enjoy this film. It's awesome!!

I had to walk out of Pulp Fiction. This film is not a gore-fest at all. There are a couple of scenes that I looked away from; two, in fact, but that's not bad for a modern American film of this length. Most of the film is character interaction and tension building. Being born and raised in the south, I am acutely aware of bad southern accents in movies and TV so I had braced myself for Brad Pitt's version. While he seemed on the verge of losing track of it a few times, over-all it was a fine performance.  All of the characters are well developed, the story is quite good, the acting is truly superb, and my only complaint (SPOILER ALERT) is that Hitler died too quickly and too painlessly--Just like in real life.

The supporting cast, some of which I had never heard of before, were terrific as well. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating was I thought it dragged on in a couple spots. Some of the scenes are unforgettable. The opening scene was brilliant, with Waltz cleverness and nit-picking while puffing on a elaborate pipe. All of the bastards scenes will always be memorable.",1430870400,,497,4.659090909090909

3953792,2,B002MZZMRM,"Please note before you read:  There is a bit of a spoiler alert here, just in case you haven't seen or heard anything about the film.  Let me start by saying, I love most WWII films.  Especially since 1970 when movies became grittier & more realistic, though there are some great older ones as well (Check out To Hell And Back or Battleground).  Even alternate history can be so much fun!  (Fatherland).  This movie however...  Just really didn't do anything for me.  As much as it seemed to be liked by so many, I did not enjoy it.  Over the top acting, ridiculous portrayals, meaningless violence & gore (the kind you expect from a horror film, not WWII action film).  If you enjoyed it, good for you.  I however did not.  I'll stick to Saving Private Ryan, Hope & Glory, A Bridge Too Far & The Big Red One among others.  Part Two:  I recently re-watched this film, & while my rating would not really be any better (maybe 2-1/2 stars total), I do want to be sure to mention that Christopher Waltz's performance as the main Nazi officer is absolutely BRILLIANT!!  This movie is worth at least a one-time viewing for his performance alone.  M&eacute;lanie Laurent also does a tremendous job!  Even Mike Myers & Michael Fassbender have some wonderful performances in smaller parts.  It's the American performances that I find very disappointing.  The group of ""ruffians"" called the Basterds really are lame.  And so are the actors portrayals.  And while the storyline itself is OK, I do not like the ""alternate-reality"" ending.",1429920000,2,1526,4.704545454545454

There are other observations posted that our intrepid heroes are more brutal and underhanded than the Germans. Well ... perhaps we've all become overwhelmingly inundated with the plight of the Jews and holocaust reminders. It's natural to start going a bit numb. After all the Germans were fighting for their homeland. But a closer reading and understanding of German and European history and the events leading up to the 1000 year Reich indicates that the mindset of the culture represented in this movie was focused on annihilation of entire ""races"" of people. Every human being within reach of the Nazis and not part of the Aryan master race (as defined by madmen) was to be worked and starved to death. It was all meticulously planned out. See - Wannsee Conference as recorded by Adolf Just Following Orders Eichmann. Or how about - The Hunger Plan of Herbert Backe. Read it and weep. Great evil has always existed in the hearts of men but thru the process of evolution this evil evolved into an ultimate horror - the Nazis. Bear Jew batting a thousand - right on.

Gotta say, Brad Pitt is right up there with Nicolas Cage (Con Air) as for getting the ""accent"" down.  My only complaint is .. the subtitles flashed by too fast, and the text color was very difficult to read .. this on a new 46"" 3D Samsung from 8 feet .. so that cost a Star.

3953905,5,B002MZZMRM,I'm writing this review because this is my favorite Tarantino film although I absolutely love Reservoir Dogs but this movie had my heart racing so intense from start to finish. My favorite scene by Tarantino I've ever seen is the death scene of Frederick Zoller so beautiful. Pretty much a absolutely bad ass movie. I love Eli Roth's performance as Donnie Knots when he is reloading clip after clip unloading on the theater full of Nazis.

Inglourious Basterds is his best movie yet, even better than Jackie Brown and Reservoir Dogs, and he seems to know it. Theres no might about it. Its a masterpiece. Its also one of the best movies Ive ever seen.

The story takes place during WW2 as Nazis, led by Hitler, seize control of France, killing Jews along the way. Their opposition? A small troop of Jewish soldiers whose primary goal is to kill Nazis and off their scalps for souvenirs. Its a brutal battle with clever crossplots; scenes simmer with suspence until someones killed once their cover is blown; thrown in for narrative measure.

3953941,1,B002MZZMRM,"Ill start by saying I enjoy some Tarntino movies such as True Romance (Awesome) and Resivior Dogs but this was garbage. Its two and a half to three hours of nothing but talking with some action every once in a while. 1st Brad pitt was terrible I couldn't stand to hear him talk and the rest of the basterds what a joke. 2nd to try and paint the basterds as some heros is a joke, theres a scene when we first see the basterds and they ambush Germans but the Germans seem like the more heroic ones by not giving up info and selling out the rest of thier guys. 3rd to have every high ranking offcial from the German high command attend a movie premier in an occupied country at the height of the war is absurd. I know its fiction but im sure there are people who might believe it as actual history. How does a peasant farm girl end up owning a theater in Nazi occupied France so quickly after her family is killed makes no sense. The rest was just watching a bunch of boring conversations in french and german for up to 30 mins at a time while they just sit around at tables. This was just an absurd concept and complete waste of both time and money. I paid $4 and that was $4 too much. Tarintino hasn't put out anything good since Jackie Brown. Its amazing to see such high regards for this film from the critics it was just terrible.

3953953,5,B002MZZMRM,Extreme violence and linguistic intrigue make this far-fetched film incredibly watchable. Brad Pitt is extraordinary in his role as terrorist leader. Wonderful close interactions of antagonists-protagonists.,1420416000,,207,7.0
3953954,5,B002MZZMRM,"I thought it was brilliant. Loved the characters, loved the plot. As usual people attack the violence in the movie as it is a Tarantino flick. And I'll just say this right off the bat, it's awesome. Nobody depicts violence in movies the way Tarantino does and it seems like some people aren't getting it. The violence that is here is very abbreviated and very brutal, but there isn't a ton of it. I didn't want most of this characters to die, some you do, but mostly I'm in awe of what's happening to these characters because you don't want to see them harmed. That's the difference for me at least. It's not supposed to be people sitting there cheering for characters to be killed. It's a brutal movie but it isn't depraved, it has some taste and isn't all about gratuitous violence. I've hope I made my point clear.

Moving on, what I feel works in this movie is that it's basically a WWII comic book come to life. Yes, most of the characters are stereotypes but it works. Nothing is too crazy or silly, it's just a lot of fun. The movie rides this fine line between humor and being a downright serious revenge flick. It's a very stylized movie, of course, it's Tarantino. Perhaps however this may be his most brilliant film yet in terms of style and substance. The settings are beautiful, acting is top notch, the visuals spectacular, etc.

In closing, I think it's really quite something when a movie can ride this fine line between being realistic and comic booky. So many war movies get mixed together and feel the same. When you watch a WWII movie that is original like this it really sticks out of the crowd. It's a nice change of pace from the typical heavy war movie. There's not one scene in this movie that you would get confused with something else. It's pure original Tarantino and its a joy to watch.",1420416000,,1815,4.463855421686747

We finally broke down and watched Django Unchained a couple of weeks ago and instantly became fans of Christoph Waltz. So we figured, why not try Inglourious Basterds.

It's pretty obvious Tarantino has matured a little over the past few years. Before, I absolutely could not stand to watch his long egotistical ""look how intellectual I am"" dialogues...blatantly trying to show off his nerdy ideas through people like John Travolta and Tim Roth. The big difference now is he has finally come across a good enough actor (Waltz) to make his silly long dialogues watchable....not only watchable, but masterfully done.

If you can get past the Tarantino signature throughout the movie (copycatting, over-directing, nerdy attempts to shock and the ever present ""look it's me...look how smart I am""), you'll probably like the movie. BTW, as in all Tarantino movies - the characters being robbed from previous movies....I'm pretty sure Brad Pitt's character is robbed from Warren Oates' Dillinger character from the 70's. Still, a good job though.

I agree with another reviewer...there are glimpses of greatness in some of his movies....just glimpses, and then there's the ""look at me"" signature again. I guess that's probably great for worshipers of the man, but it has to be a damn good movie for me to want to watch a director rather than the film. Oops, there goes another trick, robbed from great directors...the director stamp...only...the problem is you have to be original if you want intelligent folks to appreciate your signature all over the movie. If Quentin Tarantino can just mature a little and make a movie without robbing most of it from previous films...stop trying to show how intelligent he is by over displaying great director techniques...yes, Quentin, we all know it means you're classy and intelligent when you use subtitles...especially when you flash them so fast that only the elite can read them...Anyway, if he can just try to make an original full length, uncontrived movie without trying to constantly show off, he will probably make a great film, one day.",1416355200,5,2223,5.0027027027027025

I saw this film when it came out in the movie theatre, and once it was released on Blue Ray I had to own a copy. I really enjoyed this movie, the only thing is you have to be able to read subtitles for a long time without getting board with it, didn't really bother me that much. I think that had he shot the whole thing in English then you would lose a lot of the context / feel with different scenes.

Obviously this is not a historically accurate documentary type movie, but there is still some realism to it and Tarantino does a good job of portraying a lot of the emotions that you would expect to have been in the air during that time period. Overall though there are quite a few things that are pretty accurate.

3954053,5,B002MZZMRM,"Loved this film. Tarantino nails it once again. Of course, this film has been reviewed so many times that it becomes quite challenging to bring anything new to the table. Really, all I can do is offer my own personal, select aspects I found most enjoyable. First and easily foremost is the outstanding performance of Christoph Waltz as the Nazi SS man Hans Landa. He takes over every scene in a disturbingly polite way that disarms you, belying his true evil nature as a tool of Hitler's Germany. My second favorite aspects of the film were every scene in which the Basterds inflicted their own form of warfare on the German army and, later, the High Command. I don't think, this point, there is anyone who hasn't seen the film, but I won't offer any spoilers here. I do believe this is one of my favorite 100 movies of all time. I am a HUGE film buff, usually a movie a day, so while that sounds like a silly number, when you do the math, it's really saying something (again, at least for me). If you enjoy Tarantino, this one's easily a winner (though I couldn't sit through Jackie Brown). But if you just love movies, it's also a winner. Unless you really can't tolerate violence - and why would you consider a Tarantino film if you can't - then I think this is just one of those films you have to see at least once in your lifetime.",1414454400,8,1336,4.3694779116465865

3954068,5,B002MZZMRM,"Though its title would suggest an exploitation flick, Tarantino decides to throw a curve ball by delivering one of the best movies of the entire decade.  I did not want to see this movie when I saw the trailer, thinking it was going to be an over the top profanity laced piece of garbage that tend to permeate the theaters these days.  When people I know had told me they did not like the movie and it was not what they thought it was going to be it truly peaked my interest.  Could it be this movie wasn't going to be the vile romp I had imagined?  Needless to say I was astounded by how good this movie turned out to be.  ""well that was because your expectations were low going in"" one might say, maybe, but I don't think so.  Lets start by the films opening sequence,  This has got to be one of the most suspenseful moments on film worthy of Hitchcock at his vintage best.  It is a quietly intense moment that erupts into brutality jolting the viewer and setting the tone for the entire film.  Inglorious Basterds is one brilliant set piece after another.  each chapter, (for the most part) is superbly acted and told.  Tarantino adds such technique and visual style to his films that only add to the superb writing.  Focusing on the writing for a moment, I was expecting a lot more of that classic Tarantino dialogue, those snappy one liners that make your sides split with laughter. This movie wasn't really going for that,  most of the dialogue is kept more in a serious tone with just a few sprinkles of that dialogue.  This is fine to me because I don't think it would have fit well with this particular film.  The photography is beautiful and the early forties era convincing.  The acting for the most part is superb.  Waltz deservedly one the Academy award for his role as the head Nazi.  He is truly sinister and the way he toys with his victims before he kills them is nerve shredding.  Pitt on the other hand is pretty awful.  This guys performance is bad.  I know some liked his comedic characiture of the head Nazi hunter but I couldn't get over how his bad performance kept taking me out of the story.  Thank goodness his role was limited.  The movie is over violent in spots, I wasn't crazy about that aspect of the film.  Fortunately the violence doesn't take over the movie.  One could easily fast forward over a few scenes to avoid them.  I will wrap this up by writing that Inglourious Basterds is absolutely worth checking out for any film lover.",1413849600,,2468,4.416851441241685

3954072,4,B002MZZMRM,"All Quentin Tarantino movies are low and crass.  They are low in that the director deliberately explores the dark side of humanity and adds seemingly un-necessarily gore, foul language, and criminality.  This movie, Inglorious Basterds is no different.  In addition to the above there is a pile of dialogue that increases the dramatic tension, while at the same time that dialogue runs the risk of boring the audience until the blah-blah-blah ends with a shoot-out, clubbing, knifing, etc.  In true Tarantino style movie is ugly and crass, but it says more about modern day American Society than anything else.

Godwin's Law & The Ever Present Impact of World War II on the American Mind

Godwin's Law states that the longer an online discussion occurs the probability of a comparison to Hitler and the Nazi's approaches 1.  In other words, in nearly every argument over the issues of the day, someone will bring up an analogy to Hitler.  This is because the history of the Second World War and the shadow of Hitler still has an enormous impact on the American Mind.  While this hold is perfect, exactly what Hitler was, and WWII was like, is imperfectly understood.  Tarantino embraces this by crafting a movie with absolutely no historical accuracy, but uses WWII and Hitler as a prop to critique the film industry in particular and American Society in general.

With that in mind, the plot follows the stories of several characters.  First, is ""Jew Hunter"" Hans Landa, an SS Colonel.  He seeks out a hiding Jewish Family of Dairy Farmers (perhaps an allusion to Fiddler on the Roof).  He kills all but Shosanna Dreyfus who escapes to carry out her vengeance later in the film.

Next is American Tennessee Hill-Billy Aldo Raine.  He is a Special Forces soldier (remember there is no historical accuracy here) who is leading a team of Jews to kill German occupying troops in France.  The Germans are naturally killed in Tarantino style.  Survivors have swastikas carved on their heads.

The plot then turns on SS Private First Class Fredrick Zoller.  This simple soldier is a War Hero, having killed many Americans in Italy.  Propaganda Chief Joseph Goebbels decides to make a movie on the soldier's exploits and screen the movie in Paris.  Thus the both the plot thickens and the messages of the movie begin to clarify.  In this case, Tarantino shows Movie Executives and the back-room deals made to get a movie to production as little more than evil, ""Nazi"" schemes.  When the movie is shown, the audience is portrayed as a feckless, vapid force who cheer at campy scenes of excess violence.  The message of the moral shallowness of movies is clearly shouted.

A Warped View of World War II Still Shapes American Foreign & Military Policy

The film then very ably takes a look at World War II and its impact on current American Foreign Policy. In this case this idea is fleshed out by an American Force running around occupied France.  The American force is a group of Jews led by a Hill Billy from Maynardville, Tennessee.  Lieutenant Raine's speech to his newly assembled group of Jewish Commandos sent to Occupied Europe to make trouble sounds exactly like every bit of propaganda sent by Washington DC's political elite to get the rubes in flyover country to support whatever dubious bombing policy is going on.

Here is an excerpt, ""...we're gonna be doin' one thing and one thing only... killin' Nazis. Now, I don't know about y'all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the *expletive deleted* Smoky Mountains, cross five thousand miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a *expletive deleted* air-o-plane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity. Nazi ain't got no humanity. They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hatin', mass murderin' maniac and they need to be dee-stroyed. That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearin' a Nazi uniform, they're gonna die...""

Does this sound unpolished but familiar?  In other words, America's policy outlook is warped by a view of World War II.  That view doesn't help matters in the real world.

There is also the sense of the Abu Grabe scandal, where US troops from Appalachia torture Iraqi's based on policy set forward by Jewish Neoconservatives seeing things through a WWII prism.

Jewish Power in Film Industry is Eternal Vengeance

Lieutenant Raine says his unpolished but familiar speech to his men-who are all Jews.  When this movie was being promoted, actor Eli Roth had some remarks about how great it was to play the part of a Jewish Avenger in Raine's platoon.  However, Roth seemed to miss the point that the movie was quite possibly the most anti-Semitic movie since Jud S.  Only two Jews, Roth's character ""The Bear Jew"" and Shosanna Dreyfus stand out as characters with any individuality, and they are both individually cruel and evil.  The rest of the Jews in Raine's commando platoon are ciphers of the 1940 Jewish Stereotype.  They somewhat mindlessly (and ironically) strap bombs on themselves to blow up Hitler (and themselves) and his entourage at the theater.

The fact that the Jews were all so alike reminded this reviewer of how Aryans and non-Aryans were portrayed in ancient art from Egypt to China.  In China, for example, the Aryan Tocharians were given individual features while the Chinese around them were portrayed as flat, lifeless and exact-copy images.  In the same way, the Greeks in art are individuals with real features while the Egyptians, Babylonians, and others are very flat and lifeless.  This exact set up in the film seemed to loudly show those earlier forms of race in art, and it was too loud a feature to be an accident.

Next, the Bear Jew is portrayed as a very ugly character who murders Nazis.  Bear Jew's victims are all portrayed as brave men who die stoically.  Finally, and most importantly Shosanna Dreyfus returns under a different identity- Emmanuelle Mimieux.  Her Jewish name is gone (Like Spain's Conversos?) and she is operating a Paris Theater, the same theater where Hitler will attend the screening and the same theatre Lieutenant Raine's platoon will blow up.  Mimieux is gallantly courted by the SS Soldier Zoller but Mimieux leads him on, while she plans to use burning film to immolate the Nazi High Command at the movie primier.  Again, Mimieux is a dark character, a femme fatale and a person scheming for revenge.  She is also involved in a sexual relationship with a colonial French Negro.  Tarantino uses much race-mixing in his films, but one can't help see this as a deliberate plot to highlight the sordidness of his characters, not as a politically correct consummation of Brown vs. Board and MLK's ""I Have a Dream"" malarkey.  In the end, Hitler and the movie goers are destroyed (by the suicide bombers and Mimieux) with the voice of the Jewess Mimieux speaking through the flames, ""...THIS is the face... of Jewish vengeance!""

The symbolism is too powerful to ignore.

There are other characters and themes which help move the movie along, and of course things wrap up with SS Colonel Landa getting a swastika carved in on his head, thus all Germans, are marked as Nazi's for all time with the face of Jewish vengeance shown in every movie.",1413763200,,7209,4.830480847595762

As with all Tarantino, it must be expected that there is going to be excessive violence, and Basterds doesn't shirk in that regard. My issue with the violence is that it's done in a way that seems more like porn, or violence for the sake of violence, rather than it being used as a cinematic tool to immerse us in the world in question. Much of what Tarantino does is so over the top, I'm not sure I'm qualified to ascertain what world he's thinking about, frankly.

It's certainly not perfect and, admittedly, a bit of a fantasy within a WW2 context.  But, Tarantino is, basically, a master story-teller.  Here, he continues his tradition of placing great characters into memorably tense dialogue sequences and balancing over-the-top violence with lots of humor (some of which is so politically incorrect that I often found myself thinking, ""Now, why did I laugh at that?"").  The acting is very good.  The standout is Christoph Waltz, who is amazing as a super-charming, incredibly evil SS officer.  Brad Pitt and several others do great jobs as well as unusual characters.  If you can watch the violence as ""this wasn't real - it's just the movies"", Inglourious Basterds can be a most enjoyable film to watch.",1412294400,,849,4.813793103448276

3954163,5,B002MZZMRM,"Handsome Actor - Brad Pitt stars and out does himself, in the role of: Lieutenant Aldo Raine aka Aldo the Apache. In this Quentin Tarantino, color, 2-disc, unique DVD presentation of: INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS. You can't help but be riveted to this melodrama and Aldo's mission and purpose, loyalty to a cause and his hilarious, down home, no nonsense portrayal of a brave, justice and vengeance-minded American, in Europe during World War II. Who, together with his small band of like-minded INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, wants to take down Hitler and his henchmen with only a handful of his own. Aldo's philosophy is very simple: An eye-for-an-eye mentality and then some, and a merciless payback for every ""...Jew hating Nazi!"" With the targeted, bull's eye prize, being Hitler, himself. So, with the conviction that 'less is more' quality wise, Lt. Aldo the Apache and his courageous few, penetrate and immerse themselves deep within the evil sewage and wicked, septic tank terrain of the Jewish and freedom hating, Nazi executioners and their wanna-be's. And, when they come upon a Nazi encampment, Sargent Donny Donovitch also known as: ""The Bear Jew"" with his handy-dandy, specialized baseball bat, is just one the unique little 'calling cards' that together with his other INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, let's you know that Aldo and company, were in the neighborhood. Why? For a very graphic and definitive, one-time and one-time only, ""this is personal, not business"", visit. Human carnage, wise. And although the story and content within this film is fictional, based on the true-life history of World War II, it is plausible. All in all, this motion picture is an engaging and entertaining film, complete with action, adventure and pockets of humor. But, due to the very graphic violence, bloodshed and subject matter, this is not exactly a movie for the kiddie's. That said, this is Quentin Tarantino's' best work thus far, and Brad Pitt absolutely shines, in his role. An outrageous, World War II film with a Tarantino twist... to be sure, and with a very original ending. Enjoy and shalom, Nina Kish",1406937600,5,2091,5.099125364431487

3954168,2,B002MZZMRM,"First, a caveat:
I DETEST Quentin Tarantino.
I detest him for his clearly Sado masochistic leanings-------the man is clearly a DISGUSTING Sadist who enjoys making pulp (yes, I know.....) and cannot stop himself from offering us his vacuous, yet sometimes entertaining product.

But, primarily, and what is the concern for writing this review is that, as my title alludes he is incapable of offering his fans (and I believe there is a serious fan base out there) a profound examination of character.
I gave him the benefit of the doubt in my title, and yet the truth is that, as they are a dime-a-dozen, thousands of directors are incapable at a shadow of characterization. Therefore, this poor human being, who has always longed to be an auter constantly churns out film after fim of mildly (and sometimes greatly) entertaining films that have no profound, humanistic value whatsoever.

The ""laughable"", but more to the point, infuriating reason for disappointment is that there are so many glimpses of near-greatness in some of his films, making it appear that indeed there is so much more in this man's talent than his movies expose, and his profound fears of making a ""straight-on"" film makes you angry (for a few minutes) and feeling pitiful for this repulsive creature. And repulsive he is. His ego is GIGANTIC and he expresses himself in the most pseudo-intellectual of ways, while so many people fall for his ""shtick""........

The movie at hand is a perfect example. Unlike his, arguably, ""masterpiece"" Reservoir Dogs, a simple, direct wallowing in low-life violence and depravity (quite successfully, and yet bringing to mind ""Clockwork Orange"" and its OWN wallowing in depravity in the sophisticated, richly characterized anti-hero-------and that's where the analogy ends), from the title of the movie to its silly, ridiculous ending you have a director wasting his ""precious"" (if, again, minimal) talents------- on grandiloquence, kitsch, baffling, perplexing endings to scenes that have the power to move you quite deeply and are destroyed by stupid music, CAMP, perplexing dialogue, a (forgive me, but allow it from me, a gay man) QUEEN's take on the human condition (queen, for those unfamiliar, an effete, effeminate homosexual whose histrionics deeply try to conceal his vacuousness).

The film has quite a lot of moments of serious, searing drama, before it's destroyed by ""Melo--drama"".
The hair-raising long take on the girl's being taken by force to meet Goebbels, ending with that cigarette butt is heart-breaking, and the characterization by the actress who handles it is magnificent.
And yet the scene at the beginning of the movie, until he manages to make you laugh with the take on Hitler, turns out insulting, and fills you with anger.
Insisting on ""entertaining"" us, again, the villain of the movie has his tongue firmly on his cheek throughout the film, and nothing confirms this if not the ending with its profoundly disappointing denouement.
Pitt plays the character exquisitely as directed, I can safely assume, with a parody and an accent that come to exhaust you as it proceeds. Yet his is a wonderful performance.
Forget about plot. ALL that Tarantino is interested is in shocking you and plot remains secondary, if not tertiary in its convoluted, confusing absurdities filled with GIGANTIC holes. Keep a notebook next to you, if you are one to pay little attention between the shenanigans.
And so we have yet another WASTED moment in the career of a pseudo-auteur terrified (I hope, if indeed he does have it in him, and I repeat that those moments of somewhat deep resonance would prove this) of making a ""straight-on"" film. What demons could drive this man to continue to produce somewhat entertaining schlock that leaves you feeling so disappointed, so angry at having ""wasted"" 3 hours on something that could have been so superior remains a mystery to me.
You can see how conflicted one can be with this man.
I don't expect things to change.

3954197,4,B002MZZMRM,"Inglorious Basterds is, like some of Scorsese's, Paul Thomas Anderson's, Welles', and Sergio Leone's films, an operatic work about death -- or Death -- which is also amused about its own circling and coiling (and coiling and circling) around it. The best way to describe films like this is to compare them to Baroque art, a style of painting and sculpture that invites intense, even unbalanced emotional responses. Think of Bernini's intensely sexual sculptures against Michaelangelo's sculptures that show a balance of sensuality and intellect. Baroque films are edited so that scenes wittily push (or ram) together fear and comedy, anxiety, a dreamlike something in their preparation for violence, and humor. And characters take each other in often as pieces of theater, and perform for each other. As in opera they can be expressing themselves with a nearly cartoon exaggeration even as they unexpectedly stir emotions: I am dying, they seem to sing, with their guns, and this is my song of death.

Song, and music in general, is key to any Tarantino film, from Reservoir Dogs (""Stuck in the Middle With You"") to Pulp Fiction (""Flowers on the Wall"") and Jackie Brown (""Didn't I Blow Your Mind This Time""). In Inglorious Basterds the key is the Morricone-like soundtrack that, as in Leone's films, asks us to feel the joy of the filmmaking -- the bravura assembly of images -- as well as take in more deeply the unfolding story. In this case, it is a tall tale, with many moving parts: a group of wild American Jews are put together by the American military in World War II to kill and scalp Nazis, and as the story spins up from scenes such as the early one in the German forest with the killing of a German soldier by baseball bat, we come, perhaps naturally, to an attack on the Fuhrer himself in a movie theater which has most recently played a G.W. Pabst film starring Leni Riefenstahl. There is the leader of the Basterds (played with opera buffa joy by Brad Pitt), there is the escaped Jewish girl (played with fragility and steel by Melanie Laurent) and, among a couple of dozen other speaking parts, there is the ""Jew Hunter,"" played by Christoph Walz with a certain kind of aesthete's lightly curtailed rage that is exciting, terrifying and nervily humorous to watch. It is a film of wrought performances, and Walz's is the best.

3954234,1,B002MZZMRM,"No wonder it was nominated for an Academy Award. This film is a Jew's wet dream.  It is supposedly about a group of Jewish-American soldiers during WWII running amok Europe, unimpeded, committing atrocities on Nazis and ultimately ending up, yes, killing Adolf Hitler and the whole Nazi scumbag hierarchy! In a French movie theater! (Of course! Hey! Makes sense to me!)

You didn't know that Hitler and Goebbels were assassinated by Jews in Paris inside a movie theater? Well, neither did I. I guess I missed this little fact in my history class.

What is the most amazing thing about this stupid movie is that it was made by Quentin Tarantino. WTF? What was this man thinking?

There is one ironic element in the movie. I know that there were people in the audience chortling and laughing during the movie. In the movie itself, Hitler and the other Nazi cretins are chortling and laughing as they watch a tasteless movie of a German soldier killing Allied soldiers. Mmmm. Oh, the irony! The irony!",1399334400,5,998,4.7514450867052025
3954235,5,B002MZZMRM,"So, this movie definitely deviates from your typical Tarantino gore, which, for some, may be a blessing.  That being said, you may want to walk into the film with a different outlook on what is going on.  The parts that are typical are the humor mixed with gore, the wonderful dialogue, the fantastic and totally unheard of unrealistic situations that realistic people find themselves in, and the dividing up of the movie into chapters.

Not so typical of Tarantino is just how heavy the dialogue is.  There are scenes that consist almost entirely of people sitting and talking.  On the upside of this, and a reason why a star isn't taken away, is that the conversations are nail bitingly suspenseful and so well done that a mini-masterpiece is presented to you in these moments.  At a running time of 2 hours and 33 minutes you would think those moments unwelcome, but it becomes quite the contrary.

The story itself is, as I mentioned before, totally fantastical.  It centers around a Jewish female who lives in Nazi-occupied France.  Her name is Shoshanna and a stupendous character by the name of Col. Hans Landa played by Christoph Waltz kills her entire family.  She escapes and hides within France, owning and operating a movie theater.  There is a flip side to the main character in Lt. Aldo Raine, played by Brad Pitt.  He puts together a platoon of Jewish shoulders, goes to France, and proceeds to wreak havoc on Hitler's plans by not only killing Nazis, but scalping them as well.  They call themselves ""The Basterds"".  The story weaves between the two without them ever meeting, but both have the task and the desire to destroy the regime.

Quentin Tarantinos Nazi-killing story borrows a similar title and basic storyline from 1978s The Inglorious Bastards starring a cigar-chomping badass (Fred Williamson) and directed by Enzo G. Castellari. This does not mean that Basterds is a remake, but rather a tip of the old hat to Casterllari and his little known film, right down to the horrible and hilarious impersonations of Italians towards the end of the film.

3954245,5,B002MZZMRM,"This is my second favorite Tarantino movie (after the legendary ""Pulp Fiction""). In fact, IMO this is the best movie he has done SINCE Pulp Fiction (Jackie Brown was very good but a little too slow paced for my taste; Kill Bill I and II were disastrous, IMO; and I am probably one of the few who hated Django because some of the scenes in that movie were so unsavory they made me physically ill).

What did I like about this movie? Firstly there are the performances, several of them from new, breakout stars: Christopher Waltz, of course, is the film's true revelation. He plays SS Colonel Landa whose task it is to hunt for Jewish fugitives in Nazi occupied France. Waltz plays the character in a very interesting fashion. He never gives the impression that he truly hates Jewish people and wants them eradicated. He additionally does not give the impression that he is intensely loyal to the Nazi party and wants soley to see its goals carried out (as was the case with Joseph Goebbels, also featured in the film). He is simply is a professional, a detective of sorts whose job is to discover the whereabouts of wanted fugitives, and then secure their capture. That his job has unsavory aspects to it does not unsettle him, nor does it, in some perverse manner, motivate him. It simply is what it is, and as a professional he must pursue it to its logical conclusion.

The film also features excellent performances by Micheal Fassbender (this being his first big commercial film), the stunning beauty Diane Kruger (as the double agent Bridget Von Hammersmark), and August Diehl, who plays a cunning and ruthless SS Officer with remarkable authenticity. Brad Pitt surprising does an excellent job in this film as tough as nails Lieutenant ""Apache"" Raine. I say surprsingly, because Pitt has had to redefine himself as he enters  middle age. He can no longer sell movies based on his hearthrob status of his 20s and 30s (where he basically had to just show up and hordes of women were guaranteed to go watch his movies). In his search for a new identity, he has had his share of flops (eg. I thought he was terrible in ""Moneyball""). But with this movie, it appears he found a role that suits him to a tee. Namely, that of a kind of tough guy, a poor man's John Wayne, complete with generous amounts of wit, charm, charisma and humor.

Beyond the acting, the movies story and script is first rate. My favorite scene in the movie, just a classic Tarantino scene that would be right at home in a movie like ""Pulp Fiction"", is the tavern scene towards the middle of the film. This is where British Agent Micheal Fassbender must make a rendezvous with his contact, double agent Bridget von Hammersmark. Now Hammersmark happens to be a famous German actress, and she is approached in the tavern by a regiment of off duty German soldiers (several of whom are getting alarmingly drunk). When Fassbender is finally able to pry her away from these admirers, a covert SS Officer, played brillantly but August Diehl, makes a surprise entrance, and, suspicious of Fassbender's curious German accent, decides to interrogate him and his party. The scene is brillantly scripted, and the tension between the aggressive Diehl and the calm and collected Fassbender is palpable. This scene alone makes the movie worth watching.

No career revivals or starters here. I found Brad Pitt's character both laughable & unbelievable.

Some cast members performed well, but none were memorable or deserving of award.

QT succeeded in making the allies (headlined by Jews) look worse than the Germans. Why would he do that?

Parts of the movie were amateurish caricature portrayals like something out of a Max Payne movie. Was that intentional? If so, those parts didn't work for me.

Although parts of the movie were excellent, others fell far below the standards set by Pulp Fiction (which is looking more & more like luck on Tarantino's part).

I've seen all Tarantino's movies many times apiece, and now I have to say I think Inglourious Basterds is truly his masterpiece.  It's so damn great!  The music, the subtitles, the subtlety  of Christoph Waltz' ferocious character juxtaposed to the brash good ol' boy of Brad Pitt!  The campy revenge porn right alongside the complex ambiguity that Daniel Bruhl's character seems to feel about his own accomplishments in battle.  All that glourious French and German language!

blown to kingdom come, decapitated, dying and dead.

In a word; Awesome.

There's a misconception that Tarantino does action movies; this is incorrect. He has his own unique style
cinematic mastery, in which we get violence, great characters, awesome dialogue, and a great story concept.

That being said, what's wrong with this movie? Nothing.
Now on principal I can't call it perfect, even though it's damn near it, but I can say it's a Masterpiece;

The sophomoric screenplay includes stopping the action to display the names of characters with arrows pointing to the actors in bold, seemingly humorous fonts. The plot centers around an American military leader, Lt. Aldo Raine, (Brad Pitt) who orders 8 Jewish soldiers to mutilate and kill Nazis. Pitt's dreadful performance as an obnoxious laughing, head bopping cowboy is an insult to the discipline and dignity of the American military. One of the Jewish soldiers laughs, jerks himself around, & shouts ""WHOO-HOO, OUT OF THE PARK!"" after killing & dismembering a Nazi, which is an insult to the educated people he is supposed to represent, & not acceptable as a person of that time.

3954292,4,B002MZZMRM,"""Inlgourious Basterds"", despite what some critics have written, is, I believe, the best of Tarantino's writing so far. The man stated in interviews that he felt it was his best writing thus far, and I agree with him--the passion for movies really shows up here. I don't like comparing his work to his previous or future efforts because they are all a little bit different in many places. But, really, the writing and imagination is on spot here, with elements of satire, horror, mystery, and violence all thrown together into one great exploitation hodgepodge that works every time. This one feels very much like a movie to me, and that makes all the difference! I keep thinking of a film like ""To Be or Not to Be"" by Mel Brooks (a remake, no less), and this film reminds me of what I liked about that film. Here, Tarantino has not abandoned his sense of humor, and the scenes are much more patiently written and equally intense. Maybe I like it a lot more because it is like a love letter to the movies--and historical accuracy (and all these complaints about misrepresentations of war crimes on racist oriented grounds) is not what counts here. I was skeptical at first about the casting of Brad Pitt and Eli Roth, but I enjoyed them both here, probably because they entered into it with a sense of humor as well. It might be absurd in its plot, but the complaints about the film including multi-lingual scenes with subtitles are unfounded because this is what great fun cinema is about. I enjoy the films set in World War 2, even though is a complete fantasy, but it's revenge story is pretty neat--Pitt is hilarious in this film, and even though the Americans (and Jewish-Americans) vs. the Nazis calls up the same old simple-minded views about good and evil in the human heart, one never gets the sense that ""Inglourious Basterds"" is supposed to be harmful--it's just well-paced, violent, and memorable good times, taking a pretty strong satirical view of revenge.
The DVD is a bit light on the extras (no commentary track from a historian or even Tarantino, that would have been neat), but I may eventually spring for the 2-disc for this one, and I usually don't care too much about the extras on Tarantino's films. Overall, though, I had no problems with my disc, and the picture and sound were fantastic. I'm kind of sorry that I passed this one up when it was out at the theaters, but I feared another ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Reservoir Dogs""--this one is certainly more distinguished (and less brutally profane) than those other two.

3954293,3,B002MZZMRM,"Have enjoyed QT's works but this one seemed to lack the connected-ness between scenes and solid story telling from start to finish that I hope for.  It starts with Pitt's officers breaking in the squad of Jewish soldiers, and from the title, and the trailer, one would think this is QT's version of ""The Dirty Dozen.""  However, after the Bear Jew scene very little attention is placed on the squad of Jewish soldiers really.  Rather the story switches more to the British agent who portrays a German film critic and the Jewish girl who is living in France as the owner of a movie theater.  The dialogue is good in any language and the acting is generally very good.  The ending here is gloriously or should I say goreiously ridiculous.

3954306,3,B002MZZMRM,"I'm a big Tarantino fan. Loved Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Kill Bill. They're some of my favorite movies. But this was just a waste of time. The movie itself is OK. And perhaps it's better than many movies out there. But as a Tarantino flick, it's just seriously pathetic.

The dialog was good, but not great, as it usually is. The editing was OK--not the sharp, perfect, awesome edits we normally see. And the plot itself was silly and ridiculous. Granted, this movie was somewhat comedic. But, still, you expect the plot to unwind into a nice climax. Instead, it just fizzed out in silliness.

I have to say, though, that the movie started out very strong. The first scenes were great, and expertly done. And the suspense of where the film was going was great. But then it just devolved into this ridiculous nonsense that made me more angry that I had wasted 2 1/2 hours on this nonsense than anything else. Days later, I'm STILL angry that I wasted time on this drivel.

It seems to me that QT is trying hard to be ""respected"" by mainstream Hollywood here, rather than being seen as a violence-loving outcast.

First, the foul language, which is almost a hallmark of his films, is mostly absent. I'm no fan of foul language. But the sudden shift to a more mainstream language seemed odd.

Also, while there were shootings and the like here, it was pretty sanitized. And in the few scenes that had explicit violence, the camera turned away from actually seeing it. Again, I'm not a fan of gruesome violence. But it did seem to show a shift away from QT's normal mode in an effort to appeal to a mainstream audience.

And, of course, there was the linear aspect of the film. The shifting back and forth through time that make his films so captivating was not to be found. Just a linear story that, again, started out strong and then devolved into ridiculous nonsense that was anticlimactic.

3954343,4,B002MZZMRM,"No one would call ""Inglourious Basterds"" a remake of the 1942 film ""To Be Or Not To Be"", but if you watch that movie no one can say it wasn't seen by Tarantino and clearly inspired by it&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Be-or-Not-to-Be-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B00CUKTHHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Be or Not to Be (Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>].

Both films met with somewhat poor reviews (and a degree of political-correctness driven  criticism) for treating Adolph Hitler as a comical character.  In 1942 this was because WWII was just beginning for the United States, and the whole concept of anything approaching a black comedy was a fairly new concept for moviegoers. Flash forward almost seventy years and it would seem the appetite for revisionist history is only modestly better, but considering the heavy involvement of Jewish directors/producers/actors in the movies I think few legitimate complaints can be levied here.  If you see the movie just for what it is, it consists of many excellent, excellent scenes strung throughout what would otherwise still be an above average movie.  There are easily four segments, beginning with the opening scene, that are of a type and quality so good that they could be used in a film school as quintessential examples.

Most complaints against Basterds can be put into the following categories: (1) Tarantinos ego, (2) Brad Pitts acting, (3) unexpected amounts of subtitles, (4) excessive violence, (5) some questionable musical choices, and (6) the film not being what people were expecting it to be.

I don't believe most of these are well founded, but even if they were they are easily counterbalanced by the amazing aforementioned four scenes, as well as many other solid casting decisions (especially exposing Christoph Waltz, Diane Kruger, and Melanie Laurent to larger audiences).

Could they have found a better suited actor than Pitt for this role?  Maybe.  But much of his character's stilted buffoonery was no doubt because he was supposed to be the tip of the hat equivalent to Jack Benny from ""To Be Or Not To Be"". That is itself an excellent film, and I'm glad that ""Basterds"" was partially inspired by it, but unlike that non-violent movie the amount of blood in ""Basterds"" made trying to also be a comedy in parts just too much to pull off.

You have to give Tarantino an ""A"" for effort by trying however, and he still ends up making some striking movie moments. Unless you're offended by lots of violence, everyone deserves to see this film at least once.",1388275200,3,2584,5.247572815533981

As an example of how poorly most of the characters were sketched, Brad Pitt's (Lt. Aldo Raine) Tennessee accent and demeanor were just insultingly bad.  I mean, if you're going to play the part of a tough, part Cherokee Tennessee mountain man, at least try to make us believe that the character you are playing is a tough, part Cherokee Tennessee mountain man.  Not just the caricatured ignorant, unsophisticated, violent imaginary that most of the world already thinks is a backwoods southerner.  Weirdly, the Nazis come off as having more character.  Maybe they could have played the Jews as similarly caricatured.

The lone bright spot was Christoph Waltz.  The classic antagonist.  In every sense of the word.  I mean, his character is like a shark:  cold-eyed, sociopathic, sadistic.  He could have been a stupid two-dimensional character too.  But he wasn't...",1387497600,7,996,5.234177215189874

I started watching again last year with his terrific slave movie. i decided to work backwards so next tried this.  it is just utterly fabulous.  it is about the Nazis at the end of WWII as the allies close in on them in france.  one unit with the name of the movie goes around killing any Nazis they can find and become very well known.  at the same time a young woman cinema owner plots to do away with all of the nazo high command at a movie premiere. everyone is great but let me single out christophe waltz as as SS commander who simulatenously tries to foil the allies as well as bargain with them.  he brings a wonderful humorous overlay to the whole movie. also, brad pitt is excellent with a texas drawl as an allied commander leading the Nazi murdering squad. all of his unit members are jewish. pitt is consistently underrated for his acting talent but i think he is one of the most versatile actors out there. as his looks become ever less important due to aging, perhaps others will finally notice his talent.  this is a must see film.  note:  this is a work of fiction. tarantino does do some things in his film which do not square with the history of that period.

Technically he's brilliant, but he's too in love with himself and his dialog to make something I enjoy.  Most of his movies seem too calculated, like he lives in his head and can't get past paying tribute to his influences.

But ""Inglorious Basterds"" is not a typical Tarantino movie.  Many of the bad reviews are because of this fact.  If you think he's a flawless genius, you probably won't like this movie.

But if you like great movies with depth and don't mind some flashes of the typical Tarantino movie, you will probably love this movie.  Even my wife, who hates Quentin with a passion, liked this movie.

The cast is great.  Everyone fills their roles nicely, and of course it's impossible to over-praise Christoph Waltz' performance in this.  The opening of the movie in the farm house is one of the most chilling, nerve-wracking one ever put on film, and it's all because he can play evil in the guise of gentility so perfectly it makes your skin crawl.  And when he does lose that control later in the movie, you can truly see the true animal within.

Things didn't work out too well for him and the whole scene turned into a disaster for many and the female celebrity actress later was exposed by the S.S. officer's ""detective"" work, linking her to the bar scenario.

if the only Tarantino movie you have seen is Reservoir Dogs and you didn't enjoy it, try another.  Inglourious Basterds would be a great candidate.

Christoph Waltz gives an Oscar worthy performance, and Brad Pitt takes his role of American ""Nazi Killer"" so over the top it's easy to believe there were soldiers during the war that would have fit right into his footsteps.  Tarantino much like the Coen brothers, tells his stories in romanticized hollywood fashion, but adds his particular 'it' factor to make them enjoyable for today's audiences.

Waltz is a ham, and the role calls for it.  He can switch from pleasant society talk to a murderous rage in blink, and there is one scene in which this is done masterfully.  Pitt is uneven.  His hollywood star wattage is never in question, but his acting is at times.  He doesn't quite ruin the film, but his attempt to play an Italian Officer did not work in the least.  Likewise, Diane Kreuger, who plays a German actress who is a spy for the allies, does a German accent that sounds like an American trying to speak in a French accent.  She is terrible.  The director is fantastic, and the film is edited and shot brilliantly.  And the fact that it offers an alternative ending to WWII was just terrific.",1378944000,2,855,4.4935064935064934

3954412,3,B002MZZMRM,"Historians have debated whether the Allies could have taken action in time to lessen the horrors of the Holocaust once they knew what was going on in the death camps.  Opinion is divided.  Tarantino jumps into the fray with a tall tale of a commando unit consisting of American Jewish soldiers (led by a non-Jewish officer) sent after the Normandy invasion to demoralize the German Army by killing captured German soldiers in gruesome ways -- I won't spoil it by saying how.  Think about this for a second.  (a) Would the U.S. military have approved such an operation realizing (as they must have) what the Germans would have done to captured American soldiers in retaliation? (b) The idea that the German Army would have thrown in the towel, or even been slowed down, just because Brad Pitt and his gang were running amok is silly, e.g., the surprise that came to be known as the Battle of the Bulge.  Now, if Brad had brought Angelina along as Lara Croft, who knows ...

Viewers who can suspend disbelief (there's more to suspend than I've indicated, lots more) and ""go with the flow"" will enjoy this movie.  It is visually inventive and the acting is terrific.  Waltz deserved his Oscar; the movie is worth watching just to see what a master actor can do.  You know what you're getting when you go to a Tarantino flick; he delivers trademarked thrills and things ""blow up good.""  Only three stars because I found myself going ""huh?"" too many times as the story switched gears and entered truly preposterous territory.

3954435,5,B002MZZMRM,"If you are into Quinton Tarantino movies this is the one for you. It starts out in a dramatic fashion with a German detective who visits a small town where a few Jews are being held captive underground. However, the owner of the house that they are in is resistant to admit that they are there because of fear of captivity. Finally he gives in and the German soldiers practically destroy the house and everyone in it except for one who gets away. You find out later on that she is handed down a theater from her aunt and that's really where the plot starts going. Brad Pitt and a few other lead actors are part of a rebellious military group that finds Nazis and decimates them. You're going to see a lot of gory stuff in this movie. It's a Quinton Tarantino flick. However, most of it is not fact based and has very little to do with the stuff that was going on during that time frame. It has great acting and that's really all you can say for it.",1373760000,,948,4.214285714285714
3954436,1,B002MZZMRM,"It seems the writer of this movie has almost no understanding of what constitutes good story-telling, and more importantly, good story structure.  This movie is literally all over the place.  It can't decide whether it wants to be about a Jewish girl or a squad of American commandos (and later a British commando).  And that's the problem, it's really two or three different movies all squashed together and the end result is a jumbled mess, so much so, that the film comes off almost schizophrenic.  There's no real narrative to the movie.  Or maybe too many narratives which makes it feel like there's no narrative.  Maybe if the story had stuck to just the Jewish girl's story (and somehow had her story/effort/plan actually tie into the German actress double-agent and commandos) it might have worked better.  But even at the end, the Jewish girl and commandos don't even know each other exist.  So we don't even care if the commandos succeed or fail in their mission because we know the Jewish girl is going to kill all the Nazis anyways.  The story is just really badly done.

Too much of the movie is illogical as well.  In the opening scene, Landa already knows the Jews are hiding under the floorboards, so what's the point of him going through the long conversation with the Farmer?  He learns nothing new, gets nothing out of it.  It makes no sense.  Plus the Germans are there to kill all the Jews, yet they let the Jewish girl just run away?  None of the German soldiers chase after her?  None of them try to shoot her?  Again, makes no sense.  And the British commando meeting the German actress double-agent in a basement bar full of German soldiers?  I mean, really?  Would commandos and spies really be that stupid?  And at the end Hitler is in the movie theater and there's no German guards in the lobby???  No Germans are guarding the theater that Hilter is in???  It's so implausible that it's insulting to the viewer.  I mean the writer of this movie should have at least attempted to make it a little bit plausible.

Also of particularly unfortunate note is Brad Pitt's performance as the commando team leader.  Pitt is usually a stellar actor, but in this movie he comes off like a hammy, over-the-top, cartoonish joke.  I mean his performance (and his character) are jaw-droppingly bad.  It has to be the worst performance of Pitt's career.

Overall, a huge disappointment.  I was shocked at what a huge mess this movie was.  See ""Where Eagles Dare"" for a truly great WWII commando movie.",1373673600,18,2513,4.668949771689498

Without revealing any storyline tidbits, I'll simply give a few more reasons why you should invest in this motion picture. Brad Pitt's character was by far my favorite (mainly due to his southern GI JOE style) character. Christoph Waltz's potrayal as the ""Jew Hunter"" Nazi also had me on the edge of my chair.

A lot of personal friends that have seen this movie say it is dull and boring because a portion of the movie is in German or French, but it is just to make the story more realistic.

I had heard that it was a great movie, but I just hadn't gotten around to seeing it. Oh, what a mistake that was! I was entertained during the whole movie, and all of the actors do a superb job. Christoph Waltz played a superb villain, and he did a stellar job at it. Brad Pitt was very funny and entertaining, and he did a great job as well. For those of you that don't know, Inglourious Basterds takes place mostly in Nazi-occupied France. A Jewish girl owns a cinema in Paris, which happens to be the site of a German movie premiere. She hatches a plan to take down the Third Reich, and so do a group of Jewish-American soldiers known as ""the Basterds"". It plays out very well, and the dialogue is wonderful in this movie., Most of it is spoken in either German or French, so subtitles are obviously a very important thing here.

3954480,5,B002MZZMRM,"""Inglourious Basterds"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: In German-occupied France, Shosanna Dreyfus witnesses the execution of her family at the hand of Nazi Colonel Hans Landa. Shosanna narrowly escapes and flees to Paris, where she forges a new identity as the owner and operator of a cinema. Elsewhere in Europe, Lieutenant Aldo Raine organizes a group of Jewish soldiers to engage in targeted acts of retribution. Known to their enemy as ""The Basterds,"" Raine's squad joins German actress and undercover agent Bridget Von Hammersmark on a mission to take down the leaders of The Third Reich. Fates converge under a cinema marquee, where Shosanna is poised to carry out a revenge plan of her own...

The cast led by Brad Pitt (excellent as Lieutenant Aldo Raine) & Christoph Waltz (in a breakout, possible Oscar-worthy performance as Colonel Hans Landa) is excellent! The directing and story and screenplay by Quentin Tarantino (who also wrote and directed ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992), ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994, which won him the Best Original Screenplay Oscar), ""Jackie Brown"" (1997), ""Kill Bill Volume 1 & 2"" (2003 & 2004), & ""Grindhouse: Death Proof"" (2007, which he also produced), he also executive produced and wrote the screenplay to ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" (1996) is excellent!

The cinematography by Robert Richardson (who also did the cinematography to ""Kill Bill Volume 1 & 2"", he also did the cinematography to the upcoming ""Shutter Island"" (2010) is excellent! The film editing by Sally Menke (who has done every one of Quentin Tarantino's films since ""Reservoir Dogs"") is excellent! The casting by Simone Br, Olivier Carbone, Jenny Jue & Johanna Ray (who also did the casting to ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" & ""Kill Bill Volume 1 & 2"") (both Jue & Ray did the casting to ""Repo: The Genetic Opera"" (2008) is excellent! The production design by David Wasco (who also did the production design to almost of all of Quentin Tarantino's films since ""Reservoir Dogs"", he also did the production design to ""Collateral"" (2004) & ""Redbelt"" (2008) is excellent! The art direction by Marco Bittner Rosser (who also did the art direction to the upcoming ""Ninja Assassin"" (2009), ""Hellboy"" (2004) & ""V For Vendetta"" (2006), Stephan O. Gessler (who also did the art direction to the upcoming ""Ninja Assassin""), Sebastian T. Krawinkel (supervising art director) (who also did the art direction to the upcoming ""Ninja Assassin"", ""V For Vendetta"", ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (2004) & ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" (2007), Andreas Olshausen (who also did the art direction to ""The Bourne Ultimatum""), David Scheunemann (who also did the art direction to the upcoming ""Ninja Assassin""), Steve Summersgill (who also the art direction to the upcoming ""Ninja Assassin"") & Bettina von den Steinen (who also did the art direction to ""The Bourne Identity"" (2002) is excellent! The set decoration by Sandy Reynolds-Wasco (who also did the set decoration to almost of all of Quentin Tarantino's films since ""Reservoir Dogs"", she also did the production design to ""Collateral"" (2004) & ""Redbelt"" (2008) is excellent! The costume design by Anna B. Sheppard (who also did the costume design to ""Schindler's List"" (1993) is excellent!

This is classic Quentin Jerome Tarantino.  In the end most of the people who are intrinsically evil as well as those who the audience roots for because of their goals to stop the evil doers die in large numbers.  This movie show the reality of war and it contravenes the usual Hollywood notion that good guys win, come away unscathed and live happily ever after with their chosen significant other.  As in Django Unchained, Tarantino uses outsized characters taking improbable actions in a maelstrom of violence to  make the demarcation between good and evil.

3954489,5,B002MZZMRM,"My rush to jugement on this film was indeed a profound mistake. So I have decided to re-write my review in my head. With that being said a Tarantino film often does need to grow on some of us. So here it is: This may very well be Tarantino's best film to date. The opening segment Which is a 20 minute conversation between a French Dairy farmer, La Petite and SS officer Hans Landa may very well be one of the greatest scenes in cinema's history. Both Actors were beyond brilliant and Christoph Waltz as Landa gives one of the greatest performances in film history. He was simply astonishing. Tarantino has created a film this time that is so gloriously gifted that it sometimes rises above the works of Kubrick and Welles. That first chapter between La Petite and Landa is simply beautiful in every detail. I could watch it a hundred times and never tire of it. The film is never predictable as is evident with the second chapter as the basterds are introduced. It's a very different style of film making juxtaposed to the previous chapter, but none the less totally brilliant. Then we see our first glimpse of Hitler and the film shifts to an almost comical/slapstick sort of mood, yet it seems to work and beautifully. Tarantino pays homage to everything from Spaghetti westerns to classic French and German art house cinema, and it's all simply brilliant! My first viewing was obviously not enough and I am very greatful I gave it another chance. Tarantino has proven again that he is truly a gifted director. And I am feeling pretty damned ashamed of my self for posting a mental review much too prematurely. I'm rooting for you Christoph! You've won 2 Oscars, you deserve it! What a great, great film!",1367971200,,1707,4.618421052631579

3954496,4,B002MZZMRM,"This is not a movie for those who like their war sagas based on historical fact. Inglourious Basterds is set during WWII, but does not reenact any specific event from that war. There are the usual suspects: Hitler, Churchill, Goebbels, etc. But the most potent character is a Tarantino creation, SS Colonel Hans Landa. Played by Christoph Waltz, Landa is an unsettling mix of charm, sophistication (he speaks four languages in the film), and cold-hearted killer. Waltz's performance is an utter tour de force, and won him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

In the opening scene, Landa comes to interview a French dairy farmer regarding the whereabouts of Jewish families in the area. One family remains unaccounted for.  As their conversation unfolds, it becomes chillingly evident that Landa will not rest until he ascertains the location of the family he is looking for. He slowly and carefully unnerves the farmer--masterfully alternating between charm and thinly veiled threat, until he obtains the information he needs.

As I stated, I.B. is a movie, a work of fiction. And it is a Tarantino movie. Meaning you can count on there being graphic violence, stunning dialogue, and unexpected plot twists. Landa's character figures prominently throughout, as does that of a young Jewish woman named Shoshanna Dreyfus. As for the film's title, The Basterds are an eight man group of guerrilla soldiers headed up by Lt. Aldo Raine, played by Brad Pitt. As Raine is part Apache, he tells his men that their strategy will be that of an Apache resistance. Use your imagination. Eventually Raine's and Landa's paths collide.

3954517,4,B002MZZMRM,"Quentin Tarantino is one of those people you either love or hate. It's his unique stories and methodical attention to detail that have always stood out to me. For all you haters out there, the one thing you can't deny is Tarantino's unique ability to bring out the best in everyone he works with, and that is why many times, the cast members of his films earn Oscar nominations. Inglourious Basterds is another uniquely strange story that just works, because of Tarantino. As has become his signature, the story is broken up into seemingly unrelated stories that all come together in a terrific ending. The story centers around a group of Jewish-American soldiers in World War II, whose assignment was to go into France, undercover, and track down and slaughter Nazis. It's a terrific cast led by Brad Pitt, but to me he wasn't so much the star of this film, that honor belongs to Christopher Waltz, who in his first major role, did win the Oscar for best supporting actor. It's a strong story and a great film, but something bothered me about it. Inglourious Basterds is of course a fictional story, so the attention to detail, such as having everyone speaking in their native languages, seemed someone unnecessary to me. That combined with subtitles that moved at the speed of light, made the story somewhat hard for me to follow. That's why I watched it a few times before reviewing it. There is no denying that this is one hell of a story with another tremendous cast, that deserved every award that it's won, however Tarantino's attention to detail, usually a strength, did take away from the film, as a whole, and did make some parts difficult to follow.",1364688000,,1660,4.707903780068729

3954537,3,B002MZZMRM,"I feel it is unnecessary to stress the absolute mastery of the set emanating from Tarantino's direction,especially where ""violence""is the ""issue on hand"".He has long ago established himself as one of the masters in this field. All in all a great movie. With a fantastic actor, a true pastmaster of the art of acting,Christopher Waltz,giving free acting lessons to anyone concerned.
But. Yes,there is a but  that,to me ,at least,raises significant concerns.
In the last few years we see,more frequently than ever before,historical or pseudo-historical movies emerging from Hollywood. Unfortunately with every passing year it seems that respect to historical fact evaporates more and more. It is ,however,one thing to observe movies completely misrepresenting what took place twenty, or even thirty,centuries ago(believe me,being Greek know very well what this means)and a completely different,as well as alarming,or even frightening thing,to watch a total twist of major historical events that took place only a few decades ago.
No matter how gullible one is,one cannot possibly believe that today's totally historically illiterate youth,will be aware that Adolf Hitler and his cronies were NOT killed in a movie theatre in Paris by a few ""heroic"" american commandos(or assassins),but continued to cause terrible bloodshed to the bitter end in Berlin,many months later. Please note that I refer  to the same youngsters who think that Joseph Goebbels probably was a great German football player or that Charles De Gaulle must be some reknown  French fashion designer.
When you teach youngsters,in any way,(be that the intennet,movies,TV series or fairy tale books)of a past that never existed,a lot of things can happen,none of which could be good. Inability to distinguish between historical fact and fiction is very dangerous,as well as a potential means to en end. A very nefarious end.
For,as the great George Orwell put it in his visionary novel""1984"" : """"He who controls the present,controls the past. And he who controls the past,controls the future"""".",1363305600,,2057,5.4420062695924765
3954538,5,B002MZZMRM,"Quentin Tarantino continues to be brilliant. Never more so than casting the incredible Christoph Waltz in the role of his career as the ""Jew Hunter"". The opening scene of the movie is as captivating as anything I can remember. For his efforts, Waltz earned his first Academy Award (Best Supporting Actor). Despite his brilliance, the movie was not completely carried by Waltz. Brad Pitt's performance as Lt. Aldo Raine (aka Aldo the Apache). His opening speech with a mountain accent is so classic that I cold watch it over and over (in fact, I have!!!! ""we're gonna be doin' one thing and one thing only... killin' Nazis."" (Nazi's is pronounced 'Gnat-sees').  Read some more. How can you not be captivated ""Nazi ain't got no humanity. They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hatin', mass murderin' maniac and they need to be dee-stroyed. That's why any and every every son of a bitch we find wearin' a Nazi uniform, they're gonna die. Now, I'm the direct descendant of the mountain man Jim Bridger. That means I got a little Injun in me. And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance. We will be cruel to the Germans, and through our cruelty they will know who we are. And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered, and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us. And the German won't not be able to help themselves but to imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels, and the edge of our knives. And the German will be sickened by us, and the German will talk about us, and the German will fear us. And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us they are tortured with.

3954545,5,B002MZZMRM,"Wow.
Here I was thinking that this was a quasi-fictional story about WWII and I'd end up being Impressed but Depressed. WRONG!
This showed a slice of the horror suffered by Europeans (Jews and non-Jews) by the very efficient German propaganda and fear machine (ever wonder why the people didn't just tell the Germans to go to hell or go back home? This is scary-explanative). The use of subtitles brought the different cultures into sharp focus, and they weren't distracting at all; I appreciated the clever use of French by the smarmy Nazi ""Jew Hunter,"" who managed to seem so reasonable in his terrifying, sickening ""mission.""
And Brad Pitt was a delight in his role as a soldier from Tennessee with Apache heritage, forming a team of Jewish-American guerilla fighters known to the Germans as the ""Basterds."" They keep the Nazis hopping mad with their ability to strike without warning and disappear like smoke, taking the ""souvenirs"" Pitt demands.
When a French Jewish survivor of her family's massacre catches the eye of a young Nazi ""hero"" whose starring role in a propaganda film puts her in a unique position for revenge, things get sticky.
The movie was emotional, insightful, and despite Quentin Tarantino's name on it, it wasn't filled with any more blood or guts than the story deserved. I was impressed.",1361836800,,1315,4.927927927927928

3954557,2,B002MZZMRM,"Two stars because the actors (except for Brad Pitt) did a magnificent job with a poor story and an unpassable script.  There are so many errors and weirdnesses both visually and plot-wise that make it difficult to do anything more than smear this whole film.  It was supposedly filmed in Germany and France for a pricetag of 70 million dollars -- yeah, right.  Who had the honeymoon?  Everything shown on screen could just as well have been an old MGM backlot -- there were scenes in Paris... okay... you could have fooled me.  No shots of the city, the Eiffel Tower, nothing.  Germany?  Aside from a room displaying a map of Fortress Europe and a prison cell that looked more like a zoo, we saw nothing of Germany or Berlin.  Granted, the cinematography with what WAS shown was expertly done, but... if I was filming a tale in Washington, D.C. or New York City, would I not want at least a few passing shots of buildings and such?  Or am I being too demanding?  So... cancel my suspension of disbelief.

Story starts supposedly on a dairy farm.  Okay... not a cow in sight, but plenty of milk to go around.  The farmer is chopping his axe on a stump presumably for splitting wood -- there was nothing on the stump.  And if he was trying to get rid of the stump, he wasn't chopping at it correctly.  The actor did a wonderful job -- don't get me wrong -- all of them did (except for Brad Pitt who phoned in his part) -- it's the DIRECTOR that should be slapped.  And to quote another reviewer, the scenes went on and on and on... and on.  And hiding a family under the floor of your one-room shack?  Really?  In the crawl space?  This late in the war?  The script grows grey hair as an SS officer takes his time to eventually comment on the cleverness of humans, then just shoots through the floor to kill them.  If this SS man was this vindictive, willing to spend 15 minutes interrogating a farmer, demonstrating his patience and desire to menace Jews and farmers in a languid fashion, why then the quick trigger?  Drag the Jews out and have more fun menacing them!  Not consistent character response.  And this late in the war, SS and Gestapo were not exactly patient.

As for Brad Pitt and his ridiculous accent -- a mangle of Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, and who knows what else -- myself a resident of the Great Smoky Mountains, let's just say ""we are not amused.""  And part Apache?  What?  Cherokee occupy these mountains!  Cherokee did the scalping as demanded by their French allies who wanted proof of all the kills.

The gore was overdone and unnecessary -- scalping was gruesome and almost silly.  Skin isn't going to come off like a piece of latex stuck to an actor's head... which is what it was... yeah.  In one long scene, we are subjected to an interrogation of a prisoner with a scalped victim in the background -- the bloody view does not change -- blood does trickle and change color.  So... too gory and inaccurate.  If you enjoy watching necks being sliced and bullets at point-blank range blasting men's crotches, and foreheads being gouged merrily, then this piece of garbage is for you.  I don't call this entertainment.

As for the script, it didn't seem to know what and where it was going -- one part is the cinema fire plot, the other is this ridiculous squad of murderous soldiers that do nothing to advance the first story.  And how would a twisted Southern accent survive sneaking around Fortress Europe populated with highly suspicious and paranoid Nazis?  Or break into a high-security prison?  Especially with a too-long, drawn out scene of a Gestapo officer interrogating and testing a German with a suspicious accent?  No, no, and no again!

One delight was seeing Rod Taylor as Churchill -- a nice surprise and, as is usual for Rod, excellent performance in a very brief appearance.

As for Hitler dressed in white tabard (cape), the actor did a wonderful job, but the scene was stupid.  Hitler, first off, wouldn't have given a damn about a squad of infiltrators 'terrorizing' his soldiers in France.  His focus was on the Eastern Front and the developing Western Front.  He would not have been dressed as such -- he dressed simply.  He would not have been alone in a conference room with just one other character.  He would not have gone to a film premiere in Paris with Allies already on the beaches of Normandy!  Not, not, not, not!  Totally wrong.

The cinema-owner's father was killed in the blitzkrieg?  Was he in England?  Paris did not suffer the blitzkrieg.  Invaded and occupied, yes!  Wrong, wrong, wrong!

Great acting, scenes too long, wildly distorted history, lousy script, unbelievable characters, no panoramic candy (Paris, Berlin, London -- if they were really there), and a lousy interpretation by Brad Pitt.  One star because there is no score of NO stars, and one star for the actors who, I say again, did a great job.

3954574,4,B002MZZMRM,"Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, ""Inglorious Basterds"" is a fictitious, visceral story of WW II in which a small group of American Jewish commandos led by Lieutenant Aldo Raine played by Brad Pitt turn the tables on Hitler and his Nazis. The movie is set in Paris during the German occupation. Besides Pitt, the major character is the Nazi ""Jew Hunter"" Hans Landa played by Austrian actor Christoph Waltz. Landa is suave, intelligent, shrewd, and deadly. Waltz does an extraordinary job of acting in portraying this difficult character.

The movie movies swiftly and held my attention throughout its 150 minutes. The movie is violent and crude with many scenes of beatings, cuttings, and killings. It captures the brutality of the war. In the movie, while not in fact, the Nazis get a deserved and swift comeuppance. It is a movie of vengeance.

I was engaged with this movie but found it valuable to step back and remember that it is a work of fiction. Some intelligent criticism has suggested that in this film that roles of the Nazis and the Jews has, if not been reversed, at least been somewhat equated. As in some other WW II movies, German top leadership is portrayed as consisting of buffoons. Tragically, WW II did not happen like this.

The movie was absorbing, dark, and wrenching but not especially probing. I did not find it nearly as effective or entertaining as Tarantino's more recent movie, ""Django Unchained"". Christoph Waltz is oustandining in both films.

I decided to give it a go on a recommendation from a friend and I was pleasantly surprised.  The movie is surprisingly emotional and yes it does have much humor to be enjoyed.  I was suprised (and happy) to see that Tarinino has range that I would never have guessed.  From the opening scene until the end I was riveted.  I do enjoy his other films very much, but I really enjoyed this one more I think because I didn't have many expectations going in.  The low of the movie to me was Brad Pitt's performance which I found to be somewhat stale and very unrealistic.  Overall I highly recommend this film.

3954610,5,B002MZZMRM,"In 1978 Enzo Castellano made a movie called Inglorious Bastards. In 1968 Sergio Leone made a paen to Westerns, called Once upon a Time in the West. In that same year, McLaglen made The Devil's Brigade. In 1960 John Wayne made The Alamo. These are a good enough start if you desire something approaching a full appreciation of Tarantino's sixth film, Inglorious Basterds.

Tarantino changes spellings as a veil: here he is using an ""e"". He uses Enzo as himself in a cameo. The opening score is nothing less than ""The Green Fields of Summer"", of John Wayne's own version of ""The Alamo"". It is used to great effect against the wide screen, black background and yellow block font. We are now framed for action.

The opening script announces two things: Firstly, we are only in a fairy tale, albeit one from the Brothers Grimm. ""Once upon a time""... it begins, as does many a tale. Secondly, this opening script moves quickly to the little house on the prairie where Leone did his homage to (at least twelve) American Westerns. We see a father and his children with a menacing intrusion in gray; rats in the milk again, but motorized. The Nazi Colonel allows one Jew to escape. She foreshadows, more like mirrors, the habit of the Tennessee Lieutenant who release a lone Nazi, granted life to broadcast and to amplify the infamy of the Apache Resistance.

We are not in a World War II movie, not yet. We are in the Western for the first two of the five chapters of classical dramatic form. The music is now that of Sergio Leone's faithful composer, Ennio Morricone. The stark guitar is his trademark spaghetti western of Clint Eastwood's journeyman years. What do we hear but the unmistakable quotations from Beethoven's Fur Elise in a second theme. Not bad at all.  But he does have Brad Pitt as Lieutenant. Aldo Raine, which is a more or less thinly veiled reference to Aldo Ray for his movies like Battle Cry.  My last memory of him is in one of the last of the John Wayne movies, The Green Berets. He is either Muldoon or McDaniel; they are hard to keep straight.  In another direction, Tarantino found that German actors, good as they are, had real trouble coping with his writing style.  It is unnatural and written for poetic effect in phrasing and cadence.  He found a fine Viennese actor, Christoph Waltz, to play Colonel Landa.

So Morricone and his ""Dopo La Condenna"", from the 1954 ""Battle of Algiers"", is the music for us to meet the Apache Resistance. The American Lieutenant sports a big red flint knap shoulder patch of the infamous Devil's Brigade. They were the First Special Service Force, formed from the superbly trained Canadian-American Commandos. This man is no slouch. Soon, you see the Bear Jew, Apache style, using his baseball bat as a war club to pound his enemy into bony jelly, as happened to Custer's savage crew. Boots are yanked off as a further indignity, true to history. Scalping is depicted in a relatively dainty fashion.

By Chapter three, we have left Tarantino's Western homage behind to focus on the movies of Europe in those days. First we see the marquee in Paris being stripped of Leni Riefenstahl. Leni was Hitler's darling and the only one Goebels could not get around. Later, we are treated to one of the best Hitler impersonations you will ever see. Then we see WB Pabst (the joke here is that Pabst was a German director who fled to Warner Brothers when Hitler popped up). And Pierre Fresnay film ""L'assassin Habile ... au 21"" about a serial killer, as Tarantino is never, ever heavy-handed in telegraphing where he is going. Mike Meyers cartoons for us the classic British wry senior officer in the map room briefing the cocky young pup as Churchill looks on.

Operation Kino unifies the Basterds with the little girl who escaped in the fairy tale climax. We are in yet another Tarantino time warp as Kino was founded in 1977, and had the good sense to make available to our scrappy writer/director many of the films that formed his cinematic sensibilities with the great catalogues of classic European film. From here on, we are in a new homage, this one to the great WWII films of the 1960's. Pulp Fiction stars Harvey Keitel appears as the disembodied voice on the phone at the end, while Samuel L. Jackson narrates. That is as far as I can take you. I leave you baited for a deliciously trademark Tarantino moment of absurdity: Hitler asks one of his guards for a stick of gum.",1357689600,6,4428,4.6424010217113665
3954611,1,B002MZZMRM,"I was totally blown away by how cartoonish this movie turned out to be. I had not seen it in the theatres and had thought it was ultra violent and revolved around these Jewish American soldiers killing Nazis. It is but it isn't. There's hardly any graphic violence which is fine by me but the plot is so stupid, it warrants an investigation into what Tarantino was thinking. I mean, the glorious Kill Bill this sure isn't.

Sure, it's shot well but the whole convoluted basing the story around a movie screening is beyond industry navel gazing. Then, to top it off, (SPOILER ALERT) the fact Hitler gets killed simply by getting shot seems to make the whole two convergent ""blow up the theatre"" plots redundant.

Honestly, the whole thing is a silly mess. Don't even get me started on the bierkeller scene which made no sense at all in the end or the beginning as to why they met there in the first place.

The performances are first-rate especially Christoph Waltz as the ""Jew Hunter"" Colonel Hans Landa, even if the opening scene between a French farmer and the German Nazi is done in English after the most laughable request in the movie (""I hear you speak English. My French is not so good. Let's speak in English."") given the rest of the movie is a mix of plausible French, German, English but also implausible Italian.

3954622,1,B002MZZMRM,"Lately I have been trying to more coherently form my thoughts on why I didn't care for ""Inglorious Basterds"". Now that I think about it some more, it was a matter of inconsistency of tone and pointless violence.

With ""Inglorious Basterds"", Tarentino didn't seem to know exactly what kind of movie he was making and he switched back and forth between styles with no rhyme or reason. I know people say that's his ""style"", but he has proven he can work within his ""style"" and still make a movie that works within its own universe if nowhere else. Here he jumped so randomly between Parisian/subtitled art house movie to exploitation flick to war drama with such quickness that the story lost all sense of flow and I was constantly being knocked out of the movie like a car crash. I have seen these three styles worked together before and to do it well you have to flow one into the other as a consequence of the story and not a jump cut that seem to exist only as a result of the director's inability to blend them together.

As far as the violence goes I really don't mind gory, even gratuitous violence, as long as it serves the story and doesn't merely exist as a gag. For instance the difference between the Hitler skull destruction scene near the end when compared to a similar death in ""Glory"". In ""Glory"" a commander's head popped like a ripe zit during a close up and splattered everyone around him in dripping bits of brain matter and hair. Over, done, quick and pointed. It made its impact and moved on. In ""Inglorious Basterds"" the violence is such a distinct entity in the exploitation sections of the movie that it felt like Tarentino was sitting around with some buddies saying, ""hey you know what'd be so super gross?!"" and then he built a movie around it. It never felt like it served a plot or a direction for the story. Even ""Hobo With A Shotgun"" seemed to have a reason for most of the gratuitous violence it showed and there was a consistent tone to the film. That movie was messed up beyond all reason, but the film makers kept us firmly rooted in a world that made sense, at least to itself and it obeyed its own rules.

If this had been a clips movie of short films and it were edited into distinct sections where one third was the straight narrative of the girl, one third was gory exploitation, and one third was the ending where they come together, all presented one right after the other instead of interspersed within one another I might have found a middle ground with the movie. As it was I just didn't enjoy it. Editing it differently may have provided us with a far better movie.",1357171200,8,2609,4.44258872651357

I'm the biggest Tarantino fan out there, and this film was complete garbage compared to his earlier work. I wouldn't have known it for a Tarantino film unless told otherwise beforehand. They say a writer should ""write what they know"" ~ and Tarantino obviously doesn't know anything about Nazis. Or WWII. Or France. He needed to stick to Compton. That, he knows. The sets in this movie looked like the back lot at Paramount circa 1950. The interiors looked like they used cast off set pieces from an off off off Broadway production of Disney's Snow White or a high school production of ""The Producers."" And the worst? A jarring and completely irrelevant cameo by Mike Myers, doing Mike Myers doing a cross between Austin Powers and Dr. Evil. Eli Roth chewed the scenery like it was canned ham and looked like he got lost on the way to an episode of Jersey Shore. Brad Pitt was BRAD PITT throughout the entire movie. A funny haircut and jutting jaw does not qualify as acting. I can see why Chrisoph Waltz won such acclaim for his portrayal of the SS officer ~ he was the only shining spot in a turd stew. Tarantino once seemed to care about getting the details right ~ now he just seems to care about ""getting this bit on film"" and forget about authenticity, like he thinks we won't care, because he's Tarantino and can do no wrong. Well, I'm here to tell you ~ the emperor has no clothes, people ~ and I'm not afraid to say it!",1356566400,15,1521,4.455197132616488

I still give it a 4 star rating because I took one star off because a few of the scenes I felt went on longer then they should have.  One main scene would have to be the bar scene when some of the characters were meeting up with the actress to discuss the distruction of the Germans. It ended up being one of his better films but I have to agree with other people about the movie being so long about 2 hours and 30 minutes total.  Though it being so long doesn't take away the fact I enjoy mutiple points in the movie, the accent of Brad Pitt in the movie, Mike Myers scene as a German officer and a few other scenes and one liners.  But if your a Tarantino fan and don't mind long movies then pick this movie up and see how much of it you end up enjoying and add it to your collection.",1355443200,,883,4.0285714285714285

Christoph Waltz and Michael Fassbender bring character to this movie that is just not available in many, more sane flicks. The posturings of the various characters make absurd conflicts possible which are unique to this film. The central protagonist (Colonel Aldo Rain) is a borderline idiot, and the good guys demonstrate that, in an armed conflict, division into good and bad is mostly conceit: there is really just bad and worse.

Inglourious Basterds is the best Tarrantino movie I have seen so far, being that it is both split into French and English. I love the characters and how Quentin developed them and the story.

Christoph Waltz earned his oscar, because his turn as the Jew Hunter goes right down there in the villainy hall of fame. Eli Roth also did a good job as The Bear Jew and Brad Pitt was great as Aldo the Apache and makes me long to earn my keep by getting my 100 ""Natzi"" Scalps.

Waltz ventures constantly toward 'over the top' that constantly had me wondering was he really THAT bad an actor, following bad direction, or what?  He's downright irritating every moment on film and his scene in the Paris cafe where  he is talking and eating  at the same time is classic irritation.  One, frankly, wants to knock his block off!

HOWEVER, I chanced to see him in an entirely different movie, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS, and damned if he wasn't just as irritating in that! His performances are transparent and shallow.

Funny, I didn't expect an action film from Tarantino. What you get is a masterful story with great characters(like all his films). Great acting and a two hour and thirty minute film with only a handful of scenes. All staples for a Tarantino films. The main difference is this film has an extremely satisfying conclusion. I've watched this movie about ten times and honesty can say that it gets much better after the second or third time. If you're a fan of Quentin than I can safety say that you should love it.

There are several maybe three or four scenes in this movie that are flawless and perfectly intense; specifically the scene where the SS man is interrogating a dairy farmer and the scene in the bar with the German actress/spy. The scene in the bar is really and truly one of the greatest scenes in film history. Historically, this should be the scene everyone thinks about when discussing Tarnatino's legacy. This is the best movie I've seen by Tarantino, FAR better than Pulp Fiction and the Kill Bill movies, which were damn good, better even than Jacki Brown.

3954687,3,B002MZZMRM,"Major newspaper reviews ranged from 2 1/2 to 5 stars, and that pretty much captures my own feeling about this film. I felt there was a pretty good, serious movie about occupied France, especially well done in the opening ""chapter"" that introduces us to Landa (Christoph Walsh). A great deal of the movie, however, was intentionally over the top and, of course, it vears off into an alternative history universe that, in my opinion, seemed tagged onto the story in a rather slapdash way. There are two styles woven together throughout: extravagant gore as in the Basterds scalpings of German dead, and cat and mouse conversations usually but not exclusively conducted by Landa. Whether the juxtoposition of these styles works is, I suppose, a matter of individual taste. It didn't for me. There can be no doubt that Tarentino had fun with this film, but one hopes that he will eventually outgrow his fascination with the minor film genres of the past.",1338595200,6,950,4.87037037037037

3954691,5,B002MZZMRM,"Upon first seeing Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds in the theatre a couple years ago, my initial reactions were mixed. While I certainly found it to be a very engaging film, with great mise-en-scene and that classic Tarantino dialogue, I was repulsed by it's content, it's lack of humanity, and the fact that so many people were reveling in it simply because it was Nazis being tortured and mutilated. And, being a student of history, I also wondered, ""what the hell was up with that ending?"" Thankfully, it was just that mixture of confusion and disgust that intrigued me enough to give it a second look. After all, I'm a die-hard Tarantino fan, and simply could not believe that such a brilliant director would make such a horrid exhalation of man's cruelty to man if there were not more to it; all his other films, violent as they may be, are centered on a warm, persevering humanity- a criminal caring for, and ultimately giving his life for, another; a mother seeking endlessly, albeit amid bloody revenge, to find her daughter. I am glad to say, after repeated viewing, I've finally figured it out. ""Inglourious"" is, in fact, a revenge tragedy, similar to Shakespeare's ""Titus Andronicus"" - coincidentally, another story that was, and is, reviled for it's grotesque inhumanity, so much so that many even today seek to exclude it from the Shakespeare canon. Yet the point of both stories are not the bloody acts of vengeance themselves, but the tragic consequences that arise when people forget their humanity and blindly pursue revenge. Perhaps, after ""Kill Bill"" QT felt it necessary to depict the awful realities of revenge; perhaps it is an effort to show a post 9-11 world that vengeance is vanity, and that bloodshed only leads to more bloodshed, as atrocities escalate and peace becomes ever more impossible. As Saladin said, ""Blood that is spilt never sleeps."" Whatever the case, the film succeeds by taking arguably the most justifiable revenge- that of Jews against Nazis- and making it utterly unpalatable, shocking and disturbing. By the end, as in Shakespeare's play, nearly everyone lies dead, proof of the bitter fruits of vengeance single-mindedly pursued at all costs. In between, we are given plenty of subtle flashes of humanity awakened and forgotten in the swing of a bat, stroke of a knife or what have you. In light of this, I would have to say that Inglourious Basterds is indeed a great film, and not the reprehensible heroic-bloodshed garbage I first took it for. In short, if you can enjoy a mindless revenge fantasy about atrocious cruelty, and your conscience doesn't bother you, you can probably still enjoy this film without giving yourself a headache; but if your looking for something deeper, and don't aren't averse to a little subtext, ""Inglourious"" will reward you.",1338249600,,2814,4.963983050847458
3954692,1,B002MZZMRM,Tarantino is a crude little boy indulging in sick little titillation films.  More deeply sad than this film is how many people actually enjoy watching this kind of thing.  It's just another form of horror 'porn'.,1338076800,8,212,4.861111111111111
3954693,5,B002MZZMRM,"It's not a 5 star movie in the classic sense, but I felt like this was one of the best movies I've seen in a while. (I don't watch many)

The performances stole the show, wow what a cast! All were great, Brad Pitt was never better. Diane Kruger role as Bridget von Hammersmark, had me wondering out loud, who is this wonderful actress? The tavern scene was dynamic moviemaking!

There is needless gore which I remember hearing about with QT's films, however it somehow all fits with the rogue element that the Inglorious Bastards unit represents. I mean what do you expect? It's war. Overall high recommendation!",1337990400,,612,4.657407407407407
3954694,3,B002MZZMRM,"For many years, Tarantino had this film partly written, but never could think of way to finish it, as well as finding time to fit it into his schedule of projects. There were rumors of Sly Stallone and Arnold playing characters, before production, but Quentin shot those down.

People were hoping ""Inglorious Basterds"" would be something on the scale of  ""Saving Private Ryan"", but sadly, that is not what this film is. In fact, this film is not historically, accurate. It follows a group of Jewish-American soldiers hunting Nazi's and ultimately, plotting a massive explosion in a cinema premiere, which has all the high-ranking German officers (including, Hitler). There is another story being told in the film of a young Jewish woman, who runs the cinema and plots her own revenge on the Nazis that killed her family.

There many great actors and performances in the film, all elevated by Tarantio's witty dialouge and skilled direction. Christopher Waltz is fantastic (and deserved that Oscar), as well as Brad Pitt and Diane Kruger. Unfortunately, like many of Tarantino's films, there is A LOT of dialogue scenes, with small graphic violence thrown, in between. Not just dialogue, but subtitles all over the place. Expect a lot of reading, which is a shame, because this is a beautiful film to look at.

There are some great moments in the film, especially, the intense opening scene, involving Christopher Waltz invading a farmhouse, as well as the bar shoot-out scene with Michael Fassbender.

But like I warned, this a dialogue-heavy film. If you've seen Tarantino's other films, don't expect the pacing of ""Kill Bill vol. 1"", but more of ""Kill Bill vol. 2"". The pacing of ""Basterds"" feels slow. It's not as tedius, as ""Death Proof"" or ""Jackie Brown"", but at times, it almost feels that way.

Tarantino has certainly, grown as a filmmaker, in the way he constructs and shoots scenes. The colors and the compositions he uses in his imagery have quite the impact.

I'm a big fan of ""Pulp Fiction"" and the Kill Bill films and enjoyed, ""Resevior Dogs"" and there's no question that Quentin can write and direct, however he should be careful to not be so engrossed with his ability to do so. His love and knowledge of film, as well as his dialogue skills, are kind of impeding on story-telling. Also, there is a lack of balance of dialogue\action, which hurts the pacing.

Yes, this is not the grand, WWII epic we thought Tarantino was going to make. What he did make, is still entertaining and worth watching, for the performances, alone.",1337990400,7,2542,4.854503464203233

3954696,5,B002MZZMRM,"""Inglourious Basterds"" is a fictional World War II film. To date it is Quentin Tarantino's highest-grossing movie.

The film narrative boldly shifts away from the norm of factually based WWII pictures and presents a story where the war could potentially end by aiming to assassinate the entire German High Command.

The story is multilayered and represents several points of views. The cast is loaded with personalities who are absorbing and Christoph Waltz's portrayal of SD Colonel Hans Landa is marvelous. On one hand Landa appears gentle and compassionate and on the other he is cold, ferocious and without a glimmer of mercy.

Some viewers might be unsettled by a few violent scenes but any true admirer of Tarantino's work will feel right at home.

Shot in France and Germany the cinematography is fantastic and it is a unique movie loaded with great scenes.

3954701,4,B002MZZMRM,"""Inglorious Basterds"" was director Tarantino's biggest hit since ""Pulp Fiction"" yet, judging from the reviews here, many weren't happy with what they saw. Blame it partly on the marketing, which presented this as a Brad Pitt movie (he's only in it about 25 minutes) and a dark comedy, a la M*A*S*H, which it wasn't (though it does have some humorous bits). I'm sure a lot of American moviegoers aren't used to subtitles, either. Still, for fans of the director - myself included - this was a remarkable, if flawed film. The three extended scenes are film-making of a very high order, and the remainder is never less than fascinating in that offbeat Tarantino way. I enjoyed the history rewrite, with Jews taking revenge on the Nazis in gory but deliciously vivid ways. But I also felt the director was pulling some punches, going for instant gratification instead of really probing the nature of good and evil that might have raised this to the level of a true classic. Still, watching Tarantino move with such ease into such a different genre is exciting. I think his best movies are to come, if he can restrain his impulse to always place style slightly ahead of substance.",1333584000,,1175,4.764705882352941

In Basterds he just puts swastikas on the sandbox. Take away the violence and sadism and all you have is a bunch of long-winded machine-like speeches which hold your attention only as a precursor to the violence Tarantino has conditioned you to expect, something like an 80's porno flick without the sex.

Aldo Raine (played by Brad Pitt) and his band of Jewish commandos.

There's much to praise about this film, the incredible cast, the impossibly beautiful (in a melancholy way) women principals, the imaginative fantasy of WWII history, the lush scenes, but for me the jewel of the film, and a recurring motif, is watching the exaggerated manners and niceties of SS officer Hans Landa as he interrogates while drinking milk, eating apple tarts with cream, and smoking a pipe. He is a master of effusive politeness coating a velvety veneer over what's really roiling underneath: diabolical violence, opportunism, and menace.

The reviewers who fault this film because it's unauthentic to history or because the military aspects are absurd are totally missing the point.  This film is a FANTASY!  It uses historical elements to weave, what for me at least, is an emotionally satisfying revenge story.  It's a ""what if"", or better, ""if only"" take on what some of us might imagine doing if we could have.

The editing is pretty tight for such a long film, and I didn't really notice the length at all when I watched it.

Christoph Waltz (Col. Landa) is a perfect villain.  As another reviewer said, it's hard to imagine this guy had a mother!

I enjoyed Brad Pitt's over-the-top portrayal of the Basterds' commander, Lt. Aldo Raine.  But it was a little much to hear his deeply Tennessee-accented Italian not cause an immediate reaction by Landa or just about every other German in the room!  I just couldn't maintain suspension of disbelief through that scene.

Only one other sequence really bothered me.  Shortly after killing the German movie star who was also an English spy, ostensibly because she was a traitor, Landa proposes becoming a traitor himself.  This just doesn't make emotional sense to me in any way.

The final scene, where Landa is ""branded"", serves as a nice fantasy antidote to all the real-life Nazis who tried to hide their former lives in foreign countries.

All in all, a very enjoyable film.  Not for pre-teens; this film is much too violent.",1324512000,3,1468,4.765873015873016
3954733,4,B002MZZMRM,"Subsequent to Tarantino's Kill Bill installments, I grew decidedly weary of his very familiar style that he had adopted and formatted to fit snugly into each and every project he may tackle.  Through elegantly crafted dialogue interplay and anxious cinematography and musical scores, the sharp flavor that is strictly Tarantino's own seems to have overstayed its welcome - for me, at least.

To declare that Tarantino needs to step out of his element is both irresponsible and unfair; does this oddball visionary really have an element to stray away from?  It's difficult to tell anymore.  But, if I were to encourage Tarantino to give himself a cinematic challenge and shoot for something more earthy and comfortable for his audience to digest, Inglourious Basterds isn't a bad start.

Smart, unconventional, and more restrained than Tarantino's previous films, Basterds a satisfying watch for anyone with a respect for superlative acting talent and thoughtful direction.  Pitt and Waltz, especially, are a joy to watch, each adding their own layers of harmless humor and charm to a movie that could have very easily taken itself too seriously.

Action takes a back seat to balanced dialogue exchange that is, thankfully, less digressive than what one would expect from Tarantino.  That said, the film's imagination is spread much too thin over a chubby 2 1/2 hour tale, and the anxiety leading up to an uneventful climax feels like a sucker punch.

Despite this, there's little to complain about throughout the majority of the film, and Tarantino takes enough risks to complement the admirably original absurdity of the subject matter.  Just don't expect to be seduced by white-knuckle action and tense confrontations.",1324166400,,1720,5.221818181818182

+Mlanie Laurent- Very talented young lady.  Does a superb job here.
+Christoph Waltz- Could anyone ever be a better villain?  I don't think so.  He does such a good job making us hate him.  Especially the first scene where he's talking with the farmer.
+Quentin Tarantino-  He does a fantastic job with the cinematography and I love how he breaks it down into ""acts.""

Downfalls
- Brad Pitt.  To me, this was a horrible choice.  I would have rather had a no name actor b/c I expected so much more from someone of his caliber.  He just fell so flat on his face here.
- BJ Novak.  Way too much face time for him in the movie.
- Alternate history ending.  I just don't get it.  I know this is a remake and maybe that's the way the other one ended, but it just didn't do anything for me.

Now, even though this movie had some detracting issues, it was still pretty strong.  I enjoyed this movie a lot.  Not one to watch again and again, but definitely very entertaining.",1323993600,,1009,4.264550264550264

Everyone knows about Christoph Waltz, but to me the real standout performance here is Melanie Laurent as the cinema proprietor, a real study in subtlety and total immersion in a role.  And of course Brad Pitt is a reliable crowd-pleaser as Aldo Raine (Fave moment: When Pitt, already in close-up, leans forward and says ""Ah WILL have mah SCALPS!""  Terrific)

3954737,5,B002MZZMRM,"Released in 2009 and directed by Quentin Tarantino, ""Inglourious Basterds"" was my first taste of the popular director's eccentric repertoire, although I've since seen 1994's ""Pulp Fiction,"" which I liked.

The first time I tried to watch ""Basterds"" I gave up around the 50-minute mark. Don't get me wrong, the long opening sequence was great but the film bogged down with its focus on a French theater during the German occupation of WWII and the accompanying interminable dialogue (in subtitles). I just wasn't ready for this. I was expecting a Dirty Dozen-styled WWII film with lots of action and all that goes with it. What I got instead was a plot that focused on the aforementioned theater accompanied by long sessions of mostly subtitled dialogue.

Well, I finally decided to give it a second chance with the understanding that this wasn't some typical war flick. Strangely, the ""interminable dialogue (with subtitles)"" pulled me in and I slowly became engrossed in the story, which isn't hard to follow. I discovered that the drama is only occasionally interrupted by flashes of extreme violence. Until the end, that is, where all hell literally breaks loose.

There ARE elements that bring to mind 1967's ""The Dirty Dozen,"" including a group of anti-heroes intent on mercilessly obliterating as many Germans as possible and the fact that the real action doesn't kick-in until the final act, but ""Basterds"" is hardly a Dirty Dozen clone. It may borrow a bit from notable films of the past but it absolutely possesses its own refreshing originality.

All effective films have quality characters and ""Basterds"" has several: The stunning Mlanie Laurent as Shosanna, the cinema proprietor, who drips with vengeance against the Nazis; Christoph Waltz as SS Col. Landa, an articulate and suave love-to-hate villain who mercilessly hunts down Jews; Brad Pitt as the almost-comical, but no-nonsense leader of the Basterds; super-sharp Diane Kruger as a German actress & British spy; and Daniel Brhl as a German hero with the hots for the beautiful Shosanna.

""Basterds"" pulsates with confidence, style, quirkiness and a sense of the unexpected from beginning to end, the perfect antidote to the ""blockbuster"" syndrome that plagues modern cinema with it's predictability and overKILL action & CGI, etc.

The film runs 153 minutes and was shot in France and Germany.

Quentin's suggested retributional methods for the handling of Germany's right-wing extremists might just give pause to some of today's, there and elsewhere.  That can only be a good thing.

No one can (sanely) deny Tarantino's considerable skills as a filmmaker.  Those skills are unquestionably on display here.

All of the actors turn in great performances, with Til Schweiger  not getting enough attention for his visual portrayal of what is perhaps the most intimidating German soldier in movie history.  Luckily for the Inglourious Basterds, he is one of them.

Anyway, if shallow masturbatory revenge fantasies are your bag, you'll love Inglourious Basterds.
Actually, there are scenes that work well in this film, but for every one that works there is another that is ridiculous. It can't seem to decide what to wants to be. It's one of those frustrating films that you can feel a good film trying to get out of but it fails.

Brad Pitt plays a one-dimensional American army Lt. from Tennessee that so hates the Nazis that he demands 100 Nazi scalps from those under his command. Never-mind the civil rights violations going on within his own country at the time this film is supposed to take place. One wonders if he demands 100 Klu Klux Klan scalps from anyone back there. Probably not. But since this film clearly happens in some alternate universe, America probably doesn't have racists in this world, rather it's most likely the white washed ""good ol days"" version of America that so many wish we could go back to. Unless they just happen to not be white.
Pitt's character is fond of carving swastikas into Nazi foreheads. This is supposed to be so that they can never take off their Nazi uniforms and blend back into society. It sounds somewhat brutally logical, but for the fact that today those who espouse Nazi ideals will gladly tattoo such symbols on their bodies. One wonders what the point is. Tarantino likes the idea of going back to the middle ages where criminals were branded with symbols of their crimes?

People seem to like this film though so I wonder if Quentin can make a series of films out of it. How about Native Americans that wipe out Andrew Jackson and his cronies and the rest of those land grabbing, genocidal European invaders. Or African-American slaves that wipe out Robert E. Lee and his gang of southern slave masters (who then may as well proceed to kill of most of the North as well). How about middle easterners storming the Vatican taking out the Pope and all his Crusader cronies. The Chinese invading Japan and paying them back for Nanking? Hmm, somehow I doubt any of that would play as well.

Apparently Tarantino does not subscribe to the notion that an eye for any eye makes the whole world blind. He seems to subscribe to the only way to fight monsters is to stare into the abyss and become one yourself. That's ok, cause its really cool to be a monster. The end doesn't justify the means, but the cool certainly does. Welcome to the world of Tarantino.

A good point: Christoph Waltz delivers a wonderfully chilling performance in this film. It begs for a good movie to be presented in.",1320019200,5,2791,4.585170340681363
3954742,1,B002MZZMRM,"Even the IDEA of the Nazis having a need for a ""Jew Hunter"" is egregiously facile, revisionist, and offensive; by the time they got the whole country implicated in what they were doing [along with multinational company I.G. Farben and, later, I.B.M.] -- with dissenters either exiled or facing being reported on by their (former) neighbors -- all those people had to do was FILE a MEMO, if that's what they wanted!

Ditto the idea of American soldiers attempting to ""scare"" a group of people in the grips of a mass psychosis; as Wilhelm Reich saw happen to his horror (and later delineated in his book, ""The Mass Psychology of Fascism""), people after people(s) just, y'know ... TURNED ... going ""bad"" like milk left out in the sun will go ""bad"" (and equally as irredeemable -- at least, in THAT life!).

By now it's come out that the ""ending"" Tarantino couldn't seem to come up with (as he related in a 2003 ""Playboy"" interview) has been filched from some so-called ""grindhouse"" movie (as though there ever were such a genre, as opposed to Romero/Argento on the one hand, and Corman/Samuel Arknoff on the other, and the crap in-between nobody noticed nor particularly remembered until a post-POST-modern ""niche"" emerged: celebrating crap!).

So ... that leaves us with WHAT, exactly, to recommend?  Or: to NOT cringe at, just to get to the ""action kicks""!)

Samuel Fuller took 35 YEARS to write/film the novel/movie ""The Big Red One,"" and he was TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OLD at the time he went; all in all, this ""penultimate event of the Twentieth Century"" (as Dan Simmons, rightly, called it in the ""Introduction"" to the recent reprint of his horror masterwork ""Carrion Comfort"") took a greater toll on folks than most could cop to at the time, or for some time after . . . isn't Tarantino pulling the same crap most gung-ho military types do nowadays, hoping for as ""enemy-able"" an enemy as the all-too-UN-understandable Nazis?

Well ... sorry, Q.T.!  Methinks you've ""over-clocked"" yourself, with this one!

3954744,4,B002MZZMRM,"This movie by Quentin Tarantino was very well done. It takes place in France during WWII. The story is about a fictitious group of American Soldiers whose mission is to infiltrate German lines in France.

For the average movie viewer this movie seemed boring because of all the subtitles. A majority of the movie was in French and German. Also there was not a lot of action or violence which made the movie slow for those wanting to see the usual Tarantino action. I really enjoyed the way the story moves along. He uses a sentimental story of a dairy farmer trying to hide Jews from the ""Jew Hunter."" This was a great scene that sets up how much the French hated the Germans and despised their culture. The story ends very epically with the stories of a hiding Jew who owns a theatre in France, the Jew Hunter, and the Inglorious Bastards.

I wouldn't recommend this movie for younger teens because of the language, a single, brief sex scene, and there was a few very disturbing violent scenes. Its not one of my favorite movies but I did enjoy and would buy it.",1316044800,,1063,4.474226804123711

Also, the long first chapter, entirely owned by Waltz who has clearly been brilliant all along, comes across very well first few times.  Everything else is highly dubious, that is 75% of the movie.  Tarantino enjoys in engaging dialogues and stories that connect various roles in the movie but here this all comes mostly disjointed with some absurdly stupid developments at the end of the movie.  Pitt is completely lost in his role because it is so hopelessly written, nothing to do with him.  Tarantino's propensity for violence is worrying on a medical level, nothing to do with art, some of the scenes are not far from products of a troubled mind.

3954747,3,B002MZZMRM,"Trying to capture just why this film disappoints is a truly elusive affair.  Did I have unfair expectations?  Were those expectations set purely by pre-knowledge of the director's previous works?  Was it the fault of the marketing campaign?

Who knows... but the bottom line is, this movie was not what I expected, and I can't say the surprise was a pleasant one.

I will start with this - there wasn't a single scene in this movie that was poorly acted, written, or directed.  The film was brimming with sheer talent on both sides of the camera.  And the final 40 minutes were definitely chock-full of excitement.  The problem, though, is that no matter how well made the parts are, if the final conglomeration falls flat, you still have a disappointing film in the end.

The problem with this movie is simple ... PACE!  I'm coming to believe there are essentially two Tarentinos - the one who engages the audience from start to finish with the sheer energy of what's happening on-screen ... the Tarentino of PULP FICTION, RESERVOIR DOGS, and KILL BILL.  And then there is the Tarentino who loves to hear his characters spout his words, who loves to show how long his actors can sustain a single scene, who loves to draw things out as long as possible - the Tarentino of JACKIE BROWN, DEATHPROOF, and now INGLORIOUS BASTERDS.

The issue is evident in the film's opening scene.  Christopher Walsh, who thoroughly earned his Oscar, is the cold and exacting ""Jew Hunter"" of a Nazi who pays a call to a French farm to uncover the Jews he knows are being hidden there.  This sequence begins very intensely - Walsh plays his part almost pleasantly - we wait for that horrible moment when it will go from pleasant to tragic at the drop of a hat.  And then we wait some more ... and keep waiting ... and finally, after 20 full minutes, that hat finally drops.

And the rest of the film follows in this manner.  Tarentino sets up a concept, a plot point, a direction ... and then puts us in front of another soliloquy, or scene-study, or whatever you want to call it that allows his fine actors to rattle on and on and on, while the viewer is increasingly losing interest in the thin set-up.

The sole survivor of the opening scene is led to a point where she will be able to exact full bloody revenge, and once again we are fully engaged.  And then she disappears for nearly 40 minutes so a different set of cast members can play a drunken bar-room game involving guessing which famous person is written on a card stuck to their foreheads!

It isn't until the final 40 minutes that the pace picks up as the film marches towards its bombastic finale (complete with a historical inaccuracy so outrageous, one can picture Tarentino standing just behind the screen flipping the audience a double-bird).  It's as if Tarentino hopes the final act is so over the top with mayhem and delight, that one cannot help but believe they actually sat through an entire film that was so exciting.  But we remember ... we remember how many times we checked our watches to see if we were even CLOSE to the midway point.  We remember shouting at the screen ""surely these guys aren't going to stop and play a drunken bar game!""

And we remember wondering just where in the world the titular Basterds are during the bulk of the film.  For indeed, this movie isn't really about Brad Pitt and his band of merry masochists.  Oh, they figure into it, but only tangentially.  The film is really about seeing how many drawn out acting sequences an audience can endure.  Again, they are all done VERY well - but when put end-to-end...it's just TOO much.  And that's where I come back to the title of my review.  Just as someone needs to tell Lucas ""enough with the revisions of your one movie!""  Just as someone needs to pull M. Night aside and tell him ""you can't keep remaking the 'twist' ending movie!""  Someone needs to tell Tarentino - ""dude, we know you're a good writer ... stop over-indulging yourself!""

With a promising set-up, expert cast, quality writing, and of course the frenetic director, this really should have been a much better film.  As it is, there are many parts worth watching ... just don't expect the riveting pace of Tarentino's better works.

He is an absolute genious and a landmark in filmaking..But he was at his best in the 90's with Reservoir Dogs,True Romance(writer),and my favorite of the 3 Jackie Brown..Then he went off the map for almost 6 years and then Kill Bill hit the scene,although a great movie it was very different from his other films then the sequel followed and it was a kind of a miss. Kill Bill was really stacked with action,blood,and some cool anime sequences but it had nothing on his 90's takeover. Kill Bill vol 2 was kind of slow and just not as good as the first and complete crap compared to his early stuff..Then there was Death Proof which was an hour and a half long guilty pleasure of a movie.

3954752,5,B002MZZMRM,"This movie may not be Tarantino's most artful, star-studded, or controversial film. But I found it to be perhaps his most watchable. The great irony is that the film is full of long dialogue scenes that shy away from Tarantino's usual hipster vernacular, but nonetheless remain laced with wit, polish, and the sheer joy of verbal communication. It does not seem possible that so many extended scenes could exist in one movie, yet each one seems to be the very height of tension. It seems someone always has something at stake: hidden identities, hidden agendas, hidden Jew dairy farmers. The film takes its time, stretching the characters' nerves to the breaking point before finally moving on to the next episode. It's an entrancing bit of work.

As usual, Tarantino has a knack for casting. Chrisoph Waltz as an evil Nazi brings a breathtaking sense of joy to his work. This is no one dimensional villain, and his Oscar is every bit deserved. Brad Pitt, as leader of the Basterds, has the most outrageous Tennessee accent ever heard in a WWII movie, and manages to be hilarious every time he steps on stage. The cast is uniformly awesome all down the line.

This is one of those movies I've watched again and again on Blu-Ray, because I find the sheer effortlessness of it to be fascinating.

Don't fall for that bit of misdirection in which the film is promoted as a Brad Pitt starrer. Brad Pitt isn't the lead as much as a key cog in a rather remarkable ensemble cast. Yes, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is partly about a gritty commando unit called the ""Basterds,"" comprised of Jewish-American soldiers and led by Pitt's Lt. Aldo Raine. On the surface, one questions whether the square-jawed American government would actually deploy such a mean and nasty terror team behind enemy lines to inflict brutal just desserts on them swastika-bearers, but we're all worldly folks here. Pitt plays his character as an unabashed caricature, and, in a weird way, he provides the brunt of the film's comedy. I say ""in a weird way"" because Lt. Aldo Raine happens to be a no-nonsense Southern-drawled gent who never backs down from his unsavory mission, nor does he shy away from inflicting torture on the Nazis. But he's got a way about him. There's an irrepressible glint in his eye when he remarks: ""We're in the Nazi killing business ... and let me tell you cousin, business is a-booming."" Brad Pitt is having fun spreading inhumane terror.

But it's not all about the Basterds and their ruination of the German soldiers' beauty sleep. The Basterds get more screen time than the Howling Commandos in CAPTAIN AMERICA, but it's not by much. Tarantino has always had this knack of picking out actors who end up being perfect for their roles. And sometimes it means going out and finding a French actress to play a French character or a German actor (or, in this case, Austrian) to play the Nazi big bad. Christoph Waltz could not better be as Colonel Hans Landa, the slimy but fiendishly clever ""Jew Hunter."" Waltz turns in one of the year's most memorable performances, and it's even more impressive once you realize that he does this while speaking in three - almost four - languages. There's a sustained element of danger about him. Waltz imbues Landa with such serpentine intellect. The Colonel seems even more deadly when he's engaging in small talk with the other characters. You're rendered all nervous, wondering just what he's figured out and when he'll spring his trap on them unsuspecting targets.

Most of the film takes place in Nazi-occupied France. The film is segmented into chapters, several of which feature the hard-bitten young Jewess Shoshanna Dreyfus who three years ago was Emanuelle Mimuex, a fugitive who witnessed the slaughter of her family. Nowadays Shoshanna is minding her business which happens to be running her own movie theater. But when her cinema becomes the site of a propaganda German film - an event to which the most highly ranked German officers are invited (even a certain failed artist) - Shoshanna sees a chance for get-back. I'd never seen French actress Mlanie Laurent in anything before, so I don't know if she's this routinely captivating. But her arc is the most heartbreaking. One of my favorite bits in the movie features Laurent in a showstopping sequence serenaded by David Bowie's ""Cat People (Putting out Fire)."" Others may say the inclusion of a Bowie song is jarring. I say it's friggin' brilliant.

All the plot threads converge at Shoshanna's modest little theater, but not before Tarantino gets to play a little bit. He peppers his picture with compelling vignettes, treats us to colorful side characters. Michael Fassbender is very good as a British officer who goes undercover in France. Fassbender exhibits a cool steeliness which may have in part won him the part of Magneto in X-MEN: FIRST CLASS. Diane Kruger gets maybe her meatiest role as German actress and double agent Bridget von Hammersmark. Til Schweiger and Eli Roth make their mark as, respectively, the Basterds' sadistic German recruit, Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz, and the baseball bat wielding Sgt. Donny Donowitz a.k.a. ""the Bear Jew."" For trivia buffs, Eli Roth directed HOSTEL and also the film within this film, NATION`S PRIDE, the German film which has its special screening at Shoshanna's theater. You can see this short film in its entirety in the DVD's bonus features.

Tarantino's trademark cinematic flourishes are still present, although they may be a trifle subdued. His flair for dialogue isn't as in your face, mostly because sub-titles grace huge chunks of the film. But there's still a sense of suspense and the unexpected in the conversations. Anytime that Christoph Waltz chats up a potential suspect, or that tension-fraught sequence in the bar downstairs, the dialogue plays out like a high stakes chess match. I will say that I think this is the most disciplined that I've seen Tarantino in a while. Or maybe DEATH PROOF and its talky excesses lingers that strongly in the brain. That's not to say that INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS isn't talky, because it is. But Tarantino stays on point with the words. The script stays relevant to the plot. And while the action isn't at all as constant as that in KILL BILL, the violence when it arrives is chilling stuff. Lt. Aldo Raine's mandate is one hundred Nazi scalps from each of his men. They gleefully set about filling their quota. And if you're looking for a virtuous protagonist to pin your allegiance to, well, keep looking, brother. Tarantino delivers a strange, pulpy, morally-askewed war drama. INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS may come off like an arthouse film, but it's not for sissies.",1313280000,3,5557,4.946466809421842

3954761,5,B002MZZMRM,"I don't think this can be properly appreciated without knowing how it ends. Personally, I left the theater disappointed after my first viewing - like I'd been the butt of an enormous joke, with QuentinTarantino taking full advantage of the kind of notoriety and clout he'd accumulated over the years to cash in on an intentional stink bomb. Now, a few years removed from the experience, I've given it another shot and left with an entirely different look on my face. It's a magnificent film, dedicated to building up one impossible situation after the next; two full hours dedicated to stacking the dynamite. The implication, of course, is that he'll find a way to write himself out of it - and I suppose he does, just not in a way that anyone could have expected. It's an impervious blend of Tarantino's notoriously sharp-witted dialog, his ADD-influenced lack of focus on any particular storyline for more than twenty minutes, and a deep yearning to lead his audience into a false sense of security before dumping cold water over their heads. Brad Pitt has the time of his life as the braggish, stereotypical war movie lead with an awful accent, but Christoph Waltz steals the show as a giddy turncoat Nazi sleuth. Basterds is a stroke of brilliance, weaving three distinctly different movies into one spectacular cinematic quilt. Where my initial impressions of the ""did they just do that"" climax were of shock and disdain, time and honest thought have transformed it into one of my favorite scenes. Ballsy, bright and bombastic, it deserves a spot alongside the director's classics.",1309737600,,1586,4.9216417910447765
3954762,5,B002MZZMRM,"Inglourious Basterds is a cinematic masterpiece, as well as an expectation defying, genre shredding, throwback of a beast of a film that revels in not giving two shakes of a bloody bat what you think.  That's precisely what's so invigorating and thrilling about the experience of watching it.  Like many of Tarantino's films, one ends up feeling more of a participant as opposed to merely a spectator.  Things open quietly and horrifically with one of the most understated and thoroughly evil opening flourishes ever attempted to set up a ride as wild as this... and it works almost too well.  Christoph Waltz is an actor I was totally unfamiliar with before viewing this film.  By the end of the first scene I wanted to jump through the screen and wring his smarmy neck.  His performance only grows stronger through the entire production.  While some may balk at the leisurely pace taken, it not only serves to ratchet up tension for the first act, but really sets up this character for the events in the third act nicely.

Waltz is the jewel of this production.  However the ensemble cast around him with Brad Pitt leading the way is not only excellent but littered with Tarantino staples, i.e. a retired actor making a triumphant return, stunt casting extraordinaire and gorgeous women who wouldn't know a second fiddle if it bit them on their torpedo brassieres.  Pitt especially, is brutally effective in an unrestrained performance that works great as a foil for the cool, collected sinister moves of Waltz's character.

Besides the great acting though, what really makes Basterds shine are the ideas embodied and the indeed glorious set pieces that provide perfect stages for Tarantino's tense, interlocking morality yarns.  The highlight for me was not the much ballyhooed ending, but rather the tavern scene.  To me this scene is not just the greatest in this film but one of the greatest in film, in quite a while.  Tarantino's love of movie history really shows here, but also his mastery of dialogue, invective, foreshadowing, wordplay and ability to always SHOW rather than TELL, even while a complex conversation is in the offing.  It is a thrilling scene to watch and is a nutshell version of why the whole movie works, despite its own (at times) maniacal fearlessness.  Without the tavern scene, I can't imagine Basterds being as cohesive or affecting overall.

In the same way the deliberate pacing of the opening scene could put some off, I can see how the occasional insistence on tapping the brakes could frustrate fans of more traditional fare, as well.  As noted there are not a lot of concessions made to the viewer, but this to me comes off more as respect than lack of fan service.  You will never feel spoon fed while watching Inglourious Basterds but you might at times feel like you want to stop and digest a bit.  To paraphrase, you can digest when you're dead.  Tarantino always has a fresh spoonful of creme ready for your strudel, no matter how you take it.  With a film like this you might need a little extra willing suspension of disbelief but if you do give yourself over to it, the ride can be unforgettable.

The DVD itself has a lot of great special features that fans of the film will enjoy.  I would have loved a commentary, but the roundtable discussion fills in some of that information.  Being able to see the film within a film was a nice touch too.

Lastly, it seems that some people take exception with the barbarous acts of unremitting violence perpetrated against fictional Nazis herein.  I would just like to say that you're being quite silly.  Are you afraid that anti Nazi violence in the world will spiral out of control?  It would be laughable if it, well... weren't.  The only entity in the world that engenders rage towards fascism of all flavors, is fascism itself.  Fictional representations of revenge are many times the closest victims can get to exacting the payback they have in their hearts.  If you feel that the violence portrayed here against the SS rank and file is ""over the top"" then check again.  Dachau was ""over the top.""  Himmler was a REAL freak off the leash so cry me a Rhine.  The swastika has a target on it forever now and that's just as it should be.  It's called payback is a b*tch.  Ask Tojo if Pearl Harbor was worth it.  Now ask Michael Bay.  See where I'm going here?  Sure you do.  Sit back and enjoy the show people.  It's what you do best.",1309651200,3,4427,4.681347150259067

3954765,2,B002MZZMRM,"Quentin Tarentino could have been a great success as a magician or a con artist. For months he even convinced me that this was a good movie, instead of the strange experiment in recreating the things that make a bad movie a bad movie. It feels like Christoph Waltz, Dianne Kruger and Melanie Laurent(all the serious Euro-actors)set out to do a serious WWII movie. While they were doing that; QT and all his Hollywood buddies got together on another part of the set and decided to make a travesty worthy of Ed Wood! I mean, a WASPy Brad Pitt spying in occupied Europe might be believable(within the script's loose interpretation of reality, that is)but the fact that he sounds like FogHorn LegHorn even when he attempts to speak even one non-English word is ridiculous!!(GRASSY-ASS!! BON-JOR-NEEW!!) QT conned us all with his trailers promising a non-stop, orgy of Nazi-killing! Almost every single action scene can be seen in the trailer. Except, strangely enough, for the clip of the guy in the Bowler hat firing an MG42 on the run down a corridor! I can't even find that clip on any of the extended scenes promised on the covers of DVD packages! The deleted and extended scenes are just more TALKING!! I remember Jamie Bell was on a talk show with one of the stars of this movie. He made a negative comment about his own WWII movie, DEFIANCE, and praised Inglourious Basterds for its action. Obviously, he was kissing ass and hadn't seen the movie!!! Even the violence is a disappointment! All of the characters who had a memorable personality in the Basterds get killed in a shootout with a Gestapo Agent and a band of drunken Germans and an overgrown Girl Scout! The rest, except for Brad Pitt, Eli Roth and two guys who I can't even tell apart from each other, just disappear. Eli Roth, as the Bear Jew(seriously, couldn't the supposedly brilliant QT come up with a better Nickname; Das Golem, Samson, maybe)makes you wonder how he could be Jewish as he is such a HAM!! All he manages to do is convince the audience that he probably does act out his Hostel scenes on his own time(probably on homeless men and unsuspecting co-eds). There have been a ton of bad WWII movies made recently. You can rent most of them for #2.99+tax. QT, managed to con everybody into shilling out $9.00 and more for his bad movie when it was in theaters. Now he wants $29.99 and more for bogus Special Editions!

3954769,5,B002MZZMRM,"Quentin Tarantino's creates an artistic master work on a common canvas with ""Inglorious Basterds.""
The plot is pure fantasy, written in two World War II sub-genres.  Like many of Tarantino's works, the film is one seemingly unrelated episode after another in the first half, and you're not surprised when the diverse plotlines finally converge in a blood-spattered finale.  So, if blood spattering is not you're thing you'll want to steer clear.  I personally can't stand films featuring violence for the sake of violence, but Tarantino always takes time to introduce character motivations so that you know why they kill, maim, etc.  I watched this film back to back with the French wolf movie ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"" and that stylish film became quite dull as characters killed and maimed for no apparent reason.  Tarantino, acknowledged as a master of dialogue, displays a deft and layered wit in his plot as well.  In many ways I was reminded of his circular masterpiece ""Pulp Fiction"" with its cast of over-the-top characters weaving in and out of each other's lives.

Also like ""Pulp Fiction"", Basterds is told in Chapters (complete with screen markers and Chapter Titles).  In the opening Chapter Pierre LaPadite, a farmer in Nazi-Occupied France, is chopping wood when his daughters spy a caravan of Nazi vehicles headed toward them.  Monsieur LaPadite orders his daughters into the house as Col Hans Landa approaches.  Tarantino expertly builds tension: Col Landa (played by Christoph Waltz in an Oscar-winning role) is famed as ""The Jew Hunter"" and after LaPadite invites the Colonel inside the audience is shown that the Dreyfus family is hiding under the floorboards.

In the second chapter we meet Brad Pitt as Lt Aldo Raine - a backwoods officer from Tennessee who has orders to assemble a crack team of Jewish soldiers eager to drop behind enemy lines and scalp Nazis.  This team form the title characters.

Daniel Bruhl plays Pvt Fredrick Zoller - the ""German Sgt York"" who earned glory killing scores of enemies of the Reich from a bell-tower.  Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels has made ""Pride of Nation"" based on Zoller's heroic exploits, and the film careens toward a climax at the Paris premiere of ""Pride of Nation"", with Hitler, Goebbels and the rest of Germany's high council.  Pitt and the rest of his team have plans to interfere with that premiere, held at a cinema owned by Melanie Laurent, a French Jew who survived the murder of her family by Landa's soldiers four years earlier.

This film oozes with QT's cinematic virtuosity.  He finds ways to quote not only American film-making icons like David O. Selznick, but also famed German film propagandists Riefenstahl and G.W. Pabst.  Tarantino veterans Samuel Jackson and Harvey Keitel appear only as voices: Jackson as narrator and Keitel as an American General speaking on the radio in a key late scene.  QT's beloved ""Mexican Standoff"" appears again in a set piece scene that begins in a French basement bar with drunken celebrating German soldiers playing a ""who am I?"" guessing game with famed German actress Bridget von Hammersmark (played by Diane Kruger), who is acting as a double-spy who hopes to spirit the ""Basterds"" into the premiere of ""Pride of Nation."" Tarantino continues his foot fetish and affinity for nicknames: ""The Jew Hunter"", ""Aldo the Apache.""  ""The Jew Bear"", one of Pitt's squad, is played by ""Hostel"" director Eli Roth: his Donny Donowitz is feared as a Golem from Hitler to the lowliest footsoldier - although the team is known for literally scalping their victims, the Bear is known for beating their skulls with a baseball bat. (Hey, I didn't say it was pretty...)  Til Schweiger, Germany's biggest movie star, takes a supporting role here as Sgt Hugo Stiglitz, a ferocious German soldier who joins Pitt's team after rescue from a military prison.

It perhaps seems that I have given much away - but the joy of this film is seeing how the pieces fit together.  Tarantino makes certain that the pieces fit in a bloody, entertaining way.",1306368000,2,4054,4.973333333333334
3954770,2,B002MZZMRM,"I'll try to be brief . . . that's all this 2 1/2 hour piece deserves.

Wonderful opening scene of a high suspense dialogue between Nazi SS officer (""Jew Hunter""), and rustic farmer (harboring Jews) at his primitive kitchen table.  Masterful suspense.

I'm not sure what happened after that.  The film degenerated into 150 minutes of tripe:  Improbable characters, gratuitous violence ad nauseum, repetitious improbable situations (""I've got a gun on you, but you've got a gun on me, but my partner has a gun on you"").  Was this written/directed by a 12 year old?

The storyline is self-indulgent Hollywood garbage which rewrites the culmination of the WWII war in Europe such that it takes place at the screening of a major new Nazi film at a Paris theater.  No kidding.  Yes, of course!  Opening night! Film-making and it's deserved central role in the play out of major world politics!  What crap.

I'll admit, at close it did make me sit and think/question for a few minutes.  Had I just watched a comedy? (I don't think so).  Why did director Quentin Tarantino do this to himself? (over-confident?) Will lead actor Brad Pitt ever be able to show his face in public again? (was this a desparate rehabilitation effort?).

I'm not going to explore the complex element of the infamous persecution of Jews by Nazi Germany.  The story must be told and re-told, but much money has been made from The Holocaust.  I'm not sure when that line gets crossed (here?).

I'll give credit for the production sets (above average) and most of the acting (not Brad Pitt). But Inglourious Basterds is high budget garbage.",1303862400,6,1605,4.795620437956204
3954771,3,B002MZZMRM,"At least, one thing you can say in favor of Inglourious Basterds is that it forces you to think, if you don't want to limit yourself to a merely instinctive judgment. The instinctive judgment would be that this movie is, overall, so profoundly silly and immature as to defy understanding and leave you with your head shaking in disbelief, something like a comic book from the sixties or seventies, aiming at a 10 to 14 mental-age comic book audience (and reading the reviews, there's a crowd of that out there), over-inflated to the size of a multi-million, over two-hour motion picture.

Silly and immature? Let's start with the big things. It all goes awry at the beginning of ""Chapter 2"", when Hitler appears portrayed as an eructating caricature - it reminded me of Terry Gilliam's Napoleon in ""Time Bandits"". And from that point you know that this is not going to be serious; even Chaplin's Dictator seemed like a stern documentary in comparison. Other glaring absurdities? A ""Wild Bunch"" of Jewish avengers wreaking terror behind enemy lines, and getting away with not even the trace of a scratch (at least before they team with a blundering Brit secret services agent). Tarantino's ""Dirty Dozen"" are even less than cardboard figures, you can hardly remember their names - and I'm not asking for psychological development, let's not place too high demands on Tarantino, just a little bit of description past a few grunts; even Schwarzenegger's bunch in Predator had more reality. A Jewish girl whom the Nazi Jew hunter lets escape from her family's massacre, then finding herself three or four years later (with fake identity papers, naturally, those came automatically with ration tickets in occupied France) the owner of a movie theatre in the center of Paris - with a black assistant and lover to boot. Hitler coming down to Paris - this is June 1944, after D-Day - just to watch a Goebbels propaganda movie (and was Goebbels ever a film director anyway? Not that I know of: as propaganda minister, he was a producer of films, but Tarantino lets the ambiguity hover). A German actress, double agent working for the allies, who knows about Hitler's coming to Paris, supposedly a top-secret information that only two other Nazi dignitaries including Goebbels seem to share. A Gestapo officer appropriately (and by sheer coincidence no doubt) present in a remote village tavern some miles away from Paris where no-one except British and American spies are supposed to be, clever enough to realize that the three German officers surrounding him are British and American spies in disguise (that's the afore-mentioned blundering Brit's blunder), but stupid enough to pull out his pistol and point it at the blundering Brit (what did he think the two others were going to do? just stare and keep sifting their whiskey?) instead of quietly leaving the premises as if he'd been aware of nothing, and then calling a squad to come an arrest or shoot down the lot. He should have asked me about spying techniques, I've watched enough movies to know these things. The German actress/double agent getting a bullet in her leg that you wonder how it didn't sever her tibial artery, and the next day she's up and kicking in a cast - no infection, no apparent fever, ah the miracles of make-up - after supposedly being repaired by what appears as a village bonesetter - and this is 1944 occupied France, remember, not ""Emergency Room"": reminds me of Schwarzenegger's ""Last Action Hero"" and his famous ""just a flesh wound"" - the ultimate film on action films, as referential on the history of cinema as any Tarantino movie and the reason why I'll always be friends with the former Governor of California, notwithstanding everything else. Three of the Jewish-American avengers think they have a chance of getting into the movie theatre where the premiere is taking place, passing off for Italians (a language none of them speaks), because ""the Germans don't have a good ear for Italian accents"". A guy gets three pistol bullets in the back at close range but still manages to survive a few more minutes to shoot back by surprise and kill his killer. A German sniper shooting down some 300 American soldiers from his Italian bell tower - why the Americans didn't send a tank destroy the tower, as the Germans did in ""Saving Private Ryan"",  is probably best explained by the fact that Tarantino's scene is presumably meant as a spoof of Spielberg's. Sure, at least an attempt at an explanation is provided in the ""Goebbels film in the film"" (supposedly depiciting the true story of the German war hero), ""Nation's Pride"", which is offered complete as a bonus feature: a humanistic US colonel refuses to be the one responsible for turning ""1000-years history into dust"", preferring to see 300 of his men shot; but, other than the fact that this can hardly be considered any more ""rational"" or credible than the rest (it might have been best not even trying to explain it), it seems also rather entirely inconsistent with the premise that this is supposed to be a Goebbels, anti-American propaganda film, so why would depict such a humanistic US colonel in such a positive light? Or maybe this is Tarantino's view of Goebbels' view of American Jewish-determined degeneracy: a degenerate soldier being (in the view of Goebbels as viewed by Tarantino) one who refuses to put to dust 1000-years history to save 300 men? Still, wouldn't it have been much more clever of Tarantino, and much more in-sync with what his film is about, to have made one of these oblique references he loves to make, here to  ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence"" and its famous concluding motto: ""When the legend becomes fact, print the legend"". Meaning, the sniper never actually shot 300 GIs, they did blow down the tower and he managed to save his skin, running away. The rest is only Goebbels' propaganda film. Well, Tarantino didn't ask for my advice on his best script ever (see hereafter).

Oh, and, of course, the ending: Hitler, Goebbels, Goering and all the dignitaries of the Nazi regime being shot down and burnt down to flames in the Paris movie theatre. As we know, it didn't quite end that way.

And these are only the bigger absurdities. Let's move on to the small things, and back at the movie's beginning: a Jewish family being dairy farmers in the middle of nowhere in 1941 nazi-occupied France? The chief Nazi Jew-hunter coming all the way down to an isolated dairy farm in the middle of nowhere in 1941 Nazi-occupied France to hunt down a single Jewish family - and not the Rothschilds, mind you, just a nobody Jewish family of dairy farmers?? And - this one in fact even more outlandish than Hitler's portrayal, but with Tarantino there's not much difference between the big things and the small things - a (non-Jewish) dairy farmer in the middle of nowhere in 1941 nazi-occupied France speaking English????

Finally, the biggest absurdity of all, the one that strains to the extreme one's ability to voluntarily suspend one's disbelief: Brad Pitt with a Tennessee drawl. But at least this one is downright funny.

So: none of this can be taken seriously - at least if your mental development hasn't stopped at the age of 15, which I am not entirely sure is the case with Tarantino or his audience. And to think that he claimed it to be his best script to date - makes you shiver at the thought of what the worst ones might be. It is little more than ""Sergeant Rock"" made into a 70-million dollar motion picture.

Not that all of it is at that level of puerility, fortunately. There are a few nice scenes - starting with the opening cat and mouse confrontation between the SS Jew Hunter Hans Landa (Oscar winner Christoph Waltz) and the French dairy farmer Perrier Lapadite (Denis Menochet) - something like ""Lapadite's Choice"". Both actors are here exceptional, Landa in his cruel playfulness and Lapadite in his taciturn rock-like massiveness, until his break-down in tears. In fact, every appearance of Christoph Waltz is a good scene. Another one is when the rendez-vous between the spies at the remote village tavern goes awry because a gathering of German soldiers has unexpectedly chosen the same place to celebrate, and because, through the secret workings of Tarantino as the film's script-writer, the Gestapo officer has felt, that same evening, the compulsion to go precisely at that same tavern. Clearly Tarantino loves wracking the nerves of his audience with these contests of wits - will the good guys find a way to smoothly get rid of the bad guys or will it all skid into violence? In fact, one of the interesting underlying threads of Tarantino's movie - and it is I think a pattern in all his movies - is how things do NOT go according to plan. That pattern is also the main propellant of the final scene, the big movie showdown, which has a few nice turns to it - especially when the giant, ghost-like image of the Jewish girl's face hurling her imprecations at the Nazi dignitiaries appears against the smokes of the burning theatre.

But the script has more problems too than only the implausibilities, the improbabilities and the impossibilities. Take that first scene, for instance, the ""Lapadite's Choice"", at the end of which Hans Landa the Jew Hunter lets the Jewish girl, Shoshana, escape from the massacre of her family. In fact, when you reflect upon it, you realize that that scene bears very little relation to the rest of the film, it is just the idea that Tarantino had for a great scene that he didn't quite find a way to link to the rest of the movie, and the rest of the movie could have very well existed without that scene. When, some years later, Landa meets the same girl again, Tarantino makes very little of the encounter, and then leaves it at that.

Furthermore, Tarantino's apparent inability, or unwillingness, to choose a style/mood raises questions. The film starts like a psychological drama that Spielberg or Pakula could have filmed, then continues like a comic-book cardboard caricature or a film in the style of Jerry Lewis' ""Which Way to the Front"" (but with Tarantino's typical gory violence), and from there constantly veers back and forth, so that it leaves the audience never quite knowing on which foot to stand. And while I recognize that this apparent incapacity of choosing if this is going to be a serious, dramatic film or a mere spoof is probably a trademark of Tarantino's style, it is also, I feel, one of the film's problems. Maybe this way of playing cat and mouse with the public's expectations is a fine directorial trick in pure, ""Pulp"" fictions; but in a fiction like ""Inglourious Basterds"", taking place in a historical context, and one whose memory isn't erased (see the previous review), you can't so easily evacuate the historical facts as mere fiction. Hitler isn't Richard III, and Tarantino's ""serious"" scenes do not make his grotesque ones any less absurd and silly - on the contrary: they look even more jarringly silly. The two simply don't stick together.

But then, Tarantino's cinematographic culture is unquestionable - even if it seems rather undiscriminating, putting on an equal footing masterpiece and turkey. So one needs to go beyond the instinctive reactions, and give it a little more thought. What was Tarantino aiming at when turning a 70-cents comic book into a 70-million dollars film? Was he just doing that - a kid's mind in a star movie director's body able to toy with 70 million dollars and getting his shot at turning ""Sergeant Rock"" into a movie, period? If so, it is almost terrifying to think that Tarantino - and most of the critics, and most of the audience - have apparently seemed unable to give one thought to the fact that a motion picture is perhaps not just an animated cartoon, that there is a huge difference not just of medium but fundamentally of message between the 2-D, gaudy drawings and the 3-D, gaudy but hugely realistic motion picture. Godard once said something to the effect that a traveling is not so much a matter of technique as of ethics, and maybe Tarantino didn't quite get that part. To be quite honest, I didn't either before seeing Tarantino's film. Many have raved about Tarantino's ""brilliant"" camera work, and sure, it is often brilliant, imaginative, virtuosic. But if it is just a display of camera virtuosity - hey, see how I can impress you! - at the service of a void of purpose and thinking, then it is no less hollow and puerile than all the rest.

But maybe there is more to the film than only that, and I get my clue from the ending. Beyond and despite the portrayal caricatures and the huge credibility gaps, there can always be some pretense at realism as long as you don't depart from the more important historical facts: after all, Hitler didn't but COULD have come to Paris to see the premiere of a Goebbels movie, and after all there could have been a failed attempt to assassinate him, similar to Von Stauffenberg's in 1944. But when Tarantino stages the actual success of the Hitler-Goeebels-Goering assassination, and at the hands of three Jews and one Blackman, then you know you are totally out of reality. You are in a kid's fantasy-world where the lambs slaughter the wolves, where the oppressed eliminate the oppressors. And this is the kind of world that (only?) comics, or the movies, can create. So it is significant that the final showdown should take place precisely in a movie theatre. What is Tarantino telling us through the fact that the theatre is burnt down in flames with the throng of bad guys, burnt down from the inside and by its own propellant - the highly inflammable stock of nitrate films that was kept in the theatre? The editorial comment reminds us that Tarantino said at the Cannes Film Festival that he wanted to show Hitler defeated by cinema. But what he actually shows us is cinema destroyed along with Hitler.

In the contest of actors, Germany wins, hands down. Sure, as I mentioned, Martin Wuttke as Hitler is a caricature, but Brad Pitt's Aldo Raine is no less - oh the war seems so cool 'n easy with a guy like that - so that's a tie. The other American actors aren't given much scope by Tarantino to develop much of anything. On the other hand, while Christoph Waltz' performance has been showered with praise, and legitimately so, the equally brilliant performance of Sylvester Groth as Goebbels hasn't been commented upon enough. Diane Kruger as the German Actress/double agent is also quite good - and I can vouch that her French is so good (which even some traces of French accent when she speaks German, it seemed to me) that I first wondered why Tarantino had chosen a French actress to portray a German character.",1303603200,4,14698,4.781889763779527

The movie was up for eight Academy Awards so you know there were a lot of aspects to it that were done well, from the acting to the photography to the sound and screenplay.  Yet - see below - I had read a lot of negative reviews on this movie and really wasn't anxious to see it.  I only saw it because it was free at the library. Afterward, I was so impressed I bought a copy.

As I reflected upon this film, I realized how good it must have been to keep my interest as well as it did for two-and-a-half hours of mostly dialect and a lot of it with subtitles.

It made me realize just how intense and good the actors were in this film, all of them with a lot to offer. Brad Pitt is the ""big name"" of the group, and his character is really strange, but there is an ""unknown"" German actor in here, Christopher Waltz, who stole the show as ""Col. Hans Landa, The Jew Killer."" He was just mesmerizing, particularly in the opening scene which was incredibly tense. I'm glad to find out he won an Oscar for his performance.

About 2/3's of the way through the movie it hit me what was going on; the movie is about headgames!

I immediately started the movie over and watched it from the headgame perspective.  Inglourious Basterds is BRILLIANT in every scene from start to finish demonstrating both how to play headgames on others and how one's own headgames messes with your own behavior.  The script, pace, timing, and total commitment of every character to the headgames they are going to inflict or endure is masterful. The movie plays like a mental chess game where the characters disarm, position, or manipulate their opponents, establish their offense, then attack when the time is right.  Every chapter demonstrates something new to add to the story.

If you have to deal with headgames in your life at any level, watch Inglourious Basterds with your brain turned into the headgame frequency.  You will be entertained and educated.",1301702400,2,1265,5.131707317073171

3954784,4,B002MZZMRM,"`Inglourious Basterds' is a typical Tarantino film and if you are a fan of his films then this will right up your street. This is set in WW2 and follows a group of American commandos who are behind enemy lines and who terrorize nazi soldiers to lower morale. It also features a Jewish cinema owner who plans to enact her own form of revenge; both stories weave their way separately through the film and join up at the end. This is shot in a series of vignettes (very much in the pulp fiction style) and each little episode provides an extra element to the overall story. Some of the dialogue and behaviour of the Basterds will make you laugh, that is until the retribution begins and then you get the usual Tarantino ultra violence that will make you wince as you watch. The Basterds behaviour is as deplorable as the nazis at times, but their delivery and flair raise a wry smile throughout. There is an excellent cast, with many decent actors playing small roles as well as main characters and whilst the direction is stylised it is easily as good as previous films by Tarantino. The ending is ludicrous but is shot with tongue firmly in cheek and although complete fantasy, it is the ending you would want to make this a satisfying film experience. It's not real, but it is good cinema. This was better than I expected and is worth a watch at some point, just note that it is an 18 certificate for a reason.

3954791,4,B002MZZMRM,"This is in no way a true story, though it is based on true situations. The Germans in general and the German SS in particular killed millions of Jews, one by one, one after another, or massively in their camps. And when the Jewish local band at Auschwitz was playing some music for some inner celebration of some kind, thousands were arriving on the trains and were disembarked on the platform, sorted out for shower and then cremated. The crematorium never stopped burning.

That in France, in the Resistance or dropped into the country with parachutes generally, there were units, some made up of Jews from all nations around the world, is no surprise, is no invention. That these units were vengeful and tried to make some Germans they could catch, SS or not, pay for their evil actions in suffering and torturing and all kinds of other immoral, unwarlike and despicable actions is no invention. There were at least some and maybe many.

To make a film on that very subject is not uninteresting. But does it have any interest for the knowledge of history, for the education of the younger generations, for the moral and ethical good of everyone? Certainly not. It is a film about war seen as an act of vengeance, and the film itself is an act of vengeance against people who are not there to say a word about it. Vengeance is not a good attitude. Try to imagine what the Vietnamese should say, show and even do against the French or the Americans because of the Indochina or Vietnam wars if they were vengeful.

But then why did Tarantino, a good film maker, and Brad Pitt, a good actor, decided to do that film? To follow Tom Cruise in that territory, but Tom Cruise was at least dealing with a real episode of the war. Maybe to deal with some ""respectable"" horror, horror that can be said ethical or ethically motivated? As for that the film is dealing with so many clichs about the sexual and brutal phantasms of standard human beings that it becomes a parade of events about which we seem to think, one after the other, how gory is it going to be? Gory, exciting, gross, disgusting? We seem to be appealed by the entry ""horror"" of a thesaurus. I find this film regrettable and very badly inspired.

Apart from that, the film is well done, contains a good dose of suspense or thrilling expectations, and the editing as much as the shooting (what a word in this context) are realistic enough to make us believe we are in Paris or we are in history. But it takes more than good technique to make a good film. Since the dominant point of view in the film is Jewish, I consider that this vengeful attitude in Jews is absolutely unacceptable, and I can tell you those I know and who have done something during the war, did not do that kind of horror which was more on the side of the SS for one and some resistance groups that were not exactly controlled by presentable networks: there were some freelance groups that only took advantage of the situation to loot, raid and just satisfy their death instinct on anyone who could be in their way, far from it only the Germans.

Now we are 65 years after the end of this butchery we could start in the film industry to get to a more historical perspective and not to some crazy idea that Hitler could have been burnt up with all its accomplices in a Paris local cinema by a Jewish female survivor, a black man, and the non-coordinated help of two American Jews. Or maybe it is just plain Jewish black humor. But the subject is badly chosen and that kind of humor has to be self-deprecating. It is not. Those Jewish barbarians want to appear as war heroes not as pathetic puppets in the hands of some illuminated blood-crazed scalp-obsessed guru.

Inglorious Basterds is not only Tarantino's finest work, but the one with the greatest range of critiques (the relatively even distribution among the Amazon ratings proves that).  It it difficult to write a review for this particular Tarantino film because it is all over the place.  Some are turned away from this; but I absolutely adore it.  Every single aspect of this movie was done wonderfully.  Tarantino obviously puts in major distractions in the film (such as a short 70's style action short, a hilarious 5 seconds slow-mo attack set to music, and Mike Meyers as a British officer).  He does this with such perfection and timing that I feel it is absolutely necessary to make such a masterpiece.

The opening scene will give you one of the most intense but mellow interrogation scenes.  Another reviewer stated that the lead SS officer is much like Hannibal Lecter in his demeanor, tone, and somber insanity without the cannibalism (though enough violence to make up for that loss).

I only buy movies when I feel it is something worth owning.  This film is a rare gem for me.  It is one big W.T.F movie yet supremely entertaining and in all regards, from the extreme violence to the masterful acting*.

I especially liked how he remained true to the foreign languages as most of the movie is in French and German with English as third followed by a dash of Italian.

*If you are not a fan of his style, you should watch the film for the acting alone.  I have never seen a better ensemble in any film.

While some take ""Basterds"" as a film that glorifies violence and is disrespectful to WWII soldiers, bear in mind that this is a hyperbolic WWII revenge fantasy and does not pass itself off as anything but.

While this film requires a huge suspension of disbelief, the plot was interesting - quite a lot of little sub plots and twists to keep us guessing and Waltz's ""Hans Landa"" role was written and executed to perfection. The 1st scene on the farm is by far the best in the film. So much suspense written into those little cues, the analogy of the rat, the pipe... While Brad Pitt and his mangling of the italian language was the light touch on what was essentially a lonely story of a jewish girl's plan to avenge her family's murder.

A few issues that I had was that,
a)anti climatic ending - for such a fantastical film, couldn't they have done something more creative with Hitler in the cinema?
b)the characters had virtually no characterisation with maybe the exception of Shosanna
c)we don't know enough about the assasination plot. Maybe we could have been let in on more of the tactics and the attempt itself could have been a lot more exciting if Hans Landa wasn't the only intelligent Nazi in the film

After the first fifteen minutes had gone by, I wanted to leave, but stayed because I kept hoping there would soon be a reversal of the plot, in order to 'save' this movie. It never came. Don't bother buying this movie. I'm sorry but I don't see the need for humor in a war movie. War is anything but funny, just ask any Veteran of combat.

3954799,4,B002MZZMRM,"Obviously the trailer, and the fact that it is a Tarantino movie, made this look like it would be Kill Bill, meets WW2. Unfortunately, it was both better, and worse than I expected. After seeing it in theaters, I was very disappointed. The acting was easily some of the best I've ever seen, however the reason I went was for the Basterds, who were barely in it.

Watching it the second time, I knew what to expect and I could appreciate it for what it was, however it could have been even better, had Brad Pitt and the gang been in this movie more. Here are some pros and cons:

Pros:Perfect acting. Nice special effects. Great characters. Decent story.

Cons:Long, drawn-out soliloquies. Not enough action.
Fantasy WW2 story made me question why this film was even made. I mean, I get that there are a lot of great fictional history stories, however including Hitler in such a un-historical way, took me out of the movie a bit.

3954802,5,B002MZZMRM,"At the end of the film, Pitt states ""I think this may be my masterpiece"" (or something to that nature) and in regards to Tarantino and his directorial efforts, I think that statement may apply here (however, not in regards to Brad Pitt who, sadly, is that acting `weak link' in this film).  Yes, Tarantino will have legions of fans bickering in rabid fashion over which gargantuan cult classic is the best (most will cheer for `Pulp Fiction', some `Kill Bill' and, until I saw this film, I was all about `Reservoir Dogs') but at the end of the day, when you stack everything back to back to back, his latest effort makes it very clear that he has learned and certainly grown as a director over the course of his career.

This film is nearly perfect.

I could go on all day dissecting this film and layer my review with countless praise-littered sentiments, but I'm going to try and refrain, just a little.

I'm often told I'm a tad longwinded.

The story itself is a fabricated fantasy piece set in the times of the Nazi regime where Tarantino has a group of violence-fascinated `Nazi Killers' waging war with a `Jew Hunter' and his reign of terror.  They aren't alone in their mission of hate-filled executions though.  At the films outset we are introduced to Landa, the `Jew Hunter', as he slaughters a Jewish family taking refuge in another man's home.  One of the family members, a young girl, escapes.  She in turn, years later, is presented with a rare opportunity that she cannot let slip through her fingers; revenge.

The film never once appears lacking in rich Tarantino style, but it also carries with it a layer of sophistication that is not found in most of his work.  It is more polished; crisper if you will.  While some will balk at my statement and point out that `Pulp Fiction' itself is `sophisticated' (an assessment I will stand behind), I feel compelled to point out that while I love both films, this latest entry in the Tarantino roster surely shows much maturing since Tarantino's 90's heyday.  The narrative flow feels far less like a gimmick (yes, that is an accusation made against `Pulp Fiction', and one that bares some truth) and more like a fully fleshed out plot piece.  And while Tarantino has shown great visual flare in many of his films, especially his `Kill Bill' epic, he has never exuded so much class into his visual opuses as he does here.  Just look at the opening sequence.  It is breathtakingly staged, brilliantly acted and flawlessly captured.  The visual is fresh, rich and certainly eye-catching, but it isn't over-the-top.  The spectacle of it all doesn't take away from the seriousness of it all.  There is the tension, the dread, the emotional gut punch; not to mention the perfectly times flares of humor that take the scene to a whole new level.  In fact, that opening sequence should be preserved in a room for all struggling artists to venture when needing inspiration (that and the opening sequence to Fincher's `The Social Network').  It is a brilliant and inspired way to open a film, setting the tone effortlessly and inviting us (or should I say CONVINCING US) to walk right alongside Tarantino for the entire journey.

Oh lord; I am getting longwinded, aren't I?

I wanted to touch upon the acting, because as an ensemble it really does shine (and Christoph Waltz's Oscar win was VERY deserved).  Yes, Pitt is here and he is decent but he is also a tad overdone and certainly the films weakest performance.  In fact, Fassbender has a VERY short scene and yet he acts circles around anything Pitt does, adding an entire back-story to his devilishly charming grin.  That said; Waltz is just phenomenal, layering Landa with so much unintentional wit that you can't help but totally `get this guy'.  Sure, he's a creep, but you want him around.  Besides, Waltz really understood how to work with his fellow actors.  He plays off of them in each and every scene, and it actually boosts the performances of the entire cast.  In fact, some of the best moments come from other actors working off of Waltz's presence.  The other GIGANTIC standout here is Melanie Laurent.  She is mesmerizing here, and totally nails the inner tension that presents itself in her character.  She is not only stunning (seriously, gorgeous to look at) but she embodies the films moral core (yes, it has one) and exudes a sense of profound entitlement that I think is necessary to accepting the film as more than torture-porn.

There is a method to Tarantino's madness, and Laurent holds the key.

In the end I'm totally in this films corner.  It really should have swept at the Oscars (at least when you consider the films it was nominated against).  This film is far more entertaining, creative, stylistic, memorable and profound than James Cameron's opus of gigantic smurf people and their protests to `save the planet'.",1287964800,23,4856,4.731272294887039

3954805,3,B002MZZMRM,"One of the most surprising movies I've seen lately is Inglourious Basterds (2009), written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Having seen the trailers a gazillion times last year when it was heavily advertised on TV, I was not at all wanting to see this film. It looked very campy and cheesy. And it is to some degree...but not as much I thought. I just finally saw Tarantino's widely acclaimed masterpiece Pulp Fiction (1994) a few years ago, and I didn't find it to live up to all the hype that I've heard about it. I think part of the problem is that I watched Pulp Fiction about a dozen years after it came out. And because it was very influential on movie making, I saw pieces of it reflected in other movies that I've seen. So seeing the original inspiration doesn't seem so inspirational and cutting edge after you've seen it in other movies over and over. Some movies are just very much of their time. And I think Pulp Fiction is one of those movies...and I missed out on its time. Having watched some older movies from the 30s, 40s, 50s, etc. in Cinema History class, I didn't really appreciate them either. They just didn't feel as complete as modern movies. But then we are all a product of our time, aren't we?!

Inglourious Basterds is gorgeously filmed. This is the kind of movie you show to someone to showcase what's possible with film. And when I say film, I mean real 35mm celluloid film stock. Not digital video. I do think digital video will look just like film someday...but that day is still a ways off. There's a subtlety and range of light expression on film that still isn't fully realized on digital cameras like the Red camera. Beyond the incredible cinematography, Tarantino has crafted an incredible showcase of acting talent. The performances, while sometimes over the top a bit, are a testament to Tarantino's directing skill. He's able to get such finely nuanced acting out of his cast. The movie starts pretty slow and drawn out, and it wasn't until about halfway through that I even knew I liked the film. And then all during the second half I was appreciating the first half. The writing is very engaging and well executed by the cast. All in all, this a film that any movie lover should watch. Tarantino's work is unique and original and he is making his mark on the world of cinema. So far, I think this is his best mark.",1286236800,,2358,4.535211267605634

Tarantino brings back the old spaghetti westerns but set towards the end of the Second World War. Anybody who grew up on Kelly's Heroes, the Dirty Dozen and spaghetti westerns understand the realm of seriously flawed but adorable heroes.

Everyone was expecting the great American ending when all we get is a big bang heroes fantasy. Its just not-so-good guys versus really bad guys. Its funny in all the unexpected places. Its like a new journey on a familiar road. No tormented good guys just people who would normally be locked-up now wearing the shoes of would-be-saviors.

3954819,4,B002MZZMRM,"This is by far the most bizarre WW2 film I've ever seen.  Brad Pitt plays an Army lieutenant who leads a small band of Jewish-American soldiers in a guerrilla campaign behind enemy lines.  There they act in terroristic fashion, capturing and slaughtering small groups of German soldiers for their scalps.  Pitt's character in fact demands ""100 Nazi scalps"" of each of his men as a price for joining his unit.  The purpose of all this killing and maiming is to strike terror in the hearts of those who have kept occupied Europe in the grip of fear for years.

One thing I noticed is that the movie dispenses with the usual formulas - very refreshing!  There is no ""boy meets girl and the two fall in love"" angle.  There is no ""show how noble the hero is by having him refrain from killing his evil opponent"" nonsense, a la Batman saving the Joker's life in the Dark Knight.

Pitt's Basterds are viciously cruel to those they capture, even gleefully so.  In this sense the film is far more realistic than the usual formulaic crap Hollywood throws at us.  In real war the only thing that separates the ""good guys"" from their enemies is the
side they fight for.  In their methods they are just as savage and barbaric as their foes.  Anyone who doubts this need only review the bombing of Dresden by Allied planes.

Those who gave this fantastic movie one star can't face that, thus their ridiculous ""weren't the 'heroes' just as bad as the Nazis?"" remarks.  The problem with this line of reasoning should be obvious to them.  No action is divorced from the context in which it occurs.  Just because a deed turns your stomach doesn't make it any less correct.  Like it or not, in the real world the end usually does justify the means.

I dinged ""Basterds"" one star simply because in many other ways it is totally implausible.  Eight guys behind Nazi lines successfully eluding capture for months or years?  Nonsense.  The US Army not ensuring that each of those men, especially their leader, speak fluent German?  Even more nonsensical.  The prospect of the four top leaders of Hitler's Reich all being in the same place at the same time, in an occupied country with a strong resistance movement? Preposterous.

Despite these weaknesses I loved the movie overall.  Be advised: this is an ""alternate reality"" take on the war.  Don't expect it to remain faithful to the history books.

Fair enough, though I feel they tend to lose their appeal on repeated viewings. ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a different animal altogether---within his work, its the other side of the planet. Its a period piece...its a multi-international dialogue/cast...and, most importantly, the  dialogue is all pertinent to the story being told---it works wonders. I felt (as I know others did) that with ""Death Proof"", he chewed up valuable time with mostly unnecessary dialogue. With ""I.B."", he hits the highest mark he's ever hit, bless 'im.

I hire movies regularly through Amazon, and have enjoyed the experience so far. Having never had a problem before, I'm posting this review as I suspect it might be relevant to this particular file/video and it might help anyone else wishing to watch it!

Throughout the film, there were random frames from other scenes inserted every few minutes, making the viewing experience seriously distracting. At first I thought it might be Tarantino doing his ""unique"" thing (hah), as well as it being a familiar device with Brad Pitt on-screen (Fight Club). However, it had no relevance to the film and a quick Google seems to indicate no-one else commenting about the strange frames. Similarly, three times during the film everything went black and the FBI's piracy warning (as seen at the start) came up on screen...promptly disappearing before I could reach for my mouse to figure out what was going on. As mentioned earlier, I've never had a problem with the Video-On-Demand service using this computer/internet connection, and given that it's always worked perfectly with previous hires/purchases, I can only surmise that something's wrong with this particular stream.

Quite frankly, it ruined the movie for me because I was never able to concentrate on what was happening - the regular FBI piracy warnings and random frame inserts throughout were too distracting. I'm disappointed...the idea of making relatively small payments to watch something legally is something I very much support - at least everyone gets something that they want (customer and producer alike).

This was the first Tarantino movie I have seen since Jackie Brown, and regret wasting my time on this joke of a film.  Pulp Fiction will always be one of my favorites, but is Tarantino turning into our generation's Orson Welles?

However, quite honestly they could have been left completely out of the film with very little effort--they were nothing more than background characters popping in every now and again.  Pitt's character had so much potential to be interesting, but we never learn hardly anything about him and he quickly becomes rather generic.  Similarly, the plot itself had quite a bit of potential to be intriguing and enthralling, but instead became labored and boring.

Usual Tarantino use of quirky narrative juxtapositions, excellent performances from actors (Gestapo officer here is excellent.) anachronistic music, dialog and cultural assumptions and over the top violence. The problem is the protagonists are directly involved with historical figures and what happens to them in the film did not happen. There is a reel missing at the end of the movie in my view. As my own inferior suggestion by way solely of example, If one of the basterds had not been killed in the cellar bar then one could cut from the end of the movie to him being revived by Landa or the Basterds, the realization all was still to play for but then we would have to imagine why and how it did not happen.",1277942400,,747,4.582089552238806
3954833,1,B002MZZMRM,"Just another venue for Tarantino to express his lust for sadism and mutilation. Doing it to Nazis is safe, who doesn't hate the Nazis? Oddly, in the movie the Nazis are portrayed as intelligent, educated and even heroic. For example, one Nazi with dignity chose to have his brains bashed with a baseball bat, rather than betray his country, while the Americans are the ones perpetrating the atrocities.
Tarantino's premise is that the Nazis, which is short for the National Socialist Worker's Party, were so bad that the heroes in the movie need to kill and mutilate as many of them as possible. Yet, Tarantino gave to Michael More the top French film award for his Socialist propaganda flick.
I endured the movie dragging on for 2 1/2 hours because I read it has an Academy Award potential. There is lots of talk in several languages and with subtitles. The subtitles flash fast, had to constantly stop the movie just to keep up with what is going on, only to read more drivel. Worse, the subtitles are yellow, shown on light background.
Brad Pitt, who is usually interesting to watch, plays a macho redneck with a not well-developed southern accent and only in a small portion of the movie. As to the plot, it is idiotic and boring.",1277856000,13,1234,4.665137614678899
3954834,4,B002MZZMRM,"Quentin Tarantino returns to form with ""Inglorious Basterds,"" an uber-violent World War II revenge fantasy, modeled, at least in part, on ""The Dirty Dozen.""

Brad Pitt, replete with noose-scarred neck and Southern drawl, plays Aldo Raine, a lieutenant in the U.S. military, who's recruited a band of Jewish mercenaries - dubbed the Inglorious Basterds - to roam the war torn countryside killing Nazis then removing their scalps as souvenirs.  The few who are allowed to survive have a swastika carved into their foreheads as a warning to all future victims that the boys are coming to get them.

The ""basterds"" get their best opportunity to inflict maximum damage when Goebbels agrees to premiere one of his Nazi propaganda films in a theater in occupied France, a premiere at which just about anyone who's anyone among the German high command - including Der Fuhrer himself - will be in attendance.  The plan is for the ""basterds"" to go in and annihilate virtually the entire Nazi regime in one fell swoop.

After years in which we've watched Jews in WWII films being marched off helplessly to death camps, ""Inglorious Basterds"" provides an almost purgative function by letting us see the victims finally doling out some long overdue, eye-for-an-eye justice to their murderous oppressors - even if it's a retribution largely consigned to the realm of fantasy and fiction (though the recent ""Defiance"" obviously provided us with a factual account of just such a turnabout).

Interestingly, though, despite their having star billing in the title, the ""basterds"" themselves are actually accorded a surprisingly small amount of screen time in the movie, so that anyone going into it expecting nonstop violent action scenes centered around the group's activities may be sorely disappointed.  In reality, much more of the movie's 152-minute running time is devoted to the story of a beautiful Jewess (Melanie Laurent) who, after escaping death at the hands of a sadistic SS colonel (the brilliant Christopher Waltz in his bravura Oscar-winning performance), is now, as the owner of the theater where the movie will be shown, in a unique position to exact her revenge, both for herself and for all her people who have suffered under this brutal regime (her plan is to burn the theater down with all the Nazis inside).

Tarantino has self-consciously divided his screenplay into five subtitled chapters.  The scenes within each chapter run long and all take place in a single setting, but they are rarely static, thanks to Tarantino's skill at composition, his penchant for crackling dialogue, and the suspense that arises organically from the situations being dramatized.  Still, this is far from a fast-paced action-movie crowd-pleaser, so one should be forewarned that a certain amount of patience is required from the viewer.

Episodic in structure and deliberate in its pacing - with a healthy dose of black humor and a soundtrack just anachronistic enough to provide the imprimatur of ""coolness"" one demands from a Tarantino film - ""Inglorious Basterds"" provides an imperfect but imaginative spin on World War II ""history.""",1277769600,,3122,5.1623762376237625

3954836,2,B002MZZMRM,"INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS has its moments.  In fact the whole movie would have been better served if Brad Pitt and his commando team had been left out of the movie completely.  The story would have been sustainable if the plot was  limited to the Jewish cinema manager plotting her revenge against the Germans.  The Basterds themselves are a mere subplot lost in the bigger story.

The primary plot is that of a Jewish girl as the sole survivor of a farmhouse massacre. Four years later she finds herself as the proprietor of a Paris cinema where the Germans have planned to screen the French premier of a German sniper movie.  As it turns out the leadership of the Third Reich will also be in attendence.  The theater is subsequently rigged as a pyrotechnic trap.

So far, so good.  Unfortunately Brad Pitt and his blood thirsty band are inserted into the story.  Essentially the Basterds have one major scene where they brutally interrogate captured German prisoners while collecting scalps from the German dead.  They later play but a small supporting role in the cinema adventure.

One of the things you have to realize about this film is that it is historical fantasy with a comic book quality story.  It is not designed to be historically accurate.  As such if you are a World War Two buff you have to set aside your expertise and turn a blind eye to the dozens of blatant geographic, uniform, and general historical inaccuracies presented throughout this film.

I give the Quentin Tarantino credit for attempting a European style war film (At least that portion excluding the Basterds).  This movie has some similarities to Paul Verhoeven's BLACK BOOK.  For that I give it two stars.  Otherwise Tarantino was as much out of his depth as when Spike Lee Lee attempted to inject his well-trodden agenda into a World WarTwo drama.",1277596800,11,1828,4.785942492012779
3954837,5,B002MZZMRM,"What happens when you take ""Wake Island"" (a great WWII Hollywood propaganda film), the timeless ""Casablanca"", the superb fantasy adventure ""The Dirty Dozen"" and a few other war films that glorify war and add Quentin Tarantino's rather vivid imagination to the mix?

 You get ""Inglorious Basterds"", a fantasy war thriller that pays homage to all the great films of war as glorious adventure genre with an outlandish plot that Tarentino gets to work.

 The story opens with Lieutenant Aldo Raine briefing his squad of eight Jewish American soldiers that their job is to kill Nazis. Lots of Nazis. Pure fantasy.

 On the Nazi side, there is SS Colonel Hans Landa who is proud to be called ""The Jew Hunter"" and the film spends considerable time demonstrating how Landa earned the sobriquet. Landa, played in an Academy Award winning style by Chrisoph Waltz is comic book exaggerated and, if you know your history, all too real of a type.

 While the ""Inglorious Basterds"" are wreaking their havoc, a Paris cinema owner with a past is being romanced by a Nazi hero. With good reason, she rejects his advances, but he finds a way to inveigle himself into her life that lets her realize a diabolical ambition.

 The paths of the Inglorious Basterds and the cinema owner intersect in a beyond the pale pair of plots.

 The movie is pure Tarentino. Inventive story and story telling. Blood and violence by the bucket. Characters quickly drawn in a comic book style. And no attachment to reality, but that minor detail is forgotten as Tarentino rushes along.

 Great moviemaking. (But a lot of people will find the bloodletting upsetting.)

But no matter how much of a fan I am, I cannot condone what he has done here.

Seems plausible.  Then Tarantino gathers the entire Nazi high-command in ONE movie THEATER in Paris, and BLOWS THE THEATER UP, killing them all... JUST 3 WEEKS AFTER D-DAY!!!!!!

Instead I kept waiting for a twist which didn't occur.,1276473600,,376,4.828125
3954841,2,B002MZZMRM,"Even in the fantasy world of Hollywood, this movie goes beyond the pale of plausibility and stupidity. The premise is that a small group of American, mostly Jewish, psychopaths, several of whom can't even speak a word of German (or French, or Italian or Spanish or even understandable English, like in the case of Pitt's character and his overdone southern accent) are sent to Europe during World War II, infiltrate the Nazi occupied countries and surreptitiously go on a long, endless killing spree of Nazi's without being detected.  Their ""heroic"" actions, in the film, lead to an event that ultimately ends the war. Tarantino's plot could have easily been dreamed up by Brad Pitt's alter-ego - Stu Pid.
  Perhaps some Americans, at least those who have never progressed past the 2nd grade or even looked at the pictures in a history book, may actually believe that this plot is somehow based on actual events. Unfortunately, in reality, my guess is that if the real Nazi's had been as lackadaisical about security as the one's in Tarantino's film, the United States would never have had to enter the war in Europe to begin with - the Germans would have easily and quickly been defeated by the Poles, the inept French or an angry troop of aggressive boy scouts long before 1941.  The problems with the plot of this movie are so numerous, I'm not sure I would be able to list them all even if I reviewed ""Basterds"" frame by frame - which in and of itself would be an incredibly nauseating task.  But the gaps in the story are more like gaping holes. The main character, Lt. Aldo Raine played by Brad Pitt, a good old boy from Tennessee who loves killing Nazis in any grisly fashion he can think up and then having his troops take their scalps.  Adding to the other problems here is the fact that the movie is heavily subtitled, something that can actually enhance the realism if done correctly, but here it is frequently done against backgrounds that are the same shade and color as the font.  The story skips important details that would have made the plot flow more evenly, while dragging in far too many places. Some of the scenes are excruciatingly long.  And unbelievably, the Basterds murderous, noisy actions are never seen or heard by anyone else, even when they take place in a public venue - like a tavern. It's only the Basterds and their' victims.
  The Nazi's were heartless and cruel and one would be hard pressed to feel sorry for goose-stepping thugs who took part in the torture, killing and enslavement of millions of innocent men, women and children, but in this film, Tarantino's attempt to show the swastika wearing goons getting their come-up-ins, makes the viewer feel more empty and depressed than satisfied. To sum up, Basterds is a poorly executed extravaganza conceived primarily, I assume, to indulge those who would hope to see some imaginary form of macabre revenge exacted on unrepentant fascist bullies; the how things should have been if there were justice in the world factor for the Nazi executioners of millions of Jews and countless others. Unfortunately, it falls far short in nearly every department. Regrettably, the result is neither enjoyable nor entertaining to watch.

As some other reviewers have pointed out, this movie is not really about the ""nazi-killers"" led by Brad Pitt.  Brad Pitt is hardly in this movie.

3954851,5,B002MZZMRM,"""Inglourious Basterds"" is Quentin Tarantino's ironic and fanciful retelling of an episode from World War II. He directed and wrote the film. He's a very imaginative moviemaker who is a fanatical movie buff, very interested in the writing and the dialogue, and he has some American Indian ancestry which will explain a number of features of this film. Sit back and savor the story and the way it is told. It is at times leisurely paced because he wants moviegoers to relish the dialogue. It's a moviegoer's delight with a lot of inside movie stuff going on.
 It's a rousing action-adventure yarn, melodramatic, and in the best movie tradition. There's some hammy, over-the-top acting, a lot of violence, and a very cleverly devised screenplay. You'll see flashbacks that help to elucidate the story or characters, and the names of some characters will be telegraphed with written headlines. French and German dialogue is accompanied by subtitles; all of these are trappings which help to validate the narrative. The movie starts with a soundtrack from a Western that may get you in the mood for this serious fantasy.
 The scene is set mainly in occupied France in World War II, and you'll see Hitler, Goebells, and the rest of the top Nazi crew.
 Central to the the movie's storyline is Colonel Hans Landa, ""the Jew Hunter"" of the Nazi SS, played by Christopher Waltz who won an Oscar as best supporting actor. At the beginning of the story he is tracking down a Jewish woman, Shosanna, who is hiding out on a French dairy farm. She escapes and later takes over her aunt's art cinema in Paris. A German soldier, Fredrick Zoller, a hero sniper who has killed 350 of Germany's enemies, falls for her. Goebbels has made a propaganda film, ""The Nation's Pride"", retelling the soldier's exploits, and it's going to be shown in Shosanna's theater at the urging of Fredrick. All the German bigwigs will be at the premiere.
 Brad Pitt plays Lieutenant Aldo Raine (remember gravelly-voiced Aldo Ray, a movie star a few generations back) who is leading a squad of eight Jewish-American soldiers. They have been parachuted behind enemy lines, and are terrorizing, mutilating and scalping German troops, Apache style.
 An Italian movie with the same title was made in 1978. Are we really to take seriously a film in which the German actress and double agent is named Bridget von Hammersmark?
 Pitt and his gang are planning to blow up the cinema, but Shosanna is planning her own vengeance. The long scene in the tavern with the British implant and Bridget is suspenseful because we get the feeling that the Brit's German is going to give him away to the SS officer. The scene in which Landa matches a shoe to Bridget's foot is reminiscent of ""Cinderella"", but so devastatingly different in outcome.
 Sit back and let this movie captivate you and don't worry about historical accuracy. It's old-fashioned moviemaking magic at its best.",1273881600,2,2922,4.867203219315895
3954852,4,B002MZZMRM,"...which I've always been too lazy to do until now.  I'm not a QT fanboy - I've never seen any of his other movies - and I'm not a huge fan of Brad Pitt, either, but this is an extraordinarily memorable film. I have to respectfully disagree with those who say it's ""nothing but gore.""  There certainly are some gory moments and children have no business seeing this film.  Too, some parts are distractingly campy: the ""spaghetti western"" theme music that backs up some of the scenes, or the comic-book graphic that introduces a cut-away to the background of one of the ""Basterds"" come to mind.  The sporadic fits of ""camp"" and gore are why I only give it 4 stars, when it could have been 5.

Nevertheless, while those nits detract from the rest of the movie, it's still a worthwhile film.  In particular, the opening scene between the SS Colonel (played by Christoph Waltz) and the French dairy farmer (played by Denis Menochet) was magnificent.  Indeed, it makes this movie worth seeing all by itself.  It could be an Oscar-winning short all by itself. I have sometimes wondered whether I would have had the courage to hide Jews from the Nazi's during WWII, and why more people didn't.  But this scene.... My best description of the way Colonel Landa deals with Messr. LaPadite is ""chillingly amiable.""  It is truly horrifying without depicting gratuitous gore.  It was simply brilliant.

Ironically, given the title, the only scenes that I didn't completely enjoy 100% of the time were the ones with ""the Basterds"" (although I did like Brad Pitt's line about ""the worst thing about fighting in a basement....""  Also, his horrible Italian accent made me chuckle.)  As others have noted, and I consider it fortunate, most of the film is about other characters.  Indeed, the movie is really about Shoshanna Dreyfuss and her torment (deliberate and inadvertent) at the hands of the Nazis.  The scene between Colonel Landa (again!) and Emanuele/Shoshana is especially well done, and her reaction after Landa leaves was flawlessly played. It is their stories and the interplay of their characters that make this movie so very good.  See it!",1273708800,,2136,4.8402203856749315

3954856,5,B002MZZMRM,"INGLORIOUS BASTERDS

As any one can tell you I am a huge QT fan and basically own everything he has been a part of. So of course when this film was released I had to go see it and the second it was out on DVD/BLU-RAY I had to own it. I knew from the moment this film was announced that it would be another QT classic with out a doubt. Say what you will but it was a major success and you can't discount that at all. I of course knew that I would love this film and of course I did. Call me a Fanboy or what ever but I really did enjoy the film being a QT fan or not.

QT had been writing this film for years and was looking to make this one of his best films ever, I think he did just that. Yes there is another film by this name that QT is a big fan of but this is not the same film. I do however recommend seeing that film because it is another fun one. Any way this film has been in the works long before it was released and I think the time spent on it shows. And for those who have for some reason yet to see this film it is not just about that naughty group of American soldiers who go by the films title. No in fact it tells the story of a group of different people who some how or some way all get brought together some how at some point.

The film follows of course The Basterds lead by Lt. Aldo Raine [Pitt] in their quest to punish and destroy Nazis across the land. Along with Jewish American soldiers like the Bear Jew [Eli Roth] and even German recruits [you will love one guy]. But others like the brilliant Colonel Hans Landa aka the Jew Hunter [played wonderfully by Christoph Waltz] and Shosanna who later becomes Emmanuelle Mimieux [Mlanie Laurent]. Add in a film star named Bridget von Hammersmark [Diane Kruger] and a German war hero Frederick Zoller [Daniel Brhl] and you have a great film.

The film is basically told like a book kinda broke into 5 chapters each continuing the story and bringing them all together at the same time. The first one is set in 1941 while the rest take place in 1944, but rest assured nothing seems out of place at all with the time jump. The chapters are 1. Once Upon a Time in Nazi Occupied France, 2. Inglourious Basterds, 3. German Night in Paris, 4. Operation Kino, and the explosive 5. Revenge of the Giant Face. Every chapter in my opinion is absolutely perfect. The first one is the introduction of the Jew Hunter in one of the best scenes in the film followed by chapter two which is the introduction of The Basterds. The third one is were we catch up with Shosanna who is now Emmanuelle and her admirer war hero Frederick. Chapter four shows us the actress and her plan to infiltrate a planned Nazi gathering for a film premiere. And finally the grand finish which I will not ruin for those who have yet to see it, excellent.

Tarantino has always been known to have great dialogue in his films and this one follows suit, the film is with out a doubt a QT film. The direction is flawless in my humble opinion and how could it be anything less. The cinematography is beautiful and the score is excellent as well, the perfect film is coming together. But it is the performances here that really are great with every one doing a great job. Christoph Waltz is the show stealer as the Jew Hunter and rightfully won the Oscar for Supporting Actor. He is with out a doubt the best thing about this film from the acting stand point and that is really saying something.

Brad Pitt is absolutely hilarious in this film is probably the most fun one in the film with the accent and attitude he showcases in the film. All of the Basterds are excellent in this film as one would expect and that includes filmmaker Eli Roth as the Bear Jew. Mlanie Laurent and Diane Kruger are wonderful in the two female leads for the film as QT has always been able to write strong female characters. Each one is a totally different character with a different life and style but they are more the same then they seem. Martin Wuttke is excellent as Hitler and who could disagree with that, he is hilarious with his little hair bouncing up and down and flopping every were when he is mad.

Daniel Brhl is also very well cast in the film as a Nazi war hero turned actor who has a thing for Mlanie Laurent's character. These two are great together and deliver one of the best scenes in the film. Also August Diehl is great in the one scene he is in as a German officer who may or may not be on to our heroes. The fact is every one in this film from the smallest part to the biggest are excellent in this film. I would highly recommend this film especially if you like great acting. Also Lawrence Bender returns as the producer for QT, just one more reason to get this. Go but this film now it is worth much more than a rental. The two disc special edition has some wonderful features from behind the scenes to the film within the film [the war heroes' film]. gotta love that Mike Myers cameo.

Tarrantino's mastery went far beyond the violence, and confirmed once again he is a writer director with extraordinary skill.  The restraint Tarrantino exercised was a surprise and only made this film better.  Christoph Waltz (who won every award imaginable for this part) stole the film with his mesmerizing performance. Tarrantino used actors from Germany and French, which gave a gravity and believability to the film. Simply superb casting and fine, fine acting all the way around.  The only challenge I found with the film was reading the subtitles.

  - Hans Landa

""Inglourious Basterds"" is one of Quentin Tarantino's masterpieces, bar none. The film is brilliantly epic in every sense of the word.  I don't consider it a ""war movie"" at all, like some people do.  It could be considered a World War II movie since it features Hitler and the Nazis, but I still wouldn't call it exclusively that type of movie.  It's a wonderfully executed and artfully shot Tarantino shock drama.  THAT'S what it is, and it is done oh so well!

Christoph Waltz more than deserved the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Hans Landa, the Gestapo security chief. He's what made the movie. As for Brad Pitt's character, Aldo, he can get a little annoying at times with that ridiculous accent. I personally would've loved to see someone other than Pitt play that role.

True, there isn't as much gore in this film when you compare it to Quentin's other films, but his signature shock twists are right up there with the best of them. ""Inglourious"" definitely made it into my top 10 favorite movies of all time.

As far as the Blu Ray features are concerned, I personally thought that they should have included longer and more in-depth features, but that doesn't detract from my 5-star rating.  The picture quality is exceptional, and the audio is fantastic on 5.1 surround sound speakers.  The bullets literally shake your floor!  Don't even rent this movie...BUY IT!

Oh and yes, let me not forget...for you potential buyers, a glass of milk!",1272326400,,1552,4.678966789667896

3954861,5,B002MZZMRM,"but INGLORIOUS BASTERDS should have been deluged with golden statues.  Quentin Tarantino is one of these filmmakers who brings fresh air into Hollywood, and IB is a film that I love not so much for its subject as for its originality on so many levels.  Here is a filmmaker with a personal, extraordinary view on filmmaking, a man who uses the cinematic tools of storytelling to brew a daring cocktail that both entertains and leaves us thinking.  IB is visually great, wonderfully directed, provocative, strongly symbolic, deliciously naughty.  I like it because of its unique approach and high cinematic value.  And I don't understand why Hollywood didn't glorify its enfant terrible, which would have given proof of a permanent vitality.  Awards this film should definitely have won:  Best Original Screenplay, Best Picture, Best Directing, Best Cinematography (the final theater sequence is simply outstanding!).  Glorious and not to be missed, and image and sound on this BLU RAY are stunning!",1272240000,,997,5.226415094339623
3954862,5,B002MZZMRM,"The film starts with the introduction of two of the main characters who also happen to be the best actors: Colonel Hans Landa((Christoph Waltz) and Shosanna Dreyfus (Laurent) with the heading `once upon a time in Nazi-occupied France'. The firstimage opens upon a bucolic farm scene and sets the template for the rest of the film. A farmer with his 3 daughters, a spaghetti western theme arrives with the Nazis. Tarantino brilliantly captures the mounting tension with Landa's interrogation of the farmer over the dinner table. The subject of his mission is to find the missing Dreyfus family who are hidden beneath the floorboards. The farmer smokes a pipe and so does Landa(Sherlock Holmes style).The Nazi switches speaking from French to English and soon the farmer is forced into cheque mate, divulging the whereabouts of the family,who are shot through the floorboards,while Shosanna escapes.

We move on to a few years later to the Lieutenant Aldo Raine(Brad Pitt) and his troop of Basterds,Jewish soldiers about to engage in targeted acts of retribution e.g. to take100 scalps each and drive terror into the Nazis. They also have a handy way of marking survivors for life with a swastika carved in their forheads. They are parachuted behind enemy lines and proceed to ambush and murder Nazis. In their commandos is the `Jewish Bear'(Eli Roth) who despatches Nazis with a baseball bat to the head and body. Also they have a German who murdered Nazis in Germany, Stiglitz(Til Schweiger),a kind of Charles Bronson figure. Adolph Hitler is derpicted as a camp and ranting comic figure who stops survivors mentioning the Basterds.

The 3rd of 5 chapters shows Shosanna grown older and her cinema. She has a season of German films, Lubitsch and Pabst. The heroic private Fred Koller flirts with her and she is `invited' to a meal with Koller and Goebbels and his French mistress. They tell her they want to use her cinema to premiere the propaganda film Nation's Pride. She meets Landa in a strudel-eating scene in which the tension mounts unbearably. With her assistant and black boyfriend Marcel she hopes to ignite 35mm celluloid film stock while the Nazi elite are all watching the film. This will be her revenge,as Hitler,Goebbels,Bormann and Goering will all be attending.

The last two scenes are 40 minutes long each. The first called Operation Kino shows a German-speaking British soldier,Lieutenant Hicock(Fassbinder excellent),a film critic of German cinema,being informed by Brit General (Mike Myers) of a plan to blow up the German elite in the cinema. His undercover-agent will be a German actress, Bridget Von Hammarsmark(Kruger) and assists will be the Basterds. They will all meet in a tavern in Nadine, called La Louisianne, to find a way into the premiere. Hicock and two Basterds meet Bridget but there are Nazi privates present celebrating Willi's baby birth. They are pestered by Willi who sits with them and though they speak German he detects their accents are strange. They ask him to leave. An SS officer has a verbal duel with Hicock around a table like in a spaghetti western due to the suspicious accents with breath-taking suspense,leading to a shoot-out. Willi and Bridget survive(she wounded).There is a mexican stand-off as Aldo from upstairs bargains for Bridget. Aldo and 2 Basterds want to be escorts of Bridget to the premiere but they only speak a little Italian. Landa meanwhile finds the bodies and a female shoe and the missing person of the shoot-out is shown by her autograph to Willi on a napkin. This will lead to her death later.

The 2 revenge plots converge at Shosanna's theatre. There is a remarkable comic scene out of the Marx Brothers as Aldo and Co, answer in Italian. The theatre is the culmination of the mounting drama as the cinema becomes like Gotterdamerung going up in flames and the fleeing Nazis are machine-gunned. Aldo carves into Landa's forehead, after he surrenders,saying""this may well be my masterpiece"".The film is a revenge fantasy with extremely funny dialogue,set-piece scenes in a multiple story-line with the use of rock and roll music to pick up the pace. It plays fast and loose with history,using comic book characters and creative poetic license. It is not a Dirty Dozen action film,indeed it loses the Basterds quite soon. The female characters are well developed. Tarantino is back on form and we have missed his dialogue- driven films in stories written and directed by himself. Waltz's performance is scintillating as the sardonic,sly,charming,ruthless Nazi Colonel and will get awards.",1272153600,,4571,5.066401062416999
3954863,5,B002MZZMRM,"If you haven't seen ""Inglorious Basterds"" you really don't know what you're missing. It is as humorous and tongue in cheek as Tarantino can be and is a very insteresting retelling (a very inventive one, by the way) of the end of the second world war.

The photography in this picture is probably my favorite of all Tarantino movies to date, the colors and the sensations they give are simply wonderful. The same goes for the score. And to all this you could also add the fact that the performances in this piece are genius, specially for our friend Cristoph Waltz who plays the Col. Hans Landa, and for which he won an Oscar.

But this was too graphic and too violent for even a Nazi hater like myself (this was my grandpa's doing because he told me they were bad people, but can you blame him after fighting them in WW2). The acting was really enjoyable, but after some point another killing just becomes boring no matter how graphic is depicted. Pitt was great, as was the German actor. But the mashing of brains was just boring. I mean what can Tarantino do to shock anyone any more? More violence cannot get the job done, so this is a legit question, but this movie proves more is not better. Skip it and do some better with your time.",1271808000,5,702,4.246268656716418
3954866,5,B002MZZMRM,"The story begins in Nazi-occupied France, early in the war.  SS-Standartenfuhrer Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) arrives at an isolated dairy farm in the French countryside to very thoroughly do his job of hunting Jews.  (He has, thus far, done his job so well that he has earned the nickname ""The Jew Hunter""; he considers it a term of endearment, mentally counting the numbers who know him.)  Landa, in his cunning, skillful thinking he so prides himself in possessing suspects that the French landowner is sheltering Jews on his premises.  Actually, after a point, Landa considers himself, quite obviously and arrogantly, to know because, as he says, he thinks like those he hunts.  What a good Nazi he is!

The slow buildup of tension in the above scene is so perfect that I cannot imagine it being done better.  In just twenty minutes of mostly dialogue alone, Tarantino is able to build a sense of nail-biting suspense that few other directors could do after loads of superficial, frenetic action so typical in Hollywood.  (Christoph Waltz certainly deserves the Oscar he received for his performance as the SS officer, just within those first twenty minutes.)  To back up a bit, the tension begins as a car slowly winds its way up a country road toward its destination.  We know, as well as the landowner, that something bad is about to happen, not because we know the SS is coming, but because of the look and behavior of the landowner and his family.  It's real, it's developed, and nothing is left up to mere stereotypes.  (You would feel the dread, even if you knew nothing of the SS.)  SS-Standartenfuhrer Landa begins his visit to the French landowner very cordially and politely, speaking the most perfect French, and rivaling the most cultured aristocrat in his demeanor.  However, it's a thin faade that wears away, with calculation and charm, ending in a perfect boldness of wit and cruel sarcasm.  (In other words, he's actually a perfect Nazi!)  There's a scene with a pipe that places humor, most effectively, at a most ironic time, somehow making the suspense all the more suspenseful, after the laughing stops.  You'll know what I mean when you see it.  The pipe really can't be missed.

After a bloodbath at the dairy farm, a young Jewish woman named Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent) flees into the woods, thus ending Chapter One.  Shosanna forges a new life for herself in occupied Paris, and, of course, dispenses some much-deserved revenge in a later chapter.  Speaking of chapters, that's how this movie tells its story.  As one chapter ends, there is a black screen which neatly informs us of the next chapter beginning.  What a novel idea!

Chapter Two introduces us to ""The Basterds"" led by Brad Pitt, as Lt. Aldo Raine.  They are a group of ten men seriously set on killing ""Nazis"" (the a being pronounced as a short vowel, as in cat) Yes, Lt. Aldo Raine speaks with a strong Tennessee accent and battle-hardened slang, making an effective caricature of himself throughout the movie.  He tells his group of assassins that he expects no less than ""100 Nazi scalps"" from everyone, and he means it!  With the exception of Lt. Raine, the rest of the Basterds are Jewish, making all the revenge, regardless of how violent, all the more appropriate.  In order to exact their revenge and do their part in the war, the Basterds are parachuted behind enemy lines, surrounded by numerous, soon-to-be hairless ""Natzi"" victims.  Let's also say that the camera never shies away from scenes of basterd revenge.  So be prepared, since, as they say, ""A basterd's work is never done!""

In the following chapters (I think there are six in all), everyone links up, sooner or later, whether they know it or not, for a first or second time, with suspenseful dj-vu where appropriate.  (You don't want the people who tried to kill you earlier to recognize you later!)  What's also powerful is how Tarantino makes each of the characters in the film a perfect icon of whom or what they represent--again, Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine, the quintessential hero, and Christoph Waltz as the arch-nemesis Nazi.  Tarantino also does this most efficiently with the sultry, sexy heroine (Melanie Laurent) and a smoldering French actress/femme fatale (Diane Kruger).  The camera loves these women, and Tarantino gives us all the reasons to know why.  The lens glides over their curves, from one scene to the next, no matter how tense the moment, teasing the viewer with only just the right amount of information.

I could go on and on with this, but if I did I'd tell too much of a story that's better off seen than read about.  Other stars include the usual suspects--Hermann Goering, Joseph Goebbels, Martin Bormann, and yes, Adolf Hitler himself!  (If the real Hitler hadn't already done so well making a caricature of himself, I'd give the actor an Oscar for doing it for him.)  One great thing about this movie is that it rather faux-seriously depicts an alternate ending to the war unlike anything you might otherwise imagine.  So, in other words, the ending is not predictably as it really was, from what we already know, as is the case with most other such movies.  (As exciting and excellent as Valkyrie was, we already knew how it would end.)  The finale of Inglourious Basterds gives a much deserved comeuppance to everyone exactly as we all wish they had received it.  It's nearly over-the-top but believable retribution and overkill (literally) at Tarantino's finest!  Another great thing about Basterds lies in Tarantino's ability to push things as far as possible, without going over the edge of realism.  As over-the-top as it nearly gets at times, we never really think it couldn't have actually happened.

This is a war movie that isn't really about war.  It's a Nazi movie that's more about anti-Nazism than it is about anti-Semitism.  Depending on how sensitive you are, there are numerous things which could be offensive.  There is death, murder, war, torture, execution, copious amounts of blood, violence, and even a final fatally-attracted, autograph-singing German war hero/sniper.  Oh yes!  Did I mention that there is real humor, as well?  (Wait till you see the three basterds incognito as non-Italian-speaking Italian film critics!)  Of course, this is a Tarantino film!  What do you expect?

Again, as for the offensive things in this movie, relax.  They are really no more offensive than anything else you've seen before about a group of inglourious Nazi-scalping basterds who, more than coincidentally, happen to be Jewish.  So, set aside your hang-ups, morals, ethics, political correctness, and overblown virtues for a couple of hours, at least, and enjoy the story that never was, about a group of basterds that never were.  If you're like me, you'll even happily feel like a basterd in the end.",1271808000,,6824,4.888598781549173

3954871,4,B002MZZMRM,"Good movie with more strength than weakness.  The story is interesting and fun to follow and a lot of performances by unknown actors (to me at least) are better than that of the big names.  Pitt was fun at times, but didn't really cut it as a general - somehow he still seems too young and pop and I think even he was having a hard time believing his over the top accent.  While so many of the other actors in this World War II France put in believable top notch performances, I'd pop right out of the spell when Pitt and the gang came on though they occasionally added comic relief which may have been the point partly.  I agree with other reviews that call the Pitt factor a weak link in a film that almost could have been a masterpiece.  Still it's Tarrantino's style not to play it straight all the time, even amidst seriousness - the quirkiness that Pitt and his scalping crew brought to the movie sometimes did add an enjoyable fast food element.  And you know we love fast food but you don't confuse it for fine dining. This was a movie half sirloin, half hamburger - actually a formula that often produces success.  I just wonder how it would have been if they'd used different ""hamburger"".

Good work by many actors, supporting and otherwise, the film was suspenseful, fairly clever and finally quite entertaining.  Some of the best performances in this movie came from those playing Nazis - like a good mafia movie, there's so much tension beneath the pleasantries.  Both leading ladies were good as well.  This is the first Tarantino film I've seen since Pulp Fiction that I've felt half enthused about. While not perfect, it had an element that has long been missing from his films - substantial story and interesting characters.",1271203200,,1741,4.565916398713826

In that sense, this movie is very much a reincarnation of Pulp Fiction, although of course the details are all different.

This sort of movie can't possibly appeal to everyone, as the broad spectrum of previous reviews attests, but I personally found it highly entertaining and well worth the time.  Indeed, I was so gripped by this movie - frequently wanting to know what was going to happen next but rarely able to predict it - that the time just flew by and it felt like my attention didn't even lapse for a second.  True, some of the violence is hard to watch, but the movie's pervasive aura of humor subtly reminds us that this is make-believe stuff, so that helps to soften the blow (both figuratively and literally).  And of course humor is partly a matter of taste, but I personally found myself laughing out loud many times during this movie (Brad Pitt's character is the funniest in the movie, and I think he nails the role).

What are the general lessons from the movie?  I don't think this movie really has any serious aspirations in that direction, but every good movie still has such lessons in there somewhere, so here's my attempt to pull some out:

(a) Before harming someone, beware of the possibility of revenge which may far exceed your harm.

(b) Ideology can readily drive people to violence which they consider justified, along with willingness to die for a cause.

(c) Terrorism can be disproportionately effective, particularly with respect to undermining the morale of the enemy.

(d) Occupying a group of people is an inherently dangerous undertaking.

(e) People tend to vacillate between allegiance to their personal interest versus the groups to which they belong.

(f) History sometimes reaches sensitive points at which outcomes can be drastically changed by seemingly small events.

3954883,1,B002MZZMRM,"I have to say this movie was very disappointing. The film is essentially about nothing at all, other than a group of people trying to stop the Nazi takeover of Europe during WWII. Brad Pitt has a starring role as the goofy redneck Lt. Aldo Raine, who is leading a small platoon of Jewish-American soldiers whose mission is to kill as many Nazis as possible. They are ruthless and become something of legend amongst the Nazis, thus catching the attention of  ""Jew Hunter"" Col. Landa. The Basterds eventually intersect with some crazy revenge plot created by a Jewish cinema owner, who intends to burn the cinema to the ground with all the elite Nazi leaders inside including the big man himself Adolf Hitler (ummm, yeah... right).

Much like Kill Bill 1 & 2, Inglourious Basterds is a total detachment from reality and is very ""comic book like"" in nature. Tarantino rewrites history with this film, but I must ask what is the point exactly???

The performances by most of the leading actors are simply over the top when it comes to Hollywood refuse. Pitt's chracter, Lt. Raines, seems to come off as a macho dumbass redneck that is more concerned about killing, baseball batting, and ""branding"" Nazis than actually winning this so-called pesky war this story takes place in. It is almost like Brad Pitt was just plugged into this film and was asked to simply give a horrible performance--such as with his effort to make sure the audience knows (over and over again) Lt. Raines is from the south. Pitt's effort to pull off a southern accent is simply horrible and at times quite laughable which makes this otherwise good actor look like a total buffoon.

The cameo of Mike Myers as a British officer, really was a waste for this great comic actor.  As Austin Powers would say ""It's not my bag baby!""

However, I found Christoph Waltz, who plays Col. Landa, to be quite remarkable--Waltz is the epitome of a movie ""bad guy."" During the film you can't help but think: ""There is no way this guy ever had a mother!""

Tarantino attempted a few incredible moments within this film. One such moment is in the conclusion, when Shoshanna's (the cinema owner) face is projected on the billows of smoke from the burning theater... kudos. Unfortunately, it is part of this horrible film that is full of too much dialogue, subtitles, and meaningless long scenes.

A lot of Tarantino films are just a bunch of Hollywood film art that is simply about, well... nothing (reminds me of a Seinfeld episode) and Inglourious Basterds follows the same old Tarantino mold of tons of unnecessary dialogue, over the top violence, stupid characters, and a go nowhere storyline (not that one ever really exists).",1270166400,25,2683,4.767241379310345

3954885,5,B002MZZMRM,"I've been a fan of Quinton Tarantino's films, and ""Inglorious Basterds"" is one of his all-time best.  Clever, quirky, controversial, envelope-pushing - only Tarantino would have the guts to do a film ""reinterpretation"" of WWII.

Brad Pitt is funny as heck as the leader to the group of Jewish-American soldiers, ""the Basterds,"" on a mission to kill and scalp any and every Nazi solder they find (not to mention taking a baseball bat to the skulls of captured Nazis who refuse to spill the beans), while giving those whose lives are sparred a little ""souvenir.""  Tarantino hit the mother load casting Austrian actor Christolph Waltz as the Nazi ""Jew Hunter"" Hans Landa.

3954890,4,B002MZZMRM,"The opening scene in this movie was brilliant and must not be missed.
The story is about a Jewish girl who escapes the Germans as they massacre her family.
The movie is a fictionalized version of what could have happened had a Jewish army unit had entered France with the sole intent of killing as many Nazis as possible and finally succeeding in ending the war, when they end up blowing up a theater, which is now owned by the Jewish girl who had escaped, in which the entire top leadership of the Third Reich has assembled to watch a propaganda film.
The film, although long is laid out in easy chapters like a book. Tarantino uses wonderful and complex dialogue to guide the film. I loved the exchange of words in the first scene between the French farmer and the Nazi officer SS Hans Landa ( Christoph Waltz) .The action is minimal but at times is very gruesome and bloody. The costumes are splendid and the locations are spectacular as well. Brad Pitt plays his part well and is ably supported by all the basterds. Mike Myers is in a tiny role as a British officer and I feel that he was wasted.
I felt that the highlights of the film were the opening scene, the shootout at the tavern, and the wonderful just ending. If I were to watch the film in a movie theater it would be to see Christoph Waltz who is simply brilliant as the shrewd, chilling, sinister, opportunist and always on the alert SS officer Hans Landa. I had never seen him perform before but this could easily be the best portrayal of evil in recent times. He alone is the worth the price of the ticket and popcorn and cannot imagine this movie without him in it. I liked the movie and I gave it four stars. 3/28/10",1269820800,,1686,4.355555555555555

The plot was ill-conceived and simply not believable. That the Nazi High Command, including Hitler himself, would all go see a movie in occupied France only to be trapped by a band of vigilante Jewish commandos is almost as fatuous as their all going on a sleigh ride on the Eastern Front and becoming transvestite communists.

And while there clearly were contrived elements of / references to the Spaghetti Western in the movie- if this is Tarantino's ""homage"" to the genre he misfired entirely. But beyond being unbelievable, the movie was simply boring. We've always known Quentin was different, and capable of flashes of brilliance (I refer to the 2 movies mentioned above), but it would seem this self-proclaimed genius has finally split from the program. The only 2 good things I can say about this movie are: it wasn't as bad as From Dusk Till Dawn and the characters played by Brad Pitt and the German guy (whose name escapes me) were mildly entertaining.

Way, way too talky, many scenes go on much too long, and I was often bored.  What I DID like are the European actors, all excellent.  The violence didn't bother me that much but the squeamish might want to steer clear.  I admire some of Tarantino's work - Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill I particularly - but this piece is poorly paced and the parts don't add up to a unified whole.  Brad Pitt and his cohorts seemed to be from a different movie altogether and the American actors seem like amateurs compared to the Europeans (particularly Christoph Waltz and Michael Fassbender, both very impressive here).  I wanted to like the film a lot more than I did.  I think Tarantino needs to be reined in a bit - it seems like he's a little too fond of his own dialogue.

The ad campaign for this movie was extremely misleading. In the TV ads the only scenes they showed were the ones with the ""Basterds"".  I was surprised that 80% of the dialogue was subtitled, and I agree with one reviewer here that the subtitles raced by awfully quickly at times.  I realize that if they had marketed it with Christoph Waltz as the main figure in the advertisement poster, people might have avoided the film because they wouldn't necessarily know who he was, but come ON!  Brad Pitt is in such a tiny portion of the movie.  Ridiculous.  I'm glad I didn't see this in the theater.

The only part of this movie that I did enjoy was the part played by Diane Kruger (Troy)and the twist of her character's appearance.

3954898,5,B002MZZMRM,"I'm thankful the Basterds at least won one oscar.  Christoph Waltz is a phenomenal actor, and his performance never gets old as I watch the film over and over. He won best supporting actor for this role in 2009, and without him in the film, I doubt the Oscars would be paying so much attention to this flick.  Inglorious Basterds does not top Tarantino's previous films, but it sure does come damn close.  It definately surpassed his most recent films, being Kill Bill and Death Proof.  This movie sits nearly neck and neck with Pulp Fiction, because it's an instant classic of the Tarantino brand.

This was a script he took a lot more of his careful time with.  I felt gratified that I waited so long for another film of his, because he put all that time to good use.  He created an original story that does not follow any guidelines or traditions.  Basterds is incredibly intelligent but at the same time it's horrifying.  It's as if Tarintino's statement is, no one tells me what to do.  Brad Pitt gave us a role that makes Tyler Durden go unnoticed.  I was proud to see him show what acting really is, and how much Hollywood never really acts.  Along with Pitt, all the actors are amazing in this film.  With a Tarantino script and A-Grade actors, nothing can go wrong with this film.

However, some have criticized the film for various reasons.  They claim there's major innaccuracies, but I don't believe Tarantino made much of an effort to be accurate rather than tell a story.  Inglorious Basterds is not a History film, it's just a great story and that's all I can really say.  The violence I somewhat agree with.  It doesn't bother me, but I think Tarantino could have had more luck at the Oscars if he left it out.  I think Eli Roth has a little too much influence over him, and their type of gore really does not have much value in terms of filmmaking tools.  It was a little interesting, and made it feel barely realistic, but at the same time it felt extremely out of place with all the talent flowing.

The Blu-ray release is ok.  The special features felt a little short but sweet.  There's no commentary, which is a little bit of a letdown.  They did not add in U-Control to this Universal disc to my delight, but they did throw in a slew of Live Features, which I wonder if anyones really using.  As far as a blu-ray disc goes, the package gets a 3.5/5.  As far as how good the film is, I always skip hesitating and say it's a 5/5.",1269216000,,2450,4.388888888888889

3954900,1,B002MZZMRM,"I would never have gone to see this movie had it not been at a friend's behest on a dull Friday night. I got what I expected, and therefore - I suppose - what I deserved.

The inexplicably misspelled ""Inglourious Basterds"" is an adaptation of a comic book. This World War II tale concerns an American Lieutenant (Brad Pitt) leading a group of Jewish commandos to carry out reprisals against German soldiers in occupied France. A para-plot follows Shosanna (played by Melanie Laurent), the sole survivor of the Nazi massacre of her family, plotting to burn down a cinema while the entire German high command are in it. Her scheme overlaps with that of Pitt's.

This is a movie which has obvious bad guys and obvious good guys: Nazis on the one hand; and the Jewish/French resistance on the other. Yet the most revolting violence in the film (which occasioned gasps of revulsion from the audience I was in) is not perpetrated by the Nazis, but by the people whom we were supposed to be cheering for. It is a testament to how morally garbled this film is that the most memorable scene in it has the 'Bear Jew' (Eli Roth) literally smashing a German officer's skull to pieces with a baseball bat and triumphantly screaming out that he's ""knocked it right out the f***ing park"" while fellow Jews stand around laughing and applauding. Stop me if I'm wrong, but isn't that the kind of thing the Nazis used to do? It seems that Tarantino was in such a stampede to get some gore on screen that he didn't notice his heroes descending to the level of his villains. (The dispatched officer is never seen doing anything we might feel obliged to hate him for.) Using music and overlong suspense, the scene is stylised in the manner of a gunfight, yet the German soldier is unarmed and on his knees throughout. Is this how we want to remember the Nazis?

Eli Roth is a friend of Tarantino's, whose cinematic oeuvre has no theme, just recurring violence. Roth has confessed - without any irony - that when he floated the idea for his movie ""Hostel"", Tarantino exclaimed that this was the sickest thing he had ever heard, before adding: ""You have *got* to make that film!"" Roth went on to make Hostel II. When confronted with the movie's box office failure, he blamed it on video piracy. When confronted with the movie's critical failure, he explained that he only cares about fans, not critics. (Translation: I only listen to people who *like* my films.) It is therefore entire natural that Roth and Tarantino should club together to produce an immature, sweepingly self-indulgent gore-fest. Their partnership is a boyhood friendship formed between adults. Would you have picked this pair to produce a level-headed film about Jewish suffering under the Nazis?

Brad Pitt's performance was - to use an industry term - phoned in. But of course - for reasons outlined above - the line was bad before he even started, so it's not entirely his fault. It is very rare in even a mediocre motion picture for the audience to see the mask slip and suddenly be made aware that they are just looking at some guy acting. Yet I saw this happen about twice with Pitt in this film. Plainly he didn't believe in what he was doing. So why should we?

The opening scene - which centres bafflingly around milk - is far too long: and the suspense, though present, is overwrought. When Michael Cimino made the universally execrated ""Heaven's Gate"", the critic Danny Peary remarked that the director obviously thought that everything he had filmed was too precious to cut. Plainly Tarantino - who was once nicknamed ""The Ego has Landed"" by an Irish critic - suffers from the same kind of galloping self-regard.

There is one redeeming feature in this mess of a film. And that is the superb European cast. The supporting performers Melanie Laurent, Daniel Bruhl, Diane Kruger, Michael Fassbender, August Diehl and Christoph Waltz (who took the Oscar) are all polyglot thesps who can really shine. So much so, in fact, that they completely outshine the American actors (and the myriad mistakes in the film itself). This is painfully symbolised in the scene in the cinema lobby in which Waltz encounters Pitt, who is trying to pass as an Italian while equipped with little more than 'Bonjourno'. As Waltz (who in real life can speak Italian, German, English and French) launches into a conversation with Kruger in fluent Italian, Pitt just has to stand there with a pained and stupid expression on his face. It is a symbol of all that has gone before: a world-famous but monoglot American movie star reduced to haplessness when surrounded by multi-lingual (and thus multi-talented) European unknowns. Fame truly counts for nought.",1269129600,82,4688,4.760147601476015

I also liked the way all this people talks in different languages and how this mingles into the story. I didn't mind the violence and I think that adds to the film rich plot. It was dissapointing to see that this excellent film just won one oscar when it deserved best picture, director and screenplay. Of course Cristoph Waltz was brilliant as Hans Landa and he deserved every award that won. Inglourious Basterds is now one of my favorite films and definetely the best of 2009 (alonside with Up).

Caution: Might Be A Spoiler Review.

Movie Cons:
1) If you don't like really violent scenes, I'd suggest fast-forwarding through them.  They're a bit much, in my opinion.  I get that it's a Q.T. film but it's always just above and beyond gross.
2) If you go cross-eyes reading subtitles, this may be really challenging.
3) If you have issues with violence towards women, this may bother you.
4) Man, does it twist with WW2 history. Big time.  And it is so off with the time-line of early June 1944.
5) A major plot development is never fully explained.  How DOES she end up with that movie theater anyway?

Pros:
1)Those caveats aside, this is a really well done film, beautifully shot.  Lighting and scenes, set dressing, costumes etc. are really outstanding.  I believe they may have made one mistake with the British officer's uniform but that's a small detail.  I liked the pacing of the film especially.  It really is a character study with adventure and gore thrown in.

2) Christoph Waltz as Col. Landa is simply amazing!!  He is so charmingly creepy that I felt like I was being ensnared, undressed and hung out to dry in a slime pit.  The first scene is so taut that I had to stop the DVD and breath a bit.  You know it's NOT going to end nicely but still, I was riveted.  It wasn't over-paced either. Perfect.  Funny thing is, I felt watching Mr. Waltz' performance that he probably is a great guy in ""real"" life.  I'd put him down as one of the great film villains!

3) Brad Pitt is handsome and wise-cracking with an accent you could cut concrete with.  I'm not a fan of his but he was great!

4) The two lead females are talented and gorgeous.  If you wonder why Diane Kruger looks familiar, she was in the National Treasure movies. And she must speak a bunch of languages because her accents (to me) were excellent!

5) If you're multi-lingual and want to brush up on your French, German and Italian, it's great practice!

6) The casting is brilliant, well-done!

This is one he's been working on for over a decade, refining the script to create his ultimate masterpiece that he was hoping would match the perfection of Pulp Fiction. This sincerely did not disappoint and the wait made it even more special when I got my chance to see it for the first time. Tarantino is sincerely a master of cinema and although some of his more recent films, amongst critics, are generally hit and miss, this is genuinely a masterpiece and displays the man's ability on top form once again.

The story unfolds over 5 chapters: Once upon a time... In Nazi occupied France; Inglourious Basterds; A German Night in Paris; Operation Kino and Revenge of the Giant Face. It tells of two separate plots to assassinate Hitler at the same time and place. On the one side we have Emmanuelle Mimieux, a cinema owner with revenge in her heart as her previous name was Shoshanna Dreyfus and she is the only surviving member of her family who were murdered by SS Colonel Hans Landa. The other side focuses on a group lead by Lieutenant Aldo Raine known as the Basterds are a group of Nazi killers who just enjoy killing Nazi's until they find out about a plan to hold a propaganda film premiere in the cinema owned by Emanuelle in which the Fuehrer will be in attendance. This group of Nazi killers are determined to kill the head Nazi, but the question is, will they even get close to their goal?

One of Tarantino's main talents is that he has an ear for intense dialogue and can create a lengthy scene which has only that and allow the viewer to be gripped throughout. This is not different as the dialogue in this film is intense and filled with dynamic mood changes and superb acting. Sure, the fact that the dialogue is heavy with subtitles, they work in setting an authentic mood and rather than having the actors play Germans or Frenchmen talking to their fellow countrymen in American accents which would diminish the mood entirely, I personally preferred the subtitles. The first scene of the movie I see it as acknowledging this possibility of subtitle overkill by having Colonel Landa request that the opposing character Perrier LaPadite switch to English as his French was exhausted. Although there was a plot justification for this switch, it was a clever and I found it to be quite a humorous aspect.

The acting is sublime, it really is. There are moments when it is slightly camp and the stereotypical traits are a bit over -exaggerated but they add a little relief to what is quite an intense film throughout. The cast are well fitted to their roles, especially Christopher Waltz as ""The Jew Hunter"" Hans Landa and Brad Pitt as Aldo ""The Apache"" Raine. They are both comically and seriously believable in their own right and add a lot to the film individually. The talk that Waltz should gain an academy award for his role in this film is well deserved and I pray he receives that nomination and ultimately the award. The supporting cast members such as Eli Roth, Mike Myers, Diane Kruger, Melanie Laurent and Martin Wuttke add their own individual flairs to the film to make it a genuinely pleasant experience.

There is also certainly a western movie style influence with the film and you know it's a Tarantino film the minute it begins. He has an individuality with his films that allows you to notice instantly that he had a hand in putting this masterpiece together. This is definitely an Oscar worthy film that I would strongly recommend to anybody with an ounce of respect for truly marvellous film making. For the HD fans there are the elements that take advantage of this, especially with the beautifully vibrant scenery. So get it, you will not be disappointed.",1268092800,2,3865,4.637956204379562

3954925,5,B002MZZMRM,"There are very few filmmakers that can be called true genius, i.e., De Sica, Fellini, Kazan, Houston, Leone, Wertmuller, Kubrik, Pechinpah, Woo, Tarantino, Cameron, Emmerich, Scott brothers, Bay, Zwick, Allan, Stone, all masters of their craft. A great fan of Tarantino, I expected to be entertained and I was, even thrilled by this action-suspense-fantasy which God only knows every Jew wishes had been the truth. It's well documented that after WWII, members of the Jewish Brigade made up of fearless Palestinian Jews who served in the British army in Italy, tracked down Nazis and killed them, and Israel managed to grab Eichmann and execute him after a lengthy trial, but most Nazis, indluding the Angel of Death Dr. Mengele got away with their crimes, so in the least this film gave those who suffered at the hands of the Nazis some emotional satisfaction.

Historically in Hollywood, Jews have been portrayed as weaklings, ugly, big-nosed, bookish, nerdy, fat, ugly, and greedy. But with the emergence of Israel and its kick-ass army, the image of the Jew is changing as evidenced by Tarantino's film, Munich, and Defiance. There are many American-Jewish heroes that unfortunately the public is unaware of, i.e, one of America's best tank commanders, General Maurice Rose who commanded the 1st Armored Division in Europe, and General Mark Clark were Jews, and who can forget the great Sandy Kaufax, the Dogers strike out king, or handsome gangster Bugsy. During WWI, the greatest ace fighter pilots of the German airforce were Jews, known as Knights of The Sky, and today very few fighter pilots can match the brilliance of Israel's Top Guns, and Israel's vaunted commandos, paratroopers, tank commanders, i.e., Kahalani, Raful, Sharon, Natanyahu, Barak. Furthermore, it's no secret that as many as 50% of all the actors and actresses in Hollywood are Jewish (see famous Jews of Hollywood on YouTube), and are mostly very handsome and beautiful, yet they play mostly non-Jewish characters. When casting Jewish characters (with very few exceptions, i.e., The Young Lions, Tobruk, Porky's, Independance Day, Munich, Defiance, German Oscar winner Nowhere In Africa, Israeli Oscar nominated Ajami, etc.), Hollywood casting directors and shameless ignorant producers seek out and cast the ugliest people alive, often played by non-Jews. Other than the anti-semitic definition, there is no such thing as ""Jewish looking"". With the exception of the Eastern European and Middle Eastern ultra-orthodox, Jews can easily blend in anywhere. Eli Cohen, who looked like Omar Sharif, was an Israeli spy who was days from being named Defense Minister of Syria when he was caught. First mayor of Montery California was a Jewish Conquistador. Ashkenazi Jews have European features, and the Sephardi (Spanish, Middle-Eastern origina) Jews look like Arabs (or their desert warrior biblical forefathers). Put a Palestinian Arab next to an Israeli whose family may have originated in Iraq or Morroco and one cannot distinguish the difference. And then of course there are the beautiful black Ethiopian Jews (and American Hebrews who settled in the city of Arad near Beersheba) and dark skinned, Yemen born Jews. In Israel they inter-marry resulting in an exceedingly handsome and beautiful stock of Jews.

Inglourious Bastards is a pure adrenalin-rush Tarantino film, which means excellent story-telling, excellent character development through great dialogue, terrific characterizations and excellent perfomances, off-the-wall humor, tremendous over the top cold-blooded comic book violence, and perfect pacing as he throws in a good measure of the-edge-of-your-seat suspense. I've seen True Romance, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Kill Bill I & II numerous times, and I LOVED this movie, and as indicated by it's world wide gross of $333 million it's a major hit, not only in the US but all over the world. It's a must see.

Lastly, it took a non-Jew to make a positive film about heroic Jews. When will the Hollywood and Israeli Jews start making films that project the Jews as they are, viril, tough, good-looking, smart, sexy, and as proven by Israel, great warriors?",1267920000,,4153,5.298937784522003

3954928,5,B002MZZMRM,"A restrained Tarintino is a beautiful thing (although an unrestrained one is pretty great too).  This movie was brilliant!  Each character was meticulously performed by great actors (although I'm not sure if Brad Pitt's accent was off on purpose or not...).  I know there was a 1970s exploitation film entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Inglorious-Bastards/dp/B00140PKCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Inglorious Bastards</a>&nbsp;that served as an inspiration but the plots are no where close.

Here's an interesting premise on WWII - what if there was an elite American assassination squad made up of Jews who hunted down Nazis.  These men are to be feared.  Tarintino used restrained scenes of violence (compared to his other movies) that make it all the more shocking.  I closed my eyes for the scalping. So here you have this group of men pitted against the whole german army and one specifically, Landa or The Jew Hunter.  Landa is brilliantly played by Christoph Waltz who is up for an Oscar for this role and deserves one.  I tensed whenever he appeared on screen.  Bo Svenson, a star of the original Inglorious Bastards, has a part which is a nice nod from Tarintino.  Each character is magnificently acted no matter how small which helps make this movie shine.  Whoever casted this movie deserves lots of credit.  There are a few scenes with subtitles but don't let it scare you away.

The movie is very suspenseful, the humor is droll and the plot zips along.  One of the best things for me?  The ending was very fitting.  I hate watching a great movie only to see it crumble at the end.  There was a cheesy moment (Soshanna and the hero in the screening room) but it was easily forgotten under the barrage of fascinating film making.

3954929,4,B002MZZMRM,"Quentin Tarantino has been working on this World War II script for many years, and what is ostensibly a revenge film with moments of terrific dialogue and parallel subplots is a bit undone with untidy displays of violence and a fantasy denouement.  Nevertheless, the play is the thing and few writer/directors could fashion such an entertaining if mean spirited film like Inglourious Basterds with bravura performances particularly by Christoph Waltz as a most charming and lethal Nazi.

Once upon a time during World War II a French man is questioned about the whereabouts of local French Jews by a polite German SS officer, Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) whose silky, sinister approach gets remarkable, deadly results from which one teenage French girl barely escapes.

Next we meet Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt giving a Chad Everett by way of Clark Gable impression) who has recruited Jewish soldiers to hunt down and terrorize the Nazis in an Apache Indian way.  Any survivors do not escape unscathed but have a Swastika cross carved into their foreheads, their mark for life.

In 1944, a young French woman, Emmanuelle, owns a movie theater and is wooed by a German war hero, Fredrick, whose  film, Nation's Pride, is premiering in Paris.  Fredrick gets Joseph Goebbels, head of German Propaganda to move the premiere to Emmanuelle's smaller theater.  She is in fact the young French girl (Shosanna) who escaped a massacre and is plotting to take revenge by killing all the Nazi attendees.

At the same time, British Lt. Archie Hicox is sent to meet a double agent in France and, with Raine's men, attend the Nation's Pride premiere to blowup the theater and kill high level Nazis including Hitler.  Hicox meets the agent who is a famous German actress, Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger is glamorous) in a basement cafe.  German soldiers and an SS officer complicate things, and a Mexican standoff ensues with explosive results.  Having to alter plans, Raine substitutes himself and the surviving Basterds into the mission.

At the premiere, as head of security, Col. Landa discovers the Allied plot, and Raine is arrested and interrogated in another building.  There, Landa makes a startling proposal even as Emmanuelle plots to ignite the film nitrate stored in her theater and the other `basterds' in the audience execute their part of the plan.  Seemingly spared the finale at the theater and having manipulated his own fate, Col. Landa and Lt. Raine have a day of reckoning.

The usual Tarantino touches are here including excruciating scenes with gunshots, scalpings, stabbings, and bat beatings.  The film is structured in five chapters, and his love for movies is evident in references to German cinema icons, and, no doubt, major filmic influences from The Dirty Dozen (especially in the recruitment scene and the high octane finale), Where Eagles Dare, and any number of spaghetti westerns.  Imaginative use is made of fluid camera movement and rapid edits.

While the cast is in fine form with Til Schweiger as a Charles Bronson-type, director Eli Roth as the Bear Jew, and M&eacute;lanie Laurent,  radiant as the haunted Emmanuelle, the standout is Waltz.  Pitt is a hoot as Raine (whose name is a play on actor Aldo Ray), and when he tries to spout Italian phrases, it is outrageous.  Veteran Rod Taylor and comedian Mike Myers have fleeting cameos.

Some criticism of the film is warranted.  Infamous figures get killed at the premiere; if you are going to rewrite history even in a fable, don't take something that is so ingrained as to make an utter mockery of it.  Also, any sympathetic characters pretty much go out the window, so don't get too attached to anyone.

No Tarantino film would be complete without wonderfully written set pieces especially the one in the basement caf&eacute; that is very reminiscent of the final standoff in Reservoir Dogs.  While his words are sublime and he is adept at setting up such scenes, he does not take full advantage of the possibilities of others which are given relatively short shrift like the arrest of Raine and the confrontation of Bridget by Col. Landa.

For fans of the talented director, this one is a must, but for the average moviegoer, the snappy screenplay may not be fully appreciated in the overall context of an entertaining story that drips a bit too much blood. Two things are for sure: A glass of milk will never seem the same again, and Brad Pitt looks fabulous in a white tuxedo.",1267747200,2,4472,4.926666666666667

2.  Interesting Villains:  Tarantino's film got a lot of good press in Germany, mostly because it portrays Germans and Nazi in a much more sympathetic way then we have seen.  We see men conflicted by killing, unwilling to save their own lives to compromise others.  As for the primary villain although his own evil is established early he is portrayed more as a German Holmens than a simple Nazi slaying Jews.

3.  Violent Heroes:  The Americans in this movie are very violent as are their allies, they are Jews getting revenge and they aren't shy about getting it.

4.  Offbeat comedy:  A lot of what happens is presented in a comical fashion.  You will find yourself laughing at times that will surprise you.

The tightly wound plot revolves around three key figures: Colonel Hans Landa, an elegant, seemingly bloodless Nazi officer known as ""The Jew Hunter""; Lt. Aldo Raine, a Tennessee-born resistance fighter who has organized a special squad of Jewish-American soldiers whose goal is scalping and killing Nazis; and Emmanuelle Mimieux (ne Shosanna Dreyfus), a pensive young Jewish woman who runs a movie theater in Paris.

As presented by Tarantino over the course of five discrete chapters, the three disparate figures converge upon Mimieux's theater for the premiere of a Nazi propaganda film called ""A Nation's Pride"". There in attendance is to be not only Third Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels but also the Fuehrer himself. Needless to say, the filmmaker has carefully set up all his chess pieces for a flamboyant finale that represents a manifestation of some kind of crude moral justice that revisionist history allows only grand storytellers like Tarantino. Riddled with quirky incongruities, some of which border a bit too closely to self-parody, his signature style is evident through a series of set pieces, most heavy on insinuating dialogue, that suddenly explode like the tavern mle in La Louisiane.

In a turnabout from his Oscar-baiting performance last year as the passive Benjamin Button, Brad Pitt brings cocksure arrogance to Raine in an enjoyably hammy turn. Mlanie Laurent perfectly captures Shosanna's simmering resentment until her cathartic release during the explosive conclusion, while Diane Kruger cuts a somewhat more predictable figure as a Dietrich-like femme fatale actress in cahoots with Raine's battalion. Tarantino fills smaller roles with oddball choices like Mike Myers as a pip-pip British general, Rod Taylor (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Birds/dp/0783240236/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Birds</a>) as Churchill, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hostel/dp/B000EHRVP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hostel</a>&nbsp;director Eli Roth as a baseball bat-wielding Nazi killer. Regardless, the best work comes from Christoph Waltz's nuanced turn as the sadistic Landa. It's a masterfully subtle performance amid a movie that is anything but subtle.

Waltz's best scene comes right at the beginning with his unbearably tense conversation with a stoic French farmer suspected of hiding a family of Jews. There is also glorious camerawork from veteran cinematographer Robert Richardson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JFK/dp/B0000CDL93/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JFK</a>).

Tarantino is famous for his allusions to other movies, but here it works against him, highlighting this movie failure to incorporate any of the things that made those movies worth remembering.

The story is something that you might expect from a group of 14-16 year old boys goofing around shouting out plot ideas, each trying to be more outrageous.

Many reviews talk about the elongated scenes creating a sense of tension.  For me, it just dragged things out long past the point of caring what might happen.  And that ""caring"" was purely curiosity--the characters were too indistinct or cartoonish to warrant any emotional investment.

The initial ""chapter"" is much discussed in various reviews as masterfully building suspense in the interrogation of the farmer.  But for anyone who has watched an interrogation scene in a competent police procedural on TV, this plays as incredibly false: Totally absent is the critical portion of the ""dance"", the sequence where the subject is entrapped by his own explanations.  And the demonstration of the brilliance and special talents of ""The Jew Hunter""? Apparently, other Germans wouldn't think to look in the large, glaringly obvious crawl space under the house.

If you watch this for anything other than the technical skill of the individual shots, be prepared to constantly mutter ""Stupid"" and ""Preposterous"" and ""Lame"", but mostly ""Get on with it already!""

Addendum (4/29/2010): Be aware that the sadistic war criminals in this movie are the Americans (the title characters).  In contrast, the German colonel (C. Waltz) comes across more as the ""banality of evil"", amorally performing his assignments more because he finds them intellectually stimulating than because of his antisemitism.  Although Tarantino movies often have psychopaths and other evil characters as leads, this situation came as a surprise to various viewers I know.",1267488000,77,2616,5.175771971496437

3954940,4,B002MZZMRM,"I bought this Blu Ray set some time ago, but I wanted to forget the wide range of reviews I had read before seeing it. 'Inglorious Barsterds' is a very good film and I think Tarantino fans should especially like it. I think my biggest gripe with this film is the subtitles. It's not that I can't deal with them, but having scenes with long dialogue with so many written words at the bottom of the screen, was overall distracting and kept me from watching the scene. I know why the subtitles are used, but I think they could have used some clever ideas like in the first scene to break it up a little. I may not be the fasted reader on the planet, but I can hold my own. If you're watching this film, you had better be prepared to keep your eyes glues to the screen and don't even think of looking away to grab some popcorn for a second or you may lose some vital information. I know some lines were so long I could barely finish reading before I had another paragraph to read!

Aside from the subtitles I think the film is beautifully shot and the acting by all is excellent. I enjoyed the story even though those ""Basterds"" aren't in the film as much as I would have liked them to be. I know some thought the length of the film was a bit long, but I really think the massive subtitling made it feel long. If I want to read a book, I'll read a book but when I watch a film I want to watch the actors expressions and actions. This film has so much subtitling that you can't really do that ,.....for those of you that can read a paragraph in a millisecond...my hat's off to you, but I think this film would have been better received by all, if they had found a way to switch to English more often. One of the joys of watching Tarantino films is to listen to his wonderful dialogue, not necessarily read it. Films like Schindler's List certainly didn't suffer from not using subtitles and I don't think this film would have either.

It takes incredible liberties with the truth and has no basis in fact. It's attempt to appear artsy-fartsy is merely boring and out of place like a aria in a comic book.

Never in the long history of war movies has there been a bigger piece of crap.

When the great WWII movies are discussed like the Battle of Britain, the Longest Day, In Harms Way, Patton, A Bridge Too Far- this film deserves no mention because it is not great OR even true.

It's not great. It's not even mediocre. It's an exploitation piece shot to make money with a big name cast (who should be ashamed of themselves) a substandard script and a director with delusions of adequacy.

Don't waste your time or money on someone's fantasy of what WWII was like.

Go with what really is great and true. The Germans were a dangerous enemy because they were smart, professional soldiers. By making them into blundering idiots cheapens a victory that a lot of people paid the ultimate price to win.",1267142400,41,1098,4.52020202020202

If the movie were entertaining and it wasn't all talking at a table, it would make up for the fact that it is a joke insult to good WWII movies like Saving Private Ryan. Unfortunately it is a boring joke. I wasted my money buying this movie outright.

Tarantino has obviously made some fine films (""Pulp Fiction"" might even be great).  But his monstrous ego appears to have led him to believe that he is to filmmaking what Bob Feller was to pitching, when he's actually more like Dick Radatz.  Radatz had a few good seasons for the Red Sox, and could throw hard, but he didn't last.  Unlike Radatz, however,  Tarantino doesn't seem to realize that being on the mound in a well-tailored uniform is not the same as pitching a good game.

A better medium for ""Inglourious Basterds"" would have been a comic book.",1267056000,3,752,4.567164179104478
3954947,4,B002MZZMRM,"The biggest spoiler about this movie isn't a spoiler.  It's by Quentin Tarantino.  Not much more really needs to be said.  My only real surprise was not experiencing something I've always liked,  his usual (if egotistical) habit of inserting himself into his movies in either bit parts or staring roles.

The star of this is Brad Pitt.  Not that there aren't plenty of other stars, that is, lead actors and actresses, what with the number of main/major characters.  That would properly be Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz and Mlanie Laurent.  But Pitt is the only ""big star"" (at least to most American viewers ) that is on screen for more than a couple of minutes.  There is a cameo appearance by Mike Myers, who actually behaves mostly like a normal person.

Most of this movie is pretty unsurprising.  While a few things unfold not quite exactly in the way you'd expect, such as somebody getting grabbed you thought would be shot, or vice versa.  But when things do happen, pretty much what you'd think would happen is what happens. Or you ""get it"" very soon afterwards.

So this Spaghetti Western that just happens to be in occupied France has Brad Pitt acting like some sort of amalgamated stereotypical caricature of a bunch of people and characters at once, but in a unique way that works.  Some of the film plays a little oddly, but that's what makes things so charming.  You hardly even notice the on-screen type pointing out the names of the high ranking officials for example.  The movie is exceptionally well put together, so much so that you don't really notice some of the highly improbably actions, reactions and behaviors.  Although you will wonder about the why some of the things the characters do, or are allowed to do.  For example,  killing another certain specific character in a certain way or walking about wherever they please doing mostly what they want to.

There are only really two sticking points to this movie.  Although they by and large work out, and in many ways give the movie its flavor and charm, still.

First, while most all of the characters are compelling in some way, some are nothing but cardboard cutouts, many are simply there, and none of the main ones are really much sympathetic.  Everyone does at least one thing that's not very nice, to say the least.

Second, Tarantino once again proves that's he's a master at pacing.  An inconsistent excessive overload of rather annoying pacing.  The problem there is he can't quite decide when he's going far far far too slowly for far far far too long.  Couple this with the break after that, mostly breaks which are over far too quickly given the incredible buildup.  Not that we shouldn't expect such things; True Romance, Death Proof.....

All in all, an enjoyable film, one I might watch again some day.  It's a movie that won't disappoint very many people and will overjoy fans of Tarantino and his style of filmmaking.",1267056000,,2907,4.733067729083666

If you've seen anything from Tarantino before then you know his style.  I happen to be a fan of his work and therefore found this movie to be very entertaining.  If you're looking for a historically accurate movie then you may want to look elsewhere.  This movie is to entertain and entertain only.  With that said Tarantino once again creates a story full of witty dialog and enough action to satisfy.  Get ready for some butt kicking fun.

Blu-Ray Review:
The Blu-ray edition of Inglourious Basterds is one you shouldn't miss.  The 1080P/AVC encoded video presentation is beautiful and the DTS-MA 5.1 audio is just as impressive.  It isn't packed with special features but has enough to entertain you for a while.

3954951,3,B002MZZMRM,"The legend of ""Inglorious Basterds,"" QT's long-germinating WWII epic, is as entertaining as the movie itself.  That's not a criticism.  Newspaper and Internet stories have dangled tantalizing tales of Tarantino nurturing this script along - it will be a four-hour epic, it will be a miniseries a la ""Band of Brothers,"" it will be a tribute to ""The Dirty Dozen,"" it will be Tarantino's greatest film, etc.

*** Beware mild spoilers ensue *** (in case you've been under a rock and don't know how the movie ends)

Perhaps no film could have lived up to the hype of ""Basterds,"" but amazingingly, the opening scene does just that.  Using QT's hallowed practice of dividing the movie into chapters, the movie opens with ""Once Upon a Time in Nazi Occupied France.""  A riveting scene of pure dialogue ensues - a masterpiece of tension as the ""Jew Hunter,"" Nazi Colonel Hans Landa (a fantastic Christoph Waltz, destined for a best-supporting actor Oscar) interrogates a French dairy farmer suspected of harboring Jews.  Using a diabolical combination of charm, sincerity, and honesty, Landa establishes himself as one of the great film villains of the new century.  A lone survivor of his raid, Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) flees to Paris to open a film theater (natch).

We then meet the Basterds, led by Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt).  Raine is one of those redneck war gods you see so often in the movies.  Maybe it's because so many films get made by non-Southerners, but it's a cliche of WWII films that if you have a soldier from the South, he's going to be a crack marksman and natural-born soldier (see Barry Pepper's character in ""Saving Private Ryan"").  Raine is equally motivated by sadism, as he and the Basterds are going to parachute into Europe and kill Nazis with such barbarism that the Nazis ""will be sickened by us, and they will fear us.""

QT thereby sets an exquisite table, but then shockingly refuses to serve the meal.  For long stretches of the movie, you wonder, ""where are the Basterds?""  In ""The Dirty Dozen,"" one of QT's all-time favorite movies, you fall in love with the scruffy band of murderers and cut-throats watching them achieve their unique brand of bizarre greatness.  As a result, the final scene at the Nazi chateau combines both terrific action and wonderful exploitation of the bond we have forged with the characters.

""Basterds"" looks a thousand times better than ""Dozen,"" and Tarantino has written some exquisite scenes.  And yet, by the time of the climactic scene at Shosanna's movie theater - which cleverly uses film to defeat Hitler - I could not name any of the Basterds involved in the mission other than Raine.  Indeed, a couple of Basterds appear to be on a suicide mission, yet we have not seen any discussion of who these guys are and why they would be motivated to make that supreme sacrifice.  While the easy answer is, ""because they're killing Nazis,"" but there's nothing in the film that indicates these guys are motivated by anything approaching Bushido - these guys are in Europe to kill Nazis and to keep killing Nazis . . . something that's hard to do if you're committing suicide.

One of the hardest things to do in writing a book or making a movie is deciding what to leave in and what to leave out.  Authors often lament leaving favorite characters and subplots out of stories because they don't work in the overall scheme.  In ""Basterds,"" QT left in some stuff that's darn good but distracts from the overall work - you can't make a movie called ""Basterds"" and not have the audience fall in love with the guys.  But QT doesn't give us time to do that.

Ultimately, this movie has some of the finest scenes of suspense of any war movie (particularly a war movie that doesn't have any real battlefield scenes).  There are also scenes of pure visual artistry.  And there are some terrific performances.  But as a whole, the movie does not exceed the sum of its parts.  It is a case study in What Might Have Been.",1266796800,26,3965,4.705797101449275

The bar room scene/chapter was longer then it should have been.  Only two chapters are worth watching with the bar room being longer then needed.  The chapter at the show had the complete upper elite echelon of the Reich attending a preimer showing of a hero of the Reich's deeds.  It had two soldiers guarding Hitler and maybe ten others guarding elsewhere.  The whole chapter was a joke.  It seems more like the scene was from national lampoon vs this movie.

Fury comics from Marvel because obviously history is tossed to the wind though to carry out a hit on the top officers of the Reich I find no problem with in a twist of history but see 'Valkyrie' though, there Hitler looked authentic, this Hitler was obviously a bit of a caricature. Definitely at times, this movie is a bit like a war comic.  The Basterds themselves really do take a page out of the Dirty Dozen movie in the way it is similar to the 'Dozen' being a sort of special operations unit made of some specific group, the 'Dozen' were prisoners, these guys were Jewish.

Now, take a first-year film student and put him on drugs. Have him shoot the script with Charles Manson directing the screenplay.

Add Tom Hanks' terrible fake Bostonian accent from ""Catch me if you Can"", and don't forget to pervert history so bad that the only thing correct is the spelling (and not the pronunciation) of ""Nazi"".

Or, imagine Tarantino subcontracting his films to be made in China...much how companies move production to China...except imagine the screenplay being made by a random citizen in China who has never seen a movie before, or know what WW2 was.

About Tarantino; I used to PRAISE him for his movies, as he'd make movies like how I would, if given the chance.

This piece of GARBAGE, though? The first thing that set me off was the two-word title, which BOTH of the words are spelled wrong.

WRITTEN BY: Quentin Tarantino

DIRECTED BY: Quentin Tarantino

Rated: R
Genre: Action / Drama
Release Date: 21 August 2009

Despite having the word `inglourious' (yes, I am aware it is miss-spelled; so is basterds) in its title; Quentin Tarantino's latest `artsy' bloodbath Inglourious Basterds, is anything but inglorious. Behind only Public Enemies, this would be my second pick for the best movie of 2009.

I'm such a huge fan of Tarantino's work, that I even give much praise to the continuously bashed and ridiculed Jackie Brown. Being rumored to have the nerve to walk up and personally hand-deliver a copy of his first script Reservoir Dogs, to actor Harvey Keitel; Tarantino is truly one of a kind.

Any book on screenwriting will tell you that dialogue is supposed to be lean and that more is less. Thank God for his audience, Quentin Tarantino pays no matter to this ridiculous rule of Hollywood's thumb. The man has orchestrated some of the longest, intense, comedic and character driven tangents of dialogue, the face of cinema has ever seen. There is no shortage of them in Inglourious Basterds.

The film begins with one in fact, and it was one of my favorite moments. We meet a French man who lives on a farm with his daughters during World War II. He is visited by the notorious Nazi, Colonel Hanz Landa, played by Christoph Waltz. The two sit and have a chat over a smoke from a pipe and a glass of refreshing milk. Their conversation? The details as to whether or not the man is hiding Jews under the floorboards of his small cottage. I won't reveal as to whether or not he is, but let's just say that what happens next sets up the entire second and third acts.

Not long after, we meet the `Basterds.' They are a group of Jewish and American soldiers ""dropped into France, dressed as civilians."" Their mission - ""One thing, and one thing only... killin' Nazis.""

Their leader is Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) and he's one tough cookie. He has a heinous scar across his throat; the origin of which is never revealed to us. He seeks no greater pleasure in life, than hunting down and brutally killing and then scalping Nazis.

Don't get too excited by this though; the only real complaint for the film I have, is there was not enough time with the `Basterds' being `Basterds.' Others would agree with me, in that we would have liked to see a few more scenes of them being `inglourious', to the Nazis. Luckily, Tarantino is already working on a prequel.

I won't even go into any further details of the plot, as it would be virtually impossible to do without revealing crucial spoilers. I will say that is wildly entertaining and out there; as is to be expected from the mind of Tarantino.

It will no doubt trump the Academy Awards; taking home Oscars for best picture, best director, cinematography and best original screenplay. I'd be willing to bet a small fortune that the amazing performance of Christoph Waltz as the disturbed Colonel Hanz, has already justified the engraving of his name on the Oscar for best supporting actor. He was electrifying and flawless in every scene. Tarantino had been working on this script since the early 90s, and is rumored to have put it on the back burner because he couldn't find the right `Hanz.' I think it's safe to say, he made the right choice.

I was not at all surprised to find Brad Pitt blowing me away, yet again. The guy has perfected his craft to a serene art-form and you root for him the entire time. His accent and the persona he has given this character were hilarious.

While I enjoyed the appearance of Mike Myers in the film, I do have something to say about it. I'm not quite sure if it's a comment to him or not, but I mean no disrespect when I say: I can't take him seriously. He is just too funny. Much like Will Ferrell, regardless of how dramatic he is attempting to be - I am laughing.

I'd further like to point out that Tarantino is well aware that this film is a work of fiction. Yes; there is no recording in history of the things that are partaken upon in this film. It's a movie. But we have seen countless `based on...', war films in the past. This is a new idea. A `what if' idea; and I can't think of anything more interesting then Tarantino's vision: what if LT Raine and the Basterds had whipped out Hitler and the Nazis?",1265932800,,4580,4.573870573870574
3954964,2,B002MZZMRM,"Long, boring, pointless. For a film about this crazy commando unit that goes Nazi hunting, there sure was very little of that going on. Just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. About nothing, and mostly from characters who weren't even ""The Basterds"". I think Brad Pitt and his merry band have a total of 30 minutes screen time in what is an insufferably long film. I should have guessed from the very first scene at the French farmhouse that this was going to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a long while.

If you must, out of curiosity or masochism or whatever, see this film for yourself, I highly suggest renting it first.

The film uses a mix of humor, shock, outrage, deviousness, and gory retribution to spin a not improbable story of a semi-renegade troop determined to exact a price for the merciless Jew killing German SS.  The actors in this movie play their parts well although it takes a bit of effort to find Brad Pitt believable as someone from the deep south.  Nevertheless he carries the role off exquisitely and leaves you wondering if someone actually attempted to leave an indelible mark on those that perpetrated such heinous crimes.  Overall an excellent film and highly recommended.",1265846400,2,641,5.018867924528302
3954967,5,B002MZZMRM,"Screenwriter-director Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs) is a somewhat disturbing person, as are his films, which tend toward what I would call ""black drama"" - in the same way that the films of the Coen brothers tend toward black comedy. But Tarantino's films are incredibly interesting both visually and for their stories, which, like the Coens' films, are filled with some very interesting characters. In this case, the Inglourious Basterds is a group of fictional American soldiers, led by Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), that is terrorizing the Nazis in France during WWII by brutally killing and scalping them Indian style. (This is not a film for weak stomachs.) If the group does let one go, they carve a swastika in his forehead so everyone will know, after the war, what he was.

Inglourious Basterds is so well done, and so interesting, that I think it's permissible to overlook Tarantino's excesses for the moment in order to appreciate his craftsmanship. Young directors could learn much from him about how to create riveting scenes, characters and even set pieces. Tarantino likes to create vignettes, which means that each scene can stand on its own, even though, together, they tell a compelling story. His vision seems to come from comic books and graphic novels rather than reality. The art direction and photography are so graphic and so saturated with color that they add to the intensity of the action.

Some of the more vulnerable characters are memorable - like Perrier LaPadite, a French dairy farmer, played by Denis Menochet, who pretty much steals one of the early scenes with his understated but poignant performance. The German Colonel Hans Landa - known as ""the Hunter"" because of his ability to track down Jews, and portrayed superbly by Christoph Waltz - fenagles LaPadite into disclosing that a family of Jews is hiding beneath his house. Or Shosanna, the only member of that family that escapes annihilation by Waltz's men. She flees to Paris and becomes the owner of a cinema that figures prominently in the story. She is played wonderfully by Melanie Laurent.

Daniel Bruhl is effective as Fredrick Zoller, a German officer that becomes infatuated with Shosanna. Besides Colonel Hans Landa, most of the Nazis are little more than caricatures, except for Bridget von Hammersmark, a German actress-turned-spy, played by Diane Kruger, who dominates the best scene in the film - a meeting in a rathskeller that turns into a Mexican standoff and will have you on the edge of your seat. As a matter of fact, most of the movie will. Except for the overly graphic violence and the brutality of certain scenes, Inglourious Basterds is a glorious suspense thriller that even Alfred Hitchcock would admire. Rated R for strong graphic violence, language and brief sexuality.

The first time i watched this movie in my living room, I wanted to stand up and applaud when it finished. The cinematography is absolutely stunning. Each scene contains so much color and detail. Each character is so colorful and essential in this incredible story. Some scenes of the movie left me speechless, while others had me in tears laughing. There is some violence in this movie, but it's necessary to the story and not overblown like every other movie these days. Of course, this movie isn't for everyone, but if you appreciate the art of cinema, great screenwriting, and incredible acting; then i would recommend it. Inglourious Basterds tells such a strong and incredible story that if i had no background knowledge of the 1930's-40's/Holocaust era, I would have pegged it as non-fiction.

If you are watching this movie hoping for a factual holocaust movie with brutal war scenes, an inspiring, hollywood-esque Brad Pitt film, or an incredibly violent and fast-paced action film filled with explosives, fast cars, and naked women- be prepared to be disappointed.",1265760000,2,1153,5.036649214659686

3954973,5,B002MZZMRM,"""Inglourious Basterds""
Directed by Quentin Tarrantino
(2009)
----------------------------------------------
In this delicious genre film, Quentin Tarrantino pays tribute to the classic war movies of the 1950s and '60s, made with the same grandiose aura of faux-epic presentation, draped over a palpably ridiculous plot. The film opens slowly, with Tarrantino employing great restraint and craftsmanship, using beautiful landscape cinematography and slow, deliberate pacing. The camera lingers on the brilliant Austrian actor Christoph Waltz (who steals the show: he was nominated for a ""supporting actor"" Oscar, but he is clearly the movie's real star, playing a vain, sadistic SS officer who loves elaborate cat-and-mouse games.)

Tarrantino also uses misdirection in the film -- the Dirty Dozen-ish commando group of the film's title actually get little screen time, and are quickly decimated by their Nazi foes; Brad Pitt, the nominal star of the show, does very little onscreen and has few lines (although he looks a lot like Clark Gable, which is fun...)  Also, despite the marketing campaign, there isn't that much graphic violence: again, this is probably a conscious homage to the war epics of the '60s, which featured a lot of set-up before their Rube Goldberg-like climaxes, where the grand plan unfolds. The ending, which is preposterous and ahistorical, is a real hoot, a gratifying anti-Nazi wish-fulfillment... Like the film itself, it's pure entertainment and fantasy. And why not? Isn't that what films are supposed to be about?  This isn't immortal art, but it sure is a fun movie. If you grew up watching old war films on Saturday afternoons and afterschool TV blocks, then this flick is for you. Tarrantino really nailed it.

3954974,5,B002MZZMRM,i love this movie. the best example of Tarantino is a masterful writer. teh dialogue sequences are fantasticly suspenseful. if he doesnt win an award for this movie it would be a crime.,1265760000,2,185,4.636363636363637
3954975,3,B002MZZMRM,"Inglorious Basterds is a entertaining movie, and it has beautiful cinematography by Richard Richardson, but the movie is uneven mainly because Brad pitt and Eli Roth seem to be in a totally different movie from the rest of the cast.  The opening scene with the Nazi hunter is brilliant and intense, but then they cut to Brad Pitt who, seems to be hamming it up like he's doing a Oceans 11 movie.  His tone and rhythm are out of sync with the rest of the movie I mean like every time I saw Brad Pitt on the screen I couldn't help but laugh.  Even when he was doing acts of violence.  And ELi ROth needs to stick to directing his acting was over the top and he seemed to be in another movie also.  He was supposed be this big bad intense killing machine but when you saw him it seemed like Eli Roth hamming it up for the cameras, who is over joyed to be in a movie with Brad Pitt and Tarrantino at the helm.  I feel if the perfomances by these two actors were toned down just a bit the movie would have been much better and more hard hitting.",1265760000,2,1040,4.098522167487685
3954976,5,B002MZZMRM,"With no expectations going in, I came out thoroughly impressed not only with the artistic styling of this war dramedy, but with the writing. It has such sharp, witty, terse dialogue, like every line was carefully crafted. Each scene (chapter, as it's called in this movie) could stand alone as a minimovie. It deserves every award it gets.",1265587200,,339,4.862068965517241
3954977,5,B002MZZMRM,"Being Jewish made this film a most rewarding viewing experience. While nothing can ever come lose to atoning what happened to my European brethren, I did feel some sense of redemptiom in watching this film. It certainly has Tarantino stamped all over it as grotesque and brutal scenes of human mutilation and murder contain just the right amounts of irony and dark humor. The film made me want to jump right in and become one of the 'Basterds' myself. The symbolism of the SS 'Jew Hunter' fitting the  shoe on the German double agent actress's  foot sums up the message of the movie beautifully...If the shoe fits, wear it!",1265587200,,623,4.706422018348624
3954978,5,B002MZZMRM,"Another fantastic film by Tarantino.  Contrary to what some people come to this movie looking for, this is a movie driven by dialogue, not action.  If you're here for a gore fest, or a shoot 'em up flick, check out something else.  This movie has an outstanding script that will leave you wanting more.  This is one of those blu ray's I actually watch on a regular basis.  As far as the blu ray goes - the video and audio are both great.

3954979,2,B002MZZMRM,"The film is mostly in French or German with subtitles (and reading them gets to be a chore REAL quickly).  What's worse, Quentin Tarantino tries to go art noir with this film and (unlike in Pulp Fiction, or Kill Bill) fails to pull it off.  What's supposed to be new and artistic just comes off as weird and boring.  Tarantino severely curtails the amount of action and gore that normally suffice for someone who just doesn't click with his quirky style of writing and directing.  The movie was portrayed in advertisements as Tarantino turning the tables on history and having the movie be essentially a two hour gore-filled, splatterfest fantasy of Jews terrorising Nazies.  We were lied to, and we want those two hours of our lives back.",1265587200,4,739,4.7421875

3954983,5,B002MZZMRM,"Based on the trailers for Inglorious Basterds, if you go into this movie expecting a Nazi slaughterfest with scene after scene of Nazi beatings and executions, you might walk away from the movie feeling grossly misled. Because Inglorious Basterds is way more than a slaughterfest. Don't get me wrong...oh, it has it's moments of slaughter, but what makes Inglorious Basterds such a great movie is the sophisticated stories and plotlines leading up to the more violent parts of the movie.

First, a word on Writer/Director Quentin Tarantino's casting: superb! Look, I've heard the criticism that Brad Pitt is successful only because he's a pretty boy, and I have to ask: what the heck is that all about? Pitt is excellent in Inglorious Basterds. The guy can act. The way Pitt scrunches up his face in an annoyed look throughout the entire film and combines it with a no mercy attitude is believable and effective...it works. Really works. And the rest of the cast?...Amazing. Tarantino uses French actors to play the French and German Actors to play the Germans, and this just added an element of reality to a story that (unfortunately) was fictitious.

And the guy who plays the head of Hitler's security deserves Hollywood's highest kudos at all of their self indulgent award shows. German Actor Christoph Waltz plays the evil, intelligent and diabolical Colonel Hans Landa, and when he walks into a scene you shudder. You will not soon forget Waltz's performance.

Tarantino masterfully gets A+ performances out of his cast to tell the story of two plots to assassinate Nazi Germany's top leadership. The movie is devoted more to the development of these plotlines than it is to showing the development of the infamous reputation for murdering Nazi soldiers that Pitt and his band of brothers have. So as I said earlier, walk into Inglorious Basterds with your expectation set for a well-directed, intricate, often deep, storyline with some pretty violent moments and your expectations will be met.

The climactic ending was a bit unbelievable. But overall, Inglorious Basterds is a great movie. Don't miss it.",1265587200,,2112,5.042979942693409

Aldo Raines (Brad Pitt) gets better and better ""marking"" the survivors and he wants his scalps. The character is part Native American and I think the scalping is an homage to his heritage. And, the markings involve a hunting knife to cut a swastika into the 1 person's forehead that they decide to send back to Hitler to torment him.

3954998,4,B002MZZMRM,"I think this film is intended as a warning against the Christian fascism that has currently taken over so much of our country, especially during the Bush admistration.

All the scenes about scalping, what the Indians did when the white man took them over, were intended to show what the Jews (wish they did?) when the Nazis took them over.  What they did in fantasy, through a movie.  What will happen to modern-day Nazis if they try it again....

It is impossible to miss the parallels between some of our current far-right politicians and far-right religious leaders and the fascists strutting around in their uniforms covered with crosses, so arrogant, unwilling to be told ""no"" by a woman, getting what they wanted through fear, intimidation, and manipulation.

It reminds me of Sylvia Plath talking about how ""Every woman loves a Nazi""--- until they see what is going on, that is.

From beginning the end the film is oozing with suspense, but also a hint of comedic taste that only Quentin can blend so well. In Inglourious Basterds most of Quentins comedic output is shown through Brad Pitt's character, so to the people complaining about his outlandish accent, it was to compliment or ampilfy the comedic tones of his lines. The most profound actor of the lot in this movie is without question Christoph Waltz (Hans Landa). His acting is superb, believable, and definately worth an oscar. The storyline in the movie is explained mostly through dialogue and where the heart of suspense is. So yes, there will be alot of talking and subtitles, but keep in mind it helps move along the story and build suspense. The film has enough action and gore to keep most people entertained, but some viewers have said that it is to violent or gory. This comment seems to be irrevelant though, after all it is a war movie by Quentin Tarantino and in no way, shape, or form does it take away from the Triple-A quality the movie offers. It is most definately a movie i would highly suggest.",1264982400,,1236,4.597285067873303
3955006,5,B002MZZMRM,"This is an interesting, well-plotted, fascinating film that won't be to everyone's tastes. It centers around all sorts of goings-on during WWII with a plot that's incredibly intricate and nastily violent.

The movie features several stories that eventually lock together. You've got the Nazi ""Jew Hunter"",played by Christoph Waltz (in one of the best performances of the year. Before seeing this I was prepared to say the Best Supporting Actor win would go to Christian McKay for his performance in ""Me and Orson Welles"". Now I'm not so sure), a Jewish woman (M&eacute;lanie Laurent)who survived a massacre of her family led by the ""Jew Hunter"" (what is that in German? ""Juden Jaeger"", I assume), and then, almost as an afterthought, you've got an American guerrilla group led by one Lt Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), who offers one of the most hilarious moments in the film when he speaks Italian with a very thick Tennessee accent.

It's hard to describe the plot without giving away huge parts of the movie. Suffice to say the Basterds are sent across enemy lines to wreak havoc against the Nazis (which they do rather graphically). Meantime the Jew Hunter is oozing his way across the landscape and the Jewish woman he failed to kill is running a movie theatre. When the Nazis decide to premiere a movie there, she makes plans to blow it up.

As usual with Tarantino, there's lots of blood and gore, plus plenty of references to other movies. The soundtrack is like a Spaghetti Western, there's an appearance by Emil Jannings, references to the works of Leni Riefenstahl and mention of the great German film studio UFA. Left out are comments on the works of Murnau and Lang, but given the Nazi view of Lang especially, that's no great surprise.

As mentioned the movie tells several stories all at once. It is a testament to Tarantino as a filmmaker that I never once felt lost and that the stories come together in a way that seems quite natural.

I'm no great Tarantino fanboy. ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Kill Bill"" (both parts), remain to me some of the most overrated films in history. I didn't like either one. On the other hand, ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Jackie Brown"" are two of my all-time favorite films, so there you go.

The DVD extras include some deleted scenes (though fewer than you'd expect), as well as trailers and a six-minute short film done in the style of Riefenstahl. It's less interesting than one might want.

Ultimately I recommend this movie. It's a tad on the violent side (to put it mildly), but well worth seeing.",1264896000,2,2529,4.747152619589977
3955007,5,B002MZZMRM,"I saw it when it first came out and enjoyed it.  Liked it even more on second and third viewing.  Tarantino can be heavy handed at times,  but even with that the characters are memorable and very interesting.",1264896000,,208,4.421052631578948
3955008,2,B002MZZMRM,"Its not a bad WWII movie, but what amazed me was Quentin's shot at Brian Hutton's 'Where Eagles Dare'
during the interview with Elvis Mitchell - Quentin says he 'just didn't buy it' and 'they pissed away all
the suspense' yada yada...I mean so what if the characters don't speak German or whatever, its the story
that counts and what Quentin doesnt realise is that 'Where Eagles Dare' which starred
Clint Eastwood and Richard Burton back in 1968 is a classic, and a far superior film to this. The cable
car fight is still a white knuckle ride, despite the obvious special effects - that is an example of
great film making when the audience knows its fake but still invests emotion. Inglorious Basterds wasnt
a bad movie but Hutton's film still owns 40+ years down the road and is fondly rememebered
as a classic of this genre. Also worth noting ""Where Eagles Dare"" has more action, suspense and intrigue

Unfortunately, the gratuitous violence ends up spoiling what could be otherwise some brilliant scene making, and some memorable characters.  Christoph Waltz is absolutely brilliant and hypnotizing as a garrulous and smoothly sociopathic SS officer.  Brad Pitt plays a Tennessee rube turned Nazi Hunter.  There are memorable performances by other actors and actresses, but the level of graphic violence, much of which is unnecessary to the plot, suggests that Quentin Tarantino, for whatever undeniable talents he may have, is a disturbed man.  I probably should have been forewarned by some of his previous equally gruesome productions where violence takes center stage.  For people who don't want to watch people's brains being bashed in, or people being literally scalped in front of them, this is for sure a movie to avoid.

3955017,2,B002MZZMRM,"There's one thing about this movie that none of the previous reviews have touched on, which is how do you know who are the bad guys and who are the good guys?  I realize that this sounds strange when talking about a Nazi movie, but it's the truth.  I always watch movies with a clean slate, meaning I suspend my reality and like to get lost in the movie's reality.  Other than the opening scence of the movie where Nazis are shooting through the floorboards of a house where a farmer  is hiding Jews, there's really nothing here to convince me to root against the Nazis.

When it comes time to intrduce us to the Basterds, there is really nothing to make me want to root for them.  There is a scene where, after a battle (which we never see)the Basterds are scalping dead Germans (which is the Basterds' trademark), they give one of the surviving Germans a chance to live if he informs on another German patrol, when he refuses to betray his countrymen, he is beaten to death with a baseball bat.  A second surviving German, an infantryman, is given the same option to inform and willingly gives up the information.  His reward?  He is allowed to live but the leader of the Basterds carves a scar into his forhead, in the shape of a swastiki, with a Bowe knife.

Latter in the movie, when one of the Allied informants (a German actress)is laying in an operating room, the leader of the Basterds sticks his figure in her open leg wound becuase he doesn't think she is giving him the correct information.

That sums up this entire movie.  There really nothing that make you want to root for either side.  You never see the Germans commiting attrocites, and you never see the Basterds doing anything but hurting people.  Would it have killed Tarantino to have a scene where the Basterds save civilons from Nazis?

3955019,5,B002MZZMRM,"Seven months ago, upon my first viewing of the trailer for Quentin Tarantino's highly anticipated WWII film, ""Inglourious Basterds,"" a small coat of goosebumps covers my arms and neck. The words flash across the screen: ""You haven't seen war ... until you've seen it through the eyes ... of Quentin Tarantino."" And after viewing Basterds, never have any truer taglines been used for a movie's publicity. To say that Tarantino has his own style of filmmaking is one of the most obvious understatements to even a novice filmgoer.

Tarantino's magnus opus (to this day),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill-Vol-1-2-2-Pack/dp/B000Q7Q2WM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill - Vol. 1 & 2 (2 Pack)</a>, is the greatest testament to his style, blending spaghetti western, Shaw Bros. Kung Fu films, 1970's revenge pics, grindhouse B-movie and Japanimation. It's the quintessential Quentin film, showcasing his cinephile hodge-podge style that has driven most viewers to the love-him-or-hate-him mantle that has recently emblazoned into audience and critics' minds alike. No matter how violent, profane, or sometimes cartoonish Tarantino's characters may seem, you still have to admit that he creates some damn cool characters with dialogue that only he could conjure, and puts them in run-of-the-mill plots that shift with breakneck speed into SNAFU situations. Now, he's taken his unique style to early 1940's Nazi-occupied France. But first, a brief interlude.

Growing up, I was never a big fan of war movies. Upon the first reading of this, my wife's jaw will most likely drop of shock and awe as she knows of my strange draw to the dark war and crime thriller genres that I often watch. But I promise you - and her - it's true. Don't get me wrong, I watched war films, but I was never drawn to watch them. I just watched them to watch them. During my pre-adolescent years, I vaguely remember brief glimpses of John Wayne and Gary Cooper war films that inundated my uncle's TV when I would sleep over my cousins' house. My dad - himself a fan of films - while he loves a good action movie, he never can bring himself to sit down and watch a war movie. He doesn't mind movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Braveheart-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000W8OM5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Braveheart (Special Collector's Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Patriot-Extended-Cut/dp/B000ELL1S0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Patriot (Extended Cut)</a>, or ""300,"" but after serving in Vietnam, a Navy photographer surveying the madness of war from a helicopter as bullets whizzed past him (similar to Joe Galloway from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/We-Were-Soldiers-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000068TPN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">We Were Soldiers (Widescreen Edition)</a>), any movies depicting battles from WWII to the present, he won't even attempt to view.

Of course, some aren't as reflective and poignant as Spielberg's. But there have been excellent films of this genre to follow in its footsteps and have filled my DVD collection: ""Black Hawk Down,"" ""We Were Soldiers,"" and the HBO miniseries&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Band-of-Brothers/dp/B00006CXSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Band of Brothers</a>.

Now, ""Basterds"" has joined the ranks of these great war films. Yes, it has Tarantino's quirky trademark stamp, but it's also one of the most serious, and, at times, non-Tarantino, films he's created. Sure, there's the occasional interludes of Samuel L. Jackson narration, the Ennio Morricone-riddled score, a brief comic book-style character profile and the fantastic opening sequence between SS Colonel Hans Landa (the superb Christoph Waltz) and a French Jewish sympathizer that is somewhat reminiscent of the famous Dennis Hopper-Christopher Walken scene in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Romance-Director-s-Cut-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00006FDCF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Romance - Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;(just one of my favorite cinema scenes ever). Nonetheless, this film also has a majority of subtitles, a mostly foreign, unknown-in-America cast, and probably is the least violent, more talkative films Tarantino's ever done.

I would be remiss if I didn't first mention the most stand-out element: Christoph Waltz. He was awarded the Best Actor Award at Cannes, and Best Supporting Actor at the Golden Globes and SAG, and, after viewing the film, it's easy to see why. Waltz can transition from laid-back ease one moment to child-like zaniness to nail-biting, cold ruthlessness all in one brilliant quick natural stroke. Brad Pitt's Aldo Raine, a southern hillbilly who gloriously terrorizes any Nazis who cross his path, leads the Special Ops team known fearfully to the Germans as the Basterds. They - including a brawny director Eli Roth as the ""Bear Jew,"" Donny Donowitz, who beats Nazis to death with a baseball bat inscribed with the names of Jews who his neighbors worry about back in the U.S. (a fact only known by reading the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/screenplay/dp/0316070351/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">screenplay</a>&nbsp;since the scene was cut from the film) - tear a bloody path across France, littering it with dead, scalped Nazi soldiers in their wake. And while the movie's title refers to this small band of bastards, don't expect Pitt and his crew to headline and have dominated screen time. The central characters to this film are Hans Landa and the Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent - think of a French Sarah Polley). Although Shosanna has made a life for herself managing a small cinema, her wish to avenge her family's death comes into fruition when she catches the eye of the Nazi's ""Sergeant York,"" Private Zoller (Daniel Bruhl).

Apart from Pitt and a few of the Basterds, each of the cast is rather unknown in America since Tarantino wanted to use real German and French actors to play their counterparts (fun little fact: Leonardo DiCaprio was considered for Hans Landa, but Tarantino wanted a German actor to play the part). The acting is solid on all counts. Pitt delivers a small but important role similar to his Mickey O'Neil in Snatch. Roth, Diane Kruger, and Michael Fassbender give good, quirky performances, but the best performances go to Laurent and Waltz. They perfectly capture the seriousness and the sometimes-zaniness of the plot without seeming hokey.

While Inglourious Basterds certainly had room for improvement, it marked far better than certain other action flicks this summer (uh-hum, *G.I. Joe*). I did wish that some of the ""basterds"" backgrounds were slightly more explored as well as what became of their fates (it's probably just an assumption to the audience that they were K.I.A. during their mission). However, with a rewrite of history, quick, outrageous bursts of violence, a majority of subtitles and a cast of serious, A-list actors (most of them foreign), Tarantino nearly perfectly balances the line between cheesy B-movie action flick and serious epic WWII film, placing it in the same class as one of my favorites: ""The Dirty Dozen."" This one stands in file behind ""(500) Days of Summer,"" ""Up,"" and ""Away We Go"" as my best of the summer.",1264550400,,8493,6.27958833619211
3955020,4,B002MZZMRM,"Quinten Tarantino has attempted The Great American Novel in his ""Inglourious Basterds."" What, you say, a movie, not a novel?

Yes, it's a movie, but consider: (please note that my descriptors are not definitive---the nature of the novel shape-shifts)
1. It acts like a novel (chapters, different settings, many characters, complicated plot lines that converge for the final unraveling--this also is not a necessity),
2. It ""reads"" like a novel (actual chapter divisions and much dialogue--neither is required),
3. It has a central conflict (ridding the world of Nazis, concluding with a mighty clever resolution),
4. It falls into its own literary genre (the re-imagination of a world event into a fantasia of Pulp Fiction proportions), sooooooo, what is it? Crime fantasy? Fantasia of evil? Revenge documentary spliced with actual footage? Historical fiction---no---make that historical fantasy? See what I mean?
5. It is long at two hours and 40 minutes (not all novels are long)

OK, granted, ""Inglourious Basterds"" IS a movie about actual events, but ones re-imagined, re-considered, re-invented and put back together as something new. It becomes novel in that its very first scene is  bathed in quiet undertones of civilized dialog, loaded with the machine-gun staccato of impending violence. The viewer asks how? when? Then comes the blasting of visual imagery, and an escape that becomes a pivot of more violence. What is new under the sun? According to the Prophet, nothing. The theme Tarantino considers is this: What is evil? Who has it? Who does it? What are the results?

In some ways Tarantino's script is a Picasso masterpiece: that taking apart of history, then distorting it into something new: deconstruction reconstructed. Call it Taranting. Tarantino likes to ""tarant."" Take something out of modern life: hits by hitmen, violence for violence's sake, mass genocide. Then take that whatever and make it into something new. It's this step that makes Tarantino so prominent and admired in film-making. Pulp Fiction becomes a philosophizing about the nature of life. Reservoir Dog becomes a caricature of man's violent nature, and Inglourious Basterds becomes a poison-dripped commentary on genocide, violence for violence's sake, a reversal of all things decent into all things evil and vile, switching making no difference especially in the character of the German SS officer.

These reasons (cited above) are why Brad Pitt is so good in his role. He plays it with gusto, with exaggeration, with sanity swathed in insanity, with evil run amok. Pitt plays his role with exactly the right nasty machismo and vulgarity and lasciviousness required by Tarantino's taranting. He should win an Academy Award nomination (at least) for this bold acting job. Many viewers miss this point and call him a caricature, his role as silliness. I suggest: Think again. Would Tarantino allow Pitt to diss his taranting?

As for the conclusion: It was good to see the good guys win. Wait a minute. Did they?",1264550400,2,3005,5.211180124223603

3955033,5,B002MZZMRM,"The impresario of the modern game of violence is at it again. Not since the sleeper ""The History of Violence,"" ""Munich,"" or Tarantino's own ""Reservoir Dogs,"" and his tour de force, the masterpiece ""Pulp Fiction,"" have we been served such a tasty platter of cinematic violence.

On the menu du jour is both glorious and inglorious violence, and in all their various guises: sweet and bitter violence; morally justifiable violence; violence with and without vengeance; artful and artless violence; unmitigated and mitigated violence, sexual violence, shoot in the testicles violence, ballroom violence, bludgeoning in the head with a baseball bat violence, intellectual and structural violence, strangulation violence, sniper's hero violence, war is hell violence, and an entirely new genre of violence: The ""reverse holocaust incineration violence."" Conspicuously missing from the platter was two of America's favorites: unjustifiable random violence and ""justifiable homicide"" - i.e., random violence by ghetto police against blacks.

One would think that since our nation's history is so deeply steeped in violence, our filmmakers would by now have perfected cinematic depictions of it as a genre. However, while most filmmakers unaccountably just keep getting lazier and thus worse at it, Tarantino alone seems to just keep getting fresher and better at it. If you think the old ""kill a Nazi"" trope has been exhausted, then think again, for here it has been revived, and done so with a creative vengeance.

There are not enough metaphors lying around to do justice to Tarantino's handling of violence as the creative backbone of his artistic missions, but two do come to mind. In the first one, violence must be seen (as Duke Ellington saw music), as Tarantino's mistress. And this mistress has to be coaxed into bed, kissed and made love to gently and with great skill, lest the orgasm be released too soon. That of course is where the plot comes in (no pun intended). Here the plot is laid down like a sound track on a musical recording. It can be ""standalone,"" but is most useful when it keeps the beat in the background: The plot is to be expanded and compressed, the tempo increased or lagged, and made comical or interesting, depending on the demands of the shape of violence in the main theme in the foreground: Violence thus is the sole instrument of Tarantino's venture into creative human discovery. And he wields it as deftly as any good artist wields a paintbrush.

In the second, Tarantino must be seen as just the conductor of a symphony (of violence) in which he orchestrates a score composed simply to collect an earlier unpaid debt from the Nazi holocaust. His ""score"" is a thinly disguised plot of ""justificatory revenge:"" Sixty years after the fact the Nazi hierarchy must pay in symbolic currency what could not otherwise be collected in objective currency, i.e., in reality. Thus this is nothing less than Hollywood's attempt (through Tarantino) to collect on an outstanding moral debt. And thus at least in some sense, amounts to a ""reverse symbolic holocaust."" The newest trope thus is: While ""out to play,"" the leaders of the ""master race"" get incinerated in a theater just like the 400 Jews  of Oradour-sur-Glane, France did in 1944. That is cinematic justice, paid in full, but after the fact. Pure and simple.

Thus taken altogether the truth is that this medley of thinly disguised justificatory revenge violence, looks and feels good, real good. But alas, Tarantino has rolled the dice, plumbed the depths of America's mother lode: unadulterated violence and come up with ""craps."" No one had to tell him that America's love affair with violence is where the rest of America's soul can be found --after all he is not stupid? But at the bottom of this reservoir, this orgy of justificatory revenge, is violence's next-door neighbor. Did we forget that violence's next-door neighbor is hatred? [After all what good is violence if there is no one to hate?]

And therein lies the rub. This is where Tarantino has come full circle, and we have been caught up in his neat emotional trick bag: ""Morally justifiable violence"" without mega-hatred is an ""oxymoron,"" for wasn't it the Hebrew Bible that warned us that ""violence begets violence?"" -- even when it is directed against Hebrews? That is, even when it is used in the service of collecting a debit on the holocaust? Is that not exactly the same as what Osama bin Laden is doing? And was that not exactly the same message of both the ""History of Violence"" and ""Munich?"" Pitt gets an award for this. He was just great!

3955035,5,B002MZZMRM,I decided to view this movie at a moment when I was especially sick of modern right wing fascists. This movie is the antidote  for people who suffer from knowing what a nazi is. Since when does a war movie have to be... a true story? It's good to twist those villains... to finally give them what the deserve. Very intelligent movie with fantastic dialogue. It's a masterpiece. Seemed like half an hour. Now I will have to pay attention to this director. Thank you Mr. T.,1264032000,,471,4.413793103448276
3955036,1,B002MZZMRM,"For those that have studied WWII, and unfortunately, seen real human brains on the ground, this movie is a travisty, a sadistic farce, and a coplete waste of time like most of Tarantinos other questionable work. I do admit to liking ""Reservour Dogs"" to a point. However, this thing does not even have an original title.

I unfortunately received this DVD by mistake and see this project as a new low for Brad Pitt and the other actors taking part in this joke of making jews more barbaric than the Nazis.  It perpetuates blame on the common German soldiers while covering up the major part US and UK bankers like Prescott Bush had in funding Hitler, as well as, the now confirmed part that British Intelligence had in bringing Hitler and Mussolini to power begiining immediately at the end of WWI.

WWII was a complex and tragic event, and the real world history deserves better than this self serving, mythological blood feast served up for fools too lazy to look for the truth, and try to prevent a reoccurance. History can repeat itself when we become manipulated by propaganda, desensitized to inhumane actions, and self righteous.",1264032000,9,1135,4.780612244897959
3955037,4,B002MZZMRM,"This is just a review of the Blu-Ray ""2 Disc Special Edition"" since there are plenty of reviews of the movie itself by reviewers far more qualified than I.

The video and sound quality is excellent and I have no complaints about that. But I have to give this 4 stars instead of 5, because, I just don't get some of the ""marketing lingo"" on this package:

* This version does NOT include a running commentary. None at all (not director, not actors, not cinematographer, nothing). To me this is really odd -- it seems that almost all DVDs released in the last 10 years have had some sort of commentary track. Especially with a Tarantino movie, this seems like something you really WANT to have.
* I think this is the only Blu-ray version available right now. It includes the ""digital copy"" but that is just a lower-res copy of a movie with DRM, nothing wrong with getting that with it, but that is one of the TWO discs in the ""Special Edition""
* If this is the only one available, and it doesn't include stuff like a commentary, what makes the Marketing people put the ""Special Edition"" tag on it? I guess because it comes with the low-res copy, see previous item...
* Other info on the package is misleading too. It says under ""Additional Features:"" ""The original Inglorious Bastards."" This might lead one to conclude that it includes the original movie (and there would be plenty of room for an SD copy of a movie on a Blu-ray disk. This feature is just a 10-minute summary of the movie and discusses it's relation to the new movie. A nice feature worth watching, but I think the way it is named as a feature is misleading.
* Minor thing: They put a sticker about ""Includes Digital Copy"" on the metallic-printed cardboard sleeve. When you take off the sticker, it removes part of the metallic printing. I know these sleeves are only meant to make the product look nice and flashy and get your attention when it's on a store shelf. But for those of us that like to keep these, it was annoying the way it was stickered. If they put the sticker on the outer plastic shrink-wrap this wouldn't be a problem.

Still a great movie and I'm glad I got the disc. Giving it 4 of 5 because of the questionable ""Special-ness"" of the Edition.",1264032000,155,2228,4.442542787286063
3955038,2,B002MZZMRM,"Quentin Tarantino is all about the gimmick now. While PULP FICTION was an original, mazelike  movie with memorable characters and KILL BILL VOL.1 was the perfect grindhouse kung fu revenge film (modernized for today's audience), everything else he's done feels either half-baked, self-congratulatory, incomplete, or all of the above. I think that in most of his dialogue-driven films (JACKIE BROWN, KILL BILL VOL. 2, DEATH PROOF, and this film INGLORIOUS BASTERDS), Tarantino THINKS he knows how certain people talk. I know that it's supposed to be ""his vision"" and ""just a movie"", but there still has to be something for the audience to connect to as it's going on. In most of his films, I feel no connection. And that is definitely true of this film INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS.

INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS gets off to a promising start introducing us to the despicable Jew Hunter Colonel Hans Landa (played brilliantly by Oscar frontrunner Christoph Waltz) and his interrogation of a French farmer. This tense scene effectively touches upon the evil that was Nazism, especially it's conclusion. Then, the movie falls apart immediately with, ironically, the introduction of the title characters! The Basterd unit, led by Brad Pitt (in a seriocomic role playing Sgt. Aldo Raine) are too distant to the viewer and we get absolutely no handle on what any of them is about, except for perhaps Hugo Stiglitz, but even his intro and backstory is muzzled by Tarantino's self-congratulation by using out-of-place elements from his other films (odd 70s-style subtitles and narration).

There's been a lot of buzz about a second scene in a basement of a Paris bar where a showdown between some of the Basterds and German soldiers occurs. It's a well executed scene, but drags on for way too long and is really devoid of any of the depth or provocation that Tarantino displayed in similarly long scenes in PULP FICTION. The whole time this scene was going on, I was like, ""What's the point?!"" And after the climax of the scene, we are left with one surviving character (the most annoying of the scene) that we are supposed to empathize with, but all his droning and whining just makes me glad of what actually happened to him. I wish more characters in this were treated to a fitting end to get them out of this mess of a film.

The most interesting characters are the two main females French-Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfuss (heartbreaking Melainie Laurent, whose character is the core of the film) and crafty double-agent German actress Bridget von Hammersmark (sexy Diane Kruger, the second best character in the film behind Hans Landa). While INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS certainly has some good characters in it in addition to the aforementioned ones, they are all trapped in a rather messy film with too much dialogue and in scenes that go absolutely nowhere. Tarantino really lets loose with his histrionics and weirdness in the painfully dull, long, tedious final act.

While the odd, over-the-top final act (with a tacked-on ending) is my biggest complaint with the film, the film overall feels very disconnected and incomplete; the viewer can't connect with the characters due to the overemphasis on talking; they all feel like set pieces, rather than real people. Tarantino has good ideas and executes SOME of them well (esp. the opening scene, which actually has some depth and believability), but steps on his own toes so much that he ends up screwing up his own film. With 70s title threads, jive-talking narrators, music stolen from his previous films (which he already stole from other films!), an idiotic interpretation of Hitler and his falling regime, and even the equivalent of an 80s music video, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS plays like one of Tarantino's dreams (or nightmares if you prefer).",1264032000,32,3776,5.02555910543131

3955040,3,B002MZZMRM,"When I saw this movie I was hoping for a group of men who did a exciting mission  to inflitrate the Nazi's in France in other words a decent commando movie.  Instead this was more of a fantasy in which all the top Nazi's get killed off in a movie theater.  And we really didn't get to see a fast moving story like 'where eagles dare' or even 'the dirty dozen"" among the many other movies.  Ok , the top Nazi's deserved to die in theater blown to bits. They were complete monsters but it's not even close to what really happened in history.  So this movie becomes a revenge fantasy movie , which if it had a suspenseful buildup would have been easier for me to digest.  However I am biased in that I have a degree in history and believe that at a least a basic framework should be followed when making some movies.  I love Quentin Tarantinos work including the underrated ""jackie brown"" but this one just was flat for me. And that has nothing to do with history. It wasn't like we saw them go behind the lines against the odds and carry out any mission. Instead we see a psychotic slaughter of German soldiers with nothing leading up to it much.
These were even really bad germans either.  This was a major A movie so on that scale I would have to give it a 3 star rating in my book.  The blu ray looks great though and it's the only way to go if you want to own this movie.",1263945600,,1373,4.131578947368421
3955041,4,B002MZZMRM,"INGLORIOUS BASTERDS is brilliantly scripted, has two of the best acting jobs all year, and is purely Tarantino. If you've seen any of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill/dp/B001BR5F4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill</a>&nbsp;series or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Grindhouse/dp/B000R7HY0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Grindhouse</a>&nbsp;films, you'll know to expect a bit of blood and brutality. This is, however, Tarantino's first dip into alternate history, and he does a great job at it. However I do think he toned down the bloodshed a tad. Perhaps he's becoming more aware of it, or perhaps he just didn't feel the film warranted it. Whatever the reason, it balanced out nicely ...compared to his other films which tended to go overboard on the crimson.

The alternate history involves three unique perspectives: Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) aka The Jew Hunter. Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Burn-After-Reading/dp/B001JIE7JM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Burn After Reading</a>). And Shosanna (Melanie Laurent). All three of these perspectives are taken to extremes (no surprise, again, considering we're talking about a Tarantino movie) during WW II in which we see a persecuted Jew get her just dessert by killing Hitler in her own version of ""The Final Solution."" We get to see Lt. Aldo Raine (Pitt) gather a group of ruthless ""Gnat-see"" killers and carve swastikas into their foreheads. And finally we get the cream of the crop, Jew Hunter Colonel Hans Landa (Waltz) who's ability to sniff out hiding Jews have given him his title.

Without Christoph Waltz and Brad Pitt in their respective roles, I feel this film wouldn't have been a fraction as good as it was; probably a testament to the casting heads. But specifically to Waltz as Landa, who played the slimy Nazi brutalist only interested in saving his own skin by the end of the war. I think he deserved top billing, not Pitt (although Pitt did his usual extraordinarily great job). Waltz was so key to the entire film that he really held the reins of the story throughout its length. And his range of emotions, from anger to giddiness, was astoundingly disturbing. I loved every second he was on-screen. The fact that the Hollywood Foreign Press gave him a Golden Globe for his supporting role was most appropriate (and I noticed he's garnered praise from many other award ceremonies and, I'm hoping, the Academy Award roster will list him this year).

Brad Pitt as the countryfied, American Nazi-hunter was great. But most of his notable lines are delivered whenever he's on-screen with Waltz. The ending sequence in the woods with Lt. Raines' knife and Col. Landa's ...umm ...life, are wonderfully vicious.

Of course, we cannot leave out French actress Melanie Laurent as the persecuted Shosanna who is forced to watch her family slaughtered by Landa then flee to Paris and blend in with society. Only later does she learn that her new life and career sets her up perfectly to exact revenge on the Nazi party ...and its top leaders; the very top, in fact. She also is forced to fight off the advances of a German soldier whom she finds both endearing and loathsome.

By the end of Inglorious Basterds, you feel like you've been on a wild ride at a theme park, until you realize you've never left your seat. It's a remarkable film that is cast exceptionally well. This one's worth owning for sure.",1263859200,6,3561,5.479052823315119
3955042,5,B002MZZMRM,"I can tell by reading the reviews on this site that this movie is a love it or hate it thing; Some people found all the dialog and set-up boring, the subtitles a pain in the butt to read, and there was not enough action in this 2 1/2 hour epic film.

I, however, thought otherwise. In fact, I would even say that this is Tarantino's best and most mature film despite the premise of 'killing Nazis'. I think many people thought that this was going to be the main premise of the movie, just slaughtering German's left and right. In fact, I do think that the ad campaign for this movie was a little misleading in that respect.

This film is all about the dialog, the settings, and waiting for the outcome you know is coming. A great ensemble cast and the use of subtitles only add to the realism, and there is no shortage of either the trademark Quentin humor or sudden bursts of unexpected violence.

For those expecting another Kill Bill, they will be sorely disappointed. But for those who are looking for smart, intense, well-acted WW2 drama w/a few unexpected surprises, this is the film for you. It is one of remarkable depth, and it is almost hard to believe Tarantino made it....in a good way.  A thick, rewarding film. Beautifully filmed, too.  The images on blu-ray really come to life; the theater just did not do this movie justice in terms of the visuals.

3955046,1,B002MZZMRM,"The trailer says it all; and yet, watching it in full doesn't provide too much more, except for the occasional weird (and, in once instance, very touching) plot twists.

But... apparently, there were deleted scenes and new characters aplenty, including one created for Maggie Cheung!  (Huh?! How could you get Maggie Cheung to be in your film and then not use the footage?!?)

Nice use of German and French and Italian, which is welcome for people who are not monolingual, but the film lacks a main character. Who is the film's protagonist? It's not Brad Pitt, nor any of the people on the movie poster. If anything, it's Shosanna Dreyfus, who is central to the opening scene as well as the main plot, but she doesn't have much screen time. Sure, the Basterds are busy striking fear in the Nazi's heart, but do we really care?

What is interesting about the film itself is how two circumstantial plots come together to ensure the outcome, which I don't think I've seen in a film before. The other thing that is interesting is that the film appears to be leading to a sequel; I would think that part two could be more interesting than part one.

You have to relate to The Bear Jew from Boston to appreciate the character.  Even Hitler is amusing in this thing, and the acting is tremendous.

3955055,4,B002MZZMRM,"I found this movie quite surprising for a number of reasons.  Initially I was kinda pissed at Tarantino, assuming he had jumped on the remake bandwagon by redoing Enzo Castellari's Italian war flick, Inglorious Bastards.  Thankfully, Tarantino didn't go that route.  Aside from the catchy(slightly altered) title, and the film being set during WWII, Tarantino's film has practically nothing to do with Castellari's film.  So that was a(pleasant)surprise.  Lots of folks hated this film.  Though I think many people know what to expect from Tarantino at this point, many folks still felt let down by this one.  I can only imagine that the modern filmgoer, who requires stimulation and action every two minutes or they get bored, was put off by the fact that this had little onscreen warefare action.  I can only imagine people were expecting two and a half hours of relentless Saving Private Ryan-type action.  Nope, doesn't happen.  Instead they got....uh oh....a plot that actually took it's time to unfold!  Imagine that nonsense!  Strike one.  Also, Brad Pitt is the star power, but people found that he doesn't have much screen time, and instead, much of the screen time is devoted to relatively unknown actors.  Personally, I thought this was great coz I don't care for Brad Pitt and I'm not sure how I would have responded to 150 minutes of his mug in every frame.  Strike two for all those Pitt fans who went to see it.  Then you got the dialogue.  Modern theatergoers can't stand dialogue driven films, and not only is this film dialogue driven to hell, but most of it is in subtitles!!  The one thing modern audiences hate more than Black and White film is subtitles!  Strike three.
Tarantino really pulled one over, didn't he?  He(God forbid)gave the film a slow, Sergio Leone type pacing(Tarantino always wears his influences on his sleeve, and Leone seems to be a big influence on this movie), he minimized the big Hollywood star's screen time and essentially made him a supporting character, and he had the Germans and the French speaking their native language.  Wow.
In a nutshell the plot is about a Jewish theater owner's plan to kill Hitler and many of the high ranking officials of the Nazi party when they all decide to attend a film premiere at her theater in 1944 Nazi occupied France.  Meanwhile, a small ragtag group of Jewish soldiers(""The Basterds"") led by Brad Pitt and his brutal right hand man played by Eli Roth(just when I was beginning to think we'd finally started seeing the end of this guy), are on a rage fueled mission to kill and scalp as many Nazis as possible.  The ""Basterds"" also find out about the film premiere and hatch their own plan to destroy Hitler and his Reich.  There are a few minor subpots and characters, but everything serves as a buildup to the night of the film premiere.
Basically what Tarantino did here(as he pretty much does with all of his movies)is made an exploitation film masquerading as a Hollywood film.  From the title cards introducing/pointing out characters, the minimal(and pointless) use of a narrator(Samuel L. Jackson), anachronistic music that includes 70s style funk, over-the-top performances and characters(Pitt especally), graphic gratuitous violence, and a total disregard for factual history make this a big exploitation film in a very thin disguise.  I mean, come on, all bets are off when Mike Myers appears in a small role, I don't care if he is playing it serious.  I realize that exploiting the atrocities of WWII for the sake of movie entertainment seems to be in very bad taste, but hey, it worked for Ilsa: She Wolf of the SS, and what household in America doesn't own and cherish a copy of that movie?
Some flak aimed at this movie comes from the fact that Jews are all portrayed as bloodthirsty savages bent on revenge.  So what?  If the same characters had been Irish, nobody would be saying anything.  Violent revenge films have existed for many years and span countless film genres.  There's really no point in reading into it all that deeply.  After all, this is a movie where Hitler walks out of the theater so he can ask the SS soldier standing guard for a piece of gum.
So, yeah, I thought this was a surprisingly good movie.  Sure it has it's faults.  It does suffer from a tad much of Tarantino's diarrhea of the mouth(though unlike the excruciating yammering of Death Proof, most of the dialogue here at least holds interest), and some scenes don't need to go on quite as long as they do, but for the mostpart I feel Tarantino succeeded in making his best film in quite a few years.",1263600000,2,4585,4.754740834386852

3955058,3,B002MZZMRM,"Well, I think other reviewers have already done a terrific job discussing the story and numerous movie references in Quentin Tarantino's latest film ""Inglourious Basterds,"" so I will make my review brief. The real star of ""Inglourious Basterds"" is neither Brad Pitt nor Diane Kruger. It is Christoph Waltz as COL. Hans Landa, whose great performance deserves its own film.

From the moment he steps into a farmer's house in occupied France (very intense Chapter 1, the best part of the film), we know Tarantino made a right choice. When the film is not boring, his character - smooth-talking, cunning and chilling - is always there. (Almost equally great is Michael Fassbender and the gripping basement scene involving his LT. Archie Hicox should not be missed.)

Probably those who have seen his ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" must know what is coming in Tarantino's take of a WWII-revenge story set in alternate Europe. Lots of violence have become a kind of trademark of the director (and I personally don't think it is a bad thing for any director), but the violence in his previous movies has never been tasteless like this. Scalping? Hitting a defenseless man with a bat? Surely cinema wins the war, but in a very inglourious way.

This brings me back to where I started: Christoph Waltz. I can forget the tedious dialogues, pointless movie references (Brad Pitt as Aldo ""Raine""?) and the presence of wooden Eli Roth, but not the ending which I strongly disagree with. See what happens to the best (and obviously cleverest) character in the film, and you know what I mean. But after all, this is a Brad Pitt film.",1263513600,20,1624,4.83453237410072

It was more about a Jewish woman's plan to get revenge on the Nazis for killing her family.  The ""Basterds"" seemed to hardly even be in the film.  As other reviewers have said, the movie is very dialogue driven, with most of it subtitled German and French.  It can be interesting at times, and dull at others.

I enjoyed parts of the movie, but there weren't enough of those parts to really recommend the film to most viewers.  Honestly the only people I can whole-heartedly recommend this to, are Jewish people with an undying hatred of everything German. If you're in that category, you should without a doubt see this movie, and consider my 2-star rating a 4 or 5 star one instead.

The ""Basterds'"" and Shoshanna's paths are not related until they both plan to take out almost the whole Nazi party, even Hitler himself, at a movie premiere.  Their plans succeed, however Shoshanna and nearly all of the ""Basterds"" die in the process.

I would have loved to see more of the Basterds' exploits and they were clearly my favorite characters, aside from Christoph Waltz.  Brad Pitt did a good job of playing Lieutenant Aldo Raine, but could have brought more to the character.  His second in command Donny Donowitz, Eli Roth, is my favorite Basterd along with the recruited Gestapo murderer Hugo Stiglitz.  I would be overjoyed if Tarantino made a prequel to this, but I'm sure those chances are quite slim.

I highly recommend this movie to everyone.  It does not follow history at all, but does portray the war in a different light that is not at all disrespectful to veterans.",1263427200,5,1186,4.798029556650246

3955063,4,B002MZZMRM,"Synopsis:  The movie is set in an alternate history during World War 2.  Shosanna Dreyfus (Mlanie Laurent) retreats to Paris after her family is brutally murdered by the Nazi SS and their leader, Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz.)  She assumes a new identity as a movie house operator when she attracts the attention (and interest) of Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brhl), who wants to use her theater to show a movie filmed about his heroic exploits in the war to high-ranking German officers, including Adolf Hitler himself (Martin Wuttke).  Though she is forced to go through with it, she does so while planning to extract her revenge for her family's murder.  Meanwhile, Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) watches over a group of Jewish-American soldiers who do everything possible to torment the Nazis with their brutal tactics (including scalping the dead and carving swastikas in the heads of survivors.)  They eventually get intelligence about the movie and go to France in an effort to cause mayhem for the Nazis.  Will Shosanna extract her revenge, or will the Nazis figure out her past?  Will Landa and his men thwart the Basterds, or will they succeed in doing their business... which is killing Nazis?

Here's the deal.  I went and saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Valkyrie/dp/B001TUZG4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Valkyrie</a>&nbsp;and was disappointed because while the story was one that deserved to be told, it was basically a bunch of American and British actors running around going ""Oh look, we are ze Germans!""  This movie, on the other hand, was a fake story that had casting that was beyond remarkable.  Without the cast that this movie had, it would have either suffered horribly or simply not have made the splash that it made.  I thought Waltz was the perfect choice for the movie's chief antagonist, while Pitt was brilliant as the comedic relief in what would have been an otherwise dramatic film.

In the end, you have the typical elements that successfully make a Tarantino film:  A strong heroine who's getting her revenge, a story broken up in chapters/vignettes, and a combination of acting and cinematography that makes the impossible seem possible.  This one is just as good as any of his other films and I recommend checking it out.",1263427200,6,2299,5.1897018970189706
3955064,3,B002MZZMRM,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas because we are both huge Tarantino fans. Also, Brad Pitt helped confirm that I, too would like this movie.

It was very good, well written and well acted, but not what we expected.

Whenever I see a Q Tarantino movie, I brace myself for lots of brutal violence (ie Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction etc) We thought this movie would be about ""killin' Natsees"" as the commercials showed.

SPOILER ALERT:

There was only one scene of the actual group of Jewish Soldiers, led by Pitt, ""killin Natsees."" Most the film takes place after Hitler has already heard about ""the bastards"" and Hitler's need to have them hunted down.

Also, although I don't mind a good subtitled movie at all, I didn't expect FOUR different languages from Tarantino. (English, German, Italian and French.) All but the English subtitled and the German and French used extensively. I am a FAST reader, and we had to rewind the film a few times, so I could pick up the written dialogue. My poor husband almost gave up and let me narrate, and then he didn't care for that, so we just keep rewinding, because the dialogue was very realistic and rapid fire.

The plot was very complicated, and with the Babel of languages, I really think we HAVE TO watch this film a second and even more times just to get the jist of it.

From what we did get, it was very well done. The cast is larger than I thought it would be, and there were several plots going on at once.

This may herald a new phase for Tarantino. More substance and less violence. More well developed characters and......less violence. Not that there wasn't ANY violence, no, this film was violent. We'd give it a 7 on a scale of 10, with Reservoir Dogs a 9 and Pulp Fiction an 8. He may have left his ""heads exploding, ears being cut off, people being set on fire while alive and needles plunged into hearts"" in his past for more substantial work.

As usual the story was very well done. The ""Historical Inaccuracy"" (which some people were quite bothered by) didn't bother us, as Tarantino often dabbles in some nearly paranormal or alternative material (what WAS in the briefcase in Pulp Fiction?) in his movies.

All in all, good film, just be prepared to READ (meaning more than one reason to have the kiddies busy with something child oriented in an other room or asleep when you put this DVD to watch.)",1263340800,,2370,4.529274004683841

Inglourious Basterds changed my perception of Tarantino as a director. I found the movie visually appealing and the story line  believable.  The Basterds brought to mind The Dirty Dozen on steroids with severe anger management issues but,as we all know, war is ugly.
Tarantino film displays this ugliness with a talented ease that was both graphic and detailed.  Pitt portrayal of LT. Aldo Raine, with his snide and cutting commentaries and his basic he** with the rules theories, is excellent.  Christopher Waltz as Col. Hans Landa made my skin crawl from his first appearance, stealthy and as cunning as a snake, all while he mentally examines his victims for weak spots.

3955067,4,B002MZZMRM,"Part World War II movie, part revenge movie, ""Inglorious Basterds"" is basically the fulfillment of people's fantasy of seeing someone charging in to kill the Nazis responsible for so many heinous crimes. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) leads a platoon of Jewish American soldiers, also known as the basterds, who charge in and kill every Nazi they encounter. The movie also includes an interesting character-driven plot which intersects with the more direct fighting. Shosanna is a Jewish woman living in Paris as a theater owner whose family were killed. There she encounters Landa (Christoph Waltz), the ""Jew Hunter"" who was responsible for wiping out her family years ago.

The storyline with Pitt's character is both bloody and funny at times. The platoon is successful at killing Nazis and instilling fear into them. It includes a long scene in a bar where some of the basterds are set to meet with an undercover actress who has a plan to ambush the Nazi high command. The scene becomes very tense when the basterds disguised as Nazis are confronted by a real Nazi officer. Things don't turn out quite as intended, but they still get details on the ambush plan. The actress reveals that Hitler and other officials are scheduled to appear for a Nazi film premier at a small Paris theater. Naturally, the theater is owned by Shosanna, who - unbeknownst to the basterds - develops her own plan against the Nazis. Landa, who is partly in charge of orchestrating the film premier at the theater, manages to track down the basterds to the theater and devises his own plan.

Although the story itself is entirely fictional, Tarantino did make the film rather accurate in other ways. One of the funniest scenes is when Raine is undercover as an Italian and it becomes clear he doesn't really know much Italian. The acting is great, especially Christoph Waltz who deserves all the awards recognition he's gotten. The story and directing is what one has come to expect from Tarantino. He manages to make even bloody scenes be fun and writes characters who are interesting and three-dimensional. The film succeeds in providing both entertaining action and intriguing characters.",1263254400,,2163,4.9559228650137745

Featuring appearences by Mike Myers, Julie Dreyfuss, Rod Taylor, Diane Kruger and Bo Stevenson this is one hell of a Quentin Tarantino action-war thriller. Some people love this movie or hate it but i loves it since Quentin never fails me! i believe this is a unique and ultraviolent character study that breaks up in 5 parts like Pulp Fiction back in 1994 did with 3 parts in one movie. I love how this mixes history and fiction combined as the director knows how to do it right and i know the film is a bit slow paced for some but this was a delight to watch. It has a mix of art-house and mainstream all combined in one, if you like a good quality action-drama-character flick then i suggest checking this movie out.

The movie looks and sounds terrific in High-Def even with that theater quality on the sound with the parts during the war sequences.

3955070,3,B002MZZMRM,"when i heard that director quenten tarantino was going to make a film about nazis i was estatic! my brain was buzzing with the possibilities! a director known for his extremely gory and violent films is going to make a nazi movie! nazi movies are notorious for being ultra violent.this would no doubt be the ""a clockwork orange"" of the new millenium! the movie that was decades ahead of its time.it would be considered too violent even in 30 years.
  BUT NO!It was not that violent.it was a bunch of long talking scenes,reading most of the film because it was in german and french and a couple cool fight scenes.
  a lot of hype was being built up around the ""baseball bat scene"".well,ive scene worse violence on ""tom and jerry"".the scene was over in like 10 seconds  after the 10 minute build up to a highly anti-climatic ending.it was being talked about like it was going to be an all time great movie scene like meg ryan faking an orgasm at the deli.but it was hype and hype only.like they say ""everything in hollywood is so fake"".
  then when there were no action scenes it was all talk.so the movie went talk talk talk talk talk talk.........baseball bat scene........talk talk talk talk talk talk...........nazis.......talk talk talk talk talk........movies...........talk talk talk talk ..........big finale!
  there was very little violence.and even less ultra violence.
  the actors and actresses were a bunch of people i am mostly unfamiliar with.there was brad pitt who did ok i guess.the chick from ""sweeny todd"" may have shown up briefly too.the guy who played hitler was paid 3 pennies because thats all he was worth in this film.
  also,when all of the nazis were supposed to meet up,a bunch of the big wigs were missing.it was incredibly historicaly innaccurate.the facts were all messed up.especially the end which took the film into an alternate reality.
  the violence that was done to the nazis was the same type of stuff that they allegedly did to  thier victims in ww2,making the  so called ""good guys"" no better than the nazis.
  this was supposed to be quenten tarantinos masterpiece.his ""mona lisa"" or ""moonlight sonata"".he said it was the film he'd always wanted to make.he'd been planning it for ten years he said.
  the childish ""get the nazi"" antics  that are all too common in movies ever since the 2o's are just plain stupid.they are way too played out in this movie.and if this ""masterpiece"" was aimed at that juvenile approach and aimed at redefining himself as a snoozer film maker,than he suceeded.
  this movie could have been the ultimate ww2 film of all time.easily beating out any ww2 or skin head film in existence.but what it did accomplish was a half baked,watered down,movie that has gone places hundreds of movies already have.
  ww2 was bad.the nazis did bad things.everyone knows.so all these childish pokes at someone who cant fight back ,without a time machine, are just infantile.grow up ! try complaining about something from the last half a century! get with the times! you'd think with that gigantic head of his he'd be able to think up the next citizen kane!",1263168000,,3111,4.8226415094339625
3955071,3,B002MZZMRM,"Even the very start of the credits grabbed my attention as a familiar tune from the John Wayne version of ""The Alamo"" announced the start of our film. The drama commenced with a sinister SS Colonel Hans Landa questioning a French peasant who is believed to be hiding Jews. His charm and manners are engaging and sinister at the same time. Every polite compliment to the peasant is encouraging and threatening. The actor Christoph Waltz who plays the sinister colonel appears to speak French flawlessly, but asks the peasant if he minds if they speak English, which he knows the peasant does. This only heightens the suspense. From this sequence, we learn just how much guile Colonel Landa possesses. And that is the end of Chapter 1. From here the movie slowly begins to lose its velocity.

Lt. Aldo Raine, from Tennessee has eight American soldiers of the Jewish faith before him. These will be his two thirds of a Dirty Dozen that will be dropped into France for the express purpose of killing German soldiers.  Why he has been given this assignment, or if these men are volunteers, or simply have a bone to pick, we don't know.

Soon we see one ausgepinkelt (polite for ticked off) Fhrer wanting the head of the Jewish Bear and the others who are scalping his soldiers, and bashing their brains in with a baseball bat. The leader meets with a gefreiter (pvt) who survived the holocaust of his patrol, and we are taken to the scene to see the scalping, the bashing, and the tattoo scarring. (This is fantasy at its richest for survivors and those actually touched by reality and history).

Chapter III, (the film actually pauses to give you the chapter number), takes us to England where a British officer, actor, and critic of German films in civilian life is asked by a British colonel, alias Michael Myers, to drop into France, hook up with the Inglourious Basterds, and carry out a scheme hatched by a young French woman who suffered at the hands of Colonel Landa. The scheme is that all the Germans will gather at her theater one night, to include Hitler, Goering, Bormann, and Goebbels.

There is another moment of heightened suspense when the British officer in SS Nazi drag meets with a double agent in a French local.  The intrusion of an SS major makes the heart pound again is it did in Chapter I. You almost can't wait for its resolution. After this chapter, I couldn't wait for the film to end.

There were several annoying features to deal with. The subtitles, in white, often provided little contrast to the white that was background in this black and white film. The subtitles went very fast, and I often found myself replaying and pausing to just read them. The film languished as they introduced a German hero who spoke perfect French, as he tried to woo the affections of the French woman/theater owner. The interesting part was the reintroduction of Colonel Landa meeting the French beauty and asking her seemingly benign questions over apfelstrudel. You wonder what Landa suspects, or how much.

If you are looking for reality at any level, you will be sorely disappointed right down to the small 1970's map used by the Basterds. The Americans who die in the film within a film are wearing post 1960 field jackets, as they are felled by a left-and right-handed German sniper who spoke excellent French and knew of Sgt. Alvin York, but did not wear the Knights Cross to the Iron Cross, which he most certainly would have been awarded.

It seemed like Tarrantino was trying to mesh several genres at the same time and make them meld. The ""Alamo"" melody at the beginning was intriguing, and reminded me of westerns. The ""three fingered mistake"" reminded me of an old Alan Ladd movie where they repeatedly reminded an American agent not transfer his fork to his knife hand, which typifies good American table manners. (Of course, we know what he did the moment he entered a German gasthaus). There was also the writing on the screen, as if John Madden was showing you what went wrong with a football play--arrow pointed at an actor in a theater box, then the writing: ""Martin Bormann,"" and a circle around the name. It could have been Batman hitting a villain and seeing the word, ""ZONK!"" Still sounding like a lieutenant from Tennessee, Brad Pitt couldn't pass for Italian, if his life depended on it, and for a while, it did. ""A-day-vree-derchi"" sounds like an American saying the phrase for the first time.

If you want to trip the light fantastic and sigh about what could have been in your wildest imagination for ending WW II, than this is for you. The performance of Herr Waltz was outstanding, and should garner him an Oscar. His French and Italian sounded extraordinary. His ability to play the disarming psychopath was phenomenal.

The very best part of the movie, is Chapter I, and with that I will say, ""Adieu.""",1263168000,3,4842,4.69811320754717
3955072,3,B002MZZMRM,"I'm not sure how the advertising campaigning went in the States but here in Japan, Quentin Tarantino went on TV offering a ""You'll Like it or Your Money Back"" deal. I was a bit surprised. This demonstrated either a lack of confidence or over-confidence, I'm not quite sure.
  I'm not sure why, but since I've come to live in Japan, I've ceased to enjoy films that employ war-related gore and violence like candy and I'm sorry to say that I got no joy in the last 15 minutes of the film. Obviously, the big wigs Hitler, and his snivelling lackeys need a good slaying but but the other folks getting slaughtered wasn't any fun for me. I liked the idea of going after Nazis but unlike films like Munich, the idea of revenge going too far and how far the shadow of revenge should extend, there was no real moral debate. I also like the branding of the swastika on those who planned to ""live a good life"" afterwards conveniently forgetting their bad deeds when Nazis.
  I think Tarantino is having too much whispering in his ear by fellow director Eli Roth who as the ""Bear"" had a bit of a disappointing entrance, himself. Roth's films employ the torture pornography that is the candy of budding serial killers everywhere. Tarantino's best films, while not without violence were, at least without the violent pornography present in this film.
  That having been said, for Tarantino's first period film, it was very beautifully shot and had wonderful sets and props. I feel he let scenes go on for too long, though. The basement bar and Nazi lunch/interview scenes went on for a painfully long time. I kept thinking, ""when are they getting out of here?"" If they were joking about differences between Nazi and Allied cultures or different parts of Germany, or how family-run barkeeps always have a sexy daughter as waitress it might have kept my attention but it was all slow and about the silly bourgeois game they were playing.
  The suspense leading up to The Big Fat Kill (using Sin City verbiage) was severely lessened by all of the slow and long pit stops along the way. The young private's character, while an essential plot tool for the big finale was REALLY annoying. Hans Landa's character was one of the only unique things that stayed with you to the end. He's kind of an ultimate Dolores Umbrige: evil wrapped in a polite and sweet package. The scene where he strangled the collaborator shocked the hell out of me. His use of English, French, German and Italian was enough to impress my love of linguistics but everything he said in any language was always directed at deflating plans, poking holes in alibis and defrauding the language ability of others. He was the truest ""Basterd"" in the film.
  With better editing and perhaps a bit more demonizing of the hundreds killed in the last 15 minutes in order to better balance their complete and utter annihilation, it could have been a truly great film.",1263168000,,2908,4.662109375

I would equate this film to a train wreck, but a train wreck at least had a direction.  This is like a multicar pile up in the middle of the woods.  No purpose and no reason.",1262908800,7,515,4.0594059405940595
3955082,5,B002MZZMRM,"I've read some other reviews and I can only be perpexed. Reviews can be opinions (objective) or opinionated (subjective). My objective opinion of ""Inglourious Basterds"" is that I was entertained a whole lot with a very clever and original script that could only be imagined by a smart and clever person. Action was good, when necessary, and suspense was ever present; occasional humor is always a plus. Acting was generally excellent, with Christoph Waltz (as Landa) the standout. He really makes you believe he loves being evil. Tarantino's dialogue is, as usual, rapid-fire, which made some of the sub-titled portions hard to follow, but the DVD format took care of that. Period detail was excellent as was the crisp, wide-screen cinematography. I was entertained and the ending is as satisfying as any I've seen. OK, Opinionated: I think Quentin Tarantino is extremely smart, not entirely crazy, and more in touch with his ideas and material than most give him credit. Credibility be damned, he knows how to spin a tale, always original, based on his experience as a film freak. At 2  hours, I was never bored. A fantasy about the Holocaust (that's not ""Springtime for Hitler"")? Ingenious! Tarantino knows how to craft a film this crazy into an entertaining whole. He has my admiration, since ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Kill Bill"", ""Grindhouse"", and even ""Jackie Brown"". Originality isn't given enough credit in Hollywood, and, yes, Tarantino has developed a style, but that's not a bad thing. I loved his tribute to ""Duel in the Sun"" at the end...",1262822400,,1541,4.996108949416342

3955084,3,B002MZZMRM,"When the trailers hit the air waves, I was sure that this would be a fun ""shoot-em-up"", light on plot, long on ""Killing Nazis"" - always a hoot - movie. As Bruce Willis once said, ""Sorry Hans, wrong guess!"" Brad Pitt gives a near-cartoon performance as the blood and guts GI team leader but he never breaks character, never winks at the camera and soldiers on bravely right to the end (pun intended). But this is a wanna-be serious movie that addresses the possibility of a dead Hitler and shortened war. It attempts a classic American theme - how a ""Superman"" (or in this case, a Super Woman) can, by one brave act, change history. But Tarantino is no Melville and this is no Moby Dick. It is a mockingly serious film about one of the most dangerous times in world history. I wasn't exactly expecting that based on the movie trailers - however, was that my bad?

I suspect, this may eventually become a cult film - mostly because of the power of the Tarantino name and partly because of the amazing performance by Christopher Waltz as the very, very bad Nazi (isn't that redundant?). Waltz's character is so evil that you really want to beat him senseless with your Louisville Slugger. In the end, you have to ask yourself if he actually gets his just punishment. I haven't made up my mind on that score!

Approached as just another war flick would be to miss the point. Tarantino has created a film that has many layers that add to the mystery, interest and (dare I say) fun. But in the end, it isn't a perfect film; it some how misses the mark but that feeling may be due to the way it was originally sold to put butts in the seats. This is a much more serious movie than (at least) I expected. After a careful screening, I feel it has an interesting story to tell and like all Hollywood movies, has an interesting fantasy / fairy tale quality. Will you like it? I can't say. I think if I had approached it with a better understanding of the story and the plot, maybe this would be a 4 star review. Right now, it's your call.",1262736000,2,2027,4.35978835978836
3955085,3,B002MZZMRM,"As one sympathetic to the German side of WW2, I'm not sure how I feel about this movie.  I generally like Tarantino movies, and this is certainly a Tarantino styled movie.  Dialogue heavy, but it really helps you get to know the characters.  Then sudden explosions of brutal violence.  There is a lot of reading to do unless you are fluent in French, German, and Italian!  I'd say a third of this movie is in one of those languages.

I don't know the philosophical intent of this movie, or what Tarentino's purpose of the movie was.  But here are some thoughts:

1. Opening scene.  In Nazi occupied France, a squad of German soldiers search a farmer's house for a family of Jewish farmers thought to be in hiding since the invasion.  Jewish farmers.  Yes, Jewish farmers.  Not lawyers, bankers, or merchants.  Things weren't much different then as today, and the percentage of Jews that are farmers is quite low.  Way low.  Way less than their 1-3% population.  This was an unlikely scenario from the beginning.  The surviving daughter is blonde.  Blonde.  A blonde Jew!  Again, another highly unlikely event.  Not that there are no blonde Jews; they have interbred throughout their history with their host nations.  But by and large, they have dark hair.  Two unlikely coincidences in one scene.

2. Next scene.  A group of Jewish soldiers are formed with the intent to hide in German Occupied France and kill Nazis.  Once again, their ranks amongst American soldiers was far less than their 1-3% of the population.  By and large they were in college, and remained in college.  I suppose they could have scrounged up 8 or so for the mission.  No blondes this time!  (note: Brad Pitt's character is NOT Jewish).

3. ""Inglourious basterds"".  In the most heartbreaking scene of the movie, the ""Bear Jew"" stands over a stout POW German commander who refuses to disclose the location of another squad.  Even upon threats of having his head bashed in with a baseball bat he respectfully refuses.  The Bear Jew asks, as he touches the German's Iron Cross medal with his bat ""you get that for killing Jews?"".  The German looks the Bear Jew in the eyes and replies ""For courage"".  The Bear Jew immediately beats the German to death.  This German indeed showed the most courage I've ever seen on film, knowing he would die as he respectfully resisted his enemy.  Guess his boss was right.  Truly a gut wrenching scene.  This is something that I noticed about the movie: The Jews are indeed portrayed as inglourious basterds: ruthless, treacherous, and cowardly.  You don't see that often on film.  The Germans on the other hand, are professional, intelligent, organized, motivated, and above all courageous.  Except Hans Landa's last scenes (but in the 1st scene he does tell us that he thinks like a Jew!).

Of course the movie has an unfortunate fantasy ending but what did you expect!?  The real ending wasn't much better,

I don't know if I love this movie or hate it.  I suppose I love parts and hate parts.  Therefore, 3 stars.

Scenes like the showdown in the tavern and the movie-premiere finale are as imaginative, energetic and, in their own weird, brutal way, beautiful as cinema gets
Quentin Tarantino's dual loves of vengeance and cinema have never had a purer expression than the face of a Jewish cinematheque owner projected Oz-like onto the smoke of Nazis aflame

3955089,4,B002MZZMRM,"Tarrentino brings World War II Paris to life in a new fashion.  A young Jewish girl escapes a search of a farmhouse by Nazis and makes her way to Paris.  Somehow she gets the identity of Emanuelle, an owner of one of the top Paris movie houses.  One day she is changing the titles on the marquee when she is approached by a young German soldier.  He becomes smitten with her but she tries being cold back to him to no avail.  It turns out he is somewhat of a big hero in Germany because he single handedly killed many enemy soldiers while being a sniper in a bell tower over a three day period.  Goebbels has made a propaganda movie starring the soldier as himself.  Later on the soldier comes up with the idea of showing the movie in Emanuelle's theater.

The movie also focuses on a group of Jewish soldiers headed by a Tennessee leader (Brad Pitt) who infiltrate Nazi controlled areas and kill Nazis by either scalping them or leaving them to the Jew Bear with the bat (one of Pitt's men), also referred to as the Golem.  When Pitt's group ambushes Nazis he likes to always leave one man alive to tell the story of what happens.  The one left alive is not so lucky because Pitt will use a huge machete like knife to carve a swastika in the surviving German's forehead, to forever mark him as a Nazi.

Tarrentino uses the ""chapter"" method used successfully in his Kill Bill films.  Along with that the ending of the film definately has the feel of a Tarrentino film.  Tarrentino does a remarkable job of shooting each chapter almost as a separate tale but each chapter converges by the end of the film.  Tarrentino does change history quite a bit but the movie is so good that the audience can forgive him and go along with how the movie turns out.

There are scenes that seem to go on forever with a bunch of uninteresting characters spouting boring dialog about things you don't care about.  ALL IN SUBTITLES!  Pitt's character is ridiculous as is the entire premise of the movie.

I know it is a fantasy but it comes off as silliness as the plot and the situations portrayed in the film are completely asinine. It is also mildly disturbing that the horror of WWII is trivialized somewhat, if only it would have been that easy to kill the Nazis.

I truly don't understand the rave reviews here. Tarantino rips off himself and other film cliches that have been done a million times before only better.  He is a spent force.",1262563200,26,779,4.561151079136691

His style, and fame often overshadow his movies, and certainly are often discussed in connection with reviews for his movies.  A shame, as on its own merits, regardless of the man behind it, inglorious basterds is a very unique and interesting movie.  What surprised me about the movie, is that it is not the traditional movie, as the advertisements led me to believe.  This is not the story of a bunch of military men scalping nazis, but rather a series of independent stories linked to result in a climax involving an alternate end to WWII.  I imagine this movie's merits will be debated for some time, as those seeking blood lust will be disapointed by the shockingly little amount of actual violence, while the art house crowd will decry the sometimes random moments of violence.  Also most of the mainstream will be complain about the abundance of subtitles.  Regardless of these issues, there is something rather great and unique, that makes this one of the better movies of the year, and arguably the best movie of this director's carreer.

There are a few scenes in Basterds where  - not to spoil the movie -you sort of see military heroism from the Nazi side.  Those are actually a little hard to watch.  One scene is reminiscent of a scene in Private Ryan, but it is a reversal.  If anything they drive home the fact that war is terrible and are by no means any kind of slam on US vets.

We picked this up to watch with friends and before we started watching it, I cringed when I learned that one of these friends was squeamish when it comes to Tarantino films, but to her credit she was willing to give it a viewing.

Chapter One (worth the price of the DVD) sucked in the group of us with riveting performances, dialog, and cinematography.  It set the tone for the rest of the film.

I know a lot of other viewers dinged the film slightly for Quentin's little idiosyncrasies.  That doesn't bother me a bit, in fact I've come to expect them.  They're just his way of putting his stamp on the film.

What was most striking to me, was the fact that Tranantino is perfecting (given the right story) his craft.  The way he built up the scenes to shocking, often surprising conclusions was phenomenal.

The actors' performances were outstanding, though Brad Pitt is included more for comic relief than anything else.  Christoph Waltz and Melanie Laurent easily stole this film. The film was more about story and performance, masterfully told, than violence.  The squeamish friend enjoyed it, and Quentin seems to have redeemed himself in her eyes.

3955097,4,B002MZZMRM,"I am a big QT fan without a doubt. I have seen all of his movies minus Death Proof. I awaited his ""war movie"" ever since I read on his website about his desire to make one.
Today I got to watch Inglorious Basterds for the first time and while It had me on the edge of my seat the entire time, I thought to myself that some of the music and things that made Kill Bill original just came off as a redundant carbon copy and annoying this time around. If he wants to use a particular technique in his films, be it a visual theme, or a certian hybridization of his favorite genres, that is a wonderful thing. But to recycle these unique tricks in a second movie makes it seem like he is either really out of ideas, or so full of himself that you think we will love to see these tricks over and over again.
It irritates me a bit to see a period movie with music in it that is not from that period (ex: ""A Nights Tale""). While I believe that music can be done effectively, I think that we as the audience get the point that he loves to mix the 70's blaxploitation and the spaghetti western. I think it would be a unique departure for QT to leave his trademark style behind and do a movie without the tricks and gadgets. These types of techniques will make me cringe eventually, instead of making me look forward to another Tarantino release.
In this movie we have the Gore of ""Dogs"" with some of the exact same music, intertitles, and comic book charachter reveals from Kill Bill.  As a QT movie, he hasn't necessarily added any new recipes to his menu.  It is almost as if he has read too many reviews from people who aren't otherwise capable of following his non linear continuity, so he ""dumbed"" his style down with Chapter Intertitles.
I would like to see QT also leave his fetishes in the bedroom for once. Im not dissing the foot fetish, but putting it in every single movie is getting on my nerves. There are a billion other things worth capturing on celluloid than the different types of foot coverings and positions a lady's toes might find themselves in. Gimme a freakin break! ""Okay in this scene your foot will be dressed in distress, though still in a 40's pump fashion, okay? We still need a closeup on the dolled up foot, so lets see some plantar flexion in 5...4..3..okay...""

I also have to say that Id like to see a QT movie that doesn't have Samuel L Jackson or Harvey Keitel anywhere in it. We get it, he likes his troupe, but it is little things like this that made me roll my eyes during this particular piece that kept me from giving it 5 stars. Im through complaining now, perhaps.

I gave this movie a review, because if moved me to do so. I don't normally review things, but this is an exception. The actors in this movie were great, and aside from the reasons listed above of why this movie isn't an A+, everything else in this movie was Best Picture calibre. The nazi bullying was intense, and even though none of the antagonists in the film were creepy, their sense of evil comes at you from the other charachters. This was simply brilliant.

It is worth watching, but my overall opinion is now QT needs to retire all of his old tricks, leave some of his old standby actors behind, and really reinvent himself.  This will be of prime importance in my opinion if Tarantino is to be remembered as one of the Great directors of this century.

I still love his work, I still will look forward to his films, but if I watch another movie of his with the same tricks from Kill Bill, I will puke on my bootlegged DVD copy of it.",1262390400,,3542,4.277611940298508
3955098,3,B002MZZMRM,"It finally hit me while watching Basterds that QT is a complete and utter sadist. The best performance here is the film's main sadist, whom the director clearly identifies with to a large degree. QT delights as usual in showing extreme violence in great detail. Someone please tell me how Aldo Raine calmly eating his lunch while watching a man be beat to death with a baseball bat is in any way not as reprehensible as any Nazi killing. Please. The Nazis had their own self-justifications, too. Torture is torture, whoever's doing it.

It's that kind of juvenile delight in others' pain that makes Tarantino happy. It's in almost every film he's done, with the exception of Jackie Brown, which along with Pulp is the only thing he's done that moved me intelligently. You can almost hear him salivating behind the camera as the sick stuff pulled from his warped sense of justice plays out on the screen. How is that masterful? Coppola is masterful; watch how the Godfather's violence plays out, then watch a QT film. That's the difference between art and psychosis, to my eyes.

I'm sure the fanboys will dump all over this opinion, but then again, look at the folks who worship QT...and worship is the right word. The ones I see here in Austin, and there are plenty, seem to be just like their hero: the kind of guy who got beaten up in high school and gets revenge in delighting in others' suffering, real or cinematic. I saw the first few QT film fests he did here, and while his pre-screening talks were often interesting (and painfully hyper-speed; sniff sniff, hello Peru!), there was also a sense of a guy who thinks film is reality and that the rest of life is just prelude to the lights going down. Perhaps that's why he can't see how sadistic his own vision is.

He found his perfect subject here, for who can complain about revenge on the Nazis? Yet it all feels to me no less disgusting than what the Germans were up to. Listen to Raine's first speech; that's promotion of genocide, pretty much. And the graphic displays of scalps being cut off? Come on, what exactly is the point of that except delight in other's suffering? Hate begets hate, and any truly mature filmmaker seeks redemption not in revenge, but in understanding and transcendence. Or, maybe I'm just wrong and it's all about an eye for an eye. Make them all suffer! In hi-def, with lots of blood and screaming! Yay team!!

Yes, Quentin is a technically fine director, and the opening scene is good (though hardly the revelation many claim; there are plenty of war films with many more gripping scenes than that). But the whole Raines subplot is entirely unnecessary here, and seems to exist only to let QT and his fanboys delight in onscreen torture, supposedly justified by the other side's own atrocities. The main story is much more interesting, and if it alone had been the whole movie, it would be a much finer work. But Tarantino needs to torture people. He lives for it. And that's sadism, pure and simple.

I did very much enjoy the performances of Waltz and Laurent, and the main story is decent enough (if totally unbelievable; Hitler brings all his top guys to a little theatre in France with almost no security outside? Sure.). But add that pointless subplot and the film becomes over two and half hours long, and that felt about 45 minutes too long to me. Take out the gleeful violence and suddenly it makes sense. But I guess that's not what Quentin's audience signs up for; they love the blood and gore and he's more than happy to deliver.

He's got the skills, sure, but for my money he needs to dump the incessant violence and focus on character and plot development instead of seeing how many graphic killings he can insert into every film.",1262390400,,3737,4.61203007518797

I came into this expecting something like Hogan's Heroes on steroids, or a remake of the Dirty Dozen.  I got neither.  What we see of the ""Basterds"" seems to take place mostly in the basement of a tavern.  Why a tavern?  Why a basement?  The characters themselves discuss these questions, but alas if an answer was ever presented it soared right over my head.

I spent a fair portion of the film wondering what the film was about.  Yes, it's curious that one could compare the experiences of slaves imported into the US to the experience of King Kong, imported into the US, but is this a plot point, or something meant to flesh out a character, or just a case of a film director illuminating an odd thought that came to him in the dead of night?  I'm still wondering.  But it does rather remind me of graduate students in philosophy pontificating about Kant and Spinoza and the phenomenology of internal time-consciousness and who or what stares into you when you stare into the abyss, and how very intellectual it all sounds, though it does seem a bit disconnected from anything having to do with practical reality, and what in God's name does any of it have to do with a World War Two movie?

I'm still wondering about that, too.

I also enjoyed the ""twist"" on history as we know this story wasn't even close to what happened to the Third Reich.

Where this film lacked for me was in character development. Other than with Shoshanna, there was very little character development. I almost wish Tarantino had focused more on ""The Basterds"" than the story of Shoshanna. I didn't ever feel a connection with most of the characters and as such, didn't feel bad for anyone who died.

I was speachless and blown away. Was not expecting that level of intensity. It was one of the best bits of cinema I've ever watched. The rest of the movie stays close to that, and has similiar moments and bits of dialog thats witty, intelligence, fun, refreshing, and worth watching. Sometimes the movie strays and like the other reviews say, it takes away from the beauty and perfection of an otherwise would be classic film (like braveheart, yet better).

The Myers seen was not needed. The end plot was a bit too unbelievable as Hitler and the rest of his people would not all get together in a French cinema to watch a movie, the arch villian would not turn himself over to the Americans even for a home in Nantucket. It wasn't a believable turn of his character (being the best Nazi in Hitlers army to turncoat and turn traitor at a whime). Some of the violence was ok and served its purpose, and at the right time was gratifying in the light of what the Nazi's perpetrated, other bits of useless gore were a little over the top and distracting. I did love seeing both sides as humans etc.

I loved a few of the scenes/chapters immensely though, the opening chapter, the cellar chapter, the arch villian was truly masterful, the English spy actress was very good, as was the Jewish cinema owner. I wasn't taken with Brad Pitts character or his not so believable accent.

When I got it in the mail I watched it and was amazed at how brilliant the shot composition was but how it lacked characters. This was a major disappointment as we get very little character development, and too much gaudy violence. This is a film that clocks in at about 2hr 30min and as usual is very dialogue heavy, and unfortunately we must read through an endless amount of subtitles. Essentially Quentin has taken a black sheep film and made it his own, and quite honestly it comes off as fancy nonsense. I'm not sure what anybody is supposed to gain from watching this film, except that when movies are made without a worthwhile story and characters that we can actually care about than we are missing the point of films entirely. I have always enjoyed the way that films have made people think over the years and this seems like a step in a backward direction and doesn't really give audiences anything to think about.",1262131200,6,1116,4.52970297029703

3955111,5,B002MZZMRM,"The title says it all. ""Inglourious Basterds"" was definitely Tarantino's best film since ""Reservoir Dogs."" Some of the other reviewers may chalk my enthusiasm about this film to my being a ""Tarantino Fanboy"", let me make one thing clear, I am definitely NOT a Tarantino Fanboy. I absolutely hated his last three films. The ""Kill Bill"" franchise was a comic throwback to director Takashi Miike, and ""Death Proof"" acted as a far-too-lengthy outlet for Tarantino to display gratuitous scenes revolving around his foot fetish. ""Inglourious Basterds"" makes up for any wrongdoings Tarantino has ever made in film. Overall, it's brilliant.
  The story revolves around a group of renegade American (mostly Jewish) soldiers, who infiltrate Nazi occupied France during the second World War solely for one purpose, they are all in the ""killing Nazi business"" and for the Basterds, ""business is a'boomin!""
  Tarantino has essentially re-written the outcome of the war, with style, action, and (surprisingly) a hell of a lot of class. The characters are engaging from Pitt's comical Lt. Aldo Raine to Christoph Waltz, a newcomer to American Cinema, who portrays Col. Hans Landa, the spookiest Nazi to grace the screen since Ralph Fiennes in ""Shindler's List."" Waltz has raised the bar for both writers and actors and has quite possibly re-invented the onscreen villain. I'm sure we will see a lot more of Waltz considering he is also playing Chudnofsky in the upcoming ""Green Hornet"" movie.
  I've noticed that a few of the reviews have talked about ""needless dialogue"" or ""too much reading."" The movie takes place in France, which, at the time was fully occupied by German military personnel, of course they will speak French and German. There is a good portion of the movie that is also in English and, very little (if any) of the dialogue is ""needless."" Everything happens for a reason. While there are some signature stylistic flares present in the movie, those need to be expected. It's Tarantino... come on. The subtitles, while overbearing at first, really aren't noticeable about 20 minutes in. By that point the movie has begun to move along so swimmingly that they become second nature.
  Long story short, this movie is awesome. If you aren't a fan of Tarantino, see the movie just to experience Christoph Waltz, he alone is well worth the time and money you may spend to see this film. He stole the show hands down, and put Brad Pitt in his place (at least as far as this movie is concerned). The story is epic, a brilliant retelling of WWII, with action, romance (sort of), cunning, a healthy dose of comedy, a few cameos, and with acting that is definitely Oscar-worthy.

From Godwin's law to Schindler's List, it seems that Hitler and his cronies are the perennial topic of conversation for all right-thinking people.  It is difficult to say overall whether this film is a spoof or not.  The film features a group of ""Basterds"" led by an Apache Indian and some Jews whose job it is to go around scalping Nazis.  The film focuses on the misadventures of the ""detective"" Jew hunter SS man, as he attempts to prevent a plot by the Basterds to destroy the Nazis.  Ultimately, the detective comes across as such a despicable character in the film that you are glad he deserves his ultimate fate.  The ending is exceedingly strange.  Not historically correct.

My wife and I both loved this movie, despite the fact that it is almost entirely subtitled.

The acting is superb and the story is brilliant. Some people accuse Brad Pitt of poor acting, but I would say he is one of the best actors of our generation. ""But he acted like a caricature in this movie"" - as if you think he didn't act exactly how Tarantino wanted him to act. His character in this movie was Brilliant, and defintely stole the show even though he wasn't in a lot of the movie. Even the scenes where you just hear his voice are exceptional. It was both hilarious and serious all at the same time, which made me laugh even harder. His Italian accent was probably the funniest part of the whole movie. You add this to Seven, Fight Club, Snatch, Interview With a Vampire, Benjamin Button, Kalifornia, True Romance and the rest of his movies and this simply solidifies Brad Pitt as one of the finest actors of our time. You add this to the list of Tarantino's movies and realize that he was Solidified as the Greatest director of our time a while ago, this just keeps it going. Great movie, great actors, great story.

3955121,1,B002MZZMRM,"On Spike TV's Awards late this year, B Pitt promoted this film jumping feverishly to the savory apporoving grins of Tarantino .  During that ceremony one of the best and underrated movies of all time, Fight Club was ""inducted"" to the Men's movie hall of fame.

During this mock awards ceremony's acceptance speech, Pitt, Norton and Fincher, the trio responsible for the most radical film criticism of the excesses of consumerism, read reviews of Fight Club. When released, the movie was trashed by the most broadcasted critics.  Among them Roger Ebert.
A solid advocate of the status quo.  The status quo dynamics that have us in today's economic crisis.
Favored by the interests behind the movie production.  The only way to achieve such fame and success as a critic.

He called Fight Club movie ""Macho Porn""...ohh but he loved this sadist feast.  I dub Inglorious Basterds Macho Porn.

Porn main approach is the objectification of women.  Here Tarantino makes objects out of the Nazis.  I imagine this childish and highly amusing genious planning this prank.  Trying to find the plot that would accomplish three objectives:

A-The ultimate exploitation film, his core genre.  As violent as possible.  obscenely violent. As violent as a Zombie movie, which we know he loves.  But with human beings. That no one would care about their massacre, just like with Zombies:
Nazis!!!
B-Chum with the Weinsteins even more, and the all across very powerful Jewish movie making group and rest of the Jewish community.
C-Play them.  Yes.  a Psychological Ambush.
Probably with a didactic intentions. Tarantino, above all seems a nice guy, crazy nice.
Is Pitt on the ambush as well? my bet is yes.

The holocaust was and is such an abhorrent, abominable event there are no words in the English dictionary to describe it accurately.

Their leader was a monster.  An abnormality capable of amassing colossal amounts of hate and injecting it to the ignorant masses.  Yet all human beings.
Yet Hitler is not alone. Kim Sung il, Milosevic, Idi Amin, and other ""precious"" specimens for scientific study, have come to remind us of the deep ends of the dark side of human nature.
And the ability of charismatic sociopaths to turn otherwise normal
human beings in to sociopaths.

There is another of my favorite movies, 8mm, in which the character is faced with a similar, not as excruciating dilemma, as the jewish people face.
When victim or witness of acts of unjustice and cruelty so outlandish, retaliation is our most deep and instinctive reaction to make things right and seek revenge.  Most times more volently and cruel than the original acts suffered.
The need for such catharsis is desperate.

But is it justifiable, effective from a moral,ethical, constructive perspective.?  And more important, healthy to stoop down to a socyopath's level??.  I understand that much of the film plays out as caricaturesque, and fun.  But how much real acid wrath is underneath??

So tarantino channels all these repressed anger produced by this tragedy. Other films have elegntly and assertively dennounced it's aberration,serve to warn about the dangers of imperialistic fascism. But have not accomplish to help release the natural anger repressed underneath by many affected.

I take the liberty of putting  fictional words or thoughts on the director's head.  The ideas he might had when concocting this indulging fantasy, in order to achieve his mis-directed chatartic spectacle, and exacerbate the affected minds into his no end trap:

"" You hate Nazis...yes, you've said so covertly in so many movies, for so much time.  So there you go.  Have yourselves a party of sadistic torture.  Taste on screen the dirty revenge you've silently asked for decades. And after that think about that pleasure you experimented. The vouyeristic escapist gratification of seeing other humans, who tortured your family, Now tortured and burn alive in return. Thousands brainwashed by a mad demonic genious.  Ponder what it says about yourselves.  I wash my hands.  The group is unruly, is clearly labeled basterds!""

""a celebration of violence in which the heroes write themselves a license to drink, smoke, screw and beat one another up.""  Said Ebert about Fight Club.

I'll modify to close about basterds: a celebration of violence in which the heroes write themselves a license to torment obscenely both guilty and innocent because their enemies have committed heinous acts.  No trial, no jail: Death.  Facism as well.  I have a sense of humour as well.  But when dealing with such volatile issue,my radar goes to a red light.

My second worry based on recent history, about this film:
Last year the Oscars were more politically influenced than Ive experienced before.  A crappy, sappy, very easy to digest movie from Bollywood stepped up over art.  Bollywood is a great resource for Hollywood in these times of crisis.  Cheap labor, Cheap materials, etc.  Cheap award.
The Gay Martin luther king won as actor over other more compelling performances, amidst a very important civil right movement event.

There is buzz of a bastard nomination.

I ask the noble, brave and great Jewish people.  What is the message you want your children to receive?. Small people that naturally grew to hate Nazis, but not as much as you, since the tragedy is far behind them.  Do you want them released of the burden of hate? or their hate heighten and renewed by the glamour of Hollywood, and the excitement of their parents over THIS piece of violent excretion.
A piece of crap of mental violence fantasy (fantasy catharsis is no catharsis anyway)

3955126,5,B002MZZMRM,"Inglourious Basterds is a movie for movie lovers. It is certainly a farce and a revenge fantasy, but it is brilliantly directed and acted. Some of the criticism I've seen about this movie is the same that is leveled against all WWII films that don't show Jewish suffering. ""Downfall"", for example. With all due respect to the people that find that offensive... WWII was about a lot more than the Holocaust, although I certainly understand the fixation. Some people want movies to be simple ""white hats"" vs. ""black hats"", where the bad guys are unambiguously evil, and the good guys are the paragons of all virtue. In other words, they want propaganda, which paradoxically is one of the central themes of this movie. Thankfully, Tarantino does not fall for this simplification. He gives us three dimensional, fully fleshed characters that you can love or hate regardless of the uniform they are wearing.

Hans Landa is the ultimate Nazi villain. Just underneath the veneer of good manners and pleasant conversation, just behind the winning smile, is a beast capable of murdering helpless women and children. His actions are more chilling because by his own confession, he really doesn't hate Jews. He persecutes them for the challenge of the ""hunt"" and for the intellectual satisfaction of outwitting them. The outrageously large pipe he pulls out during the interrogation of the French farmer is not a phallic symbol of sexual inadequacy, but Tarantino's tribute to Sherlock Holmes. The cinematography of the French farm scene is outstanding and the acting by Christoph Waltz should earn him an Oscar.

My favorite scene of the whole movie is the basement tavern gunfight. It was like watching an impending train wreck in slow motion. The banality of the conversation just adds to the sense of impending doom. Diane Kruger gives a surprisingly brilliant performance, as do all those involved. The slow, tortuous build up, which I'm sure many people find boring, is for me a master stroke.

As all Tarantino movies, Inglourious Basterds is also and elaborate tribute to movies. I'm not going to list all the references, but the highlight of his tribute to movies if the story between Frederick Zoeller and Shoshanna. Despite his charm and good manners, Shoshanna has an understandable dislike of the the young German war hero, who she can only see as a uniform despite Frederick insistence that he is ""more than an uniform"". For Shoshanna the real life Zoeller is not a human being, but one of the cogwheels of evil. It is only when she sees him in the big screen ""acting"", that she can recognize his humanity. She falls for the propaganda movie Frederick Zoeller instead of the real life one... with tragic consequences.

This is definitely an movie to buy and keep.",1261872000,2,2766,4.941935483870968
3955127,5,B002MZZMRM,"WARNING SPOILERS. 4.5 STARS. This movie is highly entertaining, the proof: I saw it with my mother, she does not know who is Quentin Tarantino, she does not know what Pulp Fiction means, she just saw the 150 minute film without stop (I thought it was much less time), she laughed through it all and when it ended she exactly said: ""since a lot time ago I haven't seen such a good film!"". Whoever does not feel and catch the tension in the first ""chapter"" and the scene in the bar, has no sensibility for good films and dialogues at all, I can say that without regret, guaranteed! How the tension rises in those scenes is something to be seen and heard, it is totally masterful.

Yes, there is goof, there is camp, there is absurdity, there is a very straight unseriousness and even unrespectfulness for one the most terrible and dramatic  periods of human history; nevertheless perhaps that is Tarantino's specialty: show the absurd, to laugh at the most horrible without shame, to laugh at the human misery and absurdity of violence and war. Kubrick did it on a smaller and subtler (humorist) scale on Full Metal Jacket; Tarantino plays it big with no shame at all. The capacity to laugh at ourselves is one of the things that makes us humans.

And yes: a total ""Yeah! Get some!"" to see in any movie Hitler being shot in the face with no mercy, only Tarantino could deliver us that.

Being honest I would give the movie 4 stars, the extra half star is because it is so unique in the WWII film catalogue and to do some justice in the average Amazon rating. I substract half star because the narration is not relevant and because is not Tarantino's best, that place still belongs to Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, whatever your choice is.

Not every war film has to be politically correct and a history lesson, so reviewers that complain about this are missing the point of the film, a little of spice in our lives can do no harm. Final note: the music soundtrack, is very very good.",1261785600,9,1984,4.5
3955128,5,B002MZZMRM,"I'll admit that the marketing and build-up for this film was a tad misleading. Anyone who's interested in this movie needs to forget about their visions of a WWII action flick with Brad Pitt shooting Nazis across Europe. This is a meticulous, tense and slow building epic. It's just as much about the characters, the dialogue, and even the Nazis themselves, as much as it is about killing them.

It would be a waste of time trying to summarize all of the memorable scenes throughout the movie in this review space since I would in no way do them justice. There are a handful of scenes that have such a fantastic build-up and establish an amazing feeling of suspense. I feel that the aforementioned ""build-up"" to a lot of these scenes is what's most important in the film. Anyone with knowledge of previous Tarantino movies knows that he's a master of dialogue and this film is no exception. The ensemble cast is excellent, with an obvious nod to Brad Pitt. Christoph Waltz's performance as the sinister ""Jew Hunter"" has also been getting a lot of awards buzz but there are plenty of others that pull their weight in their respective characters. Melanie Laurent as Shoshanna is fantastic and I also enjoyed Michael Fassbender as British lieutenant Archie Hicox. Due to the large cast of memorable characters, Tarantino is able to weave three separate threads of narrative, occasionally intertwining with one another until they all converge onto a cinema in Paris for an explosive ending.

All in all, this is one of the better films I've seen in years, and easily my favorite of 2009. On the technical side, the Blu-Ray visuals look stellar. There's a lot of quality bonus features included in this package as well.

3955130,5,B002MZZMRM,"We, a German-American family, saw the movie. We agreed that the actor who played the main SS officer was the real star, because he exhibited the awful core of psychological terror in so realistic and seductive a way that we as audience felt the horror. A second German actor played a similar role in a cellar bar equally well. The movie is otherwise intended and comes across as a complete farce. Brad Pitt plays a hillbilly from Maynardville, Tenn., who leads a group of Jewish brutes (no doctors, lawyers, professors in that crowd!) into France to commit acts against the Nazis that are at least equal to those committed against the Jews. Pitt plays the Tennesee hillbilly role to a T, especially with the local dialect, so much so that he more or less plays one of my in laws (I grew up across the border from Maynardville). See it, it's a farce interspersed with the awful terror of that era. To the producer's credit, this film is played in English, German, French, and Italian, a wonderful development! Nothing more silly than an actor portraying an SS officer speaking English (or, vice versa, than a German actor playing an American soldier). The languages are spoken by people who really speak them, aside from Pitt who did a damn good and funny job of simulating Hilliebillie language.

Note added: 'Hillbilly English' stems from an old Scottish English dialect (""I recken hit'll rain ta'mar"".), the German immigrants in the Appalachians in the early 19th century were taught English by the Scotish immigrants.

3955132,1,B002MZZMRM,"This movie is perhaps the worst movie I have ever witness. Tarantino attempts to clumsy generalize German soldiers by identifying them as Nazis so that the audience will feel no compassion to the German soldiers being scalped and having their heads bashed in with a club. Such a sadistic use of violence is what I would expect from directors such as Eli Roth(Who is in this movie) but after watching Kill Bill I suppose Tarantino is also a lover of Torture Porn as well. The actual ""basterds"" in this movie would be hung for war crimes for their treatment of POWs. Something I had hoped the audience would have denounced instead of praised. Rather disturbing to say the least...........

The main problem I have with the film is the historical ""liberaties"" this movie takes. I really do not want to elaborate as I would spoil the movie. Such a complete generalization of German soldiers as Nazis disgraces honorable German officers and soldiers such as Erwin Rommel and actually dumbs down the audience. There was a big difference between the Waffen-SS the Wehrmacht and the Schutzstaffel. Taratino clumsily throws all three groups into one giant evil Nazi group. Poor taste and completely disrespectful to what really happened.

If a your definition of a good movie is one with good plot, makes you think,violence that is actually useful and is used to advanced the plot, and a decent dialogue then I would urge you to stay away from this movie. Unfortunately the hype and the over rated status of Tarantino is honestly clouding peoples judgement of this film. Nothing more then a B movie with Tarantinos name on it.

The movie is based on a fantasy and at times is so thoroughly unbelievable to the point that I felt like I was watching a cartoon spoof flick.  The movie could have used an injection of humor, with the subject matter this would have been a much more enjoyable film if it hadn't taken itself so seriously. Brad Pitt's portrayal of the commander of the Jewish comandos was the only part of the movie that hinted at humor and it was unintentional.

A disclaimer...I like Tarentino, so perhaps this can't be qualified as unbiased, but still, I so thoroughly enjoyed this 2 1/2 hour movie that I had to chime in with kudos for director and cast.

Ultra-violent (hey, if you were expecting something else, you picked the wrong director), witty, well-paced and expertly acted (over-the-top by a mile, but hey, that requires a skill set of its own), the 150 minutes fly by, and even the non-action scenes (the bar for example) have a frentic pace and tension of their own.

Tarentino makes you ""like"" his characters quickly, and become involved in the story because of this.  Even the minor roles have such depth that you want to find out more about them.  So many movies feature a great plot, but lack of interesting players ultimately dooms it to a ""one-watch"" movie...the reason you can watch and rewatch movies like this and Pulp Fiction is the engrossing nature of what is accomplished through expert direction and acting.  That, and the constant surprise twists and quick deaths of main characters keep your focus long into the second hour.

Inglourious Basterds does retribution like no other movie about WWII has thus far, and even though it devles into the satirical at times, its point is made well.  Highly recommended (for the non-squeamish).",1261612800,,1510,4.917322834645669

3955140,5,B002MZZMRM,"I have been a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino since ""Reservoir Dogs"".  That said I was heartily disappointed with his previous grindhouse experiment.  I saw this effort in the cinema and though I liked it I wasn't overly enthusiastic.  My excuse was that I found the constant switch from English to foreign language with subtitles jarring.  Some films, however, deserve a second viewing.  Not since ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" over ten years ago have I reversed my initial opinion of a film.  What I think these film's share are deeply layered scripts that contain alot of subtleties that if you're not alert you miss things.  This is a very ambitious effort by Tarantino.  I won't say he has matured as a filmmaker because he's always been one of our more talented auteurs but this is a progression.  In a nutshell I would describe it as a war film that seems to be a homage to Sergio Leone informed by a film geek's sensibility.  It's a true original even though Tarantino's influences would be apparent to the most astute viewer.  The film is anchored by two brilliant performances one by Brad Pitt as the commando leader and Christoph Waltz as a Gestapo officer.  If Waltz doesn't take home Oscar gold for his work here something's seriously wrong.  In the past I was hesitant to recommend some of Tarantino's work, usually for his penchant for extreme violence and language, and even though this film is harsh at times I wouldn't have as an extreme reservation.",1261612800,,1478,4.749019607843137

For the most part the acting is first-rate and the script is right on target in relation to the main premise. In my own view, a couple of scenes dragged out a bit too long and a few bits of violence were cheesy and/or unnecessary, but many people have different tastes from mine--notice that other reviewers have rated this film from five stars all the way down to one star.

But I have problems with un-necessary violence in a story. I liked the What If/ Alternate timeline of this movie, and the ending was very satisfying, but I didn't go for Pitts ""cracker"" image. As if only some redneck southern dude would want to go over there and kill Nazis. 9/11 should let us all be aware of how intense the urge to kill is. We are all capable of wanting to do it,but why does Aldo have such a hatred? He was more intense that most of the Jews that he recruited. The scaping was stupid by the way, And bringing Apache's in for a guy from Tenn. was real silly. Apaches are around Arizona,and New Mexico. Even Bowie in his day was hanging out in Texas and was more likely to have run into Cherokee's or Kiowa's or such. Luckily he didn't think of the ones who were known to eat parts of the men they killed for their power,else we might have had even gorier scenes to view. Yuck.. I do appreciate what he was trying to do, but the brutality was just to over the top for my taste. I still cringe at violent scenes, I do not consider them as everyday sights, and am horrified at their portrayal, and the fact that so many people are so blase at the sights of blood and mutilation just helps to explain the calm at which most people take sights of real blood and carnage. We wonder why those who choose to kill other people are so calm and usually unrepentant. I think it shows when we glorify Movies like this.",1261440000,4,1581,4.153094462540716
3955144,5,B002MZZMRM,"Inglourious Basterds is probably one of the 50 best films I've ever seen. It's also one of the few Tarantino films I've actually loved or even enjoyed. I walked out of Pulp Fiction, but I saw Inglourious Basterds ten times in the theater before it eventually closed. I probably would have seen it a few more times, and plan on buying the Blu-Ray as well. It's just flat-out great entertainment, intelligently done, immensely satisfying.

It's so rare for a film to be engrossing, sophisticated, willing to defy political correctness (or even rise above it), appealing to both the intellectual's and the common man's tastes, violent and action-packed yet refined, funny and also devastating, profound, upsetting and yet pleasurable and deeply aesthetic, but IB is all of these things, and more.

The performances and the casting that made them possible really rise to the highest level. In recent years I've come to realize how critically important the art of casting is to filmmaking. There should be some prominent award for it, imo, maybe an Oscar category on the main Oscar night.

If Cristoph Waltz doesn't win the Best Actor Oscar I think AMPAS should be firebombed. But seriously, please don't mention the Supporting Oscar, Waltz is the BEST ACTOR, PERIOD. There WAS NO better performance by an actor in all of 2009, and not any in the last ten years that I can think of.

I think the Best Supporting could go instead to Michael Fassbender, whose performance as Lieutenant Archie Hicox was exquisitely entertaining. I also loved Diane Kruger as Bridget von Hammersmark, especially in the tavern scene. Listen, every single performance in this movie was superb, but I really think Waltz must get the Best Actor Oscar if there is any justice in this world.

This was a true ""Great"" film, right up there with the best films ever. Yes, Quentin, as you yourself wrote and directed in the final shot, this IS a ""masterpiece"".

3955147,4,B002MZZMRM,"This movie is really pretty outstanding.  The opening scene is intense, frightening, shocking, and appauling all at once, and it sets up the entire film perfectly.  I really had no expectations for this movie because I had read so many mixed reviews and none of them really said anything, so I actually thought this was a really good movie although a bit drawn out.  The film is artfully done beautifully shot and extremely well acted.

Now here's why you may not like this quite as much as I did and why my wife absolutely HATED it.

What most expected from this movie:
1- Gore, action, and more gore and more action
2- A story that follows the Basterds as they wreak havoc on Hitler's army
3- Maybe a few subtitles as the film does take place in France after all
4- Classic Quentin Tarantino comedic dialogue

What the film actually is:
1- A character driven story HEAVY on dialogue and other than the last 20 minutes extremely light on action with a couple pretty graphic gory bits tossed in.  The last 20 minutes is extremely graphic and violent.
2- The story largely follows the young Jewish girl/woman who escapes the opening scene.  The Basterds are just kind of there as an afterthought because they are planning to blow up the same theater.
3- This film is conservatively speaking about 80% subtitled and spoken either in German or French.
4- The only part that is really funny (and it is hilarious) is Brad Pitt ""speaking"" Italian so poorly that Helen Keller could have picked him out as the American in the crowd.

I've read negative reviews about how this film is ""war porn"" and diminishes U.S. veterans in some way, but this couldn't be further from the truth.  First of all this film is pure fiction that just happens to take place during WWII in France.  Nothing depicted in this film is based in any way on fact.  It is a complete fantasy of what could have possibly happened if Hitler and all the Nazi upper echelon had all decided to go to a jewish owned movie theater to watch a propaganda film.

Overall it is an extremely well made film that does just about everything well.  It is a little bit drawn out at over 2.5 hours but like I said it is very well done and the acting is superb.  4.5 stars.  I'd recommend it but be sure to have an open mind.

The last half hour was about all the action a person could stand it was good but, that was all nothing spectacular. Brad Pit stain is a hit or miss actor anyway there have been many movies he destroyed but there have also been movies that he shined in, this was not one of them.

It's a pretty good story-line, but some of the scenes get a bit long and drawn out.  The scenes you want to be longer are short and to the point.  Bradd Pitt does a nice job with his character, but unfortunately, he doesn't get a lot of air time in the movie.  That is the one area I think they really could have done better in this movie...more scenes with Pitt's 'Basterds' going about the countryside and killing more Nazi's.  The story line seems to shift more to Nazi character development and the one Jewish girl who wants revenge.

Also, if you hate reading subtitles in movies then you might want to AVOID this one.  Probably close to 1/3 or more of the movie is in subtitles (french, german, italian is spoken).

3955151,4,B002MZZMRM,"Watched this film on blu-ray last night (as the snow poured down outside.)  This was the second time,as I had seen it in the movies last September.  It is an enjoyable and exciting film, good but not great.  The problem is too many scenes go on way too long.  The opening scene in the film is suspenseful, but goes on way too long: about 20 minutes.  I felt it was too long in the movies and last night I almost immediately forwarded to scene 2.  There is one other excruciatingly long scene involving a couple of the ""basterds"" and a British spy meeting a German film actress and allied spy (Diane Kruger) in a bar.  This scene also goes on way too long but, at least, ends excitingly.
Speaking of the ""basterds,"" they really do not play the major part in the film and are on screen rather sparingly.  For a film advertised as an action film, until the conclusion there really isn't that much action.  As for the actors, Brad Pitt has a few good scenes and his Southern accent is amusing.  However much of the film is spent with his chin out and a rather stupid expression on his face, he looks almost mentally retarded at times.  The major find in this film is Melanie Laurent, the french actress who plays the Jewish owner of the movie theater which Goebbels chooses for the premiere of his Nazi propaganda film.  This actress is not only beautiful, but gives an absolutely wonderful performance.  You cannot take your eyes off her when she is on screen, she reminds me of a young Audrey Hepburn in that regard.  Diane Kruger is also excellent as the German film star, secretly spying for the allies.  And finally Christoph. Waltz, as the SS Colonel Landa, nicknamed the ""Jew Hunter,"" gives a fantastic performance also.
There are numerous extras on the blu-ray including extended scenes (although many of the scenes really did not need any extensions.)  My favorite extra is a 2 part interview with Rod Taylor who has a short part as Winston Churchill.  He was one of my favorite actors growing up in the '50s and '60s, starring in 2 of my all-time favorite films: Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" and George Pal's production of H.G. Wells' ""The Time Machine.""  I especially enjoyed hearing Taylor relate how, years ago, Quentin Tarantino wrote him for an autographed picture which Tarantino still has.  I can relate to this.  I have written to Taylor on several occassions and have several very nice signed lobby cards from him, including one from ""The Birds"" which I have framed, hanging on my wall.  The fact that Tarantino sought Taylor out to play this small role heightens my respect for him.
In conclusion, this is kind of a fun fantasy to watch, if you are aware that there is more talk than action and some very long, long scenes.",1261267200,3,2734,4.584362139917696
3955152,4,B002MZZMRM,"INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is a romp that takes a bit of horrendous history and makes an entertaining film about it.  For those who admire the strangely off kilter Quentin Tarantino's films, this may just appeal as his best and fanciest production yet.  It is a way over the top story about revenge as carefully served out by Jewish American soldiers known as Inglourious Basterds on the Nazis who during the occupation of France sought out and murdered thousands of Jews.  This may sound like a grim topic for an entertaining film, but in Tarantino's hands it becomes not only a grisly look at reality but also an at times hilarious parody.

The cast is almost secondary to the story: Brad Pitt as the leader Lt Aldo Raine sports a scarred throat and a somewhat tiresome Tennessee accent but seems to enjoy every grisly moment of his command to have all members of his division gather 100 scalps from the Nazi killers; Denis Menochet provides a sensitive opening as the French father who is hiding Jews (namely one Shosanna Dreyfus-  M&eacute;lanie Laurent - whose escape from her family's slaughter begins the lead seed for the story ahead), Mike Myers portraying a German parody as only he can, Daniel Br&uuml;hl, Marin Wuttke as a pitch perfect Hitler, B.J. Novak as Pitt's sidekick, Sylvester Groth as Goebbels, etc.  But the crowning actor in this film is the amazingly gifted Christoph Waltz as the multilingual, sinister, smarmy, yet elegant Col. Hans Landa who drives this wild tale to its grisly conclusion.

As with all Tarantino films this is not a film for the faint of heart, but it is surprising how entertaining this sprawling story is in his hands.  It goes on a bit long and is chocked full of grisly incidents, but it is fine film making.  Grady Harp, December 09",1261180800,2,1776,4.758957654723127

It seems every time we hear of an upcoming Quentin Tarantino movie we are expecting a  Kill Bill or Planet Terror type film filled with mindless violence and gruesome, grotesque scenes. It seems Inglouirus Basterds might follow suit after seeing the trailers, but somehow I felt pleasantly surprised after watching it and satisfied. Perhaps other viewers expecting much more action may hate it or get impatient with it. About half or more of the film is in French or German with English subtitles while the remaining parts are spoken with some English language.

Set in fictionally France during the German Nazi occupation, a Jewish woman named Shosanna Drefus (Melanie Laurent) flees after her family is massacred by Nazis led by Colonel Landa who is a Nazi SS Officer nicknamed the ""Jewish Hunter"" (played brilliantly by actor Christopher Waltz). She would later come to ownership of a small theater under a different identity were she quietly befriends a German soldier named private Fredrick Zoller (Daneil Bruhl) who turns out to be a German hero because of his antics as a skilled sniper. A Nazi sniper who  single handedly fought off an Allied onslaught on his own. The German hero has a film made about him called ""Nation's Pride"" exploiting his heroics that will be privately viewed by some of the most high ranking Nazis including the Furer Adolf Hitler himself. The film will be shown at Shosanna's theater at the personal request of Private Zoller. Shosanna sees this as an opportunity to lock the building with everybody inside during the film viewing and kill them all as a great act of revenge for her slain family.

At the same time we are introduced to Lieutenant Aldo (an offering of comic relief by Brad Pitt) who assembles a band of Jewish Americans soldiers bent out on wrecking havoc behind German lines killing Nazis disguised as civilians. His protocol, take no prisoners and collect 100 Nazi scalps (literally)! Eventually a double agent posing as a German actress meets up with Aldo's private commando basterds and learns of the Nazi gathering at the theater also. They plan to infiltrate and set off explosives at the theater unaware of Shoshanna's intent to burn the theater down.

The title of the movie and the theatrical trailers I felt were very misleading because the commando Basterds were not really the main element of the movie which may turn out to disappoint a lot of people. Brad Pitt's character Lt. Aldo is not even the main character as I felt he was more of a third leading character behind the Jewish woman Shosanna & Colonel Landa. I have to admit, I laughed every time Brad Pitt spoke with his heavy, Tennesee Southern accent speaking lines like ""We are in the Nazi killing business and cousin, business is booming!"" Be prepared for a lot of dialogue which I felt was excessive at times like other reviewers have complained about given the almost 2.5 hour run time, but it all comes together in the end with a flourish. The fate of Adolf Hitler reminded me that this film was again fiction. I enjoyed IB for what it was and appreciated as a somewhat ambitious effort for Tarantino compared to his previous efforts in the action packed Kill Bills. I enjoyed it more in a Jackie Brown sort of way. Recommended, but I'm just not sure everybody can appreciate it the same way!

3955159,3,B002MZZMRM,"The opening scene with Aldo Raine stating his mission to his ""Bastards"" will be about the last riviting scene you will see until the very end.  Yes, Christoph Waltz is brilliant, but he and the other actors are harmed by Tarentino's overindulgence and his vision of himself as auteur, when here he's ultimately a derivitive hack.  I had high hopes for this one, but the trailer was better edited than the film. A story that's basically a ""what if"" fantasy must keep an almost break-neck pace to maintain your suspension of disbelief, but the director failed with scenes running too long and destroying the tension. The clever and supposedly resourceful Raine looks like and idiot when he leaves behind two bodies that can be easily identified and the viewer is left unsatisfied when the character Shoshanna is denied the specific revenge the story needs to be fulfilling. Go head and watch it out of curiosity, but don't expect to care about watching it again. Unless, of course, if you like the blood and gore for it's own sake, but here it's so prosaic and ""we've seen it all before"" that I yawned. Maybe you'll enjoy long draggy scenes with card games and little falters as actors reveal that they are acting but I think Tarentino spoiled all the fun. And if you're going to trample all over the war and the vets and victims you better make sure it's fun",1261094400,4,1357,4.65

German kills? 7, maybe. Four or five under the floorboards, two ladies; one strangled after she has killed an unarmed soldier, the other in self-defense.
American kills? 100's...including brain surgeries with dull instruments (infinitely more powerfully portrayed in The Untouchables), fatal tonsures, botched tracheostomies, spinal adjustments with heavy metals, mercy killings to spare the 'livestock' a par-broiled fate. Sitz-bath, anyone, after this putrescent mass passes?

No mention of the uncounted French, Belgium, Greek or Polish civilians put against walls for every German killed by a commando action. The highly educated/intelligent members of Mountbatten's ""X-Troop"" knew this. Their missions were to obtain information; to slip in and out of occupied Western Europe un-noticed. Though they sought invisibility, they suffered a 50% mortality rate.

No mention of the medical experimentation on old men, pregnant women and children. The ovens and charnel houses. The fields which are still white. Even burlesque can be edifying, or have a semblance of balance. How about a musical based in Cambodia in the late 70's? A lampoon set in Rwanda, 1994? Our history is filled with unimaginable tragedy. Salivate-away, QT. Aegri somnia.

Would Jimmy Stewart have played ""Aldo the Apache""? Clark Gable? Charles Durning? Audie Murphy? Humphrey Bogart? David Niven? Charles Bronson? James Whitmore? Tyrone Power? Brian Keith? James Arness? Lee Marvin? Alec Guinness? Doubtful, as all of the aforementioned served honorably in actual combat in WWII. Have the makers lived in a war zone or experienced the horrors of combat? Seen bodies piled like cord-wood? Looked directly into the face of genocide? Hardly. Why is it these omega males in the industry so relish blood, brains and guts? Obvious. They're behind a camera, not under an MG42.

Is the parody of brutality in a casual, cavalier and comedic manner remotely healthy, given the context? Portraying our enemy's leaders as fools, perverts, simpletons and psychopaths, though they be so, is not a wise philosophy to propagate and instill into our national psyche. We do so at our own peril. The German High Command, in 1939, considered Americans too soft and decadent to repulse their Aryan might. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was recently referred to as a ""cab driver"" on a  syndicated program. Should a low-yield glow appear 80 miles over Kansas, your diodes and metaloxide semiconductors won't be grinning.
Were we to succumb to a fascist/totalitarian regime, these omegas would be the first into the chutes. Are they utterly ignorant of history?

Our 7.5 billion-seat Collosseum. Panem et Circenses? Consider the 32"" classrooms our 'children' attend, the histories they learn. All celluloid. Many college grads cannot locate Germany or Japan on a world globe. Fewer know the date of our entry into WWII. 'Those who don't know history remain forever children'. Will the 'children' interpret this as gospel? When or if they reflect on WWII, will they think of us as the monsters? ""History is 85% prejudice"", said a wise historian.

This film is an insult to the 430000+ Americans who perished in the conflict, and specifically this group of commandos. If the prime-movers of this enterprise are so anxious to explore our dark nature, they should enlist. Fatigue their senses with real blood, guts and death. Place everything they are and ever will be onto a real stage.

Kruger, Waltz, and Laurent are too capable to be associated with this irresponsibly twisted, high-school-dropout, egesta.
The film fails as parody, satire, war epic, action, comedy, thriller/suspense, farce, adventure, social commentary, drama, or horror. It tries too hard to be all of these. It fails to be any of these.

The most charismatic character is a monster. The most sympathetic character, Shosanna, is poorly developed...so where does the audience seek sanctuary? With whom do we identify? Where is some high ground (or a hole to crawl down)?
The dialogue is torturous, protracted, and puerile.
The whole thing is a disrespectful paean to a confusing number of silver-screen progenitors. Inside joke?
Expand your intellectual horizons, QT; get your GED.

3955162,4,B002MZZMRM,"Quentin Tarantino likes to create art house/big budget films in traditionally low-budget genres or hybrids. That the films are simultaneously art house and big budget is a testament to his keen sense for what audiences enjoy that they probably didn't realize themselves. A copycat certainly; overrated perhaps; but I have to give the guy credit for his surprising commercial success with films that are essentially about other films. He's not always successful, but sometimes Tarantino hits the right note with his self-referential, genre-bending, absurdist bloodbaths. ""Inglourious Basterds"" is one of those times. The film takes its name and genre from the Italian 1978 ""macaroni war"" film whose title is spelled correctly. Who would have thought it possible to make a macaroni war flick (or a parody of one) appeal to modern audiences and make it funny to boot?

The setting is German-occupied France in the early 1940s. American Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) and his team of 8 Jewish soldiers were air-dropped into France with the purpose of scaring the bejesus out of the German army by killing and scalping every Nazi in their sight. Their tactics are sufficiently extravagant to inspire fear in their enemies and furor in the Fhrer back in Berlin. Meanwhile, Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent), a Jewish dairy farmer until her family was murdered by SS ""Jew Hunter"" Col. Hans Landa, is hiding in plain sight in Paris, where she operates a cinema under an assumed name. A smitten German soldier, Pvt. Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), campaigns for her theater to host a grand German movie premiere, while the British and the Basterds see the extravaganza as an opportunity to kill a lot of Nazis with one big bang.

""Inglourious Basterds"" doesn't take trouble not to offend anyone. The Basterds are not just stereotypical brazen Americans, but sociopaths. The Brits are refined and organized, but effete and ineffectual. The Germans are overbearing, cruel, and quite mad. Shosanna and her lover Marcel (Jacky Ido) are the only sympathetic characters, and their plans are not exactly virtuous. But they're all immensely entertaining. In Tarantino fashion, many scenes do nothing to further the plot. They're filled with the director's signature pop culture banter -World War II style, in three languages. Half the jokes are in subtitles. It works. Those scenes are in turns suspenseful and hilarious. Austrian actor Christoph Waltz deserves the abundant praise he has received for making Col. Landa a pleasant and ruthless bureaucrat. His vicious caricature somehow has great charisma. The plot does nothing more than build to the explosive showdown, but the dialogue is where the real action is.

The DVD (Universal 2009 single disc): Bonus features are 2 extended scenes, 1 alternate scene, 4 trailers (teaser, domestic trailer, international trailer, Japanese trailer), and ""Nation's Pride Full Feature"" (6 min), which is the entirety of the Zoller biographical film we see in the film, entitled ""Stolz der Nation"" in German. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in French and Spanish, though I'm not certain if all of the dialogue is dubbed. ""Inglourious Basterds"" characters speak three languages: English, French, and German, so the film is intended to be viewed with subtitles.",1261094400,6,3344,5.246728971962617
3955163,1,B002MZZMRM,"I am a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino!  I own just about everything he has ever done,or acted in, or produced and the 2 I don't yet own, I want to get.  I didn't get a chance to see this in the theaters, so when it came out this week I went right to Target ( sorry amazon, new movies are a I want it now purchase) I came home and made sure I had everything ready for a great night at the movies, at home. Turned on the 46 plasma, cranked up the surround sound and settled into the couch with everything I would need so I would not have to get up for anything. I even turned the ringer off on my phones. And then I was in for the biggest disappointment of 2009.  I won't waste your time with giving a blow by blow report as to why I thought this was possibly the most horrible film I have seen in 2009,but lets just say being a huge Tarantino fan it is very hard to admit that this movie just falls flat on its face. The actors were great, or course the gore and blood sense were very gratuitous. It is after all Quentin. the movie just dragged on, and on, and on........ the story line was incredibly boring and mundane.  I just did not like it at all, and if I could, Id return it. But you know once you break the seal, you own it even if its not worth a nickle with dvds.  So it goes in the dvd collection as a reminder to rent it first before buying it. Redbox is only a $1, and even at that its to much for this film. gets one star because there is nothing lower.",1261094400,20,1466,3.8896321070234112
3955164,3,B002MZZMRM,"I really really do enjoy alot of films by this director, but I'm starting to lose hope in him.  After watching Death Proof my one and only time at the movies I started to think he went off the deep end.  By the commercials I thought this movie looked like another Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill (vol. 1 of course cause vol. 2 sucked). For the most part I thought this movie really was alright.  unlike other people who have given this movie a bad review, my dislike of the movie is different.  Ok, if you are going to make a movie where 2 hrs. of it is in a different language, at least leave the text on the screen long enough for people to read.  I can glance through and get the general idea of what the conversation is about, but if I'm having to read the subtitles I want to understand all that's being said not just  bits of pieces.  This movie is 2and a half hours long, and I'm making it an extra hour because I'm pausing it every two seconds for fear I might be missing something inportant.  I tell you one thing, I've read where they are making a Kill Bill vol. 3.  I'm giving him one more chance to redeem himself, and if that movie sucks I'm giving up on him completely",1261008000,4,1176,4.12280701754386
3955165,3,B002MZZMRM,"Good movie, interesting fictional re-write of history, nice concept, GREAT performances, and some very captivating scenes(or chapters) that had you on the edge of your seat.  Having said that, it wasn't what i was expecting.  I thought it was mainly going to be about the 8 guys under Brad Pitt's command, their exploits, and crazy action.  In other words, considering it's a fictional take on events in WW2 and had nazis in it, i thought i was in for another grindhouse-type flick from Tarantino.  Instead, it's a mostly serious film that focuses mainly on Shoshanna's(sp) character and her revenge from chapter 1.

So, if you want all-out action flick this isn't it.  But if you want a mostly gripping film that really delivers in most of its scenes, then it's definitely worth a watch no matter what your preconceptions of it may be.  One last thing, i bought the single-disc dvd with the extras: brief ext/alt scenes, ""Nation's Pride"" propaganda mini-film, ""and more"".  The ""and more"" part is just trailers for Inglourious Basterds if you're wondering.  Overall, a rental should do as it's worth a watch.  Be prepared to read a lot of sub-titles though.",1261008000,5,1157,4.887179487179488
3955166,5,B002MZZMRM,"Quentin Tarantino had long spoken of his ""war epic"" that he had been working on and in late 2008, he unexpectedly announced that he had commenced filming and wanted to release it at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. Upon its debut, it became the highest-grossing film of his career, opened to rave reviews, and the typical fanfare that greets just about any Tarantino film. Inglourious Basterds is not a war epic in the traditional sense...It's a war fantasy, in which Tarantino doesn't let the constraints of reality keep him from telling the story he wishes to tell. It's a large-scale epic, separated into five chapters, with a large cast, and a great villain.

Chapter one is called ""Once Upon a Time...In Nazi-Occupied France."" Colonel Hans Landa of the SS (Christoph Waltz), nicknamed ""the Jew Hunter,"" stops by the dairy farm of Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet) to inquire about a missing family of Jews whom Landa believes LaPadite is hiding in his home. This is an explosive opening scene, beautifully shot by cinematographer Robert Richardson, and absolutely bristling with suspense. The banter between Waltz and Menochet, coupled with the subtle musical score is a brilliant example of filmmaking, as well as a great way to establish the character Hans Landa. Meanwhile, we have the brief and understated performance by Menochet. In the scheme of things, with as many speaking roles as this movie has, Menochet has a relatively insignificant role in the film, and yet he has a rather remarkable impact. He lets us in to empathize with him as Landa slowly breaks him down.

Chapter two introduces us to the ""Basterds,"" a group whose mission is to spread fear throughout the German military by ruthlessly killing Nazi's. They're lead by Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), who leads the colorful characters through Germany, killing and scalping any Nazi's they come across. They've become so feared by the German military, even Hitler is aware of them.

While there are 5 chapters, its only chapter three I'm going to elaborate any further on...This chapter, entitled ""German Night in Paris,"" introduces us to Shosanna (Melanie Laurent), the surviving Jewish girl of chapter one, who operates a cinema in France under an assumed name. Shosanna is approached by Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), a celebrated German war hero, who asks Shosanna to host a movie premiere of his movie ""Nation's Pride,"" a movie premiere that will be attended by the top powers of the Third Reich, including Hitler himself.

Of course, there are many more characters and many more actors. In setting up his film with chapters, Tarantino has made a film that, overall, has more of an episodic nature than a cohesive story. There is no main character in the film and many of the film's characters never meet each other and, really, it's only Hans Landa that really holds it all together. Don't be fooled by the theatrical trailers which portray the ""Basterds"" as the main characters...They actually have a relatively small amount of screen time. Other actors include the lovely Diane Kruger as Bridget von Hammersmark, a German actress who's serving as a spy for the British. A surprising appearance by Mike Myers (yes, Austin Powers himself) has bothered some and I would have preferred a different choice myself, but he doesn't exactly bother me. It's just so noticeably Myers and he's so campy with his role it sort of breaks the spell woven by Inglourious Basterds momentarily.

Many of this film's detractors cite it's casting much of the time, particularly Myers and director Eli Roth as the Basterds' Bear Jew. Roth is convincing physically as the Bear Jew and the maniacal look in his eyes (he's probably stoned) work well, but whenever he's required to speak (not very often) I didn't buy it. But he doesn't ruin the film by any stretch and, yes, he likely only got cast because he's friends with Tarantino...But, oh well. He does a decent job. Pitt is fantastic as Lt. Aldo Raine and it's his larger-than-life persona that makes this performance so effective and entertaining. If Pitt is campy in the role, it just fits well into the whole scheme of things. Many director's want you to suspend your disbelief and accept a film as a reality...Tarantino wants you to know you're watching a movie. Pitt will not win an Oscar for his performance, but I found his portrayal both compulsively watchable and hilarious. Finally, Waltz plays Hans Landa so menacingly he deserves all the critical accolades his performance has been met with. Waltz creates such a thoroughly evil, gleeful sociopathic character that is one of Tarantino's greatest creations. Waltz was a German television actor that Tarantino picked for the role and I haven't seen a more impressive supporting performance this year.

The dialogue is typical Tarantino (""We ain't in the prisoner-takin' business, we in the killin' Nazi business and, cousin, business is a boomin'""), although it's worth noting that much of the dialogue is subtitled. This surprised me when I first saw the film and I can imagine some will be angered by this. A large majority of the film is in a language other than English, but you can still feel the effect of Tarantino's dialogue.

Also very impressive and a huge component of the film is its musical score; one that only Tarantino would use for a World War II epic. Tarantino has always had a gift for picking music for his film and this film is no exception. Despite many of Tarantino's flourishes, this film has the least Tarantino-like feel to it, although I can't quite put my finger on why.

This is not a film for everyone and even fans of war movies and/or Tarantino will be disappointed by it. It's not a perfect film and, while I think it's a great film, I wonder if it would've been greater had Tarantino not rushed into making it.  It's got a brilliant opening scene and a terrific ending (whether it makes complete sense or not) and it further cements Tarantino's status as one of Hollywood's greatest film directors. Inglourious Basterds is one of the best, most entertaining films of 2009; a celebration of cinema and what makes movies so great.

3955167,4,B002MZZMRM,"Knowing this was a Quentin Tarantino movie, I expected certain things which he delivered with zeal. On top of that, he rewrote the history of WW2 in a way we only wish could have happened.

The movie is full of not laugh out loud, but witty fun, mixed with the trademark cartoonish gory violence. There are spaghetti western scenes, complete with the Ennio Morricone music style, and the dialogue is snappy. However, that is also where I have my problem. The subtitles not only went by too fast much of the time, but they took up too much time in the movie and dragged me away from watching what was happening on screen. At times it was downright annoying.

One of my favorite scenes is when Brad Pitt's Aldo tries to fake Italian with his extreme southern drawl. That is the one scene that made me laugh out loud.

I also liked the ending, especially for the irony. In real life, even without rewriting history, America did similar things all in the name of fighting communism. Don't know how many other people caught that, but it rings true.

Overall, this was a great movie, except for the annoying subtitles. If it hadn't been for them, I would have given it five stars. Still, highly recommended.",1261008000,5,1201,4.572093023255814

IF you want to know the story of a bunch of ficitonal characters that really are, strait to the point, boring, I'd recommend this movie to you. I'd also recommend this movie to you if your IQ is below 2. I could give this movie five stars if they never made it.

  They must have paid Brad Pitt 25 dollars for his whole 20 minutes in the movie. If you saw the preview for this movie you where horribly lied to. If you think this is going to be a blood, guts, gore, (a good movie about killing Nazis) your wrong. Its really just one big story that has nothing to do with what they told us the movie was actually going to be.

This could have benefited from some trimming here and there; it ends up being 2.5 hours long as it is.

Otherwise, Brad Pitt turns in another excellent performance as Aldo, the leader of a small group of Nazi hunters who scalp the Nazis after killing them, though they also release a few of them after carving swastikas on their foreheads as a warning.  Eli Roth is great as his righthand man, and the fellow playing Landa, their primary foe, is outstanding.  The photography in France is very nice, as are the locations; the songs chosen well; and the scenes of violence are actually rather brief and not as graphic as in some of QT's previous work.",1260921600,,861,4.535483870967742
3955172,3,B002MZZMRM,"When Mike Tyson was in his heyday, he had many of his opponents beaten before they even got into the ring.  You see, it was Tyson's reputation that intimidated them.  I believe this is what we have when it comes to Quentin Tarantino's films; it is his reputation for being an ""auteur"" that proceeds his releases.  People think this a guy who does ""out of the box,"" conglomerations of spaghetti westerns, blaxploitation films, his quirky musical tastes, etc. and mixes it all together-and according to them, out comes a great movie.  ""Inglourious Basterds"" is one of those films, BUT closer examination reveals the film does have flaws.  Tarantino gets away with long, boring scenes of dialog building up to a climactic event just because he is, well, Tarantino.  Another filmmaker would simply be taken to task for these trangressions, but we're dealing with a ""genius"" here, so he gets a free pass by critics and fans.  IB does have much to crow about: beautiful cinematography, great action scenes (when they finally show up), and good performances, but film is all about timing and pacing, and this is where the movie loses focus.  No doubt Tarantino devotees will say ""but that is how he does it,"" but to me and many other moviegoers it's still plodding at a snails pace.  In the end, ""Inglourious Basterds"" just moved to slowly for me to really enjoy it.",1260921600,3,1359,4.773504273504273

Basterds is easily the best of those 3, but it's still bloated with never-ending pointless scenes that should have been heavily edited or deleted. He's also run out of ideas for satisfying or shocking payoffs to those scenes. If he made Pulp Fiction today, it would need to be a trilogy because Jackson and Travolta would be discussing the Royale with Cheese for 45 minutes.

3955176,5,B002MZZMRM,"Quinten Tarantino has a love hate relationship with the movie going public. He is one of the few major faces in film who wants to make movies his way whether you love them or hate them. His stories are jumbled his humor is crude and to a great deal of dislike he loves to push the bar. In the end he manages to put together a brilliant ensemble cast and always finds ways to take some of the famous names in acting and put them in a role and is out of their element. The outcome just gives fan goose bumps especially with the newest edition to his library.

Inglorious Basterds was a movie I was very eager to see. As a Tarantino fan and lover of every film he has directed I was very excited to see a movie about Jewish soldier beating up Nazis. As a member of the Jewish faith and a grandchild of Holocaust survivors there was no doubt in my mind that this was a film that was going to spark tremendous amounts of controversy. Yes, the story told is entirely false and the major Jewish press felt that his work was a shear mockery, but Tarantino stated he had no intentions of making a Holocaust documentary. As a fan of films that involve larger than life heroics, he wanted to give every little Jewish boy and girl a dose of ...dare I say it...Pulp Fiction. These types of stories go back to the days of Superman and Captain America comic books taking down the Nazis and it was done with style and class and Tarantino in my eyes at least didn't push any harsh buttons with me. The acting in this film is awesome, he cast the right people for the right roles especially Christoph Waltz as Nazi Colonel Hans Landa. His performance was the best I have seen all year and he really put fear into the movie watchers. I am so happy he was nominated for the golden globe and I sure hope he gets the Oscar nod and wins it. Brad Pitt, I have not seen in a more brilliant role since the stoner in `True Romance'. You also have great performances from Diane Kruger, and yes even Mike Myers! As a Tarantino fan, you get everything you need from Inglorious Basterds. Listen very carefully to some of the voices you hear throughout the film you may get a few awesome surprises.

If you haven't seen this movie yet, Jewish or not it is a must see. It is a pure rush of excitement and that is why we go to the movies.",1260921600,,2304,4.210407239819005

The subtitles on ""Inglourious Basterds"" are too often difficult (sometimes impossible) to read even on a decent-sized TV screen, and some of the jokes and plot points are lost. I regret not seeing this movie in the theater,and I will hold off on any further viewing or purchase until such time as an improved disc with legible subtitles is issued.

After all, Landa had just murdered the movie star to prevent whatever was to happen in the theater. His next move, like Frank Sinatra in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, would have been to go to the projection room to investigate.

Landa killed Shoshona's entire family, so the showdown would have had more meaning with him.

Also, it was not in character for him to negotiate a house in Nantucket. We see throughout the movie what a fierce defender of the Reich he is. He would do anything to prevent the attack on the high-ranking Germans in the theater. The deal-making over the bottle of red wine and the cutting of the swastika in Landa's forehead strike me as anti-climactic and rather stupid.",1260835200,,846,4.671140939597316
3955179,2,B002MZZMRM,"Wow, Gee... Inglourious Basterds
I've finally come to believe, sadly, at long last, that Quinton Tarantino is no cinema genius. And I had such high hopes.
 Tarantino just loves films. This film has many, many, many, many references to scenes from other films or film genres and in this case, that's unfortunately more curious than interesting.
  The film buff I me is self-congratulatory for recognizing what he is doing until I realize that it is killing continuity and any semblance of plot. Plus that's all there is. He has no film. No script. Just a Multi-Million dollar actor, Brad Pitt.
Pretty soon into the film I note that I am watching a derivatively stupid film. There is really no creativity, no original film making... but a mad-cap director that says with unbridled enthusiasm (boy-like), ""Wow, lets put this into the film here...and this here...this'll be neat"" , etc.
 The acting and staging in the first scene is on the serious side (almost cinema-francoise) and one would think this will be the tone of the film. Wrong. Caricature and goofiness become the rule.
 Pitt is interesting as usual but the accent is dumb and embarrassing. Plus, from the trailers you'd think his character drives the film. Wrong. But then no character or individual theme drives the film. Rampant enthusiasm about film making is the only thread I see connecting the various contrasting and disjointed scenes. Thank god for the sound of a gun going off from time to time.
 And I really, really looked forward to the DVD release. Bummer.
 Excerpt from Wikipedia:
The title of the film was inspired by director Enzo Castellari's 1978 Dirty Dozen-like war film The Inglorious Bastards. Though Tarantino acknowledges that both the former and the latter were inspirations for the film, and there are noticeable similarities, he stresses that Basterds is an original work and not a remake of the 1978 film. To date, there has been little explanation of the title spelling. When asked, Tarantino would not explain the first u in Inglourious and said, ""But the 'Basterds'? That's just the way you say it: Basterds.""[8] He stated in an interview that the misspelled title is ""a Basquiat-esque touch.""[9] He further commented on theLate Show with David Letterman that ""Inglourious Basterds"" is the ""Tarantino way of spelling it.""",1260835200,7,2312,5.005208333333333
3955180,5,B002MZZMRM,"Here is Quentin Tarantino's big graphic gorgeous revisionist tribute to vengeance and filmmaking. Inglorious Basterds is made with the careful eye of a genius attuned to the delicate skill needed in creating such a film, yet who enjoys filling the screen to its edges with shamelessly unrestrained gore and historically audacious storytelling. It is primarily constructed from two subplots. One features Shosanna, a Jew living under false papers in 1944 Paris after her family was massacred. Then there is Aldo, played by Brad Pitt, a broadly-written American who is leading a cadre of underground Nazi-hunters. Both storylines are brought together (sort of) thanks to Col. Hans Landa, who is as skillful, intelligent, and passively terrifying as any villain I have ever seen.

Being a Tarantino film, however, the destination isn't half as fun as the journey, and this is some of his best work. Long, sonorous scenes follow one after the other, each a beautifully-crafted example of pause, dialogue, acting, and mise-en-scene. There is also an incredible sense of tension throughout- you continuously watch the film wanting the story to speed up while nervous about what is going to happen next. The end result is a big colorful mess, in the best way possible. Watch it and enjoy, but I wouldn't recommend eating beforehand.",1260835200,6,1325,5.191588785046729

3955183,1,B002MZZMRM,"Okay, I have already written one review of Inglourious Basterds.  But I got a bunch of nasty comments from QT lovers, so I'm going to try again.
I didn't like this movie for a few reasons.  Scratch that, I just hated this movie.
The way the movie was marketed was totally misleading.  I thought it was going to be a WWII action movie staring Brad Pitt.  It is actually a very long, at times slow paced revenge movie.  Other than the last half hour there is hardly any of the usual over the top violence that is present in Tarantino's other movies.  And Pitt is only in it for maybe 30 minutes total.
I don't have a problem with sub titles, normally.  But in this case they were hard to read.  And half the fun of a Tarantino movie is the dialogue.  Having to read it just took the fun out of it.
I really liked Tarantino's first three movies.  And I know I'm in the minority here, but my favorite is Jackie Brown.  I think it's my favorite because it is based on a book by Elmore Leonard.  I like the way QT changed certain things but still told the story well.  Anyway, I'm not a fan of Tarantino's last few movies.  I wish he would go back to making movies like Pulp Fiction or Jackie Brown.  Instead of gimmicky crap like Grindhouse, or alternative history like Inglourious Basterds.

first off ive seen this film when it came out..and its one of tarintino's best since pulp fiction and the kill bill films.

sure, it had great acting, and a great cast  which reminds me of films like the guns of navarone and the dirty dozen (great ww2 films also)

But for me and i know im not alone on this one..  the nazi  colonel hans ""the jew Hunter"" landa  was the real star of this film. he was played cool and calculating sort of a nazi hannibal lecter  and at oscar time  the actor that played him  actor should have a nomination.

the movie is your basic revenge plot  brad pitt(with an over the top southern accent)  leads an all jewish  ""nazi Killing"" goon squad into nazi occupied europe  with the task to take out the top leaders of the third reich. sounds cool huh?  well it is.  im a ww2 fan  and at first i wasn't sure about this film  but i was surprised..its an instant classic.

 there s lots of action, and suspense and lets not forget that  classic tarintino violence!  ww2 style!

3955185,1,B002MZZMRM,"I absolutely cannot understand why people are so in love with Tarantino's cut 'n' paste vision of cinema.  He blatantly rips off those he claims to admire, and winds up making the same sadistic revenge flick over and over and over.  The latest incarnation is 'Inglourious Basterds,' in which a bunch of murderous people on both sides compete to see who can commit the bigger atrocities.  The first scene?  Oh, the tension THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE HAD I NOT ALREADY SEEN THIS IN DOZENS OF MOVIES.  And can we stop with the idiotic chapters, especially those that begin ""Once Upon a Time In..."", Quentin?  You're not Sergio Leone, and you never will be.

The premise that Nazi Germany, losing the war, decides to abandon any pretense at security and have Hitler attend a film premiere in Paris?  I'm sorry, this is not alternate reality - it is complete fantasy, as are the completely shambolic schemes to kill Hitler by both the Basterds and the woman who runs the theater, both of which would have been thwarted by Paul Blart, Mall Cop.

Tarantino also likes to simply throw in bits of Morricone, and even a snippet of Lalo Schifrin's score for ""Kelly's Heroes"" (an INFINITELY better movie about guys who decide to go for themselves in wartime) to make the so-called cinephiles excited.  I don't know - maybe the guy doesn't want to pay an actual composer, or maybe composers don't want to work for him, because he's telling him, ""I want something like the 'Tiger Tank' theme from ""Kelly's Heroes"" here,"" all the time.

This movie is a complete mess, with nothing memorable about the characters, plot, or music, except that which has been ripped off from other movies.

Movie:  4.5/5  Video Quality:  5/5  Audio Quality:  5/5  Extras:  4/5  Overall:  4.6/5 (rounded up in total star ranking)

Anybody remember that Italian war movie from the 70s with Bo Svenson and Fred Williamson? They had ridiculously over-the-top shoot-outs and naked Nazi women firing machine guns! Anyone? No?

Well, Quentin Tarantino has taken the theme and topic of that silly film and turned it into something of his own. ""Inglourious Basterds"" doesn't quite have as much Nazi-killing as I expected, but it excels brilliantly with its plot, story, characters, dialogue, acting, cameramanship, and music selection. It is a bit strange perhaps, with some absurdity, but it is all earnest, original, and of decent quality. There are a couple of bloody brutal parts, but it's never over-done. There are some funny parts too, but it's also never over-done. Additionally, the movie has some interesting cultural/historical references and homages. Most of it even serves as a film about film and filmmaking, as the plot has a lot to do with a cinema. If you liked Tarantino's other work (especially ""Pulp Fiction,"" which has a plot structure similar to ""Inglourious Basterds"") or it you want to see a war drama of a different nature, check this one out by all means.

But next to Eli Roth, a hamhock in a monkey suit, he's positively charming.

Apparently nothing more than an overly long vehicle for QT to roll out all the (word that is pronounced NOT-zee) memorabilia he's snagged up on eBay -- and a good way to win the favor of Jerry Lewis before a planned remake of ""The Nutty Professor"" -- it's hard not to compare the (word that sounds like HIT-ler) character to the subject of the film, ""The Passion of the (word that sounds like KRIST).""

The best thing of the movie is Brad Pitt and he's only, I repeat, ONLY in 10% of the movie and probably says under 100 words total. Even the slaying of Hitler wasn't that good.
Oh sure they pumped him full of lead and then some more, I know he's Hitler, but he's barely portrayed as evil other than the fact that he's given the status of being Hitler. So it was rather neutral to see him die.

3955192,5,B002MZZMRM,"A group of Jewish American soldiers in WWII has had enough, and is going deep behind enemy lines.  Lt. Aldo Raine wants 100 Nazi scalps from each man in his unit, and he means that literally.  But the Basterds will have to go against Colonel Hanz Landa of the SS, an insidious wrung-climber who will stop at nothing to get whatever it is that he wants. Who will win?

The winner, of course, is Tarantino, who has reinvented history with INGLORIOUS BASTERDS, a truly glorious film that defies categorization.  It doesn't even, at times, feel like a Tarantino film; that opening scene between Landa and the dairy farmer is so full of tension, you'll have soaked your clothes in sweat within the first ten minutes.  And the whole film is somewhat sluggishly paced, which actually serves Tarantino's plot well; while we never really get close to the Basterds (for good reason; these aren't your lovable flag-waving soldiers, these guys are almost as sadistic as the Nazis they're pursuing), we spend plenty of time with Landa, as well as Shossana Dryfus, who escapes Landa as a child, only to re-encounter him years later.  The point is, we get close to some of these people--we learn to chear for Shossana, and learn to loathe Landa with every inch of our being.

You'll watch this movie for one of three reasons, I'm sure:
1) You're a Tarantino fan, and so will watch whatever he puts out, even if it's a documentary of his bowel movements.  I won't judge; I probably would too.
2) You like war movies.  Well, you may not get what you want here--this is revisionist cinema at its finest, and this ain't your granddaddy's war movie.  It's loud and gory and with so much moral ambiguity, you'll actually consider rooting for the bad guys.
3) You've heard about the fine performances.  Eli Roth is slightly miscast, though he has so much fun in his role, it's forgivable.  Michael Fassbender is so smooth and cool, you'll wish there was more of him.  Michael Meyers is Michael Meyers (really, Quentin?  Not your worst casting choice ever, but it's up there.)  Brad Pitt is hamming it up hardcore and loving every single second of it. Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger as the femme fatales are a blast to watch.  But the real gold here, as I'm sure you've heard, is Cristoph Waltz, who brings the movie villain to a whole new role.  Every single actor who plays a Nazi from here on out will study Waltz's flawless performance, and wish they were half as good.  Hanz Landa is the definition of ""smooth criminal""--a dastardly, multi-lingual genius who has a knack for sniffing out Jews (hence his name, The Jew Hunter), though we're never really sure what his motives are.  Waltz--fluent in German, French, and English, and with a decent grasp of Italian pronunciation--plays his role to the hilt through four languages, and steals every single scene he's in.  If you don't want to watch this movie for any other reason, watch it for him.

INGLORIOUS BASTERDS is easily one of Tarantino's best; for me, it ranks only behind RESEVOIR DOGS (though if somebody wants to argue for PULP FICTION, I'll understand).  This film is relentless, and is sure to piss off some people with its rather unflattering portrayal of the American WWII soldier, not to mention the guts Tarantino displays near the end.  Throughout, it is one violent, bloody ride, with laughter and terror and everything between.

3955197,5,B002MZZMRM,"I avoided seeing ""Inglorious Basterds"" for most of it's release, Quentin Tarantino movies are often disgusting, gory, violent blood fests. Finally I saw it after hearing many people whose opinions I respect rave. It is gory and it is disgusting in parts but it's also quite entertaining! Set in Nazi occupied France in WWII the movie starts with Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) as the most sinister, psychopathic SS agent ever put on film (I wouldn't be surprised to see this villain get an acting award) . Behind Allied lines, Aldo ""The Apache"" Rayne who is ""part Indian"" organizes a group of Jewish soldiers for ""targeted acts of retribution"" on the Nazis. He orders his men to each bring him ""100 Nattzie scalps"".  The Jewish Commandos proceed to strike terror into the Nazis! Hitler pounds his fist on the desk and screams ""Nien, Nien, Neine, Nien, Nien!""

The rest of the movie is a tense spy movie, wincingly gory in parts and really funny/ironic in others. Tarantino's quirky, bizarro sense of humor. The movie is inspired loosely on themes in Wagner's Gotterdammerung, Hitler's fav. Brad Pitt is hysterical in places - his weirdest role since ""Burn After Reading"". He doesn't like the idea that after the War, the ex-Nazi's will just go home, take off their uniforms and live ordinary lives.

Overlooked in many reviews is the startling high quality art house cinematography, cigarette smoke hanging in the air like fog, sunlight coming through bullet holes. Older movies paid attention to these details but it is unusual in a contemporary one.

The movie is produced by Harvey Weinstein, who viewers will know from TV series ""Entourage"" wherein he plays himself, a 300 pound, six foot seven ex-marine movie producer with anger management problems who frequently threatens to beat hero Vinnie to death for cheating him on movie deals. I can imagine crazy Tarantino in Hollywood pitching the concept of this war reversal fantasy to  Harvey Weinstein: ""You see Harvey, in this movie, the Jews terrorize the Nazi's!..."". The movie represents, in a sense, the ultimate ironic triumph of a Hollywood Jewish movie establishment over Nazi autrocities.

You might not think it would be entertaining, but it really is a classic, good on many levels. You will never forget the ending. Certainly one of the most original movies ever done.

The closing scene in this movie truly showcases Tarantino's talent. It's simultaneously tragic and triumphant, and goes from a low to a brilliant high in seconds.

He also managed to nudge in a few of his own political beliefs, particularly when the Nazi general labels the Inglorious Bastards ""terrorists"" in their fight for vengeance against the Nazi regime. I'll leave the reader to their own beliefs.

Authors in previous ages certainly wouldn't have scrupled.

But the thing seems thematically uneven to be considered great.  From what I read, Tarantino took 10 years to write this, and it shows.  They say you shouldn't take that long to write something, because there are too many changes in the author himself during such a time.  Thus what you finally come up with is likely to be stylistically and thematically clunky.  (Think of Moby-Dick:  unfortunate that the author went through so many changes while writing that.)

It's like Tarantino was at times trying to do this, at other times trying to do that.  In the end we get something that doesn't cohere stylistically and is only intermittently entertaining.",1259452800,3,1120,4.9411764705882355
3955201,4,B002MZZMRM,"Looking at the holocaust and world war 2, some directors make movies like Saving private ryan or the band of brothers or a Midnight clear etc... My guy makes 'Inglourious Basterds'. Enough has been said about the greatness of this movie and its quality, this is Tarantino film-making at its element and oh by the way Christoph Waltz was terrific. having said that, although the character and persona of Aldo Raine was incredible, somehow Brad Pitt playing that was a bit of a let down, they should have gone with a different actor (all you brangelina fans, pl. note: i said different, not better!)

Overall, there were a few weak points in the script and somehow the whole spaghetti western soundtrack was starting to get to me a bit, but all can be forgiven i guess. I'd rate this movie 4 stars and imo a keeper in my collection.

Now..... if he'd make a movie focussing only on the origin and further exploits of the Basterds. That would be the best!",1259366400,,952,4.56140350877193
3955202,5,B002MZZMRM,"Inglourious Basterds is, without a doubt, Tarantino's masterpiece.  In fact, not to jinks him or wish him anything but the best in future endeavors, but it is my opinion the odds of him surpassing what he has achieved in this film are slim indeed.

While there have been numerous complaints (even in the most complimentary of reviews) of the many incongruous elements found throughout the film, I have found it is the very disparity of those elements that tie this film into a unifying whole - and precisely what makes it one of the most satisfactory films and satisfying movie experiences of 2009.  It is this genre-busting, ""what is it?"" quality that makes it unique among the major players of this year's top films.

Visually, Tarantino has done nothing to date that quite matches the opulence he achieves here a tailor made look evocative of the ""Grand Hollywood Style"" of those glorious Technicolor epics of the 50's, 60's and 70's.  Like those, every frame of ""Inglorious Basterds"" seems worthy of being reproduced as ""art"" in its own right.  The color spectrum he employs throughout is rich and vivid in that 1950's fashion - simultaneously lurid yet beautiful.

He elicits performances from his cast that are among the most memorable seen in years.  The arc of the Shoshana story - Melanie Laurent in a powerfully searing performance that throbs with a ferocious intensity, anchors the various chapters of the film brilliantly.  That performance is matched (and maybe even surpassed) by her chief tormentor, in the guise of Austrian actor Christopher Waltz as Hans Landa of the SS.  Waltz, in fact, makes one of the most amazing film debuts in American film history.  Chilling doesn't begin to describe his performance here.

Not to be outdone by her costars, Diane Kruger gets to star in one of Tarantino's most brilliantly conceived scenes from any of his films - the basement bar scene.  As the unlikely (and hilariously) named Bridget Von Hammersmark, Kruger gives her finest performance since Joyeux Noel and proves herself both as comedian and grand tragedienne.

The Basterds - headed by Brad Pitt - have found some critics singling theirs out to be the weakest element of the movie, but I disagree.  Strongly.  While the danger of the European war front can be elegantly confusing throughout the entire film (e.g., the almost Andrew Wyeth spareness of the opening chapter; the inviting danger of the basement bar; the opulence of the Cinetheque, etc.) the sheer audacity and brutality of the scenes with the Basterds adds a provocatively American feel to the story's proceedings.

The Basterds are almost a comic chorus line -  not quite interchangeable archetypes in a film otherwise populated with specific and memorable characters.  Of course several of them (including Mr. Pitt) get to partake in a finale that is (even by Tarentino standards) so over the top it is nothing if not jaw dropping.  The entire finale offers one of the most hauntingly beautiful and memorable scenes modern cinema has had to offer in a very long time.

Mr. Tarantino paints all of this onto the broadest canvas possible using a palette that combines the almost unseemly mixtures of film noir, slapstick, crude comedy, art house film, historical fiction, James Bond-style slickness, buddy pic and action flick seemingly without a fleeting concern as to what anybody else thinks.  It's a ""take no prisoners"" style of filmmaking that (clearly) does not play to all tastes and demands that it be taken on its own terms.  If one is willing to take that journey with him the rewards are remarkable and immeasurable.  A truly remarkable film achievement.  Bravo, Signor Tarantino!",1259020800,11,3672,4.990147783251231
3955203,4,B002MZZMRM,"Being a fan of previous Tarantino works (mainly Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown), WWII combat films and westerns, I expected to like Basterds a lot more than I did. As you already know from trailers and ads, the film is a lavishly-produced and violent revenge fantasy centered around a plot to take out the Nazi High Command. Basterds has the look of film-making of yesteryear, drawing inspiration and stylistic influences from such sources as the classic 1967 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dirty-Dozen/dp/B000O176IO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dirty Dozen</a>, spaghetti westerns and ""macaroni combat"" films (a sub-genre of films produced by Italian directors of the mid-60's). Like all Tarantino films, it is filled with wonderfully inventive, humorous (and sometimes rambling) dialog, quirky narrative pacing, and a cast of memorable characters. And of course, lots of hidden references and punctuated by great music.

For those who haven't seen the film, there are actually two main story branches: the more publicized one concerning the Basterds, and another revolving around a young Jewish woman named Shoshana who is living in Paris under an assumed name and identity. Her story comes first. In Chapter 1, we are introduced to the film's main antagonist, a charming, highly intelligent, and charismatic SS Colonel named Hans Landa, nicknamed ""The Jew Hunter"" for his ruthless efficiency. He visits a French farmhouse where a teenage Shoshana and her family are being hidden. Shoshana is the only survivor of that encounter. She flees, but with a clear opportunity to kill her, Landa lets her escape.

Next, we cut to Chapter 2 where we see Lt. Aldo Raine (played by a miscast Brad Pitt) recruiting a unit of Jewish American soldiers to engage in guerrilla operations deep within Axis-controlled France, spreading terror through the Nazi ranks with their ambush tactics and brutality. We see them clubbing Nazi soldiers to death with baseball bats and taking of scalp, shown very graphically. Pitt's performance and mannerisms as a hardened military man from Tennessee (complete with Southern drawl) is not completely convincing, reminding me of his character from 12 Monkeys instead. My major criticism here is with the character development. It's very lacking, in my opinion. We only get a brief vignette/flashback of Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger), called out by name in a 60's movie font. We don't get much of a backstory for Aldo or any of the other 7 basterds except Stiglitz, giving us very little emotional investment. Not all of them make it through the film.

Next, we have the British coming into play, hatching up ""Operation Kino"" (German for ""cinema""), a joint operation with the Basterds to blow up a movie theater where Hitler and his top commanders will be attending a film screening of Joseph Goebbels' newest propaganda film. Mike Meyers makes a cameo appearance as a British General, sounding a bit like Austin Powers with his fake accent. Unknown to the Allies, Shoshana hatches a plot of her own and we return to her in the fifth and final chapter as she sets her plans in motion and the remaining parties converging for a final fateful encounter, all set to David Bowie's bellowing ""Putting Out Fire"" (a song originally written for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cat-People/dp/B000069HZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cat People</a>). It's wonderfully anachronistic and appropriate, as is almost all of the musical choice in the film, which blends rock riffs, Spanish guitar, and too many styles for me to identify.

Austrian actor Christoph Waltz is absolutely brilliant as Landa and is expected to get an Oscar tap for his command performance. Cold, calculating, beguilingly charming, and nuanced, Tarantino says Landa is perhaps his greatest character. Waltz infuses the character with complexity, humor, and wit. He really makes this movie.

Stylistically, the film is beautiful shot, visually convincing, and full of that trademark Tarantino flare. It's a very enjoyable experience if you like his work and WWII films in general, but I felt Pitt was miscast and not totally believable in his role. The basterds needed more character development if we are to care about their fates. We get very little personality information to go on here, and the film treated them as expendables. Even if the army did, the film shouldn't have treated them as disposables if we are to make a two and a half hour investment in watching this film and in the characters. Overall, I enjoyed this film, but it could've been better.",1258934400,2,4638,5.37414030261348

3955205,4,B002MZZMRM,"First off, let's get this out of the way: Quentin Tarentino will never, EVER top ""Pulp Fiction"". Period. Not gonna happen. So everyone really needs to stop comparing his movies to ""Pulp Fiction"". Second, this isn't supposed to be an accurate, dramatic depiction of World War II. We've seen a million of those types of films, and no portrayal of the Holocaust is going to surpass ""Schindler's List"", nor should it: it's one of the best movies of all time. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, ""Inglourious Basterds"" isn't perfect but it's still a good movie. Christoph Waltz is to this movie what Javier Bardeim was to ""No Country for Old Men"": a menacing, sadistic lunatic who you wanted to die but at the same time didn't because he's such an interesting character. Hopefully Mr. Waltz will get more roles in major American films, because his portrayal of ""the Jew Hunter"" is amazing. Brad Pitt is extremely entertaining as the leader of the Basterds, Aldo Raine, and his ""artwork"" and the ""debt"" he extracts from his men are so horrible that you have to love it. He also does a wonderful East Tennessee accent that other actors could stand to learn from (I'm looking at you, George Clooney). However, Melanie Laurent steals the movie as Shosanna, the secretly-Jewish Parisian cinema owner determined to not only take out ""the Jew Hunter"" for murdering her family but also the entire Nazi regime during the premiere of a Nazi propaganda film. She's cold yet vulnerable and sweet yet ruthless, and she's clearly the center of attention in the scenes she's in.
Unfortunately, Tarantino's obsession with dialogue prevents this movie from taking the step from good to great. Despite the title, there are precious few appearances by the Basterds; they're pretty much confined to the end of the first chapter and portions of the last chapter (and then many only make cameo appearances). Eli Roth as Donnie Donowitz (""The Bear Jew"" as he is know to the superstitious and scared Nazis) is a particular lost opportunity, because aside from Pitt's character he's the most interesting of the Basterds as well as the most sadistic (in a good way: we're talking about killing Nazis, after all). Diane Kruger's portrayal of double-agent Bridget von Hammerstock isn't terrible, but her character is so underexposed and boring that there's no real reason for her existence in the film. In fact, the entire episode in the bar is so unnecessary, drawn-out, and straight boring that you have to wonder what Tarantino was thinking shooting this scene at all; he could've used that time to undergo more exposition for the Basterds (or at least cut down on the length of the movie). This exact same criticism applies to the British agent and the scene with Churchill. I personally would've liked to have seen Shoshanna's biracial romance brought out a little more, and the entire high command of Germany meeting in a movie theater does seem a little far-fetched even for this movie (although the end result is wonderful).
Overall, I would say take this movie for what it is: a fun, incredibly violent (seriously, don't see this if you're sqeemish) ride. The ending is bittersweet, but anyone who hates the Nazis will still wish this is what had happened in real life (preferably in 1933). Now, some people (at least among critics) are upset because they think the all-Jewish Basterds are so horrifically violent that they are no better than the Gestapo. My response to this is who cares?! The Nazis - specifically the high command and the SS - commit so many atrocities that it really doesn't matter how violent the Basterds respond in kind: they can never be worse than the Nazis they terrorize.

3955209,5,B002MZZMRM,"""Inglourious Basterds,"" directed by Quentin Tarantino, is about World War II, the SS, a band of relentless Nazi killers, movie star spies, and a German war hero, among other things.  It is a rich film in many ways:  plot, star power, performances, photography, film references, and dark humor.  Defying traditional compartmentalization, it offers an intriguing, textured story, action, and nice helpings of satire.  In short, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a feast for movie lovers.

Several stories that will eventually merge unfold separately.

In Nazi-occupied France, SS officer Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), accompanied by several soldiers, comes to a farmhouse in search of Jews who may be hiding there.  He is impeccably uniformed, intimidating, yet polite, even deferential as he speaks with the nervous farmer (Denis Menochet).  Landa questions the farmer  slowly, quietly, yet conveys menace in every syllable.

We then switch to Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), in charge of a unit of Jewish-American soldiers whose mission is to instill fear in the German military by brutally killing Nazis and scalping them.

Finally, we are introduced to Shosanna (Melanie Laurent), who owns and operates a Paris cinema.  A German officer, Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), sees her and is immediately attracted to her, but she rebuffs his advances until she learns he is a celebrated war hero.

Tarantino divides the movie into chapters, taking time to establish characters and make them more than rehashes of previous war movie types.  This is done largely through dialogue, one of Mr. Tarantino's fortes.  Two scenes come to mind.  In one, a group of German soldiers has been attacked by Raine's team.  Many of the Germans have been killed and Raine is questioning their commanding officer about German military installations in the region.  Raine's interview consists of introducing his men and their various unpleasant specialties, and playing a mind game with the officer.  The goal:  finding out where the Germans are entrenched.  The threat:  if you don't reveal this information, there will be severe consequences for you, and they aren't exactly listed in the Geneva Conventions.

A second outstanding dialogue sequence is the aforementioned conversation in the farmhouse between the SS officer and the farmer.  From the outset, we mistrust the oily charm of Landa and we know his mission is more than merely asking a few questions and going on his way.  As he speaks calmly in metaphors, we understand his dark intention, ruthless proficiency, and pride in how well he does his job.  The cuts to the soldiers standing outside and various close-ups of the farmer amplify our dread that something awful is imminent.

This takes us to the performance by Christoph Waltz, an obscure Austrian actor who undoubtedly undertakes his greatest role ever as the multifaceted, multilingual Landa.  Mr. Waltz understands this character perfectly.  Landa refers to himself as a detective, a Teutonic Sherlock Holmes, though those in the area have given him the nickname ""The Jew Hunter.""  Waltz takes his time with his dialogue, very much like a kind uncle speaking to a child.  He smiles, laughs a bit, smokes a pipe, gives compliments, and is always courteous to a fault.  That is, until he bares his claws and pounces.  Mr. Waltz is so perfect as Landa, so memorable, that an Oscar nomination is assured.  He adds tremendous stature to ""Inglourious Basterds.""

Brad Pitt's Raine -- a reference to the 1950's actor Aldo Ray, who appeared in many war movies -- is in charge of committing horrible acts, yet because it is wartime and his subjects are the genocidal Nazis, we like him.  Pitt adopts a Tennessee drawl for Raine, which is funny, though the character itself never crosses over into caricature.  None of Tarantino's characters do.

Shosanna, who becomes important in the film's third act, has a past that makes her a particularly fierce anti-Nazi, though her feelings must be suppressed until the time is exactly right to reveal them.  Ms. Laurent is attractive, but her role -- despite its importance -- is not as showy as the others.  Her story is a framing device, in a sense, for the entire movie.

Mr. Bruhl as Zoller is effective as the golden boy of Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels (Sylvester Groth).  His flirtations with Shosanna are initially innocent and charming, but his persistence leads to dire complications.  Diane Kruger turns in an elegant performance as Bridget von Hammersmark, darling of Third Reich cinema.  Beautiful, sophisticated, talented, and widely popular in Germany, Bridget plays a crucial role in an intricate plot.  A scene between Bridget and Col. Landa darkly mirrors a climactic moment in ""Cinderella,"" in another neat Tarantino touch.

Blending the three stories smoothly showcases the artistry of Tarantino the writer.  Nothing seems out of place or contrived.  Mulling over the movie afterwards, the viewer may come up with some inconsistencies or flaws, but while the movie is unreeling, our attention is riveted.  Tarantino has mastered the technique of placing what's important to his story in the foreground and banishing bothersome details.  If you're like me, you will be surprised at the movie's finale, something I simply didn't see coming.  For Tarantino's tale, however, it's a smooth, appropriate fit.

Rated R for violence and language, ""Inglourious Basterds"" ranks among Quentin Tarantino's best films.  In style and substance, it most closely resembles ""Pulp Fiction.""  What you have here is a Class A script with an A-list cast.  As a person sensitive to overly long movies, I can tell you that the two-and-a-half-hour running time flies by.

3955215,5,B002MZZMRM,"Spoilers... I try to avoid them, but you should definitely see this film before reading this review!

To say that I was eagerly anticipating this movie would be a drastic understatement. Quentin Tarantino is my favorite film maker. His films offer such an intense entertainment experience, equal parts action, comedic, and suspense. He makes films that he would like to watch, always focusing on the viewers experience above all other motivations. In my opinion, Tarantino's second film, Pulp Fiction, is the best film ever made. It's a master class in story telling, brilliantly using non-linear chapters filled with hilarious dialog and intense moments of violence to piece together a classic tale of betrayal and redemption, all while using completely unconventional and innovative script writing and film making techniques that have sense been copied to death by other screenwriters and directors.

I have loved all six of Quentin's films leading up to Inglourious Basterds to varying degrees, but the anticipation hasn't been quite this high for me, this being his first ""epic"" since 2004's Kill Bill: Vol. 2, which combined with it's first volume, is the best film of this current decade. Even though I love Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown, and Death Proof, I particularly love what Quentin refers to as his ""Mount Everests."" These are massive undertakings for him, often taking many, many years to get on the page, much less actually production.

Leading up to opening night, which was 12:01 AM on August 21, 2009, I had heard mixed reports coming from Cannes, but I knew that the art house crowd that populated the critic's screenings at that festival didn't always appreciate the wildly entertaining pulp classics that Quentin consistently provides his audiences. The trailer for the movie purposefully mis-marketed Inglourious Basterds as a bloodthirsty action movie, like a mix of The Dirty Dozen meets Hostel. It didn't completely appeal to me, but I knew Tarantino had way more up his sleeve.

Inglourious Basterds is a story of Jewish vengeance, represented by a band of Jewish American soldiers (a.k.a. the Basterds, led by Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine) terrorizing Nazis behind enemy lines, and a young Jewish French girl seeking revenge for the murder of her family. The man personally responsible for this atrocity is also the one character that ties the entire film together, the antagonist Col. Hans Landa, played brilliantly and enthusiastically by German actor Christoph Waltz, as he is in almost every chapter. The quality of the performance is at least equal to other powerhouse performances this decade (e.g. Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood and Javier Bardem in No Country For Old Men), but I cannot recall the last time I saw an actor this charismatic and so obviously in love with his craft. He won the Best Actor award at this year's Cannes Film Festival, and I fully expect him to take home an Oscar as well.

The film is divided into five chapters, the first of which is titled ""Once Upon a Time, in Nazi Occupied France..."" This title, the beautiful opening shots of the French countryside, and the sampling from the scores from many Sergio Leone films and other westerns gives this scene the feel of a Spaghetti Western set in World War II. Once Hans Landa arrives on screen and enters the dairy farmer's house, there is about twenty minutes of typically great Quentin Tarantino dialogue, only we're having to read it in subtitles! Heaven forbid the mainstream masses knew about that before going to see the latest Brad Pitt movie! Hence, the (brilliant) mis-marketing. The majority of this film is actually in a language other than English, about equal parts German and French, with a dash of Italian for good measure. Our good friend Mr. Christoph Walt speaks each of these languages fluently throughout the film, adding to the already tour de force performance to the point of showing off. Back to the scene. It turns out that Col. Hans Landa is not only an expert linguist but a master detective hired by the Nazis for the express purpose of hunting Jews that have managed to escape the grasp of the German army. As he interrogates this dairy farmer (who looks suspiciously like Stanley Kubrick), the camera gives us more information, and tension builds until the camera finally puts us directly in front of the Col., staring into his heartless eyes for a few very uncomfortable moments. Excuse the hyperbole, but I feel that this is one of the best scenes Tarantino has ever written.

It's not until the second chapter that we're introduced to the Basterds, and most of this scene is spent in the woods during an interrogation of a few hostages that the Basterds have taken after killing and scalping most of the Nazi unit. Here we meet Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger), who gets his own flashback, and Sgt. Donny Donowitz (Eli Roth), also known as the baseball bat wielding ""Bear Jew."" If there is one thing wrong with this movie, it's the amateur delivery of each of Eli Roth's lines. He doesn't have too many, but whenever he opens his mouth I found myself cringing; in my mind a slight casting misstep, in an otherwise flawless cast (yes, I even liked Mike Myers). We also get to see a very animated Hitler, played deliciously over-the-top by Martin Wuttke, rant about the Bear Jew to the point of delirium.

Chapter three re-introduces us to the heroine Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent), now the owner of a quaint movie theater in Paris, and her reluctant relationship to a young Private in the German army. This Private (Daniel Bruhl) is the catalyst for all of the events that follow, although Shosanna is obviously displeased by his advances. His playful banter and her distinct annoyance give us some lighter, humorous reprieve, before thrusting us again into the violent foray. This chapter also contains a great scene featuring a conversation between her and Landa over desert. The way Tarantino uses camera angles and close-ups to evoke the same feelings of tension he made us feel in the opening scene... Simply incredible.

Chapter four features the longest scene in the film that has been described by some as a thirty minute version of Reservoir Dogs that takes place in a basement tavern. There are several moments during this scene in which Quentin's pacing seems to meander until he suddenly causes you to hold your breath in anticipation. The scene builds and builds and when the release comes, it is quick, violent, and glorious; a small taste of things to come.

The fifth and final chapter culminates at the Shosanna's movie theater, at the premiere for a Nazi propaganda film which most of the German high command is attending. Each respective party of vengeful Jews gets basically the same idea, and the beauty is in the execution of each of these plans. One is a plan of desperation in which everything seems to go wrong. The other is a long gestating, deeply poetic, primal scream of a plan that culminates in some of the most haunting and enduring images Tarantino, or anyone, has put on screen.

I've listened to and read many critics and film geeks argue the meaning and purpose of this film, and some have submitted some pretty good arguments. There is definitely much irony throughout the film, especially when related to the violence. When a German officer is beat to death with a baseball bat, Tarantino presents him as an honorable soldier rather than a repulsive monster, which makes the beating and subsequent guffaws from the audience sit uneasily with a discerning audience member. Then there are the images of a grossly over-animated Adolf Hitler and his cronies, in a movie theater, their laughter and cheers erupting into a blood-thirsty frenzy as they watch a propaganda film that glorifies the death of hundreds of American soldiers. All the while a group of blood-thirsty Americans clap and cheer at the insanity that ensues, which can be described as a violent orgasm of death, or maybe... a holocaust.

There is so much substance here to be analyzed and scrutinized, but Tarantino himself has mentioned that he doesn't even try to examine the subtext of his films, although he recognizes it is there. Mostly he is determined to create a masterpiece each time he makes a film, and not for art's sake, but for ours. He is determined to create entertainment for an audience to enjoy over and over again, always finding something new to take away from it. I've seen Inglourious Basterds three times so far in the theater, and plan on seeing it once more before it leaves. Each time I notice more and more, and it leaves me somewhat contemplative, but always smiling.

One obvious theme is the power of cinema, and Quentin has mentioned that this film is essentially a love letter to cinema. Tarantino has always been accused of stealing from other movies, however, the accusers hardly attempt to apply the same level of scrutiny to other beloved directors (e.g. Martin Scorsese) who have not only revolutionized film, but as devout students of film, borrowed heavily from the great film makers who have come before and inspired them to make film in the first place. With Inglourious Basterds, Quentin Tarantino has melded together classic themes, settings, camera shots and musical cues with his unique style of writing and directing to create a completely fresh and unique experience. The final scene is delivered almost like a punch-line, or maybe the closing message of a morality tale; either way it is just the right touch to top off his cinematic masterpiece.

Monsieur Tarantino, to you, your cast, and your crew I say, ""Bravo!""

3955216,4,B002MZZMRM,"When this film came out earlier this year,
I figured Quentin Tarrantino, Brad Pitt...should be good!
To me it was, with the exception of some of the
scenes which could've been cut shorter and their points
would have still been made.
But other than that, I loved it!
I went with two of my freinds and one of them acted
like the graphic violence was just too much for her
delicate sensibilities, and I thought to myself
""DUH!-It's Quentin Tarrantino!, i.e. Reservoir Dogs?
--Pulp Fiction?--From Dusk Til' Dawn?---Kill Bill 1 & 2?--
I think everyone knows by now that graphic violence
is a given when you see his movies!""

My other freind, a guy, found it just to be
""just okay"", so see there you go...it's not a film
for everybody, but I found it to rank right up there
with Tarrantino's better work as a director.
As for Brad Pitt, I'm very bias when it comes to him...
I just think he and Johnny Depp can do no wrong in
anything that they play in!  (-:
But putting that aside and trying to be as analytical
as I can be for the sake of this review, I really found
his character to be quite believable as the ringleader of
a bunch of nazi-killing renegade soliders in WW2 who
suffer no fools and take no prisoners!
Eli Roth, the director of a lot of modern-day horror
fare was just that...HORRIFYING in his role as the
baseball bat-swinging, nazi-hating psycho ""BEAR JEW""
who Brad's character refers to as THE REAPER!!
Brad effects his Missouri/Oklahoma southern accent
for this role, even though the character says he hails
from Tennessee!---But most people can't detect the difference.
Of course, being a QT film, there are plenty of sub plots
and plot twists all interwoven throughout, as well as
his trademark dark humor, culminating in an explosive ending.
So to those of you who haven't already seen it,
I'd say rent it first before buying it just to see if
it's your cup of tea. But I say it's a 4 star film for
sure, subtracting a point for the extra long scenes
that I mentioned earlier.
I have the 2-Disc version because there are some
great extras and deleted scenes that were cut,
but probably could've stayed to explain certain details,
like what's the backstory on Brad's character,
and how did he get those rope burn scars around his neck?  (HMMMMMM!!)",1257552000,2,2265,4.560196560196561

3955220,5,B002MZZMRM,"I was fortunate enough in 1994 to attend a test screening of Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, shortly after its triumph at Cannes and months before it premiered in the U.S. Because I saw it before it was acknowledged as a game-changing sensation, I was completely unprepared for my mind being blown. I remember sitting in the dark theater, sort of giggling to myself in a low voice, because I was in absolutely alien territory; I had no idea what was going to come next, and I knew I'd never seen anything like it before. (Tarantino attended the screening and I got a chance afterwards to shake his hand, after which I just walked away, rather than say, ""huminah-huminah-huminah."")

Coming out of Inglourious Basterds, I realized that Tarantino is still blowing my mind, as he has with each of his post-Pulp Fiction films. This is not because I think his films are perfect, and not even necessarily because he's my favorite director, but rather because I think Tarantino is trying for something in his films that's absolutely different than anyone else's work.

Basterds is a multi-threaded take on a World War II film. It weaves together a series of stories taking place in Nazi-occupied France, and it's exciting, suspenseful, thoughtful and funny (Brad Pitt is an absolute hoot, and he, Christoph Waltz and Melanie Laurent pretty much walk away with the film). But like every other Tarantino film, it's actually really all about movies above all other concerns, including plot.

That's where Tarantino runs into trouble with some critics. They say that his films are all about movies, not real life, that the films are simply a series of film references. The worst criticism? His films are mere exercises in genre.

I think that's missing the point. Yes, Tarantino loves genre films and loves to mix genres. But he's doing some remarkable things with them. I think he's trying to build serious art with the raw materials of genre. It's akin to taking an electric guitar, an accordion and a triangle and writing a symphony with them - and succeeding.

Some say that Pulp Fiction was his most mature work, if by ""mature"" we mean conventionally artistic. Under this view, later films, which more explicitly take use the mechanics of gangster, blaxploitation, revenge and, oddly enough, European art cinema, are less ""personal,"" less serious. But that may reflect more about what you think about genre than about anything else. If you believe genre is artless, low-brow moviemaking, then the use of the film vocabulary from genre in service of personal, artistic filmmaking is confusing and unsettling. If you can accept that art is about personal vision, not the tools you use to express that vision, then Tarantino's approach can be exhilarating and thrilling.

Employing that personal vision, Tarantino has no problem using David Bowie's great ""Cat People (Putting Out Fire)"" in a period film, or splashing a blaxploitation-era logo to flash the name of one particularly colorful character, or using narration when it's necessary and forgetting about it when it's not, or opting for long stretches of subtitled dialog (I think this was Tarantino - who's calling card is his expertise in dialogue - tying one hand behind his back for the fun of it). Tarantino even uses little signifiers - signifiers as little as the fonts he uses in his ""chapter"" markers and in the end credits - to let you know you're in his unique, personal world.

As Tarantino himself said in a great appearance on the Howard Stern radio show recently, his work is unambiguously his work - you'll either love him or hate him, and that's because he has a singular, idiosyncratic voice. I love his work and I can't wait to see what he comes up with next.

One more thought [and mild spoiler alert] - I hope it doesn't become an issue that in Basterds, Tarantino is playing fast and loose with the facts of world history (let's just say that at some point Basterds and history go down different roads). It's called an alternate history - a device used by everyone from comic book artists to serious writers like James Ellroy. Is there any real concern that people will mistake Tarantino-esque fiction for historical fact? If that's the case, we should worry a little less about Tarantino and a little more about our education system.",1257033600,3,4305,4.879616963064295

As far as historically accurate, it is of course is a wonderful fantasy portrayal by Tarantino.  I HAVE NEVER BEEN A BIG fan of his, but I am now.

3955222,5,B002MZZMRM,"What can I say about Inglourious Basterds? Unique, inventive, smart writing and excellent acting throughout are what first comes to mind when thinking about this film. Be warned, there is a lot of talking (the first scene is a 20 minute conversation), even for a Tarantino flick, but the dialogue is excellent and the characters are memorable. The only negative is that some scenes do drag just a little, but not enough to bore the life out of you. There are also some well crafted action scenes that are brutal, though they played a much more minor role than I expected.

Brad Pitt turns in a fine performance and provides most of the comedic moments. Just don't expect him to be on the screen all the time. Unlike what you see in the trailers, he and his ""Basterds"" play supporting roles. There is no real leading role here, but one does take a commanding presence over all the rest. New to many people who will be watching this movie, Christoph Waltz delivers a performance to remember and will at minimum get nominated for an Oscar. He is clever, charming, slimy, unpredictable and evil. Expertly acted evil dudes seem to be cleaning up the supporting actor categories every year now. Javier Bardem won it for No Country for Old Men in 2007 and the late Heath Ledger did the same for the The Dark Knight in 2008. Why break tradition this year, especially given the complexity of Waltz's acting here. He already won the Cannes Film Festival Best Actor award. The two main female actresses, Melanie Laurent (nomination worthy) and Diane Kruger, were both captivating and added the right elements this film needed. In fact, every person on screen seemed right for the role they were given. Well, horror director and buddy of Tarantino, Eli Roth, was a little off at times, but thankfully he has a smaller role and lets his baseball bat do most of the talking for him.

Don't expect any historical accuracy, just get ready for a wild fantasy WWII movie that only Tarantino can pull off. His signature music and song selection is also some of his best. One thing is for sure, Quentin Tarantino is back on top in a BIG way.

3955223,2,B002MZZMRM,"Quentin Tarantino is a great filmmaker.  Just ask him.

And he calls this movie his ""masterpiece.""  ""Some of my best writing ever.""  The accolades were pouring in...from Quentin.

But it's been a while since I've enjoyed any of his films.  The last time I remember liking anything he did was JACKIE BROWN.  He had an incredible cast and that film showed a new maturity in him.  Everything since has been his worst indulgences.  The KILL BILL movies were all over the place.  DEATH PROOF was worse than any of the drive-in chase movies that ripped up the screens in the 70s.

So now we have INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS.  Is it possible that Quentin is trying to make his misspellings a part of his schtick to diffuse Jane Hamsher's book where she reprints a handwritten note from Quentin complimenting her beautiful ""leggs""?  Or does the guy really just not know how to use spell check?  That's not a slam: I'm genuinely curious.

As interesting and stylistically well done as this movie is, it still doesn't help the viewer navigate its story.  Was anyone squeamish about seeing American soldiers brutalizing Nazis and even scalping them with stomach-churning sound effects?  With our soldiers in two war fronts in the world right now, do we really need this characterization as entertainment playing throughout the world?  I wonder how this film plays to a young generation woefully ignorant of the true heroism of the American soldier in WWII.

I nearly fell asleep during Chapter Four so I'm not sure just how long that conversation went before something happened.  And, when it did, I felt like I'd already seen this scene's climax in RESEVOIR DOGS.  ""Brevity is the soul of wit,""
Quentin.  If you'd stop watching crappy grindhouse movies (and blowing your career on rehashing them) and pick up a book once in a while, you'd know where that came from...and what it means.

The characters are shallow and don't really come across as anyone you'd root for, let alone like.  There is no emotional pay-off in any of the closing scenes.  Tarantino is as dispassionate about these people as he is true to history.  I don't mind that he veered so far away from actual history...but couldn't it at least been more fun?

Bottom line: Tarantino is too enamored with himself and only indulgences a frustrating immaturity.  He knows how to shoot scenes and always succeeds in making a visual experience...but his writing and thinking haven't developed past a teenage gamer spitting sound effects while jerking his joystick.",1255996800,20,2508,4.87914691943128
3955224,5,B002MZZMRM,"This is in regards to the Theatrical release of Inglourious Basterds.

The movie is Tarantino's WWII epic. An outstanding international cast, some trumping shall I dare say, Pitt's performance, who was great with what he had to work with, I equated his performance with that when he starred in Snatch, which was an ensemble cast and he was just a small puzzle in a much larger picture. I must say same goes here, doesn't mean he doesn't bore you with his performance in Inglourious Basterds. Some will argue that there should have been more scenes with the Basterds, I disagree, the story was fine, where both plots do converge at the end.

Christoph Waltz international actor, extraordinary as Colonel Hans Landa! If he doesn't get a Best Supporting Actor Nod then I don't know what to think of the Academy Awards any more.

Melanie Laurent who plays Shoshannah, who survives when her family is murdered by the SS and Landa. She has plans of her own to get her revenge!

The movie has Tarantino written all over it, dialogue, which can be long and winded at times, foot fetish, a  food scene ala Big Kahuna Burger but with a french dessert, A 1970s title card using same lettering that was in Kill Bill the male nurse and his yellow Truck what he has written on the back, I think we all know what that said.

Revenge is the focal point, strong women characters such as Death Proof and Kill Bill movies are present.

A scene reminiscent of the beginning of Reservoir Dogs, everyone at a table talking.

And Tarantino's ode to movies, this guy is a walking talking Movie enclyclopedia and he doesn't mind showing his knowledge. He did the same in Reservoir Dogs, when Mr White, Mr. Orange and Mr. Pink and Nice Guy eddie are all driving and are discussing Pam Grier.

Camera angle where it points up at the actors faces for a scene.

Story broken into Chapters

And his signature soundtrack, using a david bowie song for a WWII period movie.... how awesome.

Tarantino takes a genre, specifically a ""Men on a Mission""--- that's where the Basterds come in, takes a Revenge story and mixes it. I think it's a plot device just to move the story along, to be honest this could have been two movies, one just about the Basterds and one about Shoshanah.

I believe Tarantino has said this is his spaghetti War movie, very heavily influenced by Leone and the spaghetti westerns, and borrowing title from the original Inglorious [...] which was strictly a ""Men on a Mission"" movie, that's all this movie has in common with that movie.

This is Tarantino at his best, at his most top form, is it as great a Pulp fiction, I don't think it will ever come close, but it's better than Death Proof. I am definitely going to get the Blu Ray when it is released.

The thing is with Tarantino he takes genres and bends them and mashes them to what he likes, look at the kill bill movies, took a revenge story with old Hong Kong grind house martial art flicks and mixed it, an ode to those kind of movies. And this is his ode to those WWII movies, and spaghetti Westerns.

Why do we go see a Tarantino film? I tell you why I go, interesting characters, cool soundtracks, the dialogue, unique way of reinventing a genre... don't dare say he is unoriginal.... look at Hollywood, everyone in Hollywood is unoriginal. There's always remakes, re imaginings, sequels, prequels in the works. So don't dare say Tarantino is the same, he knows what he is doing, he knows his films are homages to what he grew up with and watched and who influenced him. For some reason he is fascinated with the 70's haha.

Oh and if you guys ever wondered why the title is miss spelled here is a theory.... granted you have already scene the movie.... Pitt and the Basterds have captured a Nazi patrol, you see Pitt emerge and lays his rifle against the stone wall, you see the misspelling of the Inglourious Basterds... he's a good ole southern boy from Tennessee who apparently cannot spell a damn so that's how he thinks it's spelled hence the miss-spelling.",1255910400,7,4017,4.5569444444444445
3955225,4,B002MZZMRM,"There are elements of a Quentin Tarantino film you can always count on: upturning genre conventions, astonishing humorous violence, strong female characters, extended conversational detours, and of course, genuinely original artistic and visual intelligence. Right from its engaging, nail-biting beginning, Inglourious Basterds overflows with his now signature style.

A group of hardened Nazi-killers stalk their prey in Nazi-occupied France as a Jewish cinema owner plots to take down top-ranking SS officers during the official premiere of a high-profile German propaganda film. As far as Lt. Aldo Raine ,aka Aldo the Apache (Brad Pitt), is concerned, his mission is to strike fear into the heart of Adolph Hitler by brutally murdering as many goose-steppers as possible, or die trying. In order to accomplish that goal, Lt. Raine recruits a ruthless team of cold-blooded killers known as ""The Basterds"" which includes baseball bat-wielding Bostonian Sgt. Donnie Donowitz, aka The Bear Jew (Eli Roth), and steely psychopath Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger), among others. When The Basterds' secret rendezvous with turncoat German actress Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) goes awry, they learn that the Nazi's will be staging the French premiere of ""The Nation's Pride,"" a rousing propaganda film based on the exploits of German hero Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brhl), at a modest theater owned by Jewish cinemaphile Shoshanna Dreyfus (Mlanie Laurent), posing as French after the brutal murder of her family by the ruthless Col. Hans Landa (Christopher Waltz). As The Basterds hatch an explosive plan to take out as many Nazis as possible at the premiere, they remain completely oblivious to the fact that Shoshanna, too, longs to bring the Third Reich to its knees, and that she's willing to sacrifice her beloved theater in the process.

Laying his story out in five chapters, Tarantino manages to keep his densely populated tale clear; we always understand the character's goals, and see where they conflict with each other. He fills each chapter with protracted verbal showdowns, and he knows well enough to punctuate all the verbal dexterity with blasts of kinetically staged violence: it's hard not to flinch when Sgt. Donnie Donowitz uses a Louisville Slugger to bash in a Nazi's head. As memorable as the movie's violence is, Tarantino ratchets up the tension with his words, and he's far more interested in the build-up than the release, something that might alienate those looking for a wall-to-wall bloodbath. Inglourious Basterds doesn't skip along swiftly, but anybody with a taste for Tarantino dialogue will savor every minute.

Tarantino has always cast his films to perfection, and the performers here know how to get the most out of the ornate language. Brad Pitt uses a hilarious Southern drawl, and his attempts at speaking Italian are a comic highlight. As a German movie star spying for the Allies, Diane Kruger manages to be sexy, tough, smart, and flirty. But she isn't the only hard-nosed dame in the cast, thanks to Mlanie Laurent's striking performance; the French actress embodies both Shosanna's determination, as well as her fear, with equal aplomb. But as good as the entire cast is, Christoph Waltz walks away with the movie. His calmness makes the simple act of eating strudel more frightening that you could've ever thought possible. He exudes calm logic and mercilessness, and he plays Landa so matter-of-factly that even when the character does something unexpected it always seems thoroughly plausible. Even the opening scene with Colonel Hans Landa interrogating a French farmer on the whereabouts of his missing Jewish neighbors is an early highlight.  As their conversation grows increasingly intense with each line, Landa knows exactly how to slowly inflict psychological stress on his subject so that the victim will eventually break, an element of the character that Waltz underplays to arresting affect, building one genial-seeming killer, and he's all the more terrifying because of it.

Although the actors are flawless, it is Tarantino whose name will go hand in hand with the film, as he is by the modern definition of the word an ""auteur."" It's impossible to miss the distinctive  mark he puts on all his films, but as an artist he doesn't repeat himself. Because Tarantino keeps evolving, Inglourious Basterds might not be the movie you'd expect, you may even find that the movie was 50 minutes longer than it should be, but never, ever, expect nothing less than a refreshing experience in cinema that will take your faith in innovation to new highlights. A new War Classic is born, simple as that.",1255910400,12,4654,5.223560910307898

Writer/director Quentin Tarantino's WWII adventure is gripping, but overrated.  The running time of nearly three hours flew by, and I was riveted by the stories of the woman and the Nazi; however, the Basterds themselves did not hold my interest for a moment.  Brad Pitt, as their leader, really stands out for his awful performance when contrasted with the many wonderful but lesser known actors in this film, such as Diane Kruger playing a German movie star who is also a double agent.  Tarantino's gimmicks are not as numerous as they are in some of his other projects, but they are jarring when they occur.  Many see them as exuberant nods to B-movie history, but they strike me as indulgences that rarely serve the story.  Nevertheless, the rest of the film is so good that I have no trouble recommending it.

No one can (sanely) deny Tarantino's considerable skills as a filmmaker.  Those skills are unquestionably on display here.

All of the actors turn in great performances, with Til Schweiger not getting enough attention for his visual portrayal of what is perhaps the most intimidating German soldier in movie history.  Luckily for the Inglourious Basterds, he is one of them.

But once she hears all the Nazi warlords and Hitler Himself will be there,she decides to exact revenge for her people. Little does she know that Aldo ,his assasins are going there with the same purpose.

There is alot of blood,They scalp people's heads off & at one point they play baseball with a guys head. There is also alot of choking and bloody battles scenes,but Tarantino always plays really eery music when the really bad scenes come up so you can close your eyes and plug your ears. That was really thoughtful of him. I realize it had to be this way,because war is hell and Tarantino wanted to show this ,so we never repeat what Hitler tried to do again.

Its really funny too. Mike Myers has a really campy part as a British guy(he sounds mini me in Austin Powers) and Christopher Waltz as the creepy Hans Landa is almost cartoonish as the bad guy.

Brad Pitt plays Lt. Aldo Raine, a Jewish-American solider leading a group of other Jewish-American soldiers, named ""The Inglourious Basterds"", into France. Their job is to do one thing- exact their revenge against the Nazis for their horrible crimes against humanity. They plan to brutally scalp the Nazis and kill them. As Raine says, ""We're killin' Nazis, and business is bloomin'"". They have also targeted a movie theater, where the premiere of the aforementioned Nazi propaganda movie is to take place.

Shosanna Dreyfus is a French Jewish girl who has fled her home after the Nazis have massacred her family. She flees to a movie theater that her aunt gave to her long after she died. One night, she meets a charming young man outside the theater, and the next day she sees him again. She is annoyed by him, but is invited by the man to lunch. Turns out he is a Nazi soldier, and that he has brought her to his Nazi family. Hans Linda, the Nazi leader who massacred her family, tells Shosanna and the Nazi family that her theater is the perfect place to premiere the movie.

Every minute of its length is epic, and the whole time, you're glued to your theater seat, wanting to know what happens next. The way Quentin Tarantino structures the plot, he sticks to his usual ""Chapters"" formula, and presents the two stories in a way in which in the last 45 minutes, they come together like pieces of a puzzle. This is enough to keep any moviegoer satisfied!

As for performances, every single performance in this is amazing. Pitt does a brilliant job at portraying the cold and brutal personality of Aldo Raine. Also in the film is Diane Kruger, who plays Bridget, a woman the Basterds meet along the way. She has proved herself to be quite the actress over time, and with her being German, she is definitely an easy target for the role. But the REAL star of the show is Christoph Waltz, playing Hans Linda. He steals the show in every aspect here, and he's the type you wouldn't imagine playing a cold and ruthless Nazi.

If you're a big fan of Tarantino, you can also expect his usual trademarks: Red Apple Cigarettes, The woman's feet shot, the usage of music from other movies (the music of Ennio Morricone is a huge character here), and the homage to other films. All of these are shown in the film. The film pays homage to European WWII movies, and does it brilliantly. Also, his dialogue, which is something he's been known for, is the best dialogue in any of his films.

Think of ""Inglourious Basterds"" as ""Pulp Fiction"" set in Nazi-Occupied in France. In short,"" Inglourious Basterds"" is a phenomenal piece of film-making and proved to be an excellent day at the cinema.",1254182400,2,3279,4.644827586206897
3955231,1,B002MZZMRM,"The blood-thirsty, revenge-laden, vicious, right-wing premise of ""Inglourious Basterds"" ignores the reality of wars, armies, and the real lives of soldiers. No soldier in any army should be scalped or dismembered merely because he is a member of any opposing army. For in a vast majority of cases he had no choice in entering that army or of wearing any particular uniform.

Therefore even American thugs, bullies, and mindless killers don't have any right to commit atrocities just because they're on the ""right"" side of any war, or in the ""right"" army. To picture our own boys and men in uniform during WWII as the monsters in this film is shameful.

The Axis side of WWII was fought by draftees into the German Army from many European countries and ethnic groups. In every country that Hitler's war machine invaded, boys and men of partly-German parentage were drafted. They had no choice of whether they would serve as German soldiers. They little choice of which service or unit in which they would serve.

Therefore, ""Germans"" and ""Nazis"", as this filmmaker uses them, were not interchangeable terms. As our war propaganda, they were understandable; but not as terms of reference in popular entertainment more than sixty years later.

Any German boy, living in Germany from 1933 to 1945, who dared to say ""I'm not a Nazi, I'm a Christian-Democrat"", so I shouldn't be drafted, he could be sent to prison or to a concentration camp. After the 1938 Anschluss into Vienna, if a Swiss-resident, partly-German, partly-Jewish foreign student, on being called up for military service by the German war machine, dared to say that he was both a Christian Democrat like his father, and partly Jewish, he'd have ended up in a concentration camp in Poland.

However, the German Army of WWII had a Code of Military Justice so strong that even the Nazis couldn't weaken them. It had been designed to protect German soldiers from heavy-handed abuse by non-coms and officers. That is one of the reasons why the SS was formed; to get around those rules.

Generals like Erwin Rommel were loved by their soldiers because he was strong enough to require of Hitler that the Geneva Convention, not the SS, would govern the way that his men would fight the war, at least in North Africa. Toward the end of WWII, when Hitler was losing the war, and after General Rommel had been executed, some tank and infantry units of the German Army were transferred to the SS, without the consent of their officers, non-coms, or soldiers.

So even men assigned to the SS in 1944 to 1945 weren't necessarily ""free game"" for Allied manhunters. To say otherwise in a modern film is a gross distortion of history.

I had a friend, a Swiss-resident German-Jewish friend drafted in 1938 after the Nazis invaded Vienna, where he was an art student.  He hid in plain sight in the German Army for six years until he was liberated in 1944 by Canadians from Quebec.

His name was William. H. ""Lucky"" Dingler, a multi-lingual German Army Signal Corpsman. For 21 months he was attached to the original Afrika Korps, and worked for Erwin Rommel as a proud member of the DAK.  He was brilliant; a human computer. What he saw he could draw perfectly. What he learned, what he heard, he never forgot. He kept the younger men for whom he was responsible fed and alive as much as he could.

He told me how he survived. He memorized the German Army's Military Code of Justice in boot camp. Then he accumulated medals for excellent military skills while serving with several units. A pre-war sophisticated man-about-town, during the war he consistently played the rarely-neat, partly out-of uniform, private soldier, and thus avoided any promotion to a rank higher than Staff Corporal, so that his Jewish heritage wouldn't be discovered in a background check.

When he was pressured to go to Officer's Candidate School, he deliberately committed a courts martial offense. He survived a trial in which he could have gotten the death penalty, coming out of it with three weeks of detention, delayed, because he knew the Code of Military Justice.  He had made himself too good to push around and too incorrigible to promote. (Acting this way, he won the German Iron Cross twice, the Italian Croce de Guerra, and a chest-full of campaign badges.)

He estimated that 10% of the army were snitches for the Gestapo. So to survive, and because replacements so often quickly died, he made very few friends.

In the post-war de-Nazification process carried out by the Allies, he was ""held harmless""; not guilty of any blame for the war, even though he was a skillful and decorated soldier in the wrong, German army.

9,000,000 German soldiers didn't survive. Most of them were draftees, just like my friend.",1253923200,39,4745,4.831072749691739
3955232,4,B002MZZMRM,"Possibly the most brilliantly written screenplay of Tarantino's since Pulp, but some of the scenes should have been cut or reduced for length. Yet, doing that, would have cut out some of the best and most creative parts. Too much of the movie was taken up by conversations across a table. I understand why some of these scenes weren't trimmed though, because the dialogue is so sharp and well done. Yet, by the fourth or fifth 20 minute scene of people sitting at a table talking, you wished they'd get to some more nazi smashing.

Brad Pitt rejuvenates his career, showing his range and comedic timing and the smash a Nazi fantasy works to perfection, as long as you know what you're coming to see.

The only thing that bothered me, other than the length of some of the talky scenes, was the hard to believe change of attitude of the most hated character in the film, Col. Hans Landa, played by Christop Waltz. His pursuit of jews throughout the film is its backbone, yet he too quickly leaves his goals on the ground behind him.

Inglourious [...]is a well-acted and well-written slam fest that could have been shorter, but ultimately does something that most have feared to do to this extent, turn history into fantasy.",1253750400,,1222,4.648148148148148
3955233,5,B002MZZMRM,"Historical accuracy certainly wasn't the first thing that renowned director Quentin Tarantino had in mind when creating Inglourious Basterds, and as we see in this film, that's not necessarily a bad thing at all. Using his traditional blend of sharp dialogue, explicit violence, and overlapping story lines, Tarantino has created an epic, grandiose and visually stunning film that easily ranks among the summer's best, and in my opinion, his best film since Pulp Fiction.

  For as tense and action packed as this film is, dialogue plays a vital role in sustaining the ever mounting tension in this film and we are made aware of this right from the very beginning. The film opens with a brilliantly crafted scene set on a dairy farm in rural France where we are introduced to Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), who is one of  the most ferocious and calculating villains in recent memory, and who I feel could be a possible sleeper for Best Actor. He proves to be a master of interrogation and has knack for spotting anyone holding back the truth. What is amazing to me is how viscous and intimidating his character is in his words alone. He is sophisticated, suave and well spoken yet is as ruthless and sadistic as anyone of the Basterds who are after his scalp. Despite its casual appearance and heavy reliance on dialogue, the first scene is filled with tension and suspense as the audience can almost feel that something disastrous could happen at any second, and Col. Landa is the primary reason for this.

  The film also follows Brad Pitt's character, Lt. Aldo Raine and his ""Basterds"" who are on a mission that has simply one goal'kill as many Nazis as possible (On a side not, I really wish Brad Pitt didn't have so much of the Hollywood glam and spot light surrounding him because many times people overlook what an excellent actor he is, and this film is no exception). Lt. Raine and his Basterds are ruthless and uncompromising in their doings, beating and scalping almost every Nazi they encounter. And the ones that they do let go leave with a painful and permanent parting gift and a reminder to Hitler and his regime just exactly what the Basterds are all about.

  One thing that I was completely surprised by yet really didn't notice at first was how much of this film isn't in English. Almost half of the film is spoken in French and German using English subtitles. One of the reasons I don't feel I noticed it so much is how visually engaging the film is. It is filmed in a way that it almost comes off as a graphic novel put onto screen. The film climaxes in a heart-pounding and beautifully stunning 30 minute finale where all 3 story lines finally come to together during a German movie premiere in Paris in which Hitler and all leading members of the Third Reich are attending. It is a fitting end to the Jewish revenge story that never happened.

  Inglourious Basterds is absurd, funny, over the top, gaudy, and yet oddly moving and endearing at the same time. Quentin Tarantino stated before filming this movie that he wanted this to be his masterpiece and the last line of the film is very blunt in echoing those thoughts of his. A masterpiece? Not quite, but still one hell of a movie.

3955235,5,B002MZZMRM,"""Inglorious Basterds"" is very misleading, proving that Quentin Tarantino really does know how to pull off a prank or two: what one expects is a full-on action extravaganza, but instead gets a bitingly, intricately grandiose Shakespearean play, dealing with Nazism, however fantastical, loyalty, revenge, forbidden love, cultural mishmash and, what foreign language lovers like me will consider golden - linguistic plasticity.

A lot of reviewers, casual and professionals alike, have already commented what is there to comment about this magnificent film, but few has really touched upon the film's musical stance on language. Tarantino is a very clever and erudite writer, though at times very self-indulgent, but I suppose that is only the hallmarks of his genuine passion and talent for creating dialogues that flow like river that reaches to no end. This film greatly emphasizes, especially by virtue of Christoph Waltz, who is a complete shock to the system thanks to his Oscar-winning performance as a paradoxically lovable but utterly evil and sadistic Hans Landa, that words are just as pointedly dangerous as a mad Nazi's angry bullet.

Tarantino's words glide, waltz and dance, continuously in such fervent blaze, and ever so gloriously through the maddening syntactical landscape of foreign territories, at times not for the sake of sneakily showing off cultural and social superiority, but as necessity, on the basis of life and death, to deal with enemies as stealthily and efficiently as possible. Words, in other words, bad pun unintended, are tools, like the aforementioned angry bullet: a mispronounced word, an accent, or even any semantical byproducts of spoken words could result into a decapitated head. For example, the basement tavern scene involving the Basterds and actress-turned-spy Bridget von Hammersmark trying not to blow their cover, in the face of an increasingly suspecting German soldier, is a perfect example of a harrowing tense cinematic scene, dripped with dread and suspense, all in the name of linguistic interaction. Who needs guns when you have German, French, even Italian?",1253318400,2,2117,5.412121212121212
3955236,2,B002MZZMRM,"The latest film written/directed by QuentinTarantino, the surrealistic phantasmagoria Inglorious Basterds was a big disappointment for me. I found it irritating, boring, and full of Tarantino who did not make a movie about WWII but about himself of course, about his love for movies, this time for spaghetti westerns and his interest in the German movies of the Third Reich period. All his movies are about himself and often it works. I absolutely love Pulp Fiction and believe it is his glorious achievement. I like a lot Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown and both volumes of Kill Bill. I said more than once that Tarantino does not make profound statements or ask eternal questions, but what he does do is entertain, and he does it marvelously - with style, class, irony, wit, and talent. Deathproof was the first alarming signal that more than anything Tarantino loves to talk and talk he does to the point that the viewer gets bored and frustrated even while watching supposedly fast and violent movie. It only got worse in Inglorious Basterds. Something is terribly missing in QT's vision of the important and tragic period of European and World history. Oh, his movie looks splendid, art direction is the best ever in any QT's films. The soundtrack is killer as always, and I'll make sure to have it. The first Chapter of the film is perfection. Pure and simple, the masterwork of setting, writing and acting. If anything, the opening introduces Christoph Waltz and Denis Menochet in the star making roles. But you know what? I am really surprised that Waltz's work has been proclaimed something of revelation by the critics while Malcolm McDowell who played the same type with relish in The Passage (1979) had been but crucified by the critics. Back to Basterds, it all goes rapidly downhill after the opening scene. It seems to me that Tarantino was under the spell of his own self-importance. He could not force himself to make some or should I say many scenes shorter. Some scenes only exist because Tarantino had to make the participants speak out his witty remarks and be the part of the snappy dialogs, his trade mark, even if and when the scenes did not make any sense and just went on and on. I think that in his last movie, Tarantino lost the sense of rhythm, and the film stuck more than once. I won't say that Inglorious Basterds is a total failure but it is so pointless, self-adoring, and often empty that sadly the brilliance can't always shine through inglorious, arrogant and pompous emptiness, and yes, stupidity. I don't think the movie problem was total lack of historical accuracy. It is not the first time, the film makers or the writers take liberty with history to create their own interpretation and vision of the epoch and the events that influenced it. One of my favorite writers since my young days, French Alexander Dumas, who is famous for highly successful historical-adventure novels, had said about his works, ""Sometimes I have to lift up the skirts of history to make Her good sons"". The father of The Three Musketeers (1844) and The Count of Monte Cristo could be justly proud of his creations. The result of Tarantino's violation of history has produced just that, inglorious basterds.

My rating is 2.5-3/5 - for art direction, soundtrack, Chapter one, and introduction of Christoph Waltz, M&eacute;lanie Laurent, and Denis Menochet. Another point goes for using different languages throughout the film.",1252886400,18,3441,4.892123287671233
3955237,5,B002MZZMRM,"Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, this quirky film is a breath of fresh air among the usual predictable films that characterize the movies.  It plays like a comic strip on steroids - outrageous and charismatic with unpredictable twists and turns.  Basically, it re-writes the history of World War II.  There is violence throughout, in full bloody living color, the kind that is targeted to make an audience squirm.  And there are holes in the story so large that it makes the plot unbelievable.  But who cares about all its faults when one is encased in watching cinema magic.  That's how I felt throughout and why this film which clocked in at 2 hours and 32 minutes actually felt short to me.

So leave everything you ever knew about World War II outside the theater.  And let yourself be transformed by the story, the characters, and the outrageousness of it all.  Brad Pitt is the star in the film, playing the leader of a small group of Jewish American soldiers who wreck havoc on the Nazis.  His is in the film merely for his name though because that particular role could have been played by any number of well-known American actors.  The best performance is by the Austrian actor Christopher Waltz, fluent in English, German, French and Italian.  He is evil, pure evil in a sardonic and polished sophisticated way.  He's the villain we all love to hate and his performance is over the top.  Then there is Melanie Laurant cast as a French Jewish woman whose family has been massacred.  She owns a movie theater in France and plots her revenge.  There's also a German actress, played by Diane Kruger, who is an undercover spy and a Nazi war hero who is having a film made about his glory.

The plot is about how all of this comes together.  But the plot is only one element of this film because the genius of it lies in its creation.  It's violent, it's bloody and it's weird.  It couldn't have happened this way at all.  But I loved every frame of it and give it one of my highest recommendations although it is certainly not for everybody.",1252800000,,2056,4.562841530054645
3955238,1,B002MZZMRM,"This is such an incredibly stupid and obscene war porn movie that I literally couldn't watch it - I had to get up and stand by the side of the theater, where the walkway blocked the screen.

At heart, the movie is some sort of a Jewish revenge fantasy (and I am not being either anti-Semitic or very original in saying so - that term has already appeared in published critical reviews of this movie).  Not only did nothing of the sort of violence against German soldiers depicted in this movie happen in World War II, but it is a disgrace to the servicemen of the U.S. Army to suggest, even in a highly fanciful Hollywood movie, that such brutal treatment of POW's was condoned and even encouraged by the U.S. Army.

And yes, I am aware that German POW's were shot by US soldiers on a number of occasions in WWII, but large scale scalping and using their heads for target practice with baseball bats was not, and the movie denigrates the memory of all American soldiers with its gory depictions of such actions.

So tell me, Quentin Tarantino, just what is the difference between this movie you just made and the Abu Ghraib photos?  Do they not both depict American soldiers violating the Geneva Convention in a way that we hope our enemies would not, and do they not both cast disrepute on the U.S. Army?  The difference of course is that your movie is just a fantasy, and a really bad one at that.

Hitler wearing a cape?  Raging at a lowly foot soldier?  Like some sort of an evil crusader comic book villain.  So not historically correct either.

And those long-winded trademarked Tarantino monologues - whenever one of them was firing off, it reminded me of that line from the movie ""The Incredibles"":  HE'S MONOLOGUING AGAIN!  YADA YADA...  Nobody talks like that in real life.

Are we, the non-Jewish audience of the world, supposed to be impressed that Jewish American soldiers were able to get their revenge for Hitler's Final Solution against these evil German soldiers?  Well, unfortunately, as the movie itself makes clear, the German soldiers who took the brunt of the brutality of Brad Pitt's troops had nothing to do with the Final Solution or the concentration camps.  They were just soldiers.

And the truth was that the U.S. of World War II did nothing to help the Jews of Europe - the U.S. was entirely dumb and deaf on the issue of the extermination of Jews in Europe until the concentration camps were physically liberated.  Efforts to help European Jews immigrate to the U.S. were resisted.

So now that AIPAC rules the halls of Congress and mauls any American politician who dares criticize Israel, and now that Israel has the atomic bomb, is it Hollywood's intention to re-write history and depict the Jews of WWII in a more manly and heroic fashion with this revenge fantasy of a movie about a team of Jewish soldiers scalping and smashing in the skulls of German soldiers during WWII?

How totally unheroic and unmanly...  This movie is just war porn, pure and simple.",1252800000,114,2994,4.641366223908919
3955239,5,B002MZZMRM,"(SPOILERS AHEAD - but only based on my interpretation.)

Quentin Tarentino has constructed a terrific movie based on a well-known and often-used sci-fi device - an alternate reality. Anyone who's read Ray Bradbury or Stephen Baxter, or watched Star Trek (Spock with a beard, for god's sake) knows there are slight differences between ""our"" reality and an alternate reality, such as (wink, wink) misspelled words.

When did our reality change lanes? When Landa impulsively decides NOT to kill Shoshanna! He was a brutal son-of-a-bitch, so why the millisecond of compassion? Don't know, but it shifts reality onto another path.

In ""our"" reality, the BastArds plot to blow up a theater with Hitler and his top brass inside MAY have been successful, but some might have escaped. Now with Shoshanna's plan and the BastErd's plan coming together, and the theater doors locked, the plan is a success - everyone dies. And Shoshanna, who should not have been alive in the first place, also perishes in the theater.

After seeing the movie, I thought to myself - leave it to Tarantino to simply re-write history. And then it hit me - it wasn't re-written, it was simply an alternate reality. If none of this makes sense read the sci-fi classic short story, ""A Sound Of Thunder"", by Ray Bradbury - short, simple, and mind-blowing.",1252713600,,1320,4.9324324324324325
3955240,4,B002MZZMRM,"I am a huge Quentin Tarantino fan. Naturally when Inglourious Basterds came out I was at the theater opening weekend. This is his newest movie. Written and directed by one of the greatest directors of our time, this movie is phenomenal.

We start off in Nazi occupied France and follow the story of two people with one goal. Shosanna Dreyfus, played by Mlanie Laurent, is a crazy young Jewish girl who escapes the massacre of her family and finds refuge with her alleged aunt and uncle. Lt. Aldo ""the Apache"" Raine, Brad Pitt is the southern born leader of the Basterds, a group of American and French soldiers who cruelly slaughter Nazis as a hobby.

The plots are intermingled as both Shosanna and the Apache, ignorant of the other, plan and attempt an assassination on not only Hitler, but also most of his regime during a movie premiere.

The acting in the film is superb. Pitt is as hilarious as ever, and with his southern accent you'll be cracking up every time he opens his mouth. I was wary of Tarantino's choice to cast friend and co-director Eli Roth as Sgt. Donny ""the Bear Jew"" Donowitz, a presumably mad Nazi murderer, however the pick was spot on. The part couldn't have been played by anyone else. Some of the lines were delivered with a little less skill, Marcel, Dreyfus' African-French lover, but overall the acting was great.

As always Tarantino is a master with the camera. He is an artist and the camera is his brush. Throughout the entire movie I was amazed at his perfectly set up scenes. He drives just near enough the conventional to have the audience fall asleep before flipping it on its head to remind them they're watching Tarantino. He breaks every cinematographic rule, but always with a carefully planned reason.

The plot, while a little unorthodox, (what would you expect?) is very easy to follow and quite fun. This movie is a Western at heart, and it's really fun to see how Tarantino changes this genre. I really sympathized with some of the characters, and others, while not quite deserving of my sympathy, were definitely fun to watch on screen.

If you can't handle watching blood on screen this is a movie to stay away from. There are things shown I never thought I'd witness in my life. Many Nazis are scalped, (at the request of the Apache) and some fall to an even more brutal fate. Violence might be a theme in this film, and more is witnessed on screen than off.

If violence is a theme, then suspense is her twin. More time is given the audience to imagine the ensuing bloodbath, than time to actually witness the bath itself. Like with any good narrative, you'll be on the edge of your seat and you won't even notice the nearly two and a half hours that pass.

This film is not for everyone. Squeamish people, nursing mothers, and the elderly would do best to avoid it. Other than that, if you like action, suspense, and people getting cruelly dismembered, this is a must see.",1252713600,,2926,4.591954022988506
3955241,3,B002MZZMRM,"Look, by now nobody needs one more plot synopsis of INGLOURIOUS - you all know the drill. Ditto on Christoph Waltz, who's very good (though I have a sneaking suspicion the level of hosannas he's receiving from critics are due to their never having heard of the guy before). For Tarantino and the Weinsteins, this represents a desperately-needed critical/b.o. rebound from the debacle that was DEATH PROOF, which is why it got a late-August release after all the other big summer movies have already come & gone. Add in the now-obligatory Tarantino-fanboy choir drowning out the relatively few naysayers and the result is QT's biggest-ever hit. But will you respect INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS in the morning?

Pros? Well, let's start with ""hurray for Steadicam!"" Finally, a movie that doesn't require taking two Dramamine in the lobby beforehand - hallelujah. Next, I'm happy to report that Waltz isn't the only heretofore-unknown (to Yanks, at least) European find the movie offers: Daniel Bruhl, Melanie Laurent, Michael Fassbender and Denis Menochet all turn in first-rate work. Fassbender's entire performance is a film-geek inside joke (he's Trevor Howard in THE THIRD MAN brought out of retirement, kinda), but it's a satisfying inside joke; Laurent and Bruhl provide the film with both heart and moral complexity; and Menochet - who resembles a younger, handsomer Jean Reno - is the unheralded component in that celebrated first scene, whose superb straight-man work sets up/off Waltz beautifully. The Bowie song works exactly as Tarantino intended it to (though he needs to lay off the Morricone swipes for a while - once is an homage; twice, a ripoff). The pacing, which has drawn criticism, is leisurely throughout, but that's okay: Tarantino is a storyteller who's as much about the asides as the plot - probably more so. He takes his time, sure, but we want him to linger in this world. (If your beef with IB is the glacial rhythm of the setpieces, wait a few weeks/months and watch it again - you'll probably discover you've changed your mind about the 'pacing' issue.) As for his long suit - the dialogue - he's mostly on form. And at least for once we get to listen to 40s hipsters, instead of the more tiresome contemporary kind (and I do mean tiresome: David Carradine's KILL BILL 2 monologue pretty much took the air out of that movie's tires, while DEATH PROOF clattered along, riding on its rims, interminably.)

Now for the cons. The marketing campaign for the film is just that, a con, and a huge one, right down to the ""kosher porn"" and ""as a Jew, I thank you"" quotes attached to the production; primarily designed to separate suckers from their scratch. (Somehow, I doubt Lawrence Bender and Harvey Weinstein would be very enthusiastic at the number of likable and even heroic Nazis in the movie had IB tanked that all-important First Weekend of Release.) This might be the first commando picture with hardly any commandoes in it! Secondly, there are so many logical and historical gaffes in the film they turn, inevitably, into potholes - you're willing to endure the first few w/o complaint, growing more and more ticked off as they just keep coming. (And please, no cries of ""duh! - it's a MOVIE, Einstein!"" We're not talking about a few holes here, but a block of Swiss cheese.) Third, the casting of Hitler and Goebbels is disastrous - a little levity is one thing, but this is CARRY ON FUEHRER!

And last (though hardly least) is the most troubling of all: at some deeper level, Tarantino movies are always about the cruelly kinetic joy of sadism and murder....and IB proudly continues this odious 'tradition'. The 'feminist' - and now, 'anti-fascist' - subtext of his films are just cynical window dressing, there to provide convenient but utterly bogus moral cover for the atrocities that make QT's wee-wee twitch to attention. Which isn't to say they're not effective: the image of Laurent's face superimposed on smoke in the film's gotterdammerung finale is real nightmare material, with a phantasmagoric eerieness that's hard to shake. But the crux of this sequence is watching screaming people trapped by design in a fiery inferno, and it's presented as popcorn-munching entertainment for the masses (we're meant to applaud in delight); given the hideous parallels to everything from the Triangle Factory to the Station nightclub (and to the poor souls who tossed themselves from the top of the WTC on 9/11 rather than burn to cinders), it's an evil scene. Depicting such a horror is one thing - CELEBRATING it as catharsis is something else entirely...... entirely too much, in my view. (The legion of Tarantino fanboys will no doubt insist that it's meant not to feed an audience's bloodlust, but instead to provoke thought and discussion. Well in that case, I'll be waiting for the Museum of Modern Art to book a HOSTEL II/MAN BEHIND THE SUN double-feature any day now.)

So there you have it. A well-made, fairly riveting Tootsie Pop, with a cancerous center lying in wait under the candy coating. I liked it for what it did well, though obviously with some deep misgivings; your own mileage may vary.",1252368000,9,5134,4.918108419838523
3955242,5,B002MZZMRM,"Finally saw ""Basterds"" and I thoroughly enjoyed it! It was a suspenseful, funny, exciting WWII flick about assassinating Hitler.  I was surprised by how well the story was told in a logical linear way, especially for Tarantino.  Also, it wasn't THAT violent- meaning that for a revenge war film by Tarantino, it was just about right, especially since there was so much engaging dialogue & enthralling exposition that set the stage for the BIG VIOLENT PAY-OFF, that you just know is coming and that viewers of the film really want.  At least the packed theater where I was seemed satisfied, there was cheering and even clapping.  Some critics kvetched about the film's length, but it didn't seem long to me at all. In fact, I could have watched some more.  There were so many colorful characters in that film, if anything, Tarantino could have edited some but then again- the audience would not have met so many interesting characters.  It's a minor fault that didn't hurt the film for me.  Many of the actors gave emotional intense performances.  Very Good movie.

Bottom Line: I'm in my 40s and I've seen tons of flicks & documentaries about WWII and this is the 1st flick in a long time to make me wince and smile and gringe and cheer about the last Good War.",1252281600,,1261,4.6441441441441444

3955244,3,B002MZZMRM,"I am not a Tarantino Fan and generally think his films make little sense and this was no exception.  Why I let myself get dragged to this was only due to the rave reviews offered by my nephew. I thought Brad Pitt does his best with a part he is ill suited to play but since this is a fantasy his awkward performance underscores the unreality of the entire piece.  The screen play does not develop any characters beyond paper cutouts.  The entire band of Jewish soldiers are never developed as characters and hardly have names.  What their purpose or objective is, is never made clear and the scalping scenes were typical Tarantino shock scenes that had no purpose other than to offer up gore.  This film dragged on and on with the camera lingering on some of the most violent scenes, like the killing of the German Sergeant.  In fact this entire movie portrayed the American Soldiers in the worst light possible -- soldiers who were brutal, violent, and without a shred of honor.  The German soldiers came across as professional soldiers doing their duty while the Americans were little more than a roving band of murderers.  Of course there was nothing even remotely close to historical reality in this film.  It is so far from reality it might have been directed by Oliver Stone, but if you like Tarantino and his violence you'll like this movie.

I gave this movie three stars because of the performance of Christoph Waltz.  His performance as the German SS Colonel was mesmerizing.  He turned in a brilliant performance speaking German, English, Italian, and French with ease.  In fact he carries the entire movie and without him this movie would have just been overly long, overly violent, and idiotic, but his performance raises the entire cast and screen play to a movie worth seeing.  Of course the ending is ridiculous but then there was nothing real about this movie from the outset.  Christopher Waltz was brilliant and deserves an academy award -- he makes the entire movie worth the price of admission.",1252281600,9,2015,4.73352435530086

3955248,4,B002MZZMRM,"Quentin Tarantino is back with his much-anticipated World War II epic ""Inglourious Basterds"".

When I first heard about the project, I imagined Tarantino would make a more serious film about the war with his trademark attention to detail and signature over-the-top violence. As I heard more and more about the project, I was surprised to learn it would be much more tongue in cheek. After watching the film, I was surprised to realize the director sticks pretty closely to the influences that have shaped all of his previous films.

The film opens in the early 40s at a farmhouse in the Nazi-Occupied French countryside. A Nazi officer, Colonel Landa (Christoph Waltz) interrogates a dairy farmer, looking for a Jewish family that has gone missing. Eventually, the Colonel figures things out and orders his men to kill everyone but the oldest daughter, Shoshana escapes. Four years later, Shoshana (Melanie Laurent) is living undercover in Paris and manages a movie theater. A young German soldier, Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) finds himself the poster child of Nazi Germany and is excited to be the center of attention; he fought off an entire platoon of soldiers, shooting from a bell tower, picking them off one by one. Goebbels (Sylvester Groth) has made a film about the hero and wants to hold a huge premiere in Paris, for all of the Nazi elite to revel in. He might even be able to get Hitler to attend. Zoller meets Shoshanna and becomes infatuated with her and tries to pull some strings to get the premiere held at her theater. Shoshanna goes along with the plan, but is shocked to learn Colonel Landa is the head of security for the premiere. Thankfully, he doesn't seem to recognize her and instead seems to be attracted to her. In the meantime, Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) forms an elite squadron of Jewish American soldiers who infiltrate the enemy lines for one reason and one reason only; to hunt some Nazis. He and his men are in the Nazi hunting business and ""cousin, business is a booming"". Eventually, the two stories intersect and Raines and his men begin to work with Shoshanna to attempt a very daring assassination attempt.

Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a rollicking roller coaster of a film filled with Tarantino's signature style; the characters frequently have lengthy conversations filled with expertly written dialogue making the scenes both interesting and fun to watch, there are many moments of tribute to the many genres Tarantino grew up with and fell in love with, there is a lot of very graphic violence and some truly hilarious, over the top moments are sprinkled throughout. But ""Basterds"" is not a great film. Very good, yes. Great, no.

Tarantino often talks about the various films he grew up watching and these films have colored his own projects throughout his career. I think if you gathered a group of 100 people in a room and had them watch many of these films, the majority of the group would walk away before any of the films was done. But Tarantino loves them, idolizes them and is greatly influenced by them. What has always fascinated me about Tarantino is that while he pays homage to these less than spectacular examples of filmmaking, he also elevates this source material. Tarantino takes the ideas but applies his vastly superior writing and cinematography, usually creating a project most people would label as something great, something special. In short, he makes excellent films based on material that most would consider D-Grade.

Sure, he has had a couple of missteps, but even these films are fun to watch and a lot better than most of the other movies we are able to see.

But when he hits it out of the park, he gets a homerun. Some of my personal favorites ""Jackie Brown"", ""Kill Bill V.1"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" are examples of great writing and directing, but also such purely satisfying cinema experiences, you can't do anything but walk out of the theater giddy with excitement, eager to talk about everyone and everything involved in the film.

When he doesn't hit it out of the park (""Kill Bill V.2"", ""Death Proof"") there are still moments of pure brilliance to be witnessed. I think the reason I don't find these films so brilliant is because Tarantino seems to be a little too fascinated by his own dialogue at times. It seems to be a little too clever, a little too obtuse and this simply creates films that seem long.

""Basterds"" is mostly great, but it does fall victim to Tarantino's infatuation with his own dialogue. And this ultimately makes the film seem too long and dilutes the power of all of the great things going on.

In an interview with Charlie Rose, Tarantino stated that one of the conversations in this film runs twenty-two minutes. This is an eternity in a film and needs to be the stuff of legend to make us feel like it is but a second. I'm not sure which scene this is, but there are a few that could qualify. The film opens with a lengthy conversation between Landa and the dairy farmer. As Landa arrives at the dairy farmer's house, he seems to be completely at odds and not at all what we might expect a Nazi officer to act like. But as he quietly questions the farmer, very pleasant in tone, you begin to sense there is an undercurrent of dread. You see it in the farmer's face and actions. You sense it in Landa's every pore. And sure enough, the scene has a terrifying climax.

Throughout the film, there are moments like this, in which various characters engage in lengthy conversation, but none really reach the impact of the first scene. I think this is due to a few different factors. First, the film opens with this scene, so it helps to establish much of the rest of the film. And as we watch, there is still a sense of discovery because we don't really know what is going to happen.

Brad Pitt is great as Aldo Raine, the Lieutenant from the rural backwoods who leads a group of men through France for some ""Nahzee huntin'"". When we first meet Raine, he has gathered his men and lays out their mission for him. He wants them each to collect 100 Nazi scalps. And he isn't referring to a rhetorical scalp either. Pitt plays the character with relish, allowing us to delight in the character's backwoods ways and origin. This is a man who knows what the Nahzee's are doing and he wants to help put a stop to it.

His elite group is filled with a group of familiar actors, all of who get a bit lost, but seem to be having fun. B.J. Novak (TV's ""The Office) and Eli Roth (director of ""Hostel"") are the most well known of the group. Soon, the group is running through France, cornering as many German soldiers as possible and interrogating them before dispatching them. Their interrogation is for one reason and one reason only, to find more soldiers and to collect more scalps.

Eventually, they connect with Shoshana and realize the benefits of working with her. It's a crazy plan, but they are dealing with crazy people. And they are a little off their rockers as well. It's a good match.

One of the many things I love about Tarantino's films is to watch and delight in the rediscovery of a long lost actor or the rejuvenation of an actor's career. Tarantino has always mixed the hot with the curious helping to resurrect the careers of many. In ""Inglourious Basterds"" he does less of this. Rod Taylor, a popular actor from the 60s is listed in the credits and I became excited about seeing him again, but his role is really small and I didn't even recognize him when he was on screen. Mike Meyers (yes, ""Austin Powers"") shows up as a British Colonel who learns of Raine's campaign in France. But that's about it. The rest of the recognizable names are recognizable because they have been in Tarantino's previous films. This isn't a bad thing, but I was hoping for a rediscovery along the lines of Pam Grier or Robert Forster.

""Basterds"" is filled with a lot of great Tarantino-esque stuff and only a little bit of Tarantino excess creating a highly enjoyable, over the top film experience.",1251936000,,8036,4.657263751763047

An interesting review: ""An Eye for An Eye Makes Us All Blind""

[...]

The Author of this article fails to take the director's humor or the general tenor of his filmographic work as a whole to correctly gauge Inglourious Basterds for what it is:  a demonstration of the Ghandian-pacifist principle taken in his title, and not a creative work fashioned with that vice subconsciously fashioning it.

The ""Jew Hunter"" ironically is a cosmopolitan socialite polyglot with a Sir Arthur Conan Doyle proportioned smoking pipe and the Macchiavelian instinct for psychological leverage and gain seeking in all cases.

[Jew in 3rd Reich terms.]

The ""Bear Jew"" and his comrades are meat headed cretins, snuff taking backwater hillbillies and gangsters, including a mental case multiple murderer.

[In Third Reich Terms, each instruments of Kultur Terror meted by America: gangster, philistine, psychopath.]

Winston Churchill in the briefing scene featuring 'Austin Powers' on the question of Goebbel's quest to revitalize German Cinema, --""Is he winning?""

[Subtext: against the Jews?]

The German in the film is indeed very good.  The cultural references are not so difficult though:  Riefenstahl, the Napoleonic Hitler portrait, linguistic niceties. A few top German actors are in the film, if you've viewed Stalingrad, The Lives of Others or Downfall, you may recognize them.

Tarantino is no 'post-modernist', with regard to film, he is classicist insofar as that is possible in that field of creative endeavor, even slavishly so--  his encyclopedic knowledge of film is renowned for a reason. The roles are interestingly reversed, and the German who said, ""For Bravery"" and ""F__K You"" with such dignity should make it clear that Tarantino has made the ultimate spoof of a hidden genre:  Nazisploitation films.

The above article's intent is misplaced and so was the German Culture Ministry's.  The fantasy is not Germany's, but America's --and it has *everything* to do with the silver screen as the centerpiece of New World 'civilization'.",1251849600,2,2351,5.317073170731708
3955250,4,B002MZZMRM,"Written and directed by Quentin Tarrantino, ""Inglorious Basterds"" is a fictitious, visceral story of WW II in which a small group of American Jewish commandos led by Lieutenant Aldo Raine played by  Brad Pitt turn the tables on Hitler and his Nazis. The movie is set in Paris during the German occupation.  Besides Pitt, the major character is the Nazi ""Jew Hunter"" Hans Landa played by Austrian actor Christoph Waltz.  Landa is suave, intelligent, shrewd, and deadly. Waltz does an extraordinary job of acting in portraying this difficult character.

The movie movies swiftly and held my attention throughout its 150 minutes. The movie is violent and crude with many scenes of beatings, cuttings, and killings.  It captures the brutality of the war.  In the movie, while not in fact, the Nazis get a deserved and swift comeuppance. It is a movie of vengeance.

I was engaged with this movie but found it valuable to step back and remember that it is a work of fiction. Some intelligent criticism has suggested that in this film that roles of the Nazis and the Jews has, if not been reversed, at least been somewhat equated. As in some other WW II movies, German top leadership is portrayed as consisting of buffoons. Tragically, WW II did not happen like this.

The movie was absorbing, dark, and wrenching but not especially probing.  While the movie is entertaining and sharp on its own terms,  it has little to contribute in helping to understand the horrors of WW II.

There were a few funny parts and a couple of action scenes, but the rest was just dull conversations in another language. You practically read the whole movie. There was 95% talking, and 5% action! The film is told in 5 chapters, and the only two chapters I kinda liked were Chapter Two & Five. Brad Pitt plays Lieutenant Aldo Raine who is the leader of a group called The Basterds. They kill Nazis, and plan to kill all the Nazis and Adolf Hitler at a theatre during a Nazi fest. A few weeks ago, I rented the original Inglorious Bastards movie to get ready for this one, but that was a waste of time, because this has nothing to do with the 1970's version. I definitely would not recommend INGLORIOUS BASTERDS!!!",1251763200,5,834,4.387096774193548
3955252,3,B002MZZMRM,"Inglourious Basterds is Quentin Tarrantino's homage to the entertaining World War II action films of the 60s and 70s. Of all such films, 'Basterds' mostly resembles the highly entertaining ""The Dirty Dozen"". In 'Chapter 1' (unquestionably the best scene in the movie), Tarrantino raises his 'Dirty Dozen' to a higher plane. In his World War II epic, the Nazis' hatred of the Jews is not ignored (unlike these earlier action films). At the outset, Tarrantino's SS man, Landa, is wholly believable as the charming sadist who ends up murdering a Jewish family hidden under the floorboards of a French dairy farmer's home. Like many of the scenes in the film, the opening scene is dialogue heavy but the tension is so palpable that one sits engrossed until the scene's brutal and harrowing outcome.

The reason why 'The Dirty Dozen' was so entertaining was that each convict 'misfit' had a distinct and extremely interesting personality. Tarrantino doesn't bother to develop any of his basterds as fleshed out people. Instead, all they can do is scalp Nazis or as one of them does (the so-called 'Bear Jew') beats Nazi brains out with a baseball bat. What's more, Tarrantino doesn't bother showing how they develop as a team and how they overcome obstacles leading to their reputation as professional killers. Instead, they're plopped down in occupied France and meet no real resistance. The whole charm of 'The Dirty Dozen' was that that they had to overcome not only the external obstacles of fighting the Nazis but deal with their own internal strife. In short, they were fairly plausible, believable characters. Not so with Tarrantino's group who are not only unbelievable but unsympathetic (they're as sadistic as their Nazi opponents).

The problem with Tarrantino's narrative is that it gradually becomes more and more implausible and incoherent. I was willing to suspend my disbelief when Shoshanna, the Jewish girl, escapes while Landa murders her family (did his gun jam?) but how does she become the owner of a movie theater a few years later? Wouldn't the Nazis have uncovered her Jewish heritage? Tarrantino's portrait of Goebbals as a dilettante in the world of German cinema rang true but I question the assertion that he was the #2 man (next to Hitler) in the Nazi hierarchy (certainly Bormann, Heydrich and Goring had a lot more power).

Visually, it was a nice touch in showing Hitler with an unflattering complexion as well as making fun of his out of control temper; but to reduce Hitler to a complete buffoon while other Nazi characters are quite believably scary, makes no sense whatsoever. Hitler, after all, was the brains behind the operation.

Tarrantino does serve up some juicy characters which were highly entertaining. I liked Pvt. Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) as he first appears to be a harmless, lovesick puppy dog, enamored with our Jewish cinema owner and actually exudes modesty despite having become a war hero and accidental movie star. And it makes perfect sense for him to morph into a sadistic stalker on the verge of rape when he shows his 'true colors' after confronting Shoshanna in the projection booth. In some ways, Zoller is more sinister than Landa.

Kudos also to Diane Kruger as Bridget Hammersmark, the movie actress who's also a double agent. Despite its unpleasantness, the scene of Kruger's demise at the hands of the sadistic Landa pulls you in. Perhaps the best character in the movie is Major Dieter Hellstrom, played by the brilliant August Diehl, who ends up exposing Michael Fassbender's film critic turned spy in the basement tavern face-off. The way Tarrantino has the diabolical Major deduce it's 'King Kong' during the card game is utterly brilliant. Through Hellstrom's 'deduction', Tarrantino demonstrates that he has a profound understanding of the sinister nature of Nazi politics and ideology.

Tarrantino, however, shoots himself in the foot in the final third of the movie. The Basterds are supposed to be a crackerjack professional outfit but allow themselves to be easily apprehended at the film premiere because no one speaks any languages except English. And despite Hitler showing up at the premiere, there's absolutely no security (Shoshanna's black lover who plans to set fire to the building has free rein to walk around without being stopped once). In Tarrantino's warped universe, he somehow feels some kind of perverse satisfaction in having Shoshanna laugh at the Nazis as they are being burned to a crisp in an on screen rant.

Finally, what really killed the film for me was the denouement where the sinister and charming Landa suddenly becomes a blithering idiot by offering to surrender to the Allies after allowing the Basterds' bomb plot to proceed. How could the ""Hangman"" of Occupied France suddenly deceive himself into believing that Lt. Aldo Raine, the notorious Nazi killer, would agree to his ludicrous demands and then keep his word?

Inglorious Basterds contains a plethora of clever references to the history of cinema. Many of the scenes are overlong and talky but the dialogue is always crisp and never boring. Tarrantino's characters are a mixed bag--he's much more successful with his Nazi antagonists than his American protagonists. Particularly disappointing is Brad Pitt who has little to do except practice a Southern accent. With the exception of Hitler and SS Landa's final scenes, Tarrantino does a credible job of humanizing his Nazis. That doesn't mean he approves of them but it shows he knows what makes them tick.

Tarrantino should have consulted with Daniel Mendelsohn before making his mad revenge fantasy. Mendelsohn, writing in Newsweek, gets it right: ""An alternative, and morally superior, form of ""revenge"" for Jews would be to do precisely what Jews have been doing since World War II ended: that is, to preserve and perpetuate the memory of the destruction that was visited upon them, precisely in order to help prevent the recurrence of such mass horrors in the future.""",1251676800,3,5995,5.078172588832487
3955253,3,B002MZZMRM,"Whenever a movie takes historical liberties, you expect a good dose of comedic scenes.  Don't get me wrong, the dialogue is quite funny in some spots and there are plenty of black comedy moments in here.  It's just that the opening scene is pretty intense, and in the subsequent scenes between the Inglorious Basterds and the other characters it throws the tone completely off when juxtaposing the Basterds with other scenes.  Having said that though, I think Brad Pitt did a great job in this movie, and was really quite hilarious.  Overall, I found the movie enjoyable.",1251676800,2,571,4.855670103092783

3955255,5,B002MZZMRM,"After 25 years, Quentin Tarantino is still cranking out violent, caustic, talky movies for himself. Til now. Now he's making movies for us. For you. Now he's made a classic. Once upon a time, in Nazi-occupied France, during World War II, a group of Jewish-American soldiers known as ""The Basterds"" are chosen specifically to spread terror throughout the Third Reich by scalping and brutally killing German Nazis. The Basterds eventually cross paths with a pretty French-Jewish teenage girl whose family was brutally murdered by Col. Hans Landa. She now owns a movie theater in Paris which the Basterds have targeted for attack. Pre-1950 nitrate film is highly flamable and can easily start a fire. They all have a plan. Blow up the theater during a Nazi propaganda film-screening; killing Goebbels, German film star Emil Jannings, and even a flinty-nosed hard-tack named Hitler. But will it work? In ""Inglorious Basterds"" Tarantino is equipted with all his usual apparatus: a flying, burning cigarette in slow-motion, homage to Hollywood B-Pictures of the 1940's, women's foot fetishes(see Erich von Stroheim), two-and-three character extended dialogue sequences, cameo parts for former Hollywood stars, and brutal, gruesome violence. But here, for the first time, Tarantino's bag of tricks has purpose: a serio-comic surreal war-drama that is no war movie. In ""Ingl. B"", the horrors of the German Holocaust have become contagious; American Allied troups inflict cruelties on German soldiers; bestial atrocities that mirror their Nazi counterparts. Brad Pitt stars as Lt. Aldo Raine, a sadistic murderer who smiles while his soldiers scalp German soldiers. Christoph Waltz is amazing and sublime as the precise, ruthless, decadent German Nazi Colonel Hans Landa. We perhaps have not seen a more tortuous, calculated villian. And Melanie Laurent as Shosanna Dreyfus is delicate as fine porcelain; hardy as cold steel; a French-Jewish Freedom-Fighter whose mission is soon revealed. Laurent is electrifying, trembling, and mostly vulnerable. A few cameo parts are reserved for former movie greats. Film comedian Mike
Myers has 45-seconds as an English officer, and once-famous Rod Taylor is seen briefly as Winston Churchill. Film buff Tarantino loads ""Basterds"" with his most cinema-history-laden screenplay ever. We watch 35mm film projectors being mounted and operated. Shosanna's movie theater marquee advertises European film comedian Max Linder. The German soldiers chant for Charlie Chaplin, who directed the famous chase at the end of ""The Kid"". Other film references include German actors Pola Negri, Emil Jannings, and director G.W. Pabst. ""Basterds"" was filmed on location in Babelsberg, Potsdam, and Brandenburg, Germany. Last June, I journeyed to Hollywood, and one hot Saturday, I stumbled into the old Musso and Frank's on Hollywood Blvd.. Sitting at the counter, the woman next to me mumbled: ""They told me in there is the man who directed something called ""Pulp"" something..."" Turing the corner, I entered the writer's back room. Lunching with his buddies, there sat the tall Quentin Tarantino himself. He was describing to his friends the theme of a George Sanders World War II movie from 1940. Fortified with a glass of merlot, I approached his table. Quentin was cordial and friendly. I told him I liked his controversial ""Death-Proof"". We shared a joke and I left. He back to his friends. I back to my Merlot. I could not have known. He could not have guessed. In just two months his new movie would reign supreme as box-office No. 1. In the very last scene of ""Inglourious Basterds"", Brad Pitt's Lt. Raine commits one more atrocious, fiendish act. He stops. He lears. He looks straight down into the camera, and says: ""Well, yeah, I don't know, but this just might be my masterpiece.""",1251504000,3,3804,5.278877887788779

3955257,3,B002MZZMRM,"""Inglourious Basterds"" wants to be World War Two on steroids. It wants to be bigger, stranger, bloodier, meaner, funnier, more stylish than WW II ever was. Here's the problem: World War Two WAS on steroids. It WAS bigger, stranger, bloodier, meaner, funnier, and more stylish than anything a sheltered film geek like Quentin Tarantino could dream up. Tarantino didn't have to invent a group of Jews who fight Nazis; there were such Jews, including the Warsaw Ghetto fighters, who staged the first urban uprising in occupied Europe, The Bielski Partisans, who fought in the forest, and the Treblinka and Sobibor Uprisings in death camps. Nothing Tarantino could invent could be stranger than the life of Oswald Rufeisen, a Jew who survived by posing as an SS man; his memoir, ""In the Lion's Den,"" is far freakier and gasp-inducing than anything in Tarantino's film. No filmmaker will ever make a more over-the-top or diabolically stylish production than Leni Riefenstahl's 1935 documentary of the Nuremburg Nazi Party Congress, ""Triumph of the Will.""

Tarantino has a reputation for stylish violence; the violent scenes in ""Inglourious Basterds"" are not as violent nor as innovative in their use of violence as those in ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""The Passion of the Christ."" Tarantino also has a reputation for witty, stylish dialogue. Again, the real World War Two produced plenty of unforgettable lines: ""Peace in our time,"" ""Who remembers the Armenians?"" ""I shall return,"" ""Nuts.""

Tarantino's most daring ambition is to provide a more ignominious end for Hitler than Hitler's real demise. Sorry, can't be done. Hitler died a betrayed, solitary loser, knowing full well that everything he had strived for was lost. A far better movie, ""Downfall,"" depicts Hitler's nightmarish real life descent into Hell; Magda and Joseph Goebbels' historically accurate deaths in ""Downfall,"" preceded by their murder of their own children, are as creepy as it gets. Tarantino can't top history.

""Inglourious Basterds"" consists, for the most part, of a series of relatively disconnected dialogue scenes; the sensationally violent scenes are few and far between. Dialogue goes on and on and on. Yes, there are some gems, and some tension is created, but the simple fact is that Tarantino needs an editor. I never thought I'd be so bored in a lurid, violent movie about Jews wrecking revenge on Nazis. There are three different scenes of Nazis and resistance members who are hiding something sitting around tables, consuming food and drinks, and hoping that the Nazis don't discover their secrets. The first time Tarantino does this it is very powerful. The third time it just drags, and you think, ""Come on. Don't you have anything else to say?""

Suspension of disbelief and conventional narrative structure work magic on the brain, inviting identification. Tarantino does everything he can to push his viewers away from involvement in this film and to remind viewers that he, Quentin Tarantino, quirky film genius, is the real star. The Basterds of the title are minor characters; the plot hops from place to place, character to character. When top Nazis appear onscreen, a hand scrawled note appears on the film, with an arrow and the Nazi's name. Some scenes, like the opening involving a Nazi interrogation of a French peasant, are played as if real, and other scenes are obviously played with lots of winking and nudging at the audience. Musical styles shift throughout the movie. ""This is really a salute to Spaghetti Westerns!"" some of the music shrieks. Experimentation is welcome, but all this ""Hey, don't forget, Quentin Tarantino is behind the camera; I'm famous for quirky films"" winking and nudging broke my involvement with the film and made it a real slog for me. I didn't care about what I was looking at, and I got bored.

""Inglourious Basterds""' opening scene is flawless. Nazis arrive at an isolated French farmhouse. A girl is hanging sheets on a line. Given Tarantino's penchant for saluting past films, I immediately thought of Andrzej Wajda's ""Ashes and Diamonds,"" and was ready to see a character bleed to death all over those clean sheets. Not so. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), a Nazi ""Jew Hunter,"" is there to interrogate the farmer (Denis Menochet). Menochet is brilliant in this scene, a study in stoic, peasant masculinity. Waltz waltzes into movie history. His fastidious, precious, melodramatic performance as a perfectly evil Nazi enters cinematic history. His life will never be the same.

The rapturous embrace of ""Inglourious Basterds"" by critics and film fans is kind of depressing. It's sad to think that there are young people who will think that this is what World War Two either was like or should have been like, and it's sad to think that they are so divorced from history that they don't get how wrong both assumptions are. Years from now scholars will study kids who think that no Jews fought back till Tarantino invented them.",1251417600,4,4955,5.0661764705882355
3955258,5,B002MZZMRM,"THE MOVIE

Quentin Tarantino is, without question, my favorite director of all time. Aside from being a total movie geek, what I love about him is his intense passion to make great films no matter how long it takes. He's a perfectionist. Each one of his films are full-blown experiences. It's incredible to consider that his worst movies are probably&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reservoir-Dogs/dp/B000KX0ISG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reservoir Dogs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Proof/dp/B001F0TM5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Proof</a>, even though they're almost instant genre classics. He spent over a decade writing Inglourious Basterds and I've been waiting for it ever since I saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill/dp/B001BR5F4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill</a>&nbsp;(Vol. 2). As you can imagine, my hopes were high and I had a lot of expectations walking into the theater (which I barely made it into since Cinebarre doesn't understand what it means when you buy tickets in advance), but I'm glad that I didn't seek out leaked information or read the script before watching the movie. In fact, you should try to shield yourself from spoilers as much as possible, as well.

So how did it stack up? It's almost certainly the best movie to come out so far this year. On one hand, it wasn't quite what I expected at all from the trailer and hearing comparisons to The Dirty Dozen. Part of the confusion comes from the fact that he wrote enough scripts to create 3 films, but it's not a World War II movie, an action film, or a dirty dozen homage. It's actually a very dialogue-heavy, cerebral spaghetti western that takes place during World War II and happens to have some very trademark Tarantino action scenes. All I can really tell you about the plot is that it's about a group of Jewish-American soldiers deep behind enemy lines in Nazi Germany who have a goal of killing as many Nazis as possible and giving the Nazis something to be afraid of.

What I find really striking about this film, compared to all his movies since Reservoir Dogs, is that it's really slow-paced and yet it flies by. My friends were shocked when we walked out of the theaters more than 2 and half hours after the show started (including trailers). It's a movie characterized by a few long scenes focusing on very important dialogue. There are some random flashback sequences and moments of brutal violence, but there really aren't a lot of scene changes when you add it all up. As I was watching the movie, I was trying to remain skeptical and didn't feel that the dialogue was as quotable as it was in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pulp-Fiction/dp/B00006BSBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pulp Fiction</a>&nbsp;(which I hold is his masterpiece, even though I like Kill Bill the most), but I was wrong. There were a number of lines that stuck with me (some of which are in the trailers) that I say to myself every so often now. Each word almost feels like it's carefully crafted. My only criticism is that I felt on at least one occasion that the switch from using a foreign language to using English was a bit contrived, much like it was in Oren Ishi-i's speech to the Council. It's hard to complain though because I still loved those scenes in spit of that.

Another striking quality, although this isn't really a huge surprise coming from Tarantino, is his attention to detail. This movie just bleeds details that you can't begin to appreciate on your first viewing. I really hope his costume designer is at least nominated for an academy award because they did a wonderful job of totally nailing the atmosphere and the time period. The sets were well put-together, as well. It's so perfect that I was a little sad to learn that German viewers had to watch a version with some Nazi iconography redacted due to federal law.

I don't think I have enough words to praise the acting in this film. I think sometimes Brad Pitt is underrated because he's such a mainstream actor, but this may be his best role yet. No one could've been a better Aldo Raine than him. What's crazy is that he's not actually the star of the show - Christoph Waltz is as Hans Landa. He definitely needs an Academy Award for the tension that he sends down the spines of the audience. I didn't know who Cristoph Waltz was before seeing this movie, but I don't think I'll ever forget him as Landa whenever I see him in the future. I also have to give props to Mlanie Laurent as Shoshanna. Her emotions jumped off the screen and it was a really memorable performance. No one did badly, to be honest. The casting was perfect (as usual, for Tarantino), to put it simply.

One more thing to note is that this movie had scenes in it that were very visually powerful. There were several shots in this movie that I think would look great as a still shot framed and hung somewhere. That's partially a tribute to the cinematographer, but obviously a lot of people are involved in making scenes like that. There's one image towards the end of the film that's so powerful that it comes to my mind every day now and has just stuck with me.

I can't possible end this review without citing the fact that the tense scenes in this movie were so nerve-wracking that it was palpable. I've never been so afraid or anxious in a movie that wasn't in a horror genre before. Even though I felt a couple of times that he was being cheap in using music to build these moments, I appreciated how difficult they are to construct and didn't feel like they were being artificially dragged on but were just organic pieces of the film.

I don't know how to criticize this movie, I honestly don't. There's a reason why it has the second highest grossing second-half of August opening and the best opening weekend for any Tarantino film. I can say that it did start out slow, and if you're not willing to stick with it you may be inclined to even walk out earlier, but it's imperative that you stay through the end. Some scenes definitely could've been a little shorter, and some of the violence could've stood to be a little less graphic (and stomach twisting), but I don't feel like these were major drawbacks by any means. The humor in this movie was consistently fun and refreshing, and the provocative scenes were just as fun to watch unravel as your favorite scenes were in Pulp Fiction. If you're not squeamish, I cannot recommend this movie higher. I can see some people not appreciate how geeky some parts of this movie are, but you're going to be hard-pressed to find a movie this year with a better script or better acting. If you see it for nothing else please see it for those two things. I give this movie an A+, and I'm already dying to get my hands on it on Blu-ray (though I know that won't be until next year).

Addendum:

THE BLU-RAY

This is the first new release from directorial giant Quentin Tarantino that is released on Blu-ray and DVD simultaneously. His previous films on Blu-ray were just adapted for the format and so they don't take advantage of Blu-ray's additional benefits (other than great picture and sound quality) or have high definition special features. It seems like each Blu-ray I buy gets better and better in terms of overall presentation and navigation and picture quality (not counting Harry Potters 3-5, which I didn't get on their release dates, anyway), and Inglourious Basterds takes very little exception to that rule.

I think the overall picture quality of this Blu-ray may actually just barely surpass even Star Trek, but both look so good that it's honestly hard to judge. I don't think I've ever paused a Blu-ray before and had a hard time finding artifacts up close. They're usually not that bad and not noticeable while actually watching the film, but the fact that this movie looks just as crisp and clear when you pause as while you're watching it really speaks for the detail in every frame. Part of why I'm emphasizing pausing the film is that there are some really great shots that are wonderful portraits of an emotion or a plot device that I have to pause to get the full effect of, sometimes. Anyway, the colors always feel true and the detail in faces and objects and settings is unmistakeably meticulous. I didn't realize that my living room could be lit up so much by a movie set in World War II. To put it simply, this is the way a Tarantino film was meant to be enjoyed outside of a movie theater. Without a surround sound setup I'd feel weird to talk much to sound, but everything sounded great on my TV. It comes with subtitles and audio tracks in English, French, and Spanish, by the way.

For a Blu-ray presented so well I was definitely surprised by the lack of attractive features. First off, I liked the case right off the bat and its reflective quality in the light. When I put in the disc I was very happy that Universal didn't decide to barrage me with trailers and other junk like my WB Blu-rays do without fail. It's sad that it's become so prevalent that starting a disc with the main menu or feature film is something worth calling out. Anyway, it's cool that if you have a BD Live enabled player you get a ticker off to the right side with news that you can easily turn off and menu sound effects are optional (and default to being off). This is actually my first movie to take advantage of the 4 colored buttons on my remote: you can use them during the movie to help mark clips of the movie you like for easy reference and sending to friends (who I beleive must also have the disco watch your favorite scenes, which seems a bit silly but I can definitely understand why the studios would want it. Anyway, these options actually show up while your pause or seek during the movie, or if you hit 'down'.

As I alluded to, the special features are definitely lacking. I knew there was something to be concerned about when I realized that a 2-disc edition meant that one had to be a digital copy, which expires if you don't remember/have the time to use it before then. Anyway, only a few of the extras are in 1080p with the rest being in 720i (the box claims 1080i, but it didn't look it) or 480p. The best extras are the trailers, the posters, and the round table with Tarantino and Brad Pitt. The other stuff is surprising unexciting. There are a couple of fun things, like a behind-the-scenes look at Nation's Pride (that film itself is also included, but less than 10 minutes long) and greetings to the editor during takes, and then a couple of serious pieces, like a discussion of the posters in the movie and some interviews and behind-the-scenes looks with the creator of the original Inglorious Bastards and one of its stars, but that's about it. The 3 extended scenes included aren't very exciting and there's still a scene in the trailers that I haven't seen in its entirety so Universal is definitely holding back on us. There's also a trivia game and some BD Live features like live chat, streaming previews of other films, and sending clips to friends, but these are also just little things. If they had just included a commentary track I think it would've helped a lot. But alas, there are a still a few scenes that I'd like to know the original intentions of and I'll never know the intentions of, now.

Despite the failings of the special features, I think the picture quality of the feature film alone is enough to sell it. This is a movie with really great replay value, in my opinion, and that looks good enough that you'll really want to keep putting it in. I highly recommend it and think that the pros of this Blu-ray outweigh the dearth of special features to the point of earning 5 starts.",1251331200,4,11837,4.7476908118619345
3955259,5,B002MZZMRM,"Though it has been in the works for over a decade, ""Inglorious Basterds"" couldn't have been released at a better time for Tarantino's career. After the relatively restrained and ""mature"" ""Jackie Brown,"" ""Kill Bill"" represented a culmination of Tarantino's self-conscious, postmodern style. While his earlier films were still crime flicks at heart, ""Kill Bill"" had no core at all and is a total pastiche, integrating crime, westerns, thriller and martial arts elements without privileging any one style or having even the tiniest interest in reality. Attempting to top ""Kill Bill"" for sheer audacity and scope would be foolish but, at the same time, making another ""Jackie Brown"" would seem a little too plain and reiterative at this moment. Tarantino takes the third choice of making essentially the same sort of film he always had, but finally moving it from and contemporary setting and integrating a largely new set of influences. The trademarks are all present, and while the harsher critics will say it's still the same vile stew, it should be a bit fresher for those with a taste for the style. This has apparently worked for critics (who largely like it, though I expected a backlash), and I should imagine it will work for fans in the general public.

The early ads (inaccurately) made ""Basterds"" look like a rare modern war/adventure film ala ""The Dirty Dozen,"" where a ruthless Jewish-American squad and their commander Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) take vengeance on the Nazis. As usual, these titular figures are just one element of many, and we also follow the exploits ""The Jew Hunter"" Col. Landa (Christoph Waltz), an SS officer who is sent to France to operate, and French Jew Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent), a young woman who lost her family and barely escaped death at Landa's hand, and who later rides out the war in secret while running a Parisian movie theater. After a few chapters of introducing the characters, these figures all converge on Dreyfus's theater in June 1944, which will host the premiere of ""A Nation's Pride,"" a Nazi propaganda film celebrating Fredrick Zoller, a German war hero who is infatuated with Dreyfus. The premier (with Landa as head of security) will be attended by the German brass, which inspires the Allies to call on the Basterds and British Lt. Archie Hickox (Michael Fassbender) to go undercover and destroy the theater, while Dreyfus plans her own special welcome for the Nazis.

Though that description may sound plot heavy, the film is still rooted in Tarantino's trademark palaver-heavy style. And make no mistake, after the missteps in ""Death Proof,"" Tarantino's lengthy exchanges shine consistently once more. (And are, again, suddenly and gruesomely interrupted by graphic violence.) Overall, the dialogue is somewhat more restrained than it has been in Tarantino's post-""Reservoir Dogs"" work, with a bit less discussion of popular culture, and what is there (generally German cinema of the era) is relevant to the plot. More substantially, while Tarantino's old dialogue was extremely entertaining, he generates more authentic drama this time around. ""Basterds"" unleashes this approach immediately, opening with a gentle, smiling interrogation of a French farmer by the charming Landa. Even better is the encounter between the Hickox/the Basterds and Bridget von Hammersmark (an unconscionably gorgeous Diane Kruger), a German actress-turned-spy who has unwisely chosen a German-crowded tavern to convene in, resulting in a slow burn, probing interrogation (under the guise of conversation) of the undercover Hickox by a Gestapo Major. The latter scene is a high point in Tarantino's oeuvre, as it slowly builds and peaks, effortlessly keeping the viewer off balance. Relatedly, the film as a whole displays Tarantino's peerless ability to juxtapose drama, horror and humor in surprising and always entertaining ways. I'm sure his critics will continue to be unimpressed, but the initiated will likely take these transitions with ease.

As usual, in spite of his surreal, unbelievable style, Tarantino generates some intriguing, memorable characters. There is already Oscar hype for Waltz as Col. Landa. Landa cleverly plays with the traditional portrayal of the jackbooted SS officer. Instead of being controlled and formal or even conventionally charming, Waltz is instead a little goofy-looking with bad teeth, a slightly fey voice and an overly animated style. While lesser films would more frequently break with Landa's disarming style, ""Basterds"" holds back, keeping his faade of pleasantness up as long and as fully as possible. Pitt's Aldo Raine is also enjoyable. He's a shallow, one-note character, to be sure, but Pitt clearly has a lot of fun with him and he isn't given so much screen time as to wear out his welcome. Finally we have the lovely Laurent as Shosanna, who gives the film a certain amount of heart inside of all the absurdity. The performances are uniformly strong as well and are, as with most things in a Tarantino film, over the top without becoming outright parody. This is best exemplified in the taciturn, ever-scowling Til Schweiger as Stiglitz, an Austrian Jew who slaughtered German officers as an enlisted man before being adopted by the Basterds, and whose relentless intensity falls just short of ludicrous. (Schweiger would best be described as Bronson-esque.)

It goes without saying that the technical credits are impeccable and the soundtrack (lifted from other films and Morricone in particular) is always enjoyable. It doesn't have quite the level of technical flash of some of his earlier films, but Tarantino can still pull out all of the stops when he wants to, best illustrated in our arrival at the premiere, set to Bowie's ""Cat People"" track and highlighted by some elegant, prowling shots of the theater.

The ending is a source of controversy, and will no doubt be so for sometime. Frankly, I'm a bit baffled that so many were surprised by it. Anything else would've been too small or anticlimactic. Remember, the ""Inglourious Basterds"" is about film, not about WWII, and in film you can end it however you want. Check it out.

Grade: A",1251244800,4,6149,5.168674698795181
3955260,5,B002MZZMRM,"Before I get this review started, I must confess that I saw ""Inglourious Basterds"" twice in one weekend.  This is something that has NEVER happened to me.  Rarely do I even see a movie twice while it's still playing in theatres no matter how good it is.  I saw this Tarantino epic (it most certainly is epic, I kid you not) a second time with only a day separating my first viewing.

If there is one thing certain about Quentin Tarantino, it is this:  He plays by nobody's rules but his own.  He could care less if you end up loving or hating a flick of his.  And while there will most certainly be those who will detest the ""Basterds"" in every way, there will be those who will fall head-over-heels for it.  Filled with great acting, excellent story and pacing, trademark Tarantino humor and at times over-the-top violence that can only be fitting for an epic such as this, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is an unforgettable experience.

Without giving too much away, I will be as brief as possible when it comes to the story.  Seriously, the less you know the more surprising and fulfilling it will be.  As the first chapter states, ""Once upon a time in Nazi-occupied France,"" a group of Jewish-American soldiers called ""The Basterds"" are exacting revenge on any and all Nazis they encounter.  Brad Pitt is the leader of this outfit and he has made clear that no mercy is to be shown to them and that they are not in this to take prisoners.  The Nazis must be shown the exact same horror and violence that they themselves have inflicted on others.  A Jewish woman loses her entire family at the hands of the Nazis and when she comes to own a movie theater some years later, she surprisingly gets an opportunity for some retribution and revenge.

Now, I know from my brief synopsis, it sounds like a mindless revenge thriller bent on non-stop action and carnage.  Hell, even the trailers present the film in such a light, but I can promise you that this is not the case.  The film is much more story and character oriented.  In fact, what you'll find more in this movie is maddening tension.  What can appear to be an innocent conversation can immediately transform into something more sinister.  The opening scene, which I will not explain what happens, is a great example of how tense Tarantino can make it with very little action.  The writing is confidently crafted, and the movie also plays like a foreign film since there are a lot of subtitles--but please, do not let that scare you away.  Brad Pitt is humorous and perfect for the role of ""Lt. Aldo Raine.""  Christoph Waltz who plays ""Col. Hans Landa"" definitely deserves an Academy Award nomination for his outstanding portrayal of somebody who is so evil, and yet so terrifyingly calm and well mannered for the most part.

""Inglourious Basterds"" gets my vote of being the best film of '09 so far, and it's hard for me to imagine finding another movie that will top it.  It may not be for everyone, but it's for sure an experience you'll most likely not forget no matter what your overall feelings towards the film is in the end.  It is long and there is a lot of dialogue, but once you see it as a whole you'll realize it couldn't have been done any other way.  If you're looking for a non-stop action extravaganza, you will be disappointed.  An action extravaganza, this is not... this is a film, and a confident and daring one at that!  One of the best times I've had in a theater in years! -Michael Crane",1251244800,,3460,4.517684887459807
3955261,4,B002MZZMRM,"Let's face it, if you are not a Tarantinoist (I am one), you will not like this film. If you are one, you will like it, but bitch a little bit about this or that. It is too long! (I do not think so!) It is silly in parts! (yes, it surely is, but not all the time, and even some of the silliest jokes have their own charm --- like the Fuehrer asking his body guards for gum.) There is too much talking! (I do not think so at all, the dialogues or larger conversation groups are brillant!)

Story: in WW2, a Jewish commando of US soldiers works in Nazi France behind enemy lines, going for the kill of Nazis and taking scalps, led by 'Apache' Brad Pitt, supported by a 'golem' who kills with a baseball bat. Then the plot gets enriched by a big project: Operation Kino, a planned en gros assassination of Nazi leaders during a movie premiere in Paris.
Enough told. Good action.

The acting: Brad Pitt's Aldo Raine is a caricature, unfortunately. The leader of the cast is, without doubt, the previously little known bad guy, the SS officer with the nickname Jew Hunter. And a secret weapon that works well: Martin Wuttke's Fuehrer is brillant. He doesn't look so genuine, but he does sound like the real one!

3955262,4,B002MZZMRM,"There are some lengthy reviews here so I'll keep mine short. ""Inglorious Basterds"" is an entetaining movie. As with most Tarantino films, you'd expect some great, almost surreal visuals, too much dialouge and really not as much action as a typical action movie would contain. The dialouge is probaly the best he's done since Pulp Fiction. The humor is there, the wit and sincerity are all in place. Although most of the characters are cartoonish and sterotypical, the acting across the board is top notch. Despite many reviews calling this an ensemble piece, this is about Bradd Pitt and Christoph Waltz. It is easily Pitt's best character since Fight Club and Tarantino's best written since Jules in Pulp Fiction. Although the movie is well above average throughout, much like Pulp Fiction, I was waiting for Lt. Aldo Raine to make his next appearence. Christoph Waltz as Hans Landa is mezmorizing and the sense of forboding while he is onscreen is pallatable despite his always plesaent demenor. I will say the exchanges near the end between pro and antagonist seemed very unlikely, even in this crazy alternate history that Tarantino has created, but was satisfying none the less. I will say that some of the music, voice overs and name tags take away from the movie. This was one time where Tarantino could have let his film stand with no gimmicks and it would have been better.

Tarantino and his films are polarizing (as evidenced by trolls giving unhelpfuls to most reviews). Even his fan base is split on what his best movie is. Regardless, this fits into the Tarantino cannon. IB is not Saving Private Ryan. It's not realistic, at all. The violence IS graphic, but IS NOT action packed. There is A LOT of dialouge, and much of it is in subtitles. I enjoyed IB, but it lacks the depth and subtext of District 9 and The Hurt Locker and I would place it third this summer on my list of favorites.

As far as the Blu-Ray portion. The packaging actually gets the inferior cover (the DVD has the retro style ensemble). There is a digital copy, as is becoming standard. The picture quality in the open environments really pops, but I wouldn't go so far as to say it's reference quality. In the grand scope, the picture quality is very good, as you would expect from most movies made in the last couple of years, but not mind blowing. The audio is also solid. As you would expect, the gunfire is almost startling and the music explodes into your speakers. The extras have as much info about the making of ""National Pride"" as the other extras combined, including the full length feature as directed by Eli Roth. Pretty good stuff.

I was able to purchase IB for about two dollars more than the standard DVD and would reccommend to film fans, even if you're not a Tarantino fan.",1251158400,,2777,4.663265306122449
3955263,1,B002MZZMRM,"""Overrated"" and ""boring as hell.""  These are the words that kept coming to mind during the three hours of monotony that my friends recommended to me as ""amazing.""  Either they were lying to me, they saw a different ""Inglourious Basterds"", or I'm the only one who can see that the emperor is naked.

I enjoyed the three previous Quentin Tarantino films I've seen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pulp-Fiction/dp/1558908242/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pulp Fiction</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reservoir-Dogs/dp/B00008975Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reservoir Dogs</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grindhouse-Presents-Death-Proof/dp/B000U9X1UM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grindhouse Presents Death Proof</a>.  Not much happens, but there's a certain theatricality to the way Tarantino's often-nonlinear stories unfold.

""Basterds"" has all of the Tarantino trademarks: long stretches of mundane, but amusing, dialogue, larger than life characters, and occasional splatters of gore.  But in his previous films, Tarantino was able to pull all this off with more panache.  Every heavily-subtitled (most of the dialogue is either in German or French) scene drags its feet for what seems like forever, and only sometimes does the dialogue even approach being interesting.  The plot, little there is, is divided into episodic chapters like a 1940's ""Pulp Fiction.""  But this time, Tarantino exchanges depth for period detail, as if the historical significance of WWII will make up for all of the movie's shortcomings.  The Basterds of the title, a team of Jewish American soldiers infiltrating German-occupied France to take brutal revenge on Nazi soldiers, actually get only a small percentage of the screen time.  Most of the chapters focus on the film's German and French characters.

While Tarantino's previous efforts were made up of characters that started out resembling pulp creations and then grew in terms of complexity, all of the characters in ""Basterds"", both heroes and villains, are as flat as cardboard from beginning to end.  This wouldn't be such a bad thing if the film was an action movie like the trailers seemed to suggest.  But ""Basterds"" is completely dialogue and character driven.  90% of the movie is people having conversation while sitting at tables.

While ""Pulp Fiction"" featured a colorful cast led by Samuel L. Jackson (who lends his voice to ""Basterds"" as a narrator for a couple brief moments) and Bruce Willis, ""Basterds"" eschews stars for lesser known international character actors.  Not to say any of them are bad actors.  Christoph Waltz, Daniel Bruhl, and the haunting, enchanting Melanie Laurent are actually quite good.  But none of them are able to entertain for any reasonable amount of time with the flat characters and even flatter dialogue they are given to work with.  Diane Kruger (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/National-Treasure-National-Treasure-2-Book-of-Secrets-Walt-Disney-2-Pack-Collection/dp/B001UTZBOU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">National Treasure , National Treasure 2 Book of Secrets : Walt Disney 2 Pack Collection</a>) is pushed to the background for most of her scenes.  Brad Pitt, effortlessly evoking a lazy Tennessee accent, is entertaining every minute he's on screen, but those minutes are actually few and far between.  The most entertaining performance actually comes from Mike Myers(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Austin-Powers-International-Man-of-Mystery-The-Spy-Who-Shagged-Me-Goldmember/dp/B00006WUWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery/The Spy Who Shagged Me/Goldmember</a>!), in one scene in the middle of ""Basterds"", as a British General.

Perhaps the worst thing I can say about the movie is it actually had me rooting for the Nazis a few times, just because the Basterds were almost as loathsome.  In the end, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is more boring than any film about a plot to assassinate Hitler has a right to be and offers little to the cinema other than a title that rolls off the tongue nicely.",1251158400,44,4220,6.350262697022767
3955264,5,B002MZZMRM,"Quentin Tarantino has always had a love affair with the medium of film, and he shows it once again in ""Inglourious Basterds,"" which he has persisted in classifying as a spaghetti western disguised as a World War II historical epic. He's obviously much closer to this movie than I am, but I think it transcends genre altogether; it's not about the story so much as the craft, the meticulous attention to the many details that make a film a film. On the one hand, there's what we see physically presented on the screen--the carefully structured shots, the placement of character, the bold color scheme. On the other hand, there are the numerous cinematic references, not the least of which is title itself, taken from an Enzo Castellari film (both words spelled correctly, of course). There's also the fact that a movie theater plays prominently in the plot, as does celluloid. Even the casting of Eli Roth, himself a filmmaker, is none too subtle.

It would probably be enough for it to work at such a visual level, but Tarantino made an effort to include a thoroughly absorbing story that would be preposterous in the hands of any other director. But this isn't your grandfather's World War II film; this is a bold, raucous, cold-blooded tale of intrigue and vengeance in Nazi occupied France, where history will freely and joyfully be rewritten for the sake of entertainment. At the heart of this is the premiere of a German film depicting the exploits of a Nazi soldier. This premiere, which is held in a Paris movie theater, will see the attendance of Hermann Goering, Paul Goebbels, Martin Bormann, and most importantly, Adolf Hitler. The four most important German figures will be in the same place at the same time, which is just perfect for those who want to destroy the Nazi regime once and for all.

As it turns out, two assassination plots are unfolding. The first one involves the Basterds, a squad of eight Jewish-Americans led by Lieutenant Aldo Raine, a.k.a. Aldo the Apache (Brad Pitt), a hick from Maynardville, Tennessee with a very visible scar trailing across his throat. This man has one thing on his mind and one thing only: Revenge against the Nazis. It wouldn't be enough for him to want them all dead. He instructs his men to each collect 100 Nazi scalps as a souvenir. The few that are let go are forced to spread the word about who the Basterds are and what they plan to do. His right hand man is Staff Sergeant Donny Donowitz (Roth), who the Nazis have nicknamed The Bear Jew and fear might be a golem summoned by a rabbi. Imposing, loud, and mad as hell, Donowitz's trademark is beating Nazis to death with a wooden baseball bat.

The second plot involves a French-Jewish girl named Shosanna Dreyfus (Mlanie Laurent), the sole survivor of an attack back in 1941 who has been on the run ever since. Posing as Emmanuelle Mimieux, she operates a movie theater in Paris. One day, she's approached by a young German soldier named Frederick Zoller (Daniel Brhl), who finds her attractive. A war hero and an actor, Zoller convinces Goebbels (Sylvester Groth) to hold the premiere of a German propaganda film in Shosanna's theater.

I dare not reveal what Shosanna or the Basterds have planned, nor will I go into detail about the ending, which documents an event that never actually happened. For ""Inglourious Basterds,"" World War II isn't a blueprint, but merely a backdrop for Tarantino to indulge in the lurid theatricality he's known for. One of the film's best qualities is the dialogue, so carefully worded and deliberately paced, able to build tension as effectively as anything visual. Tarantino hasn't always gotten dialogue to work, as was the case with ""Death Proof,"" the second half of the equally theatrical ""Grindhouse."" Here, the words don't seem like unnecessary narrative pauses, but like a tool that works hand in hand with the way the film looks. The main antagonist, the cunning, witty, and deliciously evil Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), is given some the film's greatest moments of dialogue, probably because he's one of the film's best characters.

I can't bring myself to say that Tarantino is trying to make a statement with ""Inglourious Basterds."" As has been the case before, the very lifeblood of this film is the art of filmmaking. It's a visual treat, certainly, but it's also meticulously worded, and this is in spite of the fact that the characters are exceptionally (and deliberately) broad. The exception to this, possibly, is Landa, who's cruel yet handles himself with the same air of dignity as a well-mannered boy trying to impress his elders. I don't think it's unreasonable or premature to predict that Waltz will receive an Oscar nomination for his performance. The film itself is a likely candidate for a Best Picture nomination, and for good reason: It's wild, rollicking film that doesn't care about history so much as pure entertainment.",1251158400,5,4910,4.8474374255065555
3955265,4,B002MZZMRM,"One of the great pleasures of Quentin Tarantino movies is the wonderfully inventive casting that he employs.  In PULP FICTION, he revived the career of John Travolta, made Samuel Jackson a star, pushed Bruce Willis into another echelon and even helped get Ving Rhames off to a good start.  In JACKIE BROWN, he burnished Pam Grier & Robert Forster's careers.  In KILL BILL, he reinvented Uma Thurman and reinvigorated David Carradine.  Even in DEATH PROOF, he introduced the world to the amazing stuntwoman Zoe Bell and gave Kurt Russell the kind of part he's missed out on for too long.

And now, wonderfully, in INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, he's introduced the American viewer to some stellar European actors, namely Melanie Laurent and particularly Christoph Waltz, now an easy favorite for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar.

Tarantino also frequently tries the patience of his viewers with his rococo dialogue and insistence on constantly reminding us that we're watching a movie.  In PULP FICTION, all his ""habits"" were fresh and new to most viewers (because, really, how many of us had seen RESERVOIR DOGS before we saw FICTION?), but over time, we learned that Tarantino was often just a little too pleased with his own screenwriting and often too pleased with his own directing.  In a completely off-the-wall piece like the priceless KILL BILL films, everything worked to form a crazy-quilt whole.  In INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, he's too clever for his own good at times.

BASTERDS tells the completely untrue story of how World War II might have ended had a group of bloodthirsty, highly trained American Jews been allowed to infiltrate Nazi occupied France with no mission other than to take Nazi scalps.  Oh, and how that mission needed to collide with one fateful night when all the top leadership of Germany attended the gala opening of a new propaganda film held at a movie theatre owned by a beautiful French girl who was actually a Jew who had escaped a massacre that had taken her entire family and now she's bent on revenge at any cost.  And of how her goal coincides with that of an undercover British agent who just happens to be a German film scholar and a German double agent who happens to be a movie star.

I know that sounds a little confusing.  To Tarantino's credit, the plot as laid out in this 150 minute film is actually easy to follow.  In fact, he's put everything into easy-to-digest chapters.  It does ask us to believe that every important member of the German government & military would all assemble in a fairly public place at one time...but if you can get past that hurdle, there is much vicarious pleasure to be had in watching WWII reinvented by Tarantino.

By far, the best part of the film is Chapter 1.  It features Waltz as SS officer Col. Hans Landa in what is easily the most chilling portrayal of a Nazi since Ralph Fiennes donned the uniform in SCHINDLER'S LIST.  Fiennes role (and that entire brilliant movie) were for altogether different purposes.  Landa comes off more like a Nazi Hannibal Lecter (without the strange dining preferences)...he's a bit of a lone wolf in his own party.  He's feared by all, because he has a wonderful BS detector that helps him root out deception at every turn.  In the opening scene, which plays out like a delicate one-act play, Landa comes to a humble French farmhouse and speaks with the owner.  We know the owner is hiding Jews beneath his floorboard, and we're pretty sure Landa knows it too.  Just how he gets that information, through one of the most tense interrogation scenes you'll ever see, is a joy to behold.  You literally find yourself not breathing.  I leaned forward in my seat.  And yet there is never a raised voice, nor a threatening gesture.  The screws are applied through intensity of manner.  Waltz instantly makes his character a classic.  Tarantino the writer has crafted brilliant dialogue, and Tarantino the director films it all with rare taste and simplicity, and Waltz knocks it out of the park.

The rest of the film is more uneven.  While Brad Pitt is a goofy delight as Aldo Raine, leader of the Basterds...it's a performance that is more campy than believable.  His Basterds, including folks like director Eli Roth and B.J. Novak from TV's ""The Office"" are fairly interchangeable.  And strangely, we look forward to them conducting KILL BILL PT. ONE type mayhem, yet they actually use relatively little screentime showing them in action.  There is one short, effective scene of their own brand of interrogation...but mostly we have to take the word of other characters (like Hitler himself) that these guys are wreaking havoc on the Nazis.

And during one jarring moment, we are introduced to one of the basterds with a blast of `70s era Blaxploitation music and a `70s era title card.  Why?  Yes, it was funny...but it took everyone totally out of the spell the movie was weaving.  Just as having Michael Myers, in thick but unconvincing makeup, play a British officer hatching a scheme to blow up a movie theater, was very distracting.  Myers accent is impeccable, and he plays the part straight...but he's still unmistakably Myers and many audience members snickered when they recognized him.  Very distracting.

It's as though Tarantino doesn't quite believe that he can make a straightforward film and have it be riveting.  Too bad...because when he gets out of his own way (as he mostly does in the climactic sequences of the film), INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is a cinematic treat.  The gorgeous settings and lovely costumes even gave Tarantino a chance to show off and have it fit the tone of the film...but he still insists on going off the rails.  ""Hey, this is a Tarantino movie!"" he seems to want to shout at us.  And this causes him to get in the way of the stunning Melanie Laurant, who plays the vengeful theater owner.  I've never seen her before, and she is an entrancing presence, whether in casual slacks or a gorgeous formal red dress.  She dominates the final portions of the film.

I had a great time at this film, and I recommend it fairly highly.  But with 10 minutes less of the sometimes too clever dialogue and 5 minutes less of Tarantino's showboating, and we might have had a true classic of suspense.  See it, though, because the two performances I mentioned are worth the price of admission...heck, the opening scene is worth it.",1251072000,361,6357,4.791551882460974
3955266,5,B002MZZMRM,"First off, THIS IS NOT A HISTORY LESSON FILM AND IT'S NOT HISTORICALLY ACCURATE.  GET OVER IT!!!!  Anyone who goes to films, fictional films as pulpy as this, looking for an education in ANYTHING, or a lesson in history is a MORON.  A simple moron who needs to read more books.  Stop with the ranting about the history.  Jeez people grow up, and don't worry about the poor simpering children.  If your kids are so stupid that they get their history from cinema then they're only slightly bigger morons then you are.  Phew....

Tarantino, like Scorsese and Robert Altman, is one of the few directors that has never disappointed me with their varied directorial efforts.  Though Four Rooms was disappointing, but his room's story wasn't awful it just wasn't very good.  This film is not a remake of the Italian exploitation film from the 70's starring Fred Williamson either.  I guess Quentin just liked the title, but in true Tarantino genre-bending, transcendent fashion he uses a wrong spelling of the title.  Which says more about the men belonging to the group, but I am not going to say why, that's for the individual to figure out if they choose to.  This is Tarantino's Dirty Dozen, but it's really not.  It's two seperate stories set in German occupied France that have only one setting and goal in common.

Our first, and more dramatic story line of pulp involves a hiding Jewish girl and her cinema hosting the premiere for Groebbles new propaganda film.  It's by happenstance that she gets this chance for revenge against her childhood tormentors and she cooks up a grand scheme.  This whole plot thread is so fun and ingenius.  Perfectly acted.

The second, is of the Basterds themselves.  Basically, this team made up of American Jews and one German traitor have safely(not sure how this is possible) hidden behind enemy lines and taken out as many Germans as possible.  They've hatched a plot, with the help of the British and a German actress to take down the same movie premiere.

Both plot lines revolve around the cinema.  Do you think it's a coincidence that Tarantino chose a cinema for his final showdown?  It's not and there's a fairly subtle message in regard to how cinema effects the truth and the dreams strewn throughout the film.  I haven't seen many Amazon reviewers address this, the most impressive and exciting part of this film.  Wonder why.  I am not going to blather on about the meanings and the points, that's for you dear viewer to get on you own...or not.  Lets just say, look at the tone shift between Shoshann's story and the Basterd's stories.  You'll notice they're not the same.  The sillier one becomes more mythic and the more realistic one becomes the stuff of myths, the stuff of films.

Mr. Cristoph is sure fire Oscar bate this year for best supporting actor.  He plays the insidious Hans Landa AKA The Jew Hunter for the SS.  This character and performance is so good that he managed to make a glass of milk seem ominous.  The opening see when we first meet this character is perfect and brilliantly executed and performed by Cristophe and Tarantino.  We get a similar scene later on between Shoshanna and Landa over some pastries.  The tension couldn't be cut with a knife, and when the milk is ordered by Landa we in the audience start to get nervous.  Brilliant.

Brad Pitt plays the leader of the Basterds, Aldo Reigns(yes, when said fast it sounds like Aldo Ray, which I'm sure is on purpose and only means anything to real film fans).  Pitt is sublime.  He won't get the credit he deserves for this part, but he should.  He's playing the type of war movie hero that most likely never really existed outside anyone's head.  It's a broad performance and totally unscared.  He goes for every big and rediculous moment like a dog to a meaty bone.  He adds a flavor to the film that signals the tone shifts, while playing the type of good 'ol boy, ra-ra, USA, USA type of hero that the 40's propaganda would have us modern folks believe was real.  It's an Eastwood or Wayne type of character and I could see him popping up again in a different story.  We only really get to know a few of the other Basterds.  Bear Jew(Hostel I and II director Eli Roth), and Til Schweiger's one man Nazi killing machine.  Both are drawn as people through acts of violence.  We also get to meet a British spy and an undercover German actress helping to take down Hitler played by Diane Kruger.  Kruger, while lovely to look at, has not impressed me once in any of her previous roles in the National Treasure films(BLECH!) and Troy(not an awful film).  Finally, with Inglourious Basterds she proves to be more then just a pretty face.  She's really good in this film while being under scrutiny of the SS and also playing that old-school movie star.  She excels at both.  The actress who plays Shoshanna is alos quite good and thankfully very restrained, well until the end.  Her story juxtaposed with the Basterds is helped considreably by her grounded performance.

People are already complaining that for a film called Inglourious Basterds we don't spend a lot of time or get to know those characters.  I say, YAWN!  Why are people so literal?  Is there something in the water?  ""Gee golly, it's called 'Inglourious Basterds' so why ain't they the stars of the film?  I don't like it.  They done tricked me!""  Yeah, well no...idiots.  The Basterds are the mythical bigger then life characters in this film.  We CAN'T know them on a deeper level, that would take all their power away.  They're symbols of a cinematic archetype that helps Tarantino make his main thesis when compared to the Shoshanna plot thread.  Get it?  Yeah, I didn't think you did...

I hope you like Ennio Morricone because some of his classic scores to many an Italian film makes up most of the score to this film, with some Bowie for good measure.  It's odd, with Tarantion's first three films, Resevoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, he used only source music.  With Kill Bill, Death Proof, and now this he seems to use source with older film's scores.  Though, he seems to stick with the same people like Morricone and Bernard Herman.  It's just interesting to note that he doesn't like original scores to be written for his films(unless its his pal Robert Rodriguez or The RZA for Kill Bill), but lately used the scores to other films.  I guess one does fall in love with the temp tracks.  Plus, the scores used are so obscure only real film nerds would notice they weren't new.  They fit the images so well.  ""Gasoline on the Fire"" by David Bowie is the first use of something modern for a film by Tarantino.  It works like gangbusters here.  It rips up the speakers as images of Shoshanna preparing for her final day and ultimate revenge play out in a fetishistic fashion with the reddest of red dressed you've ever seen on screen.  Perfection.

I'd like to take a moment to thak Tarantino and others for saving my movie going life this summer.  It's been a rough summer filled with utter garbage(Transformers 2. G.I. Joe) and mediocrity(Terminator: Salvation, Wolverine).  The real films this year were few but worth checking out more then once.  Inglourious Basterds, District 9, Drag Me To Hell, 500 Days of Summer, and honorable mention goes to J.J. Abrams revamped alterante dimension version of Star Trek.  Everything between or after these mentioned films aren't worth shelling out the dough to see in theaters.  Maybe as rentals or perhaps on cable when you've broken your leg and its raining out.  It's sad to know that the really good films this summer aren't doing as much bussiness as the crap I mentioned.  Well, except Star Trek, but that was the only one in the list that was a sequel/remake.  Yeah, that's it!  If it's original, not a remake, and doesn't have a number next to its title we don't go and see it.  Hmmm, maybe these REAL filmmakers should trick people into thinking that their films are sequels and just add numbers to the titles for no reason.  Oooh, but they would also need to be able to make action figures.  DAMN! Foiled again.

At least we can take solace in knowing real good art will live beyond box office receipts while those who rake in the dough for a few weeks will be forgotten in the grand scheme of things.",1251072000,3,8267,4.637241379310344
3955267,5,B002MZZMRM,"First off, make no mistake that Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is a film that isn't for everyone.  Second, for those that have seen the trailers and clips for the film and have decided that this is a film for them, Inglourious Basterds is something indeed that is absolutely awesome.  Brad Pitt stars as Lt. Aldo Raine, a southern boy leading a crew of Jewish-American soldiers in Nazi-occupied France to do one thing only: kill as many Nazi's as they can.  On the other side is Nazi Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), who lives up to his name as a ""Jew Hunter"", and is headed on a collision course with Aldo and his crew.  Also into play is vengeace driven cinema owner Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) and German actress/double agent Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger); all of which ends up culminating in a blood-drenched ball of fire.  Lacking almost any form of subtlety, Tarantino pulls no punches not only in the film's violence, but in the build-up and tension that leads up to its depiction of brutality, and everyone involved seems to be having a blast doing it.  Pitt is wonderful, and Waltz in particular gives a star-making performance that is undoubtedly the highlight of the film.  Even Hostel director Eli Roth manages to make an impression as Aldo's baseball bat-wielding ""Bear Jew"".  As said before, Inglourious Basterds is not a film for everyone in the least, but Tarantino's unique mixture of revenge-drama, spaghetti western, and World War II saga is truly something to behold regardless.",1250985600,,1518,4.948818897637795
3955268,4,B002MZZMRM,"Inglourious Basterds is supposedly about Nazi-hunting in World War II, a revenge fantasy where Jewish-American guerillas (or terrorists, as the Nazis point out) are tasked with spreading fear and loathing throughout France.  Led by the rustic Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), the Basterds have but one task: to each collect 100 Nazi scalps.  Please note: this review contains spoilers.

One might think, given the title and the trailers, that this is an action film filled with the occasional machinegun dialogue Quentin Tarantino is famous for.  It's quite the opposite: a series of measured vignettes in which the tension is ratcheted up to feverish heights, then explodes in quick, messy violence.

The opening scene sets the stage: Han Landa (Christoph Waltz), AKA ""The Jew Hunter,"" does what he does best in France.  As such, he is the nemesis of spies and revolutionaries hiding in plain sight.  Landa hunts down Shosanna's (Melanie Laurent) family in a terrifying exchange that culminates in the death of her family.  Out of mere whim, ego, or simply being true to his hawk-like nature, Landa lets Shosanna escape.  Her survival will have grave repercussions for the German war effort.

These two plots, the Basterds and Shosanna's revenge, eventually intertwine when Hitler and his entourage arrive to view a special showing of a Nazi-propaganda film (Stolz der Nation) in Paris. The film stars Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), a Nazi war hero who singlehandedly killed dozens of enemies from a sniper tower.

Tarantino never just makes a film to tell a story, as evidenced by the obvious digressions from history he takes with Basterds. He films a vibe, an expression -- in doing so, Tarantion comments on the nature of the cinema and our own humanity.  And this time, he's aiming his camera at the audience.

You see, this film isn't just about Nazi hunting, or Pitt's funny accent, or the tension between agents who know their social repartee will end in blood; it's about violence in the movies and how we glorify it.  And Tarantino is merciless as he judges every person involved with the film guilty:

The producers are guilty: Goebbels (Sylvester Groth) is a simpering suck-up who is far too enamored with the approval of his audience to see how vile his film is.

The actors are guilty: Actress Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) is a duplicitous murderer who shoots an unarmed man in cold blood. Zoller, the star of Stolz der Nation, has no stomach to watch his own murders taking place on the big screen but is only too happy to bully a woman with his affections.

Even the projectionist is guilty: Shosanna is so consumed with her revenge that only in killing a man does she finally see his humanity.

But the most guilty of all is the audience in the theater watching Stolz der Nation. They are shot, burned, and blown to bits at the end.  That was the goal, of course - to kill as many Nazis as possible, right?  It's just a goal that doesn't seem quite so laudable if you happen to be a member of the audience.

From the images of soldiers dying in the Nazi propaganda film to the graphic scenes of Nazis being scalped, Tarantino holds up a mirror. Are you enjoying this, he asks?  Because if so...

You're the basterd.",1250985600,11,3236,4.8014440433212995

Waltz performance begins & ends the movie & brings the parallel story lines together. Both should be strongly considered when award season comes around.

So goes *Inglourious Basterds*, a ""macaroni combat"" film full of nice touches and beautiful faces. Director/writer Quentin Tarantino has stepped out of the comfortable shoes of `70's exploitation films to tackle the 1940's. The result is an enjoyable, if odd attack on the subject of World War II.

To my surprise, *Inglourious Basterds* is neither particularly violent nor particularly bloody. There is no nudity and hardly any four-letter words. What I would consider a ""soft R"". There are a few brief shootouts, plus a climax reminiscent of both&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carrie/dp/B00005K3NR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carrie</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark/dp/B0014Z4OMU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>. Movie virgins might shudder at a few scenes of knife play. But for dirty old film fans like me, it's soft-core.

Don't mistake this for a new leaf. Tarantino presents another vengeful exploitation movie--awash in swastikas, set pieces, and sexy ladies. It includes anachronistic music, graphic overlays to point out major characters, spotty narration--even Mike Meyers in another outlandish role as an outlandish Briton.

Thus, *Inglourious* is not Quentin's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saving-Private-Ryan/dp/B00001ZWUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saving Private Ryan</a>.

Far from the ""more mature"" film as his backers call it, Quentin's film struck me as shallow. The Basterds trade characters for caricatures, conflict for clich&eacute;'s. It doesn't help that Tarantino splices two stories into the space of one, leaving some hefty gaps in the story.

But as mise-en-scene (that's French for ""setting in scene"" as in ""kill us some Nazis""), Inglourious Basterds impressed me. Tarantino hasn't lost his knack for framing, even as the scenes bolt between two plots. There's never a frumpy costume nor an ornament out of place. Quentin also brings back his *Kill Bill* cinematographer Robert Richardsen. Only this time, they avoid the fancy camera work of previous films: favoring fixed cameras, quantities of cuts, and close-ups. The film quality and colors look sharper than ever.

So does the acting. There's hardly a puddle of depth to any character, but they are played as masterfully as a cartoon can get. Already, Christoph Waltz wins praise for his diplomatically demonic role as SS Colonel Landa. His character keeps up the sinister charm for so long that it's a genuine shock whenever he does anything else. And Brad Pitt's Aldo Raines, while being the most hackneyed caricature in Quentin cinema (next to Meyer's General Fenech), gives a pitch-perfect performance as a sociopathic redneck out to kill hizzself some Nat-zies. My quiet favorite, though, was Daniel Bruhl as Fredrick Zoller--a kind of Nazi Audie Murphy. Tarantino deserves further credit too, for these characters and their scene-edible dialogue.

Indeed, the best tension in the film comes in the personal confrontations. It is ridiculous how often our heroes meet with suspicious interrogators. But I found my eyes averting and my seat squirming as the cold-eyed enemy waits for his answer.

I enjoyed my time in the theater--in fact, I was the only one who seemed to be laughing out loud at the jokes. But I gotta tell you the truth... in some respects this film is less enjoyable than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Proof/dp/B000R7HY0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Proof</a>.

Not that I thought *Death Proof* was a bad film. While it had way too much fat, it was still recognizably Tarantino, with his themes, characters, and plot. *Inglourious Basterds*, on the other hand, tries to be a Tarantino film. As Review Lover points out (16 August review), the Quentin style feels like it has come off an assembly line to fill an order.

Partly because it's too self-referential. Julie Dreyfus returns from *Kill Bill* as a Nazi mistress. Harvey Keitel and Samuel L. Jackson return to lend their voices. The film's central antagonist feels like it was written with Tim Roth in mind (though the actor does not appear). While the leading lady looks like a French version of The Bride. Then there are the numerous fourth-wall references to nitrate film, film projection, and film making, as the heart of the story beats inside of a movie theater within the movie.

Self-reference can fall flat on its face for me, as it does with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jay-and-Silent-Bob-Strike-Back/dp/B00003CY67/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</a>. Fortunately, Tarantino is too smooth to stumble like that. Otherwise, the big problem is that Tarantino tries to tell too much story into too little space.

The much touted female characters thus struck me as pretty faces. I think Diane Kruger and Melanie Laurent offer a lot of talent and potential. Especially Laurent as a 1940's Beatrix Kiddo, wielding film instead of swords. But they just aren't given enough role for my tastes.

Men don't often do much better. The Jew Bear, interesting in idea and appearance is, plays one-note. Which is more than can be said for his no-note companions. The eponymous Basterds are absent throughout most of their own film. In contrast stands Michael Fassbender, who schmoozed me as the suave-but-short-tempered Lt. Hicox. His brief time on screen has a measurable impact on the story, something that should have been the case with many other characters.

Ultimately, this movie feels like it should have been broken up into two Volumes, or expanded to the runtime of Grindhouse. Tarantino has so much to show and to say that by presenting Inglourious Basterds as is, he cheats me as much as he cheats himself.",1250985600,7,6732,5.867075664621677
3955272,5,B002MZZMRM,"Quentin Tarantino can do a lot of things wrong- he has occasional pacing problems and sometimes becomes too enamored of his own dialogue to keep the story flowing.  But when he gets it right- oh boy, when he gets it right!  And with Inglourous Basterds- QT does everything right from the opening frame to the closing.

This war movie is unlike any war movie.  This Tarantino movie is unlike any Tarantino movie.  For those looking for Kill Bill-level bloodbaths, be warned- the violence in Basterds is as deliberate and restrained as a swastika carved into skin.  Additionally,a generous portion of the movie is in subtitled French or German.

Basterds introduces some of Tarantino's most.... delightful characters (that seems such an inappropriate word, but see the movie and try to come up with a better one).  Brad Pitt delivers an uproarious turn as Lt. Aldo Raine, the guerilla leader who's having a grand old time.  But the real standouts are Nazi Col. Landa (the Jewhunter) who's simultaneously ridiculous and terrifying and Shosanna Dreyfus the capable, understated but divinely ruthless fugitive heroine.  And the supporting characters are all sharp, snappy, real- the perfect balance between believably human and interesting charicatures.

Tarantino's movies can suffer from editing problems- but Basterds is not one of them.  The scenes are varied between taut suspense and black humor worthy of Alfred Hitchock.  The signature violence stands out in the few memorable incidents without being lost in a sea of artery-slicing.  And the plot is supremely, childishly satisfying.  Inglourious Basterds is the perfect paradox- a Tarantino movie with restraint.  The revisionist history-cum-revenge-fantasy is wild enough to stand without wall-to-wall gore, in fact gratuitous violence would make it almost too outlandish.  But with Basterds, Tarantino walks the line and proves himself once again, that elusive breed of bastard- a director who can surprise.",1250899200,,1964,5.386885245901639
3955273,4,B002MZZMRM,"The mark of a great film is the degree to which you continue to think about it after you exit the theater. And in the case of Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"", I've been thinking about it almost non-stop since. On the surface, it may seem like a shallow, one dimensional film about a squad of Nazi-scalping Jews. If you take the story at face value, they are the ""Basterds"". And some have complained that the Basterds get too little screen time. However, after pondering the film for a while, you realize that almost every character in the film is an inglourious basterd in his/her own way: they take every opportunity to lie, cheat, pretend, betray and otherwise play dirty.

Christop Waltz steals the show as Colonel Hans Landa, the charming, brilliant, and (above all) evil SS officer. As it turns out, Landa is by far the biggest basterd of them all. In almost every scene, you wonder what this guy is up to. And he surprises you--even when he shouldn't. Perhaps the finest scene is when Landa is interviewing Shoshanna (who is pretending to be Emmanuelle Mimieux) as a prelude to using her cinema for a big Nazi film premiere. You know he suspects that something is very wrong with her, but he mysteriously backs off at the last second. Though its unprovable, I got the sense that it is here that Landa begins to hatch his endgame plan. This is one of the many question marks that QT strategically inserted to keep the audience guessing. Like its characters, the film is not what it appears to be: it is a highly intellectual movie masquerading as an exploitive revenge fantasy.

One of my main criticisms of the movie is QT's signature use of dialog. In his earlier works, like ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", QT used dialog to humanize the characters. Even hit men make small talk about the same mundane stuff the rest of us do. In ""Inglourious Basterds"", however, this dialog becomes an implausible parody of itself. Even worse, it makes the movie drag when it shouldn't. So, to borrow a line from the movie, we end up waiting for the creame...and waiting, and waiting, and waiting. Perhaps the worst offender is the scene where the SS officer plays the card game with the Basterds in tavern. Perhaps the point was to show that SS officers may be annoying dolts, but also have a surprising familiarity with American films? In this regard, QT has to stop trying to be too clever when crafting his dialog--otherwise, he risks boring his fans to death.",1250899200,3,2472,4.693548387096774
3955274,4,B002MZZMRM,"Quentin Tarantino, taking inspiration from the 1978 Italian film ""Inglorious Bastards"", ""INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS"" (now renamed ""Basterds"") is the latest installment from the acclaimed director. ""Inglourious Basterds"" isn't just a war film, it is a war film with the Tarantino signature that features stupendous dialogue, incredibly opaque plotting, an anarchistic soundtrack (even worms in a David Bowie song from ""Cat People""), accompanied by characters that are colorful that are almost mythic in nature. The film is not a history lesson in World War Two, but rather a fantasy war picture that bends the staples of cinema by having a plot executed with serenity, it is methodical and the results are quite excellent, having a feel of ""Spaghetti Westerns"" and the usual Tarantino sensibilities. One thing I like about Tarantino, h e doesn't adjust to his viewers, but his viewers just adjust to him, he never compromises his visionary ambitions---win, lose or draw.

Once Upon a time in Nazi-occupied France (the film's first chapter opens as such), Lt. Aldo Raine (played by Brad Pitt) has assembled a small group of Jewish-Americans, their main objective; to kill as many Godless Nazis as they can. Called ""The Basterds"" they work in the country, often ambushing small groups of German soldiers, gather Intel and have made quite a feared reputation among the Nazi war machine. They must work with a British double agent named Bridget Von Haamersmark (Diane Kruger) who has intelligence on a Third Reich film feature that is to take place in the La Gamarr Theater located at a remote area in Paris. Fate deals an ironic hand as the theater is owned by Shoshanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent) a young Jewish girl who watched her family get massacred at the hands of Nazi Col. Landa (superbly acted by Christoph Waltz) who is better known as the ""Jew Hunter"". Now the movie premiere is set to be attended by top Nazi officials, including Adolf Hitler (Martin Wuttke), Raine and his company must do what they can to kill the Fuhrer himself...will they succeed?

Tarantino have paid homage to Asian films in ""Kill Bill"", Blaxsploitation in ""Jackie Brown"", gangster movies in ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"", grind house in ""Death Proof""; ""Inglourius Basterds"" may well be his homage to foreign movies as he plays around with subtitles and cinematic set pieces, while giving the Nazis their due. ""Basterds"" is divided into 5 chapters that give it an episodic atmosphere with the usual fragmented style. Tarantino has a knack for cinematic brilliance, using the wartime palette; Tarantino utilizes certain restrained colors and frames his shots quite efficiently. Most of Tarantino's films are dialogue-rich and ""Basterds"" is no different. The conversations between the victims and the Nazis can get very edgy, while at the same time keeping a dark, predatory, sinister sense of humor on more than one occasion. Tarantino plays with accents and sharp-tongued dialogue to deliver the film's appeal with its language that delivers the dialogue in English, French and German.

""Basterds"" has a collection of flamboyant characters. Pitt as Aldo Raine nicknamed ""Aldo the Apache"" sports a moustache, has a raspy Tennessee drawl and a nasty scar on his throat shows him as someone who had experienced a harrowing past or perhaps a shady one. Aldo doesn't really get that much development, but the script works the way it is. It gives our ""Basterds"" a sense of mystery; all we know is the fact that these men are hell-bent on killing Nazis. They do so in the ala-""Apache"" manner, scalping German soldiers to instill fear and intimidation. Aldo's pack is made up of other colorful characters, led by ""Bear Jew"" Donny Donnowitz (played by Eli Roth) who bashes Nazi skulls with a baseball bat and a man convicted of killing several Nazi officers called Sgt. Hugo Stieglitz (Til Schweiger) who seemed to be the ""Shaft"" guy of the Basterds"".

Surprisingly, the film isn't mainly about the Basterds at all; the screenplay is more about the victims of the holocaust and a cry for justice. The first chapter embodies the savagery of the Third Reich; the character of Shoshanna Dreyfus represents the horrors experienced by the Jews and I thought that her character gave the plot its heart and main spirit. Sure, it is easy to sympathize with her character but her relationship with a smitten Nazi private (played by Daniel Bruhl) is major catalyst for the film's last acts. Brad Pitt's ""Aldo the Apache"" is matched by a very edgy character in the form of ""Jew Hunter"" Col. Hans Landa. He matches Aldo's charisma with a sort of a predatory personality that lures his victims in with intimidating, long conversations into agreeing with him with a crude smile until such time as he can turn the tables on them. In this film, Landa embodies the evil, cruelty and savagery of Hitler's Reich, Landa is soulless, black heart of the third Reich. In many ways, I thought Christoph Waltz, a multi-lingual actor had stolen the show; the actor's presence onscreen exhibited an awesome presence with a bit of an unease about him. You just have to admire his cunning; Landa proves to be as sly as Aldo and may well be just as merciless. I may go as far as to say that ""Basterds"" is a huge success because of his character. There are also quick cameos by Mike Myers, a Samuel L. Jackson narration, and even a vocal surprise by Harvey Keitel.

""Inglouroius Basterds"" plays literary, depending on its characters that are all vying for personal satisfaction set in violent manner. Yes, the film may prove to be a bit of a dozy compared to ""Kill Bill"" but Tarantino does manage to inject some blood and gore into the mix. The pay off is very dark and enveloped in irony as Tarantino sends the Nazis into bloody murder in a propaganda with a gritty firefight. Tarantino seemed very much in love with tales of irony, messed up heroic goals and touches of poetic justice.

There is nothing more fun in watching a film that gives Nazis their comeuppance. ""Inglourious Basterds"" will not prove to be Tarantino's best film but it does make a perfect fit to Tarantino's line of `funky' genre-busting filmography. He makes a good case of amendment without giving controversy and avoids a disrespectful offense to the face of history. It is a fantastical piece of wish fulfillment--Tarantino remains as the man with cool `snappy`banter and bold ideas.

Highly Recommended! [4  Stars]",1250899200,3,6433,4.95
3955275,4,B002MZZMRM,"Over ten years in the making, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS hits the big screen with all sorts of hype.  This film received a 16 minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival.  Actor Chris Waltz won a Best Actor award at that festival too.  Plus Director Tarantino himself considers this his magnum opus.  PULP FICTION is my all-time favorite movie, so needless to say I had all sorts of lofty expectations heading into this one.

The title was inspired by the '78 cult classic, but this is by no means a remake.  Quentin describes this as ""a spaghetti western with WWII iconography"".  It takes place shortly after D-Day.

""We're in the business of killing Nazis.  And business is good.""  Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) leads a roughneck group of American-Jewish soldiers hellbent on striking fear in the hearts of the German soldiers trespassing on French soil.
There also is another story that runs parallel with this premise--A young Jewish woman named Shosanna seeks revenge against the Nazis after her family was slaughtered.

Tarantino's stamp is all over this one.  It is indeed a genre-blending thrill ride with scenes of graphic violence, but surprisingly the brutality is actually toned down.  It has obscure refences to things/people in film that QT loves, some of which I'm sure I didn't catch.  There are lots of idioms in pop culture, and for once Tarantino fits them all in nicely without feeling forced.
_____________________________________________________________

Now, there is alot to love about this movie, but I am going to be a bit critical.  Seriously, that's a shock coming from me, I pretty much worship every film Tarantino has ever done.  Here is what I didn't completely love about I.B.

1. PACING
I have never been even slightly bored during any of Q's previous work.  That includes DEATH PROOF, which many people considered it ""too talky"".  This film has quite a bit of dialogue, so take that into consideration.  Plus the two story lines get a little convoluted.  I would have loved for this movie to concentrate solely on the Basterd's and had more Nazi scalping scenes.

2. SAMUEL JACKSON
I love Sammy J immensely, but didn't feel his narration was necessary.

3. MIKE MYERS
He actually can act, but I couldn't help but see Austin Powers/Dr. Evil when he was on screen.

4. STORYBOARDS
His use of throwing up the CHAPTER board introductions was not needed.  It actually prevents you from getting immersed in the story.

5. CHARACTERS
None of the characters were developed as much as I would have liked either, largely because of the broad story.  I loved Eli Roth's role as THE BEAR JEW, but he didn't see enough screen time.  Neither did the amazing Waltz as THE JEW HUNTER, nor Pitt as Aldo.

I don't mean to sound too critical of INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS.  I really did enjoy it.  It actually is a poignant tale of guilt, morality, hatred, evil, and revenge.  It might just be Tarantino's most critically acclaimed movie ever.  Still, this is his first movie that didn't totally leave me stunned when I left the theater.",1250899200,2,3042,4.8654970760233915
3955276,4,B002MZZMRM,"Weather you like him or not, you have to admit Quentin Taretino has a big mouf.  His cockie wisecracks and verbal machinegun filled with pop-referential bullets can make him annoying to the point of manslaughter, but his movies aren't something to look down upon.  A good weight of his filmografy is filled with charm, brilliant writing, and established characters, they're near-classics.  He did stumble with ""Deathproof"", which is simply two hours of exposition and only two sequential payofs; that was only a misstep, as the filmmaker manage to get back on his feet with his latest spaghetti wartime parade, ""Inglourious Basterds.""  It's nothing short of what I xpect from the guy, a gloryhole of long-talks and critical violence.

Amusingly, yet not entirely surprized, for a film about The Basterds, a good chunk of the 2 1/2 hours has little to do with the skin-scraping, head-bashing club.  The first chapter has a French family getting an unexpected visit from the SS, when the father gets into a heated discussion with a kommendant---

Im gonna have to interrupt my own review for a moment to say that Hans Landa has to be one of the best karacters I've seen in films.  Unofficially called ""The Jew Killer"", he's the one evil soljer I can never hate; I can hate what he represents, but I admire what he does because he's so pontificating with his job.  He's very punctual with his methods, leaving no thread undiscovered to make him take the furst strike.  The guy doesn't just tell you you're caught, he rubs it in your face with your own soap, yet does it in the most humble wey possible.  As much as I like Brad Pitt's role, the actor who played Hans Landa won my hart with his eccentric performance.

---anyway, which circomestances eventually turns things sour on the father.  The third chapter is a continuation of the preloode chapter, which has a female character running a movie theater before an obnoxious actor/Nazi soldier trying to woo her heart.  A series of forced situations led to using her theater as a premiere party for the high-ranks of the SS, include You-Know-Who himself, thus setting up her ultimate revenge skeme.  Five chapters tie the whole ceries of unrelated plot and characters together (the chapter format isn't exactly first for the director), yet the chapters I get to see The Basterds are brief; although, with what little time they had, their tenasidies were iconic.

When it comes to The Basterds, the leader hogs up all the gloury.  Brad Pitt plays the leader of the anti-Nazi group, and he's such an interesting in that even though he delivers the goods, he sure don't talk the goods as I've seen some hilarious scenes when his accent worked against him.  He was the showstealer, in fact, he's probably the only show around.  Sure, there was Eli Roth playing a bat-wielding murdertown of the gang, but the rest of the squad don't have any distanctive personalities; I'm disappointed in the Jerman Basterd, he was viewed as a serious threat to the SS, yet he only had one moment to shine, and it wasn't much of a shiner.  I do like the tradition Quentin touch of the film, like the opening credits, the nice use of license songs (mainly by Ennio Morricone), and its narrations with Samuel L. Jackson, although the narration parts were very rere and otherwise pretty irrelevant.

From what I heard, the movie has bin receeving the cold shoulder from many critics in the past; I didn't read their reviews, so I can't say I know exactly what was their deal.  It might be the fact that the movie isn't historically accurate, and certainly by the end of the film, Historical Accuracy is to this movie as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marcellus-is-to-Zed/dp/1558908242/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marcellus is to Zed</a>.  However, I don't think Quentin is going four the accurate angle and is doing his usual homage to camp bravado of yesterdecade, and this is a direction most critics should know about already.  Who knows, maybe it's the Mike Myers kameo.

That being said, I do have sum complaints.  Pacing doesn't seem to work in the director's favor, as there was a lot of down time with characturs exchanging lines before any real action occurs.  Yea, I'm compleining about too much dialog in a Tarateno movie (that's like compleining about a snake for shedding its own skin), but some scenes didn't have to extent in Taratinoisms.  The bar sequence is a good example, the majority of the sequence has people joking around and playing games before they imitated ""Resevoir Dogs""; plus, the movie already has one clever astute German soldat, having a second clever astute German soldat for this sequence is redundant.  Having long-term conversations is fine and dandy in the Roger Avery era, but they add a lot of build-up, and when the film adds too much build-up, it gnumbs the emotional response of the payoff (something Quentin should learn from his last film).  Still, the film brakes the flow with eclectic brutality plenty of times that it doesn't drag.

""Inglourious Basterds"" is, if nothing else, a total farse, but whether it's a good or bad thing depends sorly on you.  Do you care that it's historically-raped, tragedy is overshadowed by machismo action, and everyone talks more about films like King Kong than the present sichuation?  No?  Then sit back, grab a popkorn, and expect to laugh and laud with the brutal antics.",1250899200,,5426,4.926373626373627
3955277,3,B002MZZMRM,"After allowing the film to settle in, I chose to give it the Amazon three star rating, meaning the film was OK. Apparently, Tarantino had spent close to a decade developing the script, hoping it would become his ""crowning glory"". He used ""Guns of Navarone"", ""The Dirty Dozen"", and other war movies and spaghetti westerns as his inspiration. Despite ""Inglourious Basterds"" being to some degree entertaining, I believe Tarantino failed to create the masterpiece for which he had hoped.

Unlike what previews suggest, the film is NOT about the team of ""Inglorious Bastards"", Jewish GI's who scalp their way thru German ranks in occupied France, wreaking havoc and demoralizing German soldiers. In fact, we learn little about the individual members of the pack. Brad Pitt's screen time as their boss, southern redneck Lt Aldo Raine, is limited. The Basterds Team are simply one of the building blocks of a story arc in which Tarantino gets to rewrite WWII history. The incredulous end that the writer dishes out to Hitler makes it obvious ""Inglourious Basterds"" is NOT a war film, but rather a Tarantino version of one. The typical ""Tarantino"" violence is there, of course, even though, oddly, it does not disturb as much. After all, the real violence of WWII was far worse, making the film appear almost restrained.

I would say the biggest sin of the film is in its editing. At 2.5 hours long (not including previews), you have to wonder about the wisdom of treating viewers to a long scene involving cream being scooped out onto strudel... It looked yummy, and made me want to leave the theater immediately and head to the local bakery for a slice of Vienna Tort... but did nothing to further the action.

The shining star of the film is undoubtedly Christoph Waltz, an Austrian actor with a career spanning over three decades, as the brilliant, sociopathic and at least a little mad Col. Hans Landa. He steals every scene he is in (whether speaking English, German, French or Italian) and, in my opinion, makes the film. There are rumours of an Oscar nomination. He deserves one. Apparently, the role had almost gone to Leonardo DeCaprio. I cannot even imagine the loss this would have meant for the film... Mr Waltz makes ""Inglourious Basterds"" worth seeing.

Before you do, please be ready to read subtitles. At least 50% of the dialogue is subtitled due to vast slabs of it being in German, French and Italian (we get to hear Diane Kruger speaking her native tongue). This is not another ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Reservoire Dogs"", but... the story entertains nonetheless. Just not as much.",1250812800,7,2586,4.857142857142857

Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"" is not the film I was expecting.  It's not even the film I wanted, to tell you the truth.  But no director defies expectations so consistently nor delivers more spectacularly in the modern age of cinema and so still had one hell of a time anyways.  And if the reaction of the audience I saw it with is any indication, so will everyone else; disregarding, of course, the ever-present cinematic malcontents who continue to rush to midnight premiere screenings of every single Tarantino film in spite of their professed hatred for his work.  Gotta love those guys.  Simply and predictably put, this is a WWII film like no other and is you typical QT mishmash of genres, obscure references and homages, and tributes to all the things the eccentric director himself likes; things like ladies' feet and German silent films.  And contrary to what one might assume, this is not a remake of the WWII cult classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Inglorious-Bastards/dp/B00140PKEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Inglorious Bastards</a>.  No topless machine-gun toting Nazi girls for you.  Sorry.

Now, if there is one thing that never, ever goes out of style, it's killing Nazis.  Even in this politically correct age, few will complain about anything that is said about or done to a Nazi no matter how cruel and unusual.  They are the one group we can all agree can never truly get everything they deserve as far as abuse goes.  Tarantino took this opportunity to take this premise to a comical extreme.  I can honestly say I've never seen a brutal and explicit baseball bat beating applauded quite so enthusiastically or blatant nationalist slurs laughed at so heartily.  That is both the magic of Tarantino's unique cinematic styling and the legacy of the Holocaust put together in one cathartic release over 2 1/2 hours of film that actually leave you wanting more.  Originally, Tarantino wanted this story to be a miniseries and that tidbit sheds a lot of light on the inadequacies of this film.  The Nazi-hunters known as The Basterds play a much smaller role in the story then I would have liked and there is a lot less violence then one would think a film about a Jewish unit of Nazi-killers would have. The tales of a Jewish girl who escaped the SS years ago and hid in Paris as a theater owner and a German actress working against her own country take up much screen time, but are fascinating in their own right.  Tarantino's dialogue is as unmistakable and captivating as ever.  Not only is most of the film simple dialogue, but I'd estimate about 2/3 of it is not in even in English.  Taking place in German-occupied France, most of the characters speak French and German....and maybe a little Italian [snicker].  Coupled with the persistent references to old-school German cinema, this is QT foisting his personal cinematic preferences on the audience once again.  Love it when he does that.

So the pacing isn't quite what it should be and the multiple plot threads leave surprisingly little time for the amount of carnage I was hoping for.  Big deal.  Tarantino knows how to shoot his actors for maximum coolness, build suspense while creating a genuine flow and menace to each conversation even as he works his black comedic magic, and most of all his legendary capacity for maximizing his actor's performances in on display here as well.  Brad Pitt is hilarious with his exaggerated Tennessee drawl and matter-of-fact delivery.  But though he is the biggest name and personality on the cast, this movie is not about him.  M&eacute;lanie Laurent is both lovely, sympathetic, convincing, and in the end even a little demonic as Shosanna, the Jewish escapee who runs the Paris cinema where the Third Reich wishes to premiere their latest and greatest propaganda film.  Christoph Waltz is simply amazing as the SS's ""Jew Hunter"" and exudes a calculating malevolent friendliness that makes it impossible to look away when he's onscreen.  Maybe a little too much time is spent watching these characters pontificate at length with one another, but considering there is only one source for this particular brand of stylized storytelling, I'm not complaining too loudly.  The occasional touches of ridiculous humor (nice pipe, dude) kept me on my toes if nothing else.

There are two shots near the end of ""Inglourious Basterds"" that are so awe-inspiring and cool that they would be worth the 2 1/2 hour wait by themselves.  I wish I could describe them to you without spoilers.  Let me just quote the scene itself and say ""This is the face of Jewish vengeance!""  I got major goosebumps. If you thought Death Proof was dull and stupid, walk on by.  This is not a wall-to-wall gorefest and it's not exactly going to please WWII historians either.  And if you're German...well, I hope you're very comfortable with yourself and have a good sense of humor about this stuff.  This movie is about quirky and deliberately -paced dialogue and other things that the part of you that ran to see ""Transformers"" and ""GI Joe"" aren't going to appreciate much.  This movie is not a masterpiece by any stretch, but it's still a rewarding film for the patient and has plenty of that QT unpredictability punctuated with moments of sheer insanity.  Enjoy it or unleash your trollish flames upon this reviewer.  Either will make me very happy.

3955279,5,B002MZZMRM,"What can I say about Inglourious Basterds? Unique, inventive, smart writing and excellent acting throughout are what first comes to mind when thinking about the film I just got back from seeing. Be warned, there is a lot of talking (the first scene is a 20 minute conversation), even for a Tarantino flick, but the dialogue is excellent and the characters are memorable. The only negative is that some scenes do drag just a little, but not enough to bore the life out of you. There are also some well crafted action scenes that are brutal, though they played a much more minor role than I expected.

Brad Pitt turns in a fine performance and provides most of the comedic moments. Just don't expect him to be on the screen all the time. Unlike what you see in the trailers, he and his ""Basterds"" play supporting roles. There is no real leading role here, but one does take a commanding presence over all the rest. New to many people who will be watching this movie, Christoph Waltz delivers a performance to remember and will at minimum get nominated for an Oscar. He is clever, charming, slimy, unpredictable and evil. Expertly acted evil dudes seem to be cleaning up the supporting actor categories every year now. Javier Bardem won it for No Country for Old Men in 2007 and the late Heath Ledger did the same for the The Dark Knight in 2008. Why break tradition this year, especially given the complexity of Waltz's acting here. He already won the Cannes Film Festival Best Actor award. The two main female actresses, Melanie Laurent (nomination worthy) and Diane Kruger, were both captivating and added the right elements this film needed. In fact, every person on screen seemed right for the role they were given. Well, horror director and buddy of Tarantino, Eli Roth, was a little off at times, but thankfully he has a smaller role and lets his baseball bat do most of the talking for him.

Don't expect any historical accuracy, just get ready for a wild fantasy WWII movie that only Tarantino can pull off. His signature music and song selection was also some of his best. One thing is for sure, Quentin Tarantino is back on top in a BIG way.

3955280,5,B002MZZMRM,"Quentin Tarantino has taken his anti-Nazi fantasy to new heights with this engrossing dark comedy/fantasy that has ""The Basterds"" (led by BRAD PITT) out for Nazi scalps to add to an ever growing collection. But first and foremost, he has constructed a screenplay that never lets up veering between tension and laughter, and gives several members of his cast a chance at Oscar-winning performances.

Foremost among these is CHRISTOPH WALTZ who waltzes off with all of his scenes by playing the ""Jew Hunter"" with subtle bits of characterization that remind me of a young Conrad Veidt at the height of his powers. He never misses an opportunity to give greater depth to his character's personality quirks and sudden changes of mood that always heighten the tension. The farmhouse scene that starts the story rolling is one of the greatest pieces of sustained suspense I've ever seen any director pull, even Hitchcock.

My only quibble with the film, in fact, would be the extended bar scene in which a clever plot to trap some Nazi officers goes awry. The director could have tightened the whole sequence with a cut of some ten or more minutes.

But who's going to voice complaints when the film is fiendishly clever from start to finish, and so well executed that you leave the theater after being spellbound for the duration of the lengthy story. All of the performances surrounding BRAD PITT and CHRISTOPH WALTZ are pitch perfect and Pitt himself is mighty amusing as the Southern lieutenant who likes to cut Swastikas into the skulls of his German foes.

DENIS MENOCHET is superb as the farmer in the film's opening scene, matching the convincing performance of CHRISTOPH WALTZ every step of the way. Not enough praise can be said for the performances Tarantino has gotten from his entire cast and that includes MELANIE LAURENT who has a key role as the only woman who manages to escape the massacre that opens the film. Her interaction with a German officer (DANIEL BRUHL) who is attracted by her is a fascinating one, especially since she has no intention of succumbing to his courteous flirtations.

This is definitely putting Tarantino's best foot forward--and if it doesn't end up with several Oscar nominations in both acting and technical categories, I'll be very surprised.

Just brilliant.",1250812800,3,2299,4.94300518134715
3955281,5,B002MZZMRM,"Quentin Tarantino has done it again...and this may very well be his finest work.  I went to the 9:30 a.m. premiere of ""Inglorious Basterds"" this morning and I have nothing to say other than QT is a genius in filmmaking.  Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz and Melanie Laurent (among many others) turn in academy-consideration performances in this complete twist on war films.  Christoph Waltz better receive an academy nomination for his role as Col. Hans Landa...just superb. I don't want to give away a thing, so all I can say is that if you are a Tarantino fan, this one won't disappoint you.  He has mastered such films as ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Jackie Brown"", ""Kill Bill"" (both movies), ""Death Proof"", ""True Romance"", ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", and ""Curdled"".  He wrote and directed ""Inglorious Basterds"".  A solid 10...no hesitation.  The master of revenge has outdone himself.  Long live the king!",1250812800,,904,5.02013422818792
3955282,5,B002MZZMRM,"I've discovered in writing reviews that they tend to actually write themselves. Some reviews demand that a synopsis, others to the themes and style of the movie being reviewed. In either case you're trying to give the reader a sense of the movie and whether it's something they want to see or not. Since Pulp Fiction Quentin Tarantino's movies have so intricately weaved that a synopsis would lead to a lengthy review, and in the case of Inglourius Basterds it's best to see the movie and let all the elements reveal themselves.

As you've seen on the commercial about Inglourious Basterds, it's about a squad of Jewish American soldiers behind enemy lines led by Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine and their mission is to kill ""Natzis.""  There is more to the plot, it also revolves around a Jewish woman Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) who escapes the clutches of German Col. Landa (Christoph Waltz) who is in charge of German occupied France.

Inglourious Basterds reveals the mature artist in Tarantino. The opening scene is confidently filmed letting the characters talk, as we learn just who Col. Landa is, and despite his civilized and cultured demeanor he is a cunning and devious officer committed to carrying out his orders, hunting down Jews. In other parts of the movie when Shosanna comes face to face to with Col. Landa Tarantino lets the camera rest on her and her struggle to remain calm as the Colonel makes small talk with Joseph Goebbels.

While all the action takes place in war time France and Germany, this movie may be more about movies than war. The characters are self-consciously aware of movies. Pitt and his band watch a German officer beaten to death with a bat with the stated reason that it's the closest they get to seeing a movie these days. Shosanna is the owner of a movie theatre in Paris and her plan revolves around her knowledge of film. So, is Tarantino just aware of the part movie's played in the lives of people of the war time era? Or is he making a statement that making movies is a war? And a nasty one at that.

Tarantino plays with his usual palette of colors violence, humor, crisp dialogue, and music and mixes all of them that create new colors and shocking results that only Tarantino can pull off. There is violence, you will see people scalped, beaten to death, and shot to pieces, but it is war. Tarantino's violence has always seemed stylized to me, not cartoonish, maybe hyper-real is a better to describe it.  The violence looks like it could be real but there is an element that lets you realize the violence is fictional without pulling you out of the movie. And there's Tarantino's dark humor that if were in different circumstances or situations we might not ordinarily laugh at, but Tarantino bends the situation just enough for a dark humor to materialize and that's mostly because of the dialogue Tarantino is noted for. If the movie hadn't had me already, by the time David Bowie's song Cat People (Putting Out The Fire, from the movie Cat People) hit the soundtrack, it would've captured me right there.

At the end of the movie Pitt's character comments as Tarantino's surrogate ""this just may be my masterpiece."" I think he just might be right.",1250812800,9,3200,4.693404634581105
3955283,5,B002MZZMRM,"As a rabid fan of Tarantino (yes, I even loved Deathproof) I find I always look forward to any new effort by the director.  With Inglourious Basterds Tarantino yet again conveys an undying affection for any and all things cinema.  While the movie is a man on a mission film it is also a resistance movie and an ode to film.  It's also surprisingly funny and at times overwhelmingly violent and while those elements are trademark Tarantino, here he's mastered his form.

Many people complained about the ""talkiness"" of Deathproof and in Inglourious Basterds QT has limited the verbage to a more economical and efficient pace.  This baby moves, and at nearly two and a half hours in length, that is quite an accomplishment.  Absolutely zero filler, fat, or fastidiousness.  It is quite a thing to realize you've watched a movie that lasts this long and, when it ends, you find yourself wanting more.  If there are any complaints to be made they would have to be that we don't spend merely as much time with the Basterds as the title of the film would imply.  But the time spent is all the better for it.

I don't think enough can be said about Christoph Waltz's Col. Hans Landa.  Nicknamed ""The Jew Hunter"" the man is the embodiment of evil.  In one moment he's charming, the next he is unpent rage.  It's an altogether captivating performance, both verbose and vile.  While Hitler will always be the face of the Nazi regime it's the very real people like Landa that were the tools that carried out the atrocities of the holocaust.  The best way to describe the character is Sherlock Holmes spawned by the devil.  A detective with an unflinching eye and an uncaring heart.  Christoph Waltz will most likely earn many an award for his performance and Oscar buzz has been flying since Cannes.  Expect that buzz to get louder.

Brad Pitt as Aldo Raine also turns in a fine performance as the rough and tumble leader of the Basterds who really, really, really wants his Nazi scalps.

Eli Roth was a big ol' question mark for me going in to this movie as his character in Deathproof was annoying (although admittedly that was the point) but as Donny Donowitz (aka. The Bear Jew) he steals the scenes he's in.  While I've never been a fan of Roth's directing acumen (except for the surprising as hell Hostel 2) I will concede that he can indeed, act.

The last real standout in the Basterds lineup was Til Schweiger as Stiglitz (the character with the best introduction in the whole movie), a German turned Nazi killer on his own accord.

But the movie is not all about the Basterds.

Melanie Laurent as Shosanna, the Jewish girl now running her own movie theater in Paris, has a history with Col. Landa and her own plot to rid the world of as many Nazis as she can.  Expect to see more of her in the future.

Diane Kruger plays Bridget Von Hammersmark, the double agent movie star.  Let's just say there's a reason she played Helen of Troy.

Overall Inglourious Basterds is one of the best moviegoing experiences I've had in 2009.  If you've liked Quentin Tarantino's films in the past you'll most likely love this movie.  Besides, any film where the sole impetus is the killing and terrorizing of Nazis is aces in my book.",1250812800,3,3216,4.571678321678322
3955284,4,B002MZZMRM,"""You haven't seen war until you've seen it through the eyes of Quentin Tarantino."" The tagline for Inglourious Basterds is certainly fitting, as Quentin Tarantino's take on the battles waged during World War II is definitely unlike anything you've ever seen. Sadly, when you disrupt the events and ideas many know as being historically accurate, you add even one more concept that works against the already arduous struggle for the suspension of disbelief. But it wouldn't be Tarantino without these brazen storytelling techniques, and fans of his elaborate style of moviemaking will find plenty to love with the ample servings of clever dialogue, spatterings of brutal violence, and a revenge story built for a truly explosive conclusion.

Once upon a time in Nazi occupied France, young Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent) witnesses the slaughter of her family by Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz). Narrowly escaping with her life, she plots her revenge several years later when German war hero Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) takes a rapid interest in her and arranges an illustrious movie premiere at the theater she now runs. With the promise of every major Nazi officer in attendance, the event catches the attention of the ""Basterds"", a group of Jewish-American guerilla soldiers led by the ruthless Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt). As the relentless executioners advance and the conspiring young girl's plans are set in motion, their paths will cross for a fateful evening that will shake the very annals of history.

Tarantino's style of filmmaking hasn't changed much between his last few films; fortunately he has a fairly unique approach to storytelling that works well, so the repetition is forgivable. Inglourious Basterds is typical Tarantino: drawn out, musing, thought-provoking and witty dialogue, an excessive attention to detail, chapters and flashing character name/title notifications, and a sarcastic, darkly humorous angle on over-the-top violence. ""The Germans will be sickened by us!"" yells fanatical, compassionless leader Raine. Some scenes drag noticeably with beefed up dialogue that never quite bores, but the culmination of events, the crossing paths of characters, and the outrageous climax more than makes up for the extra time Tarantino has the audience seated in a theater chair. It's unexpected, historically inaccurate, and no-holds-barred entertaining. And Christoph Waltz turns in an absolutely show-stealing performance as the calculating villain.

A slow-motion zap to the senses, with the Basterds turning the tables on history and the Nazis, Tarantino's obvious love of manipulation and movies finds its way into this offbeat war picture, along with in-depth conversations on Linder vs. Chaplin, strudels, milk and the expected racial remarks. He demonstrates his ability to toy with the audience through great musical selections, uneasy laughs to break up tension, a proficient arrangement of coincidences, and extreme anticipation - at times the suspense is delightfully overbearing. Considering Tarantino's sizable pop culture grasp on cinephiles and teenagers everywhere, it's safe to assume that for years to come people will be misspelling ""inglorious"" and ""bastards"" and will be unable to accurately retell key events of World War II.

3955285,2,B002MZZMRM,"In a small French village, a Jewish refugee named Shoshanna escapes the massacre of her family at the hands of a group of Nazi soldiers, led by the egomaniacal Col. Hans Landa.

In the United States, grizzled army commander Lt. Aldo Raine prepares to take a secret squad of Jewish soldiers - codenamed the ""Basterds"" - behind enemy lines, to spread fear amongst the German army and thin the Nazi ranks on a ground level.

In Berlin, Hitler is plagued by reports of these ""Basterds"", but is also preoccupied with the deeds of young soldier Frederick Zoller, whose escapades in a small village in Italy have given the Nazi war machine a much-needed shot of pride. Zoller, for his part, is smitten with the charms of Mlle. Mimieux, the young and pretty owner of a parisian Cinema.

How Tarantino combines these plot threads into a story arc is best left to him, so I won't write any spoilers, suffice it to say that in my opinion, ""Inglorious Basterds"" is worth watching, but sadly isn't as worthwhile as Tarantino's earlier releases.

Performace-wise there are four standouts: Michael Fassbender is assured and confident as suave British Lt. Archie Hicox, Diane Kruger's reading of German actress Bridget Von Hammersmark is authentic and satisfying, Mlanie Laurent is an excellent, wisely-underplayed Shosanna Dreyfuss, and Christoph Waltz absolutely shines as the oddly poetic Nazi Col. Hans Landa.

The Basterds themselves are, surprisingly, not on the screen for vast stretches of time, and none of them gives a particularly memorable performance, besides Pitt: but memorable is a subjective term, and for my money, Pitt's faux-grizzled tongue-in-cheek portrayal of Aldo Raine is a fatal mistake: it's memorable because it's Brad Pitt, in a Tarantino picture, but beyond that it's childish and pretentious. Pitt's not got the chops to carry this role off, and because of this, the whole Good Guys side of the movie is lent a decidedly silly air.

Silliness is a theme that runs through the movie: the graphic violence in ""Inglorious Basterds"" is nowhere nearly as gruesome or as vicariously satisfying as ""Kill Bill"" or ""Reservoir Dogs"" - a shame, since Tarantino's dealing with an exaggerated view of one of the most violent periods of human history. Sure, there's blood, there's guts - but there's not a whole lot of it, and what's there is more B-movie than B-movie Homage.

Direction is similarly underdone: after the prolonged introductory scenes in a French farmhouse (saved only by the magnetic performance of Waltz, and the tiny-but-excellent cameo of Denis Menochet) the usual Tarantino ""touches"" are trotted out - weird credits, incongruous music, Samuel L. Jackson, disruptive backstories - but they're rolled off a production line along with a lot of the rest of this movie, as though someone had a quota of Tarantinisms to fill. These idiosyncrasies are presented so baldly and flatly that they quickly become clichs,  and shove the war-on-terror subtext into painfully obvious relief.

Overall, for me, ""Inglorious Basterds"" lacks the finesse of Tarantino's earlier work. There was a real potential for character coolness, like the Bride, Vincent Vega, Jackie Brown or Stuntman Mike, but by and large it's unexplored in favor of OTT stereotypes or underused roles. The direction's not what it's been in the past, and the violence, when it's present, is just a bit amateurish. See it in the cinema, it needs a big screen, and Waltz, Fassbender, Kruger and Laurent's performances are worth the price of admission - just be aware there's not enough of them to cover over the bad points.",1250380800,28,3598,5.0641891891891895
