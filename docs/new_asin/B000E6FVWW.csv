2499828,1,B000E6FVWW,"Thanks for the warning about the George Benson DVD.  This one sounds like another ""If I sh** on a DVD, people will buy it because I'm a star.""  Sorry George, being a star doesn't absolve you from the responsibilty work that is required to present an organized, logical presentation for STUDENTS.  Too many of you guys who are ""Stars"" think that just showing up to a video taping, and jamming a little constitues an instructional video.  What it does constitute is abuse of your position.  Put the work in to create a genuine educational tool, and all will repect it. Remember teaching is a separate skill from playing.  As in the engineeing and math worlds, great engineers and mathematicians frequently make lousy teachers.  Teaching is a separate skill.",1160006400,5,755,4.8515625
2499829,3,B000E6FVWW,"first of all i'm a big fan of benson. he's one of the greatest guitar players/musicians of our time. it's always good to hear benson talk about music and listen to him play, and that's exactly what you'll get from this video. the video is done in his house and he's very relaxed. this will offer you something different from his other live performance videos. i have to emphasize that it's NOT an instructional video although he touches on a few harmony ideas very quick.

now, i need to make some complaints about the production of this video. benson is a master musician, not an instructor or video producer. it was hot licks' job to first set the purpose of this video, carefully plan and execute it. although it is always good to see benson, i really didn't get much out of this video either in instructional or general info category. also, the overall sound/mixing of this video is marginal. for example, the guitar sounds thin and is not loud enough--they could've done better job mic'ing/mixing his guitar.

if you're a casual fan of benson, or a guitar student wanting to get some practical advice or guitar instruction, you can safely avoid this one.",1156550400,16,1159,4.676470588235294
2499830,5,B000E6FVWW,"This DVD was recorded  2005 at Bensons home in a very relaxed atmosphere..and I agree with the othere reviewers..it is not a pure instructional DVD. Benson plays whatever comes up in his mind there is no real "" agenda"" that he follows....but it does not matter at all....to me it is x mas time just sitting watching this legend play..he can do anything on the guitar.

I know that there is some guys out there that are  on equal level to Benson technically,,but I doubt that there is anyone that can play the guitar at this level with that GROOVE he has..it is just stunning.

As I am jazzguitarist myself my first thought was to just hang up the guitar and stop playing....but best thing is of course to let Benson inspire you .... anyway,,it will take some time before another player of Benson caliber will appear again",1156204800,14,821,4.527027027027027

2499832,5,B000E6FVWW,"What George talks about, and shows, is how to find sounds. There are no licks to copy, no scales to run, but it's excellent in showing how a musician finds sounds. The rest is up to you. And George is a hell of a nice guy and loves the guitar, and music, and that comes shining out. This will not teach you how to play, but will get you thinking. For intermediate++ players and Benson fans in general.",1147824000,10,401,4.153846153846154
2499833,5,B000E6FVWW,"This is a wonderful dvd. I have always been intriged by George Benson (the person and his view point with reference to the guitar). If you are expecting the usual instructional footage, think twice about getting this dvd, also the dvd would not suit beginners, its geared to intermediate and advanced players. I have most of the jazz guitar dvds out there, but this one is the best for me. Gearge simply sits down and plays and lets you in on the person that makes him such a wonderful entertainer. I learnt soo much from this lesson, he also has a great sense of humor. I started watching this dvd with guitar in hand, but a few minutes in, I forgot about the guitar and just absorbed the lesson. There is a lot in there to learn from, if you are the type that does not need to be shown stuff. You need to sit and pick out from this lesson what you want. Theres no denying Benson's mastery of the instrument. He is a beautiful person too. He is a natural entertainer. You can invite your family and friends to watch this dvd with you.

This type of dvd works for me, but it might not be everybody's cup of tea, cause if you are expecting to be hand held, or specific instructions, this dvd is not for you.

I concur with the other reviewer, and i wish all intruction dvds were like this one.

Thank you Hot Licks for putting this out (kudos to you).

I was disappointed though that you did not take the time out to put down the complete exercises in the booklet, i find myself trying to learn the rest from the dvd, well maybe thats a good thing.

Once again folks, George is a living legend, a must dvd for the serious player.

I had no choice but to put five stars, this dvd is easily ten stars, its off the chart.",1145836800,6,1717,4.203647416413374
2499834,5,B000E6FVWW,"this DVD is more like an intimate profile of George Benson as a solo jazz guitarist & as a veteran musician than a lesson... yet the video reveals just what an amazing guitarist / entertainer he is- without anyone playing with him... it makes me want Benson to do a solo CD featuring this aspect of his playing as he is simply phenomenal as a solo guitarist !!! whether he plays a Ramirez nylon string cutaway or his trademark Ibanez Benson model jazz guitar as he does in this video- he exhibits an awesome mastery of improvisation & Wes Mongomery-styled techniques of picking with his thumb & use of octaves as well as his unique ability to mirror whatever he sings with what he plays... simply awesome talent [without all the ""bells 'n' whistles"" of his band] demonstrating as simply as he can how he plays & how he feels the music that is his legacy... i think there are much better instructional videos to watch to learn jazz guitar technique BUT this intimate portrayl of George Benson's guitar playing & personality is a real gift of insight to any guitarist who appreciates grrreat jazz guitar & the overall talent of this stellar individual's charismatic personality... so, after watching this DVD, i am looking forward to a solo guitar CD from maestro Benson to take what he touches on to it's logical conclusion that will fully give to his listening audience what this product promises... a wonder-full finished product of jazz standards & his own creations that reveals what this guitarist is capable of alone without the distraction of other musicians- PLEASE GEORGE !!! GIVE US A SOLO CD !!! uhhh, make that a double... lol !!!!!!!!!!",1145577600,23,1648,4.7456445993031355
2499905,2,B000E6FVWW,"The problem with these teaching videos is the same: a great musician who records his chops so you can see how awesome he is, without teaching you a thing. If you understand the concepts he is talking about, then that means you have already attained ""the truth"" in jazz and you didn't need to watch this video in the first place. It's more like George is having inside jokes with the guitar players who ""get it"", and those of us who ""still don't get it"" are left confused and frustrated.
I put down my guitar ten minutes into the video because it was futile. I couldn't even hear myself play after seeing how George BREEZES through the neck whipping out one tasty jazz lick after another.
Don't kid yourself: it takes a lot of theoretical knowledge and long hours of practice before you can play like George. This video is nice to watch once or twice, but it won't help you.",1280016000,3,873,4.428571428571429
2499906,1,B000E6FVWW,"If want to see a great guitarist noodle in what is essentially an in home jam session then this is the DVD for you. If you want to learn jazz guitar you might as well take the case it comes in and put strings on it. There is no real content here related to teaching jazz at all (he does his version of ""Danny Boy"" for God's sake!)",1239926400,4,330,3.8676470588235294
2499907,2,B000E6FVWW,"Benson is a jaw-droppingly great guitarist on his records. Sadly, on this Hot Licks DVD, he noodles around for 90 minutes on two out-of-tune and toneless guitars without explaining what he is doing and why. As another reviewer wrote, some talented people are not necessarily good teachers. For excellent instruction, I recommend the DVDs by Joe Pass and Danny Gatton.",1237852800,5,367,5.133333333333334
2499908,5,B000E6FVWW,"This DVD is excellent in the way it focuses on Benson's hands while he is playing but a word of warning, this is not a 'put your finger here' type of video although it does come with a transcribed booklet that includes both TAB and standard notation. But if you have knowledge of various scales and modes you can really put what he is talking about to good use. When he shows you how he solos over changes using a 2, flat 2, 1 progression instead of a 2, 5, 1, it helps if you are able to comprehend what he's talking about. But if you DO understand and put George's suggestions to the test, you will be rewarded. The best part about it is that you will sound like YOU and not him. If you DO want to sound like him, he shows you some of the tricks he likes to employ (wait til you see the part about 'rattling the keys'). I love this DVD. As another reviewer noted, there is a problem with some of the guitars going out of tune but in all fairness these were NEW instruments, not George's personal ones. I think the idea was to set everything up so all George had to do was sit down and play. At any rate, this is a very good DVD and even if you aren't familiar with various scales and modes just watching him play by himself is well worth the price of this video. Thanks for sharing George.",1215907200,5,1291,4.086614173228346
2499909,3,B000E6FVWW,"I'm a big George Benson fan and this DVD really amazed me. Apparentely, he played everything on it without any preparation. My jaw just dropped. That said, it's a pity that he didn't even bother to tune his guitars before as he should. They are totally out of tune all the time. It could have been a much better DVD.",1212451200,2,316,4.283333333333333
2499910,5,B000E6FVWW,"The DVD cames in a pretty big case and it didn't fir at my mailbox. So, the postman return it to the post office and I'd to go to the post office and loose my time... One of the reasons that I choose Amazon is cause you don't have to move to shop something. I'm always busy and I hate drive to the post office and loose my precious time...",1207699200,,339,3.857142857142857
2499911,5,B000E6FVWW,"This is an awesome DVD that depicts George Benson in an informal environment.  He's an absolute master on the guitar.  HE IS THE GUITAR VERSION OF NAT KING COLE.  I enjoyed listening, watching, and learning what he had to offer.  I was even able to articulate his exercises (using the slow speed DVD feature) and they have helped me to become a better musician. If you love George Benson and want to incorporate his playing into yours, buy this DVD! If you can't pick up the exercises, then just watch it.  You will definitely be entertained.

2499912,5,B000E6FVWW,"I am very excited to let all of my fellow musicians know that this product is simply awesome! Before making my purchase, I read some of the reviews. Many were suprisingly very harsh, disrespecting, and critical of George and his aproach to his presentation. This is not guitar and theory 101, but George is getting some very valauble information to players who want to continue to grow and achieve. This DVD also has a slow-mo feature so that you can see in more detail some of Benson's unique techniques. My DVD player has a loop feature that combines into a very powerful learning tool that I would recomend to any accomplished player who is working to improve skills in jazz guitar.",1177113600,5,685,4.669421487603306
2499913,5,B000E6FVWW,"This is a great video from a great musician. Too often, music is over analyzed.  This is not the case with this video. All one need do is bring ears and eyes for one of the best ways to learn jazz guitar.",1172275200,,204,3.857142857142857
2499914,5,B000E6FVWW,"Fantastic! Beautiful! Amazing! Unfortunately I don't know many words in English but I want just to say that when I watch George in this new DVD, his wonderful playing and his warm and friendly approach just make me feel GOOD! Everybody knows George's great chops and technical ability........but it's very important, in my opinion, to notice the GREAT BIG HEART of this guy: he loves the guitar, he loves music and I'm sure that he loves people too!

Of course if you are a very young beginner, the songs in this DVD are a little difficult......but if you want to learn the correct jazz-blues articulation and the ""real essence"" of jazz guitar this DVD is a must.

I love the music, I love the Man......a warm thank-you to George from Italy.

8106504,5,B000E6FVWW,"It is not for everyone, but for me it was a break through. Why so many notes? If single note soloing is outlining the chord and that seems to be what Jazz is all about, then how else can you get all the colors you want from the cord in what maybe only two beats. I listened to parts of his singing and playing until I could finally, as he keeps coaxing you to do, hear it. Hear how the run actually sounds. Play it until you hear it or can't stand to hear it again. Maybe it  will slow down for you so you can make out  the notes of the  chords. Maybe it  won't, but  if it does, you will give it five stars too.",1459468800,,612,3.7874015748031495
8106505,4,B000E6FVWW,"This GB cd is good,. but not great...
I gave it 4 stars because it's entertaining, but not a very good learning tool for aspiring guitarists...",1397865600,,143,4.538461538461538
8106506,1,B000E6FVWW,"This thing is a big disappointment from minute one. The guy walks into a studio, they hand him somebody's guitar that's out of tune, he plays some really good stuff, then he laughs at you 'cause he's not about to explain it, then he walks out leaving you to say ""WTF."" You want to watch him play, it's a good video. No way this is Benson's home and he doesn't have a guitar of his own or cuoldn't have brought one for the shoot. I believe him when he says he's not a technical guy. A lot of musical genius' aren't. But then why is he making an instructional video in the first place? I know, I know, you got the book with it, but how much of this stuff is transcribed correctly. And that's why you bought the video in the first place. I think he should be made to refund the money. This thing is a loser.",1392076800,,804,4.062893081761007
8106507,5,B000E6FVWW,"I put this on 4 to 5 times a week...George swings, cant say it any better so I watch, practice and watch some more...the book is o.k...it shows some of what he does but not all.  Luckly u can play most of the lessons at 1/2 speed so in my opinion theres many pearls here to mine...don't sleep on this one",1383004800,,304,3.9836065573770494
8106508,3,B000E6FVWW,"As much as I love George Benson, one of the best jazz guitarists of all time, this DVD has very little to offer jazz players at any level. He is basically doodling and someone else transcribed partially what he was playing. I was lucky enough to have a real lesson with George many years ago and didn't come away with much then either. Some weren't meant to teach. Pat Martino, who said he hated teaching, gave me a private lesson around the same time and I still discover new things from that day. Go figure.",1357344000,,509,4.368421052631579
8106509,4,B000E6FVWW,"George is an example of where you want to get to and he's been there so long it's second nature.  Ignore those who complain about his ability to teach-- the only way to understand this material is the way George understands it, and thats essentially at the level of instinct.  And you can't ""teach"" instinct, because you can't ""explain"" instinct.  Instinct takes practice to develop, there are no shortcuts.  But that's not to say there isn't a lot of value for intermediate to experienced players here.  Part of the challenge is to get so that you know where the notes are without thinking about it, so that you can hear where you want to go in your head and be able to hit the same notes on the guitar without fishing around to find them.  George's technique of scat singing undoubtedly is a help in that regard.  Another interesting aspect of George's playing is his use of chords which is on ample display here.  And his information here on chord substitution and ""color"" are valuable ideas, which should lead to a lot of experimentation.  He won't lead you through the forest here, but he lets you know it's there, and if you're up to it, you should be able to find your own interesting path through.  Novices may find it interesting and entertaining, but they probably won't get much in the way of educational value, most of it will be way over their head.  And in fact, it's way over most everybody's heads, but more advanced players will likely find some hints of new directions worth exploring.  Also, it's possible to analyze what scales he's using, but that's probably a lot of work, and to some extent you may be missing the point if that's what you get out of it.  The Joe Pass video from the same series is also pretty Zen, but I think what George relates here is a bit more useful, or at least, it seems to me.",1356998400,2,1825,4.460843373493976
