7984143,5,B00008G91F,"Greetings;

There are plenty...Well, 4 other reviews about the product, enough for you to get the idea about sex scenes per episode ratio and all. The DVD and VHS listings for this product seems to be somewhat shared, at least for the main listings-there are several more on amazon that are just relistings. It happens.

What most people won't get from the other reviews is that: There are six episodes to the series. For the American release of it on dvd, there are exactly 2 sets. Can Can Bunny Extra: Lucky 7 on DVD and Can Can Bunny Extra: Summer Fun. Each episode is around and about 30 minutes long, each DVD is 90 minutes. When I first bought Lucky Seven, I thought that was it-then after a while I happened upon Summer Fun. Then I found a listing for a 3rd on VHS that I couldn't seem to find on DVD. So now I know and now you do too. Animation wasn't the greatest, thought it was right up there with say, dragon pink. Won't bore you with a history lesson about adult Japan animation, Painted Cel animation VS computer generated animation or CG. Just sharing what was bugging the Hell out of me when I was trying to have the whole of this short series.

Thank you and take care...",1320105600,,1188,4.342342342342342
