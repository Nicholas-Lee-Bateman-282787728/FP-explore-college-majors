5273339,3,B0096F60NQ,This movie has a heart I will give it that. However the comedy is too broad and the dram is over the top camp. The actress who plays Elvis is a likeable cute girl and she can act! On the other hand the actor who plays  Madonna really struggles to portray any complex emotions. Not a bad effort but disappointing.,1360540800,,312,4.2
5273340,4,B0096F60NQ,"""Elvis"" is a rebellious, young lesbian photographer, on her own in bustling Copacabana.  On her part-time job delivering pizzas, she encounters Lady Madonna, a transgender man who works as a hairdresser and has dreams of staging a huge show showcasing her drag talents. Elvis arrives right after Madonna had been beaten up and robbed by her sometimes-boyfriend known as Tripod Joe, Elvis helps Madonna get back on her feet, and the couple eventually form an unlikely loving couple, soon to be a family.  When Tripod Joe ends up in jail, thanks to a photo taken of him by Elvis, he swears revenge against the couple, and their lives take a drastic turn when it becomes known he is out of jail.

This 2010 release from Brazil is rather unique in its characters and plot, presented in a realistic but very colorful and campy atmosphere by a talented filmmaker.  A favorite at many regional and  LGBT film festivals, and won several prizes (including the People's Choice Award) at the 2012 Foreign Press Correspondent Awards.  Not rated, but would be a solid R for sexual content.  In Portuguese with English (also French and Spanish) subtitles, with ""Making of..."" feature and deleted scenes.  I give it four stars out of five.",1352073600,2,1224,4.850961538461538
5273361,5,B0096F60NQ,"I really do like it. There are other play by plays given by other reviewer's, but if you are truly about love being love, then you can appreciate this movie. Elvira's eyes are intense and beautiful. She's really great in this film. I could feel for the situation of the lovers, and appreciate the nuance. I didn't think I'd like it, but I am glad I was curious enough to try.",1454025600,2,375,4.295774647887324

5273367,5,B0096F60NQ,"Fun, campy, fast moving story of a lesbian who falls in love with a transgender woman. Some violent scenes and definitely R-rated, but very engaging. A topic hardly ever discussed, but all pure love should be embraced. Brava!",1440201600,2,225,4.947368421052632
5273368,5,B0096F60NQ,"A very moving, lovely tale.  Very real too if you walk in this world you'll know exactly how true it could be.
So....a girl who is sort of queer and a boy who is definately  that way inclined meet.  Very unlikely things happen and they are just wonderful spirits and fall in kind of love.  She gets pregnant.  So the question is does it matter dad usually wears a dress and mum looks pretty good in leather.  All good really but there is a dark past involved that has a very nasty piece of works and like the cat comes back.  The movie is in English subtitles and not in audio but a fantastic movie.  Loved it.  Not sure if it is comedy or drama but just a bit queer and everything!",1413244800,4,682,4.106060606060606

5273370,4,B0096F60NQ,"Set in the Copacabana neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, this wacky comedy follows the exploits of lesbian photographer and pizza delivery woman Elvis (Simone Spoladore). Elvis's first delivery lands her at the door of transvestite hairdresser Lady Madona (Igor Cotrim), who has been robbed and beaten up by her ex-lover Johnny Tripod (Sergio Bezerra).

While Elvis helps Madona get back on her feet, they share their hopes and dreams with each other. Somewhere along the way, they fall in love. Now in a confusing situation, Elvis and Madona work to figure out what this means and how to deal with the consequences.

Brazilian director Marcelo Laffitte has created a campy romp through the streets of Rio de Janeiro, which shows that love truly does come in all shapes and sizes. Chock full of crazy characters and situations, this offbeat comedy is a winner.

Simone Spoladore is fantastic as young Elvis, humorously dealing with family difficulties as well as an unusual romantic situation. Igor Cotrim portrays burgeoning drag queen Lady Madona with style and grace, despite a violent ex-boyfriend and her own shady past.

8536689,1,B0096F60NQ,"The lack of chemistry between the two leads made it realy difficult to believe that these two ""gay"" characters would fall in love - ever. Let alone after a couple of pizza deliveries, and a drunken night talking. He looks nothing like a female, even when in drag. I could see it, if he did probably. Perhaps, a shave might have helped. That muscuar man body shoved into those dresses certainly didn't.  She is constantly running her fingers through her hair, which was an annoyance. Even if I could overlook that quirk, I just didn't buy her character. Kind of like I didn't buy why a character who was never seen so much as holding a camera called 'Tripod joe.' if anything, she should have been called Tripod Elvis. Then, there was the obvious age difference between E & M, which maybe added to the implausible relationship for me. All of the gay characters in the movie were Madona's friends. Where were all of her lesbian friends wondering why the hell she was suddenly pregnant by a drag queen? His friends would have had some WTF moments when they first hooked up too, but they all acted like it was typical. Maybe, in Brazil, but in America, not so much.",1472688000,,1161,4.5285714285714285
