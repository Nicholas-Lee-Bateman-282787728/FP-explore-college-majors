With each set (you're actually doing double sets) you do 12 reps, 10 reps, and then 8 reps.  A beginner might have a little trouble with form because she really doesn't explain each move's form exhaustively, but I think you could handle it, if you take it slow.  Experienced lifters will find this workout just what they need to thoroughly work the upper body.  She leaves nothing out.  I still think Jane Fonda's two toning tapes are better, but this is a great tape.  (...)",1008028800,15,585,4.462264150943396

We were surprised to see David Keith take a role like this at first, but as the movie plays out his character is kind of funny. It has some funny parts and if you're a fan of Paris Hilton, you'll like it.

1657866,3,B00005RJ0Y,"Bottoms Up was released straight to DVD and the reviews are bad, bad, bad, but I enjoyed the movie and it made me think. First, I admit that the story is not very plausible and neither Mewes nor Paris are the greatest actors, but they were more than adequate for this light hearted story about a Midwestern bartender who goes to Hollywood to try and win a bartending contest and save his father's bar from foreclosure. If you were expecting to see any bottle juggling pyrotechnic bartender high jinks, a la Coyote Ugly or Tom Cruise in Cocktail you'll be disappointed, although there are a few scenes of that. Basically, Owen Peadman's (Jason Mewes') plan changes once he gets there and starts working for his Uncle Earl (David Keith), a free lance tabloid reporter. While working on a story on the studio lot Lisa Mancini (Paris Hilton), the daughter of the studio boss, gets into an accident and blames Owen, getting him and his uncle fired. They vow revenge and hatch a plot to ingratiate Owen into the inner circle so he can dig up some dirt on them, sell the story to the tabloids, and ruin their lives and get the money to save his dad's bar back home.

What made this tawdry tale interesting to me was how it revealed Paris Hilton's method of operation and her ambitions. ""I don't want to be known as the grand-daughter of the Hiltons. I want to be known as Paris,"" said Paris. Though she is viewed as a lazy socialite, and widely scorned for her perceived narcissism, her shallow intellect, and her crass materialism, she is actually creating a Brand, ""Paris Hilton,"" and she uses the tabloids as much as they use her, to keep herself in the public eye and get publicity for her perfume, clothing line, night clubs, and film and recording projects. Perhaps there is no such thing as bad publicity, the way Paris sees the world. She first gained notoriety when the explicit private video 1 Night in Paris was accidentally released--or was it an accident? Her well publicized feuds with her various party girl playmates also stoked the flames of her notoriety. Even a DUI was turned to her advantage, though when she was released early, there was a big hue and cry, and a backlash against her, and she did serve some time, and made a mea culpa tour where she displayed the proper amount of contriteness. ""I think the biggest misconception about me is that I'm this spoiled brat. But I'm not. I'm the total opposite,"" said Paris.

Though she was a laughingstock, she can get booked on Letterman, and all she has to do is keep her chin up, flirt with him a little bit, and he is putty in her hands. ""I talk in that baby talk voice when I'm on TV, it's a put on,"" says Paris. I haven't even mentioned how they tried to use her in the McCain campaign, and you saw how that worked out for them.

She is playing the dumb blonde to the hilt, like Jessica Simpson, seen on reality TV wondering whether Chicken of the Sea Tuna is Chicken. She later made a commercial where she wondered if Buffalo Wings came from flying buffalos. What can you make of statements from Paris Hilton like: ""I went to Wal-Mart for the first time. I always thought they sold wallpaper. I didn't realize it has everything. You can get anything you want there for really, really cheap."" It makes her sound sheltered but not a snob, no she is down for buying stuff really cheap. ""I take my dog Tinkerbelle seriously. I take my job seriously. But I don't take myself all that seriously,"" says Paris.

That is a good strategy when you are in the public eye and a target for cheap jokes and paparazzi attacks. What does Paris think is her biggest flaw? ""I desperately hate one thing about my body. I have size 11 feet. Yeah, it sucks, because I see all these super cute shoes in the stores: Guccis, YSLs, Manolos. And when they bring them out in my size, they look like clown shoes,"" says Paris. Poor Paris. See, it's working. I am starting to feel sympathy for her.

Jason Mewes is on a slightly different career trajectory, but it isn't really as different as it seems. His friend, Kevin Smith, realized that the only way he was ever going to get any McLovin' was for him to become a film director, and Mewes rode that gravy train through a whole series of films, establishing himself and Smith as the iconic figures, Jay and Silent Bob. In Bottoms Up, Jason starts to move out of Smith's humongous shadow, but there is still a cameo appearance. The Owen Peadman character is a little more subdued then motor mouth Jay. His secret in becoming a part of a celebrity entourage is to not fawn over the famous, be a little sassy, like you couldn't care less. A little extortion, just to get your foot in the door, doesn't hurt, either.

1657867,2,B00005RJ0Y,"I am going for a record folks. This is my third Paris Hilton Movie (1 Night in Paris, House of Wax). Is that a sign of suicidal tendency or have I lost it completely?

Jason Mewes is Goober, a bartender (slack job in this case) with slacker buddies (one is Kevin Smith), who goes to Hollywood to get money to save pops restaurant. he stays with his gay uncle (David Keith), who is pretending to be straight. This is the only character in the movie worth watching as he is hilarious pretending to be straight when he is the very definition of flaming queen.

Goober wants to be cool, so he wrangles his way into Lisa Mancini's (Paris Hilton) current boyfriend's (Brian Hallisay) entourage. This is the biggest collection of idiots I have ever seen. As Uncle Earl says, where is Charles Manson when you need him. But there was some real juicy tatas at the parties! Paris Hilton as Lisa actually comes off as a really nice girl deep down (BWAAAAA HAAAA HAAA)) and ole Goober falls in love until she sticks it to him again. And, no, he doesn't get to stick it to her first.

Oh, heck, there were some funny parts, so I will bump up the score. Tatas: 1, funny parts (including Uncle Earl): 1 for a total of 2.",1227484800,2,1204,4.342222222222222
1657868,1,B00005RJ0Y,"Erik MacArthur's Bottoms Up is not a great film. It may not even be a terribly good film. The story is one of Hollywood revenge. Jason Mewes plays Owen Peadman a Minnesotan bartender who goes to Hollywood to compete in the King of the Bar contest in order to win enough money to keep his father's Steakhouse open. While in Hollywood he is forced to stay at the home of hos blatently [...] Uncle Earl (David Keith).

Owen meets and falls in love with the daughter of studio executive A.J. Mancini (Tim Thomerson) played by Paris Hilton. We can say with some certainty that acting was never her strong suit. Hilton is dating current heartthrob Hayden Field (Brian Hallisay) who has a secret that if exposed would doom his new film and career.

The film tries to parody the shallowness of Hollywood life but falls far short. The script and editing are a mess and on the whole the film looks like the low budget production it is.

Thankfully the disc has no real extras other than some trailers. This is one for fans of Hilton only.",1211673600,5,1028,4.4866310160427805
1657869,3,B00005RJ0Y,"Bottoms Up has a by the numbers romantic comedy portion and not many major laughs but a detailed enough plot to hold my interest for the first hour. Jason Mewes was the main reason I watched it, and while any expectations of him reprising his Jay character will be dashed, I don't regret taking the time to watch it. It's very low budget with most scenes taking place in sitcommy model home looking sets and very little sense of action. It starts out seeming like it could go somewhere but stays very low-key losing my interest as it went on. Can't exactly say I like this movie but it still has more flavor than 90% of what else is shown in theatres.",1188604800,,651,4.344262295081967
1657870,2,B00005RJ0Y,"This movie is pretty bad, although it's not bad enough to deserve a one star rating. And it's not bad just because Paris Hilton is in it. Sure, she couldn't act if her life depended on it, but the biggest problem is the weak script. It's only occasionally funny, but most of the jokes fall flat. It also seems to try to be part serious drama, but this only makes it slower and even less funny. ""Bottoms Up"" is not good enough to recommend. And what's with all the blatant product placement for Golden Palace online casino?",1184976000,,522,4.391752577319588

1657873,2,B00005RJ0Y,"I can hardly believe it myself, but I've now seen three - three! - Paris Hilton movies.  I fear I'm actually beginning to find her attractive, which is a pretty frightening thought.  The woman can't act a lick, though.  I didn't think she was all that bad in House of Wax, but Bottoms Up might as well have been titled Thumbs Down.  As far as I can tell, both Paris and Jason Mewes are distinguished graduates of the Hayden Christensen School of Acting, and they decided to have a full-fledged act-off to prove, once and for all, which of them is the least talented actor/actress in the universe.  Unfortunately, it's impossible to determine a winner because they're equally bad.  Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith may be pretty entertaining when they're together, but Mewes is just helpless when he's on his own (Kevin Smith is in this movie, but it's only a small role, and he and Mewes are only together for a minute or two).

Mewes plays Owen, a Minnesota boy who goes to Hollywood to compete in a big bartender's contest, hoping to use the prize money to save his dad's steakhouse.  Since he's basically broke, he stays with his outrageously-gay-but-pretending-to-be-straight uncle Earl (David Keith, the only cast member who put any effort at all into his role).  Earl works for a tabloid news show - until, that is, the uber-famous Lisa Mancini (Paris Hilton) gets him fired.  That's when Earl and Owen vow revenge on Lisa, her hunk-of-the-month boyfriend Hayden Field (Brian Hallisey), and their whole hoity-toity crowd.  A little dishonesty goes a long way, gaining Owen access to Hollywood's in crowd.  As he gets to know them, however, he begins to see that their images don't necessarily reflect their true selves.  Could it be that the fantabulous Lisa Mancini isn't truly a party girl, and that there's actually a human being in there somewhere?  Who knows?  Who cares?  With its terribly weak script and consistently bad acting, any point this movie even tries to make is moot at best.

I'm giving the film two stars because I did enjoy seeing a couple of annoying characters get what they deserve in the end, and David Keith's way-over-the-top performance can be pretty entertaining.  There's Keith going all out for his role, while everyone else just sleepwalks through the entire movie.  DK, this second star's for you, buddy.",1165276800,5,2338,4.8291457286432165

But while out there, he meets Lisa (played by Hilton) and gets involved in the Hollywood celebrity scene. The plot just felt recycled, and the acting was horrible especially by Hilton herself. The movie doesn't serve justice to Jason Mews nor any of the actors forced to act in this ""movie"" and let's face it, this movie is such a joke.",1165017600,9,602,4.583333333333333

So ya overall I liked it and don't understand why people are not going to getting this DVD. I'm surprised this film didn't go to theaters because its better then half the movies that are there now.

Since she is so concerned with her image, I am surprised that she allowed it. It would have been nice to have some more cameo's in the movie. While I don't see a bottoms up 2 in the near future this movie does remind you of the cheese movies of the 80's and even has a some t and a for show and tell.",1275264000,,641,3.900763358778626
7952685,5,B00005RJ0Y,"Why do you always pick on Paris Hilton? Yes I know that she was bad in ""The Hillz"" and ""L.A Knights"" but really she did great in this movie. She plays a sweet little character, no it's not a serious movie but it's a light sweet hearted comedy. I feel so sorry for Paris when it says in the magazines that Paris's new movie was a flop. It's really good. Just because she's an heiress doesn't mean she has no talent. She plays a light-minded sweetheart in an attempt to become famous and ends up dating this famous cute guy and they use it to publicise themselves, however the scheming Lisa Mancini has a plot to get all of her ""boyfriend""'s money.

Negative points: It kind of waffles on about the whole story and it could have been an excellent cinema movie if they had a higher budget.
