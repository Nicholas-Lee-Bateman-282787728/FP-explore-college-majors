3100243,5,B0012Z36F8,"I love the 4400.  It is exciting and orginal.  I still cannot beleive the idiots at USA canceled the show.  I will miss the fantastic stories, writing and acting.
Watch and See for yourself-start with season one and you will be hooked.",1204934400,8,235,4.5476190476190474
3100244,4,B0012Z36F8,"The 4400 had a great premise - the human race has destroyed the world.  The future has found a way of going back in time and selecting 4400 people and enhance them with an ability that will help save the world.  But it turns out that the 4400 has good abilities and evil abilities.  So, the US government sets up a new agency, NTAC to oversee these returnees.

Well that was the original concept but in Season 3, USA decided to give it a darker edge and the show was all over the place.  But I am happy say that in the Season 4 that the show started to get back on track.  But I am sad to say that there will be no Season 5!

So enjoy the following and final episodes:

The Wrath of Graham - A promicin teenager gets the ability to make everyone like him.

Fear Itself - A person can make your worst fears come true or least make you think that it is true.

Audrey Parker's Come and Gone - A woman acquires the ability to astra project herself.  But when she is murdered while projecting, her astral projection tries to lead Tom and Diana to her murderer.

The Truth and Nothing but the Truth - A woman acquires the ability to force people to tell the truth but this could kill her. (Natasha Gregson Wagner - daughter of Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner - guests)

Try the Pie - Tom finds out that Kyle is positive and Kyle flees to Collier's Evanston, a town where everyone is promicin positive.

The Marked - A film director has the ability to make acturate pictures about real life consiracies. But his latest film The Marked is too hot.

Till We Have Built Jerusalem - Collier's followers move to Seattle and build Promise City.

No Exit - NTAC is in shut down with Tom, Diana, Megan, Shawn, Kyle, Jordan, Isabelle, Maia, PJ, Marco and Brady.  But no one has any recollection of how they got there.  And even worse, the building seems to have a deadly mind of its own.

Daddy's Little Girl - Richard kidnaps his daughter Isabelle in hopes of starting a new life with her.

One of Us - NTAC is pressured to bring in Richard and Isabelle.  Burkoff develops a test to determine who will be able to take promicin.  Tom has a dream about the 4400. (Look for 24's Penny Johnson Jerald)

Ghost in the Machine - A computer virus invades a company run by a suspected member of The Marked.

Tiny Machines - Isabelle works with Tom to get to Collier.  Shawn tries to break out Kevin from Promise City.

The Great Leap Forward - Anyone who meets Danny becomes positive but this leads to many deaths including Danny's mother.

It's too bad that USA decide to end the series here and not give the show a chance to end itself.

Enjoy the final episodes.",1203292800,54,2640,4.2894736842105265

3100269,3,B0012Z36F8,"The fourth season of ""The 4400"" left a lot of loose ends.  If you felt anything about some of the characters you were left in a void.

3100271,5,B0012Z36F8,"The 4400 was a great show.  The only problem I have with it is that it was cancelled and ended on a BIG-TIME cliffhanger.

That being said it is still worth checking out.  If you were a fan of Heroes or Alphas (there seems to be a theme here when it comes to shows about groups of super-powered people being cancelled) then you will like the 4400 also.

3100278,5,B0012Z36F8,I really miss this series.  I loved it when it was on TV.  Seems all the good ones never last long.  I would have LOVED to see where they would have taken this series if it had run for several more years!,1354579200,,204,3.8095238095238093

3100280,5,B0012Z36F8,i was most satisfied with this produced because i have the other 3 seasons. it told a story about 4400 people that would hepl change the world,1320537600,,142,4.296296296296297
3100281,5,B0012Z36F8,"The 4400 was one of my favorite shows (along with Quantum Leap which I have the whole series) & I thought that it would last a couple more seasons but of course that never happens with the best shows in television.  I ended up buying the entire DVD set of The 4400 & was going through the entire thing again from the beginning again & I was loving every episode again!
I just thought it was strange where before I started watching a couple episodes they would start out saying ""previously on the 4400"" & then would show what happened on the last episode & I had never seen any of it before, like they were leaving out parts or even entire programs, especially during the last one (The Great Leap Forward) there wasn't ANY of that shown in a previous episode. I just think that is strange.  Also I noticed when I looked on the ""episode guide"" on USA Network"" & there seems to be 2 parts to some of the episodes (Wake up Call-Season 2)  & The New World - Season 3) ) & there only seems to be first part on the DVD's.  I dunno about anybody else but this stuff drives me crazy. I hope it just wasn't me who got ALL defective DVD sets. LOL",1285977600,,1135,4.1454545454545455
3100282,5,B0012Z36F8,I loved the 4400 when it was on and have missed it. I wish the DVD set had more extras but I love getting to watch it again. Season 4 improved on Season 3.,1279238400,,155,3.588235294117647
3100283,5,B0012Z36F8,"What a great final season!  Although with the second season I found myself losing interest, the third and fourth are exceptional.  It is thoughtfully written and inspires great discussions.  It is one of the best, if not the best, sci-fi shows ever.",1276214400,,249,4.880952380952381
3100284,4,B0012Z36F8,"Had I known the producers would stick it to the loyal viewers (and chumps like me who don't watch much TV but bought all 4 seasons,) I'd have been tempted not to start in the first place.  If I had, I'd have missed out on several hours of enjoyable sci-fi.

I could go into more, but it's really going to come down to whether you want to buy 4 seasons of a story that you know is going to leave you unfinished, with the tale untold.  Apparently there are at least 3 books that are intended as sequels that pick up where the end of Season 4 left off, so we'r'e not entirely without, but it's a reasonably sure bet that it will be the books this time, rather than the movie, that falls short of expectations.

If you're fond of shows that got canceled but kept some rabid fans, this is probably the right one for you.  If you need to see the story told all the way through, save yourself the angst and don't bother buying any more of them.

I'm glad I saw what there was of it... but wish someone had warned me of this when I started buying up the seasons on DVD.  Now you've been warned.  Great show, but it's going to leave you hanging.",1267920000,,1136,4.108597285067873
3100285,5,B0012Z36F8,"Got the whole complete series now and love it but wish they would have continued this instead of stopping it on tv.  The discs cover it just as the tv series did with a review from each eposide, I wish it was just without those ""in the last series breakdown"" as I skip though this part.  Would prefer it they cut out that in between and put it together just like a movie.",1264809600,,371,4.068493150684931
3100286,5,B0012Z36F8,"this was a great show super interesting i don't understand how could it be canceled. The final chapter wastn that good i gues is because they had to ended in a rush i don't blame them, but this show deserved a great finale. its so sad. :(. Still i love 4400.",1252713600,,258,4.078431372549019
3100287,2,B0012Z36F8,You can tell this was the last season just btw they rushed it.  Unfortunate because the first 3 season were excellent.  Is a movie in the making to bring us some sort of closure?,1252195200,,178,4.205882352941177
3100288,5,B0012Z36F8,"There are many television shows that will never be forgotten, and among these shows are Star Trek, Prison Break, House, Stargate, and 24.  There are also groundbreaking, brilliant television shows that have left us too soon such as with Jericho, Journeyman, and Life on Mars, and the 4400 from start to end promised to be one of the most delivered tv shows of Science-Fiction with talented writers, cast, and crew.  But this show was only aired for four years, but within those years are we captivated by the fate of the world, who rests with a group of people changed by the hands of the future.  And as 4400 people returned to a pivotal time, they struggle with their fate and the challenges of their new lives, and in the face of new dangers and the possible end does this rollercoaster ride of suspense and drama reach its conclusion.",1251590400,,838,4.610738255033557
3100289,2,B0012Z36F8,"Still great effects, cinematography and all of that but I noticed the slip in storyline and dialogue quality in this season. To be honest, I am a few episodes off finishing the series because I can't bring myself to sit through the show anymore. And I bought this DVD over a year ago. I used to love this show but this season definitely slipped in narrative quality. I would recommend you buy this to add to your collection of 4400 DVD's if the price is good because the first half isn't so bad but you will notice your interest rapidly declines by the final disc possibly mostly due to character inconsistencies.

I'll be generous and give it a 5/10, although I am saddened to do so as it was once my favourite show.",1251504000,,717,4.390977443609023
3100290,5,B0012Z36F8,"I really enjoyed this entire series, which has complex characters and storylines that are unexpected and exciting.

3100291,5,B0012Z36F8,"This is a great show, one that I loved for the four seasons that it aired on the USA network.  However, it was cut short too early and I feel could have explored much more in the lives of all the characters, if only ratings would have kept it on the air, I suppose.

Having said that, if you haven't seen this show and you love quality ""sci-fi,"" run out and buy the seasons and immerse yourself in some great stories.  You won't be disappointed.",1250208000,,445,4.211764705882353
3100292,4,B0012Z36F8,This is one of my most favorite shows and I cannot believe they're letting it end this way! There are still so many unanswered questions now that so many people are promicin positive and Jordan has taken over Seattle. I feel like the fight is just beginning. The way Shawn was looking at Jordan's pictures after losing both his mother and brother...I just feel like there's an entire story there that needs to be told. I know he feels Jordan is responsible and would like to act on those feelings. I wish they would just give us one more season. Just one more. Pleeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaase!!,1238803200,,586,4.644230769230769
3100293,4,B0012Z36F8,"after a disappointing season 3, I didn't know what to expect when season 4 arrived.  I'm happy to report that season 4 might just be the best season ever; (although season 2 is EXCELLENT as well).

the stories in sea. 4 are a grade above season 3, and Billy Campbell's return to the series elevates the dramatic tension.  Joel Gretsch and Jacqueline McKenzie also shine in the 4th season.

hate it that the series has now ended; maybe the producers will create a big screen movie for fans in the future..",1238630400,,504,4.5054945054945055
3100294,4,B0012Z36F8,All Sci-fi series suffer from that desire to up the wow factor each season which ends up taking things too far. In this case though I think they could have pulled at least one or two more seasons from this series. This season ties up some but not all of the loose ends from the previous seasons though it does add a couple of its own.  While probably not the best season of the series it does a good job of coming up with new angles to explore the characters we've come to know. In short if you thought season 3 was too over the top then you do not need to see this one otherwise click buy now.,1234396800,,594,3.991596638655462
3100295,5,B0012Z36F8,"I was not sure how this season could ever be as good as the first one, but with a reinvented plot they have done it.  Jordan's character gets more interesting, and the relationship between Tom and Kyle gets intensified for both good and bad in different episodes.  An awesome twist at the end leaves you craving season 5.

Overall, this was the best season of the series.

3100296,5,B0012Z36F8,"The fourth season of 4400 does not dissapoint, in fact it left me gasping for more. The plot thickens, as the gulf between the ones with abilities and ""normies"" grows. However, the twists and turns make this an interesting ride to be on.

Unfortunately, the product itself, the discs, also had a level of uncertainty, freezing in mid frame and jumping forward leaving this consumer with more unanswered questions than I had bargained for.",1223596800,,438,4.918918918918919

I have all four seasons and watching them back to back--I found things that I missed and loved the commentaries. I would have liked to see four more seasons, but then I wanted four more seasons of StarTrek:Enterprise too... :o(",1220313600,,403,4.246753246753247

My disappointment did not last long though as I was very soon engrossed with the great
acting and story line.  This show has a great deal of twists and turns that keep me guessing and very intrigued.
OK so what about season 4 you ask ?  All I can say is that this show just keeps getting better and better every season. Very original and intelligently written. Definitely worth watching and owning on DVD I can't wait to get my hands on season 5.",1218153600,,714,4.056737588652482

3100303,4,B0012Z36F8,"This the fourth and final season of 4400, unless the network brings them back. The only reason I did not give this five stars is the ending. Be forewarned, seasons 1-3 were good, season four is very good, but ends mid-story.

Other than that, if you enjoy Sci-Fi, give this show a viewing. The premise of the series is pretty cool; 4400 people (almost all Americans, ironically) were abducted from various times and returned at the same time with special gifts.[powers]

By season four the characters are getting developed in way that is defineately interesting, however one can tell that the writers are making some up on the fly. They probably were not sure if they were getting one or two more seasons; anyway it is worth watching. If you do, make sure you at least send an e mail to the network ( I think it's CBS) to request another season. They end it when it[storyline] is going real good.

Do not start with season four, start with first season.",1215388800,,953,4.56140350877193
3100304,4,B0012Z36F8,"The 4400 has had a bumpy ride.  Canceled, given a reprieve, and then done to death by low ratings and the writer's strike, it hits its stride at last in the fourth and final season and delivers a satisfying send off.  Season four is not without its problems, however.

  This last season focuses on the crisis caused by the widespread dissemination of the Promicin shot.  Anyone willing to risk their lives can have a 50/50 chance of receiving a power...but those that don't get a power, die.  While NTAC struggles vainly to put the Promicin genie back in its bottle, Jordan Collier's movement transforms into a true cult of personality.

The plots in the fourth season finally move away a bit from the ""mutant of the week"" format that plagued earlier episodes.  Unfortunately, there is one very silly plot arc about body snatchers from the future called the Marked that takes up a lot of screen time, and is almost completely uninteresting.  Couldn't the writers have come up with better villains than this?  Oh well.  The real excitement in season 4 comes from watching Jordan Collier's machinations and his conflict with the more moderate Shawn Baldwin.  Bill Campbell once again steals the show as Jordan Collier.  He is both menacing and charming, and leaves viewers genuinely unsure of his intentions right up to the end of the show.  Patrick Flueger also does a good job as a conflicted leader trying to walk a middle path.  Other actors are fine, with no particular standouts.

  Another gripe with the 4400 is the tendency of actors to quickly be written out of the show, with little explanation or aftermath for their departure.  Billy Campbell took time off from the show to sail around the world in an earlier season, and the show suffered for it.  The main character's wife disappears this season, and after an episode of moping, he's in bed with a new beautiful female lead.  That was fast.  Richard and Lily Tylor re-appear to almost no purpose late in the season, and are gone just as fast.  Why bother bringing them back at all?  They don't move the story forward.

  Minor complaints aside, I enjoyed this last season.  The show ends on an ambiguous note, and I hope a TV movie can be worked out to clear things up for fans.

  It's a pet peeve of mine when watching television on DVD that sometimes clicking the ""next"" button not only skips the, ""previously on"" recap at the beginning of each episode, but also the beginning of the new episode.  That doesn't happen here.  I don't know who worked on putting the actual DVD together, but the chapters are logical, and easy to navigate.  Thanks!",1215043200,5,2612,4.690949227373069

3100306,5,B0012Z36F8,"Its awesome. Season Four begins where season three left off and then just takes off. Tension builds all the way through as you see the various threads of the story coming together, and you keep wondering where its going to lead, but then the tragic / happy ending still catches you by surprise. Questions are answered but others are raised, some main characters end but others begin, and mostly it leaves you wanting more.

This show was Heroes, X-men and Mutant X as they all should have been, and now its gone.

3100307,4,B0012Z36F8,"Well written, well acted.  Basically, 4400 abductees return in a ball of light, each with a special ability.  The central tale revolves around a core group but each week there is a guest ability featured.  There are many organizations trying to use the 4400 to its own ends so we have vilains from government, industry and family all trying to take advantage of the talents demonstrated by the returnees.  Sometimes it's hard to keep track of who's good and who's bad (and even who's dead and who's alive).

This show draws from many sources but still manages to be unique and stand on its own.  It has a bit of the Andromeda Strain, H.G. Wells, Biblical figures, but mostly Dr. Seuss's ""The Sneetches"".  (The star bellied Sneetches had bellies with stars; the plain bellied Sneetches had none upon thar's"").  That's basically the whole premise - Do you want a star or not?  Is having a star better than not? This may sound simplistic but the writers weave episode after episode, season after season's stories around this age old question - Is what we want really best for us?
In my estimation, each season is quite equal so I'm using this review for each.  Watch and enjoy....bg",1214352000,4,1179,4.679611650485437

Until, that is, the final episode, when the writers brought it all together, and perhaps not planned as the series finale, still managed to provide a fitting and satisfying ending.

3100327,5,B0012Z36F8,"The title of this review may make it sound like I hated this show... not so, I found it far more enjoyable than the glut of cheaply made ""Reality"" shows that are flooding the network programming. I cancelled my Cable after this show was cancelled, due to the irresponsible way networks have been cancelling show after show that I enjoy (Dead like me, Serenity, Angel, Wonderfalls, Joey, Dark angel... add infinitum)with no Viable conclusion. It's like a constant slap in the face to invest a couple years in a show just to have it cancelled because the writers have written themselves into a corner.
  I still watch all the shows I like, I just wait until they're on DVD and rent them from Netflix. I can then watch the entire show's run in a couple weekends and I don't have to see a single commercial.
  This show was just starting to get really poignant with the new story arcs they opened up, but when they just cancelled it for no reason. I turned to alternatives. I doubt that the networks care that I cancelled my cable, but hopefully enough people will get tired of the networks thumbing their noses at them and follow suit. I understand the need to cancel shows, just do it responsibly. The shows are the network's product. If I continually received imcomplete products from a store, I would no longer shop there. It doesn't have to be a good conclusion, just some closure... Joss Whedon understands this better than anyone. Fox prematurly cancelled Firefly, so Joss made a movie and tied  almost everything up. The same thing happened with Stargate Sg-1. ((Networks, pay attention: If you want people to continue to buy your products, quit slapping your customers in the face!)) That's my rant... I leave the fight in your capable hands, because I no longer care what the networks do. Fight the good fight and cancel your cable.",1211068800,9,1838,4.678018575851393

Cause the ending really did not end on a nail biting cliffhanger like the rest of the seasons.

The future has found a way of going back in time and selecting 4400 people and enhance them with an ability that will help save the world.  But it turns out that the 4400 has good abilities and evil abilities.  So, the US government sets up a new agency, NTAC to oversee these returnees.

Well that was the original concept but in Season 3, USA decided to give it a darker edge and the show was all over the place.  But I am happy say that in the Season 4 that the show started to get back on track.  But I am sad to say that there will be no Season 5!

So enjoy the following and final episodes:

The Wrath of Graham - A promicin teenager gets the ability to make everyone like him.

Fear Itself - A person can make your worst fears come true or least make you think that it is true.

Audrey Parker's Come and Gone - A woman acquires the ability to astra project herself.  But when she is murdered while projecting, her astral projection tries to lead Tom and Diana to her murderer.

The Truth and Nothing but the Truth - A woman acquires the ability to force people to tell the truth but this could kill her. (Natasha Gregson Wagner - daughter of Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner - guests)

Try the Pie - Tom finds out that Kyle is positive and Kyle flees to Collier's Evanston, a town where everyone is promicin positive.

The Marked - A film director has the ability to make acturate pictures about real life consiracies. But his latest film The Marked is too hot.

Till We Have Built Jerusalem - Collier's followers move to Seattle and build Promise City.

No Exit - NTAC is in shut down with Tom, Diana, Megan, Shawn, Kyle, Jordan, Isabelle, Maia, PJ, Marco and Brady.  But no one has any recollection of how they got there.  And even worse, the building seems to have a deadly mind of its own.

Daddy's Little Girl - Richard kidnaps his daughter Isabelle in hopes of starting a new life with her.

One of Us - NTAC is pressured to bring in Richard and Isabelle.  Burkoff develops a test to determine who will be able to take promicin.  Tom has a dream about the 4400. (Look for 24's Penny Johnson Jerald)

Ghost in the Machine - A computer virus invades a company run by a suspected member of The Marked.

Tiny Machines - Isabelle works with Tom to get to Collier.  Shawn tries to break out Kevin from Promise City.

The Great Leap Forward - Anyone who meets Danny becomes positive but this leads to many deaths including Danny's mother.

It's too bad that USA decide to end the series here and not give the show a chance to end itself.

3334781,4,B0012Z36F8,"Had I known the producers would stick it to the loyal viewers (and chumps like me who don't watch much TV but bought all 4 seasons,) I'd have been tempted not to start in the first place.  If I had, I'd have missed out on several hours of enjoyable sci-fi.

I could go into more, but it's really going to come down to whether you want to buy 4 seasons of a story that you know is going to leave you unfinished, with the tale untold.  Apparently there are at least 3 books that are intended as sequels that pick up where the end of Season 4 left off, so we'r'e not entirely without, but it's a reasonably sure bet that it will be the books this time, rather than the movie, that falls short of expectations.

If you're fond of shows that got canceled but kept some rabid fans, this is probably the right one for you.  If you need to see the story told all the way through, save yourself the angst and don't bother buying any more of them.

I'm glad I saw what there was of it... but wish someone had warned me of this when I started buying up the seasons on DVD.  Now you've been warned.  Great show, but it's going to leave you hanging.",1267920000,,1136,4.108597285067873

But this show was only aired for four years, but within those years are we captivated by the fate of the world, who rests with a group of people changed by the hands of the future.

I would recommend you buy this to add to your collection of 4400 DVD's if the price is good because the first half isn't so bad but you will notice your interest rapidly declines by the final disc possibly mostly due to character inconsistencies.

3334800,4,B0012Z36F8,"This the fourth and final season of 4400, unless the network brings them back. The only reason I did not give this five stars is the ending. Be forewarned, seasons 1-3 were good, season four is very good, but ends mid-story.

Other than that, if you enjoy Sci-Fi, give this show a viewing. The premise of the series is pretty cool; 4400 people (almost all Americans, ironically) were abducted from various times and returned at the same time with special gifts.[powers]

By season four the characters are getting developed in way that is defineately interesting, however one can tell that the writers are making some up on the fly. They probably were not sure if they were getting one or two more seasons; anyway it is worth watching. If you do, make sure you at least send an e mail to the network ( I think it's CBS) to request another season. They end it when it[storyline] is going real good.

Do not start with season four, start with first season.",1215388800,,953,4.56140350877193
3334801,4,B0012Z36F8,"The 4400 has had a bumpy ride.  Canceled, given a reprieve, and then done to death by low ratings and the writer's strike, it hits its stride at last in the fourth and final season and delivers a satisfying send off.  Season four is not without its problems, however.

  This last season focuses on the crisis caused by the widespread dissemination of the Promicin shot.  Anyone willing to risk their lives can have a 50/50 chance of receiving a power...but those that don't get a power, die.  While NTAC struggles vainly to put the Promicin genie back in its bottle, Jordan Collier's movement transforms into a true cult of personality.

The plots in the fourth season finally move away a bit from the ""mutant of the week"" format that plagued earlier episodes.  Unfortunately, there is one very silly plot arc about body snatchers from the future called the Marked that takes up a lot of screen time, and is almost completely uninteresting.  Couldn't the writers have come up with better villains than this?  Oh well.  The real excitement in season 4 comes from watching Jordan Collier's machinations and his conflict with the more moderate Shawn Baldwin.  Bill Campbell once again steals the show as Jordan Collier.  He is both menacing and charming, and leaves viewers genuinely unsure of his intentions right up to the end of the show.  Patrick Flueger also does a good job as a conflicted leader trying to walk a middle path.  Other actors are fine, with no particular standouts.

  Another gripe with the 4400 is the tendency of actors to quickly be written out of the show, with little explanation or aftermath for their departure.  Billy Campbell took time off from the show to sail around the world in an earlier season, and the show suffered for it.  The main character's wife disappears this season, and after an episode of moping, he's in bed with a new beautiful female lead.  That was fast.  Richard and Lily Tylor re-appear to almost no purpose late in the season, and are gone just as fast.  Why bother bringing them back at all?  They don't move the story forward.

  Minor complaints aside, I enjoyed this last season.  The show ends on an ambiguous note, and I hope a TV movie can be worked out to clear things up for fans.

  It's a pet peeve of mine when watching television on DVD that sometimes clicking the ""next"" button not only skips the, ""previously on"" recap at the beginning of each episode, but also the beginning of the new episode.  That doesn't happen here.  I don't know who worked on putting the actual DVD together, but the chapters are logical, and easy to navigate.  Thanks!",1215043200,5,2612,4.690949227373069

Tension builds all the way through as you see the various threads of the story coming together, and you keep wondering where its going to lead, but then the tragic / happy ending still catches you by surprise. Questions are answered but others are raised, some main characters end but others begin, and mostly it leaves you wanting more.

3334804,4,B0012Z36F8,"Well written, well acted.  Basically, 4400 abductees return in a ball of light, each with a special ability.  The central tale revolves around a core group but each week there is a guest ability featured.  There are many organizations trying to use the 4400 to its own ends so we have vilains from government, industry and family all trying to take advantage of the talents demonstrated by the returnees.  Sometimes it's hard to keep track of who's good and who's bad (and even who's dead and who's alive).

This show draws from many sources but still manages to be unique and stand on its own.  It has a bit of the Andromeda Strain, H.G. Wells, Biblical figures, but mostly Dr. Seuss's ""The Sneetches"".  (The star bellied Sneetches had bellies with stars; the plain bellied Sneetches had none upon thar's"").  That's basically the whole premise - Do you want a star or not?  Is having a star better than not? This may sound simplistic but the writers weave episode after episode, season after season's stories around this age old question - Is what we want really best for us?

I cancelled my Cable after this show was cancelled, due to the irresponsible way networks have been cancelling show after show that I enjoy (Dead like me, Serenity, Angel, Wonderfalls, Joey, Dark angel... add infinitum)with no Viable conclusion. It's like a constant slap in the face to invest a couple years in a show just to have it cancelled because the writers have written themselves into a corner.
  I still watch all the shows I like, I just wait until they're on DVD and rent them from Netflix. I can then watch the entire show's run in a couple weekends and I don't have to see a single commercial.
  This show was just starting to get really poignant with the new story arcs they opened up, but when they just cancelled it for no reason. I turned to alternatives. I doubt that the networks care that I cancelled my cable, but hopefully enough people will get tired of the networks thumbing their noses at them and follow suit. I understand the need to cancel shows, just do it responsibly. The shows are the network's product. If I continually received imcomplete products from a store, I would no longer shop there. It doesn't have to be a good conclusion, just some closure... Joss Whedon understands this better than anyone. Fox prematurly cancelled Firefly, so Joss made a movie and tied  almost everything up. The same thing happened with Stargate Sg-1. ((Networks, pay attention: If you want people to continue to buy your products, quit slapping your customers in the face!)) That's my rant...
