4553038,5,B0053YS9XI,"I found this film to be important, informative and relevant on many levels, most profoundly on the term ""eco-terrorist"".  People in a desperate and vastly misunderstood fight to protect the earth seem farthest removed from the harsh label.  People who make decisions for companies who rape the earth without regard for the viable alternate non-destructive resources and the government who protects these companies seem most applicable to wear the eco-terrorist label.  How is BP not on trial for eco-terrorism?!  How is the plastic and petrol industries not in the hot seat for both eco- and health-terrorism?!  Why were the recent Tea Party rallies protected by law enforcement but the more recent and far more rational Occupy movements continue to be received as rioters, receiving flash bombs, pepper spray, tear gas and physical violence at the hands of the same officers who protected the Tea Partiers.  Government and money-power seem to hate humanity and the earth.

The ill-directed damage some of these EFL actions imposed on property and businesses is abhorrent.  The fact claimed in the movie that not a single person was physically hurt shows a profound respect for life and impressive planning to ensure it.

SPOILER ALERT: It's a twisted legal system who doesn't equally punish the character who was known to be the main agitator toward destruction versus continued futile protest.",1322524800,5,1395,5.219730941704036
4553039,4,B0053YS9XI,"Daniel McGowan found his passion... protecting fur-bearing animals (""No to fur!), protesting open-pit mining, and preserving forest ecosystems.  This passion lead him to become an activist, and then, by legal standards, a terrorist.

If A Tree Falls: A Story of the Earth Liberation Front is a story of McGowan and a few of his colleagues.  It is not a complete story of the ELF or the ALF (and, to be fair, the subtitle is ""A Story of the Earth Liberation Front,"" not THE story).  The complete story is more complicated, has more enablers, and involves additional cells (e.g., Rod Coronado).  The film is structured with on-camera interviews of McGowan as he awaits trial, along with historical reflections of ELF actions.  Added to this are interviews with McGowan's friends and colleagues as well as interviews with law enforcement officers and people who suffered ELF attacks.

In the end, it seemed everyone was looking after #1.  McGowan is serving a 7 year prison sentence as part of a plea bargain.  Passions were tempered over time.  It's hard to be an underground activist forever.

A few things I didn't see here, and perhaps I don't understand well, were the connections with Earth First! and ALF, the assassination attempt on activist Judy Bari during this time, the lawsuits against law enforcement for their heavy-handed treatment of activists (such as applying pepper spray directly to eyes with cotton swabs), and tree-spiking.

Fundamentally, there are some events that burden the souls of a few to the extent that to do nothing is unacceptable.  McGowan and his colleagues thought  direct action was necessary.  Captain Paul Watson does what it takes to stop whaling.  Similar passion, however, is reflected in those who bomb abortion clinics and burn churches.  Where does it end?  How far can or should activists go?

In another book, author Sharman Apt Russell wrote ""Although a new greener Christianity emphasizes the role of stewardship and the love of God for his Creation, the conservative Christian still sees earth as a halfway house. The plan is to go somewhere better, and what we leave behind is not so important. We are not really a part of this earth, or its forests, rivers, and mountains, in the same way we hope to be part of heaven"" (p. 211,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Standing-in-the-Light-My-Life-as-a-Pantheist/dp/0465013805/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Standing in the Light: My Life as a Pantheist</a>).  When Earth is your church and its processes are your scriptures, it is probably difficult to passively watch the desecration of the temple.

This is a documentary of good intents gone bad, of the transitioning of passion into action, and of 'fessing up in the end.",1322006400,4,2757,5.248858447488584

Marshall Curry and Sam Culliman's absorbing and disturbing film follows the ELF's rise and fall as told through the experiences of member Daniel McGowan.  Part coming-of-age (or is it ""coming of rage""?) story and part a crime thriller as we see Daniel radicalized and then arrested with a possibility of life in prison.  With ample archival footage - some of it is guaranteed to outrage - and intimate interviews with cell members, prosecutors, family members and even the detectives pursuing them, this film does not flinch from raising the hard questions about our human role in safe-guarding the environment as well as how -- and who -- defines terrorism.",1319068800,17,911,5.053333333333334
4553042,5,B0053YS9XI,From the begining to the end this documentary works very hard to balance the arguments for and against protest. McGowan is an interesting character because he is not always sympathetic but stil very real. Full of great old footage of contemporaneous events of protests on the West coast. Even the FBI agents come off as real poeple and not stereotypes. See it!,1318032000,,360,4.82258064516129
4553043,3,B0053YS9XI,"Listening to the commentary track of the director et al, I found myself disagreeing completely with their choice to centre the documentary around one person and unfold the story around him.  I thought the bigger picture got diminished in his personal story.  Whether they were being careful not to offend the authorities or mindful of funding and distribution politics for independent documentaries.....the tone of the documentary appears to be apologetic and defeatist.  It appeared to be a documentary about the 'wrong' choices the activists had made and their now regretful feelings.  Instead of soliciting a spectrum of radical opinions and looking at the broader social issues and affects of 'destruction' activism, the documentary seemed to wrong-end the telescope and create an impression of a radical minority who had 'gone overboard'.  It almost had the feel of a reality-tv soap opera scripted piece.  Neutered and washed clean of any affirmation of its politics and focusing on personal emotion, when it could have been a compelling look at a significant social issue.",1317686400,23,1079,5.317647058823529
4553044,5,B0053YS9XI,"I saw this doc a few weeks ago at IFC. I thought it was a really interesting doc about an activism group that I didn't know very much about, the ELF. The main subject Dan McGowan is the movie's antihero. He smartly describes about how the group radicalized and later his arrest and indictment. Stylistically, the doc is really well put together. I thought the mix of archival material and interviews over a few years weaved together well/ kept my interest. There is also great music, so I recommend checking out the movie. It's crazy that a story like this can slip through the cracks.",1311811200,17,585,4.580952380952381
4553045,5,B0053YS9XI,"This documentary is a must see! It leaves you thinking, trying to grasp your own understanding of what is right and wrong. It highlights the environmental activist movement from a very balanced perspective yet includes footage on the ground with the very people involved at all levels! I cant say enough good things about his film.  Its stunning and shocking to be exposed to the disasters both environmental and judicial.  And to see the impacts at a human level from those with enough heart to fight on both ends of these disasters leaves me wondering, what can I do?",1398038400,,569,4.737373737373737
4553046,4,B0053YS9XI,It is eye opening and really provides a great argument. Although I think it is a little bias and does not give a fair chance to the opposing side.,1391212800,,146,4.068965517241379
4553047,4,B0053YS9XI,I always wondered what it was like inside these groups. I grew up close to where these fires were happening so I found it interesting to get a closer look at the organization.,1388707200,,175,4.333333333333333
4553048,3,B0053YS9XI,"Reflecting on this film, I feel ambivalent, which is perhaps what the writers and producers want you to feel.  Perhaps watching this one is not as enjoyable as other similar themed movies because you can't embrace the protagonists without a sense of moral conflict, or without feeling that their good intentions led them down a wrong path.  I do believe this film is worth watching, for a few reasons.  First, it is brought home to you again how ruthless our government is in attacking environmentalists.  There is a scene in which the protesters have climbed trees to prevent them from being cut down, and they are attacked with pepper spray by the authorities, who deliberately rip their clothes to pepper spray their genitals.  So, you are enraged seeing that.  As a result of the feelings of anger that the film engenders watching the ceaseless and soulless rape of our environment and brutal treatment of those who want to defend it, and the appropriation of our government and its agents by corporate profits, as you begin the film, your sympathies tend to lie with the environmentalist protesters -- you too, are outraged.  And seeing the actions of government agents, you too feel hopeless.  It is in that emotional space of rage and hopelessness that you understand how this group of people felt when they began to make the changes that would lead them from protesting to arson.  Led by the most angry of the bunch, they begin to do more than protest.  And, I could not help but cheer when one of their acts of arson successfully shut down an American horse slaughter plant.  They were always careful that no humans or animals were on the premises when they committed these arsons, with a goal of limiting it to property damage.  However, led by this one individual, their acts predictably lead to destruction of property belonging to individuals who are not as evil as they mistakenly believed, and as the film profiles that business and the men who ran it, who see it all destroyed by arson, you realize -- as does the main protagonist, as perhaps the writers intend -- that going down that path seems to inevitably lead to becoming, in some way, the evil you rail against.  A different flavor perhaps, but you can no longer claim the high road.  I'm sure it's intentional that the film engenders in the viewer the sense of ""not knowing how to feel"" about what you are seeing, since that is the interior monologue of the activist who is being profiled.  He begins to question the actions he's involved in.  ** SPOILER ALERT ** As karma would have it, the ring leader -- the one who spear-headed the move from protesting to arson -- the lead agitator himself, turns state's evidence and gives up the identities and locations of his former fellow activists, years after the last arson when they've all gone on with their lives.  Which underscores the emptiness of it all -- the lead agitator himself was likely acting more out of emotional disturbance than any sense of true conviction, and he managed to take people with him.  None of these facts are reasons to feel ""meh"" about the film, but it does feel a bit overlong and not as tight as it could be.  That's another reason my rating is not higher, and I find that to be true of a lot of environmentalist documentaries -- tight editing and a very clear idea of your emotional arc is really the key.  But here the reason is also ambivalence, leaving the film not knowing quite what the message is, not knowing quite how you feel about the people in it.  If leaving the audience with this feeling was intentional (and I suspect it was) then the creators succeeded.  But I guess I was left with the same hopeless feeling that the activists had when they took their wrong turn -- a sense that it's all useless, that nothing can be done, and that the only effective actions are themselves adding wrong to wrong, becoming a different version of the very thing you want to stop.  You kind of just want to turn it all off and lead a life that has nothing to do with environmentalism because you see that you cannot possible impact the path we are on in any positive way.  Seems almost like the protagonist feels that way too by the end -- ""Man, that wasn't worth it, next time I have a chance I will just focus on domestic life.""  It's a rather unsatisfying feeling to be left with, one that offers no path forward for a person who like the young idealists, is deeply disturbed by what we see happening to the natural world in the name of corporate profit.",1385683200,6,4511,4.573913043478261
4553049,5,B0053YS9XI,Makes you realize who the real terrorists are today are not those struggling to stop global ecocide but the police which are using violence torward non-violent protests. ELF was created from outrage caused by the inhumane treatment of people with a heart for nature and wanting humanity to wake up before its completely destroyed.,1372377600,,330,5.12962962962963
4553050,5,B0053YS9XI,This shows the topic from an objective view. Lets you see the criminal aspect and the personal struggle of the individuals involved in the activities.

4553051,3,B0053YS9XI,"To give this documentary credit, it doesn't look and sound like something M. Moore could have made. Yet it is not quite impartial as it wants to come across. Not enough of the other side, especially businesses who lost their property, were presented. There was no mention of what those businesses had to go through after the loss of property, how those losses affected the property owners and their families, how many people lost their jobs, etc. The film makers took pains to humanize the terrorists, but not the victims.
As to identifying these vandals as terrorists, that's how they should be identified. They did organize to commit multiple acts of destruction. Whether it was directed toward human beings or property is irrelevant. The terminology however has to be more precise. They could be called property terrorists.
Another thing I'd like to point out is that this country does not have laws strict enough to protect private property. The sentences these terrorists received are laughable. Even with plea bargains, the smallest sentence shouldn't have been less than 20 years for each terrorist. They also should be obliged for life to repay the damages they caused.",1366156800,2,1177,5.041025641025641
4553052,4,B0053YS9XI,"This documentary is about how Earth Liberation Front was formed, did and how they were arrested and convicted by the US government. It covers many sensitive humane and political issues which makes the whole documentary very interesting but the credit should go to the director since he allows you to see the whole story without any stupid loud music in the background. Few pointers;

1. It was apparent that Daniel had organized political rally against Republicans as well as wearing a t-shirt with bold letters during the filming of this documentary. I care for the environment, I compost, I do not waste water and I recycle everything. For Daniel to burn that farm and the university building since they were growing GMO trees which infact they were not, raises the question if Daniel had any knowledge of GMOs when having a hatred for one political group. Monsanto executives always get a position with the running administration regardless of who happens to be in the White House. Furthermore, Clinton had more dealings with Monsanto than any other president and he went as far as pardoning Monsanto executive during his term in the office. So the question becomes how anyone with can have any favorite when there is a revolving door with a GMO giant like Monsanto and the White House... After all, Daniel went to prison in 2007 and it was not like that he had no access to the Internet while wearing his t-shirt.
2. Police certainty used a generous amount of pepper spray around 2000. I do not think they can pull that off any more these days especially where they sprayed each eye of that one female while chained to the chair and the other male while chained to the tree. That was appalling to say the least.
3. One member of ELF, the drug addict certainly got away without any punishment. That was very confusing especially when the female partner received four year prison term... what justice...
4. Daniel has a very loving and caring family, especially her sister. What a realistic individual about his brother especially when she gets to explain how she has spent some $500k in legal fees, but she needs to educate herself about the fear that ELF caused to many families regardless of her stand on any issue. There is no reason for even a single citizen to live in terror if we consider ourselves civilized.

Very entertaining, informative and gripping story. Bravo.",1364601600,2,2378,4.78345498783455
4553053,5,B0053YS9XI,This is a great documentary.  It shows how an every day person becomes radicalized enough to take drastic measures.  A great documentary for Sociology classes.,1353801600,,159,5.32
4553054,4,B0053YS9XI,"A great documentary should show all sides of a controversy, and with that in mind, ""If a Tree Falls"" succeeds.

Unlike the docs of Michael Moore, which are completely one-sided, co-directors Marshall Curry & Sam Cullman have presented a most informative composite of the issues involved. There's no question that the ELF didn't think before they acted, and a good argument is made about the absolute definition of terrorism. Centering mostly on the plight of Daniel McGowan, the true voice of reason is his sister, Lisa, who is more able to see life as it is rather than as it ought to be.

After causing billions in damage to validate their cause, it's upsetting that many of their targets were innocent of the ""villainy"" that they supposed. Regardless of anyone's stance on the eco-arguments in question, the ELF failed miserably to do the proper research to qualify their end results. Activism is not a bad thing, but the lengths at which the ELF went to prove their point were purely out of ignorance; hence, foolish and unnecessary.

I applaud the efforts of the film-makers in keeping an objective stance; the DVD extras are plentiful and intriguing. Highly recommended.",1353715200,2,1176,4.929292929292929
4553055,5,B0053YS9XI,"Some people have called this film deplorable because it is ""apologetic"" by attempting to ""humanize"" the ""terrorists."" But it isn't that the movie attempts to ""humanize"" Daniel McGowan et al. When you listen to him, you find that he is simply a human being, period.

It's easy to see a sensationalist news segment and dismiss the E.L.F. members as a bunch of delusional hippy radicals. It's easy to put them in a less-than-human mental category by thinking of them as ""terrorists."" It's much harder to see them as exactly like you and me. No different. That's why this movie is so uncomfortable, and that's why this movie is so important.

P.S. - If you appreciated this movie, you would almost certainly appreciate another one in the POV series about ""domestic terrorists"" called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Better-This-World/dp/B00827OWWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Better This World</a>.",1349308800,5,936,5.824817518248175
4553056,4,B0053YS9XI,"Just stumbled across this documentary - I was afraid it might just be a mouthpiece for members of ELF to give their side of the story but really it shows how complicated these types of situations are. By the end the central question seems to be whether members of ELF can be classified as ""terrorists"" for the destructive actions (arson, mostly) that they have taken. What I appreciated was that this film doesn't attempt to answer that question but really lets you see opinions both from the people who performed the acts (and are now being charged) and the people who had the acts performed to their property. Letting the audience look at both sides really helps show how complicated this is and how sometimes people can think they're doing ""the right thing"" but actually be misguided (at one point they show that ELF members destroyed a location that was not actually doing the types of testing they were led to believe they were doing). Some reviews here have said this doc is supporting ELF, but I would argue that this doc just tells the incredible story of what they did and what the consequences were. Really interesting and captivating film. The special features are good too, especially a short update that gives information on where various people who were interviewed are two years after the film was made.",1340236800,5,1318,4.759825327510917
4553057,5,B0053YS9XI,"If that is terrorism, many of those companies, including some branches of the police and government officials are committing much worse acts of terrorism on a daily basis to say the least. Acts that actually hurts and jeopardizes many innocent lives, sometimes directly destroying them.

As an environmentalist, peaceful activist, and documentary film lover, I actually loved watching this movie. It clearly shows how brutal and abusive the police reacts against the people they are supposed to protect in order to protect the establishment, clearly stating who they are here to protect and serve. It shows how good human beings can commit acts of hardcore vandalism when understood that our well being is at stake, and that non-violent actions are not solving the problem. It also shows how some of the people that are in the business of exploiting the natural resources are not ""evil"", they just don't know any better, and their dependence on such business make them bias and blind to the real consequences of their actions.

Though I must agree that it does becomes very apologetic and narrow sighted towards the end, which gives the viewers the perception that the environmental movement was too radical and failed to send the message. It also ignores the fact that we have continued to extract more than it can be sustainably replenished by nature, which is proof of our collective stupidity, and has to stop.
The reality is that intelligent and good hearted people often get overwhelmed by the so many crimes against nature (including people) being committed on a daily basis, and some act out of desperation to stop such brutal and mindless exploitation from happening.

As a Global Sustainability student at UCLA, and great admirer of peace, science and reason, I understand that our society is in a self-destructing path. You don't need to be a genius or an ""idealistic""  to get to such conclusion, after all we are living in the ""Information Age"", all you have to do is search for the hard facts, and you will find an overwhelming amount of evidence for it. It's been scientifically proven to us that we have to dramatically change the way we interact with nature, so that our next generations can dream about having a future. We as incredibly powerful human beings have the moral responsibility to care for our next generations. Political and ""economic"" excuses won't work. Greed and exploitation has to end.

The environmental movement never stopped. It's been growing exponentially on every part of the globe, and when the matter is survival, like any other animal people will become violent, and do anything they can, using whatever means necessary to protect their lives and the lives of their loved ones.",1339718400,3,2720,4.9823788546255505
4553058,3,B0053YS9XI,"The doc was interesting and somewhat informative. I thought the first half of the doc gave fair coverage to both the ELF and the law enforcement sides of the issue. The second half was lame. It focused too much on McGowan's personal story, and did not say much about how the injustices that ELF fought against are still going on.",1338595200,3,329,4.5

4553060,2,B0053YS9XI,"My answer to that question is an emphatic yes.

""If a Tree Falls"" is a well produced, interesting documentary about the Earth Liberation Movement.  At the same time, it's more than a bit like a recent documentary about the 1960s era terrorist group the Weather Underground.  The parallel is that both documentaries more or less hand over the microphone to people who are unapologetic about committing actions that I have no doubt if they were the victims of instead of being the perpetrators of, they'd call ""terrorism.""

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Weather-Underground/dp/B0001LYFKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Weather Underground</a>

There really is very little in the way of people challenging the narrative that the extremists/activists/terrorists put forth.  In the first 24 minutes, one of the prosecutors involved in ELF cases speaks for about 30 seconds.  All the rest is from the viewpoint of the ELF arsonists.

So I think there's very little in the way of ""documentary"" vice propaganda here.  Occasionally, we get a bit of insight from outsiders looking into the activists' world.  For example, the protagonist's sister does not come across as an environmental ""loony""...nor does a man who does some logging but wants to preserve old growth forests.

I'm also struck by two comments that the ELF members make.  One who has to live with his sister while facing trial comments about not wanting to impose his way of living on her.  Another one makes a comment about the arrogance of the people they perceive as the enemies of nature.  I'm struck by the arrogance and obtuseness of those comments.  The United States is a democracy with a long tradition of mass movements and people working within the democratic process to get their agenda into law.  The ELF people operate completely outside that tradition and break laws on a symphonic level because they are ""right.""  Who is being arrogant and imposing their philosophy of life on people here here?  Maybe they ought to ask themselves the question, ""If I can't get what I want without breaking the law, does that mean that what I want isn't what is right?""

Finally, I would like to pose a challenge to the people who believe what the ELF does is just great and they aren't terrorists.  I imagine that most of you believe in civil rights and are pro-choice on the abortion question.  Suppose there was some group that called itself ""the Morality Liberation Front"" and let's suppose that this group burned down abortion clinics, torched gay bars, and burned a few black churches as well.  Would you accept the argument from a spokesman of such a group that they weren't terrorists because they really believed what they were doing was the right thing and that they hadn't injured or killed anyone?  Would you?  I somehow doubt it.

In the end, the ELF is a terrorist group just like the KKK is a terrorist group just like the FALN is a terrorist group just like al-Qa'ida is a terrorist group.  All of these groups believe what they are doing is ""right"" and they all commit or threaten acts of violence (including property damage) for political effect.  The only difference is degrees.",1334534400,6,3196,5.038095238095238

1) An interesting discussion on whether social change is possible in contemporary society
2) The enormous cost and blowback from police heavy-handedness. People seem to respond to being treated as the enemy by acting like the enemy at times. Very interesting.
3) What does it mean to be a terrorist? If all the buildings they burned were without people in them and nobody was ever harmed in over 1200 fires then on what basis do they qualify as terrorists as opposed to arsonists?

Interesting documentary. I liked seeing the history of the movement and appreciated that the police were given so much time to tell their side of the story.
