7657219,3,B01BIGFZYK,"This almost becomes a case of Cruella de Vil meets Laurence Oliviers dentist from The Marathon Man. The parents who find any excuse to torment their daughter almost become caricatures of those two famous movie villains. But not quite. The actors playing the parts of the gleefully sadistic mother and father pull back just short of becoming travesties of such cruelty. Their tortures are also made more realistic by the fact that recent decades headlines teach us that there really are such parents, such people, at work in the world.

Holly Jacobson, who plays the beleaguered daughter, muted by autism, gives a performance that becomes slightly repetitious and annoying. Her only method of conveying her frightened, vulnerable state is to dart her downcast eyes nervously about. However, she can be focused and frightening in those moments when she finds her strength.

That strength comes to her from her dead twin. The question becomes whether she can fully acquire the spirit of that departed twin, made strong by death. Can she accede to her twins urgings to let me in, so that she can be steered and steeled to solve her situation? If she does let in her sisters spirit, will she be harboring an angel  or a devil?

This is a low-budget film with unseasoned actors. The torture scenes might be too much for people especially sensitive to the sufferings of children. However, if you can stomach the sight of such abuse, youll probably find this film worth watching.",1466294400,2,1471,4.895582329317269

7657221,5,B01BIGFZYK,"Don't be fooled by the hokey cover. This film is extremely well-made, phenomenal acting, and is one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen. While it has a ghost element to it, the real horror is the treatment this girl experiences at the hands of her psychotic parents - imagery that will haunt you long after the credits roll (though there is very little, if any, blood - it's not that kind of torture). If you enjoy disturbing movies, this is a must-watch.",1465948800,3,465,4.482352941176471

7657223,1,B01BIGFZYK,"I almost didn't watch this movie because I thought it'd be very gory or disturbing, but it really wasn't. Yes, there is abuse, but it's mostly a few slaps here and there, a couple of tie-downs, and implied sexual abuse. Honestly, not much is shown- certainly not to the extent some reviewers are saying. Perhaps if child abuse really gets to you, skip the film, but if you're a psychological horror movie veteran, it probably won't be that serious. The acting was poor- particularly the parents. Instead of an emotionally charged scene, you get what looks to be an ""edgy"" high-school rendering of a Disney villain. I expected the mother to pull out a poisoned apple halfway through. The real-life storyline of abuse being ignored is believable and slightly distressing, but the random supernatural elements are thrown together shoddily and there's little to no explanation. A stereotypical gypsy woman with all the answers is thrown in there at the end for good measure, but she adds nothing. This film was a let-down.",1497916800,,1018,4.924418604651163

7657226,1,B01BIGFZYK,"The acting was absolutely awful. I couldn't figure how anyone would think the acting of any of the actors was even passable. The story made no sense either...no character development and why would her ""parents"" be so sadistic?  Then 3/4 of the way in, sexual abuse by the father is thrown in cause the film makers figured out too late that there was no character development or story development. It was an absolute abomination which was why I had to watch it to the very end to see how the parents were going to be done away with. This was the only payoff from the movie since I'd already invested over an hour and half to this. The ""parents"" were terrible but the acting was the absolute worst. Don't waste your time on this even if it was free, which was the only reason it was barely worth sitting through.",1495670400,,810,4.4
7657227,4,B01BIGFZYK,"I do not consider this movie a horror film, instead it was about seeking to find escape and peace from the torment. As other people mentioned in their reviews, it is very difficult watching a little girl going through all the torture and abuse. Every abusive act the parents committed on the child, i wanted a ghost to strike them down. There were many parts of the movie i had to skip, i just could not see a parent do that type of abuse to a child. The plot did take a little long to develop, but the end was worth the wait. i just wish the evil parents suffered more. compared to how much the child suffered, i feel that got off easy.
I normally can discover the plot easily in a movie, but this movie was very difficult to read. It requires a person being able to read between to point within the movie. i feel, any movie that makes me think, is a good movie. i feel foreign movies are the best films. they take you out of the typical Hollywood psyche",1495584000,,955,4.167567567567567

Depressing detail about them; however, is there's rarely a happy ending.  Particularly interesting are the dynamics between the husband & wife.  One might think both parents would not work as a team in such horrendous behavior; however, in real life, I have known a number of couples that picked one child out and behaved the same way for the rest of that child's life, even when the child becomes an adult.  The little girl gave an excellent, believable performance.  The father played a subordinate role to the mother and the actor gave a fairly good job.  However, the actress that played the mother was way over the top on bad performances.  This was the only thing kept me from giving a 5 star rating.",1488672000,4,842,4.641891891891892

7657239,1,B01BIGFZYK,"1. The acting & production are actually good, the young girl is an excellent actor (Holly Jacobson). 2. Child Abuse: Here sexual & physical (torture) are NOT appropriate subject matter for B horror movies. 3. Making a movie with 5 plot lines should be avoided (sure the makers thought they were being clever; they failed). 4. If you cut this movie down to 15 minutes it still wouldn't have enough substance to fill it. 5. If you're going to spend 90 minutes developing a black magic theme you really can't just forget about it suddenly so it has no point or purpose in the movie... obviously the makers have no idea how frustrating that is. 5. ""Lemony Snicket's: A Series of Unfortunate Events"" would be proud of the cartoon villains, but then, that is the point of THAT genre, here it is patently ridiculous. Yes, there are terribly acted B horror movies, but the actors (parents) are experienced and are directed to be cartoon villains. If it wasn't for point (2) this would be funny.

This isn't a spoiler, they show it from the very first scene.  But if you watch it all the way through I guarantee it is worth it.  Holly Jacobson is an excellent actress.  Reminds me of a young Dakota Fanning.  There is only one problem I had with this movie and it is a very minor one but I am a stickler for details.  These kids are abused and Angel has on Doc Martens.  I just wouldn't think such evil parents would buy their kids Doc Martens.  That's all.

suitable more as a training film for teachers and social workers rather than the focus of a supernatural horror film.

7657251,1,B01BIGFZYK,"Let me first say that if I could give this a zero star, I would.  Second, this is not a film for children even tho the lead character is a child.  The acting is just plain awful except for the child and her teaching assistant.  The plot is simple and the story line is spelled out almost immediately and the ending predictable.  What was not needed was the ongoing ""torture"", every detail shown, the child is made to endure.  So unless you enjoy torturing or watching the torture of animals and small children I do not recommend this movie.  Find a good zombie movie.  That would certainly not give you the nightmares this one will.",1484870400,3,632,4.443478260869565

7657253,4,B01BIGFZYK,"I found this movie quite engaging (even in the middle of the night). As for the rating, I started with a 3 starts, then changed it to 4. ( wish there had been a ""3.5"" rating.

There is nothing subtle about the plot (which is neither good nor bad). It is a plot that reminds us, as another reviewer mentions, that parents like these actually do exist (the movie Sybil, a true story based on Flora Rita Schreiber' book by the same name comes to mind).

The acting in general was OK -- good enough for a movie like this.  The mother, one of the more dramatic parts, was a bit too a ""caricature"" -- just too 2 dimensional and predictable to give us any surprises.  That is the fault of the writer more than the actress, who played her part with so much venom, the watcher may crave him/herself an poison antidote after watching it. However, I think the mother *could* have been more believable if she could have added just a bit of doubt or remorse or or a moment of kindliness -- something like that.

The reason I gave this movie 4 stars despite the above caveats, is the acting of Holly Jacobson as the mute Hannah. I found that character quite believable, well acted (a difficult part), and Hannah totally gained my support and sympathy. I was tense when she were afraid. enraged when she was the target of her sadistic parents, and (I must admit), satisfied when the parents get their comeuppence. I think, though, that, given the delight which with the mother engaged in her sadism, at her end, I found myself feeling like I were cheated out of watching a well-deserved long-drawn-out creative torture session.

But overall, this was good enough -- a bit like a cross between a ""Lifetime"" movie and a one of the better ""B"" horror movies.",1484870400,,1739,4.470031545741325

It's hard to watch a child being mistreated/abused (more psychologically than physically in most scenes) but as one who experienced worse things in my own childhood, I think it's important that people be made aware of the prevalence of it. It was spooky in places but without question, you'll end up hating these particular parents and wonder why in the holy he** they ever chose to have children in the first place.

7657282,4,B01BIGFZYK,"If you're giving this movie a low rating or not finishing the movie due to the abuse, you should know that there are millions of children suffering at the hands of abuse to even worse than this extent and this brings awareness to it.  I was one of those children and I appreciate that it does that much.  What I'm going to write won't really be spoilers as you are made aware of this all from the beginning sequences, but if you are particularly weary of any spoilers then stop reading NOW.  You have been warned.  From the get go the movie sets up what it's about and jumps right into it.  It leaves little to the imagination.  I was only confused on whether those were her real parents or not and the abnormal happenings going about around her which are explained quickly enough.  So the set-up of the environment of the movie is almost instantaneous and you don't have to drag through a lot of nothing to get to what the core of the story is from the beginning.  Yes, the parents are very hate-able as they should be to any NORMAL human beings and they SHOULD disgust you as that is the point.  Currently, as I write this review, I am 30 years old and I feel like I was NEVER given a child hood.  I was the eldest of three and we went through multiple types of abuse where I was left to be the parent to my siblings while I was four and six years older than them.  My sister also died when she was 23 years old from tragic circumstances although it was not suicide.  That all being said, this movie wasn't all that bad.  The cons are that some things aren't really completely explained thoroughly enough, it is kind of a slow burner and had a disappointment in the end.  The pros are that the child was an amazing actress throughout this movie while playing twins, the story is interesting enough to keep you going, it's bringing awareness to what some children endure on a daily basis, the complete ending (although I didn't care to much for two parts of it) does tie up the mystery pretty well and is well filmed.  There are probably more things I could say, but I think this is enough to give you an idea of what to expect.  Yes, there are supernatural elements, but you don't really get to see much of them so it isn't really a scary movie besides the abuse.",1481155200,4,2265,4.28169014084507

I see a LOT of reviewers saying they couldn't watch through the first twenty minutes, and am left wondering what kind of fairy tale childhoods THEY had, that left them incapable of viewing abuse?? I guess, since I was raised on a secluded farm, and asked to pick a switch from the rose bush for my whipping, for disrespecting my parents, and yet, STILL respect my parents, and the way they raised me , I can view ACTUAL ABUSE and ""differciate"" the two, yet avoid the truama, or PTSD, and know the difference. I actually think it's important to see movies like this, and realize, the reality of abuse, so the spoiled, selfish youth of this day, who call 911 when mommy takes their cellphone away, can see there are actually kids who live through REAL TRAUMA!!

Sure the idea of the movie was sad and the storyline was heartbreaking but it no way we're you drawn in or connected to the characters. I think it only got all the stars it got because people are afraid to say a movie about child abuse was no good. It was very lifetime-y or after school special-y. Not scary at all.

7657291,3,B01BIGFZYK,This would have been fine without the horrific scenes of abuse of the young girl.  But it is mostly well acted and an unpredictable story about twin girls whose horrible parents treat them badly just for the sake of being sadistic.,1471478400,,231,4.634146341463414
7657292,5,B01BIGFZYK,"This is a simple story of an autistic girl (Holly Jacobson) who is abused by her parents. She hears voices that tell her to do bad things, things which she ignores. She is mute by choice and is befriended by a special teacher (Petra Bryant) who sees there is something wrong at home.

This is a film with few surprises. It is a low budget project by  Mumtaz Yildirimlar who wrote, produced, directed, composed, edited and most likely served cookies between shots. The reason why I gave the film 5 stars was the convincing performance of Holly Jacobson, whose moves, eyes, and twitches were unnerving if not uncomfortable. I wouldn't be surprised if the role didn't messed her up for the rest of her life.

This is what a low budget horror should look and sound like. Note: there was no idiotic demonic voice enhancer.

8750316,5,B01BIGFZYK,"Spoilers This is a very good movie not a blood and guts horror movie . Just a quiet subtle horror movie,there are no masked killers wielding chainsaws or trapping people in death puzzles. There is possession but this is one time you actually want the character to be possessed. I noticed one reviewer said that an abused child would never have Doc Martens but considering how the parents put up a facade in public and on the surface Hannah does not look abused( the parents are careful not to leave any physical marks on Hannah) it wouldnt be that far fetched to think in order to keep up the appearance they would buy Hannah nice clothes and shoes. This is a good movie and one worth checking out.",1534204800,,698,4.4609375

8750319,5,B01BIGFZYK,"Poor kid went thru hell at the hands of her ish bag parents. I literally wanted to jump thru the screen and take care of them myself. This movie is but a shocking reminder of the hell's that some children endure or have endured at the hands of adults, only x's 10. This was extreme, but yet very poignant. You see like so many living behind carefully constructed facades, the parents conveyed a sense of conviviality to the world, but behind that and the closed doors of their home they were abusive, cruel, twisted, & utterly evil. All they cared about was themselves, and they got off on tormenting the little girl i.e. Hannah. After Angel expired under their yolk, they then focused all their debauchery/ sadism on the last thing that reminded them of her...her twin sister.
The mother was a certified, long nose, mega b'ch of ill repute, and the father was an incestuous pedophile/rapist piece of ish. Two of a kind, smh. In overview Hannah's pain and isolation opened her up to an entity that was more than willing to take up the slack for her given the proper opening. When it achieved that end, and moved to collect it was seen as an Angel ironically enough, rather than a destroyer, but make no mistake, wink, lol. Great movie, and well played.",1504051200,,1252,4.568888888888889

8750322,4,B01BIGFZYK,"**** 4 Stars **** Yes, there are some disturbing (but thankfully bloodless) scenes of physical child abuse - and the constant psychological abuse is even worse.  If this is a no-go territory for you, please skip this film.  Otherwise, this is a fine psychological / supernatural thriller, done as only the Brits can do it - the pacing and atmosphere are like classic ghost movies of the past.  The amazing child actor, Holly Jacobson, kept me riveted throughout - and she plays two roles. 'Nuff said, just watch it.  Thanks for reading.",1499904000,,536,4.793478260869565

8750324,5,B01BIGFZYK,"My Guardian Angel is a really hard film to watch.  The storyline is literally about a little girl named Hannah being humiliated, tortured and held against her will by her parents!  How much more extreme can it get for crying out loud!  The storyline teases that Hannah has extraordinary abilities and that she will ultimately get her revenge, but it takes a while for that aspect of the story to come around, and it doesn't happen like I thought.

Maybe it's just me, but I was convinced the storyline was about Hannah's parents being witches while Hannah was an angel, which explains why they treated her so poorly.  It especially seemed like the story was heading in this direction when we see the parents trap Angel, Hannah's older sister, in a shed, and she dies.  Angel says she's going to curse both her parents.  This seems to indicate the parents are witches, as does the scene when Hannah visits a fortune teller, receives a doll and tries stabbing it believing doing so in turn will make her parents suffer.  These are both strong signs that Hannah's parents are witches, but the story never comes out directly and says it.  It basically just implies it... or fools me pretty good!

But that is the story.  Without much of an explanation why, Hannah's parents treat her like an animal.  No, scratch that.  WORSE than any animal out there.  According to the parents, their daughter Hannah is pure garbage.  What are some of the things these parents do that makes them so unforgivably horrible?  In the beginning Hannah is told to go to bed by her parents who are sitting in the living room.  She returns to her bedroom only for a moment.  She comes back with a knife behind her back.  While this early on the story gives us the impression Hannah's the horrible one for attempting to stab her parents, watch what happens next!  Her punishment is being sent to bed... and tied up!  She can't move and has to sleep that way until morning.

On another occasion the mother throws scolding hot coffee at Hannah's chest when she's unsatisfied with the taste.  When Hannah runs into the other room she drops candy she was hiding in her shirt or jacket.  Just then her dad comes home from work and walks through the door.  He takes her to the basement, pretends to be a dentist and rips out her sweet tooth!  At least I think that's what happens.  I can't say for sure.  People question her bloody lip at school the next day.  Hannah screams like her life depends on it during the dental surgery, but she's helpless due to being so young.  A kid being tortured.  Talk about making viewers angry!  Seriously if you have any sympathy whatsoever, you can't help but feel for Hannah.  This is really crazy.  Later when Hannah sneaks into her parents bedroom and finds a box of her mother's dolls (apparently voodoo dolls of sorts) the mother sees what's going on.  At least the second time around- Hannah lucks out and hears her mother coming the first time.  The parents then take Hannah somewhere in the forest and tie her down inside a shed.  She has to stay there all weekend.

When Hannah attends school, well it doesn't get much better there either.  At least not by her classmates who pick on her for being so quiet.  Hannah doesn't speak at all.  At least, not until the end.  Then she REALLY lets everyone have it, haha.  But not in the way you might be thinking.  Meanwhile Hannah's mom acts like she really cares deeply for her daughter when attending teacher's conferences and wants Hannah to have the best education she can.  She even whispers into Hannah's ear on the school bench something like ""Don't tell anyone about our true intentions or we'll make your life so miserable you'll regret it for the rest of your life!""  This was another sign Hannah's mom might be a witch.

At school she has a fairly strict teacher who doesn't really sense Hannah's the victim of mental and physical abuse.  However the special help teacher, played by Petra Bryant, was abused as a child.  She reveals this during a more emotional part of the story later, and knows the signs of abuse.  Even though she gets caught in a lie pretending to be Hannah's main teacher, she's the only one who can connect and sympathize with Hannah.  Something about Petra's character... I have a crush on her!  Her accent, her looks, her caring generosity... she's just amazing to me.

SPOILERS!  It's not until Petra visits the town fortune teller that she finds out for certain just how abused Hannah is.  Hannah's quiet because the abuse has completely torn her emotional state to shreds.  This is why, even though it's just a movie, I was feeling TRUE anger towards the parents.  This is crazy, but Angel comes back from the dead to help Hannah kill their parents.  Angel is Hannah's twin.  While Hannah is tied up in the shed in the scene later on, Angel appears and begs Hannah to listen to her.  Hannah doesn't want to hurt her parents but after being tied up all weekend alone, she realizes something has to be done about this.

Her parents not only killed Angel which is bad enough, but the father did the unthinkable.  He actually had sex with Angel... and the mother didn't mind at all.  He actually brags about it to his wife!  When Hannah hears her parents having a discussion about this nasty subject, this is probably what pushes her over the edge.  Probably the only low point of the movie is the way Hannah kills her parents.  They both die the same way- Hannah takes a knife and slices their throats.  Hannah first hides in her bedroom closet, waits for her dad to open the door then... slice time!  She gets her mom in the throat a short time later.  And poor Petra *sigh*.

The story can be a little confusing near the end.  Angel's spirit enters Hannah's body to help her kill their parents.  For a little while I'm not sure if Hannah returns to herself while Angel returns to the other side, or if maybe Hannah and Angel have become a part of each other and blended as one.  I love Hannah's eyes, and her refreshing take no crap attitude when Angel takes over her body!  The story even teases a degree of uncertainty.  Awesome movie though.  The acting is terrific, and the parents are as sick and demented as they come.  The mother laughs during the ride home when she mentions pulling a fast one over the teacher bragging that she relied on the ""I lost my daughter, feel sorry for me!"" card, knowing it works every time!  I think she's worse than the father even though the father is the one doing the tormenting.  I tell ya, these are the worst parents ever.  The story is constantly exciting.  Highly recommended.",1498694400,,6615,4.552251486830926
