4042393,4,B002ZTLVVG,"Great warm-hearted fantasy romp in beautiful Iceland.  The shifts to fantasy roleplay live action were a blast.  And it was cool that Beta yelled ""Leroy Jenkins!"" before charging in alone to do battle with the heavies ;-)  Low-budget but sincere acting and a humorous romp all together.  Ragnhildur Josdottir was beautiful, completely believable as the arm-candy to a shady used car dealer who morphs into wanting someone more along the lines of her romance novels, and I thought the way she made them change her character's costume to something more kick-ass at the beginning of her first paper and pen roleplay game was great also!

Recommend as a great sorbet to the dark and serious fare that pervades most fantasy genre movies today.  ""LEROY JENKINS!!!!""  Rush in and be the first in your family/group to watch it!  And Iceland is where they film everything nowadays isn't it (next to New Zealand? lol)",1415318400,,907,4.921052631578948

4042395,5,B002ZTLVVG,Astropia was an engaging story and great acting.  The English subtitles were also well done.  Very good (and believable) character development.,1388102400,,143,5.761904761904762
4042396,4,B002ZTLVVG,"This movie starts out a bit slow, but the middle and end really make up for it. If you have never lived the ""nerd/dork"" lifestyle, then you may not get many of the jokes. But, for those of us who have, it really brings back great memories of times I used to visit stores, which in my part of town, are called ""The Guardtower"" and ""Soldiery.""

One of the things I liked most about the movie was how convincing the lead actress was in transitioning from a spoiled heiress to a beautiful nerd, and how, over time, her interactions with the other nerds go from not understanding them to, in her own way, being one of them.

If you're willing to put your thinking cap on the back burner for an hour and a half, and just enjoy the lighthearted movie for what it is, you will have a good time.",1372291200,,786,4.198675496688741
4042397,4,B002ZTLVVG,"I like when really good movies come out of nowhere and not only surprise the heck out of you, but make you wonder why someone didn't think of it earlier. Astropia is one of those movies.

Here's the scoop. Hildur is a lovely socialite living with (married to?) a guy who owns a car dealership. Her world is turned upside down when he's arrested on fraud charges. She's suddenly out of money and moves into a small apartment rented by an old friend who is now a single mother. She needs a job and, by sheer coincidence, ends up in a fantasy shop where they sell all manner of role playing games, comic books, movies, etc. A gorgeous girl like her becomes an instant hit with the local nerd population and business is up. But she actually gets to see where these odd folk are coming from and grows closer to them. When hubby breaks out of jail and kidnaps her (for a particular reason) they must come to her rescue.

This Icelandic (Norwegian?) production is an out and out riot. The story line makes its own goofy kind of sense and has a kind, kind heart. You like both her and the nerds. They are a decent bunch of people. They care for one another and though they sometimes scold each other for various reasons, they would never harm each other. She ends up becoming part of the crew and genuinely begins to enjoy playing the role playing games and is able to turn her enthusiasm into sales for the store.

This is a modest production but good enough to get things done. It was interesting to see how Americanized certain aspects were. They used many American expressions spoken in English and were into American games, films and comic books. I also liked how certain shots were frozen and transformed into comic book panels. The fantasy scenes were a bit dark but I suspect that was a budgetary concern. What works here is the script. It was a pleasure to see these people come together and for her to realize money isn't everything. The value of having good friends and putting in a hard day's work came to mean something to her.

This is a wonderful little gem. If you're at all into this sort of thing this is about as good as they come.",1357171200,2,2142,4.401515151515151
4042398,5,B002ZTLVVG,"""Astropia"" is an Icelandic film about tabletop role-playing games. The premise is simple enough: pretty rich girl's fortunes turn sour, forcing her to work as a clerk in a game store. It's ""Clueless"" meets ""Clerks."" But ""Astropia"" is so much more than that.

Hildur (Ragnhildur Steinunn Jonsdottir) is the trophy girlfriend of slimy car dealer who isn't afraid to use hot chicks and foolish stunts to wow his customers. When government agents storm his office and demand his files, it's not long before Jolli (David Por Jonsson) is arrested, his car impounded, and his property cordoned off. Hildur is left out in the cold with no life skills to survive on her own. She moves in with her plainer sister Bjort (Sara Gudmundsdotti) and her cute son Snorri (Alexander Sigurdsson). Her visits to Jolli are punctuated by his demands for more cigarettes, which he uses as a bargaining tool to orchestrate his escape from prison. It's clear Hildur needs to get a job, fast.

Throughout ""Astropia"" is interspersed fantasy comic sequences that detail the possible futures of what the job hunt might look like. Hildur settles on a game store because they need the help immediately. Predictably, the store's male customers vie for her attention, purchasing entire game collections to win her favor. And just like that Hildur has a job selling role-playing games. Of course, Hildur has no idea what she's actually selling, so it's not long before she finally decides to play. Then the fun really starts.

""Astropia"" is a low-budget production, but saves its pennies up for a variety of fantasy sequences as each of the players' counterparts travels across rugged landscapes, bickers incessantly, and kills monsters. There's the elven ranger played by Dagur (Snorri Engilbertsson), the dwarf barbarian played by Beta (Halla Vilhalsmdottir), and of course Hildur's two-bladed fighter. A cast of supporting characters represents the full range of fandom, from Jedis to Matrix agents.

Unlike other films that have geeks as love interests without explaining what makes them appealing, Dagur intrigues Hildur because he translates romance novels into English and teaches dance classes to the elderly. In other words, he's not just a gamer geek, but has the full panoply of traits that makes role-playing appeal to his sensibilities. Dagur is more well-rounded than Hildur is.

The ending culminates in a conflict between reality and fantasy once Jolli finally escapes and demands Hildur flee the country with him. The collective geeks assemble to rescue her, but it's all filmed through the lens of a stirring sword-and-sorcery epic. This clever device leaves us to guess what's really happening, making the concluding sequence a fun game for the audience too.

Although ""Astropia"" is occasionally silly, it treats all of its characters with respect without flinching from the uglier sides of geekdom. When Floki threatens Snorri's innocence by sharing a series of horror movies with the boy, Floki gets a well-deserved tongue lashing from Snorri's mother. ""Astropia"" understands that while fantasy has its place, there's a time and place for everything.

Few movies do role-playing games justice. Leave to an Icelandic film to make fantasy gaming cool again.",1339891200,11,3242,5.223076923076923
4042399,4,B002ZTLVVG,"Astropia, or Dorks and Damsels as the horrible English title, is a movie that succeeds at exactly what it set out to do. Poke fun at geek and gamer culture.

As the other reviewers have said the effects are low budget and the English subtitles leave a little to be desired. I would venture that the low budget effects only add to the film. In all its campy glory the movie manages to spoof or pay homage to many classics. In some form or another the movie references or makes a nod to: Romancing the Stone, The Shawshank Redemption (in the rather ridiculous prison break scenes), The Matrix, Star Wars, Star Trek, Many classic anime (Akira, Ghost In the Shell, My Neighbor Totoro, Howls Moving Castle), The Exorcist, Poltergeist, Joss Whedon, and of course many RPG and Geek/Nerd tropes.

The actual plot of the movie is quite predictable offering very little in the way of surprises. I would imagine people who are not as familiar with geek or gamer culture will not find this movie as entertaining. Fans of other similar titles such as The Gamers should find this movie thoroughly funny and a good watch.

On a side note: I watched this on Amazon Instant Video so I am not able to comment on the DVD itself. As one other reviewer pointed out the DVD seems to be low quality. The video quality on the Instant Video was up to snuff in my opinion.",1304294400,,1346,4.485714285714286
4042400,3,B002ZTLVVG,"I really wish I could say that I'm glad that this got an English/US release, give it four stars, and leave it at that, because that's what I feel the movie itself deserves.  I can't do that, though.

The good news is that it's entertaining, they manage to make it work without feeling like the relatively low budget is holding it back, and spotting the constant references to things in the dialog and on set will keep most nerds amused from beginning to end.  I was a little worried half an hour in when I thought, ""Icelandic Paris Hilton just got a job working with the Icelandic version of the guys from Clerks...there are so many ways this could go wrong,"" but it manages the unusual feat of poking fun at both the nerds and the (initially) ditzy blonde without looking down on or being mean to either side.

The plot is fairly straightforward ""dork meets ditz: wacky hijinks ensue"", but the way it's presented keeps it fun, and the two colliding subcultures each come to understand each other.  The nerds are human after all and (some of them) have some depth and personality and interests beyond the stereotypes they first appear to be, and the airhead isn't actually stupid, just unfamiliar with their world.  The story that ties it all together (girl's boyfriend is arrested, forcing her to get a job with the nerdy guys; he escapes, and the good guys have to work together to save the day) is largely just an excuse to put the characters in the silly situations the humor comes from, but it does its job, and the way it's resolved in the climax is a clever way to stay within budget and also not have to bother explaining how a bunch of stuff is even possible (and, of course, to fit several more RPG jokes in).

Now, the bad news.  This is probably the lowest quality professionally-produced/released DVD I've ever seen in my life.  The video is 16:9, but it's presented in 4:3 letterbox.  Fine, I can live with that and push the zoom/crop button to make it fill the screen...except the subtitles are baked into the video track(!), so if you do that you can't see what people are saying anymore.  On top of that, the video seems to be a pretty crappy transfer, too.  The translation is ok, but there are several places where random lines aren't translated at all, the timing of the subtitles is fairly arbitrary, and the translator seems to have missed some of the jokes, not caught some references, and/or just goofed in places (you, too, can cringe when you see ""Josh Whedon"" come up).

Short version: Four stars for the movie, and two for the presentation.  It would benefit a lot from a better transfer and subbing job, but it's still enjoyable in this state, and at least an English version even exists in the first place.  It's definitely fun and worth watching if you're an RPGer or like geek subculture humor, but I have a hard time recommending it without reservations at the price they're asking.",1293494400,6,2915,4.568138195777351
4042401,4,B002ZTLVVG,"To all of you gamers out there --

What if an attractive woman acidentally started working in a gaming shop?

Don't be offended by the premise; this is a comedy, and an affectionate one at that.  There are tons of inside jokes about gaming and RPGs that just shouldn't go to waste.

There's an overarching plot about a businessman (the protagonist's boyfriend) going to prison, but the fun is all in the shop called Astropia.

Evidently this was the top-grossing film in Iceland in 2007.  It's a lot of fun and a great choice for one of those gaming nights when the GM's been too busy to prep an adventure.",1281744000,6,606,4.463636363636364
4042402,4,B002ZTLVVG,"It's not a huge budget movie and at least the version I saw, it's in Icelandic language, but I found it a rather cute and original movie!

The main heroine finds herself in a bit of a pickle when her boyfriend is arrested, presumably for cooking the books of his business. She moves in with afriend or a sister, I don't remember which because it's been a couple months since I saw the movie, and I only saw it once, but when this friend pushes her to get a job, she finally finds an RPG/comic store called Astropia, where she's hired staight away. Of course you can't really work at an RPG store without playing, so she gets talked into it and of course finds she likes it and makes new friends!

I won't give away too much of the ending but it culminates into a final battle between her, her new found friends, and her exboyfriend and some goons he broke out with in a very humorous way!

It's a fun movie for the whole family, or at least those who can read as you have to read the subtitles, unless there's a dubbed version out there somewhere.",1278633600,3,1047,4.251256281407035

8385317,2,B002ZTLVVG,"I found the pair of protagonists either unlikeable, stupid, or both. The storyline thus far is rather boring, and basically humorless. I lasted just 10 minutes. 2 stars.",1475539200,,169,5.071428571428571
8385318,4,B002ZTLVVG,"As far as movies go, Astropia is a fairly well done example of a romantic comedy. The acting is enjoyable, the story is fun, and if  you enjoy rolling dice then there's enough material to add to the entertainment without mocking the hobbies. The only place where it fell short of what I was hoping, was the ending, which seemed somewhat unfinished. Ultimately it's a good movie and I'd recommend it.",1466899200,,399,4.619718309859155

8385324,5,B002ZTLVVG,"This is a Scandinavian film with English subtitles.

It is about the girlfriend of a slimy, good looking businessman that is taking part in criminal activities.

Our heroine finds herself without funds and without skills, but, when she stumbles into an RPG shop - the customers take notice and business takes off.

She doesn't know anything about role-playing, but the store owner and his assistants invite her to play.

From that point on in the movie, you move between the real world and the gaming world - sometimes in mid-scene.

There is a sub-plot with her evil boyfriend escaping from prison and the gamers defeating the criminals, but it is a silly as it sounds.

I'm a B-grade movie fan, and this one is both fun and presents gamers in a reasonable way.",1444348800,,762,4.69172932330827
8385325,4,B002ZTLVVG,"This is a fun film! It is well-worth the trouble of having to read sub-titles and watch scenes unfold at the same time.
