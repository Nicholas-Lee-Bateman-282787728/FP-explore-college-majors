2982972,3,B000WLU5ZM,The made for TV movies of Alien nations are really hokey. The plots and story lines are poorly written and obvious to the viewer.,1431302400,,129,4.416666666666667

Of course it's dated, but for the sci fi buff this is a great revisit. I'm glad to hear it might be rebooted. Also, love seeing folks like Angela Bassett, Kristin Davis, and many other young actors clearly in their bit part phase.",1430438400,4,349,4.46875

2982976,5,B000WLU5ZM,"Still one of my all-time favorite TV programs, and high on my list of It's-A-Crying-Shame-Some-Suit-Cancelled-This-Show-Prematurely.

The writers of this series created such an intriguing culture for their aliens.  You never knew where they were going to take their characters next.  That, coupled with excellent performances by the main players, left me with memories of an alternative world that feels almost real.  I will love George Francisco forever.

Although burned on both sides of the disc, so far these have held up well.  They are subjected to the periodic marathon.  I only regret there are so very few episodes.  This rich story deserved a longer telling.",1429488000,10,668,5.295238095238095
2982977,5,B000WLU5ZM,"This set includes all four of the made for TV movies. The first, ""Dark Horizon,"" picks up where the series left off. If you excuse a couple of continuity errors (in the series George was at home at the end, in the movie he is away at the start) it's like the series wasn't canceled. Sikes and Francisco not only search for a cure for the Newcomer virus but they fight against a ruthless Overseer who is sent to Earth to return the Tenctonese to slavery and maybe take humanity with them.
""Body and Soul,"" is a TV-14 movie (my rating because the rating system had not started yet) because it explores sexuality as Sikes and his Newcomer love interest must learn about inter-species physiology. (In a screening at an inter-species sex clinic Sikes is asked how long his penis is when erect. It makes for a funny scene but it's not for the kids.)
""Millennium"" is a study of false religion. Buck is drawn into a deadly cult. Sikes and Francisco must save Buck and the many human victims from the the technological flim-flamming Newcomers who would led them into the deadly beyond. Although this movie is titled ""Mellennium"" there is little of the Y2K panic.
""The Enemy Within"" is a study of prejudice beyond the normal story-line. Francisco must face his prejudice as he investigates the death of an Eeno, a member of the untouchable cast of Tenctonese waste-eaters.
""The Udura Legacy"" presents us with the battle of situation ethics as law-abiding Newcomers commit violent crimes and reveal the reassurance of the Udara, a Tenctonese extremest movement dedicated to the overthrowing of the Overseers at any cost.
All the original cast is back but the movies are better overall than the series because of a bigger budget. You get a commentary with all the movies and a ""The Making of.."" featurette for the first four films and a gathering of the director and actors for a look back on Alien Nation.
If you liked the series you'll like the movies. Only one question remains unanswered, ""What happened with Buck and his teacher?"" Well, whatever it was it mast have been bad because he really carries a chip on his shoulder for the humans.",1428105600,13,2132,4.688

Two movies that only played this is a rip off,
someone better get there acts together and this is a great movie collection so this all sucks because we could not watch the last three movies were all about
So watch out if sold by someone else because you never know who is going to rip you off and also

2982993,5,B000WLU5ZM,I've always loved this show and only saw 1 of the movies so I didn't know there were more. The movies are amazing because it's all the original people from the show (no changes) and it's basically the same as the show they just take bigger and more mysterious problems and make them longer. :),1408320000,,293,4.345454545454546
2982994,5,B000WLU5ZM,"Unlike a number of other scifi/fantasy series from the 80's, Alien Nation has held up really well.  I just rewatched the series and the movies and was captivated and pulled into that world all over again.  The writing is good and the films continue the story.  It's clear that the characters and the actors portraying them have rapport and chemistry with each other.  Really easy to watch.  I'm sorry this series didn't get at least a second season when it originally aired. I confess to loving 80s fashion style - the wardrobe guys must had a field day with this show - I loved seeing those clothes again, too!  :-D",1406851200,3,616,4.554545454545455

2982998,5,B000WLU5ZM,It was all the movies that were made after the series was cancelled. Very interesting stories. I would suggest it to any fan of Alien Nation!,1402012800,,141,4.461538461538462
2982999,5,B000WLU5ZM,"I was a fan of the show, and while the entire series is available at a fair price I was more interested in just seeing how it all ended.
As with so many good science fiction series they general public just doesn't get it and as a result the series is terminated early.
It is to our good fortune that a set of 5 movies 'continued' the series and resolved the loose ends.
With out giving the ending away (I suspect it will not be what you expect) it was done with thought and clever writing to give us closure!

Enjoy.",1401753600,,516,4.108910891089109

2983001,5,B000WLU5ZM,"I remembered this show when it first came out. I found it hard to believe it was only on for 1 season, and then they made 5 movies that continued where they left off in the series. every movie was great, and it surprised me how many social issues they covered that we still battle today. woth every penny.",1400371200,2,305,4.186440677966102

2983003,5,B000WLU5ZM,"When the Alien Nation series ended in 1990 with the cliffhanger, I was very upset.  I just found out recently that these made for TV movies exist and was really looking forward to seeing them.  These movies do not disappoint and are every bit as good and humorous as the series.  The stories are very inventive and the acting is excellent as usual.  I wish there were more movies, or that the TV series would come back.",1388880000,2,419,4.402597402597403
2983004,4,B000WLU5ZM,Love this series and the movies fit well with the TV show.  I especially love how they show the development between Matt and Cathy (the alien).  If you are a fan of the tv series these movies will fill out the background and character development.,1386201600,,247,4.466666666666667
2983005,5,B000WLU5ZM,"Not widely screened outside the United States, Alien Nation remains a unique and excellent example of the genre, exploring an alien culture, and its interaction with period American culture. Less appreciated by the unfamiliar, is that many later SF series borrowed numerous ideas and plot devices from Alien Nation. Sadly the series was prematurely terminated, and was worthy of a multiyear run.",1383264000,2,395,5.387096774193548
2983006,5,B000WLU5ZM,"A work colleague of mine drew my attention to Alien Nation back in 1989, and I was immediately hooked.  One of the movies in this set picks up where the TV series left off: With George's family gravely ill.

The show has a lot of race relations type of topics interwoven into it in general, It ends up leaving the viewer thinking about how they treat others.",1382140800,,358,4.3283582089552235

2983009,5,B000WLU5ZM,Loved the movies.  Word of advice:  do not watch the first movie (Dark Horizon) right after seeing the last TV episode.  They changed some things it was confusing.  Had to replace the dvd's due to picture quality.,1370995200,,213,4.675675675675675

It's definitely worth owning. I love that it picks up right where the series left off.  I wish the show had gone on longer!  This is a MUST own for any fan of the show!",1360713600,,431,4.168674698795181

2983018,5,B000WLU5ZM,"Been waiting for the movies to come to DVD. Dark Horizon wraps up the TV Series nicely. DH also resolves another episode when they send a message out to space and DH tells us what happened. Millennium I consider to be the weakest of the movie series but saying that it does link to another episode and the portal effects where great. Body and Soul injects a little humour with the ""B' story. Where it moves into a topic which was inevitable considering the premise of the series. Udara Legacy (the final movie) which gives a little more insight into Tactonese life on the ship and the idea of a resistance movement (not unheard of in oppressive regimes). This plot line and Buck's side story makes Udara Legacy one of my favourite movies.",1317081600,,738,4.556390977443609
2983019,5,B000WLU5ZM,"The first movie picks up right where the TV series ended, kudos to Kenny Johnson for doing this!  It brings the fans to the place they know, and finishes up the cliff hanger from the spring of 1990.  All the majors reprise their roles.  A very well done piece of work.

All the movies are great!  Alien Nation was a very forward thinking TV program for its time! It had it all! It looked at serious issues, had police drama, romance, sy-fi.  There are plenty of comedic moments to releave tension!

All the outdoor sequences are actually filmed in and around Los Angles.  No phoney looking studio back-lot streets.

Its testosterone pumping action sequences were couterbalanced by very real and poignant interaction between the characters that anyone, human or alien could identify with.  The lead character, tough-guy, detective sgt Matt Sykes(played by Gary Graham) discovers his own humanity by his association with the Newcomers.

I recommend both this collection, and the TV Show collection for anyone interested in Sy-Fi drama, romance, police-action & comedy.",1316131200,2,1066,5.068965517241379
2983020,5,B000WLU5ZM,This is an excellent DVD. The movies are very good and these help wrap up the series in an excellent way.,1314316800,,105,4.0476190476190474
2983021,4,B000WLU5ZM,"This has all the Alien Nation movies. If you own the series, this is a must-have to finish the season ending.  Dark Horizon is the best one and the season ending. Just for that one movie, it's well worth the money. Body and Soul is pretty good, especially if you want to see Sikes and Cathy trying to reconcile their feelings.  It holds up the best of the series episodes.

Millenium is ok and watchable.  The Udara Legacy has issues.  I didn't like it.  I never saw it on tv, so I went in cold on that. I guess it was ok, but I didn't care much for it.  The Enemy Within was awful.  It shouldn't have been made and it was a wasted effort to watch.

Of the 5 movies, 2 were well worth the price.  One was tolerable and one was barely tolerable.  The last one was awful.  It took the worst of the old B movies and wallowed in it.  I'm still glad I got the collection, just for Dark Horizon, Body and Soul, and Millenium.  If they were sold separately, I'd have bought them.  If Udara and Enemy Within were sold separately, not a chance.",1310169600,,1035,4.130653266331659

These movies were all satisfying and wrapped the series up nicely, but I'd still like to have at least one more series of Alien Nation. It wasn't just TVSF. It was a good drama and a good family show.",1305849600,,449,4.294117647058823

This collection is the best. They have behind the scenes and a gag reel plus one DVD has a reunion with the cast and that was great to watch. This is for any Alien Nation fan.",1278460800,2,332,3.757142857142857
2983027,5,B000WLU5ZM,"I watched the series and movies when they were originally on TV and always mentioned them as one of my favorites.
This year I purchased the series on DVD and while I still enjoyed it, I found a number of weak episodes and repetition in situations.  I didn't purchase this made for TV movie set at first because the price was more than I could afford to spend.  However, once Amazon dropped the price I bought it right away.
Wow, what a difference b/w these movies and the show.  These movies are so well done. While some of the special effects look a bit dated, the story and characters are quite good and you can see how much better this series is with a bit more time and money thrown at it.
The extras are fine, too.  I don't know what else they could add in there for a show that's been dead for a while, but I'm certainly happy with the purchase.
Even if you've never watched Alien Nation the series, but like Sci-Fi, I think you'd really enjoy these movies!",1277942400,4,963,4.274725274725275

I didn't remember the movies before I bought this collection, but after watching them I started remembering parts of each of the movies. I thought they all were really good. Too bad the suits in Hollywood don't have a clue what's good and what isn't. The quality to me was really good too. I do have an up-converting dvd player and I thought all the movies looked pretty good. I haven't seen Blue Ray dvd's yet and I'm sure they're nowhere near that quality, but I'm used to some pretty bad cable tv reception over the years and was very pleased over all.

2983037,5,B000WLU5ZM,"Alien Nation is one of the best science fiction shows to grace television.  It's main theme is to teach us the folly of prejudice.  And a wonderful job it does, too!

The best science fiction doesn't scream SCIENCE FICTION in your face.  It tells us an interesting story to which we can relate and involves us with the characters and their situations.  Alien Nation certainly accomplishes that.  Even with the unusual traditions, physiological differences and bald, spotted heads - not to mention their excellent language - the Tenctonese people are very human in both their similarities and their infinite diversity.

The series was a delight to watch and many of us were crushed when it ended, especially with some cliffhangers.  Then - SURPRISE! - about 5 years later, the first movie came out.  Of course we didn't know it was the first of five, but we were all VERY happy that we would finally know what happens to Susan and Emily. Will Matt and Cathy will ever begin their relationship for real?  The first movie ""Dark Horizons"" answers these questions and many more.

All of the five movies were well scripted, beautifully acted, interesting and believable stories (from the we-believe-in-this-universe point of view) and stayed true to the established characters and events.  The production values were wonderful and we managed to get all the most important questions answered before it all ended.

This 5-movie DVD set is also great because EVERY movie has commentary, at least one featurette (like a ""Making of"" or a cast reunion reel), a gag reel AND still galleries.  There are also a few other bonuses.  Excellent bonus material fare!

If you love Alien Nation, this set is great!  If you haven't seen it, please check into it, because the ride is worthwhile.",1223769600,13,1772,4.912457912457913

2983039,4,B000WLU5ZM,"This series of films was advertised as picking up exactly where the TV series left off, so I was expecting it to begin with George and all members of the family to be in intensive care, stuggling to survive against the Tenctonese specific virus they all inhaled from the flowers delivered towards the end of the series finale.  For some reason, the makers/writers completely re-wrote this scenario so that George was never infected - why?  Do the writers think that fans are stupid, perhaps even suffering from selective amnesia, and don't actually notice all of these glaringly obvious inconsistencies?  I find this incredibly irritating, hence the rating of 4 instead of 5. For all that, I still enjoyed these films and despair of the networks ever listening to the viewers.  They kill off perfectly good programmes like Alien Nation, Threshold, Blood Ties, Dresden Files, Firefly and many more, long before they are dead and continue to fill our screens with stuff like Lost and 24 which were only good for one series in the first place.

Eric Peirpoint was once again the fine newcomer cop paired with an out of his element human cop played by Gary Graham.  Both of these men kept the flavor of Alien Nation, and still made it seem like a buddy movie. (A la Leathel Weapon)  Hopefully, some day there might be another one, I hope, if not; I would love to see Graham and Peirpoint work together again.

2983052,5,B000WLU5ZM,"Dark Horizon is on its own disc. The other four movies are on 2 flipper discs--one movie per side. All the movies have a Ken Johnson commentary track. The first four movies have ""Making of"" featurettes that are a bit dry, but have some great nuggets. The first four also have gag reels. All the movies have a wide of array of stills in a photo gallery.

The last movie's disc side includes a 25-minute reunion taped at Johnson's home in January 2007. Everyone's there except for Sean Six/Buck. It's amazing! I got a warm feeling just watching! It opens with candid meet and greets and sitting down to a meal. They gather in a circle next, and really start to talk. The actors talk about being cast, about make-up, about the movies, and about the reaction from various ethnic groups, among other things. There are some great behind-the-scenes shots from the original series that I've never seen anywhere else.

Dark Horizon is fine, but man, were they hitting on all four cylinders for the second movie--Body and Soul. It features an excellent story and script, a satisfying Matt and Cathy story, and a few twists and turns that you won't expect. Everything that made the series great is on display in the second movie--the comic timing, the chemistry between the actors, the jokes, the names, you name it, it's there--it's like a time machine back to the good old days of the show's weekly run.  The last three are just as good--the atmosphere and feeling of the season is there in full force.  I wasn't crazy about George's promotion at the end of the original series because it wrecked the detectives' dynamic, but found that they dealt with it very well in the movies for both characters.

Buck and Emily don't have much to do in the first two movies, but they come into their own in the last three. Cathy and Matt's romance evolves beautifully throughout.  If you think of the five movies as 10 episodes of Alien Nation--it's like a whole half season.

Pocket put out 8 Alien Nation novels and novelizations back in the day, so we had those to get over the cliffhanger when the complete series set came out a couple of years ago. But that wasn't good enough, frankly. Thank goodness these are on dvd at last! Now we really have the complete series available on dvd.",1202083200,112,2269,4.601485148514851

I think it proves without a doubt how strong the show was when it inspires five made for tv movies.  That is pretty solid.  I loved the theatrical movie a heck of a lot when it came out and it is nice to have the entire pantheon of Alien Nation all together.  Each movie is better than the last and it is too bad there aren't more still coming out.  I would watch them if they made them.

These five movies feature all of the humor and sly subversiveness of the original prematurely-canceled TV show, while expanding and completing the Alien Nation universe.

3217473,5,B000WLU5ZM,"Still one of my all-time favorite TV programs, and high on my list of It's-A-Crying-Shame-Some-Suit-Cancelled-This-Show-Prematurely.

The writers of this series created such an intriguing culture for their aliens.  You never knew where they were going to take their characters next.  That, coupled with excellent performances by the main players, left me with memories of an alternative world that feels almost real.  I will love George Francisco forever.

Although burned on both sides of the disc, so far these have held up well.  They are subjected to the periodic marathon.  I only regret there are so very few episodes.  This rich story deserved a longer telling.",1429488000,10,668,5.295238095238095
3217474,5,B000WLU5ZM,"This set includes all four of the made for TV movies. The first, ""Dark Horizon,"" picks up where the series left off. If you excuse a couple of continuity errors (in the series George was at home at the end, in the movie he is away at the start) it's like the series wasn't canceled. Sikes and Francisco not only search for a cure for the Newcomer virus but they fight against a ruthless Overseer who is sent to Earth to return the Tenctonese to slavery and maybe take humanity with them.
""Body and Soul,"" is a TV-14 movie (my rating because the rating system had not started yet) because it explores sexuality as Sikes and his Newcomer love interest must learn about inter-species physiology. (In a screening at an inter-species sex clinic Sikes is asked how long his penis is when erect. It makes for a funny scene but it's not for the kids.)
""Millennium"" is a study of false religion. Buck is drawn into a deadly cult. Sikes and Francisco must save Buck and the many human victims from the the technological flim-flamming Newcomers who would led them into the deadly beyond. Although this movie is titled ""Mellennium"" there is little of the Y2K panic.
""The Enemy Within"" is a study of prejudice beyond the normal story-line. Francisco must face his prejudice as he investigates the death of an Eeno, a member of the untouchable cast of Tenctonese waste-eaters.
""The Udura Legacy"" presents us with the battle of situation ethics as law-abiding Newcomers commit violent crimes and reveal the reassurance of the Udara, a Tenctonese extremest movement dedicated to the overthrowing of the Overseers at any cost.
All the original cast is back but the movies are better overall than the series because of a bigger budget. You get a commentary with all the movies and a ""The Making of.."" featurette for the first four films and a gathering of the director and actors for a look back on Alien Nation.
If you liked the series you'll like the movies. Only one question remains unanswered, ""What happened with Buck and his teacher?"" Well, whatever it was it mast have been bad because he really carries a chip on his shoulder for the humans.",1428105600,13,2132,4.688

Body and Soul injects a little humour with the ""B' story. Where it moves into a topic which was inevitable considering the premise of the series. Udara Legacy (the final movie) which gives a little more insight into Tactonese life on the ship and the idea of a resistance movement (not unheard of in oppressive regimes).

All the movies are great!  Alien Nation was a very forward thinking TV program for its time! It had it all! It looked at serious issues, had police drama, romance, sy-fi.  There are plenty of comedic moments to releave tension!

All the outdoor sequences are actually filmed in and around Los Angles.  No phoney looking studio back-lot streets.

Its testosterone pumping action sequences were couterbalanced by very real and poignant interaction between the characters that anyone, human or alien could identify with.

Just for that one movie, it's well worth the money. Body and Soul is pretty good, especially if you want to see Sikes and Cathy trying to reconcile their feelings.  It holds up the best of the series episodes.

Millenium is ok and watchable.  The Udara Legacy has issues.  I didn't like it.  I never saw it on tv, so I went in cold on that. I guess it was ok, but I didn't care much for it.  The Enemy Within was awful.  It shouldn't have been made and it was a wasted effort to watch.

Of the 5 movies, 2 were well worth the price.  One was tolerable and one was barely tolerable.  The last one was awful.  It took the worst of the old B movies and wallowed in it.

3217534,5,B000WLU5ZM,"Alien Nation is one of the best science fiction shows to grace television.  It's main theme is to teach us the folly of prejudice.  And a wonderful job it does, too!

The best science fiction doesn't scream SCIENCE FICTION in your face.  It tells us an interesting story to which we can relate and involves us with the characters and their situations.  Alien Nation certainly accomplishes that.  Even with the unusual traditions, physiological differences and bald, spotted heads - not to mention their excellent language - the Tenctonese people are very human in both their similarities and their infinite diversity.

The series was a delight to watch and many of us were crushed when it ended, especially with some cliffhangers.  Then - SURPRISE! - about 5 years later, the first movie came out.  Of course we didn't know it was the first of five, but we were all VERY happy that we would finally know what happens to Susan and Emily. Will Matt and Cathy will ever begin their relationship for real?  The first movie ""Dark Horizons"" answers these questions and many more.

All of the five movies were well scripted, beautifully acted, interesting and believable stories (from the we-believe-in-this-universe point of view) and stayed true to the established characters and events.  The production values were wonderful and we managed to get all the most important questions answered before it all ended.

This 5-movie DVD set is also great because EVERY movie has commentary, at least one featurette (like a ""Making of"" or a cast reunion reel), a gag reel AND still galleries.  There are also a few other bonuses.  Excellent bonus material fare!

Do the writers think that fans are stupid, perhaps even suffering from selective amnesia, and don't actually notice all of these glaringly obvious inconsistencies?  I find this incredibly irritating, hence the rating of 4 instead of 5. For all that, I still enjoyed these films and despair of the networks ever listening to the viewers.  They kill off perfectly good programmes like Alien Nation, Threshold, Blood Ties, Dresden Files, Firefly and many more, long before they are dead and continue to fill our screens with stuff like Lost and 24 which were only good for one series in the first place.  I highly recommend these films, they are great entertainment!!!!",1220745600,4,1106,4.956756756756757

(May there person who did that rot in hell.) All five films kept the flavor of the series. Eric Peirpoint was once again the fine newcomer cop paired with an out of his element human cop played by Gary Graham.  Both of these men kept the flavor of Alien Nation, and still made it seem like a buddy movie. (A la Leathel Weapon)  Hopefully, some day there might be another one, I hope, if not; I would love to see Graham and Peirpoint work together again.

3217549,5,B000WLU5ZM,"Dark Horizon is on its own disc. The other four movies are on 2 flipper discs--one movie per side. All the movies have a Ken Johnson commentary track. The first four movies have ""Making of"" featurettes that are a bit dry, but have some great nuggets. The first four also have gag reels. All the movies have a wide of array of stills in a photo gallery.

The last movie's disc side includes a 25-minute reunion taped at Johnson's home in January 2007. Everyone's there except for Sean Six/Buck. It's amazing! I got a warm feeling just watching! It opens with candid meet and greets and sitting down to a meal. They gather in a circle next, and really start to talk. The actors talk about being cast, about make-up, about the movies, and about the reaction from various ethnic groups, among other things. There are some great behind-the-scenes shots from the original series that I've never seen anywhere else.

Dark Horizon is fine, but man, were they hitting on all four cylinders for the second movie--Body and Soul. It features an excellent story and script, a satisfying Matt and Cathy story, and a few twists and turns that you won't expect. Everything that made the series great is on display in the second movie--the comic timing, the chemistry between the actors, the jokes, the names, you name it, it's there--it's like a time machine back to the good old days of the show's weekly run.  The last three are just as good--the atmosphere and feeling of the season is there in full force.  I wasn't crazy about George's promotion at the end of the original series because it wrecked the detectives' dynamic, but found that they dealt with it very well in the movies for both characters.

Buck and Emily don't have much to do in the first two movies, but they come into their own in the last three. Cathy and Matt's romance evolves beautifully throughout.  If you think of the five movies as 10 episodes of Alien Nation--it's like a whole half season.

Pocket put out 8 Alien Nation novels and novelizations back in the day, so we had those to get over the cliffhanger when the complete series set came out a couple of years ago. But that wasn't good enough, frankly. Thank goodness these are on dvd at last! Now we really have the complete series available on dvd.",1202083200,112,2269,4.601485148514851

The show was better than I remembered after not seeing it for fifteen years.  And these films pick up right where the series left off.

I think it proves without a doubt how strong the show was when it inspires five made for tv movies.  That is pretty solid.  I loved the theatrical movie a heck of a lot when it came out and it is nice to have the entire pantheon of Alien Nation all together.  Each movie is better than the last and it is too bad there aren't more still coming out.  I would watch them if they made them.

The numerous featurettes are great and a surprise addition to this DVD boxed set.  I loved the behind the scenes reunion with the cast filmed just a year ago.

Ten years after the last special, the five Alien Nation made-for-TV movies have been collected and released in a very nice boxed set with lots of cool extras (gag reels, 2007 cast reunion featurette, commentaries, ""making of"" backstage footage).  These five movies feature all of the humor and sly subversiveness of the original prematurely-canceled TV show, while expanding and completing the Alien Nation universe.

Because they were only TV movies instead of theatrical, some of the special effects are a bit cheesy (to say the least) but that hardly detracts from the pleasure of finally completing the collection.
