I enjoyed the visual aspect of the Vampire lore, with out the ususal cheesiness of most Vampire specials. A must add to any Vampire Lore Collection.",1214092800,,298,4.537037037037037
7798796,5,1575235471,"An excellent look at the history of the vampire. 100 minutes of history and Hollywood. TLC did this special in 1996. Interviews with authors/vampire authorities and actors such as Lara Parker (Dark Shadows), Chris Sarandon (Fright Night) and Bela Lugosi, Jr. Covers Dracula and vampires in the movies: Lugosi, Hammer Films and Christopher Lee. Also looks at vampires on TV: Dark Shadows and Forever Knight. Moves along well with lots of info for horror/vampire buffs. This should be on DVD.",1182297600,,490,5.1375
