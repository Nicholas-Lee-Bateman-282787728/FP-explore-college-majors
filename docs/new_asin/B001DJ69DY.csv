3531798,3,B001DJ69DY,"I wanted this for my class and I do use them.  The overall visuals and information are good - however, there are some things that keep it from being exactly what I needed.  First, the accents and terms used by the guides can be hard for my students to get past.  They are distracting.  Second, a teacher has to be careful to view ahead of time to edit - one on Argentina is great and then she shows a cow being butchered - guts flowing, etc.  I know they are famous for their meat, but we didn't need that.  Or another who takes us to the market and then throws in 'papaya is good for love making'.  The market was great - that was stupid to add.",1285891200,6,646,4.039370078740157
3531799,5,B001DJ69DY,"Whether for entertainment, travel planning, or, as in my case, use as an educational tool, the Globe-Trekker series can be a valuable asset to one's personal or professional libraries.  These films are obviously produced by professionals who know film-making well from writing, to filming, to editing and the likes.  The content and narration by the delightfully youthful and witty hosts encorporate a rich array of cultural and geographical facts and provide insight into lands and people groups far beyond what most tourists or classroom teachers or students would ever experience on their own.  I am carefully reviewing every episode and finding ways to incorporate them into my Spanish language and Latin American cultures curricula.

3531800,4,B001DJ69DY,I show these videos in my Spanish class and my students learn information and seem to really enjoy them. Be sure to preview them as the Brazil ones (as you could imagine) may have some images that wouldn't be appropriate for all ages.,1275264000,2,234,4.465116279069767
3531801,5,B001DJ69DY,"I will be retiring soon and do not plan to visit South America.  However, I wanted to know more about it visually rather than just by reading a Book.  I must say that these DVD's were very enlightening and enjoyable.  I highly recommend them.",1273190400,,242,4.454545454545454
3531802,4,B001DJ69DY,"The Lonely Planet travel series is different from many of the other travel series such as Rick Steves, Samantha Brown and so on.  Each episode is a little quirky.  It seeks to express a feeling more than landmarks. The advantage with  their South American box set is you get to see countries that aren't often featured on travels DVDs.  If you want all the South American episodes buy this single pack.  Much more economical than purchasing single episodes.  Enjoy!",1252713600,9,465,4.822784810126582
3531803,5,B001DJ69DY,Globe Trekker always teaches you things you never knew.  The episode on Bolivia was especially interesting.,1242086400,5,107,5.6875
8293742,5,B001DJ69DY,Great!,1438473600,,6,6.0
8293743,5,B001DJ69DY,"Be sure to preview each DVD before showing to your students if using in a school. Pay special attention to the Colombia DVD.
Good set, was a great addition to my classroom.",1406073600,,172,4.40625
8293744,5,B001DJ69DY,Wonderful and exciting and very helpful for bringing back fond memories of Latin America.  Nice trip down the third world  as it was when it was still somewhat tame.,1398211200,,165,4.655172413793103
8293745,1,B001DJ69DY,"If you actually plan to go to South America don't waste your time with these.  Terrible videos, idiotic travel guides, DO NOT BUY.",1393200000,,130,4.6521739130434785
8293746,3,B001DJ69DY,"Always enjoy watching these travellers presenting different places in their unique ways, the reason I give this box set only 3 stars is they are a bit too old, I was kinda expecting shows from less than 10 years ago so they'll be more reflective to the current status of the countries, esp. we are thinking about going there soon but don't really feel comfortable to use these as reference since they are more than 10 years old, things must have changed a lot.",1361232000,,460,4.488095238095238
8293747,3,B001DJ69DY,"Good value for money, but quality is very poor.. Even if it is not blueray, it could have been better",1359936000,,101,4.1
8293748,4,B001DJ69DY,"Meggan, Ian, and others told us about the many places we could visit in South America.  It was great; however, the four (4) stars is due to the material's age - some dating several years ago.

Overall, it is the best information available on the market that I could find to give me the insight that I needed.

I would recommend, if for nothing more than the entertainment offered.",1343779200,,380,4.478260869565218
8293749,1,B001DJ69DY,"these guys are really scam artists... they run around to different countries and tape a few shots here and there with a home video camera and then but a nice glossy label on their box and packaging and sell it to you for absurd prices of 39.95 plus 9.95 shipping.

They have no breadth and depth to their videos.  These are the WORST  travel videos I have ever seen. do not buy any product from them!!

and they will not let you return anything unless it is in original plastic wrap

these guys are worse than used car salesman",1329955200,,527,4.282828282828283
8293750,4,B001DJ69DY,"Great set of shows.  The Rio de Janeiro one is not one to watch with your family, though.  Aside from that, they are very interesting and entertaining.  They go to places where other travel shows don't go and do adventurous things that other travel shows don't do.  I wish that all of them instead of just the Bolivia one would have the option of watching it in Spanish, though.",1292889600,6,378,4.434782608695652
8293751,1,B001DJ69DY,"The Colombia segment is really offensive.  They show you step by step instructions on how to make cocaine.  A coca farmer process the leaves right there in glorius detail.  What kind of travelogue is this?  They could have shown the Bogota gold museum, a coffee plantation, a flower cultivation operation, but no cocaine.  The whole Colombia segment is focused on smearing a country who has worked hard to over come its difficult circumstances",1292544000,14,443,5.013698630136986
