2967247,5,B000WEVGHK,"I have tried my fair share of workout DVDs and this is by far the best.  My other exercise DVDs are usually collecting dust after one or two uses, but this one has kept me coming back AND I'm losing inches and pounds after just 2 weeks!  The instructors are wonderful and very inspirational.  Totally nonthreatening set up/instruction and fun to work out along side.  I use the ""Maximum Results"" program- only 35 mins for level 1.  Gets the heart rate up and love the routines with the weights.  Each move incorporates upper and lower body so you are able to target many muscle groups with each movement plus alternatives are offered if the movement it too hard or too easy for you.  Only complaint- I'm not a fan of the music in the background, but it is easy enough to tune out.  All in all, I highly recommend this DVD.",1200787200,14,822,4.397350993377484
2967248,4,B000WEVGHK,I really like the DVD and love doing the Biggest Loser workouts!  I love the show so this helps.,1200614400,2,96,4.052631578947368
2967249,5,B000WEVGHK,"Early December 2007, after watching the amazing results from the Biggest Loser Television show, I decided to purchase both the The Biggest Loser Workout: Power Sculpt & Cardio Max.

They came in the mail later December so since January 1st of 2008 I have been working out with both DVDs and have since lost a few pounds and my friends have noticed a difference in my performance in sports and walking and thinning around my face. With 155 pounds to lose I am on a good start. Working out and eating correctly is the biggest key. The DVDs will not help you trim up and loose weight. You have to work out and manage your food intake as well.

On a personal note, I believe in a few months i will look back on this experience and say they (the Biggest Loser Club DVDs) saved my life. You have to get these if you want to see some at home changes in your life.",1200182400,15,856,4.213414634146342

2967251,5,B000WEVGHK,I bought this work out along with the Sculpting one and I am only on day 2 of my rotation between the two and all I can say is I can feel the burn! I only started with the beginners workout but I was huffing and getting pumped all the way through. I am not in the best shape but I hope to lose weight and tone at the same time with both Dvd's. I like that I can see people who look like me on the screen and know that they have lost weight without pills and surgery but with real sweat. I'm a huge fan of the show and I can't wait to do my own BL challenge at home with weekly weigh in's. Working up to the advanced level may take me some weeks but am really looking forward to making lots of progress. I will definetely keep doing these workouts!,1199750400,7,747,3.857142857142857
2967252,4,B000WEVGHK,"Bought this along with the Cardio DVD and all I can say is wow.

All 3 trainers are here just like in the Cardio and it doesn't take long before they start making you sweat!  The great thing with this DVD is you can pick your poison with a 20 minute level 1, 10 minute level 2 and 10 minute level 3 sculpt workout.  For a real challenge sign up for all 3 and hit play!

It won't take long before your muscles are screaming and the sweat is rolling off your forehead.  Lot's of lunges in this along with biceps and shoulder presses.  All the good stuff is in here.

I have no doubt that combined with the Cardio DVD just released, you can lose some serious weight with these.",1199059200,91,674,4.099236641221374
2967253,4,B000WEVGHK,"The training gang are back again with another workout, but this is pretty much all toning.  It's about 50 minutes and it works you from head to toe.  These guys don't mess around and you will work hard (but even though you are sore the next day, you want to keep at it because you know it will give you great results).
You can do a 30 minute level 1 workout or a 50 minute level 3 workout so as you get stronger, the workouts get tougher and you will avoid plateaus and boredom.  This feature will keep you moving up the strength scale and keep challenging you.  They suggest you need weights within about a 3lb to a 10lb range and if you are new to weight workouts, then you want to start light.  These guys are very motivating but yet they make it fun.  The contestants from past seasons are working out too and that is also motivating.  I really like this and can't wait to do it again.",1198454400,222,889,4.16374269005848

2967269,5,B000WEVGHK,I love the pace of this DVD! It is safe when using weights as most DVD's aren't. This DVD could be for beginners or advanced simply because you have the option of using heavier weights.

2967286,2,B000WEVGHK,"I wanted to like this dvd but couldn't,,,anyways, it was mess. I am a beginner but even I could spot out the bad form in some people. it felt rushed and I also wanted to hear more explanation of what the moves do from the trainers. I did the dvd straight through and I know you are supposed to work your way up but I do not like it because each segment pretty much does the same thing! They just switch out the trainer. And lunges lunges lunges! That is all the dvd seems to consist of. I pretty much modified all the way through as I have bad knees...and I am only 21! But sciatic nerve damage shoots from my spine to legs and there were just too many lunges in this dvd. All in all I probably will not use it as much as I intended...maybe I will just pop it in when I need a quick strength session.",1414800000,2,800,3.9751552795031055

2967290,4,B000WEVGHK,Maximum Results with workout Sculpt one only I was disappointed (meaning too short) but it's because I didn't set it up for the full workout. They recommend doing week 1-2 for a few weeks but I don't find it's enough for me although it would be great for brand newbie's.  So I recommend for non beginners to take all 3 sections in Maximum results.  They didn't tell me I'd need a mat since their floors were anti slip anyways.  I'd recommend one just not to slip on lunges for wooden floors.  But really enjoyed the workout anyways.  Next time I'll use the entire DVD.  I also had some read disk errors which got me frustrated.,1411603200,,627,4.408695652173913

I have minor back pain due to Scoliosis in my lower back.  There is a yoga routine in the middle if the 1st segment that stretches my back out so that I can sleep without pain when I do the exercises.

I am a little disappointed with the form on some of the other people in the video.  It is nice to have non-professionals so you don't feel stupid in the beginning but they are not performing the exercises correctly on occassion.  That would be my only complaint.",1387324800,,712,4.153284671532846

I am not ashamed to admit that this is a great product and GREAT exercises. It concentrates on your core and strengthens it. It also targets almost every muscle in your body.

I was hoping these workouts would be much of the same, but they are dull dull dull. Workouts like this are the reason people quit working out (especially at home). Bob's level 3 workout could be used as a supplement to things I do, but there is no way I could make this an effective or inspiring workout series alone. FOR BEGINNERS: this might be a good option for you if you are looking for a weightlifting only workout that steps you through basic to moderate exercises. The form looks pretty good on most people, and it wouldn't be overwhelming. If you are like me and own other Jillian workouts, like cardio, or get bored, this is definitely NOT for you.

The instructions were very easy to follow and it is definitely design for beginners.  --- meaning people starting over that are NOT in good shape whatsoever.  I have had so much trouble finding good workout DVDs for people in my position - overweight and just getting started.  A majority of the items I have bought --- even though they say anyone can do it --- are impossible and defeating.  Biggest Loser is the only thing I have found that starts where I need to start.  NOTE - IF THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS TOO TOUGH THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS!!  I found the LOW IMPACT CARDIO THE BEST!!  The downfall to most of these Biggest Loser DVDs Is that they get very boring and predictable.  I loved the cardio mix and was excited for week 2, for example, only to discover it was just more squats in Very few variations.  With that said, If you buy enough of their CDs and rotate them out, you will be fine.  I rotate between 3 and also do the weight loss yoga at nifgt - LOVE THEIR YOGA DVD --- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR BEGINNERS AS WELL",1374969600,2,1087,4.279411764705882

My only caution is for beginners (and I saw someone else mention this) watch the trainer for form- a lot of the attendees in the class are hurrying to get the reps done and their form is off and you can hurt yourself.

Superficial complaint: I could do without the blonde trainer being cutesy and wasting time making eyes at the camera chirping ""Don't you dare put that weight down! Don't you dare!"". I wasn't thinking about the burn or putting the weight down until you started bringing it up so much. Muting her has helped make her workout more bearable.",1352505600,2,780,4.193333333333333

I liked how the exercises got progressively harder so that I wasn't overwhelmed at first, and would definitely recommend this to someone looking to gain some experience in strength-focused exercises.

This video pretty much failed there -- lots of lunges and fast combined movements made it difficult for me to follow along at the pace they were going without wobbling.

The worst part, though, was that the whole format sucked. The instructor would do a few reps, stop counting, and move to point out the poor form on one of the participants, along with jokes like ""see what I have to put up with?"" and ""Even I make mistakes."" Fine, for a first walkthrough, but REALLY distracting on subsequent views. I want a focused workout, not jokes and walking around. It made it very hard to count reps and keep up.

I also felt like none of the participants were doing the reps at the same speed (that or the camera angels and cuts threw me off) but I had a hard time following along when she would stop and move.

With three levels of workout (Jillian for 20 minutes/Kim for 10 minutes/Bob for 10 minutes), you have a wide range of workouts to choose from. I started light- just doing Jillian's level 1 plus the warm up and cool down, but after a week I decided to give the other ones a try. Now I do Jillian's, plus Bob's afterward, for a nice 30 minute workout. Over the past year, I did it every single day and dropped 50lbs!

The best thing about this DVD is that they take the time to explain the movement to you, how to do it properly, and why you're doing it. They work all over the body, from arms to legs to abs, and even take the time to add a tiny bit of cardio in with the strength training. It's not exhausting like cardio workouts either, so ""I'm too tired"" doesn't work as an excuse! Overall, I am VERY impressed with my results and highly recommend this to anyone looking to head in the right direction with their fitness.

I'm still not the biggest fan of Kim's workout and generally avoid it, but perhaps it's just her personality that irks me. =)",1329004800,11,1252,4.3418803418803416

2967360,5,B000WEVGHK,"I knew this product was going to be amazing the first time my husband and I tried it together, because we were both sweating pools and we both had to take breaks and rest. My husband is now a PFC in the Army, and was in good shape before even starting this DVD, but I was more than 200 pounds and in very poor shape after gaining 70 pounds with my pregnancy. As challenging as this program was I knew right away that it was working to improve my body, strength, endurance and stamina. The next couple of days I was stiff and could feel in all my muscles that this truly was a full body workout and I loved tightening my muscles and really feeling how much I had worked them. I became confident from that point that I would see the kind of results I really needed to be healthier and make sure I am around for my daughter for years to come. I am now 170 pounds with the help of this program, coupled with a much healthier diet and added support of supplements (Hydroxycut, protein shakes). I really think that this can be a life changing program as long as you stick to it and really do the exercises they are telling you to do. You're in your own home, so you really have to be the one pushing yourself because no one is going to tell you that you are slacking off or to try harder. That drive and determination has to come from you or you will end up quitting before you see any real results. If you have that determination and the passion to really stick to this program then this will be incredibly beneficial to you! But it starts with you.

2967363,4,B000WEVGHK,"I bought this along with the CardioMax DVD. I was in an exercising rut (I had just had a baby), and this helped get me going. It's definitely not hardcore weight training, but I like the efficiency of the combination moves (working both arms and legs at the same time), and the focus on lunges/squats. I also like the variation of the workouts (in the DVD menu, you can add a warmup, cool down and one or all of the three workouts. Then you press play, and it will go through the sequence.) and the simplicity (you only need dumbbells and your own body weight for the exercises). I would recommend this to someone looking to lose a few pounds and get overall toning. I would not recommend this to someone who is advanced in weight training, though I suppose you could just use heavier weights for each exercise. The only thing is that with using combination moves, you can't focus as well on form and isolating a certain muscle. Lastly, I'd like to say that it encouraged me to see bigger people in the background. Sometimes I get too discouraged seeing all the super fit people smiling and not breaking a sweat.

I have worked-out intensely in the past but had really fallen off the wagon. This DVD, combined with the cardio DVD, have gotten me on the right track. I started with 10 pounds to lose and have lost about three and really firmed up, but I think this would be really good for those who need to lose more. Just take it slow and move on to the higher levels when you're ready and have at least two sets of weights (5-8 lbs for women and 10-15 for men).

I have to say, my favorite thing about these DVD's is that the trainers are not annoying and perky. Seriously, for less than $15, you can't go wrong.",1297123200,,900,4.232558139534884

2967368,3,B000WEVGHK,"I have never seen the ""Biggest Loser"" TV show, but I enjoyed the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Biggest-Loser-Workout-Cardio-Max/dp/B000WEVGHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Biggest Loser Workout: Cardio Max</a>&nbsp;DVD so I thought I would take a shot with this Power Sculpt DVD.

The Power Sculpt DVD is definitely not to the same level of quality as the Cardio Max.  It follows the same method, with three levels of intensity and the ability to mix-or-match with the remote to get the workout you want.  This is good.

Like Cardio Max, the Level 1 is 20 minutes and the Level 2 and 3 are 10 minutes each.  On the Cardio Max, Jillian's Level 2 segment was my least favorite, and the one I am most likely to skip.  Here, she takes over the longer 20 minute Level 1 workout.  This is bad.

The real problem with Jillian is that she doesn't seem to know how to make a workout DVD. She spends too much time explaining and correcting form, teasing the cast, and just chatting in general.  Now, if I was taking a class from her, that would be great. If it was just a TV show, things would be fine.  But this is a workout DVD, meant to be watched/used over and over again, and when she stops the exercise in order to correct someone's form, or in order to explain a particular exercise, it brings the whole thing to a screeching halt.

I have owned other workout DVDs where semi-complicated forms were explained in a separate training segment so that the overall momentum of the workout wasn't affected.  That doesn't happen here.  Jillian stops the workout every single time in the same spot, and it is frustrating and annoying.

I can't say that this DVD is a total loss.  I have learned to just carry on over top of her instructions, and you can set it to music only without the instructor's voice, but it just seems like this should be a better production, and that the director should have said something or done something to keep the flow going.",1277164800,7,1995,4.792397660818714

Warm up = 26 calories

I find Kim a bit annoying but she does the best ab workout of the three on Power Sculpt.  I do have to be really careful on Bob's Sculpt level 3 because of the plank moves he does...they hurt my lower back.  However, that being said, if you want a serious workout in only 20 minutes, try doing Jillian's level 2 Cardio Max coupled with Bob's level 3 Power Sculpt.  It left me lying in a heap on the floor, and I do mild/moderate exercise 5-6 days a week.  You will definately feel this when you are finished.  Jillian's level 1 sculpt isn't that hard, but to increase the intensity all you have to do is add more weight.  Also, I find that the workout is harder if I really focus on the muscles I am using and stay really tight and in control throughout the workout.

Level 3 is lead by Bob and has his boot camp moves. Like in the Boot Camp DVD, this one allows you to choose what level you want to do and the order of them. I like doing level 2 then 3 then 1.
One small criticism that I have is on level 1 - Jillian sometimes takes so long to explain what you're about to do that you end up just standing/laying there waiting for her to be done with the explanation. However, after doing the workout several times, you know what's coming up so you just start doing it without waiting for her.

I would not recommend it for absolute beginners; it's important to have some level of fitness before you start or else you're risking injury and fatigue because it's not easy, especially if you're using weights over 5lbs. Jillian, Bob and Kim are great! Go ahead and buy it.",1262822400,,589,4.663461538461538

I like that there are ""real"" people exercising with me.  However, this dvd had a few too many people who didn't look like they knew what they were doing.  It would have been nice to have a few people that knew exactly how to do the moves and what Bob wanted them to do because it looked very unorganized and was hard to follow.  However, I loved the workout and it worked my butt off!!!  I'm only on level one and i can't imagine the other levels.  :) Bring it on!",1259971200,,597,4.192982456140351
2967384,3,B000WEVGHK,"Overall, this a fair DVD.  Workouts #1 and #3 are strong, with #3 being the best on the disk.  Bob does a great job in motivating you as well as providing direction.  I truly wish he ran the show on this one! Jillian's segment is fair, and is geared towards the novice and/or the beginner.  However, it does the job if you are planning to do all three workouts back-to-back.  I must mention that the gal who instructs the middle segment is not very good.  She is very confusing to listen to and frustrating as an instructor to follow.  i personally mute this section and follow along silently, as the exercises as decent to perform.",1259539200,,632,4.443478260869565
2967385,4,B000WEVGHK,"The workout itself is decent. I'm in moderately good shape, but overweight, and due to some health issues I need to lean up. I've been doing the workout for a few weeks. I do level 1 and then I do anywhere from 1.5 to 3 miles on the treadmill afterward, so I haven't ventured to level 2 yet, though I did watch it to see what it involved. I think the workout is good, and on that basis I would recommend the dvd.

However...my biggest issue with the dvd is Jillian Michaels. I have never watched The Biggest Loser, so I don't know what her deal is, but I find her obnoxious in this dvd. She picks on that girl Julie relentlessly. None of the participants look like they know what they are doing, but Michaels singles Julie out time and time again. She also resorts to a good bit of name calling. That aside, she doesn't come off as a very good instructor. She doesn't explain what she wants everyone to do well enough and the participants look awkward trying to figure out what they are supposed to do. And I find Michaels doesn't explain stances and form well enough, for example I rarely know which leg my weight should be on. When she says I should feel it in my butt, and I DON'T, I know I'm doing it wrong. Today, mid-workout, I just had to stop and write down the things I heard that I find annoying. Thank goodness the dvd provides the option to run it as music only, without the instructor's voice.

""Switch it over, hands in both..double 'em up...It's very seldom that I make a mistake but when I do I'm not afraid to admit it."" Jillian makes so many mistakes in this dvd it isn't funny.

Pendulum lunges: ""...keeping knee over ankle, don't want to forward travel...where the knee goes over the ankle."" - Which knee, what ankle. I have no idea what forward travel is, she doesn't demonstrate.

""What's the matter Poodle. What's the matter Julie. Tap. Tap!""

""See what I have to put up with for four months. She's killing me. Stop! Please!""

Bicep curls: ""...curl up three quarters of the way...right to my hand Julie thank you."" Julie was doing it correctly. She was almost the only one doing it correctly.

""Bill I hope you're doing this correctly since you belong to me."" Bill has the worst form of all the participants.

""Sink down Julie! Thank you!""

""Julie don't do it to me right now. Make me proud Julie. Make me proud Julie."" Michaels says as she sits on Julie's back.

""Excuse me Julie leg in! Thank you!"" - Julie was doing it properly.

Curtsies: Awkward for beginner. Not well explained. I should feel them in my gluts...but I don't. Where should my weight be, front leg or back leg?

""Isn't that right Bootie Girl.""

""Isabel, very well done. Boys don't usually like these."" - Is Isabel a boy?

Squat-Leg lifts: ""Working upper and lower body at the same time..."" - my arms are stationary, how am I engaging my upper body?

""Look at you Neal, Bill."" - Bill is clearly lifting his arms too high.

The chest flies are the only exercise Michaels explains entirely.

""Relax Mama.""

Bootie raises...should I be contracting my butt muscles? Michaels doesn't instruct me to.

""Holly's got J. Lo bootie. Holly's got ghetto bootie, big time.""

""Julie, get your leg up. Oh Lord. Always giving me hassle. Always giving me hassle Poodle.""

""I don't want to talk to Bill. I'm gonna go play with Neal.""

""Bill, knees in, feet off the ground. Hello! everybody look at Eric."" She never said to lift your legs. That's why no one is.

Throughout the dvd she says ""3 more""...and a second later ""Last one"". Or ""Let's do 4 more""...then she ends after the next one.",1257897600,6,3562,4.462962962962963

I'm not an incredibly fit person and had not used a workout video in several months due to pregnancy, but jeez, I didn't even crack a sweat.  It also looked like it was filmed in a bargain basement.

Her voice is annoying and she's kind of boring, but she's only on a short time, so I can deal with it.  I love Jillian, but she's a little too cutesy at times.  She's kind of flirty with one of the female contestants, calling her poodle, which I found a little odd to be doing that on a workout dvd.  Then at one point she is showing how to do an exercise, then tells that contestant:  ""I don't want to talk to you, I'm gonna go play with Neil.""  I think she's trying to be cute, but I'm actually embarrassed for her.  It's surprising to see her acting that way.  I love her toughness on the show, and that's what makes her a great trainer.  This other side of her, I'd rather not see, and it is quite unprofessional.  I still think she's great though, and so is the workout, which is the most important thing.  It's still a lot better than watching those twiggy, smiley, annoying women who are all trying to do better than everyone else on the video.  I'd much rather deal with Jillian's cutesyness and watch BL contestants.  I love it!!!

2967393,5,B000WEVGHK,"For about a week now, I've been alternating the Cardio Max Workout with the Power Sculpt Workout.  Honestly.... I'm 27 years old and since I was 17, after high school sports were over, I've been looking for a workout that I can actually LOVE... and I never found it.  I tried everything.  I really really did.  I finally finally FINALLY found one I love!!  Maybe it's because I just started going back to school and have found a new sense of competitiveness inside me- not for others, but for myself, or maybe Biggest Loser is just awesome.  Regardless, I have found that I have so much motivation to do this DVD... and clearly competing with myself to see if I can make it through the whole workout today, or make it to the next level tomorrow.  Sheesh!  Who needs a workout partner!

I know people have complained that the Biggest Losers in the background are distracting because they are doing things wrong, but I actually like it, because I can correct myself by looking at them, knowing they are doing it wrong, then looking at myself and thinking- crap I'm doing it just like they are- I'm doing it wrong!  So then I correct myself.

The first day I wasn't able to get through the whole workout, in fact I only made it 10 minutes out of 20.  I was sore for... well.... I'm still sore from it!!  I could barely walk the next day- I LOVE that feeling- just knowing it's working!  After 4 times of doing it, I can get through the workout, and am so anxious to move on, but I know there is a reason for why this level is harder than the higher levels, and why it needs to be done for at least 2 weeks.  You've really got to jumpstart your metabolism and shock those muscles into action!  Then you really need to maintain it for a few weeks before moving on, otherwise your results may not be what you were expecting.

I'm thinking about purchasing Boot Camp for after my 6 weeks are over on these two DVD's, and possibly alternating it with the Yoga one..... any thoughts on that combo??

As for eating- I am TRYING to eat healthy, but I'm more of a ""natural"" dieter, and natural doesn't mean less calories, so I'm working on it.  I'd rather not eat fake foods.  I'm a honey over splenda kinda girl.

Anyways, I've taken my measurements (but not my weight- bc I don't care for that frustrating number as inches count way more than pounds and it's just discouraging when you don't see the number you want so fast) and took my before pictures, and I can't wait to *hopefully* see results in a few months!!!",1250899200,,2506,4.369330453563715

She can push anyone, regardless of your fitness level, and if you stick with it you WILL see results. I also own her 30 day shred DVD. It's a great muscle building program!

I enjoyed the biggest loser power sculpting workout due to the change of trainers between levels. They keep it upbeat so it doesn't get boring. If the workout becomes to easy just up the amount of weights your lifting. There is no reason you can keep up with this DVD forever-just adding more weight when you need to. I switch btwn 10 lb weights 5 for the weaker muscles groups or extended reps. Keep doing this and you will transform your body! Good Luck!",1248998400,3,914,4.345029239766082

I like to feel a sense of accomplishment after I get done working out but I felt like I got the workout equivalent of jogging on a treadmill for 15 minutes (and I did all three levels.)  I think I was just expecting a little more since I love both Jillian and Bob as trainers.  However, this workout might be better suited for someone who is a beginner. I've been working out for about 4 months with Jillian's 30 day shred, No More Trouble Zones, and BFBM along with Bob's yoga dvd and I don't consider myself ""advanced"" but I'm not really a beginner either.

There were a couple of good exercises when I felt the burn, mainly in Bob's workout.  I felt like a lot of the moves were rushed and proper form wasn't demonstrated so you might not get the full extent of your workout if the exercises are not being performed correctly.  This workout focuses mainly on the upper body and lower body and there are a couple of ""core"" exercises thrown in but I didn't really feel the burn too much in my abs like I do normally when I workout.  I say rent this at your local library like me, or on Netflix (if you have it)  but don't buy it. I suggest trying one of Jillian's videos or the Biggest Loser Yoga!",1245974400,,1227,4.236051502145923
2967399,3,B000WEVGHK,"Well, this is a good workout for beginners. But if you've tried other body sculpt DVD's, you could see how much more this needed to push you. We just bought Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred and I felt like I got a better workout from her 20 minute session than this 50 minute one. And even though I'm an amateur, I could tell that I needed and wanted to push myself a bit more than this DVD offered. If you do get this DVD, I would suggest getting some heavier weights to push yourself.

Another thing I didn't like about this DVD was the repetitive nature of going from one section to the next. You're supposed to ""add"" levels as you go, but it sure felt like the 2nd level exercises were what I just finished in the first (including curtsy lunges, triceps). I would have liked newer and more challenging reps. Working out my triceps for 10 minutes may sound cool, but it's a small muscle and thus burns less calories.

One other factor is that as cool as it is to watch your favorite contestants from the Biggest Loser, they tend to have very poor form, which means you don't always know how to do the exercise right.

If you want to be pushed and want the trainers from Biggest Loser, I'd suggest checking out Jillian Michaels stuff. Challenging and inspiring.",1245974400,,1261,4.4034334763948495

2967412,3,B000WEVGHK,"I bought this DVD along with Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred DVD.  I was a little disapointed with this workout.  The first issue is that none of the former Biggest Loser people in the workout seem to have any idea what they are doing.  Half of the time they are all doing different moves and seem to be clueless as to the order or proper form of the excersizes.  This combined with the fact that most of the time the trainers also do not do the moves leaves you a little lost.  Second, levels two and three are only 10 minutes a piece and feel very rushed with little explanation of what exactly you should be doing.  Jillian (first level) has a little more time to describe form and what muscles are being worked.  Overall, I think the workout is not bad (maybe a little slow) but the DVD could have been put together with a little more thought and time.

Although it is not a flashy video, no music, lights etc.  It is easy to follow and suprisingly we were all in alot of pain the 2nd day after the workout.  It was very effective and fast.  I would suggest that women that have any prior strength training at all use at least 6 pound weights.  I went and bought 8 Lb. weights after the workout because I did not even feel the 5 Lb. pound weights that I used the first time.  But, I definately felt the squats and lunges!

You could really feel this workout the next day... not to the point of not being able to lower yourself onto the toilet, but a nice bit of soreness that lets you know that you really worked out those muscles.
I've been doing it for a few weeks on and off now (on and off because I've been sick, so I try to do it when I don't feel my worst), and I'm starting to see more toned muscles.... especially in my arms.
While doing the exercises, it doesn't seem that you're getting any real ab workout, but the next day you'll feel that you definitely were.

She does a very good job of showing the moves. I loved it!  I really felt like I had a workout comparable to what I get in my gym class.

By the way, I've had a bilateral mastectomy with TRAM reconstruction.  What that means is that I'm missing about 40% of my tranverse abdominal muscle (the one that runs vertically from the pelvis to under the ribs).

They didn't stay together and the trainers didn't always do the whole workout so I felt like I was doing things wrong by watching them.

2967458,4,B000WEVGHK,"I really debated giving this 5 stars I decided 4 was best. I will explain why. There are 5 segments a warm up, levels 1,2,3 workouts and a cool down. I think the warm up was lacking a bit though. That can easily be solved by jogging in place for a few mintes before starting the workout. The first workout level one is instructed by Jillian and is very good but I did not think there was enough focus on the abs. It is 20 mins. long. I was not tired at all afterwards. There were basics such as squats and lunges combined with handweight exercises. It was tough but if your an advanced exerciser you may want to do level 2 and 3 after level one. Level 2 is instructed by Kim she basically does a 10 mintue segment that most of the exercises are the same but a more advanced version of the ones Jillian did. Side lunges, rows the ab exericses are done sitting up with weights whch is a nice change. Level 3 is instructed by Bob. This is the one that had me sweating there are some exercises involving hand weights and then you go to the floor doing planks and holding them for a long time which gets you sweating. He also has you hold yourself up in a pushup position and that was the killer. The cool down is instructed by Jillan and is basic stretching. The reason this got 4 stars instead of five is this the last 2 workout were not long enough. I don't know may people who can workout for 10 mintues and lose weight. That can be remieded by repeating them. If your out of shape or in a plateau this will work great for you. This is supposed to be a 6 week program where for the frst 2 weeks you do level 1 the next 2 weeks you do level 2 and the last 2 weeks you do level 3. If your like me and gain weight easily and have a sluggish metabolism I suggest you do all 3 levels at every workout. This is a great dvd but like I said the last 2 workouts just are not long enough and that is why I gave it 4 stars. There needs to be a little more to each of those last 2 weokouts. I reccomend buying this and using it but just do all 3 or when you get to levels 2 and 3 I suggest you do the 10 min. segments twice.",1212019200,2,2111,3.9345794392523366

This DVD works every single muscle that I need it to and I feel like I'm accomplishing a great deal each workout.  My arms were burning at the end of Jillians Workout and then on to Bobs.

I highly recommend this workout, especially when you combine it with the Cardio Max DVD.  I could see/feel results within a few days.

I found this to be a pretty good workout.  I've just started strength training again and found most of the exercises to be challenging esp. those in Bob's section.  I do like that the exercises keep the heart rate up, but the pace and multiple movements can compromise your form which means you won't be getting the true benefit of the exercise and/or possibly end up hurting yourself.

Another thing, for exercises done one side at a time - they aren't always done evenly.  Be sure to count and do the same number of reps per side.",1206057600,65,755,5.696428571428571

You will get stronger, and it will become easier. They are also leveled by weeks, and there are modifications, such as use weights or don't use weights depending on your level. I  used them as they recommended: do each video on alternate days. You will sweat, you will work hard, but the results are amazing! Within two weeks, I could see definition in my arms, and I lost the 5-8 pounds that I was trying to get off for about six months. I feel firmer, more toned, and thinner.(Which I am :)  I also purchased the Biggest Loser Cookbook and the recipes are delicious and satisfying.

For most of the exercises I felt like I needed more reps than were done to work the muscle enough. After the first time I did it, I upped it to level 2. Lower weight with more reps gives your muscles nice shape, and as a woman thats more what I'm aiming for rather than strength training. With that said, it is still a fantastic workout, that I do recommend.

But, it's a good pain.  I've seen serious results just after a few weeks in terms of my overall strength, especially my core.

My only complaint is that some of the routines seem rushed and they don't do enough reps in some of the routines.  Some of them you want it to end and end now but others they just whip through it.  I think the lunges are done too quickly and you have to be careful of your knees when you are just starting because the stability isn't there yet.  Man, these guys love their lunges though.

I felt the pain and burn the same day as well as the next day. My only criticism of the work-out is that the movements are quite rapid with the weights and the instruction on body mechanics is poor. My back really hurt after completing the work-out due to the use of 10 pound weights and quick movements. The video does call for heavier weights, but it may be more beneficial to use lighter weights until accustomed to the movements. I played the work-out with trainer instruction, which apparently did not guide me well enough. I will be more careful when I do the work-out next time and pay very close attention to the core.

I felt the levels did progress and were ranked appropriately, unlike other reviewers. If the movements are done correctly, the intensity of the levels do increase with each trainer. I could barely keep up at the end and I am used to 50 minute routines without a problem. I would definately recommend this work-out DVD to those who are serious about training and/or weight loss.

Now let me preface this with saying, I am extremely fit.  I work out 4-5x a week doing cardio for 30-45 minutes at a time.  (And when I do cardio the sweat is literally dripping off me in waves.)  I also have been doing sculpting DVDs 2x a week for the past 6 months.  This workout kicked my butt!  Level one is definitely easy enough for intermediate, yet will still challenge those who are in good shape.  I just added Level 2 today, and I actually had to stop the DVD and take a 60 second breather because I thought I would either throw up or pass out!  You've gotta work me REALLY hard to make that happen!

My only ""criticism"" is that I don't think this DVD is appropriate for beginners.  However, after reading some reviews it is clear beginners are doing it and thriving on it.  My advice to a beginner would be to concentrate on form before you concentrate on reps or how heavy your weights are.  In the DVD a lot of the participants have really poor form.  (Even though the trainers give them a thumbs up.)  Watch the trainer and copy them.  Once your form is perfect add weights and/or increase your reps.  I'm sure any trainer will tell you they'd rather you do one really good move than 10 of the same move with poor form.

If you want to loose weight and you stick with this DVD I can't imagine you wouldn't change your life and body.

They came in the mail later December so since January 1st of 2008 I have been working out with both DVDs and have since lost a few pounds and my friends have noticed a difference in my performance in sports and walking and thinning around my face. With 155 pounds to lose I am on a good start. Working out and eating correctly is the biggest key. The DVDs will not help you trim up and loose weight. You have to work out and manage your food intake as well.

On a personal note, I believe in a few months i will look back on this experience and say they (the Biggest Loser Club DVDs) saved my life. You have to get these if you want to see some at home changes in your life.",1200182400,15,856,4.213414634146342

3201748,5,B000WEVGHK,I bought this work out along with the Sculpting one and I am only on day 2 of my rotation between the two and all I can say is I can feel the burn! I only started with the beginners workout but I was huffing and getting pumped all the way through. I am not in the best shape but I hope to lose weight and tone at the same time with both Dvd's. I like that I can see people who look like me on the screen and know that they have lost weight without pills and surgery but with real sweat. I'm a huge fan of the show and I can't wait to do my own BL challenge at home with weekly weigh in's. Working up to the advanced level may take me some weeks but am really looking forward to making lots of progress. I will definetely keep doing these workouts!,1199750400,7,747,3.857142857142857
3201749,4,B000WEVGHK,"Bought this along with the Cardio DVD and all I can say is wow.

All 3 trainers are here just like in the Cardio and it doesn't take long before they start making you sweat!  The great thing with this DVD is you can pick your poison with a 20 minute level 1, 10 minute level 2 and 10 minute level 3 sculpt workout.  For a real challenge sign up for all 3 and hit play!

It won't take long before your muscles are screaming and the sweat is rolling off your forehead.  Lot's of lunges in this along with biceps and shoulder presses.  All the good stuff is in here.

I have no doubt that combined with the Cardio DVD just released, you can lose some serious weight with these.",1199059200,91,674,4.099236641221374

These guys don't mess around and you will work hard (but even though you are sore the next day, you want to keep at it because you know it will give you great results).
You can do a 30 minute level 1 workout or a 50 minute level 3 workout so as you get stronger, the workouts get tougher and you will avoid plateaus and boredom.  This feature will keep you moving up the strength scale and keep challenging you.  They suggest you need weights within about a 3lb to a 10lb range and if you are new to weight workouts, then you want to start light.  These guys are very motivating but yet they make it fun.  The contestants from past seasons are working out too and that is also motivating.  I really like this and can't wait to do it again.",1198454400,222,889,4.16374269005848

I am a beginner but even I could spot out the bad form in some people. it felt rushed and I also wanted to hear more explanation of what the moves do from the trainers. I did the dvd straight through and I know you are supposed to work your way up but I do not like it because each segment pretty much does the same thing! They just switch out the trainer. And lunges lunges lunges! That is all the dvd seems to consist of. I pretty much modified all the way through as I have bad knees...and I am only 21! But sciatic nerve damage shoots from my spine to legs and there were just too many lunges in this dvd.

They recommend doing week 1-2 for a few weeks but I don't find it's enough for me although it would be great for brand newbie's.  So I recommend for non beginners to take all 3 sections in Maximum results.  They didn't tell me I'd need a mat since their floors were anti slip anyways.  I'd recommend one just not to slip on lunges for wooden floors.  But really enjoyed the workout anyways.  Next time I'll use the entire DVD.

There is a yoga routine in the middle if the 1st segment that stretches my back out so that I can sleep without pain when I do the exercises.

FOR BEGINNERS: this might be a good option for you if you are looking for a weightlifting only workout that steps you through basic to moderate exercises.

I have had so much trouble finding good workout DVDs for people in my position - overweight and just getting started.  A majority of the items I have bought --- even though they say anyone can do it --- are impossible and defeating.  Biggest Loser is the only thing I have found that starts where I need to start.  NOTE - IF THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS TOO TOUGH THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS!!  I found the LOW IMPACT CARDIO THE BEST!!  The downfall to most of these Biggest Loser DVDs Is that they get very boring and predictable.  I loved the cardio mix and was excited for week 2, for example, only to discover it was just more squats in Very few variations.  With that said, If you buy enough of their CDs and rotate them out, you will be fine.

My only caution is for beginners (and I saw someone else mention this) watch the trainer for form- a lot of the attendees in the class are hurrying to get the reps done and their form is off and you can hurt yourself.

Superficial complaint: I could do without the blonde trainer being cutesy and wasting time making eyes at the camera chirping ""Don't you dare put that weight down! Don't you dare!"". I wasn't thinking about the burn or putting the weight down until you started bringing it up so much. Muting her has helped make her workout more bearable.",1352505600,2,780,4.193333333333333

I liked how the exercises got progressively harder so that I wasn't overwhelmed at first, and would definitely recommend this to someone looking to gain some experience in strength-focused exercises.

This video pretty much failed there -- lots of lunges and fast combined movements made it difficult for me to follow along at the pace they were going without wobbling.

The worst part, though, was that the whole format sucked. The instructor would do a few reps, stop counting, and move to point out the poor form on one of the participants, along with jokes like ""see what I have to put up with?"" and ""Even I make mistakes."" Fine, for a first walkthrough, but REALLY distracting on subsequent views. I want a focused workout, not jokes and walking around. It made it very hard to count reps and keep up.

I also felt like none of the participants were doing the reps at the same speed (that or the camera angels and cuts threw me off) but I had a hard time following along when she would stop and move.

With three levels of workout (Jillian for 20 minutes/Kim for 10 minutes/Bob for 10 minutes), you have a wide range of workouts to choose from. I started light- just doing Jillian's level 1 plus the warm up and cool down, but after a week I decided to give the other ones a try. Now I do Jillian's, plus Bob's afterward, for a nice 30 minute workout. Over the past year, I did it every single day and dropped 50lbs!

The best thing about this DVD is that they take the time to explain the movement to you, how to do it properly, and why you're doing it. They work all over the body, from arms to legs to abs, and even take the time to add a tiny bit of cardio in with the strength training. It's not exhausting like cardio workouts either, so ""I'm too tired"" doesn't work as an excuse! Overall, I am VERY impressed with my results and highly recommend this to anyone looking to head in the right direction with their fitness.

I'm still not the biggest fan of Kim's workout and generally avoid it, but perhaps it's just her personality that irks me. =)",1329004800,11,1252,4.3418803418803416

3201857,5,B000WEVGHK,"I knew this product was going to be amazing the first time my husband and I tried it together, because we were both sweating pools and we both had to take breaks and rest. My husband is now a PFC in the Army, and was in good shape before even starting this DVD, but I was more than 200 pounds and in very poor shape after gaining 70 pounds with my pregnancy. As challenging as this program was I knew right away that it was working to improve my body, strength, endurance and stamina. The next couple of days I was stiff and could feel in all my muscles that this truly was a full body workout and I loved tightening my muscles and really feeling how much I had worked them. I became confident from that point that I would see the kind of results I really needed to be healthier and make sure I am around for my daughter for years to come. I am now 170 pounds with the help of this program, coupled with a much healthier diet and added support of supplements (Hydroxycut, protein shakes). I really think that this can be a life changing program as long as you stick to it and really do the exercises they are telling you to do. You're in your own home, so you really have to be the one pushing yourself because no one is going to tell you that you are slacking off or to try harder. That drive and determination has to come from you or you will end up quitting before you see any real results. If you have that determination and the passion to really stick to this program then this will be incredibly beneficial to you! But it starts with you.

3201860,4,B000WEVGHK,"I bought this along with the CardioMax DVD. I was in an exercising rut (I had just had a baby), and this helped get me going. It's definitely not hardcore weight training, but I like the efficiency of the combination moves (working both arms and legs at the same time), and the focus on lunges/squats. I also like the variation of the workouts (in the DVD menu, you can add a warmup, cool down and one or all of the three workouts. Then you press play, and it will go through the sequence.) and the simplicity (you only need dumbbells and your own body weight for the exercises). I would recommend this to someone looking to lose a few pounds and get overall toning. I would not recommend this to someone who is advanced in weight training, though I suppose you could just use heavier weights for each exercise. The only thing is that with using combination moves, you can't focus as well on form and isolating a certain muscle. Lastly, I'd like to say that it encouraged me to see bigger people in the background. Sometimes I get too discouraged seeing all the super fit people smiling and not breaking a sweat.

I have worked-out intensely in the past but had really fallen off the wagon. This DVD, combined with the cardio DVD, have gotten me on the right track. I started with 10 pounds to lose and have lost about three and really firmed up, but I think this would be really good for those who need to lose more. Just take it slow and move on to the higher levels when you're ready and have at least two sets of weights (5-8 lbs for women and 10-15 for men).

I have to say, my favorite thing about these DVD's is that the trainers are not annoying and perky. Seriously, for less than $15, you can't go wrong.",1297123200,,900,4.232558139534884

3201865,3,B000WEVGHK,"I have never seen the ""Biggest Loser"" TV show, but I enjoyed the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Biggest-Loser-Workout-Cardio-Max/dp/B000WEVGHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Biggest Loser Workout: Cardio Max</a>&nbsp;DVD so I thought I would take a shot with this Power Sculpt DVD.

The Power Sculpt DVD is definitely not to the same level of quality as the Cardio Max.  It follows the same method, with three levels of intensity and the ability to mix-or-match with the remote to get the workout you want.  This is good.

Like Cardio Max, the Level 1 is 20 minutes and the Level 2 and 3 are 10 minutes each.  On the Cardio Max, Jillian's Level 2 segment was my least favorite, and the one I am most likely to skip.  Here, she takes over the longer 20 minute Level 1 workout.  This is bad.

The real problem with Jillian is that she doesn't seem to know how to make a workout DVD. She spends too much time explaining and correcting form, teasing the cast, and just chatting in general.  Now, if I was taking a class from her, that would be great. If it was just a TV show, things would be fine.  But this is a workout DVD, meant to be watched/used over and over again, and when she stops the exercise in order to correct someone's form, or in order to explain a particular exercise, it brings the whole thing to a screeching halt.

I have owned other workout DVDs where semi-complicated forms were explained in a separate training segment so that the overall momentum of the workout wasn't affected.  That doesn't happen here.  Jillian stops the workout every single time in the same spot, and it is frustrating and annoying.

I can't say that this DVD is a total loss.  I have learned to just carry on over top of her instructions, and you can set it to music only without the instructor's voice, but it just seems like this should be a better production, and that the director should have said something or done something to keep the flow going.",1277164800,7,1995,4.792397660818714

Warm up = 26 calories
Level 1 = 120 calories

I find Kim a bit annoying but she does the best ab workout of the three on Power Sculpt.  I do have to be really careful on Bob's Sculpt level 3 because of the plank moves he does...they hurt my lower back.  However, that being said, if you want a serious workout in only 20 minutes, try doing Jillian's level 2 Cardio Max coupled with Bob's level 3 Power Sculpt.  It left me lying in a heap on the floor, and I do mild/moderate exercise 5-6 days a week.  You will definately feel this when you are finished.  Jillian's level 1 sculpt isn't that hard, but to increase the intensity all you have to do is add more weight.  Also, I find that the workout is harder if I really focus on the muscles I am using and stay really tight and in control throughout the workout.

Level 3 is lead by Bob and has his boot camp moves. Like in the Boot Camp DVD, this one allows you to choose what level you want to do and the order of them. I like doing level 2 then 3 then 1.
One small criticism that I have is on level 1 - Jillian sometimes takes so long to explain what you're about to do that you end up just standing/laying there waiting for her to be done with the explanation. However, after doing the workout several times, you know what's coming up so you just start doing it without waiting for her.

I like that there are ""real"" people exercising with me.  However, this dvd had a few too many people who didn't look like they knew what they were doing.  It would have been nice to have a few people that knew exactly how to do the moves and what Bob wanted them to do because it looked very unorganized and was hard to follow.  However, I loved the workout and it worked my butt off!!!  I'm only on level one and i can't imagine the other levels.  :) Bring it on!",1259971200,,597,4.192982456140351
3201881,3,B000WEVGHK,"Overall, this a fair DVD.  Workouts #1 and #3 are strong, with #3 being the best on the disk.  Bob does a great job in motivating you as well as providing direction.  I truly wish he ran the show on this one! Jillian's segment is fair, and is geared towards the novice and/or the beginner.  However, it does the job if you are planning to do all three workouts back-to-back.  I must mention that the gal who instructs the middle segment is not very good.  She is very confusing to listen to and frustrating as an instructor to follow.  i personally mute this section and follow along silently, as the exercises as decent to perform.",1259539200,,632,4.443478260869565
3201882,4,B000WEVGHK,"The workout itself is decent. I'm in moderately good shape, but overweight, and due to some health issues I need to lean up. I've been doing the workout for a few weeks. I do level 1 and then I do anywhere from 1.5 to 3 miles on the treadmill afterward, so I haven't ventured to level 2 yet, though I did watch it to see what it involved. I think the workout is good, and on that basis I would recommend the dvd.

However...my biggest issue with the dvd is Jillian Michaels. I have never watched The Biggest Loser, so I don't know what her deal is, but I find her obnoxious in this dvd. She picks on that girl Julie relentlessly. None of the participants look like they know what they are doing, but Michaels singles Julie out time and time again. She also resorts to a good bit of name calling. That aside, she doesn't come off as a very good instructor. She doesn't explain what she wants everyone to do well enough and the participants look awkward trying to figure out what they are supposed to do. And I find Michaels doesn't explain stances and form well enough, for example I rarely know which leg my weight should be on. When she says I should feel it in my butt, and I DON'T, I know I'm doing it wrong. Today, mid-workout, I just had to stop and write down the things I heard that I find annoying. Thank goodness the dvd provides the option to run it as music only, without the instructor's voice.

""Switch it over, hands in both..double 'em up...It's very seldom that I make a mistake but when I do I'm not afraid to admit it."" Jillian makes so many mistakes in this dvd it isn't funny.

Pendulum lunges: ""...keeping knee over ankle, don't want to forward travel...where the knee goes over the ankle."" - Which knee, what ankle. I have no idea what forward travel is, she doesn't demonstrate.

""What's the matter Poodle. What's the matter Julie. Tap. Tap!""

""See what I have to put up with for four months. She's killing me. Stop! Please!""

Bicep curls: ""...curl up three quarters of the way...right to my hand Julie thank you."" Julie was doing it correctly. She was almost the only one doing it correctly.

""Bill I hope you're doing this correctly since you belong to me."" Bill has the worst form of all the participants.

""Sink down Julie! Thank you!""

""Julie don't do it to me right now. Make me proud Julie. Make me proud Julie."" Michaels says as she sits on Julie's back.

""Excuse me Julie leg in! Thank you!"" - Julie was doing it properly.

Curtsies: Awkward for beginner. Not well explained. I should feel them in my gluts...but I don't. Where should my weight be, front leg or back leg?

""Isn't that right Bootie Girl.""

""Isabel, very well done. Boys don't usually like these."" - Is Isabel a boy?

Squat-Leg lifts: ""Working upper and lower body at the same time..."" - my arms are stationary, how am I engaging my upper body?

""Look at you Neal, Bill."" - Bill is clearly lifting his arms too high.

The chest flies are the only exercise Michaels explains entirely.

""Relax Mama.""

Bootie raises...should I be contracting my butt muscles? Michaels doesn't instruct me to.

""Holly's got J. Lo bootie. Holly's got ghetto bootie, big time.""

""Julie, get your leg up. Oh Lord. Always giving me hassle. Always giving me hassle Poodle.""

""I don't want to talk to Bill. I'm gonna go play with Neal.""

""Bill, knees in, feet off the ground. Hello! everybody look at Eric."" She never said to lift your legs. That's why no one is.

Throughout the dvd she says ""3 more""...and a second later ""Last one"". Or ""Let's do 4 more""...then she ends after the next one.",1257897600,6,3562,4.462962962962963

I'm not an incredibly fit person and had not used a workout video in several months due to pregnancy, but jeez, I didn't even crack a sweat.  It also looked like it was filmed in a bargain basement.

Her voice is annoying and she's kind of boring, but she's only on a short time, so I can deal with it.  I love Jillian, but she's a little too cutesy at times.  She's kind of flirty with one of the female contestants, calling her poodle, which I found a little odd to be doing that on a workout dvd.  Then at one point she is showing how to do an exercise, then tells that contestant:  ""I don't want to talk to you, I'm gonna go play with Neil.""  I think she's trying to be cute, but I'm actually embarrassed for her.  It's surprising to see her acting that way.  I love her toughness on the show, and that's what makes her a great trainer.  This other side of her, I'd rather not see, and it is quite unprofessional.  I still think she's great though, and so is the workout, which is the most important thing.  It's still a lot better than watching those twiggy, smiley, annoying women who are all trying to do better than everyone else on the video.  I'd much rather deal with Jillian's cutesyness and watch BL contestants.  I love it!!!

3201890,5,B000WEVGHK,"For about a week now, I've been alternating the Cardio Max Workout with the Power Sculpt Workout.  Honestly.... I'm 27 years old and since I was 17, after high school sports were over, I've been looking for a workout that I can actually LOVE... and I never found it.  I tried everything.  I really really did.  I finally finally FINALLY found one I love!!  Maybe it's because I just started going back to school and have found a new sense of competitiveness inside me- not for others, but for myself, or maybe Biggest Loser is just awesome.  Regardless, I have found that I have so much motivation to do this DVD... and clearly competing with myself to see if I can make it through the whole workout today, or make it to the next level tomorrow.  Sheesh!  Who needs a workout partner!

I know people have complained that the Biggest Losers in the background are distracting because they are doing things wrong, but I actually like it, because I can correct myself by looking at them, knowing they are doing it wrong, then looking at myself and thinking- crap I'm doing it just like they are- I'm doing it wrong!  So then I correct myself.

The first day I wasn't able to get through the whole workout, in fact I only made it 10 minutes out of 20.  I was sore for... well.... I'm still sore from it!!  I could barely walk the next day- I LOVE that feeling- just knowing it's working!  After 4 times of doing it, I can get through the workout, and am so anxious to move on, but I know there is a reason for why this level is harder than the higher levels, and why it needs to be done for at least 2 weeks.  You've really got to jumpstart your metabolism and shock those muscles into action!  Then you really need to maintain it for a few weeks before moving on, otherwise your results may not be what you were expecting.

I'm thinking about purchasing Boot Camp for after my 6 weeks are over on these two DVD's, and possibly alternating it with the Yoga one..... any thoughts on that combo??

As for eating- I am TRYING to eat healthy, but I'm more of a ""natural"" dieter, and natural doesn't mean less calories, so I'm working on it.  I'd rather not eat fake foods.  I'm a honey over splenda kinda girl.

Anyways, I've taken my measurements (but not my weight- bc I don't care for that frustrating number as inches count way more than pounds and it's just discouraging when you don't see the number you want so fast) and took my before pictures, and I can't wait to *hopefully* see results in a few months!!!",1250899200,,2506,4.369330453563715

She can push anyone, regardless of your fitness level, and if you stick with it you WILL see results. I also own her 30 day shred DVD. It's a great muscle building program!

I enjoyed the biggest loser power sculpting workout due to the change of trainers between levels. They keep it upbeat so it doesn't get boring. If the workout becomes to easy just up the amount of weights your lifting. There is no reason you can keep up with this DVD forever-just adding more weight when you need to. I switch btwn 10 lb weights 5 for the weaker muscles groups or extended reps. Keep doing this and you will transform your body! Good Luck!",1248998400,3,914,4.345029239766082

I like to feel a sense of accomplishment after I get done working out but I felt like I got the workout equivalent of jogging on a treadmill for 15 minutes (and I did all three levels.)  I think I was just expecting a little more since I love both Jillian and Bob as trainers.  However, this workout might be better suited for someone who is a beginner. I've been working out for about 4 months with Jillian's 30 day shred, No More Trouble Zones, and BFBM along with Bob's yoga dvd and I don't consider myself ""advanced"" but I'm not really a beginner either.

There were a couple of good exercises when I felt the burn, mainly in Bob's workout.  I felt like a lot of the moves were rushed and proper form wasn't demonstrated so you might not get the full extent of your workout if the exercises are not being performed correctly.  This workout focuses mainly on the upper body and lower body and there are a couple of ""core"" exercises thrown in but I didn't really feel the burn too much in my abs like I do normally when I workout.  I say rent this at your local library like me, or on Netflix (if you have it)  but don't buy it. I suggest trying one of Jillian's videos or the Biggest Loser Yoga!",1245974400,,1227,4.236051502145923
3201896,3,B000WEVGHK,"Well, this is a good workout for beginners. But if you've tried other body sculpt DVD's, you could see how much more this needed to push you. We just bought Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred and I felt like I got a better workout from her 20 minute session than this 50 minute one. And even though I'm an amateur, I could tell that I needed and wanted to push myself a bit more than this DVD offered. If you do get this DVD, I would suggest getting some heavier weights to push yourself.

Another thing I didn't like about this DVD was the repetitive nature of going from one section to the next. You're supposed to ""add"" levels as you go, but it sure felt like the 2nd level exercises were what I just finished in the first (including curtsy lunges, triceps). I would have liked newer and more challenging reps. Working out my triceps for 10 minutes may sound cool, but it's a small muscle and thus burns less calories.

One other factor is that as cool as it is to watch your favorite contestants from the Biggest Loser, they tend to have very poor form, which means you don't always know how to do the exercise right.

If you want to be pushed and want the trainers from Biggest Loser, I'd suggest checking out Jillian Michaels stuff. Challenging and inspiring.",1245974400,,1261,4.4034334763948495

3201909,3,B000WEVGHK,"I bought this DVD along with Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred DVD.  I was a little disapointed with this workout.  The first issue is that none of the former Biggest Loser people in the workout seem to have any idea what they are doing.  Half of the time they are all doing different moves and seem to be clueless as to the order or proper form of the excersizes.  This combined with the fact that most of the time the trainers also do not do the moves leaves you a little lost.  Second, levels two and three are only 10 minutes a piece and feel very rushed with little explanation of what exactly you should be doing.  Jillian (first level) has a little more time to describe form and what muscles are being worked.  Overall, I think the workout is not bad (maybe a little slow) but the DVD could have been put together with a little more thought and time.

Although it is not a flashy video, no music, lights etc.  It is easy to follow and suprisingly we were all in alot of pain the 2nd day after the workout.  It was very effective and fast.  I would suggest that women that have any prior strength training at all use at least 6 pound weights.  I went and bought 8 Lb. weights after the workout because I did not even feel the 5 Lb. pound weights that I used the first time.  But, I definately felt the squats and lunges!

I've been doing it for a few weeks on and off now (on and off because I've been sick, so I try to do it when I don't feel my worst), and I'm starting to see more toned muscles.... especially in my arms.
While doing the exercises, it doesn't seem that you're getting any real ab workout, but the next day you'll feel that you definitely were.
I can't wait until I'm feeling better and able to do the video as I'm supposed to... alternately with the Cardio Max DVD for a total of 5 to 6 days for two weeks at each level.",1233273600,,744,4.102739726027397

I felt like I was in class with Jillian!  She moves through the exercises quickly, so your heart rate stays up.  The exercises are simple, so its easy to maintain proper form.  She does a very good job of showing the moves. I loved it!  I really felt like I had a workout comparable to what I get in my gym class.

By the way, I've had a bilateral mastectomy with TRAM reconstruction.  What that means is that I'm missing about 40% of my tranverse abdominal muscle (the one that runs vertically from the pelvis to under the ribs).  Even with that limitation, I was able to do every exercise that Jillian did in Level 1.  I look forward to trying Level 2 and 3.",1232323200,3,808,4.188311688311688

The workouts are awesome and you know for sure that you've done something good for yourself once you're done! One tip is to make sure you buy some hand weights for this dvd.

They didn't stay together and the trainers didn't always do the whole workout so I felt like I was doing things wrong by watching them.  The kickboxing segment that was supposed to be Level 3 was about as intense as walking.  I see what that trainer isn't on the show anymore, she's just not very good.

3201955,4,B000WEVGHK,"I really debated giving this 5 stars I decided 4 was best. I will explain why. There are 5 segments a warm up, levels 1,2,3 workouts and a cool down. I think the warm up was lacking a bit though. That can easily be solved by jogging in place for a few mintes before starting the workout. The first workout level one is instructed by Jillian and is very good but I did not think there was enough focus on the abs. It is 20 mins. long. I was not tired at all afterwards. There were basics such as squats and lunges combined with handweight exercises. It was tough but if your an advanced exerciser you may want to do level 2 and 3 after level one. Level 2 is instructed by Kim she basically does a 10 mintue segment that most of the exercises are the same but a more advanced version of the ones Jillian did. Side lunges, rows the ab exericses are done sitting up with weights whch is a nice change. Level 3 is instructed by Bob. This is the one that had me sweating there are some exercises involving hand weights and then you go to the floor doing planks and holding them for a long time which gets you sweating. He also has you hold yourself up in a pushup position and that was the killer. The cool down is instructed by Jillan and is basic stretching. The reason this got 4 stars instead of five is this the last 2 workout were not long enough. I don't know may people who can workout for 10 mintues and lose weight. That can be remieded by repeating them. If your out of shape or in a plateau this will work great for you. This is supposed to be a 6 week program where for the frst 2 weeks you do level 1 the next 2 weeks you do level 2 and the last 2 weeks you do level 3. If your like me and gain weight easily and have a sluggish metabolism I suggest you do all 3 levels at every workout. This is a great dvd but like I said the last 2 workouts just are not long enough and that is why I gave it 4 stars. There needs to be a little more to each of those last 2 weokouts. I reccomend buying this and using it but just do all 3 or when you get to levels 2 and 3 I suggest you do the 10 min. segments twice.",1212019200,2,2111,3.9345794392523366

As for the workouts...good grief!  I workout 5-6 days a week, two of those days being devoted to strength training.  This DVD works every single muscle that I need it to and I feel like I'm accomplishing a great deal each workout.  My arms were burning at the end of Jillians Workout and then on to Bobs.  By the Kim's session, I was pooped!  I didn't finish it, but I appreciate that because it gives me something to work toward.  There are some standard exercises (bicep curls, shoulder lifts), some combination exercises (shoulder raises while squatting), and also some non-traditional exercises like lifting out your arms in a V and then back in..that one is a killer!

Then Bob has a 10 min workout which is a killer after doing the other two! theres a 5 min cool down, which honestly should be longer. The dvd is programable so you can select what workouts you want to do. you can also shut off the instructors talking but I've never wanted to do that. I really love this DVD- I love seeing the contests workout because you think- hey if they can do it- I can do it!

But, you can amp up the intensity by increasing the weight of your dumbells or customizing the program to repeat the workouts.  I highly recommend this workout, especially when you combine it with the Cardio Max DVD.  I could see/feel results within a few days.

One note of caution -- these DVDs work every muscle in your body (especially the legs and glutes), so don't be surprised if you are quite sore for a few days after your first workout.  Don't let that discourage you though.  It's definitely worth it!",1208736000,3,765,4.573529411764706

I found this to be a pretty good workout.  I've just started strength training again and found most of the exercises to be challenging esp. those in Bob's section.  I do like that the exercises keep the heart rate up, but the pace and multiple movements can compromise your form which means you won't be getting the true benefit of the exercise and/or possibly end up hurting yourself.  So you have to be careful.

Another thing, for exercises done one side at a time - they aren't always done evenly.  Be sure to count and do the same number of reps per side.",1206057600,65,755,5.696428571428571

You will get stronger, and it will become easier. They are also leveled by weeks, and there are modifications, such as use weights or don't use weights depending on your level. I  used them as they recommended: do each video on alternate days. You will sweat, you will work hard, but the results are amazing! Within two weeks, I could see definition in my arms, and I lost the 5-8 pounds that I was trying to get off for about six months. I feel firmer, more toned, and thinner.(Which I am :)  I also purchased the Biggest Loser Cookbook and the recipes are delicious and satisfying.

I'm only giving it 4 stars because I don't think the Level 1 workout on this DVD, at least for me, is the same intensity as the cardio companion. For most of the exercises I felt like I needed more reps than were done to work the muscle enough. After the first time I did it, I upped it to level 2. Lower weight with more reps gives your muscles nice shape, and as a woman thats more what I'm aiming for rather than strength training. With that said, it is still a fantastic workout, that I do recommend.

But, it's a good pain.  I've seen serious results just after a few weeks in terms of my overall strength, especially my core.

My only complaint is that some of the routines seem rushed and they don't do enough reps in some of the routines.  Some of them you want it to end and end now but others they just whip through it.  I think the lunges are done too quickly and you have to be careful of your knees when you are just starting because the stability isn't there yet.  Man, these guys love their lunges though.

I felt the pain and burn the same day as well as the next day. My only criticism of the work-out is that the movements are quite rapid with the weights and the instruction on body mechanics is poor. My back really hurt after completing the work-out due to the use of 10 pound weights and quick movements. The video does call for heavier weights, but it may be more beneficial to use lighter weights until accustomed to the movements. I played the work-out with trainer instruction, which apparently did not guide me well enough. I will be more careful when I do the work-out next time and pay very close attention to the core.

I felt the levels did progress and were ranked appropriately, unlike other reviewers. If the movements are done correctly, the intensity of the levels do increase with each trainer. I could barely keep up at the end and I am used to 50 minute routines without a problem. I would definately recommend this work-out DVD to those who are serious about training and/or weight loss.

Now let me preface this with saying, I am extremely fit.  I work out 4-5x a week doing cardio for 30-45 minutes at a time.  (And when I do cardio the sweat is literally dripping off me in waves.)  I also have been doing sculpting DVDs 2x a week for the past 6 months.  This workout kicked my butt!  Level one is definitely easy enough for intermediate, yet will still challenge those who are in good shape.  I just added Level 2 today, and I actually had to stop the DVD and take a 60 second breather because I thought I would either throw up or pass out!  You've gotta work me REALLY hard to make that happen!

My only ""criticism"" is that I don't think this DVD is appropriate for beginners.  However, after reading some reviews it is clear beginners are doing it and thriving on it.  My advice to a beginner would be to concentrate on form before you concentrate on reps or how heavy your weights are.  In the DVD a lot of the participants have really poor form.  (Even though the trainers give them a thumbs up.)  Watch the trainer and copy them.  Once your form is perfect add weights and/or increase your reps.  I'm sure any trainer will tell you they'd rather you do one really good move than 10 of the same move with poor form.

If you want to loose weight and you stick with this DVD I can't imagine you wouldn't change your life and body.

I will be using this DVD alot more in my workouts.  I did the 20-minute sculpt with Jillian and really liked it!  She uses hand weights (2 or 3 pound) and hits upper body, abs and lower body with some great moves, both standing and floor work (a padded exercise mat works well for the floor work).  I did this segment in between some cardio and other weight training, and while Jillian doesn't have you jumping/hopping around, I was still sweating through the whole thing - but I was also wearing a sweatshirt as well :-).  This is a great routine to incorporate with some cardio for a full workout!",1467676800,6,737,4.266187050359712

  I workout 6 days a week (mod -high intensity),  This makes a good 2nd workout for my busy day.  If you are used to weights, gym, etc.. It's not that great.",1466553600,,177,4.117647058823529
