8416093,5,B0044FEYUE,"This documentary shows Ravi Shankar in concert and in his homeland. There are some fascinating teachings shared regarding his music. Although Mr. Shankar is getting older in the DVD, he plays with great passion and spirit. I have used this DVD to teach orchestra classes regarding world music and alternative styles. It was nice to see the master teaching fundamentals of string playing that apply across all styles.",1374364800,2,416,5.132352941176471
8416094,5,B0044FEYUE,"I can't recommend this video too highly to anyone interested in Ravi Shankar and Indian music. Filmed in 2008, Shankar discusses Indian classical music and demonstrates its principles before an audience at Paris' Salle Playel. Ravi plays very little, but directs an ensemble including tabla player Tanmoy Bose and daughter Anoushska Shankar. There are 3 programs on the disc: 1) A documentary featuring footage from the lesson; 2) The full lesson; 3) Extracts of vocal, instrumental and dance performances from Shankar's centre in New Delhi. This video has the fullest explanation I've seen by Shankar of Indian classical music and his involvement with it.  The production is excellent.  This dvd is a good companion to other videos of Shankar, including Ravi Shankar in Portrait and the newly rereleased Raga.",1304899200,7,810,5.271317829457364
