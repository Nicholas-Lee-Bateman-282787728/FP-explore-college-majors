784189,2,6303953492,"Who's more powerful than King Kong?  What creature is smarter than Mothra, more agile than Rodan, and more terrifying than King Ghidorah?  Why, a giant shrimp, of course!  Why not just throw in a mutated hush puppie and  a monstrous bowl of alien cole-slaw?  Heck, during the fight, the monsters  can destroy a tartar/cocktail sauce factory.  Coming off the high of  Monster Zero, ToHo takes a giant step backward with an all-new creative  team at the helm.  Some view this as a refreshing change of pace.  However,  director Jun Fukada's spy film influences just don't belong in the Godzilla  universe.  Masuro Sato's score, while complementing the visuals, just can't  compare to the Maestro's work.  The actors perform well, especially ToHo  regulars Akira Takarada and Kumi Mizuno, and are pretty well-developed.  The inclusion of Mothra seems rather arbitrary and is not handled with much  care.  The less said about Ebirah(the Sea Monster), the better.  A minor  G-film.",959212800,2,976,5.121794871794871
784190,5,6303953492,"It's true!  This movie was originally made for Kong.  If you watch real carefuly (or not real carefuly, you chose) you can catch Godzilla beating his chest, sleeping in a cave, crushing planes with his hands, and looking  at women!

784191,3,6303953492,"""Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster"" is probobly one of the least entertaining Godzilla movie. I don't even think that I have watched it all the way through. The only thing that saves the movie is the cool battle  with Ebira {the sea monster}, and when Godzilla battles the ""Red  Bamboo"" air force. It is a very boring film up until they awaken  Godzilla and he breaks out of the mountain. Who does Godzilla think he is,  King Kong? Why is he chasing a japanese girl though out the film? Because  this movie was origially suppost to star the great ape Kong. Obviously,  between ""Godzilla vs. Monster Zero"" and ""Godzilla vs. The  Sea Monster"", the Godzilla suit was either dropped off the Empire  State Building {ha, ha, ha}, or body slammed repeatedly like Megalon in  ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"". The suit shows alot of wear and tear  because in between these 2 films, the suit was used in ""Ultraman""  shows. They added dumb frills to Godzilla's neck and called him Jirus? Most  japanese children were not fooled. Godzilla looks like he's wearing cargo  pants and an oversized t-shirt in this film. So, if your just being  introduced to the Godzilla series with this film, you will not think much  of the king of the monsters. Start with the original 1956 movie.",953164800,,1252,4.65296803652968
784192,2,6303953492,"This movie is definitely not worth watching.  The action scenes were nothing to look at and the fight between Godzilla nad Ebirah practically made me fall asleep.

784193,2,6303953492,"This movie had the unfortunate task of following the excellent ""Godzilla vs. Monster Zero"", something that would have been daunting to any film.  And, perhaps predictably, this 1967 flick doen't  live up to the task, though it wasn't entirely the movie makers' fault.  The scaling back of budgets at least partially forced producer Tomiyuki Tanaka to  take a nearly-finished script from the next scheduled King Kong movie and  insert it into the Godzilla series, with mixed results.  On the plus side,  Akira Takarada and Kumi Mizuno do well in their roles, particularly  Takarada (cast against type) as a surly criminal.  Godzilla looks  remarkably familiar...indeed, the G-suit is the same one left over from the  previous movie.  Ebirah (the Sea Monster appropriately named after a  Japanese piece of shrimp) is impressive looking, but proves to be no match  in battling the big G.  Mothra makes a quick return as the protective  goddess-monster, with nice results.  However, the music, minus Akira  Ifukube, suffers greatly.  This in definitely not one of the higher points  of the Showa Godzilla series, but the island locale at least tries to break  kaiju tradition, in leading away from the usual scenes of city-wide  destruction.  You can also see where the B-52s undoubtedly got their  inspiration for ""Rock Lobster""!  This is for the kiddies at best.",946944000,,1360,5.128440366972477

784361,4,6303953492,"One of the stranger Godzilla films, this is one I hadn't seen since I was a kid. I was amazed how vivid my memory of the battle between Godzilla and the sea monster was.

The story is contrived to say the least, but it doesn't keep it from being a fun time. Safe cracker and some guys end up on a boat that gets trashed by the title creature and they wash up on an island where there is some secret nuclear bomb building. Fleeing the Red Bamboo, our stars along with a native from the island of Mothra enter a cave on the side of a mountain where something is sleeping! ...Guess who? Godzilla! Ha-ha!

No Godzilla action until 53 minutes in, but at least we get some different battleground (in the sea). There is also more silliness like Monster Zero where Godzilla does some silly dancing, but it's all in fun.

784479,5,6303953492,"""Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster"" (Original Japanese title ""Ebirah:  Horror of the Deep"".) is the first truly great Godzilla movie since the original classic.  Everything seems to work here and work well.  Very good fight sequences, great visuals and a well written script.

The main reason I believe this movie works so well is its diversion from the norm.  It's nice for once to see a Godzilla movie in a totally different setting than we are used to.  Though we do see some familiar scenes of Godzilla taking down fighter jets and destroying buildings, it is seen a little less here than usual which I think works to the movie's advantage.

The storyline is actually quite good as well.  A group of Japanese men find themselves marooned on a remote island named Devil's Island.  The island is home to a terrorist organization named Red Bamboo.  They are secretly conducting heavy water experiments for a possible attack on Japan.  The island is threatened by a menacing sea creature named Ebirah that could attack the island at anytime.  However Red Bamboo keeps the creature at bay by spraying a yellow liquid made from fruit indegenous to the island.  The castaways discover that Red Bamboo has captured a large group of people from a nearby island tribe (Which is home to one of Godzilla's fremenies Mothra.) and are forcing them to work as slaves to manufacture the liquid.  A young female tribe member escapes captivity and meets the small group of men.  They agree to help her and her people escape anyway they can, but they don't see how they could get past Ebirah.  While making their way through one of the island's many caves the group is stunned to find none other than Godzilla alseep on the island.  They decide, through use of a crude lightening rod, to awaken the monster in hopes he can face and defeat Ebirah.  Meanwhile back on the slaves' home island, the remaining tribe members wait for Mothra to awake in order to ask for her help in saving their captive tribe members.

I was never bored with this movie and enjoyed it from start to finish.  The fight sequences between Godzilla and Ebirah are better than average which definitely helps this movie work.  Overall, it's just plain fun and that's what the Godzilla movies are all about.

As I have noted in my reviews of other films in this series, it's great to see this movie in its original form with the original dialogue track.  Far better than that horrible dubbing we all were subjected to when we saw these movies on Sunday afternoon television.  The picture quality is also terrific.  The way the movie was supposed to (and should) be seen.

See the original ""Gojira"" (Not the vastly inferior Americanized version with the late Raymond Burr titled ""Godzilla:  King of the Monsters"".) by all means, but see ""Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster"" too!  The original Toho Studio Godzilla series does not have a bad movie in it in my opinion (Though I will be the first to admit some are better than others.) but make a point to see the two best movies of the series.  You won't be disappointed.",1381363200,,3063,4.672897196261682

784483,2,6303953492,"The first of Godzilla's two island adventure films, GODZILLA VS THE SEA MONSTER is an immediate departure from the earlier entries in the series, which should come as no surprise considering the lack of involvement from director Ishiro Honda, composer Akira Ifukube, and the limited involvement of Eiji Tsuburaya overseeing the special effects. The script, as originally written, was to include King Kong in place of Godzilla, which accounts for many of Godzilla's atypical mannerisms, as well. The combined effect of each of these changes amounts to one of the weaker entries in the series, with subpar special effects and an uninteresting storyline. This time around, a group of unassuming teenagers happen upon an evil terrorist organization while searching for one of their brothers who was lost at sea. The Red Bamboo defend the island from a giant crustacean known as Ebirah using a chemical weapon that is produced by the natives, who, Ryota and his friend learn, are being enslaved. When it is discovered that Godzilla is also hibernating on the island, Ryota and the others work up a plan to destroy the Red Bamboo and free the slaves with the help of Godzilla and Mothra! GODZILLA VS THE SEA MONSTER seems to draw a strong influence from the industrial espionage that frequented the Bond series in England at the time, and hardly reflects the growing interest in science fiction from the previous films. Ebirah's presence is inconsequential to the plot, and the action sequences are disappointing to say the least. Godzilla and Ebirah even volley a boulder back and forth in one of their few grudge matches. The island series would end the following year with the birth of the SON OF GODZILLA.

784484,4,6303953492,"This film, like many in the Showa Series of Godzilla films, is a little bit silly (or maybe a lot silly) but switches attention from anti-US sentiment to anti-China sentiment.

784556,4,6303953492,"I really loved this movie when I was a little boy and I revisited it with pleasure recently with my 10 y.o. daughter. The story is about four guys (three rather average young ones and one rather unusual older one) whose yacht is sunk by a mysterious sea monster (Ebirah, a kind of giant crayfish) and who find themselves on an isolated island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. They soon discover that this island is the secret hideout of a kind of evil military organization which enslaves natives of neighboring islands for reason initially unknown. And later they find that this island has also one more, really HUGE secret!

This is a deliberately light and humorist and even a little bit silly Godzilla movie, but it is also one of my favorites. My daughter liked it so much that I had to buy her a plush Ebirah on e-bay, to go with her plush Godzilla... Godzilla appears in the movie only in the middle but after that there is a lot of him and he gives a great show. This movie also contains one of the best performances of already legendary Mothra song...

784565,3,6303953492,"Since the late 1960s, when Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster (Nankai no Daiketto) first aired on U.S. television--there was never a domestic theatrical release--the movie opened with footage from later in the film of the title's sea monster (uber-lobster Ebirah) destroying a yacht, ostensibly owned by Yata, the brother of our young protagonist Ryta. However, it's clear that it's the same yacht later commandeered by Ryta because its name, Yahlen, is clearly visible on the hull. The film then cuts to a dance competition, where Ryta hopes to win a boat so he may go and rescue his lost brother. Missing is the actual opening from the Japanese version, in which the siblings' mother goes to a medium, who tells her that her son cannot be found in the land of the dead, which is what motivates Ryta to embark on his quest. Thankfully, this Sony release offers the full-length Japanese version, in anamorphic widescreen, with a choice of subtitles or English audio. The English dub, however, is the horrendous made-in-Hong-Kong international version; it's not the superior Walter Reade-Sterling TV version (which featured Hal Linden, TV's Barney Miller, as the voice of Yoshimura, the bank robber played by Akira Takarada), since it would not have fit the full-length film.

The increasing financial hardships that had begun to plague Japanese movie studios in the mid- to late-'60s--which would eventually lead to a near-total collapse of the Japanese film industry--began to reveal themselves in the production of Sea Monster. Rather than the intricate city sets that effects director Eiji Tsuburaya had crafted so painstakingly in earlier films, most of the monster action takes place on the much sparser Letchi Island set. Still, most of the monster scenes are well directed and include a few superlative moments, such as Godzilla's attack on the base of the Red Bamboo--the military organization, presumably communist, that has enslaved the natives of Infant Island and is secretly building nuclear weapons on Letchi--and the MIG jet assault on Godzilla himself.

To this time, most Godzilla movies--and the bulk of Toho's daikaiju and science fiction releases--had been scored by Akira Ifukube. For Sea Monster, Composer Masaru Sato provided the musical score, which made for a very different experience for those accustomed to Ifukube's familiar style. Sato had scored Godzilla Raids Again (Gigantis, the Fire Monster) and The Abominable Snowman (Half Human), but his greatest claim to fame was having provided the the musical soundtracks for numerous films by Akira Kurosawa. His work for Sea Monster is highly enjoyable on its own, yet as a Godzilla movie score, it oftentimes seems too playful--particularly during the MIG attack on Godzilla. It's a rocking, guitar-driven piece, its riffs reminiscent of the Ventures. Some of the incidental music for scenes on the island has a Mondo Exotica feel, reminding one of Martin Denny and Les Baxter's lounge lizard compositions (not that this is a bad thing, said the confirmed old lounge lizard). Sato would go on to score most of the Godzilla films directed by Jun Fukuda, and while the mood his music sets deviates significantly from anything Ifukube might ever have imagined, it in its way, it certainly keeps the scores from coming across as stale retreads.

This DVD release is pretty much bare bones, with just a few trailers as extra features, but the very nice, anamorphic print of the original full-length film is certainly a coup for Godzilla completists.",1265587200,3,3516,5.175746924428823

784628,4,6303953492,"I have to say I was really excited to finally see the uncut original version of ""Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster"", to date my only exposure to the film came through my repeated viewing of Mystery Science Theater's riffed version of the film. Unlike the other Godzilla film featured in MST3K (Godzilla vs. Megalon), I always felt the ""Sea Monster"" was a decent kaiju film film, and actually one of the better of late 60's Godzilla films.

The titular Sea Monster in the film is Ebirah, a giant lobster that patrols the seas around a remote island. An island used by a nefarious para-military group known as Red Bamboo who are using the secret island to build an aresenal of deadly weapons. Using slave labor, Red Bamboo has also created a chemical which repels the deadly Ebirah, ensuring that they are the only people who can approach or depart from the island without ending up as lobster food.

Four unlikely thieves stumble into this hideout while looking for a missing fisherman. There they discover the Red Bamboo operation, and devise a plan to free the slaves. Toss Godzilla into the mix, and add just a dash of Mothra, and this is a fun little entry into Toho series.

This is actually a really fun, character driven film. The interaction between the four men and the runaway slave girl is a lot of fun. If you are hoping for tons of monster fights, or watching Godzilla flatten Tokyo, then you may be disappointed. Godzilla doesn't really make an appearance until the final third of the film, and as you can imagine his fight scenes with the water-bound Ebirah are kind of limited. Godzilla does get in a quick fight with a second nemesis known as Condra, and tackles some fighter jets as well, but the fight scenes aren't the focus of the film. Mothra, though playing a vital part, has very little screentime.

While not the best Godzilla film in the series, this is a fun entry and worth picking up for fans of the series.",1263772800,,1930,4.585507246376811
784629,2,6303953492,"There's not much to say about Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster.  The plot is minimal, and revolves around a group of stowaways on a remote island who come across a hot slave girl named Daiyo and end up battling a terrorist organization that is constructing nuclear weapons for some reason.  Also, there's a giant lobster named Ebirah (which is a Japanese word for shrimp...did they ever explain this?) that guards the island and ends up fighting Godzilla, who is hibernating inside a mountain (they certainly never explain THAT).  Oh, there's also a giant condor that comes out of nowhere to attack Godzilla at one point.

Despite a lazy script that's rife with unbelievable coincidences and logical fallacies, Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster is a watchable, if unremarkable entry in the series.  The effects budget was obviously drastically cut since the previous film, which is why most of the action revolves around the humans.  Luckily, the cast features some regulars who are always fun to watch (Kumi Mizuno, Akihiko Hirata, and Akira Takarada, among others), as well as an absolutely fantastic score by Masaru Sato, best-known for his work on several Akira Kurosawa classics as well as a few other Godzilla films.

Hot butter and lemon will never be the same after Ebirah. But that's not what this movie is about.

Nor the exceptional troupe of jazz-dancing worshippers who spend three whole days trying to 'waken' their awesome god when in all probability said giant-moth god was probably waiting for the show to finish before heading out to do the decent god-thing. But that's not what its about either.

A rural boy has only the word of a clairavoyant, on faith alone he sets out to be scammed by city-slickers who he just takes on as crew in his god-given quest, and his lost brother is even worse, turning our human foibles into strengths that counter the real evil in our midst, sins simply forgiven because it is obvious we have more important fish to fry.

I have to say that as  I watch this film I cant believe how clear the colors are and the hues, you'll notice it during the day time scenes. This Godzilla film is one of my favorite Godzilla movies of the 1960s. I like this film because it is kind of like watching Godzilla in his psychedelic 1960s stage. I guess that is because this film was released in 1966 in Japan the year before the summer of love 1967. The mothra twins make an appearence and supply thier flower power 1960s punch. Godzillas foe Ebirah a giant lobster is a whimpish but formidable foe but nothing like king kong 1962. The new dubbing is not good, and the music playing when Godzilla has the fight with the Red Bamboo jets is really stupid and at times embarrasing. There are no special features on this dvd, but it is worth buying as I said the remastering in high defintion is incredible. There were times watching this film I thought it was filmed a few years ago, not in 1966. Hats off to Sony the transfer of this film on this dvd edition is mind boggeling. Jun Fukuda directs this film and does a great job in place of the usual director of Godzilla films Inohiro Honda. Masaru Sato does an excellent job on the music score for this film.

784840,3,6303953492,"I guess if you have to write about this movie, I would say it was a pretty good Godzilla movie. I saw this movie at least 4 times on channel 9 & Channel 11 back in the early 70's. However, I didn't know that this movie was actually going to be King Kong's movie after King Kong Escapes, also a GREAT MOVIE! It was the first to introduce a monster against a robot replica. It's just a shame that Toho Ltd could only made 2 King Kong movies because I know eventually, there would've been a rematch against Kong & his arch nemesis, Godzilla. As we all know the big G bit the big one in their first and only meeting, making Kong, the REAL king of all monsters! But something tells me that the japanese co. Toho ltd wouldn't have allowed Kong to win again. My guess is they would have made Kong & Godzilla friends, fighting side by side against another hybrid of King Ghidorah and possibly another Mechani Kong or Mechagodzilla. It would have been interesting to see this battle since the Japanese Kong ""grows strength from electricity"" as was said in King kong vs. Godzilla. This would mean that King Kong would've destroyed King Ghidorah singlehandedly because that's what the monster spews from its three heads! But alas, I guess RKO studios wasn't able to work with Toho Ltd, so these scenarios and many others, will never be. Still, it would have been great to watch, seeings that the new Kong movie, Kong was shrunk to 25 feet, which is puny compared to the 60 + foot versions used in kk escapes & kk vs. godzilla. By the way, have you ever noticed that the dimensions of Godzilla & the Japanese Kong, seem to be much taller when you see how small most of the buildings around them were. One other question, didn't King Seesar have the same monster voice that the Japanese Kong had? Did this mean that Kong was going to be Godzilla's ally when Godzilla fought Megalon & Gigan? Would Godzilla have needed the chumpy Jet Jaguar if this scenario happened? I guess we'll never know..",1139529600,,1980,4.457300275482094
784841,4,6303953492,"Here the story is king. The story is very well written and every thing is excellent, except there is not that much Godzilla in this film. He doesn't show up until the end. In most Showa Godzilla movies, definitely in the other series, they show him at the beginning as well, but not here. The lack of the big G hurts the movie at times because the story becomes dull at some parts when you are waiting for G's arrival.

I am a huge Godzilla fan for 18 years, and I have now seen and own 22 of the 28 Godzilla movies, not including the American Godzilla movie also known as GINO. Out of all of those, this is not the worst, but actually one of the best in the Showa series just for the incredible story and special effects that this movie had for it's time.

Some footage from previous movies here, but they are hard to notice and overall the film is well done. The Sea Monster is kind of lack luster and isn't much of a challenge for Godzila.

This version is the international dub, an english soundtrackj recorded in japan in the 60's. It blows. The otherwise inferior American TV version, called GODZILLA VERSUS THE SEA MONSTER on the title card, is definately worth tracking down

for its great vocal performances by Peter Fernandes of Speed Racer fame and Hal Linden from Barney Miller as the bank robber.  Also the corney music during the jet battle was excised in that version.

For the kids: WHAT MONSTERS DID GODZILLA FIGHT????

here is a list of the monsters he faught in his movie series .. The # after each monster indicates the number of times Godzilla faught them. a ""K"" indicates if Godzilla, or an ally of his, killed the monster. If there is no K that means that they away. Sometimes Godzilla will kill an enemy and another of the same species will show up later. Like Anguirus, who was killed by Godzilla. Later a new friendlier Anguirus showed up and faught side by side with Godzilla. Still later, another Anguirus faught against Godzilla. Same goes for Mothra, Spiga and others. Rodan faught Godzilla but was convinced (telepathicaly) by Mothra to join forces with him. Godzilla himself seems immortal. One dies and another always appears.  The first Godzilla was killed in 1954. Some part of his body, possibly his cells, but likely his heart, grew into the Godzilla from GIANT MONSTERS ALL-OUT ATTACK. His bones were collected and turned into the KIRYU in GODZILLA AGAINST MECHAGODZILLA. A second Godzilla appeared in GODZILLA Raids again in 1955. Godzilla disintegrated in GODZILLA VS, DESTOROYAH in 1996, but reapeared at the end. This was probably Godzilla's son, now fully grown. Godzilla was back alive again in GODZILLA 2000,  this may also have been one of Godzilla's sons.  If one counts, there may have been as many as eight Godzillas or there may be only one. By now we don't really have to know how Godzilla keeps coming back, only that he always does The same goes for his fellow monsters, like Mothra, King Kong, Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, Jason and Freddy.  It sort of falls into the same catagory as ""How can James Bond still be young and still a spy, when we know he was a commander in World War II ?"" Or, ""How can Superman or Wonder Woman or Captain America still be around since we read of their adventures fighting Natzis in the 40s and Communists in the 50s? ""  Answer:  They just are.  Or better yet. ""How can Peter Parker have been in high school and collage for the better part of thirty years?"" Answer: He just was. Thats all. Its better not to think about it, and in the end its not important.  If Godzilla gets killed its for dramatic purposes. and when he returns, even if its not explained, it to make us fans, and millions of childre, happy. That said here is the monster list.

Godzilla faught SPYLAR, WARGILGAR, ZADLAR, JELLAR, NEEDLAR, JAKIRO and a few others.  Also in the animated american series from Hanna Barbera Godzilla faught at least 40 different monsters

CYBERSAUR AND ALL-TERRAINTULA two huge robot weapons, and other assorted aliens, mutants and walking statues..

Inoshiro Honda's previous films in the series delivered their message about the dangers of nuclear weapons well, but Fukuda turns the series 180 degrees and goes for sheer entertainment instead.

As with the Son of Godzilla DVD, this edition presents a cyrstal-clear widescreen image that restores the film to what it originally was. The VHS version is blurred with terrible sound and pan-and-scan, but the DVD version contains none of those flaws. In addition, the DVD edition puts back many elements that were edited out of the VHS version, including the opening credits. The film makes a lot more sense in this format and presentation and, unlike the VHS version, doesn't make you feel you're missing something. There are no extras to speak of, but the movie itself gets an A+ for image and sound quality. Most importantly, however, the DVD offers the original dialogue track in Japanese (with subtitles option) that eliminates the horrible dubbing of the previous versions. It's amazing how much better the film is when you realize it's the actual actors' voices and not those of some poor quality American voice-over actor trying to sound Japanese.",1109808000,36,1799,4.976744186046512

One of the wackier Godzilla films, this one doesn't see the big G until quite far in.  In the meantime we're treated to a yellow cardigan wearing criminal/thief tagging along with some teens looking for a third guys brother who was lost at sea.  Eventually the boat meets up with Ebirah, the giant lobster and title antagonist.  They're crashed onto an island where the amusing baddies are manufacturing nuclear material for nefarious purposes.  The beautiful Kumi Mizuno is tanned nicely as a displaced native of Mothra's Infant Island.  When Godzilla is finally awakened, he dispatches Ebirah with the kind of crunching we're all used to at seafood restaurants, but not before playing some kick *ss volleyball with boulders.  I saw Godzilla's Revenge long before this and now the stock footage used in that film makes more sense seeing it here and Son of Godzilla.

784922,4,6303953492,"Godzilla - Ebirah - Mothra: Battle in the South Seas (aka ""Godzila vs. the Sea Monster"") is an underrated little film.  It's one of the few Godzilla movies to focus more on the human element than the monster boppin' action.  I found the idea of the man's search for his brother on an island inhabited by rogue terrorists (the Red Bamboo; never referred to by name in the English dub for some reason) quite interesting, and Godzilla is treated with a fair amount of dignity.  The Red Bamboo jet squadron attack on Godzilla is pretty novel, too.  Not for everyone, but if you can look past the relative lack of imposing monster battles and appreciate it's human touch, it's one of the better Godzilla films to come out of the decade.",1074470400,,731,4.557251908396947
784923,3,6303953492,"This is an OK movie. It has a couple bad plot holes and Godzilla doesn't look very good. Also Godzilaa has very Kong-like behavior.(Big Breath) That's because Toho(People who make the Godzilla movies) was planning on making a Kong Flick but didn't have the money to make a good suit so erased King Kong and put in Godzilla! WHEW! Anyway at the very end of this incredibly long boring movie Godzilla wakes up and fights 3 things. A pathetic lobster, a giant bird, and a couple of airplanes. OKay, the scene when Godzilla stomps on the Red Bamboo base is kinda cool looking and with Mothra's breif appearence it's worth watching if your a Godzilla fan.",1063324800,,650,4.612068965517241
784993,4,6303953492,This one is a pretty good Godzilla feature. You get a giant crab and a monster vulture along with Mothra and of course the big G. A group of Nazis wannabe's are building nukes and using native (Mothra worshipers) slaves to do the work and its up to Mothra and Godzilla to save the world.....again. One of the better early Godzilla movies.,1062201600,,338,4.467741935483871
784994,4,6303953492,"This is a pretty good Godzilla flic with a good plot and cool monster. You even get Mothra thrown into the mix along with the Cosmo's twins. The problem i have with this installment is the very cheezy surfer music which im sure was very ""hip"" at the time of filming but very lame for a monster movie (im an old geezer and never liked the surfer stuff in any time period). All in all a pretty enjoyable movie. I would like to see this one on DVD someday.",1062028800,,453,4.101123595505618
784995,5,6303953492,"This is the third Godzilla film i`ve ever seen, and when i waz young, i used to think it was sequel to ""Godzilla 1985"", but don`t get me to explain. Any way here`s the storyline: Ryota I think his name was, meets his friends at a dancing contest and they leave and go of to the harbour. They see the Yalin I think the ship was called, and decide to stay the night, wgen they confront a rubber aboard, who lets them stay the night. When everyone wakes up, the ship is sailing. Ryota thought the ship was a gift from the Gods and deciced to take it to search for Rota, his brotha. And Ebirah (Larry the Lobster) destroys the ship(yaucht) and they fall out of the yaucht wearing life-jackets so
why`ll onconscious they drift a shore on Letchi island, were they
meet a girl native from Infant Island, home of Modra (Mothra).And
they learn of these evil military folks from Japan (or China) on the island who have takin' prisoners from Infant Island to Letchi
to make a powder i think it was to keep Ebirah The Sea Monster from attacking them, and any way. Ryota raids the military base with his friends, and escapes the island on a balloon. And his friends end up going to a cave, and some guy says let`s wake Gojira King Of The Monsters up. Meanwhile Ryota ends up at Infant Island and finds his brother and they go to Letchi where that guy wakes up Godzilla, and he battles Ebirah the Sea Monster
(aka Larry the Lobster). And Godzilla attacks the military base, the people of Infant Island that are prisoners on letchi call Mothra, Mothra takes them away, and Godzilla escapes the island jus before an explosion destroys him. THE",1026691200,,1627,4.426666666666667
784996,2,6303953492,"This really isn't a very good movie, featuring a lame plot and perhaps the worst Godzilla fight scenes of the series.  Some bad guys (we never learn who they are) are secretly building atomic weapons on an island in the South Pacific.  This island is protected by a ""sea monster"" (basically a gigantic, goofy-looking lobster), but the bad guys have a secret liquid which repels the monster.  Inhabitants of nearby islands, including Infant Island (home of Mothra), have been captured and enslaved in order to keep making this juice.  A young man and two friends hijack a boat (along with a bank robber) to search for the lad's brother, whose ship was recently lost in the area.  Their ship is destroyed by the sea monster, and they wash up on the island of the bad guys. It turns out that Godzilla is hunkered down inside a mountain on the island (don't ask me how he got there), and the protagonists eventually succeed in waking him up.  He goes a couple of rounds with the sea monster and a giant bird (not Rodan) who comes out of nowhere, finds time to stomp around the secret military installation a little, and takes on the obligatory jets who try to take him out.
The two fights between Godzilla and the sea monster are quite unsatisfying.  In the first one, they play volleyball with a boulder for a while, which looks as silly as it sounds.  The fact that much of the fight takes place in and under water only adds to the distinct blandness of the struggle.  To my eyes, Godzilla acted like he was half-drunk the whole time.  The funniest part of the whole thing is when Godzilla decides to sit down and watch a native girl for a while--the MST3K guys are exactly right when they say he looks like he is sitting on a toilet.
In summation, the plot is banal, the fighting scenes are boring, and the sea monster is one of Godzilla's least formidable opponents.  Any Godzilla fan can sit through this flick and get a morsel or two of enjoyment out of it, but it's not a movie you are going to want to watch very often.  If you just want to see a good monster movie, you would do well to skip right past this one.",1016841600,3,2117,4.4
784997,2,6303953492,"Godzilla and a giant crab (or shrimp, whatever) do battle near a remote island where a nefarious band of super criminals tampers with nuclear energy and enslaves innocent natives. By the mid-'60s, the most generous thing one can say of Japanese sci-fi is that it was chuckle-headed camp humor. This juvenile sci-fi flick is okay for ""kiddies"" that do not discriminate against bad movies. Godzilla appears as a bizarre antihero that protects the innocent and saves humanity. The special effects add to the chuckles of viewers who understand the unique appeal of cheesy movies. Joel and the robots of MST3K fame once gave this film the royal treatment. When the giant monsters bat a large rock back and forth like a volleyball...well, you get the idea. Sensible viewers beware. ;-)",997228800,2,779,5.0

785000,3,6303953492,"I've been a Godzilla fan since I was eight years old, but as a child I never thought much of this outing in the series. No city stomping, a so-so adversary, too much of the human plot, and Godzilla doesn't show up until  the halfway point. But as a mature Godzilla fan, I've come to appreciate it  a great deal. Director Jun Fukuda, a director of crime dramas, takes over  the series and creates an action/adventure story that contrasts  interestingly with Ishiro Honda's science-fiction oriented early Godzilla  epics. Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster (the international title is  ""Ebirah, the Horror of the Deep"") is essentially a fun spy  adventure on an exotic island with SPECTRE-like villains and some monsters  tossed in to add to the excitement. The plot is excellent and the acting is  very good, especially Takarada as the good-hearted thief (...). I  still don't think much of Ebirah; he's just a big lobster and not up to  snuff with some of Godzilla's other adversaries. All in all, a fun  adventure movie. ...",966988800,,1019,4.793103448275862
