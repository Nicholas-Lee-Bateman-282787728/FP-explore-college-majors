6040892,5,B00FZ4KT84,"Enough Said is a  typical romantic comedy following the pattern of boy meets girl, boy and girl separate and boy and girl get back together.  What makes Enough Said an interesting film are the performances of James Gandolfini (as Albert) and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (as Julia), as an unlikely couple. Both are middle-aged with one marriage behind them and have a daughter.  It is also a film about letting go as Julia's daughter is about to go away to college, and she finds the change in her life less than easy to cope with.

The interesting plot twist of the film is that Julia (who is a masseuse) has also met a poet named Marianne (played by Catherine Kenner) who turns out to be Albert's ex-wife.  Julia and Marianne bond together and she becomes one of Julia's clients. But, when Marianne relates many complaints she had for her former spouse to Julia, she is conflicted about continuing to date Albert and telling Marianne the truth about her relationship.

Enough Said is a down-to-earth film, brilliantly written and directed by Nicole Holofcener.  The film will certainly resonate with all of the divorced, middle-aged members of the audience (among which my wife and I can count us).  The characters are very real and I would say are based in real life experiences. Enough Said, like all good romantic comedies, has its share of laughs and heartaches.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus is wonderfully serious and funny in her role as she travels to her clients, toting her massage table with her sometimes with humorous effect.  The mark of a great performance is if an actor can convince you they are the role they are playing. James Gandolfini succeeds in convincing us he is an insecure, middle-aged man who is giving love a second chance.  He brings to his role simplicity and directness that makes acting look easy. Toni Collete has a great part as Julia's close friend and there are some funny moments between her and Ben Falcone, who plays her husband Will. Enough Said is an engaging film that will be memorable long after you leave the theater.",1382659200,9,2048,4.7733711048158645
6040893,4,B00FZ4KT84,"""Enough Said"" (2013 release; 93 min.) brings the story of Eva (played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a middle-aged divorcee whose daughter is about to go off the college across the country. As the movie opens, we see Eva make house calls to her clients to provide massages. One evening, Eva tags along with her friends to a party, and there gets introduced to several people, including Albert (played by James Gandolfini), also a middle-aged and divorced (we later learn that his daughter is also about to go off to college). Eva also gets introduced to Marianne (played by Catherine Keener), a well-known poet who is lonely and hires Eva to give her massages (and bend her ear about her lousy ex). Eva and Albert go on a first date, and things are going surprisingly well. Meanwhile Eva is dealing with her daughter's pending departure. At this point we are about 30 min. into the movie, and to tell you more of the plot would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, this movie is a tour-de-force of writer-director Nicole Holofcener, best known for her 2006 movie ""Friends With Money"". Holofcener brings us an outstanding slice of life that really resonated with me (like the main characters, I am middle-aged and divorced, and have gone through the sending off kids to college phase as well). This is not some Hollywood phantasy: instead we get to know (and like) believable characters. Second, the acting performances are nothing short of top-notch. Let's start with Julia Louis-Dreyfus: while there are some laugh-inducing scenes in the movie (as some point she refers to someone as a ""human TripAdvisor"", ha!), this is mostly a relationship drama, and we get to see Louis-Dreyfus in a dramatic role, which she rarely gets to play. It just makes you wish that she would take on big-screen roles more often (she has done some voice-characters for kids movies, but has rarely, if ever, been in a lead role). Then there is James Gandolfini, in his last major role before his shocking and untimely death earlier this year. Best known for his role in The Sopranos, he plays the big cuddly teddy-bear type guy, and you just can't help but shake your head at his premature departure. It what makes this movie such a bitter-sweet experience. There are a bunch of smaller roles that are equally outstanding, none more so than Catherine Keener (who has appeared in all of Holofcener's movies). Last but not least, there is a wonderful soundtrack, mostly with indie music from artists like the Eels, Neil Halstead, Mideau and others.

This movie has been playing on 2 screens (which is highly unusual) at my local art-house here in Cincinnati for several weeks now, and yet when I went to see recently, it was still packing them in. The screening I saw this at was very well attended indeed, which is GREAT news, as this is a movie that just deserves to be seen. If you are in the mood for a top-notch indie movie that dissects relationships with an honesty and veracity not seen very often, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Enough Said"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1382054400,146,3137,4.775322283609577
6040894,5,B00FZ4KT84,"While this is still going to be a movie review, it's also one of those rare occasions where a massive amount of bias - in this case admiration, will likely overshadow anything and everything that's said about this particular film.  This is due largely to the tragic death of a man that will go down in my book (and many others) as one of the greatest actors to ever grace the big or small screen.  Of course, I'm referring to James Gandolfini - a beloved individual that was taken well before his time.  He was a man with immense talent that saw no bounds, starring in arguably the greatest television show of all-time, The Sopranos.  But, before he starred as the loveable gangster, Tony Soprano, he made his everlasting mark in films, like Get Shorty, True Romance, and The Mexican.  Since the conclusion of The Sopranos in 2007, Gandolfini took on much more reduced roles, acting in supporting roles, such as Zero Dark Thirty, Not Fade Away, and Killing Them Softly.  Thankfully, in one of his final roles, he once again takes on a starring role - in the romance film, Enough Said.

Written and directed by Nicole Holofcener (Friends with Money, Please Give), Enough Said stars Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Eva, a divorced single parent working as traveling masseuse.  One night at a party, Eva meets Marianne (Catherine Kenner), a poet with an arm issue that's in need of a masseuse.  At the same party, Eva hits it off with a divorced single parent, Albert (James Gandolfini).  Eva and Albert quickly begin dating, all while Eva is nicely bonding with her new friend and client, Marianne.  It doesn't take long for Eva to discover she is unhappy with men after a bitter divorce - and has no problem criticizing her ex-husband, either.  Matters quickly become complicated when Eva realizes Albert is the ex-husband Marianne is constantly criticizing.  Unsure of how to handle the situation, it's only a matter of time before the whole situation comes to a head.  Toni Collette, Ben Falcone, Tracey Fairaway, and Tavi Gevinson also star in supporting roles.

The fact that this is (most likely) James Gandolfini's second to last appearance on the big screen (final appearance will be in 2014's Nicky Deuce), a large shadow looms large over the whole film.  Much like Heath Ledger's appearance as The Joker in The Dark Knight, it's difficult to gage whether Gandolfini's work in the role of Albert is really as good as it appears to be.  I suppose the only way to pull that off would be to find someone that lives under a rock who doesn't know that man died in order to get their unbiased opinion.  Regardless, if James Gandolfini hadn't died, this film would be looked in an entirely different manner.  Still, the devastating circumstances shouldn't discount the performance of Gandolfini's co-star Julia Louis-Dreyfus.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus is absolutely stunning in this film and despite the cloud overhead, she gives one of the best performances of her career.  Like Gandolfini in the role of Tony Sorprano, I'll still always look at Louis-Dreyfus as Elaine from Seinfeld - yes, even though she just won an Emmy Award for her leading role on Veep.  Regardless, there's no denying her talent for acting (as if her shelf full of Emmy Awards wasn't proof enough).  She brings an awkward, yet relatable quality to her roles, allowing her to stand out as one of Hollywood's most authentic actresses.  Regardless of the character, she simply radiates - exuding charisma and splendor.  The chemistry with her co-stars, like any cast she's ever worked with, is just marvelous - in ways that words just can't describe.  A pairing of Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini may seem like a complete mismatch, yet she sells the audience on the idea that these two characters have something special.

While it's easy to see the brilliance of Julia Louis-Dreyfus, it's much harder to look at the character of Albert and not see James Gandolfini.  Albert is a character that's mostly content with his life, and even though he doesn't appear to be looking for love, he's obviously found someone he enjoys.  Gandolfini portrays a down-to-earth working man, and it's really unlike the majority of the role he's played in the past.  He's not a hitman, gangster, or some other form of tough guy.  He portrays a warm, loving individual that is defined by his past, but still attempting to look forward to the future.  For Tony Soprano fans, this role is a tough sell, but this is a different side of Gandolfini that rarely appeared on screen. Regardless, even in this role, it's more evident than ever that he was and always will be considered a dramatic genius.  This wonderful actor has a long reputation of conquering his characters - for better or worse, and even in his final appearances, he gives them that Gandolfini charm that his fans have fallen in love with and adored for so many years.

Both Gandolfini and Louis-Dreyfus shine in these roles due to the writing and directing of Nicole Holofcener.  The characters are written with such a relaxed freedom and honesty, which encourages these two individuals to be open with one another.  But - what's a romantic drama without a little bit of drama.  Sure, the story is all too familiar, but it's executed in a way that you'll have a few laughs, not to mention wonder if Holofcener is trying to send the world a message about obesity.  The impact divorce has on individuals is certainly discussed, along with the fear people have in regards to making the same old mistakes in new relationships.  Holofcener poses an interesting question over the course of this film: would you want the inside dirt on the person you're dating if it helped you avoid making a critical mistake in your life?  It's a difficult concept to wrap your head around, but if you were put in Eva's position and had access to all the bad things someone has ever done, odds are you'd walk the same line she did.

Overall, Enough Said is a talk heavy romantic comedy with two stars that initially appear to be an unlikely duo, but as they grow on you over the course of this film (and they will), it will be impossible for you not to approve of their portrayals.  This film is smartly written, well-directed, and features a cast that is nothing less than outstanding.  This isn't a role you'd expect from James Gandolfini, and it's exactly a role you'd expect from Julia Louis-Dreyfus.  And, if this were to be the last film Gandolifini ever appeared in, there would be no finer note to go out on than with this particular character.  Yes, this as a romantic comedy, so it will understandably sway towards the female audience - but even if you're a lover of everything Gandolfini and a hater of most everything romantic-based, you should still give this film your attention.  By the end, you'll be happy you did.

6040902,5,B00FZ4KT84,"A beautiful performance by James Gandolfini, who finally had an opportunity to present. a character who was actually similar to himself in so many areas.  This is a character study of what are essentially ordinary people, struggling to make a real connection but suffering from an innate fear of failure - and a whisper of self destruction. There is real value in learning to not make judgments based upon initial physical attractions - and additional value in not permitting other people to influence our choices in partners.  And even more value in truthful expression.

Although there was humor within the context of the complex situation(s), I wouldn't describe this as being a ""comedy"".  To me, it was an honest portrayal of how frighteningly easy it can be for us to destroy relationships and hurt those about whom we care deeply - simply because of our own insecurities.  And to cause damage to ourselves for those same reasons.

This is a film you can either consider as simple entertainment and then forget about - or you can look into the real heart of the story and possibly learn from it.  I recognized parts of many of the people I have known in the characters.... and, admittedly, some parts of myself, as well.",1517788800,2,1225,4.777251184834123

6040907,5,B00FZ4KT84,"Love how real this movie felt, and how much I loved the characters - who seem like an unlikely pair at first. Besides some of the moments being cringe-worthy, we also see that people (even good people, nice people, people we love) can be a little mean or critical (as evidenced by a calorie book comment in front of friends), We all have flaws, and in this movie, we got to see the endearing characteristics and the flaws too. Even the relationship between Julia Louis-Dreyfus and her daughter and Julia L-D and her daughter's friend were interesting to watch because moms sometimes make errors in judgement about how we do that too. And watching Julia repeatedly lug her massage table up a long flight of stairs while her client just stands there and watches, offering no help, is such a familiar feeling to so many of us. No, we're not all lugging massage tables, but there are plenty of times when we could use a little help, and people who are in a position to give it just stand there. Again, not horrible people, just clueless or not thinking.  Of course I found myself rooting for Julia and James G. characters to get together, but I was glad neither one of them dramatically changed their personalities to make that happen -- maybe they just learned to be more accepting of each other's differences. I will definitely watch this again.  I LOVED this movie. No special effects or bells and whistles -- just so believable to me.

6040977,3,B00FZ4KT84,"A divorced single mother meets a divorced single father at a party. They go out on a date . . . then another . . . until they are officially a couple. But it turns out that a new client for the woman's massage business is her new beau's ex-wife. When the woman finds this out she intentionally pumps the ex-wife for the dirt on her beau.

Umm. First of all this movie was made/written by such liberal people that they cannot even fathom that people don't think/live like them and would be put off by their lifestyle. Sitting around casually talking to some teenager about her having sex for the first time and ""just try it . . . "" . . . sorry . . . just irresponsible. Suggesting that the ""new thing"" to do when you are a teenager is to have ""3somes"" and talk about it while shopping with others around as if that is appropriate public discourse is just moral decay on display. The characters in the movie also seem to be the typical liberal stock--self-absorbed. Who goes out on a date with someone and pulls back from a kiss by saying . . . "" I don't know . . . I don't know if I want to . . . . I just don't know."" Why not just turn a check up and let it be that and move on either way? Why? Did I not just point out the ""me me me me"" quality of these characters? It is almost like the Seinfeld actors have been possessed by the uber spoiled brats that they played on that TV show. They were horrible people. And they channel that in almost every character since as if that is something to aspire to or highlight, or impossible to shake off. It isn't.

And what made even less sense was the central plot. Why would you want to talk/befriend your love interest's ex? Why would you be so depraved as to inquire about them having sex? Etc? And if you did for whatever morbid mental reason why would that influence your relationship with the person? Just very very very odd plot.

It could have been a cute movie about dating someone that is not ""perfect"" for people who are experiencing empty nest syndrome. It could have been a cute movie about finding someone that you are compatible with . . .t hat you like being around. . . . It had a little of that. But no . . . they had to do somersaults trying to make it a hip quirky movie only to destroy the entire thing.",1455840000,,2266,4.110609480812641

6040989,2,B00FZ4KT84,Avoid wasting your money. Julia Louis-Dreyfus disappointed. Jim Gandolfini was great. The story line was just too unbelievable for me to find the film even casually interesting. Spend your money on something else. My wife liked it though. Would have been better if the camera spent more of its time on Jim rather than Julia. What a unique idea. A chick flick with the story line focused on the male rather than the female.  Never in this century.,1453680000,,446,4.717948717948718

6040994,4,B00FZ4KT84,"It was hard to choose 4 stars for this movie.  I think of 4 stars as a great movie but on Amazon it's just okay.  And this movie, overall, is just okay. Good acting and a potentially interesting story sidetracked by a need to turn the plot into a farce.

To clear away my personal bias I do find it hard to see Julia Louis-Dreyfus and not see Elaine from Seinfeld.  So it took me a few minutes to really settle in to the movie.  And then her character was okay- just not the most interesting character ever.  The main flaw in casting her then becomes that midway through the movie they resort to a Seinfeld-like plot twist to keep the story going.  And going.  And Elaine emerged again as the movie desperately tries to keep what has now become a farce going until they felt it was time for the inevitable, sitcom-like  moment of truth that lets the film head for the credits.

So did I love this movie? No. But it was hard not to like the characters and way they explore the idea that we are all imperfect people dealing with other imperfect people.  The shame is it seemed like the writers or director didn't spend enough time figuring a way out of the situation they created.  That's a shame because Gandolfini's last movie could have been a great one if they had.

I never really watched the Sopranos so that was not an issue for me when seeing Gandolfini.  But even if I had seen his prior work I do think his performance was good enough to quickly see past his prior roles.",1451174400,,1479,4.292418772563177

6041013,4,B00FZ4KT84,"Finding myself with nothing to do on Halloween night, after a lovely afternoon at Baker Beach, I checked out this film on its final screening at the Balboa: it made for a good escape from the madding crowds.

I thoroughly enjoy Nicole Holofcener's movies, especially the relationship she has developed with Catherine Keener, who plays the hapless protagonist in her earlier films. Here she has given Julia Louis-Dreyfus that role, with excellent results. She has written a sympathetic character, who feels insecure in her own judgments, always seeking input on even the most trivial matters from women (and girls) whose judgment she values more highly than her own; we as the audience get to watch the results as they happen, which is kind of like watching a very slow velocity train wreck, and is pleasantly excruciating. The performances all around are excellent, with James Gandolfini taking the laurels, but solid support from Toni Collette and Catherine Keener, and the three young actors who play the three teenage girls.",1446249600,,1027,5.113095238095238

6041028,5,B00FZ4KT84,"I thought this was a charming, very touching movie about love, acceptance, loneliness, truth and honesty and knowing yourself and what you need and want. The two main characters played by James Gandolfini and Julia Louis-Dreyfus are both very engaging in their performances, very charming and ""real.""  It is lovely to see Julia Louis-Dreyfus not as the (beloved) Elaine, but as a completely different character. Her face is very expressive, and it carries ""age"" well; her smile can bring ""Elaine"" back in an instant and light up that face, but her face can also show great sorrow and sadness. It was a fine performance and I felt great affection for such an iconic image (""Elaine"") letting go as an aging, vulnerable woman.  James Gandolfini is completely charming and so easy to love in this film. His ""big bear"" of funny, flirtatious and warm love is just thoroughly beguiling. We want these two to be together and are happy when they are. I think this story and these two characters exemplify perfectly the saying from Ram Dass:  ""We are all just walking each other home.""  I also loved the depiction of the emotions that exist when the child leaves home to go off to college - very moving and poignant and not very often shown or told in stories as well as this story did, both from the perspective of the Gandolfini's father character and the Julia Louis-Dreyfus mother character of two different daughters going away to college.

However, I had a hard time feeling anything for Julia Louis-Dreyfus through out the whole film.  Even though she has matured physically her character in the film came across as a screwed up, malicious, insecure, and shallow person with no real sense of self.  I suppose that is what the director was aiming for; but for me it just didn't work.

6041131,1,B00FZ4KT84,"I gave this a try and I think I made it to 1:20.  It started off mediocre and became steadily a bitch fest, where you watched the ex-wife complain to her friend about her ex-husband's bad habits, then the friend, who was dating the ex-husband, get uneasy and criticize the guy for everything his ex-wife was bitching about. And while I understand minor things can grate on people after a while, they were such minor things and he was such a nice guy. I finally stopped it about the time she told the boyfriend (Gandolfini) that guacamole had too many calories and she was buying him a calorie book and started bitching about that he didn't have a bedside night table.  I skipped to the end, and clearly didn't miss anything.

I can't imagine the target audience for this movie.  It was not funny, not uplifting. It was petty to the point that you wanted to tell the two female leads to put a sock in it.  The women's bitching about the guy's minor idiosyncrasies was a far more unattractive trait than the guy's idiosyncrasies themselves.  And that was the movie.  Nothing worth seeing here.

JLD is so disarmingly neurotically charming, while dialing down her typical Elaine-esque idiosyncrasies, and JG is so far from Tony Soprano, that we truly feel we are watching two actual persons embarking on a relationship.

He was a great actor to go from the character of Tony Soprano to this lovable non-violent and totally sane man. It's in the details where he shines. It's how he looks, his voice, what his eyes convey, his body language, and much more.
To me the best actors are those who can be different characters and make you believe they are totally different people. This isn't Tony Soprano in a date movie, it's Albert in Enough Said trying to make it work with Eva. He's funny, unsure of himself, jolly and very likable.

6041201,4,B00FZ4KT84,"This is an engaging and very well-constructed movie.  The deliberate banality of much of the writing has a lot to do with the credibility of the characters, but, of course, given that kind of writing, much is required of the actors to make us interested in them as persons despite their ordinariness -- for in part it is their very ordinariness that enables us as viewers to relate to them.  The actors here are well up to the task -- James Gandolfini plays Albert, a low-key, rather easy-going man who nonetheless is capable of some depth of feeling, although he doesn't always broadcast it.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus is Eva, a hard-working massage therapist who seems more on edge about what's lacking in her life than Gandolfini's character is, and Catherine Keener is Marianne, Albert's ex-wife, with whom Eva forms a professional and then personal relationship before she realizes that Marianne has been married to Albert.  The intriguing thing for us is that Eva begins a relationship with Albert that quickly becomes serious at the same time that she is hearing Marianne talk about how unsatisfactory he was as a husband.  When Eva realizes that Marianne is talking about the man she (Eva) is developing strong feelings for, it makes her wonder about the validity of these feelings and question her own judgment.  To complicate things further, her knowledge of Marianne's attitude begins to affect the way she behaves towards Albert -- even before Albert and Marianne discover that Eva knows both of them.

To avoid spoilers, let me just say that when Albert finds out that Eva has been talking to Marianne, it complicates the relationship.  To the credit of the director, Nicole Holofcener, however, our interest isn't just in how these complications will be resolved but in what the movie shows about what love requires.  To show this is the purpose of what seems like a sub-plot but is really central to the movie's effect: the coincidence that Eva and Albert (and their divorced spouses, of course,) have daughters who are getting prepared to leave home for college.  Both Eva and Albert are full of typical parental worries about this, which, characteristically, Eva tends to verbalize much more openly than the low-key Albert.  Both love their daughters, and as we see them negotiating their anxieties in their own ways and with their ex-spouses, we realize that loving is something that one doesn't have to have reasons for.  We begin to realize that, in listening to Marianne, Eva was starting to look for reasons to love or not love Albert, not realizing that all of Marianne's ""reasons"" were after-the-fact rationalizations of what irritated her about Albert and had nothing to do with why she loved him and married him in the first place.  Eva, without quite realizing it, begins to look for reasons to love -- when her love for her daughter should be telling her that she doesn't need them (and that looking for them might be destructive).  Love sometimes fails, of course, and then one might articulate things one didn't like about one's spouse, AS IF these were the reasons for the failure.  Eva's ex-husband is a perfectly nice man whom Eva doesn't run down as Marianne ran down Albert even though the marriage didn't work out.  Both of them see their daughter off in what is perhaps the understated emotional climax of the movie, and it makes emotional sense that it is after that send-off that Eva and Albert meet again in an equally understated scene in which at least the possibility of understanding becomes open.

What's impressive about the movie, apart from the acting, is the way the scenes are disposed -- and secondary characters are disposed -- to make us understand that a kind of talking can be often the cause of a problem rather than a solution.  Marianne isn't a bad person, and she isn't aware whom she's talking to -- she's just venting, and her venting is in the form of giving reasons, and reasons are seductive, as Eva learns to her cost.  ""Enough said"" is a great title.  Problems arise when too much is said, and perhaps Eva's friends and confidants, the couple played by Toni Collette and Ben Falcone, are other examples of too much being said.  Unlike Marianne, though, they know whom they are talking to, and the result isn't pleasant.",1416960000,,4279,4.8342465753424655

This movie is another example of her talent to make you laugh and cry because you can feel for her character as she deals with new beginnings. (Her daughter going off to college, a budding romance, new friendships).  I have never seen James Gandolfini in anything before, (I know, I know, how could I have not seen the Sopranos??  Mea Culpa!) but he is the steady heart of this movie and his character is endearing, grounded and mature about relationships, both with women and children.  I was completely charmed.

Well, relaxing if you don't think about how tragic it is that James Gandolfini died before his time and we'll never see this amazing actor in another movie. :-(  But if you can not think about that fact and appreciate his awesomeness, then this movie will not disappoint.",1416182400,,368,4.53030303030303

6041212,3,B00FZ4KT84,"When I found out about this movie,I was surprised because I thought the two main actors were an unusual match. I wasn't really sure what the movie was about, but I gathered it was middle-aged adults looking for a second chance at a real relationship. Not my kinda flick, but I thought at some point I would give it a chance. So, while changing the channels, I came across it and thought I'd take the plunge. I was intending to just watch enough to get a feel for the story, but then I kept it on and decided to watch the ending. Well, it was the type of film I thought it was going to be, kinda slow, talky, about adult feelings and marital issues. Too day to day real for me. I don't watch films to see regular people's issues, I watch to be entertained, and walk away with knowledge or excitement. This film is good if you have the time to sit and get to know the characters; be interested in what they are going through; and see how it turns out for them, Like a Saturday afternoon flick.

I would give it a chance if you are fans of either actor. It's light, not heavy, has some levity, and is a nice story.
Two divorced people, who may seem like an unlikely match, meet and begin a relationship. They seem to genuinely get along despite some personal habits. It's nice to see that ""there is someone for everyone at their stage in life."" Both have daughters that  are about to go off to college, and their previous marriages didn't work out so well, so It's nice that they have that in common and find friendship.",1416009600,,1517,4.263888888888889

Freaking out about her daughter going off to college.
Divorced.
Her friends force her to go to a party.
Where she meets her new boyfriend and...his ex-wife, her new patient/bff.
There are some comedic moments.
But overall its about her stupidity.
She lets her friendship with the ex ruin her relationship.
She alienates her daughter by taking to the best friend. Whose mom gets very testy about this.
Anyways...after all this stupidity.
It ends.
She's lost her daughter, her new friend, and her boyfriend.
She gains her daughter's affections back.
We don't hear from the ex-wife again.

She has taken on the role of middle-aged single mom admirably.. I must admit, I watched the movie twice within 24 hours.  ""Enough Said"" turned out to be a movie about perceptions of what is important in people, and what is not, and how we somehow allow outside influences to blind us to the the true value of what is right in front of us.",1409702400,,620,4.299145299145299

It was kind of sad to see James Gandolfinis last performance, but it was a really good movie. ****SPOILER ALERT**** This movie made me cringe almost the entire time because of the things that Julia Louis-Dreyfus would say and do. I feel that the reason the title is Enough Said is because it JLD said too much.

However, I think when a movie can make you feel bad for the characters in that way its because the acting is so strong. The chemistry between the JLD and JG was cute and I highly recommend this film.",1408924800,,545,4.3431372549019605

6041327,5,B00FZ4KT84,"A sweet, funny, grown up love-dating-and-friendship story.  It is hard to identify everything that makes this such an enjoyable movie.  One has to be the totally relatable human experience of being tempted to know the personal history of someone, especially a person we're intimate with, when it isn't our business.  Or of accidentally seeing or learning something that is private, and not looking away as quickly as we should.  Or of feeling shame when we don't make our best decision, or don't make it quickly enough, and are found out, or hurt the people we care most about.  And that old grade-school feeling of our world falling apart, and knowing things won't get better.  And then you get a second chance.  All of this in a film with a meltingly wonderful last film performance by James Gandolfini, who puts a spring in the step, and smile on the face, of a middle-aged girl, and reminds her that she can fall in love again.",1405296000,,931,4.674846625766871

I think both actors did a superb job and I will definitely watch this again and will recommend it to my friends!,1403481600,,411,3.847058823529412
6041353,5,B00FZ4KT84,"This film is about inappropriate relationships, and the damage that those relationships cause.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus has quite a few of these herself:  the wife of her current boyfriend, the friend of her daughter, her ex-husband, etc.  Let's face it:  the friend of my enemy is my enemy, whether people like it or not.  And the friend of my frenemy is, well, probably a frenemy.

I knew this woman once who maintained relationships with all of her ex-husbands (yes, there were way more than one; you could barely count them on one hand) and it was pretty obvious that her latest husband didn't much like it.  He didn't say it, but you could see it.  Anyways, she kept those relationships going not because they were necessarily healthy, but rather to keep her husband on a short leash.  She wanted him to know that he could be replaced, and more than likely, he would be someday; let history be his guide.  But I always had the feeling that she was hedging her bets, just in case the latest became not-the-greatest.

And this movie is more than hinting at these types of relationships.  Sometimes, you need to drop a relationship with someone because it does damage to a third party, and ultimately, yourself.  You can always try to argue that those relationships are harmless, but you know that they aren't.  In a perfect world, people wouldn't have jealousies and insecurities, but we don't live in a perfect world.

But Ms. Dreyfus surprisingly almost gives a perfect performance herself.  At first, yes, I thought about her character Elaine on ""Seinfeld.""  Who doesn't?  But after awhile, you will realize that it's quite unfortunate that she's become somewhat type-cast, and has probably not gotten roles because of it.  She is certainly more talented than I thought, before watching her spot-on performance in ""Enough Said.""

And James Gandolfini puts on quite a show himself, showing range from his ""Sopranos"" days.  He was a tough guy there, while he is a softy here, in more ways that one.  But when you have a film that seats Catherine Keener and Toni Collette at second and third fiddle, you know that the ensemble should be music to your ears.  And it is.

I'll go with a big recommendation on a film that I believe would pair nicely with ""Sideways"" on a double bill.  And I'll recommend to Hollywood to give Ms. Dreyfus more roles.",1403395200,,2344,4.742574257425742

6041355,3,B00FZ4KT84,"Fine performances by a fine cast, with the exception of JLoDre, the star of the movie. Got too much of Elaine in there. I found that exceedingly distracting. I don't blame Dre for that. I lay this at the doorstep of the writer-director of this film, Nicole Holofcener. It was her idea or she allowed it. Either way, it was her doing.

I like Holofcener's films very much (Lovely and Amazing and Friends with Money are Holofcener's best films, with Walking and Talking as first runner up). And this is only her first major screw-up. Nobody's perfect; but, gosh darn, I kept feeling like I was watching Seinfeld.",1403049600,,610,4.648148148148148

6041357,2,B00FZ4KT84,"This movie starts out looking strong. We are introduced to Eva, a beautiful woman, who has her own business and a daughter about to leave for college.  Eva attends a party and is introduced to two new people... one, a woman looks to be a new client and friend and the other... perhaps a new boyfriend. Eva gets to like the new guy, Albert, even as she listens to her new female friend and client complain about her ex husband. Guess who that turns out to be? Eventually Eva is forced to try to keep her like for Albert in the face of listening to his ex-wife complain about him all the time.

The problem with this movie for me is Albert and Gandolfini. Just like in the ""Holiday"" I am sick of Hollywood hooking up great looking women with HORRIBLY out of shape guys - like they are trying to train women not to want better in real life.  Also note that Catherine Keener is supposed to have been his ex. Gandolfini looks very bad here. Overweight and not attractive. Compare John Candy in ""only the lonely"" for a ""non-traditional"" larger guy who makes you believe someone would be attracted to him. Albert's character turns out to be very boring and does most of what his ex is complaining about. I can't see any reason for Eva to be with him other than total desperation.  When Albert finds out that Eva knew his ex and said nothing he is up on the high horse like Eva cheated on him or something.  Really doesn't rise to the level of a deep betrayal.  And I am not sure I get it as Eva seemed to want to stay with Albert even hearing bad things about him all the time. It isn't like she broke up with Albert after hearing from his ex.

Some have said that Eva was supposed to be unlikable but I didn't get it. The movie tries to portray her as that but almost everything she gets taken to task for in the movie seems unfair. She gets in trouble for being friendly with her daughter's friend... she was just trying to be nice and understandably looking to blunt the loss of her daughter going to college. Really? Is that so bad?

Overall though, I don't enjoy spending 2 hours with uninteresting people so I will probably never watch this again. Enough said, indeed.",1402790400,2,2167,4.320197044334975
6041358,5,B00FZ4KT84,"Enough Said was a sweet and charming little movie full of believable characters played to perfection by two great actors. I thought Gandolfini's understated and quiet turn was a nice change of pace, and Louis-Dreyfus' conflicted, flawed, and blundering role was brilliant done. She has a face that portrays so much and she uses this gift to convey the uncertainty, remorse, and emotional ups and downs of Eva, the masseuse who plays the love interest to Gandolfini's Albert. Both actors handle this dialogue-driven, bittersweet dramedy with nuance and precision. Emotions are subdued and genuine, the word ""love"" is never mentioned, and the audience is treated with maturity and respect.

There aren't enough smart adult takes on relationships and their fragile nature, especially for those of us who have been through the horror of divorce and its endless ripples. It was refreshing to have two well-written characters negotiating the obstacles of post-divorce romance, wherein friends, children, career, and the lives we have built in the aftermath create a wall around our scarred hearts to buffer against further damage. Love, passion, and obsessive behaviors are best left to the young, and it's downright silly when older actors are made to act like lovesick fools. At one point, Albert calmly apologizes to Eva for admitting that his heart was broken, adding ""I'm getting too old for this..."" It's a perfect scene that sums up romance in the middle years. One of the most rewarding things about living long enough is coming to the realization that you've outgrown certain pursuits. There's a reason Romeo and Juliet were mere teens.

This movie is intelligent and, save the unnecessary and clichd introspection with melancholy song interlude near the end, refrains from the predictable rom-com traps. Eva and Albert behave like middle-aged adults instead of cornball Hollywood stereotypes. Instead of trying to sell massive numbers of tickets and appeal to a broad audience, the folks behind Enough Said kept their integrity and made a beautiful little story I felt deeply. I can't say that I recommend it to everyone, because some of you might be put off by the slow moving story and perhaps even by the mistakes some characters make. But, if you find flaws or blemishes to be endearing at times, you might just like what you see in Enough Said.",1402531200,,2353,5.0932642487046635

6041361,1,B00FZ4KT84,"I usually like the actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, but I found her character too unlikeable in this so-called ""comedy"". While the actress was both offensive and obnoxious in her role, James Gandofini [sp?] was likable. I never watched the Sopranos, so I had no images of him in a serious role to interfere with his loveable character in this film.",1402444800,2,344,4.8474576271186445

6041365,2,B00FZ4KT84,"I like all of the actors and actresses especially Catherine Kenner; however I did not like them in this movie. They could not save this depressing movie about loneliness and boredom. This is an interesting movie about damaged relationships with a few laughs but it's not a good movie. The character played by Julia Dreyfus (Eva) elicits pity and sympathy and Catherine Keener's character is Eva's newly formed best friend (Marianne). They awkwardly share many friendly moments until Julia's character (Eva) discovers that she is dating her new best friend's ex-husband Albert (Gandolfini). Albert is morbidly obese, oafish, stubborn, and dull which left me wondering why Eva was so interested in him. The make-out and sex scenes with Julia Dreyfus and James Gandolfini are awkward and uncomfortable to watch. The dating scenes between them are also awkward and annoying: Albert teases Eva passive aggressively during dates; however, later in the film Albert is hyper-sensitive to any teasing or feedback which later breaks up the relationship. Eva's other friends are equally self-absorbed, bitter, and immature. A few times they even gang up against Eva to spoil her occasional happy and thoughtful moods. Every character is lonely, lost, bored, self absorbed, and slightly narcissistic and each of the characters go through small hardships and growing pains throughout the movie. At the end of the movie they have each other which left me feeling that very little had been resolved between the characters. Eva develops an odd fixation with Albert and attempts several times to rekindle the romance. She seemed like a very lonely woman who had to settle for less which left me feeling sad for her. I felt that Eva deserved better friends and a much better romantic partner.",1401926400,6,1774,5.163194444444445

My husband and some other friends enjoyed it as well, because it isn't your typical 20-something romantic comedy.  The main characters are mature, believable, and real people.

6041480,4,B00FZ4KT84,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

If you had told me a year ago that one of James Gandolfini's final roles would have been in a romantic comedy, I probably wouldn't have believed you. After all, this was Tony Soprano. But sure enough, here we are a year later, and Gandolfini has done exactly that. Unfortunately, as a whole, Enough Said fails to impress, and it fails to elicit any strong emotions about either of its lead characters. In my opinion, the critical acclaim has less to do with the quality of the film, and more to do with the fact that it includes the late James Gandolfini. This is not to say that the film is terrible, but it is excruciatingly predictable, which is a huge negative for me.

Meet Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a divorced mother with a daughter who is about to start college. After attending a party with some friends, Eva meets Marianne (Catherine Keener), a famous poet, and Albert (Gandolfini). Both share some strong negative opinions about their ex-partners, and both decide to start a relationship with Eva. Because Eva is a masseuse, she begins giving massages to Marianne, and at the same time starts dating Albert. There is clearly a strong connection with both of them--one romantic, the other friendly--but all of that is about to change when Eva learns a not-so-surprising piece of information.

As previously stated, Enough Said's biggest failure isn't in its story, but in its predictability. I despise films that allow me to predict the outcome within the first 15-20 minutes because it no longer becomes an escape. At that point, it becomes a routine, something I have done over-and-over again, and it is no longer fun for me. It is obvious to everyone but Eva what is going on, and she takes an embarrassingly long time to figure it out herself. Her density is disturbing, and it becomes hard to root for her once you realize just how detached she is from her surroundings.

One of the film's greatest accomplishments, however, comes from the dialogue and how the characters interact with one another. The conversations that are had throughout the film are very rich and relatable, and the same can be said about some of the situations these characters find themselves in. The awkward first date, the daughter's friend who would rather be at your house than her own, a friend of yours who never stops rearranging her house. The characters and their peers feel very real, which allows you to really connect with them despite knowing how their story will end.

Furthermore, Enough Said is just extremely fun to watch. It is very laid back, and it never takes itself too seriously even though it touches on a lot of relatable topics. There is the constant sense of lightheartedness that makes it extremely difficult to hate even when I found it frustratingly simple. Gandolfini and Keener are brilliant in their roles, and it was nice to watch James give a performance that felt more grounded and accessible. What surprised me the most, however, was the emotion he was able to portray during the film's final act when the foundation of Eva's life completely collapsed. It was a surprising performance from an actor who had one final trick up his sleeve.

Unfortunately, aside from the predictability, the thing that really kept Enough Said cemented in ""okay"" territory was the lack of chemistry between Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini. The awkwardness was cute for the first date because that weird tension is always going to be there, but it soon became clear that they were just awkward together. They didn't really compliment each other in any way, and even though Louis-Dreyfus didn't give a terrible performance, I almost hated seeing her on screen with Gandolfini. Everyone looks at certain couples and thinks ""They don't go together,"" and this was one of those couples for me.

Overall Score: 7.2/10 - I was really excited to see this going in, and I was unaware that it received such high praise until after I watched it, but Enough Said fails to create something substantial. The extreme predictability and the lack of chemistry between the two leads stop this film from being a great romantic comedy, but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad one. There are some genuinely sweet moments, the characters feel authentic and real, and Gandolfini gave a surprisingly deep performance. These reasons alone should be enough to warrant a viewing. Just don't go in expecting to be moved by what you see.",1397520000,,4463,4.864473684210527

As for Julia Lous-Dreyfus, I absolutely love her and she was wonderful in this portrayal of a single mom who falls in love with someone she didn't think she was interested in.

For instance people in general will watch a news program about a killing or a tragedy, and virtually ignore what is going on in the rest of the world, that might ""affect"" their own lives.

So this movie exaggerates this trait of superficiality that exists in all of us, and in this case focuses on the woman's side, I thought it was well done and great acting by the late James Gandolfini.

6041516,3,B00FZ4KT84,I was a bit disappointed.  Thought with the subject matter and the stars in it the movie would be more riveting.  Julia's character was such a dippy woman and to watch them in bed was just kind of gross.,1396396800,3,203,4.17948717948718

6041518,4,B00FZ4KT84,"Very sweet movie. If old people making out and having sex creeps you out, don't watch it, but a great movie about the challenges single parents face from dating to the difficulty of making  and keeping friends to empty nesting.",1396396800,,227,4.675
6041519,4,B00FZ4KT84,I give this four stars because the actors are good in anything they do. The story was cute and intelligently portrayed the dynamics of these regular everyday people and their struggle to find healthy companionship.,1396224000,,214,5.142857142857143
6041520,4,B00FZ4KT84,"The title says it all! Both great actors in my opinion. Julia brings her typical style of humor to the role, while James Gandolfini once again shows he can play any character. The movie doesn't really twist and turn and leave you guessing, nor does it plod on in an obvious direction. Its a good story that weaves itself together until in the end you say ""That's nice"" . I think you'll like it.",1396224000,,394,4.337837837837838
6041521,5,B00FZ4KT84,the movie was heartfelt and funny. I immediately was drawn into the characters lives.  The  movie was well acted by all. I was happy to see it.,1396224000,,143,4.2592592592592595
6041522,1,B00FZ4KT84,"Okay, I'm a movie lover and will watch (and enjoy) almost anything.  But this movie was painful.  It was not funny.  It was not romantic.  It was not interesting.  If you like watching people be disfunctional and bitch about their relationships, then maybe you'd enjoy it.  Or if you're an idiot about relationships and you want to watch some painful but obvious stuff about what NOT to do, and you like torture, then watch it.

Some people might say that it's a movie for a niche audience, and it's a ""realistic"" relationship movie instead of a fairy tale.  Yeah, it probably targets divorced people who have found (or are trying to find) love for the second time.  But that's me.  I'm divorced.  I spent years dating after my divorce.  It wasn't always easy.  People have baggage.  I finally remarried.  But even after going through all that, did I think that this movie spoke to me and was relevant or insightful to my experiences?  No.  It was just bad.  I can't figure out how anyone gave this a good review.",1396137600,5,1013,4.564245810055866

6041525,4,B00FZ4KT84,James Gandolfini an Julia Dreyfus are a great pair in this romantic comedy /drama ...moral...listen to your own heart / mind when it comes to a relationship because in reality you are the only one who really knows your partner.,1396137600,,227,4.7
6041526,4,B00FZ4KT84,The movie did not download on my ipad.  I have downloaded several other movies without a problem.  I had previously  seen 1/2 the movie and thought it was cute.,1396137600,,160,4.448275862068965
6041527,4,B00FZ4KT84,Good movie though definitely a chick flick. It was one of Gandolfini's better films as it showed his softer side. Oscar material ?  No.,1396137600,,135,4.625

6041529,5,B00FZ4KT84,"I liked this film very much the first time I saw it, and like it more with each viewing.  I am a huge James Gandolfini fan, so this film was bittersweet for me.  He gives a wonderful performance as the divorced Albert, who wants to give love a second chance.  Julia Louis-Dreyfuss gives a wonderful performance as the woman falling in love, but swayed by Albert's ex-wife's grievances at his annoying habits.  The film says a lot about past marriages, past spouses, new hopes, new disappointments, new beginnings.",1396051200,,513,4.795454545454546

6041532,1,B00FZ4KT84,"I was a fan of Julia Louis Dreyfus and prepared to enjoy this movie heartily; but the longer I watched, the uglier her character (in the movie) was revealed to be, a shallow, dim-witted, self-pitying, brazenly lying piece of work who likely wouldn't know how to spell the words ""love"" or ""friendship"" and certainly doesn't understand them. Left a foul taste in my mouth. Will take a lot of Seinfeld re-runs to recover from this one.
All the other characters exhibited a shocking amount of tolerance, or at least the dignity to disentangle themselves quietly from this person quietly.",1395964800,2,583,4.898989898989899

6041538,5,B00FZ4KT84,"I really enjoyed this movie, but with a bit of sadness since it is the last movie that James Gandolfini will ever make.  He was a wonderful actor and was made for this part.  There was a degree of ""been there, done that"" about the film, that made it very real.  I think we can all remember a faux pas or two that changed a relationship...perhaps not as drastically as did the major goof in this story,but still, there was a naturalness about it that appealed.  It was also good so see a blooming romance between two people who were not in the first flush of youth.",1395878400,,564,4.242990654205608

And there really wasn't a believable romantic chemistry between James and Juilia.  And JG, as much as we loved him, was too un-sexy to be her lover.  He was way overweight and kind of wheezing.

Never seen The Sopranos (I know, blasphemy) - but in this movie, I was so moved by his subtle, heartbreaking performance. I actually watched it twice. The second time just fast forwarding to all his scenes. The script and dialogue were smart and funny. The characters were realistically portrayed, flaws and all. Julia Louis-Dreyfuss' performance reminded me of Elaine but she was a joy to watch nevertheless. She must have a thousand expressions, so many that I can believe that at least one actress in Hollywood has stayed away from Botox.

James Gandolfini and Julia Louis-Dreyfus have such great chemistry and are so convincing in their character.  This was one of James Gandolfini's last films that he made and it was so different because he didn't play a guy from the ""mob.""  Goes to show his range of acting.  I'm sure going to miss him.

This movie delivered delightful moments.  The ease of inter-action between the two main characters - hard to capture that level of quiet acting - plus the ever-entwining plot allowed me to become ever more concerned with the resolution.

I would have given it a 5 star - but those I reserve for films such as Love Actually, Life as a House, or Meet Joe Black...

6041600,5,B00FZ4KT84,"Writer and director, Nicole Holofcener, brings us a comfortably sweet and curious story with just enough quirkiness and a couple of real sharp lefts to keep us very interested in these characters.  Just when the waters are nice and smooth, something comes along and rocks the boat again.  This is one of those types of movies that I love when I take some time to stop and smell the roses, and they are generously provided here. The cast is superlative and I couldn't even ask for better.  I have been waiting to see ""Enough Said"", especially because it stars James Gandolfini, and he is all personality here as Albert to Julia Louis-Dreyfus', Eva. He adds such a terrific ease and uncomplicated charm to his portrayal and has us longing for the people that demonstrate this in our own lives.  Hence the 'comfortably sweet' account.  He makes this look like this is how he lived his life every day, not just acting in a film.  The 'curious' description is all wrapped-up in the way the story looks at forgiveness. A task we are challenged by all of the time.

Best friend, Sarah (Toni Collette), wishes that Eva would accompany her and husband, Will (Ben Falcone), to a party so Eva agrees, reluctantly.  She just cannot find or meet a man that is interesting enough to share a meal, let alone a real engaging conversation with.  Even friends or people with something to say are becoming sparse.  This is making Eva not want to put herself out there much anymore. Being a masseuse, she is able to meet people and has her regular clients, although this is work related and not social.  For Eva now, it all feels like a dying art form to meet a reasonably informed person and share a conversation as she sinks further into the doldrums.

On this night, though, fortune smiles brightly on her, and she meets an interesting woman, Marianne (Catherine Keener), who works as a poet and wants to hire her for regular massage therapy. She then meets a man, Albert (James Gandolfini), who intrigues her so much with his vague interest, or is he kind of shy?  Maybe a bit reserved?  She has just told Will that she cannot find anyone at the party that is anywhere near attractive, then here is Albert.  Albert professes the same thing back to Eva as they start a friendly banter.  Their chemistry is quite easy to see right from the start.  They each have a daughter on the verge of heading off to college and neither are ready to see them go.  Albert says of his daughter's (Tess) relationship towards him as, ""It's all I have"".  Eva laughs agreeably about her daughter (Ellen), although truthfully these two are in the same boat.  Neither one of them wants their daughters to go away and be away from them.  They also make some plans to see each other again.  I would be safe in saying that they each found someone attractive at the party, after all.

Marianne calls Eva quickly for a massage, and they begin their work together.  They also strike up quite a chatty friendship and talk all about their lives, daughters, and ex-husbands openly.  Just about everything is on the table for discussion as their relationship only grows with time.  Of Marianne's home, Eva thinks it is so lovely and beautifully decorated that she asks, ""Can I live here?"".  Marianne lives among the finer things, likes the details in her life now, and gives the appearance of being just a little above it all when talking about her horrible ex-husband.  She is very detailed with all of the negative things about him and how much he really was wrong for her.  Eva listens intently to her new and informative client, sharing her own experiences and finally cultivating a friendship that is great to be involved in for a change of pace.

Eva and Albert do go out for that dinner right away, and we can see those sparks flying as they exchange barbs in a most comical manner. They have this wonderful fly on the wall showmanship; there is a lot of laughter at this dinner table.  They each have a sense of humor that makes for a great pairing and it is easy to see that these two have a lot of fun.  Eva and Albert do some off-the-wall things together, they get downright silly, like looking at each other's teeth and other things that people do when they are so at ease together.  The two have so much in common and are excited to learn about one another.  I really enjoy movies that allow the couple to be more free and uninhibited, like this exceptionally lovely movie.  So much of a relationship can be in the things that go overlooked which indeed shouldn't be and these two relish them.

The movie does take a couple of really sharp lefts, some large twists, some turns, which is going to begin happening. Are the two of them learning more about each other? Some of these situations have already begun and the movie is probably around 30 minutes in.  I couldn't go on with this description as I would spoil this for anyone considering this surprisingly endearing film. I loved this character driven and dialog based story.  Eva and Albert have a sincere and quirky chemistry together, and I absolutely enjoyed seeing them as a couple; hopefully, this will be what shines for you also. I also can't mention enough about the supporting cast, Toni Collette, and Catherine Keener, in particular. For those who are sentimental such as I, watch through the end credits for the very short dedication - it just may bring a tear to your eye and further consideration of the movie will bring smiles for you. This is one of the better movies that I have viewed as of late and still continues to be a favorite relationship film of mine ...",1394755200,4,5599,4.5675675675675675

Two, to see Julia Louis-Dreyfus in a more serious, romantic role.  She was pretty good. I found myself struggling with...was she bad at acting in this romantic lead role or was she really good at it.  I decided she was really good at it because instead of her acting like the usual romantic leads you see where it doesn't seem realistic, she did a really good job at portraying someone in real life, if that makes any sense.  James Gandolfini is magnificent and it's still heartbreaking that his life was cut so short.  So talented and in this movie, you get to see a totally different side of him.  He's sensitive, he's a dad, and he gets his heart broken.

The woman flatters her, is impressed that she's a masseuse, takes her business card and life proceeds from there.  Later, Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini meet again, this time with a more favorable outcome and more in common than first thought.  Long story short. the poet, whom L-D has been massaging, is Gandolfini's ex.  We and L-D are not aware of this for some time, but when L-D becomes aware, she tells neither Gandolfini nor the ex.  What happens next is a series of convoluted twists and turns, mildly amusing in spots, terribly embarrassing in spots, hurtful in others, but worthy of our attention.",1394150400,,759,4.8

The female character works in a service job, and this story makes her guilty of betraying some emotional trust in two people who should be grateful that she will be their friend.  I believe it is okay for her to be friends with two individuals who are divorced from one another, but the point seems to be that neither one of them as forgiven or forgotten hurt feelings, so the masseuse has to pay for that.  She deserves a much bigger tip, like love instead of grunting because needs have to be met.  Move on, lady!  Her new best friend and her new lover were once married, so they reject her.

It wasn't, however, and I was surprised to see real emotions displayed throughout the movie.  It is a story about two middle-aged divorced people finding each other.  What makes it come alive are the wonderful performances by the two lead actors, James Gandolfini and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.  Just watching these fine actors portray these two characters draws you into the story more and more.  Gandolfini is a master of using just his face to convey such real emotions - that is evident throughout this movie.",1394064000,,591,4.88

6041672,2,B00FZ4KT84,"This movie seemed to have a lot going for it: it stars James Gandolfini and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, two expert edgy comic actors; and it has an engaging premise in which a youngish middle-aged divorced masseuse falls for a conventionally unattractive (but nonetheless charming) man, who, it turns out, is the ex-husband of her client and newfound pal. Hilarity is supposed to ensue as the characters edge their way toward each other, their affair blows up, and then they somehow sort things out. It has the makings of a romantic farce of the sort Hollywood hasn't done well since the 1930s. Apparently Hollywood still doesn't do it well: despite the classic arc the writers had to work with, the script sucks and the direction is lackluster. Gandolfini has nothing to do except crack a few jokes. Louis-Dreyfus falls back on playing her Seinfeld character Elaine, which is great schtick except (a) she's aged out of the role, and (b) the whole point of Seinfeld was that the characters were too self-absorbed to be lovable, or even likable; Elaine is just not a credible protagonist in a rom-com. And don't even mention Marianne (Katherine Keener), the ex-wife/new BFF, a fatuous carping writer of lite poetry: anyone involved with her would have to have rocks in their head. This isn't Bringing Up Baby, or even When Harry Met Sally; it's a trainwreck, but more boring.

It's a well-told tale of how we can sabotage relationships if we're determined to look for the worst in people (and not just in the romance department).  It has some laughs (usually in the form of groaning at the mistakes of Julia Louis-Dreyfus's character) and the performances are downright charming.

I wish the writing was a little more dramatic, it lulled a bit in the middle but it does make one want to see where the characters end up, or in this case, sort of end up.  If we can do something about the problems with society's drug over doses, we would have such a better life with longer lives.

In this film, even though the acting is great, the script is fine, the story is okay... it's not a particularly fun movie to watch and by the end of the movie, you don't really care what happens.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays a divorced and single mom who spends a lot of her time fretting. James Gandolfini does the same. They meet, etc., etc., Midway through the story you can guess how it will end, but still, the acting is pleasant and it's not horrible to sit through.

Dreyfuss is allowed to prove what an intelligent, sensitive, talented actor she is, not only a brilliant comedienne.  Gandolfini's performance brought sad regrets that because of his passing, he won't be able to play more roles that show us his range and great artistry.  In the past, he's been this tough, intimidating bruiser.  What makes his work in this film so promising about his potential was not just that he was tender and funny.  I studied him even when he was not talking, and you can see  intelligence and grasp of humanity in ways that tell me he could play a surprising range of roles - great historial figures, Shakespeare, political stories about men of power, - but also surprising roles with humility, humble people without great power, but struggling with inner demons, introverted characters without power.  We'll never get to see what a true actor he was.  Not a johnny-one-note character that actors sometimes get stuck with in their careers.

I will say first that with both me and my wife watching this movie our rating of this movie differs a bit, with me a bit lower on my opinion and her a bit higher in her rating of it.  With that being said, it is definitely a chic-flick type of movie but even so it does have its moments that I thought were ok.

James Gandolfini's performance does a good job in playing his role here in completely the opposite of what I have seen him play and he plays the affiable character very well.

To me the biggest knocks on the film is that it moves along very slowly which almost lost me but there are some sprinkles of humor that kept me watching. Secondly, the storyline is very predictable with its oncoming train wreck that everyone can see coming except for Dreyfus' character.  I am ok with that being the point, but it took way too much time to get there and it seemed at least to me (not my wife) that there was too much of the awkwardness between the characters.  Maybe it was meant to be that way, but again too much at least for me.

The conclusion of the movie has your typical sweet rom-com type of ending with no big surprises and overall between the two of us was an ok movie.",1393545600,3,1401,4.284090909090909

6041719,3,B00FZ4KT84,"Enough Said was not a cinematic masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini were great together. Good if you're looking for something light to watch.",1393459200,,197,5.387096774193548
6041720,3,B00FZ4KT84,Was a sweet movie but at times too slow. It did show the mundaneness of everyday living and the loneliness we feel and being able to be yourself and connect to others,1393459200,,166,4.21875
6041721,5,B00FZ4KT84,"I loved this movie.  It dealt with interesting issues:  children growing up and leaving home; middle-age romance
and coping with finding a balance for it all.  Good performances: Julia Louis-Dreyfus was charming and warm
but wary of a new relationship and James Gandolfini  hit just the right note as the divorced dad used to being
verbally abused by his ex-wife played by the always dependable Catherine Keener.  It was a joy to watch.",1393459200,,436,4.917808219178082

6041724,4,B00FZ4KT84,"A romantic comedy that actually exists between two realistic people, living the kind of lives that people anywhere can relate to.  Has plenty of truth about the bitterness of divorce, the balancing act of being a single parent, and just how much easier love can be - if we could just get out of our own way.

Great performances all around - but man, did I realize by the end how much I'm going to miss Mr. James Gandolfini.",1393459200,,423,4.341772151898734

6041734,4,B00FZ4KT84,"The humor was sort of light and sarcastic the kind you might have in your own everyday relationship.  Julia fell in love with someone she normally wouldn't look twice at.  Which also gave the movie a real feel.
 I fell in love with James Gandolfini in this movie, and could she why she did.
Julia, really pulled me in and made me feel as though I was part of her journey through their relationship.

6041738,1,B00FZ4KT84,"The script of this movie conveys nothing of what human beings might feel towards each other. Cliches pile on top of sophomoric language. These actors, one of whom (Gandolfini) has talent, couldn't fix this flick if they wanted to. Louis-Dreyful is in her element: immature acting to serve up immature language.

This movie could have been more disappointing.",1393200000,4,358,5.172413793103448

6041742,4,B00FZ4KT84,It was a nice movie with great chemistry between Dreyfus and Gandolfini.  Not overly funny but there were times that you get a good laugh. Couldn't believe Gandolfini could play such a good guy after his Soprano character.,1393200000,,222,4.842105263157895

6041751,5,B00FZ4KT84,"This rather quiet dramedy may be too close to reality for the young and action crowd that most films today pander to, but for
the older, more mature viewers who like the Independent Art House films, this is a winner.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James
Gandolfini (who of course died right after making this movie) give bravura performances.  It is simply an amusing story of how
one person's discard can be another person's treasure in love.  The script is so natural, that it hardly seems to be a movie, but rather real life.  It pains me that this wonderful film and ""The Butler"" failed to be best picture nominees, as I enjoyed them far
more than ""Gravity"", ""Captain Phillips"", ""American Hustle"", ""Dallas Buyer's Club"", and even ""Nebraska"" (which was excellent
too).  A funny and warm, very realistic film about real life.",1393027200,,821,4.835714285714285

6041754,5,B00FZ4KT84,"Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini are a wonderful pair of actors and they make a wonderful pairing in this bittersweet film. They play two divorcees who meet for the first time just as their teenage daughters are about to leave home to go off to college.

In exploring the various relationships, this film asks if it possible to adapt to other people's faults as we get older and grow less tolerant. And can we overcome our fears born of experience? This is a universal story. It may be slight but the wry, empathetic telling of it rings true. Very warmly recommended.",1393027200,,575,4.693069306930693

Although the main characters had good chemistry, whether it was the script or editing, I just didn't like this film. Watching a RomCom, I expect some escapism, some laughter perhaps some tears; a general over all a good feeling. Watching this film, I just felt depressed during most of the show...slow pace, boring and Julia's character just wasn't really very likeable. I'm afraid I missing the sweet feel-good RomComs like When Harry Met Sally, Notting Hill, While You Were Sleeping, Return to Me, You've Got Mail or Wimbeldon.",1392768000,,656,4.972727272727273

6041780,3,B00FZ4KT84,"I think if you have experienced divorce, this movie will probably resonate, and feel like it ""gets it.""  Having never experienced divorce, I will say that it was amusing and in parts quite funny.

Some subplots felt like very-empty filler, and did nothing for the story.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus' daughter seemed very distant, and there was no chemistry.  The movie would have been just as good without her.  Also, the subplot with the daughter's clingy friend was weird, and seemed forced.

Movie shows several different couples at very different stages of their relationships.  Main characters are middle-aged comfortable divorcees, with shared custody of their respective kids, and a little hesitant to start over on a relationship.  One sub-plot involves married friends whose relationship is unhealthy, and spiraling towards divorce.  Another involves a borderline toxic friend who endlessly bad-mouths her ex-husband.",1392681600,,919,5.553956834532374

6041814,4,B00FZ4KT84,"First, an important note: Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a movie release (theaters, Amazon Instant, DVD and Bluray) together so there are already over 300 reviews here as I post this. Since the formats can be different, I always suggest that buyers sort reviews by  Newest First and then note which format the reviewer is discussing. With that said, this is my review of the Bluray release.

I won't spend much time on the film itself as there are already lots of opinions. The film was released by 20th Century Fox but under their Fox Searchlight umbrella so you know this is character driven and it is. Of course, its getting most exposure as being James Gandolfinis last film and the actor plays a sympathetic character role. Honestly, I felt this was more of a Womens film  Most of the characters are female. But I liked it because some (not all) of the dialogue  especially as spoken by Gandolfinis character  was real.

The DVD contains five short Promotional Featurettes  each lasting for about 3-minutes (total 15 minutes) with comments from cast and crew and a lot of (repeating) scenes from the film. The BD adds one Exclusive  Called Second Takes, it is really the gag reel or Blooper reel and lasts but six minutes.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6041815,1,B00FZ4KT84,"The movie had no substance, no sense of direction and zero chemistry between Gandolfini and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.  How Julia Louis-Drefus won the part of Eva remains a mystery.  She's good in TV and in no way a film actress that can hold her own with the great Gandolfini.  Gandolfini, as much as I loved him as an actor, is swollen, bloated, and huge in the film.  For this actor to be only 51 years old is shocking and his appetite for food and drink reveals he was an addict of a different kind than the type of addiction that took the life of another great actor, Philip Seymour Hoffman.

Just a seriously disappointing boring film.",1392336000,2,635,4.48695652173913

6041820,5,B00FZ4KT84,I thought the movie was refreshing showed romance not linked to unreal people. Both characters were all too human facing what parents face as children good to college.,1392249600,,167,5.0

6041822,5,B00FZ4KT84,"One of the last films shot before James Gandolfini's unfortunate death, ""Enough Said"" is the romantic-comedy of the year. It has already been nominated for a Golden Globe, Independent Spirit Award, and Screen Actors Guild Award. Despite the attention it's getting, most people still haven't seen it. I recommend you change that very soon, I promise you won't regret it.

The new movie follows the slow-building and quirky love-story of Albert and Eva, two divorced single-parents looking for a companion. With each of their daughters going off to college, their romance quickly blossoms. With plenty of sweet and touching moments, Gandolfini and Dreyfus have undeniable chemistry on screen. Each scene is as enjoyable as the next, and I couldn't get enough of this heartwarming story.

With outstanding cinematography, and a cast full of great actors, this is a gem of the holiday season. Rated R for language and sexual content, ""Enough Said"" is a must-see.",1392249600,,958,5.174193548387096

6041833,5,B00FZ4KT84,I loved this movie!  It felt like a real look at adult relationships and how challenging it is for people to trust themselves and not worry about other's judgements.  I never would have thought James Gandolfini would be so good as the male lead in a romantic comedy but both he and Louis-Dreyfus were very believable characters.,1392163200,,328,4.7368421052631575
6041834,4,B00FZ4KT84,This was the perfect vehicle for Julia Louis-Dreyfus to showcase her comedic talents.  I've always found that her knack for subtle almost awkward moments of humor played better on the small screen because it's hard to build an entire movie around those kind of situations.  This movie is saved by the fact that Gandlofini's comedic performance matches Dreyfus in smooth give take of jokes that mask earnest conversations and seem completely natural between the two.  The best thing about this movie is that it doesn't try to do much and comes in at a running time of about 90 minutes which is good because about this time the cringe worthy & awkward comedy style of Dreyfus had reached it's limit of being funny.  The supporting characters from Toni Collette and Catherine Keener are fun additions to the story that add to the human element of the film.  The only thing I didn't like was that Dreyfus's character seems to spend the second half of the film in some sort of willful denial while she tries to pursue a path of enlightenment about Gandlofini's character and what possible future they might have while at the same time she knowingly plants the seeds of her own destruction.,1392163200,2,1184,4.7560975609756095

6041843,4,B00FZ4KT84,"This isn't a big movie, but it's well acted. It's pretty much a traditional romantic comedy, but since the characters are older, the plot is a bit more logical and the characters do things that are closer to reality than most rom-coms. Nothing disastrous happens, just an older couple trying to figure things out. That being said I'm going to miss James Gandolfini, he did a great job in this movie, and it is more poignant knowing that we won't see him again.",1391990400,,460,4.554216867469879

6041874,4,B00FZ4KT84,"Enough Said, with James Gandolfini (RIP), and Julia Louis Dreyfus was a very different role for the former mafia boss Tony Sprono, but boy was he sweet, lovable and played a wonderful part as Albert, divorced father to a teenage daughter about to head off to college, and as a man dreading the empty nest. I fell in love with Albert, a big cuddly, gentle-giant.  Eva, played by Dreyfus, worked as a masseuse, a divorced mom, to a daughter also about to head off for college. The chemistry between the two is great, the dialog is fantastic, and how the two connect, the people they have in common made this a funny and most touching story. Even my husband loved it, and it isn't the type of story he would normally enjoy.

6041875,5,B00FZ4KT84,"I, like many other people, watched this film specifically for James Gandolfini. I knew it wasn't going to be your typical rom-com (which is good, since I hate rom-coms) but other than that, I didn't know what to expect. As I was watching it, I found myself cringing in some places, due to the dialogue between Dryfuss and Gandolfini, and some of the awkward interactions. Then it dawned on me halfway through how brilliant the film is. Yes, there are moments of awkwardness, but aren't most relationships like that in the beginning? You are trying to figure each other out and get through those moments of ""oh why did I just say that?"" It is utterly honest in its depiction of new relationships and social interactions. It's not overblown, you don't want to gag over the mushiness of it. It's a romance movie for those who hate romance movies.",1391644800,,843,4.6644295302013425

I can't say enough about the cast, particularly Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini.  I found their relationship refreshingly believable... a testament to their talent.  JDL has found a place outside of TV... she could very well pull off a dramatic role.  JG, he had wonderful comedic timing.  What a shame that he left this earth far too soon.

Gandolfini is, however, in my opinion, almost a too-good-to-be-true fellow looking for romance second time around.

It's one of the best films about divorce and adult romance to hit the screen in a long time. Julia Louis Dreyfus and the late James Gandolfini take on roles that gently shove them out of their comfort zones -- to one where JLD longs for romance -- something we rarely see her do -- and Gandolfini bears his soft underbelly.

This film works because the actors play adults who are looking for romance rather than 20  somethings who have relationship issues.  This is not a tell-all film rather a sharing of how adults reason.  Adults around a table discussing topics that we all have explored.  This film peeks into the lives of two people who are entertaining the idea of dating which is not easy at any age.

6041928,4,B00FZ4KT84,"A far cry from Tony Soprano, Gandolfini's persona as the self-effacing, witty, intelligent soul Albert, was superb and played with just the right control.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Eva was a lovely, nuanced performance as well.  The dialogue was achingly realistic, enough so that at times while viewing the movie I felt as though I were eavesdropping on neighbors.  While this movie may not appeal to Gen Xers or younger, those of us who are more *ahem* seasoned tend to love it, if not over identify with it.  The film poignantly reflects the pain that comes with love and loss, the anxiety that permeates, and at times spoils, new relationships, and the willingness to pursue a worthwhile, albeit awkward and somewhat mismatched, relationship in spite of it all.  The plot twist may not surprise some, but it's both entertaining and cringeworthy when it is revealed.  I also liked that while the ending was on the upbeat side, it wasn't wrapped in a nice pretty bow like most Hollywood rom-coms.  Again, kind of like real life.  See it and be moved.",1391126400,,1050,4.826815642458101
6041929,2,B00FZ4KT84,"James Gandolfini's last role was one of a wonderful, affable and simple slob.  His character was that of a guy one would want for a friend, but also one that would defy women who have a need to change the men in their lives.  His personality initially and cautiously attracts Dreyfus who unknowingly takes on Gandolfini's ex-wife as a massage client and Dreyfus unprofessionally becomes a friend and a confidant to her.  The loquacious ex-wife shares with Dreyfus her annoyances with Gandolfini that led to their divorce.  Dreyfus soon becomes critical of Gandolfini's mannerisms that his ex-wife found intolerable.  The intolerance of the ex-wife finds its way into the actions of Dreyfus almost through osmosis, and because of this, Dreyfus becomes such an annoying character (made even more annoying by Dreyfus' perfect portrayal) that I found myself becoming intolerant of Dreyfus.  My induced dislike of Dreyfus' character spoiled what few moments of enjoyment I experienced early in the film.  By the film's end, I was feeling such annoyance that I thought I would have been better off not having viewed any of it.

The Acting in this film is very good and supporting actors not only aptly develop their own characters but skillfully serve to expand the dimensions of the main characters and their effects upon others in the film.  I suppose the script was very good at delivering the intended story and message.  What I do not understand is why put such talent, intellect and energy into such a poor outcome.

In conclusion, this film was a comedy only in the sense that it was not a tragedy.  I smiled a few times early in the film, but I never laughed.  Of all of the sentiments I might have after viewing a film, annoyance is the only one I personally cannot accept as an intended result, regardless of any excellence that may have surfaced during its viewing.  Some might think of this film as a date movie, but I think such a categorization would only apply if one is foolishly attempting to test the strength of a budding relationship.  At the risk of being accused of sexism, I think guys should skip this one and gals should view it critically.",1391126400,,2159,4.781671159029649

 There is one very good reason to see 'Enough Said' and that is of course the late James Gandolfini's performance. It was nice seeing him in a role where he played a character that was the opposite of Tony Soprano, the part he'll always be known for. Here he's a self-effacing, low key, 'good guy', probably close in temperament to the way friends and family have described him in real life.

The film's inciting incident occurs when Eva, a divorced masseuse with a teenage daughter, is introduced to Gandolfini's character, Albert, at a party in an affluent section of Los Angeles. Eva also meets Marianne, a successful poet, at the party and she takes her on as one of her massage clients.

The film proceeds slowly as Albert courts Eva. Despite his girth, Albert manages to charm Eva who confesses that she usually isn't attracted to large men but is gradually won over by his sense of humor.

The break into Act II, occurs when Eva discovers that her new massage client (and newly found friend) is Albert's ex-wife. The main weakness of the plot hinges on Eva's decision not to tell Marianne that she's going out with Albert. The explanation given is that Eva somehow also likes Marianne and doesn't want to upset her. This, of course, is at the expense of her relationship with Albert.

It's hard to believe that Eva, due to her poor choice, didn't anticipate that she would end up in such an awkward position like trying to hide in the bushes, to avoid making contact with Marianne's daughter, who she had met earlier as well as that even more awkward moment when Albert finds her at Marianne's house.

The bulk of 'Enough Said' hinges on Eva's bad decision and one keeps wondering why she simply couldn't have been honest with Marianne from the get go. But of course if that's the case, there would have been no movie.

As a character, Marianne is unlikeable and one-note, with her constant put-downs of her ex-husband. But she also serves the purpose of putting doubts in Eva's mind as to whether Albert is truly a good catch. Most of the complaints do seem trivial, including Albert's penchant for separating the onions in the guacamole and his inability to clean up after himself. But his rigid insistence that he does whisper (when he clearly doesn't), is a point, which, if I were Eva, would not overlook.

Nonetheless, as things play out, Eva does realize the error of her ways, leading to the heart felt reconciliation at the film's climax.

'Enough Said' also has a number of sub-plots best described as only slightly amusing. One involves Eva's daughter's friend, who enjoys spending quality time with Eva, much to the chagrin of her own mother.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus is most enjoyable when she plays off of Gandolfini's self-deprecating humor. The banter between the two is what makes 'Enough Said' so engaging. Nonetheless, Eva's failure to come clean at the onset, resulting in the plot's complications, is not something I believe most people would have chosen to do in real life.",1390867200,5,3040,4.760456273764259

This is the kind of movie that doesn't have many showy scenes, but truly stays with you thanks to its maturity and delicacy. The premise of the film is straight out of a sitcom, but the dialogue is first-rate and easily overcomes any plot problems.

The girl's got talent and a voice of her own that happens to resound very significantly in the middle age generation. ENOUGH SAID is a quiet, gentle, sweet, and disarming little film that is so well written it feels like being a voyeur over the back fence.

Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a divorced and single parent of a teenage girl, spends her days enjoying work as a masseuse while dreading her daughter's impending departure for college. Her friend Sarah (Toni Collette) insists she go out to clubs to associate with people other than her massage clients. She meets Albert (James Gandolfini) - a sweet, funny and like-minded man who is also divorced and facing the departure of his daughter to college. The two rather nonchalantly enter a romance and Eva gains a new client - famous poet Marianne (Catherine Keener) who unloads her disappointment with the slob she had been stuck with and allows Eva, during sessions, to do likewise. It slowly becomes evident (through the interaction of Eva's and Albert's daughters as well as the complaints of Marianne), that Marianne's slob of an ex is actually Albert. Now enlightened and with a skewed view of her ability to read other people as well as her own misconceptions of what she wants in a partner pries a schism between Eva and Albert - and very wisely on Holofcener's script we are left wonder how things will end or develop.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus is brilliant as is James Gandolfini whose interaction is spot-on as far as contemporary relationships are concerned. But the rest of the cast is not far behind - with Keener as radiant as ever and Colette as fine a comic foil as can be found. Not a great movie, but a very moving one!

I saw the trailer and the extended preview (which made me laugh out loud and sold me on the whole flick).
I like to laugh out loud during a movie, who doesnt? this also drew me into the characters and relationships.
The writing and acting was successful. Since I don't often feel as positive about this type of movie,I chose the 5 stars.
It may be the only Romantic comedy I watch for another few years. Well done. I hope others enjoy this also.",1390435200,,803,4.583333333333333

6042014,5,B00FZ4KT84,I loved this movie. It was about relationships and had a great message. We can be so easily influenced by others if we aren't strong without ourselves. I could watch this again.,1390435200,,177,4.5625

JG and JLD hardly seemed acting, which--in the context of this movie--was mostly nice and you could imagine they were people you knew, except she has a habit of acting with her upper lip and teeth which I find irritating and unnatural.

6042027,4,B00FZ4KT84,"You may recall hearing about this movie around the time James Gandolfini died in Italy last year (2013).  I really liked this movie.  Julie Louis Dreyfus and Gandolfini are both unexpected treats.  She isn't ""Elaine"" from Seinfeld or the ""VEEP.""  He isn't Tony Soprano.  It's a sweet story.

Showing both actors as divorced parents, anyone who has ever been married had kids or known someone with kids can relate.  No sugar coating here!  Kids on the cusp of adulthood can be a joy while they simultaneously break your heart, and these two make us thankfully see the humor in it all.",1390348800,,456,4.592592592592593

Both had wrinkles, James with his pot belly and Julia with no make up. It's the kind of movie that give some laugh out loud moments while your also saying ""yeah I went through that"" Both characters are single, both have daughters getting ready to go off to college. You cheer for them to make it because in the end they seem like a regular nice couple. All in all it's a good movie.",1390348800,,493,4.311827956989247

6042036,5,B00FZ4KT84,Loved it!  Will watch multiple times.  Gandolfini and Louis-Dreyfuss are great.  Definattely hits an older audience.  But funny as hell.,1390348800,,136,5.65

6042044,5,B00FZ4KT84,Julia Louis-Dreyfuss is a bona fide movie star who gives a wonderful performance.  James Gandolfini was the big surprise as he's the direct opposite of Tony Soprano.  Sorry that he is gone too soon as he would have had a great and varied acting career.,1390348800,,252,4.5777777777777775

I'm divorced, have a teen-aged daughter, and am the same age as Julia Louis-Drefus and could relate to a lot of what went on in this movie.  I found her very character a ""real"" person.  She wore old jeans and a sweatshirt to the airport, she fell into the trap of listening too much to her friend about her guy, missed her daughter not needing her as much anymore, made mistakes, but was a good person at heart.  I do like movies where characters are real people and are shown going about their everyday lives.  I'm glad it ended the way that it did.  Very pleasantly surprised.",1390262400,,628,4.370689655172414

I expected James Gandolfini to be wonderful in both the dramatic and comedic moments, but it was Julia L-D who surprised me by shining as both a comedic and dramatic actress.  In fact, the whole cast is excellent.

6042099,5,B00FZ4KT84,"There aren't enough superlatives to describe how superb this film is.  Writer-director Nicole Holofcener has crafted a work that is both insightful and funny.  The film portrays two people who were hurt in previous relationships who walk with trepidation before entering another one.  It's interesting how these people would take something as insignificant as how somebody eats guacamole or butters their popcorn and blow it out of proportion.  Ideally cast are Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini as two people in the middle of life who tread carefully in the arena that is love.  The chemistry between the two cannot be overstated.  Think Tracy and Hepburn, Bogart and Bacall, Wayne and O'Hara, Allen and Keaton that's how good they are.  I don't know if it was a challenge for them because both Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini are usually associated with different type fare but light romance fits them to a tee.  If I were to find fault with the film, and it's a minor quibble, is that I found the plot device involving Gandolfini's ex-wife played by Catherine Keener unnecessary and a distraction.  This character seemed a little loopy to me and any information coming from her suspect.  Some are labeling this a romantic-comedy but I view it more as a drama with comic elements that are apparent in everyday life.  Overlooked completely by the just announced Oscar nominations this is definitely one of last year's better films.",1390089600,3,1436,5.0423728813559325

6042106,2,B00FZ4KT84,"For starters,

I'm not one who dislikes chick flicks by any means. I will watch almost any movie of any genre. So when my girlfriend said she was in the mood for a comedy, we stumbled upon Enough Said.

This ain't no comedy.

The main theme of this movie is awkward, really awkward. The characters are awkward, the dialogue is awkward, the situation is awkward, everything is damn awkward.

And you know what? It never gets better. Sure the flimsy plot gets resolved and there's some sort of character progression. But it's just not really that funny.

It's a movie about being middle aged, relationship problems, being in a divorce, having kids that are all grown up, and dating. Does this sound like a comedy to you? I don't think so, no, no, no.

It's a romance movie trying to disguise itself as a comedy. There are no outlandish funny moments, just some quips of dialogue that may make you chuckle. But ya ain't gonna find funny here.

The sub plots made no sense, the characters aren't really that likeable, and there's no real pay off in the ending. The acting was fine and the movie did have a slight charm to it. But honestly, if you're looking for a comedy? You're better off watching The Heat than this movie.

Enough said.",1390003200,6,1234,4.527027027027027

This is definitely a good movie to sit and watch with your hunny on date night or something. It is so romantic in parts, you feel mushy watching.
I laughed, cried and was glued from beginning to end, and all while extremely sick. If it can keep my attention that long under these circumstances, than it must be a good movie.",1390003200,,595,4.182608695652174

It was better than I even hoped it would be, and worth every cent!  It's funny, because it is SO realistic! About 2, not-so-perfect people, who are perfect for each other! I've already watched it about 5 times, in less than a week!! ( ..just be aware that it's not some, ""fast-paced-funny"" comedy..like Julia's TV comedies! ) It's a cool, yet lovely film to watch, when you're in a hanging-out-mood..w/ the time to truly enjoy & appreciate these 2 characters...& their very funny/ very REAL moments together, as they're getting to know one another!

I really have to say, these two actors, were so terrific together..and I found it sad, to realize that I'd never be able to see James Gandolfini in another movie...especially one like THIS. ( a love story...) It was great to witness the on-screen chemistry, that these 2 had w/ each other..& it was nice to see him, as such lovable, sweet, teddy bear, for a change! (-he'll be greatly missed by so many fans, like myself! )
  I kept thinking about what a truly AMAZING casting job, was done here!

They have fun together and use their time to get to know each other. The relationship is going well until Eva realizes that one of her clients is Albert's ex-wife. Their relationship begins to change due to the ex-wife's stories about Albert. Consequently Eva changes the way she relates to Albert.

Eva embarrasses Albert in front of her friends . You can imagine his hurt and confusion when their relationship was going so well for both of them.

This movie covers a range of emotions. The characters display happiness and joy, disappointment and confusion, love and definite dislike, friendship and doubt. There are the emotions the parents reveal when their daughters are leaving for college.

As several months pass, although Eva and Albert have parted, there is one day when they meet again. It appears they may date but you will have to see the movie and ending to make your own decision about their future together.

The draw for the two of them was that they both had daughters leaving for college and experiencing all that goes with letting go of your children from the nest. There was no glitz in this film...which was fine with me. I was drawn into the solidness of gandolfini's personality - imperfect but principled and solid. Julia was just trying to make her way and vulnerable to the trials of starting a new relationship at midlife with someone at first blush may not have seemed a fit.

That being said, I found the second half of this movie to be slow and predictable.  We actually lost interest in watching the movie, and instead starting predicting how the movie would end.  Having not viewed the movie in the theater, we thought maybe that the ending was re-edited for the DVD after James Gandofina's real-life death.  The producers could have chosen an earlier scene that could satisfy the need for an ending.  I know this didn't really happen, but the abrupt ending surprised us.

The acting wasn't horrible, and I have always enjoyed James Gandofini and I know this was his last film before he died, so I guess I was expecting so much more.

And I'm glad I did. the chemistry between the leads were great. These are not beautiful people compared to hollywood standards. so the movie felt actually authentic. Which is good because the supporting cast really sucked. The only other note was teenage girls were hot.

6042139,5,B00FZ4KT84,"If it wasn't enough to know that James Gandolfini died at such a young age, watching him in this film, brings home what a marvelous actor he was. We have seen the tough guys, but now he brings the romantic guy with so much going for him. Julia Louis-Dreyfus has accolades coming her way for her character in VEEP, and now she brings this wonderful character to the screen. I cannot say enough good things about these actors and this film.

Nicole Holofcener is the director of 'Enough Said', and she brought home two of the finest performances I have seen this year. A glance, a twitch of the eyebrow, and we know what the character is thinking. This is a funny romantic film,with laugh out loud laughs. Julia Louis-Dreyfus and the late James Gandolfini, are in a word, Magnifique!

Albert, Gandolfini and Eva, Louis-Dreyfus are both divorced parents of teens getting ready for college. Eva is a masseuse and goes from home to home to meet her clients. It is a tough job, listening to these people tell her their problems, but she does OK. Albert works in a Film History Museum. They meet at a party, each one says they have not met anyone that attracts them, but, of course, the more they talk, the more they like. They date, and everything seems fine until it isn't. Both parents dread having their girls leave. Both girls are anxious, but OK about leaving.

Albert and Eva's relationship becomes public knowledge and friends meet them. .Eva has some interesting pals, Sarah played by Toni Collette and Marianne, played by Catherine Keener, who for various reasons have their own problems. Mistakes are made, and things happen, not for the better. The times and places to get to the heart of the matter, is the film itself. The relationships that shatter seem not to be repairable.

What carries this film are the characters and the two we are talking about, Albert and Eva. This is a film that goes from humour to tears in a split second, and that happens because of these characters, their feelings and emotions are on their sleeves. There is a great deal that goes on in this film , and I bid you see it.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 01-14-14",1389657600,,2147,4.609947643979058

Her character was annoying and cringe-worthy at times. Even comedic attempts fell flat for me. You'd think these two would have great on-screen chemistry, but they did not. The characters were mostly all miserable. The movie was sad most of the way through with light moments here and there. All in all I felt I needed to watch a real comedy afterward.

6042162,4,B00FZ4KT84,"James Gandolfini plays Albert, a guy with some hygiene issues, a few quirks, and a mellow lifestyle. He's divorced from Marianne, a poet with her own emotional luggage. Their snobby daughter is soon headed off to college. Enter Eva (played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus) who is also divorced and has a daughter headed off to college. Both Albert and Marianne meet Eva at a party, learning that she is a massage therapist. This puts Eva into their lives, opening the possibility for zany conundrums since Marianne blabs about Albert, who soon becomes Eva's boyfriend.

There are no real ""high spots"" in this movie. It trundles along, carried by the performances of top actors like Gandolfini and Luis-Dreyfus, as well as Katherine Keener. Nonetheless, the comic spots shine as natural, even as the dialog sometimes slips into the mundane. Dinner parties, massage sessions, visits to restaurants all open wounds old and new as the sore points of relationships rise to the surface. In these settings, this top-notch cast really shines, as they pull off the interactions without ever hinting that they're acting. It might be a hidden camera your watching for how natural it is.
Among the main plot is the subtext of having one's children move on with their lives, something that affects Albert and Eva deeply. The empty nest syndrome looms for them, to the point where Eva invites her daughters friend (who is not going to college) to move in. A bit of conflict pops up here and could have used more development as an underlying theme.
The biggest surprise for me was Gandolfini playing against type. With a beard, a calm demeanor, and the look of love in his eyes, he shows his acting chops for all to see. Enjoy it.",1389225600,5,1706,4.822525597269625

I couldn't disagree more.  The story was fairly predictable with one small twist.  The acting was just fair but certainly nothing stood out as being award-worthy.  Mostly, I think people are nostalgic about James Gandolfini who died of a sudden heart attack just as the film was being released.  Given the number of fat jokes about him in the film (and well deserved ones - what a shame he didn't take better care of himself), I can see why people might give it a sympathy vote but otherwise, I'd skip this one.",1389225600,3,711,4.747967479674797

It's so great to see an adult love story without meet cute or I love you scenes in front of crowds at the airport... none of the usual romcom gimmicks except one I won't mention.. But even this of plot felt like a side note to the larger issue of these two very real, round characters meeting and falling in love. Julie Louis-Dreyfus' portrayal of a needy woman facing the empty nest feels poignant and unpracticed. James Gandolfini displays the kind of depth seen in Dr. Melfi's office on the Soprano's but without the sociopathic overtones - you really feel for the guy. He's sweet and misunderstood, with a fine sense of humor and an amazing backlog of television knowledge. Great movie for anyone who likes smart dialogue and watching talented actors being allowed to do good work, but especially for those of us who used to love romantic comedies but just can't take the gimmicks anymore.",1389139200,,910,4.69375

6042186,2,B00FZ4KT84,"I went to see this film for two reasons, because it got great reviews and because of James Gandolfini. Unfortunately, the reviews were wrong. Great performances by Dreyfus and Gandolfini are forced to cohabitate with a terrible, mundane plot. This makes it impossible to feel sympathy for the characters or their lives. It seems as if the characters are purposely depicted in a way as to evoke pity. This is enraging because these characters are not pathetic in the least. I tried really really hard to empathize with the them, but it was impossible. They are just not realistic and therefore impossible to care about.

Julia Louis Dreyfus uninteresting character egomaniacally brings on all her own misfortunes. We see her make bad choice after bad choice. It is no wonder that she ruins all her personal relationships. She's an idiot! But Dreyfus acting is fantastic. What a paradox!

The most enraging thing is that this film was advertised as a humorous drama. I left the theater post-film, fuming at being misled. I felt Id had been taken like a sucker into thinking this was some kind of quirky little indie film, something Squid and the Whale-ish (even though I don't like Squid, I like that genre). I would have accepted the film more openly had it at least been a romantic comedy, but Enough Said is a full-on romance. It has some hilarious parts, but they are single handedly the result of Dreyfus spectacular performance.

This film snubs us unlucky people by declaring that it is in fact our own fault that are we live screwed up lives. But we unlucky people don't want to be told it's our fault. We like to blame the world for our problems, and we like to see charters on the screen that fall from grace not because they fly to close to the sun, but because the sun explodes and engulfs them in flames.

I can name on one hand the romances stories I like, so perhaps by not being part of this film's target audiences I am negatively biased. Whatever it was the film's producers were trying to evoke in me, they failed at it.

6042187,4,B00FZ4KT84,"Nicole Holofcener has directed a handful of movies that few people have seen.  They have fallen into a category of ""women's movies"" that most men steer clear of lest they become gay or something.  I've seen them all (""Lovely & Amazing"" is my favorite) and I'm still straight.  And while her movies are far from terrible they are not terribly memorable either.

""Enough Said"" is her best feature yet and yes, it's OK for a man too.  A large part of the attraction is the late James Gandolfini who plays Albert, a bit of a slob, but funny and adorable.  Albert is divorced from Marianne (Holofcener regular Catherine Keener).  Together they have a daughter heading for college.  Although Albert is a key character in the storyline, his counterpart, Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) has multiple relationships to deal with.  If you've watched Louis-Dreyfus over the years, you should be able to appreciate her dead-pan humor, much of which is displayed all over her face.  That talent comes across equally well on the big screen.

Like Albert, Eva is divorced and has a daughter headed off to college.  When Eva and Albert meet for the first time at a party, the chemistry between them is evident right off the bat.  Holofcener who also wrote the movie, is equally generous with some great lines that each actor delivers almost offhandedly.  They're both great.  Their lives get complicated as Eva had given her business card to Marianne at the same party.  She's a massage therapist and gets a call from Marianne.

It's just a matter of time when the deception is unveiled and of course everyone is hurt.  While the ending can be predicted, the banter between the characters is terrific.  Toni Collette and Ben Falcone play Eva's married best friends and they get in some funny zingers as well.  Highly recommended for all genders.",1386115200,16,2137,4.8264462809917354

6042191,5,B00FZ4KT84,"This is a marvelous film that vividly demonstrates that an excellent screen play in the hands of good actors doesn't have to cost a great deal.  This is perhaps the most realistic portrayal of life and love that I have seen on the screen in a very long time.  The main characters Eva -- a masseuse and Albert -- a Museum Curator have survived first marriages.  He was married to a shallow, self-absorbed woman who bought into the perpetual dieting, exercise, and pretense that characterizes much of Society today.  Eva's marriage just didn't work out.  When asked she couldn't really say why she got a divorce other than ""we just didn't seem to fit"".  But the film really offered some great insight into what marriage and love is all about.  I think those people who have been married a long time will probably get and understand this film a lot better than young unmarried or recently married people.  What we see with Eva and Albert are two people not sure they want to get involved again but they find they sort of like each other.  As their relationship grows they find that a little tolerance, a little understanding, and a little forgiveness provides for a more stable relationship and a lot more fun.  Albert is overweight and doesn't really care, he isn't the most handsome guy, but he is comfortable being himself.  Eva seems uncertain who she is or what she wants out of life but finds herself drawn to the down to earth life style of Albert. Both are older and wiser and it shows.

Albert and Eva are real people. People with a sense of humor, with ordinary problems, and low expectations.  My favorite scene was the final one where they sat together on the front steps as they made up over their serious quarrel.  She nudges him and they both just get a chuckle out of their quarrel as their good humor reasserts itself and they are reconciled.  Having been married for a very long time I have lived that scene many times.  I left the theater warm and comfortable in my own marriage.  This is a wonderful movie and I highly recommend it.",1383782400,39,2049,4.539509536784741
6042192,5,B00FZ4KT84,"When the credits finished rolling on Enough Said and the words For Jim came on the screen, I shed a tear.  The shock of Gandolfinis death and the impact it has had on me as a fan is still hard to take, and I have to say that watching him in Enough Said was one of those bittersweet moments.  It was sweet, because this is, without a single doubt, the greatest performance hes ever given.  It was bitter because I knew that Id never see him tap into this side of himself again.

I seriously want to cry right now.

The power of Gandolfinis performance comes from the fact that he is not acting here, at all.  Hes simply living this performance, and he completely wins the audience over.  While the ensemble as a whole is wonderful, Gandolfini is in a league all his own.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus is hilarious, and yet where she is obviously reaching for those moments (she gets them, but you can see her reaching), Gandolfini just sits back and lets it all roll off of his natural charm and charisma.  He never has to reach out for anything, it just comes to him.  Toni Collette (the best Ive seen her in years), Catherine Keener (always a joy) and Ben Falcone work with Holofceners rich dialog and character development with ease, but none with the ease of Gandolfini, who delivers one of my favorite performances of the year.

Enough Said is not the best film Ive seen this year, but it is probably my favorite, and that says a lot.  No film so far this year has given so much JOY while watching it.  I never stopped smiling.  Even when I was crying (and that happened a few times) I was still smiling.  I also never have ever in my life wanted a clich&eacute;d happy ending so badly.

Like seriously, I was praying for one.

Enough Said tells the beautiful story of Eva, a divorced mother and massage therapist dreading the idea of her daughter moving off to college.  At a party she meets two people, Marianne and Albert.  Marianne is a poet who is in need of a massage and wants someone to complain about her ex-husband to.  Albert is that ex-husband, in need of a new start in life.  Eva winds up being the best thing that ever happened to either of them, but as she listens to Marianne go on and on about how awful Albert is, her relationship with the otherwise charming and sensible man becomes tarnished.  Can she really maintain both relationships, and what is it about Marianne and her bounty of complaints that keeps Eva coming back for more, when she so obviously has fallen for Albert?

While watching Enough Said I couldn't help but think that this is everything that last years Hope Springs should have been, but wasnt.  Love at middle age should not be hard to watch, but should be celebrated and loved.  While this film is hilarious (seriously, the whole first half of the film is one giant batch of wit and charm) but the relationship between Albert and Eva never becomes a joke, even when we are supposed to laugh at their awkward bedroom antics.  This relationship and all the weight it carries is taken seriously.  That is the beauty of Enough Said, because it feels so richly understood and it knows exactly what it is trying to convey, and it does just that.",1383523200,30,3177,4.451557093425605
6042193,4,B00FZ4KT84,"""I've been listening to this woman say the worst things about the guy I'm starting to really like."" Eva (Louis-Dreyfus) is a masseuse and a single parent who is tired of being single. When she meets Albert (Gandolfini) at a party she is surprised when he asks her out. She has a few dates with him and begins to really like him and tells her new client about him and the client begins to bash her ex-husband. When Eva realizes they are talking about the same guy she is torn as to what to do. I was interested in watching this because my two favorite TV shows ever are Seinfeld and The Sopranos. I also went in a little depressed because being a huge Gandolfini fan I was saddened at his passing and knowing this was his last movie made it a little bittersweet. All that out of the way I have to say that I did like this movie but it is not a typical romantic comedy. Most movie like this are light, mostly fluff and leave you feeling happy. When this ended I felt sad and depressed. Some of it had to do with Gandolfini and some with the movie itself. While this is still a romantic comedy it is very real and that added to the sadness. I'm not saying not to watch this because I did like it but don't expect to have a super happy time watching it. Overall, good and worth watching but the saddest romantic comedy I have ever seen.

It was a great comedy but I did cry at the end because I know I will never see that man again. He was sexy in a different kind of way. Not what we typically expect.

6042195,5,B00FZ4KT84,"""Enough Said,"" written and directed by Nicole Holofcener, is a bittersweet romantic comedy about two lonely people who reach out to one another at a critical point in their lives. Both Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a self-employed masseuse, and Albert (James Gandolfini), are divorced; each has a daughter who is about to leave home for college. Louis-Dreyfus plays Eva, a neurotic and insecure woman with terrible judgment. After Eva starts dating Albert, she makes a startling discovery that throws her for a loop.

Holofcener's understated script contains a tinge of melancholy since, as a divorced mom with kids, she probably knows from personal experience that parenting a teenager alone is not easy. Gandolfini is wonderful as a portly middle-aged man, firmly set in his ways and uninterested in a makeover. Albert enjoys calorie-laden meals and sheepishly admits that he is a slob. Eva enjoys Albert's gentle and self-deprecating humor, intelligence, and easygoing manner but soon grows irritated by his flaws. Catherine Keener is impressive as an elegant and attractive poet, Marianne, who becomes Eva's client; Marianne loves venting about her ex-husband to Eva. Complicating matters further is Eva's reluctance to let go of her daughter, Ellen, the only person in her life whom she can rely on for unconditional affection.

Louis-Dreyfus, a terrific physical comedienne, comically lugs around a heavy massage table from client to client. Viewers cannot help but wince as they watch this petite masseuse climb up endless stairs on her way to a young male client who never offers to help. ""Enough Said"" is, in some ways, painful to watch, since the director calls attention to the fault lines in our lives with such clarity and insight. Eva's friend, Sarah, a psychotherapist, is herself in need of therapy (her marriage is far from perfect), and Marianne, a woman with impeccable taste, is self-absorbed and impatient with those who do not meet her lofty standards.

Holofcener has a great deal to say about the ways in which we make our lives unnecessarily difficult. She implies that people who are forgiving, have realistic expectations, and are not overly critical stand the best chance at rebuilding their lives after a disastrous first marriage. ""Enough Said"" is a poignant and, at times, agonizing look at the self-destructive behavior of individuals who foolishly impede their own happiness.",1382918400,7,2405,5.2578125
