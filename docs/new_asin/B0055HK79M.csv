8458259,4,B0055HK79M,"As a screenplay writer for Vimeo/Youtube director Frank Stamm, Im judging this film by the same standards Id grade a low-budget project I was involved in.

The cons:

The sound could have been improved. Some actors were not as audible as they should have been  as if the microphone was positioned in the back of the room they were recorded in. At other times soundtrack music competed with the volume of the actors voices.

The faults listed above were very evident in the first few minutes of the film (among other places) so the film got off to a shaky start.

The pros:

After the early minutes of the film, the best actor showed up, who I believe is named Anju McIntyre. She played a reporter. Im not saying shes Meryl Streep, but she had a definite view of her character and how she should act, and unlike most of the other actors she had good diction. The film would have had a better more confident start if shed been used there.

The other girls in the production, while not great actors, were nice looking.

The story at a certain point caught me up despite the films faults. The special effects near the end of the film were fun, and well done in a low budget way. I was impressed with the costuming and effects.",1481155200,,1222,4.4
8458260,4,B0055HK79M,"The Polonia Brother (s)  are infamous for their fake rubber headed creatures who inhabit the forests of Pennsylvania. This aspect is utilized in their hunt for the Muckman. A camera crew is lead by a hot prima donna Asian chick with cleavage. The males comprise the idiots in the group, while only the females have any intellect. Their search takes them to the remote ""Muckman Mooseum"" filled with fake artifacts. Billy (Alison Whitney) the driver of the van is doing her own filming.

This is a comedy film, easy on any horror. I found it better than most of the Polonia productions as it doesn't take itself serious or have extended road trips where we see Pa. highways in much need of repair.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Good for a laugh or at least a smile.",1474588800,,767,4.543478260869565
8458261,5,B0055HK79M,"A fun little b-movie. Anju McIntyre was great. It's a Brett Piper film, one of his best. If you liked his others, you'll probably like this.",1471910400,,140,4.423076923076923
8458262,3,B0055HK79M,"A crew cobbled together by a desperate former TV personality set out into the woods to film the fabled Muckman, a Bigfoot like creature that was the subject of a live TV hoax years earlier. As the crew get deeper into the woods and meet more of the people involved with the project, they come to suspect that not everything is as it seems and their lives are in danger.

This isn't one of Piper's better films, but it succeeds through a combination of eye-rolling slapstick, fleeting wit, and B-movie shenanigans. The acting isn't great and there's a shortage of Piper's awesome effects worth; however, the whole manages to be passably entertaining and admirable, honest effort to make an entertaining movie. Mild Recommendation.",1408492800,,729,4.926829268292683
8458263,5,B0055HK79M,"Muckman is a modern classic.  It would make a great date night movie.  I totally picture this playing at a drive-in packed with people making out.  It's completely ridiculous but so very, very well done.",1370390400,,203,4.742857142857143
8458264,4,B0055HK79M,"Exactly what I expected...and that's a good thing.  ;)  Muckman is what you expect it to be--a great amusing ""scary"" movie.  With these sorts of movies it is always a gamble, but this one came out a winner.  If you are a fan of the genre you won't be disappointed.",1368316800,,264,4.22
8458265,4,B0055HK79M,"MUCKMAN is another well-made, humorous, ultra-low budget film from Brett Piper (BITE ME!, SHOCK-O-RAMA, BACTERIUM, etc.). As a big Piper fan, I enjoyed his tribute to / parody of rural legends, and the shows that capitalize on them. The cast is funny, the story is simple (though slow at times), and the title creature is above average for a ""man-in-a-rubber-suit"" movie. There's even some cool stop-motion stuff near the end for added kicks! If you enjoy this one, then I would also recommend the Brett Piper 4-Pack...",1352332800,,519,4.977011494252873
8458266,4,B0055HK79M,"Brett Piper has directed many b-movies over the years, my favorite of his being Bite Me. Muckman is his latest and although it's not his greatest, it still has more positives than negatives. Anju McIntyre aka AJ Khan, gives the film's best performance, and quite frankly the best performance of her career. She plays a celebrity who is a diva in every sense of the word, even considering murder to get what she wants. The Muckman monster is a creature who resembles The Swamp Thing. There are some good laughs in Muckman, as this plays out as more of a horror spoof than an actual horror film. Probably the only thing that holds Muckman back is its lack of exploitation elements. There is no nudity, although it comes close a couple of times. And there is very little gore, as well. Still, Muckman is fun for those who want to watch a light monster movie this Halloween season.",1317427200,2,877,4.556962025316456
8458267,3,B0055HK79M,"Starring : A.J. Khan

This is a fun movie that follows a former BIG reality star and shows his comeback effort to return to cable television stardom with some credibility this time.

Some wonderful casting especially A. J. Khan ( A Scream Queen Icon) and Alison Whitney,And special mention to Danielle Donahue,Who may steal every scene she is in.

The Monster looks real good,Well The real MUCKMAN looks good,There may be a fake costume in the plot that doesn't look so threatening, LOL.

The special effects ( Stop motion articulation and some real props ) that BRETT PIPER is known for crop up in this film and are most welcome,Making the ending a thang of beauty for horror film fans.",1315958400,2,687,4.7
