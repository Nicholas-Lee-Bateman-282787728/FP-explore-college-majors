This collection needs to be seen in Bluray to fully appreciate it's potential.  So far, all discs are of the highest quality and interestingly narrated; As good as, or better, than the very best nature documentary one has ever seen on television.  Well worth the price for the amount of high-quality footage (over 1000 minutes); Can easily be viewed more than once, especially by children...There is no price difference whether you buy these sets individually or in this box set---this way, though, they come in their individually marked plastic cases, and all 4 boxes fit into the pictured cardboard case.",1223164800,107,915,5.026490066225166

4884632,5,B005SH62C0,"Last year I purchased all  the DVDs in the BBC Natural History collection. When I watched them for the first time, they all performed perfectly. Today I was going to watch Wild China again; I was dismayed to discover that it would no longer load. Instead, I received a message to 'check disc'. I was dismayed even more to discover that none of the other DVDs titlles in the Natural History Collection would no longer load either. Altough none of them were dirty or damaged, I cleaned them, but it made no difference. Can anyone tell why this happened? I also have The Human Planet, and Civilization, both from BBC, and they continue to work fine, but I'm now concerned that they will stop working. I decided to stop buying BBC Blu ray DvDs until I learn what is happening here.

I would appreciate any comments about this problem. I am using a LG BD390 blu-ray player and have had no problem playing other blu- ray DVDs, only those from BBC. I realize this is an old model, but I had no problem playing them a year ago when I first purchased them.",1346544000,,1047,4.419689119170984

4884634,5,B005SH62C0,"This is a review of the ""Planet Earth 6-disc edition"" portion of the reprint/re-release (March 2012) boxed set of BBC Natural History Collection 1, taken from my review posted on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth-Six-Disc-Special-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B005C9YZIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth (Six-Disc Special Edition) [Blu-ray</a>]

So here's the 411 scoop of accompaniments NEW to this 6-disc 2012 BD set that's NOT on the 2007 4-disc BD set, listed in the order of importance:

1) Diaries (bonus in disc 1-4), the 10-min making of clip following each of the 11 main features. Total of ~107 min in SD. Worthy to note, unlike the DVD version and other BBC nature diaries, which auto-plays the diaries immediately following the credits, here you do need to navigate back to the main menu to select these bonuses.

2) 3 new bonus documentaries (disc 6), total 150 min's:
a) Snow Leopards: Beyond the Myth 50 min in HD
b) Secrets of Maya Underworld 50 min in SD
c) Elephant Nomads of the Namib Desert 50 min in SD
-Note: the UK version contains Natural World - Desert Lions 50 min. Not sure why US version left this out. But lucky for US version, UK left out Maya Underworld and Elephants Nomads.

3) The Future (disc 5), 3 episodes in SD; total 3 hours:
a) Saving Species 60 min
b) Into the Wilderness 60 min
c) Living Together 60 min

4) Great PE moments (disc 4) 46 min in SD, narrated by Sir David the Great Attenborough himself.

5) Audio commentaries by producers, but only for 5 of the 11 main episodes: Pole to Pole, Mountains, Caves, Great Plains, Shallow Seas.

6) Music only viewing audio. This feature is a bust. Why in the world would you ever watch a documentary without a narrator? BTW, it's not really music only. The sound effects (water falling, animal sounds, etc.) are still tracked in. I guess they couldn't get rid of that. In my opinion any upgrade to the audio portion should have been to include the Sigourney Weaver (Discovery version) narration.

7) Sneak Peak at Frozen Planet (disc 6) 13 min's in HD. Oh great, more advertising :(. But this IS BBC's next big release following the Life and Human Planet series.

Technical issue: the transfer is 1080i. From my research regarding the ad nauseam debate of PE being i or p, the original cameras used to film this series were no better than 1080i, so that's the limiting step. Though some earlier 2007 BD packages states 1080p, and the signal to your TV indicates p, later releases of the 2007 version corrected this to say 1080i on the package. Considering this series was filmed over the course of the early 2000's, you really can't notch about this (it was the best they had then). The main feature is still reference quality by 2012 standards.  However, regarding the extras, for the most part, ALL the bonus features (with the exception of Snow Leopard and the Sneak Peak Frozen Planet which are clearly HD) are all in SD, and at best, an upscaled 720 clearly not full HD from my sharp 20/20 on my 65"" panny.

Most of you reading this probably already have a copy of Planet Earth on a different format of one of the many prior version(s) which contain a mix and match of various menus or narrations.  You've stumbled across on Amazon here which probably your initial response is, oh no, another one?  Like taking a complicated order for a simple burger involves smorgasbord of holding this or extras on that when it comes to every tailored garnish? Well, the problem with distributors setting the final cut allows no a la carte freedom to pick and chose extras. After all, this IS another chance for distributors to double dip, like in any industry, music, movies, etc. a genealogy of remakes, re-mix edits, extended edition, director's cut, previously unreleased bonuses tracks, re-master, new cover art, all in the name of gouging consumers. Especially with blockbusters, and Planet Earth (PE) is no exception. Yes folks, as long as you buy into it, you've suckered up into their marketing ploy. It was all in their strategies from the very start. After all, companies hire a panel full time solely dedicated to all the nitty-gritty tactical ways in capitalizing the bottom line of $, every chance they get, AKA milking the system. What can you do? Really nothing. You are at their helm when the goods are dangled to you in tantalization, and your pavlovian response is beyond your control. But I'm sure as you're reading this, you're wondering if this set is worth it. So without further a due, let's see what you get, and whether or not you can beat the system to your advantage.

So the concept of double dipping, can you beat the system to your advantage? Well, I'll tell you what I did. Ordered PE Spec Ed 6-disc used (much cheaper, note: got mine for $22), tossed out the scarfed package (it's cheap cardboard anyways). Bought a 6 disc blu-ray case (brand viva elite) for $2.50 from casetopia dot com, which BTW is the exact same size as the 4 disc case (15 mm thickness). Fit's perfectly into your old slip case. Successful upgrade. Donated the old version to a friend. Done.

Ultimately it's up to you, the well informed consumer to flip the switch or say screw you Mr. distributor leech. Everyone's economics and shelf space run the gamut to savvy your rations, like those must have fan boys. Still not sure?, here a logical final decision making:

-If you have both the dvd and original 2007 BD versions, no real need to upgrade unless you really need the bonus of Elephant Nomads.
-If you only have the Discovery US version of Sigourney Weaver narrating and want the original David Attenborough, then go for it.
-If you don't have the dvd version but only have original 2007 BD version, your upgrade will be solely for all those bonus extras, but keep in mind those extras are in standard def.
-If you don't have any copies of PE, this is a must own in every household for all ages. Starting with this Special Edition 6-disc version, you'd be skipping all other previous wasted versions.
-When it comes to double dipping, price of course is always an issue. Currently as of this writing, the price on Amazon for PE 6-disc Spec Edition is as follows: Amaz $35; MarketPlace $33; used $26.

To top it off, a globe limited edition (gift version) is also available. Contains the same materials, just the hardware/ packaging is different, here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth-Limited-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B005C9YZKU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth: Limited Edition [Blu-ray</a>]

4884668,2,B005SH62C0,"I ordered this product twice in 6 months and each time Disc 1 of Wild China was defective. My first order came in March. While the other seven discs are all fine Disc 1 of the Wild China was defective: two out of the 19 chapters on it could not be loaded up. I asked for a replacement of the defective disc but was told that I have to return the whole package (8 discs) for a refund and make a new order. So I returned the package and got the refund promptly.

About 10 days ago I ordered the same product again. This time it is even worse: only two of the 19 chapters on the Disc 1 of Wild China can be played. The rest of 17 chapters simply could not loaded up. The other seven discs again are all fine. One thing I noticed is that these discs do not seem to be new since none of the plastic cases was sealed. In contrast, back in March 2011 all plastic cases were sealed. So I have to return the package for the second time.

Based on what I have encountered, or should I say endured, so far I suspect that a fairly high percentage of Disc 1 of Wild China is defective. Anyway, because of its great contents, which definitely deserve a 5-star rating, I'll try my luck for the third time.

I'll tentatively rate the item as 2-star for its poor quality control.",1313712000,3,1262,4.101214574898785

However, the other reviewers' forewarnings about the packaging are NOT to be taken lightly.  The discs for Wild China, Galapagos, and Ganges behave well enough, and even the 2nd and 3rd discs of the Planet Earth set are passable.  The 1st and 4th of Planet Earth, though, I needed PLIERS to get out.  The discs are snapped in so tightly that they were flexing to the point where they could've easily snapped in half before the packaging let up.

I eventually had to pull out my Leatherman and use it to squeeze/deform the little snap-in protrusion by squeezing it with the broad part of the pliers (see video).  It was pretty nerve racking as the discs were still inside and I was afraid I might scratch or gouge them by mistake!!

Planet Earth needs no introduction, but the other 3 (Galapagos, Wild China, and Ganges) are not only visually stunning and informative, but add an extra element of wonder because the places they cover are so unique and rich with life.  The Wild China series in particular does a fantastic job of balancing its focus on wildlife with a perspective on the sometimes surprising ways in which human interaction has changed the flora and fauna of the country.  Likewise, Ganges gives fascinating insights into the human cultures that line its banks as it winds its way through varied terrain.  These series can be watched multiple times without losing any luster, and it is hard to imagine a similar set of documentaries surpassing them in the near future.

Finally, you MUST own the blu-ray version if you have the hardware to make use of it.  As far as I'm concerned, visuals such as these are the very reason to buy a blu-ray player and HDTV in the first place.  It is a feast for the senses.",1297036800,6,1058,4.686486486486486

Also, consider getting Planet Earth as a box set together w/ either Earth the Biography, or High Definition Natural History Collection, or boxed w/ Life (David Attenborough).

I've upgraded my Planet Earth to blu ray.  It's a big step up in picture from the dvd, I've done side by side comparison.  DVD has extras/bonuses, but it's not worth sacrificing the picture for.  A note: after considerable amount of research, the picture is 1080i.  Even if your package or TV says 1080p signal, 1080i cameras were used to film this entire series, becoming the limiting step.

4884700,4,B005SH62C0,"I had heard alot about planet earth, but had never had ocassion to watch it. It definitly lived up to all the hype. All of these films are broken down into one hour segments, which works well on a weekday when you need some time to wind down after work. The most impressive of the series was planet earth, which basically highlights many places in the world, but never focuses too deeply on any particular location. If I had a complaint, it would be that sometimes it would touch so lightly on a location it felt like I was watching a trailer for a much more detailed portrayal that was never given, but apparently that was the producers intent. Planet earth condenses, I can't imagine how much footage of nature, into a best of each area overview. Most nature films try to go into some depth about a particular area and its wildlife. Planet earth takes a different approach by giving a broad overview of the entire world. It is a best of nature video for the entire globe. It does this by dividing the world into climatic regions; deserts, deciduous forests, rain forests, artic... etc. All of the cinematography is done excellently and it was filmed in high definition, so the colors of the flora and fauna are vivid and seem to come to life on your screen.

The other films are also very good, I would rate them as being as good as most national geographic films. None of them are as long as planet earth and they were not filmed in high definition, but they are well done. Unlike planet earth, they do focus exclusively on one region of the world. Interestingly, two of the films focus on the most well populated areas in the world, India and China. These films are as much about the people of these regions as they are about wildlife. I guess it is difficult to seperate wildlife from people in countries that are so well populated that even in very rural areas wildlife must share space with humanity.

If you are someone who enjoys nature (which you must be if you are bothering to read this review), these films will definitly be worth the money spent. If you want to save money just buy, or at least borrow, planet earth, it is definitly the best of the bunch.",1265673600,13,2169,4.46095717884131

It is a very real possibility that you could break the disc when taking it out of the case for the first time.  Try and bend each individual tab on the center cd holder.

4884718,5,B005SH62C0,"I've been to the Galapagos Islands and, as much as I love the BBC's wildlife unit, at first wondered whether I should bother with a documentary like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Galapagos/dp/B000M2E354/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Galapagos</a>. However, this documentary was awesome and in many ways I saw more of the islands than I saw on my trip. The documentary is a decent length at 2.5 hours and covers the whole gamut of wildlife on the islands. It takes you under the oceans to watch bioluminescent invertebrates and face-to-face with marine iguanas (unfortunately, neither of which are possible as a tourist). Furthermore, the blu-ray version is stunning - frankly, it reminded me how beautiful the area is and makes me want to return soon.

The narrative is generally good, although sometimes it tries too hard to dramatize the Galapagos (i.e., calling the generally lazy marine iguanas ""dragons""). Tilda Swinton's narration can seem a bit slow - she's certainly no David Attenborough - but it's not too bad. Definitely don't let the fact that Attenborough didn't narrate this series discourage you from checking it out.",1259625600,3,1174,5.632768361581921

It is breathtakingly beautiful on Blu-ray and we are pleased with the decision to get the full set.

The Ganges, which we had not seen before, was good.  Planet Earth we knew was a good series.  Galapagos was nice, but having seen it in person I was not blown away by it. The Wild China series was the star of the set.  The photography was amazing.  My husband is a biologist and usually nit-picks the narration of the nature series.  He could find nothing to criticize on the Wild China series.

4884745,5,B005SH62C0,"I've watched all the discs in this set several times and do not hesitate to recommend it enthusiastically to friends and family. All the titles in this set proudly live up the the high level of quality we have come to expect from the BBC, especially after their ground-breaking Planet Earth series.

There is a lot to see here for the $95 that you are paying. This is 1120 minutes of runtime. That's over 19 hours of viewing enjoyment. The discs stand up very well to repeated viewing and I'll never get tired of looking at the beautiful shots and lavish camera work.

- Planet Earth: 9 hrs on 4 discs. This famed series needs no introduction. It's included here in all its 1080p glory.

- Wild China: a wide-spanning and ambitious review of the country's diverse landscape, animals, and people that that packs a dense 5 hours of playtime onto 2 disc. China is a vast country and my only complaint is that 5 hours is too short! The film jumps back and forth between different locations a lot, which breaks the narrative flow for me, and in some parts, I would've loved more time spent on the subject matters, animals, or local cultures shown. The chapters are not divided by locale, but by theme instead, so sometimes the locations overlap with previous chapters.

Has Chinese subtitles.

- Galapagos: 2.5 hours on 1 disc. A very diverse review of many types of land, sea, and airborne animals. Entertaining and informative, with narration by Tilda Swinton that is easy on the ears.

- Ganges: 2.5 hours on 1 disc. I don't remember much from this disc, except the tiger hunt in the mangrove swamp. This is my least favorite in the box, mainly because much of the narrative involves people and scenes of people (perhaps unavoidable in the world's second most populous nation).

- Protected by a snugly fitting glossy hard paperboard outer box.

My only other minor complaint is the Planet Earth multi-disc packaging, which makes it hard to remove from the latches. The latches are too tight.

All in all, an outstanding collection of films sure to please hi-def and nature lovers. The only sad note is the reminders of ecological destruction we humans are creating. Well-worth owning and can be enjoyed with the entire family, young and old.",1245715200,10,2240,4.708439897698209

4884747,5,B005SH62C0,"This set, the Planet Earth portion in particular, is easily the most breathtaking sequence of high definition footage I've yet seen.  The 70mm cameras manage to pick up shots with so much in them that it seems impossible that it can all fit within the frame, and yet everything is rendered in perfect detail.  If you're looking to push your new technological toys to see how pretty a picture they can get, this is the best way to do it right now.

Not only have I put it through lots of use for just myself, it's a constant source of amazement for guests.  Even those that have seen the episodes on tv are blown away by how incredible the blu-ray picture is.  A perfect combination of eye-popping color, masterful cinematography, conceptual simplicity.

My only grief, and it is a major one, has nothing to do with the program, but the Planet Earth packaging really grips discs 1 and 4 tight.  The first time I tried to remove disc 4 from the case, without any undue amount of pressure, the disc snapped in half.  It seems in the feedback that this has happened to several others also.  Luckily for me Amazon replaced my set and this problem must not have gone unnoticed by the manufacturer because the interior packaging was slightly different and less troublesome in the replacement (now having 2 double-sided flaps inside instead of 1 flap and a nub on either side of the cover).  Either way, these discs are a gem, so take care with them.",1243123200,10,1442,4.554263565891473

4884752,5,B005SH62C0,"As I had read in reviews before purchasing this box set, the Planet Earth discs are, indeed, packed in their box very tightly. I don't know what genius came up with that particular four-disc layout, but it was rather difficult to work with - at first it wouldn't let the discs go, now it barely holds them in place.

But aside from that technical difficulty:
Fantastic images of Earth that most of us will never live to see.
Presented in incredibly beautiful high definition.
Excellent narrators (especially David Attenborough).

If you like documentaries, or if you have the patience to try one, there's no better way to start - I'm on my third chapter of Wild China right now and my roommate has started watching them with me just because the images and accompanying soundtrack are so amazing.

If you're reading this review, then you're probably interested - buy this set, you won't regret it. Also, if you don't have a 46""+ HDTV with 1080p resolution, add one of those to your cart as well - the realism is incredible.",1240185600,2,1022,4.666666666666667

I am writing about about the terrible flaw in the Planet Earth blu-ray package itself.  Discs 1 and 4 are not easily removed.  The middle push button isn't pushable at all!  I snapped Disc 4 because I struggled to remove it from the container.  After getting a replacement from Amazon, I tried to be even more careful the second time around.  Again, I snapped Disc 4 of Planet Earth.

4884783,5,B005SH62C0,"""Planet Earth"" has stunning photography, a fascinating commentary, and a myriad of sights most human beings have never witnessed before.
 I have one major complaint with the series however. It could be labeled as a horror series and called ""the Deadly Predators."" Throughout the series too much emphasis is placed upon one species preying upon another. We all know that it's a violent world out there. It's survival of the fittest, tooth and fang.
 The creators of the series use predation as a means of building suspense and creating hype. A certain degree of predators versus hapless victims would be fitting and completely natural, but I think the creators give too much emphasis to the predators. It's a lopsided view and reinforces the underlying basis for human aggressiveness through constant portrayal of victimization in nature.
 It's a dangerous, ornery natural world out there full of enemies. But there is also another view of the natural world which should be emphasized: animals caring for each other, parents rearing their offspring, of species living symbiotically together, species living in harmony.
 It's easier and perhaps more entertaining to present the violence, the graphic killing of one species by another, the strong over the weak.
 This series shows disharmony and violence in nature to the exclusion of other attributes. I think children will be frightened by some of the natural horrors we see as predators attack, kill and devour. Too much is made of the chase, of the hunt. There are some very grisly sights. I think the films play too much to the hunting skills of animal life.
 The series has brilliant innovative camera work. It's full of interesting and valuable information and insights. Arresting images abound especially when you see it in Blu-Ray. I highly recommend it. It has about nine hours of great viewing.",1231113600,12,1852,5.095709570957096
