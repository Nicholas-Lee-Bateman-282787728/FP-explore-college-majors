3113340,1,B0013K2ZG8,"This is a terrible movie, don't waste your money, it's not even a little funny......... If this movie was free I still would not waste my time watching it.....",1320883200,4,159,4.517241379310345
3113341,1,B0013K2ZG8,"I do not know what most of these reviewers are talking about. this movie is horrible. from reading the reviews you would think this movie would be funny, but sadly there are very few parts that made me and my friends laugh. and we were even drunk at the time.

spoiler warning!!!!!!!!: the movie is based around three different groups of people. a nerd, his girl and his brother/ three hot girls that are sluts/ and three guys that try to be cool but are not. as you probably cna tell the directors should have cut the whole part with the nerds because it was just predictable and stupid. the nerd did not even make a believeable nerd. the only funny thing about them was his brothers shirt at the party.

you would think that the three guy group would hook up with the sluts. truth is there is no sex between the two groups and no nudity. super fail to be a coming of age comedy. its R rating is only because of implied underage drinking, drug use, and language. every character is under developed and in the end they all are worse off then they were at the begining.

their idea of funny is to have a sceen where one of the guys finds out that his girl friend cheated on him with anouther guy. then she proceeds to cry for 10 mins with her friends while he goes out and fights the kid. the directors decided that they should make all of this serious.

also one of the guys is a drug dealer and punches a retarded druggy kid in the face. this kid sells him hard drugs, not just weed, then punches him in the face because he went to his party.

now every coming of age movie has that sad part towards the end before everything works out. this ones sad ending last for almost 20 mins were there is even a part where one of the guys parents is crying. BTW that doesnt get solved.

all in all this movie is horrible and i don't mean that in a good way. the characters all showed alittle potential in the beguining but then the writers never developed them.

there is one sceen in that movie that is funny. the liqour store sceen is priceless. but don't buy this movie, don't rent it and for god sakes don't pay 20 dollars for it. i got mine under 5 after shipping and i already regret that.",1283299200,14,2187,4.205250596658711
3113342,2,B0013K2ZG8,This was a low budget movie. The actors did not quite fit their roles. Some of the guy actors were in a role that they could not get woman but their looks would say other wise. Premise was good but it was hard to get into.,1245888000,,222,3.847826086956522

3113344,5,B0013K2ZG8,"I loved this movie, it took me right back to my high school days.  The writing is witty and poignant, it had me laughing the whole way through. The acting is great I can definitely see some potential stars coming from this movie.  Pick this movie up today you will be greatly entertained.",1209600000,6,288,4.415094339622642
3113345,5,B0013K2ZG8,Essentially this movie is a hiarious teen comedy. it's really funny and has an awesome cast and sweet music.  i actually was surprised how much i like it.  so so many classic scenes!  i keep laughing remembering different parts.  like a john hughes movie,1207699200,7,254,4.704545454545454
