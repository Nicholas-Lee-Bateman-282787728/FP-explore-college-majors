8679507,5,B00NODKYWE,"Cute love story/romance based on the manga and anime with identical title. The movie was filmed in 2014 after the anime release.

Disc specs:

Japanese audio,
Optional Japanese subtitles,
Extras - 2 trailers and a photo insert inside the case,
This edition is a single disc.

I recommend watching this, but only if you either speak Japanese or if you know the plot from the manga/anime. There is a lot of dialog in this film, so you need to know the plot prior to viewing. Since I know both manga and anime I was able to follow up without understanding Japanese. The music was good, too - mostly classic and quiet, the ending theme was an English song. I have purchased this on amazon.co.jp, was $5 less and arrived in 3 days from Japan!

The plot stays close to the manga and anime, but being much shorter they had to leave a few parts out. The most significant parts missing are the cats, you only see Mei's mother briefly, and Yamato's family is not mentioned at all. The rest is there, just shorter. Happy viewing!",1467158400,,1030,4.497326203208556
