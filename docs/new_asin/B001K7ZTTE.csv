8591142,1,B001K7ZTTE,"A little confused after buying the entire series of these DVDs. I thought they were going to be from master tapes or really good quality. Turns out, these are just from all the usual tapes circulating in the wrestling trade community. Nothing new here. Really disappointed. I already had most of it in much better quality from a different, independent website outside of Amazon.  Seems this stuff was copied. Good Luck Memphis Lovers.",1287273600,,434,4.945205479452055
