8363553,1,B0009X580A,Do not buy this dvd! It is a total ripoff! It says on the case and even on Amazon.com that it contains two movies The Inside Man(1984) and The Mind Snatchers. I bought this dvd double feature for the Mind Snatchers only. Guess what? Only The Inside Man was on this disc! It has The Inside Man title printed on one side of the disc and the Mind Snatchers on the other. I tried playing both sides of the dvd and even put it through my dvd ripping software. Only The Inside Man is what is on this disc! I cannot and will not recommend this title to anyone wanting The Mind Snatchers! I suggest buying The Mind Snatchers on a dvd by itself to avoid this!,1394236800,,650,4.125984251968504
