8387335,2,B00325YVWI,"I ordered the film to look at B-52 missions including SEA and Nuclear Alert.  What I got was a brief history of the Tuskhege Airmen.  It was interesting and well done and informative.  The film should have been entitled a history of the Tuskhege Airmen with a few B-52 pictures thrown in.
The H model was not used in SEA but was an important factor in the Cold War.

8387336,3,B00325YVWI,Decent video but it could have used more info on the air bases around the Great Lakes and other SAC bases.,1391558400,,106,4.095238095238095
8387337,5,B00325YVWI,I like history of the Cold War since I am a Cold War Veteran. I used to watch the B-52s and the KC -135 tankers fly over my father-in-law's cottage on Cedar Lake.,1361059200,,162,3.9393939393939394
8387338,5,B00325YVWI,"I spent many years keeping these great bombers, ready to deliver there war heads to where ever needed, this video
I think outshines any info I ever found about the B-52. Reading the review posted about WAC's ? the book is not
Wac's, or air bases, its about the B-52. For anyone interested in that great bomber, get the video. Great memories
for me.",1355702400,,348,4.453125
8387339,2,B00325YVWI,"I purchased this item as the operator of a museum of Michigan military history with hopes it might give me some insight to help build a display on Michigan's airbases.  It did not.
The video has no flow, it is neither geographic nor chronological, and it just wanders around and seems to be more of an infomercial on the B-52 than a story of Michigan's bases.
The historic footage is limited and not well identified; much of the film is inside a B-52. They talk about Willow Run bomber plant, but never mention the attached air base and school, they briefly mention Romulus Army Air field, but omit the role it played with the WAC's, and the actual stories of the bases it does talk about are limited.
There is a nice section on the Tuskegee Airmen, but it strays from the Michigan story and wanders into the ETO.
All in all a disappointing film, it tried to tell too many stories and lost sight of it's purpose.",1303084800,3,912,4.428571428571429
