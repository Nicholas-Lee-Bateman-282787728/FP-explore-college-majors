4987996,4,B006H11O5Q,"""I just wanted the glow. The one that they promise you on the cover of those magazines. Well, I'm calling it - pregnancy sucks. Making a human being is really hard. I have no control over my body or my emotions."" This is a movie based off the famous book and deals with five different couples and how they handle pregnancy ranging from problems trying to adopt to having a sickeningly easy time giving birth. This is yet another movie dealing with many different couples and relationship problems but this is one of the better ones. I have said before that I am not really a fan of this type of genre but I really enjoyed this movie and laughed throughout. It may be because I have a kid and went through the whole pregnancy thing with my wife but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. I am also really shocked at my favorite movies of the last few weeks. I have really enjoyed ""Think Like A Man"" and ""Five-Year Engagement"" and once again I think this ""chick-flick"" is the best movie of the week. I am not sure what that says about me but there are some really funny parts in this and if you are a woman do not be afraid about bringing this home to your man, he may throw a fit at first but the comedy (and Cameron Diaz's opening dance scene) will keep him watching and he will also enjoy it. I know I did...the dance was amazing though. Overall, a surprisingly funny movie that really won me over and I thought that was great. I (again surprisingly) give this an A.",1347321600,52,1478,4.263345195729538
4987997,5,B006H11O5Q,"This is hilarious! After having one kid and with another on the way I can say that this movie is right on the money. They were somehow able to capture the funny and sometimes disgusting aspects of pregnancy without cheapening the miracle of having a baby. They show Cameron Diaz as the celebrity pregnancy, Jennifer Lopez vying for adoption, Brooklyn Decker as the trophy wife having twins, Anna Kendrick ""Rosie"" as the one night stand, and Elizabeth Banks with the super-planned pregnancy. When I first saw the trailer for the movie I laughed until I cried, and now having seen the movie, I am not disappointed. P.S. It's a husband friendly movie - mine sure enjoyed it.",1346630400,56,671,4.743589743589744
4987998,3,B006H11O5Q,"As in 2 other recent movies including ""Twelve"" all duds at boxoffice, chace crawford proves once and for all he is poison at the boxoffice",1346630400,,138,4.56
4987999,1,B006H11O5Q,"this movie is really bad, extremely boring.

A few funny parts, not that many though.  Some crude language too.

I would save yourself the time, skip this movie.",1346457600,6,161,4.678571428571429
4988000,5,B006H11O5Q,This was a great and funny movie! My wife loved it so much because she is pregnant right now! Would recommend to anyone!,1346284800,2,120,4.260869565217392
4988001,5,B006H11O5Q,"This movie is the perfect example of what it is like to be pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or decide on adoption. Everyone is dealing with it in their own ways.  You will laugh, cry, and cheer during this movie.  And Wendy and Gary are so funny!  You won't be disappointed.  And no, it's not about the book.  How boring would that be??",1344643200,,337,4.285714285714286
4988002,4,B006H11O5Q,"This is a rom-com that features several different couples on their way to parenthood. They all deal with it in a different manner, but all seem to find a way to inject humor into their lives. A strong cast highlights this one, and it does successfully combine good comedy with the drama that relationships always bring, and should keep the audience entertained. There are plenty of attractive people in the cast, providing an appeal for both genders. All in all, I received about what I expected here, a solid movie with beautiful people, laughs, and realistic dramatic moments.",1340841600,3,578,4.908163265306122
4988003,3,B006H11O5Q,"There were some funny moments in this film and many women will be able to relate to the scenarios presented.  It was neat how each character's story was interwoven and played out in real-time along with the other characters' stories.

The film seems to be an advertisement to have babies, and more babies, and more babies. At least one couple adopts!!!

The last half hour of the film consists of the characters swooning over their babies and the comedy went right out the window.",1338768000,,480,4.690476190476191
4988004,5,B006H11O5Q,"Several couples are in love and experiencing pregnancy for the first time, other couples are sharing their fertility issues, and some discuss adoption. But, as far as the Topics of discussion are concerned, there are Many. Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Lopez play their roles well, and Chris Rock is extremely funny as he plays one of the Top Dudes. The cast of characters perform at their best and there are heartfelt moments as well as bundles of laughter. This movie, inspired by the Best-Selling pregnancy book is not only about the trials-and-tribulations of pregnancy, but also include many other issues to ponder and many viewers can relate, such as 9 months of waiting for the big day to come and how labor may feel. The guys are great at how to bond with your baby, and other baby issues. Highly recommended to romantic comedy lovers and for all those who wish to seek information from the pros who will share the famous saying, Been There And Done That! Overall, interesting and very funny, including the mood-swings!",1338422400,7,1023,4.818181818181818
4988005,3,B006H11O5Q,"I understand this movie is inspired by the best-selling pregnancy book, but it's very different. The book itself is only shown twice in the whole movie. There were some cute funny moments, and sad heart-breaking moments. My favorite performance was Elizabeth Banks as Wendy. Her portrayal seemed the most accurate. Anna Kendrick as Rosie was pretty depressing. Jennifer Lopez as Holly was tender-hearted. She is unable to conceive and adopts an Ethiopian child. Cameron Diaz as Jules was nothing too special. She is a celebrity host of a weight-loss show. Holly's husband, Alex isn't sure if he's ready to become a parent, so they send him to the Dude's Group. If you like romantic comedies and baby stories, you might enjoy WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN YOU'RE EXPECTING!!!",1337731200,,764,5.0236220472440944

4988007,5,B006H11O5Q,"I love this movie and just bought it streaming. I usually hate romance type films, but for some reason this one is different and it's also humorous (not really laugh out loud funny, but funny nonetheless). It only has a 5.7 on IMDB, and I find that just really sad.",1522454400,,265,4.32

4988010,5,B006H11O5Q,This is one of my favorite movies to watch over and over again. As I get ready for my own 1st pregnancy it helps me to connect with all the different expectant mothers in the movie and it helps me prepare for what's to come while I laugh about it. This movie is so funny and real and I love it.,1521504000,,294,3.8360655737704916
4988011,2,B006H11O5Q,"My wife was pretty offended that the super ""tubbed"" out women was still super hot (she is 8 moths pregnant and pretty slim). Other than that it was just not that great.",1520985600,,168,4.28125

4988015,5,B006H11O5Q,Hysterical movie. I just had a baby and I am 43 and I laughed so hard at some of the funny jokes that only a couple experiencing pregnancy and babies can understand. I watched it twice back to back and I plan on getting my husband to watch it with me. Highly recommend for its light hearted comedy and love of kids and family,1519257600,,325,4.09375

8497956,5,B006H11O5Q,"Loooved this movie. As someone who has been through infertility, fertility treatments, pregnancy loss, the adoption process, and ultimately pregnancy and child birth - this movie touched on it all in a touching yet humorous way (yes its possible apparently). The cast is superb and the dialogue is well-written. If you are pregnant, a new parent, or traveling an alternate path to parenthood, this should hit you right in the feels but still leave you smiling!",1526428800,,460,5.065789473684211
