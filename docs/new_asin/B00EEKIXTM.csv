8604801,2,B00EEKIXTM,"Dr. Cane (Jack Gould) secretly raises raptors on his quiet ranch, gathering up road kill. Alas, Dr. Cane can't seem to control the herd as one of them has eaten Abbi's mom while she was praying. Abbi (singer Jana ""cleavage"" Mashonee) leads a group of young adults away from the raptors, driving around in the Partridge Family bus.

The film created some colorful characters, but they were too shallow and lacked the needed dialouge to make the film interesting. Raptor special effects were fairly decent for a low budget film.

Film is about on scale for a made for TV flick. Jana Mashonee is gosh awful pretty in a set of Daisy Dukes and the only reason I would ever watch the film again.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs or nudity. Clothed sex scene with minor groping and raptor.",1387584000,,777,4.615942028985507
