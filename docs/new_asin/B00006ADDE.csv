1737648,3,B00006ADDE,"The original Sleepaway Camp is a classic. The sequel was humorous at best. It gives away all its secrets too early (like, I'm not spoiling anything; you literally learn these things at the very beginning of the movie), and from there on out it's just a silly, gory, slasher flick, minus the suspense. I get it, it's fun; I love horror/slasher/thriller/sci-fi movies as much as the rest. I just wasn't very impressed by this one.",1477958400,,428,4.72

1737697,5,B00006ADDE,Great movie if your a fan of slashers. Its kinda a parody of the classic slasher flicks and has a great camp slasher atmosphere. The gore effects are good and there are some original kills in it. Not as shocking as the first sleepaway camp but its well worth a watch. Also you don't have to have seen the first one to understand it at all. The important plot points are recapped in a great way within the first 10 minutes.,1477526400,,422,4.222222222222222

If your looking for a deeply dramatic and thrilling horror movie, then go watch Silence of the Lambs. If you're looking for a low budget cheaply written balance between Friday the 13th and Fast times at Ridgemont High then look no further. Campily dramatic horror with no deep thinking involved to enjoy it. I love it. But I say that, loving it for exactly what it is.....",1469404800,,515,4.548387096774194

1737815,4,B00006ADDE,Lots of people getting killed in sadistic ways. It's actually a pretty sick and messed up movie. It's over the top and pretty much the blueprint for a comedic slasher movie. If you know what you're getting into and like this sort of movie it's pretty entertaining. But it's not a serious slasher or horror movie. Take it for what it is and it's a lot of fun. If you don't want to see people getting senselessly murdered in terrible ways skip this one. It does have that 80's charm to it. 4/5.,1444176000,,492,4.301075268817204

1737818,3,B00006ADDE,"Yeah some of the actors were really bad and seemed intimidated by the camera, but not all were bad and the parts that did seem over exaggerated kinda made sense. The story stayed tight from the first film right up until the end of the series. For Angela's character though at times seemed insufficient was either brilliant on the directors part or really bad. I believe it was genius. She played crazy right. Mostly she didn't know she was crazy and by god she wanted a good camping experience without all the teenage bullsh*t and distractions. I do wish that she would have been just a bit more expressive and over the top with the crazy but her character was ahead of her time. There could have been a bit more tension and suspense building up to the kill seen, but so what that doesn't take away from the film if you realize what your watching. Angela is the star  she is not a typical slasher and this was not a spoof film as the TV description would have you believe.

This was a dark comedy straight out. It was about a girl obsessed with kumbiya's and s'mores and games and camping with other respectable people but never getting to have that because everyone around her was miserably selfish and disruptive. It was really closer to the modern horror/comedy than an 80's spoof. This is gonna be a bad film if you go into it thinking you will experience jaw clinching suspense and big scares and sh*t. If you go in realizing that your watching a classic cult film about a disturbed young lady that just happens to kill the other campers for not playing along the right way and just absorb the fact that she is skipping and whistling while she is bashing peoples heads in, setting tents on fire in the same frame of mind as when she is singing and fishing and every other normal camp activity then I think more people will see this film as real classic that was ahead of its time.",1438646400,2,1885,4.413793103448276

1737821,5,B00006ADDE,"Sleepaway Camp 2 takes place 5 years after the events of the first Sleepaway Camp. Angela Baker has been released from the funny farm and is now working at a new camp as camp counselor, Angela Johnson. Unlike the first movie, Angela (now being portrayed by Pamela Springsteen) is now much more talkative and is seen as a nosy, overbearing, overly-moralistic camp counselor. She's constantly lecturing the campers on moral behavior, threatens to report bad campers to the head of the camp; Uncle John, and despises anyone she sees as degenerative, an alcoholic, a drug/sex addict, or rebellious.

The film opens with one of the female campers, Phoebe, telling a story about the events of the first Sleepaway Camp and the killings that took place at Camp Arawak. She's interrupted by Angela who orders her back to her cabin on the on the other side of the campsite. During their way back, they get into an argument in the woods, causing Phoebe to run off and get lost only to be attacked by Angela who beats her with a log before cutting her tongue out for ""telling scary camp stories"".

From there Angela leaves a blood trail around the camp, killing off campers--male and female that she considers immoral and degenerative lowlife scum. She usually covers up her murders by claiming she ""sent home"" the campers for bad behavior to justify their absence in the event anyone asks for their whereabouts. As the rate of missing campers rises and rises; Angela's best friend Molly, male camp counselor, T.C., and Uncle John begin to piece the truth together

Overall: My only bone to pick with Sleepaway Camp 2 is the absence of Felissa Rose, who played as the cutely adorable Angela Baker in the first Sleepaway Camp. Word has it that she was originally planned to be be in the sequel but was busy going to college and turned down the offer. Who do we get as a replacement? Pamela Springsteen, who's way less cute than Felissa but she knows how to play a damn good psycho villain. Unlike the first film though, Sleepaway Camp 2 decides to get its hands dirty and really play around with the slasher genre that was blazing hot in the 80s. If you're a fan of 80s slasher films, this has everything to suit your needs. Stupid teenagers doing things they shouldn't? Check! Lots of blood? Check! Sex scenes? Check! Hot topless girls exposing their milk jugs? Check! Because this is an ordinary 80s slasher, the plot is fairly simple to follow. Psychotic, heartless killer picks off stupid, bratty, virginless, horny, sex addicted kids one by one. Aside from maybe 2 or 3 particulars in this movie, its hard to feel bad for most of the characters killed in the movie. Each character offers up a good performance, but Springsteen really absorbs the characters as the demented camp counselor that is Angela. It's also worth mentioning that Brian Patrick Clarke, who plays the role of T.C., looks strikingly similar to Dave Coulier. Seriously those guys could've been twins back then. Overall, Sleepaway Camp 2 is a fun and exciting movie that defines what a slasher film (at least an 80s one) is all about. Cheesiness, gore, sex scenes, and lots and lots of boobs!",1437868800,,3152,4.737704918032787

1737823,5,B00006ADDE,Ok first of its more of a dark comedy and I like the fact that the characters names are from the brat pack you don't know what the brat pack is look it up. Don't make Angela mad because she will punish you severely glad to see all 3 of these movies getting the blu-treatment. The kills are cool who can't for get Ally where was she when I was at camp. It would have been nice if the could have done more interviews from the cast like Pamela Springsteen.,1435622400,,453,4.044444444444444

Is just stupid. Angela runs around camp as a counselor, this time killing off her wards one by one. How does she explain their abrupt disappearance, she says she sent them home for bad behavior, lol. What?!? And the main counselor buys this, lol. Stupid. The only thing this had going for it is a ton more gore then original and a couple of good nude sex scenes but Im not even sure its worth sitting through that because of how stupid it is.",1435190400,,475,4.288888888888889

Having seen all the SC movies, I've always found them to be amusing - well, with the exception of SC IV: The Survivor, which is simply comprised of 90% archived footage from previous SC films - and strangely compelling. SC II seems, to me, to be the most kill-focused of all the films (meaning, the one most geared towards focusing on the kills as the driving plot element).

In speaking with my friends - also fellow horror geeks - there seems to be a strong love-hate relationship with these films. Either you ""get"" em, and enjoy them for what they are, or you think they're the worst thing since the birth of the first Kardashian.

1737938,4,B00006ADDE,"Felissa Rose is a pretty decent actress and her mysterious shyness made the first Sleepaway Camp movie watchable, but exchanging her with Pamela Springsteen was *definitely* the best move the writers could make.  Pamela's just better in my opinion.  She's friendlier, more encouraging to have a summer with nonstop fun and excitement, and welcomes the campers in a more deceiving kind of way where you'd never guess she's the one responsible for their eventual deaths.  Heck, if I met her, she'd even be able to trick *me* into thinking she's actually a believable happy go lucky camper!  It's just hilarious the way Pamela's character seems obsessed with the good-hearted outdoor lifestyle of nature and camping, only to end up killing the ones that fornicate, enjoy drugs and drinking, and have filthy swearing mouths.

In Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers, Pamela Springsteen's especially gruesome.  For me, when it comes to horror it has to come down to how awesome and creative the actual murders are, and the ones in this film are probably better than the ones in the first and third Sleepaway Camp movies.  A horror movie simply needs to show viewers all the unique ways to murder people despite how vicious, raw and compassionless they may seem.

I absolutely LOVE the one where the sassy blonde-haired cheerleader type gets stabbed in the back by a knife and then shoved down a poopy, fly-infested toilet in the outhouse.  Just a beautiful conclusion for such a disrespectable person.  Of course there's always that one girl that the bad guy doesn't really *want* to kill so she's always the last one to die (or become the hero) and the girl who plays this role does a magnificent job in that regard.  She doesn't want to kill Pamela until she reaches that point where she's forced to defend herself.

This movie truthfully has more nudity and sex than the other ones in the series.  Lots of breasts and sexual segments.  Hey no *wonder* Pamela Springsteen is exceptionally murderous this time around, haha.  Of course the low budget acting and poorly exeucted smacks and clobbers of sticks knocking people to the ground have remained.  These segments are forgiveable in this case however, because it's hilarious how obvious these characters aren't getting anywhere *close* to taking a hit in the film but yet, they play like it was a devastating blow, haha.  Gotta love it!  Really bad, but, a trademark of sorts for the Sleepaway Camp series.

Overall, highly recommend to all horror lovers.",1365638400,,2503,4.930787589498807

1737941,4,B00006ADDE,"First things first: if you haven't seen the original Sleepaway Camp, stop reading anything about this sequel and go watch its predecessor.  It's all but impossible to talk about this movie without giving something away about the original, and - believe you me - you do not want to spoil one of the greatest endings in cinematic history.  That being said, Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers greatly exceeded my expectations.  I think the filmmakers knew they could never even come close to shocking the audience this time around - and so they chose not to try.  From the word Go, there's no mystery as to the identity of the killer in this one, and so the filmmakers concentrated on delivering plenty of nasty slayings instead.

Five years and one operation since turning Camp Arawak into a bloodbath, our killer has been deemed ""cured"" and released back into society.  Now the killer has landed a job as - of all things - a summer camp counselor at Rolling Hills, a summer camp located some sixty miles away from the now-defunct Camp Arawak.  Apparently, she had very good references - supposedly from the very quacks that let her out of the mental institution in the first place.  Well, you don't have to be Kojak to figure out that nothing good is going to come out of this situation.

Kids soon start disappearing - or, as the killer puts it - are ""sent home.""  These are all ""bad kids"" that the killer catches engaging in acts she doesn't approve of.  Of course, these same activities are the very ones that are going to happen at any youth summer camp: sneaking out at night to play pranks or hook up with someone of the opposite sex, drinking, using bad language, and pretty much any other type of rule-breaking on the books.  Fortunately, the hottest babe there somehow manages to make it through a good chunk of the film, despite her exhibitionist nature and sexual proclivities.

As for our killer (played by Bruce Springsteen's littler sister Pamela), she is Miss Happy Camper when she's not torturing and killing people, so no one suspects her of doing anything wrong.  Despite that much-ballyhooed ""cure,"" though, she is more sadistic and dangerous than ever before, executing kids in all kinds of ""that ain't the way I want to go"" ways.  Sometimes, she has to resort to boring killing techniques like strangulation, but she does some pretty nasty things when time is not an issue.  That, plus her disturbing manic-depressive mood swings, makes this film a pretty darn good sequel to the original.  I do wish we could have been up close and personal for more of the killings instead of having to rely on gory shots of the immediate aftermath, but what are you gonna do?  At least the director had no qualms about showing naked hotties.",1345075200,,2747,4.69937369519833

1737943,1,B00006ADDE,"<strong>Sleepaway Camp 2: Unhappy Campers</strong> (Michael A. Simpson, 1988)

I realized roughly five minutes into <em>Unhappy Campers</em> that I'd seen it before, but when I went through the spreadsheet and the reviews, I can't see where I ever actually wrote anything about it. Thus, I soldiered on into a second trip through a movie so depressingly bad that by the end of it, I almost appreciated the first one.

It's five years after the events in the first film. Angela, who has now changed her name to Angela Johnson, has undergone years of therapy, plus the odd surgery here and there, and has emerged fully transformed. Or so the doctors, think, anyway, and they've sent her off into the world with a raft of recommendations. So she gets a job... as a camp counselor. (Felissa Rose, by the by, was off attending college when this film was made, so casing director Shay Griffin grabbed Pamela Springsteen, whose fifteen minutes of fame were in <em>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</em> six years previous. And yes, she's Bruce's little sister.) We learn in the first scene that Angela, of course, is not transformed at all; when she finds a camper who's not her definition of a good kid, well, off with their head. (Or tongue. Or whatever.) After which she reports back to Uncle John (<em>The African Queen</em>'s Walter Botell, the first of a few ""how far the mighty have fallen"" names who crop up in the second and third films in the franchise), the camp's owner/manager/something, that she has sent the camper home. Which leads to a lot of running ""I hate it here, I wish Angela would send <em>me</em> home!"" jokes.

Yes, unlike the first film--which played the horror angle straight--<em>Unhappy Campers</em> is meant as a comedy, and normally that would make it marginally bearable. But the acting isn't that much better here than it was in the first film, especially given some of the names surrounding it (Molly, a camper who befriends Angela early in the film, is played by Renee Estevez, Martin Sheen's daughter; the head counselor is played by <em>Eight Is Enough</em> veteran Brian Patrick Clarke, etc.), and the entire premise of the film rests on an absurdity one of the characters mentions in passing about not being able to remember the name of the psycho killer who cut a swath through all those campers five years ago. As if anyone ever forgets the name of an iconic serial killer. There are a couple of gruesomely amusing deaths, but it's still bad, bad, bad, and I say that as a diehard lover of B horror flicks. *",1307664000,,2538,4.776765375854214

1737965,1,B00006ADDE,"The original ""Sleepaway Camp"", though no horror masterpiece, at least had some fun performances from the bitchy Judy and Meg, some amusing dialogue from the potty-mouthed brother, creative kills, the progressiveness of the father having a boyfriend and the aunt seeming like a drag queen, and the shock ending.

This 1988 followup ""Sleepaway Camp 2"" has none of the above. In fact, it's just a bad script with no suspense, since we know who the killer is from the get-go. There seems to be four times as many counselors at the camp than there are kids to look after.

The female nudity comes from mostly one character, the resident slut. At least her death in the outhouse toilet was somewhat original.

**WARNING: Do not purchase the version from Legacy Entertainment**

Although I found it for $4 in a bargain bin, it still wasn't worth it. I could live with the fact that it looked like a full-frame transfer from VHS but the audio mix was so mangled I could not make out what the actors were saying during many of the outdoor scenes and Mess Hall scenes. Their lips are moving but all you hear is the cutlery scraping plates, or birds chirping outdoors. It was the worst audio of any DVD I've seen.

Also, I believe this was an edited version because the gore was non-existent. Right after the killer raised their weapon, the camera cut to the next scene. Stay away from this verion from Legacy. The film may have played a little better for me without these issues.

One star goes for some tacky but amusing dialogue I WAS able to hear, and the bad 1988 fashions (I've never seen so many mullets in one place at one time!).

Recognizable faces in the cast were Renee Estevez (Emilio's sis) and Brian Patrick Clarke (Susan Richardson's hubby 'Merle the Pearl' from ""Eight is Enough"").

Thankfully brief with only an 80 minute running time, SC2 is one of those movies that is worth watching only so you can poke fun at how stupid it is.",1296345600,,1938,4.58092485549133

This is the typical story of a camp in the woods with a killer on the loose, much like Friday the 13th, but it has its elements of comedy and Angela can certainly get creative with how to punish the campers and the bad counselors.  The third Sleepaway camp also has its great elements, pitting up-town snot kids with children from gangs and ghettos .. Definitely amusing with Pamela Springsteen as well.  The best two simply because of her I think.  Of course, you should certainly start with the original, and Return to Sleepaway Camp is worth the hour or so.

Now, Camp Rolling Hills is about to become Camp Rolling Heads for any of the unlucky campers that decide to break the rules! Any shred of seriousness that may have been left over from the first film is traded in for gratuitous boobs, blood, and bad jokes in this campy sequel. Angela spends most of her time spouting out silly one-liners when she's not taking stabs at each of the major Horror franchises. Even though Felissa Rose is missed in the lead, Pamela Springsteen's cheery attitude makes her an excellent replacement as the transgendered terror. Angela torches two teens, drills another, drowns one in an outhouse, decapitates a few, and then dices up the rest with whatever other gardening tools she finds lying around. SLEEPAWAY CAMP 2 is a bloody good time with plenty of late-80's cheese to go around!

1737996,4,B00006ADDE,"I've gotten into the habit recently of watching horror movie sequels back-to-back and then reviewing them.  I thought perhaps I was being anti-social, so I recently watched all four SLEEPAWAY CAMPS on four consecutive dates with the same girl.  See?  I'm not antisocial.  Just weird.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepaway-Camp/dp/6305841985/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepaway Camp</a>&nbsp;-- The original movie is bizarre, to say the least.  After a mild opening in which most of a family is killed with a speedboat, the movie cuts to two children, Ricky and Angela, being shipped off to Camp Arawak by Angela's mom, a ludicrously spacy woman.  Angela, the surviving daughter from the movie's intro, appears to be mute.  Ricky dutifully cares for her throughout the movie.  Aside from an old black cook and a well-meaning but clueless counselor named Ronnie, the rest of the cast is almost entirely composed of mean, selfish, antagonistic people.  But, phew!  They start getting killed.

The first person to kick the bucket at camp is a lecherous cook who openly brags about his pedophilia.  He's not kidding, either.  When he is introduced to Angela during lunch, in his busy kitchen, the first thing he does is drag her into a supply closet with the intention of exposing himself (and probably more).  Later, he has a large tureen of boiling water dumped onto his head.  Zing!

The movie tries to make itself mysterious, but it's not hard to figure out who's doing the killing.  Every time Angela is picked on in some way, the person eventually bites it in some overly dramatic and silly deaths.  However, although the whodunit of it is not a big surprise, there's still a lot of mystery to the movie.  Specifically, my date and I wondered how it ever got made.  The budget appears to have been twenty dollars, and -- up to that point -- both of us claimed to never have seen such horrific acting.  It was a stupid, poorly contrived, horribly done film, and the writer/director, Robert Hiltzick, had dedicated the entire thing to his late mother, a woman the dedication describes as ""a doer.""

We couldn't stop laughing.  I don't think the film was meant to be so funny.  Maybe it was.  Maybe that's where the phrase ""campy"" came from.  Either way, we enjoyed ourselves.  Four (accidental?) stars.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepaway-Camp-II-Unhappy-Campers/dp/B00006ADDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepaway Camp II - Unhappy Campers</a>&nbsp;-- The very first thing that happens in this film: Angela (same character, different actress), is now a counselor at Camp Rolling Hills.  Within the first two minutes of the film, she bludgeons a female camper and then cuts out her tongue, punishment for sneaking over to the boy's camp and telling scary bonfire stories.  Angela, apparently, is like a camp chastity Nazi or something.  My date is disgusted and already regretting her decision.

It's obvious right away that this film is not only far more graphic and explicit (when the girls aren't topless and joking about their breasts, they are trying to get slutty with each other's boyfriends), but it is also not interested at all in suspense or drama.  Angela kills every single person without even a ""how do you do?""  That might sound like a spoiler, but this movie doesn't have any secrets or tricks up its sleeve.  A camp of sinners and sleazeballs gets sliced and diced.  The end.

There is a subplot concerning the two wholesomest kids in camp finding each other amidst all the devious tramps and the people being stabbed and drowned in outhouses, but these kids were apparently only halfsome, because, as I pointed out, they die along with everyone else.  But I guarantee you, I didn't ruin the movie for you.  No.  This movie is just another dumb, horribly written and directed film that is actually pretty funny.  Just as funny as the first one, though.

She is now on her way to Camp New Horizons, an ill-advised social experiment that forces juvenile delinquents and spoiled rich kids into tents together.  This place is run by a dangerously idiotic couple and seems to have little to no funding.  The only person with any degree of dignity is the camp's only counselor (!) a guy named Barney who is also an officer of the law AND the father of a camper who died in the previous film.

The dialogue and acting in this film make the first two look like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schindler-s-List/dp/B00012QM8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schindler's List</a>.  The characters make wild, irrational decisions.  People are despicable for no good reason, and Angela never struggles with finding the time, energy, and secrecy to dispatch of most of them.  She is aided by the fact that this camp, like the previous two, seems to have no schedule of events or basic supervision.  In fact, budget constraints must be lower than ever, because this time around the place appears to be run out of two woodsheds.  And yet, in the credits, there is this: Mr. Simpson's Porsche Provided by MEGDAL IMPORTS.  Mr. Simpsons is the director, and to the best of my knowledge, neither he nor his Porsche appear in the film.  Another horrible horror movie that we couldn't stop laughing at.

My date said that the acting was even worse than the first film.  She gave it two thumb up.  Me: Four stars.

NOTE: THERE IS APPARENTLY A FOURTH FILM SOMEWHERE OUT THERE.  I COULD NOT FIND IT, NOR KNOW ANYONE WHO IS WILLING TO VOUCH FOR ITS EXISTENCE.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Return-to-Sleepaway-Camp/dp/B001CT876C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Return to Sleepaway Camp</a>&nbsp;-- The creator, Hiltzik, was not responsible for parts 2 or 3.  They were the work of writer Fritz Gordon and director Michael Simpson.  For some wild reason, Hiltzik, who'd done NOTHING since the first film (according to iMDB), decided to make a REAL sequel to his first film.  This is it, a movie so absolutely awful in every way, I found it nothing short of mesmerizing and have watched it twice again since.

It's obvious that Hiltzik is catering to his fans, because the first death is almost identical to the first death in the first film: rude cook dies by hot liquid.  The head cook is, yet again, an elderly black man (Isaac Hayes who acts in every scene as if he has recently gone blind).  Muscley, dim-witted Ronnie is back as the head counselor.  Reprising his role from the original, Paul DeAngelo makes bad acting look like a fine art.  I'm not joking.  I could watch that guy overact for hours and hours.

The camp is run by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sopranos/dp/B001C3O6R2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sopranos</a>'s Vincent Pastore, and is once again filled with the most mean-spirited, vile children ever.  The kids are so rude and unruly, when they are punished for their misbehavior (by being sent to their cabins), I'm surprised they don't just hit the counselor with a rock.  The hammy acting will astound you.  The dialogue will baffle and delight.  Even the extras in this film are as weird and wooden as life-sized cardboard puppets.

The plot this time around is not very different at all.  One camper, a kid named Alan, is the butt of everyone's jokes, and those who taunt and tease him end up meeting grisly ends.  The thing is, Alan is the whiniest and most annoying movie character since Luke Skywalker.  Played with absolutely no consistency at all by Michael Gibney, Alan is the movie's most confusing character.  Does this boy have a mental disorder?  Is he schizophrenic?  Why does he love frogs so much?  Why doesn't he ever, ever, ever change his clothes?  Why is he such a jerk?

Yes.  Alan is just as annoying and mean as everyone else, and yet when the camp gangs up on him and shoots spit balls at him or yells at him to stop making flamethrowers out of lighters and spray cans, he starts complaining that everyone is picking on him because ""he's different.""  He chats with his brother about a mysterious ""fever.""  ""The doctor said there'd always be effects,"" Alan moans as he pets a frog.

It makes no sense.  Nor does the rest of the film.  The original actors who portrayed Ricky (Jonahan Tiersten) and Angela (Felissa Rose) reprise their roles here, which is a bit of a treat.  Tiersten has obviously done no acting since the first film.  He doesn't even bother looking interested, casually smoking a cigarette during a tense hunt in the woods for the bodies of slain children.  Rose isn't exactly recognizable for much of the film, but it won't be hard to know point her out after about ten minutes.  My date did it in twelve.

My date hated the film.  So did my neighbor, who refused to watch anymore after about thirty minutes.  But me?  I couldn't get enough.  It is, without question, the most hilariously awful film I've seen since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starship-Troopers/dp/B000OVLBHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starship Troopers</a>.  I chuckle now just thinking about it.

I see that Hiltzik has started production on a SLEEPAWAY CAMP REUNION.  Bravo, Mr. Hiltzik.  I doubt very much that you'll be able to top the inane silliness, the incomprehensibly horrible acting, the deliciously cheesy plot ""twists,"" but I'll be glad to watch you try.

1737997,5,B00006ADDE,"First of all, if you have not see Sleepaway Camp 1, than I advise you do not read this (or any other reviews of it's sequels - or the back of the DVDs - as there is no way to talk about them without giving away massive spoilers to the first movie). So please do not read this if you have not seen Sleepaway Camp.

Sleepaway Camp 2: Unhappy campers is a very good sequel to Sleepaway Camp, but it is also very different. Unhappy Campers is a camp horror movie, with as much comedy in it as horror. Also it was made by a different director and Angela is played by Pamela Springstein instead of Fellisa Rose. However, desite all of these changes, Sleepaway Camp 2 is still a brilliant movie and is not spolit at all by the changes made since the first.

The movie takes place five years after the first movie. Angela Baker (now nineteen) has been released from a mental institution, having had a sex change, and is now working as a camp counciler at Camp Rolling Hills. At first it seems that managed to put the events of Camp Arawack behind her, she is now confident and filled with innocent happyness. But we soon find out Angela has not quite moved on from from her old ways as ""Bad Campers"" - the one's who misbehave - are being ""sent home"" by Angela as one-by-one she kills them off in gruesome, inventive ways.

Truely one of the best slasher movie series ever. Angela is brilliant as a serial killer, she only kills bad people, most of her killings are very origional and she's is very witty at times.

I highly recomend this movie to fans of the slasher genre or anybody looking for a good movie.",1237507200,,1601,4.308970099667774

1738000,5,B00006ADDE,"This DVD set includes two Sleepaway Camp classics.

SLEEPAWAY CAMP 1 - Welcome to Camp Arawak where teenage boys and girls learn to experience the joys of nature as well as each other. But when these happy campers begin to die in a series of horrible accidents they discover that someone or something has turned this summer of fun into a vacation to dismember.
Has a dark secret returned from the camp's past... or will an unspeakable horror end the season forever?
From its grisly special effects to the truly shocking climax, SLEEPAWAY CAMP is no ordinary 'body count' movie. See for yourself why this killer thriller spawned two sequels and became one of the most surprising horror hits of the '80s!
What superficially appears to be an ordinary '80s horror flick is actually, upon deeper inspection, something much more bizarre. Hints of incest, transsexuality, and homoeroticism lie beneath the surface in this story of a summer camp where employees and campers start dropping like flies. History has lumped this into the HALLOWEEN/FRIDAY THE 13TH rip-off category, which is an oversight.

SLEEPAWAY CAMP 2 - Five years after the horrific slaughter at Camp Arawak, transgendered lunatic Angela Baker (a take-no-prisoners performance by Pamela Springsteen, whose singing and guitar playing would terrify even her brother Bruce) has become a counselor at Camp Rolling Hills. But Angela is about to teach 'bad campers' a brutal lesson in survival when these horny teens are sliced, stabbed, drilled, barbecued, chain sawed and worse. Rene Estevez (sister of Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen) co-stars in this outrageously vicious sequel to the original cult hit, filled with gratuitous nudity, rampant mullets, exclusive extras and gore galore.

I love the cover to this movie; it says the movie is fun and not to be taken serious-like all horror movies should be. Pamela Springsteen does a excellent job as Angela, she played a pyscho perfectly. Not over the top but she had the right mix and I enjoyed watching her kill off the campers. Highly entertaining film and I highly recommend it to slasher fans, you won't be disappointed.",1214265600,,472,4.436781609195402

And if you're a big fan of comedy-horror films, you're in luck. But it does have one common thread from the first film, which is the death scenes are pretty cool. My personal favorite is the ""crapper scene"", as I like to call it! As for the storyline, its really not that bad, but don't get your hopes up..there is no shocking ending like that of the first film. I'm just kinda disappointed that they chose to go in this direction after the first movie. I'm not a big fan of comedy-horror movies, especially when its a sequel to a more seriously made movie.

Before ""Scream"" parodied the slasher genre there was this movie with spoofs to ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Friday The 13th"".

1738018,4,B00006ADDE,"When I put this DVD in, I wasn't really expect much.  All I expected was a crappy sequel to a really great film, since alot of slasher sequels aren't that good.  Well, I was pleasantly suprised because what I got was a highly enjoyable late 80's horror cheesefest that all fans of corny slasher flicks can appreciate.

Basically, the plot revolves around a group of kids at a camp called Rolling Hills, which is apparently 60 miles from Arawak.  Well, it turnes out that Angela did her time at the mental hospital and has had a sex change operation (She used to be a boy) and is apparently ""cured"".  Haha.  Boy, were the counselors that hired her wrong.  Pretty soon, kids begin to start missing.  Angela claims that she's sent them home for behaving badly, when really, she's been brutally murdering them in painful, gruesome ways.  No one knows this, and of course, they believe her when she tells them she sent 'em home.  Well, when more and more kids keep getting ""sent home"", the camp counselors get suspicious and fire Angela.  Of course, Angela runs off into the forest and to the abandoned cabin where she likes to hang out.  One of the remaining teenagers decides that she wants to try and cheer her up, and grabs her boyfriend and has him help her.  Well, when they reach Angela's hangout spot, they soon find out her disgustingly horrible secret and now both of their lives are in danger.  Will they make it out alive?  Watch the movie and find out, damn it!

Well, there's a run-down of the main premise of this short, but incredibly entertaining bloodfest.  Now, the story is really quite absurd.  Wouldn't they check Angela's records or something before hiring her as a staff member?  In real life, yes, they would have and they would have NEVER have hired her...unless they were total and complete idiots, of course.  But, luckily, these counselors are idiots and we get to have a fun time watching Angela ""weed out the bad kids""!  The gore scenes in here weren't very graphic, but then again, the gore scenes weren't too graphic in the first one, either.  You see, they didn't NEED to be gorey!  And neither do the deaths in here!

Oh, and if you're looking for some T&A, there's plenty of it in here.  Right after the beginning credits, we see one of the young teenage girls topless because she says she likes to sleep in the nude.  And there's one that just likes to act like a complete [hooker]to impress her friends and the guys, and one of the best sex scenes ever filmed happens to be in here.  Yes, the sexual stuff is pretty pointless, but this is a SLASHER FILM.  Most slasher films have a little bit of nudity or sex in them, to attract their younger male target audience.  And of course, the girls are treated to a couple of muscular guys without any shirts on a couple of times.

The acting is pretty average in here, but it's better than the performances in the first film.  Pam Springsteen is amazing as Angela, and I personally think she's much much better than Felissa Rose.  I love the way she portrays our favorite transvestite serial killer.  When she murders, she doesn't think twice about it.  She just acts like it's some every day thing, and just...does it.  There's no other way to explain it, she just kills 'em.  Only a couple of the murders have build up to them, and yeah, I do wish there had been more build-up in this one like in the first, but oh well.  I still had a great time watching this, so that doesn't matter.

Overall, this isn't as good as the first one, but for some reason, it's far more entertaining.

Reccomended for a Saturday night rental.  Or you can just buy it if it's really really cheap, like I did.  Don't forget to pop a ton of popcorn to go with it!",1141862400,22,3720,4.468053491827638

It's the same girl/boy as in the first, except this one looks completely different, acts completely different, and is pretty much officially now a girl. Also, her last name is changed. ""Sleepaway Camp 2"", while it carries a zany tune throughout most of the film, gets a tad more darker during the last 15 minutes or so. And these last 15 minutes are rushed and poorly concieved, and are what brings the rating down. The ending is also a bit of a downer, because the ""last girl"", Molly, doesn't survive. And Molly was a pretty nice girl! I also couldin't help liking Angela. I know I shouldin't becuase shes the killer, but she really has a neat personality. On a final note, I am surprised at how popular the two ""Sleepawar Camp"" sequels are. Not that they aren't good, but they're just so different from the original movie.

No more are the shadows of people mocking her plaguing a 14-year old memories, to the point that the doctors running evaluations on her mental condition say that she's fine. In fact, according to her, she has some good recommendations from them in regard to finding work when she is released, so finding a job was fairly easy. And what's the best line of work for someone who's trying to avoid a relapse into the world of campground butchery that she plunged into not too terribly long ago? Why, as a camp councilor, of course! This, of course, leads down highways that are a little more graphic than the last installment in the Sleepaway saga, letting Angela wholeheartedly embrace the multitudes with her own special brand of love while working her way through the bad apples in the bunch.
Something I actually enjoyed in this movie was the mocking undertones of stereotypical campground behavior and the individuals haunting those abodes, not to mention the sing-a-long ""I'm a Happy Camper"" tune that still haunts the fine-tuned humming I inflict upon anyone that happens to be around. For these reasons as well as those that spell murder, unhappy endings, and an array of potential victims that grovel on the steps of age, class, and sex, I would have to recommend this movie. Besides, seeing Angela claim a foothold on Freddy, Jason, and Leatherface (only rip-offs and not the originals, but still) was entertaining, to say the least!",1042934400,10,2306,4.958656330749354
1738040,5,B00006ADDE,"Even though this movie is very low-budget and the acting is terrible, it is one of the best in its genre.  The lines are so funny, my friends and I recite them all the time! One of our favorites is from TC, the clueless male councelor: How's she gonna call me?  I don't have a phone!  The ""Happy Campers"" song is so fun to sing along to, time after time.  Although I found the original Sleepaway Camp very disturbing, this one is just humorous.  We stopped returning this video on time because we watched it so much, so I decided to buy it off Amazon.  So if you want a good laugh from a cheesy horror movie, Sleepaway Camp is your best bet.",1040515200,2,641,4.170731707317073
1738041,3,B00006ADDE,"SLEEPAWAY CAMP II - UNHAPPY CAMPERS in a defintely improvement over the original film.  Angela is back in full form, outrageously played by Pamela Sprinsteen (Bruce's sister) who takes a job as a counsellor at a nearby camp, seven years after the original film.  This films pays homage to Jason, Freddy and Leatherface as Angela uses those elements to stalk her victims.  This film blends in horror and comedy quite nicely and is a must see for fans of the genre.
This film contains a scene selection card and is presented for the first time in 1.85:1 widescreen.  The picture and sound quality are both good for a film that was made on a very low budget.

It has the lot sex, comedy, puzzles where i must of blamed everyone at least once as the killer. It mostly reminds me of the present day scream trilogy. this badly needs a D.V.D release, maybe as a box-set... my favourite death was when ondre and calvin were cut to bits and marshall slipped  on the grit while in persuit of the killa...
same again this movie is highly recommended to all fans of this genre.",1022457600,,497,4.287234042553192

IT IS A SLASHER FILM WITH A DIFFERENCE AND NOT TO BE TAKEN TOO SERIOUSLY.THE KILLER USES INVENTIVE WAYS TO MURDER HER VICTIMS AND THE FILM PROVIDES AN ADEQUATE PLOT TO KEEP HORROR FANS INTERESTED.I WOULD RECOMMENED THIS FILM TO ANY FAN OF SLASHER MOVIES AND I GUARANTEE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.MAKE SURE YOU GET THE FULL UNCUT VERSION.",1010534400,,643,4.551724137931035

But when she finds campers doing ""bad"" things,like doing drugs or playing pranks, she murders them! She lies and says she sent them home but later, people get suspicious. The result is a bloodbath! It's great because it's funny, and the killings are extremely creative! If you liked Sleepaway Camp 1, then your bound to like Sleepaway Camp 2!",1009497600,,426,4.77027027027027
1738066,3,B00006ADDE,"Ok well this is a pretty good movie for its time the acting is better than the first in the trilogy, which still in no way says alot about the acting in this film.
Well in this one Angela is older and a camp counsellor, so now she is in charge of the poor unfortunate kids and she is not letting anyone get away with anything.
This movie is great if you want some tacky one liners and to be scared witless (only of the acting), but all in all it is great to add to your collection :)There are also some references to Angela in the movie that to understand them you would have to see the 1st in the series where she is a kid at summer camp, no wonder she ends up the way she does from the way she was treated there as a kid.",1002499200,3,723,3.859060402684564
7966333,5,B00006ADDE,"Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers along with the original are by far one of the best and underated horror films of the 1980's  I know there are 4 in total.  But the first to have that something special.

The first with the ending nobody saw coming at all, even though after you see the first the second time arond it makes sense why she never went in the water or would get changed with the girls and how it was often brought up. Though not enough to give away the ""Crying Game"" Angela was a transgender girl murderer at the lake.  In part one.

This one following the same story, but five years later Angela's about 20yrs old. Now at a different camp as a counselor, resorting to her old way, pining those who are not following camp rules?

I love how part two is more campy, funny and throws scares at you as well. Its very intellengent. If you get some of the 80's references thrown in.",1524268800,,890,4.267857142857143
7966334,3,B00006ADDE,"This is probably the strongest in a series of pretty bad Friday the 13th rip offs. The killer from the first film returns to camp and kills anyone she doesn't get along with. Not much more to say. I enjoyed it more than the first one, third one and the 4th one if you can even consider that a movie, as well as the fifth one... overall as a series I don't really care it's being remade in 2018.",1509840000,,394,4.0

7966339,5,B00006ADDE,"In my opinion, this sequel to the 1983 slasher flick Sleepaway Camp ticks all the boxes for intentionally being a smart, and sophisticated horror / comedy. Plenty of gore, black humour and horny teenagers - not to be missed. Pamela Springsteen (Bruce's sister) shines as the main antagonist, Angela Barker who's main ""god given right"" is to rid the world of immoral teenagers, - a not to be missed film. I suggest you see the trilogy in order, from the original to ""Teenage Wasteland"" as the finale. Good fun- all 3 films, though part 1 and the following 2 are quite different in terms of stylised direction and maybe acting. Bill ""Splat"" Johnson supplies the gore - to bad final prints of Teenage Wasteland was cut to avoid an X- but you can check out all the gory footage on workprint / deleted footage.
