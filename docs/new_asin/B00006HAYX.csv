""A once in a millenium entertainment event.  Buju Banton rocks the house with a mind-bending performance featuring the Sagittarius Band, dancehall superstars Wayne Wonder, Super Beagle, Waggy T and Cool G.""

Young and naive, I bought this album back in 2002 without looking at the photos of a young Banton on the back.  The album cover features Buju Banton circa  '98, when his Inna Heights album came out.  This despite the fact that this DVD is concert footage from the Bahamas taken from some time around '91 or '92 when Gargamel was still in his late teens.  He was an amazing deejay even back then, and his raw energy and electrifying presence can definitely be felt.  If a quality DVD came out that featured the young Banton performing his hit tunes from the early nineties I would be all over that.  Unfortunately, this is not that DVD.

First of all, the sound and video quality are poor.  I don't know if it is the original recording equipment used, or if the transfer was just shoddy, but the sound is sometimes slightly muffled and I had lines and jumps on my screen a couple of times.  Secondly, the concert itself is far from ""a once in a millenium event.""  In fact, it was probably not even the best concert he had put on that month.  Thirdly, as someone else pointed out, Buju's set is only about twenty-five minutes.  While it is a quality set, it is not enough time to justify the purchase of this DVD.

The concert opens with selector Waggy T and hype man Kool G.  Waggy T was in his silent period at this point and settles on spinning some massive tunes while Kool G chats to the crowd.  Basically, there is a whole lot of shots of a the crowd dancing.  Unless you have a deep interest in early nineties Caribbean fashion or you have a relative in the crowd this part of the DVD is extremely boring.  Waggy T has some superb dubplates to play, but I would rather see a selector live.

Finally, after about twenty minutes, Super Beagle performs a very short set of about five to ten minutes.  I'm not familiar with his work beyond this DVD, but my sense is that, with autotune rampant in dancehall, he'd be a superstar if he came out now.  Next up is silky-voiced Wayne Wonder, who performs for about five minutes before Buju Banton comes out.  I can't remember the order of Buju's set, but he performs ""Man Fi Dead"", ""Love Black Womam"", ""Love Me Brownin'"", ""Movie Star"" with Wayne Wonder, ""Boom Bye Bye"", and, I think, ""Woman no Fret.""

I would simply love to see a DVD compiled featuring Buju's work after his conversion to Rastafari.  This DVD suffers from too many production and quality issues for me to recommend to anyone but the most fervent Buju fan. If you do purchase this, watch for the random white guy with huge glasses dancing in the audience and having trouble sipping from his straw while the camera is on him - very funny.",1301875200,,2880,4.481765834932822

The picture and sound quality are terrible and more than half of the video is people talking on stage.  Do not buy this.",1049155200,5,266,3.981132075471698

Despite being described as a ""retrospective"" look at Buju Banton, this is just an early concert recorded on a hand-held camcorder...bad sound, bad picture, BAD VIDEO. At least 75% is crowd shots and Buju is only onstage for about 20-25 minutes.",1038873600,13,288,4.78
