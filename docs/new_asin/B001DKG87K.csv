Richard Greene once again takes up the bow and brings to life the stories of this classic literary character featured in this entertaining program from the late 1950's. Robin Hood, Friar Tuck, Maid Marian and the rest of the Merry Men continue their efforts to thwart the forces of the Sheriff of Nottingham and bring hope to the citizens of Nottingham. Robin Hood and his fellow Sherwood Forest dwellers keep the faith their beloved King Richard will soon return and remove the evil Prince John from the throne to restore law and order to the land. Until that day comes, Robin and his men will continue to fight for that which is right and just.

3534531,4,B001DKG87K,I have 3 in this series and I have enjoyed watching all of them.  I would recommend the series to anyone.,1363478400,,105,4.0
3534532,5,B001DKG87K,"brings back memories  saw this as a kid and enjoyed it then, but as an adult seeing the humor i missed as a kid is great there is good tongue and cheek comments in the dialogue, the acting is very british but you go with it after a few episodes,  and the commercial in the beginning if each installment will bring back nostalgia , the story lines still hold up today and is  all new again, just a simpler enjoyable tv show",1336348800,,422,4.121951219512195
3534533,5,B001DKG87K,"We love this whole series.  The episodes are humorous, clever, and we have no problem watching them over and over.  The actors are recast in different roles in each episode in such a clever way that it does not detract from the show at all.  We have shared some of the seasons with our kids and grandkids.  They are wholesome for families, they have great messages, there is no indecency, and they have caused us to do a bit of research into King Richard and that era (he wasn't as noble as the series portrays).  But the series does promote right over wrong, and a sense of fairness in a world of opression and tyranny.  Forget Hunger Games - if you want great archery, get this series - we love all of the seasons.",1335052800,,716,4.3059701492537314
3534534,4,B001DKG87K,Great deal on a fun DVD.  We loved the first season and this one is just as good.  I hope the price will drop on season 3!,1314144000,,122,3.4814814814814814
3534535,5,B001DKG87K,"I was totally surprised by the quality of this television show, considering the era in which it was made. It is well acted, well casted, the costumes and props are awesome, and the storylines make the familiar characters all the more likeable than the Disney movie ever did. Some old advertisements are tagged on to some episodes, which only serves to make them better. This show is fantastic.",1312761600,,393,4.794117647058823
3534536,5,B001DKG87K,Love this series---you'll end up with everyone in the family singing the catchy little intro song.  It was also nice to see a program without cursing and an entertaining story in each episode.,1293753600,,192,4.818181818181818
3534537,3,B001DKG87K,"I didn't feel compelled to write a review of Robin Hood Season 2 but I thought it was necessary on account of a disc defect which really irks me.  The episode RANSOM on disc one stalls and pixillates near it's conclusion.  The subsequent ISABELLA also displays video/audio dropouts. I know it's not the fault of my DVD player because I purchased TWO sets of SEASON 2. This defect occurs at the exact place in each set. Alright, it wasn't a big monetary investment, but just the same it burns me up.  You can't play this disc in sequence. Rather you have to resort to unloading the disc, returning to the root menu, and forwarding to the next episode.  A REAL PAIN THIS.
In so far as the viewing quality is concerned, the transfers are generally clean and acceptable, but you can certainly tell these are second generation transfers.  Some segments show a high amount of contrast (which can wash out the middle tones). There is even some minor fluttering more typically found in VHS formats. Be that as it may, I certainly, do, however, enjoy the shows.  Richard Greene is superb as Robin Hood and a youthful Donald Pleasance also appears. The stories are self-contained, well written, entertaining and fun to watch, especially over a rainy weekend. Just wish MILL CREEK would have taken more care in the production of this set.",1275004800,,1327,4.698275862068965
3534538,5,B001DKG87K,great for the whole family and good to complete your set but the complete four year set can be found cheaper than piecing the four seasons together.,1264982400,,148,4.518518518518518
3534539,4,B001DKG87K,"The Second Season of Robin Hood looks very good on dvd.  I wish Millcreek had done such a steller job with the First Season.  Season Two's source material must be in considerably better condition than Season One's.  The quality is very nice; not as nice as MillCreeks release of Wanted:Dead or Alive (also available from Amazon), but certainly better than 99 percent of public domain releases out there.  The episodes look clean and stable, with very little age damage (unlike many of the episodes in Season One). The sound is perfectly fine, with little or no background hiss from age.  Highly recomended for fans of this early BBC TV series, and fans of Richard Greene.",1256428800,,671,4.8
3534540,5,B001DKG87K,"I enjoyed thid series so much in the original, but never realized at the time that this was not a sliphod production.  There are so many historical details such as: dress, mannerisms, music, social interactions that are dead-on, that I am amazed.  And the use of the interhangeabele sets is so well done, that it doesn't detract from the stories at all.  This, coupled with the quality of just about all of the recordings makes this series a delight to behold.",1242259200,,460,4.654320987654321
3534541,5,B001DKG87K,Great series I would highly recommend this to anyone.  Made back when shows were genuinely funny and entertaining.,1241395200,,114,5.333333333333333
3534542,5,B001DKG87K,I think the human is not changing very much only the tools and techniques. In Robin Hood the complete seasons also gives the same connotation. This is one of the first and the best classics to have some good time for you.,1241222400,,221,4.285714285714286
3534543,5,B001DKG87K,"I picked up season one at a discount store because I remembered the adventure I felt seeing the program as a child. Some of the programing I remember liking as a child, I find rather dated today. Not so with Richard Green's Robin Hood. I did not recall the acting was so good. This program is of much higher dramatic quality than we see today.",1236729600,,343,4.292307692307692
3534544,5,B001DKG87K,"This is a simple pleasure, one that keeps on giving. I bought it for my son, who loves it. The acting is broadly good, and the cast features many stalwarts of British theatre of the period. It's fun, for example, to see Donald Pleasance and Leo McKern in their youth, and Richard Greene stands out as the best Robin this side of Errol Flynn. Buy it, watch it, and of course you'll still find plenty of time to sing.

3534545,5,B001DKG87K,"I was shopping at WalMart one day and found Robin Hood Season 1 on the $5 rack.  I had never watched it before, but the price was right.  I don't have cable or even an antenna, so I thought it was worth the $5.  I loved it so much that I found Season 2 on Amazon.  I am very happy with both seasons and can't wait for the next ones to be released.  The quality leaves a bit to be desired, but the episodes are enjoyable.  There is no blood, profanity, sex, or anything like that.  It's just a wholesome show to watch.  I believe there are 39 episodes in each of the first two seasons, so it will keep you busy!",1234828800,2,610,3.942622950819672
3534546,3,B001DKG87K,It was nice to watcb one of my favorite shows of the 50's.  I am also looking forward to getting season 3 & 4 of Richard Greene's Robin Hood.,1234656000,,141,3.8620689655172415
3534547,4,B001DKG87K,"Anyone who loves Robin Hood will go for this series. I must have watched this when I was a kid. Even as an adult (and perenntial Robin Hood lover), I find these episodes not antiquated as some old TV shows might be these days. They are exciting, realistic, believable, great people in the parts, a handsome hero and beautiful heroine, short but sweet!!",1234051200,,352,4.603174603174603
3534548,3,B001DKG87K,"The product description says that it is in color, but it's not. I have the first season on dvd, in black and white of course, and I have a vhs movie which evidently is a colorized version of the first 2 0r 3 episodes put together and called The Adventures of Robin Hood - The Movie. The colorization is pretty good. The ""colors of Sherwood"" are definitly better when they're actually seen in green and red and brown, etc. Black and white is just too drab.",1233100800,,455,4.3023255813953485
3534549,5,B001DKG87K,"As an American kid this TV series was ten years before my time. I did have Howard Pyle's classic novel ""The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood"" in one of those Whitman books you could buy from a rack in the drug store. I thoroughly enjoyed reading that, but I have never seen any filmed versions of Robin Hood until now (not counting Mel Brooks' series ""When Things Were Rotten""). I was tempted to watch Kevin Costner's ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,"" but I never did because I suspected the story would be updated for modern prejudices much like Kevin Sorbo's ""Hercules,"" which one reviewer described as ""a surfer dude on his way to a Renaissance fair.""

When I bought the complete first season of the Richard Greene series for five bucks at Wal-Mart, I figured it would be fun, not knowing that I would be both surprised and amazed at the quality of the acting, the writing, and the way it was filmed. It really takes you back into a credible medaeval atmosphere. It may have once been considered a kid's show, but it surely has kept the adults entertained around our house! It also brought back pleasant memories of a time in our culture when writers took romantic heroism seriously, and didn't have to turn everything into tongue-in-cheek ""camp.""

In some circles today it is popular to dis Robin Hood as the world's first socialist, because he ""robbed from the rich to give to the poor."" If that were true he would be an evil man. But this TV series sets the record straight by showing that Robin was an avenger of the poor, who only took from the rich what they had previously stolen and returned it to its rightful owners.

And speaking of avengers, I was also a fan of the British television series ""The Avengers."" The women in that show, Catherine Gale, Emma Peel, and Tara King, all had respectable British properness, but underneath all that was this element of delicious mischief. I am now going to have to add Bernadette O'Farrell's Maid Marian to my mental list of ""Hottest British Women.""

I am extremely pleased with my purchase of the first season of this series and am eager to dive into this second season. I may even seek out the UK disks, which other reviews say have better picture and sound quality (although these aren't really bad). My wish for you is to get as much pleasure out of this wonderful series as we have!",1231804800,2,2338,4.559523809523809
3534550,5,B001DKG87K,"The Adventures of Robin Hood is back for a 2nd season of adventure in the greenwood of Sherwood forest.

Again the US version is cheaper, 3 DVD's vs 5.  A plastic vs a paper package and no Chapter version for individual episodes.  But for that lower quality you pay a price considerably lower than Amazon UK (39 British Pounds about $60 bucks).  In tough times that quite a bit and I don't detect any difference in picture quality between my season 3 & 4 DVD's (UK) and this one.

No matter what version you get the show is as always first rate.  Many classic episodes abound including some of my favorites such as A year and a Day, The Infidel, and The Black Five and the very funny A Village Wooing.

There are traces of propaganda from our communists-in-exile (Laudner et-all) writers; most notably in the episode The Scientist, but this season seems to contain less of that nonsense than other seasons.  The re-affirming the Church as a body to respect more than makes up for it.  The stories are so good that all the other stuff really doesn't matter anyways.  This show works clearly better than most of the stuff on the tube today.

Taken for it's time it was quite an achievement, taken now it is still great stuff, with action, comedy, great acting, a very fetching Bernadette O'Farrell (in an incredibly short skirt for the 50) in her last season on the show, fine plotting and storylines, and a proper period piece that is played as the period it is in.

Keep an eye out for Patrick Troughton (the 2nd Doctor) in many of the episodes this season.

Buy it.",1230681600,,1566,4.491166077738516
3534551,5,B001DKG87K,"This series pre-dated my birth by a fair number of years, but I've found it to be quite a gem for those who enjoy adventures series that are not obviously altered to appeal to modern audiences. Each episode has a self-contained story which can range from light-hearted to somewhat dark. Of course, this is a television show and it's not true to the reality of the times, though it is probably closer in some ways than lavish movie productions from the same time period (or these days). The actors are all a bit theatrical, but very good in their roles.

One interesting point about this series is that you can see that it clearly influenced other entertainment about the same period of time. Black Adder II, for instance, is clearly modeled upon the basic structure of this show. Some of the stories from Black Adder seem to be parodies of stories from this show.

If you like old adventure movies and don't care about having perfect video quality (though this is eminently watchable), this is great value and a whole lot of fun for a weekend in front of the television.",1229990400,,1070,4.596858638743456

3534554,5,B001DKG87K,"To my mind these are the best of the Robin Hoods on film, and I think I have seen nearly all of them.  The actors are first-rate, and the stories remarkably varied and inventive for half-hour episodes.  Perhaps those who are so so delicate as to grade them down because of only middling picture and sound quality (these are, after all, black and white TV shows from the '50s) can't get caught up in them to the point where this doesn't matter.  I can.  Although I'm approaching sixty, watching these I'm once again a little boy in love with swashbuckling heroism--and Bernadette O'Farrell's incomparable Maid Marian.",1226620800,3,616,4.783018867924528

I was a fan of TV show and enjoy watching it when I was young and was please to get it on DVD. The first I got was the second series of Robin Hood from Amazon UK and the quality and sound was great and the price was good and well package and you got 5 disc with all 39 episodes.
When I saw the Amazon (US) that had the first complete season of The adventures of  Robin Hood. I was not happy from the company Mill Creek
It was from the US CBS. The picture quality was poor and did not show well on LCD TV. It was disappointing from this company to make this product there was no remastering or improve quality. The old saying goes ""you get what you pay for Elcheapo""
