8248999,3,B00133KFM6,It was okay for us.  What I did like is that they do repeat the steps.  It will take my husband and I awhile to learn it because you have to remember what order the steps go.,1406505600,,174,3.675675675675676
8249000,4,B00133KFM6,"It is well organized.  Steps were illustrated in detail by amalgamation and by men's part and lady's part then
by the couple.  Very systematic.",1374969600,,143,4.916666666666667
8249001,4,B00133KFM6,"Not for beginners!  Hence the ""Series 2"" part of the title.  There are 3 Combinations of moves.  Each Combination has 3 stages. Excellent narration!  Combinations are harder than the one before.  I think all of the examples are repeated enough times.  Each stage has sections for the leader, follower, and as a couple. A lot of combinations of moves are taught.  One CAVEAT:  I think it's International Style; not American.  But I still enjoyed it. It's worth the discounted price I paid through Amazon.",1237161600,2,503,4.892857142857143
