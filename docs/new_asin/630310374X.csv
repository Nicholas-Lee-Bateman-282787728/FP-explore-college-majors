571359,5,630310374X,I would highly recommend this film.  It's funny and a real classic.  I would give it more stars if I could!,1000425600,2,107,4.0476190476190474
571360,4,630310374X,"The Egg and I is an amusing look at a city girl's adjustment to living life on a chicken farm.  Claudette Colbert stars as Betty, whose new husband Bob, played by Fred MacMurray, gives up his corporate career to pursue his lifelong dream of raising chickens.  Their ""new"" house is a disaster area, and they quickly discover that starting a farm isn't that easy.  Marjorie Main and Percy Kilbride star as their neighbours Ma and Pa Kettle, parents of more kids than they can remember the names of.  Louise Allbritton plays another neighbour who has a mechanized farm and an eye for MacMurray.  The performers are all good, with Colbert delivering another solid comedic performance and Main stealing every scene as the tired, down-to-earth wife of the lazy husband.  This isn't one of those movies that will have you laughing till you cry.  It's a good natured look at a typical ""fish out of water"" story.  I did laugh out loud during the dance and a few other scenes, and with great comedy performers such as these, you're guaranteed to be entertained.",973382400,8,1051,4.736263736263736
571361,5,630310374X,"Claudette Colbert always stated that the ""Cornball humour"" of this films was not something she liked after appearing in such sophisticated outings as ""Midnight"" and ""The Palm Beach Story""  but really Claudette has never been better than in this very funny, well written comedy about a well brought up girl learning (the hard way) to survive on a run down farm out west. What develops is a film with lots of laughs and good old fashioned humour with no need for bad language and crude humour for it to be entertaining like so many of today's comedies.
The film has many hilarious moments, Betty and Bob meeting the unstoppable Ma and Pa Kettle (Marjorie Main in an Oscar nominated role...she should have won!!) for the first time, Betty's visit for lunch with the Kettles and their hordes of children (even Ma can't remember all their names!!), complete with chickens in the pantry, Ma's highly original methods of cleaning off the table in one swish of her arm, the absolutely priceless country dance where Betty gets landed with all the local ""odd balls"" as dance partners and accuses Bob of being a ""cannibal"" for  enjoying a pork sandwich made from there own pig ""Cleopatra"", to Pa's ""borrowing"" of all the farm equipment. A hearty time is guaranteed by all.
I strongly recommend this film and I have a soft spot for it as my own mother was a sophisticted city girl who married and moved to the country and encountered many funny people and situations as her ""introduction"" to country life. Enjoy!!!",971308800,12,1502,4.75095785440613
571362,4,630310374X,"""The Egg and I"" is a humorous autobiographical look at Betty McDonald's experiences on an egg ranch in Washington State in the late 20's. The book  was immensely popular with the public and a huge  million-plus seller when it first came out in 1945. Although the movie  version is a watered -down rewrite which fails to completely capture the  earthy tang of the book, it's still a highly amusing diversion to watch on  a rainy afternoon. Claudette Colbert exudes charm and warmth in her playing  of Betty and she gives an excellent potrayal. Fred MacMurray is boyishly  bland as Bob and the two have a genuine chemistry playing the  ""young"" married couple. As in the book, the most memorable  characters in the film are Ma and Pa Kettle -Marjorie Main and Percy  Kilbride simply steal the show as these lovable country bumpkins. Richard  Long (Jarrod Barkley in ""The Big Valley"") plays the Kettle's  bright oldest son Tom who's encouraged by Betty to go to college and make  something of himself. Esther Dale is hilarious as the no-nonsense Birdie  Hicks, a sour old beldame with the face of curds. Harmless  old-fashioned  fun!",945820800,9,1129,4.832460732984293
571363,5,630310374X,"Hop in the old truck with Bob (Fred MacMurray) and Betty (Claudette Colbert) and head for the hills of rural Washington State.  Betty is unprepared for what awaits her--life on a chicken farm!  Bob is gungho for  the idea, but Betty has never gone near the kitchen to cook, much less to  ""put up all those canned goods"" that Bob expects her to do!  Down  the road apiece live Ma and Pa Kettle and their hard-to-count-how-many  children.  Ma is an expert quilter and Pa is an expert borrower!  You will  experience life along with them going to the county fair, the weekly  dances, planting a garden, everything right down to slopping the hogs.  This movie is great fun to watch.  I read the book, too.  Try to get a  copy, if you can.  It is Betty's real life story.  The movie is based on  the book.  I am sure you will be well entertained by them both.",945388800,19,854,4.32484076433121
571364,4,630310374X,"Claudette Colbert never cared for this film,but the public loved it. Colbert was 44 when she did this and looks considerably younger. MacMurray and Claudette have excellent chemistry as evidenced in the prior movies in which they made together. Marjorie Main simply steals the show as the wildly funny country bumpkin Ma Kettle--her acting is so natural-like that you swear that you've met this woman in real life SOMEWHERE before! Ma heartily scratches her bosom, clears the table by knocking everything off with her forearm while she explains her housekeeping woes to Betty........she's hilarious. Percy Kilbride isn't far behind as Pa and the pair were a real hit with the public: moviegoers in they late 40's literally demanded to see more of these folk, and this film inspired the admittedly corny yet incredibly successful MA AND PA KETTLE series which spanned from 1949-1957. You can easily pick out Richard Long (Jarrod in the beloved BIG VALLEY) as eldest son Tom. Esther Dale is in fine faddle in a typical no-nonsense characterization as the sour (and hilarious) Birdie Hicks. Ida Moore is fun as the looney old lady who once lived in Betty's house. The dingbat comes uninvited for a visit at Betty's house along with her long dead husband, (who, of course, is invisible to all but her!). Betty explains to Ma that she and Bob wanted to have a child ON SCHEDULE(!) Later, at the county fair, when Betty faints, Ma says to Betty in a matter-of-fact way-- ""Say, honey, have you looked at that *SCHEDULE* lately?"" For her portrayal of Ma, Main was nominated for a best-supporting actress AA.",943833600,2,1599,4.904059040590406

572031,5,630310374X,"I love all things Betty MacDonald, even this rather goofy movie that is quite a departure from MacDonald's original book ""The Egg and I.""  It's a well-made rom-com following the formula of the day, funny and eminently watchable.  But it sits apart from similar films of this vintage in that the landscape of the Pacific Northwest is a unique and important part of the story.  I don't know of any earlier feature film in which Northwest forests and climate (RAIN) figures so strongly, almost like another character.  Even though the movie was all shot on sound stages in Hollywood, so far as I know, the setting feels realistic and makes this film something more than just a comedy.  I also love Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray in almost anything they do.  And of course, this is the film that originated Percy Kilbride and Marjorie Main's ""Ma and Pa Kettle"" performances, which created many spin-off movies and became cultural icons of a sort.

If you are intrigued by the origins of the movie and the real story behind it, I highly recommend that you read Betty MacDonald's true-life memoir, ""The Egg and I,"" which was a wild bestseller when it was published in 1945.  MacDonald followed this with three equally extraordinary and funny memoirs:  ""The Plague and I,"" ""Anybody Can Do Anything,"" and ""Onions in the Stew.""",1457568000,6,1324,4.823008849557522

He just makes the decision without her.  **Spoiler Alert -- I did not like how she left her husband when she mistakenly thought he was cheating on her.  She left and did not tell him that she just found out she was pregnant.  She stayed away the entire pregnancy and didn't come back to him until after the baby was born.  She never told him she was pregnant the entire time.  Even though they got back together in the end,  that's just wrong.",1411084800,,729,4.431818181818182

It starts with a steam locomotive (now extinct) pulling coaches out of a tunnel. Its only an egg. Yes, Maam. Will this married couple live on a farm to raise chickens and eggs? [Owning your own business was still common in those day, like a corner grocery store.] Beautiful country. [Note the dirt roads.] They arrive at their house. No running water, no Frigidaire. [A husband who quits his job then buys a farm without telling his wife? Things have changed.] A leaky roof? No central heating? [A wide-open window on a rainy day? You can tell who was raised on a farm.] Theres a lot of work to do. Hauling gallons of water from the well, nailing new shingles on the roof. A neighbor comes for a visit (and borrows lumber). A horse-drawn carriage [nearly extinct today]. Crabs for sale? [Near the sea.] Gathering eggs is tricky. A salesman comes by.

They get a dog - for free! The hired man talks about his hopes. Betty gets a ride and learns about her neighbors. The sign by the Kettles place has a warning. Free range chickens - and children. [Wearing shoes?] Ma Kettle clears the table. A bell summons the family for dinner. Pa Kettle says Grace. [Note the soup and slice of bread.] Betty has a headache and must leave Harriet Putnams home. Now look what youve done! Then it rains. Guns are needed to kill a cougar. Sport won't hunt. Newly hatched chicks need constant care. A tree is cut down, where will it fall? Bob and Betty have a formal dinner, they dress up. Mr. Henty arrives for a visit, looks around, then leaves. Harriet comes by and asks for help from Bob. [Note the old-style top knot hairstyle on Ma Kettle.] There is a dance where neighbors meet. Never mind. Bob made a donation for the food. Betty meets more people. [There is comedy here.] So it was you. Bob talked to Harriet. There is a fire at the Kettles home, it spread.

Men dig a trench to contain the fire. The wind shifts. We see why farm buildings are placed far apart. But their neighbors have a plan to help. Each makes a donation of things they can spare to help Bob and Betty. [Note what Pa Kettle donates.] Later they visit the County Fair. There is competition on products. Bob talks to Harriet. Will he make a mistake? Mrs. Devlin wins a prize. Betty faints, they send for Bob. Whats her schedule? Betty meets another neighbor, Emily. She used to live at Bettys house until there was a problem. Betty gets a note from Bob, and leaves. Months go by, she returns to Bob. Things have changed, she is surprised to learn about the news. There is a happy ending. Betty has a surprise for Bob, she is on schedule. There is an emergency at the chicken house. [This skimps on the daily care needed for chickens.]

I never read the book by Betty MacDonald, but it must have been a best-seller to be followed by a movie. Did Hollywood change the story to add drama? Ive heard that only a girl raised on a farm makes a good wife for a farmer. [Note the lack of electricity in those days, before the REA brought it into the country. No radio either. They used to make tube radios that would run on batteries for areas without electricity. Transistor radios became available in the mid-1950s.] The 1920s-1930s has many people moving from cities to rural areas, reversing the trend since the 19th century. That changed after the war. Note how people helped one another, as needed.",1387584000,,3377,4.459546925566343

573405,5,630310374X,"I stumbled upon this wonderful film by accident on Saturday afternoon and have watched it numerous times since. Fred MacMurray is the clueless husband as to where his wife is concerned. Totally oblivious to her feelings, needs or wants but yet totally devoted to her in his way. Claudette Colbert is the wife thrust into a life she never expected when she learns shortly after her wedding that her husband has quit his respectable businessman career in the city and has bought a broken down farm in the country which he hopes to raise and sell eggs and chickens.

Shortly after the surprise of her life upon actually seeing the farm that her husband adores but is barely held together with literally only a hope and a prayer, she learns that her newlywed life is also threatened by the woman that owns the prosperous chicken farm down the road. Although she is more than willing to help her neighbors get started with their business, what she really wants is to steal Claudette's character's husband. A series of misunderstandings ensue and eventually everything works out for the best. Not the least of which is meeting her delightful neighbors, Ma and Pa Kettle.

Fred McMurray's acting style has aged well, and he'd be as popular in today's movies and TV as he was fifty years ago. Colbert is well, Colbert. Beautiful and elegant as she is, she somehow convinces you that she'd be game to roll up her sleeves and drag a pig out of the mud and back into his pen.

The movie has a lot of good supporting players. Ma Kettle is a bit more of a recognisable woman and than she becomes in the Ma and Pa Kettle movies.

573624,5,630310374X,"This has been a favorite of mine since I was a little kid watching old black and whites on Sunday mornings. The local station would start the day with Abbott and Costello, a random movie, such as The Egg And I, then a East Side Kids or Bowery Boys movie, sometimes two! Then on to Cagney, Bogart and others in about three gangster movies in a row, then the Three Stooges and end it with a Shirley Temple. I was glued to the set! Yes, I wasted my youthful Sundays in front of the TV taking in classic comedy and drama, a move I shall never regret. The Egg And I is a nice little tale of a man with a passion for, chickens, of all things. He quits his high dollar city job and takes his equally high dollar city bride to the country to start a chicken farm, his dream since he was a young soldier in the trenches. Predictably, things don't go as smoothly as planned. Ma and Pa Kettle make an appearance as their new neighbors with a seemingly endless number of children. My favorite scene is when a sweet, absolutely lovely old lady shows up at the farm one night with her ""husband"" and engages the new bride in a weird and wonderful conversation. Claudette Cobert shines in this movie, as the high society bride who loyally follows her husband's dream to a strange and unfamiliar life out in the middle of nowhere.

573629,5,630310374X,"What's not to like about a film that introduces the Ma and Pa Kettle characters?

The story is an old one: executive husband decides he wants to become a farmer so he quits his high-paying job in the city to live his dream. His wife is an unwilling participant at first, especially when she sees her new home for the first time. The new home turns out to be a run down shack that leaks in a rain storm (which comes their first night in their ""new"" home...). Of course, once the new farmer hires Pa Kettle to do some building and repairs around the house, the story ramps up the country yokel jokes. When the Claudette Colbert character accepts an invitation to visit Ma Kettle, the gags pile on. Ma Kettle shooing chickens out of the house so she can serve lunch, the 12 (I think) children descending on the meal like so many locusts, and so on. Of course, the country folk all turn out to have hearts of gold, the wife is won over, and... well, can't tell you everything or I'd ruin it!",1364947200,,987,4.278074866310161

573631,4,630310374X,"I originally purchased this set in 2004 when it was first released on DVD-18 discs. These discs from Universal turned out to be a first class headache. Many, MANY problems occurred with them, not just on this set, but on the Abbott & Costello sets, the Leave it to Beaver sets, the Universal horror collection sets, and many more.

Even with a plethora of irate customers, Universal never admitted any problem.....but they are now re-releasing some of these sets on single sided DVD's.

Though I had problems with my A&C sets, I never had any problem with my earlier Ma and Pa Kettle set. However, I have heard that problems can show up on DVD-18's long after their first play back. Therefore, I purchased the new release of the Kettles (dated 2011) as a replacement, and recommend that if you are purchasing this set for the first time, you make sure and get the later release.

The only negative about the new set is that Universal couldn't have put them in any cheaper, flimsier packaging if they had tried.

The Ma and Pa Kettle movies themselves.....funny stuff. The Egg and I is a classic, with the great Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray.

Definitely a must have for the classic movie collector.",1363392000,3,1205,4.691943127962086

573745,4,630310374X,"Here's a set of movies that will take you way back to the days right after the end of WWII. It's a DVD called ""The Adventures of Ma & Pa Kettle (Volume 1). It includes ""The Egg and I"" and three of the early ""Ma and Pa"" movies. I found the set in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. I can remember how popular ""The Egg and I"" was and how it played on TV for years afterward. The movie was critically acclaimed. It introduced two characters named Ma and Pa Kettle, and the spin-off resulted in a series of Ma and Pa Kettle movies that were released from the late 40s through the 50s. The movies here are black and white, but they are nicely formatted for DVD presentation. It's a real clean ""family-style"" set of movies that supposedly everyone can enjoy, if you can just relax and go with the flow of the corn.

In ""The Egg and I"" Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray play a citified young couple who buy a rural egg farm and then attempt to thrive and prosper from it. Well, Colbert and MacMurray seem terribly mis-cast for their roles, but that's just a part of the droll, low-key humor. The remaining cast in this rural Washington State setting are far more earthy and seem quite at home. Somehow, you just know that everything is going to go wrong with the egg farm venture, and, sure enough, everything does, right up until the happy ending. There's chickens, dogs, cats, pigs, cows, and kids, lots of kids, among the main characters and all have at least some role in the ongoing fiasco. It's a fun movie. Kids should love it. There are a few ""heavies"" that older folks will understand and appreciate. There's a romantic breakup and, yes, a heartwarming reunion.

One important aspect of the movie were the characters of Ma and Pa Kettle, a couple of the hayseed neighbors with nine kids. Or was it 10? Or 11? I couldn't keep track. In any  case, this family was just overwhelming. From this beginning, a long-running series of ""Ma and Pa Kettle"" movies followed and this DVD contains the first three. I remember the ""Ma and Pa Kettle"" movies better because my parents just loved them. It figures. My parents were from rural North Dakota and the down-home humor was well  suited to their backgrounds and tastes. I was a teenager at the time and was not of the same mind.

The second movie was simply titled ""Ma and Pa Kettle"" and presented them in a situation where Pa had won a contest where the grand prize was a new ultra-modern house. Their adaptation to the house brought a lot of laughs, and the house itself, filling a late 40s concept of an ultra-modern house, was funny in it's own way. Pa didn't like living there and most viewers will easily understand.

In the third movie, ""Ma and Pa Go To Town,"" the hayseed couple, ably played by Marjorie Main and Percy Kilbride, invade New York City in connection with a lifetime supply of a certain cola that Pa had won but can't stand. In addition, Pa becomes the inadvertent carrier of a small luggage bag containing $100 Gs and a creepy set of gangsters want it back and the cops want them to have it so they can arrest them as caught red-handed with the proceeds of a bank robbery. The humor is a little thin and drawn out far too long.

The fourth movie is a wildly concocted melange of relative problems, Pa and Ma getting a grandson, a move back to the old original house, uranium exploration, a wild race through the desert and a ride on a railcar pumped by two  elderly women. Don't press me to explain as I had trouble keeping track of it all. As in all these movies, everything ended happily.

Well, I'm glad I found this set of movies and I enjoyed them all, some more than others. Well, ""The Egg and I"" was the best. The others seemed somewhat long. Old fashioned? They don't get any more old fashioned. Family style? Yes, you don't have to worry about the kids seeing or hearing anything here, except for a lot of pranks and destructive mischief. Humor? Well if really, really corny stuff is to your liking, then this is your set of movies. If it isn't, then maybe you need to learn to relax a little. Deep meaning? No thinking required here. Ranking? Well, nostalgia isn't what it used to be, but I'm giving the DVD a weak four stars.

This one isn't funny and the only remotely significant part is the great Marjorie Main as Ma.  Richard Long is good as Tom Kettle.  Colbert has no idea how to play the abused wife.  Her character's entire personality changes back and forth.  MacMurry is so absorbed with himself that I cannot imagine what Colbert saw in him.  Apparently, the MacMurry character quits his job the day before his wedding without telling his future wife.  THEN, he drags her without any sort of consultation to hillbilly country in the middle of nowhere, where he's bought a building falling apart.  He wants a chicken farm.  She wants love, of which she gets none during the first half of the film.  The screenplay is so awful and the characterizations in it so inconsistent that its not surprising that Colbert and MacMurraay had no idea how to play their parts. The dance sequence is far too long...and where did all those people come from???  If you love old movies, avoid this one - the worst I've ever seen.

DVD's are not supposed to be flexed due to potential damage to the micro-metal film inside.  The inflexible spindle holds on to the discs so tightly that I would have had to flex the discs way too much just to pry them off.

574009,4,630310374X,"This DVD set,with two single sided discs(hallelujah!),gives us four movies from the beloved Ma and Pa Kettle franchise ""The Egg and I""(Mar/47),""The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle""(Apr./49),""Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town""(Apr./50), and ""Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm""(May/51).Many people today when they think back on this pair,they mistakenly think they were some kind of hillbilly family out of the Ozarks. In fact they were part of the small town of Cape Flattery,in the state of Washington. Ma with her abrasive and gritty voice could curdle milk at 20 paces while her walking somnolent husband Pa,while well meaning,just could never get around to doing those chores....and he had quite the backlog! Walking in and out of the Kettle world were their close Indian friends Geoduck and Crowbar,who were always there when Pa needed a hand,Birdie Hicks the local town snoot and know it all,smiling Billy Reed who was always there to sell you something you probably didn't need and an entire farm populated with various types of animals from goats,to dogs to chickens. The Kettles were simple,church going folks;good and honest to the core. These were wholesome films and fit for the entire family,which is one reason I say that they don't make them like this anymore.
The Egg and I starred Claudette Colbert and Fred McMurray. Fred and Claudette are newlyweds and Fred has dreams of owning a farm,raising livestock and making a good living from it all. He buys  a dilapidated ""farm"" outside of Cape Flattery,Washington and starts the long,arduous process of getting things into shape while trying to kick start the farm as a money making endeavour. Claudette is a city girl born and raised and while she isn't too sure of things from the start,she loves Fred very much and tries her best to help him make a go of it. Does this plot sound familiar to you?It should as it was lifted whole sale to make Green Acres in the 60s. Claudettes patience runs thin many time throughout the film and in fact she eventually leaves Fred due to a misunderstanding involving Fred and a female neighbour,who she believes has stolen her husband right out from under her. In fact Fred(ever loyal)has bought the ladies farm while Claudette has gone off and had their first child. She returns home to find out the truth and the couple finally settle down to their new life. The film introduces the Kettles played by Marjorie Main(Ma) and Percy Kilbride(Pa)who were just incidental characters who played Fred and Claudettes neighbours. They were an instant stand out with audiences and the studio powers that be rushed out to make a film highlighting the Kettles lives. And they hit gold with seven more films. Richard Long plays their eldest son and the only one to have graduated college. And see if you can spot Spike Jones band member Earl Bennett at the dance sequence.
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle finds the family of 17(!)moving into a new home. It seems Pa has entered a tobacco sponsored contest for a new slogan. Pa only entered it for a new tobacco pouch and is disappointed when hearing he just won a house. The home is a new fangled jobby full of push buttons and futuristic gadgets. Lots of fun ensues watching the pair trying to figure out what button does what,while in the meantime Birdie Hicks finds part of Pa's slogan on some of salesman Billy Reed's flyers. Pa is charged with being a plagiarist and the home is to be returned to the tobacco company. In the end Pa is exonerated and their son Tom gets important financing for his new chicken incubator.
In Ma and Pa Kettle Go To Town,Pa has won another contest. This time it's from the Bubble-Ola gum company and Pa's slogan was decided to be the favourite. Off they go to New York City to meet up with their son Tom and his wife. Before they left they unwittingly made a bank robber on the run their baby sitter for the kids while they are away. He gives them a valise(full of money) to take to NYC to give to one of his buddies there. This valise seems to have a life of its own as it gets taken by mistake and every look alike valise the Kettles buy in its place also gets switched and/or taken. The crooks in NYC seem to think the Kettles aren't as ""dumb as they look"" and are in on keeping the money for themselves. However a couple of Keystone like NYC detectives have been following the gang and in the end,with the Kettles unwitting help,they catch the thieves and the money in the proper valise. Watch the credits and you will see one of Jackie Gleasons head writers for his show,Leonard Stern. Also watch for a pre-Mr. Magoo Jim Backus in a role as one of the crooks in NYC.
Finally we have Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm. Back home after their trip to NYC the Kettles don't have long to wait for things to start happening again. Tom and his wife have arrived and his wifes parents from Boston are coming to see their new grandchild. The snooty pair arrive at Ma and Pa's new home and start nitpicking at every turn. The husband eventually turns out to be a good cracker but the wife takes most of the movie to finally see the light and come around to acting decently to the Kettles. In between Pa has moved back into the old homestead and two shysters come along wanting to buy the property,thinking there is uranium on it. Tom's wifes father knows something about uranium and sends for a friend to take samples but they find nothing. It actually turns out the beeps of the Geiger counter was from some old Navy coveralls that had been exposed to radiation during one of the Pacific A-bomb tests. Ma meanwhile has been contending with her daughter in laws mother who wants the baby brought up hygienically and in pristine conditions. The two butt heads repeatedly throughout the films run and in the end the mothers husband(who usually acquiesces just to keep peace)puts her in her place and she finally apologizes for what she has done. All is forgiven and the Kettles settle back into their new home and life. Old movie director Eddie Sedgwick directed this one,who was good friends(and past director) with Buster Keaton. Also on board here is Harold Goodwin,another good friend and co-star with Buster.
The nice thing about these films is that they were pretty much all inter connected,like a long running serial. They were also(except the first)about 80 minutes give or take in length;just right. They were edited well and the action and pace moved along nicely. As I said at the start the Kettles were a wholesome pair with all the good intentions the good Lord put in their hands. They somehow managed to raise 15 children, and while not in what many would consider to be in the best circumstances,they were very rich in the prime ingredient;love.
All the films are full frame and have been transferred quite well as the pictures are quite crisp and clear. There are no extras.
It is a pure delight to see these films back in action once more for an entirely new generation to latch onto. All in all a highly recommended treat for the entire family.",1302393600,2,7040,4.623003194888179

Everyone of whatever age can watch this without being badly offended. The portrayal of Native Americans (all right, Indians) by a couple of Caucasians in greasepaint is typical for the era and shouldn't be taken too seriously. Its all in good fun.

Check out Ma and Pa and forget our stressful world for a while. You'll be glad you did.",1300060800,,736,4.45925925925926
574073,4,630310374X,"Ma and Pa Kettle were first seen as supporting characters in the classic comedy ""The Egg and I."" They almost stole that show, proving to be so popular with audiences that they were spun-off into an early franchise of their own feature films. Here is a collection of the original and the first three follow-up films starring Marjorie Main and Percy Kilbride.

""The Egg and I"" is the quintessential Ma and Pa Kettle vehicle. Pa's lackadaisical approach to life and Ma's fond ruling of the roost make them an irresistible couple. Their casual style of housekeeping liberated me from tidiness forever. Pa's procrastination has further served me as a model of leisureliness.

The movies aren't in chronological order on this disc. After watching the introductory ""Egg and I,"" you have to flip the disc over to see the beginning of the Kettles' ""Further Adventures."" Here Pa wins a slogan contest. The couple's prize is a spanking-new ""House of the Future"" and a trip to New York. The futuristic house is remarkably predictive of what we have today, over sixty years after the movie was made. It features a wide-screen TV set in an entertainment center, and extensive remote control. However this is the weakest film of the foursome. Most of it consists of the couple's slap-shtick run-ins with the new technology.

Flip back to the first side of the disc for the better-written ""Ma and Pa Go to Town."" Here they claim the second half of their prize, an all-expense-paid trip to New York. Their native west coast town of Cape Flattery has a few Native American citizens who have recurring roles in the series. Their treatment would hardly be considered politically correct today, but for the late 1940's, it does a better than average job of trying to stir the general public to awareness of the mistreatment such minority groups suffered. As Ma and Pa are leaving for their trip, the Native Americans hand them a bag of old beads. When Pa asks what those are for, the Native Americans respond, ""Tell them we're buying Manhattan back.""

This second sequel includes some other creative writing flourishes. Ma and Pa do pause a moment wondering if they might have been a bit rash leaving their fifteen children with a virtual stranger as babysitter, and a somewhat shady stranger at that. They wonder if their children will be safe. But remembering their children's over-the-top tendency to rambunction, they realize that the real question is whether or not the stranger ""will be safe.""  That's a twist on the menacing babysitter theme.

Then Pa tries to capture some bad guys in a novel way. While he's serving as caller for a square dance, he makes headway corraling them with all the ""do-se-do"" and ""allemande left"" formations he engineers.

The fourth movie has the Kettles returning to their original homestead. This sequel is midway between ""Further Adventures"" and ""Go to Town"" in quality. It involves some commentary on the modern tendency to take expert advice about child-rearing too seriously and to keep newborns in sterile surroundings. It has the Kettles tangling with their new daughter-in-law and her parents over these issues. There's also a subplot centering on the public's interest in hunting for uranium then in the wake of the recent discovery of atomic power.

Overall, this is an affable series with two of the most memorable, enduring characters in cinematic history. ""Ma and Pa Kettle"" has become a shorthand way of describing a casual lifestyle that invites everyone to the table - goats, chickens, and people, all alike members of one big happy family.",1297123200,3,3572,4.931780366056572

574167,4,630310374X,"The Egg and I (Chester Erskine, 1947)

The Egg and I, by far Chester Erskine's most-remembered film sixty years after its release, is paradoxically remembered more for two pieces of trivia that have nothing at all to do with the film: its contemporary popularity produced two huge spinoffs. First, Marjorie Main and Percy Kilbride reprised their roles as Ma and Pa Kettle in a series of movies that lasted from 1949 through 1957. Second came the TV series Green Acres, which thirty-five years after its debut is still in syndication on television. (Less well-known but equally as memorable: Betty MacDonald, who wrote the original memoir upon which the film is based, followed it up with a sequel, The Plague and I, about a year she spent in a sanitarium with tuberculosis in the thirties.) Amidst all that, the original movie kind of got lost, at least in relation to the Kettles and Zsa Zsa Gabor. It richly deserves a rediscovery (as do a few of Erskine's other screwball comedies).

Fred MacMurray (Double Indemnity) and Caludette Colbert (It Happened One Night) star as Bob and Betty MacDonald, city slickers who relocate to the country after Bob, on a whim, buys a chicken farm. The film recounts the couple's trails and (often hilarious) tribulations trying to get the place up and running, but pays equal time to their neighbors, who welcome the MacDonalds to country life with open arms. Some, in fact, a little too open; Betty begins to suspect that Bob may be falling under the wiles of Harriet Putnam (Son of Dracula's Louise Allbritton), a gentlewoman-farmer from up the road.

As expected, MacMurray and Colbert are wonderful doing what they do, but the entire cast comports itself with the ability one would expect from a top-quality movie (including, obviously, Main and Kilbride; Main, in fact, landed the movie's only Oscar nomination). Not at all what anyone expected from what was supposed to be a minor comedy film. A few minor characters may offend modern sensibilities (especially Geoduck and Crowbar, a pair of local Native American fishmongers), but after all these years, the film is still a delight from beginning to end. Highly recommended. ****",1277251200,20,2173,4.964285714285714

574170,4,630310374X,"This first volume of Ma and Pa Kettle movies is excellent.  Universal did a nice job, except for one thing: you have to keep flipping the DVD over to watch the movies in order, which is rather annoying.  All four movies are on one two-sided DVD.  They put ""The Egg and I"" (the first movie to feature Ma and Pa) together with ""Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town"" (the third movie) on side A, and ""(The Further Adventures of) Ma and Pa Kettle"" (the second movie) together with ""Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm"" (the fourth movie) on side B.

My only other complaint is that Universal renamed the second movie (the first of the actual series of Kettle movies) on the DVD, which had me confused for a minute before I realized what they had done.  From everything I can find, the movie's title is just ""Ma and Pa Kettle"", but on this set Universal apparently felt the need to tack ""The Further Adventures of"" to the beginning.

Both of these issues are pretty minor, however.  The movies are in excellent shape, and if you are a fan of the Ma and Pa Kettle movies this set is definitely a ""must have.""",1269302400,2,1091,4.266990291262136

the Volume 1:  The Egg and I, The Further Adventures
of Ma and Pa Kettle, Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town and
Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm.

The movie starts off with the Egg and I with Fred
MacMurray and Claudette Colbert.  Fred MacMurray
and his wife Claudette leaves the city life.  He
doesn't know anything about running a farm.  This
is where Ma/Majorie Main and Pa/Percy Kilbride come
in to help about farm life. Fred MacMurray only
appeared in the first movie.

Ma, Pa Kettle, with their fifteen children were so
successful in the Egg and I. Universal Studio decided
to make a series.

The next three movies are all about Ma and Pa kettle.
They are incredibly funny movies.  Ma, Pa, and their
fifteen children live in a run down shack.  They have
livestock running through the house carefree and happy.
Ma is always cooking and washing clothes.

Pa's character role is funny. He's the opposite of Ma.
Whenever Ma, says this or that needs to be done around
the house. Pa replies: Gonna fix it one of these days.
Pa always has a reason to get out of working around
the house.

Pa entered a contest for a tobacco pouch and wins a
model home with high tech gadgets. Pa was more concern
about winning a tobacco pouch than the new model home.

574251,5,630310374X,"I used to sit in front of the TV as a kid on a Saturday afternoon & watch the Ma & Pa Kettle movies. I'm happy to say they haven't lost their charm at all. The one I had always managed to miss was the one that launched the Kettles, ""The Egg & I""; I'm pleased to see it made the DVD collection. The Kettles are supporting characters in this one (it starred Claudette Colbert & Fred MacMurray as newlyweds roughing it with farm life). But it's obvious that Universal had plans to spin the Kettles off into their own film series...lucky for us! ""The Further Adventures of Ma & Pa Kettle"" puts the Kettles in the driver's seat when Pa wins a tobacco slogan contest, transporting the brood into an automated ""home of the future"". All adjust to this new environment but Pa, who's more used to the laid-back farm life (the bits with an electronic-eye door, the arm-rest vacuum, and the heat lamps in the bathroom are a hoot). ""...Go to New York"" once again uses the fish-out-of-water formula when Pa wins yet another slogan contest (for a lazy man, he's done well for himself!) through Bubble Cola, an all-expenses paid trip to you-know-where. A bank robber crosses paths with Pa at the farm & asks him to deliver a black travel bag to his ""brother"" once in New York. From there begins a dizzying series of plot twists as strange men steal Pa's bag, Pa gets arrested for feeding zoo animals, and even Ma puts herself through charm school to be more of a lady for Pa (Marjorie Main gloriously hams it up here). Meanwhile, the bank robber agrees to babysit the kids while they're gone--the poor guy didn't know what he was getting himself into! Look for Jim Backus (of ""Gilligan's Island"" Mr. Howell fame) as one of the thugs. ""...Back on the Farm"" delivers a blessed event: A grandchild for the Kettles (hilariously, Pa gets confused & thinks it's HIS wife that just had kid #16!). The bliss is soon over when the in-laws arrive, and the mother-in-laws' snooty, upper-class Bostonian methods on how to raise the baby ruffle Ma's feathers to no end. Eventually driven from their home & settling back down at the old place, the story takes some wacky detours with the discovery of uranium on the property, a baby kidnapping gone awry, and a wild car chase that closes the film.
It was obvious that Universal had a tried-and-true formula on how to make the Kettle series, with comedy writers & directors supplied (Charles Lamont had also directed the studio's big comedy team Abbott & Costello, and there's a variation of the team's ""pack/unpack"" routine in ""...Back on the Farm""). But when it comes down to it, the greatest assets of the series were the actors themselves. No one lent more credibility & broad appeal to the characters of Ma & Pa Kettle than Marjorie Main & Percy Kilbride. They put their distinctive stamps on the roles, and even great catchphrases & familiar bits left their impressions (Ma's roar of ""Come 'n get it!!""; Pa's lazy lament ""Going to have to fix that one of these days""; or Ma & Pa getting confused over their fifteen childrens' names).
So looking forward to Volume 2!",1262476800,,3090,4.589511754068716

her trademark rough voice, not that it ever did her much good. She`s always fighting an uphill battle.

574253,3,630310374X,"Betty MacDonald's poular novel ""The Egg and I"" became a popular film that introduced Ma & Pa Kettle and their brood of 15 (or is it 16?) children. Like the dwarfs in ""Snow White"", they were an instant hit, and Universal exploited that popularity in nine more films. (The last two are not included in this series.)

The image quality is exceptional. The DVDs appear to have mastered from immaculate negatives. One doesn't care that these films aren't in color, simply because they look so good in B&W. The sound is also remarkable -- clear, crisp, and noise-free. It's unfortunate that many better films have not been so well-preserved.

Let's be honest. These are unabashedly G-rated movies you can show the kids without fear. But they're only intermittently funny. The writers can't think of much beyond putting the Kettles in outlandish situations, then failing to play off the Kettles' common sense and good natures against sophisticated ""city folk"".

The best reason for watching these movies is Marjorie Main. She throws herself into the role of Ma Kettle 115% (or is it 116%?), going well beyond what such thin material requires. (One might argue that such thin material /requires/ good perfomances to come off.) And her voice, capable of cracking cast iron, is always fun to hear. (June Foray has at least two Main-like voices.) Similarly, Richard Long, who later had a successful TV career, brings a sense of conviction to the role of the Kettles' eldest son. And you'll have fun looking for well-known character actors, such as Ray Collins.

Of course the Kettles are wonderful too! Whenever I have an itch, I feel like Ma Kettle just scratching away. I love her voice and I love Pa's voice too. Much Obliged! When the family sits down to dinner, Pa says a prayer to thank God...Much Obliged! Really wholesome humor.

Today I see them as real clinkers, movies with just one joke: lazy Pa and tough Ma living happily in squalor with 15 kids.  Every bit of humor, such as it is, was based upon that, somewhat akin to the banal humor of the Beverly Hillbillies.

""The Egg and I,"" the movie that introduced movie goers to the antics of the Kettle Klan, was a big hit in its day.  Today the hit is more like a thud.  There is a series of episodes that add up to not much of anything.  Fred McMurray and Claudette Colbert play city folks trying their hand at hard scrabble chicken farming.  All the humor comes from their fish out of water adventures.  There's a sequence of pathos that appears to have been thrown in late to round it out.  The writing is bad and the acting is worse.  All in all, the movie is not remotely convincing.  Green Acres tried to revive the premise in after years and was just as silly.

The only reason to watch any of this is for the nostalgia.  The movies elicit the smell of popcorn and the sticky floor of a movie theater decades ago.  But I can't imagine young people buying into any of it.",1224547200,,1211,4.181818181818182

Well, that mystery went right out the window as I sat down and watched this DVD, thoroughly enjoying the hilarious gags and lines and the hilarious performances of two wonderful comics, Marjorie Main and Percy Kilbride.  Each one of these movies provided good, hearty laughs and the picture quality is near flawless, far better than many vintage movies that come one to a DVD and cost the same if not more than this set of four.  THE EGG AND I is of course the most famous title and it really is a Claudette Colbert-Fred MacMurray vehicle with Ma and Pa minor character in the story.  However, Marjorie Main created such a sensation in the part (she was Oscar nominated for Best Supporting Actress!!) and the 1947 film continued to pack in audiences well into 1948 (it was reportedly the biggest hit Universal ever had up to that time!!) it's small wonder the studio signed by Main and Kilbride to revise their characters for a series of endearing homespun comedies.  In the series, Kilbride immediately proved to be Main's equal at superb comic characterization as the totally shiftless Pa.  Marjorie Main makes her slatterny Ma an amazing beacon of humanity, humor, and wisdom, it's no wonder she is among the best-loved character actresses.",1140912000,6,1405,4.737704918032787

574833,4,630310374X,"Marjorie Main was one of MGM premiere character actress.  She appeared in film starring a virtually every star in MGM Studio from Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy to Judy Garland.  In 1947 she moved to Universal Studios.  Her first film there was Abbott and Costello's The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap.  She played the title role of a widow with unruly children.

Her next movie would earn her an Oscar nomination and create the character she would be know forever for, Ma Kettle.  Ten Ma and Pa Kettle films followed.

This DVD contains four films - two on each side.

Side One:

**** The Egg and I - This is based on the true story of the MacDonalds and their chicken farm.  In a story that resembles the TV show Green Acres, Bob (Fred MacMurray) decides to chuck in the city life and buys a chicken farm in Oregon.  His wife (Claudette Colbert) is leery of his dream but wants to support her man.  This dream farm is a disaster.  On one side their neighbors are the Kettles.  Pa Kettle does everything he can to get out of working and Ma Kettle has to keep everything going for their huge brood of 15 kids.  On the other side is a single beautiful woman with a state of the art farm.  The MacDonalds don't have a chance but they make it in the end.

**** Ma and Pa Kettle go to Town - Pa is always entering contests.  This time he wins a trip to New York City.  But they cannot find a baby sitter for their brood.  Well, that is until a crook on the lam shows up.  Ma and Pa go off to NYC and meet Tom's (Richard Long) in laws, the Parkers.  When they return, the kids have the crook ready to turn him self in to escape them.

Side Two:

**** The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle - The Kettles win a new state of the art home.  But Kettle nemesis Birdy Hicks learns that Pa's jingle was not original.

**** Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm - The Kettles are home but so is Tom and his pregnant wife.  When the Parkers  come for a visit, the sparks fly.

The one thing to remember, Ma and Pa Kettle films are not works of art.  They are works of parody.  They will keep you laughing all day long.",1136678400,7,2100,4.111111111111111

574840,5,630310374X,"This warm and funny account of a newly married couple trying to make a go of it on a backwoods chicken farm, based on Betty MacDonald's popular best seller, was a big hit with audiences during the 1940's and has lost none of its appeal today. This is a great film the entire family can watch together.  Chester Erskine produced, directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Fred F. Finklehoffe in this hilarious and heartwarming film all will enjoy.

Claudettle Colbert is wonderful as the shocked but game Betty when on her honeymoon her husband Bob (Fred MacMurray) informs her he has quit his brokerage house job and bought a chicken farm in the country. She figures things could be worse, and they are, as their farm is a ramshackle old place that fights back! After all, there's not another place in the county like it; none of that streamlined stuff--no running water, no frigadare!

There are some laugh-out-loud moments as Betty and Bob fix one thing that leads to another, from a door that comes off its hinges to an old wood burning stove that seems to have it in for Betty! Bob's enthusiasm never wanes and Betty's moxy helps her trudge forward, making the farm their own.

As Betty gets attached to the chicks and a hunting dog who hides under the stove for safety she gets acquainted with her neighbors, Ma and Pa Kettle. Marlorie Main and Percy Kilbride are a hoot as the backwoods country folk with a bundle of young `uns whose names Ma is always mixing up. Pa is constantly ""borrowing"" tools and supplies from Bob yet can't build anything right! This was the first appearance of Ma and Pa Kettle, who would become a small franchise for Universal.

Betty has other things to contend with besides the farm, as the pretty Harriet Putnam (Louise Allbritton) has a fancy mechanized chicken farm just down the road and seems to have her sights set on Bob. There is a big dance and a country fair for distraction, and a side story involving the Kettle's son Tom (Richard Long---Jarrod from The Big Valley) who is different than the rest of the family and would like to go to college. If only that quilt Ma gave Betty could win first prize....

But the real fun and warmth here comes from Betty and Bob and their efforts to make a go of it. Colbert is particularly endearing and even the farm can't hide how great she looks in a flannel shirt and slacks. When Pa's still blows up and starts a fire which destroys part of Bob and Betty's place, all the neighbors come to chip in and help them rebuild. But some confusion caused by the backyard glamour girl, Bella Farms owner Harriet, sends Betty and her ""little surprise"" back to the city for a time.

There is a nice ending, warm and funny like the rest of this very enjoyable family film. Having not read the book prior to seeing the film, I certainly intend to do so now. This film is a hoot, with a warm feeling that will bring a smile to your face. A great film for everyone. Grab a big bowl of popcorn and have fun.",1122249600,4,2976,4.469613259668508

As I recall, the ones without the original PA were not too great, but Majorie ( Ma)  made up for the lack.

But, a Ma and Pa  Kettle  film without Pa, is like Francis the Talking Mule without Donald O'Connor ( IMO).

These four movies are contained on one two-sided disc, even though it is deceptively packaged to look like a box set.

The only three-star movie of the four is ""The Egg and I.""  It stars Claudette Colbert and Fred Macmurray and is the film that introduced the Kettles.  The film quality on the DVD is average -- the blacks appear very scratchy -- and it has obviously not been remastered or restored in any way.

Claudette Colbert is perfectly cast as Betty, the convenience-loving city girl who gets much more than she bargains for when she marries Bob, who is bent on pursuing his dream of owning a chicken ranch.
The ranch turns out to be isolated and primitive even by chicken ranch standards.
Poor Betty is forced to adjust quickly, and does so reluctantly and clumsily.
Those who read the book before seeing the movie may be a little puzzled by the appearance of ""the other woman"", who is absent from the book.
My suggestion: Read the book, then buy the movie, but don't expect the latter to be exactly like the former.
Both are VERY worthwhile buys, though.
If you have to choose between the movie and the book, I'd suggest going for the book.

575050,5,630310374X,"In 1946 Author Betty MacDonald wrote a Best Seller ""The Egg and I"".  In 1947 Universal Pictures made it into one of the most popular movies starring Claudette Colbert & Fred MacMurrary as newly wed city folk gone chicken farmers.  And Majorie Main & Percy Kilbride as ""Ma & Pa Kettle"" the madcap country neighbors with 15 kids. The Egg and I and the Kettles were so popular that Universal Pictures made a sequel starring the Kettles in ""The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle"" in 1949.  Again so successful the Kettles became a series of hilarious films.  Main & Kilbride were the perfect blend for Beverly HillBillies comedy.
Summary:  All 4 films are Standard Format and Black/White remastered picture & sound (excellent quality).  ""The Egg & I (1947) Has newly weds Bob & Betty MacDonald (Colbert & MacMurray) giving up the city life for the life of a chicken farmer ""EGGS"" in the state of Washington.  Their 40 acre run down farm becomes a real challenge along with their scatter brain / madcap neighbors the destitute Kettles (w/ 15 kids).  A great story, outstanding ensemble cast and hilarious antics fill this movie.  ""The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle"" (1949) The procrastinating Pa Kettle obsession to enter contests proves to be a winner. The fun begins when the Kettle prize is a brand new house of the future.  ""Ma and Pa Kettle Go To Town"" (1949) Pa wins another contest a trip to New York.  Who will baby sit their 15 helluns so they can go?  ""Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm"" (1950) Ma & Pa are to become grand parents and the rich society in-laws are coming to stay with the Kettles to visit their grandson.

I rated this dvd 5 stars because I did not want anyone to assume that the movies themselves were somehow lacking. Not at all!! The movies are FAB!! The only couple of complaints I have are of the dvd itself. It was so tightly attached to the plastic tab (that holds it in place), I was afraid to try to remove the dvd for fear I would crack the DVD. It was quite a trick finally getting it pried loose. Also, the fact that the movies are out of order on the disc and crammed onto one disc was a little bit of a disappointment, but you could look at it as a blessing if you are sick in bed... you don't have to run to the telly everytime you want to watch a different movie. On the plus side, the outer case is charming. It looks like old barn wood with the words Ma and Pa Kettle embossed. The movies are in BLACK & WHITE, not color as the description stated. Whew! What a relief! To colorize Ma & Pa Kettle, or any old B&W movie for that matter, is a shame.

This is all the husband's brilliant idea. The wife would prefer the city life, but she goes along with hubby, who never mentioned any of this stuff until AFTER the wedding. Whoops!
So they get a dilapidated (what else) farm house and fix it up. They work the land, build a chicken coup, clean the giant wood burning stove, acquire a country hound dog and meet the local Indians.
To make things interesting, their neighbors are Ma and Pa Kettle and their umpteen wild kids. (If Ma's breasts hung any lower she'd be stepping on them, she occasionally nudges them upwards, as they get in the way of her quilt-makin' and stew slinging!)Pa is a scoundral and a borrower, and Ma turns out to be a good hearted friend to Claudette Colbert.
Then there's the fancy lady farmer who lures Fred MacMuuray with her high tech chicken farming equipment (I'm not kidding.) Well, Claudette gets jealous, as Fred is blindly manipulated by fancy chicken lady.
