3665900,5,B001KKU9DC,"I absolutely love this show. I am up every morning at 6:30 to watch it on animal planet before work. I love what Eugene and Philip are doing at the sanctuary. My favorite chimp there is Cozie, and just watching it makes me learn so much about what happened to these chimps. I really wish they had season 2 on sale here.",1425772800,,319,4.161290322580645

3665903,5,B001KKU9DC,"It's impossible to watch any of these episodes and not fall in LOVE with all of these wonderful chimpanzees! Of course I'm in tears through lots of the episodes because it's HEARTBREAKING to see the state they are in and horrible conditions/abuse they endured for so long before they were rescued! But every single one is so sweet and adorable (especially considering their terrible pasts) that you'll be smiling, laughing, and rewinding constantly to get a look at each chimpanzee because you don't want to miss 1 second of their preciousness! They are truly angels here on earth!!",1422057600,,582,4.948979591836735
3665904,5,B001KKU9DC,I bought a second copy as I am giving one away as a Xmas present. I wish I could get the 2nd and 3rd series but they are not available,1416355200,,134,3.5

3665909,5,B001KKU9DC,This video is a must for those who enjoyed the tv series or those who like learning about animals and missed the series.  I learned so much about the social life and personalities of Chimpanzees.  It was a joy to watch.,1401580800,,219,4.317073170731708
3665910,5,B001KKU9DC,"These videos are simply incredible survival stories.  What's at stake is the very existence of wild chimpanzees and the tropical rainforest that they depend upon.  The rescue worker Mr. Cussons provides relief for the chimps, who often bounce back when in an open air and spacious zoo.  Of course, they are still wild animals and people can't get close to them, which is one reason why a documentary is so good for experiencing chimp life.  They are incredibly human-like and it's touching to see the similarities.  If humanity can't leave the approximate last third of tropical rainforests intact, we'll lose both natural resources and our closest connection with the animal world.  It makes one wonder about a world population heading towards 9 billion and chimps numbering only in the tens of thousands.  The overpopulated countries are not actually making individual quality of life better by going up ten times in population over the last hundred years.  Their food and freshwater resources are cratering.  Family planning, mainly through government distribution of prophylactics, will help stabilize both the human population and save the last chimp habitats.",1400630400,,1165,5.288043478260869
3665911,5,B001KKU9DC,I very much enjoyed viewing this video.  The pictures were very clear.  The sound was also crisp and clear.  Yeah!,1399334400,,114,4.6
3665912,5,B001KKU9DC,We watched the T.V. series loved it and was sorry when they cancelled it.  Bought the Season 1 DVDs to watch it over again.,1388793600,,123,4.125
3665913,5,B001KKU9DC,I LOVE THE SHOW AND COZY! EUGENE NEEDS TO HAVE MORE SEASONS ABOUT CHIMP EDEN! TWO SEASONS IS JUST NOT ENOUGH!!,1386633600,,110,4.285714285714286
3665924,5,B001KKU9DC,I adore everything about this show.  My only criticism is that it only ran for two seasons.  It was an extraordinarily well-produced documentary series about our abused cousins and their human savior.,1375574400,,200,5.21875
3665925,5,B001KKU9DC,.... not have this family treasure. I love it for it's look rather how it shows how captive chimps end up in such a horrible shape 95% of the time. Plus they always show those babies,1368230400,,182,4.083333333333333
3665926,5,B001KKU9DC,This is a very well filmed and  informative program. I would recomend it to anyone who is curious about primates.,1366848000,,113,4.65
3665927,5,B001KKU9DC,Loved it. I think that animal planet should bring it back. I just love Cozi. He puts a smile on your face.,1366588800,,106,3.8636363636363638
3665928,5,B001KKU9DC,If you love Chimps youll love this.  Just don't watch when you have headache. The Chimps screaming a little to much......,1365638400,,121,4.761904761904762
3665929,3,B001KKU9DC,Hard to watch at times. Some of the chimps appear as if they should be put down as a kindness to them. they seem to be too much of a danger to others if they had been mistreated. Sad show!,1363478400,,188,3.725
3665930,5,B001KKU9DC,"I don't have cable - and Loved this video.  Disney Nature Camera crew did an Amazing job capturing an experience no one would otherwise witness.  I can't wait for Season 2 to come out on DVD.  I'm now also hooked on the Jane Goodall Chip Eden Institute in South Africa and follow the rescues and rehabilitation of the chimps, and the mission the workers have dedicated themselves to.  Truly Amazing.  Thank You for providing these treasures.",1363046400,,441,4.75
3665931,5,B001KKU9DC,it was a wonder view into the lives of chimps and their plight. It will bring tears and laughter. I hope more people will get involved to help.,1362700800,,143,4.142857142857143
3665932,5,B001KKU9DC,"This series has captivated me. I've always been a huge fan of the great apes, but I didn't know this series existed.

Since learning of it I purchased both seasons on Amazon instant video, as well as the DVD media.

Its awe inspiring to watch Eugene work. His passion is so visible, and what he does is so selfless. You can tell when he gets butterflies in his stomach from excitement, and you can tell when he's visibly shaken from fear. Both seasons cover the full gamut of emotions and the way its produced is superb. You don't feel like you're watching a documentary series, you feel like you're actually there, experiencing things just as they do in the show.

The other thing I really like is you learn the chimp's names, their history, how they arrived at the sanctuary etc. During the season they take you back to the rescues they filmed as a way to introduce you to each chimp. It's very engaging, and by half way through the first season you know all the chimp's names, how and when they were rescued, their personalities, and how they all get along. I felt very vested in the community.

I can't give this series any higher recommendation, all I can say is, if you're a fan of the great apes, and you enjoy learning about the rehabilitation efforts of Eugene Cussons and the Jane Goodall Institute this series is a must watch.

I am saddened the series ended in 2008 and frankly surprised that something so interesting didn't hold enough viewership to warrant more seasons.",1360195200,,1484,4.56390977443609
3665933,3,B001KKU9DC,"When I ordered this video, I thought I was purchasing the video but as it turns out I only rented it.  Won't be doing that again.  The video itself was of good quality.",1360108800,,168,4.0606060606060606
3665944,5,B001KKU9DC,These DVDs were exactly what I expected. Good quality. All of the episodes. I wish more seasons of the show had been made.,1359849600,,122,4.3478260869565215
3665945,5,B001KKU9DC,"I TOTALLY LOVE THIS PROGRAM. I watch the the shows EVERY DAY !!! I drive my family crazy, because they don't understand why I watch the shows over and over. When I want to get rid of my family; all I need to do is turn on one of my recorded shows,and I clear the room in seconds. I record the programs every morning, and I do not erase them from my DVR. There were only two seasons recorded, I record and watch them as if there were 100 seasons. The other love of my life besides my husband, is COZI!!!I love everything about him; he is so mischievous, then he acts as if he has not done anything wrong. When I am exhausted, upset,or sad; all I need to do is watch him over and over. I am looking to purchase the second season if it becomes available. I really hate that the program no longer records. I really feel cheated that I don't get to see Cozi and the gang in their everyday life now.",1358812800,,893,4.0508474576271185
3665946,5,B001KKU9DC,This is amazing as to how he interacts with the chimpanzees and there reaction toward him I could watch this type of program all day,1358726400,,132,4.32
3665947,5,B001KKU9DC,I used to have my breakfast every morning while watching reruns of this show on Animal Planet. I moved and no longer have Animal Planet on my daughters provider. Had to have my chimps. Especially fond of Cozi. Therefore I bought this set. Works great . I just wish that season 2 was available. Guess I will have to purchase it from Amazon as a download..,1356134400,,354,4.378787878787879
3665948,5,B001KKU9DC,"Escape to Chimp Eden is one of the best shows that I have ever experienced.  The word 'experience' is exactly what I mean.  My heart pounds, I laugh and cry and feel incredibly lonely when the program is over.  I love each and every chimp or orangatang that I see.  (I also love Orangatang Island.  Can't you please put these two series back on the air.  They are exactly what we need in this day of sex and filth.

I have five episodes of each left on my T.V.  I can not erase them.  I love them.

Please,  I know that i am not the only one that looked forward to each and every episode daily.

Please do something positive that will lighten up peoples lives.  These creatures are absolutely wonderful and so loving (when they want to be).  Please bring them back.

My grandchildren just loved them so.

Thank you, Patricia Gregorski",1352246400,,834,4.352941176470588
3665949,5,B001KKU9DC,I first saw this after watching Orangutan Island. I hadn't switched over to my local news yet. Glad I didn't! I like this as much as orangutan island. I've learned so much about chimps. Didn't know it took so much to rescue them & rehibilate them. Eugene is always running off somewhere to save a chimp. Koo Dos to him! Great show! Unfortunately animal planet has cancelled this as well as orangutan island.,1341964800,,407,4.589041095890411
3665950,5,B001KKU9DC,Chimp Eaden is one of the best shows out their it's sad that their was only two seasons wonder what happend to all the chimps like cozy did he ever make it to the wild sancuary that ugene found we just want to know.,1336262400,,215,3.909090909090909
3665951,5,B001KKU9DC,"This show is fantastic! It shows a great deal about the world of chimpanzees and more importantly the abuse they have endured.  However, it also provides hope as you get to learn about each of the chimps and see chimps like Cozy who have experienced great abuse at the hands of humans and now are becoming more wild every day.  I would recommend this dvd to anyone and everyone and only wish I could get season 2 as well!",1330128000,,421,4.3164556962025316
3665952,5,B001KKU9DC,"This series is an eye opening enjoyable family show that will have you falling in love with these chimps over and over again. So laugh out loud and even shed a few tears as you get to know each chimp and there personalities. If your second guessing if this show is for you, Dont....it is great for anyone, any age.",1329609600,,314,4.25
3665953,5,B001KKU9DC,"I had never watched any of these episodes before I bought the season, but because I love primates, I took a chance and bought it anyway. I was not disappointed.

It is a riveting show and remarkable to see the changes in these animals after being rescued from horrendous conditions. I am hopeful the other seasons will soon be released on DVD as I will snatch them up as soon as they come out!!",1323820800,,394,4.324324324324325
3665964,5,B001KKU9DC,"The only thing wrong with this series is that it had to end.
It was educational, entertaining and was very relevant to what is going on in the world today. Does anyone know if it will be coming back?
 Eugene was very engaging and seemed genuinely sincere.
Please bring back Chimp Eden!",1319932800,,285,4.480769230769231
3665965,5,B001KKU9DC,This guy is a freaking hero! He travels all around the globe saving abused chimps and works with them to get them ready to go back to the wild. He is talented and driven. Not to mention he totally speaks the chimps language and knows how dangerious they can be. He is not trying to make these animals pets he is trying to make them animals again. Someone should give him a humanitarian award. Oh and his show is fabulious....did I mention hes cute too? I get up every morning at 6:30am just to watch his show. PS I don't have to get up till 9am.,1314489600,,545,4.150943396226415
3665966,5,B001KKU9DC,"I loved  this show becuz i love and have worked with animals. All the episodes are great. Learn the stories of how these human like animals were rescued from captivity and torture where people made them road side amusements where they thought it was funny to get the chimps drunk and addicted on alcohol. Eugene and his team treated  and rehabilitated them like they were meant to live out their lives; as wild animals in a sanctuary. Some of them had never seen grass or climbed a tree or even met another chimp before. He gave them back their dignity and respect,With love and care. So shall we all who share this earth with these human like animals. thanx.jj",1297468800,,661,4.546218487394958
3665967,5,B001KKU9DC,"I followed this show on Animal Planet and was excited upon it's release of Season 1 on DVD.  It follows the lives of orphaned chimps that are rescued and rehabilitated in a center in South Africa. Every chimp has it's distinct personality, making this an extremely entertaining watch!",1279152000,,284,4.916666666666667
3665968,2,B001KKU9DC,"I've seen a few episodes of this show on Animal Planet now.  Yes, we all love watching chimps.  Yes, I'm sure we're all waiting for one of the cute cuddly chimps to go bonkers and bite someone's face off.  This is one of those shows that just doesn't have enough happening in one episode to fill a full timeslot.  I'm not sure how long each episode is, but I know by the end of it, I'm definitely tired of hearing the same concerns over and over and over again.  Last night I watched the episode where the host goes to sudan and his wife is suffering from complications in her pregnancy.  I don't know how many times I heard him talk about his wife suffering from complications.  But it felt like at least 10 times.  Once at the beginning of every single commercial break and one at the end of every single commercial break.  I clearly remember this being the same for the last episode I watched as well.  Now don't get me wrong, I love monkeys and apes.  They are cute little buggers and endlessly enertaining.  In addition, I believe it's important to inform the public about the plight of these creatures.  But saying the same thing 50 times does not help.  Complications during the pregnancy? Would you like to elaborate?  I guess not.  I think it's because of poor editing.  Thus 2 stars is more realistic.  I would give 5 stars to a series that was better edited.",1276732800,,1369,4.408
3665969,5,B001KKU9DC,"I hardly ever watch TV but got hooked on this series from the get-go.  The Chimp Eden sanctuary, located in South Africa and associated with the Jane Goodall Institute, is a refuge for chimpanzees, many of whom were orphaned by the bush-meat trade or abused in captivity.  The Animal Planet series, which ran for two seasons, shows rescue missions and the rehabilitation that goes on at the sanctuary.  Viewers see the progress of the individual chimps and their integration into chimp society.  If you are interested in the great apes and their plight, you will love Escape to Chimp Eden.  Presently, only Season One is available on DVD, although the episodes of Season Two can be downloaded through Amazon Video on Demand or iTunes.  The important work of the sanctuary continues and can be monitored at the Chimp Eden website at [...].",1261267200,,838,4.866197183098592
3665970,5,B001KKU9DC,"We love Eugene, his staff and the chimps.  The programs are educational, humorous and yes, sad on occasion.  The rescue trips offer us insight into other areas of the world.  We tape the programs and rewatch with our grandchildren over and over.  Keep them coming, Animal Planet.",1244851200,,279,4.872340425531915
3665971,5,B001KKU9DC,"Better than the Animal Planet series as broadcast; without all the teasers and commercials that slow the narrative, this surprisingly moving series will make you cry and make you laugh. The human hero inspires, and the chimps touch your heart; you'll never see a chimpanzee in captivity the same way again. What more can you ask from any experience than that? Eye-opening, life-affirming, uplifting stuff. You'll watch it more than once and you'll want everyone in your family to watch it with you. Well worth the purchase price.",1244505600,,529,5.0227272727272725
3665972,5,B001KKU9DC,"Let me begin by saying I am not your usual Animal Plant viewer but after seeing a preview at the cinema of how chimps are treated and the shelter in which Eugene provides to these animals, I made a point of watching the first season and immediately purchased the DVD the moment I found out it was available.

Should you watch the show, you will not only be a witness to the barbaric ways in which animals are treated, but you will also see that it takes a whole family to nourish and love one in distress (i.e.,  the chimps). This season also showed the dynamic relationships the trainers shared with the chimps, the obstacles of reintroducing the animals to their own environment and learning how to let go.

Again, I'm not one to watch shows about animals often, but I encourage any and all to grab this DVD and see how magnificent human beings are as far as caring goes. I was not disappointed with this item and cannot wait for the new season to start again in April.",1235692800,,971,4.383333333333334
