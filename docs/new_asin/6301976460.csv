402877,5,6301976460,"Okay.  First of all, you have to understand that this is an 80's flick.  If you watched (and enjoyed) this movie growing up in the 80's, then it will bring you back.  Maybe i'm just a die-hard fan of post-apocolyptic-ish 80's movies, but this one is definatley fun.  This movie needs to be released on DVD.  Its up there with movies such as The Last Starfighter, The Lost Boys, Gremlins, and other great (semi-cheezy) 80's movies.  If you like any of these movies, then Solarbabies is definatley a must see.  But its mostly for people who saw it in the 80's and who  still love 80's stuff (transformers, pop-culture, various other nostalgic items).
I love this movie, and i recommend for anyone who saw it and liked it growing up, to find a copy and have an enjoying movie night watching it again.",1070496000,55,797,4.524475524475524
402878,2,6301976460,"The story, or rather the spirit beneath the schlocky presentation of SOLARBABIES is rather wonderful.  It must be veiwed in terms of its symbolism.  The kids are not following a glowing ball, they are following an ideal, a higher consciousness that we all possess if we can only find it.  The water represents a sacred nourishment that comes from the depths of the cosmos.  Most of us have forgotten how to access that nourishment, most of us have lost sight of that 'sphere of light'.  It's unfortunate that even the movie's director did not understand these meanings, nor did the producers nor the more famous, and over-paid of the two writers.  Consequently they all worked too hard to create another B-science fiction movie.  This movie could have been a classic.",1069718400,4,767,4.8538461538461535

402880,1,6301976460,Let me explain the situation.  We have here young orphan kids who roller blade around trying to bring down a corporation with the help of a glowing ball.  Sound familiar?  Probably not.  I would say that nothing in the galaxy compares to the sheer stupidity of such a concept.  Recomendation?  I have none.  I have decided that slamming one's head into a brick wall would be more logical then this film.,1050710400,6,403,4.591549295774648

402884,5,6301976460,Solarbabies is an excellent example of the films of the 80's.  The cast does a great job and the special effects are magnificent for their time.  The movie is an awesome depiction of a controlled future for society and the power of the independent spirit that will overcome anything.  Great plot.,977270400,7,296,4.764705882352941
402925,4,6301976460,"This is a review of the Blu-ray release, not of the film. I don't know how many stars I would give this film, on the merits, but it doesn't matter. Your opinion will differ from mine as opinion is subjective. On to the objective....

This restoration was lovingly completed by Kino Lorber. The video is, unfortunately, slightly lacking in detail. The image appears soft at times and sometimes soft doesn't begin to cover it. The images has been manipulated in order to replicate the original theatrical color as closely as possible. As much of the film takes place at night and was meant to be in a someone desolate desert landscape with grey, poorly lit interiors, the skin tones are often pale indoors and a bit bright outdoors, but not so as to seem unreasonably modified. Color balance does seem to be maintained, deliberately, and it appears more a problem with the source material than the restoration.  To put it another way, the overwhelming palette is grays, beige, desert beige, skin-tone and machine with that wonderful blue lightning so don't expect anything too astonishing on the color front. The sharpness is, however, an actual, honest to goodness, issue. The softness is generally acceptable, casting a feeling of ""Hey, I'm watching an 80s movie"" over the experience. However, it can get out of hand to the point where you might wonder if you are watching an upscaled section of film for a few seconds. Don't worry. You're not, as shown by the clear sections which establish fully that this is an HD presentation. Essentially, when it comes to Solarbabies, still hate that title, this is the best we are going to get, other than the British and German discs which appear to be identical.

Moving on to the sound, it was actually quite good, given the 80s source material. The print was likely not well cared for, given the video issues, but the sound has held up very well and appears to have been preserved.

Overall, I really have to give this a 4 star rating. I know most would say 3, given the video quality, but the color correction, as compared to my old copy, maintains much better skin tone, still a bit gray or pink at times but much better, and much better shading on the buildings and texture on the various land formations. I may be easy to please when it comes to films I enjoyed as a small child.

There weren't any special features of note. Essentially, the American version is the one to buy if you live in Region A and you will need to temper your expectations if you wish to enjoy the film. If you can do that, I do recommend this, for fans.

Good luck in finding what you are looking for.",1503100800,3,2624,4.584221748400853

We get a future that is very dystopian in that the kids are virtual prisoners. They have there little getaways by roller skating and playing a type of roller hockey. The youngest discovers an object he calls Bodie and it has abilities and the other find it too. The evil Corporation wants it and wants to destroy it because it is an ET type of thing and could jeopardize their control of the planet. to the performances...everyone of the kids but Jamie Gertz (who told her she could act?) were enjoyable enough very harmless. The soundtrack needs to be muted...awful. Lots of Roller Skating, I guess it was a thing at the time. Silly movie and predictable but harmless enough.",1469232000,,849,4.414012738853503

It's a post-apocalyptic world, a Mad Maxian place that trades in water rather than fuel, with a giant evil corporation thrown in for fun. The major dramatice tension comes from two teen gangs, one (the bad guys) associated with EvilCorp. And, when not pressed into near-slavery, they seem to get around on roller skates with headlights. Why there are skatable roads back and forth across the desert, so conveniently paved, cleared, and maintained, is beyond me, but there it is. Including that one straight into the secret domain of the goodguy Eco-whoozis. Oh, and the evil scientist - can't forget the evil scientist.

This movie brings me back to my childhood and all time favorite.  Beside short circuit and police academy series of the 80's, I find my collection wrapped with more and more 80's movies.  A must own for the die-heart 80's collections.  Also Lost Boys!  Never a boring movie!

This movie takes place when the work is controlled by overlords.  They control the earths water supply and if you want to survive this cruel enviroment, you have to pay the price of hard labor in the rock mines.  But just when the future seems impossible, a group of teens who form a family find a sphere that soon they find of having powers.  The sphere becomes a deaf childs friend and they embark on a adventure of a lifetime to save the earth and release the water that is being held hostage by the overlords.

I think what has held the past of time is the innocent nature of this movie.  I believe that the 80's generation can appreciate this movie more than our newer generations.

403099,3,6301976460,"So this was one of the weirder movies I've seen in awhile.  In fact it was so weird it was kind of funny, which I guess made it worth watching.  Surprisingly, being a child of the eighties, I hadn't actually watched too many movies from that time ( I was stuck on the tv shows apparently) and so I'm making up for it now by watching a few.  I can definitely see why that whole decade was considered a bit odd now.

It's a post-apocalyptic future where children are gathered and sent to camps that will force them to become a part of the Eco-Protectorate (a group that controls the dwindling water supply).  At this camp their main function is to roll around on roller skates it would seem, playing games. They sometimes sneak off the camps to play games though and at one such time something wonderful happens.  One little boy, Daniel, finds a mysterious orb of light that he names Bodhai that can do wondrous things and he and his friends (a roller team called the Solarbabies) must protect it at all costs.  They also find a new goal for themselves, to save the water from the evil Eco Protectorate.  The only problem is it is near impossible to escape from the camps, and when Daniel goes missing, they have to find a way to rescue him.

The bad guys are complete evil with no redeeming qualities and also have big hair.  Throw in some weird dance scenes and that should pretty much round out the picture of this cast.  None of them were particularly good actors in my opinion, but as said before the movie was so amusing I could almost ignore that.

The plot seemed fairly standard for a post-apocalyptic world.  They have to save a resource and share it with the people, in this case water.  The roller skates though, added a whole new dimension.  There wasn't anywhere these kids couldn't skate.  Made me want to go put on a pair myself and roll through my  lawn just to see if it was skate-able.  Probably a good thing I didn't though because I don't think it would have gone as smoothly as their skating.  Since its a kids movie it is appropriate for all ages and I can see younger viewers identifying with Daniel pretty easy as he was a cute kid who gets to play with the mysterious ball of light.

Definitely a weird movie but if you haven't seen it, give it a watch just for a giggle.  It is average in all ways, but highly amusing.

And I must say I was happy to stumble upon this little diamond in the rough. Where it might not be the best Teen Sci-fi there was back then and might not have the best special effects, it was a great watch and a great story.

403124,5,6301976460,Solarbabies is one of the quintacential movies of the 80's. It has everything from cheesy custumes and mediocre dialog. I recommend everyone see this movie at least once!,1240790400,,170,5.107142857142857
403125,5,6301976460,"This is a classic 80's flick with all the ""new"" specia effects of those days. it was a wounderful story of friendship, hope, and determination.
it takes place in the future , when the rains  have stopped and water is scares. the army rules and homeless and parentless children are sent to  camps more like prisons.
 through in your usual bad guys, vs good guys, add  an alien and boom,  an instant cult classic.  if this is your first time seeing it you may think its an over done story with the save the water thing, but this is probably the one that started all the others since then.  its still a most enjoyable flick  and safe for the hole family.",1233964800,,651,4.322314049586777

The special effects are actually alright, considering this movie was done in 1986. The musical score is the most horrid synthesizer garbage you will ever hear. If you can get it cheap, it's a great addition to your sci-fi collection. Although, you'll probably only watch it once.",1204156800,,421,4.861111111111111

403145,1,6301976460,"This movie was pretty awful. Since I am ranking it with 1 star, then according to another reviewer I must not have a soul. Hey, it doesn't feel bad!

This movie has the worst black stereotyping of any of movie I have ever seen, particularly in a sci-fi movie. It is worse than the blaxploitation films of the 70's, which were at least entertaining.

This movie is about a group of teenage white kids, with one token black thrown in just for the hell of it. ""But just how 'black' is he?,"" you may be wondering. Well the movie makes it clear that he's a true soul man because it goes out of its way to establish these facts:

1. He talks different from the whites. (""Hey Bodee."" ""His name's Bodhi!"" ""Well you say it your way, and I'll say it mine."" Or something to that effect.)

2. He breakdances. (And we all know that all black people can breakdance, can't they?)

3. He likes basketball. (Again, every white person knows that black people all like basketball and they are all good at it, right?)

4. He raps. (Because a person isn't truly black unless they can do a little hip-hop, can they?)

I'm a white guy. And I'm not overly sensitive to racism issues. But watching this movie really surprised me. I was amazed to see such a blatant black stereotype. I can't say that it's a good thing. It is quite embarassing to watch, actually. What where they thinking? This movie would never have been made that way in today's day and age.

The movie itself is pretty lame. It was made back in the roller-blading / cyberpunk craze of the 80's. It has the usual bleak dystopian future typical of those movies in those days. It also features a funky little ball named Bodhi. It is the weirdest, most nonsensical story I have ever watched. It is almost like a bad dream that somebody wrote down as soon as they woke up, which was later worked into a screenplay.

This movie is so stupid that it is painful to watch. The only good reason to see it is to see a few young actors such as Jason Patric (The Lost Boys) and Jami Gertz (The Lost Boys, Twister, Still Standing). It is also nice to see Richard Jordan (Logan's Run), as well as the stunning Sarah Douglas (Superman II, Conan the Destroyer) starring in a villainess roll, as usual.

Sarah Douglas really does make a good villain, too. It's too bad that her talent was so wasted in this crapfest of a movie. ""Sphere of longiness""? Ech!

I don't understand all you people who are giving this movie 5 stars. I mean, what are you thinking? It has to be just the ""I love the 80's"" nostalgia-factor kicking in. I don't see any other rational reason for this phenomenon.

And please. Skating on an overgrown road? Skating in the dirt? They'd get about 10 feet before a rock stuck in their skates and they went flying. It might be fun to watch if you can make yourself believe that rollerblades work in the sand.

I'd have to say, that other dystopian future skating flick, ""Prayer of the Rollerboys"" is a much better movie than this. Of course that ain't saying much, because that movie pretty much stinks too.

Buy something else. ANYTHING else. If not for yourself, then at least to show the black people of the world a little basic human respect.",1137628800,13,3189,4.419795221843003

403148,1,6301976460,"This movie was a lot of things. It was funny (not funny haha, but funny that's retarded), it was silly, and it was amusing. One of the things, however, it was not, was good. My personal favorite part was when the children were break dancing with the glowing orb. Now this is a movie with substance. To begin the tale to which this movie is about, is to well, dig deep into one's imagination. (Or a psycho's.) You see there is this orpanage with these kids and they live during the future when there is no water on the surface of the planet. However, I'm not really sure of all the facts because my brain tends to weed out the useless info. Anyways, they find an orb, dance with it and try to escape for some reason. (Again, info has vanished....) Anyways, they run into and indian tribe, small cities, some people that live underground, etc. What I'm trying to say, is that this is definately a B movie. So unless you want to watch a bad movie with friends to laugh at, don't bother. Lesson learned from Solarbabies: If you find a glowing orb, be nice to it. It could help you save the world and teach you to break dance.",1084752000,13,1121,4.2924528301886795

For all of you who wrote negative reviews, you just have no soul if you did not ""get"" this movie.
A group of orphans overcome obstacles to make their lives better, to save the earth from total destruction. A classic good vs. evil overall theme, and also survival of the fittest. Some of the meaning is lost in the ineptness of the creators of the film, but if you have any scrupples, and just a little heart and soul, you will understand it!  Recommended for fans of Conan the Barbarian, Beyond Thunderdome, and those type of movies.  If you like this movie, you will also like ""28 Days Later"".",1073865600,19,902,4.454545454545454
