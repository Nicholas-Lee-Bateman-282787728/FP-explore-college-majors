8022104,4,B00024JBYU,"As a UCONN grad who was out of the country during the Huskies 2004 Championship run, it was a surprise pleasure to be able to experience their great basketball season through this very good documentation. The Conn/Quest DVD is well done and certainly gives the viewer an up close look at terrific tournament. The only negative (IMO) with this production is the lack of pre & post game interviews with the championship tournament game participants.",1313280000,,447,4.973333333333334
8022105,5,B00024JBYU,"This DVD has the both Final Four games against Duke and Georgia Tech - with commercials and timeouts taken out - so its nice to relive the UConn memories. The other part of the DVD is a recap of the NCAA Tournament run highlighted with the final four teams. This DVD is a bit more lively than UConn's Top Dogs DVD, but doesn't cover the regular season. I have both and is a must for UConn fans. Go UConn !",1091750400,7,405,4.075
