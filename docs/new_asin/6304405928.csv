8189866,5,6304405928,"The first time I saw Monty Python and the Holy Grail, I laughed so hard it hurt.  I then set out to buy it right away.  When I saw it in a boxed set I thought to myself, the other video has got to be at least slightly humorous.  I underestimated the comic genius of these six.  And Now For Something Completely Different provides for thousands of laughs every time I watch it.  I was very pleased with my purchase, and feel that I've gotten more laughs than I paid for.",993081600,,469,4.1098901098901095
