3418101,5,B0018PH3KQ,"I loved this movie.  I thought it was completely quirky and fun and it didn't take itself too seriously.  If you're in the mood for some light-hearted amusement, I say give Watching the Detectives a try.  Plus, Cillian Murphy is exceptionally easy on the eyes and he gets to show off his comedic chops a bit in this one.",1243296000,2,320,4.389830508474576

3418103,4,B0018PH3KQ,This movie was purely entertaining.  If you are looking at for a film for quality this is not the one; but if you are looking at a movie to cheer you up I suggest it.  It was really cute and funny; and Cillian Murphy was quite good looking in the flick.,1231632000,12,253,3.9411764705882355
3418104,3,B0018PH3KQ,"This movie is hilarious beyond belief. Staying up late and catching it on Showtime at 6:30 in the morning was like finding a diamond in the rough. This movie lacks major character development more like a television show that you should have been watching for a few weeks and then got a 2 hour finale special. You never really get any character insight you never fully get to know who NEIL is (CILLIAN MURPHY BATMAN BEGINS SCARECROW) or the even more mysterious Violet (LUCY LIU CHARLIE'S ANGEL'S). Half the movie is spent with Neil half the movie is spent with Neil trying to get Violet's phone number& figuring out where she lives. Neil is quite the classic movie buff and hates the big time establishment ""MEGA VIDEO"" (something like blockbuster) for their lack of love and knowledge of movies they own. He has his own set of nerdy movie friends who bicker over different movie topics, whereas Violet is a very bizarre and spontaneous character who comes and goes her friends like herself are very kooky and random but play minor various roles throughout the movie. She meets Neil and tries to get him to portray the characters he watches in movies rather than just talk about them this leads Neil on an adventurous life risking few days or weeks. The movie loses you in confusion numerous times, amazingly and surprisingly funny if you want a change of pace, just bored out of your mind or you want to see Lucy Liu and Cillian Murphy out of their normal character watch it. It won't disappoint if you fall under those 3 categories. My rating 3.5 out of 5 stars. IT HAS POTENTIAL.",1230422400,8,1582,4.613475177304965
3418105,1,B0018PH3KQ,"I love Cillian in most of his movies but this one is a big bore. I think the reviewer above stated it well, this is a vehicle to display Murphys comedic talents. He has them too bad this film wasted them.
The story is silly and too dumb to be real. Lucy Liu is sadley miscast and is not funny at all.
The film it self is only mildly entertaining, actually it boarders on boredom. If you are a Cillian fan and you just want to see him then buy the movie. If you are a Cillian fan you will definitly enjoy his performance but be ready to be completely bored with the story.",1228348800,2,571,4.017543859649122
3418106,1,B0018PH3KQ,"Don't waste your money.  Liu is completely miscast and ridiculously dressed. Femme fatale she is not.  Murphy apparently was put into this film as a tester for his comedic ability/kooky romantic leading man ability.  Both are sadly tested in a strange script/plot which could've been quite interesting.  It took me three tries (and I am an avid Murphy fan) to watch the whole film.  Much of the dialogue is awkward and the situations more bizarre than ""zany"", although the supporting cast seemed comfortable and more realistic.  One scene in particular made me chuckle involving the film ""geeks"" knowing just when a movie is returned by how much tape has been wound and not rewound.  I felt the same way.",1220572800,4,704,4.8655462184873945
3418107,2,B0018PH3KQ,"I understand why this film was never widely distributed.  How it made it into production is amazing to begin with, not to mention attracting such talents as Murphy, Liu, and Burns.

The beginning hooks you like an old Cary Grant/Katherine Hepburn flick, but it doesn't reel you in.  We get much more background on Neil than we ever do on Violet and this is very unsatisfying.  Their interchanges are more interesting than enlightening and do little to reveal much about what's really going on inside the ""bored"", albeit whacko, lead chick's brain.

Murphy gives a great performance as a small-time video store owner (Neil) engrossed in classic flicks, but we never see the ""inside"" of Violet (Liu), a real-life femme fatale who wanders into his store one day.  And we don't know if Neil ever sees the inside of Violet.

Many scenes drag, do not move the characters along, or are not really pertinent to the plot.  Character arcs are virtually nonexistent.  If you see the movie once and try telling the story to someone, you'll find it difficult to do so.

Bottom line - this could have been a really good movie.  If Violet had, in fact, been a detective or an FBI agent and Neil had somehow become involved in her mission, we're talking future classic here.  We're talking Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn.",1219276800,23,1307,4.734513274336283
3418108,4,B0018PH3KQ,"The basic premise: Neil (Cillian Murphy) owns a small independent video store and lives passively in a world of make believe movies. Violet (Lucy Liu) lives a life of adventure. She would rather do than watch. She stages real life scenarios of situations Neil can hardly imagine. Most of her escapades are well thought out (My favorite being the picnic scene) and leave both the viewer and Neil wondering just what's going on and how things will turn out.

I wish we'd gotten more background story on Violet, maybe a little input on why she puts the moves on this particular guy, but it's thoughts like that ... film criticism ... that will spoil the fun.

Don't go in expecting too much unless you are a Lucy Liu fan. It's not a mature or edgy film. There's not much to it except a delightful 90 minutes spent adoring Violet. Nothing wrong with that.

Lucy Liu gets to wear all these cute outfits, many are low cut but not unduly provocative. The wardrobe department should get some props here. She looks great. She gets to act all femme fatale (though this film is inappropriately labeled 'noir') as she pulls prank after prank in an effort to deal with her ""rare, exotic disease.""

We get the quirky Liu here, not the tough one. She looks like a college student most of the time, except for the close-ups. Her body language and delivery are free spirited and charming in a predictable but nicely done way. From standing pigeon-toed to sniffing her armpit for odor, she's as cute as a button. I don't imagine the film makers were shooting for anything beyond that.",1216771200,14,1566,4.602150537634409
3418109,4,B0018PH3KQ,"Comedy with love as it's central purpose. I loved this film not least because of Lucy Li, who was one of the remake of Charlie's Angels. For light entertainment this hits the spot.",1481241600,,180,4.484848484848484

3418111,5,B0018PH3KQ,If you are expecting a silly romcom then this is that ... but it is also much more.  Great performances from Lucy Liu AND Cillian Murphy.  My only criticism is that Ms Liu's clothes are far too skimpy and she really doesn't need to add that aspect as she is great in this comic role.  Enough great details to watch more once ... straight away.,1457222400,,343,4.246153846153846

3418113,5,B0018PH3KQ,This is a fluffy little film but I loved it. Both Lucy Lui and Cillian Murphy showed what great actors they are by nailing their comedic performances.,1447545600,,150,4.592592592592593

3418118,4,B0018PH3KQ,"Such a funny, silly little indie of a movie! Cillian Murphy does very well in a quirky comedy, which frankly, I was surprised and delighted by. Lucy Liu is very good, but sometimes it seems as those she over-plays her role. Could just be the character she's playing, though, haven't watched enough of her to really know for sure! I might not watch this movie a lot, but I certainly enjoy every time I do!",1381276800,,404,4.4
3418119,5,B0018PH3KQ,This is one of my favorite kept movie secrets! When I first saw that Cillian Murphy and Lucy Liu were in a movie together I had to see it! They are so dynamic and funny together :-),1372118400,,181,3.918918918918919
3418120,5,B0018PH3KQ,This movie is awesome! Very funny! I would recommend it to anyone who like off beat comedies. Lucy Liu and Cillian Murphy are great together!,1370563200,,141,4.68
3418121,4,B0018PH3KQ,"A charming plot, great cast, and refreshingly ""odd""... purchased this DVD when it came out and it has never been in jeopardy of being traded in.",1356739200,,144,4.576923076923077
3418122,4,B0018PH3KQ,"I saw a preview for this movie after searching for another movie Cillian Murphy was in on youtube (On The Edge). Anywho, I decided to watch the first part of the movie and then decided to order. It's definately a movie you'd want to order if you want a laid back, relaxing night. Its a comedy worth seeing. Though, I do think the ending could of been just a wee bit better, it was a good movie in all and I am glad I purchased it.",1343088000,,430,4.011627906976744
3418123,1,B0018PH3KQ,"Umm...i'm pretty sure that the name of this movie is ""Watching The Detectives""? Not i love movies. Maybe you should not sell pirated movies, a little bit?",1336953600,,154,4.7407407407407405
3418124,4,B0018PH3KQ,"I had never seen this movie, but, based on a trailer I saw, I took a chance and bought it and I am very pleased with it and wondering why it went straight to DVD.  I think it would have been successful if allowed to have a theater run.  It is a romantic comedy, with emphasis on the comedy, which is a bit zany and over-the-top at times but the actors play it so well that the whole thing seems strangely plausible.  All the actors, including the minor characters, are perfectly cast for their roles.  The musical score is catchy and fun and goes well with the action.  I have already watched the DVD several times and it is one of those movies that I can watch over and over.  It has plenty of complexities so that I notice something new each time I watch it.  I recommend this movie, especially if you are a fan of Lucy Liu , who gives an impressive performance as the funny and fearless femme fatale.",1330905600,3,903,4.215116279069767
3418125,4,B0018PH3KQ,"This quirky romantic comedy is lighthearted fun.
It's not meant to be a Dr. Zhivago and doesn't pretend to be. It accomplishes what it sets out to do - offer light & breezy comedic entertainment. Lucy Liu and Cillian Murphy are great together.",1321574400,2,243,4.674418604651163
3418126,5,B0018PH3KQ,"Loved ""Watching the Detectives!""  Quirky romance!  Lucy Liu's character is a hoot in the ways she goes about to test Cillian Murphy's character to see whether he is a good guy or not and whether she should invest time in him.  Cilliam Murphy rocks as usual -- a most versatile and amazing actor.  See the film, have a laugh.",1274313600,5,324,4.440677966101695
3418127,5,B0018PH3KQ,"You cannot judge a book by its cover.  I was not expecting much out of this movie but I was really surprised to find Murphy has a real talent for comedy.  I laughed throughtout the whole movie.  I thought the script was smart and very funny, and the performances were fresh and unexpected.",1272844800,5,289,4.415094339622642
3418128,3,B0018PH3KQ,"Lead actors Cillian Murphy and Lucy Liu carry ""Watching the Detectives,"" which probably started as a screwball comedy but ended up morphing into something more akin to slice of life or fantasy. Murphy is a video store owner hopelessly tied to vintage film and a group of losers that pose as his friends and hangers on at the store. Liu, an unconventional beauty, comes to the store one day and, upon entering his life, changes everything about it.

This runs about 90 minutes but never varies far from its beginning with the sexy Liu consistently surprising, and often turning inside out, her male counterpart with her twists, turns and tricks. She specializes in surprise attacks, you might say, where the otherwise straight arrow Murphy consistently falls for the gags. It's some fun while it's going on, maybe even more than some, but it doesn't wear well. I could hardly remember a thing about the film two days later than what I've said in these two paragraphs.

Still, the strong leads by the principals lift this above the ordinary. Good production values and occasional flamboyant art direction helps too. This is an offeat story about a couple that goes places most film don't and is unpredicatable all the way. I watched this the same night I saw a big budget, star-studded Hollywood extravaganza where I knew everything that was going to happen 10 minutes after it started. Ninety minutes after ""Watching the Detectives"" started, I couldn't say that about this one.",1261699200,2,1476,4.9
8270426,5,B0018PH3KQ,Cute and funny!  Just happened to come across this movie and it's one of my favs now!  Love it!  Cillian Murphy and Lucy Lou are great together!,1515715200,,144,4.2592592592592595
8270427,5,B0018PH3KQ,I thought the movie was well written and it is suspenseful for a romantic film. It's also a nostalgic look back at 2007 when video rental stores were still around. Cillian Murphy and Lucy Liu are good actors also. This film should of had a much wider release in movie theaters when it came out.,1513987200,,294,4.363636363636363

I don't know when I've laughed so much. The story line is offbeat and brilliant, and both Cillian Murphy and Lucy Liu are impeccable in their delivery. Two pros who are obviously enjoying themselves..  (Who knew gorgeous Cillian Murphy could be so comedic!)  It's sophisticated humor, yet almost slapstick at times.  Thoroughly entertaining.",1500854400,,489,5.1265822784810124

8270432,5,B0018PH3KQ,"After reading some of the reviews here, I felt compelled to give my two cents for what it's worth. I thought this movie was very enjoyable to watch. No, it's not the cookie-cutter version of a detective movie that others are complaining it SHOULD have been!? And both actors worked brilliantly together.

For those who like to take a walk on the wild side and just go with the flow, you will enjoy the unknown chaos that Liu's character brings to Murphy's universe, and his milque toast world IS shattered for the better IMO.

The message here: LIVE life to its fullest, don't just passively watch it going by.",1490572800,3,610,4.587155963302752
