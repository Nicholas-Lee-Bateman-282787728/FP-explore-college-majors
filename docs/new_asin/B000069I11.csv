7965676,4,B000069I11,"""...The visual look of the movie is artistic and creative, a very appropriate setting for two lost, invisible celebrities to try to help each other sort out their problems and their lives. The acting is excellent and the dialogue flows well and is believable. The struggles of the main characters are not limited to just models and singers, but are ones that most people can relate to, in some fashion. It is a great movie for it's budget and I would recommend others to watch it..."" -Kari Morgan, Microfilmmaker.com",1142812800,,516,4.808988764044944
7965677,4,B000069I11,"Well, i have heard this movie descriped as ""a scrappy little indie flick"" many times. That is what it is. It's scrappy, and the plot isn't exactly new but the realationship between Michael Goorjian and Portia De Rossi on screen is really quite interesting. it's a story about two people changing each other and that's it. It's not about everlasting love or about relationships, its just about these two people and how they affect each other and it's really quite interesting the way it is produced.  I happen to think the acting is quite good. I was a little worried about Portia De Rossi, but she definately held her own and was very charming. Michael Goorjian is one of those guys who oozes talent though i have to say i found it a little hard to buy that he was a drug addict....but that's just me.",1039219200,2,801,4.486301369863014
