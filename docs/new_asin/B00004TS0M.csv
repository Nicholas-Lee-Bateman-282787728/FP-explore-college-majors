1352754,5,B00004TS0M,"To answer another reviewer's question: Why would you buy this set when you can get the individual films cheaper?  You can't buy the individual films cheaper.
The version of ""Patton"" in this set is the 2-disc Special Edition, which is out of print except for in this set, and selling for more than the price of this entire set on auction sites.
So save some money, get the 2-disc version of Patton, and get three other great WWII films for free (essentially).",1076112000,26,458,4.585365853658536

  -- The package did not include that DVD title

This was particularly bad because, as a local HS history teacher, we were depending on that DVD to show some short sections for the class.  We cannot stream from the classroom, so we buy our own DVDs.

1352765,3,B00004TS0M,"It is up to the viewer to decide what is fact and what is fiction or what is utter and complete fantasy. But in my Opinion, The Longest Day, Patton and Tora Tora Tora are renowned war movies, 'The Thin Red Line' is not.
  Maintaining a very slow pace throughout its three and half hours lenght, in the 'Thin Red Line' more Japanese soldiers are shown surrendering in the few hours of combat depicted than actually did the first three years of the Pacific war! (If you do not believe me, look up Tarawa, New Guinea, Marshall Islands, and Iwo Jima for example.) And of course the Americans are shown almost to last as the inhuman beasts and the Japanese as noble Samurai.
  Following in the tradition of the racist epic 'Birth to a Nation', movies like the Thin Red Line and Pearl Harbor are rewriting ouf history. For example, in Pearl Harbor the Japanese are depicted as being justified in attacking, when actually the United States stopped selling the Japanese oil because they were allies with Hitler, making war on China, and had just invaded French Indochina.",1076371200,20,1063,4.638297872340425

7923081,5,B00004TS0M,"A very nice collection of Fox War Films .. the best of them is Patton, staring George Scott as Patton and in my eyes watch Scott in Patton, he is Patton and wins Academy Award for the part. In this set collections you get the two dvd set. The Other best film in this set is, The Longest Day .. about D- Day .. a lot of great acting and stars and great acting all the way in here.  Tora, Tora, Tora is good film of both side of bombing of Pearl Harbor, from Japanese to American side of what happen that day, very well told in the film. The last movie in set is less than great just a film in a set is The Thin Red Line as a war film is not great or good, just a fair film here in this set.",1440288000,,689,3.719178082191781

7923084,5,B00004TS0M,"Terrence Malick is an interesting director. I found THE THIN RED LINE to be a deep film, very ethereal in nature and liberating as it is disturbing. Director Terrence Malick focuses on the conflict at Guadalcanal from ground up and showing empathy and apathy along the way. Nick Nolte's performance as an over the hill Lieutenant Colonel trying to impress a very shallow and aloof Brigadier Geneneral (John Travolta) is moving. THE THIN RED LINE is a devastating film. The philosophical and psychological nature and the morality of war within that context seems to be present in some form in Terrence Malick's film. I see Nick Nolte as Colonel Tall as the most tragic figure in this film. In some respects he appears to be sacrificing men for the advancement of his own career, but he is sacrificing his own soul in the process trying to impress the high command of a military by delivering the objective. Nolte fails to see that he has been passed over for many years now and if he doesn't get the job done then someone else will. I found the contrast of the characters played by Elias Koteas and John Cusack to be very enlightening as to how to get the job done and take the objective.

Darryl F. Zanuck's THE LONGEST DAY may well be the definitive film of D-Day June 6, 1944. THE LONGEST DAY is probably one of the most ambitious WWII films ever produced. It's all encompassing scope of the invasion and the combatants and both the individual and collective personal stories of some of the combatants is extraordinary and contributes to the overall depiction and sense of calamity and coordination of the Allies on D-Day June 6, 1944. THE LONGEST DAY is based on the book The Longest Day by Cornelius Ryan and in the book the focus is on the people, the combatants as well as civilians. The integration of both the military aspects and the people that were part of and affected is what producer Darryl F. Zanuck was striving for and he achieved this brilliantly bringing the humanity to the forefront. The cast is a strong one and they all seem to give performances of a high order and they all seem rather inspired by the scope of this film. The cast includes John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Richard Beymer, Stuart Whitman, Sean Connery, Richard Todd, Robert Wagner, Tom Tryon, Eddie Albert, Kenneth More, Gert Frbe, George Segal, Robert Ryan, Wolfgang Preiss, Peter Lawford, Sal Mineo, Curd Jrgens, Edmond O'Brien, Rod Steiger, Irina Demick, Alexander Knox, Jeffrey Hunter, Donald Houston, Steve Forrest, Fabian, Paul Anka, Ray Danton, Red Buttons, Hans Christian Blech, Mel Ferrer, Leo Genn, Fernand Ledoux, Christian Marquand, Norman Rossington, Tommy Sands and Peter van Eyck and many more. There were several directors. Ken Annakin shot most of the British and French exterior episodes, Bernhard Wicki directed the German episodes and Andrew Marton the American exterior shooting. Jean Bourgoin and Walter Wottitz won Academy Awards for Best Cinematography. Robert MacDonald and Jacques Maumont won Academy Awards for Best Special Effects. The popular theme song was composed by Paul Anka the score was composed by Maurice Jarre.

George C. Scott is PATTON. What more can be said? A lot more I suppose. I saw PATTON when it was first released. I was a senior in high school. PATTON seemed liked the culmination of so many epic WWII films. PATTON seemed like the last of that breed. The film is first rate in every department. PATTON is good filmmaking and story telling at its best. But what really drives this film is George C. Scott's inspired and driven performance. There is a certain magic element behind this film. It is absolutely absorbing and has stood the test of time. PATTON is a one of a kind film and I wonder if we will ever see the likes of it again. PATTON went on to win 7 Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor (George C. Scott), Writing (Story and Screenplay--based on factual material or material not previously published or produced), Sound, Art Direction, Film Editing and Directing (Franklin J. Schaffner).",1424649600,2,4069,4.836441893830703
