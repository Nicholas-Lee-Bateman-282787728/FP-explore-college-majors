8326246,1,B001A5KU68,"This video is disappointing at best. 80% of it is previously published material (Mostly in Southern Pacific 1941 by Video Rails). In this video there has been no color adjustment/balance, image enhancement or any other attempt to improve the quality of the original film. Resulting in extremely poor quality imagery. And the background music is more appropriate for a funeral parlor. The narrator often does not know what he talking about. Examples: SP called rear end helpers just that, they did not call them pushers. And the bridge over the Carquinez Straits is named just that, not the Susiun Bay Bridge. A waste of money in MHO.",1518652800,,633,4.925233644859813
