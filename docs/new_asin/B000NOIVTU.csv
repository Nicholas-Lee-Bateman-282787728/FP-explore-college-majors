2773164,5,B000NOIVTU,Perfect Marriage another fine movie like all the actors in it and my favorite William r. moses he dose a fine acting part,1388793600,2,121,4.304347826086956
2773165,5,B000NOIVTU,I love this movie. Am such a lifetime lover. And so love this movie. I would buy again from this seller. I have had no problems love this movie watch it all the time.,1368489600,4,166,3.911764705882353
2773166,4,B000NOIVTU,"There would be no reason to watch this movie were it not for Jamie Luner. The other acting was good, though. The women who plays Tia was very capable. I am not about to give away the story here (how refreshing!) I will say that Jamie Luner is bad-ass. One can almost sympathize with her character here and there, which makes the movie far more interesting than being just a ""she's an evil creature who gets off killing people for cash"" flick. Not to mention, Luner is hot...really hot. So, if you are a Luner fan, or haven't heard of her and want to learn of a red hot redhead with one of the sultriest voices out there, check this out. Yes, it's a Lifetime movie, but it transcends that genre. Sort of.",1362528000,6,703,4.293233082706767
2773167,5,B000NOIVTU,"the perfect marriage is a good movie, actress jamie luner plays a wife who is convinced by the guy she's having an affair with to kill her husband and share the inheritance with him and she moved away and got away from him and fell in love and remarriard again and just as she was getting her life back together her old flame tries to convince her to do it all over again,and the old flame is played by none other than actor james wilder.",1356998400,,438,4.1647058823529415
2773168,4,B000NOIVTU,"Annie Grayson (Jamie Luner) is unhappily married but has a younger lover, Brent Richter (James Wilder). She decides to murder her husband for the quarter million dollar insurance money and share it with her lover. She therefore enlists Brent's help in disposing of her husband. However, when the money runs out and Brent has other affairs, Jamie moves away, changes her name and marries wealthy Richard Danforth (William R. Moses), son of aging tycoon Donald Danforth (Lawrence Dane). Annie has now become Marianne and is reasonably settled. But Richter shows up again, also under an alias, and blackmails Marianne. Now Richard's devoted secretary Carrie's Hollings (Lisa Langlois)starts to become suspicious when she has to pay Marianne's parking tickets from a seedy part of town. She investigates and finds Marianne and Richter together - but is spotted by Marianne. Marianne gets Richter to murder her. Because of her vulnerability now, she decides she needs to be rid of him too and uses the same method as she used for her first husband - a lethal injection. She is getting quite practiced now and decides father-in-law Donald needs to go too so that Richard can control the company. Now another of Richard's employees, Tia Montgomery (Sophie Gendron) gets suspicious about both Marianne's behavior and Carrie's and Donald's deaths and she starts investigating, enlisting the help of her sisterKendra. It's quite an involved plot, and sustaining, though Jamie Luner is never quite evil enough for a ruthless and greedy serial killer.",1353542400,,1539,5.209677419354839
2773169,3,B000NOIVTU,"FOOLED BY THE COVER....Judgeing by the cover of this DVD i thought this story was about a marriage gone wrong, and they were showing us a picture of a very batterd wife. NO woman was batterd in this movie. This film is about a woman who is married for the second time around, and to a nice wealthy much older gentleman. She seems to have everything she ever wanted. But had a nasty little habbit of going about jabbing deadly needles into people. This would happen when she found a person getting on her nerves, and there were a few of them at that.  Not a bad movie.. But I gave it 3 stars because of the cover.",1353542400,8,612,4.186440677966102
2773170,1,B000NOIVTU,"If you're thinking of watching this, belated for a reason DVD release of a 2006 movie, based on the cover then just look at the cover because there's nothing in the movie like it. The scariest scenes are of a few seconds of seeing someone getting an injection and then feigning a heart attack. You'll get a greater thrill from just going to the hospital for an injection of saline (salt water) solution. The movie's writer must never have heard of forensics; needle marks; position of the body; security cameras, autopsies; weird coincidences and patterns and background checks, etc. A California divorce court would be a safer way to gain financial independence. Boringly predictable ending of bad girl dies and nice girl gets the boss and a position upgrade in the company.

Even relative to it's comparable genre of TV romance soaps, this movie just doesn't hold up.",1332720000,6,869,4.871621621621622
2773171,5,B000NOIVTU,"The perfect marriage was a good movie,except to bad for me I already seen this movie on lifetime, I discovered that after I opened it from my amazon box. But thats not saying you won't like it,its a great movie for any movie collection.so I think Ill give it a 5 star. I liked it.",1235433600,6,280,4.109090909090909
2773172,5,B000NOIVTU,"I love this movie.  It was compelling from beginning to end. I just watched it again this weekend for the 10th time.  Even though I know the ending, I am intrigued everytime I see it.",1234915200,5,183,4.2
2773173,4,B000NOIVTU,"The Perfect Marriage is one of the better Douglas Jackson made for Lifetime TV thrillers! Jamie Luner plays Marianne the 'not-so-perfect' wife.  She is cold, calculated, and one heck of a sprinter!  Sophie (I am in every Douglas Jackson movie) Gendron is finally given the chance to spread her acting wings in a role that really suits her. The movie takes lots of twists and turns and has a 'perfect' ending that will leave you stunned and satisfied!",1225152000,14,450,4.756410256410256
2773174,4,B000NOIVTU,"I actually liked this movie...just got done watching it.  You kind of feel sympatheic toward Annie/Marianne until she (SPOILER) kills her father in law.  She should have just offed Brent earlier in the film and been done with it.  Towards the end, that's when you kind of decide, OK you're just a witch with a capital B.  I do like Jamie Lunar in this role though.",1221955200,3,364,4.46969696969697

8179879,2,B000NOIVTU,"This is another one of those made for TV movies that when released as a budget line DVD, has a cover image that isn't even in the movie and makes the movie seem a lot more exciting than it actually is.  No one is bound in this movie, the most exciting stuff that happens is someone gets stabbed in the neck with a syringe at the start and there's your usual car park walking to your car all alone (seriously car parks don't have security guards to walk females to their car if working late at night in an otherwise vacant building).  This is basically the old black widow tale that saturates the made for TV movie genre.  A woman successfully killed her husband at the start of the film, then a number of years later we find her with a new husband, who is worth even more money.  We don't know if she's ready to kill again, but her ex boyfriend has just turned up and is sort of blackmailing her to do it again and share the proceeds.  This one has a lot of staple TV movie actors in it too, including quite a few that were in Melrose Place to try and get that shows former fans to at least give it a go.

Ultimately though it's pretty boring, not much happens, and what does you've seen countless times before.  When the DVD company needs to come up with a fake image for their cover because nothing exciting enough could be used as a still photograph to promote it, you know you're better off looking elsewhere.",1477094400,,1413,4.230483271375465
