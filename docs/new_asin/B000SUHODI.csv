2890854,3,B000SUHODI,great compilation of Christmas classics.  Loved the oldies but goodies and having a great time exposing my little one to what cartoons were once like.,1325462400,,150,5.0
2890855,5,B000SUHODI,"Well, here I go--spoiling my great-grandson Devon again!

Ever since I first saw Devon sitting on the floor of his home watching cartoons--all wide-eyed with ""little boy wonderment""--I've been buying him a variety of cartoons. From&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toy-Story-3/dp/B00275EHJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toy Story 3</a>&nbsp;to Disney versions of such classics as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pinocchio-Walt-Disney-s-Masterpiece/dp/6302642248/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pinocchio (Walt Disney's Masterpiece)</a>, Devon has a good collection.

It was a natural selection at Christmas to buy him this collection of classic Christmas cartoons.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TV-Christmas-Cartoons/dp/B000SUHODI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TV Christmas Cartoons</a>&nbsp;contains eleven of my favorites; I won't name them all since Amazon lists them in the product description. Instead I'll list Devon's favorites, the ones his mother tells me he watches repeatedly:
1. Jack Frost
2. The Star of Bethlehem
3. The Shanty Where Santy Claus Lives

It does my heart good when his mother paints a vivid picture of him sitting there, giggling and giggling. Is there a more pleasant sound in the world than  a child's laughter? A babbling brook comes close...

I know how obsessed adults can be about high-definition resolution and perfection of film, but that doesn't matter to kids, so it doesn't matter to me in this case. What makes Devon happy, makes Grammy happy. Is it any wonder I spoil him?

Highly recommended... And I'm laughing all the way to the bank because the price is so reasonable, making it easier to buy him more.

2890856,4,B000SUHODI,I love this collection of Christmas cartoons and watch it every year.  At first I was unsure of what would arrive in the mail because the cover of the DVD looks elementary but this DVD did not disappoint.  It is now a tradition. It would be nice if it was slightly longer.  You have to keep in mind that these are vintage cartoons and not in the HD that we have become accustom to- but that is also why I love it.  It arrive promptly and in excellent condition.  I had paid less than $4 and find it as an excellent deal.,1263081600,14,520,4.0588235294117645

Stay clear of releases by the studio ""Echo Bridge Home Entertainment"".  They have several DVD releases with the same clips.  There's a youtube channel dedicated to only vintage Christmas cartoons and movies called ""XmasFlix"".  Check it out. Quality is so much better.  I have yet to find a dvd collection that is good quality.  Too bad.",1511740800,,507,4.894117647058824
