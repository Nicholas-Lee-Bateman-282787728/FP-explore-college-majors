7800841,5,1882383532,"I really enjoyed this.  It starts with a very nice slower-paced hatha yoga practice incorporating some elements reminiscent of Kundalini yoga.  It's on the gentle side, but you will also strengthen muscles with poses such as Warrior 1 and 2, chaturanga, down dog, etc.  The scenery in the DVD is beautiful, and it's professionally filmed.  After the yoga session, you go into svasana for a lovely guided meditation, which is very relaxing.  I don't necessarily recommend this for beginners because the instructor doesn't give in-depth instruction -- it's assumed you already know most of the postures.  I do think the DVD is ideal for experienced beginners and intermediate-level practitioners.  Advanced people will find value in the luscious svasana/guided meditation as well as in the simple enjoyability of the entire practice.",1426464000,,831,5.346153846153846
