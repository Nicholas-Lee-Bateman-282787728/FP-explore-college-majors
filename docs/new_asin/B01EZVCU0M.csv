7741446,5,B01EZVCU0M,YouTube may not know it but they are doing a great job of introducing anime to some of us. This is a box set with a interesting story of a parallel world that Japan has access to. Only one problem with Japanese Anime kind of like peanuts once you start it is tough to stop. If you are looking for some thing different preview them on YouTube. I did and bought the entire box set.,1480118400,2,379,4.066666666666666
7741447,5,B01EZVCU0M,This series is both exciting and funny.  An excellent story with a satisfying ending but with room for a sequel.,1475452800,,112,4.6
7741448,1,B01EZVCU0M,"The only reason I gave it one star is because it's the lowest I can give it. Definitely buyer beware  ...
Obviously a bootleg copy, even though it said ""new."" The label was covering the original DVD's label. Not worth the $50 to buy a bootleg DVD!! (I wouldn't have bought it if I knew it was bootleg.) And it took a month to receive it, to the day!",1470960000,,349,4.057971014492754
8759859,5,B01EZVCU0M,"This product is hard to find.  Started looking for it back in 2016.  While the story line is little more than your typical harem anime, it does have enough derivations to keep your interest.  If you ever wondered what Roman soldiers fighting a modern military looks like, this will show it pretty well.
While this isn't dubbed (thank G*d), the English subtitles are pretty good.  The various story arcs are interesting and engaging.  The fan-service is kept to a minimum, which is a pleasant surprise for a harem anime.
There are some irritants.  Seriously, do all the female characters have to wear high heals?
Overall, this is a fun series where the good guys win without having to kill the principal bad guy to do it.",1507420800,,720,4.674603174603175
8759860,1,B01EZVCU0M,"Don't buy this version,buy the Sentai Filmworks version (now available.)
Audio on this is extremely loud,subtitling is poorly done,only dialog subtitled. Words are run together only places subbed are where there is a black screen with white text for a place name like the Imperial Senate,any thing else is already translated in the video such as Highway Signs with English text beneath the Japanese Main text.
This is an import from Malaysia sold by BLG WORLD(Good Service,poor product),with Japanese Audio only with multi Language Subtitles.
The series is good action is great,I think the Crown Prince should be called the Clown Prince for all his stupidity and bungling and being manipulated by the former Bunny Queen,he reminds me of Biff Tannin from Back to the Future(same type of personality)
All Itami's problems with the girls particularly Tuka and Rory are amusing,and Rory's put down of the Bitch in the Japanese Diet with an ax to grind concerning the JSDF, by calling her a ""little girl"",which gets her goat until she is told that Rory is 960 years old which shuts her up,a classic put down if ever there was one.
I have seen this online via download from#Animania App from the AnimePlus TV website and on VOD from Anime Network on cable from Spectrum(formally Time Warner Cable) and other Cable/Satellite systems.
Sentai Filmworks version is a Hybrid(Dub/Sub) 5 Disc set with extras in it,your better off buying it instead of this as I have said for the reasons above.",1499299200,,1481,4.951807228915663
8759861,5,B01EZVCU0M,The subtitles are clear and easily read.,1495238400,,40,4.857142857142857
8759862,4,B01EZVCU0M,Love this anime,1491609600,,15,4.333333333333333
8759863,5,B01EZVCU0M,"The entire series in Japanese, with English subtitles that are legible if somewhat run together at times. I love the series and would gladly snatch it up in a heartbeat if it was released in English dubbed. Might still watch it in original Japanese because I love the voices.  lol",1490918400,2,280,4.6
8759864,1,B01EZVCU0M,I got this because it looked like a good anime when it came in the mail it was Japanese Audio Only I don't like subtitles it would have been nice if they would have put into the description that it was Japanese Audio Only very disappointed,1489190400,,239,4.217391304347826
8759865,5,B01EZVCU0M,A good anime.with solid characters and storyline. Needs a season 3 or 4 just because i need more of this show.,1488758400,,110,4.285714285714286
8759866,5,B01EZVCU0M,One of the better anime series that I seen in a while. It is great to see a male lead who is older and not so perfect. I have watched it over and over.,1482883200,,151,3.4705882352941178
8759867,5,B01EZVCU0M,"Great story but one mistake, how did they gate those large cargoplnes to that world?",1480896000,,84,4.666666666666667
8759868,5,B01EZVCU0M,This is a great Anima wish it was available for American DVD's. So far I can play  it on my computer,1480550400,2,100,3.761904761904762
