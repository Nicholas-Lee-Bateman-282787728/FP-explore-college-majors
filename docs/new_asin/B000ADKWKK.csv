8077936,5,B000ADKWKK,"The latest DVD of Madlax was not bad! We're now getting into the main plot of the story, with Madlax remembering her past. She mentions about her father, who could still be alive. If so, some of you may already know who it is.

These episodes also show Madlax's growing relationship with Vaneessa, which should satisfy some Yuri lovers out there ^o^ But really, Madlax now finds someone she can call a true friend. But meanwhile, Vaneessa is discovered by Enfant, so she provides the protection of Madlax.

As for Margaret, she still holds onto the book which Enfant wants. But I'm still not clear on how she can protect the book even in her sleep! You'll see it, pretty freaky.

Meanwhile in Gozthsonika, Madlax heads off to find ""red shoes"" as she was out of it for a while(you'll see why) She was in a dress and barefoot, looking for red shoes which has some link to her past. However her sniper rival Rimelda catches up to her and tries to finish her off, but Madlax snaps out of it and attacks back.

Anyway, you'll see the rest on the DVD. The preview for volume 5 is already looking sweet. If Madlax pulls off the tension build up like Noir did with the discovery of The Soldats and Altena then we're looking at a great end, to a slow, but well executed series. I still wish Madlax focused more on suave action and tension build up like Noir, but remember that the creators aren't trying to do another Noir. The world of Madlax is mysterious and puzzling till the very end it seems.",1127347200,5,1489,4.423357664233577
