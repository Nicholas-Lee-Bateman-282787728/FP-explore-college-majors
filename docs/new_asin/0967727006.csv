8590796,5,0967727006,"Videotape Review ""Top Executive Coaches in the US""
Reviewed by Ben Dean, Ph. D. for the Independent Practioner, the Bulletin of the Division of Independent Practice,  Division 42, of the American  Psychological Association.  (In Press.)
While some of the most exciting  work in coaching is occurring  in the virtual coaching arena, Executive  Coaching is  coaching's oldest and most developed niche area. It is  largely transacted face-to-face and onsite in corporate  offices. This  30-minute videotape allows us to see four of  its most successful  practitioners.
It begins with a brief interogative that could have come  straight from ""60 Minutes."" ""What percent of business  decisions made by senior executives, in your opinion, get  made based on  emotional reasons,"" the interviewer asks. ""At least, fifty to  sixty percent,"" Paul Rich, one of the four  executive coaches  presented in this tape, answers. ""More  than half?"" the  interview repeats, Mike Wallace-style,  slightly incredulous. ""More  than half,"" Rich asserts.
This interchange underlines how the world  of feelings gets  drawn into the language of businesseven for cerebral  executives who may largely be unaware of the affective  component--and may  partly explain why executive coaching is of growing interest to many  psychologists and other mental health  professionals today. Then, too, the  pay is good with top  executive coaches receiving $ 4,000- $ 5,000 per day  for  their work with senior management executives.
The videotape, Top  Coaches, has Robert Hargrove, Kathy  Strickland, Paul Rich and Jeremy  Robinson talking about  their coaching practices. They provide crisp  answers about  their work, what coaching is, their styles as executive  coaches, their perceptions of the future of executive coaching,and  their  advice for coaching novices. You also see their humor.  Each includes an  amusing coaching story or joke, which in  my book adds value to the tape.
Hargrove, the author of Masterful Coaching, has a business  and seminar  background, and tells a revealing story about  coaching the CEO of Adidas  Corp. Strickland, whose Human  Resource Company, The Strickland Group, is  one of the most well-known in the world, tells about confronting a  top  executive about his male chauvinism with the help of  his wife.
Paul  Rich, who comes from a business and accounting background,  argues that  executive coaches need to have either a strong  business background or a  core competency such as psychology,  before entering the executive coaching  arena.
Jeremy Robinson, the lone clinician in the group (and  co-producer of the tape), is a psychoanalyst-graduate of the  Postgraduate  Center Training Program in NYC, and an early entrant into the Executive  Coaching field. Robinson first  became interested in coaching via his  training in what in  the late 70's was then called ""mental health  consultation.""  He talks plainly about the emphasis he places on  risk-taking  in his coaching.
These four coaches provide vigorous  examples of the kind of  confidence that a professional needs in providing  executive  coaching. Each has a different style and personality, which  is  evident even in these brief interviews.
For psychologists whoare  interested in getting more information  about the kind of interventions  that take place in the  executive suite, this video--the only one I know of  that's  been produced to date on executive coaching--is an excellent  place  to start. For psychologists who are already providing executive coaching,  this tape might provide some instructive  examples to future clients who  want a sense of what they  might face as executive coaches.
Many  executives are interested in coaching but wary about  what is in store for  them. Some confuse coaching with  therapy. This tape, in fact, might have  benefited from  more discussion about how executive coaching is different  from psychotherapy.
The viewer definitely comes away with a sense of the  four  different yet confident approaches to executive coaching.  Some of  the coaching seems more like 1-to-1 therapy  (Strickland), and some seems  more like the work of an  organizational development practitioner  (Hargrove).
I strongly recommend the tape to psychologists who are  interested in making face-to-face executive coaching part  of their core  practices. Although a 30-minute tape is only  a taste, and the time goes  quickly, repeat viewing suggests  that the work of executive coaches might  be closer to the  work of clinicians than many psychologists have  suspected.",944697600,10,4568,5.4644412191582
