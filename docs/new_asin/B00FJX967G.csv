5994063,3,B00FJX967G,"Alright now, don't get me wrong, the series itself is worth five stars no question. However, the subbing job Sentai did for this is pretty terrible, because a lot of the translations are off (EX. Flender instead of Friender. Really, Sentai? Really?). But, other than that, it's still good that this finally got an official North American release, because the whole franchise itself is WAY underrated. If you've purchased this (which I still recommend) but haven't seen the other variations, allow me to guide you.

8616165,5,B00FJX967G,"This is a great older anime. I saw Casshern Sins awhile back. Bought Gatchaman box set (Sentai Filmworks) and saw the preview for this - and thought - "" So that's were Casshern comes from"". This is cooler in a way from Casshern Sins because it shows the origin story. If you like Gatchaman or Go-Lion, or any of the older anime from the 70's-early 80's buy this. Who will do it if not Casshan?",1465862400,2,393,4.253333333333333

8616169,4,B00FJX967G,"Casshan, great Anime show, among the best classics anime.
This collection is very well made, good art works and subtitles, and the image quality is very good. (can be better though).
Love it.
Casshan is among the best classic Anime together with Gatchaman, Ulysses 31, Voltes V, Yamato, Mazinger, Grendizer and more.",1401926400,,316,5.096153846153846
8616170,2,B00FJX967G,"Well I was really looking forward to this release of the original Casshan. I first watched the OVA, and found out that there was a original series from the 70's. I wanted to see this series for a long time. When I found out that Sentai Works picked up the rights for it I was excited. But once I got the Blu Ray Set I noticed several flaws in it. There are a lot of translation errors. The sentences go off the screen in the black border. Is it really that hard to get translations right and to properly position the caps correctly on the screen? Plus the fact they used the god horrible yellow for the subtitles which is a killer on the eyes.

And then the episodes are out of place on the discs. Seriously? Is Sentai Works that lazy that they misplace the episodes on the discs? And it's not just 1 or 2. So far I've counted 6 episodes out of place between disc 1 and 2. I wouldn't of mind it but these are not stand alone episodes and need to be seen in order of the story. This set needs to be RECALLED and fixed quickly!",1397001600,3,1025,4.074257425742574
8616171,4,B00FJX967G,"It is said that Keiji Inafune, the creator of the Mega Man series, was heavily inspired by Casshan.

After seeing the Casshern OVA, the live-action film adaptation, and the new 2008 anime, I wasn't sure what to expect from the original ""Neo-Human Casshern"" series. Certainly it couldn't be all that bad if Keiji Inafune himself liked it. After watching the corny, dated intro, and the excellent first episode, I soon realized the atmosphere it was portraying.

Towns and cities are decimated, people die, and Andro Force is a massive threat. Make no mistake: this series lays it on thick. If this anime was meant for children, I don't see how (of course, times were different back in 1972-73 though). This is a tale of war and one man's struggle against an entire militia of robots. Each town and city he arrives to in his odyssey provides a unique insight on the struggles of war, the overpowering wrath of the Andro Force, and how we humans choose to endure it. Some of the episodes can be downright depressing, but there are a lot of good ones too. Braiking Boss, the main villian, is an absolute beast.

Overall, I had only a few minor complaints. There were a few spelling errors in the subtitles, and some minute translation errors. For example, why do they keep calling Casshan a ""newly-built man"" when it should be a ""neo-human?"" Maybe the former just made more sense in the long run. Some of the animation quality was a bit shoddy as well, but this anime is also over 40 years old so you have to keep that in mind. Some of the episodes in the middle of the series tended to drag on a little bit too long, too.

This was a really rare anime for American audiences until now, and I have to say I felt honored to have watched it. It's easy to see how Keiji Inafune and many others were so inspired by this anime back then.

If you enjoyed the Casshern Sins series, and you have a little patience for older animes, I highly recommend you pick this up. If nothing else, it's a nice little historic time capsule of what animes used to be.",1394582400,8,2041,4.461126005361931
8616172,5,B00FJX967G,I have been looking for this gem for quite some time and had no luck for years. This is a definite must have to add to your collection of classic Nastyness.,1394150400,,156,4.064516129032258
