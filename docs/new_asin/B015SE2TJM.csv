7452078,5,B015SE2TJM,Wonderful yoga dvd. Instructions were very clear and helpful. I really loved both programs both the cardio and conditioning!! I feel great every time I finished. Relaxed and wonderful! Thank You Alaana.,1453507200,,202,5.34375
7452079,5,B015SE2TJM,"I absolutely love this dvd!!! I bought Alanna's 1st dvd 2 years ago when I started practicing yoga. This dvd is perfect for the next step. Separated into cardio, strengthening and a positive affirmation meditation, I can do as much as time allows for me each day. The sequences are easy to follow. I highly recommend this dvd!!",1451260800,,327,4.655172413793103
8734552,4,B015SE2TJM,"Being new to yoga I was looking for a beginners yoga DVD which this almost worked for what I was looking for. Before deciding to buy the DVD, I checked it out from my local library and I am glad I did as I will not be buying it. I like the speed and the tone of this video and a couple of the moves are challenging which at this point I am not able to do. She talks you through ""almost"" all the moves which I liked, but the almost is where I have the problem.

The problem is at one point she talks you through a series of several moves (3 to 5 minutes) on the left side of the body bringing you to the switching point, at the switching point she stops talking and just does same series of moves for the right side. Unless you have a great memory and timing there is not any way to know what you are supposed to do and when; plus it is hard to know what is going on when you half the moves you are doing you are looking at the floor, thus you need the voice ques.

Over all I liked the DVD but without the continuous voice guidance it does not work for me.",1515196800,,1056,3.8394495412844036

8734554,3,B015SE2TJM,The item came in great condition. Only it says its for beginners and It was to fast paced for me. Only reason I am giving 3 stars,1504137600,,129,3.814814814814815
8734555,5,B015SE2TJM,Was looking for a yoga dvd that would concentrate on strength and conditioning.  Alanna Zabel is a great yoga teacher.  She broke this up in three segments:  cardio yoga to get your heart rate up; strength and conditioning was very challenging but gives me something to work on to improve and then mediation which works good to find your calm.  I would buy any dvds from this yoga teacher.,1501459200,,389,4.594202898550725
8734556,1,B015SE2TJM,This workout DVD is AWFUL.  There's nothing especially cardio about it.  The title is misleading and there's a portion of the practice that has no audio instruction.  Wish I could return it.,1473292800,,190,4.875
8734557,5,B015SE2TJM,"I love the Element Yoga series. Alanna Zabel is great.  I also have another one of her DVDs, which is fantastic.  Yes there is a brief period in the first workout where there is no voice instruction as Alanna is moving, I just chalked it up to a production glitch, and I continued to move with her.  Soon the voiceover was back and I continued my practice.  The second workout and the meditation did not have this technical issue.  If you let a few bad reviews about one brief period keep you from purchasing this DVD, you will be missing out on a excellent workout.  I am happy I decided to purchase the DVD and make an informed decision myself.",1464825600,6,646,4.341666666666667
8734558,5,B015SE2TJM,Good instruction!,1459900800,,17,8.0
8734559,3,B015SE2TJM,Did not really click with me.  I found the workouts disjointed and I was really frustrated when she just stopped cuing at one point - for several minutes!  I like Ashley Turner much better.,1458604800,2,189,4.529411764705882
8734560,5,B015SE2TJM,"Wow, this woman is amazing. Not just a great physical workout, but a combo physical-mental and her voice is so soothing I could listen to her for hours. Also, her 10 minute meditation actually made me want to learn how to meditate. She should put out a meditation CD, really. Get this DVD - you will not be sorry.",1456790400,,313,4.322033898305085
8734561,2,B015SE2TJM,I just got this and was doing the cardio and I liked it until she came to doing the opposite side and just quit instructing and leaves you behind.  That just does not work for me.,1454198400,2,179,3.9722222222222223
