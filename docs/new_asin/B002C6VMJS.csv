3904127,4,B002C6VMJS,"OK, so I just picked up and finished watching the Best of Smackdown 10th Anniversary DVD, and unfortunately, my biggest
fear regarding this set is true... most of the matches are just highlights. I bought this set really looking forward to seeing the
Iron Man match between Kurt Angle and Brock Lesnar, but it's just a highlight package. So, before I get to my review, here's
a list of the actual complete matches you'll get on this 3-disc DVD set:

1. Randy Orton vs. The Undertaker - 9/16/2005
2. Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio (steel cage match) - 9/09/2005
3. Chyna vs. Chris Jericho (IC Title match) - 12/30/1999
4. Carlito vs. John Cena (US Title match & Carlito's debut) - 10/07/2004
5. Tazz vs. Triple H (non-title WWE Champion vs. ECW Champion) - 4/20/2000
6. Chris Jericho vs. Hulk Hogan (WWE Undisputed Championship match) - 5/02/2002
7. Jeff Hardy, Batista, Rey Mysterio & Finlay vs. MVP, JBL, Kane & Brian Kendrick (six-man tag) - 10/03/2008
8. Randy Orton vs. Hardcore Holly (Randy Orton's debut) - 4/25/2002
9. The Rock vs. The Dudley Boyz (Handicap Tables match) - 3/09/2000
10. Rey Mysterio vs. Matt Hardy (Cruiserweight Championship match) - 6/05/2003
11. RVD vs. Steve Austin (non-title match) - 9/06/2001
12. Team Angle vs. Eddie Guerrero & Tajiri (WWE Tag Title match) - 5/29/2003
13. JBL vs. Eddie Guerrero (WWE Title match inside a steel cage) - 7/15/2004
14. Kurt Angle vs. The Undertaker (WWE Undisputed Championship match) - 7/07/2002
15. Rock 'n Sock Connection vs. the New Age Outlaws (World Tag Team Championship match) - 10/14/1999
16. John Cena vs. Kurt Angle (Cena's debut) - 6/27/2002
17. Stephanie McMahon & Zack Gowan vs. Big Show (Handicap match) - 7/03/2003
18. Edge & Hulk Hogan vs. Billy & Chuck (World Tag Title Championship match) - 7/04/2002
19. Triple H vs. Jeff Hardy (IC Title match) - 4/12/2001
20. Edge vs. Eddie Guerrero (No DQ match) - 9/26/2002
21. The Rock vs. Triple H w/Shawn Michaels as special guest ref (WWE Title match) - 8/26/1999

That's it, all the other matches are shown in highlight packages. So with that said, here's my review...

The 10th Anniversary set of Smackdown is similar to the way the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-The-Best-of-RAW-15th-Anniversary/dp/B000VXWK8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE: The Best of RAW 15th Anniversary</a>
was presented, with one exception. The packaging is the same the only thing that's different is that the show is presented
in a 100 greatest moments countdown. Which is fine, but the countdown is really off balance, in my opinion. For example, the
Eddie Guerrero Tribute show is number 46 on the list. Really? That would've been in my top five. I mean, they put Mick Foley
as Smackdown Commissioner ahead of the Eddie Tribute show. That blows my mind considering how important Eddie Guerrero
was to building the Smackdown brand. So, the countdown itself should be taken with a grain of salt. Their top choice is obvious, it's
the 9/11 tribute show that aired on Sept. 13th 2001. WWE was the first entertainment or sports entity to hold a public event since the
devastating attacks, something I don't think they received enough credit for doing. I really would've loved to see them include
this complete episode on a 4th bonus disc, it was that memorable of a show and the highlight package they show in the countdown
doesn't do it justice.
The countdown is hosted by Michael Cole & Matt Stryker and the countdown is dominated by highlights & angles, not actual matches.
At first I was bummed by all the highlights, but by disc two, I was loving it. When you watch this set, you realize how many great
moments there have actually been on Smackdown, and I've forgotten about a lot of these. So it's great to see them all again.
As is usual with all WWE DVDs now, Chris Benoit is not here, however you do see him briefly during the ring entrances of the TLC III
video package, but not during the actual match highlights (that complete match can be seen here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-The-Ladder-Match/dp/B000LC3IJ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE - The Ladder Match</a>).
It's sad because Benoit was such a huge part of Smackdown, but I understand why they don't show him anymore.
I was just as surprised by what they included as what they omitted. For example, the really put over Mr. Kennedy, who is rumored to be on his
way to TNA. They also put over and mentioned Kurt Angle quite a bit. You can tell WWE still holds a grudge against Brock Lesnar because they
grit their teeth and only mention him when they must, which is a shame because Brock was a huge part of Smackdown's success.
The timing of this release is also both good & bad because there's a lot of Jeff Hardy on this release (he's also featured on the cover) and
you gotta believe if Jeff Hardy's recent arrest had happened a few months earlier that he wouldn't be anywhere to be found
on this release. And since WWE just cancelled their planned solo Jeff Hardy DVD, this may be the last we see of Jeff Hardy on WWE DVDs for
quite some time, maybe the last time if he's found guilty, so enjoy him here while you can!

Overall, I was pleased with the set. It's hard to argue with the complete matches they included. The set is worth picking up just to see
all of the Undisputed WWE Title matches making their DVD debut here! Also, the no DQ match between Edge and Eddie Guerrero is a classic!
I removed a star for the highlights only versions of other matches I was really hoping to see (the Iron Man Match & the Supermarket Brawl
between Austin & Booker T, just for example). But fortunately, there's enough highlights and full length matches to satisfy any Smackdown
or wrestling fan, especially if you only started watching within the last couple of years and are curious about the early days of Smackdown.",1252972800,27,5881,4.8662674650698605
3904128,4,B002C6VMJS,"Overall, it is a blast from the past when looking at these Smackdown moments. The program is presented with Michael Cole and Matt Striker; it usually highlights the moments instead of putting the WHOLE moment in there. There are some matches here and there, but only a few worth noting (Taker vs Angle, Randy & Cena's debut matches, etc.) Nonetheless, for $20 it is a good value for all these ""moments"" just spread around in three discs.",1252195200,,437,4.688311688311688
3904129,5,B002C6VMJS,"With what's going on right with the WWE shows right now,i'm glad that with the previous release of the BEST OF RAW 15TH ANNIVERSARY DVD SET and THE BEST OF SATURDAY NIGHT'S MAIN EVENT DVD SET,that the WWE is now releasing this BEST OF SMACKDOWN 10TH ANNIVERSARY SET! I cannot wait when it's released!",1248739200,2,300,4.574074074074074
3904130,4,B002C6VMJS,"This is the official lineup from Silvervision.com. From the info listed below it looks to be set up similar to the Best of Raw set from a few years ago but as a countdown of moments and matches rather than a timeline. Hopefully the matches listed will be the entire match rather than just highlights.

For ten years, SmackDown has provided the most unpredictable moments and matches on network television. The Best of SmackDown 1999 - 2009 counts down the 100 greatest moments in the show's history.

Also, what really makes this DVD embarrassing to watch is Todd Grishem. He's really annoying and they should've never allowed him to talk on this DVD. When he talks, I feel like I'm watching World's Dumbest, but only worst because he is not funny.

3904190,5,B002C6VMJS,"Whether it was on Thursday, Friday or even the occasional live show, WWE's Smackdown has always been a show that features great matches, memorable moments and shocking twists that make millions of viewers tune in every week. Here we have 100 of the greatest moments from the first 10 years of Smackdown, including matches of all kinds and great segments along with comments from various WWE superstars and agents.

Disc 1

#100, 4/14/05, The Spinner: After winning the WWE title at Wrestlemania 21, John Cena decided to put a lasting mark on the belt as he made the WWE logo spin.

#99, 10/31/02, Unlikely Merger: On Halloween Raw GM Eric Bischoff ends up kissing Smackdown's GM Stephanie McMahon, funny but awkward.

#98, 7/10/03, Here Comes The Chokeslam: Big Show hits Brock Lesnar with a massive chokeslam off the steel steps through the announce table. Cool moment.

#97, A Smackdown Tradition: When Smackdown was on Thursdays they always had a Thanksgiving show and a food fight always broke out, decent segment.

#96, 9/16/05, Randy Orton vs. The Undertaker: After Orton beat the deadman at Summerslam, we have this rematch, which like their other matches in '05 was quite a good one as both played off of each other well. Both traded the momentum early on, before Taker hit a big boot then worked on Orton's shoulder even locking on an armbar. Randy does counter Old School and hits a big superplex, then yells at his dad Bob Orton to bring a moving truck to the ring and a casket is brought out of the truck. Orton wears down Taker with a couple of sleeper holds, Taker makes a comeback, then on the outside Taker goes to open the casket and sees himself in it. Randy slams Taker into the steel steps, nails the RKO in the ring, but Taker kicks out, shortly after we have a tombstone and Taker wins. 8/10.

#95, Mattitude: Pure goofiness here that shows how Matt Hardy became a major heel by inventing his own gimmick called Mattitude. Very funny stuff.

#94, 9/23/04, Show Hunters: Kurt Angle shot Big Show with a tranq gun then along with Luther Reigns and Mark Jindrak, they shaved his head. Fun moment.

#93, 9/9/05, Steel Cage Match: Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio: This was to cap off their feud in the summer of '05 and this was during Eddie's somewhat dark heel turn. Eddie starts off just pounding on Rey slamming him fast first into the cage a few times pretty aggressively. Rey does hit a nice sunset flip into a powerbomb off the second rope. Both men try to escape the cage numerous times, and theres one cool spot where both are on tight rope walking the top rope and Rey hits a dropkick on Eddie. Rey goes for a splash from the top of the cage but Eddie dodges it. Eddie goes to leave through the door, comes back and hits a frog splash for the win. 8/10. Great post match with Eddie trash talking and hammering Rey more.

#92, Mr. America: This was such a lame gimmick as Hulk Hogan was in a mask and it was funny and just sad honestly.

#91, 7/19/01, Out of Tune: Vince McMahon was so happy backstage that things were going well that he decided to play a song on a guitar, which was pretty brutal to hear. Thankfully Stone Cold hit him with the guitar and walked out, in a very funny moment.

#90, Signs of Friendship: Great backstage segments with Edge & Kurt Angle where Edge makes a peace offering and shows pictures to Kurt of the good times they had. Kurt is happy about it but doesn't know the messages on the back and then the unveiling of Angle's new shirt, which featured a phrase that would stay with Kurt for years.

#89, 12/30/99, WWE Intercontinental Championship Match, Chris Jericho (Champion) vs. Chyna: Here was a rivalry that honestly wasn't that good, Jericho was misused in his first few months with the company and Chyna was physically impressive but not that great of a worker. This match wasn't bad, Chyna hit some good moves early on, before Jericho hit his trademark springboard dropkick. While the ref was down Chyna hit the pedigree but Chris kicked out, then Jericho hit a backsuplex and both collided with a chair on the mat and both were counted down for three. 4/10. This would lead to co-champions, which was another sad moment in the WWE.

#88, 6/29/00, Hardcore Injury: During a match with Kurt Angle went for a moonsault that broke Hardcore Holly's arm, pretty brutal to see.

#87, 2/24/00, No Way Out: Cactus Jack was locked in a cell by Triple H and Stephanie, at the end he got dragged by a bus while still locked in a cage.

#86, 4/10/03, The Return of Piper's Pit: After making a shocking return at Wrestlemania XIX, we see some clips of Piper dealing with his guests Vince McMahon and later Rikishi.

#85, 10/7/04, WWE United States Championship Match, John Cena (Champion) vs. Carlito: After winning the Best of 5 series against Booker T for the U.S. title, his next opponent was Carlito in his in ring debut. Earlier Carlito had insulted and berated Cena, so John was out for revenge and Carlito tried escaping only to get hammered on the steel steps. Back in the ring he hits a very impressive delayed vertical suplex and he toyed with Carlito some more, before he gains the advantage and locks on a sleeper hold that Cena powers out of. Carlito brings the U.S. title into the ring, the ref takes it away and Carlito hits Cena with his chain and pins him to become the U.S. champion. 7/10.

#84, 10/9/03, Sewage Bath: Eddie Guerrero brought a sewage truck down to the ring and proceeded to spray Big Show with the contents. One word, ick.

#83, The Boogeyman: A montage of moments of the Boogeyman's antics, including when he ate the ""mole"" off of Jillians face. Again, ick.

#82, 1/23/03, Hulkster Returns: Hulk Hogan made a suprising return on Smackdown that brought the crowd to its feet and they kept cheering for what seemed like forever.

#81, 4/20/00, Champion vs. Champion Match, Triple H (WWE Champion) vs. Tazz (ECW Champion): This was somewhat special due to the fact Tazz was under a WWE contract but had won the ECW title a couple of days prior to this. Tazz does hit some good suplexes like he always does and Trips does his usual wear down offense. Near the end Trips hits the pedigree, Tommy Dreamer comes in and accidently hits Tazz with a chair and gets a pedigree of his own, Trips covers Tazz and wins. 5/10.

#80, 1/20/00, Bar Room Brawl: The A.P.A.+ a bar=Lots of fun and lots of hardcore action, fun stuff.

#79, 8/9/01, Gore! Gore! Gore!: Rhyno gives a gore to Chris Jericho that was so massive it knocked down the video screen.

#78, 9/23/99, Time To Play The Game: Vince McMahon made Triple H run the gaunlet of opponents in the Unforgiven 6-Pack challenge, which was a great episode that I remember fondly.

#77, Rock N' Sock Connection: A great collection of moments from when Mankind and Rock were a tag team, so funny.

#76, 5/2/02, No DQ Match for the WWE Undisputed Championship, Hulk Hogan (Champion) vs. Chris Jericho: We get the usual hulking up and Hogan antics while Jericho got some good moves in and targets Hulk's throat. Triple H's music hits, he joins the commentary team and he had some funny comments, Hogan hulks up and goes for the leg drop but Jericho counters and locks on the Walls of Jericho. Chris goes for a chair, hits Hulk in the back then Undertaker's music hits, which distracts Jericho and Hogan rolls him up to retain his title. 5/10.

#75, 8/30/01, Gold Medal Thief: Stone Cold Steve Austin stole Kurt Angle's gold medals and then went to drop them down a nearby sewer, funny stuff from Austin.

#74, 7/29/04, Gold Medal Auction: Eddie Guerrero was in the ring with a bunch of Kurt's stuff and he has an auction live on Smackdown. Eddie was so perfect in this segment.

#73, Funeral Fight: After Torrie Wilson's dad had married Dawn Marie a couple of weeks before, he then died during the honeymoon and so we have a live funeral where a catfight breaks out between Torrie and Dawn. Loved the footage and the comments.

#72, 5/11/00, Life Sucks...: A classic Vince McMahon promo where he was just such a.... well you know, but its still funny.

#71, Al Snow & Steve Blackman: Snow kept trying to bring a nicer, funnier side out of Blackman, but the Lethal Weapon would have none of it. Funny stuff though.

#70, 10/3/08, 8 Man Tag Team Match, Jeff Hardy, Rey Mysterio, Finlay & Batista vs. MVP, JBL, The Brian Kendrick & Kane: Only historic cause it was the first match for Smackdown on MyNetwork TV as its a decent tag match, thats really only elevated by the star power. Each guy was in a rivalry with one of the opposing team members so there was some good action, but some interference by Hornswoggle brought it down a peg. The closing moments were total bedlam as each man hit move after move and Jeff Hardy hits a Swaton on MVP and makes the cover to win. 6/10. Side Note: Listening to the reaction Jeff Hardy got during his entrance and during the match reminded me of how much the fans loved him and how despite that Jeff kept screwing up his career, due to idiotic choices.

Disc 2

#69, Mr. Kennedy: A quick but funny set of clips of one of the most entertaining superstars in the last 10 years, in my opinion.

#68, 9/9/99, Rough Landing: During a tag team Buried Alive match, Big Show heaves Mankind from the stage onto the gravesite and he falls into the grave. Looked like it hurt.

#67, 3/30/00, Stephanie's The Champ: Stephanie was forced to wrestled the woman's champion Jacqueline and after a ton of interference Steph covered the champ and won the title.

#66, 4/25/02, Hardcore Holly vs. Randy Orton: In his debut match Randy was able to hold his own against the veteran Holly, hitting some good arm drags and a facebuster. But Holly came back and started beating down Orton, but after Holly missed a clothesline, Randy hits an Oklahoma roll and pins Holly for three. 5/10.

#65, 2/10/00, Angle Wins Gold: On Smackdown Kurt was able to beat Val Venis and win the European title and he celebrated in such a goofy fashion that it was so funny to watch.

#64, 12/16/05, New Tag Champs: Batista & Rey Mysterio took on MNM for the tag titles and ended up winning them and they celebrated looking up at the heaven's at their late friend Eddie Guerrero.

#63, 9/16/04, Heidenreich Poetry: During the broadcast Heidenreich kidnapped Michael Cole, then in the back read some poetry in an incredibly disturbing setting. It was beyond uncomfortable to watch, but so funny. I loved CM Punk's comments on this.

#62, 3/9/00, Handicap Tables Match, The Dudley Boyz vs. The Rock: As great as the Rock was he could only do so much against the tag champs, but early on Rock smashed both Dudleys with a chair. While attempting the People's Elbow, Buh Buh speared Rock and went for the table, Rock countered the 3D and put Buh Buh through the table. After a chair shot to the back Rock gets 3D'd through the table and the Dudley's win. 6/10.

#61, 1/24/02, Lethal Dose of Poison: After Ric Flair won at the Royal Rumble, Vince McMahon felt he needed to kill the WWE so he brought the NWO back. Creepy stuff from Vince.

#60, 9/11/03, Parking Lot Brawl: Fun and brutal match between Eddie Guerrero & John Cena, the clips they show are great.

#59, 6/5/03, WWE Cruiserweight Championship Match, Matt Hardy (Champion) w/Crash Holly & Shannon Moore vs. Rey Mysterio: Coming into this match Rey had a groin injury but he insisted on competing and this was probably one of the best cruiserweight matches that WWE has ever put on. The action stays constant as Rey uses his quickness while Matt uses the size advantage to keep Rey grounded, while on the outside Crash and Shannon get caught beating on Rey and they get sent to the back by the ref. After a lowblow Matt takes over working on Rey's leg and groin, Crash and Shannon sneak back out and hit Rey, then run to the back. Matt hits a leg drop but Rey kicks out then counters the Twist of Fate into a roll up and gets the three count to win the title. 9/10.

#58, Sincerest Form of Flattery: Clips of various superstars doing impressions and making fun of other superstars, including The Rock, Kane and others. Such funny stuff.

#57, Superhuman Strength: We see displays of Big Show's amazing strength, like pushing a dumpster on top of a car, flipping Torrie Wilson's Ford Taurus over and also flipping a 4,400 lb Jeep over.

#56, 4/11/02, You're Hired!: In the spring of '02 Vince was looking for a new assistant, that turned out to be Stacy Keibler and why wouldn't he choose her.

#55, 9/4/01, Rob Van Dam vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin: Thanks to Angle and sensing that he was losing the faith of the Alliance locker room, Austin chose RVD as his opponent. Steve was intense working on RVD's back and neck, RVD tired hitting his usual moves but kept falling victim to Austin's aggression. After missing the frog splash Austin hit the stunner, Angle's music hit and RVD rolled up Steve to win the match. 6/10.

#54, Edge & Vickie: Quite a frightening set of clips showing Edge & Vickie's romance, funny though.

#53, 10/28/99, Austin Stalks DX: Kane and Rock fell victim to the 4 on 1 attacks by DX, but Austin was able to get to each member of DX with some funny traps then got all of them in a net in the middle of the ring, which brought out Kane and Rock to get their revenge.

#52, Debra's Cookies: The infamous favorite cookie recipe from Debra, that no one every seemed to enjoy. Pretty lame one on this countdown honestly.

#51, Stinkdown: The montage of Rikishi's stinkface, including when Booker T threw up on Michael Cole and then how Vince felt the wrath of the stinkface. Great moment.

#50, 5/29/03, WWE Tag Team Championship Match, Eddie Guerrero & Tajiri (Champions) vs. Team Angle: Unique tag match here, Team Angle took it to both men in the beginning as they looked to recapture the tag titles. Tajiri hit some great moves, including the Texas Tumbleweed on Shelton, then both hit a kick on each other at the same time. Haas and Benjamin worked on Tajiri's leg, then after a tag to Eddie he hit the 3 Amigos and the frog splash but Benjamin breaks it up. After a big kick Tajiri favored his knee, then Hass locked on the Haas of Pain, the bell rang (thanks to Eddie) and Eddie used some lying cheating and stealing with the tag belt and Haas was DQ'd. 7/10.

#49, 7/11/02, Rock & Busta: Nice segment with Rock and rapper Busta Rhymes cut a bit of a song in front of the crowd, a decent one here I guess.

#48, 12/19/08, Fate Fulfilled: Jeff Hardy won the WWE Title at Armageddon just 5 days before and on Smackdown there was quite a celebration, with confetti and tons of pyro.

#47, 9/12/02, Billy & Chuck's Wedding: Very funny wedding ceremony that doesn't go according to plan (do they ever in WWE?), the Godfather comes down to the ring and afterwards Billy & Chuck don't go through with it, which angers their manager Rico. Then the preacher turns out to be Eric Bischoff and 3 Minute Warning hit the ring and attack them and Stephanie. Side Note: I personally was shocked that Bischoff was the preacher and I thought this should've been higher on the list.

#46, 11/18/05, Tribute To Eddie: Some pretty touching moments from the first Smackdown after Eddie Guerrero tragically passed away. How this was not in the top 20 is beyond me.

#45, Where Is Foley?: After Mick Foley retired he became the commissioner and always had a unique location for his office in whatever arena they were in. Funny moments here.

#44, 9/9/99, A Classic Hit: During his last run in WWE Jeff Jarrett decided to target some of the women past and present in wrestling, on this night the woman was hall of famer The Fabulous Moolah. After she insulted him he hit her with a massive guitar shot.

#43, -7/15/04, Steel Cage Match for the WWE Title, Eddie Guerrero vs. JBL (Champion): This was easily one of the best steel cage matches ever done on live TV as both men brought the intensity and used the cage to inflict pain on the other. Eddie bounces JBL's head off of the cage a few times then misses a frog splash from the top rope, JBL hits a massive superplex from the top. Nice russian leg sweep from the top rope by Guerrero. Eddie takes a brutal hit into the cage the gets the Clothesline from Hell from JBL but only for a 2 count. Eddie hits frog splash from the top of the cage that would've made Jimmy Snuka proud, but after some time only got a 2 count. Some masked guy comes out and prevents Eddie from going over the top of the cage as JBL's feet hit the floor to retain his title. 10/10. Good post match with Eddie removing the mask of the guy to reveal its Kurt Angle.

#42, 10/31/02, Air Mysterio: While Rey Mysterio was facing Brock Lesnar, Big Show interfered and tossed Rey into the crowd.

#41, Noble & Nidia: Some clips of the southern couple Jamie Noble and Nidia, cheesy and sometimes funny, sometimes brutal.

#40, 7/4/02, WWE Undisputed Championship Match, The Undertaker (Champion) vs. Kurt Angle: Great, great match here, the Deadman was in rare form and Angle was picture perfect as both men just produced magic in the ring on this night. Taker used some good wrestling holds and his obvious power edge while we all know how good Angle is on the mat. Kurt reversed the Tombstone and locked on the ankle lock and refused to let it go, but Taker wouldn't tap out and was able to counter the hold, but got nailed with the Angle Slam but only for two. Taker went for the Last Ride, but Angle countered into a triangle choke and as the ref counted three Taker tapped out. After some debate with other refs the match is declared a draw and Taker remains the champ. 9/10. Kurt was angry about this and slapped on the ankle lock for a few seconds before releasing the hold.

Disc 3

#39, 3/23/00, Motherslapper: At the height of the McMahon/Helmsley faction storyline, Stephanie faced her mom in the ring and slapped her.

#38, 2/19/04, A Celebration To Remember: After beating Brock Lesnar for the WWE title at No Way Out, Eddie had a massive celebration, where he thanked all those who believed in him.

#37, 9/9/04, Big Show Returns: Eddie Guerrero and Kurt Angle were having a lumberjack match and at the end when some of the lumberjacks interfered, Big Show returned and laid waste to everyone and I mean everyone in the ring. He punched, press slammed, chopped and chokeslammed his way through all the superstars including Eddie and Kurt. Great return by Show.

#36, 3/24/05, Sexy Kurt: Leading up to their Wrestlemania 21 match, Kurt Angle was out to prove he could do everything Shawn Michaels did only Kurt could do it better. This time Angle brought out Sensational Sherri and ended up singing a rendition of HBK's theme... and it hurts the ears to say the least.

#35, 10/14/99, WWE Tag Team Championship Match, New Age Outlaws (Champions) vs. The Rock N Sock Connection: This was supposed to be the last time Rock and Mankind would team up and its not a bad tag match. Mankind was near the end of his career at this point and it showed as he had a hard time moving and Rock had to constantly save him, the Outlaws did their usual antics and double team moves. Near the end the Holly's interfere with Hardcore hitting Billy Gunn with the title belt and Mankind ends up covering to win the tag titles. 5/10.

#34, Houdini of Hardcore: Crash Holly was so confident in his ability to hold onto the Hardcore title that he said he would defend it 24/7, which led to many funny moments. Like him defending it at a kids playland and having to escape with it while getting a massage, great stuff here.

#33, 7/25/02, Mysterio Flies: After Edge wins a cage match, Test, Lance Storm and Christian interfere, John Cena comes in for the save but Rey ends up coming down, climbing up the cage and leaping off the top onto Storm and Christian.

#32, 9/26/08, Undertaker's Revenge: At Unforgiven Vickie Guerrero had Big Show punch out Taker, but the Phenom vowed to take Vickie's soul and he succeeded in gaining a measure of revenge hitting the Tombstone on Vickie.

#31, Divorce Court: Leading up to Wrestlemania X-Seven, Vince demanded a divorce from his wife Linda which led to Linda being medicated and subjected to seeing her husband cheat on her with Trish. Funny and creepy at the same time.

#30, 6/27/02, Kurt Angle vs. John Cena: Its the debut of Cena and he handles himself quite well, slapping Angle then hitting a big clothesline over the tope. He also displayed some good wrestling moves and Kurt was thrown off his game in the early going. Angle comes back hitting a few german suplexes and a front headlock, Cena comes back hitting a big powerslam but Kurt kicks out. Angle ended up locking on double arm lock and turned it into a pin to win the match. 7/10.

#29, 8/8/02, Icon Destruction: Highlights of Brock Lesnar vs. Hulk Hogan, where Hulk tried his best but Brock hit the F-5 then locked on a massive bearhug that causes internal bleeding and Hogan passes out from the pain. Brock then hits Hulk with a chair and walks off.

#28, 4/13/00, Get In My Belly: This was during the time when Big Show was doing all kinds of impressions and on this night he was Scottish and did a pretty good accent.

#27, 6/13/02, Bald Is Beautiful: Kurt lost a Hair vs. Hair match against Edge a couple of months before and he kept wearing a wig until Hulk Hogan and Triple H removed it.

#26, 4/8/04, Border Patrol: In the very beginning of the JBL character he decided to patrol the texas/mexican border and he sent any illegals that he found back to Mexico. Honestly this was one of the funniest things I've ever seen in wrestling or on TV period.

#25, 7/3/03, No Holds Barred Handicap Match, Stephanie McMahon & Zach Gowen vs. The Big Show: For those who don't know Gowen lost a leg to cancer when he was 8 but trained to become a wrestler and if he won this match he would get a contract. Its all about Show dominating both opponents while Zach hit a few moves a guy with one leg shouldn't be able to do. Brock Lesnar and Kurt Angle intefere on Zach and Steph's behalf hitting their finishers on Show, then Zach hit a one legged moonsault and made the cover to win. 6/10.

#24, 7/27/00, Right Place, Wrong Time: Triple H was showing Trish Stratus some wrestling moves, when he wife walked in to find them in a compromising position to say the least.

#23, 5/11/07, Ultimate Opprotunist: On this night Taker and Batista had a great cage match for the World title that ended in a draw, Mark Henry came down and laid waste to Taker then Edge came down and cashed in Money in the Bank on Taker to win the World title.

#22, 9/18/03, Angle vs. Lesnar: Clips are shown of their classic, classic Iron Man Match for the WWE Title, I know it was due to time constraints but it would've been really nice to have this in full on this set.

#21, 4/27/00, DX-Plosion: DX and the McMahon's kept looking for Austin throughout the night, they found him outside and he used a crane to drop a beam on the DX Express and blew it up.

#20, 1/13/06, Batista Forfeits The Title: During a match with Mark Henry, Batista suffered an injury that forced him to surrender the World title. Also included were moments from the over the top rope battle royal to crown a new champ and that ended up being Kurt Angle.

#19, 9/30/99, People's Elbow: We've seen it many times before but on this night Rock was in rare form as he glided across the mat and hit his patented elbow drop.

#18, 7/4/02, WWE Tag Team Championship Match, Hulk Hogan & Edge vs. Billy & Chuck (Champions): Good one here that saw Hogan hit his usual spots, while Edge did most of the heavy lifting. Billy & Chuck did display some good tag team wrestling as well and almost had the match won, but there was a double boot then two leg drops as Edge made the cover to win the tag titles with his childhood idol. 7/10.

#17, 8/24/00, Kurt Kisses Stephanie: The friendship of Steph and Kurt turns into a little more after Angle goes to the back to check on Steph and ends up kissing her. Pretty funny and expected moment.

#16, 2/10/05, JBL vs. Dollzilla: An idea gone horribly wrong as JBL gets shot with a tranq. dart much like the big show, but JBL just goes around in a doped up state and ends up picking a fight with a T-Rex blowup doll. Very enjoyable stuff here.

#15, 5/24/01, TLC III: Some clips of the first ever TLC match on broadcast TV, this also would've been a good match to have in full, but thanks to a certain event by a wrestler that can't be named it wasn't possible.

#14, 11/11/99, Blockbuster Champ: To promote his movie End of Days action icon Arnold Schwarzenegger wwas the guest on Smackdown. He even got in on the action in the main event as he got a shot in on Triple H. Good and memorable moment.

#13, 4/12/01, WWE Intercontinental Championship Match, Triple H (Champion) vs. Jeff Hardy: Earlier in the show Jeff attacked Triple H and Stone Cold, then hit a Twist of Fate on Stephanie, so Trips was looking for revenge and he hammered on Jeff, who able to come back and hit some of his trademark moves. While the ref was down Matt Hardy ran to the ring, hit Trips with a chair, then Jeff hit the Swanton and covered the Game to win the I.C. title. 6/10. It was called ""The Upset of the Decade"" and it was shocking at this time.

#12, 9/16/99, Champion Chairman: Triple H put the title on the line just to get a shot on Vince and Trips beat Vince up pretty badly, then Austin came down, hit the Stunner and put Vince on Trips and Vince won the title.

#11, Thuganomics: John Cena's best gimmick in my opinion, where he was a hip hop artist type and actually had some pretty good rhymes. Great clips featured here.

#10, Tribute to the Troops: Easily one of the best thing's WWE has ever done as they brought their show to the troops to let them know they aren't forgotten.

#9, 12/13/01, Supermarket Brawl: Booker T was beaten up by Stone Cold in a local supermarket and boy do I wish this was in full as this was such a fantastic and memorable segment.

#8, 9/26/02, No DQ match, Eddie Guerrero vs. Edge: Easily one of my favorite matches as everything just clicked. Plenty of hard hitting action, they use some great wrestling holds to start out and both used the various weapons well including ladder, even Eddie got busted open by Edge ramming him face first into it. Eddie hits a nice powerbomb on Edge from the ladder. Edge hits a massive Edgecution DDT from the top of a ladder for the win. 10/10. Nice standing ovation from the crowd, especially for Eddie who was a heel at the time.

#7, The Rock Says: A short montage of The Great One's best comments and one-liners, so funny.

#6, 11/11/99, Funeral Crasher: While Big Show and his family were mourning the loss of his dad, the Big Bossman crashed the ceremony and what followed was quite funny as Bossman dragged the casket away while Show was on top of it.

#5, 7/12/01, Austin & Angle-Unplugged: Stone Cold tried to cheer Vince up by singing and playing the guitar, when Kurt came in and tried playing Vince got up and left. Pretty funny.

#4, 4/29/99, The Pilot: Nice to include some shots of the first ever Smackdown, funny and memorable moments, like when the Corporate Ministry was introduced.

#3, 8/26/99, WWE Championship Match, Triple H (Champion) vs. The Rock, Special Guest Referee, Shawn Michaels: The first main event of the seasonal debut of Smackdown and it was quite a good one as all Rock/Triple H matches usually were. They battled up the ramp and Rock suplexed Trips on the stage then they worked their way back to the ring. Despite interference from Chyna and Shane McMahon, Rock hit the Rock Bottom and went for the People's Elbow and then..... Sweet Chin Music from Michaels, Trips hits the pedigree and covers to retain his title. 7/10.

#2, 6/12/03, The Bigger They Are: At the conclusion of a match between Big Show & Brock Lesnar, Brock hit a superplex on Show that broke the ring and shocked the announcers and the crowd.

#1, 9/13/01, 9-11 Tribute Show: Honestly would any other moment deserve to be #1? It was a great, emotional night that helped all of those affected by the tragedy of 9-11. Even if it only helped for a couple of hours it did start the healing process for many people.

Thats it, thats the list and its a good list though I do wish they had fleshed out a few of the moments and taken full advantage of the 3 hour running time of each of the DVDs. But what is here certainly was a good collection of moments and matches.",1316736000,2,28397,4.496114996114996

At least with this dvd set you get interesting things on all three dvds on like the raw dvd where you could just toss the third disc. The one thing that really pissed me off actually had nothing to do with the wwf(e), it was the number one spot, the 911 tribute and how wwf tried to honor the the lost lives of 10,000 civilians and how a big corporation could see past themselves for a moment......unlike.......THE WORLD WILDLIFE FUND. During a 911 tribute about a quarter of what you see is blurred because of their arrogant, selfish and pointless lawsuit. The world wildlife fund could not put their ego aside to honor the people that were lost in a violent tragedy. I'm actually glad they did this so the world could see their true colors. If they truly believed in the cause of protecting and preserving nature and wildlife they would have made an effort to use the logo confusion to their benefit to better their cause, they could have done a charity pay per view or something of that nature. At least I never donated any money to them.

In other words the dvd is pretty good the blurs suck",1272153600,,1262,4.3474576271186445

3904205,3,B002C6VMJS,"Reviewing something like the ""Best of Smackdown"" is very difficult because it's so subjective. Pick me & 9 other WWE fans at random, 10 superstars of Smackdown (past, present & intended future) plus 10 WWE commentators/refs/officials & backroom ""players"" like JR, Shane McMahon, Earl Hebner, et al, stick each of us down in front of 500+ episodes of Smackdown and all you can be sure of is that you are going to get 30 completely different lists of ""100 Best Moments"". My list would be completely different to The Rock's, Jeff Hardy's would be completely different to Earl Hebner's which would be nothing like Jim Ross's, etc. None of us can claim our list is more valid than the other 29 - sure, Batista is a wrestler, but I'm a fan, and it's us fans who keep WWE in profits, etc, but Batista is the guy out there putting his health on the line and walking the walk I can't and wouldn't even attempt.
So, what's good about this DVD - well, for a start (in my opinion) they've got the 100 BM pick more right than wrong (other reviewers have listed the matches/highlights, so I won't). When you're dealing with 500+ episodes of TV, and such amazing ""characters"" as The Undertaker, Eddie Guerrero, The Rock, Steve Austin, Matt Hardy, Jeff Hardy, The Big Show, Dave Batista, Rey Mysterio, etc., whittling your choices down is always going to be hard.
This DVD is a great nostalgia trip, WWE has tapped into that desire for feelgood ""do-you-remember-when"" reminiscing that we all do. Particularly if you are or have faced challenges/tragedies in your life in recent years, sitting down with a DVD and seeing something amusing, or cool, from back in 2000 or 2004  makes you smile and remember a time when life didn't suck quite as much, or when you watched a show together with a friend or loved one you lost, and that makes you remember happy memories of that person, instead of fresh grief at their loss.
The best thing about Smackdown - again purely my opinion - is that it connected with fans on level that RAW couldn't and still doesn't. RAW still seems to have that attitude that fans are just marks, that 'we're wrestlers you're just suckers' sensation; they seem to have that 'we will shove kayfabe in the faces of the fans regardless' which is patronising and insulting - although that's just my sense of it, which may be wrong. Smackdown has always had that tendency towards humour (admittedly occasionally puerile and OTT) but with the saving grace of being able to take it as well as dish it out - can you imagine the wrestlers on the RAW roster being as willing to send themselves up to the extent that their Smackdown colleagues are?
For example, and some of the moments showcased - The Big Show (who actually, does look better bald) letting himself be tranked and shaved? That takes guts and a solid sense of not being a jerk to allow someone to do that to you; again with ""Mattitude"" - it takes a talent for comedic timing, good acting talent and a willingness to look a complete berk in front of millions to pull off what Matt Hardy managed with Version 1.0, not to mention the utterly inspired idea of adopting the Ultimate Egomaniac's No. 1 Trait - referring to yourself in the third person, ""Matt likes guacamole""; it's disgraceful that Matt has never been able to achieve WWE Heavyweight Champion, given everything he has done for WWE. Smackdown was/is so good because ""Mattitude"" wasn't an isolated flash of brilliance - the Rock & Sock Connection was priceless - Mick Foley and Dwayne Johnson just lit up the screen whenever you put them together on camera. Kurt Angle also was hilarious - again, it takes a great deal of character to allow yourself to be made the butt of the joke in front of millions, like KA allowed ""Edge"" to do and also Steve Austin with those medals. What makes Smackdown work so well, I believe, is because the show and the wrestlers on it don't dishonour kayfabe, but at the same time don't insult and condescend to the fans with that 'smart marks' attitude - they invite us fans to join the kayfabe conspiracy as willing accomplices and we're all in it together for the ride, having fun. You get the sense of that watching the ""100 BM"". My final positive is that Smackdown rarely showcased that streak of spite and malice that RAW scriptwriters seemed to revel in - the humour only occasionally strayed into ""stupid"" instead of ""slapstick"" and only occasionally did you have ""drama"" that went too far, like the inappropriate storyline over Rey's young son - dragging a little boy into a televised storyline is not on - but, given the wholly unacceptable and deeply offensive antics on RAW (Edge & Lita's ""live sex scene"" was particularly puerile) over the years, Smackdown managed to stay on the right side of style and class.
So what's negative about it - well, again, this is purely subjective, but I'm sure many will share my ""you're kidding"" feelings - In my opinion, such things as the APA bar room brawl had no place in the top 500 never mind 100 - given that Smackdown has all that talent and so many moments to choose from, how that got remotely close is beyond me. Yes, Smackdown has always had more humour and been more respectful to the fans than RAW, but it is a sports show, about wrestling. Jeff Hardy finally winning WWE Heavyweight Championship (2008) and the tribute to the late, much missed Eddie Guerrero (2005) only made it into the back end of the 40s, yet non-wrestling 'events' like Jeff Jarrett wallop Mae Young & The Fabulous Moolah with a guitar beat out both? I'm sorry, but no.
 Secondly there's the pundits/interviews/commentators from the wrestlers and former managers/agents/bookers like Michael Hayes, Matt Striker and so forth. It's obvious that hours and hours of footage were filmed but nobody is really given the chance to say anything insightful, and particularly not the wrestlers; I would much rather have had a few more minutes of proper perspective from an articulate interviewee like Matt Hardy who can speak authoritatively about the physicality and technical aspects of the clip (and therefore put across just how brilliant it was/what an achievement it was for the person to pull off), and interviews at the relevent junctures with former Smackdown ""giants"" such as Mick Foley and The Rock rahter than ""Michael Hayes"". Again, The Miz gives soundbites - I have nothing against him, but he's only been WWE since 06, what about those that have been there from the beginning, like Rey Mysterio, etc., being given more airtime?
It would also have been innovative, fresh and insightful to have some commentating from the great, unsung and ignored heroes of the entire WWE - the referees who have the unenviable job of not being athletes and yet get stuck in the middle between two or more these large, angry louts on a weekly basis - Scott Armstrong (who just recently got dragged into a storyline ""match"" with CM Punk), and Brian Hebner, etc. Again, nothing against Michael Cole or Matt Striker, but why wasn't Jim Ross and/or Jerry ""The King"" Lawler commentating - those two have always had the best tag-team commentating chemistry with each other, and it is a pity they were ever split up, because they play so well off each other that having the pair of them argue and banter their way through the commentary would have been excellent and funny.
The final thing that would have made this DVD great instead of merely very good is that they should have included, as a bonus, at least two complete episodes in their entirity - the first ever episode of Smackdown to be broadcast, the 9/11 tribute episode (because WWE has never gotten the credit it deserves for being the first mainstream American entity to hold a large-scale gathering 2 days after the terrorist attacks of 9/11) and possibly one other - maybe the Eddie Guerrero tribute episode? Again, I'm sure everyone has their opinion on that.",1257811200,,7883,4.703328509406657

The DVD is hosted by longtime SmackDown announcer Michael Cole along with Matt Striker. This DVD is setup to count the top 100 moments of SmackDown however with the exception of the Billy & Chuck wedding & the matches, all the moments are strickly highlights. Some moments are actual recaps while others were just a highlights of moments with something in common (like ""The Rock Says..."" is a combination of his various promos). Most of the moments come with commentary from various WWE personalities such as Matt Hardy, John Cena, Santino Marella, William Regal, Todd Grisham, Michael Hayes, Matt Striker, Big Show, Mark Henry, C.M. Punk, Jerry Lawler, Candice Michelle, The Miz, Tommy Dreamer, Ron Simmons, Jesse/Slam Master J, Rey Mysterio, ""Brooklyn Brawler"" Steve Lombardi, The Brian Kendrick, Lillian Garcia, The Bella Twins, Kofi Kingston, Christian, and members of the McMahon family.

Undertaker vs. Randy Orton - This was the rubber match between the two men as Taker won at WrestleMania while Orton was victorious in the rematch at SummerSlam.  Both men traded momentum early on before Undertaker was able to take control heavily working over Orton's previously injured shoulder before Orton was able to take advantage of mistiming attempting to ground Undertaker in the ring & taking the match to the outside taking advantage of any distraction possible in a competitive match with the bigger story being what was brought to ringside that even had Undertaker himself in disbelieve at what he saw.
Sept. '05

Steel Cage Match: Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guerrero - This was the final encounter of their feud throughout the entire year as they started brawling with Rey getting the upper hand only to realize the cage restricted him from doing some of his signature moves causing him to improvise as Eddie went after Rey with aggressive offense such as a powerbomb & leg sweep from the top rope as they traded momentum fighting at the top of the cage & both men going aerial at one point where one man sacrificed himself just to deliver a move off the top rope to his opponent on the top turnbuckle as it ultimately came down to one man making the ultimate sacrifice that didn't pay off allowing the other to capitalize.

Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho vs. Chyna - This was Chyna's rematch after Jericho defeated her at the previous PPV to win the championship as both hit some big moves against each other in the early moments with Chyna taking a move out of the playbook of Great Muta while Jericho was able to use her momentum against her as they went back & forth with Chyna having one unique way of catching Jericho coming off the top rope along with Jericho using his trademark offense from a springboard position with a chair coming into play causing a confusing ending & eventually an even more controversial decision.
Dec. '99

United States Champion John Cena vs. Carlito - This was Carlito's debut as Cena came out very aggressive & due to being insulted earlier in the night taking the fight to the outside & using his power being more focused on punishing him than winning the match before Carlito was able to gain the advantage using Cena's own momentum against him & avoiding his offense when possible along with keeping him grounded to take away the power advantage as it ultimately came down to Carlito doing whatever he could to make one of the most impactful debuts in the history of the show.
Oct. '04

Tazz vs. Triple H - SmackDown was in Philadelphia, the hometown of ECW, in this rare battle of World Champions as Tazz challenged Triple H earlier in the night with Triple H attempting a cheap shot only for Tazz to beat him to it as they traded blows & clotheslines with both men taking advantage of the ringside environment as they traded momentum before things got out of hand & another man decided to get ""extreme"" what was nothing special past the historical circumstances.
Apr. '00

No Disqualification Match: WWE Undisputed Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Chris Jericho - Hogan was able to easily overpower Jericho early on including shoving him out of the ring to the outside causing Jericho to take shortcuts & use illegal tactics along with his trademark offense to have the momentum in his favor as they went back & forth with Hogan still relying on his power while Jericho used his speed & illegal tactics out of desperation as it took one man taking advantage of another's distractions to gain the victory here in a solid contest.

Jeff Hardy, Batista, Rey Mysterio, Finlay vs. M.V.P., J.B.L., Kane, The Brian Kendrick - This was a preview of the upcoming No Mercy PPV as some superstars had their PPV opponents on the opposite team as each member of the babyface team playing to their strengths such as Finlay's physical style & Batista using his power including a move with one of his partners that was a page out of the Andre & Snuka playbook with Hornswoggle also getting in on the action while the heels singled out one member of the other team keeping him in their half of the ring with dirty tactics such as outside interference & double teaming in a fun eight man tag that was the memorable for being the first match on the debut episode of SmackDown on it's new network (at the time) MyNetworkTV.
Oct. '08

Randy Orton vs. Hardcore Holly - This was the debut of Randy Orton who showcased some amateur skills early on with a take down & takeover only for Holly to ground & pound focused on beating his back & chest in what was a quick match with Orton making a good first impression.

Tables Match: The Rock vs. Dudley Boyz - This was the second match for The Rock that night with the stipulation that he had to put both Dudleys through a table to win the match as Rock brought the fight directly to them before they even got to the ring on the rampway & around ringside into the crowd using whatever he could get his hands on before the Dudleys used double teaming & taking advantage of the numbers advantage in a what this match was designed to be, a big brawl.
Mar. '00

Crusierweight Champion Matt Hardy vs. Rey Mysterio - Matt Hardy focused on the head & neck early on such as delivering a clothesline directly to the back of the head & pulling it against the ropes while also taking shortcuts such as his associates Shannon Moore & Crash Holly were making their presence known on the outside as well while switching focus to the lower body to the point where Rey was heavily showing the effects but Rey continued to fight on including using Matt's own moves against him as they traded momentum with both men coming off the top rope at different points to the point where one man had to catch the other to get the win.

Sept. '01

WWE Tag Team Champions Eddie Guerrero & Tajiri vs. Team Angle - Team Angle made it clear from the start that they were desperate to get their championships back before Kurt Angle was slated to return to SmackDown next week as they started the match attacking from behind & using illegal tactics behind the referee's back along with singling out a body part on one of their opponents heavily working it over with stretches & submissions while Tajiri relied on his stiff kicks & chops along with Eddie's trademark offense & using Team Angle against each other in a hot tag match with both teams trading momentum from start to finish.
May '03

Steel Cage Match: WWE Champion J.B.L. vs. Eddie Guerrero - They started trading fist right away with J.B.L. trying to escape after every big offensive move only for Eddie to keep catching him delivering his trademark offense such as the 3 Amigos while J.B.L. used his power such as catching Eddie into moves like the fallaway slam as they traded momentum delivering big maneuvers from a superplex to the leg sweep off the top rope & one of the biggest frog splashes in history while using the cage as a weapon to throw their opponent into or have their own momentum used against them to send themselves in to the cage to the point where both men were fighting at the top of the cage at one point in what was another physical bout between both men.

[Viva La Raza: The Legacy Of Eddie Guerrero]

WWE Undisputed Champion Undertaker vs. Kurt Angle - Undertaker wasn't 100% going into the match as he had a ladder match against Jeff Hardy earlier in the week but was able to over power Angle early on only for Angle to counter that with his wrestling skills only to lose momentum whenever he showboated or tried to beat Taker at his own game with strikes as they traded momentum with series of counters & escapes in a evenly matched encounter with Angle being able to do what nobody else has before him.
July '02

Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs. Rock N' Sock Connection - Mankind set this match up with The Rock stating that this would be the last time they would team together not knowing it was a tag title match as both teams traded momentum early with each taking the other down more than once before things got out of control causing two referees to separate both teams as they teams continued to go back & forth with each opponent having to have their tag partner come save them from defeat at one point with eventually one set of opponents fighting on one half of the team while their partners went at it on the outside as this match having an end result that surprised both teams in different way.
Oct. '99

John Cena vs. Kurt Angle - Kurt Angle issued an open challenge for anyone to take him on only for a rookie to answer his challenge with two words ""RUTHLESS AGGRESSION!"" and a slap taking the fight to angle both in & outside of the ring including countering or powering out of his signature offensive maneuvers as they traded momentum with each man having close near falls & Cena being able to just stay one step ahead of Angle as it ultimately came down to one man being able to catch the other but the bigger story here was definitely Cena leaving a strong first impression.

[John Cena: My Life]

No Holds Barred Match: Stephanie McMahon & Zack Gowan vs. Big Show - Mr. McMahon & Sable was in Big Show's corner as Zack Gowan would get a contract if they won as Show was just dominate easily showing both around actually chopping the shirt off of Gowan & taking off his prosthetic leg as Zack attempted to hit & move to no avail before Vince decided to get physically involved in the action only for the sides to eventually get even where this was more about putting a storyline over more than anything else.
July '03

World Tag Team Champions Billy & Chuck vs. Edge & Hulk Hogan - This was a dream situation for Edge as his childhood hero was Hulk Hogan to the point where he got the ticket to see him at WrestleMania VI & not only does he get the opportunity to team with him but it was also against the Tag Team Champions on the Fourth Of July holiday complete with Hogan coming out waving the American flag & his classic theme of ""Real American"" (Jimi Hendrix's ""Voodoo Child"" was his regular theme during this time). They were dominate early on against both men causing Billy & Chuck to single out Edge working him over with fast tags & double teaming with even Rico getting involved building to the eventual hot tag to Hogan. This was all about Edge having his special emotional moment with his childhood hero.

WWE Champion Triple H vs. The Rock w/special guest referee Shawn Michaels - This was the main event of the first ""regular"" episode of SmackDown with Commissioner Shawn Michaels as the referee as they traded momentum early on with the match unable to be contained in the ring with the brawl being taken up the ramp to moves executed on the metal stage with various associates around ringside getting involved in the action & paying for it in one way or another before you saw an ending that you didn't expect at that time setting the tone for what WWE wanted to do in making SmackDown a show where you had to tune in & see what happens.

Now it's obvious that some moments will not be included in here for one reason or another (Chris Benoit...but he was shown during the recap of TLC III) & there are some questionable choices for what is/isn't included along with the ranking of each moment (how can Eddie's tribute be so low compared to some of the stuff they put before it). The positives of moments & most of the matches outweigh the negatives so this is a DVD that a fan of WWE could enjoy. I highly recommend getting this.",1254009600,4,14939,4.586142322097379

3904230,4,B002C6VMJS,"From being a catch phrase of The Rock's to making it to network TV, over the decade of its exsistence, SmackDown has provided many memorable & entertaining moments throughout its history. If it was from the many historic & great matches SmackDown put on every night, its debut in 1999, being ""The Rock's Show"", the Thanksgiving tradition, Mr. McMahon becoming the WWE Champion, the 9-11 Tribute Show, Stone Cold Steve Austin hunting down DX, the likes of John Cena, Randy Orton, Rey Mysterio, & Carlito making their debuts, Mr. McMahon bringing back the nWo, the Billy & Chuck wedding skit, the return of Piper's Pit, Brock Lesnar & Kurt Angle going the distance, the first ever Tribute To The Troops show, the Eddie Guerrero & Jeff Hardy celebrations after winning their first WWE Championship, the arrival of Miiisssssstttteeeerrrrr Keeennneedddyy....Keeennneeddy, Edge living up to his ""Ultimate Opportunist"" name, or SmackDown moving to MyNetwork TV.

Possibably one of the best WWE Tag Team Title Matches in the history of SmackDown. Billy & Chuck worked very well as a team here & the fans were very into the match as well. Fantastic tag team match & a very emotional win for Edge personally. 4.5/5 [Match Also Available On ""Edge: Decade Of Decadence""]

Overall, I think WWE did a good job picking out some of SmackDown's greatest & most important moments throughout it's history. Though, I do disagree with some of the match decisions on this set. WWE should have definitely showed the entire Iron Man Match between Brock Lesnar & Kurt Angle along with showing TLC 3 & The Parking Lot Brawl in full length instead of showing highlights of those certain matches. One match I also thought that should have been included in this set was the Best 2-Out-Of-3 Falls Match for the WWE Tag Team Titles between Edge & Rey Mysterio and Kurt Angle & Chris Benoit as that match was a true classic. But again, WWE did a fine job here that everyone can & should appreciate all of the great moments & matches chosen for this set. This set is recommended.",1253664000,4,18455,4.488337320574162
3904231,4,B002C6VMJS,"I am only halfway through the collection, but I could not wait to post a review of my thoughts thus far.

First I think it's put together a lot better than the RAW set that came out a year or so ago. There are no annoying ""facts"" that pop up during the matches. The DVD collection features the top 100 segments, moments and matches from Smackdown's first 10 years on the air. I wish there was some explanation on how the moments were picked, but I think that the WWE just decided for us. Matt Striker and Michael Cole host the collection and they do a great job.

My analysis thus far is the set is great. I have had no issues with what has been picked, most of the segments are highlights or clipped, but nothing that ruins the intention of getting the point across. They show you enough footage to get the point across, and if you witnessed it the first time it's a nice reflection on some great moments. The matches that are shown in their full version, are shown in the broadcast version. meaning that there is a fade out and fade in during the commercial breaks. So far all the matches shown were worthy of being shown in their entirety. This is a great purchase for the longtime fan, or a nice way to see some great moments that make Smackdown a decent addition to WWE programming. Comments by current WWE superstars are far and few between, but they all come in at good times and often add a little light on something or a joke. Very well done.

If there is one thing to complain about it's the fact that Chris Benoit was such a big part of Smackdown, but since he is erased from the history books, matches with Austin or an incredible TLC match when Benoit teamed with Chris Jericho vs. The Dudley Boys (or was it the Hardy's?) of course are left off. However there is a lot of love given to Kurt Angle, Eddie Guerrero and Brock Lesnar so there is a lot to look forward to on this collection.

The transfer of the footage is great. I am really happy to have some of the older matches from 1999 and early 00's in DVD quality. I have a tape collection that spans 100 of hours of WWE programming, but EP quality on 10+ year old footage just does not hold up these days.

I'll offer an update once I finish the set, but I wanted to chime in as a former hardcore fan of the WWE since the mid 80's, I am very pleased with what WWE home video has done with this set.",1253664000,,2367,4.193406593406594
3904232,5,B002C6VMJS,"Smackdown has always (in my opinion) had a very solid roster and generally better wrestling that what you see on Raw every week.  This DVD set has tons of great moments that will take you back to the ""good old days"" when WWE was highly entertaining.  Yes, many of the moments are shown in clips and there aren't a lot of complete matches, but it still works (I have a short attention span, so this is perfect for me).  It's great to see old favorites like Kurt Angle, Brock Lesnar, Eddie Guererro, and The Rock on a single DVD compilation.  You even get John Cena's debut match against Angle, Brock vs Angle in the only nationally televised 1 hour Iron Man match in history, and of course Brock vs Big Show where the ring collapsed after the top-rope superplex!!  Well worth the money spent.  This DVD will remain in my collection forever.  Highly recommended.",1253664000,,860,4.545454545454546
3904233,5,B002C6VMJS,"you know some people are compairing this DVD to Raws 15th anniversary DVD and you know what from the reviews i read for that DVD made me not get it. i saw the smacdown dvd at FYE and said what the hell and i got it after i got it i saw the reviews saying that is was bad its the same as the raw dvd. then i popped it in and im loving, im glad to see some of this old stuff video back on the original smackdown.

im loving this dvd theres really no BAD thigs i can say on it but there are a lil few things that could have made this DVD over the top:

1. The Hosts: now i know that they couldn't really do anything on this but i would have really loved to see Cole and Tazz do the DVD but Taz is in TNA, so this one is a lost cause.

2. Todd Grisham: such and idiot OMG hate this guy now he is such a dork on this DVD. i saw someone say that the ppl who were talking about the moments sucked i beg to differ on that but todd just bombs on this he should have not been on this.

3. WWE should have tried to get the people that were in the moments on the DVD to talk about it. I mean some cant do it like Kurt, Tazz, Hogan, Billy Gun, Road Dogg, and others but there are some they could have tried to get that are not working in another company or that are still in good terms with WWE like Rock, Rico, and again others. and they should have def and the people that are still working with WWE and are in the moments on the DVD that should have been a givin.

4. On the title menus they should have put the different themes on smackdown on it. they shouldnt have just put the current theme on all 3 disks

there are many great parts to Santino is funny as all hell if i remember correctly he made a great joke around like 65,64 somewhere in the 60s. they give you a handfull of full matches thats was great. overall its a sick DVD to have in your WWE/Wrestling collection. And if this is what the Raw DVD is like im getting that one as well. I strongly say to you GET THIS DVD IF YOU WANT TO REMEMBER THE GREATNESS SMACKDOWN WAS AND SORT OF STILL IS!",1253577600,,2045,3.811320754716981
3904234,4,B002C6VMJS,"WWE: The Best of Smackdown - 10th Anniversary 1999-2009 is a pretty good DVD for a long time Smackdown! fan like myself. As others have mentioned some highlights should have been higher up than others, example Eddie Guerrero's tribute. There of course is a lot of editing I've noticed in the DVD. We all know about the WWF logo being censored all over the place,but at least this time they just censored the F instead of the whole W in some instances, of course its hard to censor good oh JR when he says WWF Title or something with the WWF in it so fast. I also noticed that some commentary was taken out for some odd reason,I would have to go back and watch the original episode to see what it was,but,it is weird hearing silence when you know Micheal Cole is saying something stupid or key point, not too much of a bother. And of course they have lost some rights to some music like Edge's Rob Zombie theme or Hulk Hogan's Voodoo Child theme by Jimi Hendrix, so they dub in Edge's You Think You Know Me theme or of course Real American for Hogan, I think Undertakers theme is also dubbed over. Ask for the super market brawl I was expecting that they would have it in full like they did the Billy & Chuck wedding,but sadly no just highlights and not to mention they even changed the commentary on that too! As said Chris Benoit is only seen for a brief second in only one of the highlights. Oh and this DVD is PG,can you believe that? Yep all the blood scenes, like when Mr. McMahon won the title, are put in black and white, seriously I can understand if this was on TV, but this is a DVD I payed for, for crying out loud,it should be TV-14 just as it was back then and should be now! I would have loved to see a 4th disc with maybe the pilot episode on it or the 9/11 tribute show,maybe when the fist set was first put into place and heck even the tribute to the troops show would have been nice, maybe one day they will release seasons of the show and win the rights back to the WWF initials. Oh and one more thing,where is the Rock? Where is Stone Cold,Chris Jericho,Undertaker,Edge,Batista, hell even Michael Cole seriously, some of the key people that made Smackdown! why are they not interviewed on the DVD, I mean its nice to see the young talent commenting on the moments but as the Rock would say, ""It doesn't matter what you think! This is the Rock's show Smackdown!"" Speaking of Cole,wheres the moment where Stone Cold beat him up, rather when Stone Cold beat up JR as well. And even Stone Cold,I mean,there should be a few more moments with him in it,like when Mr. McMahon turned out all the lights and Stone Cold surprised him or how about when he chased the NWO and captured Scott Hall. All and all, the DVD is a great piece of Smackdown! history and should be in anyone's WWE collection that has loved and will always love Smackdown! And for the new people that have recently started to watch the show,see what defined an era in the history of the best show ever on Thursday now Friday Nights.",1253577600,,3012,4.304577464788732
3904235,4,B002C6VMJS,"There's an optical illusion that I first saw when the dvd was being advertised on tv. Mick Foley is on the cover, look directly at the cover of the dvd and walk backwards about three feet, maybe more, it shows Mick Foley in a blue T shirt with lightning bolts on it. I'm sure it was unintentional, but the question is raised since he was the color commentator on Smackdown. Look at any image, especially if it is small you will see it right away. Stare at the strap on the undertakers shoulder on eddie guerrero's side and Mick will magically appear. Now go look like a bad ass and show your friends.",1253491200,,600,4.31858407079646
3904236,3,B002C6VMJS,"When I first read about this DVD I was excited to see some of the stuff on it. One of the segments I was really hyped to see was the grocery store brawl between Austin and Booker T. I received the DVD in the mail and sat down to watch it and boy was I disappointed. None of the segments are whole, its just highlights with different WWE stars talking about them. The matches are whole though(There are some matches that are just clips like the Kurt Angle/Brock Lesnar Iron Man match, Eddie Guerrero vs John Cena Parking lot brawl, and some others)

The clips and full matches are done in a top 100 countdown style. Even though segments aren't whole, it is still a decent DVD though. I have to give this DVD 3 out 5 stars, Mostly because of the matches and some of the highlights they show are for segments and matches I totally forgot about(Like Tazz vs Triple H match) or, segments I enjoyed when I first saw them back in the day and it's fun to relive them. I recommend this DVD to wrestling fans but, I wouldn't spend more then 20 on it.",1253404800,3,1040,4.226130653266332
3904237,3,B002C6VMJS,"Overall, worth a purchase if you'd like to watch wrestling when it was still good. However, the Brock Lesnar-Kurt Angle match IS NOT in its entirety.

Here's to holding out hope for a Brock DVD set in the future to include the match. Though, there is a lot of great suff among the 3 discs.",1253145600,2,408,4.311688311688312
