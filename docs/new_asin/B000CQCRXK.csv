8100284,5,B000CQCRXK,"I've always tossed caution into the wind when screenwriting gurus fling their one-stop theories on the screenwriting trade my way.  I've invested in the Syd Field theories and a phalanx of other hypothetical approaches, all of which have their various similarities and differences.  Nowadays, with the advent of blogs and cheap domains for website authors, everybody has a chance to chuck their opinions to the cyber world.

However, each of these gurus have some pretty good ideas; it's the ability of the screenwriter to discern which of these ideas has any merit, and which ideas are given by pontificating, seem-to-know-it-all blow-hards.

In my mind, Robert Flaxman, presenter of the ""Seducing the Reader"" DVD, via the 2005 Creative Screenwriting Expo, has proven to offer a multitude of the former, teaching his take on how to make your script Hollywood-ready and offering said ideas in an easily digestible and entertaining fashion.  It's relatively easy: Robert Flaxman's simplistic delivery and straight-forward approach to passing the gate keepers of Hollywood - those Readers who read your script at the behest of an executive, agent, manger, etc. -- offers the wannabe (intermediate) screenwriter the essential tools for creating an entertaining read.

Most of what Flaxman covered could be considered common knowledge amongst in-the-know intermediate writers who have a decent grasp on the craft.  But Flaxman's DVD can prove to be an invaluable resource for writers wishing to brush up on their craft or wanting to polish up their script before they send it out into the world.

From explaining how to make slug lines visually appealing, to discussing the sheer importance of brevity, Flaxman breaks down the process in an efficient manger.  He gives a bare bones description of how to create drama within your script, all with the hopes of keeping the reader interested, and not picking up another script.  Whether it be fielding questions from the audience, or expressing pure passion in a particular topic, Flaxman kept the pace going and interests piqued.

One of the main benefits to adding this DVD in your collection is that you get a bit more out of each viewing, meaning that there's a chance you may not have picked up on certain ideas the first go-around.  Most of this info could be picked up on web sites or blogs, but viewing the presentation and hearing the words help drill the ideas into the brain.

The actual layout of the DVD is pretty simplistic, with options that include Robert Flaxman's presentation and an additional Q&A session.  The duration of Flaxman's actual presentation goes a little over an hour; really, that's all you need.

Again, and I can't stress this enough, this DVD is geared more towards the intermediate, or brave newbie, screenwriter.  This is focused towards writers who may have a few scripts under their belt, who wish to have their scripts in good shape for studio readers.  And, to that effect, Robert Flaxman does a stellar job at giving those writers the correct tools and knowledge to do as much.",1171065600,3,3063,5.045634920634921
8100285,5,B000CQCRXK,"I had the chance to see Robert Flaxman give his lecture at the 2005 Screenwriting Expo, and he was quite simply, along with Michael Hauge, the most informative and dynamic speaker at the Expo (it's always good to be reminded of the constellation of things we already know and intermittently forget). His lecture is so critical, interesting, entertaining, and funny (screenwriting humor), I purchased this DVD (at the Expo store) right after his lecture. It is worth watching just before starting a new screenplay and right after (during the revision phase).

A couple of us got the chance to speak with him at the Expo and tried to coax him into writing the book version of his lecture.

I almost hate to give away an advantage (really), for he provides some serious tools you will be hard-pressed to find elsewhere. It's not about seducing the Studio Reader; it's about writing a readable and imaginable screenplay.

You will find yourself watching it a number of times a year just to remind yourself of the details of writing a screenplay which have taken a back seat to plot, structure, characters, theme, etc.",1142380800,5,1113,4.847368421052631
