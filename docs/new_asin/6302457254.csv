The drama was excellent, at times I had to pause it just to collect myself.  This is a movie that you can watch with the whole family.

This is one of the few films you can purchase about Harriet Tubman. I certainly believe we need an updated version as well that will include more history emphasizing her underground railroad experiences. She assisted more than 300 slaves following the north star to freedom, reciving the title, A Woman Called Moses. I believe it is a collectors item well worth having.",1464307200,,501,4.704545454545454

472968,5,6302457254,"A must for Black historians of all races, colors & creeds. Cicely Tyson was the greatest Black actress of her time. In this historical epic she transforms into Harriet Ross Tubman, founder of the Underground Railroad, who risked her life to lead hundreds of slaves to freedom in the North BEFORE the Civil War.  She also aided the Union Army as a reconnaisance agent, mobilizing black troops, freeing slaves and staging raids on plantations. For those she helped get to The Promised Land she became known as ""Moses"".In this great production Cicely is supported by Will (Grand Pa Walton) Geer in his final performance and Robert Hooks & James Wainwright. With narration by the legendary Orson (War of the worlds) Wells.",1426636800,12,718,4.933884297520661

Some people believe that her greatest role was most likely, Sounder.  That's a role that she is better known in, but I don't care what others think, I enjoyed this movie when it first (originally) aired back in the late 1970s and I thought it was pretty good.  Even though I've since found out that the Underground Railroad was not (by any stretch of the imagination) a clandestine operation--because white slave traders were fully aware of it's existence and I've discovered  (through history) that a lot of escaped slaves were (actually) turned in while participating in the Underground Railroad.  I'm not (exactly) sure if Harriet Tubman (the main character) was the culprit, but I know that some of the escapees were caught by slave catchers seeking to recapture their lost properties.",1425513600,,911,4.967105263157895

473319,4,6302457254,"Cicely Tyson gets to show what she's made of playing a woman who was apparently made of pure steel: Harriet Tubman. She had a hell of a time as a slave, although occasionally given opportunities other slaves didn't get. She had a hell of a time escaping to land in Philadelphia among a group of staunch abolitionists, many of whom were Quakers and many of the rest were escaped slaves themselves. But she decided to go back and become a conductor -- no, more like an engineer -- on the Underground Railroad. History tells us she brought hundreds to freedom, but never lost a single ""passenger."" But Cicely Tyson, at the top of her career, does not tell us, she shows us.

I do not think I saw this made-for-TV movie before, but one scene is so familiar that I suspect I saw an excerpt or perhaps one episode of the series. The master who had given her opportunities (and took half of the money she earned selling the vegetables she grew) turned on her in a most humiliating way. He tricked her into pulling a fully-laden cart, saying the mule had run off. But all along the roadway were his elegant white friends, making bets on how well she would do.

Still, she saved the money she earned, and finally had as much as she had heard her master (the other one was the one she was loaned out to) say she was worth: $200. She took it to him to buy her freedom, only to have him say she was worth more than $1,000.

Another unusual aspect of her life is that her husband was a freedman, at least in a way. Apparently he had to pay for freeman papers, which expired. So he ""borrowed"" her freedom money to pay for his own freedom. Real nice guy.

Anyway, this is a heart-wrenching story which is also very inspiring. You get a chance to see what real courage is, and why modern-day African-Americans are way tougher than you might think. Because Tubman and people like her are indeed in their blood, and in their cultural heritage as well, and they can do what they need to do. And so we have an African-American president and a lot of really superior people walking around in brown skin.

And of course we whites can be proud, too, to the extent we can identify with the abolitionists who risked their lives to help them. I'm proud of the fact that the Pennsylvania Dutch were active in the underground railroad. In fact, my grandparents' old farm house had a hideaway in the basement which I am told was a stop on the railroad. We used it for a root cellar and storage of my grandmother's canned fruit and vegetables.

For too long, we have been told to be ashamed of our history of slavery. But we also have a history of fighting against it and defeating it.",1336867200,3,2655,4.364372469635628

If you are looking for a blue-ray rendition - well perhaps you might have to wait as long as I had to wait, until my son got his 2 new front teeth back in!  This is a historical film.  I see negative remarks related to the film's reproducution qualities.  Yes, they could be better. Perhaps one day we get a better, clearer, sharper version. But however misty, murky or clear the film's repro will be,  it pales to the message it gives.  A historical voice, the voice of mankind, an ennobling desire to be free under any circumstances. FREE.  Looking back at history, various people and nations were made into slaves, but the desire for freedom never dies.
I have not seen all of Ms Tyson's films, but would think that this film is her crowning role.

We watched this after we chose Harriet Tubmann as the subject of my kid's essay for herioc historical figures. We picked a figure that we did not know anything about and would learn about at every turn of the research. This is such a well done portrayal of someone who was truly a historic American superhero. And she was a former slave and a woman! That's puts her life on a bigger plane than someone like Daniel Boone or Geaorge Washington.

473385,3,6302457254,"I guess I need to explain my three stars as having nothing to do with the content of this movie. So I'll present the pros first,then the cons. Well obviously I watched this 70's TV movie (well on DVD that is) because I see Harriet Tubman as an often forgotten American hero who not only formed the ""underground railroad"" and personally led many slaves to freedom in the north but her later involvment in the Civil War and her later crusades for the early stirrings of woman's rights in the suffergete movement. I read books about her as a child and Harriet Tubman is even the subject of a painting I made a few years ago. Cicily Tyson does an incredible job as Harriet,who starts out a slave of course,bitter and angry at the injustices around her. She endures many of the humiliations accorded to slaves (including being used on one occasion as a human mule) and the equally demeaning concept of her and her husband having to ""buy their way"" to freedom. In her disgust against this system she turns her energy toward creating a system allowing slaves to escape to the northern states to be free people. The movie plays out her transition from a broken down slave into a confident woman ""called moses"". Orson Welles adds a narration to the affair. So the actual content of the movie is wonderful and I think everyone interested in any type of history and social injuctice being undone should definately see this. The minus side has to do with the reason this gets only three stars from me-the movie itself is five stars all the way but the presentation does in fact leave a lot to be desired. It's apparent that this DVD was transferred from a VHS tape and even that being the case it looks like it was taped directly off of TV as the series aired. There has been zero effort to enhance the quality of the picture let alone remaster the movie. And that does a great disservice to this classic.
