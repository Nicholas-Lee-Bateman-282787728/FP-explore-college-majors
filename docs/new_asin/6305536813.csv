1043956,5,6305536813,"Ok, wrong movie-- but regardless whether she is bothered by neck dwelling prickly things or not, after ""Navi,"" Lain is begging to be unraveled. In ""Knights,"" it's seems that we'll finally see Lain's ball of truths untwine. Instead we discover it's loops and knots, all through an unceasing collage of imagery and sound that leaves our senses bruised and us meandering with Lain and her world. Ever get a cut or bruise and wonder how they got there? The answers lie within the layers of the Serial Experiments: Lain series.  Not for the attention-challenged.
Technically, there really isn't anything to add that hasn't already been said. Like volume 1, the quality of the transfer, both in video and sound (even if it's only 2.0 DD), once again hold up beautifully. This series is truly a reference piece for Anime on DVD. As before, there are Japanese and English audio tracks as well as English subtitles available. I don't know if it's just my copy, but I picked up two obvious errors (not a translation nit-picking) in the subs that seems to have slipped passed the editors. One is clearly a complete thought in dialogue left incomplete in the subs. The other is completely technical, where the english subtitle falls on top of a sub/caption thats there when sub is off. Oh well, I guess you've seen it all, no big deal.
As for supplements, it may seem lacking, but what _is_ there just makes the great, greater. It might not seem like a big deal but I really appreciate the option to watch the opening intro without the credit text! Also, I haven't watched much anime in a while, but I'm glad to see there are still people who preserve the original work when it makes it overseas.  Specifically concerning the soundtrack, wherein some U.S. Anime distributors, who originally have nothing to do with the work itself, decide to take it upon themselves to change this and that, because ""it's better this and that way."" Since when did idiocy take precedence over the artists original work? 3!",936748800,20,1992,4.737752161383285
1043957,5,6305536813,"This is the kind of intelligent, incredible, totally thought provoking series you will never see on American TV.  I had to watch all the episodes twice to take it all in, and I need to watch it a few more times.  I admit  I like the subs better than the dubs (that's the beauty of DVD, you get  both).  The dubbing is good, and being an ""anime purist"" since  the 80's, that is high praise.  I don't remember feeling this way about an  Anime since I saw Video Girl Ai the first time, another excellent series I  had to watch over and over to take it all in.  They both have an instant  grip that gets you involved with the characters.  I can't wait for the next  volume (Lain:Deus already pre-ordered here!!)",936057600,,707,4.265151515151516
1044008,4,6305536813,"The 2nd lain disk just adds to the confusion. But it draws you so, bits and pieces of the overall story are hinted at but as a whole you're left with a strangely hollow feeling.  I know that sounds like a terrible review, strangely its meant to be the exact opposite.  After watching this I went straight back to amazon to order the next disk.",992390400,,343,4.2615384615384615
1044009,5,6305536813,"First of all, to those people who give poor rating on this episode, I just want to say something. How can you assume that the story is not good if you start watching the second Disc. My suggestion for you is to get the first  disc before commenting on the show.
Now, to my review of the story, I  still give this disc a 5 star rating because even though the plot has  thickened, there are still some unanswered questions, and better still,  there were new confusion added (like what happened to her sis?,  Was Lain  on the wired or was she in wherever she was?, etc).They began to tell us  who or what is ""Knight"", what they do and what is their plan.  Overall, I still think it's a very good disc. I didn't, I don't and I won't  regret owning this DVD.",958089600,5,753,4.173611111111111
1044010,5,6305536813,"Serial experiment Lain is perhaps the best anime i have seen on the year. However, in order to really hope to understand it you will need a lot of patience and go through the four discs. On the Knights disc the plot  thickens and a lot of weird things keep happening to Lain, there are three  layers on this DVD (distortion, kids and society), all three fit into the  story in a strange kind of way leaving more questions open than revealed.  If you really want to understand what is really going on wait for the  fourth disc (Deus) and the stunning conclusion (Reset). As far as the  quality of the anime goes, the image is crisp and the sound great, the  voice acting is very good and i liked both the english and the japanese  versions. Try it and be amazed!",957744000,5,761,4.309859154929577
1044011,5,6305536813,"If you buy only one tape of Serial Experiments Lain(Which is a really bad idea), make this the one. Not only does this raise the most interesting questions, but some of the best plot twists occur here, including what  happens to Lain's sister, Mika.
If you want an anime to keep you up at  night, either with thought or with chills, make this it.",953164800,6,346,4.390625
1044012,5,6305536813,"In this second volume Lain becomes aware of the strange reality of the wired network, which seems to have an existence on its own. As soon as some questions from the first volume are answered, others rise, as we get inside  Lain's double life in the real and wired worlds. At the end, you will be  longing for the third volume.",948240000,4,327,4.344262295081967
1044013,5,6305536813,"The second Lain DVD, containing 3 more episodes.  Begins to answer some of the questions about the Knights, and the Men In Black.  Delves deeper into Lain's split personality, and raises questions about her true purpose.  The  second part to an excellent story.",947030400,,261,5.0
1044014,4,6305536813,"This 2nd installment of the Lain series lives up to the first.  Still spooky, but now some of the questions get answered, especially is the final episode which is a real mind-bender.
I did sorta want to have more  answers.  Lain gives up her secrets reluctantly.",943315200,6,262,4.6521739130434785
1044015,5,6305536813,"But oh, so much more interesting than those films.  Keeps you guessing and thinking.  I like this kind of anime so much...I can not wait until I get  Deus and Reset on DVD.  This series is great!!!",941241600,,197,4.243243243243243
1044016,5,6305536813,"Serial Experiments Lain is an awesome anime to begin with but it sure looks excellent on DVD!  Plus you get both Dubbed and subbed in one, both  of them rock!  But forget the technical stuff the storyline is superb!  Buy  this already!",940982400,2,235,4.5

7891021,4,6305536813,"Lain is great.  All of it.  It's a bit dark, goes in for a few anime tropes, and isn't terribly energetic but it's also quite unique, well-scored, and very atmospheric.  Give it a watch.",1414281600,,186,4.411764705882353
7891022,5,6305536813,cool and werid !!,1413244800,,17,3.5
7891023,3,6305536813,I choose 3 stars because it didn't suck because I have the first volume of Lain but this second volume was so confusing. and Lain is such a weird child. I couldn't really follow what was supposed to be going on. I mean if you like to pay close attention to whatever you're watching and like to have to think about and understand what's going on then this is the series for you. The story line is too complicated for me. I mean I don't really get the point of it all. I don't think I will buy volume 3 or 4 to complete the series. I'm not saying this is a bad show but its just not for me.,1366761600,,588,3.908333333333333
7891024,1,6305536813,Received volume. 3 in volume. 2 case.  It also took forever to get. Extremely disappointing. You should check the cases before there sent.,1364342400,,138,5.0
7891025,5,6305536813,"So many layers to Lain. Is she or isn't she? But sucha question isn't answered simply. Probably would require a PhD. But for the rest of us, the elegant design and ambiguous audio can keep us entertained. This anime is of a see- and-see-again sort. Each time I've seen the series (three, I think)I come upon more thought-starters. And yes, most are philosophic, in a wired sense. (And if my view seems lofty, I'll finish with a guess that even pre- ten youngsters will understand what's what with Lain. If they're computer-

savvy.)",1177632000,,532,4.720430107526882
7891026,5,6305536813,I love it! The series takes some crazy twists in this one,1168387200,,57,3.8333333333333335
7891027,2,6305536813,"Lain is beginning to question the very nature of reality itself as she starts to suspect that she has a double inhabiting the Wired. This version of herself seems to have complete autonomy and does bad things, like hacking into government computer systems and even messing up her sister's mind in the real world. We also begin to get some information about the online game a lot of kids are playing which is connected to a top secret experiment on psychic children. And what is the mission of the two guys outside Lain's house who have Borg-like attachments on their eyes and whose only purpose seems to be shining red laserlights on her. Whose side are they on?

While the first volume was interesting and tantalizing, after watching these episodes, I feel that Lain is beginning its downward swan dive into crumminess. While I know I am watching animation, to me this show mainly consists of a girl staring at a computer screen and having shocked after shocked look on her face as her friends tell her what her alter ego did the day before. The whole thing seems very stagnant because you could start with Episode 6 and understand just about as much as you have watching Lain from Episode 1. I'm beginning to think there's just nothing here.",1126915200,,1243,4.65
7891028,5,6305536813,"If you approach this series expecting the ordinary, or even a somewhat imaginative approach to the theme of where the line between real and virtual are you are in for a shock.  There is little about this story that is comfortable, and much that is deeply disquieting.  Ryutaro Nakamura is intent in placing the viewer in Lain's experiences, intentionally creating the same perceptual and intellectual confusion.
The question probed in this DVD continued to be who or what is the real Lain.  These episodes fracture the appearance of waif-like innocence that Lain wore in the first DVD.  Not completely, though.  Only enough so that it is clear that a much brasher and more forward young woman exists in the same mind.  Even this simplifies her personality boundaries, as her sister is also consumed by the changes within Lain.
Sharing the 'wired' with her are desperate geeks trying to gain admission to the 'Knights,' a closed hacker society that is driven by secret, and perhaps deadly purposes.  And in the 'real' world men in dark suits follow her and question her very existence.  While her Navi grows into a water-cooled monster that swallows her entire room.  Time and again, we have to wonder whose perceptions are we following, as our vision fragments and then heals in kaleidoscopic patterns.  Into this strangeness step parents, strangers and friends who seem to only stop by to pronounce philosophically and then vanish back into the surfaces.
The artwork continues to be remarkable.  This isn't so much an animated series as it is a designed film.  By which I mean that rather than a flow of action, we are presented with images and symbols that glue themselves like wallpaper on the inside of our minds, returning repeatedly to haunt us.  This is creative, experimental work, which draws the viewer forward despite forebodings of a final bleak vision that will never leave.  This is a demonstration of anime's real potential as an art form, rather than simple entertainment.",1050537600,5,1988,4.966767371601208
