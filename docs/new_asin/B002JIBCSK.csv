8371496,1,B002JIBCSK,"Good Lord?  Not an opera, not a musical, not even a more or less decent hybrid.  A ridiculously poor libretto, mediocre music,
an absurd production!  A real waste of time and money, particularly after the recent and superb DVD's of ""The Perfect American"" and ""Anna Nichole"".  I definitely plan NOT to play it again, ever.",1478390400,,321,4.781818181818182
