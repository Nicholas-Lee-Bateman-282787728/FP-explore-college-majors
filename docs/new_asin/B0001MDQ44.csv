2014570,5,B0001MDQ44,Excellent piece of work. This is what a good band should sound like live. I see so many of the newer bands on TV playing live and quite honestly if I paid to see it I'd feel cheated. This DVD is a must for any Doobie Fan.,1084060800,,221,3.723404255319149
2014571,5,B0001MDQ44,"Considering I have bought some bad DVD's and some Great DVD's, I am going to have to buy two of these, since I will probably wear this one out rather quickly.  I had been waiting for a Doobie DVD for quite some time, getting little snippets along the way with their appearance on Michael McDonald and Friend's DVD, and the on the Farm Aid DVD.  But this is classic 'kick butt' Doobie music!  A well designed set list for the DVD, stating off with Dangerous, just so you'll get geared up with your foot tappin' to a super song.  All of the guys do an excellent, no, make that out freakin standing job, playing some of the best music of their's from the 70's and 80's.  I will agree with the other reviewer, John McFee does a fantastic pickin job on the dobro, his electric, and also the pedal steel.  A song that he and Pat does 'Soquel Rag' demonstrates just how talented these two guys are.  Pat, well Pat is Pat, he just another piece of the stropng Backbone of a super Doobie Brother, what can I say?  Let's not throw any dirt on Tom either, he picks up and plays the old Doobie licks like when I was standing right near the stage back in the 70's.  Fade to several songs with Michael McDonald sitting in with the band and you have the complete bunch!  Couple this with the dual drummers, Keith and Mike, and dual saxophones, Skylark plunkin the bass and fillin' in with his vocals, and you have what we have always had, the best dang Doobie music in a long time.  These guys are timeless!  In closing, you better go buy this DVD, it's one of those like the Eagle's 'Hell Freezes Over' or Fleetwood Mac's 'The Dance' that won't last on the shelves long when everyone finds out just how great the sound is on this album.",1082332800,20,1722,4.2972136222910216
2014572,5,B0001MDQ44,"Just picked up this DVD this evening, not even knowing that it just came out and it was a great investment. The sound mix is mostly great (except on one Pat Simmons solo that just wasn't given the punch it deserved from the mixer). Otherwise, this is a great show, many of the best tunes, original vocals, great rhythm section as usual for the Doobies and they still sound as tight and professional as ever. They look like they're having a good time and the venue being small and built for sound brings this show to life on the home screen. If you were ever a Doobies fan, this is a must have DVD.",1080950400,4,597,4.245614035087719

2014625,5,B0001MDQ44,"I can't add much to what's already been said so I'll just heartily agree with the rave reviews. They are right on. I want express my thanks to those who take the time to comment, both good and bad.  I almost won't buy a box of toothpicks unless Amazon reviewers agree that it's a good deal.  It's easy to waste money on music especially.  I've found that most reviewers are as passionate as I and know what they're talking about.  Who would waste their time writing/reading music reviews otherwise?

I only recently became interested in live music, including video concerts, and it has added a new dimension for me.  I thought that the Doobies ""Farewell Tour"" 1982 at Greek Theater was outstanding (per most reviews) and I was actually depressed that 1) It was so long ago 2) It was their ""farewell"".  I went, 'wait, that was great why would they quit now?'. So relieved to find they were still in business afterwards.

Hard to believe that this ""Rockin'"" concert is at least as good if not better in some ways.  Fans of ""Long Train Runnin'"" will be blown away, as I was.  It's simply spectacular.  As was ""What a Fool Believes"".  Two of my favorites.  ""Slot Key Soquel Rag"" was new to me and I love it.  My brother is a pretty good guitarist and I told him that he was in for a real treat.  He hasn't seen either of these concerts although he's a DB fan also.

Anyway, heartfelt thanks to you reviewers.  I especially value your further music/concert recommendations.  Sometimes takes me down roads I wouldn't normally travel and I'd miss a lot.  Thanks to you for your time and expertise and Amazon for supporting this amazing resource!",1407628800,2,1638,4.5479452054794525

2014663,5,B0001MDQ44,"Don't let negative reviews stop you from buying this DVD like they almost did me. It looks and sounds great.  What a trio Johnston (he's intense), Simmons and McFee make.  And the rest of the band, especially the bass player, Skylark, are awesome. This concert makes me realize how very rocking many of the 70's and 80's bands were.  If you are looking for Michael McDonald tho, he only does three songs, but frankly, they didn't need him. It's sad to note that since this 1996 show, both drummers, Knudsen & Hossack, as well as Cornelius Bumpas, have passed away. And Skylark has had a stroke and is in recovery.",1366675200,,613,4.554545454545455

2014665,5,B0001MDQ44,"This video serves to remind you once again how incredibly talented these guys were and what great musicians they were.  A very tight playing band, great vocals.  Their sheer talent shines through.  This concert will not dissapoint you.  Quality was pretty good and the sound was great.  If I had to say one negative thing it would be that the first half of this was a compilation of songs that I personally was not really familiar with but then the second half is all the much loved favourites.  It might have been better if they had mixed it up a little.  Other than that, use your song selection list and pick your fav's.",1359936000,,623,4.460176991150442
2014666,5,B0001MDQ44,My fav band of the 70s 80s and their new recent stuff is great too.  If you want more pick up Tom Johnstons CDs as well.  Simply a great concert that brought back many memories of seeing them live over 10 times from the 70s to last (2012) year.  I think they are sounding better now than ever.  A must have for the concert collector.,1358035200,,333,4.076923076923077
2014667,5,B0001MDQ44,"The Doobies in concert is always a treat. Tight vocals, musicianship at its best, multiple guitars, double drums and percussion, and a double DVD offering to boot !

I bought this DVD a couple years ago and have really enjoyed playing it over and over. Shortly after, I picked up their latest CD World Gone Crazy which was fantastic to say the least.

You can always expect the unexpected from the Doobies during a live concert performance. The signature sound, the mystical lyrics, are typical vintage Doobies.

So much diversity, a representation of so many musical styles. Blues, Jazz, rock and roll. The Doobies ruled the airwaves back in the 70's and have returned full force recently with their World Gone Crazy CD. Let's hope they keep rockin' down the highway.

This concert DVD is a must for Dobbie Brother fans.",1347926400,,821,4.801418439716312
2014678,4,B0001MDQ44,"The Doobie Brothers: Rocking Down the Highway The Wildlife Concert (1996) is a nicely put together production that combines live material from two different venues, with interview clips with members of the band, to provide a package that attempts to bridge the gap between time periods, and provide a little perspective regarding the band's long history.  The bulk of the show features the 1996 incarnation of band, fronted by guitarists Patrick Simmons and Tom Johnson, in live performances in New York.  In the middle, there scene shifts to the Starwood Amphitheater in Nashville, where Michael McDonald joins the band for three of his best known Doobie hits.  After which, we return to the Sony Music Studio for an energetic conclusion.

The 108 minute production features the band playing most of their hits, along with a nice dose of newer material, as the band displays versatility, musical skill, and enthusiasm that is great to see.  The Doobies first became noticed for their hard rocking tunes that often seemed to be inspired by California's free-wheeling lifestyle.  With twin drummers, and creative songwriting and instrumentation, the band soon proved that they were capable of great diversity.  Their sound underwent a huge makeover after Michael McDonald joined the band, leading to their greatest commercial success.  When the band reformed in the late 1980's minus McDonald, but with Tom Johnson back, the Doobies returned to their rock roots.  The addition of versatile John McFee provides the band with a third talented guitarist.

The nod to the McDonald era is a nice touch, and the band also includes some acoustic numbers, but the Doobies are really rockers at heart and seem to be the most at home on their early classic hits China Grove, Jesus Is Just Alright, Rockin' Down The Highway, Neal's Fandango, Without You, and Take Me In Your Arms (Rock Me).  When the harmonica kicks in on the solo break to Long Train Runnin', it's a solid reminder of what this band was about when they first broke onto the scene.  The newer tunes while not having quite the same impact, still have the band's traditional sound, and Slow Burn, Excited, Wild Ride, and The Doctor, are all very solid.  The show tastefully closes with an acoustic version of Listen To The Music.

The primary venue, the Sony Music Studio in New York, is quite intimate, and features the band on a low stage surrounded on three sides by the audience.  The concert is edited fairly well, and features some pretty good views of the performance, utilizing some suspended movable cameras.  Near the end the audience starts to obstruct some of the shots, but until then the views are mostly clear.  Today, some 15 years after this performance was recorded, the Doobie Brothers are still together and performing live.  This DVD is solidly recommended to fans of the band.",1319932800,,2851,4.953781512605042
2014679,5,B0001MDQ44,The Song Slow Burn is a Killer New Song On This Cd. That Song Alone Is Worth Having The Cd. I Just Wish They Would Make a Studio Version Of This My Favorite Song By Them.,1319760000,,170,3.75
2014680,2,B0001MDQ44,"I was really looking forward to seeing this dvd as i have the audio (CDs), but i was disappointed to notice that the audio does not synchronize with the video. I hope Amazon will have the policy in place to replace the copy that was shipped tot me. Being a musician and a concert player it is very disturbing having to watch a musician make a move and hear the sound after two seconds.

2014681,5,B0001MDQ44,"WOW...the Doobies probably at their best! The rendition of 'Without Love' is worth the price of admission alone in my opinion. But the whole DVD set is just great. Yes, the NY audience is a bit 'faculty lounge' at first...but it picks up and they get up and party. The section where they bring in Mike McDonald at the Nashville concert is a great insert and blends well with the main concert in NY. The in between interviews adds a lot too, telling stories and what the Doobies are all about. Like Mike McDonald says... ""Once a Doobie, Always a Doobie"".
The close studio set up in NY is a plus in my opinion as it really gives an up close and personal feel. Great camera work and sound. Great song line up. An awesome live performance of all their great great songs.

Tom Johnston's energy and enthusiasm was contagious (although sometimes over the top).  They did all the hits and a few lesser songs, ""Without You"" a particular highlight.  The editing leaves a little to be desired because every 2 or 3 songs the video would pause and then jump to the next song (a little annoying), not very smooth splicing of the video.",1265587200,,570,4.68

2014711,5,B0001MDQ44,"The Doobie Brothers is a eclectic collection of superb musicians who get together from time to time and play the widest variety of music of any band in history - with the possible exception of the Beatles.  But while the Beatles played tributes to early American rock and roll, the Doobie Brothers cover the modern era from motown to to Hawaiian, with special emphasis on outstanding saxaphone, guitar, and percussion.
This album has some of the best of the Doobies, captured in the sterile environment of a studio in New York - and there have been some criticisms of the audience and the environment, and there's no question but that there is a difference in the feel and emotion that comes from a small studio audience compared to the stadium size audience at Wolf Trap.  But the music, and the talent, are top notch - and it captures the widest variety of Doobie talent, since it includes Michael McDonald.
The technology used in this mid 90's video is not up to the standards of the Wolf Trap video, and you have to make sure you have a fast DVD player to get the music synched to the video.  In Wolf Trap the editor had tools that made it possible to jump cut perfectly in synch with the music - and the video cuts are done in perfect rhythm with the drums and the guitar notes - making for a visually and audibly satisfying experience that is not quite captured in this video.  But any criticism of the venue or the audience in this video misses the mark - this is a rare glimpse indeed into a happy moment in American musical history when great musical talent came together with extraordinary arrangements.  The Doobies play a wide variety of musical styles - with energy and enthisiasm that puts a smile on the faces in the crowd.  My advice is get this DVD, also get the wolf trap video, and also get the audio cd's of each of these CD's, as well as the Best of the Doobies audio CD's so you can hear the studio versions of the live performances.  The closest thing that compares to seeing the Doobie Brothers in these videos, was the moment nearly 20 years ago when Michael Jordan and Charles Barkely, playing in the NBA championship game, were caught by the TV camera, looking at one another and smiling from ear to ear, laughing really, revelling in the glory of the moment, of being at the top of their game on top of the world.  This video has some of that spirit, less than the Wolf Trap video, but enough to make it worthwhile.",1200614400,,2443,4.4375
2014712,5,B0001MDQ44,"This DVD rocks! The performance is excellent as is the audio/video and post production. One area I scrutinize is the post production. I do not put up with the super fast scene changes that some editors feel they must have in their DVD's. This DVD has none of that, thankfully.

I thoroughly enjoy watching the Doobies on this DVD and am glad I purchased it. You won't go wrong making this purchase.",1164240000,3,398,4.527777777777778

I crossed my fingers when I bought this, knowing full well that these guys are just a few years older than I am!  After watching and hearing the performance I would have paid twice the amount and still thought I got a bargain.  The only ones missing were Porter, Hartman, and Baxter.  Watching the show gave me goose bumps at times as I thought back to those good ol' days when the band was my favorite in the early 70's.  The quality of the sound and the choice of songs were excellent.  This is a must DVD for any serious Doobie Brothers fan ... especially if you always thought the Doobies were not the Doobies without Tom Johnston",1156032000,,726,4.262773722627737
2014714,5,B0001MDQ44,"A fellow ""old guy"", I've been a fan of the Doobie Brothers since I first played the ""The Captain and Me"" on an ancient turntable back in college.  They sounded great then and they still sound terrific today. What made them wonderful then has helped to keep them enduring today.  That quality is their ability to adapt musically.  Throughout their evolution as a band the Doobies have shown that they can make any type of music sound great - from rock to jazz to the blues.  They certainly get to show off their stuff on this DVD that contains their 1996 performance at the Sony Studios in New York City. The added bonus on this DVD, of course, is the three songs from ex-Doobie Michael McDonald from an earlier gig in Nashville.

The picture, sound quality, and lighting all add together for a great concert.  Tommy Johnston is at his rocking best and as always, Pat Simmons balances Johnston's energy with some tight acoustical guitar playing of his own.  Add the extremely talented and versatile John McFee, the dynamic drumming duo of Mike Hossack and Keith Knudsen, the soulful Conelius Bumpus (at his best once again on ""Jesus is Just Alright""), and the frenetic bass playing of Skylark and you have the ingredients for a memorable concert experience.

Many of the Doobie's hits are present in this 20-song concert including:  ""Rockin' Down the Highway"", South City Midnight Lady"", ""Black Water"", ""The Doctor"", ""Jesus is Just Alright"", ""Take Me in Your Arms"", the Michael McDonald set that features, ""Takin' It to the Streets"", Minute By Minute"", & ""What a Fool Believes"", and the great culminating trio of songs:  ""Long Train Runnin'"", ""China Grove"", and ""Listen to the Music"".

Throw in some lesser played gems like ""Without You"", ""Clear As the Driven Snow"", and ""Excited"" and you have a concert DVD that rocks in Dolby 5.1 surround sound and is one that you will play over and over.  Not just for Doobie fans, but for anyone who loves good music (and an eclectic assortment, at that!).

Also highly recommended is the Doobie's great concert from 2004 entitled, ""Live at Wolf Trap"".",1153180800,2,2089,4.7855153203342615
2014715,5,B0001MDQ44,"From a technical standpoint this DVD is a marvel of sound and

style. The band is on their game from the opening intro to ""Dangerous""right through to their raucous interpretation of ""Listen To The Music"". Part time Doobie Michael McDonald appears to do justice to his three biggest contributions to this former bar band turned quality rock band. Pat Simmons fires off some great solos on ""Jesus Is Just Alright"" and is vocally as clear and defined as in his heydey. Tom Johnson is very enthusuastic thoughout and really gets into ""The Doctor"", that 1980's reworking of ""China Grove"" that might actually cook more than ""Grove"" itself.

Some great surprises musically include ""Excited"", ""Clear As The Driven Snow"", ""Wild Ride"" and ""Without You"". There is some great behind-thescenes dialogue featuring various band members telling their story. The sound quality of this performance is excellent and the live versions do great homage to the studio tracks we've come to know and love. I would highly recommend this DVD even to the casual Doobies fan. Rockin' down the highway has never been quite this enjoyable! A+",1152144000,,1111,5.032608695652174

2014717,5,B0001MDQ44,"As a long time Doobie Brothers fan, I've been looking for a really good concert DVD.  I first purchased the ""Live At the Wolf Trap"" DVD, and while it was good and the performances were top notch, there were too many horns for my taste.  I bought this and took it home to watch and my only reaction was ""WOW!  This is the DVD I've been looking for."".  Tom Johnston and Pat Simmons are front and center on this DVD, as it should be.  All of the songs and performances are great, especially ""China Grove"", ""Long Train Runnin'"", ""Listen To the Music"", ""The Doctor"", ""Dangerous"", and my favorite Doobie's songs ""South City Midnight Lady"" and ""Clear As the Driven Snow"".  The Doobie Brothers are, in my opinion, one of the five best bands ever and this DVD does nothing to change my mind.  WOW!!!!!!!!!!",1147737600,2,797,4.493055555555555
2014748,5,B0001MDQ44,"This is simply a great DVD concert!  I did have one slight issue however.  I nearly gave a 4 star rating simply because it is a ""little"" missleading.  Mike McDonald is live with the band, but it is only for 3 songs, and the concert shifts to another earlier concert for those 3 songs.  With that being said both shows are typical great Doobie Concerts.  I have seen them live once and as always you get your moneys worth.  This one has great sound, photography, and no silly add in effects.  Well worth it!",1144022400,2,506,4.319148936170213
2014749,5,B0001MDQ44,"Mega dittoes that this is a great concert, well performed by all. But one reviewer needs to clear the fog from their early '70s memory...Tiran Porter did not sing the ""Jesus, he's my friend..."" part on the studio version of ""Jesus is just alright."" It was sung by Pat Simmons, and I don't know why he doesn't sing it live. Maybe they're just trying to get Cornelius Bumpus' voice (which is excellent) into the lead vocal mix! Great show!!",1139875200,,438,4.556962025316456
2014750,5,B0001MDQ44,"The more I play this DVD, the more I get into it.  The sound reproduction is great and the musicians really get into it.  With this DVD, I crank up the sound and before too long, find myself totally caught up in the performance...just as if I were there. I'm sure my neighbors have enjoyed this concert lately, when my system is turned up (I live in my own house with the nearest neighbor several hundred feet away).

Also, the band members seem to eventually connect with the audiance (and visa versa).  The chemistry works between the members of the band, and between the band and the audience. This DVD makes me wish I had practiced just alittle more on my guitar when I was younger. Shoot, not just on my guitar, but on all my instruments.

These guys shine; really rock, not just at their age, but at anybodys age.  Some really great stuff on this DVD.

Get this DVD.  And if you have a decent surround sound system, turn it up and loose yourself in the performance.",1134950400,,971,4.385474860335195

I mean you just can't help but feel the exitment of the music!!your feet just start moving to the beat of the music...and who is watching the audience anyway! My favorite part is of course the number one song of the dvd ""Listen to the Music""(sorry Michael MacDonald)but that song is the greatest rock song ever written! Team that up with Minute by Minute and Long Train Running and you have the best rock music video of all time...even if you aren't a Doobies fan..you will be after watching this dvd!!The Doobie Brothers put their best effort on this dvd ...buy it!",1133049600,2,766,4.439716312056738

Its a great concert good sound great songs, I only took one star off because some songs are missing that I know they performed like 'Dependin on You' 'Another Park Another Sunday' and 'Eyes of silver'. The interviews are informative too it was great to find out that Tom Johnston and Michael McDonald are great mates I was never sure what went on there. Still don't know what happened to there long time bass player Tiran Porter though? Anyway this is definately one for the collection. For mine it's the 'Doobie Brothers' and 'Chicago' every time.",1105401600,2,637,4.5
2014755,5,B0001MDQ44,"I was completely blown away by this DVD.  The overall quality is just as good as Fleetwood Mac's ""The Dance"" and the Eagles ""Hell Freezes Over,"" two of the benchmarks for music DVDs.  The show is taken from two 1996 venues:  the majority of the show is from from NYC, while Michael McDonald joins them for 3 songs from Nashville.  Pat Simmons, Tom Johnston and Michael Hossack are the only original members in this lineup but the robust cast of other musicians are more than capable, and they almost ALL sing at some point.  It's not very often that a show just gels but this one does, every song is great and the band puts their heart into all of them.  I agree with the review of ""Clear as the Driven Snow,"" the song is almost hypnotic with its guitars and flute.  Doobie fans will love this DVD, and anyone who appreciates musical talent will enjoy it too.  Pat Simmons sounds as good as ever and Tom Johnston has only lost a high note or two.  To the reviewer who said the show was interrupted with interviews...you should have selected the ""just play the concert"" option.  I also disagree with the reviewers who said the NYC audience ruined the show.  They started out a little reserved but by the end of the show they were dancing in the aisles.  Total bargain at this price for almost 2 hours of great music.",1103241600,10,1315,4.410788381742739

2014768,5,B0001MDQ44,"I sometimes marvel at reviews that Amazon buyers leave here! Who cares about the audience? Now I'll give you the truth, this is a great show! The band offers up a well organized song list from their many years. They include Michael McDonald who was ""Down The Highway"" in Nashville. They cover enough material well, to let any Doobie fan feel like they got what they paid for.

If you know who they are but are not a REAL fan, than pass this offering up. If you are a fan... BUY IT, You'll like it. 'Nuff said!",1098748800,14,509,4.247422680412371
2014769,3,B0001MDQ44,"I guess my expectations for this DVD were set way too high.

I saw this band perform live back in the 1970's and was very impressed with their live sound and rock solid performances.  Now over 20 years later...they are a little tired I suppose and not giving it their best.  The vocals on ""Long Train Running"" and the music/sound mix on ""South City Midnight Lady"" were not 5 stars worthy.  Micheal McDonald's ""three song set"" was way too short...they could have had him sing at least five songs....after all,he wrote and produced some of their best material.

I also don't enjoy concert footage that keeps being interrupted by interviews with band members, between each of the songs!  Isn't that was the ""extra's"" and ""special features"" sections are for on most artist's DVD's?

The more I think about this particular show...I will rate it only ""3"" stars!!! (I had originally given it 4!)

It could have been much better...and frankly, it should have been much better performed, recorded and produced.  This band has way too many excellent hit songs and years of live performance experience, for them to put this ""mediocre of a product"" out!",1094860800,8,1141,4.81025641025641
2014770,5,B0001MDQ44,"I had to revise my review after reading the ""Lame Audience Ruins the Show"" review. While I agree the audience is lame, I don't believe this fact by itself ruins the show. While the overall energy level of the musicians is definately affected by the (mostly seated) stuffed shirt audience, I still highly recommend this DVD to anyone who likes the Doobies. The bottom line is that the positives far outweigh the one negative in this otherwise excellent performance.

This DVD is a Wildlife Preservation Society benefit concert originally recorded for a television broadcast in 1996. The Doobies have had many different lineups through the years. But with Tom Johnson, Pat Simmons, and Michael McDonald appearing together in this concert - all the songs are sung by the original recording vocalists! The one exception to this is that Tiran Porter was not there to sing the ""Jesus, he's my friend"" break in Jesus Is Just Alright. However, Corneius Bumpus does an excellent job filling in for him.

There is a menu option to bypass the musician interviews that occur between some of the songs. When played this way the transition from one song to the next is a bit abrupt. But that's just a minor annoyance, I'm really glad they included this option. And when played with interview segments included, they don't actually cut into the middle of songs like I've seen happen on other concert videos (Allman Brothers at Great Woods, for instance).

Sound quality is excellent and video quality is excellent too.

Doobie Brothers lineup: Tom Johnson, Pat Simmons, Micheal McDonald, Keith Knudsen, Mike Hossack, John McFee, Skylark, Dale Ockerman, Danny Hill.

2014771,3,B0001MDQ44,"Now that I have begun to collect live music DVDs in earnest, I am ashamed to admit that I, despite being a musician, have begun for the first time really to recognize and appreciate the effect that an audience and venue have on a live musical performance; the observation in the world of books that the author is one half the book, the reader the other half, I have discovered, may apply to a great extent in the world of live music. As audience members, we want to know that we are not the only ones possessed with the spirit of the show, and as musicians, we want to know that we are creating that spirit, and all of us want the image of the venue to live on in our hearts and minds.

 I had high hopes for this Doobies video after reading the solid reviews on amazon. But what I encountered was the lamest audience that I have ever seen, possibly even worse than Paul Simon's French ""You're the One"" DVD audience. Clearly, the audience members for the Doobies show did not come to the show because they were Doobies fans, but because they were given tickets to come. Much of the crowd, dressed in business attire, sits as still as statues throughout the show. Tom Johnston really has his work cut out for him as he tries to inspire the audience to ""listen to the music.""

 The vibe shifts considerably when the band moves momentarily from this NY T.V. audience venue to an outdoor Nashville stage. The Nashville performance is notable for its much larger audience of obvious fans, as well as the inclusion of Michael McD. This shift gets me thinking about two things: the Doobies deserved and could have been given a much better, much livelier video, and Michael McDonald is a gifted song writer and musician who doesn't deserve all the crap he gets. Even if Michael and the Doobies aren't quite one anymore, this Nashville performance is the highlight of the DVD.

 One last complaint about this video is that many of the supporting musicians, most notably the totally jammin' bass player, don't get much acknowledgement, either from the camera or the band. All of the musicians, not just the original members, made the music in this show.

 Why buy this DVD, other than the fact that it seems to be the only live Doobies DVD? Well, Tom J. is rockin', and his voice is just about as strong as ever. And the rest of the original band is looking great. The Doobies are a special group, and even if this DVD doesn't do them justice, it cannot fail but remind us of why we love them.",1091404800,13,2483,4.453744493392071
