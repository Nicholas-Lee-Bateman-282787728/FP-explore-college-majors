5404014,4,B00AADAEBW,Aside from the ending being a little unclear this a good movie. Not too boring. Good quality actors IMO. Story is decent too.,1353801600,,125,4.478260869565218
5404065,5,B00AADAEBW,i loved parker posey in this movie...she's hilarious.....she does a great job...this will increase my interest in her other movies.,1389312000,,131,5.6
5404066,5,B00AADAEBW,"Posey Parker is super funny in this movie!  She is so natural in her role as new boss in town; never missing a beat.
The movie is very entertaining and with a good message.  This is clearly an example of how superficial, and cunning someone can get to be when they want to be first to win this rat race.",1378252800,,303,4.033333333333333
5404067,3,B00AADAEBW,The movie was okay. There was some plot holes in the movie though. It was a good insight in the office place.,1377561600,,109,4.0
5404068,1,B00AADAEBW,"This movie was such a let down, featuring characters that were scummy and here was no redemption of these characters and their missable lives.",1375315200,3,142,4.958333333333333
5404069,3,B00AADAEBW,"Love Parker Posey, and she was great in this, as usual. Rest of the cast was good as well. But overall I just felt kinda ""meh"" after.",1370995200,2,133,3.962962962962963
5404070,4,B00AADAEBW,"Too bad comedic performances don't often get nominated for Oscars ... this one should have been. Perhaps best known from some of Christopher Guest's faux documentaries, Posey really comes through here ... and the ensemble cast was as good as the department that is supposed to be coming together to advance Posey's character's marketing plans to catapult an old brand store into the modern era and record-breaking sales. You'll actually get the strategies she's talking about and that are out there, too. You might draw comparisons with The Office; since I have hardly ever watched that, they hardly mattered to me. Unfortunately, what I was left with at the end overall was a mite depressing; I'm still thinking about what it all means. But, basically, a wonderful ensemble effort, well directed and shot ... good production values, didn't feel like a low-budget movie. Worth a popcorn-crunching watch.

P.S. Eric Mabius -- as his wife played by Annie Parisse, I've missed her since she was in Law & Order, says at a department party, ""Woo wee!"" The guy who did Doug was funny as heck in his subtle way. In general, sturdy acting drives this little classic.",1370649600,,1158,4.908163265306122
5404071,5,B00AADAEBW,"Price Check was a very pleasant suprise.  I'm a huge Parker Posey fan.  I find her very quirky and sexy as well as talented.  I think she is the most overlooked actress of our time.  This film was excellent.  I don't want to give anything away, but I thought this film might fall into the indie formula trap, but it didn't.  It has a unique ending and ends on a positive realistic note.  That is all I can say if I've said enough.  But all the actors were excellent in this film.  I thought this might be a strange independent film, and watched it on Netflix.  It was a bit strange since Parker Posey is a little strange - in the best way, but this movie suprised me.  If you are a Parker Posey fan, it's a must see and a very good performance for her.  Maybe one of her best.  She looks great, her character is realistic and driven but at the same time over the top.  Not many actresses can claim this ability.  I was just thinking of who Parker Posey reminds me of - I'd say the female Tim Curry (who I love very much as an actor as well as musically) but they are so unique and so incredibly talented.  This movie is excellent, because it's very real.  No major suprises, no flaws either.  I'm very suprised this didn't do well at the box office.  It's an extremely solid movie.  If you like the show ""THE OFFICE"" - you'd love this movie.  I give it 5 stars because it is well acted, I thought the storyline was smart and edgy.  Parker Posey is fantastic, so are all the actors - the husband and wife were great.  But everyone was.  It's a movie I want people to see because it's so solid.  It's a comedy, it's ridiculous, but it's real in it's own strange way.  Plus I give it 5 stars because of Parker Posey.  She really knows what movies to be in, and that is a talent all by itself - she really is a wonderful actress.  If you like her as an actress, you will probably love this film.  She is one of a kind, and sometimes being one of a kind is everything.  This movie shows that energy.  It won't be your favorite movie, but I think you will like it.  It's FUN - SILLY - REAL - QUIRKY - GOOD STORY - NICE ENDING.  I will watch for this director, he told an effective, likeable, fun, enjoyable film.  He made the actors fun and I loved this movie.  I'd like to watch it again at Christmastime.  Parker Posey hats off again, you really do command every scene your in, you make yourself look great and everyone who is in the scene with you.",1370390400,,2445,4.127659574468085
5404072,4,B00AADAEBW,"The 2012 movie PRICE CHECK takes us behind the scenes of the supermarket industry.  However, not a film about what goes into barcodes, PRICE CHECK presents a young male executive on the rise in the corporate office side of the business.  His new female boss, played with high energy by the fine actor Parker Posey, is about to affect both his career and marriage.  Until that point, he wishes he could still be working at the small record label he left to take this job and start a family.  Now the man is not so sure, between the possibilities with the new direct superior and how well it goes when he meets the big boss, the ever-impressive Edward Herrmann in that role.

Even if I wanted to blow the story, getting into what happens after that in PRICE CHECK would be beside the point.  I think the movie takes place in the roller coaster enterprise of retail sales to underscore how so much in our lives can be upended by what we can't control, the only choices being to take it or leave it.

The closing scenes of PRICE CHECK could very well prove the opening of its next chapter were it a miniseries or epic-length film.  Instead, its midsentence cut-off reminds us there's no conclusion to real life, just what comes our way next, even though we planned something else.

See PRICE CHECK.",1369094400,,1294,4.495726495726496
5404073,2,B00AADAEBW,"Sorry to say, I could not watch the entire movie.
Parker Posey played a complete wacked out lady within a loser script that should never have been written.",1368921600,4,155,4.571428571428571
5404074,4,B00AADAEBW,"I was an entertaining movie.  I enjoyed watching it, but it was not a movie I would watch multiple times.",1368489600,,105,4.25
5404085,4,B00AADAEBW,"I thought this movie was really well done. Sort of an interesting take on a typically formulaic theme (cheating) plus a look into what happens when people ""go corporate"".

Parker Posey's character is pretty fantastic and the soundtrack was also excellent, highlighting the band Dean & Britta with a great live music scene in the middle of the film at a club in LA. There are funny parts, and serious parts too. I would definitely recommend this film.",1367107200,,450,4.769230769230769
5404086,3,B00AADAEBW,"Here is a comedy-drama that didn't quite live up to being either a comedy or drama.  There are funny moments, and dramatic moments, but the film never found it's bearing and left me wondering if it could have been better.
Parker Posey's character is offbeat, funny, and spot-on for an over the top, not listening to you type of power-driven manager/executive.  She does her best to carry the film, and does most of the time, but it's the poor writing that keeps it from making it memorable.
The ending is disappointing.  Without spoiling the film, we jump ahead to the future and are left to assume that loose ends are tied up and problems resolved nice and neat.  However, it is a cheap way to leave us wondering: is that it?",1364688000,6,726,4.519083969465649
5404087,4,B00AADAEBW,"Parker Posey is so enjoyable, as always.  The rest of the cast is also very good.  The male lead does a great job of poignantly, through subtlety and ""valued"" calm, expressing the impact of the choices we make and their consequences.  There is ""loudness"" in his ""quietness"".",1364515200,,274,4.787234042553192

5404091,5,B00AADAEBW,...this is the movie for you. I'm a big Parker Posey fan and she did not disappoint. I'm surprised this didn't make a bigger splash in the theaters because the acting and story line all around are really sharp and funny.,1358899200,5,220,4.390243902439025
5404092,4,B00AADAEBW,"Posey plays the highly combustiable corporate savior whose great at managing teams of worker bees but can't manage her own life.  She's an amazing actress in this cinematic version of ""The Office.""  She alone makes this story about office politics well worth the time and the money.",1356912000,3,282,4.9787234042553195
5404093,4,B00AADAEBW,"I'll bet you never wondered what goes on behind the scenes in your local supermarket: why items are placed where they are, what equipment is used for the checkers, when specials are planned and how careers are made or ruined based on the success or failure of these decisions.

Screening audiences attending this 2012 Seattle International Film Festival entry from the USA will never wonder; we got to watch these corporate shenanigans in living color!

We saw:
  * Parker Posey (""Inside Out"") is a recently hired dynamo brought in to re-energize this mid-size supermarket chain. Her take-no-prisoners style is immediately obvious when she fires a high-timer unjustly, simply so she can re-invest his significant salary on promotional material.
  * Eric Mabius (Lots of TV) is a frustrated music industry professional, temporarily (he hopes) side-tracked into supermarket management. He is seduced by the siren song of success, with a salary increase and unexpected temptation. All his boss wants in return (she says) is his loyalty.
  * Annie Parisse (""The Amazing Spider-Man"") is our hero's wife, proud of his work ethic and really proud of his promotion! She even might be willing to overlook a thing or two....
  * Cheyenne Jackson (""Lola Versus"") is a man from that dynamo's past, who has nothing nice to say about her! He stands his ground with her though, which is more than most men.
  * Julia Bray (Lots of TV) is quite the surprise. Downtrodden, overlooked and derided, she suddenly finds her inner loyal employee and delivers a great motivational speech.

As a veteran of the corporate world, I felt the discussions around the planning table had a ring of authenticity, although the percent increase they are discussing sounds waaaay out of line for the grocery business! Safeway and Kroegers should be so lucky!

I'll be glad when Amazon carries the DVD. I want to add this to my Cheyenne Jackson collection.",1355443200,3,1920,5.0157728706624605
5404094,4,B00AADAEBW,Parker posey is liakeable even when she plays a horrible character. The film is entertaining and I think it was well worth the money,1353801600,,132,4.541666666666667
8549034,3,B00AADAEBW,Oddly funny.,1521331200,,12,5.5
8549035,2,B00AADAEBW,"Like many other reviewers, I love Parker Posey. I've seen almost every film she's been in. (Not so much the TV shows she's appeared in).

But Price Check was disappointing. The story was a mix of boring and unpleasant (because of the characters' poor moral choices). Posey's character was unsympathetic. Posey can sometimes make a bad character sympathetic, but she has nothing to work with here.

Judging by the film's description (a corporate setting), I thought this would be another&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clockwatchers/dp/B000B5XP4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clockwatchers</a>&nbsp;-- my favorite Posey film. But Price Check lacked Clockwatchers's humanity and humor. Price Check is NOT a comedy. (Or, if it's meant to be a comedy, it's not funny.) It's been a while since I saw this film, but as I recall, this married guy expects a promotion. Instead, Posey is brought in to be his new boss. Then she pressures him to sleep with her, despite the man being married. A dark film with an unpleasant ending.

Seems that most of Posey's film can be divided into two categories -- great films (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dinner-At-Freds/dp/B074TNTW9L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dinner At Freds</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Henry-Fool/dp/B0000E5NQ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Henry Fool</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Daytrippers/dp/B00004STRF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Daytrippers</a>, and Clockwatchers), and crappy films that are only worth a look because she's in it (e.g.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Love-Guide/dp/B008AYV4WG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Love Guide</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Misadventures-of-Margaret/dp/B0009IE4DC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Misadventures of Margaret</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spring-Breakdown/dp/B001DDBD7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spring Breakdown</a>).

I guess when you're in as many films as is Posey, some of them are bound to be duds. There is, so I've heard, a shortage of great scripts. Thus it's to be expected that a professional actress, who wants to keep busy, doesn't always have the option of picking a great script.

Price Check is only worth one star, but I'm giving it another because it has Posey.",1512691200,,2557,7.683673469387755

Dull witted people will not get it. I saw some reviewers comments that the film wasn't funny. Uuuhmm, those would be the dimwitted people :-  Only kidding sort of, but really funny film. Also the acting was terrific and the characters were all so nuanced and believable. Stereotypes are turned on their heads as the female boss acts like stereotypical male bosses. Just a really great indie movie all around. You gotta watch it!",1417392000,,602,4.574074074074074
8549043,2,B00AADAEBW,"Price Check is a pretty slow office for the first part, then including the wider corporate world drama for the second film.  It's pretty low budget as is pretty evident from the set, that is pretty much a boardroom and few cubicles, desks, a photocopier/kitchenette room.  When a film doesn't have much of a budget it relies on either a great cast or a great script, this doesn't have a brilliant script.  It doesn't have a well known cast either (although as is evident by most of the other reviews the main female lead Parker Posey obviously is popular in some TV show/movie that gained a bit of a cult following and fans of her from that love seeing her again on their screens and seem to be rating this five stars because she's in it).  But as someone who'd never heard of her before I have to say I think her part was the weakest acted and most unbelievable of all the characters.  She's supposed to be this innovative ideas leader that this underperforming supermarket chain has paid big money for to save their chain from oblivion.  She just comes across as annoying to me and not believable in her position at all to me.

The other main character, played by Eric Mabius, a family man who doesn't really want to be working there and would rather be back in the music industry but who has a young son and a wife not really prepared to return to the workforce when he brings it up, so needs the job, does quite a good job.  He's believable as a man who was content to just turn up each morning, go through the motions and walk out at five but who now with a new boss whose fired everyone above him, has to embrace the new life revolves around your job mentality, or become unemployed. Unfortunately for him his wife likes spending the money faster than its coming in, the boss is making more and more inappropriate demands on him and he needs to play the corporate game harder than he ever has before.

I found Price Check to be pretty slow moving for the most parts.  It tries to be funny in parts but fails to really deliver any of its punch lines.  As a drama it fails to really draw you in either.  Other than the main guy you really couldn't care less about the other characters.",1411257600,,2189,4.338235294117647
