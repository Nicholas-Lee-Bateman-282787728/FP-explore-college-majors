8668285,4,B00LUXFY70,All region DVD.  It features the movie and that's it.  No extras which is a shame.  The Secret Stash website sell the DVD for around $25 and it is signed by Kevin Smith.  It also has the complete title on the cover which is Jay & Silent Bob's Super Groovy Cartoon Movie.  This DVD release here on Amazon states that it is rated PG-13...lol...oh no. Definately not for small children!!!!,1432512000,,386,4.457142857142857

8668287,1,B00LUXFY70,"I love Kevin Smith but this movie is a lazy mess. The jokes fall flat and its just outright boring. Honestly, this is a major blemish on Jay and Silent Bob's legacy.

Save your money. Wait for Tusk.",1413936000,,198,4.2105263157894735
8668288,4,B00LUXFY70,"This film is fun and full of Jay and Silent Bob's shenanigans, but falls short of the usual standard.
Its story gets interrupted three times by Kevin Smith so he can talk for a little while, and it feels necessary and a bit much after the first, one time he interrupts to tell you Cockknocker isn't voiced by Mark Hamill, and they chose someone entirely different, who doesn't sound similar in the least. There are also a few too many ""I'll suck your dick if you let me live"" jokes. It kind of grates.
Over all, I like the film, but if you aren't already a fan, this is not the film for you,  Mallrats or Dogma would be.",1409702400,3,620,4.2100840336134455
