223456,3,630020829X,John Wayne the reigning hero of Western & Action films is in a departure of his usual tough guy personna by playing a chracter of self doubt.  Wayne plays a Rancher who competes with a gambling tycoon on the Barbary Coast over the hand of a beautiful dance hall queen. This film also displays the infamous 1906 San Fransisco Earthquake. One of the highlights in a film that is otherwise routine. Another highlight is seeing this film in colured version instead of black & white.,976665600,26,478,4.623529411764705
223457,4,630020829X,"This early outing finds Wayne in a romantic, light hearted story that  showed early signs of what was to come. Watch closely to see early  parallels with later legendary performances with Maureen O'Hara in films  such as the quiet man. Only about 100 mins long, but very easy viewing, and  absorbing, don't be put off by the early year of production - this is a  very good movie.",965347200,28,379,4.514705882352941
223550,3,630020829X,"Flame of Barbary Coast, 1945 film

A coach passes by the ocean and sees a cowboy throwing stones into the ocean. The woman talks to the man, who is going to Pacific Street to collect a $500 debt at the El Dorado. Girls dance the Can-Can on stage. There is a group that wants to abolish the Barbary Coast. Mr. Morrell auditions a singer. Is there jealousy? There is a song and dance. Duke Fergus gets his $500 in gold for the horse. There is another song, in French and English. Duke wins at cards, then at dice. He wins again and again! Duke wins at roulette. A womans foot prevents the dealer from hitting the brake. Should gamblers get their money back?

Duke and his followers return. A tipsy Duke plays cards, then wakes up in a strange place, broke. Duke takes the train back home, then jumps off at his stop. Later he goes into town to talk to a gambler about cards. They return to El Dorado and watch the games. [Its a business.] Two women meet Wolfie. Duke is looking for action. Are the dealers here smarter than Wylie? Duke checks the deck before playing. A newspaper editor talks about eliminating the Barbary Coast. Duke wins at poker. The newspapers tell about Dukes winnings. [Good publicity?] Duke is at Calico Jacks place and asks for an honest deal. The conflict is settled! Duke plans to build a house by the ocean and tells Flaxson his plans. There is a song and dance.

The gamblers want to get rid of Duke. Flaxson wants to leave Titos place for The Silver Dollar! Duke visits Flaxson. Tito tells Duke his place will close without Flaxson. Flaxson sings again. Then there is a disaster - the Great Earthquake of 1906! The water mains are busted, the fires cant be quenched! Dynamite is used to destroy buildings and stop the fire. Flaxson is hurt by the destruction. Some lose everything. There will be a new San Francisco. There is an election. Who will count the votes? Where are the tally sheets? There is another song for entertainment. Tito has the tally sheets, which control the voting results. Duke takes them and goes to City Hall.

This drama had an interesting point. Elections are decided by votes listed on the tally sheets. Change the numbers to affect the results. Thats the reason for a recount. This movies song and dances are a change from the concerns of the real world. Games give the house an edge, which can be helped by skilled dealers. San Francisco has been the major financial city on the west coast since gold was discovered in 1849. This attracted people. Businessmen began a Committee of Vigilance to ensure the laws would be followed by popular justice. This was copies in many other places until law and order became established. San Francisco has a natural port but economics sent shipping to lower-rent Oakland.",1482278400,,2765,4.5910931174089065

223684,4,630020829X,"One of many films John Wayne made while under contract with Republic Studios, this may seem to be just another westerner but instead it takes place in 1906 on the cobbled streets of old San Francisco rather than on the dusty plains. Wayne plays a Montana rancher named Duke (naturally) who arrives at the lawless Barbary Coast to collect a debt owed to him from saloon owner and cad Tito Morell (Joseph Schildkraut), and immediately falls in love with the cads singer girlfriend, Flaxen (Ann Dvorak). After Tito makes a fool out of him a now penniless Duke sheepishly heads home where he learns to be a card shark. With this new found talent Duke returns to Barbary Coast to beat Tito at his own game and maybe even steal his girl.
One of the great things about Republic films were how economically they made their movies. 'Flame' was undoubtedly Republic's big release of 1945 but it clocks in at a brisk 91 minutes. There is a lot of story in this brief running time but the film ignores any filler and sticks to the meat; Duke falls in love with Flaxen at first sight. After being run out of San Francisco we are given scene where Duke is starting to learn how to play cards and in the very next scene he is back at Barbary Coast winning every hand at every saloon until he is just as rich and powerful as the bemused Tito. Shortly after that he has his own upper-class saloon and has Flaxen headlining it. This all happens within 60 minutes and is followed by the showstopping earthquake sequence, courtesy of the famous Lydecker brothers.  And after that there is still a full third act to follow. If this movie were made ten years later it would be two and a half hours long, in super widescreen and garish color and dare I say, not nearly as good.
Lots of fun, with a great cast all around and some okay musical numbers. The film has similarities to the earlier MGM Clark Gable epic 'San Francisco' but Flame of the Barbary coast is faster paced and less pretentious (although the MGM film has a more spectacular earthquake scene; On the other hand it had too much opera).
To my eyes the bluray looked fine. There were some specks and grain but this is a 70 year old film so I expect that. Wait for Amazon to have a sale and pick it up.",1413244800,4,2243,4.378896882494005

The female lead is not pretty or drop dead gorgeous, so my husband and I were not impressed with her

here let me stab you in the back or betray you or something else fun"". I don't like those kinds of characters
that get so much screen time.
Go John Wayne action with a quick view of what happened in the Great San Francisco Earthquake.

Returning to San Francisco he sets out to win her by becoming a major player in the city.

223717,5,630020829X,"This is an old fashioned western and in Wayne's career a movie made that showed his growth as a leading man prior to the great westerns he made starting a couple years later with 3 Godfathers, Fort Apache and Red River.  It's a fine movie and I really appreciate the acting of Josepth Schildkraut as a ""not so bad"" heavy.  He clearly made the most of a script that allowed him to be anything but one of the cardboard villains who inhabit the earlier Wayne vehicles (and often cause them to be classic B westerns).  He is in turn witty, suave, ruthless and, in the end, a European gentleman somewhat like the heavies in Viennese operettas such as Die Fliedermaus (the Bat in English) by Strauss.  The female leads are also quite good.  Highly recommended as it looks and sounds just great.",1392336000,7,788,4.52112676056338

223720,4,630020829X,"Not a classic John Wayne movie, but better than no John Wayne movie at all.

John Wayne travels from Montana to San Francisco to collect a debt from a crooked gambler. He sold the gambler a horse but when he sent one of his cowhands to collect, the Gambler cheated him out of the money. Now the Duke is coming to town to collect.

Along the way he meets a gambling hall entertainer named Flaxen (Ann Dvorak) and the Gambler who owns the hall where she works; the same Gambler who owes John Wayne the money. Of course if things went easy, this wouldn't be a movie; so before John manages to collect his money he has to make a fortune, lose the fortune, and then make a bigger one.

By the time it's all said and done, John is involved in city politics and helping San Francisco deal with the after effects of the ""Great Quake of 1906"". This lacks the Indians, horses, and gun fights we usually associate with a John Wayne movie, and it's not a classic like the Quiet Man or Rio Bravo, but if you thought you'd run out of movies starring the Duke this is better than nothing.",1322179200,,1073,4.25
223721,4,630020829X,"FLAME OF THE BARBARY COAST: The Duke vs. Joseph Schildkraut for the heart of Ann Dvorak and dominance of the San Francisco gambling scene. Wayne is smart and strong, Dvorak is beautiful and unobtainable and Schildkraut is charming and both conniving and dignified. William Frawley provides guidance and laughs as Duke's mentor, Wolf Wiley. This is a classic love triangle/rivalry, the kind that has sustained literature down through the ages.

SANTA FE STAMPEDE: John Wayne, Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan and Max Terhune made several Republic Westerns where they played a group of friends known as the Three Mesquiteers. This is one of their better outings. Wayne is framed for a murder he did not commit and faces lynching at the hands of an angry mob. (The titular Stampede)Will his friends be able to save him in time? I'm not telling, but you probably know the answer. This is a fun Republic oater with decent action and some funny comic bits by Terhune and his ventriloquist dummy.",1293580800,3,977,4.921212121212121

Also, I wish Amazon.com would provide a wish list for items they currently don't carry or are unavailable at the time.  That way they would have some idea of how many people would be interested in an item and they might then add it to their inventory.",1288569600,,441,4.432098765432099
223744,4,630020829X,"FLAME OF BARBARY COAST and SANTA FE STAMPEDE are hardly considered the cream of the crop in John Wayne's body of work. One picture is after John Wayne rose to stardom, the other right before. They're both okay viewing, marked as they are by the Duke's distinctive broad-shouldered presence. I purchased this DVD. I ain't complaining.

There's no rivalry like a rivalry over a beautiful woman. When you get to the heart of the plot in John Wayne's turn-of-the-century drama, there sits Ann Dvorak all fine and beautiful. In 1945's FLAME OF BARBARY COAST, easygoing Montana rancher Duke Fergus arrives at San Francisco's Barbary Coast to collect a debt from an influential casino owner and, because of this and that - but mostly because of Flaxen Tarry the enticing dance hall chanteuse (Dvorak) - he ends up establishing his own casino right across the street. Duke Fergus is well on his way to clobbering all competition and getting the girl (having already hired her away from his rival), but then the great San Francisco earthquake strikes, and I guess there's nothing like a natural disaster to bring a man back down to earth.

I enjoyed this movie okay, even though it's nowhere near the Duke's best work. FLAME OF BARBARY COAST is a poor man's remake of SAN FRANCISCO. The production values here are decent but don't match that of the original classic. But I thought that John Wayne and Ann Dvorak are in fine form as the leads, even if they don't have much to work with in terms of script. There's a bit of suspense thrown in regarding Flaxen because you're never quite sure exactly where her allegiance lies. Also, Dvorak never was heralded as a notable singer, and her efforts here won't change anyone's mind. William Frawley has a very good supporting part as the wily cardsharp Wolf Wylie who mentors Duke Fergus in the game of cards. Joseph Schildkraut as the shady gentleman casino owner Tito Morell ends up with probably the most nuanced character in the film. The film stacks its deck by also featuring lovely Virginia Grey, although there's a pointlessness to her role as Grey never even comes close to stealing Dvorak's thunder. Grey does end up with a pretty amusing line she beamingly delivers to Tito several times as the man's prospects continue to dwindle: ""This is going to cost you an awful lot of money."" As the remaining star attraction of Tito's casino, Grey probably gets that big raise.

This second feature on this double bill is one of them diverting little films that you end up watching on those lazy Saturday or Sunday mornings, before you realize that, dammit, chores still need to get done. SANTA FE STAMPEDE is just one of eight B-movie westerns John Wayne would churn out for the Three Mesquiteers series under Republic Pictures, back when he was still a no-name cowboy actor in 1938, with STAGECOACH and superstardom still lurking around the corner. SANTA FE STAMPEDE, for a 55 minute running time, packs in plenty of plot points. And the way the action plays out, you'd think this was a cliffhanger movie serial.

The premise, when boiled down, goes like this: When Stony Brooke (Wayne) is framed for the murder of an old friend and his little girl, he and his two fellow Mesquiteers Tucson and Lullaby (Ray Corrigan and Max Terhune, respectively) attempt to corral the real finks. But several elements play a factor and flesh out the story. It starts with a newly discovered gold mine, and so bring on the claim-jumping. The movie makes no bones about the corrupt mayor being the mastermind of all the nastiness, and the Mesquiteers' old friend spells his own doom when he goes to deliver a petition demanding the ousting of the mayor from office. There's a sort of disturbing sequence in which two bad hombres cause a wagon carrying a screaming little girl to hurtle off the road. I can see why, in several presentations, this segment is heavily edited.

SANTA FE STAMPEDE doesn't trot out the standard animal stampede. I'd like to think that the ""stampede"" the film title refers to concerns what happens when otherwise rational people transform into a vengeful mob and become this wantonly destructive entity. Even for a low-budget B-western, this portrait of an out-of-control mob is harrowing. This little film has got some meat on its bones and, of course, John Wayne is front and center. It doesn't make sense, otherwise.",1280275200,,4367,4.80186170212766
