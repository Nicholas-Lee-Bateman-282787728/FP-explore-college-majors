1418303,5,B00005ASO0,"This DVD and the ones to follow it are overall the best in the entire series. First in episode 18, we see the test of EVA 03. Unfortunetely, it goes berserk, injures Ritsuko and Misato and EVA 03 is announced as the next angel. After EVA 03 makes quick work of Rei, piloting 00, and Auska, piloting 02, it goes after Shinji. Soon, Gendo forces the dummy plug system in EVA 01 to activate. The result is the EVA exploding in rage and ends up severly injuring the pilot. Im not gonna tell who the pilot of 03 was, but Shinji gets pretty mad at his father. After having a been confined for his ruthless action against his father, Shinji leaves NERV only to come back when the next angel arrive. And this is a tough angel. Im serious. This thing made its way past Auska, who used 4 machine guns and two bazzokas, and Rei, who trys to commit suicide with an N2 mine. It even makes its all the way down to the NERV control center! Shinji arrives just in time, but while piloting EVA 01, it goes berserk and ends up eating the angel with Shinji's sync rate at 400 PERCENT! Episode 20 is a lot like episode 16. Shinji is left as nothing but LCL in the entry plug. While NERV recovers from the Angels attack, they also try to rebuild Shinji. Shinji himself in the entry plug, faces the terror of his mind once again. Pretty sweet! And it only gets better from here. The English dub is really good on this disc. If Gendo yelling ""Rei!"" in English doesn't give you goosebumps, the part when the angel breaks into NERV HQ is guarenteed to. Great disc! Worth every dollar.",986428800,3,1559,4.288135593220339
1418304,5,B00005ASO0,"Okay people, for those of you who don't know already, this is where the the proverbial poop hits the fan, and let me tell ya, it hits hard. For those of you who thought Eva was some kinda kiddie mecha action show, this is where you get proven wrong. All comedy and fun is checked at the door and the real story begins to unfold. Seele and Gendo's true plans begin to unveil and our characters start thier long, painfull spiral into the blackness. But trust me, it gets worse though; just wait for Manga's release of The End of Evangelion this summer and you'll see what I mean.",986083200,5,577,4.302752293577981
1418305,5,B00005ASO0,"This is one of the best volumes. I love Rei's charcter and I love how the truth about her is revealed. These episodes have everything and Evangelion fan could ask for. Many questions are awnsered, the dummy system,rei,  Ristsuko's secret and the last angel. This is also the last real volume  where you can determine what is going on!",947116800,3,334,4.6440677966101696
1418306,5,B00005ASO0,"This tape is wonderful. Although the first episode on the tape is a little weird, the second episode is absolutely mindblowing, especially the sequence with unit 01 and unit 02. If you like EVA in the slightest, you'll  love this tape.",946684800,,235,4.7317073170731705
1418307,5,B00005ASO0,I definitely agree that this is a great volume in the collection.  Kaoru is definitely the most intriguing charachters this animae has seen.  It was the most shocking and disturbing of all of the Evangelion episodes.,911692800,,216,4.972222222222222
1418328,5,B00005ASO0,"I have to say that evangelion is one of the most original animes out there. but what I don't get is that the whole franchize started in 1999, and now about 6 years later it is know starting to grow. I mean so far they cam out with directors cuts and completly remastered versions of the whole series AND adult swim is now showing it (although ut is really late, they should have donedis in the first place).

anyway like I said be4 this is the best out of all the DVD's. the thing that really disturbed da F*** out of me when I first saw dis 3 years ago was the battle between Eva unit 01 and unit 03. this was the most violent battle of the entire series, cuz unit 01 rip the sh** out of unit 03 blood was rushing through the land and also flyin al over the place. And dats just the first episode, the second one is just as violent if not more, at the end they finally reveal what an evangelion truly is, more than just a biotechnologocal robot, but a killin moster and u will see that when Unit 01 really goes beserk and eats out the leavin hell out of an angel. the last one simmers down a bit and shows the more confusin parts of the series when Shinji is trapped inside of unit 01 literally. O yeah finally a lil sex action between Misato and Kaji. this is one volume of evangelion u can't afford to miss.",1146268800,,1310,4.077519379844961
1418329,5,B00005ASO0,"Ahem, yes, my title is less than eloquent, but this volume blew me away.  I was actually saying those words out loud over and over as I watched the first and second episodes.  The behavior exhibited by Eva Unit 01 caught me completely off guard.  Without spoiling anything (as the editorial review has done), I will say that the violence in this volume was more believable because such savagery has not yet been present in the series.

The thirteenth and fourteenth Angels attack. They are strong.  The Evas are no match for them, being literally torn apart.  The bastion of NERV headquarters is no longer able to prevent being penetrated by the Angels.

Not as believable was the final episode, where all characters emerge unscathed from tremendous attacks and explosions, and Shinji's ""soul"" is trying to be salvaged by Major Katsuragi and NERV staff.  It would have been even more realistic if one of the chosen children had died.  (Honest, I am not spoiling anything).

There is a hot sex scene between Misato and Kaji.  You can't see much, but you can actually hear them knocking boots.  I'm not kidding.  Neon Genesis Evangelion Collection 0:6 contains a mere three episodes, but what episodes they are.  What are you doing reading this review?  Go buy this DVD!  Better yet, buy the whole series!",1123200000,,1303,4.801801801801802
1418330,5,B00005ASO0,"The last couple Eva Platinum DVDs have been falsely labeled. In the review it says that Episodes 18-20 are on this disc, while in reality they are on disc 5. The episodes on this disc are 21, 22, and 23.

Don't get me wrong, the reviews are great. They're just for the wrong disc. Maybe Amazon will catch the error and fix it. Maybe.",1109289600,14,333,4.203125
1418331,4,B00005ASO0,"...but not because this DVD is the best around. Its the best at the moment because you get more for your money with this one than with the original 0-6 release. It holds both the original and the director cut episodes and features some extra's with regards to the (possible) upcoming Evangelion live movie as well as some audio commentary (even though I find those things awfull myself; its just people chatting while the cartoon is running, most of the times they don't even pay attention at all to what is happening).

So where money is concerned this would be your best choice at the moment. But if you simply like the series without being a ""die-hard"" fan then I'd advice you to steer clear of this one and get the original instead.

When watching this DVD I only used the English sub and even though it has some very nice extra's when it comes to the Director Cut episodes (the guys from SEELE really sound more creapy) it can be an annoying experience in the overall. Some of the main characters (Ikari, Ibuki and the ""long haired"" collegue of Huga) got totally changed voices. Although Ikari's voice isn't as annoying the others are just totally wrong choices. In some cases it really does not reflect the personage.

If you're just looking for something new on the Evangelion front then I'd really advice you to wait for the moment where the currently being released platinum collection reaches this number. Its almost as if the released movies and Director cuts were the tests for the Platinum series. Everything which the movie or director cut lacks (wrong voices, weird animation) is totally made up in the Platinum series. That is truly a ""blast from the past"" re-run.",1095206400,5,1680,4.688135593220339
1418332,5,B00005ASO0,"If you need an excuse to buy this, tell yourself it's a present for that *real* otaku in your life, that's all ... but you don't need an excuse.  You need this if you are still dissatisfied with, or puzzled by, Evangelion.  I pre-ordered it (not for me, no, it was a present ...), half-expecting to be disappointed -- instead we were dead silent, other than the occasional muttered ""that's new"" & some snorting at the subtitles, which are, shall we say, less than smoothly done this time around.  Lots of clarification.  Lots of back story.  Lots of new images.  Yes, I've pre-ordered the next one (but it's a present, really).
Evangelion is dark, no question, but for truly depressing viewing, watch the preview of the live-action version: a long dreary interview with two guys from Weta, interspersed with sketches of the characters.  Shriek in terror at the characters' new & improved names.  Throw up your arms, or possibly your lunch, at the pronunciation of Eva & of Evangelion (had they actually seen the anime?).  And find a body language expert to explain what it means when X is droning on & on, & Y is sitting quietly beside him doing some very peculiar things indeed with his hands.",1078185600,7,1194,4.6746411483253585
1418333,5,B00005ASO0,"I suppose, since I bought this DVD as soon as it became available that I have finally become a true Eva-Otaku.  After all, I already own the DVD set and the films.  Somehow, though, I've never thought of myself as one.  I find Evangelion a fascinating artistic effort, one that manages to cross cultural lines even as it creates something uniquely Japanese.  But I haven't memorized the scripts yet.  But in absorbing this new DVD I discovered that I'm still not tired of watching the episodes.
A lot of director's cuts really are just collections of deleted material pasted back on.  With some frequency, the cuts were made for a valid reason.  On occasion, the cuts were made to accomplish something arbitrary (to get a better rating or meet a length requirement).  That is the case here.  These episodes represent a return to Hideaki Anno's original concept for the series and provide considerable insight into the confusions of the first US release.
Episode 21 has been filled out considerably, providing a better picture of the progression that led to the birth of the Evangelions and the inception of NERV.  While most of the information can be gleaned elsewhere, this makes the story gel for the view.  You will immediately become aware that you are watching a redubbed Japanese product, not a re-localized cut (which is what the original release was.  This creates a bit of visual confusion until you adjust, but actually presents considerable new information, as many of the subtitles are different or new.
Unfortunately, is also becomes apparent that the entire production has been redubbed and John Swasey has replaced Tristan MacAvery as Gendo Akari.  While it isn't Swasey's fault, the acting lacks the edge of the first release, and sometimes the dubbing proceeds on blindly, paying no attention to changes in the subtitles or the Japanese.  Minor annoyances when you consider the improved clarity of the episodes.
Episode 22 is the first indication that something major has happened.  The material reintroduced to the episode focuses on Asuka's development as a character.  Introductory material about he has been added, and the fight scene where she suffers a breakdown and failure has been significantly changed.  Anno makes much use of echoing images in the series, but what we discover is that the released cut greatly reduced his artistic contribution.  With al this restored the story leaps to life as it never had before.
Episode 23 continues in this vein.  Although the changes are not so dramatic as in 22, Rei's fight scene has also been expanded internally, some material has also been deleted including a bit of brief nudity that also refocuses the intense of another scene.  In fact, many of the cuts originally made in both 22 and 23 were made to diffuse some of the latent sexuality of the invasions of both Asuka's and Rei's psyche's.  In retrospect, this is a surprising discovery, since Evangelion has always been aimed at a young adult audience, and there is nothing particularly offensive in the new versions.
Both versions of the episodes are provided so save popping DVD's in and out.  The only additional material is a 15-minute marketing interview about the Evangelion live action film that raises as many misgivings as it does interest.
If the remaining episodes in the director's cut series are as changed as these were then this is required viewing.  Hideaki Anno's work opens up layers of Evangelion that previously were obscure tot he viewer, especially the English language viewer.  I would recommend tracking them down even if you are only a casual watcher of anime.  If you have become an Eva-Otaku then ownership is both required and a delight.",1077926400,31,3692,4.964227642276422
1418334,4,B00005ASO0,"This DVD is aimed at die-hard Evangelion fans. It also coincides with preproduction of the live-action movie. Evangelion is the Holy Grail of anime TV series.
One of the cool things about this DVD is it includes the original episodes and the new versions. Of course, fans will already have the originals, but it's a neat feature.
No, there are no previews of the live-action movie, just a Q&A with two production guys from ""The Lord of the Rings."" They're ""really honored to work on this project."" You get the idea.

1418335,5,B00005ASO0,"I don't know about the rest of you, but I think the ""professionals"" writing the editorial reviews are supposed to be unbiased.  But, labeling the commentary about the live action EVA as patronizing is sadly a biased statement.  I understand some people are unable to cope with the fact that Anime are being brought to America in a form of live action entertainment but, I find this to be quite enthralling.  Think of it, beautifully rendered CG Eva models, charecters (hopefully) portraying our beloved Eva charecters in all their mind-shatteringly disturbing glory.
  On to the Review:
I first watched these directors cut's off of a bootleg website in Japanese (I only understand like... what and hello in Japanese) and I was blown away.  The story unravelled itself for me through the mere visuals of this astounding new Rebirth.  Ah, I just caught the cornyness of it... Death, Rebirth, End, and Ressurection.  I guess Anno could be less involved with death, couldn't he?  Anyways, I have high hopes for all future Eva products.  What a beautiful DVD!  5 and 1/2 Stars! (I always hate when people do that)
  p.s. If anyone can force the Anime Network to start broadcasting in my area I'd really appreciate it.  (Broward County, FL)",1074902400,4,1234,4.8701923076923075
1418336,4,B00005ASO0,"Evangelion fans will surely rejoice on some level that their beloved series is being somewhat redone. This is the first of two director's cuts, and the change are simply astounding.
One thing nobody's said yet is that this is actually a remaster as well. Seems ADV lifted the redone video from that Eva project in Japan that cleaned up the video and gave it a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. The colors are more vibrant, the lines more distinct, and scene changes less visually jumpy. There is no Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack, however.
Not much is different in episode 21, however, things change with episode 22. I won't spoil anything, but I will say that there is an incredibly powerful new scene involving Asuka...the fact that it wasn't included in the original is apalling. The eva battle in episode 23 is COMPLETELY different then in the original, and gives loads of new insight not seen before. This newly redone battle sequence somewhat hints at what's to come in End of Evangelion.
One bad thing is that there's a redub, and while I didn't mind the fact that some actors were dropped, it does seem that nearly everyone is far less enthusiastic. You can tell that, upon listening to it, most of them are thinking ""I've gotta do this again? I thought I was done with Evangelion years ago."" One exception is the voice actress behind Asuka. She's actually improved since the series, and her presence is every bit as powerful and moving as it was on End of Evangelion, if not then more so. This is definately good, Asuka's new scene is, without a doubt, the most important addition to the disc.
There's an excerpt on the Eva live movie with Weta workshop, which would be some of the lads behind the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This would be a good thing for fans, but it ended up being more like a rude awakening. One of the men being interviewed continuously refers to the series as ""Evanjellion,"" which makes me question just how do care about the series. A concept drawing for one of the female characters in a blue suit had the name ""Ray"" on it. These things and their vague explanation of what the series was about was enough to destroy whatever faith I had in the project.",1074470400,,2179,4.589743589743589
1418337,5,B00005ASO0,"In one word: awesome. I've seen these cuts before (btw, episode 24's WILL blow you guys away, lol) and on DVD, they're even better. ADV has finally completed the Eva series with this and I'll be darned if it ain't their best seller in DVDs. Episode 21 don't have much. Episode 22 is the best Asuka ep. The part where there's hooded figures around her are pure horror & creepiness. Episode 23 rules all, because of the foreshadowing of the End of Evangelion. It also tells who created Rei. All in all, even if you got the original release of Collection 0:7 & 0:8, these new releases are well worth it.",1074211200,2,600,4.414414414414415
1418338,4,B00005ASO0,"I love 'Evangelion' and I have watched it several times over the years since its release. I enjoy discussing with friends what the show is about and I am one of those people who liked both endings of the series. I pretty much love everything about it, but only a few themes of the show make it less enjoyable then it could be for me and these Directors' Cuts make one point stand out.
For how great Eva is, for how well it digs into the emotions and personalities of its characters, 'Evangelion' gets very depressing by the end of it. When the show hits its 20th episode, almost all the humor has been put to the side. It gets very serious and very thought provoking. Watching Asuka (played by Tiffany Grant at her best) get torn down and fall into a wreck is gut wrenching to watch. The added scenes make this even harder to watch, but you just can't help but stare and listen. The added scenes of Rei II's (Amanda Winn-Lee) death are fascinating and almost feel out of place after years of seeing the original version.
In all, the added scenes make the show even better, but also make it harder to watch. To me, this is not the kind of show you can just sit down on a lazy Sunday afternoon and watch in your bathrobe. It's the kind of show you watch when you want to be moved and not stop thinking about it for a week. You watch 'Evangelion' when you want to feel something. Unfortunately, some of those feelings won't be pleasant and will make you sad, but that is the whole point in the first place.",1074211200,13,1503,4.277192982456141
1418339,4,B00005ASO0,"Well, after years/months/days of waiting, it's finally here: episodes 21-23 in all their ""director's cut"" glory. And quite honestly, I was in the purest of ecstasies when I first purchased it. Immediately afterwards, an innumerable amount of questions raced through my head: ""What could it be like? Sure, the cuts have been DESCRIBED to me, but how do I know they're not completely wrong?... God, I can't wait to get home."" And so, when I was home, I quickly shoved the disk into the DVD player to see...
Yes, another Anime Network ad, but that's not all! When the menu popped up on the screen, my eyes did a 180... this was not quite the menu of old.  It looked the same, but it was so much cooler this time around... all grey and red and whatnot. And, as I do with all of my DVD purchases, I quickly checked the extras to find... next to nothing. Clean opening, clean closing, and... what's this? An interview about the Eva live-action movie? Well, since I expected it to be there, I decided to move onto the episodes instead of watching it first.
First thing that struck me about episode 21: Holy shiite. NO MORE SUPER-IMPOSED TEXT!  ADV finally decided to put a big fat brain in that space between their ears.  Just seeing pure, unadulterated Japanese text in these episodes makes me yearn for the TRUE versions of episodes 25 and 26. And yes, to see the opening sequence from Death worked into an episode was truly awesome.
Then came the opening theme. They retranslated the opening theme! Why should I be mad about this? Well, it's much more accurate this time around, but I must ask, why did it take them THREE translations to get to this point? And it's still flawed.
But I decided not to let it get to me.  Still, something was bugging me during the whole experience... of course! The episodes have been retranslated entirely! What's more, it seems Matt Greenfield, while writing the ADR script, lost his thesaurus. So often three or four of the same word will be repeated within a sentence. Yes, it bugs me, because I'm an English freak-o-matic.  For example, the line ""someone who keeps cats to keep loneliness at bay"" is a bit to repetitive on the ""keeps"" for me-self.
But that was fine with me, as long as the new scenes were there and were as wonderful as I expected.  I'll let those of you who haven't seen the new versions know this: IT WAS BETTER THAN ANYTHING I'D EVER EXPECTED.  Simply... Godlike. Then came episode 22.
Asuka fans rejoice!  The director's cut of this episode is truly for you. Asuka's breakdown is longer... and much better as a result. This is also the longest episode of the three, which was most likely the reason for all the cuts.  But Asuka's character is finally done justice, and Lilith finally grows legs (as she should).  And of course, I was ready to praise ""At Least, Be Human(e)"" as the best cut of the pack. However...
First, let me state this. ""Tear(s)"", for years, has been my favorite episode of Evangelion. It provided the greatest amount of exposition on my second favorite character of the series, Rei. And it was the first death in Evangelion that was actually worthy of a tear (unless you really really liked Kaji). Well, while watching the director's cut, I discovered this: the original cut of ""Tear"" didn't make any sense at all! It didn't even show how Rei killed the angel! Now, with this cut, we have little Reis growing on Shinji's thumb (which sets the stage for a whole lot of End of Evangelion) and a good picture of exactly what happens when you invert an AT field while an angel's in it. And don't forget that wonderful one-frame shot of angel Rei. KABOOM! And this was all cut for TV broadcast... for no real reason at all, as far as I can see. Oh well. These little flashes of comprehension make ""Tear"" the best episode of the set.
And so... that was an AMAZING experience. Now, as much as I hate to do so, I must overview a few other sections of the DVD. Now, please note this: I do not hate the dub of Evangelion. I, in fact, consider it to be one of the better dubs out there. And thus, what they did to it in these newly cut episodes is blasphemous. THEY RE-DUBBED IT.  Not only this, but it seems that the entire reason for re-dubbing is the apparent absence of Tristan MacAvery as Gendo. Note this: not having Tristan MacAvery as Gendo in the dub is the equivalent to taking Allison Keith or Spike Spencer out. Essentially meaning they ruined it. This new guy has an accent... boy, is it annoying.  Luckily, however, Allison Keith, Spike Spencer, Amanda Winn-Lee, and Tiffany Grant are still here. Speaking of Tiffany Grant, take a look at episode 22. Her performance is ASTOUNDING. This also further proves my theory that the more Tiffany Grant performs as Asuka, the better she gets.  Unfortunately, Allison Keith's Misato doesn't seem very excited about redubbing.  I wouldn't be excited about redubbing either if I did the exact same crap two years earlier for Death and Rebirth.
So I had basically finished watching the episodes in both forms. Now I needed to check out that interview. Very surprisingly... it actually made me excited for the live-action Eva movie. The designs were astoundingly detailed and... quite well done. In fact, I can't wait until it comes out. However, if anyone says ""Evan-JEL-ion,"" I'm going to run out of the theater.
Overall, despite ADV's constant attempts to sabotage the project, the episodes alone garner the DVD four stars.",1074124800,11,5441,4.607438016528926
1418340,5,B00005ASO0,"Well lets get to the point...the main reason you would be buying this video is to check out the extra scenes that you get from the director's cut footage.  And when you see the first episode (ep. 21) you will be thinking...'what was special about that' but it does get better with each episode.  When you get to the final episode on the disk you will see a scene that makes you glad you picked this one up because it makes you feel like your expirencing it all over again.  So is it worth the price of admission, yes but my only real complaint watching it is the sound. it is in 2.o stereo.....not kool...not kool at all. but i guess you cant have everything...",1074038400,,661,4.272
1418341,4,B00005ASO0,"I'm an old-school Eva fan... I watched it all on VHS with english dub.  And the old English dub was AWESOME.  This one mediocre.  Tiffany (Aska) did a pretty cool job, but otherwise... it just doesn't have the same magic.
The new visuals are spectacular.  I would buy the DVD just watch it with the mute button on the whole time.  So much is clearer; there is a clearer progression in many scenes that were partially edited before.
Alternatively... this version is not as clean as the previous edit.  When I watch eva on a regular basis, I'll still watch the old edit because it's cleaner, simpler, more graceful.  But I'm glad to have this one for the additional scenes.  They add alot of background information and further understanding; they're also much more synchronous with the presentation of Instrumentality in the last two episodes and the movie.
The director's cut may not be the best thing for people who haven't watched Eva twelve times and memorized everything, but for us who have... it's great.",1073865600,,1009,4.758620689655173
1418342,1,B00005ASO0,"ADV completely re-dubbed the English for no needed reason on this DVD, with significant changes to the voice actors.  Tristan MacAvery >DOES NOT< reprise his role as Gendo Ikari - which just plain and simple ruins it.  There are several voice changes with the minor Tech Assistants as well.  The stupid thing is that Gendo, the Techs, and all the others had >NO NEW< or changed lines from the series!!!  The approximately 5% of new scenes for this Director's Cut >HAD< the original character (Asuka, Kaji, Fuyutsuki) voice actors reprising their roles - These new scenes plus the old dub track for the other 95% >WOULD< have been perfection - but they blew it!

There are some minor changes to the visuals on some scenes such as the Terminal Dogma grave yard, the dummy plug tank, and Rei's mind chat with the Angel.

1418344,5,B00005ASO0,"Since I have been reviewing this series one DVD at a time, it has finally occurred to me that readers are tired of being told things like 'even better,' or 'adds a whole new level.'  There isn't much question but that is exactly the effect that Gainax and director Hideaki Anno intend.  We have reached the stage where the mysteries will be peeled away in layers like an onion, and this isn't intended to be a 'comfortable' process.
The twin focus of these episodes is the nature of the EVA, and the still developing character of Shinji.  In a sense, the series comes into its own now, shedding any remnant of the children's mecha appearance that it initially wore as a disguise.  We are being drawn into a startling investigation into what is human, and what is not.
In 'The Judgement of Life' Toji Suzuhara, the fourth child, is set to testing EVA 03.  But the terrible happens, and the 13th Angel (Bardiel) interferes, seizing control of the EVA.  When Gendo Ikari orders Shinji to destroy the EVA the boy refuses to kill his friend.  Gendo orders EVA 01 into auto pilot mode and Shinji mush watch in horror while his father forces the EVA to become a raging killer.
'A Man's Fight,' find's Shinji repelled by everything his father stands for and refuses to pilot an EVA again.  He is on his way home when a new Angel (Zeruel) appears and makes short work of Rei and Asuka.  Shinji forces his way back to NERV headquarters and demands to pilot EVA 01.  When the Angel nearly destroys EVA 01, Shinji achieves total integration with the EVA as it develops a life of its own... as a cannibalistic killer!
'Form of the Mind, Form of the Man' finds Misato and the NERV staff desperately trying to separate Shinji self back out from the creature that EVA 01 has become.  Inside, Shinji is forced to deal with all aspects of his personality as he strives to understand his own purpose.
I often see Shinji referred to as a weak character that flees from difficulty and is overly dependent on what others think of him.  I have to disagree.  While the boy is not a willing hero, he has proved repeatedly that he will do what has to be done with his own sense of ethics.  Considering his age, and the enormous responsibility he bears, I think he does extremely well.  With a father who is always either cold or abusive, Shinji's need for approval is more than understandable.
As I've already indicated, these are pivotal episodes, intense and compelling.  Entirely rewarding.",1038096000,7,2467,4.572727272727272
1418345,5,B00005ASO0,"In Vol. 6 the EVA mystery is kind of answered,as much as anything is on the series,Shinji is proven to be the best pilot and the ony one to really pilot an EVA.Technically the animation is as usual flawless. The climax of the story is the true nature of the EVA-pilot bond which you have to see to believe.
Trully a  fine anime!",1012521600,2,328,4.2063492063492065
1418346,5,B00005ASO0,This is my personal fav volume of EVA and this was because this trio of epsiodes totally blow your mind with acts that are totaly socking that will make your draw drop when you first see them.,1010188800,,192,4.216216216216216
1418357,5,B00005ASO0,"Well, this is my favourite DVD on eva, i have been watching eva for 3-4 years and loved the series. The first time i seen the series was on SBS and it was my 2nd favourite episode, Ambivalence (Eva Unit-03 is an angel) And i bought all eva DVDs when they came out. Episode 19 is the ultimate ep. This is the DVD. Episode 18 is excellent in action and shinjis drama, episode 19, i never got to see this episode because my retiler didn't have episode 19 and 20, but when i watched them, i always wandered what was missing in eva, but now i get it finally, never skip a SINGLE episode, watch ALL of em' 1 by one, second by second. If anyone here likes anime, sci-fi, comedy, action and violence, eva is for you, excellent series, if anyone is a bigger fan than me, i don't believe em. (...)
Also watch out for mid next year, for the new series of eva REVELATION (i am not kidding !!!) and End Of Eva 0mn DVD and Death and Rebirth on DVD should be out April !!! KEEP WATCHING!!",1008288000,2,973,4.099476439790576
1418358,5,B00005ASO0,"When you make it this far in the series, you think you wouldn't be shocked by many things. I can tell you only one thing, THAT IS WRONG! When Unit 01 devours the Angel that defeats Rei and Asuka, it is truly shocking. You see for once what the Evas really are. They aren't juse giant biomechanical robots used to protect mankind, they're monsters just as the Angels are. Incredible storytelling, wonderful score, and all the rest are what makes this anime series great.
Go buy it.",1002844800,,480,4.528735632183908
1418359,5,B00005ASO0,"Someone in this review section said, ""rent the rest, own this one,"" and I gotta say I couldn't agree more with that statement. The events that take place in the ep 18 and 19 (ESPECIALLY 19!) are simply jaw-dropping and mind-boggling, and the ep 20 is a very poignant start to the psycho-analytic drama that'll unfold later in the series. And I consider ep 19 to be the very best episode in the whole TV series. (I say 'TV series' because the ""End of Eva"" movie is just as awesome. Man, I want that movie on DVD)
Heck, I think Eva ep 19 to be one of the finest and the most awe-inspiring moments in all the anime I've seen. And having watched anime for over 20 years, I've watched quite a few. :)
Utmostly recommended.",999302400,,717,4.279411764705882
1418360,5,B00005ASO0,"This is really where the psychological part of the Eva series takes off. After going beserk in a test, Unit 03, piloted by Toji Shuzara, the 13th Angel, Bardiel, awakens inside of the Eva. Taking out Asuka and Rei, Shinji comes, but doesn't attack for fear of injuring the pilot. The Dummy Plug system is then activated, and 01 becomes a brutal monster. Toji looses and arm and leg.
After Shinki quits NERV, another angel attacks, taking out Units 00 and 02. Shinji then comes just in time, but Unit 01 runs out of power. After getting its arm cut off, 01 goes beserker, and gets an incredibly high sync ratio of 400 %. Unit 01 begins its ""Awakening"", eating the 14th Angel alive, and gaining an S^2 engine. Shinji has been absorbed into the Eva.
NERV attempts to rebuild him, while trying to conrol Unit 01, because its binding was melted off when it Awakening happened. While being ""rebuilt"", Shinji gets trapped inside his mind, going over experiences shut out by him.
This is where the true meaning of the series comes into better view. The mind and heart.",992304000,,1060,4.58421052631579
1418361,5,B00005ASO0,"Yes, at this point, the series begins amazing. Evengelion is (without doubt) the best animated series ever!!. The story, the graphics and the music here are the best around!. I'm not talking about the anime world, I'm talking about ALL animation world. The Director Hideaki Anno made a wonderful story, a incredible prouduct. You MUST to see this DVD!

1418362,5,B00005ASO0,"To sum it all up...Evangelion is the best series ever.  Hollywood would kill for the storytelling that is present in this series.  Although it is short(26 episodes plus 2 movies), the show is above and beyond all other anime.  Studio Gainax's best work ever.  In this volume, episodes 18-20, the story REALLY begins to get good.  The origins of the Eva are explored a little more, and Asuka's faltering mental state is beginning to take it's toll on her ability as an Eva pilot.  The disc itself is pretty much the same as the others before with the bare bones menu and galleries housing the wonderful anime within.

1418364,5,B00005ASO0,"If you've been buying the EVA DVDs from volume 1 - this is where it all pays off! - by far the best DVD so far. The plot's coming in thick and fast, questions are being answered and new ones are being asked. The angel battles are getting more and more spectacular, and visually stunning, and.... nah.... im gonna give too much away! All i can say is that more is said about the origins of the EVAs, and other surprises.
Extras are still a bit thin on the ground, just some profiles and trailers. It would be nice if there were a gallery of production sketches and such. The picture also lacks compared to other Anime DVDs like Cowboy bebop and trigun. Still though, content over quality! - and the content is goooood!",989193600,,717,4.358208955223881
1418365,5,B00005ASO0,"I don't know what else to say besides what's already been said. I'll just summarize it the best way I know how. If EVA is the best anime series ever (which it just might be), then episodes 18-20 have got to be the BEST ANIMATED ANYTHING I've ever seen. Holy geez, even the dub pulled off a great job. Buy this disc. Just friggin' BUY it.",988156800,2,337,4.121212121212121
1418366,5,B00005ASO0,"In short, nobody can tell you what happens on this DVD and it would be a shame if they did.  Anything you expect to happen won't, then will when you realize this, they do the opposite of what you're thinking, then once more doing the opposite of the opposite of that.  Needless to say this volume is worth every penny, because things REALLY are taking off now.  Just when you think one problem is solved, thousands of more mysteries pop up.  Every character you thought you knew so well you don't!  If you don't know already, follow the series order, DON'T skip ahead, and this volume will be a blast!!",987984000,,602,4.4363636363636365

7935764,5,B00005ASO0,"Shinji is 14. After his mother's death and long separation from his father he is summonded to Tokyo 3. His father tells him he must pilot a giant humanoid robot to protect the world from the invading angels. The angels and the Evangelion that Shinji pilots both have a secret. They were both alternate possibilities of humanity in the when the world began. There are many dark secrets and conspiracies afoot behind the scenes. Shinji has some major psychological issues and they are compounded when he meets his fellow pilots Rei and Asuka. Evangelion is the story of Shinji, and his fight to save the world and find happiness.

This is a very deep anime. You could watch it over and over, but still find a different meaning every time. The story is very heavy. The emotions of each characters are explored in depth. It's an older series, but the animation, voice acting, and music are all top notch. It is a near perfect series. My only beef with it is the final episode. The final episode is pretty much a psych evaluation of the main characters. When I first saw this series, I hated it b/c of the ending. Since then they have released ""Death and Rebirth"", and ""The End of Evangelion"". They wrap everything up very nicely. Evangelion is incredible and you should check it out.

7935765,3,B00005ASO0,"Neon Genesis Evangelion Directors' Cut: Resurrection is a DVD that contains ""director's cut"" versions of episodes twenty-one through twenty-three of the series.  The disc also contains the original versions of the episodes in addition to the ""director's cut"" versions.

There is additional footage added to the first two episodes on the disc that make the episodes longer, while some of the footage in the third episode was reanimated to include hints of something that happens in the Neon Genesis Evangelion film, The End of Evangelion.  I have to say that while the additional and revised scenes do provide some additional information, they really don't contain any major revelations that weren't included in the series.  In the long run, you really aren't missing out on much if you have only seen the original broadcast versions of episodes twenty-one through twenty-three.

The extras on this disc include a 21 minute sneak preview of a live-action Neon Genesi Evangelion film, a ""clean opening,"" a ""clean closing,"" DVD credits, and ADV trailers.

If you're a fan of Neon Genesis Evangelion who is trying to track down the individual DVD releases, then this disc is worth it to you if you're trying to have everything released for Neon Genesis Evangelion in your DVD collection.  However, if you're not a ""completionist collector"" and already have Neon Genesis Evangelion Collection :07, then you really don't need to get this release, unless you absolutely want to own the ""directors' cut"" versions of these episodes.  However, if you're missing Neon Genesis Evangelion Collection :07 and can only find this disc, then this disc would be worth picking up to fill in the gap, since you get both versions of the episodes on it.

7935767,3,B00005ASO0,"Neon Genesis Evangelion Collection 0:6 is a single DVD that contains episodes eighteen through twenty of the series.  During the episodes included on this disc, Shinji goes through a couple of situations that ultimately help to progress him from the whiny kid he had been to someone who is starting to develop a little more backbone.  It will be interesting to see how this change in Shinji's character affects the final few episodes of the series.

Animation-wise, it's obvious that shortcuts were being taken; I would assume that this was done in an effort to cut down on costs.  As the episodes progressed on the disc, it was obvious that the animation had less detail than earlier episodes in the series.  Also, it was very noticeable that animation was being reused.  In one section, I understood that the reused footage was being used deliberately for an effect; however, in other spots, it felt more like a ""cheat"" than for any real aesthetic reason.

In addition to the episodes on this disc, there are three extras.  The first is labeled as ""Character Bios""; the bios include a picture of the character and a brief text write-up.  The characters included in this feature are: Pen-Pen, Makoto Hyuga, Eva Unit 03, Thirteenth Angel, and Fourteenth Angel.  The next feature is ""ADV Website""; all this selection does it to take you to a screen that has ADV's website featured on it.  However, since ADV no longer exists, this link is rather irrelevant.  The final extra in this menu is the DVD credits.  In addition to these extras, some trailers are also included.

If you're a fan of Neon Genesis Evangelion and haven't either already picked up this DVD release or one of the DVD box sets that were released for the series, this could be worth adding to your DVD library if you can find it for a reasonable price.
