I loved the art. The attention to detail is wonderful! The music is good.",1371513600,,349,4.0
8314357,4,B001K98M82,Saiunkoku is a beautiful series set in a mythical kingdom recovering from a period of civil war. It has a good plot and interesting characters and is beautifly animated.,1242000000,,169,4.862068965517241
8314358,5,B001K98M82,"If you don't know what it's about, go to Wikipedia and type in: The Story of Saiunkoku and it will tell you more than the above reviews and better than I could do without giving away spoilers.

I've watched both the first season/series and most of the second.  The animation is excellent and exactly like the pictures you see depicted.  Young women and children have the big eyes, but everyone else looks normal.  There isn't as much of the simplistic animation where characters are shown with a major emotion that many people don't like in animation because it makes the anime look childish to American viewers.

Really, if you like a good plot with intrigue, but not too intricate that you can't tell what is going on, and you like romance then I'd advise that you buy this DVD.  It's an investment that you will be returning to time and time again just like a good book.

Oh, wait ... will there be books in English?  Only the future will tell since there are light novels and mangas in Japanese.

BUY IT!",1236211200,,1008,4.4945054945054945

If your wondering what it is about, well I can say it is a bit political but at the same time a ""chick flick.""  It has romance and comedy in it.  The animation is wonderful.",1232150400,3,258,4.0
