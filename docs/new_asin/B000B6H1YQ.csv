8082392,3,B000B6H1YQ,"This is a crime thriller with just a dash of noir. The story centers around detective Charlie Daines (Armand Assante). He is an old school detective with soldier's disease. He is working on a case of a man who live broadcasts his killings on the Internet. This are not just any killings, but of top CEOs. He is in competition with Adam (Raffaello Degruttola) a new school cop who is savvy with computers. Charlie's boss (Stanley Townsend) calls him a dinosaur. Charlie has an understanding wife (Clare Holman) who makes him live healthy.

The story centers around Charlie to the exclusion of everyone else. This is not a horror story as one might think looking at the DVD cover. I imagine it is a who-dun-it mystery, although you are not really engaged in figuring out who-dun-it as you are trying to dissect Charlie's life of ""my wife, mu kid, my work.""

The film is mildly engaging, although I got really tired of listening to Charlie cough up a lung. 2 1/2 stars

A New York cop dying is trying to solve one last case before dying, now comes the killer is killing people of the internet hense the name dot.kill. Its a race before the killer kills again, like I said seen one thriller you seen most of them.",1302480000,,401,4.025

8082395,2,B000B6H1YQ,"If you are looking to see a good horror movie, may I say that you won't find it here. This movie was a waste of time about a cop who is trying to catch a serial killer who kills then broadcasts the murders on the internet. Overall, just not interesting at all. Boring and a let down.",1141430400,,283,3.982456140350877
8082396,3,B000B6H1YQ,"'Dot. Kill', yet another direct-to-video horror/psychological thriller , sports the most redundant film title of all time.  I mean really people, why do you have the word ""Dot"" and an actual ""."" in the title?  Wouldn't it be pronounced ""Dot Dot Kill"" this way?  I have some serious issues with this ridiculous title.

Anyways, the film stars Armand Assante(doing his best Tony Soprano imitation)as an Italian New York City cop tracking a serial killer who kills his victims and simultaneously broadcasts their death live on the internet(and somehow on the big screen in Times Square).  Assante's character also is fighting lung and bone cancer.  His doctor wants him admitted to the hospital because Assante only has a week or two left to live, but Assante will hear none of it.  He just wants the doctor to give him some painkillers so he can keep working his case.  The doctor says no, so Assante calls a favor in on an ex-hooker he had previously busted to hook him up with some illegal morphine.  Meanwhile, the killer keeps killing people and Assante must fight his illness to catch him.

Assante gives a decent performance.  He grumbles, he stalks around pissed at all times, yells at his family, etc.  He's not bad but it just seems like he based his character on the idea of ""What if Tony Soprano was a cop?"".  The supporting cast is surprisingly good.  I don't really recognize any of them from any other movies but they do a fine job, especially Assante's boss:  the guy is a mumbling, angry police cheif.  Hilarity.

The movie is shot pretty well.  The filmmakers were obviously going for the whole dark, dank atmosphere of David Fincher's 'Seven'.  The camera work and editing is also pretty well done.  The script is good, although pretty obvious(if you can't figure out who the killer is at about the thirty minute mark then you shouldn't be allowed to watch movies).

Overall, 'Dot. Kill'(ugh, that title just irritates me)isn't a bad flick, but you've seen the story before many times:  from episodes of televison shows like 'Millenium' and the 'X-Files' to movies like the Japanese 'Kairo' and another recently released DTV flick named 'Devour'.  The story has been done to death, but 'Dot. Kill' puts a slightly different spin on it.  This is not a must-see flick by any means, but its not a horrible way to spend an hour-and-a-half.  Assante is good, the script is interesting but predictable, and overall the production values are excellent for a DTV film.  Check it out if there's nothing else at the video store, but I definitely wouldn't buy this one.",1132963200,4,2574,4.780045351473923
