1804165,3,B00007AJEN,Pretty typical for an exercise video. Tammilee Webb is good.,1443312000,,60,5.1
1804166,2,B00007AJEN,For beginners not me. Too simple no push.,1438214400,,41,4.25
1804167,5,B00007AJEN,Great product.,1436659200,,14,6.5
1804168,5,B00007AJEN,"Fast paced, fun (if you enjoy exercise, like I do), and it works",1433376000,,64,4.0

1804170,5,B00007AJEN,"I use this dvd all of the time, I very please with it.  I am very happy to have found it on amazon.",1411430400,,99,3.3043478260869565
1804171,4,B00007AJEN,I bought this trying to find other dvd's that would help keep me interested in exercising. I am a huge fan of Tamilee Webb since she put out the Leg of Steel VHS. I still love the Legs of Steel better but this is a start.,1396828800,,221,3.8260869565217392
1804172,4,B00007AJEN,"I love Tami, but this workout isn't at all what it's advertised to be (at least the advertisement that I read). It's a mixed up, part step cardio, part weights workout in segments. If that is what I wanted, that would have been fine. But I was expecting a nice 30 minute cardio as advertised. Bummed.
-----
The above was my original review, and that is all true. But I want to add, here more than a year later, that while I seldom use this DVD, I do use it. It's still not step, it's a hybrid with more body weight exercises and small weight exercises blended in. And it's pretty short (I needed more cardio and thought that is what I was getting). But, all that said, it's not a bad workout and I love Tamilee (so not annoying). Just know what the workout is before you buy as you will be disappointed otherwise (moving 2 stars to 4 stars).",1386460800,,841,4.229813664596273
1804173,3,B00007AJEN,I like Tamilee. I really like her stretching and strength videos. Her cardio videos are just ok. I found her hard to follow.,1376524800,,124,4.434782608695652
1804174,5,B00007AJEN,"She gives instructions perfectly, acts like she's right there with you, giving you encouragement as you go. I have to say, I'm looking pretty good lately!! I have a lot more energy, also. Great video! One I plan to use for many years :)",1374192000,,236,4.386363636363637
1804195,3,B00007AJEN,I prefer the Abs and Legs of Steel videos more. This one was different but I didn't care too much for the movements.,1355184000,,116,4.086956521739131
1804196,5,B00007AJEN,One of the first workouts i EVER did lol. Its not intense by no means unless your middle aged or your a couch potatoe that just want to do something to get the blood pumpin for a sec. Im giving it 5 stars because i did have fun with it back in the day around 2006. Now im doing turbo fire and insanity and jillian michaels dvds and this doesnt compare but i would do it again for a laugh or two LOL haha. Tamilee Webb is still a good trainer but this DVD is for older people or someone who just wants to do a little something. Not for Advanced exercisers or someone who wants HIGH cardio impact. But it made me smile when i watched it on youtube.. me doing MAMBOS back in the day haha!.,1325548800,,686,3.9782608695652173
1804197,5,B00007AJEN,I am really glad I bought these dvds. Tamilee kicks butt! She is very easy to follow and she does not sound all silly or corny giving instruction. I am working up a sweat. With eating right and doing these dvds you will lose weight. Its great to finally find something that is quick and effective.,1322524800,,297,4.321428571428571
1804198,3,B00007AJEN,"This is an okay video. I like to do a more intense workout personally, so I'd say this one is more for beginners trying to get more intense. It isn't bad, but it isn't exciting. I can't seem to get into it.",1312675200,,206,3.9285714285714284
1804199,4,B00007AJEN,"Working out with Tamilee is fun. I think she is a great multicultural coach who helps you to feel comfortable. All of the women in the workout have different shapes, and it really helps you to feel comfortable with your own body type. Every body just do not have her genes. As for the workout, I am happy to have seen the video. This one got destroyed with my other workout videos that I purchased, not due the product wearing out....but I will not repurchase this one. For me I think that you just need to remember to be careful with your weights, use them, keep moving, increase decrease the intensity, and don't forget to re-use your stair stepper. Fit to the Hits is the greatest workout for me, and I feel comfortable and have fun with it. This one feels more like work because I am not actually working out with Tamilee, and also because my abs will never look like hers. I just want to have fun. Taebo twists and turns for the abs is fun.",1309132800,,945,4.314606741573034
1804200,4,B00007AJEN,"Tamilee's workouts consist of a combination of isometrics, Pilates-style moves, and good old-fashioned repetitions.  I alternate this workout with her Tighter Assets Cardioblast (which burns more calories).  Thus, this weight loss workout is fine on its own, and is particularly effective when used in combination with Tamilee's more action-packed Cardioblast.  Both are demanding workouts, but I am a 59-year-old with arthritis, and I can still complete this workout.  A final advantage of this workout is that it only takes approximately 30 minutes.",1280707200,,551,5.682926829268292
1804201,5,B00007AJEN,I have this on VHS.... need to get the DVD!  Tami is fun! Her exercise videos are fun and a good work out! She knows alot about nutrition and exercise.... the exercises can be done by anyone at any level. You can always modify the moves and still get an excellent work out!,1272412800,,273,4.150943396226415
1804202,4,B00007AJEN,"This workout alternates between lower and upper body and is chaptered. The lower body portion uses a step and gets the heart rate up nicely while working legs and glutes at the same time. The last segment before the stretch is abs with a heavy dumbbell - very effective. The 10-minute bonus abs section focuses entirely on obliques - excellent to add on for a total of a 40-minute workout. I felt my obliques and glutes the next day and I consider myself advanced. I really like the workout, but have a couple of gripes (otherwise I would have given it 5 stars):
1. The Natural Journeys commercial plays at the beginning and cannot be skipped.
2. The body part Tamilee neglects is chest. I noticed this also with the I Want That Body DVD (which is otherwise an excellent DVD also).",1221782400,,781,4.507042253521127
1804203,5,B00007AJEN,"I had told a fit friend of mine to find me a workout DVD to help me get started on an at-home weight loss program and this is the DVD he gave to me.  I was extremely out of shape when I first popped this workout into the DVD player but found Tamilee to be comforting in helping me get stared.  There are two other girls who exercise with Tamilee and one to follow for an easier workout.  I started by following the girl in the back and found myself really feeling my muscles working.  I was very pleased with the whole DVD and have kept it as part of my workout rotation.

Another feature I was very please with was the Nutrition System menu located in the Special Features.  It gives wonderful advice on eating right, what to and what not to eat along with a meal guide.",1220400000,,771,4.140939597315437
1804204,4,B00007AJEN,"Once again I really like this DVD. It definately got me breathing hard/sweating, but I didn't feel like I was getting my butt completely kicked, which is a good thing for me. I'm the type of exerciser who likes to get my heart rate up moderately along with getting moderately sweaty. Similar to 'I Want That Body' this DVD is classic toning that, for me, becomes low-level cardio (the lower body step parts). Tamilee is a great instructor, she has a great speaking voice, and the moves are simple enough that one viewing prior to actually doing the workout should be enough for anyone 'learn' them.",1206144000,,598,4.650943396226415
1804215,5,B00007AJEN,"This is one of my favorite workout DVDs.  I've been a fan of Tamilee Webb for a long time now and I own several of her videos and DVDs.

On this DVD, Tamilee gives a lot of nutrition information including healthy food choices, and meal plans, and a terrific cardioblast workout.",1205280000,,278,4.431372549019608
1804216,5,B00007AJEN,"I love this workout because it's not too long, not too short, and it really gets my heart pumping. It's not just jumping around cardio either. It's got some isometric work as well as a killer squat series while keeping your heartrate up. By the end of the workout my buns are burning and I feel tight all over. Tami is no-nonsense in this DVD but her cueing is out of this world. She is very motivational. DVD also includes awesome 10 minute buns bonus session. It could be called a mini cardio workout because it too will get your heart pumping. I use this DVD every week and buy it as gifts for people every chance I get. Buy Cardio Blast. You won't be sorry.",1199664000,,661,4.253968253968254
1804217,4,B00007AJEN,"I liked Tighter Assets Cardio Blast a Lot more than Tighter Assets Weight Loss (see my 3 star review)!  Well chaptered with a good warmup and cooldown, this workout is approximately 33 minutes.

An apt title, there are several cardio blasts designed to get the heartrate up there!  There's quite a bit of impact, but can easily be modified.  No problems doing this workout on carpet.

The moves are very athletic and basic....not a huge ""fun factor"" on this one, but it gets the job done!

Recommend to intermediate/advanced.",1197936000,,525,4.842696629213483
1804218,3,B00007AJEN,"I like Tamilee's personality but her personality can't save this workout for me!  There's no ""fun factor"".  The moves are so basic (step up, step down) and you do one leg for what seems like forever before switching to the other side...it just went on and on.  And I was using my step!  I can't imagine how tedious and boring this one would have been without my step!

Also?  No chest OR back work!  Just arms and legs...I prefer a strength/circuit workout to cover all the bases!

I like Tamilee, but I didn't like this workout at all!  Try ""I Want That Body"" instead...there's still no chest work, but at least you're done in 15 minutes!",1197936000,,639,4.439655172413793
1804219,5,B00007AJEN,This product is great. I had her buns and abs of steel and they put me in the best shape for my wedding. Now this new video set is a great change that keeps my whole body guessing. I love how Tamy looks like a real person I can relate to!,1197417600,,238,3.6862745098039214
1804220,2,B00007AJEN,I am very advanced-- this is not advanced at all.  You won't break a sweat-- I recommend this for beginners...,1196899200,,110,4.5
1804221,5,B00007AJEN,"If you are consistent with your commitment to exercise, you WILL loose weight and get in shape with this workout.  Good for beginning and intermediate exercisers.  The workout is a half an hour, with the option of an extra & challenging 10-minute ""abs"" workout.  Workout is an ""A"" when compared to other popular at-home workouts & instructors.",1185580800,,343,4.982456140350878

1804223,3,B00007AJEN,"This is my first Tamilee Webb workout and I won't go into the specifics of the workout because that has already been beautifully covered by previous reviews.
  The DVD also has bonus features including a diet plan and nutrition information which I thought,being a DVD,would be Tamilee herself and/or a nutritionist going over the plan but instead you sit there and read the screen,like a book. This is a DVD, not a book, and I expected more.
  It also took awhile to get to the actual workout. There is no way to fast forward past the Natural Journey ad in the beginning,frustrating if you're in a hurry and want to get into your workout. All the music is generic,the same music used in older Leslie Sansone walks.
  The workout was well cued and easy to follow,I liked that, but some of the moves really hurt my lower back so I questioned the form on some of her steps.
  I recommend this for a quick 30 minute workout,just don't buy it for the special features,they are a big disappointment.",1183248000,,993,4.53932584269663
1804224,4,B00007AJEN,"I love the instruction of Tamilee, and even though her vids do not contain material for advanced exercisers to feel completely fatigued, I like the fact that on a ""slow day"" I can feel like I have accomplished something.  This video is great in that area - the moves are great for the lower body, just squeeze while you are doing the moves!!  The time flies, and I feel this is the perfect workout for a Friday, or for those days that you don't feel like, or just can't muster the energy for huffing and puffing.
Most of the work is done on the step, and if you have bad knees, this is definitely not for you.  The moves are mainly squats and lunges, with a little upper body mixed in.. I use 8 lb weights, and if nothing else,  I feel that I at least get a little bit of heart rate increase with the moves.  All in all, definitely worth the purchase.
P.S.  Make sure to stretch your legs on your own before this one, as she begins with the workout straight away without this...",1181865600,,978,4.2032085561497325
1804255,5,B00007AJEN,"I love Tamilee's videos... she is so sweet and polite. I am used to her older videos, so I was shocked to see her new self ten years later, but I love these DVDs just as much. Gets my heart pumping and I do break a sweat. It's not too challenging to the point where I can't do all of the reps, but it is enough that I feel the burn. I recommend this to anyone who does want Tighter Assets :).",1180656000,,392,3.792682926829268
1804256,5,B00007AJEN,"I have been doing aerobics for years, and actually started with Tamilee back with the Buns of Steel series.  Let me tell you, this workout will challenge you and make you work hard! But that's what we want right??  I really enjoy both workouts and am pretty much covered in sweat by the time I'm done.  And the first couple of times I did the Weight Blast one, I could not walk up my stairs the next day! It's a killer! But it does get better and I have noticed my legs getting stronger.  The greatest thing about these workouts is that you can make them more challenging as your skill level improves so you are constantly increasing your intensity to keep up with your fitness level.  I would recommend this to anyone, beginner or advanced, who is looking for something different and fun!",1178755200,,789,4.451388888888889
1804257,3,B00007AJEN,"After exercising with  ""I want that body"", I thought this would be a very good DVD.

I was very disappointed since this is not a cardio blast.

May be Tamilee is only good at toning exercise and not with

cardio. You don't burn calories nor your heart rate goes up.

Instead I like Kathy Smith's ""Peak fat burning"" video for aerobics

and Tamilee's ""I want that body"" for toning.",1174867200,,379,4.420289855072464
1804258,2,B00007AJEN,"I am an avid fan of Tamilee's workouts, but this one is not one of her best. I found the moves difficult to follow and not as physically challenging as choreographically challenging. I finished the workout frustrated and feeling that I hadn't really had a very good workout. The Tighter Assets for Weight Loss is a much better workout. This one was disappointing.",1172361600,,363,4.777777777777778
1804259,5,B00007AJEN,"E-x-c-e-l-l-e-n-t.... This is quick and it gets your heart pounding. If you don't have an 1/2 hour for fitness, then you aren't trying to get fit anyway!!! But just in case you have a legit reason for not having enough time to do the full workout, the ten minute ab section will definitely help you to not feel guilty!!! I couldn't hula hoop before I started doing this workout. I CAN hula hoop NOW!!!",1171238400,,401,4.4324324324324325
1804260,2,B00007AJEN,"When I purchased this video, I was looking for a good, quick cardio workout to do before going to work.  It takes FOREVER to get to the actual workout and there is no way to skip over the long company intro.  The workout itself is fine.  Tamilee Webb's experience shows in her seamless cues.  Some of it is a little cheesy, but challenging.  However, I am not impressed enough with the workout to regularly endure the long intro.  It is okay for a weekend when I have more time, but unused otherwise.",1170115200,,500,4.380434782608695
1804261,4,B00007AJEN,"This is a challenging workout.  I always break a sweat and I like how there are lots of moves which help build a strong core.  Tamilee is not too perky or annoying, and she's good at explaining the moves.  The two women working out with her look like Gym Class Barbie Dolls, but their abs give you something to aspire to.  The only thing I don't like about the DVD is that there is a long manufacturer's introduction that I couldn't skip or fast forward through.",1168905600,,462,4.337209302325581
1804262,4,B00007AJEN,"These workouts have excellent technique, quality instruction, and don't require very much space. They pack a punch, but can be modified to be simpler or more difficult depending on your energy level that day. Motivating and time efficient, anyone can benefit from adding these to their collections. Very advanced exercisers may not feel truly challenged but could use it for a light day.",1168473600,,387,5.158730158730159
1804263,5,B00007AJEN,I think that this is a great DVD my buns were aching the next day. It was easy to follow and you really FEEL the results! Highly recommended.,1163548800,,141,4.071428571428571
1804264,4,B00007AJEN,I've tried this a few times.  It's not as challenging as I thought it would be.  Didn't quite break a sweat.  Some moves take some getting used to.  Felt like I had two left feet until I did the workout a 3rd time.  Tami moves from routine to routine at a pretty quick pace.  Can be hard on the knees with the hopping and the fast-paced plies.  Will try again and see if the pliometric exercises do the job.,1162771200,,407,4.075949367088608
1804285,5,B00007AJEN,I love Tamilee workouts!  They are not too long but are quick and down to business.  In only 30 min she makes sure you get a serious workout making getting fit in no time def. possible.  I started using this after I gave birth to my first child.  I had a lot of weight to lose but not alot of time to devote to working out since I now have an infant.  This workout helped me get back in shape and set the tone for an overall healthy life style.  She helps you with letting you have a diet meal plan to acclerate your progress or an upbeat workout if movtivation is your weakness.  Whatever the case if you have 30 min def add this to your to do list...you deserve it!!!,1158278400,,669,4.0227272727272725
1804286,5,B00007AJEN,"What a great workout this is! I am pretty fit, with buns and hips as the area I want to see more improvement in. This DVD is perfect for that. I see terrific changes in both quads and glutes after just a few weeks with this DVD.

Equipment needed: a step and some good shoes, some hand weights later if the exercises start seeming too easy.

Most of this DVD is focused on lower body. Some squats and lunges are thrown in, but she has so much variety that you hardly notice. They are not the standard stand in place, boring variety. After working out one leg thoroughly, she throws in a very quick 2 1/2 minute upper body portion. If you prefer to have a more thorough upper body workout, you can skip through this section, then start on the other leg. She follows the other leg with another 2 1/2 minutes on upper body.

After the leg sections, she finishes with about 4 minutes on abs. I particularly liked this as all the exercises are different from other ab routines she does on her other videos.

What I especially like about this video is that it is easy to follow -- there is no complex choreography. I also like her voice as it is low and soothing and she doesn't chatter insanely. If you are a beginner exerciser, she has a person on the video you can follow who does not get on a step.

I also like that even though most of the exercises are on the step, it is not hard on your knees. There is no bouncing around at all. Many of the exercises are slow and controlled.

If you do the entire DVD, it is about 30 minutes. If you skip through the 2 upper body portions, it is 25 minutes. What I especially like to do is skip the upper body, then add 15 more minutes of lower body by doing Tamilee's ""I Want That Body"" and adding the bun section. Whew! What an amazing lower body workout!",1156291200,,1794,4.185507246376812
1804287,5,B00007AJEN,"I bought this to replace my worn out VHS version.
I love this workout,it's only 30 minutes,and you workout everything really well and effective,but in a short period of time.
Quite often work out to it in the AM, before going to work.
The instruction is easy to follow and no jumping around and hurting your joints. Also, shows easy to follow modifications if needed.
This is a more intermeditate short workout,but it is easy to pickup on.",1155168000,,439,4.641025641025641
1804288,4,B00007AJEN,"This is my first Tamilee video, and I am very happy with it.  The moves are fun and really work your core, buns & thighs.  Before purchasing the dvd I read that some of the reviewers thought it was too easy - I was skeptical at first but purchased it anyway.  I agree that it CAN be easy if you do not put your all into it - if you really get into it and add tons of energy you WILL get a great workout.  The moves are very energizing and FUN ~ my only tip is to not use this more than two times per week, because some of the moves are repetitious and you could get bored if you used this as your primary source for exercise.  I love repetition, because this is how you get the quickest results - but I also like to mix and match vids every week to always make my week of exercise interesting and inspiring.  Highly recommended!!!!",1151020800,,831,4.006060606060606
1804289,5,B00007AJEN,Easy to follow instruction. Great fun workout! TamiLee continually reminds you to keep your abs tight to gain the best benefits for your core muscles. It also worked the legs and buns well for a 30 minute workout. I used this video for three months three times a week and lost four inches off my hips and ten pounds! Great results for a short workout!,1144972800,,351,4.415384615384616

I am in moderately good shape, and this workout did get my heart-rate up, but it never really reached the intensity I was looking for. I think I get more out of breath doing the 10-minute buns workout at the end! This DVD would be good for people who are just starting to get back into shape (although the moves are pretty fast and may not be good for people with joint problems), as a warm-up for strength training, or for days when you don't really want to work out very hard.",1143676800,,580,4.281818181818182

I like to strength train with videos and equiment from The Firm, but I know that I need to give my muscles time to rest and to find more time to take care of my heart too.  I really enjoy this for that purpose.  I also find Tamilee Webb to be the least annoying instructor I have ever worked out ""with"" - and I've been building my video library for 10 years.

1804293,5,B00007AJEN,"I'm a cardio freak who constantly measure my heart rate to ensure that it has reaches its limit in order to burn fat. This DVD is good because the actual cardio section is about 25 minutes (excluding warm up). As we all know that the body only started to burn fat when you exercise for more than 20minutes. The moves are not difficult and yet it is effective enough to make you sweat. So, get it.",1141516800,,396,4.223684210526316

Tamilee is a good, motivating instructor. She cues from your point of view and gives instructions on how to properly do the moves. She's also cute and will ask for ""one more, please!""

Cardioblast has a short warm up and stretch and goes into floor cardio. You do not need any additional materials besides yourself, a sweat rag and some good shoes. The workout is broken down into ~5 segments, each with a song. The first song starts slow to warm you up more and the next few songs gradually increase in beats per minute so you get a good effective cardio workout. Tamilee incorporates ""core"" movements into the cardio, where you have to stick and hold the moves for a few seconds before going on. This cardio workout uses your arms, abs and legs effectively. There is a slower cool down song and a stretch at the end. Overall this workout goes about 35 minutes.

The Weightloss DVD uses a step and handweights to tone the body. Tamilee starts with a short warm up and stretch and then goes into one sided bun work on the step. That lasts about 9 minutes. Then you do a short arm workout and go to the other side of your buns for another 9 minutes. This is again followed by more arm work and eventually some ab work and a cooldown. This video goes about 35 minutes and even though it is not traditional cardio, your heart rate will still increase a bit and you will probably be very sweaty.

I find that either workout alone is good for a day when I am pressed for time, but that combining the workouts back to back is very effective.

Tamilee has 2 other women on set with her and Cindy (back, left) does the beginner modifications and does the Weightloss workout without a step. You will get a better workout with a step though.

These DVD's also have a lot to offer as far as ""extras"" - There is a nutrition guide and some recipes and on each DVD there is an extra 10 minute toning segment - one has 10 minute buns and one has 10 minute abs that is a rough workout and works mainly the obliques.

Overall, these are solid workouts that have both cardio and toning.",1139875200,,2150,4.3734335839598995
1804326,3,B00007AJEN,"Not my favorite Tammy's video.  Only half an hour and mostly on a step.  I ""Want that Body"" from her it's a lot better.",1129507200,,119,3.9166666666666665

This workout is supposed to be a strength training video, but I like it because it raises my heart rate up but still doesn't make me jump all over the place.  The workout is about 30 minutes.  There are 6 total segments: 2 for lower body (done on the step, lots of squats, lunges, Tamilee's signature moves!); 2 for arms (not as challenging as ""I want that body"" - but it goes by quickly; a short but effective ab workout; and then a quick stretch at the end.  I like this dvd a lot.  It goes by quickly, and you feel it burning.  Definitely one to throw into the mix.",1125619200,,682,4.082706766917293
1804330,5,B00007AJEN,"This is a fantastic cardio workout!  Tamilee knows how to get your heart pumping and your body sweating.  I've worked out with several instructors and Tamilee's the best.  I consider her my personal trainer.  She's not overbearing.  She's easy to follow and very knowledgeable.  You'll learn the routine after just a couple of times.  This workout is 30 minutes long, so I like to follow it with her ""I want that Body"" video for some nice ab and arm toning.  Tamilee works out with only 2 other girls so you don't get distracted watching a lot of different people working out at different paces.  The instrumental music is great and not at all annoying. I highly recommend this workout to anyone who's got 30 minutes and willing to burn some fat & calories!!",1121299200,,758,4.639097744360902

Tamilee is a great instructor - she cues so well I don't have to look at the screen anymore. I would say it's high intermediate esp. if you do more pylometric hops while she's explaining the next move. I make it a little more high impact and it really gets my heartrate up!,1115856000,,438,4.226190476190476

I have been using this video for a week. And it is great except for some of the moves require a bit of thinking (The scoop, I cannot figure out in my half asleep state), which with a 2 year old, a 6 month old, two 100 pound dogs running around can be a bit diffcult to handle things like the scoop. And I am breastfeeding and fairly well endowed currently, and all the jumping is generally leaves me with a Breastmilk soaked bra and shirt...

1804357,3,B00007AJEN,"I did this workout religiously for several months. I really loved it at first. It got my heart pumping and really worked my legs. I was sore every time.

Then I developed lower back problems. I doubt that the workout caused the problem (at least not directly), but after every workout, it definitely contributed to the pain. This workout consists nearly exclusively of squats and lunges, which -- as my physical therapist explained to me -- compress the spine. That translated to wicked low-back pain.

I also imagine this isn't a great workout for those with weak knees. Tamilee gives fine instructions, but she moves so quickly in the squats and lunges that it's just flat-out tough to make sure your knees aren't going past your toes and you're not overextending your back.

I still give the video 3 stars because I really loved it at first, it got me motivated to exercise and I definitely felt results. Just BEWARE if you think you might be prone to back or knee trouble, and avoid this disc if you are.",1110326400,,1008,4.620111731843576
1804358,4,B00007AJEN,"I've had this DVD for about a year, and it has consistently remained one of my favorites. It's a solid, tough workout. At 30 minutes long, it includes chunks of plyometric moves - meaning jumps and hops that I find invigorating but might be tough for those with bad knees. The workout is broken up into a handful of segments. It gradually increases in difficulty, peaks, then lightens back up. Only the last segment seems to drag. (Tamilee says, ""We're almost done ..."" as though she's winding down, only to begin the set anew instead.) I always break a sweat with this video. Tamilee is one of my favorite instructors (and, as my husband will attest, I'm something of a workout DVD-aholic, so I've tried many!)

This instructor is no-nonsense, but still polite. She even says things like, ""Two more, please,"" which keeps me liking her. Her two sidekicks, meanwhile, have no personality whatsoever. Luckily, they don't detract from the workout; they just don't add to it. In the end, my use of this video has been somewhat sporadic. I'll use it a few times a week for several months, then forget about it for a month or two before dusting it back off. The bottom line, though, is that I always come back to it. It's a solid, straightforward cardio routine.",1110326400,,1256,4.657657657657658

Challenging, but can be modified for the out-of-shape (like I was when I started doing these workouts)

Not cheesy

Good timing/queues

Good understanding of muscle groups worked/purposed of exercises

Not boring...I have not grown tired of these and have used them over and over

Try the 'extra' 10-min abs - you will definitely feel it!

Also a fan of Kathy Smith, Cindy Crawford (Total Challenge) and Windsor Pilates",1109721600,,588,4.81

I am a pear shape, which means my waist is not an issue, but my J.LO butt (however, not toned) makes me look heavier than I really am.

1804362,4,B00007AJEN,"I purchased this DVD with the hope that it truly combines a cardio workout with toning because I rarely have time to do both seperately. Many workouts make this claim and do not live up to it, but this one absolutely provides a 2 in 1 work out.

This is the most challenging workout I've tried to do since hurting an ankle last summer, & I could not have done this before fully recovering.  You have to be able to bounce, lunge & squat at a quick pace to get the most out of this work out.

This dvd gets 4 out of 5 stars from me because I feel the need to add 5 min of my own leg stretches to the warm up section -  it is a little too short in my opinion considering the demand the workout puts on your muscles & joints.",1106870400,,721,3.8843537414965987
1804363,4,B00007AJEN,"Tamilee Webb's 2 DVD set is the best!  She has you working hard without a steep learning curve.  If you have read my other reviews, then you know that I hate videos with complicated steps or poor instructions.  Tamilee knows her stuff and she shares that knowlege with you.  You learn how to do each move the right way every time.  The Weight Loss DVD is my favorite, but you should note it requires a step.  The first few times I tried it, my legs felt like jelly afterwards.  When I was able to get through the whole workout, there was a tremendous feeling of accomplishment.  The lower body workout is strenuous without being exhausting.  When I've complete the video, I feel energized rather than depleted.  Tamilee's cueing is efficient and her timing is excellent.  There are only a few minor negative points; the music is a little bland and the two women who are exercising with Tamilee are too perfect to seem real.  I really appreciate it when workout videos show normal looking people.  That being said, these videos are two of my favorites.  I never seem to tire of them.",1106006400,,1082,4.567708333333333

I have stronger than average legs and took on this new workout - I am now getting a superb leg workout --- I cannot say enough about this video!! I do like how Tamilee incorporated the step in this video and the option to continue to increase the fitness challenge.  I also really like the arm workout.  This also allows for the ever so needed break after the first leg workout --- just in time to go back for some more!  By the time this video ends, time has flown by - as it does require your full attention.  (The music is gret too!)  Tamilee once again uses her no nonsense, straight forward approach to deliver a workout that kicks butt and then some!  If you do this workout properly, you'll have an elevated heartrate, end up drenched in sweat, and soon see the desired results!  *** It is easy to add on another video(s) to make this workout even more challenging.",1105401600,,975,4.260869565217392

I have also taught fitness for several years and was looking for something now that I no longer teach.  It's a great cardio workout for home to combine with another.  I like the music too (it's not the goofball music a lot of videos choose) and the combinations used are motivating/creative and keep my attention.  It's not boring - it does challenge you to follow the routine but isn't so intricate that it takes too long to catch on (I caught on by the second try). Tamilee does a super job cueing and explaining the moves in her no nonsense, straight forward manner.  It gets my heartrate going and I sweat a lot by the end.  I think it is up to you whether you choose to make it a tougher workout, and Tamilee takes the time to explain how to make it the best workout for your level of fitness.  I give this a top rating ----",1105401600,,915,4.218390804597701
1804375,4,B00007AJEN,"I've only tried the CardioBlast DVD of this set so far.  I bought it after reading good reviews here.  I'm pretty satisfied with it.  I am a fan of Tamilee's workouts in general, so I knew going in that this would be good quality.  I've been pretty skeptical of ""aerobics"" workouts in the past because they don't usually seem to get your heart rate up that much in such a short amount of time.  This DVD is different!

This workout looks pretty simple, but it's actually far more challenging than it looks.  Beginners like me will find it hard to keep up at first.  Take several water breaks.

My only complaint is the pace of the DVD.  The choreography isn't as basic as some people make it out to be; I think it will take me several more tries to get it down.  It was frustrating to be behind or using the wrong feet, etc.  If you have two left feet like me, be patient with this workout.  Even if you aren't going the right direction or doing the arm movements exactly right, your heart is still pumping and that is what is impt.

Overall, it's a high energy cardio workout that really makes you burn calories.  A good buy!",1104019200,,1126,4.295238095238095

1804377,2,B00007AJEN,"My biggest complaint about this DVD is there is virtually no warm-up and an insufficient cool down.  In addition, although you will break a sweat, the movements are very jerky, and at times very fast paced, although for short intervals.  Its a fast workout right out of the box -- there is nothing to build up to.  And, I could see how someone could seriously hurt themselves using this DVD by trying to keep up.  The 10 minute abs is o.k.  Another overall comment I have is she does not ease into things and explain them very well.  I'm sure there must be better out there -- but this is not it.  I doubt I'll use it again.",1096934400,,624,4.237288135593221
1804378,5,B00007AJEN,"I started running in April 04 and since I live in MN and winter is on the way,  I wanted to prepare myself by finding some good cardio workouts to use when I can't be outside.  I have given away many and spent way too much money on stupid, hard to do, ineffective workouts.  Tamilee is the best there is (at least from what I've found thus far and I have TRIED MANY)!  Truthfully the first time I tried the Cardio Blast I was bugged because I was lost a lot and couldn't keep up.  I am so glad today that I gave it a another shot.  The second time through I got it and from that point forward I have ""worked out to music only"" - What an awesome feature!!!  I do the Cardio Blast in the mornings with no narration and it's  just me and the music and Tamilee kicks my ass everytime.  There are two girls with her, a modifier and a higher intensity example.  Great for all levels - once you've learned the routines that is, but don't give up.  The third time round is the charm!!  I know it well enough now that I can read her lips and know what's coming.  Anyway - I really like the movements, the progressions, the different routines and I just like Tamiliee.  She cues better than most!!  The Weight Loss is good  too (you should have a step and some hand weights) - but I don't like it as much as the cardio workout .  You do one side lower body, arms, other side lower, arms again, abs and cool down.  To d them both is a great 1 hour workout if you have the time.  They're good on their own as well.",1095465600,,1502,4.030508474576271

There's a quick warm-up, followed by four short segments, then a cool-down/stretch segment. The moves are not difficult at all, but are intense.

She has a great ten minute bun feature on the DVD and you even have the option of just working out to the music once you get the routine down.  Thats a plus.  The reason I havn't given it five stars is because at the beginning of the dvd there is a two minute infomercial that you cannot fast forward through or even skip.

I was at a weight loss plateau (after losing 25lbs post-pregancy)and after doing this DVD for one week I lost three very stubborn pounds.  If you are an advanced exerciser, you can use a step bench to increase the intensity(modifications at all levels are shown), but it is not required. The workout is not Tamilee's usual one-on-one style, she has two younger women doing the routine with her. In the DVD she says that one is ""in her 20's"" (tall & lean), the other is ""in her 30's"" (short and muscular) and then there's Tamilee who says she is ""in her 40's"" but with her tight body (complete with the requisite belly ring!)she would put most high school girls to shame. By the way, there is a 10 minute abs section which you will feel the next day.  The sound quality is very good, and the music is the typical pulsating aerobic dance style.
