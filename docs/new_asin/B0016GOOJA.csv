There are scenes that make you cry - and scenes that make you laugh !  You watch the movie wondering if they will ever overcome the cultural gap.  You wish her mother would just go away and stop !  You wish he'd lighten up just a bit - but in the end. Love does win even though a child was used the instrument of power. You know he loves his wife when he and his brother concoct the "" constable "" routine.  Just the funniest thing !  I gave this movie a four because of the slapping.  I have watched enough Hindi movies to know that it is common, but...still...from a western POV it makes me shudder. But aside from those two/three times - the movie is fun.  The music was good and the clothing was a nice mix of contemporary Western/HIndi.
The ending was gratifying.  See it !",1360972800,,923,4.15819209039548
8285916,3,B0016GOOJA,"Like director Lingusamy, who followed up the soft Aanandham with the masala flick Run, Azhagamperumal too takes the masala route with Joot after Dum Dum Dum, his first movie. But one wishes he hadn't followed Lingusamy this closely. Joot is little more than a rehash of Run(with a little bit of Dhool thrown in) without the handling that made the original a first-class entertainer.",1301356800,,382,4.984375
