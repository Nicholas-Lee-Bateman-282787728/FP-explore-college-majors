3157506,4,B0016JHHWI,I only wish this FILM could be restored.  I love this movie. I saw it with my mom who is with our Lord JESUS CHRIST.  Simone Simon was so cute in this film. James Stewart was a perfect Chico. What a beautiful film that captured a piece of France frozen in time that we could not imagine today.. What a TREASURE....JANET CREIGHTON (LOUISIANA),1395878400,5,341,4.396825396825397
3157507,1,B0016JHHWI,"Product was hard to find, so it was great to find it, but there is a static picture glitch in first 30 min of film.  I tried to contact vendor several times to get replacement, but no response.",1376438400,3,193,4.078947368421052
3157508,5,B0016JHHWI,Like many others I first viewed this film on TV in the early 60's. I wish it were available on DVD. It is a powerful story with great actors and wonderful sets. A much overlooked work of Jimmy Stewart. I could not even find this at the Jimmy Steward Museum. It needs to be available.,1329696000,5,283,4.163636363636364
3157509,5,B0016JHHWI,"I remember seeing this movie on TV in the fifties as a child.  I was 10 I think, and i fell head over heels  in love with Simone Simone and Jimmy Stewart was so real, so human.  It seemed to reinforce in my young mind the strength and permanence of love, the purity of love.  The emotions I felt have never left me even though I can't really remember very much in particular.  I agree with the other review that this film should be remastered here in the states.  It doesn't make sense that one of film's greatest stars has a seminal film that isn't available for purchase.  This copy is the only one I've found and I think it was preserved because of the Franco regime which only allowed classic films to be shown on Spanish TV.  Thank goodness for small favors, and in this case it was a big one.",1305936000,11,798,4.203947368421052
3157510,5,B0016JHHWI,"I don't understand why this has never been released onto DVD in the U.S. This movie left a lasting memory with me after seeing it only once. Throughout the movie Chico's unshakable optimism is apparent when he continually reminds us that, ""I'm really quite a remarkable fellow"" as he continues cleaning the underground sewers. His developing romance with the prostitute he rescues is quite touching. This is one of James Stewarts earliest movies and remains one of my favorites. His athleticism is apparent as he easily runs up 7 flights of stairs.",1299801600,15,548,4.967391304347826

8262901,4,B0016JHHWI,Glad to see another Jimmy movie released.,1478649600,,41,5.0
8262902,5,B0016JHHWI,One of my favorite love stories. Simone Simon was excellent and James Stewart did his part with the  best acting of his career. Good supporting cast also.,1470355200,,154,4.703703703703703
8262903,5,B0016JHHWI,Just a plain ol' good tear jerker.,1464998400,,34,4.0
8262904,5,B0016JHHWI,"Movies just don't get better than this! Simply breathtaking study of the common man struggling to find greatness in his menial job as a Paris street sweeper. This was the first of many roles to showcase Stewart as the mundane,  fundamentally good guy who doesn't even recognize his own capacity for greatness. His portrayal is flawless...sit back and be prepared to be ""swept"" away by Stewart's gift!",1453420800,3,400,4.970149253731344

8262906,5,B0016JHHWI,"This is a good tear-jerker, unavailable in a good print for much too long.  It is not a great movie, but it has Jimmy Stewart and Simone Simon; and that is enough.",1428624000,4,163,4.09375
8262907,1,B0016JHHWI,"With Stewart as the male lead, they should have tried to Americanize it somehow...because proud, blasphemous Parisian sewer rat he ain't. A silly set-up made worse by this miscasting, Seventh Heaven briefly rallies when these two charismatic performers start to spark--no matter how ineptly--before WWI comes along and queers the whole deal. Perhaps a curiosity rental for hard-core James Stewart fans...but most people will be well advised to steer clear of Seventh Heaven.",1427414400,,474,5.506849315068493
8262908,5,B0016JHHWI,Was named after this movie,1416182400,2,26,4.4
8262909,5,B0016JHHWI,"A great movie.  Saw this movie as a kid one summer in late 1970's, and haven't seen it but once since then.",1405728000,,107,3.8636363636363638
