6422782,5,B00KE2BW92,Awesome movie (and I love FlyinDog beer too so anyone who knows that beer inadvertently knows Ralph Steadman) - very informative movie with an endearing glimpse at Johnny Depps love of art.,1412553600,,189,4.9375

6422784,5,B00KE2BW92,I love Ralph Steadman and his art work.  I learned a lot from this DVD and it made me appreciate him and Hunter S Thompson all the more.  They both are geniuses!!,1412121600,2,162,4.03125
6422785,2,B00KE2BW92,"A bit dull and getting rather tired of seeing Johnny Depp in everything and anything about Hunter (or, in this case, one of Hunter's main associates/friends/conspirators).

Steadman and Hunter fans will learn very little if anything that they don't already know from this documentary and anyone else wouldn't really care.

It was also slow-paced and repetitive in parts.

Fear & Loathing in Gonzo Vision remains the best documentary on the subject (includes a lot of Ralph) or check out Wayne Ewing's various docs, especially Breakfast With Hunter.",1411344000,10,548,5.275862068965517

6422790,5,B00KE2BW92,"I knew Welsh artist and painter Ralph Steadman mostly from his work in the early years of Rolling Stone Magazine. I knew he did illustrations for Hunter Thompson's book ""Fear and Loathing in Los Angeles"" too, but, I admit that I've never actually read that book.  When you see a Steadman illustration you know that it is him, and no one else.
During the 90 minutes of the documentary film that forms the core of this BD combo pack release, I learned a lot about Steadman - in his own words (he self-narrates part of it) - and Thompson as well (he also does some of the narration). For ""star power"" there is their friend, actor Johnny Depp who hangs with both of the guys and offers some comments as well - though he's in the background much of the time.  Other folk you would know are Monty Python's Terry Gilliam (whose animated films were certainly influenced by Steadman) and Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner and actor Tim Robbins.

The images shown are really crisp on the Bluray and a real treat is seeing Steadman's illustrations animated by a person whose name I forget -and it's not on the package credits.  I'll highly suggest that you watch this sober the first go through, though it'll probably be a different experience if your mind is ""enhanced"" by a bit of alcohol or other mind changing substance.  (no I'm not advocating it; just saying...)

Steadman and Thompson were the pioneers of ""Gonzo journalism"" and no mainstream film has covered their careers like this one.

There are LOTS of bonus features to keep you busy for at least a few more hours. There is a full length Director/Producer commentary, extended interviews, deleted scenes, an extra animated short and a Q&A with both Steadman and Director Charlie Paul from the Toronto Film Festival screening.

Anyone familiar with Steadman's iconic artwork or read Thompson's writing will definitely want to see this. And there are enough bonuses that you'll probably want to pick up the BD, since the bonuses are not on the ""Instant"" and ""streaming"" versions.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6422791,5,B00KE2BW92,If the DVD is even better than the film (with great extras) then it is a MUST buy for anyone interested in art or documentary or even 20th century history....,1405296000,2,158,4.3
6422792,5,B00KE2BW92,"Brings back fond memories of Hunter Thompson.  Well worth the time for a behind the curtain look at the man, Ralph's art and interaction.  I should have purchased it.",1482710400,,166,4.689655172413793
6422793,2,B00KE2BW92,"I wish there was a different sort of rating here but this will have to do. I'd like to give it 5 stars for getting to know Steadman as a person. And one star for having to watch the horrific scenes accompanying his violently furious artwork.
I enjoyed all the interview sections of this documentary. Steadman seems like a very kind person, as well as talented & intelligent. So that was good  to discover.
I've always been extremely disturbed by his art work. I majored in art in college and studied all sorts of artists, from Rembrandt (who gets his own section of this film) to DeKooning (whose artwork also disturbs me).
The trick of showing drawings in various stages, almost like animation, was interesting. Watching Steadman's art go from a blob splashed on paper, to a horse, was fascinating.
For fans of Steadman and Hunter S. Thompson (like my husband, who spent 3 days 24/7 with Hunter S. Thompson in the early 90s & tells these stories over & over again), this film will please them.
But the endless shots of horrific tragedies (people dying in Vietnam, starving children in Biafra, people being bashed with billysticks in civil rights demonstrations) paired with Steadman's artwork was an assault on my soul.
I don't like his endless hatred toward religious people, either. It would have helped to have heard why he has so much hate toward religion. I can understand his anger at injustice.
It felt as if someone had beaten me with a baseball bat after watching this film. And I covered my head during the Vietnam sections, having suffered a lot during that horrible time period.
Steadman is geniuinely gifted and his goal ""to change the world"" is admirable. I wish his art had changed the world. Sadly, people are still dying in unjust wars, babies still starve, people are still beaten & killed by police officers.
So the conclusion of the film was depressing, with Steadman nearly crying over his inability to change the world & Johnny Depp fighting back tears over Hunter S. Thompson's tragic life.
The inclusion of Hunter S. Thompson's suicide was essential to the story but also horrible.
William S. Burroughs, in all his insanity, was also part of this film. He has turned me way off since he shot his wife in the head during a drunken fit. I do not laud these messed up people & their endless life failures (Thompson, Burroughs et alia). Steadman is not in that group. Yes, he interacted with these people & loved Thompson. But he has lived his life on a lovely farm, away from all that madness.
I love Johnny Depp but his grunts & nods & mumbling did nothing to enchance the story. It was like he was trying to channel the spirit of Hunter S.
I was glad to find out how truly kind a person Steadman is. But I still cannot bear to look at his art.",1480204800,,2767,4.58989898989899

6422811,5,B00KE2BW92,This documentary was better than I expected. I even listen to it at night falling asleep. I would recommend this to my artistic friends. It defiantly cheered me up.

6422812,5,B00KE2BW92,"The mild, tender and compassionate nature of Steadman is juxtaposed brilliantly with his unique process and content of his representation--of the sordid, disreputable underbelly of the world and the pain and injustices it so inhumanly inflicts.  Most people that are aware of such things don't have the audacity to represent them if they could while here their existence is undeniable.  The images are explosive and potent and then when interspersed with old footage of Hunter S. Thompson, interviews by Johnny Depp, stories of rabble-rousing and road trips, the spoken word of William Burroughs and an eclectic, edgy soundtrack the effect is captivating, provocative and, at the same time, down right intoxicating.",1427068800,3,715,5.4324324324324325

6422821,5,B00KE2BW92,"I was so happy to discover this documentary about Ralph Steadman today!  I had the great fortune to meet him in 1992 and to play a role in a BBC film he created for television about the environment. I loved watching it !  It captures thoroughly the spirit of the times we live in from the 1970's up to the present, and the beautiful soul of the man who communicates them through his drawings. To know Ralph, is to know that his life is committed to making our world a better place. Through his relationships with his family, friends, illustrations, books, conversations, & courageous mindset - he has certainly brightened our world ! The music is superb & getting to see Ralph with Johnny Depp is definitely a plus. I highly recommend this film. It is an absolute joy and holds an important place in history for us all. By highlighting the dark - Ralph brings us into the light.",1413590400,6,878,4.48125

8658010,2,B00KE2BW92,"The film itself, as far as content and insight is concerned was pretty good.  The atrocious, moody, corny music absolutely destroyed this film.  It absolutely shifted the center of gravity of the film full aft and augured it into the dirt.",1491350400,,239,4.804878048780488
8658011,5,B00KE2BW92,"Omg, I want to marry Ralph Steadman. This made me feel like even as a child I had brilliant ideas as an artist. His technique specifically, was impressive. What an amazing man and incredible talent. Absolutely brilliant. That Depp kid was in it too. He's kind of nice to look at I guess.",1488326400,,287,4.433962264150943
8658012,5,B00KE2BW92,"Overall, I'd say this film is fantastic. I'm not exactly a Johnny Depp fan, and feel he was in the film too much, but otherwise, the documentary  was very well worth watching.

I greatly appreciate that there is lots of old film footage. Being able to watch the artist create a painting on camera is also something I quite liked. I not only admire Steaman's art and style, but his enthusiasm as well.

Hunter S. Thompson fans will be quite pleased. There's lots of Thompson (footage, stories about him, etc.) in this film.

Even if you are not very familiar with Ralph Steadman (the artist) or Thompson, but are interested in art and the creative process, I think you will enjoy this film.

I got it from the library, and liked it so much, that despite Depp's at times annoying presence, I bought the film. After watching it several times, I feel quite inspired to pursue creating my own art. Thank you very very much, Mr. Steadman!",1485648000,,932,4.5568862275449105
