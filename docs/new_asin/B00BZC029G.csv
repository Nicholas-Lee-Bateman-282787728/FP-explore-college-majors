5683056,5,B00BZC029G,"The following contains spoilers. Reader discretion is advised.

There is something that I must admit before I get too far into praising this anime. I dropped it the first time I watched it. I wasn't at all excited by the fact that the plot was moving slowly and the characters sat in a room and didn't seem to do much of anything. After being asked to reconsider my thoughts and give Steins;Gate another look, something I rarely do unless someone has a really strong argument for my doing so, I find myself perplexed by the fact I dropped this show that molests your very soul with emotion and feeling, the kind of thing that very few anime have the ability to do.

Let me start by addressing why I quit the first time and why I feel stupid for doing so. The slow pace of the first third of the series is actually really well done when you can look back and realize that it is not meant as much to progress the plot at a fast pace, but rather to show off the wide array of characters and get you invested in at least one or even two. Which does happen, believe it or not. Despite only ten episodes or so of this character building, theres a certain humanity to every character that you rarely find in a single character in a longer anime. When the entire cast is like that, you know youve reached something akin to god-like.

But thats not to say the story is something to disregard, because it is also really good. Our main character, Rintaro Okabe, is an eighteen year old scientist who lives in a tiny apartment above an electronics store. He considers himself a mad scientist and has these little bouts where he talks to his cell phone about The Organization catching on to him and his lab. Hes not really mad, just seemingly bored with his life. He invents quite a few things with his trusty companion Daru, but its within the confines of a basic, uninteresting life. Soon enough, though, he winds up creating a time machine using a microwave. This is where all his troubles start and that boring life he had becomes a life of pain, suffering, and misery, but also a life of new friends and new loved ones.

The anime starts with Okabe taking his childhood friend, Mayuri Shiina, to a conference concerning the possibility of time travel. During this conference a strange object crashes into the roof and Okabe finds a young scientist, Makise Kurisu, lying dead in a storage room. From here, things go from bad to weird when he answers a mail and finds himself in a world where Makise is alive and well. On top of that, his texts to Daru had arrived a week early. This leads the members of Okabes Future Gadget Lab to believe that the creation that they have been working on, a modified microwave, is a time machine.  As they learn more about time travel, they find out that SERN, a European organization known for their particle accelerator, already created a time machine, but every experiment they did concerning a physical object turned said object into a gooey, gelatinous mass. They learn that in lieu of physical objects, they can send texts to the past to change the future.

With the help of Makise, Okabe winds up finding himself on a variety of world lines, essentially parallel timelines, with every text to the past he makes. With every new line, he seems to be the only person who can remember anything that happened in the previous lines. He eventually winds up in a world line where he decides to make his discovery of a time machine public. Before he can, though, SERN attacks and kills Mayuri, leading him into a continual cycle of going back in time to save her. It never works though. What he eventually learns from a time traveling girl named Suzuha Amane is that in the future, SERN controls everything in a sort of Orwellian dystopia. In order to save the world from that fate, he must return to the original timeline where Mayuri doesnt die. To do that, he must undo every text that the members of the lab have sent, as well as his own.

Along the way, he discovers he has very deep feelings for Makise, and she for him, and this is all when he realizes that if he returns to the original world line, Mayuri will live, but Makise will die. Despite this, he returns to that line and learns from Suzuha, who has traveled back in time in her time machine, that he can save Makise from dying and prevent World War III by doing so. With that in mind, he proceeds to save Makise, save Mayuri, and save the world.

Talk about an epic plot.  Its dramatic, it has far reaching consequences, and the plot may start slow, but never lets up after a certain point.

As I said previously, Steins;Gate is really as good as it is because of its cast of characters, more so than its plot. Okabe, our hero, is both hilarious and at times, a deeply involving character. While you don't see it at first, he has a wide array of emotions aside from arrogant and cocky. He develops so nicely, and while that development isn't the deepest of any character ever, its still fun to watch him accept his friends not as much as assistants and more so as family.

Makise Kurisu is one of the best tsundere characters to ever grace anime for a number of reasons. First of all, she isn't annoying like many characters of her type. She is, in fact, a very smart girl who just has an awkward friendship with a guy who calls her his assistant and treats her like shes in on his role plays. The fact of the matter is, despite how much arguing she does with Okabe, the bond that develops between the two is very heartfelt and meaningful. Despite the fact she forgets pretty much every major development that they have with every change in world line (minus the last world line), she still manages to move forward, rather than stay stoic. The fact that she broke Okabe out of his shell and made him show emotions toward another instead of seeming indifference made her just that much better. When she kisses Okabe, it tugs at the heartstrings. Its a beautiful moment that isn't destroyed by stupidity and never looked back upon as some sort of joke, but it becomes the emotional basis for the final episodes of the series. I, personally, find it to be one of the best relationships in an anime because of how much growth the two go through because of it, and the new Okabe that emerges that will do anything to save his love from dying.

The other real major character is Mayuri. I cant say a lot about her, because I wasn't emotionally invested in her. She was a good character to work off of Okabe and a fun character to watch help him develop, but the only real reason youll probably love her is the fact that Okabe does. You see her die so many times and have to feel those same emotions that Okabe does. It comes as a major surprise that she dies, my jaw dropped when it happened. And dropped again and again. Shes the sweet, innocent girl who doesnt deserve to die, but, as I said, it isn't for that reason that you find yourself possibly shedding a manly tear over her, its the fact that Okabe is continually watching his lifes companion get killed.

Ruka is the last character I want to address in any sort of depth. Im not a fan of cross-dressers, but he was pretty cute. And she was pretty cute. I was on the fence about his wanting to be a girl. It was a strange area to enter, made stranger by the fact that when he did become a she, Okabe raped her. Made stranger by the fact shes in love with him. Maybe its because I was so invested in Okabe that I felt the way I did about he/she. Ruka is cute, but hes a guy. The episode where Okabe has to go on a date with female Ruka is pretty hilarious, probably one of the funniest episodes of the series.

There are a ton of other characters, but none that are really of a lot of note. I was amazed by the sheer difference in the characters, all of them played off each other well and none were too alike. On top of that, the way they acted was just human enough that it was believable. The writing is so beautiful to be able to evoke emotions and create a world as believable as Steins;Gates.

And the cherry on top is the animation. Its gorgeous and very distinct. Characters look fantastic and their eyesmy God their eyesI could just swim in those big, beautiful globules forever. There is just something so mesmerizing about looking into Makises eyes, and I don't know why, but I feel that it is one of the reasons you invest yourself in the characters. I don't know where this came from, and I don't have a particular reason to think that, but there has got to be something to those eyes

Aside from the eyes, the backdrops are typically beautiful, and the only thing I disliked about the animation was the severe contrast of light and dark. I don't know if this was meant to help convey emotion or not, but it really didn't seem to. When it was sunny out, the screen was burning bright. When the characters were inside of the lab, it was really dark. There was no middle ground, and I did feel that there was a certain dullness to the colors, that while in no way detracting and more so a distinctive trait of the art style, was still sometimes a little hard to look at.

If you haven't figured it out already, Steins;Gate is an amazing anime. Very rarely does something like this come along that takes you on such an emotional ride, invests you so much in characters that, while fictional, seem like they live and breathe in our world, and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout, wondering (sometimes slack-jawed, sometimes with a tear in your eye, sometimes with a warmness in your chest, sometimes with laughter rising in your throat) what will happen next. While I previously held Puella Magi Madoka Magica as the best anime of 2011, I must kick it off its pedestal and place Steins;Gate where it rightfully belongs, not only as the top anime of 2011, but also one of the top anime of all time. Dont be like me and quit because its a little slow, push through those first few episodes and be rewarded with one of the most emotionally satisfying experiences in anime history.",1401580800,4,10038,4.399784482758621
5683057,5,B00BZC029G,"There are very few words to describe what I just watched as I am very impressed with this show. The story revolves around Rinatrou Okabe and the future gadgets club as they discover the ability to affect time and learn the consequences of doing such actions. The story here is very good and actually very touching that being said it will start very slow but when It starts moving it doesn't stop. The characters really make the show as all of them are people we can relate to especially the leads Okabe, Mayuri and Kurisu all make the show very fun and emotional.

5683059,5,B00BZC029G,"I won't give anything away, even though it is a show you can watch again as soon as your done, so I'll just say this. The idea behind Stein's Gate is very realistic on a physical and spiritual level. Watch it all the way to the end (the very end), and you may just come to peace with things you never were able to before.

Don't pass on watching this. It is one of my favorites, which doesn't happen much with newer anime. I can now say I have a top 4 (I can't choose between a few for 5). In no order, Trigun, Berserk, NGE, and now Steins Gate.

Hope this helps!",1397174400,3,563,3.9734513274336285

The Funimation staff hit this one out of the park. The always present moment when your somehow reminded your watching anime and not animation only occurs when the art demanded the writing take that turn. Staples of romantic and dramatic elements are here as well but again they both work ALL the way through the story.

This is definitely one of the best anime shows I have ever seen. Everything about this show, from the animation to the theme music, is great but I'll list the three best things: Dialogue, Plot and Character Development.
The witty flirtatious banter between Okabe and Makise is priceless and reminded me of Spice and Wolf. The Character Development is so well done that you get deeply attached to all the characters, even the bad ones, and makes you keep hoping that they all have happy endings. The Plot is very intelligent and never lets down the suspense in any episode. You cannot wait to find out what happens next and there are many surprises to keep the viewer engrossed till the end. This plot was so good in fact, that one of the English voice actors commented that the lead writer actually cried when his work ended.
In conclusion, you'll be doing yourself a great disservice if you pass on this show. I recommend that you watch this on DVD or Blu-Ray so that you can pause and read some of the text messages which otherwise change with the scene too quickly to read.",1389052800,,1192,4.447488584474886

The English voice over is done very well, with J. Micheal Tatum doing an excellent job portraying the mad scientist Hououin Kyouma.
The voices for the other characters are also excellent.

As this is only half of the full series, it is essential to buy and watch the other half as well, and I'm considering the whole 25 episodes together here.

5683073,5,B00BZC029G,"Rintaro Okabe considers himself a mad scientist. He spends most of his time inventing useless gadgets and conceiving wild conspiracy theories.

Through their experimentation and tinkering with time, they keep changing their world, though only Okabe is able to remember the previous timeline. But playing around with something like time is bound to have consequences, as Okabe finds out all too well.....

I generally don't have much interest in time travel stories. But if the premise sounds interesting, I'll give it a try. The premise of Steins;Gate sounded vaguely entertaining, but I might not have tried it if it hadn't been streaming on Crunchyroll and had high ratings on AnimeNewsNetwork. The first few episodes were fun, but I wasn't really hooked until around 8 episodes in. That is where the story really starts. And boy, it doesn't let up until the end! The story it very intense and fast paced. It was a rather surprising change, after the laid-back, comedic first few episodes. I went from wanting to see more, to NEEDING to see more. In addition to a great story, this series also has great characters. Okabe is the most interesting, and most developed, since he is the main character, but the others each have their chance to shine.

This is one of the best anime series I've see in a while. Possibly the best Sci-Fi anime I've EVER seen. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys an exciting and well woven story. Anyone who enjoys stories that make them think a little. Stories that have wacky characters that you come to love, science fiction, thrill, or mystery. I'd probably recommend this series to just about everybody really :)",1388102400,4,1770,4.857615894039735

We often think of time travel and wish we could change things we regret, but Steins;Gate shows that it is not so simple. The characters learn that although possessing knowledge others do not, that time is difficult to change, and that fate more so is difficult to overcome.

This was a brilliant show because it shows the consequences of time travel and how all incidents are related and how certain events become unchangeable. This is a show that will confuse you a bit at the beginning, but please keep watching. Episode 12 and you will not be able to stop, I assure you.

Amazon Prime is the only thing I can count on always getting on time as promised. This series is gonna be awesome!",1372118400,,583,4.252252252252252
5683091,5,B00BZC029G,"Steins;Gate is a very compelling story and yes it does start out a little slow but it is this development that makes the climax of the series so enthralling. Funimation did a great job dubbing this show to the point that it is even comparable to the Japanese which is also spectacular. The blu-ray looks wonderful. The dvd's are nothing to scoff at either. As for the special features they were lacking as basically they were commentary and a map, which in the blu-ray version is interactive. The commentary itself is almost as entertaining as the episodes they're superimposed on, in other words they're great. If you are a time travel fanatic then this is a must have. If you like anime in general this show is amazing.",1371254400,15,721,4.640625

8575782,5,B00BZC029G,"This animes dub and voice acting are so well done that youll forget its japanese anime. It helps that the subjuct matter in the story is very much a world wide affair and based on things that happened all over including america. But the Dubs so good that it feels like it was originally written here. Dont get me wrong. It still has quirky characters locations, catchphrases and anime tropes that are very much Japanese. The show itself is super entertaining and interesting. It can seem like a straight up comedy at first glance but will get get serious after some great story twists. The characters are as endearing as they are funny and theres not one that you probably won't like. Sure you noticed i haven't talked about the story because i don't want to spoil anything. Sufice to say its very interesting and takes a unique aproach to time travel and its consequences. Saw it awhile ago but was waiting for the complete series in a one package cuz i had to own this now modern classic.",1413936000,,990,4.5363128491620115
8575783,5,B00BZC029G,"This is a show that everyone should watch. It is absolutely excellent. Character work, story, dialogue, it's all at it's peak in Stein's;Gate. Whether you pick up the individual pieces or buy the combo, you're in for a treat. Funimation's bad subbing was only especially evident with Hacker's name wordplay, which they totally missed the mark. In their defense (which I don't run to often) it is difficult to explain succinctly. It looks great on blu ray. All around, a must-see, even for people who aren't hardcore otaku. It's an amazing adventure that will having you laughing so hard it hurts and biting your nails in suspense. Give it a shot, it's definitely worth it.",1412208000,2,672,4.852173913043479
