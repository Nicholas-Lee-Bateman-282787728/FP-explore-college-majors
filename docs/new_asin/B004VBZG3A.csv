4482244,5,B004VBZG3A,"Had no idea what film was about and as often the case, the brief description of the film was not accurate. Took a chance and really enjoyed it. Quirky theme, funny scenes, was not expecting the plot to proceed as it did. Some sexy bedroom scenes, although this is not the focus of the film. The core question of the film, what if you could determine exactly when you were to meet your soul mate, would you wear a device which provided such information, would you?  Watch the film and see if your answer changes.....",1276387200,4,515,4.421052631578948
4482245,5,B004VBZG3A,"This was a great movie.  I just loved the idea that a device could tell you if you were with your soul mate.  Depending on what the timer says it could change the way people feel about on casual sex, teen romance and cheating. This is a great romantic comedy.

It is good enough to watch over and over.  :-)",1273190400,,307,4.066666666666666
4482246,5,B004VBZG3A,"I'm sure I won't do the movie justice with this little review but I had to add my two cents by saying I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Great acting, solid script, though an indy it didn't feel low budget to me -- I recommend seeing this film!  (Be aware it fully deserves it's R rating for language but if that doesn't distract you from enjoying a good movie then it's definitely worth watching.)

I'll admit I have an affinity for 'What If?' movies like this.  Ones that tell stories which start off with a slightly unrealistic premise in order to make us explore a concept that deserves to be pulled from the back of our collective subconscious so we can examine it's full implications.  Other examples that spring to mind are Sliding Doors, The Truman Show, Twilight of the Golds, and (I would add) Groundhogs Day.

So give your 'willing suspension of disbelief' a little more chain to run around the yard and discover what this great romantic movie has to say.",1273190400,9,957,4.567251461988304
4482247,5,B004VBZG3A,"This is a smart, engaging, witty, funny and provocative film with broad audience appeal by an upcoming new director Jac Schaeffer.

4482248,5,B004VBZG3A,"I gather this film was begun by the basic premise of the timers, which (without giving anything away) tell the owners when they will meet the love of their lives.  The movie takes this idea and really explores many of the ins and outs of the concept (as it has become well accepted and fairly integrated into everyday live) and how it affects different people in regards to love.  I found the writing to be quite splendid and I laughed out loud multiple times - a result of the combination of great writing and excellent delivery.

What a great cast!

I cannot speak much of the cinematography or music of the film as I was too wrapped up in the story to notice!

My only complaint was that I felt the buildup to and the ending to be predictable.  But, I still enjoyed it to the end.  It's nice to see solid films like this emerge in the terribly boring Remake Mania overtaking American cinema these days.",1272758400,11,905,4.383233532934132
4482249,5,B004VBZG3A,"I'm pretty sure that the only reason this film didn't get wide-spread theatrical distribution is because of the (almost) no-name cast, because everything else about it was fantastic.  The combination of great acting, well-drawn and complex characters, and high-concept plot resulted in an adorable, charming and engaging movie.  Perfect for a night in.  Kudos to the director.  I hope he does more like it...  :)",1272326400,14,412,5.276923076923077
4482250,5,B004VBZG3A,"I had the good luck to see this movie at the Cleveland International Film Festival recently, and I am so pleased that I did -- it was funny, well-written, brilliantly acted (I swear Emma Caulfield is one of the greatest ""face"" actors working today, she can put so much across with just one look!) and delightful. I hope it gets a broader release in theatres, because compared to the other movies out there right now, it's vastly superior.

The premise is simple -- what if a clock could count down to the moment you meet your soul mate? But it isn't science fiction-y, and even though you feel for what the main character is going through (her timer is one of a handful that doesn't work correctly, and she keeps ending up with the wrong guys again and again), it isn't a ""chick flick"" either. It's sensitive, slightly dark at times (her sister works in a retirement community -- there are some great one-liners), but overall, a wonderful movie.",1272067200,12,945,4.591715976331361

4482257,5,B004VBZG3A,"In Gotham City, The Joker and his accomplices rob a mob-owned bank. The accomplices kill each other off one by one in a sequence masterminded by the Joker, who escapes alone with all the money.

Batman and Lt. Jim Gordon decide to include the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, in their plan to eradicate the mob. Although Dent is dating Rachel Dawes, Bruce Wayne is impressed with his idealism and offers to throw him a fundraiser. Mob bosses Sal Maroni, Gambol, and The Chechen hold a videoconference with Lau, a Chinese accountant who has hidden their funds and fled to Hong Kong. The Joker interrupts the meeting, warning that Batman is unhindered by jurisdiction. He offers to kill Batman for half their money, but the mob bosses refuse, and Gambol puts a bounty on him. The Joker kills Gambol and takes control of his men. Batman captures Lau and delivers him back to Gotham to testify against the mob.

The Joker announces that people will die each day unless Batman reveals his identity. He then kills Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb and the judge presiding over the mob trials. He also targets Dent at the fundraiser, but Bruce hides Dent. Gordon foils the Joker's assassination attempt on Mayor Garcia, apparently sacrificing himself in the process. Bruce plans to reveal his identity, but Dent instead names himself as Batman to protect the truth. Dent is taken into protective custody and pursued by the Joker across the city; Batman rushes to Dent's aid. Gordon, who faked his death, helps apprehend the Joker and is promoted to Commissioner.

That night, Dent and Rachel disappear. Batman interrogates the Joker and discovers that Dent and Rachel are held in two separate buildings filled with explosives. The Joker reveals their locations, and Batman goes to Rachel's, only to realize that the Joker has tricked him into finding Dent moments before both buildings explode, killing Rachel and scarring half of Dent's face. The Joker detonates a bomb in the police station and escapes with Lau.

Coleman Reese, an accountant at Wayne Enterprises, deduces Batman's true identity and plans to reveal it. The Joker kills Lau and The Chechen, then threatens to bomb a hospital unless Reese is killed. Gordon and Bruce protect Reese, who changes his mind. The Joker visits Dent in the hospital and convinces him to seek revenge. The Joker then blows up the hospital and escapes with hostages.

Dent starts to go after people responsible for Rachel's death, deciding their fates by flipping a coin. He kills Maroni and a cop who had helped kidnap Rachel. It is revealed that the Joker rigged two ferries with explosives to escalate chaos; one ferry is full of citizens, the other full of prison inmates and guards. He then gives the passengers of each ferry the choice to blow the other up before midnight  otherwise, both ferries will explode. The passengers ultimately refuse, however.

Batman asks a reluctant Lucius Fox to use a city-wide tracking prototype device to find the Joker; Fox agrees, but says he will resign immediately afterward. The Joker dresses up hostages as his men, luring Gordon's SWAT team to strike them. Batman fights off the SWAT team and the Joker's men, then rescues the hostages. Batman apprehends the Joker, but the Joker gloats that he has won, as Gotham will lose hope once Dent's rampage becomes public. The SWAT team arrives to take the Joker into custody.

Dent lures Gordon to the building where Rachel died and holds Gordon's family hostage. Batman confronts Dent, who judges the fates of himself, Batman, and Gordon's son with three coin flips. He shoots Batman, spares himself, then flips again to determine the boy's fate. Batman, who is wearing body armor, tackles Dent off the building, killing him and saving the boy.[12] Batman then convinces Gordon to frame him for the murders so that Dent will remain a symbol of hope for the city. Gordon destroys the Bat-Signal and launches a manhunt for the Batman. Alfred Pennyworth burns a letter written by Rachel to Bruce announcing her engagement to Dent, and Fox watches the signal tracker self-destruct.",1429315200,,4100,4.9404934687953554
4482258,4,B004VBZG3A,"A wonderful movie about our obsession with ""true love,"" the reality of being unsure about our future and how everyone else seems to have it easier.  I'd give it five stars, but there is one aspect of the ending that I found a bit disappointing.  I don't want to write a spoiler, and all in all it's an excellent ""sleeper"" of a movie.",1412121600,,333,4.26984126984127
4482259,4,B004VBZG3A,"This movie is unique in its storytelling in that it most certainly isn't your typical Hollywood movie and has more bounce to it than an average Indie.

But it  tackles a common social topic: Where is our soulmate and just how happy will we be with our preordained match?

The concept that if we can insert a chip into ourselves that will not only count down the days until we meet our true intended, but that it will beep when we are in their presence seems brilliant. Everyone wants a guarantee of true love, but what do we miss in the process?

I thought it was very well done how the characters ultimately expressed their stress. Knowing that you are decades away from meeting your intended creates depression, meeting your intended too young is awkward and takes away the mystery of getting to know someone on the fly (it also generates issues between the families.) and then there it the time that is flat-lined with no connection. Do you take the risk of getting to know somebody? What levels are you willing to chance for a relationship if it isn't yours to keep? And what/who do we miss when we don't take chances?

Ultimately a guarantee not only doesn't solve anything, it creates even more distractions and messes. I.e. there is no cure for life or the lessons that need to be learned. This was a concise, thought-provoking film, I enjoyed it and I really felt that Emma Caulfield and Michelle Borth were in perfect stride for this storyline. I really felt for them and thet kept me thinking about this movie for a long time.",1407110400,,1536,4.550724637681159

4482261,4,B004VBZG3A,"I would not say  this is a romance, finding romance is kind of the theme but it is more about two sisters, and how humans relate to technology.

From there some interesting things happen, but the ending is kind of unsatisfying in my opinion. Maybe that is the point.  Human life is untidy.",1393372800,,404,4.373333333333333
4482262,5,B004VBZG3A,"This is a wonderfully clever movie with GREAT music.  It caught my eye because of Emma Caulfield, who I love from BtVS.  She is witty and hilarious in this movie as well.  I won't recap the plot, since you can look on IMDB or any other website for that information.  It is a movie I can watch over and over again.  The plot is smart and the surrealistic premise very appropriate for our society.  The chemistry between the actors is great and you really care about what happens.  It could have been a cheesy-hokey-forgettable rom-com, but the writing and acting are superb.  Do yourself a favor and check it out.

4482263,2,B004VBZG3A,"The premise of the movie didn't make sense to begin with. The movie never adequately explains how the timer technology is possible. But if you can ignore that, the movie starts out as an ok chick flick. The characters start to get developed and you feel like the movie is going somewhere. And then it just ends. It feels like it ends 20 minutes before it is supposed to before anything is resolved or before you find out what happens to the characters. When the credits started to roll, I thought, ""That's it? Uh, where is the rest?"" Very unsatisfying ending.",1389312000,2,559,4.544554455445544
4482264,1,B004VBZG3A,"Nothing in this supposed comedy made me laugh.  The heroine and many others are obsessive about finding the perfect person to spend their lives with.  Some do, some don't.  Who cares?",1378252800,,183,4.838709677419355
4482265,5,B004VBZG3A,"My wife and I took a chance on ""Timer"" a few weeks back when we sat down to watch our every Friday evening quirky movie. At first I was a bit skeptical of a movie where the basic premise is that through the implantation of a timer one can discover just how long it will be (down to the moment) before one finds one's soulmate, and that one's timer will buzz (as will that of one's soulmate) when that moment arrives. It had all the outward appearances of a one-joke movie that becomes tedious after the first five minutes.

Nothing could have been further from the truth. ""Timer"" is funny, endearing, and surprisingly deep movie that is well worth watching. It brings up the age-old but elemental question of whether, if we could know with certainty something so important as to when we would meet our soulmate and when we did, we knew who that soulmate was, would we be better off? Much of the movie deals with the way the different characters deal with this very issue. (The movie also raises the issue, not specifically addressed in the movie itself, of whether human beings have the freedom to falsify what seems to be predestined by, in this case, refusing to have anything to do with the person the timers indicate is one's soulmate.)

For a movie of this genre, the characters are surprisingly well developed. Although the premise has an element of science fiction in it, the characters are entirely believable and exhibit the total gamut of human emotion.",1375228800,2,1463,4.623076923076923
4482266,5,B004VBZG3A,"Those are some of the questions asked by this definitely very original, unusual and quite clever little film, which combines successfully a typical romantic comedy with a solid dosage of Sci-Fi. Below, some more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

A futuristic corporation produces a matchmaking device. For a monthly fee, the company can equip anyone with a TiMER that counts down until the moment when the customer meets his/her soul mate. The night before meeting a soul mate, the TiMER reaches zero and will beep when the soul mates meet the following day. After more than fifteen years of operational existence, the TiMER is considered 98% efficient... This is basically the introduction which takes the first three minutes of the film - and then, we meet Oona, a smart and sexy orthodontist played magistrally by Emma Caulfield and her smart and even more sexy half-sister Stephanie (""Steph""), played by Michelle Borth.

I will say no more about the scenario, but it is a pretty strong thing, mixing humor, drama, emotionally strong scenes and quite a lot of suprisingly tough questions...

Actors did a VERY good job in this film! I will never forget Emma Caulfield's performance as Anya in ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and as she plays little, I missed her a lot since those series ended. Watching her in this film was a pleasure. I never saw Michelle Borth in anything before ""TiMER"", but she was GREAT and really hot in this film.

Both male characters who appear in the film were well conceived and well interpeted - exuberant young Mikey, played by John Patrick Amedori (unknown to me before this film) and more mature and rather serious, even grave Dan played by Desmond Harrington (instantly recognizable to all ""Dexter"" fans).

This film is not a great masterpiece, but it is a very original, intelligent, bitter sweet and ultimately surprisingly serious romantic comedy, with likeable characters and - surprise, surprise - NO villains. It was for me a very, very pleasant surprise. Recommended for all amateurs of romantic comedies, Sci-Fi and good films in general. Enjoy!",1369785600,,2099,5.002865329512894
4482267,4,B004VBZG3A,"Really enjoyed this movie and the concept and themes it explored. Great little rom-com. Not a ground-shaker, but fun, and something a little bit different than your standard glossy Hollywood mainstream.",1364860800,,202,5.548387096774194
4482268,4,B004VBZG3A,"The setup for this movie is that technology has been discovered by which a little device implanted into your wrist will tell you how many days, hours and minutes remain until you meet your soul-mate, your life partner. Then, when two people who are so matched actually meet, both of their devices chime or ring and flash, indicating that this is the one.

Other than that, the world of this movie is our world without any alteration. The shops where they implant the devices look very much like mobile phone stores. It's a clever set-up which provokes all kinds of possibilities. And this movie does a good job of exploring some of the implications of living in a world where the delicious uncertainty that surrounds every new relationship is removed and where technology determines our most important and most personal decision - the choice of a mate.

So we meet Oona who is pushing 30 but whose timer obstinately refuses to register anything -- meaning that her Mr Right has yet to buy an implant. Oona drags each man she meets to the Timer store to see if he is THE ONE - but none of them is. And then she falls in lust, and maybe more, with a younger kid who mans a checkout counter in a supermarket by day and plays drums in a band by night.

We also meet Oona's half-sister and kid brother who is implanted on his 14th birthday and meets his intended three days later.

4482273,4,B004VBZG3A,"This cleverly (if flawed) plotted indy comedy has a lot going for it. Good writing. Good cast and only a touch of b.s.

Here's the scoop. Most everyone in the near future is fitted with a ""Timer"" which will tell the wearer when they've met their true love. It appears we give off some chemical that can me matched with another person. When two compatible people start their ""countdown"" they know they will meet the day after they countdown to zero. Our heroine, Oona, and her step-sister Steph, like most everyone else, put all their faith in the ""Timer."" But things start to happen that begin to raise doubts in their minds.

This is a clever, light comedy. Emma Caufield does a sweet job as Oona. Michelle Borth, as her step-sister Steph, is about as gorgeous a woman as I've ever seen, and she's a real pistol. They make a good, if opposite, pair. The approach to the writing is to check out all the things that can happen to people who rely on a device like this. What if you're approaching middle age and still haven't started your countdown? Will you be worried that you'll grow old alone? What if you're a young kid and you start your countdown right away? Will you miss out on all the exploration people now take for granted? There are a lot of 'what ifs' and they explore a fair number of them.

This has production values good enough to suit the content. It's peppered with some good, indy artist tunes and runs as smooth as silk. And when you think the point has been made at the end, they throw in a final scene which says 'maybe not.'

I like this film. No Academy Awards here but it was well worth the time I spent to view it.",1335484800,,1640,4.349673202614379
4482274,4,B004VBZG3A,"Quick, what movie features a timer on your wrist that counts down to the most important moment of your life? Before scruffy Justin Timberlake and adorable Amanda Seyfried got into an awkward relationship in a dystopian world where time is money in 2011's In Time, scruffy John Patrick Amedori and adorable Emma Caufield were in an awkward relationship in a dystopian world where love is money in 2009's TiMER.

Caufield plays pert orthodontist Oona, wracked by certainty; she has a TiMER but the countdown hasn't started on hers, which means her soul mate has yet to get a device implanted on his (or her!) wrist. So Oona cycles through a series of very short relationships with boyfriends, cajoling them into getting a TiMER only to dump them when it becomes clear that they're not meant to be.

The TiMER organization has all the friendly efficiency of a Scientology center, complete with politely persistent counselors.  TiMERs work - always - but they require a certain level of commitment and patience.  Oona and her blended family, including loose stepsister Steph (Michelle Borth) and her uptight mother Marion (JoBeth Williams), are obsessed with the TiMER's results, which only heightens their collective anxiety for themselves and each  other.  Marion divorced her husband over the fact that the TiMER indicated they weren't meant to be together; Steph sleeps with whomever she pleases because her TiMER has yet to countdown.

At the crux of TiMER's plot is a definition of happiness.  The film takes at face value that the quest for a soul mate is always a worthy goal.  The question is if happiness can be found before that moment.  Are we better offer discovering our soul mate as soon as we are capable of romantic love, like Oona's younger brother Jesse (Hayden McFarland)?  Or is ignorance bliss?

This question tortures Oona until she finally snaps and begins a torrid romance with checkout clerk Mikey Evers (John Patrick Amedori), several years her younger. Mikey, a drummer in a band called Truckbeef, wears a TiMER but confesses little interest in its results.  He's only too happy with a catch like Oona whom he correctly claims is ""way out of his league.""  And for a little while, Oona and Mikey are happy.  Until the TiMERs begin beeping...

TiMER's one flaw is its failure to lay out early in the film how the devices work. It wasn't clear to me that TiMERs only start counting down when the soul mate gets one (it takes two to TiMER), and then once the future lovers are about to meet the TiMERs begin counting down to their encounter.  A faux infomercial detailing exactly how the TiMERs work would have helped me focus less on the things and more on the people.

The ending is an unflinching look at the nature of relationships: The TiMERs are simple; it's people who make things complicated. It speaks volumes about the love between sisters, mothers, daughters, friends, and lovers.",1329523200,,2911,4.870182555780933

4482283,4,B004VBZG3A,"If you could know -- with absolute certainty -- who your soul mate is, would you want to know?  Sounds like a no-brainer, but this movie explores the downside of such certainty.

This story takes place in the near future where people can plant a Timer device on the wrists which will go off when they make eye contact with their soul mate.  The catch?  Their soul mate must also be wearing a Timer for it to go off.

Stepsisters Oona and Steph both have Timers implanted.  Oona insists every man she date get a Timer implanted, and when his Timer doesn't go off, she breaks it off believing to do otherwise would be a waste of her time.  Steph, in the meantime, engages in meaningless one night stands until the day her Timer goes off.

Both women try to keep their love life organized -- Oona through celibacy and Steph through promiscuity -- but complications arise.  Oona feels very lonely waiting, so she reconsiders the casual dating style of Steph.  Steph meets a man with potential, however, he refuses to get a Timer implanted, so she wonders if she should risk giving her heart to him.

This story is original and gets you asking questions like...what if, like Oona, you knew for sure someone wasn't your soulmate, would you take a chance on them anyway?  Or what if, like Steph, you could never know, would you still take a chance?  Or what if you're already married, would you risk finding out if you married your soulmate?

4482285,5,B004VBZG3A,"I just saw this film on Netflix and I just loved it! So much so that I'm now buying it! I mean seriously, I just finished watching it like 30 seconds ago and I had to see if it was for sale here on amazon! Romantic comedy's follow a certain formula but this one does not, it creates it's own and it goes down paths, some you guess but most you don't. The acting was brilliant, the writing was brilliant and Emma Caufield is utterly fantastic! I love when I find films like this that I fall in love with!",1310256000,,503,4.04
4482286,4,B004VBZG3A,"What if fun gets taken out of life? What if that sense of mystery is wrested away? TiMER on the surface is a quirky romantic comedy, but there's a bit of bleakness lurking about underneath, I think. Determinism warring with free will, fate versus serendipity, and you don't know towards which direction this film tilts 'til the closing credits are just about to drop on your butt.

Emma Caulfield, I harbor a mad crush on her ever since she was the outspoken and ultimately fragile vengeance demon, Anya. Ever since BUFFY she's demonstrated a knack for timing and comedy and a brittle vulnerability, and all that's here, too. She anchors this film.

In this film's reality, the path to true love can be mapped out. Fifteen years ago, the Timer was invented, a revolutionary biotech device which, when implanted into your wrist, counts down to when your soul mate comes into your life. The caveat is that your soul mate must also have an imbedded timer. Such isn't the case for the love of Oona O'Leary's life, and so her own wrist device reads frustratingly blank.

Oona (Caulfield), like most orthodontists, is one of life's go-getters. What she's been doing is dating all manner of timer-less blokes and, whenever compatibility surfaces, she coaxes them into having a timer installed. But all for naught. None of 'em so far have proven to be her elusive soul mate. It's getting to her. In a surprising departure, the logical Oona strikes up an impulsive romance with the local supermarket clerk, Mikey, who is much younger than her. Except that Mikey (John Patrick Amedori) has a timer. Which is counting down to four more months to his true love. Oona opts to throw caution to the winds, to thumb her nose at fate. Except maybe fate isn't as fickle as widely rumored.

As much as I liked TiMER, I'm a bit torn. On one hand, I respect writer/director Jac Schaeffer's opting for the road less traveled ending. On the other hand, I wanted to have my cake and eat it, too. Schaeffer doesn't neglect exploring the ramifications of destined love. There's a teen here whose timer instantly reveals that his own true love is only days away from meeting him, and, understandably, he's all sorts of unprepared for this. And then there's Oona's carefree younger step-sister Steph (a marvelous Michelle Borth) whose straits are even more dire than her own. Steph won't meet her intended other until she's friggin' 43 years old. The fallout to this is that Steph sleeps around, and the subtext is that her carefree demeanor is laced with palpable desperation. Much as I was into Emma Caulfield's performance, the one whom I really felt for was Michelle Borth's character. When Steph reluctantly falls for a charming visitor in her workplace, you cross your fingers for her and you rage against determinism. For most of the story, Schaeffer seems to be advocating one message but then she pulls a switcheroo there at the end, and from that my conflict rises. Things do conclude with a decided glimmer of hope. And if you check out the DVD's deleted scenes, you may see an encouraging resolution to Steph's plight. TiMER is recommended for the cast's strong acting, for the  humor and the angst, and for the thought-provoking premise. I wish Emma Caulfield would do more films. I wish Michelle Borth's THE FORGOTTEN would be made available for DVD already.

The DVD's special features: Audio Commentary by writer/producer/director Jac Schaeffer; ""The Making Of TIMER"" (00:08:47 minutes long); ""Inside the TIMER Store"" - how Schaeffer patterned her friendly Timer shop after those colorful cell phone service centers (00:01:35 minutes); 5 Deleted Scenes; pretty good Bloopers (00:03:17); and two trailers.",1310169600,,3692,4.908653846153846

Also, is TiMER promoting the fact that there's only one?  I think the message behind this film got mixed up.

Lastly, aside from the main actress and her sister and her mother, none of the actors were compelling.

And yeah, just a lot of ""explanations"", not a lot of acting.

And since when does love = sex?

The dialogue felt flat too when mediocre actors were reciting it (ie: the main guy in the movie. agh. you WANT to like him b/c he's a cool rocker dude drummer who's sensitive.. but really, let's not kid ourselves.  he was awful.)",1304035200,,616,4.398230088495575
4482292,5,B004VBZG3A,"I think the key to enjoying Timer is fully accepting its premise - that, in fact there is one and only one soul mate for each person and that the timer can tell you exactly when you are going to meet.  If you can't accept the premise, you may enjoy the comedic elements, but may not appreciate the thought provoking elements.

If you do accept the premise, it raises a number of questions - should one even get a timer?  How important is it to find a soul mate versus trusting your own instincts?  What if you don't meet your soul mate until your are 65?  How would you treat your relationships until that time?  Would you pursue anything long term?  If not are you just shallow?  What if your timer is blank?  What if you believe you are really in love but your timer says otherwise?  What if you meet your soul mate when your are only 12?  How do you appreciate a soul mate when you haven't lived through other relationships? In the end, do you trust what you feel in the moment or what you know to be ""true"" based on the timer?

This was a chick flick, which for a change of pace even men enjoy, but it centered around an absurd premise.  It started off very slow and tried to build towards something, but got lost.  I did not like the ending, too much info was given so you could not make it end the way ""many/most"" of us believing in true love would have liked.  I wish it would have ended with true-love winning out over science.  The parts assigned to the actors were somewhere between cold and nasty.  Over all the video was interesting but I am glad I rented, I even disliked Michelle Borth hair style when she covered her right eye, it looked unkempt.",1297987200,2,748,4.195804195804196

It may have just been me but the movie seems to get better after a little bit of a slow start.  Nothing exciting but still worth watching when you have to pick a chick flick.

4482296,5,B004VBZG3A,"Okay, so there are VERY few wonderful scifi romances: scifi writers usually know nothing about women or romance, and romantic comedy writers dread alienating their mostly female audience with scifi geekyness and lack of real-life personalities. So, what went right here? Well, if certain online retailers and movie rental outfits can often pick out your favorite movies before you see them, who's to say the same computers that beat us all the time at chess won't also be able to pick the date when we'll first make eye contact with our perfect mates? That idea's plausibility becomes the theme of the movie, and whether the characters sitting on the fence are wise or foolish to take that leap of faith with so much at stake. Is it better to believe in your own judgment and inspiration, or put faith in a consistently accurate technology that takes all the mystery out of the greatest mystery there is, romantic love?

What really makes the film work is the thoughtfulness of the script and the convincingly real characters. I can't fault a line anywhere in the script or a performance by any of the mostly unknown (to the big screen, anyway) actors. The writer/director truly and tastefully thought through how this dilemma would affect people, their existing relationships, their doubts and belief in the future, and especially how knowing when they should meet their mate would affect their relationships in the present. Some become more promiscuous while they bide their time until D-day, others without a D-day are impatient to get all their other romantic prospects to buy into the system and get themselves a timer, ""just to be sure"" they're getting involved with ""the one."" All of the characters in the film are sympathetic, thoughtful, and conflicted. What would happen to teenagers and their families who aren't just swept away by infatuation, but have statistical evidence on their side and egging them on? Amedori has the biggest challenge here, trying to convince us that someone barely out of adolescence can somehow soulfully win over a knockout thirty-something orthodontist like Caufield, yet the two of them really pull off the connection in a very believable delayed chemistry. Best of all, the film is warm, human, and funny without being farcical. Scifi almost never accomplishes this, and neither does it usually have women acting, thinking, and feeling like women you'd recognize in real-life.

Also, the supposition that a few chemical compounds determines all of behavior would fail high school bio. Unless, you believe that clover leaves and Gods intervening in every moment of everyone's lives.

Third, there really was no story other than what we know already and that is ""life is really complex and matching two of them even more so.""

4482301,5,B004VBZG3A,"This movie hooked me from the start.  Let's say technology allowed for a devise that could be inserted into your wrist that counted down to the day you would find your true love.  Would you get one?  Our heroine, Uma, did but hers never set a date while those all around her blinked with a true love countdown.  Uma's step-sister also had a Timer with no love on the horizon.  The two of them were very close but had very different views on how to handle their Timer issues.  Uma hunted down every available man to find her true love and even talked  boyfriends into getting the Timer to find out of they were meant to be while her step-sister fooled around, attempting to get as much out of live since her Timer told her she wouldn't find her true love until she was 42.

This movie was fascinating in it's questioning of fate and true love in modern times.  There were so many paths the characters lives could have taken and I'm not sure that technology can predict better then your own heart.  The match that Uma finally makes through the ""Timer"" could have as easily been made when her sister set her up with him much earlier except at that point, he did not have a ""Timer.""  Uma would never had the technological guarantee if she had met him through her sister so would they still have ended up together?  This movie makes you think about all the little things that can affect an outcome.

Both sisters found real relationships but society's complete faith in the Timer interfered with what might have been had all the people involved listened to their hearts instead of technology.  All of the characters were as intriguing as the script and I highly recommend this chick flick.  It won a bunch of film festival awards (albeit the only one I recognized was Tribeca) so I'm not sure why I never heard of this film before but I am very glad I discovered it and you will be too.",1291075200,2,1881,4.41159420289855
4482302,5,B004VBZG3A,"This film is a comedy but not a romantic comedy.  It is something rarer - it is a film that asks questions about finding love.  It uses a quasi-science fiction plot device to create a number of scenarios that pose real questions about romantic love: What would happen if we could have a device that could accurately tell us when we would meet our soulmate- and even beep to alert us when it happened? Provided, of course, that said soulmate has also acquired the device and the service.  Do we simply wait for love? Do we cynically engage in relationships or hookups to pass the time? Or is it cynical at all- Is it not possible to love truly love the 'wrong' person? But if we know that this is the wrong person isn't it wrong to pursue the relationship? Or not?  This movie is about the responsibility that each of us has for love.

What if it happens at the wrong time? This question is posed by the story of Oona's much younger half-brother- far from being like an arranged marriage what happens is the exact opposite: As Soledad's mother notes the soulmate located by the Timer is not the one she would have chosen for her daughter and that she would have preferred that things had happened differently and not so quickly (these two soulmates have 'found' each other at the age of fourteen) and yet- if they are soulmates the fact that the two young kids are from opposites sides of the track should not matter- except that it may confront the two people with a different set of challenges. One of the most charming moments occurs in one of the last scenes of the film- when Jesse addresses Soledad in halting, very definitely newly learned Spanish, to tell her that he hopes that she will permit him to try to make her happy. And you realize that Jesse has not been being shackled and limited by the discovery of his soulmate- Instead  that knowledge has freed Jesse to grow, to become more than he otherwise would have been. Jesse has taken responsibility for his love- and in that moment we catch just a glimpse of the very fine man that he is going to be.",1290816000,,2064,4.432717678100264
4482303,5,B004VBZG3A,"This movie is a real winner. It has a great story based on a wonderfully original plot device -- the existence of a Timer device, stamped into your wrist, that tells you precisely what day you will meet your soulmate, and actually rings when you meet him or her. But it can only tell you if your soulmate is also wearing a Timer -- which are sold in a stores in every mall, with monthly plans like for cellphones.

The timer of Oona, a 30-year-old orthodontist, doesn't ever start counting down, so she's getting nervous. Very nervous. Is it because she will never find ""the one"", or because he hasn't bought a Timer yet?

This is a romantic comedy, I suppose, but the comedy aspect is not the film's main strength. There is no slapstick, nothing raucous going on here. Rather, the film brings a science fiction sensibility into a very non-science-fiction context, using a non-existent technological breakthrough (a timer based on reading levels of ""oxytocin, the hormone of love"") to examine the nature human relationships. Does fate exist? Is there really a ""one"" out there for everybody? Or are free will and our own choices the important thing?

I liked the film's originality. I liked that even 10 minutes before the end of the movie, I didn't know exactly how it was going to end -- although I did suspect it wouldn't be tragic.

The music, by Andrew Kaiser, is also worth mentioning. Just what you would expect, and what the film needed, but brilliantly done. Lots of sounds like kitchen timers ticking, very rhythmic, but with an irrepressibly optimistic edge. Often reminiscent in mood and tone of the kind of music Annie Little makes.

It is a smart movie, well acted, with very likable characters. It doesn't tell you what the answers are, but it raises good questions. Satisfying all around and highly recommended!",1290211200,3,1826,4.765822784810126

The interplay with Oona's younger half-brother and his ""soulmate"" is downright reminiscent of an arranged marriage.  It also makes a commentary that cuts both ways across science and religion:  because a ""scientific"" timer tells you when you meet your ""one true soulmate,"" do we accept this?  Can a countdown REALLY tell you this?  The question cuts back the other way where you watch as people share this almost devotional faith to the TiMER units themselves;  ""How can you find love without a TiMER?""  Why would you have faith in such an object?

Further, it allows us to ask questions about certain kinds of products and their consequences on society;  if you watch how the people in the world of the movie act, talk, and react with all things ""TiMER,"" it gives you insight into how far-reaching an simple idea can possibly blossom.

Not quite as comedic as I was expecting, but this movie is worth its weight in the story itself (philosophy aside.)  It's a versatile movie, can be taken either deeply or routinely, and has excellent performances throughout.",1287100800,23,1212,4.834951456310679
4482305,4,B004VBZG3A,"It is extremely hard to find thought provoking, fun, and character based romantic comedies. In this movie we actually have one. It is sad as an audience we are left with terrible choices in the theaters in this genre (almost all of them carbon copies of each other!) while something with a refreshing concept and something new goes direct to video. Why? Oh well.

I won't go into the plot as you can read that in the product description. This movie has relatable characters that you like (what a concept hollywood) and their actions are not out of character either. So often we are left with comedies that step so far out of the relm of reality that they become farces. Timer, although has a bit of a sci-fi bent to the plot, stays grounded.

I like that it has something to say too. What would you do if you could have your fate told to you? If you didn't really have to look for love? It's an interesting idea. I think it explores that idea well without it overpowering the characters too. Having some people refuse to get a Timer, or having a sister with a date set decades from the present and how emotionally she handles that. All these themes are thought provoking, something I rarely get from Romantic comedies and it's refreshing. The actors and actresses are all very good in the film too!

It also isn't a romantic-comedy -- though it has elements of romance and comedy. Just forget the categories. Natural scripting, great acting and fine directing by Jac Schaeffer make this a film worth seeing and talking about. And the events it portrays could never happen, right?

Or has he just not gotten a timer yet.  There is a lot of excellent directing, great casting, and all the performers do a fine job.

 Beyond the basic plot, however, this film makes me wonder (and a lot of family debate after the movie was over) about whether or not there is a One And Only...  And how much does a person miss by being bound to waiting all the time.  Living, so to speak, in the future, rather than in the present.

 Some characters in this film chose to live with those they knew they loved, no matter what the timer said.  Some choose to obey the timers.  I found the later people sad and disappointing.

 But the movie is certainly worthwhile, just to see the good acting, and to generate some interesting discussion.",1280361600,,1129,4.365384615384615
4482312,5,B004VBZG3A,"Set in a world where technology has created a device that once implanted in your arm will count down to the day that you meet your perfect spouse, TiMER is a joy ride well worth watching. The story lives on the performances of two sisters: one who has a timer that has never started (which indicates that her perfect partner has not yet gotten a timer of their own implanted,) and the other who has a timer that shows she won't meet her perfect match for 14 years. The interplay of these two actresses is so convincing and struck such a realistic tone that I fell in love with this film for just them. The ultimate question of the film is whether or not there is a perfect match or if love is what we make of it. In both comedy and in deeper questions I found the film to be an excellent use of my time.

For Netflix friends, this movie is currently available to watch on demand. If you have Netflix, or if you have a few bucks to spend on a romantic comedy movie with a deeper side, catch this one. You won't be disappointed.",1280102400,,1026,4.181818181818182
4482313,5,B004VBZG3A,"The neo-modern quasi sci-fi film Timer, is the first film I've been authentically excited about in a long time.

The plot alone is so different, so ground breaking it's a breath of clean, fresh air. What if science could find your soul-mate, love no longer a question of pure feeling and random choices?

The brilliant Emma Caulfield is Oona, an almost model citizen of the Time Revolution, a beautiful young woman who feels her internal(or scientific) clock ticking and brings every potential husband into the 'timer-toting revolution'. Unfortunately her timer is still blank, meaning her soul-mate has yet to convert to the technology leaving her a little lost without much hope.

However when Oona meets Mikey(John Patrick Amedori) his youth and vibrant personality teach her to live life in a purer way,  without relying on a few small numbers.

Just when Oona really begins to let go and connect with Mikey, her timer provides an impending date that she's put all too much thought into.

Timer is an enjoyable, extensive life experience more important than the almost magical experience science can provide. Do we sometimes settle for a feeling that isn't necessarily love, or are soul-mates just a figure of speech?

There are a few scenes that may fall short, but overall Timer is a fantastic change in the tired genre of modern romance-related Indie flicks. You're left with numerous internal dilemmas and questions not only about the film, but about yourself.

You may not love it to death, but you will remember it.",1279584000,,1525,4.9763779527559056
4482314,5,B004VBZG3A,"This was a perfect chick flick for intelligent people... or at least I think so.  Which I guess means I think I am intelligent... well, you know what I am saying...

I really liked it.",1279324800,,184,4.228571428571429
4482315,4,B004VBZG3A,"TiMER has a premise that I've often fanasized about: what if a machine could tell you when you've met your soul mate? Seeing the ramifications of the Timer of the characters' lives made me rethink my fantasy, as watching Oona's dependance on the Timer's readings [or lack of] cause her more than a dose of heartache. I say I was ""dissapointed"" in my title, not by the film, but by Oona's final decision. However, I still really liked the movie becasue I think Oona acted in character: not all of us can let our hearts run free.

The acting in the movie was wonderful, and even though there is not much in terms of characters development, Oona does try to change, which counts in my book. I also found Mikey's character enchanting (I watched this with my Mom and we both were taken!) This is much better and far less predictable than most romantic comedies (and I've been on a spree lately) and I will probably seek out more films starring the actors in TiMER.",1278633600,,959,4.48
4482316,4,B004VBZG3A,"What I liked most about the film was the story and just how well the director managed to get me involved. The concept of timer is like that of a religion. There are many other fears of society thrown into the film which makes for an interesting complex plot.

Timer is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. The first scene made me wonder who the protagonist really was. There are many scenes that will make you laugh out loud and the soundtrack is also very interesting. At some time in the film a song played that I quoted as the best sound ever. I wish i could get a list of the soundtrack to explore. Emma Caulfield is beautiful but her character is also slightly annoying sometimes.

I recommend this to fans of ""Cashback"" , ""Shopgirl"" and ""Stranger than fiction""

Highly recommended.",1278201600,,800,4.391891891891892

4482318,4,B004VBZG3A,"Timer is a relatively pretty unknown film with a premise that reads a little like a sci-fi. Ultimately, the film deals with the idea of soul mates and waiting to find ""the one"". While most hated the ending, I liked it because it was honest. Life, especially love, is unpredictable and often people get hurt. The ending showed that people will often choose the safer, more predictable path, than follow their heart and take a leap. The acting was fantastic, as was the music. So overall a sweet, funny, sexy, and intriguing film that fans of 500 Days of Summer will love. By the way- if you have a Netflix account you can watch it online.",1277942400,,637,4.5
4482319,4,B004VBZG3A,"This popped up as a recommended watch on a movie rental website I subscribe to and I thought I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did because ""Timer"", thanks to some compelling lead performances and an interesting premise, is an engaging watch.

Orthodontist Oona (Emma Caulfield) has a timer implanted on her wrist. These timers once activated will count down to the time one will meet one's soulmate, but there's a catch - the other person will have to have a timer implanted as well. That's Oona's problem - she has a timer, but it hasn't started it's countdown because her supposed soul mate, wherever he might be, has not had a timer of his own implanted yet. So, time passes and Oona gets increasingly desperate, driven to drag ""timer-less"" men she's briefly dated to be implanted, only to discover none of them are her ""one"".

As Oona approaches the big 3-0, she gets desperate and crabby, especially so when her 9th grader brother gets a timer implanted (I guess 14 is the legal age for implanting) and it starts a countdown almost immediately! Then Oona meets a younger man, a check-out clerk at the local grocery story and sparks fly between them. He has a timer that indicates he is 4 months away from meeting his soul mate, so will Oona break her own rules and date him?

The story despite some holes in the plot, flows well, and there is also a sub-plot involving Oona's promiscuous stepsister, who is averse to dating timer-less men. There are also quite a few twists to keep this movie interesting. On the whole, this is a refreshing entry into a relatively small sub-genre in movies, and worth watching.",1277424000,,1612,4.609756097560975
4482320,5,B004VBZG3A,"I found this film because I'm a Whedonite, and I wondered what Emma Caufield was up to.  I read that it had done very well at festivals, and wow...it *is* all that!  For fellow Whedonites, there are two great connections in the very beginning.  (Always looking for Whedon connections...  :)

I agree with another reviewer who called this the gold standard for romantic comedies: it was unpredictable -- which almost never happens in romantic comedies; the plot is interesting, and easily could have gone the cheesy route, but didn't; the soundtrack grabbed me several times...  I'm not a very good reviewer, but I just wanted to share in the praises, here.  I almost *never* give a film 5 stars, but I didn't hesitate with this one.  I hope everyone involved is extremely well rewarded for this refreshing film!!",1277164800,,812,4.833333333333333

In a near-future society, people can have timers implanted that let them countdown to when theyll meet their soulmate. But should we know? And how do people  and society as a whole  react to the change in dynamic?

What did I think?

One of those rare films that poses thought-provoking questions without becoming preachy with answers. In fact, a lot of the questions  both subtle and direct  are wonderful explorations about romantic expectations and attitude. Emma Caulfield is incredible as a girl feeling the pressure of finding a soulmate in a world where science has supposedly found a way to guarantee knowing your soulmate. But is love still powerful without mystery? A delightful independent flick that connoisseurs (and sociologists) will enjoy. Not to mention the romantics of course.",1496016000,,812,5.152671755725191

The ending is a little off, in my opinion, but I think the story line is interesting. The ending is still good, but I personally would have written it differently. I have a love/hate relationship with technology, so I found it intriguing. I also believe in soulmates. This is more of a rom-com, so your man may or may not appreciate it. I enjoyed it and would recommend to others if you have not seen it.
