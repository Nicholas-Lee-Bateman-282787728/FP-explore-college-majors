8420530,3,B004AN0COM,"I bought this collection of biographies being satisfied with the price and with the celebrities that were going to be discussed. However, when I watched the Marilyn Monroe and Shirley Temple biographies, I quickly realized that these cheap little biographies were nothing but boring interviews with people that may or may not have known these 2 stars. If you like interviews with (mostly) fakes, I suggest you order them. Beyond that, only the price is right with this item.",1366848000,8,474,5.012658227848101
