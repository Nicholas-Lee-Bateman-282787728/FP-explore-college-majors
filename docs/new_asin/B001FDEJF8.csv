3587143,5,B001FDEJF8,"This was filled with stories of Incredible courage and humility,  From the Civil War  up to the present there were pictures and later combat  films  of the battle scenes. These visual scenes, if not of the award winners heroics, still set the tone for their conflict, The program also made me aware that during the Civil War the award was given with a lower standard of personal risk (sometimes for enlisting in the Army). Since WWI the recipients are awarded the Medal for extraordinary valor; yet most of the award  winners said they only did what the situation asked of any member of their unit, There were some little known facts. For example Congress  recalled  many of the Civil War era Medals  on the basis limited personal risk or the fact that this was only to be given to Members of the Armed forces. The recalls included Buffalo Bill Cody because he was a civilian scout  in the conflicts with the Plains Indians,  The only female award winner Dr. Mary Edwards Walker was a Civil War battlefield surgeon  who could not enroll in the Union Army so she work for a civilian firm as a contract physician.  Buffalo Bill asked to have his Medal of Honor reinstated and because of his fame and influence it was., Dr. Mary Edwards Walker refused to return hers, won in the horror of field surgery where the most common procedures were amputations of injured limbs. The wounded love her because she saw amputation as the last resort,not the first and fastest treatment.  She wore it every remaining day of her life.

Unfortunately, late studies and this documentary have shed adequate light on the history of the CMH and how our politicians have manipulated the process for their gain.  As a non-professional historian, (whatever that is!) I am still in awe at the individuals who actually earn this recognition.  However, history has shown that our government has used and abused this process to ""show Off"" before a camera or a news conference, for their personal gain.  I have a publication on the total history of CMH winners and have realized that a significant number of awardees/winners have NOT done any real actions of bravery to be awarded this recognition.  This DVD was enlightening and a little inspiring, however, a deeper study of the history can reveal that the US Congress has taken away much of the ""super Specialness"" that should come with a CNH.",1404000000,3,935,4.855345911949685

Well done and (mostly) engagingly put together... it is all very informative, just slightly boring sometimes :)  Documents recipients, and how/why they got the medal, from its creation during the American civil war to the first five years of the War in Afghanistan/Iraq. Lots of material. Good history lesson.",1389571200,,375,5.147540983606557

Some fully cognizant of the consequences of their actions and others still not quite certain how they could have possibly done what they did.  Yet all humble and real in their remembrance of their great deeds.  There were even a few chuckles with the recounting of some of the details.

The recreated scenes are riveting and not at all fake or offensive.  Not a film I could fast forward thru...I actually replayed several bits since it was so compelling and I did not want to miss anything.  Well worth my time.",1389398400,,639,4.763636363636364

It was a sad day when he passed but he is home now where no war is safe in the arms of his God Jesus. He told me stories and we had a great time during the two yrs that I knew him. Watch this movie.

Best of all many of the special people that have been awarded the Nations highest honor, are alive to share their experiance with you. Plenty of facts you probably never knew are waiting to be discovered.

I would hope that no matter where you political or moral beliefs may rest, this documentary will give much thought to ponder of the super good found in the human race. Most heros are born, not made, and it is a refreshing journey through time and events that we should all be thankful for, their service.",1388534400,,628,4.607142857142857

These were ordinary people who went above and beyond any reasonable expectations, and their stories are brought out in such a human way! This film does not try to exalt them to deity; quite the contrary; it shows the humanity of them! These people weren't doing what they necessarily out of patriotism; they were doing it for their comrades right there with them most of the times. It's more of a compilation of stories of true devotion to one another.",1384387200,,649,4.803571428571429

The Medal of Honor has a fascinating history and it remains the highest commendation. To those who have served and those still serving, thank you. You have created a history of service that is and of itself, most remarkable.

The interviews are personal and in depth. The narrative and timeline are rather disjointed but the original footage is a positive. This could have been better presented but that is just a technical observation. The information is accurate and detailed. Definitely recommended to those who do not know the history and for those of us that do, perhaps some detail that has been missed in past documentaries.",1379808000,3,733,4.911290322580645

In all the cases submitted on this documentary there were several common characteristics...Honor, humility, unwavering patriotism & concern for their fellow human being!

And to me, that is EXACTLY what we all need to see in order to give us a miniscule feel of what our nation's military deals with every day, either at the moment or in their hearts and memories.  No, war is NOT pretty.  War wounds every single person who is a part of it.  Although many have disagreed with the politics of war, may God forever bless those who have answered our country's call to duty and have given their utmost for the rest of us.  I think this movie should be required viewing for every member of Congress.

FYI, this film was released in 2008, before three (so far) Medal of Honor awards were bestowed on living servicemen from Iraq and Afghanistan.
