I have been there twice and I still look at this video on the parts of the Philippines that I have not seen yet for ideas for my next trip.  The traveler in this video is Shilpa Mehta, whom I have not seen in any other Globe Trekker video - but she does a really good job covering a variety of facsinating things.  She starts off in the northern part of the country in the city of Baguio where she goes to a faith healer that performs surgery on her with only his bare hands!  She continues north to Sagada where the hanging coffins are and nearby is the 8th wonder of the world, the breath-taking rice terraces.  Going south, next is the town of San Fernando where the locals have a ritual around Easter time where some people choose to get nailed to a cross to honor Jese Christ.  Some of the stuff in this video is shocking and eye-popping!  Shilpa then heads south to the chaotic, conjested city of Manila to sample some of the nightlife.  Further south is the beautiful island of Boracay; one of the 7107 islands of the Philippines.  Here they show you what the beach is like as well as the wildlife on the island and activities such as scuba diving and horseback riding.  The next stop is Bacolod on the island of Negros, follwed by Davao and Lake Sebu on the island of Mindanao.  This area as well as the next stop is less travelled by foreigners and definately has a different culture than the north.  The last visits are Puerto Princesa, El Nido and Signapan Basin on the island of Palawan.  Here there are many opportunities for outdoor activities such as hiking and exploring caves and underground rivers.  Shilpa also visits the Tau't Batu tribe in the remote rainforest on this island.

Of course not everything can be covered in this country in 50 minutes, but this video does a great job of showing bits and pieces of this very diverse country.  Covered are things only found in this country and maybe only a few others, like religous ceremonies, the amazing rice terraces, cockfighting, bravely sampling local delicacies like bat, balut and durian fruit.  The video is very accurate about important information such as certain hazards to look out for, the high and low tourist seasons and other travel conditions that you should expect.

I recommend this video for any traveller to the Philippines, unless you are going to park yourself in one place during your visit or spend a lot of time in a hotel.  It will give you a great visual idea of what you are going to experience during your visit to this great country.",1120953600,6,2602,4.509594882729211
