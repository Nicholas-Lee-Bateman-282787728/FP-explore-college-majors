8336395,4,B001QU8834,"This documentary is about a Church with a vision they are convinced is from God. At least their pastor thinks so and convinces his congregation to get on board. As the story progresses we start to see how severely deluded this vision is. The filmmaker did not try to make these people look foolish. He lets them tell their own story. The Church has some extremely likeable people including the Pastor who guides them. They are very sincere people and are geniune Christians devoted to God. As things begin to unravel for them, you wonder why God did not intervene in some way. I think this is an important film that needs to be seen and discussed by Christians in small groups. It would be an ideal place to begin a discussion on ""Is that voice we hear really from God?"" or a hundred other topics of people attempting to serve their Creator. Highly recommended.",1350432000,4,861,4.561290322580645
8336396,4,B001QU8834,"Audience of one is one of those documentaries you watch and go through a whole series of emotions. Initially, you're drawn in on the preachers passion for what he's doing, making a movie, and the drive he puts behind it. Later on you start to realize things aren't what they seem, no one seems to know what they're doing. Next comes disbelief as Satan starts to take the blame for the failures. Next you start to laugh when you really know you shouldn't and lastly you sit with mouth wide open as you watch an air-liner crash into a train wreck and both slide down a hill into the sea and sink an ocean liner. Stunning stuff.

This is a wonderful documentary that highlights what anyone ""believes"" they can achieve when they feel they're on a mission from God. also it highlights how the blind will follow the blind through absolutely anything when, they too, are led to believe they are doing God's work.

Richard Gazowsky is a 2nd generation Pentecostal preacher in San Francisco. Obviously sheltered, he saw his first movie at age 40. So moved by the experience, he receives a vision/calling from God to make a sci-fi movie about the story of Joseph, which he names ""Gravity"". He, allegedly, secures funding from an offshore source and flies his small congregation to Italy to start filming. Sparing no expense, he purchases hi-tech equipment and crew and starts to film... slowly. Dogged by problems the crew comes back home and leases some high-priced real estate from the city (Treasure Island) to produce the movie. Problem is, there is no movie and this leads to a warehouse full of people (the congregation) sitting around, goofing off and basically doing nothing including paying their bills.

As the whole project implodes in on itself due to the alleged investors withdrawing, Gazowsky appears to become more and more irrational and will not admit defeat. In the closing parts of the documentary we see him reveal to his congregation God's new plan for the church that blows insanity out of the stratosphere. Here we see faith cross the line into delusion.

This documentary is riveting. You can't not watch it to the end as disbelief turns to pity for Gazowsky and his followers. In his mind, there's nothing he can't do as it's all God's will. If it fails, it's Satan's fault and it's onto the next project.

Superbly entertaining, add it to your list to watch.

8336397,5,B001QU8834,"I was completely blown away by this documentary. Though the film is a careful examination of one man's ""God-given"" vision to bring God's Word to the masses through creating a movie, I believe it was actually a brilliant examination of delusional thinking, especially as it relates to religion.  Assemblies of God pastor, Richard Gasowsky, first convinces his small congregation to dig deep into their pockets to fund this project, which Gasowsky estimates will cost $200 million dollars.  It is testimony to his faith (or delusion) that he believes movie will transform the world.  Strangely, it seems the greater the odds against him and his small band of followers, the more he becomes convinced that his God can conquer anything, even banks, creditors, and the city of San Francisco.

This documentary is a ""must see"" for pastors and congregations.  It shows the power of faith and delusional thinking.  And the conclusion will knock you off your feet!",1278460800,2,955,5.089743589743589
8336398,4,B001QU8834,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie  but am dumbfounded at how gullible people are. Again it has been demonstrated that all one has to do it associate religion with something and many people will believe it unquestionably. There appears to be no critical thinking about anything the minister and his family say or propose, no matter how absurd it is. Most of those involved in the making of the minister's movie substitute prayer, formula religious gestures and behavior for talent and reality. When they can't pay their bills they blame Satan, rather than admit they are in over their heads. Views of the church and it's parishoners give the impression that they are poorly educated and not very successful in life. The actors he chooses don't have an ounce of talent and seem to be people with problems. In the midst of their financial problems the minister has eight more ideas from God that are even more absurd and the parishioners seem to be inspired by them. I would certainly watch the movie again and recommend it to others.",1274054400,7,1028,4.775280898876405
8336399,4,B001QU8834,"On the surface, this documentary is about a preacher and his San Francisco congregation working together to do what they believe God has called them to do -- produce a Bible-based sci-fi / fantasy film. On a deeper level, it's an opportunity to observe how a rational faith can morph into a delusional one, and how confidence in one's own vision is abandoned when one's faith is given over to the vision of another.",1264550400,6,415,4.621621621621622
8336400,5,B001QU8834,"AUDIENCE OF ONE follows pastor Richard Gasowsky as he and his congregation struggle to make their first film, after he has a vision sent from God. He sells his house and he and his family move back in with his mother, as he raises the funds and convinces his church to make the science fiction version of the story of Joseph. He takes the crew all the way to Italy and back, as well as through the San Francisco legal system, as they try to learn how to make a film, and wait for funding from a mysterious German source. Despite the absurdity of the story-line, director Michael Jacobs gives us a rather unbiased, uncritical view of these aspiring filmmakers, allowing the characters and the people to take over without any mocking. In the end he produces a highly entertaining documentary that tells us of faith and filmmaking. I am still wondering what it was like to be a filmmaker filming other fimmakers that have no idea what they are doing. Was it frustrating? Did the documentary crew help? Perhaps I'll have to check out the DVD special features and see if I find my answer.",1243382400,7,1083,4.530612244897959
