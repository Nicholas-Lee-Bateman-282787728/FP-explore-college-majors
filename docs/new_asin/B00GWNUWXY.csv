8628001,5,B00GWNUWXY,"I own over 200 wrestling and jiu jitsu dvds that I have studied. I have seen the spectrum of dvds from terrible to excellent.  I can honestly say that this dvd is excellent. Excellent in delivery, details & explanations, and demonstrations.  It is one of the best that I own.  Definitely worth purchasing. I have zero regrets buying it.  They go over sprawling, front headlock situations, head in the hole, etc. Now you can tell this is an older video tape converted into dvd format. So do not expect some 1080p high quality image. It is definitely video tape quality image. But despite the lack of image quality, it does not take away one bit from the extremely high quality lessons.",1520899200,,684,4.628099173553719
