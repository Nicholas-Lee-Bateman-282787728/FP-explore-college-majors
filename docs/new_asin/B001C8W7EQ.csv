3506533,5,B001C8W7EQ,"Having watched every episode of Burn Notice, my wife and I, along with several friends and family members, are completely hooked.

In a way this show reminds me of another series we thoroughly enjoyed 20 years ago, Stingray. Although Stingray was completely under the radar, and Michael is always blip number one, there are still similarities. Michael's skill at going undercover and improvising a role comes to mind. Also, Stingray's stories were a trade in 'favors', and Michael and friends often help someone as a favor, or for only expenses. Both had secretive but evidently quite successful histories in secret ops.

One of the things I enjoy most about Burn Notice are the little 'spy tips' that grace every show. Some of them make sense, some are utter nonsense, and some of them I'm not too sure about, but they're all fun.

Another thing I like about it is the way in which the 'bad guys' often come to grief in very satisfying, often funny ways. The late 2nd season episode where Michael foils a bank robbery is hilarious.

Whether it makes sense all the time or not, obviously the writers of this show care, and are putting a good effort into each script. That makes up for any sins and makes for a quite entertaining show.

This series is remarkably consistent throughout its run, even though I thought the writers kind of lost the track in the last two seasons. Although there have been a few stand out shows that I particularly enjoyed, I can't really think of any ""stinkers"" that I had to overlook. USA Network just keeps coming out with many of the most entertaining shows on TV over the last few years, and Burn Notice is part of that group.",1476057600,,1658,4.625850340136054

However, with Burn Notice I have bought Season 1 and Season 2 and will continue to buy each season until I have the entire set.  It is exciting, extremely well written, and lots of fun.  The actors know their stuff and when it gets really intense, they say something that breaks some of the tension.  I am never bored.

3506650,5,B001C8W7EQ,"My sons hooked me on this show and we watch episodes together.  Love the main character, Michael, the burned spy who adopts different characters and accents in situations.  He's very entertaining - rather like Eddy Murphy was in BEVERLY HILLS COP when he would adopt different identities to get into establishments.  He's also a black belt and does other martial arts in real life so handles fight scenes well.  When he's eating yogurt in his shed of a home, with his wry deadpan humor, he reminds you of Jerry Seinfeld.  A spy Seinfeld, if you can picture that.

His sidekicks add color to the show whether it's his explosives expert, part-time girlfriend, Fiona or his cheesy but remarkably competent friend Sam, they are a great team.  His mother, Sharon Gless, is a bit whiny but still fun as she makes most other mothers look good as she's constantly smoking or drinking and not doing much of anything else except scheduling therapist appointments for Michael and herself to discuss their relationship.  Yeah.  Michael is very patient.  When she's on stage I keep commenting to my sons they're lucky to have me as a mother instead of that.

The plots and dialogue are original.  Only the bad guys seems to get hurt and they usually kill each other off which is always fun to watch.  Because the show is light and funny, the darker moments don't seem too grim.  Some of the episodes have you laughing out loud.

There is one long story arc, and then several short story arcs in each episode which keeps it lively.  It's a fun series that keeps its momentum this season and gets even better.",1377907200,,1594,4.659498207885305

3506657,3,B001C8W7EQ,"I LOVE burn notice, it's my favourite show ever. Michael&Fi are my OTP and as long as they're together it's the best show ever, and will ever be, made.
That being said, I'd give episodes 1-5 in this season maybe 2 stars and I wish I could give 6-9 zero.
I really HATE Fi's fake boyfriend, who's existence is to make Michael jealous.
I'd say that episode 10 is okayish, because it is a turning point, They dump the fake boyfriend and make it really clear that Michael&Fi are still totally a canon couple. But that being said it's still, ehh... But in the next episode...
Hot Spot marks the wonderful turning point where burn notice becomes everything awesome it possibly could be again(yay!)
Michael&Fi*spoiler alert* are back together!
And the whole show is back to its absolute complete standard of excellence that you would expect from the best show ever made. Completely worthy of 5 stars(or 50 million).
I love it so much.
So I would suggest, if you can, skipping episodes 1-10 of this season and skipping straight to episode 11 Hot Spot(which is so excellent you can't believe!)",1371686400,,1083,4.675392670157068

Jeffrey Donavan, Gabrielle Anwar, and Bruce Campbell really are what make this show great.  I love the dry wit and interesting spy facts that are shared, all over a compelling storyline.  The main storyline behind the show (who burned Michael and why) is still a mystery after 2 seasons, but you don't get frustrated that the story is going nowhere, the show focuses on what Michael is doing now, taking whatever jobs he can get for whatever pay they can afford, and that keeps the show going for the most part.  It's funny, witty, action-packed, filled with fun facts/information to add a little more to the show.  I highly recommend this show to anyone that is tired of the bland cookie cutter shows that the networks keep putting every year.  This show is really something special.",1370995200,,850,4.671140939597316
3506660,5,B001C8W7EQ,"I am devoted fan of Burn Notice. I think season 2 is either the best or one of the best seasons. Season one saw Michael, Fiona, Sam and Madeline's characters get settled into their strides. The long term arc of the show was established to frame the trajectory of the characters. The pattern of the show is compelling with each show having a arc storyline moving the main burn notice theme forward and containing another storyline that is self-contained. Those self-contained stories are what drew me in when I discovered Burn Notice during the second season of broadcast.

I am pleased with the Season 2 Blu-Ray set I purchased at Amazon. The case was sturdy and all the disks still in their mountings. The picture and sound seem superb on my Panasonic blu-ray. I feel like the player makes more difference than I would normally expect with this digital format. The set is technically fine by my viewing of the first blu-ray disk.

As tv series sets go I am a little sad there aren't more ""features"". Just missing scenes from several episodes, a few commentary tracks, and a featurette I have not watched yet.  I would like to have seen outtakes, gag-reels, making-of mini-documentaries, interviews with the actors, producers, and directors, and additional background information.  The Stargate DVD sets did this sort of thing pretty well. These would add to my perceived value of the blu-ray season set vs streaming of the plain shows.

Still, I love Burn Notice I can't knock the blu-ray set. It still gets 5 stars. Keep at it Michael Weston. Your fans have your back.

I hope this helps someone.",1370908800,,1598,4.771739130434782

In other words, it knows right from wrong, the good guys from the bad guys, but keeps a necessary light touch, just the same.  The four primary actors and actresses are excellent, by the way.

If Fox had any pride at all they would do a recall of these disgraceful pieces of junk. If you really want season 2, I would just get the regular DVD set.

3506706,5,B001C8W7EQ,"My family has fallen in love with ""Burn Notice!""  We don't have cable so the first time I saw the show was when I was traveling and staying in a hotel.  For Christmas I bought MYSELF the first season of ""Burn Notice!""  My boys (ages 23 and 17) and I quickly devoured the first season so I ordered the second.  It did not disappoint.  I will be ordering the third season soon so we can keep up with Michael Weston's quest to find out who ""burned"" him.

In case you don't know, the premise of the series is that Michael Weston is a former spy who was blacklisted and is now trying to find out by whom and why.  He is joined in his escapades by his ""trigger-happy"" on-again off-again girlfriend Fiona, and his former Seal friend, Sam.

Besides the great story lines, the characters in this series are priceless and the shows are full of comic relief even while there are many tense moments.  Michael Weston is ""McGyver on steroids"" - at least that's how I describe it.  Every epidsode showcases his and Fiona's skills at blowing things up, bugging cell phones and a whole host of other spy tricks.

As far as family viewing, this show is incredible in this sex-saturated age in that it does NOT show gratuitous sex or nudity.  It is based in Miami so like ""CSI Miami"" (which has gotten ridiculously absurd) there are brief scenes of bikini-clad girls.  I have to say though that this show has far less situations that might concern parents than most network television.  And I am a very conservative mom raising sons who know that it is patently wrong and offensive to objectify women.  This show, in my opinion, is the perfect blend of mystery, comedy, and cameraderie.  Highly recommended!",1305244800,,1688,4.539735099337748

 - Method Man
 - China Chow
 - An Assasin (blonde female) that tricks Mike
 - Fiona wearing a min-skirt with thong poking out
 - Fiona dancing in a club telling Mike he should look for a woman to date

I was not impressed when I watched it the first time because Michael, Jeffrey Donovan, seems too stiff and animated but Fiona, Sam, and Michael's mother, Maddie, Sharon Gless bring in the human and comical side of this very unique series.  Michael is becoming more a more likable and humanized character from the first series.

The way the writers intertwine the stories on the show and the special effects and commentary on the devices, lives of spies, predicaments, etc. is very educational and informative.

3506716,4,B001C8W7EQ,"For under 25 dollars including shipping I received the second season of Burn Notice on DVD recently. It arrived fast and at first it looked like a knock-off, as the case and DVD print work looked faded, but then I was told that amazon manages to get better deals than mainstream stores by selling B-line products: essentially the DVD works and everything is workable, but there may be some cosmetic issues that means the manufacturer wouldn't ship them out for full price. Whether that is true or not, I don't know but the product works fine and you have to squint to see any issues with the print work. Either way, not a problem to me.

I'm currently about halfway through watching season two it and it is as good, if not better than the first season. Admittedly, I'm a latecomer to the show, with it being on Season 4 now, I believe, but I'm fast catching up with these DVDs. Overall, the amazon experience has been 5 stars, can't fault it.

The series itself is a 3.5 or 4 out of 5 for me. Overall, the acting is pretty good to good and the plot line is interestingly refreshing. It is equally fun to watch for both men and women, which is something that this genre often doesn't manage to do very well. The female characters do seem a tad annoying to both me and my partner, but we both enjoy Sam and Michael, the main male characters. Whether this is intentional or not, I do not know, but it does make the show a little annoying at times for us both. However, the storyline is interesting enough for us both to ""push"" through the annoying female characters. One of the interesting reoccurring features of the show is the reoccurring ""MacGyver"" scene in most episodes, where they prepare to go into action with some homemade nifty item that manages to be of great use. Most are actually well-researched and would work in a real-world application, with a couple of the key steps missing, to avoid the odd person being stupid enough to try it at home. So essentially you get a cross between MacGyver and a watered-down James Bond, which is refreshingly funny, interesting and enjoyable for the whole family.",1284336000,,2110,4.535433070866142
3506717,5,B001C8W7EQ,"Burn Notice is one of the best television shows to ever air.  The writing is creative, the characters despite their differences sync in a way where you root for them collectively more than as individuals.  The intertwining of an episode storyline with the season's storyline is done quite nicely.  They have a good way of demonstrating the win the war even if it requires losing a battle to do so mentality.

This season has it's share of feel good stories and get even by kicking some a** stories.  For the price, this show is an absolute bargain.  We (my wife and I) got on the bandwagon after one of the seasons of 24 ended (looking for a fix in the summer), and let's just say we own all of the Burn Notice DVDs and only one of 24.

3506721,5,B001C8W7EQ,"Burn Notice manages to blend spy thrillers and cinematic action with down-to-earth realism. Michael Westen isn't James Bond or Jason Bourne -- as he says in the very first episode, ""Guns make you stupid. Better to fight your wars with duct tape. Duct tape makes you smart,"" just before he gets past an armored door using a stud finder and a roll of duct tape. Like a cool MacGuyver without the bad hair, Michael wins by out-thinking and out-planning his foes, not just by beating them up and shooting them (though there's plenty of that, too). And his running internal narration fills the audience in on WHY he's doing what he's doing. Yes, you too can turn a cell phone into an audio bug, and here's how!

The cast fits together like a glove and with amazing chemistry. His ex-girlfriend (and former IRA terrorist) Fionna adds impulsiveness and anger to the group, while his ex-military friend Sam (played by the amazing Bruce Campbell) alternates between the voice of reason and a hook for some skirt-chasing humor. The interplay and developing relationship between Michael and his mom (who swings between helping the crew -- sometimes even saving the day -- and being a serious thorn in Michael's side) is realistic and fun to watch. The relationships between all of the characters (but especially the one between Michael and his mom) grow and develop as the series goes on, which is one of the best reasons for watching it.

On each episode, someone comes to the team for help with a problem no one else can take care of (A-Team style). While the group is dealing with that, the overall ""season plot"" gets advanced a bit. In Season One, Michael is just trying to figure out who burned him and why. In Season Two, Michael is trying to get out from under their thumb. In Season Three, Michael has lost his protection and has deal with ""real life"" in the form of prying cops and old enemies. In Season Four, Michael has a broader view of what's going on, and is trying to stop a dangerous conspiracy. The ""story arc"" for each season is always advanced -- sometimes a little, sometimes a lot -- so you never feel like a show was just a throwaway they tossed together.

If you're not into Burn Notice, check it out, Thursdays at 9 on USA. If you are a fan, then what are you waiting for? Get this DVD set! The show is amazing!",1279152000,,2325,4.544152744630072

I got Season 2's DVD at the beginning of April & we started watching it right away.  It was fantastic.  If you are a Burn Notice fan you will want this set of DVD's.  If you aren't a Burn Notice fan & are starting with this season I would recommend that you get Season 1 first because you'll miss a lot of the jokes.  They won't be in any context for you.

Having someone else yanking Michael's chain became a great plot line & Karla was great for that.  The clients that Michael got were top notch stories & the underlying theme of trying to find out who burned Michael blended in real smoothly.  There were great guest stars this season with Michael Shanks being my favorite.  His character of Victor was fantastic.  He's a great stick for the carrot.  Sam & Fiona were great in their roles.  Fiona is a fantastic character right from the very beginning.  (I would love to meet & date a girl like her.)

I think that anyone that enjoys good dramas that have good comedy in them will really enjoy Burn Notice.  Start with Season 1 & keep going through Season 2.  You'll have a hard time to stop watching to do anything else.

I got turned on to this at Netflix and was blown away. This is the best TV show I have seen for a long, long time. Mix Miami Vice, Macguyver, the Bourne movies and add a touch of noir detective voice over, and you get the idea. The blend is fresh, exciting, enjoyable to watch, well written, shot, and acted. There is a great blend of drama, action, and comedy, and the writers manage to throw in plot twists and multiple story arcs which keep one guessing, yet do not feel contrived.

The characters seem real and believable. The mix and chemistry are great, and the development of characters and long term arcs is very well handled at all levels. Good job to everyone involved in this. In this day and age, it is not easy to create and maintain a good show like this.

Highly recommended. I am going to buy seasons 1 and 2, and am waiting anxiously for season 3.

3506734,4,B001C8W7EQ,"Burn Notice season 2 began right where the season 1 finale left off. Throughout the season you learn more about the people that burned Michael. The information came slowly throughout the year because Michael spends most of his time helping the helpless. There is always one civilian aid plot in every episode, and also a job for the people that burned MIchael. It's a 50/50 formula that works out quite well. I do wish that they would have given some more time to the overall mythos of the show and why he was burned, but then maybe it would have taken some of the formula out of the show. If it turned straight mythos like some other shows viewers might stop watching. There are alot of dramatic moments with Mike and Fiona throughout the year, and it was nice to see their relationship change because of MIchael's decision to leave at the end of the first season. My favorite episode of the season would have to be ""double booked."" It showed an interesting side of MIchael at the end. Michael's narration of espionage is still the best part of the show, along with Fiona's explosions. This season Michael is given a handler from the people that burned him and her character is filled in piece by piece. When the season ends you finally see the entire picture. I'm glad they did so because if they kept giving you only small tidbits of information every episode, people would start to get impatient. I think it has hurt season 3 somewhat, but something new will come along.

The picture quality does not match the quality of the show though. There is an even thick amount of grain in about every shot. The only scenes that look good are the open shots of Miami, the rest look terrible. I don't blame the Blu Ray, because I've seen the season one dvd. This show is shot in 35mm film and is meant to have grain. It's how Matt Nix wants it to look. Just zone it out and focus on the show not the picture. There are a few commentary tracks, but it doesn't include Gabriel Anwar or Jeffrey Donovan. There are also deleted scenes and a trailer on every disc for the set itself which makes no sense. Not bad special features but they could have been better.

This season is a great addition to your collection. The picture quality keeps it from getting the perfect score that it deserves. I hope there is another release that uses grain reduction to clean up the image. The show itself has alot of interesting plot developments and the dialogue is as witty as ever. Every episode brings you one step closer to the information you want to know. Who burned MIchael Weston, and some information is worth risking everything for.",1262736000,,2618,4.509473684210526

Each episode builds so well into the next with Michael getting so close to the truth about his burning and then it just blows up in his face. The realism of each episode is just great and I have half of next season on my DVR and am looking forward to the next half of season 3 to add to my collection of Burn Notice.,1255651200,,705,4.079136690647482

3506770,5,B001C8W7EQ,"When I wrote about season one of BURN NOTICE I couldn't praise it enough. Not only was it a well thought out action thriller for TV, it starred Bruce Campbell. How bad could it be? What can I say, I'm a fan.

When season two began I found myself unable for one reason or another to continue to catch each episode on television. Thank goodness once more for the chance to watch a series uninterrupted via DVD box sets.

The set up for the series is easy enough. Michael Weston (Jeffrey Donovan) is a covert agent who has just been given a burn notice. This means that his cover is withdrawn, bank account frozen, history deleted and he is out on his own. Unfortunately Michael was in the midst of a transaction with terrorists and must now escape them first.

He does so and finds himself stranded in Miami, Florida. With no help, no money and no idea who issued the notice, Michael turns to his most trusted friends: an ex-girlfriend named Fiona (Gabrielle Anwar) who used to work as a bomber for the IRA and an old military friend named Sam (Bruce Campbell) who sold information on Michael to the FBI for money now and then.

Michael's goal in season one was to find a way to make a living and at the same time discover who it was who issued his burn notice. In so doing, he hoped to get his old life back. Along the way, we got to see that he was a white knight of sorts who helped people who truly had no one else to turn to. Each episode offered a client with a description and a problem that needed solved Michael Weston style.

At the end of season one, we started to get a glimpse along with Michael of who had burned him. A woman named Carla began calling and as the series finale ended, Michael Weston was in a car in a truck trailer on his way to meet the mysterious Carla.

Season two continued Michael's search for the issuer of the burn notice. It turns out that Carla worked for a secret organization that took Michael offline from his own plans and now wants to put him to work for their organization. The name is unknown and the man in power behind Carla is as well. So the search continues.

As do the jobs needed to make a living and to help people in need. Included in this group are a young teenage whose life is threatened by a gangster wannabe car thief, a Haitian thug wanted for murder by the father of a young woman he killed, a woman who works with a relief program whose medical supplies were stolen by pirates and even Michael's ex-fianc, a woman no one in his small circle even knew existed.

But season two offered more than the usual search and assist stories we came to enjoy. We got to know each character a little bit better. With Fiona we saw that even though the two had parted ways and tried to keep a professional distance, there was an intimacy and affection that ran deeper than they would care to admit. The love between the pair was there for all to see with the exception of the two participants.

The same was true with the relationship between Michael and Sam, two die hard buddies who would throw their lives down for one another. Thank goodness this relationship didn't get as steamy as the one with Fiona!

And we got to see Michael get a little bit closer to his mother as played by Sharon Gless. Past differences, past problems and more were always on the table with these two. And yet a respect and love for his mother was there even through the frustration he showed to her.

By the end of this season, we are let in on just who is the man behind the whole burn notice. Maybe. But then again there could be someone behind him. As he tells Michael that he's not been trying to take him out but to protect him from the many enemies Michael has mad as a cover op, Michael chooses to go it alone. As season two ends, he apparently has been released, but now any and all enemies from his past can declare open season on him.

Now it's just a matter of time. Time to sit and wait until season three finishes and comes out on disc as well.

The series is fantastic. It offers tons of action, plenty of thrills, a great looking location (and cast) and enough humor to make a perfect blend. Donovan does a wonderful job as Weston showing acting chops I am certain no casting director has taken note of. Had they done so, he would be sought out more often. Anwar has gone from child star to vamp with ease, and offers the perfect touch of romantic at heart in her character of Fiona. And Bruce? Bruce does what he does best, being the sidekick while getting attention as well.

There are tons of series available on DVD. Some you collect because you love the series and some you buy to see what the series is like. When you buy BURN NOTICE you'll end up purchasing for both reasons. And become the fan that I've become.",1247356800,3,4761,4.281423804226919
3506771,5,B001C8W7EQ,Great show! Jeffery Donovan and Gabrielle Anwar are perfect together.  Bruce Campbell is great as a cross between a someone who is always looking what's in it for him and a really good friend. Sharon Gless is good as always.,1247356800,,224,4.6
3506772,4,B001C8W7EQ,"Refreshingly simple, straightforward but well done and entertaining, thanks to solid stories, clever plot devices and charming characters.  When your brain is tired from the more challenging fare of 21st Century hour-long dramas like BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (or just tired of the ridiculous twists upon arbitrary twists of the CSIs and the LAW & ORDERs), it's nice to relax with a fun show with a very '80s feel ... think A-TEAM, THE EQUALIZER, MAGNUM P.I., or something in that vein.

What's not to love about it?  A pastiche of ALIAS cover identities, MACGYVER improvisation with technology, THE EQUALIZER helping out the underdogs, and ROCKFORD FILES laid-back charm.  Nothing truly original about it, but it has all the great elements that make good television.

The show looks great in HD, but it's not the kind of show that demands HD (like the candy colors of PUSHING DAISIES or the crisp cinematography of the CSI franchise).",1247270400,,930,5.052287581699346

3506779,2,B001C8W7EQ,"I must sadly concur with the majority of poor reviews that this Blu-ray release of ""Burn Notice: Season Two"" has received thus far. While the sound quality is excellent (as it should be for any HD release), the picture quality leaves much to be desired. My main complaint is not that the picture is grainy, but that the picture is not ""crisp"". The original HD airings on USA were grainy, but they were also crystal clear. This alleged HD Blu-ray release is not. Even the video transfer on my ""Burn Notice: Season One"" regular DVD set is far ""crisper"" than my Season Two Blu-ray. There is absolutely no excuse for this. I sent FOX an e-mail complaint via their FoxStore.com website. I strongly recommend that anyone who is unhappy with the quality of their Blu-ray set utilize the ""Contact Us"" link on that website and voice your displeasure. A Customer Service phone number is also provided should you choose to speak to someone directly rather than send an e-mail. Either way, the more people who speak up and complain, the more likely FOX will respond to our concerns and address the situation. I am giving this release 2 stars mainly for the exceptional sound quality and the fact that the set is still watchable even if the picture quality is not up to HD standards.",1246406400,4,1270,4.648888888888889

I don't like the grain very much, but I wish people would are complaining about the grain being in the Blu-ray would actually educate themselves on the issue.  The grain is supposed to be there, whether we like it or not.  If you don't like it, complain to the director of photography as he is the one who wanted the grainy look and feel to the show.

I DONT RECCOMEND THAT ANYONE BUY THE BLU RAY,1246233600,6,454,3.6875
3506782,5,B001C8W7EQ,"Content-wise, this was an incredible season. I thought that it was a very good show in Season 1 that I would recommend to people with the caveat that it's not the best show on television, but it's a lot of fun to watch. With the second season, amidst the other shows on television this spring, it was clearly one of the top 5 shows on television, in my opinion. It went from just being a methodical, serialized spy show to really digging in deeper into the characters it revolves around and a more concrete driving plot towards the main character's main goal.

It follows burned (fired) spy Michael Westen (Jeffrey Donovan) as he works for the people who burned him while trying to get his freedom back from them and figure out exactly who issued the burn notice and why. All the while, he's moonlighting in really fun situations. The writing got better this season, and the acting was as solid as ever from Jeffrey Donovan, Gabrielle Anwar (Fiona), and Bruce Campbell (Sam Axe). Donovan really shines, but everyone holds their own. To sweeten the pot, the season finale was one of the best season finales I've ever seen. I've never seen a season come to such a satisfying end while leaving me wanting more. For example, the last season of Lost left me wanting more, but I was pissed because it's sole purpose was almost to cheat me into watching next season by not wrapping barely anything up. Anyway, I highly recommend watching this show. Season 1 is a great season, don't get me wrong, but this season was like having your cake and eating it, too. It never ceases to amaze me how creative this show gets - it's not your standard formulaic cop show like every other cable television show out there, it really does make you think and you learn some pretty neat things.

As far as the Blu-ray set: it's as unimpressive as Fox's television DVD sets normally are. There's commentary and deleted scenes on a handful of episodes, a blooper reel, and a short behind-the-scenes featurette. What I found very tacky, though it's a common practice nowadays, is that it starts out each disk with an advertisement for this very set as well as the upcoming season. This is a touch better than advertising other shows, but I feel like I should get back some of the money I paid for having to watch their advertising. By the way, the advertising is in sub-standard definition - it's terrible quality. The behind-the-scenes featurette and blooper reel were pretty neat, and some of the commentary was alright but I didn't listen to all of it. The deleted scenes were in pretty terrible quality, but they're just nice to have on there. The actual episodes had pretty decent sound quality and really spotty video quality.

A lot of people have been bashing the video quality, but I think they're being HD brats (I'm usually an HD brat, myself). I'm sorry, but this isn't Lost or Heroes. The Burn Notice folks don't get big budgets to put on stunning visuals. I'll admit that it's overpriced as a Blu-ray to not have near-perfect colors and sharpness and such, but it's definitely not that bad. I felt that it was plenty sharp and some scenes had really beautiful colors. Several scenes tended to have a lot of grain - typically in the background though. The people usually looked pretty good, but sometimes a black background would be speckled with white. This wouldn't bother anyone except for people like me who walk to the television to look for imperfections like that for reviews like these or people who watch way too much high definition content. I'm used to watching Burn Notice in standard definition, so I can vouch for this being significantly better than that, and whether or not it's better than what you see on USA HD is debatable because I didn't see Season 2 in HD but Season 3 doesn't seem to look a whole lot better than what I see on my Blu-ray. It is, however, much prettier than Season 1 on DVD. The graininess thing is really not that bad though - there were plenty of scenes that really do look good. My TV is fairly top-of-the-line (Samsung Series 7 LCD), also, so maybe that's why I'm not seeing it as bad some others are. I do think it lives up to being a Blu-ray disc, just on the lower end. We have the same issue with DVDs: the best looking DVDs look a lot better than the terrible ones, and that's just how it is. You're going to have that with any high definition format, the point is that it's still a lot better thant he previous generation.

Should you get this season? Absolutely. This show bears watching again and again. Should you get it on Blu-ray? That's a judgement call. I think the DVDs for Season 1 looked bad enough to spring for Blu-ray for Season 2 (especially with the excerpts of Miami scenery), but if you only want Blu-rays that look in line with Planet Earth then you should stick with the DVD.",1246233600,7,4830,4.554660529344074

With a DVD you could at least watch them in any DVD player and also watch them on your PC if you chose to do that. My computer monitor is not nearly as good as my television for watching video.

Burn Notice gets 5 stars, 10 if I could give that high of a rating on Amazon, but the Blu-Ray gets 1 star.

The show is very well written and full of action and suspense. I didn;t have cable so I had to watch season one on DVD and then had to wait for this to be released. Christmas came and I got a Blu-Ray player so I was extatic when Burn Notice came in Blu-Ray. To my disapointment I popped in the first disk and the picture looked like I was watching this through a window in a snow storm. It is terrible, and far below the standards of even DVD.

I have contacted Fox to complain about the quality of this release and they are doing nothing but offering to swap my Blu-Ray. They will do nothing till more people complain. So I encourage you to Contact Fox and voice your distaste with this substandard release. There is a customer service 1-800# on their web site.

In fact I'm in the process of returning do to the horrible (very grainy) look. The original airings on USA were much better.

3506787,4,B001C8W7EQ,"After getting hooked on the series halfway through the second season on USA, the Mrs. (""Fiona,"" in more ways than one) rented the first season. We loved the episodes and really liked the special features. So, we decided to buy our own copy of the first season as well as the second season. The second season set is fine as far as the DVD recordings themselves, but both of us are extremely disappointed by the special features. In place of the ""get burned"" commentaries by the major actors and Matt Nix that graced every episode the first season's DVDs, the second season set only has some deleted scenes.
""Fiona"" is not happy, but so far I have managed to hide the C4.",1245801600,,669,4.491803278688525
3506788,4,B001C8W7EQ,"Warning, a few spoilers ahead. I may be the only voice of dissent in that I liked season one of Burn Notice better. Season two was good and the acting was on par but it didn't seem as fresh. I still like the pilot episode ""smiling"" Westen better than the deadpan Michael of the series.

There were some memorable clients in season one like the surfer house sitter in ""Hard Bargain"" but not so much in season two. This time, client roles have been upstaged by consistently badder and smarter villains like episode dominating Carla and Victor. Trevor, the client in Scatter Point, was a notable exception.

The split screen ""24"" style cinematics in this season were overdone and distracting and the stunts and fiery explosions were even more intense, almost to the point of being over the top. The return of colorful characters like Virgil and agent Bly was enjoyable but it would have been great to see Nate developed more and I missed Lucy Liu.

When product placement in television is so blatant as to be annoying, it actually discourages me from buying that product. Especially so if the product manufacturer is bankrupt and supported with tax dollars. It seemed like half of each episode was a subliminal car commercial. The interplay and emotional exchange between the main characters is better than season one but I thought some of the celebrity guest stars could have been played by local actors and been just as effective.  I was underwhelmed by the final episode ending as I expected a cliff hanger to tie into the next season.

So to get to the point, is this DVD set worth the cost? One big issue is the bonus materials are paltry. Only the final episode has a voiceover with only one of the main actors. The rest of the set only contains a smattering of deleted scenes and a short gag reel. In the voiceover, Bruce Campbell wisecracks that only people in ""Buttcrack, Kansas"" would buy the DVD set to watch the episodes and I agree. If you are a die hard fan it might be worth it, but if you've already watched on the network, this set might not be worth your cash.",1245715200,,2075,4.567204301075269

3506793,5,B001C8W7EQ,"This series was not originally available in Canada, it was on HBO which until recently was verboten. I picked up Season One after seeing some great reviews and that Bruce Campbell was in it and got hooked digitally. The right amount of action, suspense and thrills mixed with some smoking chemistry between Jeff Donovan and Gabrielle Anwar, storylines with spies and con artists and some excellent writing makes for a great show.
Bruce Campbell and Sharon Gless are two of TV's pasttime greats who add humour, dimension and depth and drag this series from being just action-drama to a cut above.
In Season Two it keeps on growing. Mike Weston's difficulties with his new handlers keep interfering with his objective of the week, and makes his choices and actions even more outstanding because of the extra effort he has to go to in order that everything works out. The tension in Mike's and Fiona's relationship gives that extra spice to each episode, and the fact that Mike chooses to join his mom in counselling speaks volumes about his desperate desire to mend the bridges and be a son to her.
We may never get to know why Michael was burned, but while he is trying to figure that out he will continue to help others and in doing so, himself.
Get it if you can, and watch out for Season Three.",1245542400,3,1296,4.6147186147186146

3506795,5,B001C8W7EQ,"Michael Weston (Jeffrey Donovan) thought that finding out who burned him would be a good thing.  Instead, finding out has made this former spy's life much more complicated.  Now that Carla (Tricia Helfer) has stepped out of the shadows as the organization's mouth piece, he has to do her bidding.  She has him on some assignment, and Michael thinks it isn't a good thing.  So he's trying to find out all he can about the organization and the big picture so he can try to stop them.

But, meanwhile, he needs to eat, so he continues to take on assignments for people in desperate trouble.  There's the woman stalked by a drug dealer, the ex-con being roped back into a life of crime, the man who was lost his life savings to medical scam artists, and the football player being harassed by car thieves.  Heck, Michael even gets involved in tracking down a Haitian fugitive.

Fortunately, Michael has the help he needs in the form of ex-FBI agent Sam Axe (Bruce Campbell) and ex-girlfriend Fiona Glenanne (Gabriella Anwar).  Then again, those two often bring him clients with simple problems that turn complicated.  Not making things any easier is Michael's mother Madeline (Sharon Gless) who insists on family bonding moments at the worst possible times.

As much as I enjoyed season 1 of this show, I got even more hooked on season 2.  Everything was stronger.  The on going storyline is more than enough to keep anyone coming back from week to week.  Carla seems to be one step ahead of Michael the entire way, and I wanted to know what was going on as much as he did.  The weekly stories were just as strong.  I never saw how Michael and his friends would save the day.  And if you want tricky gadgets and plenty of explosions, this is the show for you.

But the human element of the story actually becomes stronger, too.  They play up the relationship between Fiona and Michael even more this season, making both those characters more real.  I wasn't a fan of Madeline in the first season, but I warmed to her here.  I still wouldn't mind if she was only a recurring character, but I do feel she adds to the show now.

As I write this, season 3 has just started, and they are building admirably on what came in this season.  Believe me, if you like action and suspense, this show is for you.",1245110400,,2293,4.498789346246974

3506799,5,B001C8W7EQ,"I am relieved to see Burn Notice hasn't suffered form a sophomore slump. Acting = spectacular. Plot = genre-defying. Guest stars = fantastic (particularly Tim Matheson and Michael Shanks as sociopathic nutballs) and once again, the season ends with a gratifying cliffhanger which instills both excitement and impatience for the next one. That said, there are a few irksome problems with the series.

For one thing, while the main story arc is fascinating, a few characters meet abrupt (and icky) resolutions way before we've had time to get to know them. Hey, what gives?! Episodes often have a rushed feel to them. And there's a lot of rapid cross-cutting, as if the show can't juggle the main story and subplot within the time allotted.

Secondly, I hope we get a break from the fractured family stuff. Michael's sleazy brother Nate is a welcome distraction, since he always brings with him buckets of trouble and is a capable sidekick. But what's happened to Madeline (Sharon Gless)? Where's the passive-aggressive blackmailing? The surly relationship with her offspring? Where's the ""edge""? Michael's mom is a big teddy bear now, and it's a weak point dramatically...especially since this family's various past traumas are soothed with frequent (and I mean FREQUENT) happy conclusions where everyone remembers to hug.

I'm exaggerating a little, but the family bits are a nuisance and detract from the action. Hopefully, Michael's work will spill over into his family, which will shake things up somewhat. Right now, things are way too cozy.",1242691200,,1545,5.147410358565737

I had heard about Burn Notice and I saw it online here and most of the time I just skipped over it thinking- ""oh its that USA show.  I bet its mostly about how many half naked girls they can show in a single episode.""
Then one day I decided to watch it... I was hooked.  It was surprisingly good.

Jeffery Donovan is a better actor than I thought, and Bruce Campbell, well what can you say about him... he is just fantastic.

I was instantly addicted and watched the entire 1st season in 1 day (only 9 episodes).  I couldn't wait for season 2 and it did not dissapoint.  Here is a tired idea that is made fresh and original with great writing, direction, and great performances from the cast.  Jeffrey Donavan, Gabrielle Anwar, and Bruce Campbell really are what make this show great.  I love the dry wit and interesting spy facts that are shared, all over a compelling storyline.  The main storyline behind the show (who burned Michael and why) is still a mystery after 2 seasons, but you don't get frustrated that the story is going no where.  The show focuses on what Michael is doing now, taking whatever jobs he can get for whatever pay they can afford, and that keeps the show going for the most part.  I highly recommend this show to anyone that is tired of the bland cookie cutter shows that the networks keep putting every year.  This show is really something special.",1237075200,30,1152,4.4688995215311005
3506805,5,B001C8W7EQ,"The writing for the first season of Burn Notice was excellent, very tight with interesting characters and situations. However, towards the end, a lot of fans were worried. Some of the helpless clients of the week were starting to feel a touch repetitive.

We needn't have worried.

The second season just finished, and I can assure you that the writing is even better, the characters stronger, and many of the story lines more compelling, than in the first season. It's no wonder the show has doubled its viewing audience. I particularly like how the characters have evolved. Michael has dealt with some of his family issues, gotten closer to his brother, and understands that his mother really does care about him--even if that's easier to take when she's not blowing cigarette smoke (literally) in his face. The bad guys are organized and smart, which means he have to be even smarter. It's good story telling.

However, even with all the other positives that made me pre-order the DVD set as soon as it was possible, there are several particular episodes that stand out from the rest, which alone are worth the price of the DVDs.  One of these involves Michael Westin trapped inside a bank during a robbery with a government agent, Bly, whom he blackmailed the first season and who hates Michael's guts. Watching  the respect build between the two, and the way they wind up working together -- not to mention Michael Westins way of dealing with the robbers -- is delightful. It's nothing you've ever seen before. It's not Die Hard and it's not like The Ransom of Red Chief (where a little boy makes kidnappers regret ever taking him to the point they wind up paying the parents to take him back). From start to finish, the robbers never figure out that they have a tiger by the tail. The only one with a clue how dangerous that Westin can be is Bly, who had read Westin's dossier in season 1 and has been dancing back and forth with him to see who can top whom. The ending is particularly satisfying. So, I really loved ""Bad Breaks"" and doubted (silly me) whether they could top this story line in the remaining episodes.

They did.

The season finale completed a fascinating story arc involving an ex-CIA agent, Victor, gone to the dark side. This 4 episode story arc alone makes this season is a must-have for fans. What can one say about this amazing character? Played by Michael Shanks in a recurring role, Victor took us through the gamut. We went from hating him and thinking he is a psychopath wavering on the edge of sanity (you were never quite sure how he was going to react to things), to realizing he was an incredibly tragic character and a cautionary tale of what Michael could have been in other circumstances. The emotional roller coaster we share with the characters on screen as we learn of Victor's back story (which comes out in the finale) and resulting changes in his relationship to Michael Westin is story telling at its best.

I have not been a fan of Michael Shanks in the past. However, his acting here is truly inspired. It goes far beyond anything I've seen him do other than in ""The Arc of Truth"" in the prison scene when Shanks' character, Daniel Jackson, finally gives up hope. It is worthy of an Emmy. Moreover, even with the already great supporting cast of Bruce Campbell (always worth watching and allowed some great scenes in the 2nd season), Sharon Gless (as Michael's mother who smokes while exercising to Jack LaLanne--which you have to watch to realize how funny that is), and Gabrielle Anwar (as the explosive Fiona), there's something magical about the chemistry between Shanks and Donovan that seems to kick Donovan's acting--already extraordinary--up a notch to a level seldom seen on the small screen.  And if the ending is shocking, the choices made surprising to the viewer, one cannot help but feel that the characters have been changed forever by this experience and nothing will be quite the same again. Perhaps  best of all, it makes the viewer asks of season 3, what's next? Because if there's one thing the writers, actors, and producers have shown us, it's that they understand good story telling, and can be trusted to make choices that will keep us on the edge of our seats, coming back for more.

I highly recommend this DVD set, especially if you haven't seen the show on TV. Although most of the story lines could work as stand-alones, there is an on-going story arc (of how and why Michael got burned and what he's doing to get his life back) that makes more sense if you watch them in order. The extras on the season 1 DVD set were excellent (including Donovan and Anwar's audition tapes), and I expect them to be equally good here. So far, I know of at least one extra that should be a lot of fun. Michael Shanks has reported recording a commentary track with Bruce Campbell and Matt Nix.

I speak for many fans when I say I can hardly wait for June, and the start of season 3 on USA network! Thank goodness Donovan's contract has been extended for another 6 years (total 8 seasons)! I love this show!",1236902400,92,5067,4.6177777777777775

I watch ""Burn Notice."" Every week. The first season of this spy action/comedy/drama about a spy who is ""burned"" or thrown into the street by his agency for reasons he cannot fathom was very good. That brought more budget. For second season that means better stunt and action scenes. And the show has even more humor.

Just finished the final hilarious, dramatic, edge-of-the-seat episode in the Carla theme. As good as a first-run theater production. Better, actually. Certainly better than Daniel Craig's James Bond franchise, which is cliched and takes itself way too seriously. ""Burn"" gives you real people you can care about. Unexpected things happen. Unexpected things are said.

What is top-flight is the quirky cast of characters that continues to develop...solid actors, main and supporting (Jeffrey Donovan of ""Touching Evil"" finds a winner here)...scripts that surprise with their humor and drama...direction that doesn't try to be too cute...eclectic sound track. That should do it.

If the concluding Carla episode doesn't win an Emmy, there is something wrong with the television industry. And of course for my money, there is. But I'm sort of a snob I guess. Which is why I don't watch tv series.

While the show is ""light drama,"" it strikes chords of human emotion; characters' motivations, while both clear and obvious, run deeper than fluff. Concepts like sacrifice, honor, duty, family, and friendship flow under the lighter and brighter dialogue and character interaction.  Somehow, the show has a feel both as light as an ""A-Team"" and as serious as any drama.  It's Mitch Rapp at his most smart-aleck times.  In the balance of light and heavy, it is a lot like a ""Magnum, P.I.,"" and the primary characters have a depth of interaction that approaches that earlier show's level.
Watch one episode for the bright and colorful camera work, the sexy and scantily-clad scenery, and some action and interaction.

Quote from Wanted Man:
Sam: Mike, I gotta tell ya, this is more fun than I expected.
I mean, I haven't done this sort of thing since... Gee, since there was an East Germany.
Mike: Glad you're enjoying yourself.
Sam: So how are things at home?
Mike: A little strange. Fiona likes to test relationships with the emotional equivalent of artillery fire.
Sam: Does she even want this guy?
Mike: I don't know, I've never been able to figure her out.
Sam: Well, I'm not one to tell you how to live your life.

I'm a real fan of dry humor, though I can never pull it off. The only time people laugh at me is when I'm being serious. My jokes- when I try to be funny -all fall flat- and nobody can tell when I'm serious or just kidding. My coworkers would tell you that it makes for an 'interesting' working relationship (if they're being nice). I... don't know what it is.

So - when I came across this show, I started watching the reruns from the first season, as a run-up to the 2nd season... and I've been really enjoying the show. It seems to be very educating - there are things that are presented here that I never thought about - in each episode... I discover a different way of thinking about things, a different way to do things, get things accomplished.

Things never quite turn out how I expect them to, or go off in directions that I didn't anticipate.  Then again, I'm a computer guy: what I know about people you can fit on a (corner of) a postcard.

I love the show because of the dry banter, just the right amount of conflict (I give it a PG10 for the  average American), and the new way of thinking about things. Oh. The acting is outstanding, the dialogue is clean and very well done.

I'm definitely looking forward to more shows. My other 'top of the list' television shows include Life (NBC) and Firefly (which the FOX network brainaics cancelled).

Great show, great acting, great plot, wonderful writing - hopefully the USA network will continue to see the value in this series for quite a while yet.

Everyone knew that Michael's character is emotionally bankrupt when it comes to personal relationships and we can all feel him on that point because of his line of work but the occasional heat between him and Fiona was hot and sexy and it made him seem human and heteral sexual. Now, this new twist makes him seem like a gay man playing a heteral sexual man and the love seens made him feel uncomfortable and forced. If he is gay in real life that is fine but please bring back the relationship with Michael and Fiona! I think not having an occational love seen will make him seem to unreal. After all the most famous spy character in the world (007) always has a beatiful women by his side even if she is trying to kill him, it keeps him real and not like some half a** super hero!",1215993600,7,1038,4.274111675126903
3506817,3,B001C8W7EQ,"I really really like this show last season.  My favorite part were the building relationships between people, the loyalty they all have for each other.  Also, quite funny at times.  Why I gave it 3 stars is  that, like another reviewer, I did not like how they handled Michael's relationship with Fiona in the first episode of this season.  It felt false, hollow, forced.  It just made me irritated with Michael for his stubborn refusal to be happy where he is.  To some degree Fiona is right about him - he always runs away from committed relationships.  And he is obviously deceiving himself - he does care for her.  I guess I just did not see the need for doing that to further the story.  Anyway, like the show for the most part.",1215907200,8,733,4.443609022556391
3506818,5,B001C8W7EQ,"Love this show, I didn't watch it until this year.  I caught a rerun of the last episode.  I then noticed teh ad for the unboxed videos here on Amazon so I thought I would watch it.  Feel in love immediately with the who show.  Fi is Gorgeous minus a few pounds (she needs a few pounds).  I'm glad I never saw the actor who plays Michael in the other shows other people are mentioning, he's great in this.  Sam I think was in Hercules with Kevin Sorbo(sp?).  They work great together!  Love USA, dislike NBC but love USA Network!",1215734400,19,529,4.22
3506819,4,B001C8W7EQ,"At long last, ex-spy Michael Westen and his motley covert ops crew are back!  I really loved season one and have been looking forward to this one for months now.  Season two starts up with a bang right up where season one left off. The gang are all back and it looks like ""Carla"", the smoky-voiced woman on the phone, might be a recurring character this season.  I didn't really like how they handled things with Fiona--I really enjoyed the spike and sizzle between her and Michael last season.  Whether things heat up between them this season or cool off, I just didn't like how their relationship was handled in this episode--it just felt ""off"" and that's why I took off a star.  All in all, it was a fun ride, I hope lots of people watch this show and that there are more seasons to come!",1215734400,16,791,4.35374149659864
