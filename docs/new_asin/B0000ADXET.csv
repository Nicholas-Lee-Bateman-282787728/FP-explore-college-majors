1905148,5,B0000ADXET,"I saw this movie several years ago and could not get it out of my mind. When I saw it here on Amazon, I could not wait to get it. This is just a good movie about people who are not afraid to try and do something even though they are pretty sure that there is nothing they will be able to accomplish. This is a movie that is very believable. I could actually see someone doing this if they were about to lose their jobs. This movie is well worth watching.",1403913600,,454,3.9456521739130435
1905149,4,B0000ADXET,"I love train movies, and this one didn't disappoint me. While it did ""drag"" a little, it was able to hold my attention for more than half a dozen viewings so far.",1403481600,,162,4.09375
1905150,4,B0000ADXET,"A tale of corporate greed; management wanting to make money at the expense of the ""little people"" and the resulting reaction of those ""little people"".  Somewhat like ""David vs. Goliath"", played out on a battlefield 4 feet, 8 1/2 inches wide.

Written with a slight bias -- having been involved with being around railroading [and being a railfan] for over 50 years.",1396051200,,364,4.854838709677419
1905151,1,B0000ADXET,"This is my first time ever writing a review on Amazon. I felt I should because this film transfer to DVD is so terrible and I've been a movie guy for over 50 years. I have good equipment and there is no way to adjust the grainy picture and very little you can do with the color or contrast. I have seen this shown on HBO, Showtime, etc and it showed well there. I am an old Vet but an even older Scout and I have written this to tell you, unless you just feel like you HAVE to have this movie, don't buy this DVD. It is just not layed down correctly and you will be disappointed.

1905152,5,B0000ADXET,I saw thia on TV and laughed and cried through the whole thing.  It was so good I bought this for my sister.,1376784000,,108,3.6956521739130435
1905153,4,B0000ADXET,I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was a good downhome story with a very good story line. People today can relate to it with so much job loss.,1365033600,,142,4.107142857142857
1905154,4,B0000ADXET,"This movie was in some ways good to experience the despair of the railroad people who find themselves without hope after their jobs were eliminated.  However the era is wrong for me it should be set in the depression era not in the 2000 nd.  Some things are to far fiction for me and some of the people made up in this movie would never lasted on a railroad in real.  It was in all a good story and if you like movies that make big business the bad, mean heartless Villon then this is for you.",1364774400,,493,4.061855670103093
1905155,5,B0000ADXET,"Every movie made cannot be an award winner. I fell in love with the actors in the movie, not the storyline. Look at all the stars that are in this movie, how bad could it be? My top spot was Levon Helm. He's not a Clark Gable, but he doe's a very good job for a rock n roll drummer. How about we just enjoy movies and stop trying to judge them so much. Chill everybody and enjoy life.",1335398400,,384,3.8734177215189876
1905156,5,B0000ADXET,"This is a fun little movie. The cast is terrific, especially Levon Helm, the story is a bit corny, and it has an ambivalent ending. It's a touching story of a group of people that no one cares about trying to do the best for themselves and their families. Your level of enjoyment will probably depend on your own expectations and opinions more than the quality of the movie (as is clear from some of the reviews).",1334793600,,413,4.376623376623376
1905157,5,B0000ADXET,"Although this movie was made in 1987, I find it really applicable to the economic condition of our country today. The movie captures the emotions of the fears people face as they see their jobs replaced by modern technology. At the conclusion you feel good because you get to see heroes rise above their circumstances and see two men fight for their families. Wilford Brimley and Levon Helm capture the spirit of drama with their acting. The movie is funny, serious, sad, happy, and just good entertainment.",1298246400,,507,4.839080459770115
1905158,1,B0000ADXET,"People in a small town lose their Jobs,what is the Leftwinger's and Anarchist's Solution? Shut 'Em Down of Course!
If you condone Terrorism and Hijackings then this is the movie for you! I guess the Film makers wanted to Show ""The Man"" funny they become The Man as most leftists do anyhow, A snore of a movie,slow acting with that guy from the Diabetes commercials and Kevin Bacon. Only thing cool is the Locomotive itself, other than That it's typical ""The Man"" is bad Hogwash. Long Live Corporatism!",1292198400,,501,4.704545454545454
1905159,4,B0000ADXET,"This a great ""feel good"" film.  This film isn't often remembered, but is one that will bring a smile to your face.  Wilford Brimley is terrific.",1198454400,,144,4.5
1905160,4,B0000ADXET,"I believe Wilford Brimley is a great actor because he seems to just be himself.  He plays a brakeman on the ""Southland Railroad"".  The railroad is being reorganized and the small town he lives in will be devastated so some rich folks in Chicago can roll in more ""dough"". He and another worker take a locomotive to Chicago to try and convince the ""powers that be"" to think twice about the reorganization. Instead the company clones try to use them in an advertising campaign to make the changes go smoother.  Brimley won't have it.  You watch the rest.  You have the sad and inevitable conflict of young and old, rich and poor played out in the heartland.  Great film.",1172016000,,667,4.563025210084033
1905161,4,B0000ADXET,This was a very good movie if your into train movies. Although if you know your stuff about railroads you'll find that it has a lot of Hollywood in it. It did have a lot of good railroad shots in it.,1168300800,,199,3.8780487804878048
1905162,1,B0000ADXET,The picture quality is the worst I have seen yet on a DVD. It is worse then a fifth generation VHS. The image is so bad that I don't know why they bothered releasing the DVD.,1082937600,,174,3.861111111111111
1905163,1,B0000ADXET,"End of the line opened in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1987 with Wilford Brimley heading an All Star cast:  Kevin Bacon, Levon Helm, et. al.  I can not believe that this movie was put on film.  The Director, Jay Russell, was filming his first feature film.  The reason this movie was made in and around Little Rock Arkansas was because of the Director and Mary Steenbergon.  Both are from Arkansas.  It is a horrible story, with an awesome cast.  I do not know the politics of movie making, and I don't want to....this movie stinks.",1076803200,,528,4.494736842105263

7996772,5,B0000ADXET,"This is a fun movie to watch that has many well-known actors in it - Kevin Bacon, Wilford Brimley, Holly Hunter, Bob Balaban, Mary Steenburgen, Levon Helm, and many more.  The story, a railroad that is being sold putting people out of work - some of whom have given their whole life to the company, and the efforts of two of the workers - Brimley and Helm - to buy it and put everyone back to work, is an enjoyable old fashioned, heart-warming story.",1474588800,,450,4.357142857142857
