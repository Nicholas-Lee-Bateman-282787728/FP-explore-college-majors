6283924,5,B00IO998U2,"The TARDIS leaves the snow and ice of Earth 5000 a.d. in ""The Ice Warriors"", to land on a sunny Australian beach in 2018 (which was 50 years in the future when this series aired).  What a nice change!  Except they don't get a nice welcome. As a matter of fact, they're shot at - though not before the Doctor dances a jig in the waves in his long underwear.

They are rescued by Astrid, piloting a mini-helicopter, and a bullet grazes her arm. When they get to her home, the Doctor dresses her arm and asks, ""Who are these men? Why are they so determined to kill us?""
Astrid: ""Kill YOU. They hate YOU.""
Doctor: ""Me? I'm the nicest possible person.""
Astrid: ""I should say, they hate the person they think you are. You resemble very closely a man who is determined to be dictator of the world - Salamander!""

Astrid takes Victoria, Jamie and the Doctor to her boss, Giles Kent. Astounded by the Doctor's resemblance to Ramn Salamander, he and Astrid work to recruit the Doctor to join their rebel cause and kill the dictator. Jamie's all for it, but Victoria demurs - just how much do they really know about the situation. The Doctor agrees, telling Kent: ""You and this Salamander are obviously on different sides .... But, which side is good? Which side is bad? And why should I interfere?"" After all, much of the world considers Salamander a hero, working to rid the world of hunger.

The situation is not as simple as it looks and double-cross, red herring and a twist await.

This isn't really a historical Doctor Who, because it's set in an alternate (one hopes) future. There aren't any monsters or aliens (except the Doctor), nor is there any sci-fi based theme (though causing volcanoes is sci-fi, I guess, since we can't do it yet). This is more of a political thriller. Usually this would keep the series from being a 5-star Doctor Who for me. But Patrick Troughton is such fun to watch transmorgify himself from the elfin Doctor into the arrogant dictator - who will come face to face in the end - that I have to go to 4.5 stars, rounded up to 5.

What isn't answered for me is whether or not Ramn's unfortunate last name had a part in transforming him into a bully. Some unkind nicknames when he was a child, perhaps? Some unresolved issues concerning amphibians?

""The Enemy of the World"" originally aired starting December 1967, with six B&W 25-minute episodes. The aspect ratio is 1.33:1; they can't do much with that. The soundtrack has been cleaned and restored to Dolby Digital 2.0, still mono. English subtitles are available. The DVD has only one bonus extra, a trailer for ""The Web of Fear"".

Trivia: The series was so penny-pinching that at one point, a man is captured and kept a prisoner - in a corridor! No prison cell set needed.

""The Enemy of the World"" has been available on itunes since 10/2013. itunes cannot, however, handle the improved VidFIRED production, and the DVD should look better than the itunes version.

On tellytechblog com, I viewed some comparison stills that show the minor difference between the itunes video quality and the Region 2 DVD VidFIRED video of ""The Enemy of the World"". (Region 2 DVD was available in 2013.) The Region 1 and Region 2 DVD quality should be the same.

I'm looking forward to this DVD.

6283925,5,B00IO998U2,"Just finished watching this serial the other day via iTunes. I wasn't expecting much because I haven't heard of this serial, or too much about it before it was found last year in Nigeria, but I was blown away by all the excitement and drama. Patrick Troughton is great as both the Second Doctor and the would be dictator Salamander. This episode has a very different vibe than most other Doctor Who serials, and I wish they dipped into this territory more often. It feels more like a spy thriller than science fiction, and honestly I feel that most of this serial could be remade into some sort of big budget Hollywood movie. I don't know why the BBC is releasing this one on DVD after Web of Fear, because Web of Fear starts exactly where this serial ends. All Doctor Who fans should see this exciting classic episode right away!.",1394496000,39,831,4.509933774834437
6283926,5,B00IO998U2,"I haven't actually seen this DVD yet, nor the completed serial but I am a longtime Doctor Who fan and started watching in the late 70's in the Tom Baker era and have been hooked ever since.
I had previously owned The Beginning set and own Tomb of the Cybermen, The Mind Robber, The Dominators and The War Games. Because of the 50th Anniversary I have taken the last few months to celebrate in my own way and continue purchasing as many classic Doctor Who's as I can. I also bought the Series 1-7 Gift Set on Blu-ray for the new series which was more than worth the $300.00 price tag.
Same here, ANY completed Troughten or Hartnell serials are well worth picking up even if they aren't you're favorite stories making The Enemy of the World a MUST get.
I just ordered The Ice Warrors and loved every second of it, that animation is very nice and fits in the missing episodes and I plan on completing my Troughten collection in the near future with The Invasion, The Krotons, The Seeds of Death and The Web of Fear which is also great.
I've seen The Invasion and it's superb. I had seen little of the 1st Doctor, 2nd Doctor and 3rd Doctors initially and there are few Pertwee stories I really like but I have become a big fan of the 1st & 2nd Doctors and in my opinion some of the surviving stories are just as good and some even better than many in the new series.
I've mainly seen The Enemy of the World with telesnaps and audio so I am really looking forward to getting both The Web of Fear and The Enemy of the World as soon as they are available in the U.S. coming this April and May and looking forward to completing my 2nd Doctor collection of what is currently available.
My top 2nd Doctor suggestions are: Tomb of the Cybermen, The Ice Warriors, The Invasion, The Mind Robber, The Krotons, The Seeds of Death, Enemy of the World, The Web of Fear and The War Games.
My top 1st Doctor suggestions are: AN Unearthly Child, The Daleks, The Aztecs, Planet of Giants, The Keys to Marinus, Dalek Invasion of Earth, The Space Museum, The Romans and The War Machines.",1394496000,6,2064,4.335917312661499
6283927,5,B00IO998U2,"Before anyone asks, I did indeed get this early, as I imported one of the limited (but identical) discs that were allowed for sale in Canada a bit early.

First of all, if you haven't seen this story, it is brilliant. It showcases Pat Troughton's acting chops, as both the hero and the villain. It is action packed, with some great location work and an interesting twist around 2/3 of the way through. It has a 007 or Avengers kind of feel to it, and six episodes fly by rapidly. I was always a fan of the previously sole surviving episode, and the audio of this story. But seeing it from start to finish, it is certainly one of my favorite Troughton serials. If 'Tomb' was slightly disappointing compared to its legacy, in 1991, this story has received the exact opposite effect after it was miraculously found.

The restoration work on the film is superb, especially if you have seen some of the film frames published in DWM, as they were in a state of disrepair. The resolution is a bit higher than the digital release from last year (most noticeable on close ups, texture of clothes and hair). Unlike the digital release, and the botched Region 1 Moonbase disc, this DVD is fully VidFIRED, so the scenes that were originally recorded on video play back looking like video, and not old film.

Very happy to have this one in the collection. Thank you Philip Morris, and the Restoration Team. And thanks to BBC Worldwide for *eventually* giving us this DVD in the US.",1394150400,35,1468,4.553030303030303

The plot has many twists and turns and although it may be a bit slow-moving for modern viewers, is engaging and unpredictable. Nothing is what it seems and a key theme is deception and manipulation. The Doctor is a little marginalized here and his companions and other supporting characters shine. Special mention must go to the diabolical Benik, a fantastic villian who bears a vague resemblance to a youthful Keith Richards. We see plenty of  Patrick Troughton as the Doctor and as Salamander, the would-be saviour of the world.

6283962,4,B00IO998U2,"Definitely one of the more interesting stories of the Troughton era of the series and was well worth watching.

6283969,5,B00IO998U2,"""Doctor Who, Episode 40: Enemy Of The World""
(BBC, 1968/2014)
. . . . .

This was an exciting, politically-oriented adventure episode of Patrick Troughton's run as The Doctor, a legendary ""lost episode"" famously rediscovered in dubbed copies cached away in a West African BBC relay station. All things considered, the restoration looks quite nice, and the goofy, low-budget charm of the original show comes through in all its glory, lo, these decades later.

Even given the stilted dramatic qualities of the old show, this is a gripping adventure, with the Doctor and his companions marooned in a futuristic fascist state led by a dictator named Salamander, who is the identical duplicate of the good Doctor. (And is also played by Troughton, with great gusto and a slightly questionable Latin American accent.) In general the conception and execution of the story are quite good, with several menacing baddies (including Salmander's particularly slimy, sadistic henchman, Benik, played by Milton Johns) as well as several mod lasses in groovy sci-fi outfits that will delight fans of '60s fashion.

A memorable episode, evocative of its time, but also as timeless as a good Doctor Who story should be! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1412035200,5,1241,5.164179104477612

Seeing Patrick Troughton in dual roles is awesome. I realize a lot of fans don't favor this episode, but I love it. The tube Salamander uses to travel to the underground has a creepy scifi feel as well as his fall from the TARDIS hurtling through Time and Space at the end. The only downside to the DVD, and I notice this in some players not all,...they slowed the recording by a few tenths. The object I've heard was a smoother transition from PAL format to NTSC. The opening on some players sounds like it's droning. Hate to say it, but it is very noticeable. But still just happy to see a story I never thought I would see.",1407542400,,797,4.28476821192053

It was SO worth the wait. Patrick Troughton is at his Doctorly best, and also playing the villain, Salamander, a delightfully understated and subtle villain for Doctor Who.

The restoration of the old kinescopes to near pristine video quality is wonderful, and only reason it only gets four out of five stars is a complete lack of extras.

6284005,4,B00IO998U2,"In the Patrick Troughton era of Doctor Who entitled ""Enemy of the World"" first time on DVD and not seen in over 45 years.
  Sometime in the 21st century the Doctor, Jaime and Victoria land the TARDIS on a beach in Austrialia without a care in the world and the Doctor decides to go take a dip in the ocean much to Jaime and Victoria's surpriese.  Of course they are not the only ones who witness this.  A group of men in a hoivercraft watch and think the Doctor is someone else.  Without warning all three of them are being chased or any reason why they have guns pulled on them.
  Meanwhile a woman who tried in vain to stop the men in the hovercar goes to the scene and encounters the Doctor and the others.  She is amazed at the Doctor and who he looks like.  For he resembles a man known to the world as Salamander.  A beneolovent and hard working man who has helped save the world from starvation with the aid  of his device called ""The Sun Collector"".  However outward things seemed right and a man to be trusted.  However there are those that show him as a devious and dangerous man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants.  And he wants the world.  The Doctor not convinced that this Salamander is a madman insists on proof.  So Jaime along with Victoria decide to go undercover and gather the proof they need and hopefully get out of this situation they have become emroiled in.
  Is Salamander as bad as they say?  Could his device be something more then a tool to help the world?  Or is there a far more sinster plot at hand that the Doctor has stumbled into?  You'll just have to check out and see what is in store in ""Enemy of the World"".
  Bit of a side note.  This DVD while great to have for those in the U.S. its a bit dishearting to find this without ANY extra save for a promo for Web of Fear.  And that's not much.  Which of  course the price just doesn't make any sense to me.  And after some digging discovered that the componay resonable for producing such things lost its contract.  So of course instead of doing  it right they just put it out.  So I fear double dipping in the future maybe had.

6284009,5,B00IO998U2,"Even if you haven't heard of this one, it is a thrilling tale without an alien featuring two Patrick Troughtons. This looks like it will be the last in the classic Doctor Who DVD line. I really don't want that to be true. Also, it is not unreasonable to expect a special edition release of this story to include ANY special features (due to the hasty nature of the release, there was no time to film special features for it).",1402099200,,425,4.325
6284010,5,B00IO998U2,"This one as most people know was lost for 45 years.  I wish they could find all the missing episodes of this classic tv show.  They did find a teleplay last month of a early Sean Connery tv play though.  This one is about the doctor impersonating a dictator in the future ,  well our present basically. One reviewer said that there wasn't enough sci fi in this one. Well the story is that a time traveler meets a evil dictator who looks like him and tries to stop him.  Sure there are no monsters but that is science fiction all the way!. Patrick troughton tears it up in this one. Doctor who , as low budget as it was , is always a great show to watch due tot he acting and fun stories. Sure I wish they had found one of the other missing stories first , one like the faceless ones, but I am grateful to see these old shows at all. You can see every episode of the 3-11 doctor of course. But not this incarnation of the doctor. The doctor is the same being he just changes after all. There are no extras , but I can do without extras if it keeps the price down. This series is WAY too expensive.  NO, story should be more than 25.00 ever.  SO I welcome a cheaper price and a restored classic tv show.",1402099200,,1201,4.042194092827004

There is not much science-fiction element to it and although the story line is interesting it does not seem to me to be very believable as acted.",1401494400,2,461,4.310344827586207

However, unlike Cybermen and Dalek episodes which are predictable in the sense that the title tells you what you can expect, I didn't know what to expect out of this story, which was only recently rediscovered. It was amazing: stylish late 60's designs, more simplistic special effects, and an eerie black and white story that often seemed more like classic Twilight Zone than Dr. Who. It really is more about the mystery and suspense than the explosions and shock value. No fancy monsters, just a great story.

The plot doesn't drag like some of the early Doctor Who stories sometimes do. Troughton playing in a dual role, you get to see what a wonderful actor he really is. Maybe some more classic Doctor Who will be unearthed that match this story's caliber. 5 STARS on plot!

If you are looking for any extras, don't hurt yourself trying to find them. There aren't any...unless you count a Coming Soon trailer for a release that is actually already out.

6284020,5,B00IO998U2,"I have been a Doctor Who fan since I was a kid during the third Doctor era and have loved it ever since. By that time, the Doctor had already become a long running English staple much beloved by their children and fans alike. Today this series is one of the most popular British shows of all time that scores repeatedly high on the British ratings charts.
Many of the second Doctor's stories had been destroyed by the BBC's poorly run library program. For a long time, I erroneously believed that the best of Troughton's Doctor had already been recovered, liked enough to be held in private collections and such. After watching this, I feel that some of the absolutely best sci-fi television may be lost to us forever.
'The enemy of the World' had a reputation of being one of the best Doctor Who stories ever produced and I found that this was well justified. Patrick Troughton shows the depth of his acting ability in this story. They use a little grease paint and a totally different hair style to show the villain Salamander's differences to the Doctor's, it was a good thought, but Troughton did such a good job they could have done without them.
Watching this is a must for every Doctor Who fan and time well spent for anyone who likes fantasy and sci-fi. This was an awesome recovery and makes me wonder just how good other such lost classics such as 'The Dalek Masterplan', ""Galaxy Four', and 'The Abominable Snowmen' truly are. Maybe we'll be lucky enough one day and find out. The plot: The Doctor helps foil another villains attempt to take over the world. Check it out.

No bonuses bar a 'Web of Fear' trailer.

This isn't Peter Jackson, this is Doctor Who, x3

Though some people are too greedy with what's now 'commonplace releases', they forget we buy these things mainly to have our favorite shows that exist in better than DVR quality.

6284026,5,B00IO998U2,"If you take Doctor Who and combine it with James Bond and Mad Max, you get ""The Enemy of the World"". Troughton really gets to show off his acting abilities here as he gets to play both the lovable second Doctor and the mad murderous dictator Salamander. It's the near future and the Doctor and his companions, Jamie and Victoria, arrive on a seemingly peaceful Australian beach. But it isn't long before they are being chased and shot at by men in a passing hovercraft. Apparently, the Doctor is the splitting image of Salamander, a man who is determined to take over the world at any cost. Salamander is loved by a great deal of people in the world, creating a new way to mass produce food in large quantities and predicting future natural disasters, but some people know the truth - that Salamander himself has found a way of creating these floods, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions in a mad plan to conquer the world. With his own private police, Salamander manages to kill and discredit anyone who opposes him. Now there's only one hope left - Salamander's Time Lord double, the Doctor.

This adventure really takes ""Doctor Who"" into a new direction. No longer the children's show it use to be, this story has a lot more adult and violent edge to it, even the villains themselves in this story are all human and much more frightening and realistic than any monster. You've got James Bond-like action in it, with high-speed chases, helicopters, gun battles, assassinations, murder, and explosions. I could only imagine the reactions of parents and the censors when these episodes were aired. But this does make a really good adventure with an all-star cast. Directed by the show's future producer Barry Letts, and Troughton playing both the hero and the villain, you can't really go wrong. Missing from the BBC archives for over four decades, this newly found adventure can at long last be enjoyed the way it was meant to be. Highly recommended!",1399939200,,1950,4.769230769230769

8643992,4,B00IO998U2,"For those who are not aware, this serial is more recently restored given that all but one episode was unavailable until 2013. However, the editing seems a bit off, since there are scenes that seem to jump around, and a rather sudden, jolting, ending. An example would be when Jamie and Victoria are attempting to escape from the research station. The scene starts out with them running, and Victoria attempting to block the guards' path with an overturned table. However, before they can get two steps, Jamie and Victoria are suddenly standing in front of Salamander, having been captured, apparently.
Other than that, this is still an excellent story from the early years of Dr. Who which bucks the trend of ""monster of the week"" for something a bit more contemporary and relatable (relatively speaking). And the twist in episode 4 keeps things interesting, though it's not nearly so well exploited.
But be warned! This serial takes place in 2018, so be sure to look out for any Salamanders promising to end world hunger!",1491350400,3,1022,4.879310344827586

However, after hearing about Troughton's masterful performance on the episode from other reviewers, I was a bit disappointed.  First of all, the Doctor just happens to look identical to a man bent on world domination.  Secondly, this dictator was supposed to come from Mexico, but Troughton's fake accent sounded more Eastern European.  It really was pretty sad.
