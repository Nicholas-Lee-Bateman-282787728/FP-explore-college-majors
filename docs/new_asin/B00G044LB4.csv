8619852,5,B00G044LB4,"TGR's Way of Life is an amazing visual feat.  Having watched almost all of their previous films, this film is one of the most visually stunning pieces yet.  As always, their soundtrack is great and there are enough dvd extras to keep you busy after the film is over.  I recommend watching the film on Blu-Ray as it really does add to the experience.

Even if you are not an avid snowboarder, this movie is worth a watch.  I have showed the film to many of my friends who have never seen snow and they were captivated by not only the beautiful shots, but the stunts performed in the film.  I only hope TGR continues to produce films such as Way of Life.",1411430400,,652,4.260162601626016
