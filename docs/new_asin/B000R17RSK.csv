2855884,3,B000R17RSK,"C'mon folks, this little fella's been around since early 60's...  and the basic 3-act drama remains unchanged: introduce villain, villain does dastardly thing and all looks hopeless for our plucky boy robot, and Astro saves the day...  It's a fun, though entirely unimaginative 20 minutes, with many of the same (human) villains cycling thru several episodes each.  The episodes with Astro's little sister - she's a hoot! - are a step up from the more mundane plots.  I sure feel for the actor who voices Astro - I can only imagine how it felt after a day of recording all of those groans, grunts, squeaks, and chipper dialog.",1418515200,,626,4.768518518518518

2855887,5,B000R17RSK,"When I first saw the first 5 episodes I knew I had to have the remaining 26 episodes of the first vol. to see their unique Max Fleischer, early Disney look that Osama Tezuka established with his take on ASTROBOY! Astroboy has Betty Boop's eyes and Popeyes strength! If Betty Boop and Popeye had a Robot son it would be Astroboy! After I watched all the episodes after the first 5 that I watched earlier, I could see how the show's anime can hold up! Astroboy's adventures can stand the test of time because while other anime became slicker, Astroboy remained unique with it's Max Flischer view of the future in the year 2000!

In the first 5 episodes Astroboy is created by Dr. Boyton after a tragic car accident takes his own son's life! While Dr. Boyton brings Astroboy to life while playing Tocatta and Fugue on his equipment he is stymied by his robot son not growing an inch and refuses to accept him which leads to Astroboy's yearning to be like a real boy while defending the humans he has come to protect!

Much of the humor comes from sight gags whether it's the robots comically following themselves hand over foot (literally!) or Astroboy's pulling a starfish off his face and finding his face on the starfish before he puts it back on!(literally!) the gags have that Dave Flischer feel to them that keeps you from taking the adventure too seriously and Fred Ladd, the american producer, keeps the voices translation fresh and funny!  For the most part the picture and sound quality is first rate! Only one episode early in the series with a robot named Colosses had any trouble with the sound, otherwise it was all first rate!

The Black and White episodes are clean and clear with a clear; crisp playback of sound and picture, well worth the price especially at $13.00 for a 1st season of episodes numbering 26 episodes! So get these episodes and I'll get the 2nd season to go with the first!",1409270400,4,1905,4.56140350877193
2855888,5,B000R17RSK,"I had a vague memory of enjoying Astro Boy black and white cartoons in my youth. Surprise,surprise, despite the very crude hand drawn animation there is a lot of humor in the voice characterizations and even the drawings. Equally simple american cartoons of the era are nothing but garbage but Astro Boy rules. Even now, at the age of 62 I find these cartoons to be very amusing and I think I was a little too young to appreciate them fully when I first saw them. True the audio is uneven and the video varies in quality but all in all I think it is worth it.",1402272000,4,559,4.233644859813084
2855889,5,B000R17RSK,"In the early 60's there came to the US through various production companies, the precursors to what has grown into Anime. These productions included Kimba the White Lion, Gigantor, Speed Racer,  and earliest of all, Astroboy. The transfers from what appear to be secondary sources are well done. Although the DVD contains a warning with respect to sound quality, I found that only one episode had problems in that regard. The cartoons themselves are amusing and fun, and occasionally dark for 1960s kid programming in the United States. In any case, the cartoons are enjoyable, and my daughter is already devoted to them.",1375660800,9,621,5.029126213592233

2855935,3,B000R17RSK,"This is an old Japanese cartoon character created around the 1950's and is in the manga series. It involves the creation of an asteroid, who is a machine with human qualities. The graphics in this video is old and lacks the luster of more current cartoons. Still, it had a very good theme and was about twenty minutes long.
My five year old boy found it very entertaining and enjoyable. He watched it twice and would probably stand to watch it again. The ending would lead into more stories in the future. I would recommend this to anyone who is into manga or old Japanese cartoons.",1448496000,,582,4.5
