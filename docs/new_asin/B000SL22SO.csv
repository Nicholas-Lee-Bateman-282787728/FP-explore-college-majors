8205769,2,B000SL22SO,"film q, length, fx, monsters&variety & story-rather lousy. it had pleisiosaur-whatever, kong and t rex is all i can remember. film is way overpriced no matter what and they cut out better younger actor and its extended scene.",1239235200,,225,4.947368421052632
8205770,2,B000SL22SO,"The first time I saw this was as a heavily censored 17 min. bootleg VHS from a sci fi con.
The title ""King Dong"" had been electronically placed over the films original title
with a video editor using something like color separation. The date on the video said 1984
and it had obviously been amateurishly edited by connecting two VCRs together and hitting pause
just before you get t the dirty parts. I have always heard that ""Lost On Adventure Island"" was the original
title and that it contained very hardcore sex from real mainstream amateur actors who were not known
to have done porn before or since. I hope someone puts the uncut one out on DVD. Not because I really
dig porno, but because its a curiosity and I am curious. It will probably end up like Caligula  or a Highlander movie, with six different versions floating around the world and each owned by different people.
The animation is very good in some parts. but the giant gorilla barely even moves. He just shuffles his feet
like Fred Norris. What sticks in my mind mostly about this production is a guy in an otherwise respectable gorilla suit that has ridiculously long forearms. I think I laughed so hard I fell on the floor.
So, at least I know this was released, with some sort of sex scenes, on VHS in 1984 retitled King Dong.
(It still said ""Lost on Adventure Island"" in the end credits, I think.) Anyone know who did the animation.
Jim Danforth and David Allen worked on Flesh Gordon.

The real mystery King Kong spoof movie to locate would be the 70's Swedish porno called ""Sex King- Kong of the Jungle"", or something like that.
It was banned outright because they discovered that the 6 foot blonde twin sisters who starred in the film
were only thirteen when the movie was shot. They turned out to be the daughters of a financier of the film
and the mother was prosecuted.
A lot of banned porn is starting to pop up on the web lately. Like some of Traci Lords early works.
I am not sure how this is possible, unless they are being posted by someone on a boat sailing international waters. But they are out there. Maybe Sex Kong is online somewhere. Maybe theres a censored version you can get ligitmately, but I highly doubt it. Anyone out there speak swedish?
Is ""Yeti- Giant of the Twentieth Century"" available yet?",1236384000,5,2292,4.507211538461538
8205771,2,B000SL22SO,"In my quest to own a full collection of 'Giant Monster' films from Juassic Park to Amazing Colossal Men I was overjoyed to find I could now view this legendary 'porn + fantasy' movie, similar in style to 'Flesh Gordon'.
This re-edited and retitled movie (originaly called King Dong), which now only lasts 40 minutes, gives us a chance to see what you do with just a few dollars for a budget. A couple on fair stop motion dinosaurs and a giant gorilla along with some nice sequences using matt work are quite good to look at.
The acting is mostly poor and post dubbed..But what brings this release down is the dreadful DVD quality which looks as if it's been copied from an old video tape. Great, great pity",1213488000,6,706,4.438461538461539
8205772,3,B000SL22SO,"IMDB says this is the mythical Stop-Motion porn film parody known as King Dong.
After decades of not finding it I suspected the film itself rather than the quality  Stop-Motion creatures it contained was a rumor.
I haven't  received this holy grail yet  so I'm giving it a three based on hearsay .
I 'm not expecting much in terms of plot or acting if the FX don't live up to their now legendary hype I'll lower the rating and update this review

Update:
While not quite at the level of Stop-Motion in Planet of the Dinosaurs ( which was edited into Galaxy of the Dinosaurs some years later) The work is rather good for an obviously low budget film.
If it ever contained any soft or hard core footage it's been edited out of this version.
Can't really say the acting is any worse than Planet or Galaxy and with the shorter running time it's not so hard to sit through.

Recommended over Kinky Kong which sounded like it was going to be a bigger budgeted remake and didn't really work with or without it's unrated footage.",1186876800,,1021,4.409574468085107
