8071895,3,B000A0GYI2,"Here's another of the many fine flashing girls DVDs! It's mostly of girls in their late teens to early 20s, usually topless but occasionally totally in the buff and nothing censored. A considerable number of them are stacked. The setting of most of it is on boats that are docked at a shoreline, although I don't think there are any clues as to where they are. I wish I could find it! There are guys there too, but they're never naked or featured on camera. Good full screen picture quality, with decent camerawork and editing. I like the fact that the sound is all live and doesn't have music added, although sometimes music is going at the site. At one point 3 or 4 of the girls start a strip-tease dance that goes on several minutes, in which they get topless or naked, so that's groovy. This DVD is quite similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wild-Party-Girls-Summer-Madness-Tour/dp/B000A0GYI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wild Party Girls: Summer Madness Tour</a>&nbsp;Volume 1 , but Volume 1 runs about 1 hour 50 minutes, whereas this one runs 59 minutes. The last 12 minutes is 2 different segments of girls naked in showers, although the second one is a repeat of the beginning of a segment that's the highlight of Volume 1. There are not any bonus features. All in all, this is a nice DVD, not as intense and one-on-one as some of the Girls Gone Wild DVDs, but good if you like girls flashing in public.",1367107200,,1458,4.955102040816326
8071896,5,B000A0GYI2,"WILD PARTY GIRLS: SUMMER MADNESS TOUR is a very titillating DVD consisting mostly of girls in their late teens and early 20s flashing in public.  There are several different venues on here, including dance clubs, outdoor parks, and hotel rooms. All the girls are nice looking, some very nice, and a few are super stacked. Usually we're talking topless flashing, but a few girls get totally naked. There's an especially great segment where 3 good-looking girls pose and caress on each other in various places for about 16 minutes, the best place being a long shower scene, and usually they're totally naked.

The run time is very generous at about 1 hour 50 minutes, since most DVDs like this run about 1 hour.  A little bit of that additional time consists of footage that would normally be cut, such as girls dancing in bikinis before they pull their tops off, a couple of short scenes of totally clothed girls talking, and so on, but it's all fun. The camera work and picture quality are quite good, with a full screen image at 1.33:1, and usually there is sufficient lighting. There's very little image manipulation such as special effects, jittery image, and the like, thank goodness, since that's a complaint I've had about some Wild Party Girls DVDs. Sometimes live sound is used, sometimes rock music is added, and sometimes the two are mixed. There are no bonus features on the disc, but considering the long run time there doesn't need to be any bonuses. All in all, this is a very nice DVD.

By the way, 2 other ""Wild Party Girls"" DVDs that I also like a lot are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wild-Party-Girls-Naked-Spring-Break/dp/B004PJIT64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wild Party Girls: Naked Spring Break</a>&nbsp;and also&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wild-Party-Girls-Naked-Boat-Bash/dp/B004PK9HJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wild Party Girls: Naked Boat Bash</a>, though they're not nearly as long as ""Summer Madness Tour.""",1335484800,4,2027,5.61437908496732
