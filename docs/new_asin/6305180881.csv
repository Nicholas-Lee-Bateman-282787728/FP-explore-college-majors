7884824,5,6305180881,I remember this movie from when I was younger and it is still a fun movie to watch.  I purchased because I like Rutger Hauer as well as Powers Booth.  It is really unfortunate that Mr. Booth passed.  I have always like his performances.,1498521600,2,236,4.318181818181818
7884825,3,6305180881,"This movie has an environmnetal message.  Green activists may love it.  It may seem dated as it deals with bald eagles, a species no longer considered endangered.
I bought this to see Powers Boothe's downstairs.  You really don't get to see side with the cool curviture.  He doesn't have his classic mustache either.
This movie stars the guy who played the android who wouldn't die in ""Blade Runner.""  If you think that guy is scary in chase scenes, then you'll like seeing him be scary here too.  He often wears futuristic clothing, even though this is set in modern times.
I thought the child in this film was annoying, but some say working as a child actor is difficult.
Was I blown away by this film? No.  But did I enjoy it enough not to turn it off? Yes.  You may enjoy this decent enough film.",1190246400,2,800,4.431506849315069
