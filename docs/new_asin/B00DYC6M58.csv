8599088,5,B00DYC6M58,"This was such a fun little indie film by a young up-and-coming filmmaker and actor.  I had never heard of Ari Frenkel before watching ""Pluto,"" but the potential behind this cute movie makes me excited to see what's in store for this young man's career as an actor and movie maker.

Full of silly montages and shot in a wide range of styles, ""Pluto"" is a relatable and simple story for any young person who is finding their place in the world in the face of tragedy.  Lots of great laughs and solid performances by Frenkel and his ensemble of actors.

A real stand-out performance from actress Elaine Bromka who you might recognize from the famous John Candy ""Uncle Buck""  !!

Definitely recommend if you're looking to find a gem from a first-time filmmaker who I'm sure we'll see much more from in the years to come.",1379116800,,816,4.517006802721088
