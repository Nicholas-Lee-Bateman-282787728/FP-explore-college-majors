262076,5,6300216918,"I'm just old enough to remember the CB radio craze of the mid 1970's.  Citizens Band is a humorous, but pretty realistic look at that craze.  Before the Internet changed the face of communication and chat rooms took over, we had CB. As this movie shows, you could be anybody behind the CB mic, and reality rarely met the fantasy of the voice on the other end.  You had the good, the bad, and the ugly on CB as this movie shows.",1236643200,5,427,4.182926829268292
262077,4,6300216918,Another rumination on the importance of and difficulties in  communicating with the people who are closest to you.  For which CB radio was the perfect medium in the 1970s.  Paul Lemat is earnest to the point of being irritating.  Candy Clark is pile of confusion and lust.  You have to love them.,1007251200,2,296,4.615384615384615
262078,5,6300216918,"A little over exaggeration, but people really tore down the offenders Antennas!  The 70's had Sex Drugs, and Rock n' Roll, all a microcosm of the Life on C.B.  Many Marriages were broken, and some sprang from C.B.!  A good Movie for any age.",983836800,,241,4.431818181818182
262079,3,6300216918,"Although the characters of the movie are ""amplified"" somewhat,  the movie gives a pretty good idea of how CB had taken hold of the average  citizen in ""bubbaville"" USA. I found it nostalgic, and my only  complaint is that all the radios used for the movie were supplied by Radio  Shack (I was hoping to see some old favorites).  END",904089600,,332,4.466666666666667
262201,5,6300216918,"like this movie. Brings back memories of the 1970s. I was disapointed that the only radios they showed were navahos, I was looking forward to seeing many different classic radios, but only showed the realistic navahos. all in all it was a good movie.",1413072000,2,250,4.704545454545454
262202,5,6300216918,"This film though thoroughly 70's in dress, lingo, and mannerisms captures the whole CB craze that I remember as a kid, surprisingly has not become dated though. The humor is very slapstick and silly but it works and it's a fun exercise throughout  the film to match the more restrained (dull?) everyday personas of the ""The Priest"", ""Papa Thermodyne"", ""Hot Coffee"", ""Spider"", ""Chrome Angel"", ""Red Baron"", ""The Hustler"",  ""Electra"", ""Blood"", and the other voices over the CB bands to the real-life characters as the plot unfolds. The psychology of role-play fantasy and unrestrained persona of the anonymous CB media (which is so similar to the nascent internet chat-rooms in the early 90's) is well and accurately portrayed. Anonymous, that is, until you stomp all over others transmitting on (emergency) channel 9, piss of the REACT boys whom then come with their Radio Direction Finder to triangulate in on your rig(s) & antenna (some of which I sure are amp'ed beyond the FCC 4 Watt limit)....Anyhow without tipping the whole plot, events transpire where all of these real life characters collide into one another in the finale and as they do, realize that they, in-spite of their on-air disputes and warfare, band together in common cause. Paradoxically having had familiarity each other through their CB sets they gel together in a team to overcome the adversity in the end more readily. A great comedy that is appropriate for most ages except for content that may offend some (implied references to prostitution business and some of the Nazi propaganda transmissions) but these are truly tame by current movies standards. A great bellyacher of a movie and great window into an American subculture.",1406160000,,1703,5.078571428571428
262203,5,6300216918,The Citizens Band was an awesome movie!  It helped a non CB-er like me understand my friend's love of cb's.,1400630400,2,107,4.35
262204,5,6300216918,"When I first saw this movie I knew it was destined to become a classic. It is hard to find a copy of this for sale. If you like CB radio, this is an entertaining movie. Perhaps even if you are not into CB you would enjoy this, but I can't say for sure because I am a CB nut! You gotta like a mobie that stars a character named ""Papa Thermodyne!""",1396828800,2,345,3.8055555555555554
262205,4,6300216918,I haven't seen this in years! The last time was at the Drive-in. I'm still into C.B. radio's. Brings back memories of days gone by.,1387497600,2,131,4.28
262206,3,6300216918,"Much of the story is over the top silly bordering on stupid. You had to be there, and if you were, the trip down the nostalgia channel is truly worth it. There's a few of the then-ubiquitous Realistic Navaho radios shown (spelled with an ""h"", not a ""j""), but there is a curious lack of Radio Shack ground planes that were often used with them. Also a few RS 3W walkie talkies. Oh the memories!

This film seems to be set in the period of CB history in the years when it was more regulated, just before the 1977 truckers' strike changed it to the heavily stylized ""Convoy"" type of operating that the service eventually became known for. One subplot is the too-common frustration over channel jammers, especially on the ch 9 emergency frequency. As a result, T-hunting is shown though not explained, as well as the grappling hook and cut coax cures for the truly obnoxious. That was accurate for the time, but I guess the easier method of pinning a coax would have required too much explanation.

Now decades after the fact, it was fun to watch.",1383955200,3,1043,4.5132275132275135

262209,3,6300216918,"I recently came across this on Netflix instant seeing the Rig on the cover and information,then sadly to my disappointment,the ""Rig"" appears briefly, A White Western Star(Just like in the James Brolin Movie Steel Cowboy). And A Wrecker, You have Charles Napier(Trucking Shows Movin' On Tv Series and Bj & the Bear Tv Series,Trucker Movies.) and a Silly even for a Movie plot. If you are looking for CB Action it will not disappoint but Trucking isn't it and the movie to top it all off does not make sense and is boring and long.(reminds me of Smokey and The Hotwire Gang-another CB Type Movie and just as Boring).You have some parts where it seems they just want to make fun of Hillbillies and Of A Priest(A CB Priest).",1307836800,,720,4.589147286821706

7806583,5,6300216918,"I am a little younger than the total CB craze (Smokey & the Bandit, Citizens Band) but when I got my Camaro at age 17 in 1990 you bet I had a CB in it. I also kept a CB in my car until just a couple years ago... and am still wondering if I wanna ruin the lines of my 2013 Malibu with a CB antenna and where the heck I'd mount a giant chrome Cobra 148-GTL anywhere in the front dash!

I originally watched this movie because my all time favorite actor, Paul LeMat (American Graffiti's Milner) was in it. He did well in this movie. He is so good at humanity and human nature - probably a natural trait from all the interviews I've read with him and it is too bad he didn't make more money/climb higher. He'd have been a great Han Solo.

Anyway, the movie feels a bit parody but there was a time one needed a license and the FCC was very serious about the band. Nowadays you can grab a single sideband radio, put power to it and nobody is going to say anything unless you're coming over their cordless phones.

I still have my CB... and I miss it.",1457049600,3,1044,4.009615384615385

7806585,4,6300216918,"Not an academy award winner, but I do agree with others whom have reviewed this by saying that this movie gets as close to how the actual CB radio scene is in America upon how people act, meet, use, and even abuse, the CB radio genre.

7806586,5,6300216918,"I was into the radio back when this was made. Here in Albuquerque, if you didn't have a CB radio, you didn't communicate. Long beofre the days of cel phones, the CB was the king of communication. Interesting that Cb is making a big comeback as well, as it seems to wax and wane about every ten to fifteen years. I am a HAM operator now and have been for almost twenty years and find that the majority of hams started on CB radio. This movie is great, really funny and well directed. The actors many of which you will remember from other great movies like American Grafitti, and a few TV shows as well. The movie chronicles a time long gone that was a super fun and exciting time in my life, and for many others who lived thru it in the 1970s. Excellent movie. I love it. And watch it at least every couple months, it never gets old.",1450396800,2,832,4.173913043478261
