2963452,2,B000W90JT6,"""Curse of Demon Mountain"" is a peculiar film that's tough to pigeonhole. Is it a Civil War drama? Is it a supernatural thriller? Is it a drama about love and betrayal? Yes to all those. Starring Joe Don Baker and Sondra Locke (misspelled on the abysmal packaging this release gets,) there are moments of well-acted drama and long stretched of plodding unscariness. The film opens with an establishing story in the Civil War when Slim Pickens (an alleged star of the film, despite about five minutes of screen time) dies and tells Confederate Captain Wishbone Cutter (Baker) about hidden diamonds in a haunted cave in Arkansas. Evidently much of the budget was spent on obtaining the rights to The Band's ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"" (Robbie Robertson even gets a credit!) Watch the amusing way they make the song relevant through Pickens' character.

The battle scenes in the first part of the film are trying and are generally quite ineffective, but after the war Cutter and a motley band head out to find the diamonds. Along the way they pick up Drusilla (Locke) who famously refuses to get along with Cutter. The middle third of the film features much plodding through the woods, and lots of terrible day for night photography resulting in a blue cast on everything. Not helping matters is the quality of this print which is terrible; likewise the audio is poor, while oddly the curse words are all censored in a twist I was not expecting.

The movie drags frequently with lots of traipsing through the woods (with few dramatic or scary payoffs) and a tale of Demon Mountain's otherworldly possession that will make you pine for the brevity of an Icelandic saga. The cast is winnowed down until the film becomes a Baker versus Locke piece. There is a nice twist ending, which is one of the better moments of the movie though attentive viewers probably already deduced what was going to happen. The ending is swift, unexpected, and wholly unsatisfying. Do not believe the 114 minute running time on the box; this DVD version clocks in at just over 90 minutes, which is still too long. I do not want to see a lengthier cut of this.

""Curse of Demon Mountain"" isn't uniformly bad, it's just intermittently boring and has a few blemishes that are tough to overlook. Adding to the woes are a dreadful DVD in every way, and you can see why the rating is two stars. If you are a Joe Don Baker or Sondra Locke fan it's not to be missed, otherwise it's good for one viewing at the maximum.",1383436800,3,2492,4.633484162895928
2963453,3,B000W90JT6,"I first saw this movie with my older brother on Television in the early eighties. It was called Wishbone Cutter and we had a slight argument over who performed the title song ( he was of the opinion that it was Bob Dylan). My only clear memories from that time were the title song and, of course, Sondra Locke! What a lucky man Clint Eastwood was. The reason that I purchased this was simply because, for some reason, I did not get to see the end and who or what the demon was. So I finally got to see the end.",1357171200,,510,4.0594059405940595

Originally titled, ""Wishbone Cutter"", then ""The Shadow Shikara which came out in VHS back in the late 80's.  Renamed ""The Shadow of Chikara"" and now ""Curse of Demon Mountain"".  The VHS version had no end credits and with the watermark on this version on Amazon, it looks like a distributor bought the rights (probably for DVD).  Much of the continuity has bee horribly edited out for what reason, I don't know.  Because of these horrible edits, the story now is flawed.  The original version when released on VHS had a fluid story line with strong acting from Joe Don Baker and Sondra Locke.  Overall, I like the concept of the story and hats off to the late Charles B.

STRANGELOVE, BLAZING SADDLES), barely survives a battle w/ union forces. Cane is mortally wounded in the struggle, but before he dies he tells his comrades about a fortune in diamonds and where he hid them. As they set out to locate the stones, life becomes very difficult. Someone seems to be stalking them. Along the way, they pick up a woman named Drusilla Wilcox (Sondra Locke- many a Clint Eastwood film).

I enjoyed the actors that were chosen to play the parts,some of them I had not seen on screen in many years and it was nice to see them again.

8221735,3,B000W90JT6,"I've had an odd fascination with this film for years & made some time to see what Amazon had to show for it in their Prime Video stash. Report is so/so: It's the same language censored time compressed TV print found on the assorted low-budget DVD pressings (and found for free at Archive. Org, as the film is considered in the Public Domain). But it is somewhat better looking than the other DVD transfers I've examined, with decent color and passable low resolution picture quality that looks just fine if somewhat dark on my phone.

To expect more of it would be to court frustration which is the result of the star-crossed aftermath of the production. Soundtrack rights to the bizarre use of ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"" could be part of the problem. Also of issue is the troubling ""cliff scene"" where a pair of horses are shown tumbling over the side of said Demon Mountain. Is that for real? And I can understand why those currently responsible for Paramount's legacy aren't in any hurry to do much with the movie. The surviving print was apparently prepared for TV syndication with adult language blipped out and about fifteen minutes of footage removed so it would fit neatly in a 2 hour time slot with commercials. Until someone with the rights feels like messing with the debris this is probably the best way to see what's left of the movie. Too bad, but probably fitting.",1494806400,,1390,4.627530364372469
