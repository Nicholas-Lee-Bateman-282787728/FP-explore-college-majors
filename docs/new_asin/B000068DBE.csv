1723885,4,B000068DBE,"THE ROOKIE asks the rhetorical question ""What red-blooded American boy doesn't dream of pitching in the World Series?"" Well, I may have entertained that fantasy for a fleeting moment. Then, having demonstrated to date no athletic prowess whatsoever, I retrenched behind sissy stuff like books and stamp collecting. THE ROOKIE, ostensibly derived from a true story, brings to the Big Screen the tale of Jim Morris. Young Jim was obsessed with pitching, yet, because of paternal indifference and arm injuries, ended up as a mid-thirties something high school teacher in a West Texas town.
Actor Dennis Quaid does what he does best, i.e. play an eminently likable and audience-sympathetic character, in this case Morris. Besides being the high school chemistry teacher, Morris also coaches the school's lackluster baseball team - always in the shadow of Football (spoken reverentially with a capital ""F"" in Texas). To get his boys motivated, Jim accepts a bargain they propose. He'll attend a professional league tryout session if they win the district finals. Well, the traditional success of such movie themes as ""underdog team does good"" and ""over-the-hill underachiever makes a comeback"" is an indication of how this film plays from the point where Jim discovers that he can still throw a 98 mph fast ball.
My biggest objection to the film is more of a nagging suspicion that the warm and fuzzy tidiness of this Disney production was perhaps not reflected in the reality on which it is based. (""Based"", in the Hollywood make-believe sense, being the operative term here.) Certainly, I doubt Jim's real-life wife Lorri, played here by Rachel Griffiths, was as amenable to her husband's middle-age fantasy as depicted, especially when the family income plummeted. And Brian Cox in the role of Jim's father was particularly wooden. However, in the end, I enjoyed THE ROOKIE more than a little simply because I like Dennis Quaid and still have some residual affection for the National Pastime. My tastes perhaps run to lowbrow, but I'll not apologize.",1017792000,8,2048,5.134730538922156
1723886,5,B000068DBE,"This was a wonderful movie. It's about a man named Jimmy Morris who had a dream of playing pro-baseball. His father is in the army and they are constantly moving. He moves to TExas where there is no baseball, after a while, when he grows up he is a baseball coach in a highschool.
  He is now married and has children. His son his almost like a member of the team even thought he is only around 7, 8, or 9. He has his own uniform and is always at practices and the games. He also has a daughter around the son's age and another son around the age of 1.
  One of the team members discovers how good Jim pitches, he then does it at practice and he makes a deal with the team that if they start winning and win the highest game or something like that, that he has to try out for the major leagues.
  They win and he has to go and try out..........
The rest I won't say, See the movie to find out what happens :). It's a great movie for anyone who ever had a dream that they wanted to accomplish. :)",1017792000,,995,3.95
1723887,4,B000068DBE,"all we know what is going to happen. I was pleasently surprised. All the cliches are pulled out & the stock characters are there but they don't bludgeon you to death with them. Even the smart [aleck] kid is muted & pleasant. Dennis Quaid is very good in the title role. He prepared well & I could actually believe he could pitch a ball 98 mph. Nobody gets killed or laid & the language is ok for kids. It will go to tape quickly & take its place as one of the better baseball movies like ""Bull Durham"" & ""Major Leagues"" only gentler.",1017792000,2,533,4.184466019417476
1723888,5,B000068DBE,"Family entertainment doesn't get much better than ""The Rookie,"" a well-crafted, nicely photographed, and terrifically enjoyable drama about life lessons and moral values. Coming from the makers of ""Remember the Titans,"" and embracing the Disney formula of virtue with every fiber of its being, the film is completely by-the-book, though this sense of familiarity puts one right at home with the material rather than inviting one's cynicism.
The story begins with a basic prologue that serves to set up the fairy tale quality of the movie, which then segues into the life story of Jim Morris, professional baseball player who, as a young boy, dreamed of one day becoming a member of a Major League team. His father, whose work with the military takes his family from Connecticut to Virginia to Florida, and finally Texas, dismisses his son's childhood fantasies. This distanced relationship, as you may have guessed, will come into play later in the film, once Jim's boyhood dreams come true.
But I'm getting ahead of myself here. The film advances to present day, where we see Jim as a high school science teacher and baseball coach in the town of Big Lake, Texas. The school's baseball team, a rag-tag bunch who become inspired when they discover that their coach can throw a baseball at speeds in excess of 90 miles per hour, strike a deal with Jim: if they can get their act together and win the district championship, then he will reward them by trying out for the minors once again.
Yes, the team wins the championship game. Yes, Jim does try out, and finally gets his second chance at playing professional baseball. The movie tosses in some normal elements, such as a nagging subplot involving a job offer at Fort Worth, an injured arm that threatens to overpower Jim, and the family angle, centering on his wife Lorrie's concern for his physical, and emotional, well-being.
As a human drama, ""The Rookie"" is strictly by-the-book. The film's increasingly abundant emotional elements are easily foreseen ahead of time, but they hold true to the formula of self-realization and life achievement. It takes the usual expected twists and turns, finding a comfort zone in its ability to make old plot devices seem fresh and inviting. By the film's ending, I was pleased by the fact that the central message, the old ""follow your dreams"" lesson, was allowed to gently work its way into the audience, rather than being shoved down our throats at the last minute.
In the film's highest favor are its director and characters, who we come to care for as human beings instead of mere lessons on life. John Lee Hancock keeps the film moving at a brisk pace, masking his 129-minute running time with the upbeat feel of his story, and the charisma of the people in it. Dennis Quaid is quite the charmer as Jim Morris, balancing his character's paternal nature and boyhood dreams in a convincing and pleasing manner. There are deep connections established between he and his family, his baseball team, and the townsfolk, those which are make the film's inspirational and uplifting morals ring true.
As I watched the film grow increasingly predictable (and likeable), I was increasingly in awe of its ability to deliver its story in a manner that makes it one of the most pleasing film experiences I've had all year. Normally, I would wonder about a movie that wears its heart on its sleeve, but ""The Rookie"" is that unique home run of a movie that provides entertainment so light-hearted and joyous, that all reservations about its execution are tossed to the dugout.",1017705600,4,3557,4.871287128712871
1723889,5,B000068DBE,"To me, ""The Rookie"" can be considered as one of the finest real-life sports dramas ever made since Disney released ""Remember the Titans"" not too long ago. ""The Rookie"" is a film that gives us a compelling story of what it means to have dreams and how you should follow them. ""The Rookie"" is a film that is nothing short of extraordinary or powerful. The film focuses on the real-life story of Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid), the hero of this story, who has an awesome fastball that would turn heads of almost every major or minor league pitcher everywhere. When he was a kid, he was pressured by his father, Jim, Sr. (Brian Cox), who, to me, wants what's best for his son. Jim always practiced his pitching day in and day out. He always dreamed to be in the Major Leagues one day. Unexpectedly, he had an injury which forced him to give up baseball. In the present day, Jim is a high-school Science teacher and baseball coach. One day, while showing his team, the Owls, one of his trademark fastballs, they come up to Jim, asking him that if they win the finals, then Jim would try out for the Major Leagues. He agrees on it and the plan pretty much worked. On the day of the tryouts, Jim realized that he still had his powerful arm, no injuries and all. And with the support of his wife, Lorri (Rachel Griffiths), Jim gets a shot at the Major Leagues with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. In fact, to me, this is Dennis Quaid's best performance in recent years compared to his 2000 film ""Frequency"". And I think that Quaid is like the Denzel Washington (""Titans"") of this film. And also, ""The Rookie"" provides some comic relief from another talented young actor, Angus T. Jones (""See Spot Run""), who plays Jim's son, Hunter. The performances of the Owls, including Jay Hernandez (""Crazy/Beautiful"") and Chad Lindberg (""The Fast and the Furious""), gave funny and touching performances as well. During the film, Jim comments to his high school team: ""If you don't have dreams, you don't have anything"", and I think that ""The Rookie"" shows you just how far one would go to achieve that lifelong dream. With terrific performances from a top-notch cast and a great storyline, ""The Rookie"" is the greatest Disney film that it has ever been my pleasure to see at the movie theater! A must-see for DVD!",1017705600,,2283,4.557177615571776
1723890,3,B000068DBE,"Disney's effort to make a G-rated drama that adults can enjoy doesn't totally  succeed, but the story of the high school teacher with dreams of playing in the major leagues is nevertheless enjoyable and inspirational.
The biggest drawback of the movie is that if you've seen the previews you can pretty much tell what's going to happen. Also, a number of the characters also are stereotyped, so this film isn't going to win any awards for originality.
In spite of those problems, as well as the fact that Quaid is a bit old for the role, the film does succeed in being uplifting. After all, much of the story is true, even some of the details. It's still fun to see someone defy the odds, and there are some good moral lessons taught in this film as well.  And the kids are cute!
The film is rated G, so there's little here to be offensive (other than some obnoxious product placements). But the rating doesn't automatically mean this film is suitable for kids. Much of the film would be too slow-moving for the little tykes, and children probably aren't going to identify with a high school science teacher. But if you're looking for a pleasant diversion that isn't nearly as hokey as it sounds, this Disney film is worth seeing.",1016496000,14,1230,4.586363636363636
1723891,4,B000068DBE,"The Rookie can probably be considered as one of the great baseball classics in the likes of Field of Dreams and Bull Durham.  Based on the true story of Jim Morris, this is a moving tale of a man who gets a second shot at a life long dream.  Husband and a father of three, Morris is a teacher at Big Lake, Texas, who was playing in the minor league until he hurt his shoulder.  Now he coaches the school's baseball team, and to inspire his players, he makes a deal with them.  If they are able to win the district title, Morris agrees to try out for the major league.
Director John Lee Hancock took his time with the character development, and it pays off as he gives us a tiny glimpse of Morris' childhood, of how much the game of baseball means to him.  Dennis Quaid does an impressive job portraying Morris, I'd even say that he is totally perfect for the role, he is expressive, convincing and the acting just blows me away.  Rachel Griffiths is a good complement as Morris' wife Lorri, supportive and a woman with incredible inner toughness, I also enjoyed her performance.
The Rookie is a great family film, and it's immensely entertaining, I highly recommend it even if you're not a sports fan.",1016323200,35,1201,4.411764705882353
1723892,5,B000068DBE,"I got to see a sneak preview of The Rookie in Dallas.  I was really anticipating the release of this movie for a while, and was hoping it wouldn't [stink] like Pearl Harbor.  Th movie is about a 37 year old man who always dreamed of being a major league pitcher.  Today, he is a science teacher who coached the high school baseball team.  He makes a bet with them: They win State, he tries out for the pros.  They win, and he makes AA minors for D-Rays.  He pitches so well, he makes it to the majors.  The movie i a bit long, but all of it entertains you. Th acting is superb, the settings are very convincing, and the story-telling is very well done.  If you are skeptical of seeing a G rated Disney movie, don't be.  It is no less great to kids than it is adult.",1016323200,4,765,4.046666666666667

1724140,5,B000068DBE,"The Rookie tells the inspiring story of Jim Morris,who became a Major League baseball player at age 35. This film directed by John Lee Hancock narrates two inspiring stories. First,it deals with Jim Morris' stint as a Chemistry teacher and the school's - Big Lake High School - baseball team coach. Then,it provides the story on Jim's road of taking another shot dream of playing in the Major League from the try outs to the pitching his first game as a relief pitcher of the Tampa Bay Blue Rays.

It is apparent that the film has a target audience - young adults - about not giving up on their dreams and about reaching the impossible goals that seems to be far fetched. Despite the fact that there is evidence of sign-posted plots and that the events that follow seem to be predictable to the viewer,it manages to become compelling and interesting due to Dennis Quaid's honest portrayal of Jim Morris. His performance allows us to see through the man who has a not-so-good relationship with his father and someone who felt unfulfilled in his favorite sport after he failed to play in the Majors due to many arm injuries that he has suffered. In addition to that,we also get to see someone who is concerned with his students and his perpetually losing baseball team to achieve greater heights. Finally,we get to see him as a caring father to his kids and a loving husband. These qualities made the viewer cheer for him all throughout the movie.

What's also great about this sports family drama is it features two inspiring stories: Big Lake's winning the district championship and Morris' success on becoming the oldest rookie in the Majors. These stories teach the viewer never to give up; and that working hard and having heart in pursuing one's dream provides a better chance into coming into fruition. These lessons will definitely provide inspiration to the viewer in whatever goals and ambition that he has in mind. In summary,The Rookie is definitely one of the best sports film for the young audience out there.",1435708800,,2021,4.754985754985755

1724154,4,B000068DBE,"I love feel-good, inspirational movies and books of all kinds. And as a kid, I was just crazy about playing baseball. So choosing this movie was an easy pick.

For the most part, I really enjoyed it. I thought Dennis Quaid did a great job in the lead role. He was believable and the kind of character you could relate to and root for, as well. I didn't know the outcome of the story as I watched as I hadn't read the book previously but I was so happy that he did make his dreams come true and that his family was behind him to support him, for the most part.

I'm taking off 1 star as I thought the movie was just a bit too long. Other than that, a worthwhile film and one that makes us all realize that dreams CAN come true, later in life, if we really want them to and work hard to make that happen.

Oh, one more thing...Loved the dreamy quality of the opening scene, that was a great way to grab the viewer's attention right off the bat (no pun intended!) ;-)

Definitely a family type film that you could view with your kids and enjoy again and again.",1435017600,,1057,4.091787439613527

1724229,4,B000068DBE,"Here's a great sports tale, based on a true story, that has all the components - lost opportunities, regret, a broken family, cute kids, a mini-movie about a Bad News Bears-like team, and a dream come true for an unlikely hero! Yay!!

Dennis Quaid is great as Jimmy Morris, who became the oldest rookie major league baseball player at age 35 when he played for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The film covers Jimmy's childhood, his dreams of playing baseball, the constant family moves as his father shifted from job to job within the US military, and then his adulthood - first, as a high school baseball coach, then as a man on a mission to succeed. Each part of the film is sweet and well-made. Quaid plays the part very well, and we see a lot of agony on his twisted face... and occasionally some glee. His wife, who's hardly in the film for the first half, is given some crucial scenes in the second half, and this part sometimes feels a bit forced; but that's more than balanced by a great performance from cute child actor Angus T Jones, playing Morris' son Hunter (Morris' two daughters hardly appear in the film) who just wants to see his dad play in the big game and accidentally says wise things.

The disc comes with some pretty good extras, such as a cool 35-minute documentary on the real Jimmy Morris (and it is here that we realise that Dennis Quaid looks nothing like him), where he discloses his feelings from those years. We also get to meet one of the kids that Morris had coached to championship earlier on, and a 18-minute reel of deleted scenes and director's commentary on why these completed scenes were omitted (even though one of them was the director of photography's career-favorite, and another scene was a favorite of the screenwriter); none of them are spectacular, and some of them are hokey (the inspirational speech in the bus about chopping wood, for example). Most scenes were considered superfluous, and one scene where Jimmy hints as why he thinks he got his full pitching speed back was considered unnecessary as it interfered with peoples' natural tendency to come up with their own explanations for it (which is more fun). The last extra feature is a hokey ""Spring training"" video where the baseball coach from the set puts together a reel of tips for baseball players.",1419552000,2,2305,4.647058823529412

1724363,3,B000068DBE,"Not bad for a Disney film, but not great either. Dennis Quaid plays a real-life high school teacher and baseball coach in West Texas who successfully landed a major league pitching gig for the Tampa Bay Rays after trying out for the team to keep a promise to his players. Like most Disney movies, the film is full of superficial and glib moments, and it's ultimately less moving than it could or should be. Based on the real-life player's memoirs, and filmed not long after the actual events, it is likewise limited by its fidelity to the author's narcissistic self-image. In particular, something rings false about his insistence (as played by Quaid in the movie) that he's playing Major League Baseball to give his own children a hero to admire. Considering that he's basically abandoned his family and high school paycheck to play baseball on the road, it's really hard to see how he's following his dream for anyone other than himself, as his wife and kids get no particular benefit from it -- and his kids are too young to really understand what daddy is doing. But Dennis Quaid is likable in the lead role and his final scene with his emotionally distant father at the film's end is a touching moment in an otherwise trite screenplay.

1724406,5,B000068DBE,"Ernest Hemingway once wrote that the world brakes everyone and that afterwards many grow stronger at the broken places. For minor league pitcher Jim Morris those places were in his arm. He had his promising career derailed by injuries for a precious 12 years. In the interim he went back to school became a teacher, a husband, a father, and baseball coach. On a lark he tried out again for a team. Miraculously his arm had healed and he was throwing smoke; a blazing 98 MPH fastball. At the grand old age of 35 he fulfilled his life long dream of playing in the show.

Writing in a similar vain as many of the themes of this movie, granted about a different sport and certainly arena, the words of novelist Brian DeVido come to mind 'I'd like to [compete] here. Be part of that select group, if only for one night...and I think I'd feel whole for once.' Jim Morris grew stronger at the broken places and was made whole again. Bravo!

The night after watching this movie I had a delicious dream in technicolor that I was pitching on the mound at the old Yankee stadium. It was a night game, the field incandescently lit, the grass a smooth green baize, the upper stands shuddering with the weight of the crowd, the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two men out with Albert Pujols at the plate. Tom Seaver the pitching coach trots out to the hill to confer and he says 'Just give'em the hard stuff kid, just give'em the hard stuff.'",1373068800,,1435,4.411320754716981

To me this movie is about second chances in life, reaching ones full potential and finally, having faith and being blessed by God. I don't know how many times I've watched this movie and still am not bored watching. Plus I live in Texas and appreciate the rural settings. The only thing I dislike is the lack of support from his wife. If it was real life I couldn't help but feel that he made a mistake in getting married to that women. In this movie, the wife acts like the man of the family, which is disturbing and sickening. I will say, the role of the wife, in my opinion, (because I don't know her real life), was NOT based on actual facts but was an attempt to bring the movie to current political standards on female domestic roles.

1724467,4,B000068DBE,"This film tells the true story of Jim Morrison, who got a rare second chance at his dream.  Morrison had wanted to pitch in the major leagues since he was a boy.  But he blew out his shoulder in the minor leagues, which brought an end to his dream.  So Morrison went off to college and ended up teaching at his alma mater in west Texas, where he also coaches the baseball team.  Now approaching middle age with a wife and three children, he seems like the least likely candidate for a shot at a baseball career.  But he goes for it anyway.

This is a heart-warming, family-friendly movie.  Dennis Quaid brings a likeable, everyman quality to the Morrison character.  Rachel Griffiths' performance is equally strong as Lorri Morrison--she is perfectly convincing as a Texan (Griffiths is actually Australian).  The casting director also found some cute kids to play the Morrison children, especially a very young Angus Jones, who plays the oldest.  In the cynical world in which we live, critics might complain that this movie is a bit saccharine.  Well, it is, in a Disney kind of way.  But that's okay.  It is wholesome entertainment for the whole family.

The quality of the blu-ray transfer is excellent.  Crisp details; good colors; great sound.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, it is worth it.

Parental Advisory.  This movie is rated G.  There are a couple of instances of mild language.  In two scenes, characters are seen sipping a beer (but no drunkenness).  In another scene, a married couple is talking in bed.  Her shoulders are bare, but there is no nudity or sexuality.  This is a movie that most parents would feel comfortable showing even to small children.

I highly recommend The Rookie as a movie for the whole family--and not just those who are baseball fans.  This is a human interest story first, and a baseball movie second.",1359936000,2,1859,4.716510903426792

1724515,4,B000068DBE,"""The Rookie"" a 2002 film is a heart warming film that would be perfect to see when you need a pick me up or to enjoy with your family.

In a true story, when Jimmy Morris, Jr. was a young boy, baseball was his one dream, his passion and he excelled at it. It was in his soul and he longed for his father's praise and attention. However, his father was a career military man and had little time for frivlous things like children and baseball.

Being a military family, changing locations is a necessity and fact of life. However, to young Jimmy it meant the loss of friends and leaving a team that he felt he was an important part of.

Eventually, the family moved to a small Texas town that didn't have a baseball team and for young Jimmy, it seemed that a dream would end or have to wait.

The movie moves forward to when Jimmy is now age thirty-nine and the father of three children.  He is a high school chemistry coach and the school's baseball coach. His baseball career ended with an injury to his shoulder and now his dreams are met with coaching.

Jimmy has a difficult time motivating these young boys in a town where football is the only game of importance. Eventually, he pitches batting practice and the team see his skills. The boys ask him why he gave up on his dream and do not accept his reason for giving up due to injury because his batting practice pitching is excellent.

Jimmy and the boys strike a deal. If they are able to win the championship, he will try out for the pros.  It is as if the boys were reborn and life was good. They played well and became highly motivated, winning the championship against one of the only teams that had beaten them earlier.

After this success, Jimmy and his son, Angus, went to a trial for baseball players. Even though he was old enough to be one of the fathers, he pitched amazingly well with his pitch speed reaching over ninety miles per hour.

He makes the minor league team and plays minor league ball while his wife remains at home with the three children, bravely holding down the home while Jimmy follows his dream.

The concept of following your dream is realized when Jimmy is called up to the major leagues. On the first game, most the people in his town come to the game, as does his wife and children and in a heart filled manner, so does his father, at last.

Viewers will enjoy this film and may want to have it in their own libraries to relive the good feel from the story.

1724516,5,B000068DBE,"This movie has always intrigued me since I first saw it on cable several times. It is a true story about a high school coach who, on a bet from his team, at age 35 or there about, tries out for the major leagues. He thought it was just a joke until he actually makes the team as a relief pitcher. It's also more than a ""sports movie"" it's about a family who struggles with the decision to go through with this while barely getting by when he's in AA and AAA ball. The acting is good and quite realistic. The little kid who plays the son practically steals the show. The scene that chokes me up every time is when he makes the call to his wife about the blue sport jacket.
You really need to view this on Blu-Ray. It's beautifully shot (Hey, it's Disney, right?) mostly outdoors in the bright sun. Fantastic.

Also what knocked me out was the DVD extras. There are interviews and footage of the real guy on the mound. Wow, this ""old man"" had an arm! One little thing, the movie character I think was a right hander but the real guy was a lefty and man could he bring the heat. But that really doesn't matter, it's all about the story.

1724519,5,B000068DBE,"I thoroughly enjoyed THE ROOKIE, and there is only a very small handful of sports movies I like.  THE ROOKIE is the true story of an aging, small-town Texas high baseball coach and science teacher names Jim Morris who just happened to have a faster draw than Glenn Ford.  (If you're too young to know who Glenn Ford is then you might need to research the ""Westerns"" section.)

This film is uniquely told with a short prologue that is so unique and creative, that no sports movie director would ever have come up with such a thing.  The film opens and progresses showing the continuous nature of American life through the eyes of a young boy whose dreams are bigger than his feet can carry him.  But not too late in life, his dream and childhood passion is fully realized and the reward for him is timeless, just as the reward for us results an unforgettable and inspiring movie watching.

I might add that this movie is clean family viewing.  You can watch it with you pastor's grandmother in the room and not have to be embarrassed about anything.  (Occasionally, though not very often, Hollywood does something right.)

Another more classic baseball movie that I highly recommend (and also a true story) is THE STRATTON STORY starring Jimmy Stewart, June Allyson, and Frank Morgan.",1260835200,,1283,4.691964285714286

""Field of Dreams"",""The Natural"",and for that matter Kevin Costner's portrayal of Billy Chapel in ""For the Love of the Game"", all have an underlying theme along with ""The Rookie"" and that is the relationship between father and son.

The Rookie fits the mold, as it follows Jim Morris, a pitcher who never made it all the way to play ball, but fell short.  But he got one more chance and was able to make it to the big league.  (In fact I remember rooting for him on the comeback trail when the story developed.)

Dennis Quaid is great as Morris, and you cannothelp but root for him.  The movie is very well done, not being overly melodramatic or too ""rah-rah"" as the story develops to the point where Morris plays on a field of dreams.

This movie does not seem to get mentioned as often as other baseball movies that instantly come to mind, such as Bull Durham or A Field Of Dreams, but it is a very good one and deserves a place in any collection of baseball movies.",1245888000,,874,4.234939759036145
1724534,5,B000068DBE,"There have been hundreds of movies made about baseball:  some forgetable duds, many decent films, and a few all time classics that define how baseball is a reflection of America.  The film `The Rookie' is in this latter category.  It is the true life (although heavily dramatized, I'm sure) story of Jim Morris, a high school teacher and baseball coach in Texas who attended a tryout for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at the urging of his players and eventually made it to the majors for the first time in his mid-30s, an unprecedented event.  The thing that makes this movie great is that it is about more than just baseball, it is about dreams.  Many people dream about doing great things, but it takes courage and determination to actually get up and do it and overcome the fear of failure.  Jimmy Morris always dreamed about playing baseball and spent some time in the minors as a young man, getting hurt and never making it to the major leagues.  His desire to play baseball never left him though, and even after he got married, started a family, and settled down to a regular job, he never forgot his dream.  Unlike most people, he got a second chance to try to do what he loved and he made the most of his opportunity.  Throw in a beautiful, spunky wife (played by Rachel Griffiths) and a complex, unhappy relationship with his father, and you have a great story.  There are so many great scenes in this movie that are so well done and so memorable.  Jim making it to the big leagues is great, of course (I imagine that virtually anyone would be in a daze the first time they sit in a big league dugout).  The best scene of the movie is the one where Jim tosses a ball past a traffic radar to see how fast he is throwing and the reading gives a speed in the high seventies (mph), and as Jim walks away to pick up the ball, the reading changes to a velocity in the high 90s.  All time classic!  People will be watching this 100 years from now.  Is this movie cheesy and over-melodramatic at times?  You bet.  A great family movie?  Absolutely!  It would be great if every American, once in their life, could feel like Jim Morris when he comes out of the bullpen for the first time.  Most of us may never get that chance, but it is great watching Jim do it!",1244678400,,2257,4.328571428571428
1724535,5,B000068DBE,"I love this type of movie because as an older person who once dreamed of pitching major league baseball it tells me that maybe, just maybe, it might still be possible ( with some sort of miracle involved ) that dream is still possible.

1724538,4,B000068DBE,"As an avid baseball fan (maybe too avid) I was somewhat familiar with the Jim Morris story; I even watched him close a few games, and the guy could bring the heat.  But when his story was told in the film THE ROOKIE I stayed away.  Because it was a Disney movie, and because of its G-rating, I was concerned this portrayal would be more bubble gum than can of corn; but when Cal Ripken, a Hall of Fame icon, heartily endorsed THE ROOKIE, I knew I had to check it out.

And I was not disappointed.

Once a promising young talent whose professional career was cut short by injuries and heartache, Jim Morris is a thirtysomething chemistry teacher/baseball coach with three young kids and a mortgage in a dusty west Texas town.  His high school players lack drive and desire--but they do know their coach can throw one mean fastball.  He challenges them to put it all on the line--they make him promise them if they win district he'll try out for a major league team.  The rest, as they say, is history, and Morris's journey from podunk to palace is a delightful and inspirational ride--culminating in his major league debut at The Ballpark in Arlington, Texas (a scene that will put a guaranteed lump in your throat).

Dennis Quaid does an admirable job portraying Morris; he captures the pitcher's determination and ""Aw, shucks"" humility at the same time.  There's a very interesting backstory featuring decades of conflict between Morris and his hard-to-please father (Brian Cox); the resolution of this conflict is yet another poignant scene.  Granted, it is Disney, and the teenagers on the high school baseball team are definitely watered down, yet THE ROOKIE is a feel-good movie for all to enjoy.

Though I know that Disney tends to do what some might call sappy family friendly films when it comes to their sports titles, I find them enjoyable and really like knowing that I can take my family and not worry about foul language and objectionable content on the screen.

The Rookie delivers in much the same way that another of my favorite Disney sports titles does, that being Miracle (which I'm impatiently waiting to see come out on Blu-ray disc).  It (The Rookie) tells the story of a potential sports hero getting his chance to be a hero when the odds are stacked against him.

How could a family man that had his chance at playing organized baseball but unfortunately fell victim to injury wind up becoming one of the oldest rookies in Major League Baseball?  Watch the film and follow the journey of Jim Morris, the real life pitcher whose life was the basis of the movie.

The DVD comes loaded with several nice extras which were carried to the Blu-ray disc as well.  Those extras help flesh out some details in the story and also show more of the real life Jim Morris who is portrayed well here by Dennis Quaid.

I highly recommend this film for family viewing.  The G rating may scare off some hoping for more cursing or some nudity or violence, but this movie shows that a G rated movie can be very enjoyable and entertaining, as well as inspirational.",1204848000,3,1437,4.496153846153846

1724558,5,B000068DBE,"Jim Morris's father (to Jim): ""It's okay to think about what you want to do until it was time to start doing what you were meant to do.""

THE ROOKIE tells the inspirational true story of pitcher Jim Morris, who in 1999 finally made it to major league baseball at the ripe old age of 35. Morris might've only stuck around in the big leagues for 2 years (injuries cropped up), but, give this underdog tremendous props, he was able to realize his life-long dream. Now, to me, THE ROOKIE seems more of a family flick (with some baseball thrown in) rather than specifically a sports movie. Not that it matters. Family flick, sports movie. Listen, it's a must see picture.

SPOILERS alert.

The plot now: Ever since he was a very young boy Jim Morris has loved baseball. Even as his father's military job kept the family constantly on the move, he never lost his passion for the game. At last finding stability in the dusty little oiling town of Big Lake, West Texas, Jim grows up and gets a chance at the minor league, only to succumb to debilitating injuries and forced to give up the sport. For most folks, that'll be the end of the story. Not for Jim Morris.

Cut to many years later. Jim is now a family man, with a loving wife and three wonderful kids. He's a high school science teacher and coach of the high school baseball team, which has only won one game each for the last two seasons. Most times Jim still likes to throw the baseball. Unfathomably he finds himself throwing harder than ever, now throwing heat up to the high 90's, a fact which doesn't go unnoticed by his high school baseball team. The story's turning point comes when, after a particularly lousy game by his high school kids, Jim makes a deal with them. Should they reach the state playoffs, Jim'll try out again for the majors. Well, they do. So he does.

SPOILERS end.

THE ROOKIE may be based on a true story, but, in its warm spirit and longshot underdog-ity, there's almost an element of fantasy here, of a wish realized and a dream achieved. In a way, it reminds me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Field-of-Dreams-Widescreen-Two-Disc-Anniversary-Edition/dp/078322611X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Field of Dreams (Widescreen Two-Disc Anniversary Edition)</a>. Inspirational? Absolutely. Heartwarming. Most definitely. I have nothing negative to say about this film. It teaches lessons in perseverance and sacrifice and faith in family and in yourself. Sure, some of the scenes are contrived, but, guess what, these moments still brought a lump to my throat.

The cast is very good, with a particular nod to Dennis Quaid, who is excellent and warm and keeps the fairy tale aspects mostly grounded. And, y'know, Dennis still has his go-to saucy big grin and his easy charisma. Jim's father tells him: ""It's okay to think about what you want to do until it was time to start doing what you were meant to do."" And Dennis wonderfully conveys the conflict he struggles thru, which stems from discarding practicality and family obligations in order to chase his rainbow. Rachel Griffiths's Lorri Morris gets my vote for most understanding wife of that year.

Special features include: the audio commentary by Dennis Quaid and Director John Lee Hancock; ""The Inspirational Story of Jim Morris"" - a 20 minute featurette spent with the real life Jim Morris as he relives the moments which inspired the film; ""Spring Training"" - the film's baseball coordinator gives tips on pitching, catching, fielding, hitting, and on the proper application of mustard on hot dogs; and 7 deleted scenes (total of almost 18 minutes), each scene with an intro by the director.

Could I make it in baseball?  Obviously, very few do succeed in the quest to make the bigs.  But lots of us wondered.

This movie is actually two movies in one.  First, the local team, with no record of success over the past few years, starts off poorly.  They make a deal with their coach (played by Randy Quaid) that if they win the district championship, he--who had once labored in the vineyards of minor league baseball before calling it quits--would attend a try out and try to attain his dream.  Needless to say, things work out as you would expect.

Then, upon attending a try out, the coach throws harder than he ever did in his earlier minor league efforts.  He goes from a mid-80 MPH fastball when he was younger to a 98 MPH fastball well into his thirties.  Makes one wonder?  However, this movie is based on a real life story; the real Jim Morris (played by Quaid), indeed, got to the major leagues.

Lots of emotional moments.  Baseball afficianados will like this, even if it is formulaic.  Others might not ""get it,"" although it is an affecting movie on several levels (father-Morris as son, husband-wife, Morris as father-son).

One cries with Quaid as he wrestles with his love of pitching and we feel the heart and soul that he puts into teaching and coaching, akin to the same ""giving his all"" to baseball.  Quaid teaches all of us that true greatness isn't found in great success, but rather, in doing one's best at whatever task one is given to do.  Quaid does this and is rewarded not only by success, but by the love and adulation of the many relationships that he has cultivated, even during the times when things weren't going so well for him!",1163030400,3,595,4.201754385964913

The movie is about having dreams and pursing it without quitting which is very important even though there seems to be hurdles along our way. But not quitting should be our motto.

A superb performance by Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths (Six Feet Under).

Baseball is the theme but one could apply the principles of this movie to any dream we've had as a young person. The lesson here is that in spite of obstacles (being stuck in small town America, being discouraged by a parent or family member, having an injury, etc.) one can STILL pursue his or her long-time goal. It's NEVER TOO LATE.

An excellent film to include in one's library and watch it as a reminder that we may BE that someone or we may (heaven forbid) BE that wife or father who could possibly be the deciding factor of whether our loved ones pursue their dreams, even when they are not our own for them.

This movie made me laugh and cry a number of times. Absolutely two thumbs up.

1724571,5,B000068DBE,"Disney's ""The Rookie,"" was a true story based on the life of Jimmy Morris who had inspired to play professional baseball since he was five. Jimmy had always played in little leagues despite the instability of his life as his dad was in the military and they had to move constantly. Finally, they settled down in West Texas. Unfortunately for Jimmy, baseball was not popular at all in that place as football was the main interest of the locals.

From that, the movie soon jumped to the current time whereby Jimmy was the high school science teacher as well as baseball coach. Jimmy had a supportive wife, and three children. His eldest child, Hunter was also very much interested in baseball and looked up to his father as his role model. The high school baseball team that Jimmy was coaching was losing constantly and for the previous two years, they had only won one game in each of the year. Soon, the coach and the players made a bet; if they win the district championship game, their coach should go for a tryout. Sure enough, the team won every game in that season, including the district championship and Jimmy went for a tryout. The rest was history.

I really enjoy the movie a lot as it's extremely inspirational. It deals with a man's dream and the moral of the story is that, no matter how old you are, it's not too late to make your dream come true. In addition to that, the movie also dealt with relationships; the hostile relationship between Jimmy and his father, the relationship between Jimmy and his wife, which was very moving as well as the relationship between Jimmy and his son, Hunter. On top of that, I enjoy the extras that came with the DVD, particularly ""The Inspirational Story,"" whereby we get to meet the real Jimmy Morris, his mother as well as the producers and screenwriter of the movie. It helps to gain a deeper understanding of the movie and just Jimmy himself. A highly recommended movie!",1123718400,5,1925,4.593023255813954

In spite of all obstacles such as age, and family responsibilities Jim Morris still succeeds in following his dreams and managing his personal life.

1724584,5,B000068DBE,"Some people are saying that this story is not realistic.  How can it not be, this is a true story.  Okay, maybe the real Jim Morris could not throw ninety- eight miles per hour but it was still a good story.  One of the most dissapointing but one of my favorite scenes is when Jim stops on the road and decides to throw a baseball past the speed limit indicator.  He first gets like seventy- six miles per hour.  Than when he walks past the speed indicator to go get the ball the seventy-six turns into a ninety-six.  I am guessing the indicator did not work very well and it took a while for it to light up to what he really threw.  I also think it's neat how jim Morris si in a sort of a poor town and he gets to get noticed and still pitch for the majors.  It sure is dissaponting though that he had to be on the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.  That baseball team has been terrible every sibce it started.  They showed Royce Clayton up to bat for the Rangers.  This is in Jim's first games to pitch in the majors.  Royce Clayton does not even play for the Rangers anymore.  I wonder how they got him to be in the movie.  Another great plot and realistic one is when Jim can not seem to fit in with all the younger guys.  He is into different things then the young guys and seems to be the only one who has a wife.  Jim Morris's son is not annoying.  He was a great little actor in this movie.  Another realistic thing in this movie is when Jim comes to pitch and he's got a baby, a little daughter, and a little son.  He has to get the kids to change the diapers while he pitches.  That is so much like life.  Your wife might not be able to take the kids with her and your stuck with them while you have to do something way more important.  The young ballplayers on the team really must have wanted the coach to go to the majors because they made a deal with jim that if they won every game then he would have to pitch for the scouts and if they lost then they would have to run the whole practice that they had.  They won all their games so he had to try out.  He was a pretty good coach for that high school baseball team.  I think anybody should buy this movie.

1724585,5,B000068DBE,"Jim Morris  didn't win the World Series.  He doesn't hold any great records in Major League Baseball.  He won't make it to Cooperstown.  What he did do, and this is the most important thing, is take a second chance on a dream.

""The Rookie"" tells the story of Morris growing up as a military brat, being dragged across the country wherever it needed his father to be.  His dream was to pitch in the big leagues, but injuries, and perhaps a little bad luck, cut his career in the majors short.  He ended up in a little hole-in-the-wall town in Texas(don't all great baseball stories involve a small town?).  He became a teacher and coached the less-than-spectacular high school baseball team.

When the team's catcher asks Morris to pitch to him, Morris starts to realize that whatever cut his dreams short so many years ago is now gone.  With a little coaxing(and a wager with his team), Morris tries out at Angelo State for the Bigs.  He makes it.  The story then follows the ups and downs of being a minor leaguer.  Eventually, though, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays call him up and he is asked to meet the team at The Ballpark in Arlington, home of the Texas Rangers.  There, he fulfills his dream of making it, and the story continues from there.

What makes this story so great is that it has a wonderful message of never giving up set in actual events.  The cinematography of this film accurately captures the emotions that run roughshod over Morris as he attempts to make it to the Show.  My favorite sequence is when he makes it to Arlington and walks up to the ballpark.  If you've ever been to a Rangers game, you know how massive and imposing the Ballpark in Arlington can be.  Imagine walking up to it and knowing you might pitch there that night.  Though Arlington may not have the great history of Yankee Stadium or Fenway, its sheer size is a fearsome thing to experience.  The camera captures this imposing force perfectly.

Overall, a great family-oriented film that will not let you down.

  I heard Jim Morris, who Dennis Quaid protrayed in this movie, interviewed on a national sports-talk program.  One question was if the movie was as it really happened, or if they Hollywoodized it.  Morris mentioned there were two things in the movie that were different from real life.  One was that it took his experiences as a coach at two High Schools, and made it just one High School.  The other is a scene where he throws a ball past a radar detector, to demonstrate his speed and his lack of knowledge of that speed.  In other words, you have what really happened.

  The review in the Indianapolis Star said it followed two major movie cliches.  Who cares?  It was enjoyable to watch as an adult, and it is a movie that children can also enjoy.  And we definitely need more movies like that!

  Back to the movie:  very good supporting cast.  Dennis Quaid is the only name I recognize.

I found this movie very inspiring and touching for a number of reasons.  One ~ it is so heartwarming to see Jim Morris realize he has a second chance at his dream even when he had long since given it up and put his family first.  It is also encouraging to see his family stand behind him despite their own internal concerns and misgivings over the idea of Jim returning to professional baseball.  Whether or not you are a baseball fan; the real story here is about pursuing your dreams and not giving up the part of you that is encompassed in that. If you do; part of you withers away and you just aren't whole.  Dennis Quaid is superb in this movie and it is very suitable viewing for the whole family.

1724588,5,B000068DBE,"This is one of the better baseball movies out there. Dennis Quaid plays Jimmy Morris, who is a high school science teacher who once had a dream of playing baseball. The movie begins with Jimmy being a young boy who moves several times and has a somewhat instable relationship with his father. His father's belief is that sometimes people must do what they have to do to in life, not want what they want to do. While Jimmy believes this, he wants much more out of his childhood and he later gets a chance and trying to live his dream.

We flash forward to many years later, and Jimmy is coaching a high school baseball team that needs motivation. After a lackluster defeat, the team challenges him to pursue his dream of trying out for the majors, and make a pact with him that if they can win the district, then he has to at least try out for minor league baseball.

The great aspect of this film is that is goes much deeper than just being a film about baseball. It delves into what makes us want to pursue our dreams, and the notion that sometimes in life we have a chance to realize an opportunity if there is something or someone to push us in that direction.

Because this is a G rated movie, it is appropriate for everyone.  Definitely a great family movie with a positive message.",1103932800,,1287,4.35

Instead, scenes are shot artistically, there is space between events, the director and writers gave the time and energy to tell the story and tell the story well, and emotional cues aren't yanked one time too many.

 So, the story may be well-known to most but it's a phenomenal one to tell. Based on true life story of Jim Morris, he finds his way to Major League Baseball late in life as a relief pitcher for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays through the encouragement of his High School baseball team. What is really nice is the way the writers took the linear story and added an additional element of history to it. The story goes that in Big Springs, Texas some Nuns early on made a risky financial investment and prayed to the Saint of impossible dreams. Jim Morris's dream may seemed impossible but it is a source of encouragement and inspiration for the rest of us following our dreams.

 Dennis Quaid is quite good in the role and plays Jim Morris faithfully. The setting is a key element in a seemingly run-down town and run-down baseball lot in West Texas...a place that dreams are carried through. It brings Jim Morris to his MLB debut at the Ballpark in Arlington which is good to see an authentic setting with real teams and real players instead of fictitious stand-ins.

1724604,4,B000068DBE,"The Rookie is the real life story of Jim Morris, a science teacher who doubles as the coach of the high school baseball team.  Football is the sport of choice in those parts of Texas, where he lived, so the baseball team has to play on a substandard field with second hand equipment.  He used to be a minor league pitcher with potential, but had to quit due to numerous injuries and a fastball that just wasn't very fast, only in the mid 80 mile per hour range (below average for major league pitchers)
However, when he starts pitching batting practice for his team, he somehow has the ability to throw in the mid to upper 90 mile per hour range.  He has no idea, of course that the pitches are so fast.  He tells the kids that they are not really that fast and that it just seems faster.  The players on the team get used to batting practice against major league fastballs and as a result are able to hit high school pitching easily.
Success has not come easily to this bunch, and after a particularly tough loss, he rallies the team to tell them they can do whatever they want if they only dare to dream.  They respond that he should do the same--that he should try out for a major league team.  He makes a deal with them.  If they win the district championship, he will find an open tryout with some team and show what he can do.  They win, of course, and he goes for the tryout.  This starts a chain of events which eventually leads him to a pitcher's mound in Arlington, Tx and a major league game against the Rangers.
What makes the movie so great is the warmth of the characters and the story.  The story is wonderful, especially because it's basically 100% true.  But Dennis Quaid is great as Jim Morris.  He is believable as a small town teacher who realizes just how lucky he is.  Rachel Griffiths does very well as his wife who has to support him through the low times on the way up the ladder.  The DVD is a nice package.  There are some very good deleted scenes which really round out the story nicely and a 20 minute documentary piece featuring the real Jim Morris who shows exactly what happened when he made his debut on that September night.
Finally, because this is a G rated movie, it will be a favorite among all members of the family.  It is just one of those stories which comes around every few decades.

What makes this story so great is that it really happened, and what makes this DVD so great is that in addition to a great movie it provides you with a short documentary on the real Jim Morris who relives the day he became a big league pitcher.  Also, the screen writer gives you some context about the high school baseball team, revealing that the real reason they were able to win district is that their coach was pitching to them, which means they were essentially practicing against major league pitching and then competing against high school pitching.

Dennis Quaid stars as Jimmy Morris, a high school science teacher who is blessed with a 98 mph fastball.  Jimmy has always loved baseball, but his father was in the military so the family was forced to move around a lot.  Jimmy found it hard to make friends, but he maintained his pitching arm by practicing against a chain link fence.
Years go by, and Jimmy has accepted a job as a science teacher at the local high school, as well as becoming the baseball coach.  The team hasn't been too scucesful recently, but Jimmy is determined to turn them into winners.  A bet is made between the players and Jimmy; If the team advances to the state tournament, Jimmy will go to a tryout with a major league team.  To Jimmy's surprise, the team holds up their end of the bargain.  Jimmy goes to a tryout with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and shows them he can still ""bring the heat"".
A few days later, he receives a call from the Devil Rays' minor league team wanting him to sign.  After discussing things with his wife Lorri (Rachel Griffiths), Jimmy joins the team.  His success continues in the minors, and its not long before he gets called up to the big club.  As fate would have it, Jimmy's first game is in Arlington, Texas against the Texas Rangers.  Many of Jimmy's family and friends are at the game, and he gets in to face one batter, who faces the wrath of Jimmy's fastball.
I'm a huge baseball movie fan, and this rates as one of the best I've seen.  Dennis Quaid actually took lessons from major league pitching coaches in preparation for this role, so his pitching form and delivery are very realistic.

Well one of his kids saw the way he could pith and got the team to make a deal with him, if they won all of there games he would have to try out for the majorers. Well they did and he tryed out, he made it! I can't tell you any more or it would make the movie not as good, but I would tell anyone to see it its that good!",1050537600,,826,3.6988636363636362

1724624,5,B000068DBE,"My daughter talked me into watching ""The Rookie"",. bless her heart!  This movie has it all, humor, dreams, both dashed and fulfilled and, ultimately, a tale of rewarded perseverance.
Dennis Quaid plays Jimmy Morris, a West Texan high school baseball coach whose dreams of a big league career seemed to have floundered on the shoals of injury.
Coaching the chronically under performing Owls, Morris tries to inspire his team to dream of a life beyond their small town horizons.  The team turns the tables by proposing a bargain.  If the Owls win District, Morris agrees to go to a major league tryout.  After the Owls deliver on their side, ""It's your turn, Coach.""  Encumbered by three children, one an infant in a stroller, Morris fulfills his end of the bargain.
I won't ruin it for you, but suffice it to say that Morris confronts the hard choices of doing what he wants to do or doing what he was meant to do.  At the end we are left with a true story of a dream fulfilled.  Great Movie!",1046908800,3,991,4.533707865168539
1724625,5,B000068DBE,"At last, hugely underrated actor Dennis Quaid gets his due respect.  He should have been much more famous long before -- see his Doc in Kevin Costner's ""Wyatt Earp"" -- but the time has come.  Dennis Quaid plays Jim Morris, a major league pitcher who has an amazing story to tell.  And that goes like this:
As a kid living in Texas, Jim Morris was dreaming of one day becoming a baseball player in Major League.  Having a good talent as pitcher, he had been dreaming of making it Major  league player, but now his dream is gone.  Being 35 years-old, and good father of loving family, he now teaches chemstry at a local high school, and is a coach of ragtag baseball team there.  But one deal with the kids -- that if they win the tournament, Jim also tries out for Major League -- reminds him of his old dream that were long forgotten deep in his heart.  The rest of the story is just a miracle.
Baseball rules in Hollywood; and this film turned out an unexpected hit in 2002, and the cast and crew deserve the succuss.  Dennis Quiad brings irresitible charm into the character of Jim Morris (himself appearing as an umpire).  True, the script by Mike Rich (debuted with ""Finding Forrester"") shows nothing particularly new.  But even so, it is remarkable for not making any wrong steps throughout (except, possibly, the opening few minutes including two nuns and flower petals), and the direction of newcomer John Lee Hancock is slick and natural.  Female supporting role played by Rachel Griffiths is, as you find in this genre of baseball flicks, a very typical one, an always supportive and understanding wife, but she does it gracefully, and no one can deny her engaging  presence.
The real story is just a bit different from how the film depicts -- Jim Morris was a player in Minor League before his career as a teacher, for instance, but that part is missing from the film even though the final result is utterly heart-warming.  Don't say that just because this is G-rated Disney film, it is sugar-coated ""feel-good"" nonsense.  The film has actually a good, old-fashioned story that tells us dreams come true, and when you get a good story like this, all you have to do is tell it straight.  And that's the best part of the film.
If you happen to love ""The Rookie,"" see some other films like ""The Natural"", ""The Stratton Story"", and  ""The Pride of the Yankees.""  Even if you don't like the team, you will like Jimmy and Gary, all-American heroes.",1046563200,,2451,4.5697940503432495
1724626,4,B000068DBE,"The story of Jim Morris couldn't be more inspirational. A near 40 year old high school science teacher/baseball coach who makes a bet with his team that if they win a playoff game then he will try out for a major league team. Well needless to say, Morris' high school team wins the championship and the players all tell him ""it's your turn coach"". Jim goes to try out for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays with his 3 small children with him and without his wife knowing. Well, Jim winds up throwing harder than he ever has in his life, 98 mph! Jim is now faced with the gut wrenching decision of having to leave his family that he adores or pursue his dreams. The Rookie plays out way too sappy for me, there are an abundance of overly sentimental moments in the film that for continuity's sake should have been sped up. But hey we're talking a G rated Disney film, here! Anyway, baseball fans and fans of the underdog alike will love this film. Recommended.",1046390400,,949,4.367231638418079
1724627,5,B000068DBE,"Watching the trailer, this movie appeared to be nothing more than the typical feel good sports movie in which a bad baseball team decides to start winning and the coach makes good on a promise. Ive seen that movie before. This time, it is a true story, and that makes all the difference. Jimmy Morris was a high school teacher in Texas, and he also coached the baseball team. Years ago, Morris was drafted by the Brewers, but his pitching arm gave out and he had to let go of his dream. His baseball team has won one game for each of the past 3 years. They lost their first two games of this season. Normally when Morris throws batting practice, he only lobs the ball in there so as to not damage his arm any more. The teams catcher convinced Morris to throw a couple hard. He does, and it looked good to the team. The team makes a deal with Morris, if they win the District Championship he has to go to a Major League tryout. They do and he does. He is throwing 97-98 Miles Per Hour, faster than when he was drafted by the Brewers. The feel good story is that Morris actually makes it to play for the Devil Rays for two seasons, as a 38 year old rookie. We all know that hell make it, but the beauty of this movie is in watching it unfold.
The Rookie could easily have been a 90 minute movie with the focus on the high school team winning the games for the coach and in the quest to make it back in baseball. Instead, Disney does something surprising with this one. The movie clocks in over 2 hours and is a comfortably paced movie. We get to have a feel for who Jimmy Morris is, and what baseball truly meant to him. We see the family dynamic and how it is affected by the life of a ballplayer on the road. Surprisingly, we also get to watch more of Morris pitching in the minor leagues. That aspect could easily have been glossed over, but it wasnt.
Dennis Quaid as Jimmy Morris is perfect casting. He is believable in his role and not once did anything feel wrong or out of place. The acting was superb and overall, The Rookie was one of the most underrated movies of this past year.",1046044800,,2087,4.181141439205955
1724628,5,B000068DBE,"Don't be scared off by the family rating and the Disney name.  This is a solid film for everyone to enjoy.  Quaid is, as usual, in fine form.
The film is the true story of Jim Morris, a small-town high school teacher who gets a second chance to play professional baseball, albeit at an unusually advanced age.
For baseball non-fans, don't sweat it.  The film is really about family and courage to chase dreams.
And I DARE YOU not to get choked up during the scene when Morris calls home to tell his 8 year old baseball-loving and Dad-worshiping son that Dad just got called up to the Big Leagues!
Again, don't think that just because this is a ""G"" rated Disney film that it is a sappy kiddie movie.  Remember, one of David Lynch's best films was ""The Straight Story"" which was, you guessed it, rated ""G"".",1045958400,,804,4.412162162162162

1724630,5,B000068DBE,"This is the best G rated film I've seen in a long time. Unfortunately, in this day a G rating often means a show for children. The most successful of these are children's films that provide a second level of entertainment for their parents (such as the many Muppets movies).
In ""The Rookie"" this is reversed. We have an inspiring film with mature themes that has something to entertain and inspire the kids as well. Sadly the term ""mature"" has been reduced to include themes that would include ""immature"" in my opinion, but that's another story. Here the mature themes are about father-son relationships (both directions), about responsibility, about motivation, and about pursuing your dreams, even after it seems like it's too late.
Many people who are parents (or grandparents) have had to set their dreams aside for one reason or another. But often those dreams are still smoldering, waiting for an opportunity be rekindled. In this case, the dream is about becoming a major league pitcher. But it could be almost anything.
Enjoy this film, with your kids or grandkids. Be inspired! And continue to dream those dreams. They might still come true!",1041465600,,1150,4.93298969072165
1724631,1,B000068DBE,"Can somebody please tell me exactly what was good about this movie? For one, it has to be the most boring movie I've ever had the displeasure to waiste over 2 hours of my life on(and I'll never get those two hours of my life back, either!). I knew enough about this movie just knowing that an older guy pitched in the majors for two years! There, now you know all you need to know, too. Everything else in this movie in just absolute NONESENSE and NOT at all important to the story. Which seemed to drag on, on and on! Dennis Quaid was okay, but I can't figure out why his character never seemed happy about all the doors that are opening up for him. He never said thank you to anyone, in fact, he almost seemed ungrateful and like he just didn't care! His wife and son also seemed to almost not give a care, too! He finally makes it to the majors and his son says, ""I don't believe it"". I expected his son to say, ""I knew you could do it"" instead the kid acted like he just didn't care. With all of their bad acting and stupid one liners it just made me NOT CARE, too! Oh, can we talk about stupid. Every time he threw the ball there was this rediculous special effect dubbed in to make it sound like the ball was going at some kind of a ""SUPERSONIC"" speed. GIVE ME A BIG-FAT STICKING BREAK. ""Stupid is, is stupid does!"" and the highschool kids he coached...give me another break! Disney expects me to believe the kids would speak and care about the coach the way these kids did? Kids these days are so self-centered, there's no way their dialog is believable. One kid said it all when he said, ""Non of us are getting a scholarship, so what's the point"". That was believable, in fact, that was the most believable line in the whole movie. These kids just wouldn't have given a care about this coach like this movie portays. Now, I believe this older guy made it to the majors(facts are facts), I just don't believe the dialog happened the way it is portrayed in this SuperSNOOZER of a movie. If that is the way it happened, Disney did a lousey job recreating it. I'd give this movie a ""0"" if I could, but I can't, so I'll just urge you NOT to waiste your valuable time. Hey, I like ""FEEL GOOD"" movies, I'm just not sure why I'm suppose to ""feel good"" watching this one. To know that an older man pitched in the majors for two seasons(Oh...and he pitched for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays), is really all you need to know. For a ""True Story"" this movie is pointless. It never grabbed me and it never made me feel like I should even care! To say it was very dissapointing would be an understatement.
There is so many interesting things that happen in real life, everyday, I can't believe they waisted all that money and time on this lackluster story! Now, go do something that is interesting and worth your time! In fact, starring at the wall or coloring in a Teletubbies coloring book with Krayola Crayons would be more interesting than this BOREFEST called a movie! Have I made myself clear? This movie is a SuperSNOOZER...YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!",1041206400,4,3038,4.322241681260945
1724632,5,B000068DBE,"I had heard of this unlikely rookie when he made it to the Devil Rays in 1999.  When his story came out as a movie, I was interested in the TV previews, and it indicated that the movie might be a good one.  Understand, that I am very conservative when it comes to movies.  I can't remember the last time I went to a movie theater, and usually I walk right past the video/DVD section in stores because I consider so much of it just junk.  The Rookie is NOT junk.  I feel that it is a good family movie.  It's not a sports story, but a story about relationships with people - family members, members of the community and co-workers/students.  Baseball just happens to be the medium used as a story line.
If you are looking for an action-packed sports action movie, keep looking.  But if you are a conservative viewer looking for a good clean family movie, then you have found it.  I heard only one four-letter word not in our family's vocabulary, and saw one very brief scene I felt didn't belong.
The extra material found in the DVD including an interview with the real Jim Morris further explains his story, and vouches that the movie is pretty accurate.

Count your blessings as this one's a true story with regular, live-action people in it. I open with that because I'm thinking maybe the cynics who are still attacking the sentimental edge of this film aren't fully realizing that the film hasn't been ""Disneyfied"" in any way. It *is* a family friendly autobiography about an adult who gets the proverbial break. But how much tunnel vision have we adapted in this country in regard to family films? ""Rookie's"" director John Lee Hancock even comments (on the DVD) on the enigmatic reaction he got when his film had to be rated by the MPAA. No one was more surprised than he that they gave it a G rating, considering that it includes, among other things, father-son dysfunction and a spotlight on an adult character rather than a talking dog or alien. It's relatively straightforward and even spotlights a corps of baseball playing teens who are more mature and subdued than in most films of this genre. (These are the film's best scenes: Dennis Quaid and the quartet of students who encourage him to come out of retirement and dream again.) I think it is a winning, sublime, magical little film that can bring a smile to just about anyone's face.",1040601600,3,1292,4.746666666666667
1724634,5,B000068DBE,"Sometimes a movie comes along that from the very first reel you just know will grab you on a human interest level.  THE ROOKIE is the story of high school chemistry teacher Jim Morris, who in the short space of three months goes from tossing beaker tubes to hurling baseballs for the major league Tampa Bay Devils.  What makes this movie noteworthy is what it chose not to be.  Dennis Quaid, as Jim Morris, could have played him as a diamond version of ROCKY II, with all the hoopla and music of that film.  Instead, what you get is a traditional feel good movie minus the irritating schmaltz.
The first half of the movie is more interesting than the latter half which details Morris' rapid climb from double A ball to the big show.  You see Morris as a little leaguer who lives only to play ball.  In this youthful Morris, you also see both Lou Gherig swatting baseballs through a grocer's window and just about every kid who has dreamed of playing major league pro ball.  There is also a carefully structured subtext of a father's need to play the heavy just to earn money to put bread on the table.  Morris' father has to continually move his family from state to state, with each time resulting in continuing disappointment for a boy who wants only to stay in one place long enough to finish a season with the same team.  This same theme that troubled his father early on returns to haunt the adult Morris, who finds that he has to make a similar decision concerning himself about whether he should surrender his dream of baseball and take a badly needed job of teaching or he should keep his dream even if his family suffers.  It is this battle of a good man wrestling with his conscience that makes THE ROOKIE resonate with a charm that has not been seen in any sports movie for a long time.  The baseball scenes detailing his high school winning streak that causes him to try out for the major leagues and his own duels on the mound are both thrilling and inspirational.  Yet, nowhere in the film does even one pitch not ring true.  Dennis Quaid plays Morris in the sort of low key manner that Gary Cooper as Lou Gherig or Jimmy Stewart as Monty Stratton showed in earlier decades.  Unlike Cooper or Stewart, Quaid permits himself the luxury of doubt, which in turn makes the ending even more of a treat.  The ROOKIE proves once again that success in life is not measured by the payoff of a dream but rather in having had that dream in the first place.",1039910400,,2459,4.421286031042128

1724636,3,B000068DBE,"When women feel the need for a good cry at the movies, they usually seek out some tragic tale of unrequited love to do the trick.  When men feel the same need, they turn to a film about baseball.  And what could be more guaranteed to convert a grown man into a shamelessly blubbering fool than a true-life account of a middle-aged baseball fanatic who gets to fulfill his lifelong dream of playing in the major leagues?  How many men can fail to identify with that?  Indeed, most men may not want to admit this, but the baseball movie genre has, in many ways, become the male equivalent of that category of film known, derisively by many men, as the chick flick, for they both serve roughly the same purpose.  Apparently, even we stoic males have the need to clear out the tear ducts every now and then - for purely medical reasons of course.
Because baseball has long enjoyed the reputation of being Americas National Pastime, moviemakers have often treated it less as a sport than as an iconic institution.  From Pride of the Yankees to Brians Song to Bang the Drum Slowly to The Natural to Field of Dreams, movies about baseball have been so concerned with all the mythic implications of the sport that they have rarely managed to convey the sense of carefree fun that comes along with it (Bull Durham has been one of the few obvious exceptions to this rule).  The tone in these films is sometimes so sentimental and so reverential that one begins to view baseball more as a type of pseudo religion - with the stadium functioning as a sort of temple where people gather to participate in a communal spiritual experience - than as a form of entertainment.
The Rookie certainly falls into this category, yet the film itself has such an air of comforting familiarity about it that it manages to override much of the conventionality of the storyline.  Although we always know where the movie is headed, the easy assuredness with which it charts its course keeps us interested and absorbed for most of the duration.  The majority of the credit goes to Dennis Quaid who, as Jim Morris, the high-school-teacher-turned-big-league-ballplayer, does a first rate job portraying a man torn between responsibility to his family and this golden, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of realizing a childhood dream.  Quaid underplays the role so nicely that we never doubt for a moment the authenticity of all we are seeing on screen.  The screenplay by Mike Rich, though filled with overly familiar scenes and characters, nevertheless manages to avoid many of the potential lapses into overwrought melodrama that could conceivably have robbed it of much of its credibility (the dark hints early on in the film as to Morris problematic physical condition happily never come to fruition).  Director John Lee Hancock establishes an almost elegiac tone, pacing the film in such a way as to match the unhectic lifestyle of both Morris and the small Texas town in which he lives.
The Rookie, like Disneys previous sports opus Remember the Titans, eschews violence, sexuality and bad language completely, thereby garnering the film a G rating and making it first class entertainment for the entire family.  There may be nothing much new in it for adults, but The Rookie has the skill to make what was old seem somehow new again.

There was no cohesion in the film and I wondered if the team's success would have been a better movie all by itself. This movie did nothing for me.",1037145600,2,437,4.407407407407407

No sense in re-hashing what the movie was about....by now, everyone knows. Suffice to say that Dennis Quaid was perfect for the role of Morris and played him so well as a man needing just one more shot at his dream. Rachel Griffiths, one of my favorite actresses, does a good job as Morris' understanding wife. I miss seeing her in ""big"" roles since she became part of the series ""Six Feet Under"" which obviously does not leave her much time for films.
The movie captures us because it is about people we can like, has good actors, and the characters are trying to reach their goals. Viewers can connect with this. I also liked that Quaid did not play Morris as a man whose life would be incomplete if he did not have one more shot at success. He played this man as a content individual who, when given an opportunity to re-make his history, takes it with some reluctance.

As is well known to baseball fans, at age 35 Jim Morris became one of the oldest rookies in recent history to break into the major leagues when he became a relief pitcher with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. (Several players from the Negro Leagues were older when the color line in the majors was finally broken.) This is his story.
Due to bad luck and arm surgery, Jim had given up on his dreams and was teaching and coaching high school ball in Texas but continued to throw because he loved the game. He was also married with three small children. As motivation to his team, he agreed that if they fulfilled their dream of making the state playoffs after several losing seasons in a town where football was king, he would go to tryout camp one more time. Much to his amazement, they turned their season around;  he tried out, threw the ball at 98 MPH despite the disbelief of the professional scouts, and as they say, the rest is history.
Dennis Quaid is perfect as Morris, and Rachel Griffiths conveys her ambivalence at seeing her husband put his life on hold and leave his family to ride around the country on minor league busses despite his father's advice that it was time to get on with his life rather than pursue his dream. The high school kids and townspeople are all memorable characters who become as familiar as our neighbors during the movie, and Morris' son is a real scene stealer.
Finally the pace of the movie is appropriate to the sport, rather than being hurried the story is allowed to unfold in the same enjoyable way a game can be watched on a sunny afternoon (even the grass on the field has a place in the story). Thus, the suspense is not about what will eventually happen, but rather how it happens. You get to enjoy watching the character development and the many interesting incidents that lend color to the story along the way. And the pitching sequences are vintage baseball for the true fans.
I saw this several times in the theatre. The DVD has additional material, including comments by the real Jim Morris. While it is enjoyable even on a screen as small as those at airline seats, I recommend  watching it on as large a TV screen as possible because the baseball scenes themselves are much more lifelike.",1033948800,2,2397,4.508045977011494
1724656,4,B000068DBE,"Dennis Quaid turns in yet another fine performance (I've yet to see him turn in a stinker) as Jim Morris in this biopic that has a lot of heart, a lot of humor, and some moments that are genuinely moving as a result both of the director's restraint and of the performances by Quaid and Australian actress Rachel Griffiths, who seems, like Quaid, genetically unable to turn in anything less than her best. In this film, she is utterly authentic as a Texan, and offers a believably conflicted portrayal of a wife who wants more for her family but also doesn't have the heart or conscience to deprive her husband of a second chance at the major leagues in baseball.
This is one of the year's ""nicer"" films, in that it doesn't beat up the audience with the points it wants to make but, rather, assumes that the general public has functioning intelligence; so we're allowed to determine the subtext for ourselves.
British actor Brian Cox (the best Hannibal ever; see Manhunter) turns in a solid performance as Quaid's military father; the supporting cast is uniformly good. Overall, this is a film that leaves you feeling satisfied--not all gooey over false sentiment, but glad to know that every now and then someone who deserves it actually has his/her dream come true.

1724657,4,B000068DBE,"As someone who loves films and baseball, this film was a mixed bag for me.  As a human interest story it is excellent, but as a baseball story it is somewhat of a disappointment.  It is a very upbeat tale of Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid), a high school science teacher who rediscovers his fastball at the age of 35 and tries out for the major leagues.  The story mixes together his personal quest and that of the high school baseball team he coaches, both of which overcome incredible odds to achieve near impossible feats.
As a baseball story, Jim Morris is really nothing more than an interesting footnote in baseball history.  There are far more compelling baseball stories to be told, like Tommy John who came back from reconstructive surgery to pitch another 14 seasons (that were some of his best), or Jim Abbott who was born without a right hand and pitched in the major leagues for ten years, pitching a no hitter against Cleveland in 1993.  Morris only played for Tampa Bay for parts of two seasons, pitching a total of 15 innings with a 4.80 ERA and almost as many walks as strikeouts.  Still, it is pretty inspirational that he made it to the majors at all given his age.
This film plays well on Main Street, where regular folks are reminded of the faded fantasies of their youth.  It strikes a chord because to root for Morris is to root for their long abandoned dreams.  Director John Lee Hancock does a fine job of bringing out the best in the human story, although the sports components are marginal.
There are just too many instances of unrealistic baseball in this film.  For instance, Morris is repeatedly shown throwing as hard as he can with absolutely no warm-up.  Any little leaguer can tell you that you will blow out your arm if you do that.  This is especially unrealistic given the fact that Morris had surgery on that shoulder when he was younger.  Unless he was plain stupid, he would warm up before he attempted to throw flat out.
As an athlete, Quaid is not terribly convincing, with pitching mechanics that are far short of professional caliber.  Kevin Costner was much more credible in ""For Love of the Game"", though that film lacked the story of this one.
From an acting perspective Dennis Quaid is marvelous in the lead.  This is one of the best performances of his career.  He is convincing as the high school coach pushing his kids to reach for their dreams and maximize their potential.  His chemistry with the young cast is terrific.  However, in the pursuit of his own dream, he is even better.  This is a complex and nuanced performance showing Morris as filled with desire and self doubt.  Quaid's portrayal of his determination in the face of his own insecurity is phenomenally insightful and compelling.  Rachel Griffiths and Brian Cox give splendid performances and Morris' wife and father.
This is a wonderful feel-good film that is great for the whole family.  I've been a little hard on it because I'm a long time baseball fanatic, but the human interest story is so well done and Quaid's performance so compelling that I have to give it at least an 8/10.  This is a film that everyone can enjoy, regardless of whether you love sports.",1033516800,3,3178,4.617437722419929
1724658,4,B000068DBE,"Dennis Quaid's likeablity raises this from an average movie to an enjoyable one.
The story is predictable and there are few surprises.  The performances seem unchallenging, in the sense that the actors could (and just about did) sleepwalk through their parts.  And on an odd filmmaking note you wonder whether they were strapped for cash in making the movie because in most of the scenes that involve him coaching a high-school team he apparently only has about 5 players, which comes off as kind of strange.
Nevertheless it's a ""phoned-in"" feel-good movie that rises just a little above mind-candy.",1032739200,2,599,5.040404040404041

A truly great film for quality family time and family values!
Summary:
The Rookie is an instant baseball classic and a great G-rated movie that is truly enjoyable for the entire family.
The story line is well developed, the script well written, the film well made, and the DVD supports a wonderfully great Director's Commentary by John Lee Hancock and Dennis Quaid.  This commentary gives good insight into the Jim Morris story, how it was brought to the big screen as well as interesting personal insights into both Hancock and Quaid and their personal inspiration from Jim Morris as they made this film.
I cannot recommend this DVD enough!
Story:
Jim Morris is areal life baseball lover whose prime and purpose came long after his retirement!
On a dare, he takes a shot at the ""show"" and gets drafted to the major league where he had a short, but successful pitching career.  Jim proves that nothing comes easy, and we don't necessarily know what our ""purpose"" is in life, until it comes upon us.  Sometimes a child's wide-eyed dream can propel his father to greatness!
G-Rating:
Nothing was cut or manipulated to make this rating.  The story is wholesome and immensely entertaining!",1032739200,3,1187,4.832512315270936
1724660,3,B000068DBE,"Great story, Great actors, but boring. I was really let down when watching this film. I thought Dennis Quaid was very emotional and the kids that played his children were fun.

1724661,4,B000068DBE,"""The Rookie"" is a rather fictionalized account of the life of Jim Morris, whose promising career in minor league baseball was quashed by a shoulder injury in the 80s. He then became a high school science teacher and baseball coach in a small Texas town. Several years later, he tried out for major league team and became the oldest rookie in baseball in forty years. Morris played for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for several seasons.
This unabashedly sentimental movie piles on the cliches - dreaming the impossible dream, turning the ragtag high school team into state champions, dealing with the wife who is supportive but worries about how the family will survive, etc. Still, the movie manages to be a rousing crowd-pleaser and has the distinction of being a genuine, old-fashioned family film. Rated `G', it manages to prove once more that, from time to time, a movie can be entertaining for all age groups without the use of foul language, violence, gross-out jokes and/or lots of exposed flesh. [I state this as a fact, not as any kind of moral judgment.]
Key to the success of the movie is a dynamite performance by Dennis Quaid as Morris. He is so intense and believable that some of the script's sillier plot devices can be overlooked. Rachael Griffith is quite good as the wife, Lorri Morris, although the role doesn't utilize many of this enormously gifted actress's talents.",1031184000,,1384,4.819327731092437

The portrayal of Jimmy Morris by Dennis Quaid is tremendous and certainly his best work in 10 years. Many films claim to be based on a true story and venture far away from the facts. This film follows the true story very closely. If you have ever had dreams as a child you will immediately respond to this outstanding film. I guarantee you will ride an emotional rollercoster throughout this wonderful movie and in the end it will make you think long and hard about giving one more try to that little something that has been gnawing at you for many years. I have viewed this film at least 10 times and I can't get enough. Thanks to Jim Morris for giving himself another chance and sharing his story with the rest of the world.

1724677,5,B000068DBE,"This movie is based on the true story of Jimmy Morris, who had a lifelong dream of becoming a major league baseball pitcher.  In flashbacks the movie shows that while he was growing up, Jimmy would get involved in a team just in time for his family to move, as they followed his career-military father.  Added to this was his father's tacit disapproval of his son's dreams of a baseball career.  Jimmy continued to play until a serious injury sidelined him, and he became a teacher and coach in the small Texas town of Big Lake.  As the movie switches to the present time, Jimmy's team is not doing well until he challenges them to dig deep and feel free to dream.  They, in turn, challege him to make another try at professional baseball.  Rather sheepishly he tries out, while ignoring jibes about his age.

1724680,5,B000068DBE,"A No-No is a pitcher's dream:  he throws nothing but strikes and not one of the opposing players earns a hit.  The real-life story of Jim Morris, high school science teacher turned Major League Baseball relief pitcher, made all the sports news in 1999.  Fans of baseball will remember the story at the time and the humble man that took the pitcher's mound that night in the Texas Rangers stadium against Royce Clayton.  Disney, scriptwriter Mike Rich, director John Lee Hancock and Dennis Quaid all combine forces to tell the story of Jim Morris' challenge to the high school baseball team he coached to follow their dreams, and of that team's deal with him to attempt to follow his own.
Dennis Quaid is all-around one of the best, finest, and most natural actors around.  Quaid possesses a James Stewart kind of calm, quiet personality with his on-screen presence, but at the same time can play over-the-top roles such as Jerry Lee Lewis and Doc Holliday.  He easily carries a role laced with humor, suspense, or sadness, and his performance in THE ROOKIE is one of his most outstanding.  Mike Rich also wrote FINDING FORRESTER, which starred Sean Connery in a heart-warming role, and was extremely well-suited to find the essence of this story.  Director John Lee Hancock had done movies and television that included TV series FALCONE, L. A. DOCTORS, and wrote Kevin Costner's A PERFECT WORLD.
From the opening montage of scenes depicting young Jimmy Morris' struggles to remain part of a team and play baseball in spite of his Navy father's constant movement to other posts, the viewer is grabbed by the simple emotional struggle that is pitched by the movie.  How does a man balance his dreams against the reality of trying to get by every day?  What does that man do if those dreams come roaring back in his face and refuses to die?  The first half of the movie is devoted to the wager Jim Morris made as coach to the Big Lake Owls:  that if they would win District he would try out for a pro baseball team.  Dennis Quaid's performance as Morris is absolutely flawless; his ingratiating charm and easy-going manner reels in the audience.  Angus T. Jones' part as Jim's son Hunter balances the love of baseball between man and boy, providing sharp counterpoints between what was and what is against what could be.  Rachel Griffiths' portrayal of Jim's wife Lorri also balances the acting and touches the hearts of the viewer as she is torn between wanting her husband to be a man who realizes the limitations of life and the woman who wants to see her husband have the chance to be a boy again.  The musical score that drives the whole movies is simply awesome.  When the characters or the dialogue doesn't pull at a viewer's heartstrings or render a feel-good moment, the music does.  Added to that is the 20-minute documentary included on the DVD that covers Jim Morris' story and the history of how the movie deal came together.
The only thing that was really lacking was a brief overview of Jim's limited career in the Minors back in his twenties.  Perhaps it wasn't necessary to the overall story, but since his childhood was played out on-screen, that part of his life might have been mentioned and made a little clearer.
THE ROOKIE is one of Disney's finest movies.  It reaches out and touches the heart, mind, and imagination of every viewer who has ever played baseball and wondered those magic words, ""What if?""  The story makes real the moments mothers, fathers, siblings, grandparents, and friends have sat in the bleachers and watched a young boy or man take his position out in the field and hope that was a catch, a hit, or a pitch that would give him the chance to shine for a brief, flickering instant.  For lovers of baseball, for people looking for a film to share with the family on a lazy evening, for Dennis Quaid fans, this DVD delivers one of the best.",1030579200,5,3880,4.658357771260997
1724691,5,B000068DBE,"Dennis Quaid totally owns this story of the real life Jim Morris.  A truly inspirational story that I wasn't aware of until I actually saw the movie.  The fact that it seems to have happened almost exactly as the movie portrays it makes it even more amazing.  Dennis does his best job of ""keeping it real"" in the movie.  I'm sure he had many opportunities to really go for the dramatic way of doing things, but he is totally grounded in real life.  He avoids that trap by making us believe that this guy could really be your next door neighbor.  Even though it's Quaid's show, the rest of the cast do a great job supporting him.  It's a safe bet that the movie wouldn't have been halfway entertaining without them.  Rachel Griffith as his wife is outstanding.  Their kids are scene stealers and you just have to love the high school team he coaches, along with some of his pals from around town.  Brian Cox puts in a good turn as the taciturn father, who in his sons eyes, could give a spit about his dreams.  But Cox plays the role in such a way, you can see that it's not all there is to it.  There is a sadness underneath at having to put up such a stern front.
The story itself could have turned into a cliche riddled piece of ""movie of the week"" tripe, but there are things that keep it from such.  First, of course, is all the fine acting.  Second is the fact that it's almost as if there's two stories going on.  The first with Jim coaching his kids, then him going for his dreams.  You can tell this film is a labor of love from all involved.  It shows on screen.  The people making this movie truly cared for the story.  One of the best things about this movie is that it works more than just a baseball movie.  It's a great character piece, about following dreams and the love of family.  Sounds corny, I know, but when pulled off right, it's the stuff of coolness.  I believe that even if you don't like baseball that much, you'll find something here that's up your alley.  John Lee Hancock's direction flows in a nice, Texas like pace.  It's not in your face, it simply lets the story unfold, and I appreciate Hancock for doing this.  He's showed restraint when many filmmakers of today would edit this baby to bits, so kudos to him.  You've made this Texas boy proud.
If you want other reasons this is a truly wonderful movie, simply start up the commentary with John Lee Hancock and Dennis Quaid.  They point out several moments that make this movie special.  You can tell they're real proud of their work.  Dennis goes as far as to say that it's his favorite movie he's ever been in, so that has to tell you something.  Some other good comments on what went on with the hows and whys of making the movie.
There's seven deleted scenes that are of good enough quality that they could have been in the movie itself.  But, as director Hancock points out, the main reason most of them were taken out was due to time restraints.  So, it's nice to see them on the disc for all to enjoy.
A neat little Spring Training feature gives you some usefull tips on playing the game of baseball.  This is great for people like me, who haven't the slightest idea of how to play the sport properly.  Whenever I play it (with friends), it's a simple matter of swinging at the pitches.  This has some interesting techniques and tips for the ignorant.
Last, and certainly not least, is a 20 minute documentary on the man himself, Jim Morris.  It features interviews with him, the cast, some of his family and kids he coached.  A fairly inspiring feature in it's own right, you finish watching it totally understanding why one would want to make a movie on his life.  Plus, it gives us info the movie didn't really, such as the fact that Morris wasn't such a bad football player, either.
All in all, I do believe this movie will go down as a classic when all is said and done.  It has all the makings of one, and it's one I enjoy more each time I watch it.  It will truly make you want to chase your dreams.",1030492800,7,3999,4.301204819277109

Quaid did an expert job of bringing this story home. Very believable performance. We are Devil Rays fans, so this one had to be true to life for us. We were already familiar with the background....
The story is about a former big leaguer that is benched due to injuries. It goes into how baseball is his biggest passion. Even through all the upheavels of his life while he was growing up. He always kept the dream alive. After the big league, he settles down to raise a family in a small town in Texas. He is science teacher and baseball coach at the local high school.
Somehow (I won't say how) the team discovers his past and challenges him to give it another try. He takes the challenge and makes it to the big time.
Enough of that...  It's also a story of a boy growing into a man, a man trying to make amends to his grown son about the failure of being there for him. A wife and family being there to help make the tough decisions. A town that believes in the dream. Friendship. Love. Sportsmanship. Team.

But in spirit it resembles no movie so much as ""Breaking Away,"" the first big hit of ""Rookie"" star Dennis Quaid. This film shows the value of holding fast to your dreams, and celebrates the love and support of small-town people for each other. ""The Rookie"" tells the true story of Morris, a Texas high-school baseball coach and minor-league washout who--at an age when most ball players retire--miraculously develops a smoking major-league fastball. The first half of the movie, in which Quaid coaches his team of teenagers to the district championship, has charm and humor, but it isn't until the second half that it really takes off, as Morris finally gets to live his dream as a major-league pitcher. Director John Lee Hancock makes us feel the remarkable, fairy-tale force of what is happening to Morris, and Quaid gives a moving, quietly powerful performance as a man who can barely believe his good fortune. Matching Quaid is Rachel Griffiths as his loving, resilient wife. ""The Rookie"" is a family film, and yet the emotions it explores--the joy at getting a second chance at your dreams, and the mature love of a man and woman for each other--are entirely adult.",1021334400,3,1345,4.9035087719298245

1724711,5,B000068DBE,"The Rookie asks you that question that you have heard over and over. Which American boy has never dreamed of pitching in the 7th game of the World Series? Not very many you can bet.
This movie brings a real-life story to the Big Screen about Jim Morris (played by Dennis Quaid), a young Texan-boy who was obsessed with baseball as a young boy. During his childhood he moved nearly half a dozen times before finding a home in Big Lake, Texas, but when they moved Jim's father (played by Brain Cox) forgets to bring along his glove and baseball socks which were left in Florida. As the years go by Jim pitches through the rain, snow, wind and rain while trying to fulfill his Major League dream. He gets his chance after being drafted after one year of college in 1980. Jim's dream failed after he retired after spending nearly 10 years in the Minor Leagues. Then Jim becomes a chemistry teacher and a baseball coach at the local High School in Big Lake. The baseball team, the Owls had struggled in the last 3 seasons winning a total of 3 games and had lost their first two games of the season by being blown-out by several runs. For motivation Morris agrees to try out for a big-league team if his team wins the District championship and makes it to State. Then they start winning.....17 in a row to win the District Championship. Jim keeps his part of the deal and tries out for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Jim threw a dozen pitches in a row 98 miles per hour. The scout called the Devil Rays and they couldn't believe a man of his age could throw so fast. Finally Morris made it to the Majors. His first game would be in Arlington, Texas against the Rangers. Morris was brought into the game after Tampa fell behind by several runs in the middle innings. Jim strikes out his first batter he ever faced.. Jim went on to pitch 2 more years in the Majors.
The only problem of this movie is you can tell the  fuzzy feeling of Disney movies is in there. I doubt that in reality Morris' wife supported him to try to make the Majors while she had to take care of 3 young children alone while the family's income plummeted.
The Morale of this movie is believe in yourself because anything can happen.

1724712,5,B000068DBE,"This show was brought to my attention by a young man who reviews movies, and unfortunately I didn't hear his name, but saw him when he was being interviewed, telling how exciting it was to be invited to appear on Jay Leno and David Letterman's shows. While I missed his appearances, I was intrigued by his passion for reviewing movies, from such a young age, and went to see it at his suggestion. My husband, of many years, couldn't believe what he heard as I suggested we see this movie. We were not disappointed! My husband really liked it and mentioned that if we hadn't known it was based on a true story we never would have believed it! This is what I saw...that when we have a dream and things go ""awry,"" it only takes seeing ""what lies ahead"" with new eyes, that let us see with total clarity..and in that clarity ""The Rookie""... by helping other young men reach their potential and giving of his Self...keeps the Spirit of baseball alive and God likes that and smiles... and then allows miracles and magic to happen, as the love he gives is returned back to him, because that is how Spirit works! This is a wonderfully uplifting movie...enjoy.",1019692800,,1151,4.511961722488039

I cannot remember the last time I found a movie that I enjoyed this much.  We need more movies like this!!!  Hollwood, wake up!!",1019606400,3,255,4.361702127659575
1724714,4,B000068DBE,"I liked this film on many levels, I just can't see a kid sitting through the last hour of it!  It is a wonderful story of self-discovery and coming to terms with acceptance, approval, and being true to yourself.  But the film  is also slow and thoughtful by adult standards, I just don't think it really made it for audiences both young and old.",1019433600,,345,4.359375

1724716,5,B000068DBE,"Jim Morris is a man of courage and determination who failed to let adversity stand in the way of his dreams.  He had grown up with an overpowering desire to make it to the major leagues as a pitcher and was good enough to be drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers.  After making it to the Double A professional ranks he sustained an arm injury that put him out of baseball.
Years later, at age 35, Morris was teaching chemistry in a Texas high school and coaching the baseball team.  His first dream was to see a team with a previously woeful record win the district championship.  When his players respond to his message and achieve success they lobby assertively for him to practice what he preached to them in his own baseball career.  Seeing his burning fastball on display, they urge him to return to the game and make a solid bid to acquire a place on a major league roster.
Morris' spirited quest ultimately results in a spot on the American League roster of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.  The pumped up Morris, who was able to throw at a speed of around 87 miles an hour before he threw his arm out, was able to reach an impressively lofty figure of 98 miles an hour at 35.  In most baseball careers the opposite occurs with pitchers chalking up higher marks in their twenties, then sustaining their careers on control and an assortment of pitches.  Morris caps his herculean quest by being called in from the bullpen to pitch against the Texas Rangers in Arlington, where he strikes out his rival on four pitches with his blazing 98 mile an hour fastball.
While ""The Rookie"" should entertain baseball fans, its inspirational message of triumphing over adversity is universal, making it a film like ""Pride of the Yankees"" and ""Field of Dreams"" that moves considerably beyond any sports film genre.  It is all about people interacting in the pursuit of goals, never ceasing until ultimate triumph is achieved.",1019088000,,1906,4.615384615384615
1724717,5,B000068DBE,"this movie goes to prove that a movie without cursing, nudity, murder,bloodshed can be made & enjoyed by all. I really enjoyed this movie & for sure will see it again.",1018915200,2,167,4.419354838709677
1724718,4,B000068DBE,"What can I say?  This is another wholesome film from Disney that teaches kids not to be afraid to dream a dream and -- with any luck and a lot of support from friends and family -- to try to live that dream.  Sometimes, life throws you curveballs that prevent you from pursuing that dream, but it doesn't mean that it's impossible.  It just means you have to adjust your swing to hit it.  In the film, Dennis Quaid has a dream to make it to the big leagues again (after an accident that left him injured when he was younger).  But without the support and help of the high school team he coaches, his supportive wife and children, it would've been impossible.
To me, it also reinforced the idea that if you care about others and treat them with respect, they cannot help but feel the need to reciprocate.  Caring and respect are contagious.
Bring the whole family to enjoy this film.
LEAP rating (each out of 5):
============================
L (Language) - 3 (the kids had more interesting things to say than the adults)
E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a)
A (Action) - 2 (lots of baseball games and fastballs)
P (Plot) - 3 (it's a Disney film, they all live happily ever after)",1018742400,5,1163,4.411214953271028
1724729,4,B000068DBE,"This movie is good but it could've been five stars. Disney was the right people to make this film. Some of the pitching scenes were way too long. I got sick of waiting for the scene to be over, not that I didn't like this movie.",1018656000,,228,3.9782608695652173
1724730,5,B000068DBE,"My husband and I truly enjoyed this movie.  It was real life, the struggles and the triumphs and it wasn't manufactured--it was about a real person.  Bravo Disney--please make more movies like this one!",1018569600,,202,4.911764705882353
1724731,5,B000068DBE,"I wasn't sure what to expect from a G rated movie and almost opted out of seeing it because of that.  I'm certainly glad I decided to view it anyway.  This is a great movie.  The story is good, the acting fantastic, as usual for Dennis Quaid and just a clean family film.  I was very impressed with the plot and how drawn into the film I was and certainly didn't miss the smuck and language that usually accompanies films of this type.  Another great one from Dreamworks Productions.",1018569600,,483,4.382022471910112
1724732,5,B000068DBE,"I don't have much admiration of Disney, and I'm not a baseball fan. Starting with that disadvantage, this movie had a lot of catching up to do. The advertisements and previews pretty much tell the whole story... old guy takes a run at the major leagues. How much of a movie can you make out of that slim outline?
In truth, this movie is so well acted, so carefully written and so deftly directed that it is a pure pleasure for even a chronically cynical adult. I could quibble about the blatant product placement (which the movie pokes fun at in one place... watch for it!) and the country music (probably necessary for a movie about Texas) but I still loved The Rookie. No getting around it... this movie works like a fine Swiss watch.
Highly recommended for all ages. The Rookie is one of the better movies of the year so far.",1018396800,2,828,4.4183006535947715

It was a wholesome movie, good for all ages.  It was based on a true story which made it all that much better.  Here's a great guy, who teaching great kids, not foul mouthed like I hear so much of coming out of the mouths of kids everywhere, in the malls, on the streets, in the movie theatres.
This teacher loves his wife, his kids and baseball, and in that order.  And the director or whoever hire the lead knew what he was doing.  We just don't see enough of Dennis Quaid.  He is the very best actor on the scene today.  You guys out there in Movieland.  Let's see more movies like this and much,much more of Dennis Quaid.",1018224000,5,761,4.157534246575342
1724734,5,B000068DBE,"The best movie I have seen in years.  It's not just another sports movie.  This one transcends multiple levels to make it an outstanding, must-see movie.  The direction is superb with surprising yet appropriate scoring.  Believability is where most sports-topic movies fail.  Not this one.  The casting and acting make each character so realistic that you feel every emotion.",1018051200,,375,5.271186440677966
1724735,4,B000068DBE,"Dennis Quaid stars in the new Disney baseball flick as Jim Morris. Jim has loved baseball all his life, but when he was younger he was forced to move from place to place because of his father's job. Jim's father always thought that there were more important things to be done than baseball. Therefore, Jim had to leave before each baseball season was over. But, finally they settled in Big Lake,Texas. Unfortunately, there are no baseball leagues there.

Now Jim is all grown up, and he is now a science and baseball coach for Big Lake High School. Jim finds out what a good arm he has for pitching, but do to a former injury, he decides not to do anything about his fast arm. Now the highschool team makes a deal with Jim: If the high school team wins the district championship game, Jim has to try out for the big leagues.
Overall, I thought this movie was pretty good. It made you feel good. The thing I liked about it most was that it was actually based on a true story. If you are looking for a nice family movie to see on a weekend, I highly recommend this.",1018051200,2,1063,4.288557213930348
