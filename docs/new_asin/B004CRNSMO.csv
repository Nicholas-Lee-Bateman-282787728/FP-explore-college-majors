Very much like the old movies you may have seen at some semi-sleazy art theater.

8423452,4,B004CRNSMO,"[SCHOOLGIRL REPORT, VOL. 3 UNCUT -(1971)]- Another volume in the Deutschland 'docudrama' sexploitation series popular back in the day, that's part cautionary tale used to cloak the sensational sexual sagas of young girls and boys at a Christian high school during the free-lovin' early 70's.  It involves a new sexual education manual published and distributed to aid youths to understand and enjoy a healthy sex life. But how responsible can you expect these hormone and testosterone enraged (read: horny) kids to be?

For fans of that time period, it's a great retro-echo of bygone erotica laden with young, nubile Euro-nymphs who can't wait to undress for our enjoyment and amusement. This uncut version has more bush than a botanical garden, more flesh than a fat farm and less down-time than a Nascar pit-stop. The comely lasses each tell ribald tales of their first sexual encounters, or something unusual that transpired during a tryst, and it features more full frontal female nudity than most softcore cinema from this era. Surprisingly, the mandatory girl/girl scenes that are so prolific in these films are absent from this one, not that you'd notice with all the other lewd lechery in abundance.

The shocks here exist not so much from the nudity and scenarios on display, though the flesh flows frequently and copiously, but from the pre-PC values that prevailed in those days that would keep you behind locked bars for the rest of your life in today's world. The craziness comes from the fact that the youths are exploited, cajoled and manipulated (though some times, it's the other way around) by those whose care, safety and supervision they are entrusted - teachers, fathers, bosses, older cousins and aunts - it's pretty creepy. And pretty fascinating (I ain't saying it's right, I'm just sayin').Most scenes involve underage girls with men two to three times their age, and not many Europeans found this shocking.  And most of the time, parents are fingered for the blame of these indiscretions whether they knew about them or not! Even the pseudo-interviews by the man-on-the-street-with-a-microphone produce some shocking answers from those questioned from all walks of life. The liberalism (before this word became the incarnation of evil by Fox News and the GOP) that was leftover from the late 60's that lingered throughout most of the 70's was astonishing when compared to what's considered acceptable by today's standards. (And, in spite of the PC regulations and new laws imposed since those days, still go on with the same vigor and savage regularity).

If you're going to indulge in this freulein-filled flesh-feast, then by all means grab this uncut version - not only is it half the price, it's a lot more risqu and has much more bushland to explore - you'll feel like Dr. Livingston on safari. (If one isn't available on Amazon, go to the exploited cinema site to procure one - ask for Lonnie or Tony, they're great guys to deal with). I'm giving the 'Schoolgirl Report #3' a solid A- on it's reportcard - if you don't agree, please see me after class...",1294099200,4,3086,4.9728682170542635
