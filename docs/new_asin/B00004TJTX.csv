7922817,2,B00004TJTX,"As an avid fan of the great barrister and owner of the entire series, I was excited to find another episode not included in the collection.  Alas, the unique humor, style, dialogue and overall feel of the Rumpole series was painfully absent in this episode.  I can see now why this one was not included in the complete series package and I feel somewhat cheated.  However, I am extremely grateful that the remaining 30 or so episodes were entirely different and an absolute treat to view many times over.",1225843200,,504,4.640449438202247
