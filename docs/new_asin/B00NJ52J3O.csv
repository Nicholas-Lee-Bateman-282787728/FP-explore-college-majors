8678589,4,B00NJ52J3O,"Great series, entertaining story. I would have liked to have had the option of subtitles even had they been in Spanish. I wish Caracol and other producers of Spanish speaking television would make an effort to include captioning. So this is for Spanish speakers only. I don't know much about the real life of Helenita Vargas, but I do enjoy her music. After a few episodes this series draws you in much the way any good novela would. So I don't know how much is biographical, and how much is pure fiction. It doesn't matter. I really enjoy it. I'm a little more than halfway through the nine discs. So far this has been a pretty clean, interesting story. A nice alternative to some of the other novelas which deal with typical themes of sex, drug trafficking, etc. Also, it has been interesting to learn about what was going on in Colombia in the 50s to the 70s, or so, when this takes place. I didn't think I was particularly a fan of ranchera music, but I always liked Helenita Vargas. So those not familiar with her will get a sort of musical education as well.",1420329600,3,1064,4.433673469387755
