1880064,1,B000096I9S,"That about says it all put the name Jess Franco and you'll know  your in for either a dull time or a weird time. His exploitation films like Ilsa the Wicked Warden and others are fun to watch  because he at least is able to work around some plot and action  with shameless nudity to keep the viewer interested.

This movie has none of it!!!!  Also don't get fooled by the other reviews praising this mess, it's a badly acted, badly directed movie that puts the talents of Christopher Lee to shame. This is one of those type of movies that good actors tend to forget about because they stand as a bad stain (See Al Pacino in ""Cruising""). There is nothing historical here except another log entry into the bad movie cinema with Mystery Science Theater 3000.

Some trademarks of Franco's ahem ""filmmaking"" skills are  leaving the camera in one place while the action happens  outside of it, bad editing, horrible lighting skills, and  basically the inability to deliver one effective scene  after another. That is about obvious in this nightmare  called ""The Castle of Fu-Manchu"". Some scenes are poorly

lit or just plain dark (when they're not supposed to be!!!""

The plot about Fu controlling the oceans to rule the world  is just plain stupid and idiotic and should have been shot  down in the film meetings. Idiotically enough Franco  thought they we're good ideas and made the movie anyways.  The one part that was fun was seeing Fu's Henchman storm  a castle and kill of the guards of a wealthy european.

The other parts in the movie were less interesting, although  the actress who plays his Asian daughter is really hot. There  is nothing to write home about here though. The acting  is laughable even by Mr. Christopher Lee himself, and some

of his goons with the Shriner hats just look like idiots.

This is a bad movie that only MST3K lovers will see. This isn't  a ""cult film"" because to be classified as that it would have  to have some value and this movie does not have any value. Franco will be remembered as one of the most mediocre European directors ever. His venture to direct horror movies seems more like an exercise into comedy and he can't even begin to be in the same league as Ruggero Deodata or Lucio Fulci.",1144281600,2,2234,4.578282828282828
1880065,1,B000096I9S,"Even lovers of bad movies will hate this one because it's not even fun to laugh at -- unless you count the scene in which you're inadvertently looking up someone's nose while they deliver some long diatribe that's supposed to be important. (I don't remember what the guy was saying, because I couldn't get the insides of his nostril out of my head.)

Even MST3K, which showcases baddies in all their glory and delight, couldn't endure this one. The robots could barely even crack jokes about it, other than ""get me out of this"" kinds of comments.

If I remember correctly (I saw it 10 years ago, and the stench is still with me), the film was introduced as a ""cinematic suppository from our video repository"" or something like that. I agree, except that this description might suggest that there's some fun to be had in watching it. No such luck. I'd get more pleasure from cleaning out a septic tank than I had from this horrible waste of celluloid.

Don't buy this, unless you're planning to use it as evidence against the director at his trial for crimes against humanity.",1131408000,3,1075,4.617801047120419
1880066,2,B000096I9S,"The mere mention of the name Jess Franco in the presence of movie fans will elicit several reactions. Some filmgoers will shrug their shoulders as if to say, ""Who's he?"" These people likely spend a lot of time watching big budget, multiplex friendly cinema. Other folks will smile. These film fans recognize this director's name in the context of ""Vampyros Lesbos"" and ""The Marquis De Sade's Justine,"" two Franco movies that actually contain a hint of style. Then there are the poor wretches who'll hear his name and visibly pale, groan as though they've eaten food that's given them salmonella poisoning, and slink quietly away into a corner for a few hours of serious sulking. I fall somewhere in between the last two categories. I liked ""Vampyros Lesbos"" and ""Justine,"" but I've also seen enough Franco films to understand the utter banality of a large segment of his filmography. One need look no further (although one could if one wished to inflict needless suffering on oneself) than Jess Franco's take on the Fu Manchu legend. The director churned out a couple of these films at the behest of producer Harry Alan Towers back in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

The first Franco/Fu Manchu project was ""The Blood of Fu Manchu,"" released in 1969. It's awful. The second sledgehammer to the crotch came out in the States a few years later, in 1972, and went by the name ""The Castle of Fu Manchu."" This one is a war crime. Both star Christopher Lee as the wily Fu Manchu, an Asian despot bent on ruling the world. Both also co-star Tsai Chin as Fu's evil daughter, Richard Greene as Manchu's nemesis Denis Nayland-Smith, and Howard Marion-Smith as Nayland-Smith's (that's a lot of Smiths) comical sidekick Dr. Petrie. Every single one of these people entered the witness protection program after making ""Castle,"" which ought to tell you something. Everyone, that is, except Howard Marion-Smith. He took his life by ingesting a large dose of sleeping pills. One is hesitant to link this genuine tragedy to the metaphysical awfulness of ""The Castle of Fu Manchu,"" but one wonders nonetheless, eh? It's really not all that useful to go to trouble of listing the cast of both films in a review since it becomes painfully obvious early on that a number of chimpanzees could have stood in for the human cast and carried off the movies just as well. I don't think viewers would have noticed the substitution, quite frankly.

Anyway, the plot of ""The Castle of Fu Manchu,"" if we dare call it a plot, involves Fu's plan to bring the nations of the world under his spell by turning the oceans into ice. How to accomplish such an amazing feat? Well, it's important to kidnap a brilliant scientist named Dr. Heracles, whose primary claim to fame is the creation of magical crystals that turn water into ice. It's also important to offer up a little demonstration to the world that these crystals do exactly what Dr. Heracles says they'll do. Fu Manchu accomplishes this trick quite nicely by dropping the ice making concoction into a cheesy looking machine that not only creates a lot of ice, but is so destructive that the movie suddenly switches gears and shows us footage of the Titanic sinking as seen in the 1958 film ""A Night to Remember."" Now that's an evil contraption! While the leaders of the free world laugh their heads off, the movie suddenly shifts focus once again to Istanbul and Manchu's diabolical machinations to take over the operations of a narcotics kingpin named Omar Pasha (Jose Manuel Martin). Why? Good question, and one I can't answer. All I know is that Heracles has a heart condition that needs fixing, Rosalba Neri shows up to shake and shimmy, and Nayland-Smith and Petrie arrive on the scene to save the day. All together now: WHATEVER!

Egads, what a clunker Franco lensed here! The soundtrack should have consisted of nothing more than the sounds of screeching tires and shattering glass played on a perpetual loop. It's no surprise that this film resulted in the abrupt abandonment to film any future Fu Manchu installments. How could anyone justify making another entry after witnessing this car crash? Nothing works in ""Castle."" The editing, the lighting, the camera work, the fight choreography, the dubbing, and the dialogue all have the agility of a turkey attempting to take flight with a brick tied to its feet. With nothing to work with, Franco relies on the sort of gimmicky tricks a first year film school student would find embarrassing. Anyone know how many times he relied on zoom shots of the characters' faces? Anyone? Bueller? Must have been, oh, a couple million times. I hear that the crew over at MST3K shot this one down back in the day. It's too bad I missed out on that episode--then again, as funny as those guys are when panning a particularly trashy movie, watching them zip off zingers with this film would require me to watch the movie again. I'm not willing to go that far, not even for the sake of humor.

Why would I dare give this film two stars when it deserves one? Two reasons: Christopher Lee and the DVD extras. I like Lee, as do most cult film fans, I can't see myself impugning his superhuman efforts to elevate this cheesefest to a decent level. As for the extras, they're pretty good. An interview with Franco discusses the problems he had making the movie as well as his relationship to Christopher Lee. According to the director, Lee would accept the role if he could stay in a nice hotel with a good golf course. Hey, at least someone got some enjoyment out of this catastrophe! For cult film aficionados only, give ""The Castle of Fu Manchu"" a wide berth if you're not used to schlock filmmaking at its absolute worst!",1123459200,2,5686,4.72883064516129
1880067,4,B000096I9S,"The Castle of Fu Manchu is the type of film that will be far more appreciated by cult movie fans than by fans of more mainstream cinema. It's not for everybody. I happen to like these types of things and really enjoyed Castle of Fu Manchu.

 Christopher Lee wasn't the best choice for an Asian character but he is Christopher Lee. Jess Franco has his fans and is known for making unusual films with very little money and a lack of a decent script and that's exactly what you get in Castle of Fu Manchu. The script is lame and the whole thing looks extremely cheap and Harry Alan Towers wrote and produced this. He asks us to believe it's all Franco's fault but I agree with one of the other reviewers on here who hit the nail on the head: Towers wrote the ultra-lame script and no matter who directed this it still would have been badly written. The film would have stood a chance if Sax Rohmer's entertaining Fu Manchu novels were used as the basis for the film instead of the script Tower's wrote which falls far short of the mark made by Rohmer. Tower's ""produced"" this ultra-cheap looking spectacle too.

All of this should let you know that the Castle of Fu Manchu is flawed - but it is also fun. I'm a fan of these types of films and a fan of Lee, Franco, and Towers (even if he tries to place the blame for this one completely on Franco). Blue Underground has done an amazing job with this disc and it includes many fine extras. The film looks better than ever and I had a great time watching this dvd.",1103068800,5,1509,4.269230769230769
1880068,5,B000096I9S,I've loved Franco's two Fu Manchu movies for years and WOW! Blue Underground did a great job with these discs! Blood of Fu Manchu and Castle of Fu Manchu are great guilty pleasures which have been given wonderful treatment on DVD.

1880069,3,B000096I9S,"Let me first of all correct a misconception from an earlier reviewer. This was not a sequel to an original Fu Manchu movie. In total Chrustopher Lee made five Fu Manchu movies - and for those with a region-free DVD player the first three (and best of the series) are available as a box set from Amazon's UK site.
The Castle of Fu Manchu is the sequel to The Blood of Fu Manchu, which was itself a sequel to The Vengeance of Fu Manchu, which was a sequel to The Brides of Fu Manchu, which was a sequel to The Face of Fu Manchu.
Unfortunately for those without a region-free DVD player only the last two (and worst of the bunch) are so far the only DVDs available in the US on Region 1.
The ridiculous plot involves Fu Manchu attempting to disrupt the world shipping lanes by making ice. A nice plot that is flawed only its in execution.
Really this movie should only be purchased as a companion piece to the superior and far more entertaining releases from Region 2. And for those of you who haven't yet bought a region-free DVD player - what's the hold up? :)",1101600000,2,1059,4.27363184079602
1880070,2,B000096I9S,"The villainous Fu Manchu is back yet again, this time with a nefarious plot to rule the world involving...making ice?  Oh geez...Jesus 'Jess' Franco, Master of the Unnecessary Close Up, not to mention also being the Master of the Useless Zoom In/Zoom Out, and Master of the Pointless Pan Shot, directed this mess of a movie.  Christopher Lee reprises his role from the earlier films The Face of Fu Manchu (1965), The Brides of Fu Manchu (1966), The Vengeance of Fu Manchu (1967), and The Blood of Fu Manchu (1968).  Also appearing are Richard Greene as Denis Nayland-Smith, Howard Marion Crawford as Dr. Petrie, and Tsai Chin as Fu Manchu's daughter, Lin Tang.  While I haven't had an oppourtunity to see all these films, this one, the last in the series, seems weak and probably holds up poorly to the original films, but then that's pretty much what people have come to expect from numerous sequels, each to be worse than the next (personally, I think it should be the other way around, but what do I know?).

With Fu Manchu's return he brings with him some kind of process that can create ice from water...am I blowing your mind?  Wait...he demonstrates this early on by creating an iceberg (?!) and sinking a Caribbean ocean liner.  The process involves complicated machinery and magic crystals, Pop Rocks, I think...anyway, he kidnaps the scientist who originally developed the process, but the man has a really bad heart, so Fu Manchu also kidnaps a heart specialist to do a transplant.  I am not sure why he needed the scientist with the bad heart, the one who created the water freezing process, as Fu Manchu already demonstrated that he had the power to manipulate water, but maybe his process wasn't quite as refined as he would have liked...who knows?  The whole movie is filled with moronic plot points like this.  Oh yeah, he also takes over a castle in Istanbul, with the aid of a local opium drug lord, who Fu Manchu then betrays because he's so evil.  Also, within this very prominent castle resides a high ranking government official, who is quickly dispatched, but no one seems to notice...like ever...oh well...maybe he wasn't very popular to begin with...Nayland Smith is assigned to the case, with Dr. Petrie tagging along, and the chase is on...sort of...thing is, there were just so many characters in this film, and too many pointless plot threads flailing about, smacking the viewer in the face.  Combined with an extremely weak plot, pointless dialogue, and amateurish directing, this film became very hard to watch very quickly.

Things that annoyed me throughout the film...Fu Manchu's seemingly inexhaustible supply of disposable henchmen.  And where did he get these cut-rate knuckleheads?  They obviously couldn't fight, so at least they could have been supplied with firearms...what was with the goofy mood lighting beneath the castle, in the caves?  Red, purple and blue lighting?  Ugh...it looked like a bad disco...I half expected to see one of those black light posters on the wall at some point.  The constant zooming in on character's faces, as though to try and create a sense of suspense...and the camera's tendency to linger on non-relevant scenes for so very long...so much padding...the scenes shot on location looked decent, but they only served to exemplify how cheap and awful the scenes shot on sets were, especially the scenes in the bowels of the castle.  There was potential here do to something decent, given the talent of the actors involved, but it was all wasted.  I did like the costumes, and Christopher Lee looked suitably fiendish in his full-length robes.  Some of the locations were nice to look at, but other than those elements, I couldn't find much else to enjoy in this film.

Blue Underground dose an exceptional job with releasing this shoddy film, providing a number of great special features.  There are interviews with the actors and the film makers, a couple of detailed biographies, a nice wide screen picture, facts about the character Fu Manchu and his creator, Sax Rohmer, a poster and still gallery, and even a sweet little reproduction of an original movie poster inside the case.

1880071,3,B000096I9S,"This is the final entry in the Christopher Lee/ Fu Manchu series of films, produced by Harry Alan Towers. This is a wonderful DVD from the fine folks at Blue Underground with some really nice extras, too bad the film isn't as good!
  Chris Lee is great as the devil doctor but the story, such as it is, is incredibly stupid. Fu, of course, wants to rule the world and to this end he plots to turn all the world's water to ice. Okay. It is up to the intrepid Nayland Smith (Richard Greene) of Scotland Yard to save the day with the help of his Watson-like sidekick Dr. Petrie (Howard Marion Crawford).
  The print of the film looks great and the sound is crystal clear. The film is in anamorphic widescreen and a joy to look at.
  It has always been a source of disappointment to me that these films weren't better than they are. Much of the fault must be laid squarely on the producer, Mr. Towers, who wrote all the screenplays under the name of Peter Welbeck. Why he wrote his own stories instead of basing the movies on Sax Rohmer's original novels is a mystery to me. Many of the original novels are quite good with interesting plots and characters. Even the character of Fu Manchu is more complex in the books. For instance, in ""PRESIDENT FU MANCHU"", Fu (remember he is a doctor), performs an operation on a young boy to save his life. You never see Lee doing anything like that in these films (or Karloff in ""MASK OF FU MANCHU"", or any of the other screen Fu's). Also, although Fu wants to rule the world in the books, he longs for a peaceful world without war, disease, or poverty. In the 3rd Lee/ Fu film, ""VENGEANCE OF FU MANCHU"", one character says, ""We know of your desire to rule the world, a world of crime"". Rule a world of crime? That isn't what Fu wants. Didn't Mr. Towers ever read even one of the novels? What a pity! With Lee as Fu and the wonderful Tsai Chin as his daughter, this could have been a great series. As it is, this is a very mediocre series of films with only Lee and Chin to make them mildly interesting.
  Having said that, this is sort of a fun film to watch and an improvement over the previous entry, ""BLOOD OF FU MANCHU"" (also available from Blue Underground). You even get to see director Jess Franco in a small role as a police inspector.
  The DVD extras are great. A 13 minute feature with commments from Lee and Chin, director Jess Franco and Mr. Towers. I must address one thing Mr. Towers says about Franco. He blames Franco for the poor quality of these last 2 films saying he ""killed off Fu Manchu"". I think that is an unfair statement. Franco isn't the greatest director in the world but the poor quality of these films isn't his fault alone. Mr. Towers must take some of the blame for his really lame screenplays. Even Alfred Hitchcock or Stanley Kubrick at the height of their creativity couldn't have breathed life into Mr. Towers lame scripts!
  Also included are trailers, poster and photo galleries, some wonderful liner notes by ""VIDEO WATCHDOGS"" editor, Tim Lucas, info on Sax Rohmer and a bibliography of Fu novels (read some, they are good), and bios of Lee and Franco.
  Overall, a nice disc for Lee and/or Franco fans, or anyone who loves that mysterious oriental super-genius, Fu Manchu. -George Bauch",1066780800,14,3262,4.433110367892977
1880072,2,B000096I9S,"When even Harry Alan Towers admits a film is bad, you know you're in trouble. On the disc's featurette he recalls turning to the amazingly untalented and prolific Jess Franco after seeing the final cut and telling him ""You've done something I didn't think was possible: you've killed Fu Manchu."" And how...

Badly directed, written, acted, photographed, recorded - heck, I'm willing to bet that even the catering was bad on this one - it's a real ordeal even for the most devoted Fu Manchu fan. If you thought the series couldn't get worse after the astonishing use of black and white stock footage from 'A Night to Remember,' you ain't seen nothin' yet. And not seeing it is probably the best thing to do by far.

But, for Fu Fanatics, the disc is still a must buy, if only for the extras and the presentation. The second of the two-part documentary descends into Jess Franco telling Christopher Lee stories about other films, but the rest of the package is well put together and Blue Underground's transfer is the best the film has probably ever looked (not much of a compliment, it's true).

7989923,2,B000096I9S,"This is the final installment in the late 1960s Fu Manchu films. In a case of definitely not saving the best for last, ""The Castle of Fu Manchu"" stars Christopher Lee as Fu Manchu in another diabolical plot, this time to take over the world by turning the oceans into ice. Opposing him is his mortal enemy Nayland Smith (Richard Greene.) Also opposing him: the concept and script of this notorious blunder, produced and largely penned (under a pseudonym) by Harry Alan Towers, a name long known to make hardened B-movie connoisseurs run screaming from the room. If that wasn't enough, it's directed by Jess Franco, so you know it will be full of...interesting...camera work and lighting.

The plot is almost indecipherable, and has arduous intertwining themes revolving around crystals, freezing water, the opium trade, general thuggery, a heart surgery of a laughable nature, and blackmail on an international scale. It is tiring and boring trying to keep up with it, and the direction and editing from Franco and company made it a worse mess than it had to be. Perhaps not the best choice to play an Asian supervillain, Lee looks bored throughout and delivers his lines in a deathly dull monotone, while other cast members largely provide workmanlike attempts at their craft, but end up with dismal performances or wild overacting, presumably influenced a great deal by the direction they received. Along with most B-movie fans, my favorite moment in the film is the wholesale lifting of the ""Titanic"" sinking scene from another movie (in glorious tinted black and white, no less!), and trying to pass it off as an ocean liner being sunk as a demonstration of Fu's evil machinations. Guffaws are guaranteed.

In all truth the movie is the weakest of all the Fu Manchu series, and is borderline unwatchable. Why did I give it two stars, then? First, the Blue Underground print looks excellent, far better than it has in years. Second, the film was spoofed by our friends at ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" and is now available in a four DVD set as well. I recommend watching both versions back to back. The MST3K version will seem like paradise in comparison to the original, though the print used is inferior. I thought it fitting that in a new introduction segment to the MST3K version Frank Conniff revealed that they thought this was one of the worst and most unpleasant movies they had ever sat through, and commented brilliantly and extensively about the incoherence of the plot. I couldn't agree with Frank more. I had seen this years ago, but when I heard the MST3K box set was coming out, I knew I had to watch both the uncut DVD and the MST3K version again. For most viewers I would simply say ""stay away."" For diehard bad movie, horror, Hammer film, and Christopher Lee fans, though, this is a film you may want to see.

The film begins with footage from an earlier Fu Manchu movie. It isn't used for a flashback, they were just too cheap to come-up with new special effects or footage so they use the old stuff and pretend we won't notice. That pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the movie.

This time around Fu Manchu has discovered a way to freeze the world's oceans, but he needs opium crystals to do it (don't ask). He plans on freezing the Bosporus Straits to bring the world to its knees. In order to do this he kidnaps Prof. Heracles. Unfortunately, he is gravely ill and needs a heart transplant. So Fu Manchu kidnaps another doctor.
