But the real value of THIS video (because if you like the Cape Horn stuff you should buy Around Cape Horn) is that this film is about the man, his wife, and their substantial adventures after the Cape Horn trip.  They sailed around the world multiple times with a crew of children, teaching them to sail and live an authentic life.  Irving and his wife are the best of people, and it comes across without a doubt.  The kids say how that was the best time of their lives.  The footage is awesome, unlike anything you can find on film (that I know of).

The producers feel the same way I do, really glorifying Irving as one of the best sailors ever, etc.  At first I was a little put off, but by the end you can't help but to agree wholeheartedly. And, as a special treat, they took Irving and his wife back to the boat they had sailed on, took them out on a day sail, and filmed them on the boat.  At age 79, Irving and his wife climbed the mast, sat on the crow's nest and reminisced.  The current owners of the boat just stared up in disbelief.

This video is satisfying on so many levels.  It brings tears to my eyes every time I watch it, and everyone I have showed it to (sailor or not) agrees that it is inspirational and amazing.  I give this my highest recommendation.  If Amazon doesn't have it, try Mystic Seaport Museum, the producer of the video.",1259798400,2,1630,4.196141479099678
8093546,5,B000BWE7OW,"This film is a treasure. I've seen it several times over the past few years as it is a feature of the Wooden Boat Festival we celebrate in Homer, Alaska every year. Mr Johnson narrates his film, shot in 1912, from the deck of the Peking, a 4-masted barque as it rounds Cape Horn with a cargo headed from Hamburg, Germany to Chile. Some of the scenes are unbelievable, e.g., a sequence shot from the top of the mast looking down at the ship as it is inundated again and again with giant combers. The narration is superb and Johnson's enthusiastic tone makes you wonder why we don't all want to go sailing 'round the Horn.

Those days are gone forever but if you want to get a brief taste of what it was like to sail in the old days, this is a heck of a way to do that.",1236729600,,767,4.079470198675497
