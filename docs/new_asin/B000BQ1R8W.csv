8090797,4,B000BQ1R8W,"At the time of my purchase, I didn't know that this was part of a set.  Because I liked this one so well, I bought the rest.  The beauty of this particular DVD is that it highlights the people who influenced rock 'n roll -- besides the obvious (Elvis, Everly Brothers, Little Richard, etc.)  They are there too, but the show talked about other artists who pre-dated rock 'n roll (Muddy Waters, Big Joe Turner).

The only thing I didn't like was the fact that they only played short snippets of the songs.  Because most of these performances are rare (especially on disk 1), I would have liked to have seen the whole thing.

Something that isn't blindingly obvious at first is that there are commentaries at the end of the DVD.  I found some of them to be amazing (especially Pete Townsend's) and some seemed to be commercials for inclusion in the R 'n R Hall of Fame (if they weren't there already).

I was saddened to see how many of the old-timers ""just knew the minute"" they heard the early artists that ""r 'n r would be a tremendous force in American music.""  Have your BS Meter on!",1354147200,,1086,4.39
