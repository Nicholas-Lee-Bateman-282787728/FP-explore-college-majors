8061143,5,B0009I7DCQ,"I received a DVD of Billy Blue Hair - Why do Giraffes Have Long Necks as a gift. It was a little young for my 9 year-old so I passed it to my sister who has kids aged 3 and 6. They absolutely love it, especially the 3 year old calls it ""the animal movie"" and frequently requests it.",1157414400,,282,3.7966101694915255
8061144,5,B0009I7DCQ,"I have watched this video with children aged 4-8 on several occasions.  Every time, the children have been enchanted by Billy's explanations of 'why animals are they way they are'.  Are zebras black with white stripes or white with black stripes?  How tall is a giraffe?  The questions are answered in ways that help children visualize and understand the natural world.  Billy's sidekick, Doogie, moves the story along in an entertaining and informative way.  Lots of fun and very educational.",1151020800,,493,5.1
8061145,2,B0009I7DCQ,"I received this DVD today and watched it with my 3yr. old.  The information presented about bison, zebras, apes and monkeys, giraffes, and a couple of others is presented in a way that youngsters can understand, but I found the narrator, Billy Blue Hair, to be completely annoying.  His voice and manner of speaking is way too similar to the ultimate brat, Bart Simpson.  The animation is very much in the cartoon style, and the exclamations Billy uses include ""holy guacamole"", not an expression I'd like to hear my child repeat.

Overall, this program was difficult for me to watch, and my 3 year old began fidgeting before the 30 minute show ended.  We don't watch a lot of TV, but he has no trouble sitting through most half hour videos.  If Amazon did not have a NO RETURN policy for DVD's, I'd return this one!",1149552000,,816,4.554794520547945
8061146,5,B0009I7DCQ,All three of my kids love Billy Blue Hair.  They range in age from 6 to 11.  Billy entertains all ages and is very educational!  A must have for every family!,1134432000,,158,4.032258064516129
8061147,5,B0009I7DCQ,"K-Gr 5-When viewers are first introduced to Billy Blue Hair and his dog Doogie, the pair are playing fetch in their animated world. Billy is a preteen boy who wears a t-shirt, shorts, and tennis shoes and has a healthy head of blue hair. When the ball goes into the high grasses, Doogie follows. When Doogie doesn't return, Billy goes after him and finds himself in a live-action world filled with wondrous animals. During his quest to find Doogie, Billy comes across the American Bison, Siamong Ape, Red Ruffed Lemur Monkey, giraffes, zebras, and lions. Billy offers facts about the animals, such as the environment they live in, eating habits, and general information about size and stature. Definitions of unfamiliar terms are woven seamlessly into the narration. For example, ""zebras are herbivores, which means they mainly eat grasses."" Fun facts are reinforced with the inclusion of animated figures within the live-action footage. When a question such as, ""Did you know that a giraffe is as tall as three grown men standing on top of each other?"" is posed, three animated men standing on top of one another appear for a brief time next to the giraffe. With great production values, a wealth of interesting facts, and a likeable guide, this first episode in the series is a must-have for every collection serving young children.",1133222400,3,1334,4.959821428571429
