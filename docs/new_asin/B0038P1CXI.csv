I recomend it if you like this type of show.",1279324800,,119,3.8
4091881,5,B0038P1CXI,"My first experience with Morgan Spurlock's ""30 days"" series was in a college cultural diversity class.  The idea of taking someone and immersing them into a lifestyle so completely different from theirs for 30 days is a little crazy to me.  This series is an ""in your face"" look at people and different life styles or cultures we only wonder about.  Very eye opening; and to those that are bold enough to keep an open mind throughout, what a wonderful learning experience.  I would almost go as far as to make some of these shows ""required"" viewing in all school districts throughout the world.  It is imperative that we as a people learn to understand the differences of other cultures so that we can learn to live together in this crazy world; hopefully avoiding conflicts because of our own ignorance and fears because someone or a group of people are different than us.  Great job Morgan - Hope to see and hear more shows along these lines.",1279152000,10,944,4.622754491017964
4091882,1,B0038P1CXI,"Morgan Spurlock has made a career out of creating emergencies, and then filming them as ""reality"" shows. Most of his viewers apparently buy into his version of events because he reinforces stereotypes they already have, and they're happy to finally see their political agenda proven right.

But Spurlock is nothing more than a propagandist--a transparent and heavy-handed one, at that.

Take, for instance, his episode about living on minimum wage. Although I can't say that I personally have ever spent a month ""in stir,"" or that I ever lived as a Muslim for four weeks (the Muslim thing is something you can't do on a temporary basis anyway, because if you quit, you are an apostate and have to be put to death--that is, if you buy into what the Qur'an has to say on the subject). But I HAVE lived on minimum wage for more than thirty days, and frankly, it wasn't as horrible as Spurlock & Co. would have us believe. I mean, I wasn't living at the Hilton and ordering room service, but I wasn't sleeping under a cardboard box on a grate, either.

Spurlock's approach is that living on minimum is so horrible because it is such a step DOWN from his lifestyle. He's making a six--or at this point, seven--figure salary. He has a huge amount of discretionary income, and he has no restrictions on where he can go. Guess what? That's an extreme exception! Of course he's suffering!

He ends up getting a fairly decent apartment (which his pouty girlfriend calls ""home sweet hovel"") and, right away, lands a job.  Which he doesn't like because it's physically demanding and mind-numbing. Hmm. Well, that's how most jobs for the unskilled are, which is incentive to go out and get skills. But let's let that go for now, and assume that he's trying to create a scenario that would fit someone who has no skills and would never be able to acquire them.

Then, he and his snobby I'm-so-irritated-at-Morgan-because-he-has-me-slumming girlfriend wind up with a total of three emergency room visits between them. The point is, they don't have insurance, which is their God-given right! But they bypass free clinics because of a long wait time. News flash: people WITH insurance--with HMO's--wait all day for appointments. When I was insured by an HMO--""the best in the country,"" so I was told--wait times of five, six, seven hours were not unusual.  And you couldn't make appointments in advance because the computers were always down. Morgan should have toughed it out at the free clinic with the long line--it would have given him insight into what's around the corner for ALL of us with socialized medicine, which I bet will be a lot like my former HMO.

So: they're breaking even on their salaries, and then they throw themselves down the well of debt because of these faked ER visits. Why didn't they just cut to the chase and blow their wages at a casino boat? It would have been more fun.

Oh yeah, they also screw up a night on the town and miss the last bus, so they're forced to get ferried home by taxi.  How many people take taxis? Not that many.  THEY'RE TOO EXPENSIVE. But Morgan and Miss Crabby Pants have to create some insurmountable problem that forces them to lose yet more money. ""Boo hoo hoo. I've made stupid budgeting decisions! Someone please come and help me!""

Morgan's premise seems to be that EVERYONE is entitled to maintain a lifestyle HE considers normal. That's never been true. I have known many, many people during my life who have, for one reason or another, lived on minimum wage. If you find yourself in that income bracket and expect to live like someone making 50K/year, you're in for a shock. But if you make sound decisions, you can survive pretty well. For one thing,  a lot of people consolidate their incomes--minimal though they may be--and live as a community. This has always been how people survive, from medievel monastaries to the Great Depression. Morgan's idea that you're ENTITLED to your own lavish place with fabulous dining opportunities and reliable, comfortable transporation is a fantasy.

People who have seriously limited means can still live well, if they make sensible decisions. But Morgan's approach is that of a guy who can only afford a used Toyota, reliable but not loaded, and then complains about how it's just not like the late-model Caddie he's used to.

It would have been way more interesting if Morgan had approached the project with the idea that he would live those 30 days comfortably, if not like a king. He went into the situation already convinced that those 30 days would be hell--which it probably was for him, because he was saddled with that cry-baby girlfriend.

When teachers assign these episodes to their students, I hope they're not just ""showing a slice of life."" I hope they're prefacing these alarmist stories with the question, ""What could have Morgan done to avoid these catastrophes?""",1278892800,7,4870,4.779761904761905
4091883,5,B0038P1CXI,"Put someone in an unscripted ""uncomfortable"" (for them) situation for 30 days and see what happens.  Are they open to change and do they change?  The topics presented are current and create some conflict (they are not easy topics with easy answers).  How the people work out this conflict, perhaps come to a new and deeper understanding of the issues, perhaps change their opinions will restore your faith in humanity.

My favorites are: Minimum Wage, Muslims and America, Straight Man in a Gay World (be sure to watch a second time with the director's commentary), Immigration, Atheist vs. Christian, Jail, Living in a Wheelchair, Same Sex Parenting, and Life on an Indian Reservation.

I especially enjoy watching these with a small group of thoughtful people, pausing the DVD to discuss our opinions on the current situation.  They generate great discussions.

Finally, as one who purchased Season 1 and then Season 2, you can get all 3 Seasons at a great price 18 episodes for under $30.  I encourage everyone to own this set -- it is a classic and you will be showing it to your friends.",1277337600,3,1092,4.802139037433155
4091884,5,B0038P1CXI,"30 Days is a life changing documentary TV show. Each episode features a person who lives with someone else for 30 days and walks in their shoes. The results are life changing.  By truely getting to know another person you begin to see people for who they are rather than just what they believe.  In the end, most of us are really all the same other than a few minor details.  By watching it will change the way you view people as well.  We used this in our small group class at church and had some wonderful discussions.  Also would  be great for teen groups or groups at schools.  Especially the minimum wage episode.  The best episodes, in my opinion, are minimum wage, illegal immigrant, muslim, prison, and homosexual.  Morgan has a great style of telling a story.  He doesn't encourage confrontation and doesn't try to create conflict.  He really wants people to learn what real life is like for another person.  AWESOME!",1274227200,9,926,4.613496932515337

4091895,4,B0038P1CXI,"While this series has a formula to pit a less desired perspective (anti-immigrant, anti-gay, anti-Muslim, etc.) against a more desired one, it does produce very interesting material about many contemporary controversial issues.  I use several of these episodes in two of the university courses I teach to improve students' understanding of and empathy for some marginalized groups.  The episodes are funny and awkward and do not skirt the difficult questions.

4091905,3,B0038P1CXI,"This is a great idea, but maybe the 1 hour time-limit per subject was the problem.  The first sequence, ""The Minimum Wage"", had great dynamics with Morgan Spurlock and his fianc.  They touched on the subject of Health Care for the working poor; it is outstanding if you are brought to the hospital needing a heart transplant, for example, because it will all be paid for as a life-threatening condition.  However, if you need preventive care, you may have to stand in line at the Free Clinic depending on the availability of physicians.  When Morgan had to go to the ER and subsequently received a bill for $551, he was incensed at what he thought was a ridiculous charge...how did he THINK the FREE heart transplants are paid for?  We can't afford to let hospitals close for lack of making enough money to cover expenses.
Some of the other sequences lead to insights into leading a ""Green life"", ""A Gay Life"", ""An Illegal Immigrant Life"", which really opened my eyes onto these lifestyles in a good way.  Then there were lackluster sequences which really needing expanding upon such as ""A Christian Life vs. Atheist"", ""Binge Drinking Mom"", ""Jail"" (what exactly was being exposed or what point was being made?), ""Anti-Aging"" in which a man took an unimaginable number of supplements every day until his liver almost shut down, etc.  For instance, in the ""Outsourcing"" episode, I learned a lot about living in India, but I'm not sure what the point was being made about ""Outsourcing"".
Morgan Spurlock is fascinating to watch, and I'm almost sure that if he starred in every episode we would have learned what point he was trying to get across.  Sadly, that didn't happen.  There are 18 episodes and about half of them either get their points across or I learned something new that made it worth the time.",1363651200,2,1803,4.73482428115016
4091906,5,B0038P1CXI,"Although I despise the medium of television as a substitute for critical education, there are certainly instances (here is a case in point) where TV documentaries can be transposed into the classroom to provide an additional source of input.

I use these DVDs in my sociology and 'issues' classes at  University in Japan and I have had nothing but success with them.

For educators I recommend one of the following two viewing patterns:
i) Use all the episodes if you have a once-per-week class over a 15-week semester. Have students research the topic, have them prepare brainstormings and typed questions on the topic. Then watch the DVD in class (45 minutes) and follow up with a mixture of their general questions on the topic in-hand and questions drawn from the actual documentary.
ii) Use only the topics that leave students lacking, as an in-class resource. This will cary from culture to culture, but in Japan the ones that performed this function best were: religion, abortion, working-poor and homosexuality.

As a side-note these would also be excellent starting resources for conscientious families looking to broach important social issues with their children

However you use these I think you will find success. Be sure, however, to remind students that these are not the metanarrative Truth, but merely one petit rcit in a collective pluralist notion of what constitutes the truthS.",1360972800,,1399,5.118421052631579

Everyone should watch this. I am sure I will watch these episodes over and over, to remind myself of what's important.

PS: These episodes do not 'lecture' or try to convince you of anything, they simply report the experience of one person why 'tried on' someone else's life.",1358208000,,649,4.684210526315789

4091915,2,B0038P1CXI,"I was excited to view this series, given what my friends have told me about some of the episodes.  Some of the episodes are compelling (in particular, the minimum wage episode), while some are so moronic I couldn't even sit through the first 10 minutes (for instance Binge Drinking Mom).  Some of the people they got to be 30-dayers where totally obnoxious (like the two people in the Off the Grid episode who were unceasingly obnoxious and rude to everyone living in the commune, and the milquetoast husband and his incredibly controlling and b*tchy wife in the anti-aging episode).  The choice of some of these people made some episodes unnecessarily painful to sit through.

The first season DVD's are well produced, but the second season DVD's have problems.  For instance, and offered special feature is a commentary of the immigration episode.  If you try to play the commentary, all you get is the regular episode over again.  Also, the Outsourcing episode either has been (very badly) dubbed over, or the audio is completely out of synch with the video (and I do mean completely).  It was unwatchable.

4091922,5,B0038P1CXI,"It's rare you find a series that genuinely attempts to display both sides of a story from an unbiased (as possible) third party perspective. Morgan Spurlock does an excellent job of finding ordinary enthusiasts / believers and putting them in situations where they have to think outside of their comfort zone. What makes this show truly great is that Spurlock doesn't search for people who are crazy or totally off the wall, but instead he finds what I consider to be a fair representation of people in various living situations and brings them together. It may not turn out as dramatic as if he had chosen someone truly off the wall, but then the purpose of the show would be defeated, and no lessons would be learned. Spurlock also does a great job of attempting to illustrate life in situations where he could not ask anyone else to participate other than himself (such as 30 days in jail), and performs a fair and rational explanation of his feelings in these situations. While at times I have felt Morgan was somewhat slanted in his revelations in these situations, the vast majority of the time I felt his comments were justified and correct. It's for this reason I have preferred episodes such as taking a Minuteman and putting him in a family of illegal immigrants for 30 days, or having an Atheist live with Evangelical Christians for 30 days. Nevertheless, any television show that promotes critical thought and makes one reevaluate his or her believe structure is something  our television networks need more of.

4091923,4,B0038P1CXI,"30 Days is an incredibly moving and insightful TV series. In an era where the microphone is given to those who shout the loudest (and most polarizing) messages, Morgan Spurlock and his cast of cultural crusaders and average Joes/Janes explore some of the most contentious issues being debated in the US.

His tactic of choice? Empathy. People from different value systems do what many of our political leaders cannot bring themselves to do; attempt to see things from their opponents' perspective. This show exemplifies the age old idiom, ""walk a mile in my shoes..."" The breadth of issues encompassed in this show ranges from the plights of Native Americans and coal miners to the benefits of New Age practices. One might be turned off by the amount of social messages being thrown, but Spurlock does an excellent job of balancing heartfelt, learning, and quirky moments to keep you engaged and entertained.

His values premier in episodes that he stars in, but they are overt and he does a fairly decent job at remaining objective; giving both sides their due. So much so, that it may give pause to even the most passionate preachers; anti-firearm champions may question the cultural value of firearms in rural America and anti-immigration activists may sympathize with those they seek to deport.

This is a truly wonderful and, I think, important series. If you are looking for more validation so that you soap box stands a little higher, you may want to see what else is on. But if you have a genuine interest in seeking truth and a chance to witness humanity in both sides of the argument, my guess is you will get something out of this show.",1292457600,20,1647,4.792253521126761

The Christian/atheist episode could have stated that Christian children who torment atheist children are not showing true Christian faith. If you truly believe Christian faith it says love/respect your neighbor. Remember there are bully's on both sides of the issue with tolerant and intolerant people on both sides. We are not all perfect. I'm a Native American and I believe we have an excellent faith because our people were taught they were guardians of the sacred Mother Earth and all creatures on it that they were not superior, they did not exploit and destroy the earth and everything on it. They lived in harmony with the world because everyone and everything is connected. When the earth is destroyed by the greedy exploiting every resource until there are none left then it's goodby to everyone including the greedy no matter how much gold they possess there will be nothing left to buy with it.
