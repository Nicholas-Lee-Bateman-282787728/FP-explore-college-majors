7413691,5,B014IEQB06,"What creative stories that keep your attention. The first story (in the first set of DVDs) is a bit grim and dark, but is not representative of the rest of the stories.

This small Swedish town on the rocky Atlantic coast is very picturesque and makes for a great backdrop. Husband is the cop on the local police force, and while he and his wife have 3 small children, the wife always has some time to help out with gathering clues from the locals or evidence.

We all enjoyed this series to the max. Would rate both sets A-1. Purchase both and you won't be sorry!",1451692800,,564,4.311320754716981

Camilla Lackberg is often referred to as the Swedish Agatha Christie, because of her detailed and analytical style of writing, as well as her in-depth character development. The Fjallbacka Murders represent a series of homicide cases which feature the distinctive Nordic Noir atmosphere, and that confer an exceedingly dark and suspenseful mood to the stories. This series entitled the Camilla Lackberg Fjallbacka Murders consists of three separate episodes, each of which centers around an intriguing and gripping murder mystery, replete with interesting twists and turns. In addition, the beautiful southwestern Swedish resort town of Fjallbacka features absolutely spectacular coastal scenery, and it provides the perfect setting for the Fjallbacka Murders. These superb murder mysteries are decidedly intelligent, compelling, and captivating, and they make for very engaging and entertaining viewing. The Camilla Lackberg Fjallbacka Murders is a series which features excellent plot and character development, as well as great acting performances, and it definitely merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1508198400,,1333,5.984293193717278
