4530779,4,B0052SO06A,"I was very surprised by this little known film. I purchased this DVD-R because I generally admire the work of its two primary participants, Director, Budd Boetticher and Joseph Cotten. People Generally remember Boetticher's Westerns but,this tough,fast-paced suspense film with great L.A. location photography underlines his talent as a director. The unexpected bonus to this movie is the performance of Wendell Corey. In maybe, the best performance of his career, Wendell Corey is both frightening and pathetic as he seeks his revenge. The last five minutes as Cotten attempts to bring down the assassin, are particularly wrenching. Check this little nugget out.",1313366400,58,663,5.509803921568627

8454242,4,B0052SO06A,"Budd Boetticher's nifty little 1956 Angeleno noir runs all of 73 minutes and was his last modern-dress film, immediately preceding his  intelligently terse Ranown Westerns cycle and the great Legs Diamond biopic with Ray Danton. It's a less apocalyptic followup to KISS ME DEADLY, with similar SoCal locales--the wrong side of greater Beverly Hills--immaculately photographed by Lucien Ballard. Los Angeles is smoggy, overcast and finally rainy in this daylight policier, and the ostensible stars Joseph Cotten and Rhonda Fleming, both in not wholly sympathetic roles, are completely eclipsed by the choice supporting cast. There are standout parts in a very short film for Michael Pate, John Beradino, Alan Hale Jr., Virginia Christine and Dee J. Thompson. Cotten, a good cop but a bad liar, and Fleming, a vain and self-directed trophy bride, are cardboard noir stereotypes (they are cloned in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL) not nearly as interesting as their second-tier interlocutors, and the economical runtime is decisively stolen by Wendell Corey, very imaginatively cast as the title's Walter Mittyesque killer.

Corey had been a complex noir antihero in Siodmak's FILE ON THELMA JORDON and was the sole, and dubious, voice of logical nonvoyeuristic reason in REAR WINDOW. As Boetticher's killer he, like Legs Diamond, has a swift rise and fall in the quickie story arc. Boetticher was ever a witty and wise film economist, and here Corey's story is told through his iconic costumes, smartly supervised by William Sarris. Corey begins very straight, in hornrims and banker suit, then is progressively abased by prison jumpsuit and hayseed overalls, both conspicuously inapt on lower Roxbury. Poor unhinged Wendell is sleep-deprived, hungry (check out the exploded milk bottle) and loose in L.A., and his final humiliation in that fashion center comes in drag, with Corey incongruously modeling hornrims, plus--direct from Bullock's or May Co. womenswear--chic scarf, plaid raincoat and plastic booties. They are completely surreal, these progressively degrading fashion makeovers, and the actor and Boetticher have great fun with the character's disintegrating visual morphology. (Even Robert Aldrich didn't think quite this outrageously, although Cloris Leachman was supposedly naked under HER raincoat in the Mike Hammer film.)

In the end viewers will inevitably rethink their appreciation of Wendell Corey--this is one of the great noir star turns--with all empathy reserved for his tortured character (and not for Cotten or Fleming) and the humiliating indignity of his Eisenhower Era fashion debasement. Boetticher's economical minimalism was visionary and has worn surpassingly well into this cinema century, with the color Ranowns looking more timeless than ever and the B/W Corey and Danton contemporary films playing as clean, but not sanitized, takes on overfamiliar genre conventions that tempted other directors to excesses. Like Don Siegel, Boetticher keeps everything visually controlled within a rigorously strict timeline and budget, and his modest films graciously never outstay their warm welcome.",1469318400,,3112,5.631130063965885

8454244,3,B0052SO06A,"This film is surprisingly unsettling, largely because of Wendell Corey's performance.  In many ways, his Leon Poole, ostensibly the ""villain"" of the piece, is almost (but not quite) the film's anti-hero because you can't help but sympathize with him at least a little.  By contrast, the Joseph Cotten/Rhonda Fleming lead couple are difficult to root for, especially when both characters do almost astonishingly stupid things in the final third of the movie.  We can understand Poole's motives and feelings and, in a way, even his actions, far more than any other characters' in the film. Poole is the most three-dimensional person in the story, despite his almost chilling weary calmness.

I'd love to see a modern remake of this film with a different ending, though the type of ending I'd prefer can't be described without a spoiler, so I won't. But I suspect the ending they thought they were shooting felt differently on the page from the one they achieved, because I doubt they had foreseen how much more sympathetic Poole had become to us than the selfish wife portrayed by Fleming.

But even in this version, Corey undeniably makes this a film to be reckoned with, and his performance throughout is both fascinating and haunting.  There is an extended sequence where Poole is in the house of his old Army superior officer from the war, and this feels like the centerpiece of the film, both symbolically and dramatically.  And yet there are several other unusual and arresting sequences, including the final 5 to 10 minutes, expertly directed-on-a-shoestring for heightened tension.

Even in a fairly cluttered category of psychological thrillers in the 50s and 60s, this one has an identity and distinction all its own. Despite being squarely a B-movie whose low budget is evident in every shot, and despite an almost ludicrously ineffective group of policemen and numerous stupid decisions made by ""the good guys"" in the story itself,
this movie sticks with you as something noticeably greater than the mere sum of its parts.  Largely because of Corey's performance and Budd Boetticher's taut direction, this little film is a minor noir classic deserving greater popularity and attention.",1410912000,2,2195,5.091922005571031
8454245,4,B0052SO06A,"A bank holdup. An inside job. The cops, led by Det. Sam Wagner (Joseph Cotten) figure this out pretty quickly and are soon knocking down the door of Leon 'Foggy' Poole (Wendell Corey), but when Wendell's wife is killed accidentally in a shootout, he vows revenge against the Detective.  This is a solid thriller/police procedural noir with Corey really outstanding as the sweaty, beady-eyed, half-crazy/half-lucid ""killer"" of the title.  It's a pretty remarkable performance, as he manages to be at least slightly sympathetic despite also being every bit as scary as Richard Widmark or Dan Duryea at their creepiest.  I don't know a lot about Corey, but after seeing this I definitely want to check out more.

The very good Los Angeles location work and director Budd Boetticher's excellent handling of action make this an above-average noir despite the secondary storyline of the detective's troubles with his wife (Rhonda Fleming) not really adding up to what it promises early on. I don't quite buy Cotten in this role either, he just doesn't seem that involved, but as it's really Corey's show I don't consider that a major problem.",1381968000,6,1136,5.026595744680851

8454247,3,B0052SO06A,"I don't know about you but I like my American psychos, the cinematic variety okay, strictly, well, bonkers, and with a certain flare. You know guys like Robert Walker in Strangers On A Train or Anthony Perkins in Psycho. Guys you wouldn't want to invite dinner, or any meal, and would feel ill at ease having within sixteen towns of where you live. So your average Walter Mitty psycho, like this guy Leon Poole I am going to give you the ""skinny"" on, left me flat. Left me flat because maybe with about a six drug cocktail his weasely little problems could have been brought under control and maybe he could have led a civilized life like the rest of us. Instead he was last seen dressed in drag with about thirty-three (hell, that is only a guess) cop-directed slugs in him on some fellow copper's lawn. Let me tell you how he got there and you will see why I only go for stone-cold psychos.

This Leon, like a lot of guys back in the1940s and 1950s, maybe now too but that was the time of Leon's time so let's stick with that, was kind of clumsy, kind of a guy who couldn't really navigate in the world, a guy who was naturally the butt of every prank. A guy fit for nothing else but to be a fall guy. A guy, a Walter Mitty guy, who would be afraid to say boo in response. Yah, that was Leon Poole. Not a stone-cold killer bone in his body. Not like the guys who were nurtured into evil from the cradle practically. But see even Walter Mitty-type psychos have a breaking point, or rather points.

First Leon, a seemingly mild-mannered and loyal bank employee by day, was really the finger man for a heist of the bank's goods, you know money. See Leon had a honey of a wife, who like all wives likes nice things and you know they cost dough, real dough. So Leon took the famous bank robber Willie Sutton's advice and when where the dough was. In this case right at work. But like all Leon things, like everything he ever touched, the cops were  hip to his part in the crime in about two minutes and so they so ran to his apartment house with guns at the ready. They called him out but he refused their kind offer. Cornered like a rat he fired a shot through the door nicking a copper. They returned the fire and in the process wasted Leon's lovely wife, the only person who ever was kind to the guy. And then the madness started, started like some slow descent into hell. That turned out to be Leon's breaking point number two.

Of course Leon drew a dime at the state pen for the bank robbery and nicking the cop he wasn't arguing that, no at all. What started eating at him was that his wife fell at whim of the copper's guns. That was worthy of revenge. And so in those long lonely nights watching the days turn to night and back again Leon got himself worked up enough to figure a way to get even. He would take out not the cop, some lifer copper, a guy named Joe to give him a name, who liked his shiny badge, liked being a cop, but his wife. Yah, the old eye for an eye story, literally. He became a model prisoner and as part of that act got himself transferred out to an honor farm, a farm outside the walls. That was like giving candy to a baby.

Then the spree started, the relentless spree to get to that dirty copper, no, that dirty copper's wife back in the city. First off he murdered the guard who was supposed to use his services to unpack some product boxes from the truck at some town market. Leon cut him dead leaving him face down in some watery ditch. Leon then had wheels to make his getaway. He killed a hapless farmer for his truck, a change of clothes, and other provisions to get back to the big city and hi sweet revenge. In the big city, seeking refuge to plot his next moves, he killed an old army NCO right in front of his wife, a guy who had made fun of him when he was in the service. That was definitely not the day to be in Leon's crosshairs when he shed his Walter Mitty garb. An old score settled but not the big old score.

That was not the finale. This was. Leon headed to that copper's house. Joe's house. Of course Joe had the equivalent of the 82nd Airborne Division worth of coppers at the house. And of course too the cop's wife, some headstrong red-head, Rhonda to give her a name, who was tired of being a cop's wife, was not in said house but was innocently waking down the street to that house after a fight with her hubby cop when Leon made his move.  You know what happened, you know too that Leon Poole was strictly an amateur, strictly from jump street. And you know too why Leon Poole never made any American Psycho hall of fame.
