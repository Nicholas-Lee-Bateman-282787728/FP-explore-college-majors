I have many TV series DVDs that serve as bedtime stories most nights. He was an excellent actor, you always believed his character. Sometimes he was not as nice as one might wish, but you are on his side at the end, and besides, I just like looking at him.",1408665600,24,388,4.118421052631579

6397327,4,B00JZYJ7F6,"The Warner Archive site is selling pressed DVDs of this until they run out. Then, it will only be available as a made-to-order set (DVD-R). The prints are beautiful. They even include the ""tonight on 'Bret Maverick'"" teasers as they originally aired on NBC. (Unfortunately, there's no closed captioning.) Of course, the original ""Maverick"" series made James Garner a star. The Garner episodes of the original series hold up beautifully with excellent acting, writing, direction, and production values...James Garner is my favorite actor, and I enjoy anything he does. Still, ""Bret Maverick"" is a mixed bag. In addition to Garner's usual excellent work, the supporting cast (Ed Bruce, Ramon Bieri, David Knell, Richard Hamilton, Darleen Carr, Stuart Margolin, etc.) is also top notch. The major problem is with the conception of the 'Bret Maverick' character. Throughout the original series, it's emphasized time and time again that Maverick is an honest gambler who only does con jobs when he or a friend has been taken by some scoundrel. It's also frequently mentioned that Maverick's reputation is that of a man who can be trusted...In ""Bret Maverick,"" everyone thinks of the character as being an untrustworthy con man...And rightfully so. In the final episode, he spends the entire hour trying to bilk some unseen sucker out of a large sum of money just to make a profit. There's a twist ending, but the episode still leaves a sour aftertaste...Rumor has it that Garner had asked ""Maverick"" creator Roy Huggins to come on board to help improve the show for a proposed second season, but the series was cancelled after just 17 episodes...That's a shame because there is a great deal of potential to this series, and it does have its charms (mainly Garner and the rest of the cast). I gladly paid a rather hefty price for this DVD set, and I'm still glad I did...But, if you've never seen it, don't expect anything like the original series. It's closer in tone to ""Nichols,"" Garner's early 1970s series. That's not necessarily a bad thing; it's just not ""Maverick.""...As usual, there is no episode guide included with this set.

6397328,5,B00JZYJ7F6,"It's hard to believe that it has been more than 30 years since this series first aired and that it has only recently been released on DVD.

After winning big, including ownership of the Red Ox saloon, he decides to buy a local ranch and settle down.

""Bret Maverick"" was only on for one season, and the five-disc set includes all 17 episodes, but unfortunately no extras.

6397349,4,B00JZYJ7F6,"As a small child, I would watch westerns with my father.  This was in the late 50s and later when westerns were a very popular genre on TV.  Cheynne, Wagon Train, Bat Masterson, etc. and my favorite, Maverick.

Recently, I decided to revisit the original Maverick series and I realized what a really well-crafted show it was!  It was not the typical Western and Maverick was aptly described as an ""anti-hero"" considering he was a rambler and made his living winning at poker.  He was also not above a well-constructed con game.  In spite of this, however, Maverick did have morals and was not someone who took advantage of innocent people.

I bring this up as a prelude to my review of ""Bret Maverick.""  The stories are good and so is the casting.  I think this show would have gotten better and better if allowed to continue for additional seasons.  However, I felt a slight ""disconnect"" in that Maverick, in spite of helping the town out of several very tight spots, continued to be mistrusted and underestimated as the series continued.  He is not only proven correct in his original estimation of some situations, even when his original plan goes somewhat awry, he is able to think on his feet and get it to work anyway. Anyone watching the original Maverick series would come to the conclusion that, although Bret certainly knew his way around a con, he would not cheat to win a poker game and he was an indifferent ""gunslinger.""  The viewer could always count on Maverick, with his brains and abilities, coming out on top.  In a few of the episodes, Maverick managed to acquire money previously stolen by another, however, he always turned it in for the reward rather than keeping it for himself.  He clearly had scruples.  In ""Bret Maverick,"" he is not quite the upright character he was in his younger days.

But this series was enjoyable; the stories were sometimes just fun while others were a little more serious.  I have, in fact, watched a few of them more than once!",1485216000,9,1980,4.64367816091954

6397356,5,B00JZYJ7F6,"Watched the first episode last night. It was a delight seeing this show again after about thirty years. As with the Rockford files, James Garner was in his own element playing the somewhat shifty, but honest and trustworthy character Bret Maverick once again. The good down to earth writing makes it all the better.

6397380,5,B00JZYJ7F6,"Maverick didn't come there to lose, as Ed Bruce sang in the theme song. This reprisal of Garner's original western hero may have lasted only one season, but it was a very entertaining show. Garner brought along a few members Casting singer Ed Bruce as the co-star was a brilliant move. Bruce proved to be a fairly good actor and was the perfect foil to Garner's portrayal of the iconic Bret Maverick. While the episodes all take place in or around the town, as opposed to the perambulating in the original series, this suited the new format of a semi-retired Maverick who wanted to settle down and relax. It was unfortunate that the show was canceled after one season, despite good ratings. Garner's former Maverick co-star, Jack Kelly, who guest-starred on Rockford, made a surprise appearance at the end of the last episode, and was set to resume his role as Brother Bart had the show been renewed. As it stands, the series wraps things up effectively in the last episode, giving the feeling of closure that gives the reader the feeling of having completed a good novel. Garner would go one to play Mel Gibson's father in the movie version of the original series a few years later. He was a wonderful actor and projected authenticity and charm into every role he played. Do yourself a favor and get this complete series package and watch it over the course of a few days. It's to be savored, like a fine wine.",1445040000,14,1411,4.603174603174603
6397381,5,B00JZYJ7F6,"Excellent series, arrived in great condition.",1441324800,,45,6.666666666666667
6397382,5,B00JZYJ7F6,"Though short-lived, Bret Maverick was one of my favorite TV series of all time.  The plots were engaging, and the characters had charm and humor.  Sure, it was a simple western melodrama , but the addition of the various hustles gave it a similarity to the movie The Sting, also one of my favorites.  Granted, Ed Bruce wasn't really much of an actor, but he fit the part so well, or the part was written to fit him so well, that it didn't matter.  He made you like him.  Similarly, the vary talented Darleen Carr may have played the part a little over the top, but that's what a Western heroin is supposed to do.  Add her non-traditional attitude, and the character had some real snap.  Through it all, James Garner's natural likeability and the outstanding western character portrayals by the supporting cast made me enjoy it all the way through.

I do, however, think it's great that the show only ran one short season, because it didn't become tiresome.  Too many modern series run FAR too long.  They run out of surprises and become jaded.  This show was almost like a mini-series.  The last episode with Jack Kelly's reprise of the Bart Maverick role and the circumstances circling back around plot-wise made a nice little ""button"" on the end.  Take a bow, well done!",1440892800,2,1272,4.6

6397388,5,B00JZYJ7F6,"James Garner's western movies and shows were some of the best and most entertaining ever.

6397389,5,B00JZYJ7F6,"This is a great series and a wonderful sequel to the ""Maverick"" character. Now there have been a few complaints that this series doesn't really show the true Maverick, that ""this"" Bret wasn't the same from the original series. Well, thank goodness for that !! This show is ol'Bret 15 or 20 years later after riding the trail to ""who knows where"". Now, he has a found a perfect place to settle down. So, how does a guy like Bret Maverick maintain a beautiful hundred acre range he buys after winning the Red Ox saloon in a poker game and raising prized bulls? He does what anyone else would do. He plies the tools of his trade. OK, so he's not as altruistic as his younger days, but now he has a ranch to maintain and he's not as young. So, it stands to reason he would use what he learned over the years and applied it to his ""retirement"". It's a perfect story for the older and wiser Bret. So, I never understood the criticism, even from Jack Kelly himself (who was to join the series if there was a second season), regarding this. We all grow a little more cynical,self indulgent and self centered in our old age and BRET MAVERICK captured this brilliantly in a very beloved character. So much, in fact, that James Garner was nominated for a Emmy for the one and only season of this fine series. The rest of the show dealt with the townspeople of Sweetwater and how they absorbed the colorful personality of their trouble prone citizen whose past is somewhat catching up with him,as it happens to all of us. There is a fine supporting cast all the way though who play off Garner's humor nicely. If this was exactly like the original, it would not have made any sense and would be somewhat unbelievable. One grows older a lot faster in the Old West then one does nowadays,especially ""polishing a saddle"". This show had some flaws, but what show doesn't ? Plus, they weren't the kind you would notice or even care about because of the overall nature of the series itself and the skill of the cast to really pull it off. In some regards, it's like Mark Twain's LIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI, it's that good. So, Maverick fans, this is a MUST own for anyone who loves that iconic character brought to life by one of our finest actors, James Garner, who was able to ""retire"" both of his most well loved characters,Jim Rockford (in a series of eight movies made for TV) and,of course, Bret himself in this series and the feature length MAVERICK film with Mel Gibson. Yes, he was Bret in that film as witnessed in the final scene where Bret pushes back his hat and shaves his mustache talking to his boy, Brett (with two 'T's). The last we see Bret is relaxing in a stream bath. The last we see Bret in this series is hugging brother Bart. Either way, the late Mr Garner did his most famous character proud much to our enjoyment. So, enjoy.",1433116800,5,2829,4.400763358778626

6397401,5,B00JZYJ7F6,"Hot on the trail of Rockford Files, James Garner revived his Bret Maverick character. More emphasis on comedy, less on drama, better writing and direction.

Rockford files varied from episode to episode, frequently suffering from uneven writing and direction and probably budget restrictions and studio bigwig interference, a problem that plagued many TV series and movies through the 60's and 70's.

Bret Maverick benefited from higher production values (perhaps they saved some money not having to wreck a car every few episodes?) and strong writing through its first season. And never having made it to a second season, never had to jump the shark with the indignity of falling into a rut and desperate efforts to keep things going.",1421193600,7,735,5.168067226890757
