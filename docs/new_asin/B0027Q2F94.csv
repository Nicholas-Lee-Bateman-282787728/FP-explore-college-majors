8355048,5,B0027Q2F94,"""Untamed Earth: The Complete Series"" is wonderful, but unavailable for purchase anywhere in 2015

--------------------

I obtained a roughly one hour episode about Africa which is part of the overall ""Untamed Earth: Complete Series."" British star actor John Hurt is the narrator.

What I saw when I screened the VHS tape of it I got was and is wonderful. Better in its way than even the documentaries of Sir David Attenborough.

A ""complete"" set consisting of 13 DVD's with a total running time of 41 hours and 30 minutes was made, and some details of it are posted on the Amazon. Com site, but with the ""currently unavailable"" tag added.

The high quality of what I saw is incredible.

Reports I obtained about this show state that the main producer, Frederic Lepage, is a writer and producer of several hundred TV shows and documentaries.

He first made Untamed Africa (1996) and further similar documentaries set on other continents followed.

It is said that Frederic Lepage pioneered a new way of wildlife documentary making, working with director Laurent Frapat.

I read that Lepage's initial wildlife documentary work received worldwide success in more than one hundred countries.

Other series followed, making a magnum opus of almost sixty films and some of the greatest hits in nature films : Untamed Amazonia, Untamed Australia, Untamed Asia, Untamed America.

What happened to the companion episodes (the other 40 hours!) of this show?

Where are the details?

It appears to have been shown as a TV series.

Wild life and the ""untamed scene"" all over the world is covered in the ""complete set."" This includes Africa, Asia, Australia, and North America.

Mention of a ""re-release"" in 2011 was made on one vendor site I visited, but the same ""currently unavailable"" notice appeared there, also.

This is a high quality nature zoology documentary series created by big talent, but somehow has disappeared with almost no trace or description of it except the name of the complete set, nowhere to be found (2015).

Does anyone know where this nature documentary can be found, or where details about it are available?
