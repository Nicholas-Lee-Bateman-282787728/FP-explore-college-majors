8220620,3,B000VZC4LM,the video is very short and just brief clips put together from many shows.  I think it must have been created as a promo video to send out to potential venues.  On the other hand I bought this video after reading Nate Staniforth's book on magic which I absolutely LOVED.  Don't spend your money on this video but DO rush out and buy his book!,1524009600,,342,4.230769230769231
8220621,5,B000VZC4LM,"After watching Spellbinder, I was excited to be able to purchase this next installment from Nate Staniforth.

He didn't disappoint.

Nate has a humble charisma and a deep passion for what he does. Any magician can benefit from watching his footage as it strips away magic right down to its essentials: the performer and the audience. You will quickly see why people instantly love Nate from the moment he walks on stage. Yes, his magic is great, but his personality elevates his performances from magic routines to magic experiences.",1364774400,,533,4.977528089887641
8220622,5,B000VZC4LM,"The real title should ""Nate Stani-awesome-forth.""  His haircut alone is worth the price of admission.  You should probably buy several copies.  After watching his DVD my wife and I drove to Hoboken to see his show.  Let me describe one of the effects: Nate walks on stage carrying a large wire cage filled with all sorts of birds: chickens, ducks, parakeets, you name it.  Then he has a spectactor (CHOSEN COMPLETELY AT RANDOM) come on stage, blindfold him, and while he is blindfolded pick a bird (COMPLETELY AT RANDOM) and put it into a ""Prediction bag.""  Still blindfolded, Nate instructs the audience member to hold out her cupped hands in front of him.  After a moment of tense concentration Nate began to cough violently.  His body shaking, he expelled mouthfuls of wet feathers into the stupified spectator's open hands.  Then, removing the blindfold, Nate proclaims ""OPEN THE PREDICTION BAG.""  The spectator opens the canvas bag to find that the bird she had predicted was missing feathers from its left forewing.  THE MISSING FEATHERS EXACTLY MATCHED THOSE WHICH NATE HAD COUGHED UP.  Aside from a mild case of psittacosis, it was a truly magical evening.  Five stars.",1275609600,,1177,4.9438775510204085

Upon first seeing nate perform on video, I was immediately captivated by his stage presence. There is something about nate that I can not explain. When someone is on stage, performing, speaking, anything at all, it is KEY to keep the intrest of your audience and control the room. Nate does more than control the room. He keeps each and every mind of every spectator stuck in whatever gear he pleases. The control and energy flowing through each performance is outstanding. Everything to the production quality of this DVD is top notch. It's 15 bucks. Its a steal. Every magician, Every entertainer should own a copy of this not to just keep and have collect dust on the shelf, but to be inspired, learn, and get re acquainted with a down to earth performer, and performing style that more of us need in this day and age. A Job well done.
