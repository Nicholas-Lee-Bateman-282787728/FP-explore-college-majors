8505368,5,B006W4KVCA,My 2 and 4 year old grandsons just loved it.  I like the idea of having all 3 of their favorite characters on the same dvd.,1369612800,,123,3.730769230769231
8505369,5,B006W4KVCA,"My son has loved Bob the Builder since he was watching TV about age 1, he sits there quietly focused on Bob and all his friends.  I bought this video because over time he has grown to like the other UK cartoons and their characters  SAM and Thomas.  And to be honest these cartoons beat out U.S. cartoons for kids  Sorry Nickloden and Disney Junior.
We use this video in a car based Dvd player to keep the kids quiet and content in the back of the car hours of continuous playing  great for short or long road trips.

Love it",1369353600,,525,4.148514851485149
8505370,4,B006W4KVCA,"This is a great DVD for our collection and while geared toward boys my daughter enjoys the episodes just as well. The two episodes from Thomas & Friends help to teach about pride and when to ask for help as well as when to give it. Two episodes from Fireman Sam are great for learning about the life of a fireman as well as safety! Then finishing up with two episodes of Bob the Builder teaches about big responsibilities and how eve big diggers (or older folks) sometimes get lonely just like little ones. Then also to be slow and cautious, because fast is not always best and efficient. Every episode comes back to friendship and teamwork in a wonderful way. Through out many lessons of value for your little one to learn while being entertained and giving this preschoolers mama just a minute.

At this time you can also find it on digital download and on demand, so whatever you preference go get it!

Look for Volume Two in June!
