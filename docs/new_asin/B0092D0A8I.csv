They could have run this thru any movie program and improved the color and darkness. Excluding the night scenes of which there are many, this is generally too dark. There is far too much whistling which gets irritating in the second half. I want to hear a working steam engine not one whistle after another.
This was a beautiful engine but that rarely comes across in the dark grainy picture, altho there are some good pacing shots in the second half. I feel cheated for the money I spent.",1482969600,,586,4.537735849056604
