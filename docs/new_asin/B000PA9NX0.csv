The dancing is superb (Mikhail Sharkov as Mercutio or Court Jester in SL, Alexander Vetrov as Tybalt and Blue Bird in Sleeping Beauty, in addition to Irek Mukhamedov and Natalia Bessmertnova).  The sets, costumes, staging, choreography, and the entirety of the productions are brilliant, and doesn't compare to a lot of the current productions of the classics.  Some can't appreciate the beauty of the traditional Bolshoi, but it's absolutely stunning in my view.  SO GLAD these performances were archived!!!",1282262400,11,642,5.38
