293223,5,6300271307,"This movie is a classic! Whoopie really shines in this movie and her cast.... oh my! Bob Goldthwait (who can be very very funny!) was great as Whoopie's best friend and confidant, finally something where he doesn't  SCREAM. The inept cops (John Goodman and Anne De Salvo) were the epitome of  the ""dumb"" NY cops. Not that they are...just they are depicted  that way in many movies. And G.W. Bailey, who you will remember from Police  Academy movie fame, does a great job as Whoopie's Evil Parole Officer. They  all come together to make this movie one of the best, you'll laugh and  giggle constantly.
Basically the plot is Whoopie is a Burglar out on  Parole, her parole officer (a goober!) gets her to do one more job. As you  probably guessed, all goes wrong. She gets all wrapped up in Police chases,  dirty parole officers, lousy dentists and they all come together to make  you laugh one more time!",960595200,2,904,4.59375

293241,1,6300271307,"BURGLAR another classic Whoopi Goldberg film waiting for a blu-ray release, or at least a proper Widescreen dvd release
Tragically Warners have only given the film a 1:33:1 full screen transfer on dvd
plus a 2.0 stereo mix only no extras not even the original Trailer which is pathetic
picture quality is Good but not excellent still very Grainy to watch
which means Warners only slightly Digital remastered the quality
the only DVD version in 1:85:1 ratio is the Warners Australian dvd which is ALL REGIONS nayway
and in keepcase packaging not the old Snapcase
so until this film gets a blu-ray release but don't hold your breath waiting
it's better to buy the Warners AUS DVD you can get it off ebay Australia
4 stars for the film

I walked out of my room a changed person, and realized what I wanted to do with my life from that moment on; Be an Actress. But not just any actress, I wanted to act along side Whoopi Goldberg. She has been my childhood hero since I was 4 years old, and I wanted to be an movie star then as well, but as the years went by, I forgot what I wanted to do with my life, and was uninspired by many things...until the night I watched this movie, which I think is the funniest movie ever made! Comedy is my first love, and drama next, but since that defining moment, I've become a very good singer and screenplay writer, and am signed with a record company out of Hollywood. Next is films. Whoopi is still my childhood hero. She may say she's retired, but she hasn't met me yet.

I just remember that I was sorely disappointed when it came out because I'm a fan of the series of books that it's based on.  I suppose I should say ""loosely based on,"" because this doesn't even come close to the books.  The books were written by Lawrence Block and featured an aging Jewish man named Bernie Rhodenbarr.  Rumor has it that Bruce Willis bailed on the production, so it was given to Whoopi.  Not a bad decision, I suppose.  But not a good one, either.  If you like harmless mystery/comedies from the decade of The Mullet, then you will enjoy this.
By the way, the books are also available here at Amazon, so you ought to do yourself a favor and pick them up, too.",1068249600,,751,4.359712230215828

It was a disappointment in some ways, yet contained some hilarious moments. Scenes include the female policewoman falling backwards after attempting to kick in Whoopi's front door. The best scene is when Whoopi, disguised as a home maid, breaks into the rich man's home and steals his goodies - and nearly gets caught.
DVD EVALUATION: Warner have released this in Full Frame which is a disappointment. A Widescreen version is, of course, preferred by DVD fanatics! Sound is 2.0 Dolby Digital. No special features are included on the disc.",1041811200,13,700,4.793388429752066
293383,4,6300271307,"While I agree that this is not Whoopi's best movie, it is blithe comic fun that's good for two hours or so of pleasant distraction.  Whoopi's irreverent character, Bernie, is a reformed thief forced to do one last job to pay off a blackmailing cop.  Along for the ride is the divine Lesley Ann Warren as a nutty dentist, Anne DeSalvo and John Goodman as two bumbling cops always a step behind, and Bobcat Goldthwait in what is probably his only tolerable performance.
Tons of profanity, absurd plot twists, and an easily-descerned plot make for a fun farce that is guaranteed to make you laugh.",1007769600,10,594,4.647619047619048

293385,1,6300271307,"Burglar is your typical D movie.  It has more bads than goods.  Actually, it has a ton of bads.  When I sat down to watch this film, I didn't expect Oscar worthy material.  But, I did expect something that would at least halfway amuse me or even keep my interest.  I didn't get either of them.  Yes, the acting was all right.  Whoopie Goldberg is a great comedic actress, but she should really be a little choosier when it comes to picking what movies to be in.  Burglar moved at a snails pace, and that is putting it lightly.  There were way too many coincidences.  There would just happen to be a bag with valuables in it laying around, or there would just by pure coincidence be a motorcycle with the keys in it parked in an alley practically yelling at you to be stolen.  Also, the directing was terrible.  The director did not explain things well at all.  The only reason I stuck around to the end was because to see if my prediction of who the killer was right.  And of course, I was right.  The plot was paper-thin.  I don't like a movie when I know the ending a quarter into the film.  Overall, Burglar is a definite waste of time that now has the title of ""most predictable movie ever.""  1 Star",992131200,5,1203,4.247787610619469
293386,4,6300271307,"Some reviewers like Leonard Maltin have one problem... They tend to over analyze some films. Especially Comedy films. Burglar was not made to be an award winning film. It's for one of those friday evenings after a stressed out week at work and all you want to do is put your feet up have a drink, and pop a tape into the vcr. Well in those situations Buglar is the perfect film to chose. It's about a theif (goldberg) that is just trying to cut clean and just run a used bookstore. But a Cop has evidence that will convict her and put her away for a long time. So he wants her to pay him off which send her into another spree of theft. But she witnesses a murder and everything points to her.... All Whoopie fans will enjoy it.",986860800,5,727,4.163120567375887

7808196,4,6300271307,"A fun adaptation of (mostly) ""The Burglar in the Closet"" by Lawrence Block.

(Bobcat's character is from a later book.)

With the sequel-fever Hollywood has, you'd think this would have led to several sequels. It's a good movie, and  Lawrence Block's Burglar series is (so far) 11 books.

Offhand, the only scene I don't like is the car chase with the motorcycle and cop cars.

My mind tends to drift during car chases. Plus I can't enjoy seeing cop cars smash into each other unless the cops are the movie's bad-guys.

It's time for a Bernie Rhodenbarr comeback.

Whoopi Goldberg and Bobcat Goldthwait probably aren't much of a box office draw anymore, but Bobcat seems to be a pretty good director, so even if they hire a new cast,  Bobcat could take over as director.

In the books, Bernie was a man, so you could make a sequel with Whoopi or another actress, or start over with a male actor.",1505692800,,895,4.54375
