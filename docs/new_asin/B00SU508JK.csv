8699312,1,B00SU508JK,This product is defective.  I am trying to view the DVD for a class and the first lesson played but now into the second lesson it only went about half way and totally stopped.  It seems to be scratched.  Plus the second DVD looks the same.  Can this be replaced.,1453939200,4,262,4.18
