2900468,5,B000TGXB4M,"I have seen every episode of this show and it never really gets old. The actors/characters are hillarious. The first season was great but then again all of the seasons were. It's fun and funny. I just hope that when they do release this is will include plenty of extras, a high quality widescreen transfer and completely unedited versions.",1227225600,36,339,4.762711864406779

2900490,5,B000TGXB4M,"Shame this is no longer for sale!

This was an original funny sitcom with 4 actors you'd think would not be funny but in the series, they were great.

A great script, a great setting and funny moments. Shame this DVD nor any other seasons are available.",1394496000,8,253,4.361702127659575
2900491,5,B000TGXB4M,I am still waiting for this show to come out on dvd or Blu-ray. Very funny show and I miss seeing re-runs! Does anyone know when we will be able to purchase all the seasons?,1394236800,6,173,3.9714285714285715
2900492,5,B000TGXB4M,"I personally would rate this show along side of Friends & Seinfeld.

I never saw a ""bad"" episode.  Naturally, some were better than others but I found the entire series as a whole an excellent show that was perfectly cast.

It is similar to the old Odd Couple in that you have Greg & Kim are well off, educated people and Kim's totally opposite sister (Christine) and her husband (Jimmy) live in the guest house.

The show never gets old because the the laughs grow as their families grow which opens up completely new story lines.

When you see the one where Jimmy thinks his mother in law is Christine and grabs her rear you will laugh as much on the 10th time you see it as you did the first.

I love the show, I love the characters, and I can't wait for it to be released on DVD (preferably blu ray).",1385856000,11,804,4.222222222222222
2900493,5,B000TGXB4M,"I know with all the intellectual property laws and such that the series Yes Dear would need a houseful of permits, since they used so many songs in thier show. But I plead with whomever has the rights to re-release this show on DVD to do so. It was one of those series that just hit everything right, from a top-notch cast to bright and terrific writing. No humour to wince at here...it was pure comedy with heart and that is why it will remain timeless in its unique approach to American sitcoms.
Please oh please re-release this outstanding show.",1374624000,27,548,4.49

8209401,5,B000TGXB4M,"Sadly, I did not appreciate this show until it was showing re-runs. This show was sooo under the radar and sooo under appreciated. During its run, I had no interest in watching it at all and then I watched a few re-runs and I was hooked. The same thing happened with King of Queens. But unlike King of Queens there is nowhere that I know of that you can buy a season of Yes Dear or even stream it. Me sooo sad ",1487808000,2,410,4.0

8209405,5,B000TGXB4M,"Writing this review because, in a bout of aimlessness concerning an inability to pinpoint any form of entertainment I'd like to purchase, I finally remembered how much I love this show and would love to own the entire series on DVD. So I searched for this item, but came up empty-handed. Very disappointing. This is such an excellent sitcom. Underrated in the sense that while most everyone loves the show, few seem to bring it up in conversation. Nonetheless, it was a major hit for the network, and I'm baffled as to why this hasn't been made available, even with the few musical royalties that would have to be negotiated. One of Greg Garcia's best pieces of work, no doubt. Sad to see that the series' availability is still practically nonexistent ten years after the show ended. I'd love to see a DVD release, but I'd gladly settle for digital distribution via Amazon or even Netflix.",1467676800,20,889,4.705128205128205
