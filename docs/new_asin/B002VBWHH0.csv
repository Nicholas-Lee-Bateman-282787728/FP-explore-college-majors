3994238,5,B002VBWHH0,This show brings back memories of me watching these shows as a kid that aired on Nick in the 90's. I am so glad they put all three seasons of Doug on DVD and looking forward for more classic Nick shows on DVD. The item arrived on time and the package was factory sealed. I did not have any problem with the quality of the picture or sound. I would recommend anybody who is a classic nick fan to purchase this DVD!!,1265587200,,414,4.060975609756097
3994239,5,B002VBWHH0,"I was ecstatic to pre-order Doug seasons one and two from Amazon's Made On Demand DVD Create A Space. Watching the first two seasons took me right back to my childhood and reminded me how truly fun and well written children's television used to be. After watching those first two seasons I was worried Amazon might not release the remaining seasons so I can't say how happy I am to know that Doug's third and fourth seasons are available. The third season contains the following 26 eleven minute episodes (13 full half hour episodes altogether):

27 Doug's Fat Cat/ Doug and Patti P.I.
28 Doug is Slave for a Day/Doug Rocks the House
29 Doug's Comic Collaberation/Doug's Pet Capades
30 Doug's Career Anxiety/Doug's Big Brawl
31 Doug's Huge Zit/Doug Flies A Kite
32 Doug and the Weird Kids/Dougs Behind the Wheel
33 Doug's New Teacher/Doug On First
34 Doug's Cartoon/ Doug's Monster Movie
35 Doug's Hot Property/Doug the Little Liar
36 Doug Inc./Doug's Nightmare on Jumbo Street
37 Doug's Shock Therapy/Doug Is Hamburger Boy
38 Doug and the Yard of Doom/Doug's Garage Band
39 Doug's Great Beet War/Doug's Magic Act

This is such a well written show. A lot of shows nowadays aimed at preteens focus too much on the wrong things. They still try to have a lot lessons, I'll give them credit for that, but they always make the main character's lives too perfect, more perfect than I feel your average preteen feels their life is. They've stopped trying to give the audience something to relate to and started giving a young impressionable audience something to buy into. Shows nowadays, in my opinion, are rarely about relating to the common experience most of us have of feeling like underdogs, slightly out of place and just wanting so badly for a few things to go right. Doug is such a show and deserves credit for being such, it relates to it's audience but never patronizes to us and takes every issue as seriously as we did or might have at that age.

Anyone who may be worried about the quality of these episodes because they are DVD-R, I wouldn't. Like I've stated, I own the first two seasons of this show on Amazon DVD-R and they play great on all my DVD players. On top of that I own several other Nickelodeon series released on DVD-R such as Rugrats, Hey Arnold! and Rocko's Modern Life and they all play great. I tend to be a rather uptight person about things feeling 'of quality' and have never been bothered by these sets. The episode quality is that or better of the shows when they originally aired in the nineties.

That said the sets do have very simple DVD menus and come in very simple DVD cases with rather basic artwork but it all looks nice enough and gets the job done. My only issue with these Nickelodeon sets, me being a purist, is that I would prefer the option of watching the opening theme before every episode but on these sets it only plays before the first episode on each disc. I believe they do this to preserve the quality of the episodes because of compression issues that could start arising and I'm aware that most people skip show openings anyway, so that said it's forgivable (despite the fact that this show's theme is so great). The other thing is not to expect any sort of special features, just the episodes themselves.

Though it is a bit of a shame to not see proper DVD sets released of such a great series, if you're like me and many others and love these episodes you'll want to be able to own them and this is a great way to do it and to possibly convince Nickelodeon there would be a market for their older series in proper sets. I still hope that one day we'll see shows like Doug and Rugrats in proper sets with possible special features and remastered quality but until then I can't recommend this product enough. FIVE STARS based on the quality of the previous sets and the quality of the episodes themselves. Thanks for your time.

*After watching all the episodes I personally have experienced a slight glitching that lasts two or three seconds where the sound and picture both show static and interference before resolving on the episode Doug's New Teacher. It's very minor and I am hoping it's only on my disc and will be resolved by Amazon replacing the disc but just wanted to put that out there. It would hardly deter me from purchasing this set though and I'm confident Amazon will do their best to resolve it.",1257897600,16,4371,4.55470737913486
