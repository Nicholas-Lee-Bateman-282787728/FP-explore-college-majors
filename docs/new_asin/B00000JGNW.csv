1232132,4,B00000JGNW,"This video fills in a huge gap in my collection. I'd seen the Woodstock movie and always wanted to see more of Jimi's performance. This release does not disappoint. The music is phenomenal, Jimi looks and sounds great.  Not much of the usual naked hippies at the waterhole footage. 99.9% of the  video is Jimi on stage.
My only (minor) complaints about this video is  with the way it was editted and packaged. Contrary to what the Amazon  description says, there are no liner notes included. In fact there is no  real information other than the song list on the cover. This is especially  disappointing since the audio CD of the same show includes a fantastic  liner notes book (including shots of Jimi's hand written set list and words  to a song about Woodstock). I found it a bit sad and confusing that the  Hendrix estate would finally release movie footage that is obviously going  to be consumed by hardcore Jimi fans and not bother to include any liner  notes at all (again, especially since the audio CD has top rated notes).  The audio CD liner notes provide some much needed background about the  musician lineup (not the Experience, but a brand new first time in public  line up - Gypsy Sun and Rainbows, the songs played, problems with the PA,  problems faced when it came time to edit the tapes, etc..
Also  disappointing was the fact that the DVD contains only 57 minutes from the  original 140 minute set. The audio CD trims out two songs and some dead air  to bring the set down to just under two hours. About 90 seconds of  ""Message to Love"" are played over the opening titles and about 60  seconds of ""Hear My Train Comin"" are played over the closing  credits. Several of the songs also appear out of sequence from the orignal  set. I would have been willing to pay an additional $10 or $20 to have had  the whole show intact.
That being said, I can't rave enough about the  footage that is included. This was drawn from the original footage shot by  Michael Wadliegh and company (of the Oscar winning Woodstock movie fame).  Jimi played in the morning so it is shot in daylight and is vibrant with  light and color. Jimi's playing is unbelievable and every guitarist will  want to watch this for the great tight shots of his technique. Anyone who  loves his music should find this to be a great historical document that is  full of some great music (especially the jams: ""Jam Back at the  House"", ""Woodstock Improvisation"", and ""Villanova  Junction"").
Buy this and if you are a real fanatic, get the audio CD  box set too.",949968000,11,2541,4.550884955752212
1232133,4,B00000JGNW,"I have watched and listened to this DVD about six times so far; each time I grumble at the editors for the super close-up shots of Jimi's face. I can count his molars! The entire video is one big close-up. I can only guess at  what the other band members are doing, since we rarely see them. But two of  the most important missing parts are Jimi's feet. What the heck was he  doing with pedals and other electronics to make such as fasinating sound? I  wanted to know! I think the synchronization of sound to video also is a bit  lacking, but not as bad as some noteworthy messes (Yessongs).
But it was  the fingers, the hands, the words and the sound that first attracted me to  this DVD, and I am not dissapointed. There is no viable comparison to any  living individual. Jimi left a magnificent work of art and the editors  captured it for us to experience 30 years later. Pretty cool.",942883200,27,888,4.333333333333333

1232144,5,B00000JGNW,"If you like great rock and roll music, and especially if you like or play rock guitar, this is the one video you need to own. Jimi Hendrix was the greatest rock and roll guitarist ever, not just because of his playing or voice, but also his writing and performance. I think this was his best performance. Playing in front of a huge audiance seems to make people play better. I have owned this video on VHS, DVD and now Blu Ray. of course the greater quality of Blu Ray is wonderful. There is one downside. This release does not include the bonus video included with the latest DVD. Without the bonus disk, this is only about 1/3 of his performance. With it, it is very roughly half. For refrence, his entire Woodstock performance is one song too many to fill two CDs. I think the bonus video was shot on an early black and white reel to reel video tape recorder. I suppose since it wasn't on film they decided not to include it with the DVD. I wish they would release a version of this video with his entire performance. Every different version of this performance I have bought is edited differently, uses different shots. I wish I could have the entire selection of film so I could edit my own version.
Until the release of this movie, I think in the 1980's, the only video you could see of Jimi at Woodstock was his playing the Star Spangled Banner in the movie Woodstock. If that is all you have ever seen of this performance, do yourself a favor and see this video. The SSB does not do this performance justice.",1422748800,,1516,4.360424028268551

Hendrix didn't sing them, other band members did, and therefore Experience Hendrix didn't want to include them. They essentially over-ruled Jimi, who felt the songs were important enough to include in his set.
It's disgusting that Larry Lee's guitar parts are practically audibly non-existant and the two songs are missing, because they don't want to pay royalties. What's worse, though, is that they claim that this is the complete set, which is simply a lie.",1293580800,35,574,5.052631578947368

1232157,3,B00000JGNW,"I just wanted to add a few notes regarding a number of questions that arise in the reviews. The percussion of Juma Sultan and Jerry Velez and the rhythm guitar of Larry Lee is inaudible on the concert DVD (against Jimi's wishes obviously) due to the producers wishes (the reasons may have come from legal/financial issues). There are many good quality bootlegs of the 'real' mix which is actually rather good, with clear percussion and rhythm guitar. In my opinion this adds to the sound of the gig immensely (it's much more playful and inventive - not to mention fuller sounding).
Larry Lee actually sings on two tracks that have never found an official release. Did you know that Jimi Hendrix played 'Gypsy Woman' in tribute to one of his favourite guitarists and performer's, Curtis Mayfield for example? If you're a Hendrix nut you'll also have heard 'Mastermind' too, which was a Larry Lee composition. Presumably these very good and one off songs from the Hendrix canon were left off due to licencing, to some extent? However the real concern is; Why on earth somebody who looks after the Hendrix Estate  trying to re-write Jimi Hendrix's life by censoring it in such a way?? The filmed footage concentrates in Jimi so much because when we see Juma and Larry playing away wthout any sound it makes no sense, so the edits try and cut them out of shot. This may be why there is no widescreen version?

It's dissaponting that someone thought this was a good idea. Personally I won't re-purchase this until they address the sound mix at least.

By the way Larry's very good guitar playing is kept clearly in the mix of 'Jam Back At The House' - even Jimi couldn't sound like 3 guitar players at once!",1243987200,,1702,4.647840531561462

1232160,5,B00000JGNW,"I'm giving this 5 starts because its Hendrix.

It seemed like the first part of the concert Hendrix was struggling to get things going. But once he did, that was all she wrote!

When I was 11 years old, I snuck into a theater to see Woodstock. I had little interest in the other performers (although I liked many of them very much). I was really only interested in Hendrix. When he finally appeared, I was overwhelmed by the power of his performance. Listening to that unbeliveable music, watching his hands; nothing in the rest of the festival could compare to it. It was beyond mere loud rock music. It was something akin to a religious experience. Now, almost four decades later, the power of that experience remains undiminished.

To this day, I can't listen to his Star Spangled Banner without getting chills. In that moment, in that short piece of unexpected unrehersed music, Hendrix grabbed the whole of the USA by the neck, looked it in the eye and said ""You broke your covenent with God, and your promise to your people!"" Who else could have bore the weight of such a musical statement?

We should be grateful that a Hendrix once walked the earth. With all due respect to Beck, Reid, Vai, and others; when we speak of the realm of heavily amplified electric guitar, in the end, there is only Hendrix.
There will never be another like him.",1108166400,6,1348,4.580912863070539
1232161,4,B00000JGNW,"The concert is legendary, but the DVD package fall short of definitive.

Here is what you get:
This DVD contains 10 full length songs from Hendrix's Woodstock concert, namely: ""Fire"", ""Izabella"", ""Red House"", ""Jam Back at the House"", ""Voodoo Child"", ""Star Spangled Banner"", ""Purple Haze"", ""Woodstock Improvisation"", and ""Villanova Junction.""  A small segment of, ""Message to Love"" and, ""Hear My Train a Comin'""  is played over the opening and closing credits respectfully.

Here is what you don't get:
1. There is no fotage of Hendrix playing six songs from the concert, namely: ""Message to Love"", ""Spanish Castle Magic"", ""Lover Man"", ""Hear My Train a Comin'"", ""Foxey Lady"", and ""Hey Joe.""
2. The set list song order has been rearranged.  This is unfortunate because there was a natural flow of momentum with the original song order.  The concert started off loose and Jamming, then it tightened and rocked in the middle of the set, the climax being, ""Star Spangled Banner.""  At the end of the original set list Jimi calms the mood down with, ""Villanova Junction.""  For some odd reason Alan Douglas enjoys reconfiguring Jimi's set lists, his trademark is to start all concerts with, ""Fire"", Jimi NEVER opened with this song.
3. The picture has not been cleaned up.  Although the image quality is very good it would be nice to see a widescreen version of this concert.  The Woodstock movie is now available on DVD widescreen so why not this concert?
4. The original audio mix was used on this DVD.  The two percussionists are inaudible and Jimi is mixed right up front.
5. There are no DVD extras, no interviews, no 5.1 mix, nothing.
6. There is NO BOOKLET contained in the DVD package.  A booklet might answer some questions about the missing songs and the audio mix.  Maybe the percussionists were not recorded to audio tape?  Maybe some of the songs were not filmed?  Maybe the original negative has been damaged or lost?  Maybe the original muli-track audio tape has been lost?  A small booklet with the history of this concert and DVD release could answer these questions.",1097884800,18,2076,4.868945868945869

The leader chose the musicians he wanted in his group, for better or worse. Let's hear it the way it went down, please!  (This recalls Jon Astley's edited tracks / remix of Eric Clapton's heroin-era Rainbow concert: the origininal album, murk and all, trumps the cd!)

Finally, Lee was already a fine guitarist in his own right who had already and would continue to work in Memphis with numerous musicians,including Al Green among others.  This dvd should be accurate document, not a star-trip for casual Hendrix fans!",1092268800,3,819,4.963503649635037

1232164,5,B00000JGNW,"This is certainly Jimi's most famous performance with the exception on Monterey in 1967. Again re-inventing himself he becomes the Gypsy Sun, psychedelic leader and captain of the rag-tag outfit of musicians known as the Rainbows. I've been to the concert site in Bethel several times and you can still feel the electricity Jimi and the other artists and 500,000 members of the Woodstock Nation created that famous weekend on Max Yasgur's farm 35 years ago. Although a lot of this concert is experimental jamming, Jimi absolutely goes into the stratosphere on the best version of ""Voodoo Child (Slight Return)"" I ever heard (or in this case heard AND saw!). Watching him take flight on the long solo is purely the sickest thing I ever heard. Nobody should be so gifted to make it look THAT EFFORTLESS! The blistering solo alone makes this trip to Yasgur's farm well worth the price of admission. Of course THE most famous moment of all is the bombastic rendition of ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" in which the Gypsy Sun made his very own. ""Purple Haze,"" ""Red House,"" ""Izabella"" and ""Fire"" are among the more well known numbers Gypsy Sun And Rainbows delivers to the remainder of the Woodstock Nation early that Monday morning. The only bad thing about the DVD is that it's not the complete set. However, it sure does deliver and never fails to take me ""back to the Garden"" and feel the real spirit of what it was like to wake up to the Gypsy Sun And Rainbows and take a soaring ride to rock n' roll's most famous event.",1081209600,3,1516,4.66044776119403

It is all about average.  The reason the DVD is so good is simply because it's Jimi playing.  Anyone that has a respect for the guitar will love it.  It is simply amazing what he is able to do with the electric guitar.  Just watching this DVD provides a feeling of how amazing of a player he was and how revolutionary he was.  If you love bluesy rock type music, you'll love watching Jimi Hendrix play his guitar.",1077926400,,573,4.4
1232166,4,B00000JGNW,"Allow me to start off by saying I am among the large majority of rock music fans to believe Hendrix to be the best guitarist of all time.  That being said however, there are relatively few DVD's available showcasing Hendrix.  Bnd of Gypsies: Live at the Fillimore East is an excellent one.  This dvd however , is not EXCELLENT.  At least, not by Hendrix standards.  Here's the main reason for that.  There is no option for Dolby 5.1 Surround.  Based on modern Music DVD standards, this is unnaceptable.  I have many music dvd's, and every single one has D5.1 SS.  The lack of this option dissapointed me greatly, because although the sound isn't bad, it isn't nearly as good as it could be.  But this is not a BAD dvd.  It simply is not as good as other Hendrix DVD's, such as the aforementioned Live at the Fillimore East.  The songs are often very messy, although there are excellent instances such as the guitar work on Voodoo Child.  All in all, worth the money if you are a die hard Hendrix fan as I am, but if you want to truly Experience Hendrix (no pun intended) I suggest you opt for Live at the Fillimore East instead, as it has excellent performances AND an excellent biography.",1072396800,,1189,4.449074074074074
1232167,5,B00000JGNW,"Being a guitarist as well as someone who is appreciative of music written and played by Hendrix, I purchased this DVD with the intention of learning more about the man. I had seen other footage of Hendrix, usually in some documentary form and even then he was shown only in fast clips. This DVD contains footage that is quite the opposite.
Within the first few seconds of watching Hendrix play, my heart rate increased noticeably. At home, by myself, watching this DVD, I heard myself audibly mentioning my disbelief of his skill countless times. The man played the guitar like some mutated extension of his own body, and at one point I wondered if he had systematically gone up every fret on every string and memorized every note and its exact location, so that when he played he could run through his library of tones in random but orderly fashion.
The camera swoops across the crowd on occasion. It is the end of Woodstock, and there are only a few people left... blankets and debris litter the field behind them (it is then that I realize that my experience at various Lolapaloozas was not truly unique). At the beginning of the Hendrix set, most of them look bored. I can't help but wonder if half of them are still there because they don't have a ride home, or if they are so exhausted from the past few days that they don't know what else to do. They couldn't possibly know that they had just taken part in a truly historic event, so the significance of the Hendrix closing set (with his hastily named ""Band of Gypsies"") was probably lost on them.
But the crowd changes quite a bit as the show goes on. At first, Hendrix seems as if he is some crazy showboating guitarist with a knack for rockin' out the blues. But then it intensifies with unceasing persistence. Mitch Mitchell, the drummer, is banging out incredible rythms while looking like he has just run a marathon, but he keeps going, feeding off Hendrix.  Hendrix falls in and out of solo-induced trances - or possibly trance-induced solos - while occasionally looking to his band mates for signals to fall back into verse. At one point he drifts so far away he is lost in minutes of feedback-ridden wailing and crunching when he suddenly pops out of it and decides to introduce the rest of the band, as if he regretted his apparent selfishness of sound and wanted to give his colleagues a chance. By then, there are people in the crowd that are bouncing about with limp arms in that way that is so utterly hippie. There are a few young men with thick-rimmed glasses watching Hendrix with mouth open, moving ever so slightly to his every string-bending note.
And then he falls into Voodoo Child, a fast paced version full of 4-5 mintue jams that put Phish to shame. By now the show is at full intensity, and at one point Hendrix says ""You can leave if you want to... we're just jammin'."" He falls in and out of the song, collapsing into The Star Spangled Banner. I've heard the audio of this before, but the film changed my entire perspective on it. On the verse 'And the rockets red glare', Hendrix starts ripping random tones out of the Fender that I suddenly recognized to be launching rockets, followed by sounds of 'the bombs bursting in air'. Amazing. And *then* he goes into Purple Haze. I was so absorbed I forgot where I was and I felt light-headed. And then he is lost again, playing with the guitar as if he was at home in his basement, experimenting with tones and chords, and they fall into a jam from it, where somehow everyone in the band knew when and where it would start and end.
Phenomenal. I've had the ""Who is the best guitarist ever"" debate before. I've gone back and forth from Santanna to Clapton to Page to Hendrix. No more. I have decided. It is Hendrix, and I don't care if anyone thinks it is cliche. The man was an anomaly... someone who knew the guitar like his own hands, and never thought twice about it. So the reader of this review is asking: ""Should I buy it or not?"". I say: ""Buy it. View it. Be glad that even though you weren't at Woodstock, you at least have this to give you some idea of what it was like.""",1068249600,8,4112,4.453580901856764

The DVD I thought was great when they cut the other members out because if you listen on the woodstock CD it sounds like a mess. It was better with Jimi, Mitch, and Billy the DVD was edited fine. I wish they would have added more to the DVD that was my big dissapointment why not all the footage? Well all I know is the full concert would have been a bigger experience than this DVD but the woodstock performence form on this DVD is fine I guess could be better. When it comes down to it the music was powerful I love the way they start the DVD and end it.

1232171,5,B00000JGNW,"This should be rated 10 stars for the music. Hendrix was never better. The band never tighter, and it is as exciting for me today as it was in 1969 when my brother and I made it into Yasgur's farm after working all weekend in Saratoga, to catch and stand in awe of this remarkable and prodigious artist. Jimi's guitar playing was incendiary and the film puts to bed the notion that he was some burned out hippie doing pyrotechnics instead of playing music. This is where Coltrane left off and the telepathy between Hendrix and Mitchell was extraordinary. They are reminiscent, or perhaps better, the extension of the trail blazed by Trane and Rashied Ali, and inspite of Buddy Miles firm grounding of the band in the blues, the point of the matter is that Mitchell and Hendrix were each other's colleagues in every respect of this extraordinary adventure, first as the Experience, and later as Rainbow whatevere it was Jimi was on about. ""Twas all semantics there, the real dialogue took place in the music and you will see ample evidence of how tightly Hendrix, Mitchell and Cox were playing off each other. There are no real jams here, more improvisations on a theme, and Hendrix is twice the perceptive leader anyone, including Robert Fripp, could ever imagine being. He knows exactly whre he wants this to go and knows exactly where the edge of the ledge is so that he may freefall in perfect discipline and land on his feet. And his colleagues are hand in hand with him. Billy Cox established conclusively that he was the right bassist, and the rhytm guitarist and 2 percussionists filled out the rhythmic pallette Hendrix sought to create.
It's funny to watch the film, because the audience is a mix of those just too numb to figure their way out, people celebrating the joyous groove Jimi conjures, and those intent on every move he makes. It's a shame the camera man seemed so fascinated by Hendrix's dental work, although, I have to admit Jimi had beautiful teeth. But, you'd figure there might have been some interest in his actual guitar technique. More's the pity. SO, I'd rate the film 4 stars for the quality and 1 and 1/2 stars for missing the point that this was the greatest guitarist of the twentieth century playing with a conviction and drive like no one else before or after.
Nonetheless the sound is extraordinary, in fact, better than I remember it.",1027209600,3,2372,4.677033492822966

This is only about half of the concert and we are missing great performances such as ""Hey Joe"". I'm not sure whether the Experience Hendrix Ltd. wanted to make more money by releasing the second half of the set later, or if the second half was just never filmed.

1232175,4,B00000JGNW,"Do these guys really think they can co-opt Jimi Hendrix's name so easily for their absurd new 'holy war' of 'infinite justice' (a little too bold it was, so they quickly changed the 'catch-phrase' to 'Enduring Freedom,"" as a security measure, to avoid some of the ironic remarks that were sure to snowball into an avalanche on the still-free press of the Internet if the hypocrisies of the U.S. Government in curtailing 'freedom' all over the world, were ever exposed enough to people used to getting their news from the controlled mainstream-press during their big 'crusade against terror')?
Who do these guys think Hendrix was, John Wayne, Ronald Reagan? Hendrix was the exact opposite of what those guys stood for, or what the traditional power-structure of America stood for. Everything in his art railed against it! His version of Star Spangled Banner was as feedback frenzied and crazy as it was because it was meant to be ironic and only respectful of America's best traditions, the America of the Slave-Owning-At-time-but-foresighted-and-freedom-loving Founding Fathers of the Constitution, that could've been, should've been, and tragically wasn't, and due to a disastrous foreign policy instigated by a criminal government running amok, still isn't 30 years after Jimi's death; he certainly wasn't applauding its jingoistic worst, and to pretend that he was, is an insult to the values of complete dissent and freedom his art stood for. He sure as hell wasn't celebrating America's napalming of Vietnam or the Military; it's laughable to even suggest that he was! You want direct proof? Just go and listen to ""Machine Gun"" or ""If 6 was 9"" (Hendrix didn't give one hoot if ""All the Hippies cut off all their hair"" either, as the famous lyric goes; he was an individualist, who saw through his own eyes, first & foremost!). In fact, you'd probably have a hard time finding ONE person in the entire Woodstock crowd that was in favor of the Vietnam War! And at the time, it was just as 'Holy' a war, from the government's perspective & that of most of the soldiers fighting it, as this new one W. Bush is embarking on.
Having deep sympathy with the victims of the tragic events of Sept. 11 is one thing; being blind to powerful people taking advantage of easily given trust to use this tragedy as an excuse to curtail all our freedoms forever and kill huge numbers of innocent civilians in far-away countries as ""collateral damage,"" is another. And I'm sure as Sherlock, my man Jimi would agree, whole-heartedly, if only he had survived his hectic times to see the absurdities of the present.",1002672000,4,2598,4.906818181818182
1232176,5,B00000JGNW,"I've had this DVD for months and enjoyed it immensely. This is Jimi's finest performance and a must own. The fact he earned ""the honor of closing the greatest rock festival ever conceived"" is enough reason to buy this.
I listen to his amazing and unforgettable rendition of ""Star Spangled Banner"" with more pride and hope now than ever in my life. God bless America and Operation Infinite Justice!",1001289600,,397,4.768115942028985
1232177,3,B00000JGNW,"I'm a great fan of Jimi, but not of this DVD. Wihle it's entertaining to see Jimi put on weird looks during Voodoo Chile (Slight Return), it's a shame that there's only < 1hr total running time and NO extras whatsoever. I'm not a sucker for extras (I buy a DVD for the main course, not the desert), but it came as a bad surprise to me that many songs were left out, and they even edited Voodoo Chile (Slight Return) for time (sacrilege!). Also, on my DVD-player, there's a glitch in one song where the sound stops for a very short moment, while the film rolls on.
Sound quality is reasonable for this age and era, camera work is not so fine, zooming in at the wrong places at times. (typical of many concert films IMHO, but they're trying to remain fresh throughout an entire, long concert)
My verdict: buy the CD. It's too big to fit on one CD (unlike this DVD, which will EASILY fit on one CD for sound/running time) and, while the CD is also edited for time, it contains more and longer songs. The DVD to me shows a lack of respect for the customers and true Hendrix fans.
3 Stars for the nice music and bonus of seeing Hendrix play seemingly effortlessly, but unless you really want to see Jimi on film (there are only 2 songs of Jimi on the 'general' Woodstock DVD) buy the double-CD.",996192000,,1289,4.286885245901639

The only problem is, it is only around an hour and only  contains about half of the songs that  are included on the  cd set of the same name... This dvd leaves off some of  the  best songs from the cd...
Having said that, it is worth it to  actually see Hendrix play  at Woodstock, and the sound is pretty damned  good. There is  just enough footage of the hippies and the festival itself  to give a flavor of the event, but nothing to intrude on the  music. If you  want more of the flavor of the festival, rent  the director's cut of  ""Woodstock"". This dvd is nice because  it doesn't have any  documentary crap to interfere, it's just  pure Jimi.

1232182,4,B00000JGNW,"It's amazing how much hype has built around Woodstock over the years. Noastalgia softens memories I guess. I've read many accounts of bands (i.e.  Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin, Grateful Dead) actually having prett  bad/mediocre performances at Woodstock (Though, in Fairness, others, like  The Who and Santana really did play fantastically). I'm a Hendrix fan/geek  whose read and heard a lot. Unfortunately, he was very exhausted from lack  of sleep and who knows what else by the time he hit the stage at Woodstock.  He also suffered a lack of judgement and focus by trying to present an  expanded line-up that wasn't entirely rehearsed or necessary. A  percussionist is a nice touch, but a rhythm guitarist behind him? Many of  the songs were played sloppily and without punch. However... Jimi was magic  after all and there ARE definitely some great, inspired moments. I've heard  him do Star Spangled Banner a few times and the one at Woodstock is hands  down the best by far. It's frustrating and ironic but the few Hendrix shows  that were well-filmed, such as Isle of Wight, were conversely some of his  weaker... But weak for Jimi is strong for most other musicians and with so  little Hendrix footage legally available you take what you can get, so  yeah, but this. As for the songs being cut up, out of order, or missing  altogether, welcome to the world of Jimi's legacy. Warner Bros, MCA, and  whomever else tend to more often than not butcher their posthumous Hendrix  releases one way or another and this is no exception!",967593600,3,1540,4.8538461538461535

Larry Lee (Guitar),  and Juma Sultan (Hand percussion) are almost never seen. However, I did  like the DVD.

1232184,5,B00000JGNW,"Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock is disputabily the greatest concert ever given.  I am an avid Hendrix fan and was elated to see this DVD.  This is by far the best DVD I have and shows Hendrix at his greatest.  Izabella is  revolutionary, Fire is rock solid, Red House is great (Jimi broke his high  E string), his Woodstock Improvisation is incredible and his Star Spangled  Banner is priceless.  That being considered, it deserves 5+  stars.
Although Expericnce Hendrix has done a great job releasing  material since they won Jimi's legacy a few years ago, this DVD, contrary  to the CD version, was disappointing in its length.  There are many songs  missing.  I owned the CDs first and will list my disappointments: (1) I  desperately wanted to hear and see all of Message to Love and Hear my Train  a Comin', two of Jimi's new songs as he broke away from the Experience.  (2) I also wanted to see Spanish Castle Magic, Foxy Lady, Hey Joe and Lover  Man, all not included on the DVD.  (3) The order of the songs was jumbled  on the DVD and I wanted to see the actual chronological order of the songs.  (4) Many of Jimi's comments, some pretty interesting (a la those before  Izabella for those who own the CDs), were totally cut out. (5) If it  replaced another of the aformentioned left-out songs, I really did not need  to hear Larry Lee being backed up be Jimi on Jam Back at the House.  Considering they cut out Larry Lee's other songs from the CD I was amazed  that this one even made it.
I guess I wanted a DVD identical to the CDs,  which is not what this is.  However, this is a must for any fan of rock  music in general, but I felt I had to voice my completist complaints.  Without a doubt, a must have.",954892800,41,1710,4.339682539682539
