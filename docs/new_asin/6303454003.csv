688704,5,6303454003,"Thirty-five years of servicing his community, and elderly physician Joseph McRory (Barry Fitzgerald) is feeling his age. He visits Boston so as to eyeball the doctor he'd requested to be his assistant, except that that gent isn't around at the moment. Dr. McRory must settle for an assurance that this unmet entity, Dr. James Pearson, is a good man.

Dr. McRory's train trip back to sleepy Fallbridge, Maine is not uneventful. He finds himself bedeviled time and again by a cheerful stranger who, in quick order, snatches his periodical, sings inappropriately in the washroom, and, most grievously, devours the meal he'd ordered. Now some of what's happened may or may not be because Dr. McRory flaunts a terrible disposition. Nevertheless, by the time both parties had disembarked from the train, Dr. McRory's ire was something to behold. And now the old doctor awaits in his home, anxious for his new assistant, who turns out to be... yes, you guessed it.

In 1947 Bing Crosby was at the height of his popularity and regarded as a top Hollywood box office draw. He brings his relaxed screen presence to this movie, except that it's this very same warm informality that so aggravates the old doctor. In Fallbridge, Maine (population 2,400), Jim Pearson is rapidly summed up as ""an incompetent, arrogant vaudeville singer, not a doctor."" Bit by wanderlust, Jim Pearson doesn't help his cause by immediately informing McRory that he plans to stay only a few months before sailing off to Guatemala. His records indicate that he's never had a residency longer than three or four months. But, then again, those other places didn't have spectacular but respectable schoolteacher Trudy Mason (Joan Caulfield). Jim Pearson is instantly smitten, Ms. Mason less so. The townspeople, as well, follow their old doctor's lead and are less than welcoming. Two people, each from the other end of the spectrum: Easygoing big city ways colliding with thirty-five hard-earned years of folksy wisdom. Plus, Jim isn't used to getting paid in jelly and sauerkraut and pickles.

Don't be surprised if, while watching WELCOME STRANGER, you're struck with a whiff of familiarity. Paramount Studios sought to resurrect the odd couple chemistry between Crosby and character actor Barry Fitzgerald from 1944's hugely successful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Going-My-Way-Universal-Cinema-Classics/dp/B000KJTGHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Going My Way (Universal Cinema Classics)</a>, and WELCOME STRANGER is what they wrought. Other than the shift from adversarial Catholic priests to small town sawbones at odds and Joan Caulfield as Crosby's love interest, the premise sticks. In either storylines, Crosby must prove himself and win over the crabby old curmudgeon Fitzgerald. There's a song or three.

Much of the movie is sentimental and warm and reflective of them good old-fashioned small town values. Crosby works in several songs. He serenades Caulfield, repeatedly tweaks his romantic rival (the stuffy local pharmacist), calls a square dance, and even gets in a brief dig at his old pal Bob Hope. There's a dramatic third act conflict which jeopardizes the old doc's place in community as the town council determines that Fallbridge could do with a younger doctor who espouses a more progressive aproach (and they don't mean Jim Pearson). Naturally, it only takes the one application of folksy medicine to remedy that predicament. It's never a bad thing when Bing Crosby gets to crooning and Joan Caulfield gets to sparking. But, once again, the big draw is the marvelously entertaining interplay between Crosby and Fitzgerald.",1360713600,2,3655,5.418277680140598

688706,5,6303454003,"This film is a great follow up to the Oscar winning 'Going My Way' because of that film this one is vastly underrated, had it not come after 'Going My Way' 'Welcome Stranger' would be far more popular and well known today, I can highly recommend it, Bing Crosby is well....Bing Crosby, Barry Fitzgerald puts in one of his best performances as a cranky old country doctor looking for a temporary replacement while he takes his first holiday in years, when his replacement turns out to be Bing he is less than impressed by this young upstart having hopped that the replacement agency he used would have sent him a more mature man. Eventually everything turns out right as it always does in old Hollywood, but there is charm a plenty along the way. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.",1350432000,3,780,4.578571428571428

Would love to see it on DVD as VHS is all that is avaliable for purchase.
A truly great family movie with a great cast. Would buy as soon as it comes out. Thanks: David S.",1201478400,4,243,4.083333333333333

This is a well made, warm hearted classic.  A ""feel good"" movie of triumph...once upon a time, when movies made you feel good about life...

WHEN is this going to be put on DVD?!?  When you see the VHS price so high, you realize how rare and great this film is!",1125273600,11,339,4.014925373134329
688711,4,6303454003,"If your a fan of Bing, or just looking for a feel good movie, look no further.  This reteaming of the successful pairing of Bing Crosby and Barry Fitzgerald is a keeper. Barry stars as a retiring small town doctor who  hires Bing as his replacement without meeting him first.  Needless to say,  the two get off on the wrong foot,and what ensues is very funny and often  touching. Highly reccommended!",949708800,15,400,4.577464788732394
688712,3,6303454003,"This is a charming  team- up of Bing Crosby and Barry Fitzgerald who made ""Going My Way"" such a hit.  Bing is a sub-in doctor taking Barry's place in a small town while Barry goes on vacation.  The way these  two meet on the train is funny and filled with a sense of what can really  happen when people start off on the wrong foot.  Bing sings, of course, and  eventually gets in a zinger about Bob Hope, which you have to pay attention  for or you'll miss it. (This was made around the time they were making  their ""Road"" pictures. Throughout Bing is smooth and cool, and  handles it all.  Its fun, light and makes you think about how it must have  been back then.  No great plot to look for here, but find instead those  nuggets of screen  ""Crosbyana"" that made him such a much loved  star then and still so today.",944265600,12,816,4.201298701298701
