2319275,5,B0009U7LOO,"I own this movie and have for some time now. Whether or have children or not, if you like the tale of Puss in Boots you will probably like this movie. If you are prepared.
The acting isn't really all that bad, the writing itself is just campy, which some reviewers have shrugged off on the actors. I saw another review that said Christopher Walken should't dance and sing. Chris has been a dancer and singer since the start of his career and is very taleted. But again the songs and the coreography made hi look a bit lacking.
If you are expecting a masterpeice as a kids movie, you may be dissapointed. But if you don't mind somewhat campy ad VERY ADORABLE musicals. You will LOVE this.",1236211200,2,687,4.375
2319276,5,B0009U7LOO,"This was in excellent condition and the best musical movie that I have ever seen of Puss in Boots. It was funny, fun, cute, and amazing acting. I loved it. I highly recommend this movie. If you do not adore musicals or fairy tales than you probably wouldn't like it. However IF you do than this is a movie for you.

2319277,1,B0009U7LOO,If you enjoy musicals with poor acting then this is your movie.  Now I have to admit that I didn't watch the trailer and if I had I wouldn't have rented this movie. By the description I was expecting an annimated film.  If you are a Christopher Walken fan you might be interested in seeing one of his early works with him as a redhead singing and dancing both of which I am glad he gave up.,1203206400,3,390,4.0519480519480515
2319278,4,B0009U7LOO,"I bought this for my 5 year old grandson.  We had recently seen it on Cable TV and really enjoyed it.  The Ogre is a little bit scary, but I remind my grandson that he is just like Shrek.  He really likes it when puss tricks the ogre into becoming a mouse.  The rest is history.  It's great to see some good old fashioned fables!  Our family are really big star wars fans.  So the triumph of good over evil is always a great story to us.  Christopher Walken is great in this...he portrays puss perfectly. Great movie!",1194912000,4,517,4.204081632653061
2319279,5,B0009U7LOO,"This is perhaps Christopher Walken's favorite movie and if you had the Disney Channel in the late 80s to early 90s it might have been your first. All of the Cannon fairy tales are worth owning and this is a particular delight to Walken fans, and yes, it is kid friendly.

Christopher Walken sings, dances, and embodies cattitude in a simple yet enchanting telling of the story of a clever cat who provides for his young master's fortune. The songs are memorable without being annoying, the comedy funny enough, and ofcourse it's all about the star. Filmed in 1988 Mr Walken was still in his physical prime and full of the dance skills he would latter bring to the Weapon of Choice video.

If you were determined or lucky you had a VHS of this, an official DVD has been long awaited. This is an absolute must for anyone with Walkenitis.",1181174400,16,835,4.52317880794702
2319280,3,B0009U7LOO,"The story was only average and somewhat uninteresting. I think it lacked the dramatic contrast necessary in any story and action. However, the music's instrumentation would be quite useful for teaching and testing the students' knowledge of orchestral sounds.",1168819200,2,259,5.666666666666667
2319281,5,B0009U7LOO,"Well, my favorite anyway. The legendary performer brings a classic French fairy tale to life in the Cannon Movie Tale, ""Puss In Boots."" The sole inheritance of a poor miller's son, Puss (Walken) leads the young man from sudden homelessness to the lap of luxury by using his cat-skill and wit and a pair of boots that make him appear human to all those around him. Together, Puss and his master deceive the king and confront a man-eating ogre in an effort to win the heart of a princess and the title of Marquis of Carabass!

""Puss In Boots"" sits among the best of the nine wonderful Cannon Movie Tales, which are among the best live-action fairy tale films available to date. Sticking more closely to the original stories than the usual fare, ""Puss In Boots"" and the other Cannon tales mix in simple but fun-filled songs with fantastic casts and writing that blends realism and fantasy seamlessly. ""Puss In Boots"" may be less fairy and more tale than the others, but the clever story and magical and magnificent performance of Christopher Walken as the singing and dancing cat make it a must see! It's so terrific that these childhood favorites many of us remember from the Disney Channel's 1980's and early 90's glory are finally available on DVD (most of them at least). The DVDs include trailers (not sure if these films ran anywhere theatrically), and most (including Puss) are presented in fullscreen format. The Cannon Movie Tales are mostly family fun, though be warned that some can have their scary moments (for example, ""Red Riding Hood,"" my favorite, is done as a werewolf story that at times may be a bit frightening). The other Cannon Movie Tales, all of which I highly recommend, are: Rumpelstiltskin, The Emperor's New Clothes, Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Hansel and Gretel, Beauty and the Beast, The Frog Prince, and Sleeping Beauty. Those last two have not yet been released to DVD, and I have yet to see Rumpelstiltskin at any retail stores, though Amazon seems to carry it. I wish to get them all, but currently only own my favorites: Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Puss In Boots, and Hansel and Gretel. Fairy tale fanatics should own all these films, and I also highly recommend my top favorites, the Disney animated versions. Also, for a scarier version of Snow White, pick up the outstanding, ""Snow White: A Tale of Terror,"" starring the beautiful Monica Keena. More recommendations: Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre collection (also best known from the Disney Channel airings), Shrek and Shrek 2, The Slipper and the Rose (for a live-action Cinderella), Ever After (another live-action Cinderella), The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996), Peter Pan (2003), The Wizard of Oz, Return to Oz, and Rodger's and Hammerstein's Cinderella (1965) among others!",1147996800,23,2773,4.9

2319283,5,B0009U7LOO,"Watch Christopher Walken dance as Puss in Boots and costar with Jason Connery, son of Sean, in this Cannon Movie Tale musical based on the beloved French fairy tale by Charles Perrault.

Here's the movie's description available from Sony Pictures: ""Before he was a swashbuckling sensation in Shrek 2, Puss in Boots was already one of the most popular storybook characters of all time, thanks to his sly schemes and fearless bravado. Screen legend Christopher Walken (Catch Me If You Can) steps into the wily feline's magical boots in this exciting live-action version of the classic Brothers Grimm fairy tale, complete with singing, dancing...and acrobatics!

""A dying mill owner divides his meager wealth among his sons, leaving only his beloved cat, Puss (Walken), to his youngest son Corin (Jason Connery). Initially disappointed with his four-legged bounty, Corin soon discovers that Puss is no average kitty. In fact, the cat's a brilliant strategist who concocts a daring plan to win both the king's favor - and the princess' heart - for his new master!""

The Cannon Movie Tale series of nine films has become nearly as popular among fairy tale enthusiasts and family film fans as Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre. Some would argue that this series is even more popular. Either way, these musicals are suitable for the entire family and feature well-known actors from the 1980s.",1117929600,21,1388,5.105726872246696

2319290,5,B0009U7LOO,"This is fun!  I usually think of Christopher Walken as a very serious actor playing mostly scary kind of guys.  So when a good friend mentioned this, I had to see it.  And since it also has one of Sean Connery's sons in it, that just made it more intriguing.  I honestly don't remember reading this at any point in my life, so I didn't know about PIB and ogres and didn't realize that ""Shrek"", one of my all time favorites, has it's roots in this tale.  Anyway, it was neat watching Christopher Walken doing a light role that included a bit of dancing (and untill I watched Jersey Boys and the newest Peter Pan, didn't realize that he ever did that).  It isn't one of those amazing movies that takes your breath away, but it is one that's a nice fun thing to watch.",1420588800,,765,4.241379310344827

2319296,5,B0009U7LOO,"Christopher Walken said in an interview with movie critic Peter Travers (which I listened to) that he considers this one of his best performances, yet (he added) no one's heard of it.  I'm glad I have, for it's a treasure!  It is my very favorite fairy tale rendition, even more than Disney's Beauty and the Beast which is my favorite animated fairy tale.  (Second place for my favorite real-people fairy tale goes to the Cannon Group's Emperor's New Clothes starring Robert Morse and Sid Caesar.)  It was amusing to me to read on Wikipedia's article about the Puss in Boots story, ""The renowned illustrator of Dickens' novels and stories, George Cruikshank, was shocked that parents would allow their children to read ""Puss in Boots"" and declared: ""As it stood the tale was a succession of successful falsehoods--a clever lesson in lying!--a system of imposture rewarded with the greatest worldly advantages."" ""  Maybe that would be how I'd view the story if we were still living in a stratified society with a rigid class structure, but the story never struck me that way.  Maybe that's because this rendition of the story is how I learned it.  The king in this is such a hilarious imbecile, and the miller's son, Corin, is a shy and passive fellow who is the complete opposite of selfish ambition.  Christopher Walken does an excellent job behaving like a cat and some great dancing, singing, and bravado (fake boldness) behavior.  Jason Connery (Sean's son) plays Corin, the miller's son who is helped all along the way by Puss.  One of the appealing things about it is that Puss is how I like to think of God's grace, generously helping Corin without reservation, just wanting to make him happier without any selfish motive.

The style of this version is very lighthearted, while still hitting the right scary emotions when the king wants to see the Marquis of Carabas's castle and the ogre shows his scary power.  The ogre is hilarious, as is the king.  Both of them can't stand the idea of something being ""impossible"", and both of them can't think for themselves, and both don't even know who the other is, in spite of being probably only 3 hours' riding distance away!  It's sublimely delightful how easily Puss executes every plan--except for when he is drunk on milk and boasts about the Marquis of Carabas's land, which creates a crisis.  (I assume you know how the story goes.)  The relationship between Corin and Vera (the princess) is so fun, too, and it's hard to describe such enjoyment with words.

I love how the characters of the king and ogre are both equally fearsome but also equally stupid.  Both of 'em can't accept the idea of ""impossible"", both of 'em can't think for themselves, and both of 'em don't know who the other is, even though they live probably only 3 hours of riding distance away!

In every way, the movie feels flawless to me.  But the thing that impresses me most is the songs.  They're often written in a 1700s classical style somewhat resembling Mozart, but they often defy categorization, even containing light jazz elements or kind of resembling Gilbert and Sullivan (who came later than Mozart), yet I think they're even better than a lot of what Gilbert and Sullivan wrote.  The lyrics and music are both EXCELLENT.  I am very musical and perform, write, and arrange, and through the whole movie, I noticed how well the songs are situated, and how they always have the right emotion and length.  They also have witty lyrics when appropriate and sincere lyrics when appropriate, a festive sound when appropriate and a whimsical sound when appropriate--they're just perfect.  At this point, you just need to see and hear the movie in order to discover how good it is!

I hadn't seen this for several years, and returning to it, I was just amazed at how good the whole production is in every way, and I really enjoy how it has a lighthearted style without being a spoof, and its outstanding songs.  The songs have more originality than most musicals or Disney animated movies, and they don't use cliches.  Most people don't know how hard that is or how rare that is, but I picked up on it bigtime!  A flawless movie!

Tip:  Use the subtitles option to get the most out of the songs! :-)",1408147200,3,4231,4.707880434782608

2319298,5,B0009U7LOO,"This is such a rarity for all of those who think they know Christopher Walken. This is the song and dance version of one of the most misunderstood guys in show business. He sings, he dances, he is just s much fun s he can be in this movie! He plays the clever cat, Puss, who asks only for a decent pair of boots, for which he promises his master, Jason Connery, everything. It's a Golan-Globus film, an further, a vanity piece for the Marner family, who is the producers and their daughter, the actress playing the princess.  It really doesn't suck like you might think. It has musical numbers with some of the strangest phrasing I've ever heard, but it all comes off in rather a fun manner. But the main thing is watching Chris get up on the kitchen table and dance his butt off...no stand in, this is him spinning and kicking up his heels and looking great in his very sexy costume. His cat actions are so subtle and sublime...the easy he casually pours a bowl of cream and drinks it while telling the servants in the kitchen what a great man of the country his master is.

It was the most ridiculous movie I've ever seen. CW is very young, and there's another actor or actress I recognized who was also very young.

The movie is cheesy, to say the least. Bad acting, bad ""special"" effects, but somehow, it grows on you. I'm sending it to my daughter, who is also a CW fan. But I'm sending it as a joke - or a movie ""she must see, but don't expect anything.""",1346371200,,553,4.111111111111111

There's also his handsome, clueless master, an intelligent, adventureous princess and a ruthless, egotistical ogre. Though the acting, singing and dancing can sometimes be a little awkward and embarassing, everyone seems to be having a good time, especially, a surprisingly funny, Christopher Walken as Puss the cat. Undaunted by the sparce script Walken, usually playing tough gangsters, psycho villians, and dark evil angels, has a good time dancing and singing his way through the movie as the perky clever cat.

  the young leads here are very cute and have the kind of 'High School Musical' appeal that is usually popular amongst the young. Jason Connery is very appealing here, even if he doesn't do his own singing unlike young Zac Efron.

You can attribute that to a masterful performance by Christopher Walken in the title role which carries the weight of this enterprise.  Walken is at turns nimble, sly, and hysterical.  He is clearly enjoying enjoying himself.  He cannot be accused of phoning this one in to collect a paycheck.  Kids will like it.  So will adults.  Walken completists can feel no shame in adding it to their collections.  Adorable.",1520467200,,825,4.977941176470588

8066545,5,B0009U7LOO,"There have been many versions of this classical tale done over the past four decades, some live action, some animated, but this is my favorite.

Chris Walken is simply amazing in this film.  He dances, he sings, and delivers an amazing performance.

(Honestly, I cannot shake imagining him as Gabriel from his most notable role, but he is great in this movie.)

Also, the film is very true to the original tale.  (Some of the other versions embellish quite a bit.)

One caveat, this is not done in HD.  It is clearly a VHS quality video transcribed to DVD, but for the little fairy tale lover in your family will not mind.",1498262400,3,622,4.5
