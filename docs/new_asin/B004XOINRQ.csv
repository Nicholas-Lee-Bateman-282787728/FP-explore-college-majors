8524329,2,B004XOINRQ,I wanted the blu-ray version of 'America's Sweethearts' of which this is the Italian release. I bought this version since there isn't an American release in blu-ray. The listing says it has English in dts-HD 5.1. When I played the disc the English was actually German. The video looks good for an older title. If it had English as stated I would give it 3.5 stars.,1358035200,,364,4.53030303030303
