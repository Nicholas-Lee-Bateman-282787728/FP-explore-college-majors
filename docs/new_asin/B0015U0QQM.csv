There are more complete sets out there, but this is one of the better ones for the price.",1348099200,,260,4.117647058823529
8259968,5,B0015U0QQM,"I don't know why the Australian-produced ""The genius of Buster Keaton [DVD]: the short film collection"" (""Beyond Entertainment"", 2010, 33 short silent films made between 1917 and 1923) is omitted in an Amazon list -probably, it is because of belonging to lovely rarities none wants to part with, well-collated a four-disc comprehensive movie collection.

Personally, the most I prefer movies P. Arbucle and ""Buster"" Keaton worked together for. In a digital-art-short age, actors' performing is astonishing also some jokes and humour indicated a distant departure society's ethics and customs evolved into a century on since the proudly American films had been made.

A history of New York City, America and a world humanity commemorated.",1345075200,,737,5.456140350877193
8259969,5,B0015U0QQM,"I'm new Keaton but love silent comedies. It's very hard to find good prints of older films with so many different variations and the more expensive the better copy there is. However, there exist many good cheaper versions and this is one of the best i've seen. It's out of print (dont know if they will get anymore) but if you find it then I highly recommend it. You get some of his best films and the picture quality is very good expect I notice the white is very bright in some prints. Still, this is a very good start to Keaton and his movies for a good price.",1268870400,5,563,4.174311926605505

Highly recommend",1254700800,2,101,4.368421052631579
8259971,5,B0015U0QQM,All ages got a big kick out of seeing this movie.  Laughter is good.,1232150400,6,68,3.857142857142857
8259972,5,B0015U0QQM,"Buster Keaton wrote and directed most of his two and three-reelers with Eddie Cline, who also appears in several of them (as Edward F. Cline). Keaton is considered one of the Big Three silent-era comedians, along with Harold Lloyd and Charles Chaplin.

Highlights of this marvelous three DVD set:

""The General"" is a cinematic classic-- nothing less. This is a movie everyone should see. It's a great introduction to the silent film genre. Keaton's amazing acrobatic skills, his dead aim, pantomimic ability and expressive mannerisms have never been put to better use, or topped by anyone, anywhere.

""The Play House"" is a most remarkable short. In the space of 20 minutes, Keaton manages to portray 20 different roles: he's the audience, actors, orchestra and a stagehand. A tour-de-force!

""Steamboat Bill Jr."" contains Keaton's most dangerous stunt. A wall topples over and the stationary and upright Buster is positioned precisely so that he passes harmlessly through an open window, the wall landing on the ground around him. This was such a hazardous trick, half of the production crew walked off in protest rather than be witness to Keaton possibly getting killed by this plummeting object.

""Parlor, Bedroom & Bath"" is a pre-code comedy that showcases Keaton's comedic talents in a speaking part. Also in this film is Cliff Edwards, who was once known as Ukulele Ike. Edwards' most famous role was the voice of Jiminy Cricket in PINOCCHIO. His recording of ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" won an Academy Award in 1941.

In ""Li'l Abner,"" Keaton has a supporting role. In this one he's a dead ringer for Lonesome Polecat, the little Indian who brews Kickapoo Joy Juice in an enormous cast iron cauldron. The other actors here are also remarkable look-alikes who bring to life their comic strip characters. Although the script is slight, this is still a fun movie.
