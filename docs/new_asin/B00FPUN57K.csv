6019646,5,B00FPUN57K,"This series was funny from the pilot episode and the antics of the b**** in Apt 23 just continued to push the envelope.  Assisted greatly by the self-deprecating James Van Der Beek playing himself the ensemble cast of whacky characters surrounding bewildered ""fish out of water' June developed greatly as the series progressed.
Unfortunately, the network decided to cancel the show just after midway through Season 2 leaving a number of unaired episodes.  This set is complete so any fans out there this is the way to finally view those clever missed episodes.",1388188800,,560,5.010752688172043

I didn't veiw it when it aired on abc but I was actually taking a chance when I ordered it and I can say I have zero regrets the cast the plots and everything about this show is in my opinion is amazing I think its one of the best if not the best 30 min shows I have ever seen.

6019653,5,B00FPUN57K,"I was very impressed with this product for several reasons.  To be honest, I'm watching this sitcom for the first time, thanks to Amazon making the complete series available on DVD. A 4-DVD (Season 1 and Season 2) Complete Set, the picture quality and sound are superb -- and the set includes 8 episodes that were never broadcast on TV, after the show got prematurely canceled in Season 2.  Funny, funny sitcom, though -- much, much funnier than a lot of the sitcoms currently on TV.  I'm really enjoying watching these episodes on DVD.  Thanks, Amazon, for making this DVD set available for purchase on demand through Create Space.  FIVE STARS!!!!",1382054400,21,648,4.801801801801802
6019654,5,B00FPUN57K,This show completely cracks me up!,1469836800,,34,4.833333333333333
6019655,4,B00FPUN57K,"The premise of the show is simple, a small town girl moves to New York to get a job on Wall Street at the height of the financial collapse.  When she finds she has no job, she is forced to take a job in a coffee shop and find an apartment with a roommate.  The roommate turns out to be an immoral, hard-drinking, narcissistic party girl and hilarity ensues.  Krysten Ritter plays the titular B in Apartment 23 (Chloe), in what was her first headlining role for a show.  Dreama Walker plays her naive Indiana native roommate, June.  The two had very good chemistry on the show and played off each other very well.  While I do not think Ritter was as good in this role as she is in Jessica Jones (two obviously very different roles) you could see she had acting chops playing a character that was almost always in it for herself, but did display a subtle human side every so often.

The scene stealing moments from the show usually came from James Van Der Beek, playing himself in a very stereotypical vain celebrity way, and his assistant Luther, played by Ray Ford.  There are, of course, a lot of Dawson's Creek jokes throughout and a great cameo appearance by Busy Phillips explaining to him why the entire Dawson's Creek cast hates him.

The show was not really around long enough to have a bunch of major story lines.  It only lasted two partial seasons, and most of the shows were the typical story of the week kind of things you get from half-hour sitcoms.  The big themes that did make it to the show were Chole trying to get June to loosen up, while June in turn tried to get Chloe to tone down her party girl ways.  There was a pretty hilarious few episodes revolving around Van Der Beek getting on Dancing With the Stars and a rivalry with Dean Cain, and a story line between June and her ""friend zoned"" former co-worker Mark.

The shows humor is definitely not for everyone.  It was very raunchy with adult comedy, back before that became more of a norm that it is now.  It made jokes about drug use, heavy drinking, casual sex, race etc.  No topic was really off limits.  Depending on your sense of humor it is a show you will likely either love or hate.  It was definitely its own thing, and it would have been nice to see it get a more extended run.  Had it been on one of the cable networks like comedy central, it probably would have, but it was just not right for ABC.

 For those who get the DVDs, they are one of Amazon's made on demand DVD-R products so you just get the episodes and nothing more.  Some reviewers had issues with missing episodes.  I did not have that issue with my set, but you will probably want to watch them quickly to make sure they are all there or that you do not get duplicate discs (which I have had happen with other DVD-R sets).",1466380800,,2776,4.30635838150289

6019668,3,B00FPUN57K,"I just wanted to comment that I bought my set new from a seller on the worlds largest Internet auction site and all four discs played perfectly so maybe those with glitches were all from a bad batch that Amazon received.

That being said, DONT TRUST THE B is okay but doesnt merit repeat viewings. Its like a mean-spirited, 2010s female version of THE ODD COUPLE but cruder with bathroom humor, sexual innuendo and fast-paced silliness that has nothing to do with reality and makes the show feel like a live-action cartoon with its fast pace and quit-cut editing.

The cast are fine with Dreama Walker playing the chipmunk-cheeked idealist June new to New York and sharing an apartment with the tall, angular selfish party girl Chloe (Krysten Ritter) and James Van der Beek playing a self-absorbed parody of himself.

It's a shame that ABC couldn't figure out what to do with this show, because I was hooked from my first viewing. Krysten Ritter is perfectly believable as the manic self centered Chloe.

June (played by Dreama Walker) also filled the bill perfectly as the clueless roommate who moves in.

James Van Der Beek plays himself as Chloe's best friend. I don't think I've ever seen him in anything else, but he was really funny in this.

The only problems I had was with the disks. Both seasons are on two disks each. The last two episodes on the second disks of both seasons would not play. I tried the disks in two different DVD players with the same results.

The series is very funny (I found the second episode of season one the funniest), and if you like this kind of humor, you will like this. But beware of the problems with the disks. I probably should have sent them back, but I didn't.",1413590400,,835,4.232704402515723

6019689,5,B00FPUN57K,"I don't think I knew of one person who actually watched Nahnatchka Khans Dont Trust the B---- in Apartment 23 (streaming on Netflix), and man, yall don't know what you were missing.  This show is flat-out hysterical.  Who knew James Van der Beek was so good at deadpan humor?  Part of the reason why he is so funny is because hes playing (a caricature of?) himself.  But the show isn't really about him.  Its about, of course, the bitch in apartment 23 and her roommate-for-the-moment, June.

So, when you first meet Chloe (a.k.a. The Bitch, a.k.a. Krysten Ritter [Breaking Bad]), shes interviewing candidates to become her new roommate.  She settles on June (Dreama Walker - Gran Torino), a girl from the midwest who comes to New York to blah, blah, blah - its not important.  What is important, however, are two things: a) June is about to get married and b) Chloe tries to sabotage her relationships with her roommates.

In the spirit of the former point aforementioned, Chloe has sex with Junes fiance on the latters birthday...on her birthday cake...to prove to June that her fiance is a cheating bastard.  Not sure what would get someone so turned on as to have sex with such a cad, but then, considering Chloe, she probably gets off on the sheer fun of ruining someones life - ironically, not Junes but her fiances.

By doing something this, er, nice for June, Chloe ends up forming an unlikely friendship with June - one that reminds us of the girls in high school who would be completely out of our league but befriend us anyway, thereby either ramping up or questioning our true opinions about ourselves.

Cut to James van der Beek, with whom Chloe just happens to be friends.  Well, they once dated, but his penis was too big, so they had to break up and now they're just buddies.  Which youll find yourself questioning why someone like Van der Beek (in character) would have so much time to spend with this one girl as his buddy, but shut up, because thats television.

Several jokes arise about Van der Beeks tenure playing Dawson on The WB networks (before it became the CW) Dawsons Creek, and all of them are hysterical, including his attempts at teaching an acting class where his pupils only want to hear his don't go speech to Joey from Season One.

Other side characters worthy of note include Luther (Ray Ford), Van der Beeks effeminate personal assistant and Mark (Eric Andre), Junes would-have-been manager at the mortgage company where she was supposed to work who now works with her at the coffee shop and who seems to have a treasure trove of comedic talent buried just beneath the surface.

Still others are Robin (Liza Lapira), one of several of Chloes formerly jilted roommates (the only difference is, Robin has an unhealthy obsession for Chloe and lives only a couple of apartments away) and Eli (Michael Blaiklock), the creepy horndog neighbor to June and Chloe whos never further than a window away.

June is adorable without crossing over into annoying, Chloe is that bitch that youve still always been drawn to, and Van der Beek is that shallow celebrity that you still kinda wish was your best friend/lover whod treat you bad.  Dont Trust the B---- in Apartment 23 was a brilliant show that, sadly, only lasted two seasons and had a brand of humor reminiscent of that of Community.  Perhaps thats why ABC couldn't find a spot for it either.",1406505600,,3375,4.688135593220339

If you click on the menu for the episodes it just takes you back to the original 20th Century Fox logo and eventually back to the episodes menu.  I thought maybe I get a defective copy, so returned it for another copy.  But no, same problem.  I love having this show, but I paid for The Complete Series, not most of the series.  PS, I am only starting disk 4 right now, so not sure if more eps will not work.  Disks One and Three are perfect, though.",1388793600,9,687,4.037037037037037

8617803,4,B00FPUN57K,"Fantastic to finally own all the episodes of this short lived but hilarious show. I truly think this show was ahead of its time and it was such a shame when it got canceled. Krysten Ritter was amazing as the sociopath (who really has a heart of gold), Dreama Walker fit her role perfectly as the Midwestern girl in the big city. James Van Der Beek steals the show as an outrageous winking caricature of himself. Just a really fun and breezy show.

As far as the burn on demand discs - mine arrived and all four discs worked perfectly and included all episodes which all played on my DVD player.. Only reason I took off one star is as others have pointed out - there are no special features, interviews, etc. The cast here worked so well together, I have to imagine there was a blooper reel that would have been a great addition to the set.",1493596800,,839,4.310126582278481

8617805,4,B00FPUN57K,"I would have given this DVD 5 stars if it had some bonus features, that said,( this product will be manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media), if you are concerned about the DVD's playing ok, they do, I played them in my DVD player and on my Mac computer & had no problems. This was a fun show, yet another network mistake, canceling it after only 2 seasons. good cast, worked well together. and while Krysten Ritter is great in this, Dreama Walker steals the show. the show flowed really well, right from the pilot episode all the way through both seasons. it leaves you wanting more. it's a little pricey considering there's no bonus stuff or booklet inside, but it comes out to being just over a buck an episode, it's well worth it. plus you can watch it whenever you want. just get it... enjoy life!",1489622400,,814,4.469798657718121
8617806,5,B00FPUN57K,"I LOVE this show.  It is one of my favorite sitcoms. But here is some important info about a glitch in Season Two...

In Season 2 Episode 8, June FINALLY has a new job on Wall Street.  Season 2 Episode 9, she is working in the Coffee Shop again with NO explanation.  And Season 2 Episode 10 is LITERALLY the second episode from SEASON ONE, again with NO explanation!!

It is very confusing.  I really wish the producers would have given them more credit then to destroy the continuity like this.",1482019200,,495,4.384615384615385

8617808,5,B00FPUN57K,"Actually, I have not yet bought this but am doing that now. Recently, Logo TV ran a series of episodes and I was reminded of what an incredible delight this show was; having recorded it on DVR, I have found myself watching it over and over. I can understand why it was cancelled: I think America was just too put off by the premise of the show. The B is a selfish, self-centered and destructive woman drinking, partying and sexing her way through life, with little concern for others or to recommend her other than a lovely face with a smokin' bod and an ability to manipulate the anyone who falls for her charms. She walks over and on those who don't. The story belongs to Dreama Walker's character, who is a naive mid-westerner, excited to be in New York for the first time and saddled with this sociopathic, wrecking ball of a roommate. She is lovable, but a bit of a twit, believing, against all proof to the contrary, that she can make a decent person of her. The B's best friend is James Vanderbeek, playing himself as a career-driven, attention-seeking, air-headed schmo, assisted by a short black, overly-dramatic but dedicated queen. In addition to these characters are (1) a neighbor who can look into their apartment (from across air well and comments on the goings on) and (2)an ex-roommate, obsessed with the B and  determined to get her approval after having been pushed out of the apartment.the acting, direction and writing are absolutely solid and funny. Krysten is a complete charmer and makes the horrid, train-wreck-in-motion character she portrays irresistible. A great treat in the series ( for me, anyway) are two episodes that feature Vanderbeek totally going for the win on, ""Dancing With The Stars."" Surprise...he is a very good dancer! I wish they had let him do more. Spreading his arms majestically, (like he owns the place) and rocking his hips standing, and in squat position no less, he is a joy. ""You're welcome, America"" he says...and you have to laugh at the (well deserved) conceit. I hope others get the pleasure of enjoying this show. I still don't understand why I haven't seen these people in other projects, with the exception of the actor who plays dream's supervisor at the coffee shop who went on to a successful run on, "" Two Broke Girls."" They are, certainly, all wonderful and endearing actors. I just had to make the time to write this",1475020800,,2383,4.71462829736211
