8173362,5,B000MX80DE,"Sports cannot operate in a vacuum, but it more times than not moves on a parallel line with social change, as its pace typically is a step behind the ""real"" world.

But there are moments - Jackie Robinson & Larry Doby, Doug Williams, Marion Motley & Bill Willis - where the paths intersect. The 1966 NCAA championship game won by Texas Western over Kentucky is an incredible moment that has major historical significance.

The DVD utilizes the radio broadcast to go with the game film, which has been restored as well as possible, considering its age. This is not just for college basketball fans; those who appreciate American history will find the material indispensable, as should educators at all grade levels. This truly was a glory road that reverberates today on hardwood and asphalt floors in the most important game of them all.....life.",1236124800,3,846,4.909090909090909

8173364,4,B000MX80DE,"After seeing the movie, I got this.  It wasn't as exciting as the movie obviously (because you can't really sense the emotion and the conflicts on this black and white clip with audio dubbed over from a radio broadcast), but it was interesting nonetheless.  I don't know why they didn't just include this game as an extra on the DVD.",1190246400,,333,4.533333333333333
8173365,5,B000MX80DE,"This is one of the greatest humanistic stories of all times.  It is the very beginning of what college sports represent today and I am thankfull for the inovative thinking of Coach Haskins and the young men of Texas Western University (University of Texas El Paso), if it wasn't for them, I would have never received a basketball scholarship and earned a degree.",1180137600,5,362,4.746031746031746
8173366,5,B000MX80DE,"For YEARS I have been pleading with the NCAA, the university (UTEP), ESPN, and anyone else who would listen that this game, perhaps the most important and culturally significant contest ever played, should be remastered and released on DVD.  At last, my wish has been granted.  I've had an old VHS copy of this game that was made from the original master reel for a few years, but the picture quality is very poor and there's no audio.

While the picture quality is still not 100%, this digitally remastered version of the game is as good as could possibly be expected (since the master reel is over 40 years old).  Another great feature is that the game finally has audio.  They managed to find the original radio broadcast of the game and matched it to the video, so the play-calling is seamless and exact.  Add to that the bonus features, which include player interviews, the game newsreel, and the NCAA highlight video aired after the game, and it truly is a piece of history not to be missed.

When ""Glory Road"" was released on DVD last year, one of my biggest complaints was that they didn't even attempt to include a bonus disc of the actual game.  Now that this DVD has been produced, fans of UTEP basketball and basketball fans in general can see for themselves the game that changed collegiate sports forever.

It's been long overdue... but well worth the wait.",1176768000,13,1371,4.609053497942387
