8091427,5,B000BR9S64,"In this chapter, the count's revenge plan gradually takes shape of its own and young characters such as Albert, Frantz, Eugenie, Valentine, are thrown into the plan and two of them Albert and Valentine fall victims by poisoning the count introduced to Valentine's stepmother to destroy Villefort family. Fortunately both survived but Valantine remains unconscious and Maximilien who really cares about her takes her to the house in his hometown. To the count of Monte Cristo, even young people's vigor, innocence, resentment to their parents and their future ambitions could be incorporated into his plan. And by this chapter it is becoming more and more apparent that the story swings slightly different direction from Duma's original novel. Production team might have based more on recent dramas such as Gerard Depardieu's 1998 drama&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Count-of-Monte-Cristo/dp/B000BFJM26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Count of Monte Cristo</a>&nbsp;which was extensively aired by NHK network in Japan.

In Episode #9 Frantz finds out that Monte Cristo really is the GANKUTSUOU. From then on he tries to find out what is ""GANKUTSUOU"". Gankutsuou is in fact the Japanese title of the first Japanese translation of Duma's novel. In this animation series, however, Gankutsuou seems to be a mysterious evil being the count turned into to carry out his revenge plan.

Verdict: Becoming more and more exciting, excellent character development.
Rating: 95 out of 100
Recommended for: Monte Cristo drama fans, Japanese animation fans and Strangler's fans.",1341792000,,1610,5.846808510638298

Well, it just keeps getting better, even halfway through the series. You expect a wall to go up by this point, but not with Gankutsuou. The suspense keeps rising, the intricate plot gets deeper, and the characters are beginning to reveal their truest emotions. Yet Gankutsuou is doing all this at a brisk pace--hell, the series itself starts halfway through Dumas' original work, right when the Count is just beginning his plot for revenge and not during his time in prison or his childhood. I think if Gankutsuou keeps this up, it may actually push certain fans away because of just how intense it actually is.

In this, the third volume, the Count finally begins targeting those responsible for putting him away. Under the guise of a friendly neighbor, he infiltrates the highest of France's society and slowly forces his plot onto others. Meanwhile, Albert faces his own problems, mostly dealing with all the different modes of love; friendship, true love, false love, and his own personal feeling. During all of this, people die and lives are put into extreme danger. I hate to reveal anymore of the plot so I'll leave it that.

GONZO seems to know what makes a good anime, and they put a lot into the anime that they know will succeed. Like Samurai 7 and Last Exile, Gankutsuou makes quite an impression. It has an artistic style all its own, which is both mesmerizing and startlingly beautiful at times. The way in which the story is presented, with very little care to what may be taboo or not, is kind of refreshing. The mature themes that makes this anime 16+ is what makes this anime great. It directly targets a more mature audience. I'd recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys darker anime and excellent story-telling. If I could, I'd recommend this to everyone but the mature situations can be a bit disturbing to younger audiences. I will, however, encourage any anime fan sixteen or older to pick up this series: it may end up being the next great anime to impact the American industry.",1144022400,7,2172,4.683246073298429
