5070283,4,B0079ZWUNY,"As a die-hard hockey fan I was eagerly awaiting the chance to watch this movie. In so many ways this is a new ""Slap Shot"" in the sense that hockey movies and can be great and hilarious. Sean William Scott playing the role of an enforcer is worth it. I wasn't pissed I spent $9.99 to watch it.",1330560000,,292,4.051724137931035
5070284,5,B0079ZWUNY,"I loved this film! If you are a fan of the gritty filming style of Slap Shot, you will get this. Language, gratuitous violence and brief sex and nudity. Oddly, a tender love story thrown into it works well. I enjoyed it from beginning to end.",1330300800,2,242,4.282608695652174
5070285,5,B0079ZWUNY,"Warning - This film has very over the top dirty language. If that's not your thing don't post a review about this movie. On to the movie: I watched the movie with my wife who is not a huge sports fan at all. Neither does she like blood much. This movie had pretty much everything a man loves about a movie - Action, Sports, Fights, Overcoming bull crap in your life. Then it throws in just enough of a romance to keep anyone else with a pulse interested in the rest of the movie. It's not too long, it's gets to the point and it pulls you in from the start if you're a hockey fan.

Just remember it's rated R.",1330128000,44,609,4.033057851239669
5070286,4,B0079ZWUNY,I will say my expectations were low. I have played hockey for a long time and even had a stint as an enforcer in Junior. From the previews I thought this movie would be fun but did not expect it to have as much heart as it does. The film does a nice job of showing the plight of the enforcer as well as the mind set it takes to be that guy.,1330128000,3,340,3.671232876712329
5070287,5,B0079ZWUNY,"I am a semi-recent hockey fan, female, from California, and also a big movie fanatic in general, and I found this movie to be entertaining, funny, fun, not too gory or anything... The main character was consistently charming and endearing in a sincere way... The pace was good. As a ""puckhead,"" I know what details are a lil bit exaggerated, but as a movie fanatic, the narrative was engaging, fast-paced, not too formulaic, adventurous, and simply sweet in all regards!!! I wish there were more movies like this out there! GO DOUGIE!!!!",1330128000,53,537,4.8478260869565215
5070288,4,B0079ZWUNY,"I play hockey. I love the game, ergo I love that someone made a hockey movie. That gets it up to 3 stars by itself, specially since it's based on a true story.

If you don't know much about hockey, you might take a star off but it's still an OK movie with plenty going on besides just clobbering people on the ice: there's the love story, the family story with the parents and the gay brother, the drinking and the comedy of college movies, and it will also show you more of an aspect of pro hockey that you probably didn't know about.

For the hockey crowd, constant minor equipment goofs and exaggeration / oversimplification of stereotypes will cost the movie one star, but a pretty major NHL cameo appearance might cancel that out (might not apply for non-goalies and Habs fans ;)

For both crowds alike, good but not great writing and acting will cost the movie a star.
I for one was excited to see well known names in the cast, but only Liev Schreiber was absolutely perfect in his role. The rest were a bit shy of a 5 star performance. I thought the movie could have been so much better with very little more.",1330041600,,1116,4.330143540669856
5070289,2,B0079ZWUNY,The only reason I watched this movie was too see and listen to Liev Schreiber. He is in only a small portion of the film. Other than him....the movie is garbage. All these 4-5 star reviews: you're joking right?,1511913600,,210,4.410256410256411
5070290,5,B0079ZWUNY,"A down-and-out bouncer discovers he has a talent for dolling out beatings in the hockey rink in Goon (2011), a surprising independent Canadian sports comedy film written by Jay Baruchel and Evan Goldberg and directed by Michael Dowse. Aside from being well made, Goon features a solid, nuanced performance by Seann William Scott.

Despite dismal box office returns, Goon is almost universally praised by critics. It currently has a rating of 82 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. I overlooked it many times, because although Seann William Scott has had funny side roles in some of my favorite comedies, I just couldn't imagine him as a leading man. I was so wrong. In Goon, Scott proves he is a competent actor capable of breaking out of the fratbro trope.

Doug Glatt (Seann William Scott), a tough but polite simpleton, is working a dead end job as a bouncer. His friend, Pat (Jay Baruchel), hosts a public access hockey call-in show. One night at an Orangetown Assassins minor league game, Doug gets into a fight with a player and the Assassins coach invites him to join the team as their enforcer. When his skills on the ice improve, hes recruited to play for the Halifax Highlanders and protect their star player, Xavier LaFlamme (Marc-Andr Grondin), who is slow to recover from a brutal knockdown.

Along the way, he falls in love with Eva (Alison Pill), an adorkable hockey fan who sleeps around with hockey players, but is in a relationship, and discovers he might one day have to confront Ross the Boss Rhea (Liev Schreiber), who was responsible for knocking out Xavier LaFlamme. Will he get the girl and defeat his rival?

Seann William Scott is an American actor predominantly known for playing Steve Stifler in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Pie/dp/B00IMYVCGW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Pie</a>&nbsp;films, as well as a host of other moronic, comic-relief roles. His portrayal of Doug in Goon reveals a nuanced side and shows he is maturing as an actor. I was impressed by this performance, and like Matthew McConaughey, who began his career as a stoner bro, as Scott gets older he may successfully transition to more dramatic roles.

Alison Pill is a Canadian actress who played Kim Pine in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scott-Pilgrim-vs-The-World/dp/B004BDJS9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scott Pilgrim vs. The World</a>&nbsp;(2010) and Maggie Jordan in the TV series The Newsroom (2012-2014), though she has been acting since childhood. Alisons character, Eva, is a subverted version of Adrian from Rocky. As Dougs love interest, Eva is not well-developed, which is a shame because even though their relationship is given plenty of screen time, she tends to fade into the background. We never learn much about her other than her passion for hockey and unfaithful promiscuity.

Goon doesnt disguise its similarities with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky/dp/B0017VT5E8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky</a>&nbsp;(1976), another film about a dimwitted but polite muscle who rises to prominence in a violent sport. Goon raises the violence in hockey to a level in which you almost forget the point of the game is to score goals. It focuses almost entirely on Dougs bouts with the other players, and the exaggerated level of brutality would be gratuitous if it wasn't so well-crafted.

Goon shares similarities with other films as well. A scene in which Doug Glatt meets Ross Rhea in a diner is reminiscent of the famous restaurant scene in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heat/dp/B06XCBHDHH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heat</a>&nbsp;(1995). These callbacks to famous films is probably why Goon is so good, since the filmmakers decided to replicate proven success. Unfortunately, either the subject matter doesnt really appeal to American audiences or the film wasn't properly advertised, and it was not commercially successful. A sequel, Goon: Last of the Enforcers, came out this year to mediocre reception.",1511568000,,4111,5.751644736842105
5070291,5,B0079ZWUNY,Love this movie! So many great one-liners. Hilarious and will watch over & over again!,1511568000,,86,4.8
5070292,5,B0079ZWUNY,a silly funny movie. looks kinda like they actually did some of their own skating and stunts.,1511568000,,93,4.529411764705882
5070293,5,B0079ZWUNY,Love this damn movie. Worth the watch but not with kids,1508976000,,55,4.090909090909091
5070294,5,B0079ZWUNY,"Sweet polite young man and his loud foul mouthed friend go to their local hockey game. Without spoiling any thing for you, this soft spoken young man gets noticed in the best way by the coach of the team and the entire arena. His life changes, he finds what it means to be apart of something bigger than himself.

Now if you, like I, love... and I mean LOVE old school hockey games. This is the movie to watch.

I could easily do without Jay Baruchel in this movie and in its sequel. He lines are beyond vulgar so are his actions. But since he is one of the writers, I give him a pass.",1508889600,,585,4.078260869565217

5070298,5,B0079ZWUNY,"I guess there's not enough time to list all of the reasons why I love this movie so much. so I shall summarize it in one word: simplicity. The first five minutes are more than enough to get you in context and understand what's going on: a not-so-bright bouncer with unsupportive parents (and with a clear preference towards his doctor brother) realizes he doesn't have ""a thing"" (as he calls it) and finds purpose and meaning in his life by joining a local hockey team.
When the story begins to develop, we can observe the protagonist's (Doug ""The Thug"" Glatt) growth as both a hockey player and as a person, but always keeping it to the ground. Doug eventually moves to the minor leagues to a team that is struggling to make it to the playoffs, where his role is to protect the star player who has fallen from grace after an unfortunate encounter with the movie's antagonist (Ross ""The Boss"" Rhea). I love how the movie manages to be exaggeradtely funny and violent yet still realistic and relatable. There are no unnecessary flashbacks of chilhood dreams nor slow-motion suspenseful shots. There are no championship curses nor the pursuit of glory at the highest level. It all comes down to a group of average Joe's who are struggling to make it to the playoffs. The team members are very easy to relate to and the locker room scenes are memorable (best motivational pre-final-game-speech I've seen on a movie).
In addition, there are other topics such as romance, family relationships, friendship and search for identity that are both accurately and briefly addressed. Most of the time is used for action, so there are no time-wasters during the film.
If to all of the mentioned above we add the acting (Liev Schreiber's performance is brilliant and the diner scene is the perfect example), the soundtrack, the characters, and the well-kept pace, we can easily say we are in front of a truly hidden gem.",1505174400,,1906,4.743975903614458

5070311,5,B0079ZWUNY,"Great movie Seann William Scott plays as far from Stiffler as he could go in character Doug Glatt and Liev Schreiber is a god as Ross ""The Boss"" Rhea.

5070522,4,B0079ZWUNY,"I don't know why, but Ive always liked movies about hockey. Goon sparked my interest a few years ago when I first saw it pop up and some of my friends started talking about how good it was. I had never heard anything about it before, and thought it was just a throwaway movie that Sean William Scott did for a quick buck. Nope!

Doug Glatt is a nice guy. Dumb, but nice. One day he goes to a hockey game with his brother, and after one of the players starts yelling homophobic things, Doug gets defensive and proceeds to beat the guy senseless. This catches the attention of the coach, and he recruits Doug, teaching him how to play hockey in the process. In no time, the coach realizes that Dougs potential is being wasted, and sends him to a better team that could one day have a shot at winning the Stanley Cup. The players on the new team don't take this very well. After all, Doug is nothing but a brawler. His main purpose on the team is to take out the problem players on the opposing teams, not score goals. One guy who takes the most offense to this is Xavier LaFlamme, who was a star player before he took a nasty shot from the bad boy of hockey- Ross Rhea. Doug is just trying to maintain his new life on the team while dealing with his parents who don't like his new career choice, and see it as a hobby more than anything else. He also meets a very cute girl named Eva at the bar after a game one night. The problem is that she has a boyfriend. Is Doug going to be another statistic in the nice guys finish last story?

Goon starts out slow, and I was worried during the first 10 or 15 minutes that this was going to be a typical comedy aimed at teens with some of the jokes they were making. Fortunately, it picked up and from then on, became a pretty cute, fun movie to watch. Sean William Scott does a good job playing whats essentially the opposite of his best-known character, Stifler. Doug Glatt is a nice guy, whos practically a Boy Scout when hes not on the ice. When he meets Eva, hes a gentleman and doesnt act like some braindead jock. In fact, hes one of the few guys on his team that isn't rowdy. You never want anything bad to happen to this guy, and any time he starts to brawl during a game, its hard to not want to see him knock the teeth out of the other guy because hes just that likable. Alison Pill makes for a great love interest as Eva, who early on, comes out and says that she sleeps around a lot. Amazingly, they didn't make her some sleazy character. Evas nice, funny and has a fun personality that makes you hope her and Doug end up together. As for the rest of the cast, some of my favorite moments came from Dougs team. This isn't the Mighty Ducks, and most of the guys get at least one good line in or have some defining moment. You have the old, drunk team captain who probably shouldve retired 5 years earlier, his lackey thats just as goody-good as Doug, two Russians with broken English that have a weird obsession with male genitalia, and the goalie who really, really loves his mom. So much so, that he has photos of her all over his helmet, and talks as if shes there with him at the goal sometimes. None of these characters feel forced in, and they only stay on-screen for as long as they're needed. This is Dougs story after all.

While its more on the cute side of the comedy spectrum, Goon doesnt pull any punches (no pun intended unless you actually laughed at that) and has some pretty brutal fights. Guys are rammed into walls, get decked repeatedly, and lose lots of blood. One of the most painful looking scenes is near the end, when so many players go after one person intentionally that they really do a number on him, even using their skates on his legs. The fights are scattered through the movie in a way that keeps anything from dragging on. I also have to hand it to Curt Keilback, a real hockey play-by-play announcer. The lines he delivers are so natural and he has a lot of funny one-liners that may be missed because he puts them into the sports talk so seamlessly. I was laughing more at what he was saying than almost everything else in the movie.

I was happy watching this one. The whole movie just had a good feeling to it, and it was cool to see Sean William Scott trying a different character. It was also cool to have a sports movie that wasn't about believing in yourself, but instead to just focus on what it is you want in life and go with it.",1443571200,,4425,4.220779220779221

5070646,4,B0079ZWUNY,"SLAP SHOT FOR THE NEXT GENERATION

I took a shot on this movie tonight on the FireStick as it was a free Prime movie. That was a good choice!

It's basically Slap Shot for the modern era. For that matter it would have worked in the 70's as well. It's a good time movie. Don't expect Oscar nods. But it's a fun 2 hours of your time if you're a hockey fan.

The story is entertaining. The acting is pretty decent. The only real down sides of the film are Seann William Scott's parents who disappear from the movie without further mention. And it has an abrupt end with a few of the story elements no fully closed up.

But all in all it's a good fun hockey movie.

If the F word offends you, keep moving. Don't try this movie for even a second. Like literally not a second.

He'll look you in the eye as you talk and actually listen to what you say.  He has a natural ability to fight.  He will be as polite as can be to everyone he meets, but if you disrespect or try to hurt his family, friends or teammates then you're done for.  He will beat the crap out of you.  It's not that he likes to fight.  He's just good at it.  He doesn't fight with anger.  It's just something that needs to be done.  He takes care of it and he doesn't regret it.  If you're disrespectful in his eyes then he makes you pay.  I enjoyed watching his respectful attitude transform his team in this movie.  My only beef, (a small one), was the girl.  I never really liked her.  I tried, but just couldn't get there.  That didn't keep me from enjoying the movie and giving it the five stars it deserves.

The guy is awesome.  The movie is the right combination of quality and cheesy that I like.  I have seen this movie maybe a dozen times now and still think it is hilarious.

5070703,4,B0079ZWUNY,This was one of the best hockey movies I have ever seen. Slap Shot and Youngblood combined. Some parts were quite funny. Lots of blood but that's hockey fights. The cursing and sexual slang is just downright raunchy and a wee bit over for my liking. Definitely not a movie for under age 18. Seann does a great job. He's known for his smarty pants roles but this showed his ability. His best yet. Not really a tough role for him but definitely different from his regular stuff. Liev Scheiber (sp?) was great as usual. He didn't have a big part but he was still great. Good movie for a Sunday with brews and buds if you're jonesing after hockey season.,1427760000,,650,4.380165289256198

The director took what could have been a very run-of-the-mill story about a chump going to the ""majors"" and added enough style and twisted sensibility to make you sit up and take notice. Within the first fifteen minutes, you know you're in for the find of sports film you haven't quite seen before. ""Slapshot"" does the straight ""hockey drama"" and just about any Will Ferrell sports film does the ""idiot-in-professional-sports"" humor, but this is one of those sports comedies that actually does a good job with both elements together and doesn't suffer in the process.",1421107200,,694,4.743801652892562

5070812,5,B0079ZWUNY,The movie was well told of this guy who feels he ain't good at anything in life until one day he gets into a fight with a hockey player which gets him on a hockey team where he's their Goon. The reason people and I can relate to this is because sometimes it's hard to find out where you belong that fits you and that's what this movie teaches us about.,1419465600,,352,3.971830985915493
5070813,5,B0079ZWUNY,"This was the perfect role for Sean William Scott. He is exemplary at playing the not-too-bright, but lovable, ""goon,"" and he nailed it with this one. Scott is a bouncer with limited book smarts who is surrounded by a family of doctors that treat him as an outcast.  His mother and father are disappointed in his career choice, and they simply do not understand that his I.Q. level isn't at equilibrium with theirs or his gay brother's ... basically, too smart for their own good. At a local hockey game he is attending, an enraged player from the opposite team jumps the plexi-screen and ambles his way up and into the bleachers. Doug Glatt, Scott's character, proceeds to beat the holy crap out of the dude before he can do major damage to any of the fans. A scout from an upper-level hockey team witnesses the scuffle and invites Glatt to join up with the hockey league to be a ""goon."" The story takes off from there, and it is a delight. Bloody, but delightful, nonetheless.

Jay Baruchel seemed to be trying too hard to be comedic, and we probably could have done without his constant barrage of unnecessary F-bombs, because he wasn't funny in the least, but other than that, this Internationally lauded movie was a gem. Liev Schreiber was at the top of his game. Alison Pill was cute as a button, and classically trained actor, Kim Coates, from Sons of Anarchy fame, was exceptional, as he is in everything he does. Kim was even nominated for Best Performance By An Actor In A Supporting Role in the 2013 Canadian Screen Awards for his part in ""Goon.""

5070836,5,B0079ZWUNY,"I don't know how to easily explain the way the movie accomplished this emotional transformation without completely deserting the comedy aspect.  A comparison as to how drastic this movie transitioned would be to other comedies that have a slapstick style, but also have the main character mature throughout, then end in a way that leaves you  in a feel good happy kind of way,  such as The Waterboy, or happy Gilmore. only difference being that this movie did all those things but in a way that literally left you full of raw emotions, at times actually holding back tears, whether for happiness or sadness, or pure compassion for the Goon character because they are able to build a huge emotional attachment to Scotts Character as the movie goes on much the same way you get attached to dramas. It also retained the comedy aspect throughout. Most comedies have to drop the comedic aspect along the way to make it more emotional, this one did not do that.
I rate this a perfect 5 due to the way it is written as a comedy yet seems to touch all movie genres and categories, anywhere from drama, to suspense, to love, to action, to family and friendships, to tear jerker,  and they even made sure to theme it around sports for good measure. Ive seen tons of funny movies that become emotional and tear jerking movies, like most romantic comedies, or comedies that end up dropping  a lot of the comedy aspect in order to get viewers more emotionally attached, but nothing Ive seen is similar to how Goon transformed as a movie. I honestly don't know how a comedy that is somewhat heavily slapstick, was able to hit me in the deepest way on all my emotions and end up being a tear jerker with laughter from beginning to end as well.",1418601600,,1728,4.543408360128617

5070861,1,B0079ZWUNY,"One of the WORST movies I've seen lately. Their are only three topics in the entire movie....
1) Filthy language.
2) Punching people into a coma.
3) Blood flying everywhere.

I saw the reviews and it was rated highly so I gave it a chance, and from the opening moment it's non-stop MEANINGLESS VIOLENCE that is NOTHING like reality in hockey. NOTHING!

The violence and filthy language is simply written in because this is a violent country with violent people living here, simple as that. WE LOVE blood and guts  and peoples agony, that we don't even notice anymore we're so hardened in our approach to it.

This movie is worthless I thought and I couldn't make it to the end by any means but was told the ending was terrible and  changed nothing and had NO VALUE AT ALL. Neither do I find these three topics entertaining.

I find it sad and disappointing what we've become in this land and assume the hundreds that wrote good reviews here are just kids and have no power in this society, but the problem is that............ one day soon, they will have power.",1416096000,,1061,4.528795811518324

I had never heard of the film until I saw it on Netflix and immediately hit the play button because it was a hockey movie (which I love) and Seann William Scott (again, love). Expecting the raucous, but hilarious character in which Seann William Scott is typically cast, I was pleasantly surprised by his well-acted departure into the sweet, extremely polite, not-too-bright, but definitely lovable goon with a talent for decimating his opponents. And certainly not to go unmentioned are the always amazing Live Schreiber as the ass-kicking hockey icon, Ross ""The Boss"" Rhea and Jay Baruchel, ""the wise-cracking, lovable Mick best friend"". Really, the entire roster was perfectly cast talent and the story is fun, poignant and packed with humor and violence. What more can you ask for?",1413936000,,818,5.111940298507463

5070892,5,B0079ZWUNY,"An amazing movie with everything. We thought it would be a silly brainless comedy but it really was dear and touching. The violence is brutal but doesn't last long - It's just part of the story, but is not the story. It's a buddy flick, a love story, a coming into yourself story, a comedy, a tear jerker - I would have expected it to win many awards. Scott is brilliant as the innocent, loyal Doug the Thug. The story is about relationships - with his parents, with his obnoxious best friend, with a woman he cannot have, with the man he is poised to replace in hockey as an enforcer, with his team, and especially with his former hockey star teammate/roommate. The change in team morale, the lessons passed on by his retiring arch rival, the great romantic line from his girlfriend ""You make me want to stop having sex with lots of men,"" that he is Jewish and a normal person which is sadly too rare in the media, the cameo by the actor who played Ricky in TPB (a former hockey player himself whose name I should remember since I even saw them live in TO), the... Canadianness of it, yes, there is a lot of swearing and some bloodshed on the ice because it's about hockey after all, but there is no almost no sex and it felt... wholesome. We were filled with adrenalin at the end, as if we saw an amazing hockey game live. It's cliche but I laughed and I cried and I wanted to cheer at the end. An actual feelgood movie.

5070946,5,B0079ZWUNY,"This movie kind of fell between the cracks when it was made, so I doubt that many people have heard of it.  That's a shame, because this is really a gem on multiple levels.  The obvious comparison is to Slap Shot from 1977, in that both movies are comedies about minor-league hockey teams and focus on the violence in the sport.  The difference is that in Slap Shot, the ""goons"" were the bad guys, and here, the goon is the good guy.  His job is to protect the players on his team from the goons on the other teams, who want to physically take out the best players on his team. The ""goon"", Doug ""the Thug"" Glatt (played perfectly by Seann William Scott), is a not-very-bright guy who nonetheless has a heart of gold and wants to do something worthwhile with his life.  He stumbles on his career when he goes to a hockey game and punches out a player who is trying to beat up his best friend (the incredibly obnoxious and foul-mouthed Pat, played hilariously by Jay Baruchel).  The team owner is impressed and gets him to try out for the team, and after beating up half of the players, he's in.  We see him start off as just a goon and eventually become the heart and soul of his team after showing time and again that he's willing to do anything to help the team get ahead.  The film has a lot of big laughs, and the trailer definitely makes it look like a dumb comedy, but the movie is so much more than that.  It's about Doug's big heart and his efforts to find a place where he belongs despite having nothing going for him but his muscles.  There is also a surprisingly touching love story with his love interest Eva, who has a boyfriend and sleeps around, but who eventually is won over by Doug's affection and utter sincerity.  The movie is full of oddball characters, but you end up loving all of them, and you start to understand what hockey means to this bunch of unruly misfits.  To enjoy this movie, though, you had better be able to handle an awful lot of bloody fights and constant, unremitting profanity.  If you can, then you're in for a treat.  Also: I grew up in Canada, and the movie is Canadian through and through, right down to the soundtrack which features Canadian songs I haven't heard in years.  If you're from Canada, that will be an extra added pleasure.  One last thing: the most amazing thing for me about watching this movie was that there was one line that simultaneously brought a tear to my eyes and made me laugh out loud.  I think that's exactly what the filmmakers were going for.",1404432000,5,2515,4.3626609442060085

5070953,5,B0079ZWUNY,"Surprisingly good acting for what seems like a low budget flick. If you're familiar with the old Slap Shot movie, this one really has a bit more hockey 'realism' to it. The movie focuses more on the main character (who is a loveable doofus), his development as a player and how he inspires a rag tag bunch of losers to jell as a team. There's a nice assortment of characters in the locker room, reflective of today's minor leagues with Euro's trying to make it (unheard of back in the 70's when Slap Shot was made). Pretty reasonable depiction of hockey team antics, their love of women and drinking. I was surprised by the movie and just had to watch it twice.

The cast is terrific, Sean William Scott turns in a great performance, It would have been nice if Eugene Levy or Liev Schrieber had a bit more screen time, but both actors were well utilized.  While there is plenty of crude language, the underlying story is still worth watching.",1401148800,,448,4.518518518518518

5070964,5,B0079ZWUNY,"I noticed this movie in the redbox a few months ago and it caught my eye because of Seann William Scott. His movies are generally amusing and watchable. I noticed a few people mentioning it on twitter and looked it up to find that several other good actors were in it. I sat down to watch it and within the first few minutes was HOOKED. This movie is awesome on many levels. The lead character is the lovable dope who you have to love, and he kicks ass. The movie is pretty funny all the way through as well. Overall, I rate this 5 stars. I'm not a movie expert or a critic, but I do know a good movie. This is a good movie, I'm glad I took the time to finally watch it.

They try to give it a moral, while throwing in pointless filth and a female role that has absolutely NOTHING to do with the story. Is this the way of movies nowadays and people just go along with it and call it a great movie because it has comedy, sex, and drugs?? No wonder the USA is called the dumbest country on the planet.

5070991,5,B0079ZWUNY,"This now ranks up there with my favorite sports movies! You can't help but to be sweet on the main character, Doug, played by Sean William Scott. Scott is a total pleasant surprise in this movie- usually he plays over the top annoying characters but here he is warm and endearing, albeit a brutal fighter. Doug is a simple minded goon looking for a purpose in life, his brother is gay, and his girlfriend's a slut. His best friend brings in some really juvenile humor. There are some genuinely funny lines though, like when his girl is crying Doug asks, ""What's wrong? Have you been watching Rudy?"" hahaaha! It's really about teaching us all the lesson that we should strive to be good people, even despite our shortcomings. Stick around through the credits, there is actual fight footage of the guy the story is based on.",1390089600,,822,4.636986301369863
5070992,4,B0079ZWUNY,"I was expecting this to be a complete dud but had a friend recommend it and tried it out anyway.  Seann William Scott is a bar bouncer and a dumb one to boot.  The guy gets into a fight with a hockey player and is then recruited to play semi-pro hockey.  It's about the same caliber as Slap-Shot.  His sidekick friend throughout gets annoying because he talks too fast and most of his lines are peppered with F-Bombs.  The story is fun and there are some hilarious one-liners throughout the show.  If you like the fighting aspect of hockey, you'll enjoy this one.  Not for kids who can't watch the raunchy comedies.",1389830400,,615,4.4375

Don't watch this with a young child or your grandma though, I'd say the use of the f-bomb and other words some may find offensive is quite liberal in this one, but oh well, it is a hockey movie.

My only real complaint with this movie is Jay Baruchel's character. The first time you see him he is pretty funny, then after about 30 seconds of him you've seen enough. I like Jay in most of his roles, but there are a few I wish he would dial it back a bit with, but what do I know.

The highlight for me was the addition of Live Schreiber, with his legendary acting skill, as Ross 'the boss' Rhea, and Kim Coates as the Halifax coach.

Most folks are partial toward the sexy offensive machine, the Gretzkys and the Howes and the Lemieuxes. And, sometimes, folks favor the underappreciated bully, the Terry O'Reillys and the Tiger Williams. GOON leans toward the latter. It celebrates the designated enforcer. But you never met a sweeter thug than Doug Glatt.

GOON is a Canadian film, shot north of the border, where they play the hockey. But the film opens in Orangetown, Massachusetts, where good-natured bouncer Doug Blatt (Seann William Scott) is taking in a hockey game with his casually profane best pal, Pat Houlihan (Jay Baruchel). Pat hosts ""Hot Ice,"" a website/cable access show dedicated to hockey. And during that game attended by Doug and Pat, when an enraged player ventures off the ice only to get his a-- whupped good by Doug, ""Hot Ice"" presents a venue to celebrate Doug's brawling prowess. And when the coach of the Orangetown Assassins calls in to offer a tryout for Doug, well, there goes Doug dreaming big, hoping to finally earn his parents' approbation. It's been tough going, what with Doug coming from a Jewish family of doctors. He probably shouldn't have shown up for his tryout wearing figure skating boots.

Early assessment says that Doug can't skate, can't play hockey, is like a meandering lump on ice. But the coach sees potential in Doug. He likes his bruising style. In hockey, one can never have enough of them goons safeguarding their teammates' backs. Doug is told: ""You're like the Hebrew Dolph Lundgren!"" and also ""You've been touched by the fist of God."" So this is Doug getting re1igion.

As Doug and his team make noise in the league rankings, as a groundswell of opinions manifests touting him as the next great enforcer in hockey, it's inevitable that people start dreaming of matching our rising star against the league's most dreaded bully Ross Rhea (Liev Schreiber).

I think this is my favorite movie with Seann William Scott. GOON surprises you with its big heart, and the propers must be extended to Baruchel because he wrote the thing and to Seann William Scott because he brought to the screen a character that could've easily veered off course but instead became instantly likable and relatable. Doug Blatt is such a sweet simpleton. There's not one moment where you're not on his side. In a way, his innocence and good heart allow him license to pound the living crap out of people.

GOON is also surprising in that it's a tender love story about an idiot and a s1ut. Alison Pill (who at the time was engaged to Baruchel) is very good as Doug's conflicted romantic interest, Eva. She informs him: ""You make me want to stop sleeping with other guys."" So, no, this isn't Jane Austen's GOON. But you must trust me when I say that it's a tender love story. This is Doug falling in love.

Baruchel could've written Ross Rhea, Doug's nemesis, as a cardboard villain. Instead he makes Schreiber's character a three-dimensional character. Ross Rhea is written as a sympathetic villain, an aging warrior teetering on hanging it all up but longing to go out in style. In Doug, he sees his perfect ending. He respects Doug but should they meet on the ice, he'll be more than happy to lay him out. When he finally tangles with Doug, yeah, you root against him. But you're not hating on him. You understand him.

GOON's best funny bits don't come so much from Doug's sketchy teammates, and certainly not from the wiggy goalie who cautions and then asks Doug during their first meet: ""Two words, man: Stay away from my Percocets, and do you have any Percocets?"" No, the humor comes from the juxtaposing of Doug's simple nature against those more sophisticated (read: cynical, cruel) than him. Amazingly, I never felt that the film was making fun of Doug for being dim-witted. I never thought he was a loser. Maybe because Doug, in his way, is such a strong person. He's secure in what he knows and what he does and what he believes in. He stands his ground. He never gives up.

For some folks GOON won't be their cup of tea. There's plenty of face-smashing, jersey-tugging, fist-flurrying bits that go on. But if you're a fan of hockey and a fan of the sports underdog, then this should go down like a cup of Lipton or Oolong or Masala Chai. Hockey and fighting and tea, yeah, that's how we roll.

I knew nothing of this before seeing it at the library, but having grown up playing a lot of hockey I will watch any of the very few hockey movies ever made. Slap Shot is of course the classic, but I've got to say I like this even more, as it really feels like Canada in so many ways, and hockey is to Canada what baseball, football and basketball are to the US, combined.

There are many absolutely hilarious moments, especially if you really love hockey and appreciate the absurdity of ice fighting. I had to hit pause maybe a dozen times so I could finish laughing. Goon is so Canadian and so precisely hockeyish; Hollywood will NEVER come this close to what hockey really is. And Scott is so good it's hard to believe; he always seemed like a basic jokester before, but he performs on another level here and makes his character truly come alive. Everybody is great in Goon except Baruchel, who is too over the top even for a satire like this. But he did co-write it, so slack shall be cut. Scott makes up for it with an incredibly earnest performance; honest to god, it's dang near Oscar-worthy in its low key brilliance. Liev Screiber also turns in a convincing, surprisingly relaxed take on the aging goon whom Scott must of course battle. That lack of constant over the top is why Goon is a little funnier than Slap Shot, all told. It's less a farce and more of a straight up comedy-drama.

The endless asides and subtle moments make Goon work, and the not-subtle-at-all violence might be the main thing that turns some folks off. But as someone who grew up watching the Broad Street Bullies and laughing every time Dave the Hammer got on the ice, I found it all accurate. I was a decent young player, captain of the team, all-star, blah blah, but despite being big for my age I soon found after some seriously crushing hits in the corners that big is not huge, and only the huge tend to make it, and that's kind of what Goon points out: this is a game for large, violent men. Not many Muggsy Bogues in the NHL! If you like hockey you get that, and won't mind the fights here.

If you can't stand blood, avoid this film. And that goes double for f-bombs. Yet that is exactly how hockey players talk. I grew up amongst them and as one of them and still know some, and they make every other sport's players seem mild-mannered in comparison. It's a fast hard sport and there's nothing PC about it.

What's truly unique about Goon is that all the blood and fighting comes with a surprisingly touching love story that actually works, mainly due to Scott's excellent performance and his chemistry with Pill. It's a lot like Rocky in that respect, but honestly I think Scott is better than Stallone. Sacrilege! Watch and see if you don't agree.

Lots of good extras and interviews make this a nice disc, and if Goon doesn't end up being hailed in a few years as the best hockey film yet made, Slap Shot included, then I'll eat my shinpads.

It's a pucking good film, but it ain't PC, so if you can't stand a lot of pucking around, then get the puck away from Goon. But if you love hockey and love to laugh, then puckin' A, eh.",1369267200,17,3137,4.370497427101201
5071093,5,B0079ZWUNY,I have cultivated a love of hockey over the past decade. This is a great hockey movie. It's funny. Lots of hard hitting fun. Seann William Scott is perfect. If you love hockey this is a gotta see movie.,1369267200,,202,4.205128205128205

It's funny, and it's about hockey, so it will probably get compared to Slapstick, but it's got a little Rudy and Rocky in it too.  And there's a nice little love story to boot.

Seann William Scott is really good in it, and he is convincing in a different kind of role than we've seen him in before.

The film is surprisingly heartwarming (despite the violence) and I would recommend it to anyone who just wants to see a fun film that will leave you with a warm, triumphant glow.",1368489600,,592,4.297297297297297

I think it really hit the bull's eye of what it wanted to be.  Really great characters and great performances by everyone.  My buddies and I were skeptical thinking it would just be a farce.  We took a chance and everybody thought it was great.  We laughed pretty much all the way through and it ends great.  If you're looking for Les Miserables you'll be disappointed.  If you're looking for a good movie for a sports movie night you could do a lot worst.  If I were back at the university I'd throw a dorm party to watch this.

(By the way I'm born & raised in Kansas, USA. & have never been on skates) A note to those who may (should) see this movie...pay attention to the rating. It might not be for your kids who aren't older than 12. There are some AWESOME sexual references and a S*** load of blood. It's an AWESOME movie about HOCKEY!! In a nutshell, it is hands down the best movie I have seen in 15 years. (Honestly, it beats the piss out of the latest James Bond stuff & I am a fan)

5071148,3,B0079ZWUNY,"The movie is a bit gritty even for my taste but over all the story is awesome. Also be warned there are some very brief moments of nudity. Goon is supposedly based on a true story, I'm a sucker for these types of movies but the vulgarity level is much above and beyond what was necessary. If you can weather the storm and sit through it then you can be treated to an awesome story about a bar bouncer (Mr. Glatt) having a night out to the local hockey game and has to actually protect his friends because one of the local hockey players after being antagonized comes up to attack them. Glatt goes to town on the hockey player in such a manner that everyone there at the game was amazed. The Halifax Highlanders team coach ends up seeing Glatts take down and offers him a chance to have a position on their team as the Goon. The Goon is the go to guy to knock heads on the other team's more than rowdy players that are keeping them from scoring. So Glatt gets his chance to do something more than knocking heads at the local bar, a chance to make a decent income and do something he loves. There are also some very choice pieces of music in the soundtrack, Giacomo Puccini - Turandot: Finale, and portions of Nessum Dorma, VALLEYS - Ordinary Dream, Rush - Working Man and a few other great tunes so that's another side treat. I would rate it higher but the vulgarity in the movie is definitely on the high end, 3 stars is all I can give it. You only need so much vulgarity to get your point across I think it was overkill.",1363219200,,1521,4.212328767123288

He plays a goon who is rather slow in the head, but can take a punch and give one back with even stronger force. He is sent to the sent to play for a team who has an all star superstar player who has lost his confidence ever since he was taken out by who was Stifflers hero, but has now become the competition and the two prove to be the toughest men in the sport at what they do, but when will they collide?

For the first half of this film, it was pretty funny. However it takes a turn once William Scott ends up on the semi-pro team and meets a girl, and things become more heart felt than a comedy. I suppose a lot of comedies do this same thing, but by the end of this movie, you felt like you had seen this sort of plot a million times, you don't have to be clairvoyant or own a crystal ball to figure out how this one is going to end.

4 stars for the first half of the movie, cliche and done to death story after that.",1362700800,,1049,3.874418604651163

5071164,4,B0079ZWUNY,"Goon (Michael Dowse, 2011)

IMDB reports the release date of Goon as 2011 (specifically, it seems to have premiered at TIFF on September 10, 2011), but most of the world didn't get it until 2012. Which is why I've seen it popping up on best-of-2012 lists around the Internet all year. I agree 100% with these assessments--hilarious and heartbreaking by turns, Goon is another of those movies that makes me wonder why I find myself so in love with sports movies when, in general, I can't stand sports.

Plot: Doug Glatt (Scott) is a hockey fan with a gay brother. While attending a minor-league match, he gets incensed that a player uses a derogatory term for ""gay"" when insulting fans and, when the player hops out of the box to come put the hurt on some people, takes him out. The coach of the opposing team takes note, and hires Glatt for his fighting skills. Things happen quickly, and Glatt, now known as Doug the Thug, soon finds himself playing for a Halifax farm team (coached by Sons of Anarchy's Kim Coates), tasked with guarding former pro player Xavier LaFlamme (5150 Rue des Ormes' Marc-Andre Grondin), who got sent down to the minors after losing his nerve thanks to getting a beatdown from legendary enforcer Ross ""The Boss"" Rhea (The Manchurian Candidate's Liev Schreiber)--who himself has gotten sent down to the minors after too many suspensions. The paths are set, and you know all these folks are going to meet on the ice eventually...

Goon is, simply, one of the funniest movies I've seen in ages. Co-writers Jay Baruchel, writing his first screenplay--who also has a part in the film as Doug's best friend--and Evan Goldberg (Superbad, The Pineapple Express) turned in a real winner here, in no small part by making Doug Glatt, when he's off the ice, a genuinely nice guy, quiet and unassuming and really, really slow on the uptake. The romantic subplot between Glatt and not-so-nice-girl Eva (the wonderful Alison Pill, recently of Midnight in Paris) actually works the way it's supposed to, the minor characters are perfectly drawn, and some of the things that Glatt spouts at times... well, once you see the ""stomach light"" scene, you'll get what I'm on about.

Easily one of the best movies of 2012, even if it was released in 2011. ****",1361836800,,2263,4.750636132315521

5071170,5,B0079ZWUNY,"This is truly a comedy and real life mix.  The Goon is just what he is - a good old natured and fuzzy dude who just likes to be a part of something.  He knows that he is not a doctor like his brother or a family business man like his father, he is too plain and slow on the up take to deal with making the 9-5.  But he is good at what he does and that is fighting not hockey.  He makes the plot stick with help from his team mates.  Grab it if you wish to have a few laughs and a look at another side of life.  Seann and Liev are the stars of this little show on ice.",1361577600,,567,3.569105691056911

The ""Goon"" is the black sheep son of medical doctors and his gay brother who is also an M.D.  He makes his way from being a bar room bouncer to becoming the Mike Tyson of low-level professional hockey.  I laughed out loud throughout.

The scene when Doug first steps onto the ice, on his ankles, I laughed so hard that I cried. Seann William Scott is lovably dim-witted and Liev Schreiber as the veteran goon(much like Bob Probert). I could do without the girlfriend storyline but it is what it is. Watch this movie if you like sports and don't mind some potty humor.",1361059200,,463,4.2727272727272725

5071189,3,B0079ZWUNY,"I would follow Sean William Scott off a bridge and this is one of his finer performances.  When an actor takes a step out of his usual stereotype and he does that here.  The love story aspect to this movie is compelling and keeps you watching through the hockey bromance that occurs on ice.

Overall this is a wonderful movie and hockey is a sport that doesn't have enough quality films in its genre.  The family life social pressures storyline falls flat but they keep those scenes brisk and you don't get bogged down with them

My only complaint is the love of blood and violence.  The producer gets very in depth with the bone breaking, blood spitting, and teeth missing.  There is no reason this script wouldn't be just as engaging with less graphic violence.  The over use of computer graphics sells short a top notch story.  Your kids can not watch this unless you really want them to see some gore.",1359936000,,905,4.5030674846625764
5071190,5,B0079ZWUNY,"I skipped over this movie so many times. The only thing that made me consider it is that I am Liev Schreiber fan. So tonight I gave it a try.

Leiv Schreiber actually plays a small role but does a great job playing the iconic hockey star about to retire. The main actor, Seann William Scott, really surprised me. He does an outstanding job. He really makes you like his character. Although this is a movie about hockey, it's more about a guy named Doug that is a little bit on the special side.

I will warn you, the script writers favorite word is the ""F"" word. It is abundant in this movie. Don't watch this movie if you are offended by cussing, bloody fight scenes or anything related to 'locker room' type behavior.

This movie is funny, well done with some great acting. I really enjoyed it. A great Prime find.",1359849600,,816,4.355263157894737

5071192,5,B0079ZWUNY,A great hockey movie with an actual plot.  Slap Shot has always been at the top of the pile while discussing hockey movies but it is getting a bit dated.  This really updates the genre.,1359763200,,185,4.257142857142857
5071193,5,B0079ZWUNY,"A very funny,ribald,profane movie about a dimwitted bouncer who by dumb luck and 4 1/2 lb. fists becomes more than he dreamed possible. Alot of fun to watch.",1359590400,,157,4.642857142857143
5071194,3,B0079ZWUNY,"While this film in no way compares to the far superior ""Slap Shot"", it does a credible job as a comedy involving hockey with perhaps even some realistic drama.  Seann William Scott does a decent job playing the goon, a disheartened bouncer who gets a chance to use his skills as a hockey enforcer.  Seann wins over his naysayer teammates through grit and toughness and helps them regain confidence while experiencing plenty of his own growing pains learning how to skate and play hockey.

Seann slowly gains the teams respect and eventually takes on another legendary goon played by Liev Schreiber at the end of the film.

One thing to note, the writer of the film Jay Baruchel, unfortunately inserts himself into the film and his character (language/crude behavior) will likely put some viewers off.

Other than that, a very watchable movie.",1359244800,,842,4.901408450704225

Thats really too bad too, because this is a pretty good movie otherwise. I rented it from amazon because my son is a hockey player, and there aren't many hockey movies to choose from. After watching the first few minutes, however, I decided another movie might be more appropriate for him until he is older. I watched it, though, and wondered why someone hasn't invented an easy way to ""Filter"" user selected words from movies, so that users could turn R rated movies into PG, or even G.

But with the classic combo of SWScott and Eugene Levy I had to give it a glance- it was really, really good. I haven't seen SlapShot but now I really want to!

There are characters you love to hate- who you grow to love, plenty of locker room antics with homo-erotic undertones (between twins no less...) Of course, there's sports as well as a cute little love story of a hockey player who falls for a cute girl with a checkered past.

Any movie that congures physical sensations (butter flies, cringing, cheering) has done something right- the characterization was spot on and there are even points when the dialog pokes fun at that characterizatioin (the lovable, annoying friend :-)

5071226,4,B0079ZWUNY,"Regardless of your interest in hockey, this is a fun watch.

This simple and fun flick focuses on a ""smarter than you think"" young man who accidentally finds his niche as a hockey ""goon.""  Doug sees in ""black and white"" and has no pretentiousness about him.  And many folks interpret that as worthless and without potential.  So, Doug proceeds to excel at his new profession, make all the nay-sayers look the dufuses they are, and manages to teach the viewer an important lesson in expectations both internally and externally.  Most importantly, Doug displays his ability to live and learn!

For those sensitive to blood and foul language, be warned.  However, given the locations in which the story takes place, the language is somewhat realistic.  I love New Englanders and Canadians; and some use the f-word as a sport.  Bully for them.

And the acting is serious and well done.  Many of the characters TRY to be annoying and in the end, become lovable.  They all made fans of me.

The world would be better off with more folks like Doug!",1355097600,,1041,4.716666666666667

5071229,5,B0079ZWUNY,"Great movie! Full of violence and humor. If you love hockey, and violence, then you will LOVE this movie!! Besides the movie Role Models, this is definitely Seann William Scott's best!",1354838400,,184,4.967741935483871
5071230,4,B0079ZWUNY,"Seann William Scott plays against type and is quite excellent in playing the dumb but loveable hero of the movie, Doug Glatt.  Doug is trying to find a purpose in his life that does not include being a security guard.  He does not have the smarts like his brother or parents do.  However, he can deliver and take punches which is catches the eye of a local hockey team.  They bring him in to be a ""Goon"", an enforcer on the ice to protect the other guys on the team.  He eventually moves to upper league and soon has to see if he can be more than a Goon, but maybe a real hockey player.  All this is going while also dealing with his parent's disapproval of violence, courting Alison Pill's character, and protecting his team's star player from getting injured.  Not to mention having to eventually face Ross Rhea, hockey's head enforcer on the ice.

This all leads to some very funny scenes by the characters written by Jay Baruchel and Evan Goldberg.  The movie moves at quick pace and is clocked close to 90 minutes.  It is not a great film as there are some very silly moments where some things are rushed along to get the plot going and characters that were good only get a small amount of time.  The Russian players on the team are pretty humorous when they give their goalie a hard time.

Overall, this movie went under the radar at the box office, which is a shame.  The movie should be seen because it is a very good sports comedy.  Maybe the best since The Might Ducks came out.",1354492800,,1488,4.324909747292419

the main character is fun. he's just a simple guy that doesn't mind trading punches for a living.  his sidekick buddy is a little too over the top obnoxious and his love interest is a floozie that decides her hockey fighting goon is ""the one"".

5071250,5,B0079ZWUNY,"My 5-year-old son recently became enamored with hockey, and while I would never let him watch this film, I threw it on between studying for my Actuary exam and my job.  This was probably Sean William Scott's best performance because he actually had to move out of his typical doofus role.  He was sweet, endearing, and believable as a simple, straight-forward guy.  I was completely shocked.  The amount of blood was a bit much (it is a hockey film, however, so I should have expected that), but it ended well, if abruptly, but I liked that as well.  As others have stated in their reviews it starts off fast, keeps a fast pace, but at no point did my sense of disbelief get startled.  I ended the film wishing they would have kept going.  This is the kind of movie that could have followed the formula, but instead goes a bit Indie by leaving one with some questions, rather than lamely trying to tie everything up.  I liked that as well.

This movie seemed to border on trying to be serious, but the language brought it back down to earth, but then Scott would make it serious again.  It seemed like it wanted to show a side of hockey that the average non-hockey fan doesn't understand.  It's possible I am reading more into this film in that respect, as I have no real idea how hockey works.  But, I enjoyed it and that's what mattered.

I had very little expectations, as I expected Scott to be his typical doofus role and when he portrayed a simple, well-meaning guy with some rather strong moral qualities, as I said before, I was pleased.  This really could have been just a dumb, forgettable teen movie, but I can see myself watching the film again.

Good stuff.

But be warned- this movie is not for the squeamish, those offended by vulgarity, or CHILDREN. It's extremely, shockingly graphic at times. Sure, it's a comedy, but it's a violent comedy that centers around the most violent aspect of an inherently violent sport: the fights! The plot is outlandishly stupid, yet it works brilliantly for the simple premise and the melee that ensues. Most surprising of all, this story is one that actually has heart (even as it makes you chuckle at its foolish jokes). It's also great to see Sean embracing a role that is modestly outside the comfort zone that he has been so thoroughly typecast within. Rather than being the arrogant, thickheaded galoot we've all come to love, he instead takes on the role of a humble, honorable, kind human being with a remarkable capacity for taking a punch (or giving one).

5071254,5,B0079ZWUNY,"There are going to be people who want to dumb this movie down to Hockey, fighting and blood, but the movie is so much more than that.

Sean William Scott is absolutely amazing as Doug. He plays the down to earth tough guy with a big heart with such passion and ease. I was completely rooting for Doug throughout the whole movie no matter if it was him trying to win the girl, gain the respect of his team, or taking his place as the top Goon. What I enjoyed the most was that they made Doug a good person who loves what he does, is loyal to his friends, family and team. They could have made him just another a-hole who hates gays and humps every girl around but they gave him heart and soul. Because Doug was such a loveable guy I wanted him to kick some butt, and I loved every punch and every tooth knocked out. This wasn't just about a guy beating some guys up, the end, it was about a guy accepting who he is and being proud of what he can do. Some people may want to say that's dumb and I am usually against violence myself, but there was much more to Doug than just fighting. I'm Canadian and I don't even like hockey that much, but Goon made me a fan, well at least a fan of the passion these players have for the game.

This movie was also laugh my butt off funny. Doug's lack of language skills when it comes to making quick witted come backs is hilarious. He's just so much better at throwing punches than throwing a verbal jab at somebody and when he's talking to the girl he likes he's adorably cute. Yeah I just said that... I found myself laughing at least every 5 to 10 minutes at something Doug awkwardly said or did. Plus it helps that pretty much every one else is funny as well. Jay Baruchel was so funny as the loud mouth best friend, Alison Pil was funny as Doug's love interest and I can't forget all the guys on the team. Pretty much everyone said or did something funny at least once in the film.

Goon was a perfect mix of heart and humour and I really can't think of too many movies that get it right. If I wasn't rooting for Doug I was laughing my butt off and I was thoroughly entertained by the acting, story and humour. The movie is now one of my all time favourite's and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1349308800,,2240,4.074829931972789
5071255,4,B0079ZWUNY,"It's a very entertaining hockey movie, reminiscent of ""Slapshot"".
I watched it mainly because I'm a huge fan of Kim Coates, who's hilarious as a minor league hockey coach who's constantly aggravated and probably has an ulcer and suffers from IBS.  As a hockey fan I enjoyed it a lot, although I probably missed out on a lot of inside jokes, since it's a Canadian film and I'm American. I could have done without the old ""I went to a fight and a hockey game broke out"" image, but I really am not familiar with Canada's minor league, so it may very well be authentic. Seann William Scott is very likeable as the big brute with a bigger heart. Alison Pill is so adorable I want to put her in my pocket. The humor is very different from a Hollywood film and that's a good thing. Liev Schreiber's role is far too small.
It was a very enjoyable film that could actually pass as a date movie because it's got romance in it, but not the over the top chick flick kind.  It's a great compromise if you're debating with your girlfriend on what film to watch.",1349136000,5,1047,4.309644670050761

5071258,4,B0079ZWUNY,"If you love the triplet goons from Slapshot, the over-the-top vulgarity of Stifler from the American Pie franchise, and are a hockey fan, stop reading this review and buy this movie immediately.  If any of the above is questionable, read on...

Goon tells a sort of reverse Happy Gilmore, where a fairly stupid, hockey-loving guy named Doug (Sean William Scott) falls into the perfect storm of circumstance and luck.  The result lands him with minor league hockey teams needing an enforcer, a goon, who dishes out assists with a left fist and goals with a right fist.  Along the way his best friend Pat (Jay Baruchel) assumes the role of Stifler, unleashing a series of F-bombs so thorough I now consider his lines in the screenplay to be the Bible of Swearing.  When his career and life begin to slowly coalesce, matters are complicated by a disapproving father (Eugene Levy), a prima-donna teammate named Xavier Laflamme (Marc-Andre Grondin) with a fear of contact, a slut named Eva (Alison Pill) who is hockey's equivalent to a baseball player's ""slump-buster,"" and an aging goon, Ross ""The Boss"" Rhea (Live Shreiber), with a reputation as the baddest man to lace up skates.

It doesn't quite have the influence of Slapshot, and it's nowhere near the heartfelt dedication to hockey's beauty seen in Mystery, Alaska, but it's pretty spot-on for the target audience.  The strength of the movie is its premise, not its performers.  Sean William Scott is funny as always; although, his Forrest Gump on skates impersonation wanes during the more challenging scenes.  Baruchel is funny at first, but by the 253rd time he screamed a profanity it made me yearn for Carlin's ""List of Bad Words""-routine.  Only Shreiber really impresses.  He stole the movie in my opinion.  It reminded me of how little screen-time Danny Trejo got in Grindhouse, yet fans clamored for a movie about the actual Machete.

While the balance of the film was about hockey and balance, the run-time was short enough that it would have been a much better movie if the focus was steered even further towards hockey, and away from the nearly impossible to tolerate love-interest angle.  The next time Baruchel gets involved with the production side of film-making, it'd be nice if he didn't force Allison Pill into the roll as the hot chick, because she's not.  At best she's a backup drummer, like in Scott Pilgrim.  Overall, however, it's great insight into the difficulties of minor-league hockey, a microscope on the often underappreciated goons of the hockey world, a movie about the often overlooked sport of hockey, and a reason for Liev Shreiber to flex his acting muscles.

Probably sold out theaters in Canada.",1348704000,,2687,4.935555555555555

I love action movies, I love sports movies, but this one could barely be called a movie at all!  I'm just stupefied by the reviews this has received.  Was it because of the corny comedy?  Was it because of the language and violence?  I don't mind any of those things in a movie, but when you combine it with contrived dialogue that not only sounds scripted but is delivered with such a absence of acting, it just becomes something absurd.

The only thing I liked about the movie was Liev Schreiber who, as usual, delivers a good performance, possibly one of the most underrated actors around.  I'd have given the movie two stars because of him being in it, but the movie was so poorly made and acted that I couldn't do it!

Goon is so appealing because its funny, the screenwriter has really done his homework, and who doesnt love Seann William Scott as Doug Glatt, our everyman enforcer/hero? Admittedly Im a bit of a hockey nut. I'll fly 2500 miles, watch Pittsburgh play two home games and fly 2500 miles back home. You could argue some of the bits in the movie are a bit over the top, but this is the movies, and I was completely entertained and inspired. I loved the use of Puccini's Nessun Dorma in the final scenes of the movie.

Even if you don't like fighting in hockey, the screenplay and direction was thrilling, and Seann William Scott is a charmer. The casting of Marc-Andr Grondin as Xavier LaFlamme was brilliant, the NHL has so many talented French Canadian players. I also loved Liev Schreiber's Ross Rhea, the enforcer on his last run. He made the finale, which obviously reminded me of Rocky Balboa and Apollo Creed.

The best part of the movie is Doug Glatt explaining how much he would do for his team. On good teams every player will do anything for his teammates to protect them and win. Guys sacrifice their bodies every night for the team. It is this kind of commitment that the players have that make fans like me fall in love with the game. A+",1346457600,,1438,4.505747126436781

5071273,4,B0079ZWUNY,"I don't recall having ever heard of this movie before, and when I first saw it I just thought it was some sort of silly little straight to DVD comedy, and let's face it...it can be hard to take Sean William Scott seriously sometimes.  Anyway, I decided to give it a watch online one day recently and I was actually kind of surprised by it...it was actually a pretty entertaining movie.  There were laughs and serious moments both in it, and even a touch of romance...and the actors all did a great job in it.  And actually based off a true story, I would never have guessed!  They actually show real footage of the guy Sean William Scott is suppose to portray during the credits, his obnoxious friend behind that camera that Jay Baruchel portrays.

To be completely honest, I feel that this is one of Sean William Scott's better roles in a while.  Jay Baruchel put on a good performance of his obnoxious friend as well, and Liev Schriber was as good as ever in it as well.  Alison Pill, the actress that play's the love interest in the movie, was really good too and looked really familiar to me, but I couldn't place it.  I searched her name on Amazon and most of what I came across I'd never seen or never even heard of, though most of them seemed to be good...but the one thing I did come across before it clicked was Scott Pilgrim vs The World.  LoL, good stuff!

The only one warning I will give about this movie is that there is some excessive vulgar & sometimes crude language throughout it...perhaps even a little overboard in a couple of parts I thought.  However, in the end, it didn't take away from my enjoyment of the film overall.  Some of the language use was, I must admit, actually well used in some cases and made me laugh.  I will say though that if you're sensitive to such heavy language & such, you should probalby avoid this movie, but if you're like me and can tollerate it, so long as the overall movie is good, then definitely give this movie a watch friends...it was actually pretty entertaining.",1345248000,,2023,4.420485175202156

Sean William Scott is excellent as the muddle headed ""goon"" and the ensemble cast portrays a group of absurd, and yet somehow still true-feeling, male characters.

It isn't a cinematic masterpiece so I am withholding one of the 5 stars. But it fully deserves 4 for its rawkus nature and humane spirit. Plus, bonus points for pints of blood hitting the ice.

[sidebar: I can sort of see why Goon wouldn't have done well at the box office. It can't really be defined as any one type of movie - comedy fanboys might not relate to the sports, sports fans aren't gonna love seeing a hockey movie with so few extended game sequences, teenagers might not get the sometimes sad and poignant feel and women prolly wouldn't have gone because, hockey. Unlike other ""vulgar"" comedies it has a slower pace and a female character who relates to the ""hero"" in a real way and isn't just the barely animated prize at the end.

Seann William Scott shines as the sweet bouncer-turned-hockey player who is good at one thing: protecting his teammates.

A must-see for anyone who likes a heartwarming underdog story but especially fitting for hockey fans and anyone who likes Slap Shot(1977).

One word of caution--if you can't stand the real violence that often comes with hockey, you might not like it here. But if you can, just remember it's a movie, all the blood is fake, and the story is so worth it.

5071290,1,B0079ZWUNY,"I truly thought Sean William Scott's typical character (raucous, sexist, full of energy) would translate perfectly to his role in this film (or at least what my perception of his role in the film was based on the trailers). I am sad to say, I was completely wrong. This is a movie I was dying to like, and as it continued I progressed through some theatrical equivalent to the five stages of grief and loss.

-Denial that it could be this bad-surely the story would redeem itself in the end.

-Anger that the sport I love could be treated so crudely. When Liev Schreiber's character two-hand's another player in the head with his stick it is treated as if it were commonplace. Jay Baruchel's character hoots with glee. No true hockey enthusiast would ever glorify or endorse such behavior, and certainly nobody that had ever actually played the game. Fighting is an important part of this fast and physical sport. Blows to the head like that (when they happen) are sources of shame and a disservice to the game (see Marty McSorely/Donald Brashear incident, McSorely never played in the NHL again).

-Bargaining: I rationalized that perhaps the stick swinging scene was a blip in the radar, a difference of opinion (though I found it hard to believe that many hockey fans would agree with its treatment in the movie). The rest of the movie would make up for it. After all, LaFlamme's character does at least have some pretty good hands (his goals are more believable than the Mighty Ducks, for example).

-Depression set in when I realized that this truly was a turd of a movie. I enjoyed few laughs despite the fact that Sean William Scott is one of my favorite comedic actors. He is borderline retarded and his romance in the movie doesn't even make sense in anything more than a rudimentary sense that we knew he had to have one because it's a mainstream film release (well sort of).

-Acceptance: As Doug's ankle broke (grotesquely), so too did my heart as I accepted that the movie was a hockey-flavored turd. There are redeeming qualities to it, but they are so few and overshadowed by so many inequities. If you are a hockey purist, don't waste your time. If your curiosity truly gets the best of you (as it did me) then rent, don't buy.

One final note: I was inspired to write this review when before a recent game at my local rink, the movie became the topic of conversation. About half of the locker room had seen Goon and the unanimous reaction was ""Don't waste your time."" Straight from a beer league locker room. Unfortunately, I can't think of a more fitting audience for the movie, and everybody hated it.",1343433600,2,2620,4.623655913978495

5071300,2,B0079ZWUNY,"I didn't know much about this movie except what the description stated; that it was written by the guys who did Superbad & Pineapple Express, and that it had Seann William Scott in it. I thought this would be a funny movie, but it turned out being weird indie like film, that didn't really amount to anything except for one big fight seen.

Seann William Scott played a quite, serious character that was dumb and liked to fight which coincided with hockey. He met a girl and fell instantly in love. Which is fine, but he didn't portray the character very well.  The character wasn't someone that you particularly liked or could get into. I kept waiting for him to be a dirty wise cracken prankster but instead he was just quite. Here is one of his pick up lines after he punched a guy he said excited and nervously; you have a pretty name...and and a pretty face...The girl just smiled.

There a was a good love story played by Alison Pill and the plot was actually decent believe or not, up until the ending. But the movie was predictable and didn't develop the characters or much of the friendships. Seann William Scott was not a believable shy hockey player. If you are looking for something like Superbad & Pineapple Express then this is nothing like those movies. That's why I am giving this 2 stars, if I had it to do over again I would not waste my time.",1342224000,,1361,4.414342629482071
5071301,1,B0079ZWUNY,"Acting seemed fine, plot was medium, characters were boring.

The only way this movie is interesting is if you A) enjoy watching two guys just punch each other in repetitive back and forth punching sequences or B) just freaking love hockey.

The female love lead (Alison Pill) was such a bad choice it was almost unbelievable. To be fair, it may have been true to reality, but she was an entirely unlikable character. This would not have been such a problem except the main character (Seann William Scott) was so unbelievably 1 dimensional that your only hope was that another character would pop him out of his mold. No other character did. He was as boring and unchanging at the beginning of the movie as he was at the end. This was actually kind of amazing in its own way. We have the main character, who is so boring that I almost don't want him on scene, and the female secondary character, who is so screwed up that you don't like her in any scenes. Almost, as if to add insult to injury, we have the rival (Liev Schreiber), who actually seems interesting and... well... charactered, but he has like 5 minutes in the entire movie. Mind blown.

Supposedly this movie is funny. That is what I am told. I won't say I never laughed, but its comedic value takes about 2 minutes of a 90 minute movie. Watching someone mumbly mispronounce words is not that funny. Profanity or vulgar language are sometimes funny as they are said, but do not make an entire scene funny.

The only consistent thought I had through this movie was, ""If the character was this dumb before ever getting on the ice,  imagine what he will be like after a few years of playing."" I admit, not the most intelligent thought, but in the context of this movie, it was an Einstein.",1342224000,2,1749,4.487421383647798

Normally I dislike the dude who plays the main character because he always plays in dude movies but in this case he is a rather loveable but sweet man who just happens to have fists of iron. The movie is intentionally over the top gory with some creative use of swear words and great physical comedy. Everybody is appropriately clad in flannel. The scenery is more realistic than glam and the individuals characters are funny and obscene. The script cleverly balances a fine line between endorsing stereotypes and sending them up and actually does both.

5071311,4,B0079ZWUNY,"Right up there with the &uuml;ber classic 'Slap Shot'. In some respects - better. Not every respect, but definitely a slice of its own pie, so to speak.

Notably, Amazon doesn't allow any quote from this movie. Nothing. And that's only part of what makes this so bleeping enjoyable. The other part is, surprisingly, there's an actual film in play here. A sincere tale about a quiet, unassuming and simple man: Doug Glatt, played by Seann William Scott, recruited to be a hockey team's ""goon"", the team enforcer.

While not a direct fan of the game, over the years I've read several articles in SI and other sports pubs about enforcers - former NHL player Doug 'The Hammer' Smith, whose life this film is based on, included. So I'm familiar enough with the term and the dirty, sometimes unappreciated, job of being the guy who goes out there to protect the shotmakers. Very similar to football where the quarterback and other offensive players receive the adulation and admiration, while the troglodytes who make the critical blocks are all too often forgotten.

And despite the hilarious raunchy context of this movie, and in all seriousness, there's a depth to this production well beyond the raw profanity and unchecked machismo. So much more than the plain boilerplate loser-makes-good platitude on celluloid.

Dougie finds himself lost - a bar bouncer and general maintenance guy without any real future. Not for lack of trying, but because he's a simple guy. We all know dudes like this, a heart of gold surrounded by a block of meat. The man may not become a doctor or debate middle east politics, but he's got your back when the chips are down. The one thing Doug is good at is taking and giving a beating, more the latter than the former. Interestingly, he takes no pleasure or pride in the brutality of fisticuffs, but understands it as a fish understands water - it just is. No more, no less. There's an echo of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Det-Bud-White/dp/B001CN2WXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Det. Bud White</a>&nbsp;in his performance that I really, truly enjoyed.

A night hanging out with his best bud at a hockey game forever alters his life path - one that ultimately leads to the biggest throwdown Doug could have ever imagined.

Have only a passing familiarity with Seann, but I know he's worked hard over the past decade to shed the goofy stoner image. Kinda thought his career would've have done better since his enjoyable characterization in '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rundown/dp/B001M9ELP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rundown</a>', but I'm pleased that he's taking these kinds of chances. Definitely a step in the right direction. Displaying a maturation and mentality of a seasoned actor - avoiding the shallow movie star acclaim sadly sought by so many.

In this production he showcases an ability that few actors actually possess - transformation. There are many movie stars that are essentially the same person in a different setting. We all know them, and they're paid handsomely for being those stars. But the actors? Those are fewer and much less heralded. And fewer still those that combine both elements.

Based on this project - I honestly hope Seann gets the roles his ability deserves. An actor easily equal that of Jeremy Renner insofar as talent and ability are judged.

Finally, props to Allison Pill as Eva, fouled-mouth self-described slut who falls in love for the first time. Enjoy it when the good girls go bad - only to go good again. And of course Liev Schreiber, in yet another incredibly subtle performance as the former top goon retiring after his final game. It's hard to imagine anyone stealing the show with such limited screen time, but he comes awfully close. You almost wish for a companion film about Ross 'The Boss' Rhea - his execution is that good.

Movie Note: Don't quit the film too early. When the credits roll viewers are treated to the real-life Dougie and his bud's 'best of' compilation. Funny stuff.

Personal Note: Am a monster fan of Liev Schreiber and this only validates, for me, that he's one of the most versatile performers out there today. Wish some producer could see the potential for an independent and separate '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Clark/dp/B00005JL8F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Clark</a>' film.

 If you like the real dynamics of hockey, the best punisher move I ever saw, in real life, was when the NY Rangers were playing the Philadelphia Flyers back in the late 1970's. One of the Flyers hit Phil Esposito with a cheap shot looking for a fight. Espo just skated around with a big smile on his face while the Flyer taunted him on camera, challenging him to fight.

What did I like? Like I previously stated, this movie is very funny. It's not a gross-out comedy like other recent comedies; it's genuinely a funny movie through its dialogue, not just its imagery. There are many memorable lines in this movie that I can't write on here because it's Amazon. It also has some awesome fistfights to really get you out of your seat. Goon is also very well paced and balanced. Also, although he'll always be Stifler to me, Sean William Scott gives an amazing performance. The rest of the acting was great and the music was superb.

What did I dislike? It's not flawless, but it does not have any significant flaws. If I had to say anything negative at all it would be that the movie plays out like a typical sports movie and doesn't really bother to innovate. (probably because it's based on a true story.

Overall, Goon is an amazing comedy and one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time. As of 6/28/12, Goon is available on Netflix Streaming and I highly recommend you check it out, even if you have to pay for it.

Goon has a minor sex scene, some nudity, plenty of sexual references, excessive language and blood/violence.

Not a huge pool to compare this too overall. So....I think it's better to simply judge this movie on its own merits. The ""Thug"", played by Seann William Scott, is a definite sympathetic character. Although he is pretty much an indomitable fighter, he's also just a plain old nice guy who simply likes to protect his buddies and teammates. I think Scott did a really great job with this character, where simplicity was more important in developing depth of character than witty acting lines. Basically, this movie chronicles his characters life from a bar bouncer to a semi pro hockey player, and shows how depth of character and a will to persevere can sometimes trump intelligence and trendiness. The hockey scenes were pretty awesome and often funny. The only thing I really didn't like about this movie was Jay Baruschel's scenes overall. They were funny at times, but for the most part, I was ready for the scenes he was in to simply be over. It's interesting to me because I generally like him alright, and I know he wrote (or helped write) and produced this movie. He just seemed out of place in the flick itself though.

5071341,4,B0079ZWUNY,"This movie was pretty good and interestingly enough it was actually according to ESPN based on a true story about a boxer who turned into a hockey goon and played in the AHL with 0 assist and 0 goals.  In the film Doug Glatt the main character played by Seann William Scott actually gets one goal and a few assist if that counts for anything against the original Goon story.  And basically the plot is Doug is recruited to the Highlanders minor league hockey team from a lower level minor league hockey team he just got on with having no experience on the ice what so ever (just in the ring as a boxer) to be a goon, fight, play dirty, and protect the whole team mainly their once great scoring winger Xavier LaFlamme who was never the same once Ross ""The Boss"" Rhea the king of Goons in the movie who is still in the hockey league Doug ""The Thug"" Glatt plays in put an illegal hit on him suspending the Ross The Boss for 20 games.

All in all the movie had some funny parts in it along with a good plot as mentioned above.  And this film did have good actors in it.  But it still wasn't as good as the first Slap Shots film which is why it gets 4 stars even though it did have more blood and fighting in it then any hockey movie I've ever seen.

Yes he was funny in American Pie but he never showed an ability to play any other type of character until this movie. While this movie may not change your opinion on hockey, it most definitely will with respect to Mr. Scott.  The dude can really act.  So not only is he not a distraction he's great -- as is the movie. This movie had all of the markings of a Dolf Lungren, What's his name Austin over the top type of movie but it wasn't.

""Goon"" (2012)
--------------------------------------------------------

This is an unexpectedly delightful sports comedy about a hockey ""goon"" (one of the guys who on-purpose gets in bloody fist fights during professional games) who makes it into a minor-league team just because he is capable of shrugging off enormous amounts of physical violence while still tromping the other guy into the ice. The goon in question is a soft-spoken, goodhearted, not-too-bright guy named Doug (perfectly played by Seann William Scott) who is happy to have found his calling in life, even if that calling involves separating strangers from their teeth.

We loved this film. And didn't expect to, even with the ""Superbad"" producers pedigree, etc etc. But it's a pretty funny movie, crass but not too crass, comedic but not a farce or a grossout film. Major kudos to writers Evan Goldberg and Jay Baruche: the plot elements are well balanced -- the violence is central to the story, but doesn't define the film. It's neither too gory nor too slapstick. Likewise, the character development draws you in, but never gets sappy. Like Doug's character, the film exists mostly on the surface, but has enough depth to feel believable and draw you in... Great modern comedy for hockey fanatics and non-fans alike. Recommended! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1338336000,3,1398,5.497674418604651
5071350,4,B0079ZWUNY,"This film one-ups the relentless verbal crudity, testosterone-fueled raunchiness, and bone-crunching violence of the legendary ice hockey movie ""Slap Shot,"" combining it with the dry wit and doltish characters you may know from SCTV's ""Great White North"" sketches. Based on a memoir by hockey pro Doug Smith, it mixes in broad jokes about beer, women, Russians, and Qubcois to make something quintessentially Canadian, yet it's also accessible to those of us who did not grow up with Molson running through our veins and visions of the Stanley Cup haunting our dreams.

""Goon"" features an excellent cast of Canadians led by the winning Seann William Scott, perhaps best known for his role as Steve Stifler in the ""American Pie"" films. Scott plays bouncer Doug Glatt, a sweet-natured, dim-witted man-child who just happens to be very good at beating the crap out of people. After a fracas at a hockey game leads a local team to hire him, his thuggish efficiency on the ice gets him promoted to a minor-league club, the Halifax Highlanders. Coach Ronnie Hortense (Kim Coates) assigns him the task of protecting the team's high-scorer, Xavier Laflamme (Marc-Andre Grondin), a former prodigy now less interested in hockey than he is in cocaine and strippers.

Eugene Levy (also in ""American Pie"") is Doug's father, a doctor ashamed of his son's job as a hockey enforcer; Jay Baruchel (one of the screenwriters) is Doug's friend Pat, a rabid fan who hosts an amateurish cable program devoted to the sport; Alison Pill (Baruchel's real-life fiance) is Doug's crush Eva, a ""puck bunny"" with a thing for hockey players; and Liev Shreiber (the only major star in the film) is renowned enforcer Ross ""The Boss"" Rhea, who becomes Doug's nemesis in the arena.

Since it's a comedy, ""Goon"" gives us a happy-if-cockeyed ending in which Doug gets the girl and his underdog team wins redemption in the final showdown. But that's not really the point: this is an over-the-top love letter to the rough-and-tumble culture of hockey and of Canada itself, as well as an excuse for boys being boys, with all of the idiotic insanity, drunken profanity, and bloody brutality that involves.

5071360,2,B0079ZWUNY,"No matter the sport, every team has a ""goon"" sitting somewhere on the bench. A guy like Bill Laimbeer springs to mind in the NBA, or if one was unfortunate enough to play in the NFL back in the 1970s they might catch a broken neck on a late hit from Jack Tatum. These are skilled players who often put their talents and personal glory aside to do whatever was necessary for the team. In hockey, these players are held in especially high esteem and are considered fearsome warriors on the ice. In a sport that relishes the pier six brawl more than the rare hat trick, the goon is like hockey royalty.

That reverence for the sport and its bloody violence is at the heart of Goon, a new hockey comedy starring Seann William Scott as Doug Glatt, yet another in a long line of moronic characters with a heart that shines like the Stanley Cup. A  slow-witted bouncer at a Boston bar, Doug communicates best with his fists, a fact which disappoints his high class parents embarrassed by their son's profession. He lives in a world where hockey is the only thing that matters, exemplified by his pesky, motor-mouthed buddy, Pat(co-writer Jay Baruchel), who hosts a vulgar sports talk show out of his basement. After Pat berates a visiting player into jumping the stands during a game, Doug literally bashes the guy's teeth out, earning himself a try out for the local squad.

The problem is that Doug isn't really a player. He can't skate and certainly can't shoot. All he does his beat people up, but he does it well enough to get passed to the semi-pro squad in Halifax, where he's brought in to protect a Gretzky-esque pretty boy who doesn't like getting hit. The big leagues get him in all types of trouble, falling for a promiscuous hockey groupie(Alison Pill) and riling up Ross ""The Boss"" Shea(Liev Schreiber), an ex-NHL goon on the downside of his career.

While the story focuses primarily on Doug's brutal exploits, relishing the blood and broken teeth of his victims in operatic slo-motion, it's Shea's story that is the most interesting. Schreiber is fantastic as the aging fighter, who has been demoted to the minors after one too many assaults and deteriorating ability. He sees in Doug one last chance to prove he's still the toughest man in the sport, while also recognizing that being pidgeon-holed as a goon has not only stunted his career, but also those of guys like Doug. A man-to-man chat they have on the eve of their inevitable showdown is the highlight of the film. This should have been the story of Shea's career, with Doug completely out of the equation.

Baruchel and Evan Goldberg's script is wildly off balance like a left winger who has taken one too many pucks to the head. They clearly expect us to root for Doug, but he's such a blank slate that it's hard to find any reason to like him. Merely grinning like a dufus and mumbling non-sequitors isn't enough. Only Shreiber brings real gravitas, with his handlebar mustache and bad ass samurai mystique. Michael Dowse's direction excels during the fast paced game sequences, which are so brutal they might make even the most die hard fan quake in their skates.

The plan for every hockey film is to achieve the sort of legendary status as 1977's Slap Shot, which featured Paul Newman in one of his most enduring roles. With only sporadic humor and a hero that's hard to cheer on, Goon's shot sails wide of the net.",1335139200,3,3390,4.622923588039867

5071371,4,B0079ZWUNY,"Professional hockey like most pay-for-play sports has a ""minor"" league system where the athletes are developed for the ""big"" leagues.  In a Massachusetts town a team, several rungs below the NHL, struggles to draw a crowd.  Most of those that do attend do it for the fights not the skill of the skaters.  Doug Glatt (Seann William Scott) is a bouncer at a local bar.  He and his best friend Pat (Jay Baruchel who also wrote and produced) decide to head to the rink.  Pat is one of those loud fans who shout insults at the other team.  When one of the players takes umbrage, he comes into the stands to confront Pat.  Doug heads him off and beats him to a pulp, even cracking his helmet with a head butt.  This gets the attention of the home team coach who recruits him solely for his fighting skills.  One problem.  Doug can't skate worth a nickel.

With some one-on-one instruction, Doug gets promoted to a team and league just short of the NHL.  He can skate a little better but his primary mission is to protect the star player (Marc-Andre Grondin).  He is coming back from a severe beating administered while in the NHL and is not being very successful at it.  The administrator of that beating is a thug enforcer (a very good Liev Schreiber) who is also coming back after a long suspension in what would be his final season.  Rhea (Schreiber) has been an idol of Doug for years so we know we're headed for a showdown.

Before we get there, Doug falls for a Halifax local played by Alison Pill. This leads to some shy and funny fumbling at the dating scene complicated by the fact that Eva (Pill) already has a boyfriend, a red flag for Doug.  Doug by his own admission isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer but is proud of what appears to be a career of sorts.  His family isn't so happy however.  His father (Eugene Levy) and his gay brother are both medical doctors.  In a reunion before a big game at a restaurant, their disappointment is heartbreaking.

Certainly it is refreshing to see Scott and Levy successfully impart great emotion much different from their usual comedic characters.  The big surprise is the range that Scott conveys in this film.  Best known for his ""American Pie"" character, he delivers his best performance as this lovable dim-bulb.  The film ends fittingly with the battle of the goons and doesn't disappoint.  This is a really nice film, filled with humor, violence, blood, viciousness, warmth and lots of naughty language.  Check it out.",1333152000,,2475,4.568181818181818

When him and his friend Ryan (Baruchel) go to a local hockey game to relax Doug gets into a fight with a player. After the coach sees the fight he signs Doug to the team. He has now found a purpose in life...a hockey goon. I have to admit that I am a huge hockey fan. Growing up in Detroit and having half my family from Montreal you could say it's in my blood. I really liked the movie ""Slap Shot"" but until now there has never really been a great hockey comedy. This ranks up with ""Major League"" in terms of great sports comedies. Not only does this movie have great quotable lines and great fight scenes it also has heart. I don't know if it was the hockey fan in me but I really liked this movie and laughed all the way through, plus it's a true story which makes it that much better. Overall, if you liked ""Slap Shot"" you will love this movie. To me it's an instant classic sports comedy. Very funny. I give it a B+",1332374400,9,1090,4.14622641509434

5071377,5,B0079ZWUNY,"For all those that complain about the foul language I would like to remind viewers that this movie is rated R and, last time I checked, foul language is perfectly ok with this rating.  This isn't The Mighty Ducks.  Sean's character is tough to grasp at first since he lacks most of the wit from previous movies and plays more of a dummy, but he nails it and it totally works.  Yeah, most of the story is thrown together in kind of a fantasy manner, but that is what I expect from a movie like this.  What hockey fan wouldn't like the concept of being recruited to a hockey team from the stands?  I think the violence is spot on with the game and illustrates what it takes to be an enforcer.  Missing teeth, cuts, blood, and bruises are what goons look like. I like how the movie kept an upbeat tone and totally avoided the ""poor me"" aspect that could have been easily adopted.  This movie has a lot of heart and soul and just the right amount of laughs to make it all around enjoyable.  I really like Liev Schrieber's role as the old man but totally dislike the Barry Melrose hairdo he has.  It's a stretch from Sabertooth, but still a good tough guy role.

  I recommend this to anybody.",1331856000,2,1188,4.278026905829597
5071378,3,B0079ZWUNY,"My bias...

Loves: Hockey
Likes: Seann William Scott
Dislikes: Jay Baruchel
Hates: Unfunny writing

Goon is about a nice guy who becomes an enforcer on a minor league hockey team.  It stars Seann William Scott as Doug 'The Thug' Glatt, a bouncer who is discovered after he beats the crud out of a visiting hockey player in the stands after he goes after Doug's very annoying friend.  Liev Schreiber shows up as Ross Rhea, an aging, yes still fearsome rival enforcer.

This movie was a mixed bag for me.  Seann William Scott's character really seemed borderline retarded, but I did like his comedic presence.  Jay Baruchel (who co-wrote the movie) was just plain annoying and unfunny.  It's like he was trying to riff with words like he was with the cast of Knocked Up, but no one was playing with him.  The comedy from other people in the movie was basically non-existant and a shoddy 'love' story gets tacked on for Doug Glatt - a storyline that feels unbelievable and forced.  The violence in the movie is intense, and the hockey action is satisfying.

I liked Goon, but I would probably never see this movie again.

5071389,2,B0079ZWUNY,"I assume every Canadian knows the age-old joke by now: ""I went to a fight the other night, and a hockey game broke out."" I, myself, am not a fan of hockey, so I guess it's my own fault for going into movie thinking I'd like it, but I'll admit a Canadian film with Scott and Schreiber in it had me sold. I even paid the extra $8 to experience the most nauseating D-Box experience of my life. Ouch.

Goon is supposedly based on a true story of a fighter who was trained to skate and be a hockey player, and was famous for sucking at hockey but beating the snot out of his opponents. Except, just replace the word ""fighter"" with ""bouncer"", and you have the 95 minute exercise in idiocy that is Goon, a comedy so depressingly boring. it's essentially Moneyball with tons of blood and gore, and without the classy charm.

The first 20 minutes of the movie were gloriously entertaining. The opening fight scene on ice and the bloody tooth falling on the ice. That was brilliant. When we're introduced to the Main character is where the film starts getting slightly weak, however. So, you're telling me this guy is all adorkable and awkward, yet he has no problem beating people to a bloody pulp? Well, even then I was enjoying the film.

However, when we meet his love interest, the film falls flat on his face. People considered the relationship between the hobo and the hooker in Hobo With A Shotgun to be unbelievable, but this makes it look like a tabloid story. In fact, the love aspect reminded me of Twilight at times (take a wild guess as to whether or not that's a compliment). Then we get cliched ""gets the girl"" ending? Frack right off. I've dropped turds more believable than that.

Ultimately, the protagonist is just boring. He's given very few funny lines to work with, he has little to no personality whatsoever, and we're supposed to love him based on mere fighting skills alone. The most interesting character, Liev Schreiber's is only in it for five minutes. And the fight at the end isn't even redeeming at all either.

But the worst problem with the film? It's BORING. the first 20 minutes are the funniest (not a good sign), the villain is interesting yet boring, the film doesn't use fight content to its full potential, there's no restraint at all whatsoever in the film... It's all just one big mess.

If you like being beat over the head with BS, I guess see Goon, but for the rest of us, Goon is a disposable comedy to stock video store shelves with, and a huge disappointment considering the potential it all had.",1330560000,3,2535,4.5
