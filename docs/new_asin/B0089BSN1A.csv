5140878,2,B0089BSN1A,it says 690 mins for the dvd but is only 1 1/2hrs long. Should say 690 mins if you by all the superstar collection dvds. Overall the 4 matches were pretty bad. Could of saved $5 towards the Evolution of a predator dvd,1384646400,,217,4.069767441860465
5140879,4,B0089BSN1A,"This DVD (and all in the ""Superstar Collection"") is a short collection of matches at a budget price. My kids got a few of them for Christmas and couldn't be happier!",1376956800,2,165,4.354838709677419
5140880,5,B0089BSN1A,"I love Randy Orton. He's one of the brightest stars in WWE today. He's talented and handsome. The only thing is, it was a bit too short for me. But I'm always looking for more of the Viper. So a couple more matches would have been better. But all in all, I liked it. If you're a die hard fan of WWE or Randy Orton. I recommend it.",1362787200,2,330,3.8676470588235294
5140881,4,B0089BSN1A,"WWE Championship/3 Stages Of Hell Match (Regular, Falls Count Anywhere, Stretcher) vs. Triple H - Don't let the match ""stipulation"" fool you as this was really just a stretcher match as the first two falls went by really quick & could have been left out because that ended up hurting this match more than helping in the end. This was your typical Triple H/Orton brawl as it went in the ring, through the crowd, and made it's way onto the stage with a few nice spots with the stretcher with a nice story of Orton focusing on Triple H's bad leg throughout the match. Overall, just like how their WrestleMania match wasn't a bad match but it wasn't at the level you would & should expect for a WrestleMania main event...this was a good stretcher match but a horrible 2 Out Of 3 falls/3 Stages Of Hell match which was the match advertised.
The Bash 09
[Blu-Ray Edition Of Randy Orton: Evolution Of A Predator]

WWE Championship Match vs. John Cena vs. Triple H - The rematch from WrestleMania 24. This has a funny beginning as it was clear that Randy Orton was the guy with the target on him from both Cena & Triple H and Orton tried to separate himself from them but they both went right after him. This built up & got better over time with good multiman interaction before it erupted into what Michael Cole described best, ""Chaos!"" While what happened towards the end with all three men & the referee looked confusing, it's something we've seen around 8 years ago but a nice twist along with an RKO that took out two people at once, this was a good match. Although I enjoyed the WrestleMania match more, this wasn't a disappointment.
Night of Champions 09
[Best PPV Matches Of 2009-2010]

vs. Ted DiBiase - One week earlier, Dibiase eliminated Orton from the Elimination Chamber effectively ending the group of Legacy leading to this match. Dibiase kept working over Orton in the corners with punches & kicks including one directly to the face when Orton was on the floor while also outsmarting Orton in one case that resulted in an impactful clothesline before Orton started to build some momentum leading to the interference of the other Legacy member in Cody Rhodes. This was just here continue the eventual showdown between all 3 Legacy members at the upcoming WrestleMania but more of a showcase for Dibiase as he was on the offense for a majority of this match.
""RAW"" Mar. 10

World Championship Match vs. Christian - Orton came into this match looking for revenge for his concussion and pounded on Christian right away with punches & even a big boot to the face while trying to end the match early with various close near falls. Christian focused on Orton's head with various stomps & calculated punches while tossing his head into the steps & also doing his moves with more impact like the spinebuster that had Orton's head bounce off the mat. Orton kept fighting back with shoulderblocks & suplexes but at one point delivered a superplex that even hurt Orton as his head bounced off the mat. There was a good series of counters & reversals towards the end as both men knew each others signature moves so well leading towards the end of the match (which was controversial) before Orton gave Christian a taste of his own medicine afterwords. This was a very good match but wasn't the quality of their previous two encounters as they played it safe here knowing how Orton, in reality, was recovering from a concussion.
Capitol Punishment 11
[Blu-Ray Edition Of Best PPV Matches Of 2011]

This release has some positives in that some of the 2009 matches that were left off his first DVD set saw their way here but the other half of the DVD is really lacking quality as the Ted Dibiase match was filler & a better choice here would have just been the WrestleMania 3 way while the Christian match was the weakest out of all their encounters due to Orton recovering from a real concussion & the cage match from SmackDown or their SummerSlam encounter would have been a better choice from the Christian feud. Other better choices could have the Last Man Standing Matches vs. either C.M. Punk (E. Rules 11) or Triple H (No Mercy 07), matches vs. Cena from either Hell In The Cell or SummerSlam 09, ect. In the end, I would only recommend this collection if your willing to spare the low price as they didn't pick the best collection of matches for Orton that wasn't already released on his previous set.",1343520000,5,4401,4.602547770700637
