8118903,5,B000F8IINI,"We bought this 30 minutes animated movie to introduce our daughters age 4 and 5 to the story of Esther.  The 2D animation is well done (directed by a former Disney manager), with nice Persian empire backgrounds, and the story stays true to the biblical account, leaving our the violence (killings of Haman and his family) and focusing on themes of faith, prayer and being tactful.  Now my daughters know Esther was a hero for her people and why.",1179878400,3,445,4.620253164556962
