7852732,4,6303632432,"Marilyn and Bobby, 1993 film

It begins with a Senate Hearing where a Teamsters Union official is being questioned. Later Mr. Harper talks to a man who doesnt do hits anymore. The FBI has a complete file on Harper. J. Edgar Hoover says organized crime does not exist (else somebody isn't doing his job). Marilyn meets Bobby and talks. Elsewhere a man meets a man with a rifle to talk about a murder; it won't need a rifle. There is a party at a house. Marilyn relaxes in her bath tub, a friend brings her a drug. Hes here says her friend. Marilyn meets Bobby and shows him her house. Outside two men watch. Bobby talks about reading briefing papers, Marilyn talks about a script. Method acting is described, and her past. Then they leave the party.

Two men watch them, then follow their car. [Did Bobby lack security men?] One man gets punched in the face. Bobby and Marilyn talk. J. Edgar Hoover gets reports on the relationship. He compares her to a grenade. Bobby plans to get Hoffa before Grand Juries around the country. Marilyn stays home from work. Bobby tells of the appeal of Marilyn. Hoffa has private detectives who take pictures, but they're not good enough. Marilyn calls Bobby, they plan a meeting. They talk of their pasts. Marilyn was in orphanages, Bobby was sent to boarding schools. Two men watch them. Hoffa is warned by a mob boss (they have an understanding with the brothers). There is a birthday party for Jack, Marilyn sings a song.

Men know Marilyn keeps a diary with details of her relationship with Bobby. If Marilyn died suddenly and her diary was exposed it would finish Bobby. [Did they miscalculate?] Marilyn had taken too many sick days, her movie is behind schedule. She is fired, she is too costly for the movie studio. Marilyn boasts of friends in the government, but this doesnt work. Bobby is told, and promises to help. Hoover shows Bobby pictures of him and Marilyn, There are tape recordings too, the voices are recognizable. The President tells Bobby what to do - put an end to it. Marilyn dreams of marrying Bobby! [Is she out of touch with reality?] Bobby tells Marilyn of the surveillance; it cant be fixed. Hoffa has men watching them, its blackmail.

Marilyn threatens to reveal the facts of their relationship! Later she cant sleep, she finds a bottle of pills! She calls Peter Lawford to say goodbye to everyone. Bobby wants Marilyns diary. Her phone is tapped, the listeners heard it all! Let it go the listener is told. Two men arrive, one gets her diary. Then two other men arrive, they call for an ambulance, then search for a diary. Hoover gets a telephone call in bed. The ambulance takes Marilyn away, but officials tell them to bring her back! What can they do? Its over for her. [Some said her death was a murder designed to look like an accident.] Who really knows the truth, and can they ever tell what really happened?

This is an interesting Hollywood history of the last years of Marilyn, who died on August 4, 1962. How much of this was true or just exaggerated? The truth is that her personal life was censored by the Corporate Media. What would have happened if the truth were known at the time? Has the Corporate Media done a better job since the Watergate Scandal of June 1972? There is less censorship, but people seem less concerned about the personal morals of politicians. Are we better or worse off than from fifty years ago?",1470268800,2,3400,4.594728171334432
7852733,2,6303632432,Slow. Not that interesting. And the woman playing her doesn't look like Marilyn at all. Very disappointing.,1452729600,,107,5.352941176470588
