Tiger Trouble is about a mother Tiger named Seta, who raises 3 cubs on her own until they are old enough to fend for themselves.

Cheetah Twins in Trouble is the next movie; it is about following two Cheetah cubs through trial and tribulations. This is by far the worst video transfer of the three movies. Sometimes it's acceptable, and most of the time it's blurry. This documentary was not that interesting to me because of the poor video transfer, and because Cheetah's are only interesting for their speed.

Impalas is the next movie, and it is about Impalas staying one step ahead of Leopards and Hyena's. Some of the scenes are gory, and once again it has the standard definition DVD look. It is interesting to watch and learn about the Impala survival strategies though.",1363996800,2,946,4.7272727272727275
8473386,5,B005HP2J7K,"If it's about tigers I will probably watch it.  This documentary was no different.  As mentioned in other reviews my hubby and I love watching documentaries about predators, so we both enjoyed watching this one.  My only hope is that this majestic big cat will not go extinct, as it would be a shame that the only way one might see them would be in zoos, rescue facilities, or documentaries.",1353628800,,391,4.557142857142857

8473388,4,B005HP2J7K,"First off, I am a big tiger fan. I have most (if not all) documentaries made about tigers.  This DVD contains 3 episodes. I did't watch all of them since the first one is the only episode that talks about tigers.

The documentary documents the life of 3 cubs, their mom and dad. The male cub is the cutest and most adorable tiger in this vidoe. It shows how the mom struggles to provide food and protection for her family and once they got used to it. They got lazy which forces their mom to leave them so they can make it on their own.

I like this documentary. The reason why I gave it 4 stars is that I expected 144 mins about tigers and it turned out to be divided on 3 episodes for different animals.",1322265600,,705,4.094202898550725
