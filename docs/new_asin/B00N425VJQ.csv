8676124,3,B00N425VJQ,"Funny. The ending was abrupt.  You kind of wanted a bit more.
It is what it is.  Did not come in expected it to be as entertaining as it was.
Surprised me in a good way.",1528848000,,169,3.6666666666666665
8676125,4,B00N425VJQ,I met the director and a cast member at texas frightmare weekend. Just from talking with them I bought this movie. It's not for everybody but you can tell the the director loves to make movies. The female lead in this movie is great. I would describe this as a David Cronenberg movie directed by John Waters. Hopefully that gives you some idea,1527292800,,343,4.4603174603174605
8676126,5,B00N425VJQ,This was the first indie film I've ever seen. There were spots in the movie I laughed my ass off. It's also my first Joe Grisaffi movie but it won't be my last. I plan to watch more of these!,1523404800,,191,3.8
8676127,4,B00N425VJQ,"The ultimate B-Grad flic, that starts out as a comedy with a creamy ethics 101 center, quickly moving to absurdist butcher shop horror. A prime candidate for cult status.",1515974400,,170,4.896551724137931
8676128,5,B00N425VJQ,I saw Conjoined at a special screening at a local movie theater in Houston. I thought it was laugh out loud funny. The crowd was really into it as well. I was kind of embarrassed that I liked it so much.,1512000000,,203,3.975609756097561
8676129,5,B00N425VJQ,This is a fun movie that isn't afraid of what it is a cheesy horror flick. My friends and I got a lot of laughs when we watched it.,1510444800,,131,3.5517241379310347
8676130,4,B00N425VJQ,"This movie is obviously super low budget, and it's one of the best horror comedy movies I've ever seen. The idea is incredibly original and I loved every moment of this film.",1510444800,,174,4.46875
8676131,1,B00N425VJQ,its is quite a low budget movie!,1509235200,,32,3.7142857142857144
8676132,5,B00N425VJQ,"You can't just view Conjoined once.  Twisted, funny, horrific, unbelievable!  Sure to become a cult classic.  if it were rated I believe it would be an R for sexual content, gore, language.  You'll want to watch it again, because your mind can't grasp what just happened the first time!  Where does Joe Grisaffi come up with this stuff?!",1448928000,,337,4.741379310344827
8676133,5,B00N425VJQ,"So bad, it's GREAT!  A real homage to the likes of John Waters' and Troma movies and bad 80's porn.  Ludicrous and absurd, this farce is sure to please any connoisseur of truly awful cinema!",1427068800,,190,4.4
