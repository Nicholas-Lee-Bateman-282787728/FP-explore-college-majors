3175538,4,B0017UOU62,"This exercise video slowly builds to a moderate intensity workout with a strong emphasis on correct movement and form.  The video is very instructional in nature, Moreno is an excellent instructor, and the outdoor setting is beautiful.  Each routine is taught one move at a time, and each move is then added to the prior moves to build a fun and challenging combination of moves.  My only complaint is that the intensity of the workout is only moderate.  While the moves are challenging and fun to learn, I fear that after 3 or 4 veiwings, the video won't have much to offer.  This video is good for low intensity/rest days.  I would appreciate a follow up video which utilizes the moves taught here in an intense cadio workout.  I am a fit 45 year old male.  I exercise aerobically 4-6 times per week.",1291334400,3,802,4.559440559440559
3175539,4,B0017UOU62,Moreno is a great fitness instructor. I love her and working out w/her. Good DVD to own.,1271635200,,88,4.235294117647059
3175540,4,B0017UOU62,"I actually own the ""Kickbox Yoga Fusion"" version of this DVD.  I was a total newbie to kickboxing, and I've found this DVD to be really helpful in getting to know some kickboxing moves. Patricia Moreno is an encouraging teacher, and she makes the routine easy to follow.  The emphasis is really on form though, so I think anyone who's very familiar with kickboxing isn't likely to benefit much from the DVD.  I definitely work up a sweat doing it, but I'd have to get myself a heart rate monitor to see if it's really a high-calorie burn.

One warning - do not do the ""express workout"" without warming up beforehand and stretching afterwards.  You'll definitely end up sore! The longer workout has the yoga stretching moves built into it, and I've never had a problem after doing that one.",1268092800,,789,4.607142857142857

3175542,2,B0017UOU62,"I had studied martial arts for many years but unfortunately let myself go physically for the last 3 years.  Recently I decided to get back in shape, so I tried this DVD.  Believe me I am really out of shape, but this workout did nothing for me except causing knee pain.  No cardio, no burn.  I'll stick to Tae Bo for now.",1239148800,7,321,4.129032258064516
3175543,2,B0017UOU62,"This is not for someone who is brand-new to kickboxing. She shows a move once then adds on moves and speeds it up and it is too hard to keep up. Also the camera is focused on the exercisers' faces too often and not enough on their feet so it is hard to know how the foot work is supposed to go. I must not have done it right because even though she kept saying ""you should feel it in your abs"" I didn't feel a thing. That is the area I need to work on the most. Also be warned the express workout has no warm-up. I don't know about a cool down since I didn't get that far. You should do your own warm up and stretching before and after. I didn't, and the next day I had a lot of pain and soreness in my hips, legs and knees (my left knee still hurts). Be careful.",1229644800,6,763,3.8050314465408803
3175544,3,B0017UOU62,"I have never done any workouts by Patricia Moreno before this one.  I think the title is misleading.  I was expecting a high energy calorie-burning workout.  You do get a burn, but it is from the slow, precise execution of the moves, not because you get a good cardio workout.  I'm an intermediate exerciser.  I would recommend this for beginners who are just learning how to kickbox.  The moves are done slow and really teach you good form.  However, I'm only giving three stars.  I'm removing one star because I think the name is misleading, and another star because there is no warm up or cool down.  Now the person who designed this workout could argue that the moves are slow enough that they are the warm up and cool down, but I think it is a bad habit to get people into thinking they don't need to stretch.  If I had previewed this video, I probably would not have bought it.  To make use of it I'll probably do the video occasionally on light days or in combination with harder workouts.",1228953600,20,996,4.417582417582418

8267330,5,B0017UOU62,This is a great workout DVD.  Patricia Moreno is my favorite instructor so far.  She isn't your typical annoying bubbly instructor that does the same moves as everyone else.  She makes you feel strong and inspired and has a different approach to working out with her kickboxing moves.  I own two of her other DVDs and love them as well.  She is amazing!,1482969600,,353,4.5396825396825395

8267334,4,B0017UOU62,"Most workout videos are extremely patronizing.  When they speak, they think they are motivating you, but instead they address you as if you were an idiot, a child, or both.  It's insulting and patronizing, silly and fake.

Patricia has a way of speaking and presenting herself that she comes across confident, serious, yet motivating.  She let's you know and makes you feel like you came here to work, and that it's going to take some time, but that you will make it.  Sheputs you at ease but asks of you to put in the work.  The backgrounds a soothing, the music challenging and focus instead of loud and distracting.  In short: she speaks to you, not shouts at you.

This is a low-intensity workout.  Her marketers (greedy and deceiving as marketers usually are) advertise this product as any other workout series is advertised: hard, complete, challenging, promising the world and olympic results.  The truth is that this is an alternative (or at the very least, different) workout; it's easy, low impact, although you can mnake it harder by doing the moves bigger, faster, and harder.  Just don't expect a complicated workout.  This is for beginners or for people very out of shape.  I just wish they would advertise it as such, since I believe there is an untapped market of out-of-shape people that are intimidated by workout products they feel are too advanced or out-of-reach for them, and this would be a great alternative for them.  I also wish there were more advanced workouts that would implement Patricia's approach: not patronizing, not condescending, but genuine, confident, focused, challenging, and still entertaining.",1363392000,9,1636,4.988929889298893

8267336,3,B0017UOU62,I loved this workout.  However the camera man did not do a service by often times just focusing in on Patricia's face.  The steps can be intense at times and I would rather have had a full body focus more throughout the work out.  Patricia herself did a great job.,1310342400,,264,4.24
