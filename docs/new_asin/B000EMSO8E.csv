For the price,  this DVD offers very little. There is nothing here you that can not be obtained free somewhere else.",1339372800,,260,4.531914893617022
2523659,4,B000EMSO8E,"This DVD is great for both coaches and players who want to learn basic skills in lacrosse.  I have two sons ages 8 and 9, and we have watched this video multiple times together.  I also plan on using many of the drills in my practices.  U11 lacrosse is all about teaching skills and fundamentals.  This DVD really helps in that regard.  I highly recommend it.

2523660,4,B000EMSO8E,"As a rookie assistant lacrosse coach, I found this DVD extremely helpful in teaching some of the basic skills and techniques for young lax players.  The sample drills were perfect for players of all levels.",1175731200,,206,4.885714285714286
2523661,5,B000EMSO8E,"As a youth sport administrator, training coaches on how to teach proper fundamentals is essential.  This video is an excellent introduction for first time coaches that may be hesitant to coach a sport that they have never played. I would recommend it to any parent, coach or player that wants to learn more about lacrosse.",1175040000,,322,4.8545454545454545
2523662,5,B000EMSO8E,"As a dad trying to play catch-up with my son's love of lacrosse, I have watched (endured) a lot of videos on the subject.  Winning Lacrosse is by far the most informative and most watchable of the bunch.  It breaks down all of the basic skills really well, and then gives drills you can run to practice what you've learned.  The coach really knows his stuff and communicates in a way that is as clear to me as it is to my son.",1142812800,14,426,4.108433734939759

8111488,5,B000EMSO8E,Very useful. Even if you are working on learning to play lacrosse for a women's team these skills and drills are essential for being able to play well. You learn the basics you need and this makes it easy to practice them and get them down pat.,1432857600,,244,4.212765957446808

8111492,5,B000EMSO8E,"LAX is a fast growing game and many novice coaches find themselves in position to teach young players without a great deal of playing experience. Jeff's videos can help. I have played, refereed and now coached youth lacrosse.  I find Jeff's videos invaluable. This is an excellent DVD, as are all of Jeff's, and an effective coaching tool for the experienced as well as the inexperienced youth LAX coach. Jeff teaches proper techniques in a serious but patient approach all youth coaches could benefit from imitating. He lays down the foundation for skills development by first demonstrating the proper technique and then offers drills to build skill development.  There are subtle suggestions on how to right bad habits, such as stopping the stick in mid flight during passing and how to develop the correct skills to build muscle memory. Jeff's DVDs build upon each other and advantage the skills he teaches.  Highly recommended.",1392076800,3,931,5.071895424836601
8111493,2,B000EMSO8E,"When I received this DVD (apparently a clearinghouse from a library),  I was disappointed because I actually coach girls lacrosse and not boys.  There is a version of this same DVD for both girls and boys and I feel confident I selected the ""girls"" version.  Anyway, there is still some useful material, but not really what I was hoping for and I am not certain it was my fault.",1376352000,,378,4.449275362318841
8111494,5,B000EMSO8E,"He loves the game and though he is just starting to play competitively, he obviously learned a lot from the video.  The coach is easy to understand and leads you through the drills in a logical manner.",1357171200,,201,4.4324324324324325
