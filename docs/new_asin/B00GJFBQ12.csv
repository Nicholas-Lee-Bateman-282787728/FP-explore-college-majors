6078455,3,B00GJFBQ12,"The premise reminds me of that GHOSTBUSTERS quote, the one about cats and dogs living together... Not too long from now, vampires - or vampyres - will emerge from the shadows to share uneasy co-existence with a steadily dwindling human population. The children of the night will settle for subsisting on synthetic blood, although the lure of real human blood will at times prove irresistible. 2012's VAMPYRE NATION is set in Bucharest, Romania (yet filmed in Bulgaria). Right away there's a whiff of ALIEN NATION in terms of touchy species inter-relations and, as well, a reek of any number of plagiarized vampire flicks (BLADE 2, DAYBREAKERS, and the granddaddy of 'em all, DRACULA).

You get what you deserve - yeah, even you stinking vampyres - when you engage in shady back alley transactions. Impurities in black market human blood have triggered a mutation, infecting vampyres with a retrovirus that regresses them to these unthinking killing machines driven by voracious appetites. These mutates are faster and more brutish and nastier than the average vamp. And, oh yeah, they sprout giant bat wings. To eradicate this alarming new threat, a makeshift team is assembled, composed of elegant vampyres and scruffy human vampyre hunters.

2.5 out of 5 stars for this one. I won't lie, much of VAMPYRE NATION is straight-up doodo0, what do you expect from a Syfy production? Shame of it is that, chafing underneath what's lame and what's cheesy, is a solid story dying to get out. I'm thinking the bottom dollar suits at Syfy sensed the potential in this movie and quickly put a stop to that. A good Syfy made-for-television picture is not to be tolerated. Them suits aren't ready for so sweeping a paradigm shift.

If you still end up watching VAMPYRE NATION, be on watch for two things, two positive things. One is that Andrew-Lee Potts is in it and he's switched it up from his normal loveable nerdy roles. In playing hot-headed vampyre hunter John Harker (yes, he's a descendant of THAT guy), Potts discards his native English accent for a pretty convincing Yank one. And so what if his baby face doesn't quite lend itself to the part of badass, loose cannon-type vampyre slayer? Surly and sarcastic, John Harker is enlisted straight from prison by East Coast flatfoot Lt. Derricks (Neil Jackson), him what's ramrodding this sudden task force. Harker promptly goes about getting his old gang of vampyrgia (""vampire hunters"") back together. This includes his incarcerated sister, Celeste (Heida Reed), and his nightclub stripper ex, Katya (Claudia Bassols).

Another reluctant recruit is the haughty, well-dressed vampyre, Nikolai (Ben Lambert), purported progeny of the legendary Vlad Tepes. The instant rancor between Nikolai and Harker provide the film's lighter moments. The caustic banter between Lambert and Potts is the film's other highlight, and not because the actual dialogue is this zippy, witty thing but rather because the two actors make the best of it.

I won't say much about the CGI other than if CGI of this quality were around back in the '50s and '60s, Ray Harryhausen would have snickered all the way to the bank. I had issues with the storytelling structure. The central plot itself follows a linear direction. But I question the haphazard nature and the poor timing in which interpersonal relationships are introduced. One example is when one character, just as heavy sh-- is going down, pauses anyway for a touching discussion with his long-absent wife. Todor Chapkanov, king of miscues and director of this one, asks that you ignore such ill-conceived moments.

Other takeaways:

- Not to suggest that VAMPYRE NATION blatantly rides the coattails of HBO's TRUE BLOOD, but its original title is ""TRUE BLOODTHIRST""
- Oboy, that Scotland yard detective Innes-Bunchley (Jonathan Hargreaves) is really annoying
- Nikolai's complexion can't make up its mind between normal flesh tone and waxy gray
- I'm trying to figure out the tactical advantage of, when you're in a fortified building and besieged by vampyres outside, why you would shoot out empty windows
- Oboy, that vampyre sure ran out into direct sunlight for no good reason
- In direct sunlight, a vampyre is safe under a hoodie and in sunglasses and I guess foreheads are immune
- In the laziest human-to-vamp transition yet, all one has to do is suck from a vampyre's slit wrist, and seconds later, presto whammo... vamp!
- sexy vampyres must ever speak in a posh English accent",1403481600,,4467,5.012129380053908

8623776,5,B00GJFBQ12,"I first saw Vampyre Nation (True Bloodthirst) on TV and was pleasantly surprised to find that I quite liked it.  So when it came out on DVD I just had to buy it.

The simple plot involves a conspiracy (naturally).  With the aid of a synthetic blood substitute, vampires and humans can happily coexist.  But!  Suddenly, something monstrous (and fabulously winged) is killing humans and vampires alike!  Suspicions abound.  It doesnt help that there already exists an uneasy alliance/truce between the two factions.  Worse still, humans are willingly becoming vampires (soon they will be a minority).  But if this new threat isn't neutralized...............DOOM for all and nothing for no one!  Or something like that.  A super team of almost experts is formed to investigate the outbreak, get answers, and supply a remedy of sorts (guns are involved, things get shot).

Its mostly played for laughs (at least I think it was meant to be taken that way).  At any rate, I thought it was a hoot, thanks in large part to baby face Andrew-Lee Potts as Johnny Harker (almost an action hero).

Id say it was a competent production, don't expect magic, it is what it is.",1453766400,,1160,4.822335025380711
8623777,5,B00GJFBQ12,"This movie somehow went under the radar, but I caught a trailer and decided to track it down. The vampires are kind of a bat / human hybrid, and look really cool. It has plenty of action and the story got me from the start. One of the best movies I've seen in a while.",1453248000,,268,3.890909090909091
