8738908,5,B017E99UI2,"Absolutely fantastic! What a treat to see Sherman in his prime with a fantastic band . . . the legendary Robert ""Freightrain"" Parker on bass no less. If you never had the pleasure (or even if you had) of seeing one of Sherman's live shows, this is a sweet substitute. He was a true entertainer in every sense of the word. His ability to captivate the audience was unanimous with all the great Texas blueslingers he talks about in the interviews . . . so thankful to whoever got this DVD out there and I hope Sherman is making some money off it.",1452038400,,544,4.29126213592233
