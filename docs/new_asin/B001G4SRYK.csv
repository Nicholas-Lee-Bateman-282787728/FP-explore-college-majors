I USALLY LOVE GHETTO MOVIES BUT THIS ONE WAS JUST DUMB.  THE STORY LINE WAS WEAK AND THE ACTORS WERE EVEN WEAKER!

8303777,1,B001G4SRYK,"I'm always anxious to see a movie featuring us but I would like to see a movie that doesnt try to mimic Friday and do a piss poor job at it too. The Rim Shop wants to be Friday so bad and cant even rise up to the level of Friday After Next. This low budget fiasco is a joke and a very unfunny one at that.

Plot: Joe Joe has just opened up his very own rim shop and things are going well until an evil loan shark comes to collect an old debt. With no money in the bank Joe Joe has 24 hours to come up with the cash or he loses everything. Looking for a little cash themselves Joe Joe's half-wit friends steal a million dollar gold coin; unfortunately they only think it is worth a couple of bucks. Will Joe Joe get his hands on the extremely valuable coin before his friends sell it to the highest bidder?

That's what they say that the movie is but the movie seems to be about Black people acting really stupid. So many things are going on this movie and none of the subplots connect leaving giant holes in the story. This movie also doesnt know what it wants to be. Does it want to be comedy or a crime drama? It fails at both. The only thing positive about this movie is Maia Campbell. Im pretty sure you're all aware of her being a junkie and have probably seen the footage of her on Youtube looking like a lost relative of Khia(a video that scared me more than any of these modern horror movies). Well, she fixed herself up pretty good and is starting to look like that gorgeous girl you remember from Trippin and the sitcom In The House. She plays Joe Joe's ex-girlfriend. Other than that the movie sucks. Former No Limit rapper Mr Magic has to be the most unconvincing antagonist since Jack Travis of Lethal Weapon 3. Its not his fault, the fault lies on the pathetic script that cant decide on what it wants to do with its characters.

In closing don't waste a dollar on this low budget minstrel show. Its not funny, its not good its not worth it. If you cant watch a movie like this for free then don't pay to watch it. Its not worth it. 90 minutes of unfunny chittlin circuit tripe and that undercover with the Jheri Curls has to be the ugliest guy alive. Dude looks like a cross between Faizon Love and a boll weevil.",1236729600,,2228,4.152777777777778
