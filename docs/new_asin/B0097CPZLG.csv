8537406,5,B0097CPZLG,"It is so refreshing to see the humor in the Punjabi movies go past crude and demeaning. A movie that you'll be comfortable watching with your mum n dad, as well as kids.
I would put it in the same category as 'Jeeja ji' 'Ji aayan nu'.
Good, clean fun. I can once again feel good about Punjabi movies. This is just the beginning.",1363910400,,328,4.140625
8537407,5,B0097CPZLG,We are big movie fans however we rarely watch punjabi movies because they all suck but this was is HILARIOUS and fun to watch with your entire family.  We got out neighbors together and did a movie/dinner night because this movie so fun to watch with crowd/large audience.  This is my 4yr old son's favorite movies....songs are awesome as well.  Definitely worth a watch.  Never get tired of it. Great job everyone.,1357603200,,415,4.722222222222222
