The movie doesn't hold up too well as the most recent one does but this was the a great attempt at capturing what Captain America meant to us.,1452556800,,257,3.8679245283018866
473463,4,6302447739,"I am reviewing the quality of the Blu-ray. For that it's so much better and perfected compared to anything else. The film is a great B-grade Drive-In flick, it has so many problems, but that is also the beauty of it. It plays out like a very cheesy Comic book. Fun cheesy film. Wonderful Blu-ray transfer.

473496,4,6302447739,"Ok so it's a 90's movie. Yes there is cheese but it's the 90's before CGI and extreme editing. The opening scene must have caught Christopher Nolan's eye because when Cap enters Red Skull's lair, very similar in approach when Batman enters Bane's lair. For it's time I thought it was a good representation for a Marvel. Super Heroes had come a long way from the days of serials. This was a blockbuster compared to those. So be kind to Super Heroes as they evolve, cuz who knows, maybe 30 years from now kids maybe thinking today's movies are camp.",1442793600,,547,4.48

473583,4,6302447739,"Is this a great movie? Well... no. But, if you grew up watching it, or are a fan of B-movies, then I would recommend getting this. Or if you want to see what Marvel was up to before the great movies we have now, it has enjoyment for that. Personally I like it, but recognize that it is not great. Much of the plot is dull filler. Cap does have one fight scene in the WW2 era and an okay final battle with Red Skull. For some reason, they decided to make Red Skull get plastic surgery, so he looks more like jigsaw, and it is pretty lame. But they do show him in true form for the WW2 scenes, so at least he look cool for a bit... So, keep your expectations low and you may enjoy this, if not then move on to the First Avenger!",1423958400,,726,3.9121621621621623

I was pleasantly surprised at first, and then the movie degraded quickly into any made for tv movie of the 70's or 80's. Which is too bad as it was a 90's film. I guess what I am trying to say is I wasn't expecting much, and then it started out great, raising my expectations, then it didn't follow through, leaving me disappointed for getting what I originally expected. If you keep in mind that this is a campy B movie, and don't let that slip from your mind, you'll know what you are getting into.",1420502400,,595,4.182608695652174

great choice for this part and they should have made more with him in the role. The TV movies made before are okay but so badly acted
and miscast and just too hokey and hard to watch. I have them all. I have had this on VHS for years and it was me and my nephews
favorite movie for a long time and I still love it. I have not seen the DVD but I assume it's better than the VHS quality which is still good.

473627,5,6302447739,"Finally released on a full screen 16:9, with a decent image quality and audio, this Blu-ray beats any past version released on DVD.

All over the world this movie was released and re-released on VHS and DVD with a crappy image, 4:3 or cropped and mono audio. This time we can check this story as it deserved to be checked. Marvel obviously wasn't the Marvel we know today talking about cinema, but made an interesting effort to make this movie cool. Was a bit hard to see a super hero movie in the 80's/90's placing the hero correctly/decently thru the decades he lived/World War and the way they portraited it here was really cool.

Natually, First Avenger was a completely better view of Captain's story, but's important for any fan to check how the kids from the 80's/90's saw/wanted our favorite Avenger on this movie.",1410134400,,822,4.662068965517242

That actor did a good job playing the villain. Problem is the story kind of loses it's way after the Captain is brought into the 20th century. It's like, the writers ran out of ideas and it became a grudge match between the Red Skull and Capt. America....

is more true to the original idea than the newest. Of course this movie suffers and is minimalized in status from the largely unknown fact that the production company went broke part way through production and the director decided to commit to finishing as best as he could with what he could get. Kudos to Mr. Pyun for his brave try, when 99% would have jumped ship he commited to his vision. This movie is a seminal work in that it is the forerunner of all of today's slick CGI, high dollar techo-products.

473692,3,6302447739,"First, I haven't read even one total review, but did notice some comments made on the top one concerning the quality of the transfer, using a DVD-R etc)) and want to say those are apparently for the prior DVD version., If you look, that was done in 2011 and the Blu-Ray was released in 2013. So, don't use that as a reason not to buy this. I really wish Amazon would not combine reviews for different versions. Sure, the content is likely the same, but content is not the only thing discussed in product reviews.

I did see a line or two on the Amazon review that said that the Blu Ray transfer showed some of the corners cut due to budget, I agree. On to the movie. I saw this on VHS after renting from Blockbuster shortly after its release and wasn't fond of it. Maybe it was due to higher expectations then,  lower expectations now knowing I wasn't fond of it then, or perhaps a fresh ( but more than 2 decade older set of eyes), but I find some redeeming qualities now.

Matt Salinger does a great job in capturing Cap's innocence and goodness. He looks like a pretty good Captain (although not quite muscular enough), Still, he is very likeable.  I do wish they hadn't had him call the Red Skull the name he did as I think of Captain as not using language like that even in situations like that.

Some people's acting is over the top (Scott Paulin as the Red Skull is the biggest offender here). This, some of the effects and sets,  and some of the disjointed plot (once again likely due to the lack of time and budget in not being able to film scenes in the original script) make parts of this feel like a movie such as a the old martial arts movies. Still Salinger and some others have a lot of heart capturing the time period.

Does this stack up to many other Super Hero Films? No. But it has some merit. At times Salinger reminds me a bit of John Wesley Shipp (who played Flash on TV around this time) and who might have made a good Captain as well. Kim Gillingham does great at treating Sharon and Bernice as two different characters, but the effects on the aging her for the Bernice of the nineties were not up to par as much in my opinion as was used earlier in Back to the Future.

In closing I had to laugh at Steve using the car sick thing the second time. If you have something that works, use it. LOL

473693,3,6302447739,"If you go into this film with the following in mind: 1) it was made with a minimal budget, 2) it was an honest attempt to stay close to the Marvel Comics origin, and 3) you don't try and compare it with the new Captain America: The Original Avenger, I believe you will enjoy the film. It was made in 1990, before Marvel Comics really got into making their own films. Matt Salinger portrays a believable Steve Rogers/Captain America. The storyline is interesting, although I wasn't too keen with them changing the Red Skull into a fascist Italian instead of a Nazi German. If you go into viewing the film expecting to see anything like the recent release, you'll be greatly disappointed. However, if you watch this movie with an open mind and see it as just good fun, I believe you'll enjoy it.",1391644800,,793,4.513888888888889
473694,3,6302447739,"Taking part in a secret super soldier experiment in the 1940s, Steve Rogers becomes the American icon Captain America. After an altercation with the Red Skull, he is trapped in ice for fifty years before being thawed out in 1993. Upon awakening, Steve must come to grips with being a man out of time and also that the Red Skull is still alive and is leader of a powerful crime family. Steve must track down the Red Skull, with each clue giving more insight into his own past and bringing him one step closer to his arch enemy to settle a fight that began half a century before.

This flick is your classic Captain America story, that is, his origin, his World War II beginnings, battling Red Skull, being frozen, awakening in the future and reconnecting with his old enemy who is still active.

I remember seeing this as a kid and liking it. Saw it recently a few years back and still liked it. Its not the greatest superhero movie, but it still holds its own all these years later.

Its very much Steve Rogerss story as hes Captain America for a little bit then isn't for a good while, then is again in terms of him getting into costume. As a kid, you don't care about story and just want to see the superhero. As an adult, you see the big picture so don't mind the non-costumed parts. Its a story about a journey, both for Steve and even for Red Skull as you watch Steve wrestle with himself for being from the past and how everythings changed, and also the different things he finds out as he searches for his enemy.

The Captain America costume is very rubbery, but its way better than the one that appeared in the 1979 movies and looks pretty good overall. The shield rocks and when Captain America throws it, its got that cool swooshing-through-the-air sound effect, adding to its power.

I was totally fine with Matt Salinger as Steve Rogers. He had that all-American sensibility about him, was nave in the right ways, learned in others, and filled out those big red boots nicely.

This is a solid Marvel movie that was made well before the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe of today and should be on the shelves of every superhero movie enthusiast out there.

473695,4,6302447739,For my grandson for Christmas.  He really likes superhero movies.  He is enjoying watching it.  Received on time and in good condition,1388707200,,134,5.0
473696,4,6302447739,"I'm a huge fan of Captain America and had been wanting to see this low budget take on him for quite some time, so I was initially excited when this came to DVD, but unfortunately that DVD was massively underwhelming. The DVD was cropped to a 4:3 aspect ratio (which awkwardly cut people's faces in half during several moments), there was lots of digital compression visible, and the picture was so overly dark that certain parts of the film were incomprehensible.

Fortunately Shout Factory comes to the rescue with this very well done Blu-Ray edition of the film. This Blu-Ray presents the movie in its proper widescreen ratio and the lighting is much better. Overall, this is a nice looking transfer. Being that this is an older film that was shot on a shoestring budget, you wouldn't expect this film to look very good, but the level of detail is surprisingly nice. In particular, establishing shots such as those showing the mountains of Alaska, or the fortress in which the film's climax takes place look stunning, and the increased resolution puts all the scuffs and scratches on Cap's costume on full display. In one shot, you can even see hairs inside the good Captain's nose (such is the magic of Blu-Ray). There are some specks and splotches that pop up, mostly during the earlier parts of the film, but I don't really mind that much, as it lends to the feeling of watching a cheesy, low-budget film.  If I had to level one complaint at this HD presentation, it would be that the darker scenes tend to have much more grain than the rest of the film. Still, these dark scenes fare much better than they did in the DVD version. For instance, there is a scene where Captain America fights against some enemies in a dark basement. On the DVD version, I had no idea what was going on during this scene because the picture was so dark, whereas on the Blu-ray, I can make out the action just fine, as the contrast level is much more appropriate. I would much rather have extra grain and be able to tell what's going on than have less grain, but no clue as to what's happening.

In terms of the movie itself, it's cheesy fun. The sets are very cheap looking (and now look even cheaper thanks to the added resolution of Blu-Ray) and some of the effects are goofy, plus Captain America's suit has fake ears, but this movie has lots of charm. What's surprising is that all of the actors involved actually give very good performances, something that you generally don't see in a ""B-Movie"". Matt Salinger does a great job of portraying the Boy-Scout-honest personality that you would expect from Captain America, and Scott Paulin puts on an enjoyable show hamming it up as the Red Skull. Ronnie Cox makes for a very likeable President, and Ned Beatty (who played Otis in the Superman films) does a good job as the President's best friend. It's interesting to compare this to the Chris Evans Captain America movie, and the sequence of Steve Rogers transforming into Cap plays out almost identically in both (of course, both films are adapting the same material, but still). There's lots of camp value to this film, such as the Red Skull's squad of assassins seemingly being comprised of early 90's fashion models, and Captain America faking sickness to hijack someone's car, but this is a rare B-Movie that actually succeeds at being a decent film underneath the all the cheese.

As for special features, this Blu-Ray only consists of one, but it's a treat. Albert Pyun, the director of the film, and Matt Salinger talk about making the film, and both men are surprisingly open about the movie's shortcomings. They talk about what went right and what went wrong, and their thoughts are well worth hearing for anyone interested in the movie. I really wish there would have been some kind of commentary track, but this behind the scenes feature was good.

Overall, this Blu-ray is a good version of a fun movie. Obviously this isn't on the same level as Captain America: The First Avenger, but if you want some cheesy superhero fun, I recommend this disc.",1388534400,,4049,4.665266106442577

473727,3,6302447739,"It was 1990 and  for many of us who were collecting comic books, the '90s was a decade of the re-emergence of comic book collecting, interest in the superheroes from years past and for many superhero films, before they were the big budget summer blockbusters as they are today, they were independent films.

In 1989, there was ""The Punisher"" and the following year, there was ""Captain America"" (to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Captain America) which was released in several countries outside of the U.S. but in America, it went direct-to-video.

And I can easily remember going to the video store, highly anticipating this film (and also the ""Fantastic Four"" film that came out in 1994) and thinking, it has to be way better than the '70s ""Captain America"" films right?

Well, with the release of ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" in theaters, sure enough, we have ""Captain America"", the 1990 film released on Blu-ray via a Collector's Edition release.

The film is directed by Albert Pyun (""The Sword and the Sorcerer"", ""Cyborg"", ""Kickboxer 4: The Aggressor"") and is written by Stephen Tolkin (who would later become the co-executive producer of ""Brothers & Sisters"", ""Legend of the Seeker"", ""Summerland"") and Lawrence Block.

VIDEO:

Captain America"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1).  In my original DVD review, I wrote about how the video was nothing to write home about because it was a low budget film from the early '90s.  But watching it on Blu-ray, I'm amazed of how much better the Blu-ray looks versus any video version I have seen in the past.  Even the outdoor scenes look a lot better.  Granted, there is that hint of softness but still, the film looks so much better on Blu-ray!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Captain America"" is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0.  Dialogue is crystal clear including the 1990 synth music.  A front-channel driven lossless soundtrack but definitely better than its previously released DVD version.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Captain America"" comes with the following special features:

  Looking Back at Captain America - (20:05) A fascinating interview with Director Albert Pyun and actor Matt Salinger of how budget cuts and a very short schedule made the film different from the Tolkin script.  For Pyun, he wanted to make a Captain America film in the spirit of the comic books but the producers and studio wanted a Clark Kent/Superman style storyline.  Salinger talks about the difficult of wearing the latex suit during the humid hot summer and his thoughts on the film and how much the film deviated from the script due to the small budget and shortened schedule.

JUDGMENT CALL:

In my original review, I wrote that ""Captain America"" is a bad film.  But the fact was that director Albert Pyun was put in a situation where they didn't have any budget to execute any major action scenes and with a shortened schedule and being told that their would be followup shooting after shooting in Yugoslavia...it just didn't happen.  In fact, Pyun was so disappointed that he didn't want to see the final cut of the film after it was all done.  The entertaining script that Stephen Tolkin had originally written was turned to something else by the studio who wanted to emphasize a different Captain America, while Pyun was dedicated to featuring the Steve Rogers/Captain America that he grew up reading in the comic books.

With that being said, if you watch a lot of the older Marvel films, definitely don't watch these with the highest of expectations because they are quite cheesy.

But I'm going to be truthful, during this time, like many other comic book collectors, obtaining these superhero films was not easy.  I can remember friends trying to get this film and the ""Fantastic Four"" film from conventions and they were in the nastiest conditions.  For me, I found a rental copy from a video store and watched it with a few friends.

Yes, it was cheesy and definitely not so faithful to the comic books and while it was a cheesy adaptation, somehow many of us back then wanted these films not so much because they were bad films but because they were superhero films.  A step-up from the old '70s films and of course, it's one thing to say how much this film sucks compared to ""Captain America: The First Avenger"", these films didn't have the greatest budget and the superhero films from Marvel were not in the same position as their rival DC, which was doing well with the big budget Michael Keaton ""Batman"" films.

But at that time, Captain America fans or Marvel fans wanted to grab a copy of these films because we were collectors.

But watching in today, in 2013 and seeing how times have changed where both Marvel and DC are now making the big-budget blockbuster superhero films, these older films... they are no doubt, forgotten films that are now looked at as just slightly better than the '70s films but that's not saying much.  Watching it today, it's just a bad film, bad adaptation, bad music (you have to enjoy how they try to redo popular songs in a different arrangement ala Duran Duran's ""Girls on Film"") but still, I'm sure there are Captain America fans who still want to own a copy of this Blu-ray as their original VHS probably is unwatchable by now.

With this Blu-ray release, there are a few things that Shout! Factory has done that makes this release much better than the 2011 DVD release and it's the fact that the film is presented in 1080p High Definition. Picture quality is so much better than the original DVD and because of many outdoor scenes that the film was shot, colors are so much better and the film doesn't look 1990.  I was surprised by how much better this film looks in HD versus its 2011 DVD counterpart.  So you get the 1080p High Definition and a lossless 2.0 DTS-HD MA soundtrack.

But possibly the biggest addition which I wanted to see in the first DVD release was a special feature with director Albert Pyun and star Matt Salinger and this is where Shout! Factory has delivered.  Not only do you get a cool 20-minute featurette, both men really go into detail of the problems they ran into shooting this film, but both emphasizing how they had only so much they can work with, because of the very small budget and shortened schedule.

And what happened after the film was done and what happened to the shield and the latex suit!  Those questions are answered in this Blu-ray release!

So, while the 2011 DVD should appease fans, this Blu-ray release for 2013 is so much better! And the even better news is that this Blu-ray release is still budget priced at $11.  I

While I can't recommend this film to the masses, especially those who are so used to today's Marvel films, I'm sure there are Marvel/Captain America fans who may have some fondness in their hearts or for memorabilia sake to watch this film all over again and will want this Blu-ray release.  This was how Marvel films were back in the 1990s, they were not the big money making machine summer blockbuster films they are now.

For nostalgic Marvel/Captain America fans, if you enjoyed the film, it is definitely worth upgrading your VHS or DVD version to this 2013 Blu-ray release of ""Captain America: Collector's Edition"".",1372896000,,7204,4.762479871175524

473729,3,6302447739,"A boy is kidnapped and a family slaughtered during the opening credits.  Most of this carnage is done off screen.  The rest of the film carefully follows this same formula: hint, never show.  Seven years later, Captain America is introduced as a failed hero.  For all his gosh-golly pluck and determination, the clod doesn't stand a chance against super villain Red Skull, a yappy red headed fop.  Strapped to a rocket destined for the White House, Captain America manages to make a detour to Alaska instead.  The years roll by.........I wish this movie did as well.  Director Albert Pyun admits this wasn't the movie he set out to make, blaming the results on too much interference, a lousy budget, and a lot of rules from Marvel.  What he wanted to make was a movie about Steve Rogers, who just happened to be Captain America in his spare time.  This is as close as he could get to that vision.  Either way, he was doomed to fail.  Character studies do not make great action flicks.  I could care less that Steve Rogers smoked, was faithful to his honey back home, or wanted to be a guinea pig for the government when he grew up.  It's the suit, the shield, and the adventure that's important.  Nefarious plots to thwart, villains to outwit, people to save, that's what it's all about.  This movie doesn't quite manage to do any of that.  The stunts are limited, the car chases lame, the mob of thugs just preppy dressing clones, and Red Skull has a botched face lift that despoils his moniker.  ""Holy mackerel!""  At the end it even tosses in a commercial of sorts for ecology!  It's not so much where they went wrong as when.........at the very beginning.

473755,3,6302447739,"Before 1998's ""Blade,"" Marvel Comics couldn't seem to catch a break when it came to movie versions of their different properties. In the wake of ""iron Man 3"" and ""The Avengers,"" I know that's very hard to believe. There was a serial for Captain America released in 1944 through Republic Pictures. George Lucas executive produced a live-action adaptation of ""Howard the Duck"" in 1986.

The next few years up to Wesley Snipes' take on the legendary vampire slayer were plagued with low-budget versions of the comic book publisher's characters. Dolph Lundgren's ""The Punisher"" couldn't even muster a theatrical release in the U.S. Roger Corman's ""The Fantastic Four"" never officially saw the light of day anywhere, although bootleg copies float around.

21st Century Film Corporation released ""Captain America"" straight to video in the middle of those two disasters. For many years, the movie was hard to get a hold of and only released on VHS. Shout! Factory released it on DVD and made it widely available to those who sought it out for so many years as a sort of Nerd Holy Grail. Now they've went one step further by giving the 1990 cult classic a high definition upgrade.

Several years after being caught by Red Skull and left for dead, Steve Rogers is found frozen in the ice and thawed out. He discovers Red Skull received plastic surgery to hide his true identity and is heading up a group of world leaders set on kidnapping the President of the United States for their own diabolical ambitions.

Is ""Captain America"" filled with cheese? If you judge it from a modern standpoint, of course it is. If you look at it as being a piece of World War II propaganda filmed in the 1940s, you'll find it totally hits its mark. That's the standpoint I choose to view it from.

My only real issue is that we only get about 5 minutes of face time from the real Red Skull. The rest of the film features actor Scott Paulin in flesh-colored make-up topped with scar lines. It's a real letdown for fans of the Red Skull who wanted to see the character the way he looks in the comic books.

The hi-def video transfer for ""Captain America"" will no doubt leave geeks giggling in glee. There are many out there who have longed for this movie in a suitable home entertainment format since DVDs became the standard. Have no fear, as Shout! Factory delivers the ultimate version with near-perfect picture quality. The 2.0 stereo is adequate and gives the sound effects, dialogue, and musical score ample room to breathe and spread out.

The only bonus material found on the Collector's Edition Blu-ray is a brand new featurette entitled ""Looking Back at 'Captain America' with Director Albert Pyun and Star Matt Salinger."" It's evident that Pyun and Salinger's lofty visions for ""Captain America"" were grounded by very limited finances. Salinger comes across as extremely devoted to bringing the character of Steve Rogers and Captain America to life onscreen. You can tell from the atmosphere and the camerawork that Pyun did everything he could to stretch the dollars he was given. In the end, you can tell they were both disappointed in the outcome.

I still think that ""Captain America"" gets way more flack for being cheesy and low budget than it deserves. Is it on the same quality level as ""Captain America: The First Avenger?"" No way! However, it has an inviting and personal flavor to it that still works 23 years later. Real comic book fans will find value in this adaption and appreciate it for what it is.",1369180800,,3497,4.749588138385502

473757,3,6302447739,"A strong Shout! Factory Blu-Ray of Albert Pyun's comic-book production that was shot for Menahem Golan's post-Cannon Group 21st Century Film Corporation but never theatrically released.

Matt Salinger (nephew of J.D.) plays Steve Rogers as he fights the Red Skull both in the `40s and again after he's frozen in time; Scott Paulin essays his arch-nemesis while a better-than-the-movie-deserves supporting cast includes Ronny Cox, Ned Beatty, Darren McGavin, Michael Nouri and Melinda Dillon. ""Captain America"" does move along briskly and has a few fun moments but is basically let down by threadbare production values (there's a WLVI TV-56 Boston microphone during a White House press briefing!) and terrible editing. Pyun further claims his film was ruined by Golan in post-production, but this charge isn't entirely supported by his recent so-called ""Director's Cut"" that the director sold a couple of years ago on his website (sadly I was dumb enough to buy a copy; the Blu-Ray version looked like some third-gen Youtube video!).

Particularly compared to the dramatic stylings of Reb Brown (who played Rogers in a pair of failed '70s TV pilots), Salinger is actually quite good as Cap -- the movie is more about Steve Rogers than the man in the suit, and there are intermittent moments where the film is effective. Tolkin's script, meanwhile, hits many of the same narrative buttons as the recent Marvel movie, but needed a more seasoned director and a stronger budget for it to come together.

Nevertheless, Shout's Blu-Ray goes a long way to making the '90 ""Captain America"" respectable. Previously available as a manufactured-on-demand DVD release that recycled its old home video master, Shout's Blu-Ray of ""Captain America"" is a vast improvement on any prior presentation of the picture. The AVC encoded 1080p transfer is detailed and satisfying, opening up the old 4:3 frame for a bolder, more colorful widescreen image that immediately enhances the cramped full-screen release of every prior transfer. The stereo sound is fine, and extras include a brand new, 20-minute featurette with Pyun and the good-natured Salinger lamenting the production's thrifty production values. Recommended for Marvel completists, and a reminder to younger viewers that those of us who grew up in the `80s often had to endure movies like this as our source of superhero entertainment - a far cry from the mega-budget, and hugely entertaining, big-screen comic book flicks of today.",1367539200,,2472,5.269035532994923

473799,2,6302447739,"In a word? Bad. More than one word? Has potential, but ends up sucking. What you have here is a movie that sounds good on the treatment and even looks promising when looking at the script. However in execution falls flat on many levels. To be fair this version of Captain America has its good moments. The problem is they are too few and are outweighed by the very bad elements of this film.

I'm still trying to fathom the thinking behind making this movie. 21st Century Film is a small operation. I get that. However when you look at this film, that was made in the early 90's, it looks like it was done in the 70's. I'm not just talking about cinematography and quality of cameras. I'm talking plot structure, music, special effects, stunt work, a whole of lot of elements that make a movie. It all feels like this movie should have been seen as a TV movie alongside 70's Wonder Woman and Spider-Man. More care really should have been taken putting it together instead of trying to get it released in time for Captain America's 50th anniversary (which they missed that deadline anyway).

Where to begin? Lets start with the story as it is the more complicated aspect that shows some good elements as well as bad. On the good side we have a pretty tidy explanation about how ole' Cap gets his abilities and why we don't have an army of shield wielding super soldiers. The backstory of Steve Rogers and his 40's sensibility and how he copes with waking in the modern world has a good deal of heart to it.

And... that's about it. Now we have to deal with the atrociously disconnected origin story of arch nemesis The Red Skull that starts off with the massacre of his entire family and moves from there to his callous treatment as a child. You would think after all this Red Skull would take vengeance on his ""benefactors"", but instead we are supposed to assume this history merely explains why he is a bad guy because he was treated bad. Doesn't really connect on film that way. Once you get past the origin and back stories the main plot tends to just coast in neutral throughout the film. What motivates the baddies into being bad is yawn worthy. What motivates Captain America to save the day? Seems like the answer is ""just because.""

What makes the story shortcomings even worse is the inane actions that fill up space in between exposition. You get bland scenes like Captain America sneaking away from the good guys for some reason or another, villains following good guys and being stereotypically mean to people. And don't get me started on the action scenes. The movie either feels like it's in a standstill or actually gets more boring with the fights. And this is in spite of the fact the studio re-shot stunts after test screenings.

Technical aspects of this movie hurt it the most. Like I said before the camera footage looks very cheap and not much attention was made on maximizing the use of camera angles for dramatic effect. Lighting and special effects (mostly practical) further reinforce that dated look to the film. Makeup effects are actually serviceable in regards to the Red Skull's face. The one thing that stands out the most is Captain America's costume uses fake ears on his cowl. It's almost embarrassing seeing any close ups of Cap in full costume.

The acting is a mixed bag of B-Movie style nonchalance from supporting characters and some pretty decent acting from the primary. Ned Beatty does a pretty good job with what little he had to work with walking the fine line between believable reporter and comic relief. Matt Salinger actually does a good performance and gives you that feeling that his character is from a simpler time.

So this movie was intended to be released to capitalize on Captain America's 50th anniversary. Maybe that's why the cheap production values as the studio was more focused on cashing in on the timeliness. Well it looks like they did it again. This DVD was also intended to be re-released to coincide with the new theatrical release of Marvel Studio's Captain America: The First Avenger. Instead the released was pushed back a couple months and now has that onerous feeling that it's an intended bait and switch for people thinking it's the new movie out on DVD early. Sorry if you got duped, but I'm sure the packaging gave off some warning signs.

While this release is the latest and ""greatest"" there is only so much polish you can put on a turd. The source material was very cheap film stock to begin with and I doubt any amount of remastering will make it look any better than the 70's TV show vibe it started out with. In other words no high fidelity images and lots of specks and scratches. I think the audio fares a little better on Dolby Digital Stereo than previous releases, but it's been a while since I rented the old version. The only special feature includes is the ""Theatrical Trailer"", which is ironic as it was straight to video release in the United States with very limited theatrical release internationally.

So should you buy this DVD? No way. Not unless you already seen this movie and really like it. In that case this is the best (and likely last) release available.

The setting in the 40's certainly conjured up grand images of World War II with our hero fighting Red Skull in the midst of all of that. But this isn't it. It's not even a shadow of it. Even if you can forgive it for it's low budget effects, there is no getting around some of the dumbest casting choices in film history. Billy Mumy (aka Will Robinson from Lost in Space) as General Fleming...REALLY? Ned Beatty as an overgrown nerd turned newspaper reporter is hilarious. And Darren McGavin (aka the Night Stalker from the early 70's) as the 'evil' backstabbing government insider is just about as believable as a dark Mr. Rogers. And let's not even get started with the lead role played by Matt Salinger. His goody two-shoes attitude would make a 40 year old virgin blush. You know there's a reason why Salinger hasn't done much in his acting career. It's because he didn't have a career in acting.

Let's be honest. If you can rationalize this film as somehow being a good movie, your either drowning in bad taste or are most likely blinded by some false sense of nostalgia that shouldn't be there. The dialogue and acting makes the TV movies of Capt America look award winning. Cap's suit looks like an air brushed scuba suit. And everyone in the film looks like they were held at gun point to say some of the dumbest lines in film history. Do yourself a favor. If you have a positive memory of this movie, don't buy it.

For better or for worse, this movie is what it is...and if you don't know what that is, you probably shouldn't make this a ""blind-buy"".  I grew up with it, so I happen to like it...but I do not like this DVD.

Immediately, it starts out with a warning, claiming something along the lines of ""This is the best source we could find.""  TRANSLATION: ""We couldn't be bothered to make a new transfer, so enjoy this old one.  And, thanks for the cash.""

As far as I can tell, MGM's MOD edition recycles the one made for the 1992 VHS and LaserDisc versions.  Video is a cropped 4x3 full screen presentation.  I had hoped it was open-matte, but after comparing it to a UK edition, I am certain it has been cropped.

And, like the '92 VHS and LD releases, quality is quite poor.  Colors are washed-out, the picture is soft, there is heavy grain, and loads of rainbow-artifacts grace the image.

Oh, I forgot to mention the compression problems.  Yep, this baby has some pretty big areas of block noise during some of the fast moving action scenes (like the machine gun fire at night during the early portions of the film).

Audio is Dolby stereo and sounds adequate, but has some occasional pops.  And, I also think I heard some mild ""hiss"" at times.  However, given that I am sending this back to Amazon in a hurry, I don't have time to check it more thoroughly.

As for extras, a theatrical trailer is included.  I would say ""hooray"", but the quality of the movie itself has left me quite apathetic.

In closing, MGM has delivered the legal equivalent to all the ""bootlegs"" floating around the ""grey market""...complete with being on a DVD-R disc.  If you're desperate to own the '92 ""Captain America"" on DVD, be my guest...but prepare to be underwhelmed.

This Captain is not a steroid super muscled guy but a skinny guy who had polio who was given the Super Solider serum.

This Transformed him into a Batman type of Super Athlete.

And the added plot line of love lost because his girl friend who he left behind waited for him quite a few years holding out hope he was still alive.

It also had a green theme also with the bill to reduce toxic waist by the president.

This also gave the Red Scull a good back story as a boy who was a genius level who was taken from his family given the same treatment as Captain America and was disfigured.

Salinger's song Matt, this film probably deserves to be left in the movie graveyard. But hey, it provided some entertaining Live-Tweets that I made during the course of the film. They will shed light on this film, and they will hopefully entertain more than the movie did.

Wow, Billy Mumy grows up to look exactly Darren McGavin. Who knew?

Captain America just went into the ladies restroom. There's screaming ladies & this is unintentionally hilarious.

Fact: Captain America is useless without a shield, which he mostly uses as a glorified boomerang.

Captain America also substitutes a table for a shield fairly easily. In fact, he doesn't like his suit very much either.

Red Skull doesn't do much. He has his daughter do most everything.

Red Skull doesn't have a red skull either. He got plastic surgery so he just looks like Old Italian White Guy Skull.

Fact: Red Skull killed JFK, MLK & RFK. I don't know why Oliver Stone didn't figure that one out.

Fact: Captain America likes to do backflips.

Yeah, Captain America just saved Eastern Europe by knocking Red Skull off a cliff! Wait, somethings not right there...

473865,2,6302447739,"Travesty, thy name is ""Captain America"".  The acting is spotty, the music is cheesy, it had so much quick cuts that it's nauseating, and the whole production value feels like it was made straight for a TV movie.  However, despite being an underwhelming effort, I don't hate this movie.  The film didn't make me throw a fit, feel uncomfortable, or have any homicidal tendencies towards anyone involved in the production, because it's pretty straightforward in what the film tried to be.

While the majority of the cast gave a B-grade performance, at least they don't make themselves sound goofy or attempt to retort a corny one-liner.  I actually like Scott Paulin's role as The Red Skull, because while the actor can't seem to decide if he wanted to be a crime boss or a supervillain, he kept his character low-key; his smooth and serious attitude actually made him appear intimidating, at least he's not acting like a Power Ranger villain&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/like-a-certain-androgynous-nemesis-from-a-flaming-skull-movie/dp/B000OVLBF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">like a certain androgynous nemesis from a flaming skull movie</a>.  The president of this movie is quite helpful in saving the day; sure, he's not Bill Pullman from ""Independence Day"", but he can put up a fight when he's in danger. As for Matt Salinger as Captain America, he's not really a good actor, but he did the best to be patriotic with his role.  I don't think the movie really needs one actress to play two characters, it feels like a lazy attempt to establish a familiar new love interest for the hero.

The plot is quite a mess, no way around it.  How did Red Skull know all about Captain America's name when they first met?  How did Red Skull manage to stay fit even though he's around 80 years old after the timeskip?  How did America's top security manage to let The President get kidnapped in his own country?  How did Captain America's manage to get from Alaska to California on a non-stop car ride with a single gas tank?  Why are Red Skull's minions consist of Italian models?  Aside from these uncertain plot elements, this is about as simple as it gets: American supersoldier fights Nazi supersoldier.  Although the film's done on the cheap, the special effects weren't that bad at the time; seeing CapAm throws his disk at objects was quite impressive, if a bit too floaty.

Once the reboot ""Captain America"" movie comes out, regardless of quality, this oldie would be ignored and thrown out like a scab.  I won't sympathize with this one, but it's not quite the disaster people make it out to be.

473867,4,6302447739,"There have several film/TV versions of Captain America going back to the 1940's, this one is the closest adaptation of the comics.

The movie is not fantastic by any means, but it does have some redeeming qualities that I think overshadow the bad.

The Good:

-The costume and shield are faithful re-creations of the classic ""Cap"" look and are actually used throughout the film.

-We actually get to see the Red Skull with a Red Skull, even if it is only for a short while.

-The story contains footage of Cap during WWII, being frozen in ice and then being unfrozen in the present day, that ties it into some of the comic stories.

-There are actually some great story points with Steve going to see his OLD girlfriend and the Red Skull calling Cap as his ""American Brother"".

-Also, the storyline with the reporter and President who idolized Captain America as kids and how it ties into the present day is neat.

The Bad:

-The acting is pretty terrible with the exception of Ned Beatty.

-The action and effects are a little slow.

-And of course, RUBBER EARS!  The Cap costume has rubber ears, instead of using the actors real ears-it's a little distracting.

Again, this is the most faithful adaptation we have: better than the 1944 serial, better than the 70's Reb Brown TV movies, but what will really be better is the new Marvel Studios version that should be coming out after Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk.

Not one you need to own, but if you're a Captain America fan pick it up.",1208908800,,1492,4.53932584269663
473868,3,6302447739,"After a completely unrecognizable movie serial in the 1940s and two barely recognizable and silly tv movie pilots in 1979, Cap is back and more faithful to his comic book origins than ever. The WWII portion of this film is a lot of fun, the sets and dress is reminescent of the Golden Age of comics and the diner scene alone captures the sensibility of that era as good as anything in Donner's Superman or Burton's Batman. Cap's origin story is very faithful and his storming of the Red Skull's stronghold is good exciting action.

Why we have an Italian Red Skull in the movie is bewildering, but we do, accent and all. *cringe* He looks pretty cool though and is appropiately greusome, but his prominent nose keeps his face from looking anything like a skull. Paulkin also does not have the menacing presence the character needs to be affective. The make-up helps in the WWII period, but once in present day the Skull gets plastic surgery (budget constraints?) and looses that aid. His English does improve, however, so we don't have to hear ""Capteen Amayreeca"" anymore, thank God!

The best thing about this movie is Matt Salinger. Surrounded by silliness he gives the role a sincerity and authenticity. He is not smiling dumbly like Reb Brown or hamming it up ala Adam West. He takes the role seriously and emits a low key strength and confidence that serves this character as well as Chris Reeves' Superman. (It is interesting to note the irony in the son of iconoclastic writer J.D. Salinger portraying a character who is often used as a symbol of American jingoism.)

However, this is strictly B-movie stuff. The script is full of the expected pithy sayings concerning American nationalism, what it is and what it isn't and (occasionally affective) dialogue reflecting the fear that America's day in the sun may have past it's high noon and the resilient fighting soldier spirit that refuses to give up. (They even manage to have the Red Skull throw in a ""next time we'll have made in Japan,"" concerning an American micro-radio transmitter that malfunctions.)

Final verdit:  If you turn your brain on low, this is good two-fisted fun and Cap fans will want to see it atleast once for its faithfulness. The end is a rousing fist/gun/shield battle involving Cap, the President, the Skull and his minions. Should be on DVD, if only for historical purpose. Heck, the 1989 Punisher film is available.

Dr. Vaseli escapes to America where she perfects the process and helps the American Military transform Polio-ridden Steve Rogers into the Star Spangled Avenger 'Captain America' (Matt Salinger).  Aided by two Resistance Fighters (Scene deleted), Captain America to a hidden Nazi Fortress, Captain America encounters his nemesis, the Red Skull,  where he is defeated and strapped to a rocket that the Nazis are planning to launch launch at the White House to kill President Roosevelt.  Cap heroically manages to stop the rocket from crashing into the White House; but it crashes in the Alaskan Tundra where he is frozen for the next 50 years.

While Captain America is frozen, the Red Skull and plots and successfully carries out the deaths of John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King with the help of a group of international businessmen and General Fleming (Mumy/McGavin).  Now, they are planning on kidnapping President Kimball (Cox) and controlling his mind to do their evil bidding.  Luckily for the Red, White and Blue, Cap is accidently found by an Alaskan Surveying Team and thawed out where upon he tried to return home and while he finds that things have drastically changed; Captain America is torn between duty and the love of his former girlfriend, Bernice (Gillingham).

473888,1,6302447739,"Within the first fifteen minutes of watching this movie, I was in pain.  It was a sheer physical act of will to remain in front of the TV screen, as each anguished minute passed.
Could this, in fact, be the worst movie ever made?  It certainly is fatally flawed in every aspect.  The acting is not worthy of the name.  The story is terminally unbelievable without actually achieving any sense of fantasy.  The plot is full of errors that are perhaps more like plot-exit-wounds than mere plot-holes.
The characters are facile, the make-up apalling, the props are jarring and the special effects are decidedly less than special.  The settings are cliched, the camera-work makes reality TV look good, and the fight scenes would scarcely do justice to a school pantomime.
This movie truly tests the strength of your stomach.  It lurches from the mock-violent to the insultingly-stupid, passing through the ghastly-sweet on the way.
The ultimate insult in this movie is the fundamental premise.  The president of the U.S. is kidnapped because he has decided to ignore the pressure from big business and make a unilateral stance against pollution - whatever the political and economic cost.
Sadly, we now know that this is the absolute opposite to the tragic truth of US environmental non-policy.  Compared to this piece of fantasy, every other brain-damaged piece of unbelivable plot that this movie inflicts on us seems relatively realistic.",1015977600,,1437,5.055084745762712

I love comics and all of the movies based on them so when I had the chance to get this on Blu-Ray I had to get it. I remember this coming out on VHS in the 90s and had not seen it since. Sure I have the VHS but I have not popped this in since then. So I had to get this and watch it again with my brother.

The story of course as we know is about Steve Rogers, a man who wants to serve his country but is physically not as strong as needed. But as fate would have it a serum was created to make him into a super soldier. Unfortunately the Nazis have their own super soldier called The Red Skull. After battling each other at first meeting a series of events lead to Cap being frozen alive only to be thawed in modern day[80s/90s]. Now that Cap is back he must adapt to this new time and also find the villain that sent him to an icy grave.

This film was directed by Albert Pyun who also gave us flicks such as The Sword and the Sorcerer and the JCVD flick Cyborg and the Full Moon classics Dollman & Arcade among others. I think he did a pretty good job with this flick as the pacing is done well and for a movie that will unfairly be compared to the new Cap flicks still is not bad. It was written by Lawrence Block who wrote the Tobe Hooper film The Funhouse and Stephen Tolkin who gave us some episodes of The Legend of the Seeker. It is a fun script which to some liberties with the comics but I enjoyed it. The cast was great Scott Paulin in particular looked like he had a great time playing The Red Skull. The Blu-Ray comes with a great little doc featuring Pyun and lead actor who played Cap Matt Salinger discussing how the film was made. This is a fun flick that I think most comic fans would enjoy.",1518739200,,1727,4.0

7826680,4,6302447739,"The 1990 live action film adaptation of ""Captain America"" is one of the top contenders in the realm of so bad it's great cinema. Poorly directed by Albert Pyun and featuring a hilariously bad Matt Salinger in the title role, this no budget release features a nonstop succession of bad creative decisions which somehow manages to still entertain for all of the wrong reasons. The cast also features Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty who are obviously slumming it. Denied a theatrical release in the United States, it barely got a theatrical release overseas before being relegated to VHS purgatory. Shout Factory comes to the rescue bringing it to blu-ray for its overdue high definition debut.

Presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio which is slightly opened up from its original theatrical exhibition of 1.85:1, I was surprised at how great the transfer was for its blu-ray debut. Colors really pop and detail is abundant and refined without over zealous use of digital noise reduction. While being on a single layer disc, the bit rate remains healthy throughout. Sound is presented in 2 channel lossless audio. English subtitles sadly are not included.

The only extra included is a good one. The director and star talk for about 20 minutes on their ambitions making the film, why it didn't work and how they feel about it all of these years later.

While not a good film by any stretch of the imagination, it is still entertaining to watch due to all involved had their hearts in the right place even if they failed overall. Shout Factory gives it a solid blu-ray release which while sadly lacking in extensive special features contains excellent visual and audio. Recommend!",1496534400,,1665,4.876325088339223

7826684,4,6302447739,"I bought this for my younger brother who has become quite a Captain America fan in light of these new films with him now becoming an avid collector. (He's a teenager). I remembered having once seen the film before and remembered it to be ""Unwatchably Horrible."" We were both pleasantly surprised when we watched the film together and found it to be ridiculously goofy and entertaining. My brother is able to think about films and how they were made in the context of their time and this film he is willing to give many of the special effects a pass due to its time and budget and acting (while not good at all) is sellable for the most part in this ridiculous origin story that doesn't adapt the comic book well at all.

I still do not believe it is the worst of the pre-X-Men Marvel films. That award surely belongs to Howard the Duck (which is a big budget, theatrical disaster of a film) or the direct to tv Spider-Man films where even these 1990 effects put those to shame. This film is clearly something that was meant to be theatrical but was (justly) pulled from being released and instead given to a TV network to air (although it was theatrical in some moments). This film was fun to laugh at (in some places how bad the film is) and it never seems to take itself too seriously. It's by no means Unwatchable and actually is more enjoyable to watch multiple times as we love showing it to people and shocking them at how bad a movie of Captain America could be. The cast tries its hardest, and the premise is really dumb. Its literally a children's comic book brought to life, just hardly any of the excitement that comes with it. If you're a Captain America fan or Marvel fan, pick up a copy or find it to rent or online (I believe it can be found on YouTube, if not to watch then to rent) Count your blessings that we have the Marvel Cinematic Universe and how far these properties have come. Perhaps its films like these that showed these studios how NOT to do it.",1488499200,,1975,4.35230352303523
