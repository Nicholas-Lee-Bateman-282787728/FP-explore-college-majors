7688719,5,B01CQOVHWM,"The UV codes ARE for the Unrated Ted and Unrated Ted 2.  It's weird.  The paper insert says Unrated, but when you go to the Universal redemption site it says RATED R.  Then, when you redeem to Vudu, it unlocks the UNRATED versions of both films.  I already had the R Rated versions, so I was pleased to have the UNRATED versions unlocked.  Flash Gordon is the same version as previously released on VUDU.",1462492800,4,404,4.405405405405405
7688720,1,B01CQOVHWM,"The first Ted movie redeemed the R-Rated version instead of the Unrated version in iTunes, like it was supposed to and is listed to do on the redemption card. I emailed Universal about it, and this was their reply.

8753796,5,B01CQOVHWM,"This collection has three films: one of the best comedies to have come out this decade, its sequel, and one of the classic sci-fi/fantasy films...and all three films are excellent. I loved the Ted films and I have a greater appreciation for Flash Gordon now than I did when I first saw it as a little kid. And having all three films on Blu-Ray (the Ted films are unrated, by the way) in a great collection is a must for anyone who loves Seth MacFarlane's work and Flash Gordon.",1512518400,3,477,4.370786516853933
