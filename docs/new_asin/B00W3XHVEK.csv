7119735,5,B00W3XHVEK,"This DVD was led by Erin Myers, who wrote two of the books that I reviewed in my last scoliosis post. She was very enthusiastic in the video, which made it very engaging. Erin takes the viewer through forty minutes of core stretches and exercises specifically for people with scoliosis. She also gave very clear directions, so it was easy to follow.

I liked that she started off the video with some warm ups. I could feel the stretch in my back. My biggest fear going into this DVD was that it was going to be a cardio ab workout. I know the importance of building up core strength with scoliosis, but I hate doing forty minutes of ab burning workouts. This didn't feel like that. I sped up my heart rate and I could feel the burn at some parts, but it was the perfect amount.

Another fear I have with workouts is if it will hurt my back. I did not feel any back pain with this video. In fact, Erin provides a guide for individualizing some of the exercises based on your curve. This makes it clear that she understands that not all backs are the same, therefore, they may need some slight adjustments to avoid pain and maximize the benefits. I did start to get a stiff neck by the end of the video (which is common for me when I work out my core). So my only suggestion would be to include some neck strengthening exercises too [scoliosis impacts the whole body, after all].

Even if you don't have scoliosis, this is a great core-strengthening video.

7119736,5,B00W3XHVEK,"I ordered this DVD a while ago, but am just now starting to use it. My scoliosis has improved a lot by doing the types of exercises demonstrated on this DVD. It has been convenient to use this DVD when I need can't get out of the house to attend a class. Modifications are discussed and it's nice to be able to go at my own pace.",1445558400,9,329,3.925373134328358
8712007,1,B00W3XHVEK,"As a person with a s curve, these are not appropriate excercises, in my opinion. This CD has regular excercises where she occasionally puts A support. If you don't have scoliosis these excercises are good and basic.",1534204800,,215,4.837837837837838
8712008,5,B00W3XHVEK,Very good quality produced and have only watched a few times but soon will watch more often with exercises.,1506038400,,107,4.684210526315789
8712009,5,B00W3XHVEK,"She is positive and happy almost to the point of being silly, but this is likely in large part to how HAPPY her body must feel because of her impressive strength and flexibility She has EXCELLENT cues and inspired me to know what is possible, and gave me the movements to fix my spine and get nice and strong.",1493251200,3,309,4.254237288135593
8712010,5,B00W3XHVEK,Thank you Erin for this video. I feel so much better.,1489622400,,53,3.909090909090909
8712011,2,B00W3XHVEK,The video has some exercises that can be done without trouble. The video has bad quality and it not a general scoliosis video. it has a specific type.,1476921600,3,150,4.392857142857143
8712012,5,B00W3XHVEK,"After spending the day reading Erin Myers' blogs and fb page, it was clear she really knows her stuff. I've been searching for guidance in dealing with my scoliosis and simply reaching dead ends. As a cyclist, my friends who can help fit my bike don't know about scoli and my amazing chiropractor doesn't know enough about cycling. This leaves me searching out how to be more comfortable on the bike on my own. I prayed for help and Erin is literally an answer to that prayer. Not that this dvd has anything to do with cycling, but it fits beautifully in my plan to safely strengthen my core for cycling. I've been trying to figure this puzzle out for a couple of years and have (on my own) drawn the stick figure of my spine/shoulders/pelvis to help ""see"" my issues clearly. I nearly cried when I saw Erin's instructions to do the same. She puts so much power in our hands to truly own our scoli. I have been in despair, thinking of giving up cycling and in a pity party about my scoliosis but Erin gave me hope. The video is clear and easy even though I've only been walking and not working out hard in several months. By easy I mean do-able in my stiff, tight status. It was challenging enough with ways to make it harder when I'm ready. I have been walking around all day feeling stronger, taller, and not as twisted! She didn't waste time explaining everything while we wait to follow, she talks you through it. The pace was slightly fast but that's great to me because I get impatient with all the instruction after the first few times I've done a DVD. How refreshing it was to hear what I was feeling while working out was normal for a scoli!",1472428800,6,1649,4.357142857142857
8712013,5,B00W3XHVEK,"I have a second degree scoliosis with some old injuries and arthritis around it. This video really helps me with pain management, I don't need any medication.",1471651200,4,158,4.888888888888889
8712014,5,B00W3XHVEK,"This was amazing! Not only does my spine feel more flexible after completing the exercises, I feel longer and stronger. It definitely is a workout, though nothing that cannot be done by anyone, as Erin provides excellent modification information throughout the entire video.",1470009600,7,274,5.395348837209302
8712015,5,B00W3XHVEK,"I have an S- shaped curved scoliosis and recently had to start going to Physical Therapy due to intense lower back pain. Long story short, my back pain was all mechanical (thank goodness) and my Physical Therapist recommended to start doing Pilates or Yogalates where I can strengthen my core as well as my surrounding muscles (glutes, legs, back, etc). Well, Pilates classes are SO expensive so as an alternative I was searching for Pilates videos that were not too intense where it would hurt my back and I stumbled upon this video. I was a little hesitant because there were only 2 reviews but I rented it anyways to give it a try.

The days I didn't have Physical Therapy, I felt so much back pain that I was discouraged to start the video because I thought it would only make my pain worse. Last weekend, I did some yard work and was bending and lifting and just had the most awful neck and back pain I decided to skip my at home physical therapy stretches and I turned on this video. Absolute best decision I could have made.

Erin is very sweet and super easy to follow in this video which is huge for me. Almost all of the stretches/exercises that I do in Physical Therapy are incorporated in this video so I knew that Erin knows her stuff! There were times in the video where I was actually talking to the TV ""Nooo... another one?"" because I could really feel the burn, but in a GREAT way. The video was 45 minutes but felt like 20 minutes, it went by so fast and my neck and back after the video felt about 90% better. I'm kicking myself for not doing this video sooner but am absolutely ecstatic that I found it and needed others to know how great this video is if they are suffering from back pain. I can't wait to see how my body will be feeling after doing this video for a few weeks - I will be back to give an update when that time comes!

Thank you Erin!! :)",1463356800,18,1875,4.246498599439776
