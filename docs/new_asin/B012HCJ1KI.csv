8726174,5,B012HCJ1KI,"This video is masterfully done.  Great historical account (very interesting!) and the horses are such eye candy, as Arabians typically are, I fell in love with the breed all over again.  I didn't know what to expect when I ordered it, but am so glad I did.  I don't think any horse lover would be disappointed.",1516060800,,310,4.5
8726175,5,B012HCJ1KI,An absolute MUST SEE for anyone that loves the Arabian horse. This is such a beautifully done video that follows the history of the Arabian Horse In Poland and into the United States.  Fantastic footage of historical Arabian horses including *Bask and *Naborr and so many others. I will definitely be watching it again. Thank you Horse Fly Films for such a spectacular production.,1515888000,2,380,4.9375
