8421952,5,B004BGIPPG,"I purchased this product about two months ago, and so far I am very pleased with it.  I purchased Bobby Clampett's impact book three years ago and I absolutely loved it.  When I found this item while browsing Amazon one day, I just had to get it.

I have a lot of respect for Bobby Clampett and I loved how he explained the concept of his five Dynamics in his book, and to see him teach these dynamics in this training package is even better.  As for the SyberVision part of this packaqe, I try to watch a little each day.  I believe that it is helping me with my overall golf swing and I am looking forward to watching more of it.

If you are a fan of Bobby Clampett and his teaching philosophy, I would highly recommend this SyberVision program.",1305504000,3,747,4.225352112676056
