4374667,5,B004H0M2YQ,Not a typical film for the period on exploitation.  Well done decent plot and well written.  Great to see a young Anne Francis with Lloyd Nolan as her doctor/friend.,1303344000,4,165,4.655172413793103
4374668,4,B004H0M2YQ,"I'd never heard of this film until its release by the Warner Archive; but once again, I'm grateful to them for releasing another forgotten jewel ... or in this case, a scuffed diamond from the street. Made in 1960, filmed in black & white, it's an unusually frank (for the time) depiction of a young call girl's life. Even more surprising (also for the time) is just how sympathetic it is, without the overt & heavy-handed moralizing you might have expected.

The underrated Anne Francis is that call girl, Bobbie Williams, hopelessly in love with her pimp & believing all of his empty promises, even as she moves through the New York City night in a cold, protective shell. The film opens with Bobbie staggering through the streets, wearing only her coat & a black slip, her back horribly bruised from a well-to-do john's sadistic beating. A concerned cabbie steers her to the nearby office of a doctor ... but he's a psychologist, played with a warm but professional demeanor by Lloyd Nolan.

Despite her cynicism, Bobbie isn't so lost & despairing that she's beyond seeking help. So she begins seeing the psychologist on a regular basis, while still working ""the racket"" ... and slowly, gradually she starts to understand herself. Some might consider the psychology a bit pat & simplistic by contemporary standards; but all things considered, it's portrayed reasonably as consisting of hard work, and not always succeeding. Nolan's psychologist is no miracle worker or sage, but simply a decent man determined to help if he can ... and if the patient will allow it.

What viewers will recognize as utterly contemporary is Bobbie's self-destructive mindset: willing to be abused by a man who doesn't deserve it, and then going back for more, even though she knows better. It's a familiar scenario now, but almost shocking to see in 1960. John Kerr, in a far cry from his role as the sensitive, inexperienced boy in ""Tea and Sympathy,"" gives a truly creepy performance as the pimp Larry, who'll make your skin crawl. In fact, most men come off rather badly here -- though you've got to remember what sort of men Bobbie meets in her profession. And it's balanced by a young James Broderick as a kind, encouraging art teacher interested in a genuine relationship with Bobbie.

But it's Anne Francis herself who really shines in this film. Never resorting to overacting or chewing the scenery, she conveys a powerful range of emotions simply with a subtle shift of her expression & body language. Especially chilling is her understated recollection of a childhood incident with a neighbor ... brrr! Aided by superb black & white cinematography & an authentic New York setting, she brings Bobbie to life in a way that stays with you. And fittingly, the final shot is of Bobbie on her own, as she was in the beginning -- but what a different world she's walking in now!

Highly recommended!",1301011200,15,2886,4.822222222222222

8429166,5,B004H0M2YQ,"Anne Francis was one of the very best screen actresses of her time, and underrated as such. This film shows what she could do with this very sensitive  subject matter. Her other films are not to be missed..Bad Day At Black Rock, The Rack, Forbidden Planet, Blackboard Jungle, Funny Girl, and many thers.

This is one of her very best.",1499126400,,334,4.55

8429168,2,B004H0M2YQ,"Directed by Joseph Cates (""Who Killed Teddy Bear?""), this earlier production, ""Girl of the Night"" (1960) stars Anne Francis in a rare starring role, and it is unfortunate as the later successful TV star of ""Honey West"" could not redeem this film which is supposedly based on a text book case of a call girl.  Kay Medford is the madam and Lloyd Nolan is her doctor.  Despite the promise of Cates and Francis, the film is barely adequate as a social curio or as unforgettable entertainment.  Warner Archive presents a re-mastered edition, the film is in black and white. One can tell Anne Francis can be extremely good (William Conrad's ""Brainstorm""), but this leading role doesn't give her enough dramatic opportunity.",1436486400,,717,4.909090909090909

8429171,5,B004H0M2YQ,"I had never heard of this film, but LOVED Anne Francis after working with her twice and bought it just for that fact.  It was a film rare for its time,1960, about a young girl raised in a loveless home who drfits into prostitution.  Kay Medford (Barbra Striesand's mother in ""Funny Girl"") is great as a boozed-up madam, and handsome John Kerr (clean cut from ""South Pacific"" and ""Tea and Sympathy"") plays a sadistic pimp.  Based on Dr. Harold Greenwald's ""The Call Girl:  A Social and Psychological Study, this is a fascinating curio, a reminder of an era that was just coming to grips with the solid side of reality.",1400371200,6,617,4.581818181818182
8429172,5,B004H0M2YQ,"So grateful to Amazon...I came across this film because of my constant browsing.  If you are a fan of film from this circa, you will enjoy this.  Great performance from Anne Francis...an underrated actress.  Worthy of an Academy Award nomination if not a win.  She walks away with this film.  Beautiful, sympathetic, no over acting...which could happen in this kind of role.  A film ahead of its time.",1318204800,7,401,4.823529411764706
8429173,4,B004H0M2YQ,"[GIRL OF THE NIGHT - (1960) - Widescreen presentation - directed by Joseph Cates]  Anne Francis is mesmerizing as Bobbie, a call girl with a troubled past, and a pimp (John Kerr) who also happens to be her abusive boyfriend and fianc.  The film opens with Bobbie running through the shadows of New York's dimly lit streets, hugging the shadows in both fear and pain before dropping into a taxi and nearly passing out. The cabbie takes her to a doctor near her home who's working late (Lloyd Nolan), except he's a psychiatrist and not a medical doctor. She refuses to see a doctor; they speak briefly while she belts down a whiskey before she snaps to her senses prior to saying something regretful and bolts out of his office. (It's amazing what constituted medical attention back in those days). When Bobbie gets home and undresses, the marks all over her back and shoulders tell the tale of a sadistic john who nearly beat her to death. And where was her pimp boyfriend during all of this?

The next day, Bobbie stops by the doctor's office to thank him for his assistance the previous night; they superficially chat before he offers her his couch (no, not for that), but she declines his professional help and leaves. She finds her slimy beau waiting in her apartment, acting unaware of her predicament the night before and disavowing any culpability for her injuries. He smoothes her over before telling her he's got something profitable lined up for her that night. She wants no part of it, but he cajoles and manipulates her into meeting him later at an upscale club they operate out of with the owner's knowledge and participation (Kay Medford as the boozing Regina). That night, Bobbie finds out that her sleazeball pimp/beau was with another broad while she was undergoing abuse the night before AND that he knew the client was a deviant but didn't think it important to share with her, knowing she would've said no. Needless to say, she's crushed, but this new knowledge gives her the courage to go back and speak with the next-door doctor professionally on a regular basis.

We then learn, over time, all the distasteful, sordid details of Bobbie's childhood traumas that forged the template for the type of woman she would inevitably become, and this is where Anne Francis is heartbreakingly realistic in her portrayal without the sleazy soapbox melodrama we've come to expect in similar tales such as this. She's tragic, engaging, fragile, embittered and insecure all at once. And she's extremely resilient over the long haul, as we come to find out. I won't spoil it with more details - if you're even mildly interested at this point, or an Anne Francis fan (btw, she never looked better, either, and this was three years prior to 'Honey West'), you'll want to set up a 'date' with this 'Girl of the Night' when your schedule allows...

PS - 'Makes a great B+W double-bill with 'A Cold Wind in August' from the same year, starring Lola Albright, from TV's 'Peter Gunn' (read my review).

This remastered edition from the Warner Archive is flawless and pristine in both audio and video presentation, as it should be at these prices.",1311724800,8,3145,4.750915750915751
