8520652,1,B007PT70RA,"This would be a travesty, if it weren't too boring to be a travesty. I'm going to say this twice, once here, and again at the end of this review:

If you were a huge fan of the first Hard Core Logo film -- DO NOT WATCH THIS. It will only piss you off and make you want to kill Bruce McDonald for utterly botching this long awaited sequel to a seminal film.

Hard Core Logo 2 should NOT be called Hard Core Logo 2 by ANY stretch of the imagination. The connection is tenuous AT BEST. None of the original actors who played the band members of Hard Core Logo are in this film. The band isn't even in the film.

The original was a fierce, funny, absorbing, lacerating, heartbreaking mockumentary about an aging, dysfunctional punk band reuniting for a tour years after they originally broke up. It starred Hugh Dillon, Callum Keith Rennie, John Pyper-Ferguson, and Bernie Coulson (with Julian Richings as Bucky Haight, and Bruce McDonald as himself as director of the mocku-documentary about their reunited tour and benefit gig.

Hard Core Logo 2 is stupid, boring, and self-indulgent. It trades on the name of the first movie. It uses a pathetically flimsy deus ex machina premise to set-up the story for HCL 2: the spirit of Joe Dick, dead lead singer of Hard Core Logo, may (or may not) be speaking through the lead singer of the band Die Mannequin, a woman named Care Failure.

On the one hand, HCL 2 comes off as shameless money-grubbing -- trading on the name of the first film to attract a built-in audience and their $$. On the other hand, HCL 2 comes off as a self-promoting, pseudo-insightful, superficial examination of documentary film making ethics and the relationship of director to subject(s).

Fictional! Bruce McDonald in HCL 2 seems to raise questions about his manipulation of his documentary subjects in the original Hard Core Logo film (including leaking information without consent (and lying about it) to inflame the drama between the two lead documentary subjects), and his role/responsibility in the tragedy that ensued.

He supposedly does this in HCL 2 while investigating whether or not Care Failure is truly possessed by Joe Dick's spirit.  And that would be fine... if it were not done in such a self-promoting, navel-gazing way -- and if it were not ultimately plotted and edited in an *unbelievably* boring and tiresome way.

Once I got over the crushing disappointment (and feeling of being ripped off) at discovering that none of the actors who were in the original film are to be found in this one (except for Julian Richings), I thought that, at least, there would be some inherent suspense in learning whether or not Care Failure truly WAS channeling  the spirit of Joe Dick. (...or if she, like Joe Dick in the first film, is scamming Bruce for her own purposes.)

There could also have been some smart, satirical commentary on documentaries as darlings of the festival circuit, the trend of documentary directors cum wanna-be-blockbuster-filmmakers using documentaries (and their documentary subjects) to catapult themselves to success in fiction film making, like they secretly always desired.

Yet the plot, script and execution of HCL 2 are so bad and so incredibly boring, I fell asleep 2/3 of the way through HCL2 and didn't even bother to finish watching it. Not even the premise -- is Joe Dick's spirit *really* communicating through this female rocker?? -- and the theoretically inherent suspense of exploring it, could overcome the bad writing, the awkward and stilted scenes, the self-indulgent nature.  I'm not sure how Bruce McDonald failed to make suspenseful the question of whether or not Joe Dick's spirit truly possessed Care Failure... but he did fail, utterly.

The characters, most especially Bruce's fictionalized version of himself, are not only not interesting, but the fictional! Bruce of this film is an even bigger ass than he was in the original.  I *get* that that is part of the point. But it's executed so badly -- lamely and phenomenally cheaply -- that the entire thing comes off as direct-to-video dreck made quickly on a super-low budget just to make a buck for the director (real! Bruce).

The film-within-a-film aspects that gave the original its satirical, canny complexity come off as precious and arrogant here.  Basically, neither the story nor the characters in HCL 2 are interesting enough to bother watching. We learn little about Care Failure, so it's impossible to care for her as a character. As she is written and portrayed, Care Failure also has none of the persistence, pathos, wily charm, or desperate drive of Joe Dick in the original Hard Core Logo.

In a way, I feel a little bad for Care Failure: stepping into the footsteps of a beloved character from a global cult film via a bottom-feeding sequel like this, has probably done her no favors.

The aspects of HCL2 that *could* have been an artful examination of, and true meditation on, the relationship of documentary director to documentary subject -- and vice versa -- are wasted. Fictional! Bruce chastises himself in HCL 2 for his role in the original film's tragedy. Yet it comes off as overweening, self-indulgent smarminess driven by fictional! Bruce's wish to be absolved or forgiven for his role and responsibility in the tragedy of the first HCL. It doesn't feel authentically regretful or remorseful.

Maybe that's part of the point, too. But when it's executed so poorly, with such uninteresting characters, lackluster writing, and crappy production values, it's impossible to care.

As I said earlier, this movie was so un-involving that I feel asleep 2/3 of the way through it. When I woke up, I did NOT rewind to the part where I fell asleep in order to re-watch the ending I slept through.  It simply wasn't worth my time. And I had no emotional investment in either the characters or the plot, due to the crap writing and lousy execution.

I say that having sat through some incredibly slow moving art and foreign films. From Tarkovsky to Nicholas Windig Refn, those incredibly slow moving films at least had compelling enough stories and characters to keep me watching, despite being even more glacially paced than HCL 2. I'm a pretty tolerant viewer and not wedded to narrative story structure (I've seen my share of Maya Deren and other experimental films). So I can more than tolerate really slow moving films; I even quite enjoy some of them.

I can also tolerate low budget films (Hard Core Logo certainly had its cheesy low-budget moments and poor budget choices, like spending all that money on an animatronic elk for one scene, yet using that ridiculous miniature model goat van on an asphalt cylinder to repeatedly portray the bands van traveling from gig to gig on the reunion tour.)

But HCL 2 is just *bad*. Bad writing, bad characterization, no plot, extreme low budget, artless execution and self-indulgent smarminess.

THANK GOD I did not pay to see HCL 2 (either in the theater, or on DVD, or streaming). Otherwise, I would have been REALLY pissed off.  I watched it via HuluPlus.  I was completely shocked to see it was available, and then I got excited... only to be terribly disappointed and irritated.

(Well, I guess I did pay for HCL2 since I pay for HuluPlus -- but I paid pennies on the dollar, since I'm getting my $8/month worth of HuluPlus watching a bunch of other stuff, including all the Criterion Collection stuff HuluPlus has; who knew?)

My advice?

If you were a huge fan of the first Hard Core Logo film -- DO NOT WATCH THIS. It will only piss you off and make you want to kill Bruce McDonald for utterly botching this long awaited sequel to a seminal film.

How, how, HOW Bruce couuld do this to the Hard Core Logo universe he so lovingly created in the first film, I'll never know or understand. Whatever the motivation, the execution comes across as a masturbatory exercise in fictional! Bruce's self-referential pseudo-growth of a conscience he didn't exhibit in the first film.

For the record, there are better written sequels/continuations (some way, WAY better) amongst the plethora of HCL fanfic -- some real gems that maintain the utterly dysfunctional group and pair (Joe/Billy) dynamics, while also capturing the humor and pathos of the situation and characters the way the original film did.",1432425600,,8300,4.855524079320113
8520653,1,B007PT70RA,"ok Bruce McDonald made a really good movie about a band getting together for one last tour.....GREAT movie...this ""sequel"" is the worst self indulgent waste of celuloid....PERIOD.  I would be embaresed to show My face anywhere if this were My film...thanks for wasting My hard earned money, Bruce...give ten dollars(U.S.) to Hugh for Me.",1361923200,2,337,5.2407407407407405
