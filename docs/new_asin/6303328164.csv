629167,4,6303328164,"Although she is little known today, Deanna Durbin was one of the most popular stars of the 1930s, a pretty teenager with a perky personality and a much-admired operatic singing voice.  This 1937 was her first major film, and it proved a box-office bonanza for beleaguered Universal Studios.
THREE SMART GIRLS concerns three daughters of a divorced couple who rush to their long-unseen father when their still-faithful mother reveals he may soon remarry--with the firm intention of undermining his gold-digger girlfriend and returning him to their mother.  Although the story is slight, the script is witty and the expert cast plays it with a neat screwball touch.  Durbin has a pleasing voice and appealing personality, and such enjoyable character actors as Charles Winninger, Alice Brady, Lucile Watson, and Mischa Auer round out the cast.  A an ultra-light amusement for fans of 1930s film.",1021334400,4,893,5.223776223776224
629168,5,6303328164,Deanna Durbin is a treasure not well known to today's generation but was well loved in her time. If you enjoy  movies like Parent Trap you will love the original take on children trying to get their parents together. This  hilarious movie includes the fabulous singing voice of Deanna that makes it  the tops with me. A definate 'must see' if you enjoy comedy and music. If  you like this one you will adore the sequal Three Smart Grow Up.,960940800,11,439,4.45

629246,5,6303328164,"I've had this set almost since it first came out in 2004. It was the only dvd release of Deanna Durbin's movies at the time. The rest were on VHS and I have most of those too. Her voice is magical and most of the movies are funny and light hearted. My favorite is ""It Started With Eve"", but I really enjoy all of them. All but one of her movies is in black and white. ""Can't Help Singing"" is the only movie she made in color.
I wouldn't call these movies musicals in the strongest sense, as she is really the only one doing the singing, with the exception of one or two that have backup singers due to the theme of the story. If you like beautiful singing you aren't likely to be disappointed with any of Deanna Durbin' s movies. The dvds with only one movie are a bit pricey, considering most are made to order on -R discs, so I recommend this set to see how much you enjoy her movies before getting the singles.",1482969600,,913,4.106145251396648

629344,5,6303328164,"As a music-lover who recently discovered Deanna Durbin through a movie on TCM, I ordered the Sweetheart Pack, mainly in order to see Cant Help Singing, since it contained music by Jerome Kern, one of my favourite composers of light opera. Cant Help Singing proved every bit as delightful as I had hoped. The singing was fabulous, the romance was charming, and the comedy deliciously light and bright, with a couple of villains who could have qualified for an English pantomime. My husband and I continued to watch and enjoy all the other films on the DVD. The set gave a good overview of Durbin throughout her career, having early films from her teen years and others from her later work.  Anyone who enjoys good singing and well-paced light comedy would enjoy these films, several of which seem remarkably little dated in spite of their age. Durbin was a wonderful performer and seeing these films demonstrates without a doubt why she was such a major star.",1457049600,,958,4.771084337349397

629349,5,6303328164,"Deanna Durbin was the real thing, a girl who loved to sing and had a great voice to prove it. This was her breakthrough film, one which led to over twenty more and which saved Universal Studios from bankruptcy. She had fans of all ages throughout her career. Three Smart Girls is typical of the films she did for Universal, light comedy/romances with singing. It's not a musical in the usual sense: people don't just start singing where there would usually be dialog. She sings three numbers (My Heart Is Singing, Someone To Care For Me and Il bacio) to people in the film with her singing as part of the plot.

Unusually, it's not totally her vehicle, as her sisters in the film get almost equal screentime (but no songs). The plot revolves around them going to New York from Switzerland where they live with their mother, to prevent their father (their parents are divorced), from marrying a notorious golddigger,played hilariously by English actress Binnie Barnes. Along the way there are many mixups and misunderstandings but you already know all will turn out well in the end. The cast works wonderfully well together and includes Charles Winnager as Judson Craig (the father), Nan Grey and Barbara Read as the sisters and Ray Milland as a young English Lord. Supporting parts include Alice Brady as the golddigger's scheming mother, Nella Walker as the girl's mother and Ernest Cossart as his usual butler.

Though much depends on the gullability of Judson Craig, it's easy to assume he's having a foolish spell in his later middle age and know that the three girls will eventually set him straight. The whole film is quick and delightful and will be a treat for anyone who remembers Deanna Durbin, or has discovered her somewhere along the way.",1449360000,2,1751,4.7947019867549665

629384,5,6303328164,"Wow!  What a surprise!  Not only does Deanna Durbin have a lovely, limpid voice, but she's got acting chops.  Most importantly, this collection has some really excellent films.  These are witty, romantic, and lots of fun.  I only remember seeing Deanna Durbin in ""It's a Date"" before purchasing this DVD set (on the recommendation of a friend), and I can't adequately express my surprise and pleasure at how enjoyable these movies are.  If you like classic Hollywood comedies and dramas, I can't imagine why you wouldn't like this collection.  There are two clunkers in the set -- the final two films: ""Can't Help Singing"" and ""Lady on a Train"".  The first is an inane operetta with very broad comedy and a paper-thin cliched plot, the second is a comedy whodunnit that is better than the operetta, but relies on several impossibilities in order to resolve.  Just the same, ""Three Smart Girls"" alone is worth $15, but six films for $15, four of which are really good -- a steal!",1438214400,,978,4.739644970414201

629389,5,6303328164,"Deanna Durbin is culturally important because of the beauty of her singing voice. This snug package of six of her 21 feature films is a good value but lacks some extras that a discriminating customer would like to see (commentary tracks, interviews, historical footage, trailers, cut scenes). Nevertheless, the package does provide subtitles and section headings, both of which aid the episodes with singing. The films are presented in a ""flippy"" format with two films on the front side and one on the reverse. So there are only two disks. The reproductions of the films are good, clean, and unexceptional. As to the films themselves, some of Durbin's best work emerged from the direction of her mentor, Henry Koster, and three of the six Durbin-Koster collaborations are here: THREE SMART GIRLS (DD #1), FIRST LOVE (DD #6), IT STARTED WITH EVE (DD #10). These three by themselves make this offering from Universal Studios, Durbin's home studio, worth the price of the package. In 1936, THREE SMART GIRLS was a huge hit earning 500% over cost in its initial release. It saved Universal Studios from bankruptcy. FIRST LOVE pushed the early World War II news off the front pages and launched Robert Stack's movie career. IT STARTED WITH EVE ended the run of ten consecutive block busters, a feat unmatched in the history of American cinema. And what a splendid film ""Eve"" is: Charles Laughton, Robert Cummings, and Deanna Durbin make a fascinating team of players in a film perfectly conceived and executed. What so distinguishes a Koster film is its craftsmanship. The other three films are also worthy of note--two of them for their music. SOMETHING IN THE WIND (DD #19) has about five songs commissioned from Johnny Green, longtime jazz composer and orchestra leader. He is famous as the conductor of the M-G-M orchestra. CAN'T HELP SINGING (DD #15) has songs commissioned from Jerome Kern, among his last compositions. LADY ON A TRAIN (DD #16) is a delightful but crazy send-up of the ""murder mystery"" genre. And everything in it is ridiculed including Durbin herself. Perhaps it reveals that she was tiring of her fame and Hollywood. It was directed by the French director Charles Henri David. He would become her husband five years later, and that marriage in France would last almost half a century. Deanna Durbin is the biggest movie star from Hollywood's Golden Age who has been forgotten by Americans today. This is because, sadly enough, her films are just not often shown. But she has not been forgotten in the countries of the British Commonwealth and Russian Federation. Americans seriously need to remember this superb artist of song.",1429401600,5,2647,4.977426636568849

Anyone out there who is a Deanna Durbin fan will love this 2 disc dvds  with five of the most beautiful films starring this lovely lady with the voice of an angel. Featuring her very first film ""Three Smart Girls"" where she is just a teenager in her next film ""First Love"". Based on a Cinderella story where young Deanna falls head over in heels in love with her handsome prince charming portrayed by Robert Stack who is known for giving young Deanna her first screen kiss.  Another great film on this dvd is ""It started With Eve"" starring Robert Cummings and Charles Laughton. It is a great romantic comedy filled with trickery, mischief, comedy and of course love.  In ""Lady On A Train"", Deanna is a mystery lover. While absorbed reading her murder mystery on the train, the impossible happened. You got it! She witnessed a murder. Thats when the story and the mystery unravels. Between trying to solve the case, almost getting killed and finding the man of her dreams, she never gives up until the riddle is solved. A funny and a delightful movie. And last but not least, is beautiful Deanna in the wild west. Running away from home to meet the man that she plans to marry by she joining a wsgon train and thats when all the fun begins. Little did she know was she was about to fall in love with a man that she totally despised. In ""Can't Help Singing"", you won't be able to help yourself from laughing. It has everything and lets not forget the gorgeous singing voice of this beautiful movie star. In each movie, the songs will give you goosebumps! Again any Deanna Durbin fans out there will not want to pass up this wonderful ""sweetheart"" package that Amazon is offering.

LADY ON A TRAIN ages particularly well as a comic mystery of the sort that people still enjoy, but Durbin brings enough charm & talent that all her films are at least tolerable if not enjoyable escapism.

THREE SMART GIRLS establishes the model: open with a fast-forwardable song so Durbin could show off her singing chops, then dive into romantic-comedy territory, with all the smart dialog & fancy outfits that classic Hollywood could dish out. While I could do without one or two of these titles -- SOMETHING IN THE WIND particularly screams ""chick flick"" -- the majority are well worth seeing, nicely transferred with decent sound & excellent photography.

Parts that most other actresses would just ham up, she plays a bit more delicately, showing more sides to the character yet without sacrificing the humor.

The question is whether this is one of those horrible transfers that looks like someone copied it from VHS tape. The quality is OK, but not stunning. The 2 disk format might be a surprise though.

I bought a copy of this several years ago when it first came out, loaned it and it never came home, so I decided to replace it. My original set had each movie on a separate disk - a boxed set. This set has all the movies crammed onto 2 double-sided disks. If you're expecting a box set - surprise!  Note that down in the product details it says ""2 disks"".  I have no particular attachment to the physical format unless extra compression is required to get them all on 2 disks.",1346198400,6,791,4.26
629721,5,6303328164,"Back in the '30s and '40s, when Hollywood rolled out them big production musicals, Deanna Durbin was in her heyday and basked in her tremendous talent and universal appeal. And when she had had enough at the age of 27, she bartered the fame and adoration for a quiet life somewhere in the outskirts of Paris. She never once looked back, even though Hollywood strived often to reel her back in. Mad respect to Deanna Durbin whom I prefer to her box office teen contemporary Judy Garland.

Deanna will always be regarded as the beaming child star who got Universal Studios out of hock. Her films provided Universal instant credibility and box office clout. The DEANNA DURBIN SWEETHEART PACK treats us to six of these films, including two of my all-time Durbin favorites: FIRST LOVE and IT STARTED WITH EVE. I'm probably talking outta the side of my mouth. My list of all-time favorite Durbin films encompasses half her film ouevre.

Note that the DEANNA DURBIN SWEETHEART PACK offers up two discs in unfortunately fragile packaging. Unfortunately, each disc is two-sided. Four of the six films provide their own theatrical trailer. SOMETHING IN THE WIND also comes with added bonus material: a Musical Showcase featuring Durbin's songs in SOMETHING IN THE WIND.

She never lost that unpretentious air or that poise. What her movies have accomplished is a no mean feat: they've aged so well. They retain their charm and vibrancy, no small thanks to unassuming Edna Mae, that teenaged soprano-next-door who won everyone's hearts with her sunny disposition and her spectacular voice.

- THREE SMART GIRLS (1936)

Durbin's feature film debut which gave a near bankrupt Universal Studios that miraculous shot in the arm. In THREE SMART GIRLS, the 15-year-old Deanna is part of an ensemble cast, although it doesn't take too long before she separates herself from the crowd. She plays the precocious Penny Craig who conspires with her two older sisters, Kay (Barbara Read) and Joan (Nan Grey), to reunite their ten-years-divorced parents. Except that their father, whom they haven't seen in years, is set on remarrying, this time to an ambitious socialite (Binnie Barnes). If only there were a plucky and meddlesome girl around to gum up the works.

THREE SMART GIRLS was popular enough - and Deanna Durbin was captivating enough - that it readily garnered two sequels (THREE SMART GIRLS GROW UP and HERS TO HOLD). Ray Milland has an early role as an amiable aristocrat who becomes smitten with one of Penny's lovely sisters. He also unwittingly advances Penny's plotting. Durbin is massively engaging in the first of her many ""Miss Fix-It"" roles, and her lyric soprano is on full display here. Her best number may well be the one (""Il Bacio"") she performs in the police station as she tries to pass herself off as an opera singer instead of the runaway that she is. So... blossoming romances, some pleasant adolescent hijinks, a dash of Mischa Auer as a drunken count, a shrewish Alice Brady, a fine musical intelude or two (including Binnie Barnes' rendition of ""Someone to Care for Me""), and, overwhelmingly, Deanna Durbin's rocketing to mega-stardom.

Bonus material to THREE SMART GIRLS: The movie trailer.

- SOMETHING IN THE WIND (1947)

It's like this, in this breezy musical comedy: For years now Mary Collins's dear aunt (Jean Adair) - who is also named Mary - had been party to a covert financial arrangement from her diseased lover's estate. The plot revolves around the younger Mary (Durbin, sporting a grown-up hair-do) being mistaken as the beneficiary, and hassled by the wealthy and exceedingly snooty descendants who mean to cut off the cash flow and avoid a scandal. But they're no match for Durbin's pluck.

It's neat that the film attempts something new in introducing Durbin's musicality. Her character, this time, is a successful disc jockey. I guess, back in the day, the DJ not only worked the turntable, (s)he also occasionally provided the warbling. Here, Deanna sings in a more contemporary style, although she doesn't wholly neglect her classical background. Witness the delightful jail sequence in which an incarcerated Deanna duets with Met opera singer Jan Peerce - he plays an opera-inclined jailer - on ""Miserere"" (from Verdi's ""Il Trovatore""). However, for sheer catchiness, you can't beat ""The Turntable Song"" (wonderfully reprised later in the film by Donald O'Connor and the Four Williams Brothers) and the (for Durbin) risqu ""You Wanna Keep Your Baby Looking Right (Don't You, Daddy?)"" She also shares a tune (""Happy Go Lucky and Free"") with O'Connor. O'Connor, by the way, plays the penniless third cousin (and good-natured kidnapper) Charlie Read who rapidly switches allegiance to Deanna's corner. He showcases his comic athleticism in ""I Love a Mystery."" More of a dud is the lackluster John Dall who represents Durbin's love interest, except that Dall is so stiff on camera that morticians periodically check up on him. And yet Dall's woodenness doesn't at all detract from the film's liveliness. Fun movie.

Bonus material: the movie trailer and a Musical Showcase featuring edited clips of Durbin's ""The Turntable Song,"" ""Something in the Wind,"" ""You Wanna Keep Your Baby Looking Right"" and O'Connor's ""I Love A Mystery"" (00:10:21 minutes long).

- FIRST LOVE (1939)

Yes, Deanna's in love and she indulges in her very first on-screen kiss. In one of the most enchanting reimaginings of the Cinderella fable, Deanna plays orphan Connie Harding who graduates from boarding school and moves into her rich uncle's (Eugene Pallette) sprawling New York estate. But her happily ever after would have to wait some. Connie finds herself ill received at her new home, mocked by her deadbeat male cousin and her frivolous, horoscope-consulting aunt. Her beautiful but spoiled cousin Barbara (Helen Parrish) actively conspires against her as they both vie for the attention of a handsome young bachelor (Robert Stack).

No cute warbling woodland creatures to abet this Cinderella, and no fairy godmother. What Connie has is the devotion and resources of the household servants and the steady championing of her school headmistress. FIRST LOVE modernizes and yet doesn't strive to improve on the classic fairy tale. And so we eventually arrive at that moment at the grand ball, and there's the stroke of midnight and that discarded slipper. We may not hear the likes of ""So This Is Love"" or ""A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes,"" but, no worries, Durbin unleashes a delectable song repertoire: ""Amapola (Pretty Little Poppy),"" ""Un bel di (One Fine Day),"" ""Home, Sweet, Home,"" and ""Spring in My Heart."" Such an ebullient film. And, yes, she does get her first on-screen kiss. Robert Stack, you lucky so-and-so.

- IT STARTED WITH EVE (1941)

IT STARTED WITH EVE co-stars Durbin and Robert Cummings for their third vehicle together (after 1939's THREE SMART GIRLS GROW UP and 1940's SPRING PARADE). Conversely, this would be the first time Durbin and Charles Laughton would share marquee billing (they would reconvene for 1946's BECAUSE OF HIM). Anyway, IT STARTED WITH EVE is one of Deanna's very best films.

When terminally ill millionaire Jonathan Reynolds (Laughton) voices his dying wish to meet his son Johnny's fiance - and when the fiance is unavailable - a frantic Johnny (Cummings) borrows Ohian hat check girl Anne Terry (Durbin) to pose as his intended. Reynolds Sr. takes a liking to Anne. And since there's nothing Charles Laughton detests more than not getting a (more than) fair share of the spotlight, his ailing character promptly makes a speedy recovery. And now he's asking after Anne (or, rather, ""Gloria""). This compels Johnny to press Anne into keeping up the masquerade. Things get even more sticky when Johnny's snooty fiance finally does make herself available, her gold-digging mother in tow.

IT STARTED WITH EVE is damn awesome, the sort of giddy film where people don't casually navigate the stairs as much as recklessly race up and down 'em. It packs in a lot of screwball laughs. It vexes a hardworking train porter along the way (""Lady, the next time you ain't goin' no place, why don't you try a plane?""). The three lead actors are pitch perfect and bolstered by a rollicking supporting cast. Deanna Durbin owns this movie, yeah, but only by a hair. I often find Charles Laughton too over-the-top, so hear my jaw thudding to the floor with regards to his performance here, marvelously sharp and shockingly restrained. Pancaked in heavy old man make-up, he manages to exude mischief and good humor. You can't really begrudge those scene-stealing bits in which he plays cupid to his quarrelsome son and the adorable hat check girl who sings like an angel.

Robert Cummings' down-to-earth likability and comic timing earn him points. Durbin and Laughton frenetically dance the conga, and Durbin sings ""Clavelitos,"" ""When I Sing,"" and Antonn Dvork's ""Goin' Home."" It's bliss, brother, bliss.

Bonus stuff for IT STARTED WITH EVE: Dammit, none

- CAN'T HELP SINGING (1944)

There's a kid in this film who persists in twisting his hair, and when his aggravated mother finally asks him why he twists his hair, his response is ""It's fun for my fingers."" I don't know why, but that really made me laugh. CAN'T HELP SINGING, a high-spirited western musical, happens to be Deanna's only Technicolor film. It plonks her in the wild American frontier, gives her the chance to belt out songs authored by Jerome Kern. What's it about? In the early days of the California Gold Rush, a senator's pampered daughter abandons her life of ease to chase a handsome cavalry lieutenant (David Bruce) all the way to distant Old California. En route she runs into an assortment of bounders and cheats, including a pair of foreign cads who believe that her wooden chest is full of gold. She reluctantly partners up with a roguish cardsharp (Robert Paige) as they hook up with a wagon train whose passengers seek miles and miles of ""Elbow Room"" (as a chorus of wagon train folk belt out in that one song).

Deanna is in fine form and looks really lovely in Technicolor. Some genial chuckles, as well, and plenty of songs, my favorites of which are the title track (the bath reprise) and the big spectacle ""Californi-I-Ay."" Heck, I was even amused by the strains of ""Ochi chyornye"" that serve as the theme music to them two bumbling foreign opportunists (played to the hilt by Akim Tamiroff and Leonid Kinskey). The laugh-out-loud ending ties a nice bow on the thing.

- LADY ON A TRAIN (1945)

San Francisco dbutante Nikki Collins (Durbin), on a train ride to New York for the holidays, glances out her window and witnesses a violent murder. With the police dismissing her report, Nikki decides to play amateur detective and enlists the awkward aid of a mystery writer (David Bruce again). LADY ON A TRAIN falls under the rare umbrella of the screwball noir and marks somewhat of a departure from the musical genre for Durbin. You can tell this vehicle was meant to glamourize her. Deanna undergoes several slick costume (and even hairstyle) changes.

I thoroughly enjoyed this breezy whodunit. We learn early on that Nikki Collins is fascinated with lurid mystery novels, and so we're not too startled when she goes daft with her snooping, to the extent that the press eventually labels her as the ""crime pin-up girl of the year."" Deanna Durbin effortlessly dominates the screen. She keeps things light. The film showcases her in one comedic set piece after another. Call me an old-timer but I couldn't help but grin big during that sequence in the newsreel theater as Deanna, undeterred by all the shussing, simply won't stop pestering David Bruce. And, looking back, we should've been wise to the fate of those bloodstained slippers.

It helps that the story takes place on Christmas eve. This softens the brutal edges of the murder mystery. During her many scrapes, Deanna poses as a torch singer at a lively circus nightclub, which allows her to croon ""Night and Day"" in sultry fashion and be playful with ""Give Me A Little Kiss."" She also gets on the phone and delivers a warm rendition of ""silent Night."" You didn't think the production big wigs would pass up a chance for Deanna to sing, did you?

Poor David Bruce, the hapless hero. His mystery novelist, thru the course of the narrative, gets beat up a lot and made the butt of several gags. And once Deanna enters the picture, it's a cinch that his engagement to a snobbish model is doomed to breakup. To be honest, I was sort of rooting for the (for once) non-threatening Dan Duryea to get a shot at Deanna. He plays one of the greedy family members of the murder victim. This family is scrambling hard to keep the family fortune strictly inhouse. Familiar character actors abound, from Ralph Bellamy to William Frawley to the always harried Edward Everett Horton. George Coulouris, as the shady circus club manager, matches (and predates) Blofeld in the kitty stroking department.

629751,4,6303328164,"Winnipeg,Canada's own Deanna Durbin is in the spotlight here in this six film-fest from Universal studios. However it is a curious mixture of both good and bad films with two of my faves The Amazing Mrs. Holiday and Three Smart Girls Grow Up,particularly noticeable due to their absence. Let us hope Universal comes clean with the rest of her entries sometime in the future. In the meantime we must ""relish"" what little dribs and drabs the big boys throw at us,mustn't we?
""Three Smart Girls""(released in Dec/36) was Deanna's major debut on screen and she,as they say,murdered them at the box office. Her major attributes were her freshness,her utterly disarming charm and of course that angelic voice. She could sing the NYC telephone book and it would have sounded beautiful. All the fabulous attributes that made her a star are here in spades for all to see,as we literally see a star born before our amazed eyes. The plot is relatively simple. Three girls who live with their mother in Switzerland,plot to get back their bon vivant of a father,engaged to be married to a boor of a social climber,in New York. It co-starred Mischa Auer,Charles Winninger,Nan Grey and a very young Ray Milland,among others. Five stars.
""Something in the Wind""(released in July/47)has Deanna as a female disc jockey by the name of Mary Collins(the camera really makes hay with her opening number perched on a desk. Maybe she should have been a desk jockey?).It seems the recently deceased owner of the radio station has left a substantial sum to a Ms. Collins;Deanna's aunt(who she lives with),not her. His grandson who now runs the station is none too happy about the situation and mistakenly thinks Deanna is the beneficiary. Alot of funny mistaken circumstances come out this film until it winds down to its conclusion. It co-stars Donald O'Connor,Jean Adair and Charles Winninger,among others. Three and a half stars.
""First Love""(released Nov/39)has Deanna as an unwanted orphan who is graduating from school and leaving to join a rich,snobby family who really have little or no interest in her. The daughter of the family she bunks with is in love with a handsome lad who,in the end,is of course the one Deanna will fall in love with and win. A terribly stodgy and see through plot. It co stars a young Robert Stack as her love interest and Leatrice Joy,among others. Two and a half stars.
""It Started with Eve""(released Sept/41)has Deanna working in a department store and roped in by a distraught young man,whose father lies deathly ill,to sub for his girlfriend who is not there. Well surprise,surprise,next morning pops makes a miraculous recovery and he is asking to see his sons girl! The film boasts a stellar cast including Robert(Bob)Cummings,Charles Laughton and Guy Kibbee,among others. A charmer of a film,four stars.
""Can't Help But Singing""(released Dec/44)stars Deanna as a spoiled daughter of a  wealthy US senator set in the 1800s. He disapproves of her beau in the cavalry and she heads west to find him. In the end she falls in love with someone completely different. Another lame,see through and inane plot. It was her Technicolour debut but one of her worst films. Even Kern and Harburg couldn't help in the musical department. Two stars.
""Lady on a Train""(released Aug/45)has Deanna coming into Grand Central Station and witnessing a nasty murder in a window. She is a crime devotee',so her story goes unheeded with the cops. But she pokes around until she's deeply involved in this comedy/film noir. It co stars William Frawley,Ralph Bellamy,Allen Jenkins and the always delightful Edward Everett Horton. Three and a half to four stars.
Despite the ratings,good or bad,that I give each film here,it is always Deanna's vocals that continue to impress through out this uneven menagerie of flickers. She was as comfortable warbling a bit from an opera or swinging with a big band. The trouble is with some of these flicks,and what perturbed Deanna herself in real life,is that they became far too formulaic. In fact there are quite a few of her efforts that did NOT need her vocal talents at all and Lady on a Train is a great example. How many musical film noirs do you know of? Her vocal talents could have been put aside as her singing was superfluous to the plot,as good as they always were. Deanna didn't need to be always singing in EVERY film. You will hear that the public clamoured for her singing and wouldn't have liked it any differently. What a load of studio rubbish. Deanna could really act,I mean REALLY act. Like so many other actors who could sing,like Carmen Miranda,they were put into the same singing mold ,but unfortunately had studios who never could think past the next dollar sign. Given the chance,Carmen could ACT beautifully also. Like Deanna she was also multi talented,but the vocals and the image their respective studios created and coveted of their stars wouldn't let them do anything else. In today's lingo,they couldn't think outside the box.
That aside,we are lucky to have these films around to view and discuss. I just hope the studio will offer up more Durbin bon mots in the future. The world has largely forgotten about this HUGE talent and it needs to be brought up to speed for a new generation to fall in love with her all over again.
Technically the films are near their original a/r(full screen)and some look better than others. Three Smart Girls is the worst,as this print is one Universal has been using ever since the VHS days. C'mon Univeral,let's strike a new print and show us how good this film really looks. There are two discs here and both are the DDD's;dreaded double-sided discs,so beware of any potential scuffing and scratching that could occur. There are two films on one side and one on the other.
In conclusion,I highly recommend this set but it is really a mixed bag of films Universal has picked for us to view. They could have done better,but hey it is,after all,Deanna Durbin. I will end this review by doing something I don't usually do,and for which I apologize;a little bit of chest thumping. I have collected a few autographs of stars over the years,but Deanna Durbin is the ONLY one I have ever obtained that came directly from the star herself and from that era in film making. I will always proudly display it on my wall. She even typed me back a brief response to my letter(by using one finger yet!).I will end this review by using the exact words,a paraphrase of sorts from one of her famous songs,I used in the ending to MY letter to her those many,many years ago.

629752,5,6303328164,"I purchased of all these on VHS years ago and was pleasantly surprised when they came out on DVD so I could get rid of the VHS tapes. This set has my 3 favorite Deanna Durbin films: Three Smart Girls, Something in the Wind, and It Started With Eve. Unfortunately it has one of my least favorite as well: Can't Help Singing.
1st the Good.
Three Smart Girls is an excellent example of Deanna's talent in singing at such a young age. She plays a girl who's father is about to remarry. Her and her 2 sisters decide to go and visit him to stop this wedding which sets off a series of amusing events.
Something in the Wind is about a radio host who, in a case of mistaken identity, is kidnapped by a rich and powerful family.  The lead male's grandfather just passed away and left in his will an order to continue payments to a woman with the same name as the radio host. The family wants to buy her off before she creates a scandal and potentially ruins the grandson's upcoming nuptials.  The grandson's distant cousin, played by Donald O'Connor, is in love with his cousin's fiancee and wants Deanna to play along and demand outrageous things for her staying silent.
It Started With Eve is my favorite Deanna film. A rich man is dying, his son returns from Mexico with his fiancee to see him before he dies. The father wants to meet the fiancee but the son dropped her and her mother off at a hotel before visiting his father. When he returns to the hotel he can't find his fiancee and decides he doesn't have much time so he pays a coat check girl, Deanna, to pretend to be his fiancee to make his father happy. His father likes her then he gets over his illness the next day. That's when the fun begins.
Can't Help Singing is one of the worst Deanna movie. She is the daughter of a US Senator in the old West who tries to follow her beau across the country to California.
Lady on a Train is somewhat of a parody of film noir. Deanna witnesses a murder while passing some windows on a train. She calls the cops but they think she has an overactive imagination because they see her reading a murder/mystery novel.  She realizes who the victim is by seeing his face somewhere. Visits the reading of his will and mistaken as his nightclub singing mistress, who inherits everything. Its pretty good for not being her typical upbeat goofy comedy.
First Love is a Cinderella type story. Deanna plays a girl who moves in with her rich cousins. Her female cousin is very snobby and doesn't want her around. Deanna meets a rich boy, played by Robert Stack (Unsolved Mysteries), and falls for him but her cousin keeps trying to get in her way. She escapes, goes to a ball, sings, gets caught and you can probably guess what happens next.",1321315200,,2724,4.379446640316205
629753,5,6303328164,"If you have a longing to hear the splendid, rich, sweet voice of Deanna Durbin again, you'll want to make sure you have this pack which includes some of her most popular hits.

Frankly, it's worth having for CAN'T HELP SINGING (her only Technicolor musical), LADY ON A TRAIN and IT STARTED WITH EVE. The rest are icing on the cake.

Deanna Durbin had a refreshing screen personality and a sincere way as an actress, so that she makes it a pleasure whenever she bursts into song. And when the songs are by Jerome Kern (as in CAN'T HELP SINGING) what more could you want?

I know I'm preaching to the choir. You wouldn't be reading this review if you weren't already a Deanna Durbin fan. So do yourself a favor and spend a few bucks on this delightful collection, guaranteed to make your heart sing along with Deanna at her loveliest.

When she and Robert Paige join forces to sing in adjoining outdoor tubs among the Techicolor soap bubbles for a scene in CAN'T HELP SINGING, you'll be witnessing one of the most joyous mnoments in this beautifully mounted musical. Likewise, when she's subbing for a nightclub singer in LADY ON A TRAIN and gives forth with a sensational version of ""Night and Day,"" you'll be glad you took my advice.

629810,5,6303328164,"Now, despite my 5-star rating for the ""Deanna Durbin Sweetheart Pack"", allow me one small criticism...Someone needs to make a film documentary about this unfairly forgotten star! Yes, she is still alive, at this writing (a feisty 88!), and still continues her 60-year exile from the United States and the film industry, but in the 'rediscovery' of her 21 exquisite films of the 1930s and 1940s, her importance needs to be acknowledged, to a new generation. This remarkable woman actually 'saved' Universal Pictures, was a more popular star in her time than Judy Garland, won a special 'juvenile' Oscar in 1938, and was a personal favorite of FDR, Churchill, AND Mussolini, as well as Anne Frank. Blessed with a rich, mature Soprano singing voice that was a bit disconcerting when she was a teen (Walt Disney turned her down, at 14, as the voice of 'Snow White' because she sounded too old), she inspired MGM to hire Kathryn Grayson, Ann Blyth, and Jane Powell, and was, at 21, the highest-paid woman in America, and the world's highest-paid actress.

These facts should be shared, to better appreciate the truly unique appeal of Deanna Durbin!

The ""Deanna Durbin Sweetheart Pack"" offers six memorable films:

""Three Smart Girls"" (1936): 14-year-old Deanna's feature debut, after an MGM short with Judy Garland (the studio unintentionally let Durbin's contract expire, and Universal grabbed her). She's teamed with Nan Gray and Barbara Read, as young sisters who journey to America to break up father Charles Winninger's impending nuptials to golddigger Binnie Barnes. The older sisters find romance (Barbara with dashing young Ray Milland, also on a fast track to stardom), but the film is Deanna's, all the way, with dazzling Durbin songs, and a satisfying, tear-inducing finale... (5 stars, out of 5).

""Something In the Wind"" (1947): Nearing the end of her brief career, 25-year-old Deanna in a very funny tale of mistaken identity, accused of being a late millionaire's 'kept' woman! Her romantic lead is John Dall (who she sings a couple of slightly naughty ballads to), but the real fun is 21-year-old Donald O'Connor, just returned from wartime service, who displays the boundless energy and dancing skills that would serve him so well in 1952's ""Singing in the Rain"" (he even performs an early 'warm-up' for the ""Make 'em Laugh"" showstopper)...and watch for Deanna and Donald's number with the singing Williams Brothers, including a young Andy Williams! (5 stars, out of 5)

""First Love"" (1939): Best-known as the film where 17-year-old Deanna gets her first screen kiss (from young Robert Stack!), this delightful 'Cinderella' send-up also has elements of ""My Man Godfrey"" including wonderful Eugene Pallette, again cast as an exasperated father; the ball scene is truly magical, and would influence the Maria/Tony dance in ""West Side Story"", over 20 years later. A treasure! (5 stars, out of 5)

""It Started with Eve"" (1941): The crown jewel of the collection, one of the screen's great comedies. Millionaire financier Charles Laughton, on his deathbed, demands to be introduced to son Robert Cummings' fiance; when Cummings can't find her, he recruits hat check girl Deanna to 'play' her, assuming his father will die, never knowing the ruse. But Deanna's sweetness and charm saves the old man's life, and things get complicated! A fabulous film; Laughton, at his peak (and just 41), gives his septuagenarian character a feisty charm without overplaying him; his moments with Deanna are simply perfect (and their wild rumba scene is the film highlight!)...(5 1/2 stars, out of 5)

""Can't Help Singing"" (1944): Best-remembered as Deanna's only color film, this 'Gold Rush' era western is beautiful to look at, with spectacular location footage at California and Utah national parks, and features songs by Jerome Kern and E. Y. Harburg (which Deanna does magnificently), but the story is a bit thin and streched, Robert Paige isn't the most charismatic of her leading men (and his costumes are a bit silly), and overall, the film needs a ""Harvey Girls"" bounce that it doesn't quite achieve...(3 1/2 stars, out of five)

""Lady on a Train"" (1945): A film noir comedy-drama-musical, created, in part, from Deanna's request for more 'adult' roles...finishing a cross-country Christmas train trip to New York City, Deanna witnesses a murder from her window, but naturally, nobody believes her! The victim turns out to be a secluded, legendary industralist (shades of ""Citizen Kane""), whose whole family hated him. Deanna decides to pose as his nightclub singer mistress, to find the killer, as the body count rises. A first-rate cast, including Ralph Bellamy, Edward Everett Horton, Dan Duryea, Allen Jenkins, William Frawley, and, as her leading man, the 'cad' of ""Can't Help Singing"", David Bruce, can't disguise the flimsy story and plotholes; you'll figure out who the killer is within ten minutes, guaranteed! Still, the film is quite funny, and Deanna sings some great tunes, including ""Silent Night"", and Cole Porter's ""Night and Day""...(4 stars, out of five)

629816,4,6303328164,"Deanna Durbin was a very popular musical comedy star in the late thirties and throughout the forties, particularly in England. A trained singer of some renown with aspirations to opera, she was one of only a few adolescent stars who made a very successful transition to adulthood on the screen. For those who know and like her, this collection will need no recommendation but for those who might be discovering Deanna, it may be worth noting that her singing leans towards the operetta style so if you abhor that genre, you may not like the music. In many of her films, she gave renditions of pop songs (for example, ""Night and Day"", no less, in ""Lady on a Train"") and while technically her performances are faultless, her voice sometimes is not ideally suited to the contemporary music. Having said that, this collection contains an excellent sample of her features, some good, some so-so and all with individual moments of undoubted pleasure.

""Three Smart Girls"" was Durbin's feature film debut, released in 1936, and an important film for Universal Studios because its profits staved off bankruptcy. Durbin plays the youngest of 3 sisters whose meddling reunites her separated parents. This is the least interesting film in the set mainly because of the corny story but Durbin' star quality is obvious and it launched her spectacular rise to fame.

By 1939, every Durbin film was an event and a goldmine for Universal. ""First Love"" is Cinderella, 1939 style, with a fine screwball family surrounding the star. ""Cinderella"" is a story which has been filmed with variations a million times but this straight working of the fairy story is one of the best. One of the highlights is Eugene Pallette's revenge on his ghastly family. Durbin received her first screen kiss from Robert Stack and this was world news at the time.

For 1941, ""It Started with Eve"" was Durbin's first genuine adult part and it might be the best film in the set. A fine comedy, Charles Laughton stars as a rich millionaire who wishes to meet his future daughter-in-law before he dies. Robert Cummings plays his son who drags hat check girl Durbin off the street to replace his absent girlfriend. The ensuing plot is predictable but Laughton is superb in one of his few comedies and there is a poignant moment in a restaurant when Durbin breaks down and cries which is beautifully done and very moving. She and Laughton have real rapport.

""Can't Help Singing"", released in 1944, is a period western, maybe a little like ""Oklahoma"". Filmed in beautiful Technicolor (preserved well in the print), Durbin, with tongue firmly in cheek, is very entertaining as a determined young lady who defies her father and travels west to marry her sweetheart. Part of her showcase is that in every scene she wears a different coiffure and dress, completely absurd in the context of the story and reaching hilarious proportions when she turns up in two outfits for the finale. There is a story that Durbin herself could not decide which dress she preferred and decided to wear both! The songs, written by Jerome Kern, are superb and the score maybe the best of all the films in the set. ""More and More"" and ""Any Moment Now"" are magnificently presented.  Robert Paige, a fine robust star of Broadway, is one of the best leading men she ever had.

""Lady on a Train"", based on a Leslie Charteris story, is an entertaining comedy thriller with Durbin playing a meddling miss who witnesses a murder and helps find the killer.  In this one, Durbin is heavily  made up, often dressed like a standard Hollywood glamour girl with endless close-ups particularly when she sings and a new costume and hairstyle for almost every scene. It is fairly ludicrous because at times she looks like the girl next door playing dress up. She gives a memorable rendition of ""Silent Night"". The film has an excellent supporting cast and the plot is entertaining. The film also has a very funny ending.

""Something in the Wind"", released in 1947 as Durbin's career was coming to an end, is also an entertaining comedy. The premise is amusing - a rich family try to pay off a girl who they think was the mistress of their deceased grandfather. The film, as depicted in the trailer included in the package, tries to promote a new contemporary singing style for Durbin but in fact this was mere marketing as Durbin had sung ""sexy' before. Her rendition of ""You wanna keep your baby looking good"" is a lot of fun. The film's glaring negative, however, is that John Dall plays Durbin's romantic partner and is hopeless. Dall has the romantic aura and light touch of a brick. Catch him in Hitchcock's ""Rope"" and you will get the idea - a very serious actor. Donald O'Connor appears too and does a clever acrobatic number.

The prints of the film are really good, the only really mediocre one being ""Three Smart Girls"". There are no extras other than a few trailers and a featurette for ""Wind"" which plays the songs from the film. The packaging is ordinary too because these are double sided disks and it is always hard to find which film is where. On the debit side, the set is cheap so it is therefore very good value.",1258243200,2,5144,4.72463768115942
629817,4,6303328164,"Deanna Durbin is a spectacular singing sensation from the North of the border, from Winnipeg, Manitoba. She broke into Hollywood at a young age of 15, with a gift of lovely operatic voice that helped her early career in Hollywood. In 1938 she was honored with Mickey Rooney with Special Academy Award. The Academy cited the award ""for bringing to the screen the spirit and personification of youth."" Deanna had several issues with MGM/Universal studios and complained that her image was not properly rewarded with better roles as she matured from a little girl into adulthood. Professionally, at a certain level, Deanna was in competition with Judy Garland. In some of her later interviews she referred to Deanna Durbin in third person (that was her stage name). She retired from her movie career at a young age of 27 and lived in seclusion in Paris. She is immortalized in the Hollywood walk of fame and also at the Grumman Chinese theater (foot and hand prints) in Hollywood, California. Joe Pasternak who produced many of her early movies spoke very highly her talents. After Great Depression of 1929, Hollywood became unkind to Wall Street executives, and movie studios made several movies that poked at their shallow life styles. Some of Deanna's movies were made at this time (1930s) and shows like, First Love, and It started with eve fall in this category.

1. Three Smart Girls

The Sisters - A family story (three stars)
This story is about three little sisters; Penny Craig (Deanna Durbin), Joan Craig (Nan Grey), and Kay Craig (Helen Parrish) fighting over the boys they love, and how it all comes together at the end. You may need a score card for this. When Penny finds that her sister Kay is interested in the fiance of Joan, she asks her pianist friend Harry Loren (Robert Cummings) to romance Kay, but it backfires and he likes to romance Joan. Outraged Penny insults him and throws him out. Mrs. Craig (Nella Walker) misunderstands this episode and believes that her little girl Penny is jealous and has fallen in love with an older man. She hatches a plan to separate Penny from seeing Harry at the music school, and asks her stockbroker-husband Judson Craig (Charles Winniger) for help. Penny in the mean time expects Harry and Joan, and Kay and Richard to bond in love. When Penny and Kay fight over Richard, Judson is forced to remove himself from his business meetings for a day and get involved with his daughters affairs. Then he leads Joan and Harry, and then Kay and Richard to the altar, while Penny and the whole family beam with happiness. Deanna is superb as a little girl, and she was only 15 when she made this film

2. Something in the wind

The family greed (two stars)
Mary Collins (Deanna Durbin) works for a radio station owned by a wealthy family as singing disc jockey. Donald Reed (John Dall), the owner mistakenly thinks that Mary is the mistress of his recently deceased grandfather Henry Reed, and the snobbish Donald offers her a cash settlement if she refutes any claims against the family estate, obviously Mary becomes angry. Later Mary is abducted from the radio station into the Reed family home and persuade her not cause harm to the family name, and Mary agrees if they pay her a million dollar to support her and ""her child"" by Henry Reed. When Mary gets the check, her aunt Mary (Jean Adair) returns the check to Read family and tells her that it is against her family principles. Later and Donald reunite on a television show. This movie has some scandals and tricks which shows Deanna Durbin more as a cunning young lady than her other roles where she is very principled.

3. First Love

A Fine Romance (three stars)
Considerable publicity surrounded the release of this movie in which the young Robert Stack gave the 18 year old Deanna her first on-screen kiss. Constance Harding (Deanna Durbin) is treated unfairly by her adopted family of James Clinton (Eugene Pallette), especially her sister Barbara Clinton (Helen Parrish), and her mother Grace Clinton (Leatrice Joy). James is a busy Wall Street executive and does not notice the problems at home, but his servants at home are well aware of the problem and needless to say they are behind young Constance every step of the way. Barbara is in love with a young man from a wealthy family named Ted Drake (Robert Stack). Barbara tries very hard so that he loves her but circumstance lead him to Constance, with a lot of help from the staff at the household and of course due diligence of James Clinton. At the end young Ted sees the light and falls in love with charming singing sensation Constance.  As you must have guessed that there are a lot of mishaps and screwball comedy before this ever happens.

4. It started with eve

Who is in love with whom? (Four stars)
This is a romantic comedy-drama in which the man thinks that he is in love with a woman and wants to be married to her, but the man's father wants his son marry another girl. Does this sound confusing? Perhaps not if you see the movie; it is hilarious, and Deana is absolutely wonderful in this screwball slapstick.

Billionaire Jonathan Reynolds (Charles Laughton) is terminally ill and would like to meet the fiance of his only son Johnny Reynolds (Robert Cummings). When Johnny couldn't find his fiance Gloria Pennington (Margaret Tallichet) at her hotel, desperately, he asks the hat-check girl Anne Terry (Deanna Durbin) to pretend to be Gloria. She reluctantly agrees, and meets his ""dying"" father, and finds herself the favorite fiance of his son. As his father gets better he develops more interest to see his future daughter-in-law rather his son, and this makes her to stay at their house. As the movie progresses things get hilarious and confusion surrounds for Reynolds family. In the meantime, Gloria leaves Johnny and Johnny falls in love with Anne. The story runs though very funny and sometimes embarrassing situations for Johnny, Anne and Jonathan. I like the scenes when Johnny runs to the train station when Anne tries to go back to her home town in Ohio, and how Jonathan tries to smoke a cigar when he is strictly forbidden by his personal physician and his caretaker.

5. Can't help singing

Can't help falling in love (three stars)
This is her only film in Technicolor. Caroline Frost (Deanna Durbin), the only daughter of Senator Martin Frost (Ray Collins) is in love with a soldier named Lieutenant Robert Latham (David Bruce) which displeases her father. When he sends Robert away to California during the Gold rush era, Caroline runs away from home to meet him in Sonora, California. When her father reports Caroline missing and announces a $5,000 reward for the safe return of his daughter. On her way to California Caroline is conned by pranksters and thieves, and loses all her money. She goes in search of her money and finds that a gambler named Lawlor (Robert Page) has her money, she demands her money and he recognizes Caroline as the missing senator's daughter and threatens to turn her in for the reward, until she offers him $10,000 to take her to California. Caroline promises (lies to) him that he will be paid by her wealthy fiance named Jake Carstairs. When they arrive in California, she meets Carstairs, and asks him to play along with the hoax, and pretend that he is her fianc. Complications arise when Carstairs' wife arrives and accuses her husband of having an affair. In the confusion, Robert arrives, calling out for his fiance. A fistfight between Robert and Lawlor ensues because Lawlor believes that Caroline has a third suitor. Finally the truth comes out, and Lawlor and Caroline resume their romance with a happy ending.

6. Lady on a train

Lady on a Train is a Thriller (Five stars)
This is a mystery movie in which Deanna assumes a sophisticated film persona. Nikki Collins (Deanna Durbin) witnesses a murder during her train trip New York City and sets to investigate that when the local police become uncooperative. After viewing a news report, she learns that Joseah Waring, a shipping magnate died accidentally while decorating a Christmas tree at his Long Island estate. When Nikki goes to investigate his death on his property, Arnold Waring (Dan Duryea), Joseah's nephew finds her and mistakes for Margo Martin, a nightclub singer and Joseah's fiance. During her stay at the estate she finds several incriminating evidences such as the bloody slippers of Joseah, and a possible motive for murder since Joseah disinherits his family and leaves his fortune to Margo Martin.

Nikki goes to meet the real Margo Martin (Deanna Durbin), but Arnold Waring finds her in the night club and locks her up in a room, and a little later she is rescued by mystery writer Wayne Morgan (David Bruce), at the cost of his engagement to fiance, Joyce Williams (Patricia Morison). Nikki suspects that Arnold is the murderer but she later finds out that Jonathan Waring (Ralph Bellamy), Arnold's older brother is the psychopathic killer. This realization occurs when she is alone with Jonathan in the same room in which Joseah was killed. Jonathan confides to Nikki that he will kill her, and frame his brother Arnold for her murder. Finally Jonathan is arrested by the local police, and Nikki and Wayne fall in love and tie the knot.

This DVD has six movies of one of the legends of Hollywood; I would say it is a steal if you look at the price of this DVD: Highly recommended

This pack contains two of our favorite Durbin movies, IT STARTED WITH EVE and SOMETHING IN THE WIND. Those alone are worth the price--the others are an added bonus. The stories have been very adequately reviewed by others, so I won't bother, but I will add my disappointments with the set. These are double sided disks and those drive me crazy. The print on the disks is very small and it can be tricky to know which movie is on which disk. Also, the cover does not snap closed or have a slip cover, so it can flop open if not handled carefully. No complaints about the movies, just the design and packaging!",1253577600,,760,4.397163120567376

THEN I FOUND A ""VIDEO COMPANY"" WHICH OFFERED SEVERAL OF HER FILMS ON ""VHS"" BUT I DECLINED TO BUY THEM. THEN IN 2004 I CAME ACROSS THE ""SWEETHEART PACK"" CONTAINING SIX OF HER BELOVED FILMS AND I LOVED IT. MY FAVORITE FILM IN THE COLLECTION IS: ""SOMETHING IN THE WIND"". I REALLY LIKED HOW MARY WOULD NOT ALLOW DONALD TO PUSH HER AROUND WITH ALL OF HIS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND I REALLY ENJOYED HOW SHE HELPED DONALD'S COUSIN GET HIS FIANCEE AWAY FROM HIM, WHICH WAS VERY COMICAL ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY WENT TO THE FASHION SHOW AND SHE HAD HIS WALLET, TEASING HIM WITH IT. I ALSO LIKE THE WAY SHE STOOD UP TO DONALD'S GRANDMOTHER WHEN SHE TRIED TO GET HER OUT OF HIS LIFE. AND I LOVED THAT SONG SHE SING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE WHILE SHE IS SITTING ON TOP OF THE DESK DURING HER RADIO PROGRAM. I DO WISH THE TITLE SONG: ""SOMETHING IN THE WIND"" HAD HIT ""THE HIT PARADE"". IF IT DID, I HAVEN'T FOUND IT. BUT THE WHOLE COLLECTION IS FANTASTIC. SO I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS COLLECTION TO ANYONE WHO LOVE ROMANTIC FILMS. AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS AS A GIFT TOO. I HOPE EVERYONE WHO READS THIS BUY THIS COLLECTION. I THINK I'LL GO AND WATCH ""SOMETHING IN THE WIND"".

Three smart girls is just some much fun to watch...and it's wonderful to figure out that The Parent Trap must have been based on it (except three sisters vs twins)...but the basic premise is the same...and if you notice the young bride and her mother---yah, it's the same story, just told with a twist.

Something in the Wind was fun too, and really, I liked them all except for ""Can't Help Singing,"" which was okay, but not as much fun as the others.  Oh--and Durbin was a singer...so all of them have musical numbers and most of them are more operatic than anything else.  Though '...wind' does have some more upbeat songs.

629867,4,6303328164,"When the MGM studio dropped their option to extend a contract for young soprano Deanna Durbin, rival studio Universal snapped her up and starred her in THREE SMART GIRLS (1936).  The film was a huge success which helped reverse the financial losses of the studio, and established Deanna Durbin as a bright new movie musical star.

Deanna plays enterprising little Penny Craig.  When she learns that her divorced, New York-based father (Charles Winninger) is about to marry a younger woman (Binnie Barnes), Penny and her two older sisters (Nan Grey and Barbara Read) set off to derail his plans--and hopefully arrange a tearful reunion for their parents.

Originally meant as a vehicle for blonde comedienne Binnie Barnes, THREE SMART GIRLS instead became re-tooled as a showcase for 13 year old soprano Deanna Durbin after studio execs became charmed by her infectious screen persona.  Her role of Penny was expanded, and though she never received top billing in the cast, it became all too clear that it was Durbin who truly carried this picture.  Deanna gets to sing ""My Heart is Singing"", ""Il bacio"", and ""Someone to Care for Me"".

The movie's incredible worldwide success ensured that Deanna would reprise her role of Penny Craig for two lovely sequels - ""Three Smart Girls Grow Up"" (1939), and ""Hers to Hold"" (1943).",1213574400,3,1321,4.9772727272727275
629905,5,6303328164,"Deanna Durbin was a big star for Paramount in the 1940s. She began as a child star; her first ever film was Every Sunday with Judy Garland. Durbin quickly became a star with her first film Three Smart Girls. From there, she made plenty of movies, most of them lighthearted with plenty of chances to show off her voice. Then, she left the business altogether and retired to France where she still lives today. An excellent actress and a real-charmer, Durbin still has quite a following today, although the general public has never heard of her. Here is your chance to discover the vibrance of a beautiful star with movies appropriate for any age.

In Three Smart Girls, three young girls hear the news that their father (Charles Winninger) is going to be re-married, and it is a shame too because their mother (Nella Walker) still loves him. The three girls, Joan (Nan Grey), Kay (Barbara Read), and Penny (Durbin) make a plan to break up their father's engagement and set him back up with their mother. They enlist the help of Michael Stuart (Ray Milland), Bill Evans (John King), and Count Arisztid (Mischa Auer) which heeds some mixed up results. This is the first feature film with Durbin, and it is no wonder she soon became a big star. The movie showcases her singing talents with several different numbers ranging from operatic to popular. Her sweet smile and knack for carrying out schemes are exhibited at full force. She is flanked by two beautiful but less charming actresses whose careers never really took off. Winninger is especially good in his part as the father; He is really lovable.

Durbin stars in First Love, her own version of Cinderella. She plays a sweet, innocent, and friendly orphan named Connie who goes to live with her spoiled socialite cousin Barbara (Helen Parrish) when she graduates from an all girl's school. She wins over the staff with her well-trained singing voice and energy who encourage her to break her cousin's rigid rules and have a little fun. However, Barbara constantly tries to guilt Connie into doing things for her, such as feigning sick to stall her friends so she can sleep in. On this escapade, Connie runs into the guy everyone seems to love (Robert Stack) who becomes fascinated with the mysterious Connie. Later, they meet again when the staff helps Connie go to a party despite Barbara's efforts to detain her. There, Connie is a sensation, singing and dancing all night with a love-struck Ted. However, after being advised to leave by midnight to avoid running into Barbara and her mother, she leaves in a hurry leaving an enchanted Ted with only a shoe to remember her by. It is strange how much Durbin and Parrish look alike, which really compliments the film. However, the two couldn't be more different. They make the trite but true story of Cinderella come to life in a way different enough not to bore. The music in this film is very much like an operetta, and one cannot deny Durbin's talent in this type of singing. This film was presented as a stepping stone to allow her to grow up on the screen, which happened very slowly.

It Started With Eve is the best film on this disk. When a man (Robert Cummings) visits his dying father (Charles Laughton), he is requested to bring his fianc&eacute;e for his father to meet for the first time before he passes away. The man is beside himself because he cannot find Gloria, his fianc&eacute;e, who went out shopping with her mother. Instead, he pays a girl (Durbin) who works at the hotel to pose as his fianc&eacute;e for the night, since his father will never know the difference. She takes the job so that she can go visit her family in Ohio with the money. However, the girl's wholesome looks and vibrant personality charm the old man and he makes a full recovery, leaving the man with an interesting situation. This film is very funny throughout. The charade is the most obviously humorous part, but other minor parts evoke laughter as well. The newspapermen are funny, Laughton's desire for a cigar is funny, and Durbin's tenacity when it comes to music is funny. She is outstanding. She is realistic and mature, making her character quite believable despite the hair-brained situation. It makes it easy to understand why the old man would like her so much. She is sweet and sincere, a ""good girl,"" but by no means an annoying one. She is also playful and likeably heartbreaking at times. Laughton is almost unrecognizable at times in his old man makeup. He plays the amusing sick man to the hilt in a way reminiscent of Lionel Barrymore. He is subtlety cute and funny at the same time, and obviously very sensitive but honest underneath the playful exterior. Cummings has good chemistry with Durbin and is effective in his emotional scenes. However, he takes a backseat to the other stars. The music in Durbin's films is almost as important as the story. She sings three in this film. The first is ""When I Sing"" which sounds startlingly familiar to the ""Once Upon a Dream"" song from Sleeping Beauty. The process of preparing for the song is quite funny. The second song is a jumpy Spanish number. It shows off Durbin's many talents including that of vocal, piano, and energetic presence. The last song is ""Goin' Home,"" a dreamy weepy song that has too obviously been dubbed.

Can't Help Singing is the only color Durbin film so it is a curiosity in and of itself. The story is very much like the classic It Happened One Night only it is set during the California gold rush. It concerns a wealthy girl whose family disapproves of her engagement to a soldier. She runs away from home to meet up with him but on the way meets another poorer man who sweeps her off her feet. This version is not done as slickly as the 1934 original, but it is highly entertaining. There are plenty of elements in this film that make it seem like a stage production. The large choral numbers are grand and static and the humor is similar to the screwball comedy style incorperated in early musicals. In fact, the humor helps to pull the dull parts out of the mud to regain the fluidity. Durbin is very beautiful in color although she wears a lot of makeup and her hair is very blonde. She is slightly more mature than in her earlier comedy films but she fits the part well and carries the show.

Lady on a Train revolves around a girl (Durbin) who happens to witness what looks like a murder outside of her train window. However, the girl was reading a murder mystery novel on the train, and one suspects that her accusations may be the result of an active imagination. The police suspect the same thing, which forces her to go to the only other source of help she knows, the author of the murder mystery novel. This film is much more comical than thrilling fueled by the girl's eccentricity, but it is no less entertaining. Durbin is stunningly beautiful in this film. Her blonde hair shines in the soft lighting and she is obviously more grown up than in most of her films. She is still impulsive and charming, but her hair-brained schemes are executed with a subtle maturity. For once, Durbin looks like a gorgeous glamour girl of the era instead of a child star. The songs in this film are unusual for a Durbin film. Most of her songs in other films are quite juvenile like Judy Garland's, but those in this film are ones you might expect any adult to sing in a film. ""Silent Night"" is a song that is sung over a telephone. It is filed in soft lighting with Durbin's hair cascading over the bed like the glamorous Rita Hayworth. Although it is beautifully sung, the transition from dialogue to song is not very smooth. The next song is by far the best even though the title would suggest it is silly. ""Gimmie A Little Kiss, Will You Huh?"" is sung with the suggestiveness of a Marilyn Monroe song. The song is languid and underplayed. Needless to say, it is quite unlike anything one might expect from Durbin, but she does it so well, one wonders why these types of songs did not continue. The last song is ""Night and Day,"" a standard of the era. It employs some of Durbin's operatic training and is not as outstanding as the previous song, but it is a nice change of pace for the star.

Last is Something in the Wind, a fun movie and a great example of a typical Durbin film. It has music, a great cast, and a fun but unimportant storyline that shows Durbin's knack for comedy. It starts with radio personality Mary Collins (Durbin) whose life is changed when a wealthy man accuses her of being his newly deceased grandfather's mistress. She learns that they have mistaken her for her aunt who had a romance with the old man when she was young. To get back at the ill-intending family, Durbin plays along and plans to teach them a lesson. In the process, she gets involved in a love triangle that includes the two young men of the house, Donald (John Dall) and Charlie (Donald O'Connor). Durbin and O'Connor entertain through song with several great numbers. Durbin's range goes from pop music (""The Turntable Song"") to opera (""Il Miserere""). O'Connor is great in his animated ""I Love a Mystery.""",1205280000,5,9096,4.601355514479359

629951,5,6303328164,"Deanna Durbin is one of the most fondly remembered stars in the history of American movies. Perhaps it is because we never think of her as part of Hollywood, and neither did she. Though MGM may have changed the name of this young and happy girl with the beautiful voice to Deanna, she was always Edna May Durbin on the inside, a real person. That warmth and sincerity came across on the screen and gave her something no one else had.

It was lucky for us that MGM unceremoniously dropped Durbin in favor of Judy Garland. What happened to her would never have succeeded with Durbin due to Deanna's personality, her closeness to her big sister Edith, and her parent's watchfulness. But she certainly would have walked away from Hollywood long before she did, so we can all be grateful MGM let her get away.

When Universal signed her it was on the brink of bankruptcy. Only when they saw the rushes from Three Smart Girls did they expand her role, and the rest as they say, is screen history. The film broke box office records, earning over 10 million dollars for the studio and putting them firmly back in the black.

It was really radio star Eddie Cantor who had made this possible. After Jack Sherrill brought Deanna in for an audition, Cantor took the young Durbin under his wing and gave her a three year contract at one hundred dollars a week. Cantor knew talent when he saw it, and his hundreds of thousands of listeners came to love the golden voice of this Canadian born songbird.

Deanna Durbin grew up in front of the entire country, and they continued to love her, because they could tell she was real. She appreciated her fans, but loved music more than the movies. At 15 she had a 7-year contract with Universal and received 9,000 fan letters a week. But she enjoyed the simple things like the comics and her pup Tippy. It never went to her head. She could take stardom or leave it. It was not an act. She only loved to sing.

As she grew into the beautiful young woman with such a deft touch for light comedy, she remained a very real person. She toured Army camps around the US during the war, netting over 50,000 souvenirs from doughboys on one trek. She tried and failed at love until she got it right and it stuck. She could be seen on occasion down at the Hollywood Canteen, leaning against the wall having fun while she waited for a lucky soldier to dance with.

And when she'd had enough, she walked away from Hollywood forever. She always appreciated her fans but not so much the way the industry itself treated their own. She left an entertaining body of work that could never be included on one DVD, but there are some wonderful examples of her warmth and magic here in this first ever DVD collection of her films.

The surprise included here is Something in the Wind. It is very underrated and doesn't often get mentioned with the best of Deanna's films. It's Deanna a little saucy, and singing some pop tunes like The Turntable Song and the fun and breezy title tune. A great supporting cast helps this one move along nicely. It's quite fun and a real treat for Deanna's fans to see it included here.

The other films included here are all excellent examples of Deanna's magic, from her first film as a youth to a fun murder mystery with some comedy and great songs. Every selection here has something great to offer Deanna's fans, and film buffs in general.

THREE SMART GIRLS  (1936)

Deanna Durbin simply burst on to the screen for the first time as Penny, the youngest of three sisters who attempt to break up their father's impending nuptuals so they can get him back together with their mother. This delightful romp made Deanna a star and saved Universal Studios from bankruptcy. The film itself moves at a breakneck pace, following Durbin's lead as she blows like a joyous and funny hurricane right into our hearts.

Nan Grey is Penny's sister, Joan, and Barbara Read is Kay. Charles Winninger is good as always as the parent who hasn't seen his children in ten years, and has forgotten what it means to be a father. But Penny's strong minded enthusiasm is infectious, and it isn't long before the shallow babe after his money doesn't seem near as important as his daughters.

There are some hilarious moments in this fast and furious comedy and Deanna gets to sing ""Someone to Care For Me"" and a couple of others, as one plot after another is hatched to get rid of the fiance. Mischa Auer is a hoot as the inebriated Count paid to romance away the fiance. But it is a young Ray Milland as Lord Michael Stuart who gets the most laughs when a mix-up occurs and the girls think he is the one they've paid to lure ""Precious"" away. Stuart is the real deal but plays along with the charade so he can romance Penny's sister, Kay.

An infectious joy runs all through this film and it is easy to see why this was such a hugh hit. It launched the career of one of the most fondly remembered stars of all time. This film begins with Penny, Joan and Kay sailing in Switzerland and it will sail right into your heart when you see it for the first time. A fresh and timeless treasure.

FIRST LOVE  (1937)

I truly love this film. If asked by someone who had yet to see a Deanna Durbin film where to start, in order to get a sense of her magic, I would direct them to this film. She was just beginning to blossom from the teenage sensation who saved Universal Studios from bankruptcy into the natural and lovely actress who would have such a deft touch for comedy, while still maintaining the most beautiful voice to ever come out of Hollywood.

Durbin simply glows here and is pretty enough to make a young man's heart ache in this modern day Cinderella story. Fashioned by Joe Pasternak in a very glossy production and directed by Henry Koster, the screenplay by Bruce Manning and Lionell Houser has just the right blend of the touching, the sweet and the humorous as Deanna would receive her first screen kiss.

The sweet soul Connie (Deanna) is an orphan graduating from an all girls high school presided over by Miss Wiggins (Kathleen Howard). While all her friends are going home after graduation, Connie is headed for New York to live with her uncle Jim (Eugene Pallette) and his spoiled family because he has paid for her tuition and taken care of her in a financial sense since the death of her parents.

From the moment Connie arrives she is a breath of fresh air to the stuffy mansion. Her cousin Barbara (Helen Parrish) is a spoiled brat being waited on hand and foot with no interest outside of her social standing other than the rich young man coveted by all in her circle named Tom Drake (Robert Stack). Her aunt Grace is superficially nice but a little batty about astrology and her cousin Walter (Lewis Howard) spends all his time avoiding work of any kind.

Just as in My Man Godfrey, Eugene Pallette as her uncle Jim is the only normal one in the bunch! So exasperated is he with his family, he is only at home when they are gone and rarely talks to anyone, even Connie. But it is only a matter of time until he blows. Connie's sweet demeanor begins to rub off on all the servants in the houshold as they fall in love with her. Charles Coleman as the Clinton's butler George, Jack Mulhall as the chauffeur, Lucille Ward as the cook and Dorothy Vaughan as the maid are delightful as they come to her aid with improvisational magic when Barbara schemes to keep Connie from going to the big society ballroom party.

Connie is dying to go, of course, as she's met Tom by this time and love has begun to bloom in her young heart. Frank Jenks as the black sheep of the family, Mike, helps detour Barbara and Connie's aunt until midnight, so she can have her chance. Connie makes the most of it, even getting to be the hit of the gala when she mistakenly thinks she is being asked to sing when in fact it was an opera star attending the party!

Durbin's first screen kiss truly was magical, with the breathless excitement of it caught perfectly but not overblown. It was simply a part of the story. But that story ends at midnight for Connie, who leaves in such a rush that she leaves behing a silver slipper. Her mean spirited cousin Barbara tries to take away her momentary euphoria by convincing her Ted was just toying with her.

Even though we can see what is coming next a mile away, there are some genuinely moving moments in this wonderful film. Some lovely songs like Puccini's One Fine Day and the old standard Home Sweet Home are worked into the story nicely. Durbin also gets to sing Spring In My Heart, adapted from Johann Strauss Waltzes with lyrics by Ralph Freed. The finest musical moment here, however, I believe, is when she sings the beautiful Amapola. It will take your breath away.

There is magic all through this film and her name is Deanna Durbin. I can not recommend this wonderful film any higher. I can only say, if you don't love this film, then you simply don't love the movies.

IT STARTED WITH EVE  (1941)

Deanna Durbin was always fabulous and on this outing has a nice script and fine support from Charles Laughton and Robert Cummings, making this one of her best. This film is warm, funny and delightful. Durban even gets to do a few beautiful songs that are worked into the story in a natural way. This is really a very funny comedy with many fine moments that will leave you smiling when it's over.

Jonathan Reynolds (Charles Laughton), an irracible, rich and socially prominent tycoon, is on his death bed. His son Jonathan Jr. (Robert Cummings) rushes home from Mexico with his new fiance Gloria (Margaret Tallichet) to see him before he dies, an event the papers can't wait for. But when the old man wants to meet young Jonathan's bride to be, she and her hideous mother have left the hotel to go shopping. A desparate Jonathan talks coat check girl Anne Terry (Deanna Durbin) into pretending to be Gloria for $50.00. It is money she needs for train fare back to Shelbyville because she is abandoning her dreams of singing stardom, which are going nowhere.

A teary eyed Anne has a warm and instant connection with old man Jonathan, who adores her and makes an unexpected recovery thanks to her charm and warmth. This causes complications for Jonathan, who has to catch Anne at the train station twice in order to keep the charade going! The interplay between the two as they start bickering about it is priceless. Even when the old man overhears them and knows the truth he goes along because he can see she's the right girl for his son Jonathan Jr., and the daughter-in-law he wants.

Of course, Jonathan Jr. still thinks he wants to marry the real Gloria and there is a subplot about a party which will be attended by Stokowski and Heifetz, friends of the old man. Anne may finally get her chance to be noticed. But she is too sweet to go through with it and plans on returning home to Shelbyville, prompting the wise old Jonathan to hatch up a little plan of his own.

A night on the town where a delightful Durbin teaches Laughton to do the Conga in a swank nightclub is a particular highlight of this stellar film. Deanna's tearful rendition of ""Goin' Home"" is another. There is also an hilarious fight scene with Durbin and Cummings chasing each other all over the place that involves biting and pinching which will surely leave you on the floor!

This is one of Durbin's best films. She had a flair for light comedy and a warmth and sincerity to her acting. You can't miss this one if you love Durbin or enjoy a great comedy. This is a classy production and a chance to see for yourself the always wonderful Deanna Durbin.

CAN'T HELP SINGING  (1944)

If ever a film was filled with sheer joy, this is it. Technicolor only seemed to add to a film's quality in musicals like this one. Can't Help Singing was Deanna Durbin's only film in color and the vibrant hues are stunning as both Durbin and the outdoors have never been photographed so beautifully. The brilliance of the colors is striking and the story is fun and wonderful, making this not only one of Durbin's best films, but one of the best American musicals ever made.

Deanna is a delight as the young Senator's daughter, Caroline Frost, hilariously scheming to marry young calvary officer Robert Latham (David Bruce) against her father's wishes in this adaption of  ""Girl of the Overland Trail"" by Samuel J. and Curtis B. Warshawsky. Jerome Kern wrote some great melodies for the film and E. Y. Harburg gave them lyrics still remembered decades later.

Deanna fakes a fever in hilarious fashion to get out of singing for the president so she can see Robert instead. But when that doesn't work and her dad (Ray Collins) wants to send her to see her uncle in New York, you can see the squirrel cage spinning in her head and the next thing you know she's gone missing, with a 5,000 dollar reward offered by her father for anyone who can find her. She's off to California, of course, as Robert has been sent with the 4th calvary to guard the Carstair holdings.

She gets fleeced along the way and ends up hitching her hopes on a wagon train heading out west. Akim Tamiroff and Leonid Kinskey are a hoot as the bumbling Russian thieves Gregory and Koppa, who spend the entire film attempting to steal Caroline's huge trunk but ending right back where they started! Circumstances pair her with card shark Johnny Lawlor (Robert Paige), who may need to find a new profession.

Of course they have a love-hate relationship which finally becomes just love. Before this one is over Caroline will have to pretend Gregory is her husband to get on the wagon train, then tell Johnny that she's going to California to marry the well known Carstairs (Thomas Gomez)! By the time they arrive in California, of course, all this catches up with Caroline and causes a lot of fun as she has to convince Johnny that he's really the one!

Her dad shows up and knows right away that Johnny's the right pick when he calls Caroline a liar. As her dad explains it, he's a Senator so she can't help it. She comes from a long line of liars! Gomez has a funny bit as Caroline gets him to play along and pretend he's broke up that she's not going to marry him. There is just one fun moment after another in this fine American musical set out west.

A rousing rendition of Californ-I-Ay and songs like Any Moment Now and the fabulous title tune, Can't Help Singing, are quite memorable. Deanna softly sings the Oscar nominated More and More to Johnny by a moonlit lake. This film makes you want more and more.

You'll find out what Cloud 17 is in this most delightful of films and be glad it's here on this grand collection of Deanna Durbin classics.

LADY ON A TRAIN  (1945)

This film is a Christmas snowflake from the wonderful Deanna Durbin. She may have saved Universal from bankruptcy as a young musical sensation in the late 1930's, but by the mid 1940's she had matured into a pleasantly gorgeous actress who made several memorable light comedies. This breezy murder mystery is one of her best. The entire film takes place over the Christmas weekend and it is snowing in almost every shot, making a marvelous backdrop to this fun film.

Nikki Collins (Deanna) is on a train bound for New York for the holidays. While reading a mystery by her favorite author, Wayne Morgan (David Bruce), she witnesses the murder of Josiah Warring from the window of her compartment. When no one will believe her, she hunts down mystery writer Morgan and slowly drags him into her enthusiastic search for the killer. He is engaged to a rather stuffy society babe, and we know right away that he and Durbin will end up together before the final curtain.

The murdered man was a rich shipping magnate and when Durbin attempts to snoop around the tycoon's mansion she is mistaken by nephew Arnold (Dan Duryea) for Margo Martin, the nightclub singer to whom Josiah has left everything, much to the chagrin of everyone. This gives Durbin an opportunity to go to the nightclub and do some amateur detective work, as well as do a sexy rendition of ""Give Me a Little Kiss, Will Ya?"" and the lovely ""Night and Day"" while she pretends to be Margo.

The real Margo gets murdered, of course, as does the owner of the swanky nightclub. And everyone seems to be after those blood stained slippers Nikki has found which prove the tycoon was really murdered. David Bruce does a nice job as the mystery writer Morgan as does Duryea as the black sheep of the family. Ralph Bellamy is fine as the good nephew. Edward Everett Horten gives a very funny performance as Mr. Haskell, who has been instructed to keep an eye on Durbin by her father, which proves to be a nearly impossible task!

This is an entertaining muder mystery that is a lot of fun to watch. Deanna Durbin and the great cast make this film light and airy. She married director Charles David II later on and maybe that's part of the happiness you feel from the screen. We get to watch a glowing Durbin solve a murder, fall in love and sing some nice songs, all during a snowy Christmas weekend. What could be wrong with that?

IN SUMMATION:

The only gripe one could possibly come up with here is that there isn't more. There are many other great films available that will hopefully soon be included on another release. Spring Parade with Bob Cummings is not even available on VHS! And only in the region 2 format can you purchase Hers to Hold with Joseph Cotton or Christmas Holiday with Gene Kelly. If you're on a budget and can't afford the equipment necessary to watch these classics, you're sunk.

That being said, it's a delight to have these all on one DVD, though I do suggest picking up the VHS versions as you can because the quality is a bit better on some of them. You simply can't beat this for the price! These aren't just movies, but memories of someone special who passed this way. A fine present to yourself or a friend, from the wonderful Deanna Durbin, ""The Last Rose of Summer.""",1114992000,134,17940,4.501999384804676
629952,5,6303328164,"Deanna Durbin simply burst on to the screen for the first time as Penny, the youngest of three sisters who attempt to break up their father's impending nuptuals so they can get him back together with their mother. This delightful romp made Deanna a star and saved Universal Studios from bankruptcy. The film itself moves at a breakneck pace, following Durbin's lead as she blows like a joyous and funny hurricane right into our hearts.

Nan Grey is Penny's sister, Joan, and Barbara Read is Kay. Charles Winninger is good as always as the parent who hasn't seen his children in ten years, and has forgotten what it means to be a father. But Penny's strong minded enthusiasm is infectious, and it isn't long before the shallow babe after his money doesn't seem near as important as his daughters.

There are some hilarious moments in this fast and furious comedy and Deanna gets to sing ""Someone to Care For Me"" and a couple of others, as one plot after another is hatched to get rid of the fiance. Mischa Auer is a hoot as the inebriated Count paid to romance away the fiance. But it is a young Ray Milland as Lord Michael Stuart who gets the most laughs when a mix-up occurs and the girls think he is the one they've paid to lure ""Precious"" away. Stuart is the real deal but plays along with the charade so he can romance Penny's sister, Kay.

An infectious joy runs all through this film and it is easy to see why this was such a hugh hit. It launched the career of one of the most fondly remembered stars of all time. This film begins with Penny, Joan and Kay sailing in Switzerland and it will sail right into your heart when you see it for the first time. A fresh and timeless treasure.",1112572800,4,1691,4.396166134185304
629953,5,6303328164,"This review only concerns the one film, ""It Started with Eve."" This is a particularly choice film, not only because it stars the younger Deanna Durbin (much fresher and more delightful than the more mature star), but especially because of a banner, bang-up performance by Charles Laughton. Three cheers!

Charles Laughton turns in a wonder, atypical performance as an impish, sprightly old man. He is the moving force behind the love story in this film, and he is a wonder. A pity we haven't seen more of him in a humorous mode. A fine film all in all, but a great one for this!

Also, the film provides a rare treat of showing Deanna Durbin doing a song in her lower register. She is really a fine mezzo. Unfortunately, Hollywood generally makes her sing high soprano roles. Her ""Going Home"" is a treat indeed.

While the entire pack of 6 films is super, the star here is ""It Started with Eve!""",1109721600,14,895,4.546583850931677
629954,5,6303328164,"Deanna Durbin's freshness, youth, and energy sets up the mood for this fun, light hearted movie.

She plays Penny, the youngest of three daughters who, in order to bring back together their divorced parents, goes to New York with her older sisters and tries to dissuade their rich father from marrying his fortune-hunting fiance.

In their attempt to separate their father from his future bride, they stumble upon two handsome young men who fall in love with the two older sisters, Joan and Kay.  (Note:  Kay is the lucky one who steals the heart  of the handsomest of the two men, Lord Stuart, played by a very young and gorgeous Ray Milland).

Joan's Beau, Bill Evans, tries to help the three girls by hiring an out of work, alcoholic Hungarian to play the part of a rich Hungarian Count so he can lure their father's fiance away with his make-believe millions.  But things don't turn out quite as planned when Lord Stuart is accidentally mistaken as the hired Hungarian.

Very funny plot twists, entertaining music, and an overall enjoyable movie!!  Highly recommended for Durbin fans and for anyone who enjoys funny romantic musicals!",1105574400,3,1138,4.8549222797927465
629955,5,6303328164,"First of all I have to admit that although I'm an ardent ""classics"" movie buff, I had never seen any of Deanna Durbin's movies, mainly because they were never shown on TV, at least in my country. Since I had read a lot about her persona, amazing voice, her status as Universal's prime superstar, etc., I was eager to watch her on film.

I got this wonderful package last year as a gift and sincerely, after watching the first of six feature films, I had to watch them all, as soon as possible, because I fell completely under the spell of Durbin's lovely screen persona: unaffected, sincere, pretty, down-to-earth, sweet, etc.

The films included in this collection are at least good and most of them very good. In spite of what I've read from other customers, I have to say that almost all the copies of the films are in very good condition, with the only exception perhaps, of ""Three Smart Girls"", which is somewhat grainy and not so sharp as the others, but then, it is the oldest of the lot (1936), and anyway is in pretty decent conditions.

""Three Smart Girls"" is her best known film included here, because it was her breakthrough film, the one which made her a star, as a young girl-she is not even top billed here- who helps her elder sisters to try to bring their estranged parents together. There's some fine comedy, nice songs and expert supporting players.

In my humble opinion, the best films of the bunch are ""First Love"" (1939) and ""It Started with Eve"" (1941), both lovely Cinderella-type tales in which her natural talent and unaffected acting shine thoroughly.

There's also a ""whodunit""-mystery film, ""Lady On a Train"" (1945), directed by her second husband, French director Charles-David, a fine and absorbing movie. On the other hand, ""Can't Help Singing"" is a glorious Technicolor musical with a score by the legendary Jerome Kern, with Deanna looking ravishingly beautiful in period costume, surrounded by ""western"" outdoors.

""Something in the Wind"" (1947), maybe the weakest of the films which belong to this pack, but is a nice, engaging, mistaken-identity-comedy with Deanna as a discjockey.

In these films she acts with and is supported by some of the finest actors in Hollywood, such as Mischa Auer, Robert Cummings, Robert Stack, Charles Laughton, Donald O'Connor, Guy Kibbee, Akim Tamiroff, Binnie Barnes, Charles Winninger, Alice Brady, Ray Milland, Eugene Pallette, Kathleeen Howard, Ralph Bellamy and Edward Everett Horton.

Since I only saw Deanna on film for the first time last year, for me she was really Hollywood's best kept secret! Enjoy!",1104969600,35,2581,4.9036697247706424

The packaging is charming but the films (both black and white and colour) are addictive. I know I shall keep watching these films. I do prefer her more adult roles but then her voice is lovely no matter what.

I would encourage anyone who loves the older Hollywood musicals to try this DVD. They take your mind off the day-to-day irritations and stress, and you enter into Deanna's bueatiful world. I fully intend to lose myself there quite often.",1093219200,6,618,4.373913043478261

Has that viewer ever heard of the ""Stop"" button? Is he aware there are thousands of titles to choose from, rather than being tortured by Deanna's work? I am one happy viewer who is thrilled with having on disc six of her movies. The grain problem is especially apparent on ""Three Smart Girls"" and ""First Kiss"" but the restoration of ""It Started With Eve"" is superb. These movies allow you to watch a legendary artist evolve over the years. Deanna steals everything but the cameras in ""Three Smart Girls"" and matures in every production. From the point in time, savvy movie buffs can study how a major studio like Universal experimented with different scripts and looks and cast members. ""First Love"" looks as if the studio was still not sure how to present the obviously mature Deanna in her first adult role. She plays her role of the rejected orphan with an icky frailty and passivity that isn't what we remember most about Deanna. Two of her greatest musicals, ""HIs Butler's Sister"" and ""Nice Girl?"" will hopefully be included on the second Deanna collection. In these two movies, you see full-on how Universal invested in hiring the best supporting casts in Hollywood with top-flight production values and musical numbers.

629991,4,6303328164,"I'm not sure what to make of some of the previous reviews regarding the quality of the DVD transfers of these films. I agree with the poster who said that THREE SMART GIRLS has a slightly grainy quality to it compared to the other films, but the picture quality for all of these films is a big improvement over the picture quality of the videotapes released by MCA/UNIVERSAL in the late 1990s.

Both the picture and sound quality are much sharper and clearer than on previous releases of these films. I'm a big fan of Deanna Durbin's and have seen these films many times, but these are the cleanest crispest copies I've ever seen. I""ll admit that they don't quite meet the standard of the highest grade DVD classic release process given to films like THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, MEET ME IN ST LOUIS and SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, but they're as good overall quality as any other DVD editions of classic films in my collection.

In any case, no one should pass out the opportunity to check out the delightful Deanna Durbin. Love her or hate her, like all great stars, she was a one-of-a-kind performer, much imitated by other studios' attempts to cash in on her unique combination of beauty, talent, charm and an oustanding, uniquely pure and natural lyric soprano singing voice, but never equalled. She captured the world's affection to a degree few, if any, of her contemporaries could match and among her most ardent fans were World Leaders like Winston Churchill, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin. Admirably, when she felt that she had had enough (and despite many tempting subsequent offers to resume her career), she wisely walked away from fame and devoted herself to family and friends, enjoying a comfortable and wealthy retirement for over fifty years now.

These six films are an excellent introduction to Durbin's remarkable talent and legacy and shouldn't be missed by anyone who enjoys and appreciates great singing and great comedy.

A more effective way of torturing people would certainly be subjecting them to the insipid films of Deanna Durbin. Her biggest virtue was having a rather prominent unibrow, and while her screechy voice and inability to act were well matched by the cheap Universal movies in which she starred.

Her few years of popularity are a mystery to me....

Universal video has assembled a bunch of her films in this DVD collection in ratty transfers and a shoddy package. Her bevy of fans (all three dozen of them) may eat this up, but as the Amazon sales ranking suggests, this release will probably not have a follow-up.

Deanna is forgotten, and bless her heart, let her stay that way!",1092009600,7,855,4.916666666666667
629993,4,6303328164,"The four star rating is for the somewhat pedestrian quality of the transfers, not an indication on Durbin's alleged lack of singing/acting ability or appeal as the following commentary will demonstrate....

Deanna Durbin was one of the most influential and popular Hollywood stars of all time. As the world's first ""Teen Idol"" and the first child star to make the heretofore unsuccessful transition from child to adult roles while retaining her public and critical popularity, it was Deanna Durbin who first proved that an adolescent, even one with an astonishingly mature operatic lyric soprano, could be a potent and enduring box office attraction. The only performer in film history to be publicly credited with singlehandedly saving her studio (Universal) from bankruptcy and sustaining it as a Hollywood player for several years with  the wildly successful grosses of her films, as film historians such as William K. Everson, David Shipman and Ethan Mordden have stated, Durbin remained, throughout her thirteen year tenure at Universal, the studio's most lucrative and valuable asset and its only consistently ranking box office star.

It was the great critical and popular acclaim accorded Durbin's debut in THREE SMART GIRLS and her subsequent vehicles (both THREE SMART GIRLS and Durbin's second film 100 MEN AND A GIRL received Oscar nominations for Best Picture) over the next several years that prompted MGM and other studios to begin assembling and promoting their own stable of charismatic and talented young performers. Among the most notable Durbin ""follow ups"" (as one critic labeled them) were Judy Garland (whose studio, MGM didn't begin promoting her in earnest until after the great acclaim accorded Durbin in THREE SMART GIRLS and who, in contemporary interviews, publicly thanked Deanna for creating a market for and interest in, starring roles for adolescent girls), Susanna Foster (signed by MGM but droppred before she appeared in a film and subsequently signed by both Paramount and later, Universal), Ann Blyth and Gloria Jean (both signed by Universal to take up in Durbin's adolescent roles as she grew into adulthood), Gloria Warren (signed as Warner's answer to Durbin) and, at MGM, Kathryn Grayson and Jane Powell (MGM's most talented and successful operatic Durbin follow up). As David Shipman commented:  ""Every studio wanted a Durbin, but no one wanted one as badly as Louis B. Mayer.""

Although all of these subsequent performers, particularly Garland, were attractive, popular and talented, of the group only Garland seriously rivaled Durbin's great popularity with press and public and only with 1944's MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, released seven years after Durbin's 1937 debut in THREE SMART GIRLS, did Garland (who, prior to ST LOUIS had served primarily as a critical but supporting co-star to Mickey Rooney in their ANDY HARDY and BABES films) obtain the type of ""A"" list, top-billed solo star status at MGM that Durbin had secured with her Universal film debut. Significantly, despite all of its' considerable resources which included signing Durbin's producer/director team of Joe Pasternak and Henry Koster following their departure from Universal in 1941, neither Grayson nor the unjustly underrated Powell nor their films, though well-made and certainly entertaining and popular, made the sensational impression on press and public that Durbin and her films did, nor have Grayson and Powell's Durbin-inspired MGM vehicles generated the enduring interest and acclaim accorded Durbin and her films by film scholars and historian in succeeding decades.

Pasternak himself clearly recognized Durbin's greater talent and appeal vis-a-vis her MGM rivals. Although he was largely responsible for developing and fostering the screen images of Grayson and Powell at MGM as he had done with Durbin at Universal, Deanna Durbin was the only one of his teen soprano screen stars who Pasternak avidly and diligently pursued to make a screen comeback under his aegis in the decades following her retirement from the screen, and even though Garland in the second half of her MGM career, obtained a comparable degree of stardom to rival Durbin's, in 1945 and 1947, when Garland was at the very peak of her MGM critical and popular acclaim, Deanna Durbin was the highest paid woman in the United States and her fan club was reported to be, as it had been for some time, one of the world's biggest.

Nor was Pasternak the only entertainment executive interested in obtaining Durbin's services following her announced retirement in 1949. According to published reports, among the very tempting and lucrative offers which Durbin declined following her departure from Universal and Hollywood were: a lucrative contract from MGM, the opportunities to play the female lead (Katharine/Lili Vanessi) in the London stage production and 1953 MGM film version of KISS ME KATE (producer Jack Cummings reportedly flew to Paris to offer Durbin this role in person and only gave it to Grayson after Durbin declined), co-starring roles opposite Bing Crosby (who wanted her for both TOP 'O THE MORNING and A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT), the offer (from Alan Jay Lerner) to create the role of ""Eliza Doolittle"" in the original production of MY FAIR LADY and the offer of a blank cheque to perform in concert in Las Vegas. (Durbin was also wanted by the Theater Guild for the female lead in the original production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's OKLAHOMA! in 1943, but Universal refused to loan her out.)

As for the collection itself, while there's little doubt that MCA/UNIVERSAL could have done a better job of transfering the films to DVD (THREE SMART GIRLS in particular has a sightly grainy quality), the quality overall is quite good, especially considering the bargain price, and most customers should be more than satisfied with the overall picture quality of the transfers, which is a definite improvement over the VHS editions. Moreover the titles contained in the collection provide a good overall survey for the curious viewer unfamilar with Durbin and her work to appraise her career and talent. From her starmaking debut in 1937'S THREE SMART GIRLS (in which she receives special billing as ""Universal's New Discovery"") to her transition to ingenue in 1939's Cinderella update FIRST LOVE (in which she received a much-publicized first onscreen kiss from screen newcomer Robert Stack) to her first fully adult role in 1941's IT STARTED WITH EVE (which contains some gentle satirizing of the same year's CITIZEN KANE in its' opening scenes), Durbin's Universal vehicles were characterized by top-flight production values and supporting talent (her supporting casts in these films include some of the finest character actors of all time including, Charles Laughton, Alice Brady, Mischa Auer, Eugene Pallette. Akim Tamiroff and Leonid Kinskey) and although more modest and leaner in scope than MGM's bigger budgeted musical productions, they also are more breezy insouciant stylish and sophisticated than MGM's homespun middle-American productions, and are unburdened by the jingoistic, self-serving sentimentality and proselytizing which mar the contemporaneous MGM productions of Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland and others.

Moreover the varied genres in which Durbin dabbled in the films of this collection, from screwball comedies with music (THREE SMART GIRLS, FIRST LOVE IT STARTED WITH EVE) to screwball noir (LADY ON A TRAIN), to more traditional musicals ( the lavish Technicolored Western musical CAN'T HELP SINGING,  and the urbane pop-oriented screwball SOMETHING IN THE WND), indicate that Universal had a greater faith in her charm and talent to retain her following in out-of-sort vehicles than MGM had in Garland's, Powell's, Grayson's and other of their musical stars to do so. Incidentally, Durbin is also the only one of the ""Teen Sopranos"" of that era to have inspired true ""crossover"" appeal. Among the notable artists who have cited Durbin as one of the most important sources of inspiration and/or admiration are: Mel Torme (who lists Durbin as one of his ""Musical Heroines"" in his autobiography), Maureen McGovern, Jane Powell, Joan Sutherland, Gracie Fields, Lawrence Tibbett, Elly Ameling, Mstislav Rostropovich, Nancy Lamott and Monica Mancini.

More than half a century after her retirement from the screen, Durbin's films remain bright, breezy and enormously entertaining, and prove the uniquely compelling and enduring aspects of both her remarkable talent and appeal. Durbin's independent, resourceful and impulsive screen image has remained surprisingly contemporary, but although vestiges of the feisty ""Little Miss Fixit"" adolescent/young adult onscreen persona  Durbin patented have endured in the decades since her retirement in the screen images of both musical (e.g, Julie Andrews in THE SOUND OF MUSIC and THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE) and non-musical (e.g., Sandra Dee, Sandra Bullock,Ricki Lake Hilary Duff, Amanda Bynes, Anne Hathaway, etc.) and other actresses, despite repeated attempts to clone her throughout the years, Durbin remains to this day a uniquely appealing and talented personality, and her best films uniquely appealing stylish and enjoyable products of the studio system at its' finest.

The significant impact Deanna Durbin had on film history and the uniquely appealing combination of looks, and naturalistic charm and musico-acting ability she brought to the screen have never been fully appreciated or equalled and this collection provides a fine basis for finding out why she has continued to remain a source of fascination and inspiration in the over half century since she retired.  She's well worth checking out and, whether you're a casual viewer or devoted film buff, you're really missing out on something special if you don't take the opportunity to do so.",1091923200,73,9848,5.353359173126615
629994,2,6303328164,"""Deanna Durbin: Sweetheart Pack"" is Universal's celebration of the adolescent soprano that MGM discarded after screen testing her opposite Judy Garland in the musical short ""Every Sunday."" In hindsight MGM's decision to can Durbin is sound, though after the success of her debut film L.B Mayer was probably kicking himself. However, although Durbin is a pre-teen operatic sensation she lacks the star power or dramatic acting chops needed to make her a full fledged musical star. Not that anyone noticed during her tenure at Universal. Durbin was one of the most popular and most successful of that studio's stars. But her films lack the effervescent abandonment and stunning creativity behind MGM's Jane Powell film vehicles.  Aside: this collection of Deanna's greatest hits DOES NOT contain the film ""100 Men & A Girl"" - currently advertised on some web sites as part of this collection and undoubtedly the best film Durbin ever made during her tenure. One can only assume that its absence from this collection will result in ""Deanna Durbin: Sweethearts #2.""

This collection begins with ""Three Smart Girls,"" Deanna's entr&eacute;e into films at Universal. There is a definite sense from studio big wigs that they were testing the waters for Durbin's public appeal. She stars as Penny Craig, a precocious youngster who conspires with her two sisters to unite their divorced parents. The script is chalked full of musical numbers to cleverly hide the fact that Durbin's primary asset is her singing ability. As standard musical tripe this film trips tunefully by, but it has no staying power once you've finished with it.  ""Something In The Wind"" is a grossly misleading premise for a film musical. Durbin plays Mary, a disc jockey who gets mistaken for her mother, also named Mary.  Mary Sr. has been collecting support payments from her dead lover's estate for some time.  However, when relatives mistake young Mary as the beneficiary, they plot to destroy Mary's credibility as a means of getting the support payments to stop. Once again it's the musical program that rescues this film from melodramatic oblivion. ""First Love"" is the best film in this collection: a Cinderella fable in which Durbin is Connie Harding, an orphan sent to finishing school by a philanthropic uncle. There she finds true romance with Ted Drake (Robert Stack). Ironically, the solid story is buttressed by only a few songs. Clearly, Universal knew the dramatic portion of this film was above par for a Durbin vehicle and tempered their urge to go all out on a song fest. ""It Started With Eve"" is a close runner up to ""First Date"". When the son of a millionaire, Jonathan Reynolds (Robert Cummings) suspects that his father (Charles Laughton) is dying, Jonathan is determined to fulfill a last request; namely that his father should meet his fianc&eacute;e. However, when she isn't available, Jonathan grabs hat check girl, Anne-Terry (Durbin) as a quickie replacement. But his deception backfires when dad makes a speedy recovery.  ""Can't Help Singing"" is aptly the only reason why one would invest time in this trite little tale of Caroline Frost (Durbin), a head strong girl from back east who tackles the old west and romance with a cavalry officer (David Bruce).  Finally, there's ""Lady on a Train,"" a curiously sour note in Durbin's repertoire. She plays a sleuth in a murder mystery opposite a handsome writer (David Bruce, again). There's more than the prerequisite of twists and turns in this convoluted tale but this film is no ""Strangers on a Train"" and, with the inclusion of predictable songs it really can't decide whether to play as a musical or a suspense thriller. Ultimately it winds up being a mutt, half and half: uninspired and pretty forgettable.

Universal hasn't paid much attention to quality on this collection. The gray scale on almost all films in this set is poorly balanced with low contrast levels, weak blacks and very unclean whites. With the exception of ""First Love"", the rest of the films in this batch are riddled with age related artifacts and a considerable amount of film grain. Some edge enhancement, pixelization and shimmering of fine details crops up now and then to further degrade the image quality. There's also a complete lack of tonal quality in the audio. Durbin sounds exceptionally shrill when she sings and dialogue is often buried under a barrage of pops and hissing that further detracts from your listening pleasure. Ultimately this isn't an outstanding effort - either from Durbin, Universal or the stellar capabilities of the digital format. I don't recommend this set to anyone who is NOT a die hard Deanna Durbin fan.  One final note: the insert for this collection is merely tucked in between the gate fold, making it easy to misplace damage and lose.",1091750400,18,4794,5.005018820577164
629995,3,6303328164,"Deanna Durbin is a well-kept secret, but a secret with which you should become well acquainted. Her movies have great entertainment value, both from a comical standpoint, as well as Deanna's great singing skills. Not too many movies were able to combine these two factors and succeed.

Universal has done a decent job on these movies, something which is a bit of a surprise considering they have so many quality control problems with their Abbott & Costello series. I made it through all five movies without any stalls or skips.

The transfer for ""Three Smart Girls"" definitely could have used some attention. It is full of grain and film damage. The rest of the movies rate from average to excellent in their transfers. None of the movies are visually poor enough to be unwatchable, and that is a great thing, because these are movies you will want to watch over and over.

Universal's biggest problem with this set is the packaging, which is horrendous. A loose flyer is inserted in the package, which undoubtedly will become lost or damaged over time. The package itself has no sleeve in which to insert it, so it springs open unless placed between other packages on a shelf. All in all, a very poor design.

It is doubtful these movies will ever see another release on DVD, so don't pass up the opportunity to see them. They are delightful, and getting six movies for this price is still a bargain, even if the packaging is poorly designed and the transfers aren't perfect.",1091577600,74,1477,4.713178294573644
