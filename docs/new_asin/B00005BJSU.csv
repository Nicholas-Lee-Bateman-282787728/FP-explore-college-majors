1425331,3,B00005BJSU,"This is the first of an excellent series starring Buck Jones, Tim McCoy, and Raymond Hatton, who play U. S. marshals who come to the aid of a stagecoach owner whose stages are being constantly robbed. Called the  ""Roughriders"" they usually ride in from different locales to aid  the oppressed. Excellent performances by all. Series ended following year  when Buck was killed in the tragic nightclub fire in Boston and McCoy later  left for service in WWII.",964224000,4,456,4.883116883116883

1425335,2,B00005BJSU,"The first entry in Monogram's ""Rough Riders"" series is a dull programmer with little action until the exciting final reel. It's good to see Buck Jones, Tim McCoy and Raymond Hatton join forces, but they appeared in better Westerns than ""Arizona Bound"" (1941). Routine direction from serial specialist Spencer Bennet.",1339459200,2,316,5.34
1425336,3,B00005BJSU,"Important for being the first of the Monogram ROUGH RIDERS series, ARIZONA BOUND (1941) sets the stage for those that followed, in that each Rough Rider arrives on the case in question seperately, and apparently unknown to each other until it's time to play their hand. Buck Jones is retired marshal Buck Roberts, Tim McCoy plays lawman Tim McCall (usually mistaken for a ""sky pilot""), and Raymond Hatton rounds out the trio as peace officer Sandy Hopkins, a character he would continue to play in Johnny Mack Brown's NEVADA JACK MCKENZIE series which followed the ROUGH RIDERS after Buck Jones died in the tragic Coconut Grove fire of 1942.
ARIZONA BOUND is a good start to the series as the boys solve a series of stagecoach robberies in Mesa City, breaking up bad guy Tris Coffin's gang. Tim McCoy , holding everyone at gunpoint in the saloon and forcing all to sing a song is a classic scene! However, the print used by ALPHA dvd is quite shabby, dark and well-worn, hence a much lower rating than this oater deserves. Five star movie, two star dvd.",1261180800,,1053,4.666666666666667

1425338,4,B00005BJSU,"Three rangy looking hombres ride into a town seemingly unknown to each other and by the end of the story these three make all things right. Happens time and again in the Rough Riders movies.

""When the Rough Riders ride . . . It's good to have them on your side.""

The Border Cities Stage Line of Mesa City, Arizona, is loosing its gold shipments to local outlaws and is just about out of business. Enter our three heroes: Marshal Buck Roberts (Buck Jones), Marshal Tim McCall/'Parson' McCall (Tim McCoy), and Marshal Sandy Hopkins (Raymond Hatton). When that happens you can always be assured that they will work alone, and much gunfire will follow their trails, and it won't be long until the local crooks are either full of lead or heading to the jailhouse.

These movies are excellent westerns yet today.  If you enjoy old tyme westerns then you just have to view some of these gems. This one from the year 1941 is one of the first made in this series and only spreads out through 9, but good movies all.

With Tim McCoy heading back to his ranch in Wyoming, and Raymond Hatton hastening back to Texas to get married, and Buck Rogers remaining on his ranch in Arizona, it seems these three will never get together unless they are working on a case.

As they always say: So long, Rough Riders.

Until you watch or rewatch their movies, that is.

1425341,3,B00005BJSU,"Retired marshal Buck Roberts (Buck Jones) has left law enforcement and is enjoying life on his northern Arizona ranch when he receives a telegram from Marshall Bat Madison (Jay Wilsey) requesting his aid in stopping a rash of stagecoach robberies near villain invested Mesa City, and off he goes as a fast-paced Rough Riders (Jones, Tim McCoy, Raymond Hatton) adventure begins. Representing the forces of good against the forces of evil in this Monogram series, the three stalwarts have arrived separately and apparently unknown to each other into the plagued town, Roberts as a cattlebuyer, Hatton as Sandy Hopkins, a cattledealer, and McCoy as Parson McCall, an itinerant preacher, and quickly come up against Steve Taggart (Tristram Coffin), the ringleader of the bandit gang they seek. Roberts volunteers as a stage driver for the company owned by Ruth Masters (Luana Walters), is framed with the responsibility for the holdups transferred to him, and it falls to the other two Riders to rescue their jailed comrade, and to give Jones, aboard his splendid steed Silver, an opportunity to display his riding and stunt ability in one of his final appearances before his untimely death in Boston's Coconut Grove fire the following year. Although this film does not receive strong direction, the cast and crew perform their duties very well indeed, with Slim Whitaker in his accustomed role as evil henchman, and the rugged Jones and hard-eyed McCoy as usual seem more than capable of handling any adverse situation that might present itself.",1112140800,5,1542,5.147410358565737
