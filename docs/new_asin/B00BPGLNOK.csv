5664103,4,B00BPGLNOK,I was just browsing one day and gave it a shot. A coming of age movie where the guy is much older. Good laughs and something different.,1366588800,,135,4.037037037037037
5664104,4,B00BPGLNOK,Typical format with an atypical scenario. Very well acted and directed even without a big budget. Worth the rental fee and I will keep an eye out for it on disc.,1365638400,4,161,4.225806451612903
5664105,4,B00BPGLNOK,This movie made both my husband and I laugh. Its easy to relate to and very practical. Nothing out of the norm. There were some parts that were kind of clich&eacute;.....but none-the-less we enjoyed it.,1365465600,2,202,4.8

5664111,5,B00BPGLNOK,"In contrast to the innuendo of the packaging, and the aggressive style of the presentation, the story is actually quite satisfyingly nice.  Try it.",1470700800,,147,5.125
5664112,5,B00BPGLNOK,Wasn't sure what to expect but this story was interesting and fun!  It has some very explicit sexual scenes so if that bothers you then you might not like it.,1470096000,,158,4.266666666666667

5664119,4,B00BPGLNOK,"This film is what the title says. If you're looking for something deep, meaningful, and romantic, go buy The Notebook. If you're looking for fun, funny, crude, and a little cute, enjoy ;)",1440460800,,187,4.696969696969697
5664120,5,B00BPGLNOK,It was a great movie.  The actors were excellent.,1438300800,,49,4.444444444444445
5664121,5,B00BPGLNOK,Was exactly as I expected? A great sex comedy which did not pass boundaries.,1436140800,,76,4.5
5664122,5,B00BPGLNOK,"At first I thought this was a naughty movie but it's really not, although there are a few R-rated scenes. I burst out laughing at the massage parlor scene, oh my God. But is really a sweet movie. How raunchy can Canadian be?",1426377600,,224,4.232558139534884
5664123,5,B00BPGLNOK,This is the funniest movie I've watched in a long time. The dialogue was hilarious and the situations very funny. What a surprise as I just happened to see this and gave it a try. Highly recommended!,1423785600,,199,4.405405405405405
5664124,5,B00BPGLNOK,I saw this movie at the Santa Barbara film festival and loved it then. I think it's a great story and really well done for the budget!,1423008000,,134,4.0
5664125,4,B00BPGLNOK,"This independent film (produced in Canada and marketed by Tribeca) would have an R rating if it had a rating at all.  The dust jacket shows what looks (from the waist down) like perhaps a teenage girl in a cheerleader-type outfit holding a large, sliced cantaloupe and suggests this could be a very juvenile sort of sexual comedy.  Watching the film, I was very pleased to find it was way better than I expected.  In fact my wife also watched it and said it was one of the better films shed seen recently too.
There is indeed plenty of reference to sex (though not more than partial-frontal nudity), but the film is more than about sex.  Giving away the barest sketch of the plot, which becomes pretty obvious rather early on anyhow, its an unusual love-triangle story in which Jordan (performed by the script writer Jonas Chernick) is dumped by his would-be fiance Rachel (played by Sarah Manninen) and ends up taking vacation alone to see if he can find his sex yoda, to teach him how to be less boring in bed.  With the initial help of a longstanding male Indian-Canadian friend, he ends up accidentally meeting Julia, played by Emily Hampshire, and one rapidly sees that the two of them complement each other rather well: she is thoroughly at home with her body and all manner of things sexual but abysmal with money, while being an accountant he is thoroughly at home in the realm of budgets, taxes, credit cards and the like, but the most awkward and nerdy character with women (at least initially) that Ive seen in a long time [at times its a bit reminiscent of 40 Year Old Virgin].

A dramatic peak occurs roughly halfway through the film, in which we sequentially see each of these three, looking at themselves in a mirror and pondering what it is that they truly want (or need).  Without a single word being spoken, I found it a most evocative scene.

In addition to being a genuine relationship movie, its also genuinely funny.  The humor is well-done, it starts immediately and continues all the way through to the end of the film.  Its a modern-day, sexually explicit but actually a romantic comedy.  I give it a B+ and if you aren't bothered by explicit language and partial nudity, I expect the reader will find this fun to watch.",1417132800,3,2245,4.5875
5664126,4,B00BPGLNOK,A fun romp,1414540800,,10,2.6666666666666665
5664127,4,B00BPGLNOK,I saw this at the Santa Barbara film festival and I found it really fun and entertaining.  I thought the lead was likable and easy to relate to as he struggles through his insecurities.,1412121600,,185,4.4411764705882355
5664128,4,B00BPGLNOK,The movie was both cute and funny. It was much more than I expected. It will be a nice addition to the collection.,1404000000,,114,4.0
5664129,4,B00BPGLNOK,Great romantic movie with a sexual twist. The characters are believable yet extreme. The sex is almost comedy and awkward moments rather than steamy bedroom stuff. Two scenes about cunnilingus and massage parlors are hilarious.,1399420800,,227,5.514285714285714
5664130,3,B00BPGLNOK,"Not worth the time to watch, much better out there. Don't waste your time.  I wasted my money on this?",1387584000,,102,4.1
5664131,4,B00BPGLNOK,"Witty, funny well casted.... Leaves lots to laugh at..............  If you like quirky films this is for you.  Especially you Canadians who can identify with the need to plug in your cars in Winnapeg in the winter",1382832000,,213,4.72972972972973
5664132,5,B00BPGLNOK,"Excellent story line, amazingly hilarious,  and just all around good humor. I would recommend to friends and family. Worth the money.",1381708800,,133,5.333333333333333
5664133,5,B00BPGLNOK,Hampshire is wonderfull...she is adorable....creative take...an enjoyable film to watch. Everything was as expectected...great condition...I would order from them again.,1380672000,,169,7.5
5664134,5,B00BPGLNOK,Very Funny movie.  I highly recommend it. You will enjoy it. Like they are mentioned it is An Awkward Sexual Adventure. No doubt about it.,1380240000,,138,4.52
5664135,4,B00BPGLNOK,A movie my hubby and I enjoyed. If you don't like stepping out of the box then this movie is not for you.  If your looking for a not so typical movie then give this one a try,1380153600,,174,3.5789473684210527
5664136,5,B00BPGLNOK,"It starts out kinda slow as just a comedy but pulls in the romance and life aspects that make this a movie ANYONE can related to.  There are parts of the fun care free stripper and logical by the book accountant in EVERYONE, which you will discover and LOVE!!!

Good stuff",1379462400,,272,4.313725490196078
5664137,3,B00BPGLNOK,"There are a few very funny line/scenes in this film and I did enjoy it.  It is sexually explicit.  If that bothers you, then this isn't your cup of tea.  The story is a bit amateurish and predictable, but it's still a decent film.  For a ""time-killer"" film, this one hit the mark for me.",1378339200,4,287,4.163636363636364
5664138,5,B00BPGLNOK,"This is a very good, original, complex love story.... And I hate love stories, my wife love them, but I liked this one.",1378252800,,119,4.217391304347826
5664139,5,B00BPGLNOK,"I laughed. I cried. I was surprised. I was shocked. I'd give this movie 11 stars, if there was such a thing.",1377648000,,108,3.9545454545454546
5664140,3,B00BPGLNOK,The stream stopped three times. Haven't been able to complete the movie. Seems like a sweet pic shame i couldn't see it in one sitting.,1376438400,,135,4.44
5664141,5,B00BPGLNOK,"WoW!!!
We just watched this wonderful surprise of a movie. It was funny, sad, angering, playful, just a fresh change of the generic movies out these days. I defiantly would not have labeled it a raunchy comedy. I've seen more skin and sex on cable TV. The ending made me smile and cry at the same time. You really need to see this with the honey;)",1376438400,,347,4.2727272727272725
5664142,4,B00BPGLNOK,"This film has a lot in common with the above two films - from the box cover - to the casual nudity but this film was made in Canada with a lot of financial participation from the Canadian Government and Film Board. That gives it a bit more cred in some eyes.  There is a serious ""love story going on here"" and there's a few winks to Julia Roberts' hooker role in ""Pretty Woman"" - only the lead actress (none are well-known in the US) plays a stripper her - who does give lap dances (and maybe more!) to the club customers. The actress, Emily Hampshire, sure reminded me of a young Sally Field - and has a similar hairdo. The language is raw and there is a good deal of nudity, but what else would you expect. The Film stars the screenwriter and he gives himself the juiciest role. Oftentimes I found the action a bit silly but then said ""hey, this is an independent film after all"". There are enough pop songs on the soundtrack to actually distract you from the action but I guess there are a lot of up-and-coming Canadian pop songwriters who want exposure.

I can't say I loved the 98-minute film, but I did like it and enjoyed the time I spent with it. There is only one bonus feature and that is a short 3  minute ""Behind the Scenes"" which is really a few interviews with Director and cast members mixed with lots of clips from the film itself.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5664143,5,B00BPGLNOK,Writer/star Jonas Chernick and Director Sean Garrity have created a pitch perfect romantic comedy- somewhere between Notting Hill and Annie Hall.  A great film to watch. Genuine laughs and a few touching moments.  Recommended.,1375920000,2,226,5.617647058823529
5664144,5,B00BPGLNOK,"I have to say this movie was a nice change from the normal 'boy meets girl' movie.  Lots of laughs and lots of fun.  Who says Canadians are more reserved? ;-)  Definitely an adult theme.  If you want to see an enjoyable movie with good actors, then you will enjoy this movie.  I have not seen these actors before, but they were great! Good casting choices.  It is worth the rental fee for sure.  I have seen a few bad movies lately, so this was a really nice surprise!",1373673600,3,468,4.191011235955056
5664145,5,B00BPGLNOK,"Off beat and funny, great characters, enough sex to keep it interesting, not your usual boy meets girl movie, more, nerd meets stripper movie! Fun to watch more than once.",1372550400,,171,4.733333333333333
5664146,4,B00BPGLNOK,"At first I thought it was going to be just one of those stupid wannabe funny films. But, then I rented it! It was hilarious! I laughed all the way to the end. Just as funny as American Pie franchise. Despite what others my say, I thought it was worth the rental fee. Watch for yourself, and you'll laugh too!",1372032000,3,308,4.15
5664147,4,B00BPGLNOK,"To my surprise this actually turned out to be a pretty good movie. It's not your typical love story, offbeat is the word no doubt. Interesting characters and a good story. I admit I was not familiar with the actors in the cast but they did an excellent job with their characters and made them believable. If you are into romantic comedies with a twist then I can highly recommend this movie, especially if your girlfriend's other option is something like ""Pretty Lady!""",1371081600,2,469,4.662650602409639
5664148,4,B00BPGLNOK,"Was a great movie for both my wife and I.  Great actors, good plot.  Was able to be intelligent and sexy with a little dirty thrown in without going overboard.",1370390400,6,159,4.266666666666667
5664149,4,B00BPGLNOK,"I usually shy away from independent films, but I was pleasantly surprised with the level if acting, and witty humor of this film. I've recommended to several friends. One last note, is even though the storyline is somewhat outlandish at times the characters portrayed definitely were more human than you see in a lot of movies.",1369526400,7,327,4.857142857142857
5664150,4,B00BPGLNOK,It was really funny but ending was obviously and kinda a let down.  Would recommend and watch again but probably not buy.,1369267200,,121,4.5
5664151,5,B00BPGLNOK,"light, funny, and will buy when available. there are a few scenes that are questionable but overall good flix. once again be careful who you watch it with",1368921600,,154,4.535714285714286
5664152,2,B00BPGLNOK,"The movie had so much potential. They had a great idea and they just didn't know what to do with it. The acting is terrible, the plot is terrible, there are only a couple of funny scenes, the rest is just frustrating.",1368921600,2,217,4.190476190476191
5664153,3,B00BPGLNOK,"It had some funny parts, but wasn't great.  It was kind of a repeat of other comedies, it wasn't bad, but it could have been better.",1367625600,2,132,4.076923076923077
5664154,4,B00BPGLNOK,"Very funny movie!
Just a head up though, there's some full frontal. Male and female.
I gave it 4 stars only because the main character seemed a little too sensitive.
I understand he's suppose to be the ""nice guy"" but it was a bit much at times.
Great movie though, I really liked it.",1367107200,2,283,4.2592592592592595

8572262,5,B00BPGLNOK,Good value and fast delivery,1506816000,,28,4.8
8572263,5,B00BPGLNOK,"This is the greatest indie film to ever exist. I have veyr fond memories of stumbling across it on Netflix in college, and I'm stoked I found it on DVD on Amazon! I get to cherish this amazing movie forever now, and share it with all my friends. And for only $4! I'm truly so happy. What a great little inexpensive memento from my college days as a new grad. The amount of raunchy humor is just right. I love this little film s omuch and am so pleased to own it.",1502150400,,462,4.032608695652174
8572264,3,B00BPGLNOK,"Not bad.  It's a cute story, but nothing new, and the movie is a bit predictable.  I love these kind of romantic comedies; more of a comedy than romance.  You will find yourself getting frustrated and yelling at the t.v., because this guy keeps trying to get back his first love.  It's clear to everyone, that this woman is not worth the time, but it takes this fellow the whole movie to figure it out.",1499299200,,402,4.32
8572265,4,B00BPGLNOK,Very funny and kinda sad too.  We liked it.,1495929600,,43,3.7777777777777777
8572266,5,B00BPGLNOK,A raunchy romantic comedy that dispute its over the top sexual explicitness has the touch of a great Romantic comedy that any couple can deeply appreciate. The end of the film is the most touching and will leave any couple truly happy.,1493683200,,235,4.619047619047619
8572267,5,B00BPGLNOK,Best romcom. The title and sex are a clever mislead. Heart of gold story.,1485475200,,73,4.285714285714286
8572268,5,B00BPGLNOK,"An absolutely inappropriate and absolutely hilarious. The closest comparison would be ""Forgetting Sara Marshall"" but this one is a much kinder story with likeable  characters, Good acting, good dialog.",1482624000,,201,5.931034482758621
