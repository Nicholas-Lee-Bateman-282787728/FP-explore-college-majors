Eventually I quit trying to craft my skills at this because it is just too hard and two black eyes were enough for me. But I still love this movie. I think the third review after mine describes the movie best. I've watched it with many people and most of them aren't too hot on it but I like it, so there. Maybe I'm just stuck in my tween days of twirling obsession but I personally love everything about the movie. Though I think Blair absolutely sucked and Bonnie Lee should've won the competition (baton drop and all).",1070668800,4,641,4.305785123966942
7803501,2,6300166147,Yes- Hollywood did its best with this movie but it really is fun to watch.  I twirled for ten years and my coach was actually Blair's baton twirling double.  Plus alot of extra padding.  It isn't realistic but thats what movies are about.,1043280000,3,238,4.488372093023256
