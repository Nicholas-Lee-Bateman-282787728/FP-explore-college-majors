8399674,5,B003LI7LK0,"This is not a ""traditional"" movie per-say. As such, there are no ""chapters"", just one long presentation. It has 2 stories/parts:
---The first part is a dramatized sermon. Paul is sharing his missionary testimony of being kidnapped/his plane being hijacked for 4 days, in an evening church service and the movie flashes back from him standing in the pulpit to dramatized scenes that he is describing (narration/account telling/with humor). There is music in the background too. Pretty good overall production value for non-actors. This is a great way to be reminded to trust God no matter what, that He helps us in spite of ourselves, to be grateful and thank the Lord in all circumstances, God is in control so just relax, and apply the Bible to your life and it works! He quotes 1 Peter 4:19 (NLT) - So if you are suffering in a manner that pleases God, keep on doing what is right, and trust your lives to the God who created you, for He will never fail you.
---The second part is about 3 other missionaries who were kidnapped/held hostage, Tim & Bunny Cain, and Steve Estelle (another pilot). Narrated by Mel Wyma.  We serve a loving and caring God. For the Christian on the cutting edge, you will face adversity. We're on the right side. ""If the outcome would have been different, God would be still just as loving, caring, powerful, and worthy of our trust."" He chooses how He will be honored.",1521590400,,1398,4.637096774193548

8399679,5,B003LI7LK0,"I first watched this while preparing for missionary service, and was encouraged to trust God for the impossible.

Now, nine years later, with eight years of service on the foreign field under my belt, I still love to rejoice with Bro. Dye as he retells the story of God's miraculous intervention on his behalf. Bro. Dye's testimony strengthens my faith, because it reminds me of my gracious and almighty heavenly Father's delight in showing Himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward Him.",1361836800,,512,4.885057471264368
