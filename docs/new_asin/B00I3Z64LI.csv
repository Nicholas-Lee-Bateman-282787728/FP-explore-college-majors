8638947,3,B00I3Z64LI,"Elijah Kane (Steven Seagal) and crew are operating up in Canada. Chinese girls are being smuggled in to work in seemingly unmonitored chat rooms and be harvested for organs. The Chinese may be smuggler military secrets out, but they never developed that aspect of the story as that would require too much writing for Seagal. No twists. No secrets.

This movie is actually an episode of True Justice: Season 2, Episode 2. Seagal takes down people with one to three punches. Most of the action consists of a girl on a computer chasing down cell phone locations and breaking into chat rooms.

No F-bombs, sex or nudity. Oriental girls in bra/panties, fishnets, and tie-wraps.  3 stars on the Seagal scale. Non-Seagal fans might want to avoid the series.",1388188800,3,750,4.84375
