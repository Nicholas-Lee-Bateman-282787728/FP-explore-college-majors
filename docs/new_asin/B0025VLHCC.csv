8351227,4,B0025VLHCC,"liked the choice of classical music as a backdrop to the 4 seasonal nature settings. Also, somehow, found it soothing, the way the scenes changed.",1387497600,,146,4.88
8351228,5,B0025VLHCC,"This is a very unique and spiritual journey through the four seasons....The background
music is very calming, too....The close-up footage of wildlife, filmed in slow motion,
is beautiful almost in a sad way....It feels like you are a silent guest or visitor to
these quiet sacred places....All of these Nature dvds by Randy Parthe have this very
special quality about them....",1373673600,,376,5.180327868852459
