4890808,5,B005TI5404,"In a society that slavishly worships the temptations of instant gratification, it is incredibly refreshing to view a show whose main character embodies the self-discipline of personal integrity. Add in riveting scripts, intense acting, provocative themes, and exciting plots, and it becomes apparent that ""THE REBEL"" is well worth the purchase! My only complaint is when is VOLUME 2 going to be released???",1334880000,26,406,5.4603174603174605
4890809,5,B005TI5404,"I love old, vintage TV shows.  I have seemed to accumulated several and am always on the search for more.  I had never seen Johnny Yuma before purchasing the DVD set from Amazon.  I love the show!  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes the old western type show.  Great moral values in every episode along with little known at that time actors who turn out to be top names.  I became so entrigued with the show that I did research on the show and Nick Adams.  A lt of facinating things attributed to the show and actors.",1334707200,10,524,4.232323232323233

I was a little worried about how the quality would be, but I soon found out I need not worry about that any longer. The quality is excellent and I am certainly enjoying the shows that I waited so long to see again. I hope this company will issue a second set soon. The price was very reasonable as well.",1333584000,13,385,4.012987012987013
4890811,3,B005TI5404,IT WAS NICE TO SEE THIS SERIES AGAIN. THE ONLY BAD THING FOR ME WAS THE RECORDING BY JOHNNY CASH WAS NOT AT THE END OF EACH EPISODE. IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS I MIGHT NOT HAVE BOUGHT THIS SERIES.,1333152000,15,196,3.8048780487804876
4890812,3,B005TI5404,"Great addition to my collection, I enjoyed this show on sunday nights. It was the last show we could see before having to go to bed. There is no comparison to Timeless Media when it comes to graphics and film quality ,however this production company has done a creditable job. I look for their next release date of this series.",1331856000,31,327,4.466666666666667
4890813,4,B005TI5404,"I do not recall this show, perhaps it never made it to Australia during its short 59/60 run.
""Rebel"" shows promise from the first episode though it is sad that we miss Johnny Cash singing the introductory song - his name stays in the credits-.
We begin by seeing an acting  side of Dan Blocker that is new to me having his own band of bad types, John Carridine looking on from the sidelines and an interesting Strother Martin in the unlikely form of a Deputy - if a somewhat reluctant one.
Another episode is ""The death of a gray"" with Johnny Cash playing a nasty type named Pratt sometimes strumming a Banjo - ""an ex farm boy"".
Nice production values on ""The Rebel"" filmed at the Paramount Studios in Hollywood,
with the co-creators being Andrew J, Fenody and the rebel himself Nick Adams.
But again it is a shame there was not more of an effort to retain Johnny Cash singing the lead in song,
This DVD set was put together about the time Johnny Cash left us.",1331510400,9,960,4.363128491620111

Johnny is tough,but honest and fair always helping others in need. Needless to say in the post Civil War South and West theres trouble galore.

Nick Addams co created this Character who been writing journals on His time in the war an each adventure . The show is more adult western , the stories are great  , The Guest Stars are good . As for the line up on this 30 episode set , there is no dates when it was originally shown . As for a used DVD ,the prints are good , and I received it fast .

4890832,4,B005TI5404,"I hesitated ordering this western series, but it seems to be one of the better ones. Nick Adams is excellent and the stories are good. Some of the individual shows are really exciting. These half-hour westerns are often better than the longer ones, which are not as tightly made.",1396915200,,279,4.714285714285714

4890834,5,B005TI5404,"What a wonderful example of a courage and honor he was.  Always just, humble, chivalrous, and couragous.  He wasn't still fighting ""the War"" but his own war trying to fit back into a world where chaos prevailed, never starting a fight but never backing down.  Though his Southern Texas pride was always on the surface at a glance - his uniform - he didn't flaunt it but didn't hide it.  Made in a time when America still believed in justice and that an honest man would prevail.  (The only thing I missed from the original series was Johnny Cash singing the theme song, deleted here due to copyrights.  It can be found on you tube.)",1395360000,,632,4.452173913043478

4890836,5,B005TI5404,"A great series staring sexy Nick Adams.  He tries to right the wrongs committed shortly after the Civil War, to help heal the people of both sides of the war (North and South).  Great stories with moral themes. I only wish I could find the complete series of 67 episodes.",1392595200,,271,4.4
4890837,5,B005TI5404,"I'm only sorry I can't get more of these episodes so far. This was a popular half hour program back in the Fifties and early Sixties and like most it could stand the test of time. Nick was an anomaly as he was not the usual tall Westerner depicted in many other popular series and he was a rebel figuratively and literally, on and off the screen. On screen, he was Johnny Yuma, a Confederate veteran of the War between the States having served in the 3rd Texas cavalry. His father was a sheriff of Mason City, killed by a ruthless gang that had moved in. It was up to Johnny to rout the villains, and then, finding no strings to his life, chose to leave, to ""find himself"". His adventures took him from town to town, place to place where he logged his thoughts in his journal and dealt with whatever he encountered, good or bad, either with diplomacy or with his sawed off shotgun and sidearm.",1391904000,,893,4.321428571428571

4890839,3,B005TI5404,"First of all, I was disappointed to see that these are DVD-R copies with stick on disc labels, not factory issue. Second, it is not a complete series, in fact not a complete season 1. Third, the theme is instrumental, not the Johnny Cash sung version as I remembered.

But I suppose it is better than nothing else, which is your other choice.",1388534400,2,342,4.428571428571429

IN ONE OF THESE EPISODES THERE WAS A YOUNG JOHNNY CASH, THAT I DIDN'T RECONISE, I SAW THE CREDITS AND I WENT BACK TO SEE WHO HE WAS, I MEAN YOUNG.  HE ALSO SINGS THE THEME SONG.

Good value and was what I expected it to be. Maybe there will be an official release of this great classic TV series.,1372896000,,263,3.981132075471698
4890846,5,B005TI5404,I had never heard of The Rebel before until Amazon flagged it up so I took a chance and ordered it. I was so glad that I did as it is one of the best western series that I have watched. Many of the stories are adult in nature considering the years when they were televised. I like Johnny Yuma as he is one of the good guys but he can be brutal when he needs to be and kills without remorse those that need killing. He has obviously been affected by his service in the Civil War hence his restlessness but he has not lost his humanity. My only regret is that there were only 30 episodes as I would love to watch all 76 episodes. But at least these episodes will whet your appetite!!!.,1370736000,,683,4.029411764705882

4890849,3,B005TI5404,"This series is a western featuring a Confederate soldier who wanders around the countryside at the conclusion of the War Between the States.  He runs into a lot of former Confederate soldiers who are still struggling with the issues of defeat and is able to help them out of harmful situations and psychologically as well.  The plots all have very unique twists to them and are well written.  The lead actor portraying Johnny Yuma, is a good actor, but his Ukrainian heritage shows through, which is okay, but it doesn't fit the part of an ex-Confederate soldier.  So sometimes he isn't believable in the part.  And many episodes are rather dark and include either no women at all, or a woman who doesn't have a line in the show.  So, since I am a woman writing this review, I eventually tired of the series.  I've enjoyed other series such as ""Jim Bowie"", but this one didn't have enough human interest in it for me.",1368057600,,917,4.554878048780488

Better than most of the TV westerns that were out in the 50's and 60's, this one has Nick Adams playing a rebel veteran trying to find his place in a much-changed America after the Civil War.  Johnny Cash and a host of familiar faces appear as guest stars and most of the storylines are actually quite good:  well plotted with fairly believable dialog.  I've purchased other DVDs of TV shows from the 50's and 60's and some of them are real stinkers, but this one is definitely a keeper.",1357257600,2,611,4.428571428571429

8486199,3,B005TI5404,"Because of the complete series being released, this DVD set is no longer necessary. It was somewhat odd that Yuma received so much hassle about being a rebel in Texas, a Confederate State during the war. You would expect that nearly everyone he ran into would have been a former Confederate or family member.  He would have certainly been in the majority as a former Confederate soldier. Even so, he could have avoided a lot of trouble, just by changing clothes. The set was good quality, but had only 30 of the over 70 episodes, and not even a complete season of episodes. Good enough when there was nothing else available, but now unacceptable. The 3 stars are only because of that fact, not the show content per se.",1450051200,,718,4.565891472868217
