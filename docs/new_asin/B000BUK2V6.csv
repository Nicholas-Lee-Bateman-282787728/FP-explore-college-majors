8421919,5,B000BUK2V6,"These were my favourite Christmas movies growing up in the UK so I bought them to share with my 3 year old daughter. I tried them with her last year (at 2) and she just didn't have the attention span for them, but now she is 3 she adores them, dances along to the music, and requests them over and over.

As a Brit, I had to find the UK version as any other voice for Father Christmas wouldn't do. I was also really pleased that The Snowman includes the original David Bowie as the boy from the cartoon introduction from when it originally aired on the BBC. Not all of the DVDs I've watched of this include that, and while the intro confuses my daughter (""who's that mummy?"") I love that it's there and it will be a great intro into the magical world of Bowie when she's a bit older!",1418256000,3,783,4.151315789473684
