8510230,5,B0074V61T2,"Engaging story about a man whose mother took a medication during his gestation that caused him to be handicapped, along with others in Europe. He aspires to create a calendar featuring others like himself to try and claim/reclaim themselves aside from their ailments. Insightful and at times heart-wrenching as he interviews the others about faith and their existence as well as family members. Bare skin.",1508803200,,405,5.246153846153846

I know very little about Thalidomide victims, and this film focuses on the people rather than dry facts.  I was shocked to find that they are all now middle-aged people, who have yet to receive compensation from Grunenthal, the maker of Thalidomide, and that 3000 babies died, and about 7000 were born deformed.  This documentary is about 12 of them, who decide to pose nude in a calendar.

I'm...having trouble expressing how wonderful this film was.  There is great humor, and no political correctness - everyone is so honest with the joys and agonies of their lives, with their self-acceptance emerging as they engage in the photo project.  The director himself has trouble with his own project, and opens up more as he meets his old friends and gets introduced to new ones.  At one point he explains to his son why he is doing this, that the more you see the deformities, the more you get used to them, and eventually see the people rather than their short limbs.  He was right.  After about 45 minutes, I just enjoyed watching him find photo subjects and loved the interactions between all these wonderful personalities (astrophysicist, actor, champion dressage rider), and reveled in their honesty and self-discovery.  I no longer noticed their disbilities until a woman drank from a wine glass held with her foot, and then I would be reminded of the problems they faced.  I am so happy I watched this.

There are some subtitles since many of the subjects are German, but this doesn't detract in any way.  Dull minutes are nowhere to be found, and after it was over I still wanted to hang with this group of warm and friendly people.",1334361600,19,1734,4.649180327868852
