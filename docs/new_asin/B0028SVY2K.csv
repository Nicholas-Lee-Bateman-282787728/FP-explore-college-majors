3874705,5,B0028SVY2K,"This DVD is a sing a long! If your kids like the backyardigans, they will like this karaoke style sing a long. It is not full length movies, but songs from several different Backyardigans episodes. My 3 year old loves it because she likes the songs more than the dialogue. We play it over and over again before she gets tired of it. At least 4-5 times each time she watches it. A very good DVD for enjoying music and song.",1249689600,,422,4.222222222222222
3874706,1,B0028SVY2K,"I knew what this dvd was before we bought it. The problem is when you have a child that watches for new Backyardigans dvds at the store and sees it, you can't explain it is not new episodes.
This is just a clip show with lyrics on the screen (which if you are like our family, we already have all these scenes on all the dvds, and all the songs on CD).
To price it the same as another of the DVDs is robbery. You get 36 minutes of songs you probably already have, with words kids probably can't read and don't care about. It isn't a very nice thing to do to customers who loyally purchase every product that comes out.
Try to avoid the movie aisle at all costs! If they see it, you are in for it.",1249689600,5,696,3.9785714285714286
3874707,3,B0028SVY2K,"""The Backyardigans: Singing Sensation!"" may appeal to some fans who like the show's music, but in the way of Nickelodeon DVD releases, it is nothing special. All this is, really, is a collection of approximately 20 songs from the series put together on a DVD with lyrics displayed on-screen (there is no way to turn these lyrics off.) There are some good songs on this collection, such as ""A Pirate Says ARRRR,"" ""Not An Egg Anymore"" and ""Go, Go, Go."" However, given the vast amount of material this series has produced, there is a very good chance that your or kid's favorite song or songs might not be included on this DVD (personally, I think that songs such as the ""Flying Rock Song,"" ""Nobody's Bigger Than a Giant"" and ""W-IOWA"" all would have been worthy of inclusion.) The songs are roughly divided into themes - such as sea songs and outer space songs.

Here is a list of the songs included-- ""A Pirate Says ARRR,"" ""Save the Day,"" ""Sinbad the Sailor,"" ""Ya Gotta Have Pirattitude,"" ""Viking Song,"" ""A Message, A Message,"" ""On Top of the World,"" ""We're Knights, That's Right!,"" ""Not An Egg Anymore,"" ""Everything is Filthy in Filthingham,"" ""Ready for Anything,"" ""Bad Bots,"" ""Can't Stop the Cops,"" ""Intergalactic Garbage Trek,"" ""Front Page News,"" ""Going to Mars,"" ""Riding the Range,"" ""Go, Go, Go,"" ""The Yeti Stomp,"" ""International Super Sky,"" and ""The Lady in Pink.""

Nice try, Nickelodeon, but this feels like a cheaply produced effort designed to try to lure ""Backyardigans"" fans. I rate it three to three-and-a-half stars for the quality of the source material only.

Closed-Captioning / Subtitles: None (There is no captioning or subtitles for the parts where the characters speak, only the on-screen lyrics.)
Special Features: None, other than promos for other Nickelodeon (formerly branded Nick Jr.) shows and, curiously, for PBSKids's ""Super WHY!""
Length: Approximately 36 Minutes
Cost: Too much (but I checked it from the library, so no worries.)",1249516800,34,1955,5.009230769230769

3874740,4,B0028SVY2K,My 3 year old daughter loves the singing and dancing on the Backyardigans.  This DVD is great because it mixes a lot of her favorite songs from the show.

She turned 3 a couple of months ago and still watches this DVD once or twice per week.,1282608000,,339,4.014925373134329

3874743,3,B0028SVY2K,"My kids are HUGE Backyardigans fans, and we had watched commercials for this DVD for weeks.  I finally gave in and purchased it.  We could have easily done without it.
The details:  36 minutes long, 21 songs.  Each song is only about a minute or two long.  They did put the words on the bottom of the screen so parents or little ones that can read can keep up, so that was a nice touch, but otherwise this seems like kind of a goofy DVD.  This is partly my fault.  It says right on it: ""it is simply a compilation of songs from previous episodes"".  I was expecting something ""super cool"" as my son would say, and this just isn't it.
If your little one likes to dance around to the Backyardigans songs, which granted are very cute, then this would be a good purchase.  I suggest finding it used though, as $17 for 36 minutes of quickie-clips is a bit outrageous in my book.",1265414400,3,872,4.236363636363636
3874744,2,B0028SVY2K,"DVD is short in playtime and contains alot of the ""less popular"" songs. My kids are HUGE Backyardigans fans so I ignored to bad reviews this DVD had received... wish I hadn't.",1263513600,5,175,4.5
3874745,5,B0028SVY2K,"My 2 year old loves this DVD so much its nuts! She wakes up in the morning ans asks for ""pink?"" which is what she calls the movie due to her favorite song ""Lady in Pink"". Any time I have to leave her with relatives this movie goes along with her in her bag. Others complain that its just a bunch of songs on a disk, but thats EXACTLY what I wanted. Cannot figure out why someone would buy it if they wanted a movie or episode.

This item is exactly as described, and if your tot love sthe Backyardigans music they will love this dvd!",1253491200,15,533,4.028301886792453
3874746,5,B0028SVY2K,"I bought this for my 15 month old daughter.  She loves music and stops what she is doing to dance when she hears some. She seemed to notice when the Backyardigans would come on because of the theme song, but once the show started she would lose interest just like everything else.  With this DVD she watches the whole thing and has even began to sing along. It has made our trips in the car better and she seems to really like it.",1252713600,6,430,4.168674698795181
3874747,4,B0028SVY2K,I bought this for my 2 year old as she loves the backyardigans. I didn't know it was a sing along dvd when I purchased it so it wasn't quite what I expected. Its a great collection of all the popular tunes from the backyardigans with the lyrics across the bottom of the screen so you can learn the words and sing along. My daughter and I both are learning more words of the songs as we didn't know them all before. My mother is learning them as well because she didn't know them either. It is a learning dvd for us...lol.,1249776000,,521,4.117647058823529
