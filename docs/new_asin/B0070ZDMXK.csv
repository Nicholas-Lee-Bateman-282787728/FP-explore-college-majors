8507910,1,B0070ZDMXK,"There is no guy with a knife stalking a girl. In Orlando, we have a story with a plot and subplot flashback. An elderly man (Richard L. Rollo)  is torturing Todd (Keone Dent) in the garage(?) of a stranger's house. Meanwhile we see two girls having fun in Orlando to various bad music montages. The soundtrack was horrible. The acting wasn't there. The whole film was rather pointless. About half way through things reveal themselves as we suspected. Very boring.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",1506643200,2,497,4.767441860465116
8507911,2,B0070ZDMXK,"Torture in the plot, and the torture of weak acting, made this film unbearable for me.  I couldn't get through it.",1497830400,3,114,4.428571428571429
8507912,5,B0070ZDMXK,This movie is worth watching especially if you love lifetime movies. I also enjoyed this movie because there is a twist in the story which makes it even more better. I had to add this to my collection.,1363824000,2,201,4.315789473684211
