8228966,5,B000XPO300,"I had my own heartbreaker when I lost my original VHS in a flood. Was thrilled to find it on Amazon. It's from the Southern Accent support  tour, which I consider to be their  best ever. The only drawback was that it reminded me of just how superior the DVD format is. Why it hasn't been re-released in that format is beyond me. This is the best TP live video ever released.",1362960000,8,374,4.180555555555555
