8147964,5,B000IZJQF2,"A great documentary covering many aspects of this great mystery. NOVA does an excellent job of giving the viewer a thorough history on the subject and explores in depth the arguments for and against the existence of an unknown creature residing in the Loch. Informative without being dreary and captivating without being overly dramatic, I highly recommend this for any person remotely interested in the topic or cryptozoology itself.",1307318400,2,434,5.304347826086956
8147965,5,B000IZJQF2,"This video is a wonderful documentary because it is not so much about sightings of the creature in Loch Ness as it is about what is being done to try and prove its existence. It was also a refreshing change of pace to watch experts disagree on what is in Loch Ness and not about if there is or is not something in Loch Ness. I thoroughly enjoyed the sonar search of the loch because they actually find something large and moving more than once and in different locations using modern technology.

I highly recommend this film to any enthusiast because it will certainly leaving you wondering long after the film is over. A great find!",1233705600,3,634,4.4655172413793105
