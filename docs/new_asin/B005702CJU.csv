4593269,2,B005702CJU,"It's fine, but we won't be keeping it.  I'm not a huge fan of zoos as a general rule, and the footage is from zoos, not the wild.  Also, I don't think that kids need something to be overly flashy in order to be interesting to them.  It jumps around too much for my 2.5-year-old, or even me.  I'm sure it's fine for most, but I feel strongly about those things, so we don't like it.",1363996800,,381,3.973684210526316
4593270,5,B005702CJU,"I am a teacher of special education students, ages 10 and up. They love animals, and I try to find animal DVDs for them to enjoy. Sometimes the videos are targeted to very young children and are not age appropriate. The Animal Atlas videos are just right. They are simple yet don't look like they were intended for preschoolers. My students love them. I have bought them all.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Animal-Atlas-Super-Hero-Animals/dp/B002SEQ8YS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Animal Atlas: Super Hero Animals</a>",1334102400,3,554,6.4

8460086,5,B005702CJU,"My son watches Animal Atlas every single day, and they remain as popular as they were when first purchased a year ago.  We own all of the DVDs in the series.  The formula is simple but very effective - great footage of fun wild animals, paired with smart narration and facts about the animals.  Most of the footage is from zoos, farms, animal parks and aquariums rather than the wild, but that doesn't distract from the animals.  The adults enjoy watching them too - even after many, many viewings we still pick up some new facts from time to time.  There are trivia questions sprinkled throughout - my son's attention tends to wander during those moments, but they only last about 30 seconds and then it's back to the animal footage.  His favorite part is the short ""blooper reel"" of funny animal behaviors at the end of each episode.

Our son inevitably asks for his ""mals"" at least once a day - this video series has been a lifesaver, and he's learned lots of animals.  He ""talks"" to the animals and dances along with the parrots and pounds his chest with the gorillas, so it's a pretty interactive experience for him and we feel better having him watch and participate with these vs. just sitting passively like we've seen with some other videos.  I can't recommend these enough and only wish they had more episodes available on DVD!",1391385600,,1337,4.584033613445378
