7877029,5,6304751664,This was one of my favorite shows as a boy if this is the Rin Tin Tin on TV with LT. Rip Masters - I would buy the entire set on DVD if priced reasonably - can't use VHS and priced too high.  Great show and very nostalgic for us male baby boomers.,1372550400,,247,3.660377358490566
7877030,5,6304751664,I loved this show when I was a kid and I wish they would come out with the full seasons in a boxed set. A great show for kdis. Clean and fun.,1283558400,,141,3.4375
7877031,5,6304751664,"Due to this product only being available on VHS I had to scramble to dig out an old VHS player. I watched the two episodes and loved every minute of it. It brought back childhood memories. The only problem I had was that the episodes did not include Sgt. Biff O'hara as portrayed by actor Joe Sawyer. I do wish that ""The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin"" would come out in a box set. Maybe ""Amazon"" could use it's influence in convincing that who ownes the rights to that show to do just that.",1265414400,4,486,4.180851063829787
