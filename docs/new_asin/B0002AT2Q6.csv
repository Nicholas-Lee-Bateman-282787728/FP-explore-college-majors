8025276,5,B0002AT2Q6,I have this tape somewhere and I need to find it asap. I just had another VHS converted to a DVD.  It's such a great tape that if I can't find it I'm gonna purchase it and have it converted into a DVD. I was very inspired by Marky Mark when I started to workout back in the 90's.,1510185600,,279,3.7288135593220337
8025277,3,B0002AT2Q6,Wow....what a great workout....ahem....the best part is watching Mark...just sayin'.,1465689600,,84,7.5
8025278,4,B0002AT2Q6,"Haven't opened the box because am saving in hope that one day will be a collector's item, but it arrived undamaged, and so provided the tape inside is good, I'm satisfied.",1408665600,,171,4.548387096774194
8025279,3,B0002AT2Q6,"I initially bought this tape just to look at Mark working out. As far as fitness goes, he's been a guru since the 90's and even now, he's on Men's Health cover like every month.
Anyway, this tape has some good exercises, perfect for men & women and beginners. I thought these exercises we're too easy, but I really felt the burn in my thighs the next day! I wish this was on DVD...",1227916800,,381,4.162162162162162
8025280,5,B0002AT2Q6,"I am very pleased with my Marky Mark workout tape. If there was ever anyone who inspired me to start working out when I was younger, it was this guy. They way his body looked back then still impresses me when I look at it today. This was always one of the best workout tapes ever made and I will treasure it for a lifetime. It is too bad Marky Mark didn't continue his fitness career!",1185148800,4,384,4.065789473684211
8025281,5,B0002AT2Q6,I'm GRATEFUL to own this VHS again. My original was damaged(video taped over the very beginning). I get a GREAT workout at home with Marky Mark and his crew. I'd love to see a Mark Wahlberg aerobics video.,1183161600,3,205,4.421052631578948
8025282,4,B0002AT2Q6,"I had been looking for this Tape for a long time, so I was very excited to discover that it was available on line.  It's fun to see Mark Wahlberg so young and eager when he was just making a name for himself as Marky Mark.  The video itself provides a solid workout and who better to inspire one than the Ab-Man himself!  I doubt I'll ever look that good in a pair of briefs though!",1178496000,2,382,4.0
