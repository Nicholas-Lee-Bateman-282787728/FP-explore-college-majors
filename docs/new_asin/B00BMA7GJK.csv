8570727,3,B00BMA7GJK,"I just received this in the mail today and it is definitely not what I was expecting. It's okay, but totally not worth $150.. I got it on sale for $119... Still not worth it to me.. Yes it comes with all the content they claim to put in it, but it is very cheaply made.. I thought well it has to be worth it, the set comes with 5 DVD's.. Each DVD is only around 30 minutes long (couldn't they have just put them all on one disc?).. The DVDs are in paper envelopes, come on, for 150 bucks you can do better than that.. The flash cards (which are business card size) were looking alright until I took them out of the package and realized they are only one-sided and only have one Norwegian word but are lacking both the English word and Norwegian pronunciation. How is a person to learn the words if they don't know how to pronounce them? There is no help with pronunciation on any of the items in this package.. Besides the DVDs because you don't need help with pronunciation when you can hear the audio.. As far as all the posters go.... very small.. they are the size of a school folder if you were to unfold it.. That is fine, but why not just make a small book out of them? That would be so much nicer than having a bunch of random little posters (this is just my opinion with the posters, I'm sure there are some people who would prefer posters to a book).. I think I said all I can say for now.. I might do a video review so everyone can see the actual products and their size.. Oh, almost forgot the little dinosaur plush.. haha!! Cute! but totally the size of a cat toy.. My cat is happy to have a new dino toy.. :-)",1395100800,10,1623,4.090909090909091
