1663291,1,B00005U4VI,"The Triangle (Lewis Teague, 2001)

What happened to Lewis Teague? In the eighties, he was a crafter, of good, solid theatrical releases, including two Stephen King adaptations (Cujo and Cat's Eye) and The Jewel of the Nile, the mega-popular sequel to the mega-popular Romancing the Stone. Come the new millennium and he made this, a bad, loose made-for-TV adaptation of/homage to King's The Shining. I have a number of rules of thumb for determining a film's quality before I see it. Two of them are that any movie containing Luke Perry (Beverly Hills 90210) is bound to be awful, and any movie containing Dan Cortese (Locusts: The 8th Plague) is bound to be awful. You put the two of them in the same movie, and you've got a kind of Perfect Storm of awful. Suffice to say that The Triangle delivers.

Three friends--Stu (Perry), Tommy (Cortese) and Gus (Cube's David Hewlett)--head off for points south for their yearly fishing trip, accompanied this time by Stu's fiance Julia (Polly Shannon, from TVs' Jesse Stone movies). After a credit card mishap, the four of them end up chartering a rickety craft captained by the amusingly-named Captain Morgan (Dorian Harewood, last on the big screen in Gothika) and crewed by lovely, but sharp-tongued, Charlie (The Wonder Years' Olivia D'Abo). The boys have an objective this year: they want to head up into the Bermuda Triangle. Why? We don't know. Maybe they're hoping to catch coelacanth or something. In any case, they catch the Queen of Scots, an ocean liner that disappeared sixty years before, after getting lost. Their own boat is in trouble, and they decide to scavenge the ship for parts. When they get there, however, they find that the ship may not want them to leave.

The obvious comparison, and the one everyone makes, is to The Shining. Makes sense, given Teague's previous King connection, but I don't even like The Shining, in book or movie form, and I think the comparison is an insult to The Shining. The acting is terrible, the script takes all of the flashier ideas King came up with and leaves all the stuff that ties them into something resembling an actual story, the camerawork is adequate at best (and that's the best part of the film). Harewood, the one decent actor here, has the least screen time. I guess I should have expected that.

When it comes right down to it, why even bother making a Bermuda Triangle movie if you're not going to bring anything new to the table? I've seen worse movies recently, but I can't say I hope to see any worse in the near future. I have to clean my brain after this one. *",1251331200,2,2582,4.680616740088106

1663293,5,B00005U4VI,I've been looking for this movie for ages! I saw part of it a few years ago and was unable to finish watching it so for all these years I've wondered how it ended. Now I know and for a GREAT price too!!! THanls you very much!,1244419200,,225,3.8085106382978724
1663294,5,B00005U4VI,"this movie is a great TBS movie for the disappearance of the queen of scots... luke perry does a great job as does olivia d'abo! this movie is as good as ""ghost ship"" with gabriel byrne... i've been trying to get this movie on dvd for years, but it was the hardest movie to find, i'm thrilled amazon had it from one of the sellers!

the ending is surprising as well! great movie, really!",1238889600,,387,4.22972972972973
1663295,5,B00005U4VI,"This is one of the best movies about The Bermuda Triangle. It was done really well for a tv movie. Very interesting storyline about a ghost ship. It had mystery, suspense, horror, etc. Hard movie to get a hold of though. Another good movie is The Bermuda Triangle (1996). Good luck finding it though.",1220745600,,300,4.574074074074074
1663296,1,B00005U4VI,"This is NOT a movie that you want in your collection. I know that opinions can be many, and me myself -well, let's just say that I'm not very picky about movies involving dicovery of lost liners when there is something mysterious and ""spooky"" containing in the story. But this is too amateurish, from a distance the ship looks like a papercut added to a movieclip of the sea -if you get my meaning. The effects(?) are so not convincing, the script ok, but that doesn't save this movie from sinking...

Just take my word for it! It's like a bad Baywatch-episode!",1113004800,2,561,4.5
1663297,1,B00005U4VI,"Sorry guys... but quite a disapointing movie... many things in common with ""Ghost Ship"", which is not a good movie either. A lot of ""maritime"" inaccuracies... and nothing original really! The only good thing about the movie are the excelent shots of the ""Queen Mary"", but other than that nothing special.

If you like well filmed mystery movies about the ""Triangle"", I do not recommend this one. Especially if you are in to ""maritime"" movies... steer clear!",1107043200,,457,4.935064935064935
1663298,4,B00005U4VI,"I saw this movie on tv late one night. Its dramatic, thrilling and full of suspense. I definitley reccomend this movie!",1103068800,2,119,4.714285714285714
1663299,4,B00005U4VI,"The Triangle is a movie with multiple facets... mystery, intrigue, horror...
Follow a group of friends as they make the biggest mistake of their lives, and boy have they ever made mistakes on trips. When they decide to fish in the Bermuda Triangle, something evil has its own ideas. The group comes upon an abandoned ship, lost in the triangle for years, and the evil breaks lose... The group quickly begins to fear even themselves on this ghost ship. Watch as they fall apart, and then watch as two of the originals are rescued... 4 years later...
What better setting for a good mystery than the infamous triangle, and what better prelude to evil than an encounter with a wicked voodoo priestess? You'll watch this again and again!",1014681600,9,732,4.7265625
1663300,4,B00005U4VI,"This  movie is a very scary movie. There is a lot of suspense. It is sort of fakey, but its still good. This is a good movie if you're looking for weeks of nightmares.",1013472000,,167,3.911764705882353

7954145,4,B00005U4VI,"I bought this, mainly, for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Random-Encounter/dp/B00000JGJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Random Encounter</a>. The TBS made-for-TV, full-screen, movie ""THE Triangle""[with Luke Perry]
should not be confused with three other different movies--- with and without the word ""THE"". Fair price for the double-bill.
Speaking of the RANDOM ENCOUNTER portion, THAT film wasn't MY cup of tea! The interiors filmed on the QUEEN MARY
for THE Triangle were nice though... Both, a bit schlocky.

This buying option for the movie (with Luke Perry) is better than the other one ((<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Triangle-2103-The-Deadly-Wake/dp/B004H9ZQ86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Triangle / 2103: The Deadly Wake</a>)).
""2103"" was a low-budget film with familiar faces, but UN-likable characters. I can forgive anything 'cept a movie with folks
you just DON'T care about. Know what I mean?",1373241600,,992,7.131147540983607
7954146,4,B00005U4VI,"Nothing startling new about this one, but it is well written, directed and acted so as to provide a movie that you will enjoy (if you are the average viewer not looking for any profundity or a touch of greatness). The situation becomes a bit spooky, but that is not the essence of the tale,  which has to do with love and greed. The spookiness is unexplained, one should simply accept it as a necessary underpinning for the story. The drama doesn't depend upon it.",1372204800,,464,4.458823529411765
7954147,5,B00005U4VI,"Not what I thought it would be:Three friends rent A boat for fishing excepted they end up in the devils triangle,and mystery really starts. To their surprise they come across A passeger liner the Queen OF Scots that disappeared years early. The ship looks in tacted everything looks alright,but where are the people,and why has no one else found it sooner one of many questions.",1366329600,,378,4.8307692307692305
7954148,4,B00005U4VI,"I've always thought Dan Cortese would be a great action star. Here he gets to do a few action sequences. This move reminded me allot of the movie Ghost Ship. Which is funny because it came out the year before. Maybe Ghost Ship writers took there idea. Anyways it had a nice blend of horror and mystery and intrigue. It's very hard to find, so if you get a chance to purchase it, grab it.",1354665600,,387,4.173333333333333
7954149,5,B00005U4VI,I watched this movie once on tv and it took a while to find in on DVD.  I watch this one over and over.  I like the suspense and mystery.,1307577600,,137,3.533333333333333
7954150,5,B00005U4VI,This movie is great! I saw it on tv and looked for years trying to find it.....should have checked Amazon first!!,1282176000,,113,4.428571428571429
