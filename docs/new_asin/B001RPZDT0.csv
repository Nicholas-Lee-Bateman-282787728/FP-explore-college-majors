8338568,1,B001RPZDT0,"Poor, poor John Savage- once a promising actor, now a total drag on-screen. I'm not even sure he qualifies as an actor anymore. He looks tired even when the character is supposed to rage with emotion. And, Bronson Pinchot? Well, let's just forget him. This movie seems to go on forever.",1391472000,,286,4.627450980392157
8338569,3,B001RPZDT0,"From a Place of Darkness (Douglas A. Raine, 2008)

Think about actors who, at the beginnings of their careers, had seemingly endless potential, but for some reason unknown to man simply dropped off the map, later resurfacing in really, really crappy movies. Quick, who's the first person you think of? Okay, no, I'm not going to talk about Mr. T here. But if you run through another dozen or so names, you may come up with John Savage. Two dozen more and maybe you'll hit Bronson Pinchot. I mention them because they are the anchors in From a Place of Darkness, a ""would've-been-direct-to-DVD-if-not-for-the-horror-festival-circuit"" release from a couple of years ago that, unlike most movies that fit that description, is actually not all that bad. (As a completely unrelated side note, horror festival organizers: Cleveland wants you to set something up here.)

Travis Schuldt (The Hitcher) stars as Miles Kody, a documentary filmmaker who's looking for his next big thing. He thinks he may have found it in a shadowy character named Vic (Savage--remember him from The Deer Hunter and Inside Moves?), who makes snuff films. Vic grants Miles all-access to the warehouse where he makes his movies, though he does caution that the place is probably haunted. He may be joking, but it's not long before Miles does, in fact, start seeing the spirits of people who were killed during Vic's move-making sessions. His girlfriend (The Other Guys' Natalie Zea), his best friend (Conor Duffy in his first feature role), and the best friend's girlfriend (Date Movie's Valery Ortiz) are all starting to worry about him, but Miles thinks he's got it under control. But then Sean, the best friend, also starts seeing stuff. And it all comes to a head when Miles brings in Carl (Pinchot, the best thing about both Risky Business and Beverly Hills Cop) as a financial backer who may have ulterior motives.

Honestly, it doesn't surprise me that, as I write this, the flick has a 3.3 rating at IMDB. This is not your typical direct-to-video horror flick, and if you rent it expecting same, you're probably going to be disappointed. This thing is pedigreed, folks, and not just because Savage and Pinchot are here. Director Doug Raine may have been directing his first flick, but he's been an assistant on movies as diverse as Ernest Scared Stupid, The Ghost and the Darkness, Sommersby, and Men of Honor. Cinematographer Hugh Johnson did this just after two movies about which it can reasonably be said the cinematography was the only good thing, Eragon and The Chronicles of Riddick. They're both pretty bad, but you have to admit they're both gorgeously shot. Special effects guy Matt Kutcher was tabbed for the latest installment of the Narnia films. You get where I'm going with this? This wasn't meant as a direct-to-video quickie. I can't be certain, but I think it was meant as competition to the wave of Asian horror remakes Hollywood has been cranking out; it's defintely aiming for that Asian-horror atmosphere. No, it doesn't always work, but that it does at all makes it superior to most of Hollywood's Asian remakes. It's also meant as a poke in the eye to the rash of ghost-hunting shows all over the airwaves these days, and that amuses me on its face as it did in House of Bones. This, however, is a superior movie in every regard.

I'm not going to tell you this is timeless cinema, not by any means, but it's an average horror film with some interesting concepts; given its almost-direct-to-video status, then you can rank it as a pleasant surprise if you approach it the right way. ** ",1286409600,5,3587,4.835504885993485
