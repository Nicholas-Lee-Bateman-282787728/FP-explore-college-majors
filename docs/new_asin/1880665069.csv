I bought this to go with the book.  My son thinks it's pretty boring (sorry to the author!).  It may help him understand, but I have to really pester him to watch the dvd in addition to the book.  I keep telling him I wasted $40 on it so he needs to watch it.  He is only on chapter 5, so maybe as things get more difficult, it will be even more valuable. There are plenty of things that kids don't love but are good for them, and perhaps this is one of them- I just can't tell yet.",1440806400,,561,3.8521739130434782

This is a great companion to the book. I would not use this alone for a debate class, But then again I don't think I would use the book alone either. They really should be sold together. Excellent Resources for understanding debate.",1409961600,2,245,4.590909090909091

7800832,5,1880665069,"Our daughter uses this book.  She likes the way it goes step by step on how to debate and the different procedures of debating.  It explains everything clearly.  If a child can understand it for their purpose, then the book has met its goal.",1382572800,2,241,4.431818181818182
