Watching it makes me think how sorely mankind needs divine intervention, bc our problems run so deep, and try as we might we seem to use our differences to our detriment, instead of to our betterment.",1206316800,9,244,4.674418604651163

8222373,5,B000WC39OA,"This dvd is awesome.  Being of Jamaican descent, I found it to be very touching. If you are into Rastafarian faith or culture, it is a must see...very informative on the history of the movement/faith. I cried the first time that I saw it, as it was such a moving documentary..the concept of uniting a continent large as Africa riddled with division, and the activism displayed by the youth in this film will touch your soul. It is very inspiring!! I purchased it as a gift for my sister and she loved it. A MUST SEE...",1267401600,3,518,4.395833333333333

8222375,5,B000WC39OA,"In celebration of Bob's would-be 60th birthday, this documentary/concert provides insight to the Rasta movement and its message. There is rare footage of the messiah himself, Haile Selassie, and of the Marley family in their journey to Zion.
This film shows the power, influence, and meaning behind the music Bob introduced to the world. The music and the message live. Rasta or not watch this film.

8222377,5,B000WC39OA,A clear and very well organized DVD. I love the historical clips added to show the story of Rasta and Bob. It is a very nice DVD to have as a collection. I did hear the DVD can be found at other retail stores like Fry's at a lower price.,1216252800,11,237,3.76
