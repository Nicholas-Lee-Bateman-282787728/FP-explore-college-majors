8318249,4,B001LJMAKW,I enjoyed doing the MindBoost DVD with my mom. It's very interactive. I can see how some of the exercises would also be fun for a grandparent to do with grandchildren.,1231804800,,167,4.419354838709677
8318250,5,B001LJMAKW,I've been using Mind Boost in Minutes for a few months now and have noticed a real difference in my memory and concentration skills. The 15 minute exercises are great before going to work and i do the longer exercises in the evening. Great product!,1229212800,,248,4.533333333333333
