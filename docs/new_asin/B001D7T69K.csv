3526774,5,B001D7T69K,This is one GREAT Collection of Ray Harryhausen Films. A MUST HAVE for your Blu-ray Collection.,1239753600,2,95,5.0
3526775,5,B001D7T69K,"This is a great set of movies that have never looked better.
I really am grateful for the colorized versions of these classic
sci fi movies from the age of stop motion animation mixed with live people.  These movies were always alot of fun to watch and now they look really good with fine remastering. Although this is not going to look like a more recent movie looks on blu ray.  As the previous reviewers said it is not a good thing that the previously available '20 million
miles to earth"" is on this set too.  As many of us bought that one already; a different movie should have been included.  Among the films here the weakest is 'it came from beneath the sea""  but that doesn't mean that it's a bad movie at all. These movies were top notch for their day and still remain works of art due to the masterful animation techniques of Ray Harryhausen.  You don't have to be from the past to enjoy earlier movies with their non computerized effects as these movies were top notch
sci fi flicks from their era.  If you can relate to this fact and not act like a snob who complains about the not realistic effects by todays standards you can sit back and let the fun begin.",1229472000,4,1171,4.319634703196347
3526776,5,B001D7T69K,"If you're a Ray Harryhausen fan you couldn't be more happy to see his films on Blu-ray. This boxed set offers four early movies. Earth vs. The Flying Saucers, It Came From Beneath The Sea, and 20 Million Miles To Earth give you the option of watching the films in black and white or restored color. Although I liked watching the colorized versions I still preferred the original black and white. The 7th Voyage of Sinbad is in color only.

Picture quality was a major step up from the dvd versions but we're talking about 50 year old movies so don't expect pristine transfers. What really jumps out at you are the remixed high definition soundtracks. They sounded amazing. You really get a feel for the sound when watching the Sinbad movies' beginning credits.

Extras are very good with some new documentaries. All in all it's definitely worth it if you're a Harryhausen fan. Even if you're not there's something magical watching the stop motion animation from the master of the science. These movies should start a new generation of fans. I can't wait for the rest of Ray's movies to be released on Blu-ray. Enjoy!",1227398400,66,1116,4.688775510204081
3526777,3,B001D7T69K,"No, by ""Over and Over"" I'm not referring to the redundant extras. I'm indicating my displeasure that this set contains a film that any Harryhausen fan already owns on BD, 20 Million Miles to Earth. This is a five star set, but I will not buy it. Hopefully the individual titles will be released at some point (soon I hope)!",1223424000,8,323,4.4

Sony should have included 'Mysterious Island' - I'm sure fans like myself have already bought '20 Million Miles to Earth' (the inclusion of this still baffles me) I'm still purchasing this box set, but... Sony seems to have slipped a cog here.",1217462400,32,402,4.826086956521739

3526812,5,B001D7T69K,It's Ray Harryhausen what more do you need to know. Great stuff. Unfortunately this was one of the items that Amazon carelessly threw in a box so my set has all banged up corners. Sherlock LTD Gift set was packed solid but my Walking Dead Omnibus vol 5 came with no packing just tossed into a box and also has bashed corners. I wish Amazon would get their act together. Right now it's always hit or miss with the packing.,1417305600,,421,4.275

3526816,5,B001D7T69K,"Used to watch these films on a 10"" black and white TV when I was a kid growing up in NY. I've owned countless versions from VHS to DVD, but the Blu-Ray transfer is absolutely incredible! Feels like I've just watched them for the first time. I'm a die-hard b&w fan but the color versions are really well done; I was surprised how much I enjoyed them too. Now they need to release ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"" on Blu-Ray!

And three have been colorized with RH's blessing and supervision. A plethora of special features. And crank up the sound levels for the opening of ""7th Voyage  of Sinbad"" with its fabulous Bernard Herrmann's score! Wow!

A wonderful box set! Now if only Columbia/Sony would do a box set of ""Three Worlds of Gulliver"", ""Mysterious Island"", ""Jason and the Argonauts"" and ""First Men in the Moon""!",1410220800,4,514,4.764044943820225

I don't know whether i just got a bad set, however picture quality of my discs, and particularly the made in colour Sinbad film, were just awful. Very grainy and very disappointing. Yes it was cheap so i will probably keep it, but really expected so much more having purchased Jason and the Argonauts a couple of years back",1406073600,,383,4.408450704225352

3526833,2,B001D7T69K,Colorization can work but not here. The landscapes are good but the facial tones need a lot of work. They're pasty lloking and need much more tonal variation. The uniforms of officers in the background are very badly done. Good effort but needs a lot of work.,1400198400,3,259,4.531914893617022
3526834,5,B001D7T69K,This was not a hard sell for me. I have always been a fan of Harryhausen movies. These movies still hold up and now in color. The new colorizing technique is amazing.,1396310400,,166,4.21875
3526835,5,B001D7T69K,If you're into classic sci fi movies - I recommend this Ray Harryhausen Blu Ray collection. Earth vs the Flying Saucers is one of my favorite classic sci fi movies and it was a great Blu Ray buy on this collection - along with three other classic movies.,1392422400,,254,4.3125
3526836,5,B001D7T69K,"I'm a big Ray Harryhausen fan and like many my age watched these movies over and over as a child. They are as much fun to watch now as they were when I was 8 years old. So many of these old movies have been destroyed due to editing for tv, and many scenes are lost for ever. These four movies are as complete as I've seen. I am not a fan of colorization, but honestly, the 3 B&W movies in this collection are enjoyable on another level. Seeing the Ymir and the Rhedosaurus in color is actually quite fun.

The inclusion of the Seventh Voyage of Sinbad in this collection makes sense as it was Ray's first color feature. However, I prefer Jason and the Argonauts simply because the screenplay was better (in my opinion).

If you're a sci-fi fan this is a must have.",1388102400,,764,4.226027397260274
3526837,5,B001D7T69K,"I love these movies and the colorization on these were amazing! What would have made this the perfect collection would have been to include the Beast From 20,000 Fathoms instead of the 7th Voyage of Sinbad. This set also includes a lot of interesting extras.

3526848,5,B001D7T69K,"I'm not gonna tell about the movies themselves. i'll just say that they are classic Sci-Fi films that are all presented in widescreen.
i still don't see all the Hooplah about Blue Ray vs DVD. i can tell no difference in picture or sound. i'll take these 4 either on DVD or Blue Ray. Blue Ray collection ? ok, whatever... anyway..,
What i am impressed with is the coloring job that has been done here.
the movies that were originally done in B&W are offered in Original B&W or Color option, and the color looks great. its not badly done like most. it looks natural. i definitely like B&W but the coloring is really good so i will watch them in both.

Classic Drive-In Sci-Fi Flicks on Widescreen Blue Ray with terriffic picture, sound, and with a color option, bonus features, and at $7.50 ea...

As a lot of films at that time period  so called special effects men could nor do any movies he has ever down it was the best so buy this bluray box set and set back  and enjoy the show myself u own every movie he has done collect them all.,1373500800,,505,3.7547169811320753

The quality of the colouring process, and high def full sceen view is amazing.

3526854,5,B001D7T69K,"Ray Harryhausen is one-of-a-kind and when he passed away, a piece of my heart went with him. Luckily, the world has his wonderful films to remember him by. The clarity of these Blu-rays is a fitting presentation of a great artist's work. The 7th Voyage of Sinbad is arguably his best movie (along with Jason and the Argonauts), but I have equal reverence for his earlier black and white films. Three of them are presented here in pristine condition and with excellent commentaries. They've never looked better.",1370649600,3,510,4.873563218390805

There's also a rumble like traffic noise that shows up every now and then on the sound track.  It is a huge pain to try to make adjustments to the audio delay without a resume capability.  I had to manually skip the previews over and over and over and over again.  Too much trouble, especially when I have 2 copies of this on a regular standard definition dvd which work fine.  BTW, the picture is hardly any better, and maybe worse, than simple up-conversion.  NO obvious improvements to the video.

I don't have this problem on most other discs, whether blu-ray or standard.  Whenever I do, I plan on returning the disc since I'm usually buying a second copy which should be better than the old one.  There are NO technical reasons why these discs can't be made to sync and support resume.  It's just lack of customer focus from the manufacturer, and we need to stop accepting inferior quality items.",1369267200,4,1276,5.366834170854271
3526856,5,B001D7T69K,"I loved watching these movies when I was young. He is a master at stop motion animation. He influenced so many of the current 1st class directors; Speilberg, Burton, Jackson, Del Guerro(?)(Hellboy), Cameron, etc.",1357862400,2,212,5.264705882352941
3526857,5,B001D7T69K,"What a great collection from Harryhausen!  Four movies showing his creative technique, which at the time, was the best ever.  CGI has replaced his wonderful effects, but his stop-action is still intriguing.  7th Voyage is probably his masterpiece, but all the films are done well.  I miss Ray.",1357084800,2,293,5.041666666666667
3526862,5,B001D7T69K,"Simply wonderful. And if you think you've been a lifelong fan of Ray Harryhausen and couldn't possibly learn anything new about the movies or see anything you haven't before in those familiar frames, think again:  This is serendipity, folks. Of the kind we realized with such delight when Peter Jackson surprised us with that ambitious re-creation of what the KING KONG ""Spider Pit"" scene might have looked like, when lovingly executed and edited into its proper context. No, there's nothing quite so new, animation-wise, in this RH set. But I promise you'll see detail you've never seen before, especially in those stunning colorizations of the b&w Columbia titles (enthusiastically approved by Harryhausen). And there's fan-gold in them thar Extras and commentaries.

If you've been skeptical about upgrading your satisfying old DVDs of these Harryhausen titles, shackle that inner buzzkiller and try this set! How often do old fans truly get the opportunity to spike a time-worn interest nearly to the levels of first blissful discovery?",1355616000,6,1040,5.296969696969697
3526863,5,B001D7T69K,"Fantasic blu-ray box! There is now much more detail in1080p and the color, which Ray said he woould have used if he could have afforded it at the time, looks just great, revealing many details not easily seen before (look for the blood on the elephant).... Sinbad was always in color, and looks just great in hd....the sound is very good although the supplements are minimal.... This is easily one of the best blu-ray boxes available, so get it now....then get Jason and the Argonauts and Clash of the Titans....",1347494400,,512,4.7

3526865,5,B001D7T69K,"Basically i just love having older Sci-fi movies to pop into my PS3 and watch, so these are some of the best and the fact that you can choose to watch in color of original B&W makes it all the more perfect.

3526867,5,B001D7T69K,"Like all the reviewers here, I've been a fan of the fantasy film work of Ray Harryhausen since I was a kid.  Fantastic journeys with Sinbad, Jason, and others are among my fondest childhood movie memories.  But true science fiction was always my first love.  So that's why I'm so excited that, among the many great films Harryhausen worked on, EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS has finally made its way to Blu-ray.

While it never makes the Top 10 list of 50's sci-fi flicks, I think it belongs there, alongside the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-War-of-the-Worlds-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000AOEMWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The War of the Worlds (Special Collector's Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forbidden-Planet-Blu-ray/dp/B0019NB9A2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forbidden Planet [Blu-ray</a>], and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Island-Earth/dp/B000FVQLKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">This Island Earth</a>.  There were other alien invasion films during the decade, but none deliver the goods like Earth vs. The Flying Saucers.  And it's not just because of the master animator's incredible effects work.  The story, though certainly dated, holds up well for what it is.  A jaded viewer will spot the cliches: Studly scientist (Hugh Marlowe) in love with the General's daugher (Joan Taylor), a military that is actually competent and helpful, and so on.  But to my mind, these are things to cherish about the film rather than being deficits.

To be fair to the whole box set, ALL the movies here are great in their own way.  THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD is certainly the best of Harryhausen's trilogy of film featuring the adventure-loving sailor.  20 MILLION MILES TO EARTH features one of his earliest beloved creatures, the Ymir, and uses Italian scenery to great effect (in an interview included on the disc, Harryhausen admits he chiefly accepted the job to get a free trip to Rome!).  IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA is probably the least-known film, but holds its own against the onslaught of giant-creature flicks of the time.

OK, if you're a fan, you may know all of this already.  So what about the Blu-ray discs, you say?  I own all the films on DVD (including TWO previous releases of Earth vs. The Flying Saucers...hey, I told you upfront I love that movie!), including the Legend Films colorized versions of Earth and 20 Million Miles.  And I can tell you that the improved resolution is noticeable but may NOT be enough for casual fans to upgrade.  As someone else noted, these films are pretty old.  And there's only so much you can do with them.  If by chance you don't have the DVD's, then certainly you should go straight for the Blu-ray's.  Note that each film has a wealth of supplemental materials, but these are all holdovers from the most recent DVD releases.  So the only real reason to upgrade is if you already know you love these movies, and want to see them in the highest possible resolution.

Like I said, I'm a fan.  So it was worth it to me.  I've been watching these movies for almost 40 years, from staying up to watch ""All Nite Movies"" on a local channel, to currently enjoying them in true 1080p definition on a 52"" HDTV.  It's truly a movie-lovers dream come true.  Now, we just need the rest of the Harryhausen catalog released.",1299283200,32,3428,5.418867924528302
3526868,5,B001D7T69K,"Since I first saw these classics as a preteen, to now, they hold up very well. Ray Harryhausen is the master of stop motion and, shows it even on the rediculously low budgets he had to work with. They may not be up to the high priced movies of today but, I still enjoy watching over and over. The conversion to blu-ray went very well and, even the coloration was legit especially compared to the fiasco of a few years ago. The colors held well for what it is, the only thing is, a few colors were incorrect (i.e. the USAF hats and the USMC fatigue colors). So, watch either the colorized which Harryhausen liked or the original B & W and enjoy. To me, well worth the price.",1288742400,8,673,4.224806201550388

If only more films were released like this we all would be happy little campers. 3 of the 4 films are in glorious black & white. The 4th one is in color. The 3 black & white films also come in a colorized version that fit the time period of these films. Watching the colorized version reminds me of watching the films back in the 70's on TV. While I usually can't stand colorization, the technique used for the 3 film seems to work. I also think that young children, and adults well over 30 years old will be the only ones who really enjoy this box set. If you grew up watching these films on TV, then you must get them. Sometimes there is something to be said for nostalgia.",1271980800,12,776,4.145695364238411

8292131,5,B001D7T69K,"Ive been a Ray Harryhausen fan ever since I was big enough to reach the knob (and UHF dial for those old enough to remember that) on our 19 inch black & white TV set. At the time (the early 60s) I wasn't aware of who Ray was, but I knew the difference between stop motion monsters and guy in a rubber suit monsters. I always preferred stop motion to the latter and by the time I was 7 or 8 I had become familiar with the man known to me as Harryhausen. I would search the TV guide weekly to see what new treasures would be coming on Saturday mornings and afternoon. At the time, stop motion films on TV were limited to Kong Kong, Son of Kong, Mighty Joe Young, The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, It Came from Beneath the Sea, Earth VS The Flying Saucers, 20 Million Miles to Earth, The Beast from Hollow Mountain and maybe a few more that I cant recall at this moment. I was also lucky enough to see The 7th Voyage of Sinbad and Jack the Giant Killer on a double bill matinee at my local theater. They would run films that were a few years old for a mere 15 cents or 25 cents for a double feature. At the time I thought that Jack the Giant Killer was also the work of Harryhausen because of the similar design of the creatures and fantasy story. I also saw Jason and the Argonauts and One Million Years B.C. in that same theater. Having a theater that showed these old films enabled me to see many pictures I would have missed on the big screen, several early Godzilla films, Hammer Horror films, The Gorgon, Hammers Curse, Revenge and The Evil of Frankenstein films and many others. I have owned Harryhausens films on VHS, DVD and now Blu Ray and I have never regretted a single purchase.

Okay, now for the product review, Its hard for me to review a Harryhausen product without going into a little personal history first. Ray Harryhausen, Jack Pierce and Walt Disney probably influenced me through film more than any others. This Blu Ray box set contains 4 of Rays early works with Charles H. Schneer, It Came From Beneath The Sea, Earth VS The Flying Saucers, 20 Million Miles To Earth and The 7th Voyage Of Sinbad. Each film comes in their own individual case with cover art that coincides with the film within. The 3 black & white films have the colorization option carried over from the previous DVD editions. I am not a fan pf colorization, but Mr. Harryhause over saw the project and he was happy with the results, so it is hard for me to argue with the inclusion of that option. If the original black & while versions of the films were not included there would be hell to pay! Truth be told, I enjoy watching the films in color, the colorization process is done very well overall, sure sometimes the skin tone of the actors is a bit artificial looking but in general we watch these films for the fantastic creatures created by the incomparable Master of Majicks.

The Blu Ray transfers of the first three films excluding The Sinbad film all look very impressive on Blu Ray, they all come with a wealth of bonus features including commentary, feature-ettes, onscreen interviews with Mr. Harryhausen, Stills Gallery, digital comic book etc. I really couldn't be happier with these three titles. All three films are every entertaining and have been part of my life for close to 5 decade. The 7th Voyage of Sinbad Blu Ray looks better than ever here and any grievances come from the original source material and not a lack of effort. The film looks very good, but it is inconsistent. This was Ray;s first color film and unfortunately the effects process is enhanced by Blu Rays ultra high resolution. I really have no problem with this transfer, but I can see why some have rated this title lower than it deserves because they expected the impossible. There is no way to make this film look like a new film made in these times. Back plates, adjusting for color film,type of film, lighting, there are so many factors in the inconsistencies of this film. I think what stings a bit is this is one of Rays most beloved films it not the most beloved. The creatures have influenced generations of filmmakers and monster kids since the film came out in 1958, so a sparkling flawless transfer was in all of our dreams. There are times when the film reaches the level of detail we expect, then there times when the long shots just look flat, one good plus is the creatures look great, especially in close ups \, The the Cyclops face shots are a big Wow! moment. This edition also has a wealth of features so I am not complaining at all, but hoping to justify the disappointed fans who wanted more out of the transfer.

The four films are housed in an outer sleeve and I am proud to display this box set on my shelf. The DVDs can be sold or traded as this new Blu Ray edition carries over all the bonus features and with the new improved picture and sound of the films they are no longer necessary. While I would have loved to see an amazing transfer of The 7th Vuyage of Sinbad I think this is about as good as the film(s) will every look and Im pretty happy with this set. This is a highly recommended box set for fans of Ray Harryhausen.",1500940800,,5132,4.383001049317944

8292136,5,B001D7T69K,"Ray Harryhausen was a great filmmaker working without the budgets that he would receive in today's market. If you have young children then these films are a safe way to introduce them to the monster film genre. I don't usually like ""colorized"" films but I have some young nephews who were enthralled by them. The package also includes the original black and white films for those of us ""purists"". Great collection of films with great special features make this a great bargain.",1423440000,,477,4.829268292682927

8292138,2,B001D7T69K,It pains me to give a subpar review here because I love these films.  But I was not aware these versions were all colorized.  I don't enjoy colorization and would have preferred the original black and white.  Nowhere on the box or in the Amazon listing does it say these are colorized.  Am I missing something?  Is there a way to access the original black and white?  Disappointing.,1421366400,,382,4.544117647058823
