2822462,3,B000PHX5L4,"This college hill was an okay one because of the merging of the VI and California students.  That alone was enough drama.  However, I expected more interresting bonus features.  If I knew that it was going to be just like what I saw on BET, I would not have waisted my money on it.  Plus, this season didn't give you the feel of being back in college like the Virginia College Hill did.",1209254400,,386,4.2465753424657535
2822463,5,B000PHX5L4,"Certainly , the best of the series thus far, a house divided cannot stand- and that's pretty much the story here, the key word throughout any given episode is ""segregation"" you can't count how many times it is said, the virgin-islanders( V.I. Kids) -vs- (the Cali Kids) and vice-versa, these beautiful islands feature nice weather,palm trees & lavish beaches , but in the college hill household, there are multiple arguments, a physical fight featuring a high-heeled shoe, inappropriate behavior, likeable characters (Willie, JT, Chicky,Vanessa) as well as non-liked,(Crystal, Andres,Fallon and Ideasha) Vanessa is pretty with a sensual accent, but she had an ugly attitude that worked against her, however, there are some really funny moments, this dvd also has bonus (extra) footage, nothing to write home about due to censorship and because the footage itself was short. In overall, a bigger production, location and cast of restless youngsters makes this College Hill one you'll never forget!",1196035200,,996,5.391025641025641
2822464,5,B000PHX5L4,College Hill Virgin Islands is the best of the College Hill Series. And I loved the past ones also.,1185062400,,99,4.2631578947368425
2822465,3,B000PHX5L4,"In BET's answer to MTV's Real World, College Hill features eight college students living together in a ""tricked-out"" apartment. In this 2-disc fourth installment of the popular reality show, four students from California and four from the Virgin Islands come together in St. Thomas for two and a half months of drama, sexual tension, and ever-so-briefly, school work.

The tensions between the eight students (four girls and four guys) escalate quickly as cliques begin to form among the Islanders and the Californians. Constantly bickering about segregation and the differences between the two cultures, hardly a minute goes by in all 15 episodes when some sort of beef isn't mentioned. Finally, in episode eight, it all comes to a head as a fight erupts between two of the girls that ends with one of them being asked to leave the house and move into a dorm on campus, away from the rest of the cast members. This painfully memorable scene is a three to four minute clip of eight belligerent young people screaming at each other until one girl takes a shoe to another one's face, leaving her bloodied and in the hospital.

What's strangely contradictory is the large role that religion apparently plays in these student's lives. As they're at each other's throats, with the diva-like Crystal from Orange County at first turning the house against her, and then working to get it back, Willie trying to work his ""game"" on each girl in the house, and JT constantly feeling ""tempted"" by Idesha to cheat on his girlfriend of three years (that temptation ends quickly along with his relationship), somehow they still find time to gather around the kitchen table one night and ""testify"". Watching these eight twenty somethings dwell on trivial matters,  play sexual drinking games, and worry about what their HIV test results will yield is bad enough without having to listen to them talk about their close relationships with God.

Unsurprisingly, College Hill - Virgin Islands, like the majority of similar reality shows is disturbingly addictive. Once you become familiar with the characters and their misguided struggles, it's hard to turn away without knowing what happens next. Whether the kids are headed out to another club in St. Thomas, on a trip to Miami for the weekend, or just heading to anger management classes, drama is sure to follow. Ultimately, College Hill - Virgin Islands helps to serve as a lesson to viewers on how not to behave. If the participants in the show have really learned as much as they claim by the end, then perhaps witnessing the lows of their experiences might just be worth it.

If viewers are looking for one of the most intensely argumentative and explosive casts ever seen on a reality show, College Hill - Virgin Islands serves up this kind of entertainment in triple scoops. Like some kind of non-eliminative Survivor, these students are constantly forming alliances with each other, only to have them fall apart at the drop of a hat... or the stealing of a makeup case.  If nothing else, watching deluded people justify themselves and their actions with Bible verses and blind screaming fights can be embarrassingly enjoyable in the same way that watching Jerry Springer segments can. But anyone looking for legitimate non-exploitative entertainment that allows them to watch and retain their dignity should stay away.

The DVD set also includes a bonus episode, a making of documentary, and some footage considered ""too hot"" for BET. Most of the extras are skippable, but the show itself is addictive junk food for the brain.",1184544000,7,3567,4.964824120603015

2822510,4,B000PHX5L4,I loved college hill when it was on. The ATL was definitely my favorite season. This probably was one of my least favor because it was so much drama for no reason. But it was also a good season too. I got it within a week and it plays good.,1438732800,,240,3.82

2822530,5,B000PHX5L4,"This and College Hill ATL are my favorite, I was not at all disappointed when I first bought the season from walmart for five bucks (My aunt had ""accidentally"" threw this and CH Interns away smfh)I'm re-buying it so that I can rebuild my collection, I'm starting college in about three weeks so I want something good to watch in between work and school, although this is about an eight year old season nothing is really ""old"" about it. Any way, I have no complaints I'm just a little sad that they chose to take the series off air a few years back :(",1343001600,,550,4.298076923076923
2822531,4,B000PHX5L4,"This is one of the more drama filled seasons. Krystal was annoying & I believe she should have been sent home. BUT of course BET kept her for the drama. The special features show the interviews before they got casted. What was particularly interesting is that the person who chose the cast basically said she picked the attractive,popular kids. Anywho, I liked Chicky; that's about all I have to say.",1339718400,2,400,4.728571428571429
2822532,5,B000PHX5L4,I love this for two reasons because it was intense from beginning to end but also I have family from the Virgin Islands so it was good to see them get recognition like this. A++ SHOW!,1285718400,,183,4.111111111111111
2822533,2,B000PHX5L4,"I had never seen this before but I was on a spending spree on amazon and am generally a fan of reality tv, so as this was cheap I thought I'd give it a go. Having read some of the reviews I knew there was a big fight at some stage in the series. The first episode was alright, but after that it gets pretty boring and predictable.

Then comes the big fight. It is good tv, with one housemate suddenly going off on another out of nowhere. I watched the next episode but it gets pretty boring pretty quickly. I didn't even finish watching it to the end of the season. Maybe when I'm sitting around on a rainy day and I have absolutely nothing else to do I might watch the rest..... but I doubt it. Thankfully I only paid $10 for it so not a big loss, but I won't be buying any more college hill dvds.",1274313600,,798,3.9875
2822534,5,B000PHX5L4,"I bought the DVD for $5 at Walmart today. 10-29-09

2822535,5,B000PHX5L4,"The fourth season of BET's ""College Hill"" series was the most explosive, talked about season ever! There was so much drama during this season that it makes the Britney/K-Fed custody battle look tame!

This season takes place at the University of the Virgin Islands where four native students (Vanessa, Andres, Idesha, & ""Chinky"") and four U.S. students from California (Krystal, J.T., Fallon & Willie) share a house, while studying at the University. The drama starts on the first night when aspiring rapper and devoted Christian J.T. gets hot and heavy with V.I. native Idesha, with a steamy make-out session that looks like it came straight off a daytime soap opera. The only problem is, J.T. professes his undying love for his girlfriend back home early in the episode, vowing to stay faithful. Now, J.T. regrets his hasty move with Idesha and ponders whether to tell is girlfriend about his indescretion or keep it to himself (I won't spoil what happens for those who haven't seen it.) This is only the tip of the iceburg involving the DRAMA that happens this season.

The California kids (especially Krystal and Fallon) have a tough time adjusting to Island life and often make fun of Island traditions and its people, which leads to resentment for the Cali kids from the V.I. kids. The house becomes seperated between the two groups and drama, drama, and more drama unfolds in the house. From constant fighting and bickering amongst each other, failed hookups, lots of drinking and partying, and one of the most explosive, jaw dropping fights in reality television show history, confirms why this season of College Hill was the most watched season ever! It truly does not disappoint!",1210550400,,1689,4.964664310954063

8191520,4,B000PHX5L4,I attended UVI shortly after this was filmed so it's nice to see my campus but mostly the island I called home for roughly 7 years. It's also no ce to hear the accents and the slang and see the culture shock.,1497830400,,208,3.9761904761904763

8191523,4,B000PHX5L4,Watch is when it came on BET back in the day but missed the second half of the other episodes so I bought the DVD. It's great and I enjoyed it.
