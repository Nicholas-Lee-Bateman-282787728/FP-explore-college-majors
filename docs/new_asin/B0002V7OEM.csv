2121166,4,B0002V7OEM,"This review is for the October 19 DVD release of Godzilla Vs. Hedorah, and this film is the eleventh movie in the long-running Godzilla series. The movie is also known as Godzilla Vs. the Smog Monster. Watching this film as an adult, I was surprised how good this film is. I recall it receiving the infamous Turkey Award as one of the worst movies ever made, but this is far from being the worst Godzilla movie ever made. The plot (what little there is) is interesting and the special effects hold up rather well by Seventies standards. Hedorah would be a monster best realized by modern CGI but the costume works well, even if the sludge which oozes from beneath him is so digusting as to be laughable at times. Here Godzilla is a friend to humanity; however the movie is nowhere near as campy as subsequent releases which resulted in the temporary death of the series. One negative aspect of the story, Godzilla does fly in this movie -- embarrassing indeed.

The quality of this DVD is impressive. The image is a 2.35:1 widescreen, and the image is allegedly anamorphic. There are many night sequences in this film which are beautifully rendered on this transfer -- contrasts are terrific, and it's clear to see what is occurring, whereas videotapes of this film made it hard to tell what was going on. Colors are bright and lifelike, but do sometimes look slightly washed out in special effects sequences. The film has been impressively restored, but there are still occasional bits of dust which appear throughout the film. For what it's worth, the image quality of this DVD is far better than ADV Films' DVD release of the 1995 Gamera film.

The disk contains the usual badly dubbed English language track, but more impressively it contains the original Japanese track with English subtitles which appear in clear, large yellow type beneath the widescreen image on an analog television. Sadly there are some musical numbers in this film which are not subtitled or dubbed into English. The transfer also features the opening titles and credits in English rather than Japanese.

There are no bonus features on this DVD aside from a few trailers for other Columbia Tristar DVDs. Still, this is easily the definitive version of this film on home video. Also look for two other Seventies Godzilla movies available in widescreen, restored and having a Japanese track: Godzilla Vs. Gigan and Godzilla Vs. Mechagodzilla.",1099785600,16,2418,4.849878934624697
2121167,4,B0002V7OEM,"When I was a little boy, my mother took me to see this film when it was called ""Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster.""  It changed my life because it was the first time I saw the big guy on screen.  Suprisingly the story itself stills holds up despite its age.  Yes, the special effects are bad, the dubbing is worse. (DVD features the original Japanese Language). The message is strong.  Pollution is running amok all over the planet.  Hedorah creatures are forming all over Japan.  They meet and form one giant critter that feeds on smog.  Godzilla must defend us and save the earth.  This film has been oop on video for many moons.  Its nice to be able to see it again, and is a MUST for any Godzilla collector.",1098316800,,707,4.33587786259542

2121170,5,B0002V7OEM,"Just bought the new DVD, and I must say, this movie is a lot better than I remember it. Maybe thats because with the DVD, you can watch it in its original Japanese with english subtitles (the only way you should watch a Godzilla movie) The dubbing in the 60's and 70's was so awful that they distracted from the movie. That being said, this film has always been divided. Either people love it or hate it because it was offbeat and different from other Godzilla movies. I would definately rank it in the top 5 or 6 Godzilla films.",1098144000,,529,4.3
2121171,5,B0002V7OEM,"Most people just write this film off their lists of Godzilla-films-to-see but GODZILLA vs HEDORAH (aka THE SMOG MONSTER) is a film that has, like a great wine, improved with age. First of all, this DVD features the ""international"" English dubbed version--not the AIP-dubbed version that most of us grew up with at drive-ins and television. While we may miss the familar voices we remember, we also get the original Japanese version with subtitles (or dub-titles, we'll have to see) and in widescreen format. That's a good thing, but it may not make the few remaining Orion-released VHS copies obsolete.

The film was directed by a one-time director who really wanted to go all out to create something ""new"" which is why Godzilla is able to fly at the film's conclusion. When the film was finished and released, the executive director Tomoyuki Tanaka was recovering in the hospital. Upon seeing the film, he told director Banno that he had ""ruined Godzilla."" He never directed a G film again.

But despite the film's flaws, it still remains an interesting movie with curious questions. What is the signifigance of the ""poked"" eye of three characters? Does Godzilla pull out ""eyes"" or ""eggs"" from Hedorah's carcass? How did a kitten survive being slimed while others are burned by Hedorah's sludge? There are uncharacteristic scenes of bloodied skeletons and acid eating away at the faces of Hedorah's smoke trail. And there are some very interesting segways between scenes: the montage of the TV monitors showing a crying baby trapped in a mud hole, symbolic animation and some very inventive SFX scenes.

When I first saw this film at a dusk-lit drive-in in 1972, I remember distinctly the boy protagonist playing with several Godzilla toys and wanted those SO badly! But I was always puzzled when the said ""Superman beats them all!""  Well, in that case, can I have your Godzilla toys, kid??",1097280000,4,1891,4.937106918238993

2121174,2,B0002V7OEM,"If you grew up with the Godzilla series throughout the 60s and early 70s then you will not completely recognize this version of ""Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster.""  While not one of his greatest outings most Godzilla films released before ""Godzilla on Monster Island,"" a.k.a. ""Godzilla vs. Gigan,"" were dubbed in the United States, mostly by American International.  From Gigan on the films were the International dubbings created by Toho and using extremely poor voice actors as well as silly dialogue (as if the dialogue in a Godzilla film could get any worse).  Fans of the Orian Video version of ""Smog Monster,"" which played on American TV for years, will be disappointed in the poor quality of the voice actors.  While this may not be a major issue for fans post 1980,  older fans will sorely miss the ""original"" feel of this film.",1093478400,6,833,4.7972027972027975

2121178,2,B0002V7OEM,"LEAST enjoyable of the 30 Godzilla movies I've seen. That describes the English language version (EV). However the Japanese version (JV)  was less bad (both are on this disk) which if you prefer then listen closely. The EV features a soundtrack that at times you'd think was stolen from a zany Jerry Lewis movie - very inappropriate. The EV dialogue painted a story that had noticeable holes in it - a problem the JV does not have. I think that's because the dialogue moved fast in the JV, but the EV dialogue was spoken more slowly, so naturally had to cut out details or whole sentences. Yet both versions have several seemingly missing scenes where the story jumps just enough to leave you wondering if it's an editing thing or whether a piece of film was lost. Yeah, it's just a monster flick, but it's still distracting when suddenly a character is in bandages or Godzilla is helplessly drowning in toxic, steaming, dissolving slime one minute then out and about as usual seconds later. Also the Godzilla suit had the unfortunate problem of having a head piece that sometimes moved independently of the body. I know it's a guy in a suit, but who wants reminders. And Godzilla's mannerisms were among the more human-like that plague (in my opinion) some of the other Godzilla flicks. If you don't mind watching him take a boxing stance or do some Three Stooges things with his hands and his face, you'll have more fun with this installment than I did. Hedorah was also (sometimes) a guy in a suit. That was disappointing only because he's supposed to be kind of blob-like. A similar monster from a different film (Biollante) was executed very well by comparison (18 years later which had much superior SFX). Oh well, I like Godzilla, but I'll never watch the English version of this again, and likely not the JV for a very long time.",1509148800,,1837,4.6523076923076925

2121180,4,B0002V7OEM,"Perhaps the greatest achievement in cinematic art since Chaplin's City Lights or Welles's Citizen Kane.  This one has it all:  clearly visible zippers in the monster costumes, a nonsensical plot, heavy-handed messaging, terrible music, and a cute kid that you just want to slap.  Don't come into this one expecting the 1954 Japanese original, or even Shin Godzilla (which is really good).  But if you want some camp, it's here in sludgy buckets.  To be briefly serious, the transfer is actually nice and clear, if that matters to you.  The language menu didn't work on my player, for which I docked the disc a star, but if I brought up the options while the movie was playing I could change the language to Japanese and add subtitles.  But why would I do that, except to see if it worked?  Part of the fun of things like this is terrible dubbing.  (If you speak Japanese, I can see why you might want it in Japanese.  Fair enough.)  Anyway, this is Seventies Godzilla in his absurd prime.  There are Godzilla movies that are good movies, but this isn't one of them.  If you know what you're getting in for, however, it's a hoot.",1507939200,,1128,4.552238805970149

2121197,5,B0002V7OEM,"Otaku John here to review another great classic Godzilla Kaiju movie ""Godzilla Vs. Hedorah"", aka  ""Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster"".  I first saw this back in the early 80's on Saturday afternoon TV, when I was a kid, and boy did it hook me.  Sure the special effects are goofy, but they were meant to be; that's the charm of these cult classics.  The Smog Monster story arc hits home in this day and age of environmental changes, just as strongly as it did back in the 70's, when the whole pollution crisis really began to be noticed.  It's been over 40 years and it seems society has learned nothing.  Who needs Leo DiCaprio and other celebs preaching about the environment, when we should be watching Godzilla duke it out with the Smog Monster instead?  A lesson to be learned for sure, and great entertainment you can watch with your kids.  DVD quality is fine for a grainy 70's film.  (hey this isn't supposed to be star wars quality of special effects on Blu-ray after all).  And the price is so inexpensive, you just can't pass it by.  I also recommend Godzilla vs. Gigan, aka:  Godzilla on Monster Island.  Another classic gem.",1503532800,,1133,4.5495049504950495

2121200,4,B0002V7OEM,"BOTTOM LINE: This movie has taken a lot of flak and I'll be the first to admit that in my youth I was among those who loudly decried it as one of the lowest points in Godzilla's career. After purchasing this spiffy new Blu-ray and watching it again as an older (and hopefully somewhat wiser, more level-headed) G-fan, I've come to re-evaluate this particular entry in the long-running series. It is undeniably gutsy, taking bold chances with a franchise that had grown stale and repetitive. Director Yoshimistu Banno rolled the dice with this film and, IMHO, he wins far more than he loses. And so I find myself moving this unique Godzilla film up several notches. This Blu-ray release looks pretty terrific too, so give this film a try! Silly bits aside, GODZILLA vs. HEDORAH is honestly a lot better than may have heard or read. 5 STARS

THE STORY: A toxic alien lifeform, carried to Earth on a meteor, crashes into the ocean and finds the perfect spawning environment within the abundant pollution choking our seas. Investigating reports of the strange creature, scientist Dr. Yano is severely scarred by the acidic monstrosity. Undeterred, he continues his research in the hopes of finding a means of destroying the hideous creature. Meanwhile, feeding on the poisons & waste found everywhere, the Smog Monster continues growing until it becomes large enough to threaten the world. Godzilla, (taking up the mantle of environmental champion), tackles the oozing mass of sinister sentient sludge in a no-holds-barred battle in which there can only be one winner.

THOUGHTS (contains spoilers): An interesting and exciting Godzilla film that's been dogged primarily because of two brief scenes where the Big G flies, using his atomic breath as propulsion; (yes, it's every bit as absurd as it sounds). Personally I think it's a shame (and a mistake) that those were kept in the final cut. Without them this film wouldn't seem as ridiculous (all things considered), nor be viewed as negatively as it was (and continues to be). The other detractor is the dreadful new theme music for Godzilla, by composer Riichiro Manabe. It sounds like something written to accompany the on-screen antics of a staggering alcoholic rather than the heroic feats of a titanic sci-fi hero. A shame too, since Hedorah's theme and the rest of the score are quiet good. But those two strikes against it have been more than enough to stigmatize this film, which is often ranked near the bottom of Godzilla's lengthy filmography, alongside GODZILLA'S REVENGE and GODZILLA vs. MEGALON.

Over the years I've grown to admire the film's script (co-written, in part, by Banno) which directly addresses the horrors of unchecked pollution and the immediate & potential long-term threats it poses to every living thing on this planet. Godzilla's new opponent, Hedorah the Smog Monster, is a visually interesting & surprisingly lethal adversary. Its powers are nicely varied and get more disgusting & frightening with each new stage of its evolving life cycle. A very cool, unique and deadly addition to Godzilla's ""Rogues Gallery."" Other aspects of the film that I enjoy are the interesting use of moody lighting, the surprising choice to incorporate animated segments into the narrative and the ballsy decision to show on-screen deaths, (and pretty gruesome deaths at that); something that hadn't been done since the 1954 original. Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on your point of view), director Yoshimitsu Banno had free reign with this film because series' producer Tomoyuki Tanaka was away on an extended business trip while it was being filmed; trusting that his promising new director would create an exciting - but safe - Godzilla film. Tanaka, who only saw the movie after it was already in theaters, was so enraged that he immediately fired Banno and never let him direct another Godzilla film. In hindsight, that was our loss.

THE BLU-RAY: The gang at Kraken Releasing have put together another solid release, minimal as it is. The picture looks very nice. The focus is sharp, with a faithful reproduction of the trippy psychedelic color palette; only minimal scratches & dirt and just the slightest amount of pixelation & artifacting. There was no edge enhancement or significant crush (video noise) that I could detect. The sound is strong & clean and the mix is level for both the original Japanese language track & the English dub. (Please note, this edition uses the ""international"" English dub that was contracted by Toho Studios, NOT the A.I.P. dub. Regrettable, since I feel that dub is far superior to the international one. YMMV.) The only bonus feature is the Japanese-language trailer for the film. Sadly, there are NO supplements for the English/American International Pictures version, which is a real shame. There was some terrific artwork designs used in the pressbooks & marketing of the A.I.P. cut of the film. All-in-all this is a very respectable hi-def release and is recommended.",1503187200,,4989,5.080487804878048

2121250,3,B0002V7OEM,"Godzilla Vs. Hedorah is far from one of the best Godzilla films. However, despite being continually overlooked, it does have many flashes of brilliance and legitimate creepy atmosphere to it! In fact, I would make the argument that if this film was simply recut and reedited with different music and the removal of certain scenes, Godzilla vs. Hedorah could be changed from a sub-par Godzilla film into one of the absolute best!

In Godzilla Vs. Hedorah, the incredibly large amount of man-made pollution in the ocean spawns a bizarre creature named Hedorah ,while starting out as a small tadpole, evolves to startling Kaiju size and begins covering the Japan in oceans smog and filth and murdering in mass the Japanese populace. Godzilla, who at this point in the series has turned from a city destroying atomic horror to a savior of the planet, attempts to stop this Smog Monster which unlike most foes, proves very formidable if not a more than a match for the King of the Monsters.

The film is full of weird,disturbing and trippy scenes creating a rather spooky atmosphere of dread and confusion. Hedorah himself, is creepy and his eyes have this very unusual and soulless, terror to them. And unlike in many other Showa Godzilla films, it shows people being killed. Japanese citizens reduced to skeletons or being buried lifeless a polluted sludge with only their heads visible as a result of Hedorah's rampage. Many of these scenes are shown with very little music, which is a huge positive as I will expound on later, or near complete silence. Due to the qualities I'm stating, it probably sounds like I'm describing a horror film...and yeah, in some ways this film from the campy Showa series actually has a large amount of legitimately disturbing and frightening scenes. Not horror in the same vein as the original Gojira, but unique kind of weird, 70s atmospheric horror. Had the director gone with this angle for the overall tone of the film, Godzilla vs. Hedorah would have been undoubtedly one of the best of the series...unfortunately, while I enjoy this film, it squanders the majority of it's potential.

Godzilla Vs. Hedorah is a film with pro-environment and anti-pollution message which I can appreciate as it's an important issue, especially if it's done well and subtlety... however when you take that message and beat the audience member about the head and shoulders with it and when they are down on the ground keep smashing it over their skull...it can get KINDA ANNOYING! This film has no subtlety on this point !! In fact, while characters bringing up directly that Hedorah would not have been created in the first place had humans not polluted the planet is a little overkill, having a theme song called Save The Earth play multiple times during the film further hammering in this point can be insufferable!

Speaking of the film's music, the majority of it is absolutely awful and one of the biggest detractors from the film. Gone is the brilliance of Akira Ifukube, instead replaced by what sounds like music from a really bad 70s kids show. Worse yet, Godzillas trademark theme is replaced by trombone circus music when he first appears in front of the sunset- its terrible! Some of the greatest atmosphere this film has is ruined by this abominable music. These musical changes were likely done to make the film more kid friendly, a change which seems be at odds with other parts of the film. It almost seems as if there were two directors, one who wanted to make a trippy, 70s horror Kaiju film with Godzilla involving pollution and another who just wanted to crank out another Godzilla Vs. Megalon-esque kids pro-environment PSA film.

The  monster fight scenes are overall pretty well done, with the exception of some scenes where Godzilla seems to just waves his arms in the air like he just doesn't care, with Godzilla literally having to tear Hedorahs body apart to do any damage and the way he ultimately defeats Hedorah is a very cool scene. However, the one thing that this movie is remembered for is the flying scene. Yes, Godzilla gives gravity and physics a big middle finger by using his atomic breath to fly backwards for about 10 miles in the air. While extremely hilarious that is the scene that cements it into campy Showa film territory!

This film is very entertaining and I would recommend watching it, however it is certainly filled with much unused potential!",1472256000,,4413,4.837086092715232

Weird upon weird upon weird.  Its part psychedelic, part cartoon, with cutesy music, and a heavy-handed message: pollution hurts.

The heap of garbage called Hedorah keeps getting bigger until Godzilla finally shows up.  By this time Hedorah is HUGE.  It can swim, walk, and fly.  Puny humans think the solution is to dry it up so they throw torches at it when the big beastie crashes their party on Mt. Fuji.

The best part of this feature is seeing Godzilla fly backwards using his atomic ray to propel himself as he gives chase to the fleeing Hedorah.  Fun and funny.

However, what I cannot see being an issue with anyone is the video quality of this Blu-ray release. It defies expectations in being truly well-defined and detailed, very clean and crisp. It looks significantly better overall than, for instance, most of the Sony low-effort double-packs (which are still good value).

2121379,4,B0002V7OEM,"This is by far the most eccentric Godzilla movie ever made (although Final Wars is a contenders). Made at a crossroads in the series and by a director with a ambitiously experimental bend, it's a combo children's film, ecological horror film and 1970's style Japanese monster film. It's the first Godzilla film since the first one to try and have a social message which the series by and large has avoided. The film features several horrific scenes of death from acidic pollution, mention of mass deaths and Godzilla is wounded badly on camera. Also something the series has avoided. It also was where a decision to play up the connection of children to Godzilla like the Gamera series had been doing for years already. Sound strange? Well it is. Fortunately the production has the addition of unusual animation, a hallucination sequence in a disco, odd sidebars from the story, better than average effects for the time and a decent pace to the film. Story has it that the film had a low budget and a short production time, it shows especially with some action inconsistencies but overall it's a lot better than the other Godzilla films that came immediately after. The transfer is very good (aside from a few stock TV news shots) although the legendary ""Save The Earth"" song is not here nor is the original version subbed for some reason. It's a strange film and people's reactions vary, I like it and still think it's one of the best in the original series.",1431475200,,1459,4.7254901960784315

2121529,3,B0002V7OEM,"Well, this is an odd one. Godzilla vs. Hedorah suffers from a poor reputation in the fan community. This is unfortunate. Overall, it is not one of the best entries of the series but it is tremendously ambitious, and it stands head and shoulders above other Godzilla 70s films (where low budgets and recycled footage where the order of the day).
The films director wanted to take the series in a new direction: a noble goal, even if his enthusiasm outstripped his abilities a tad. Half the film seems directed at a child audience, featuring a young protagonist, a heroic Godzilla, didactic dialogue scenes and animated sequences (!). The other half deals with weirder, sterner stuff. Forget, if you can, the absurd LSD dance scenes, the trippy music and omnipresent 70s fashion (bell bottoms!). What really makes an impression is Godzilla's titular foe: put simply, Hedorah is absolutely terrifying. He is one of the few foes in the earlier Godzilla films that seems to have a legitimate chance of defeating the King of the Monsters. Consuming endless streams of pollution, growing ever larger, producing poisonous gas, acidic sludge and seemingly impervious to all damage, Hedorah makes for a truly menacing villain, even if he does look like an upside down doggy mess bag. Notably, Hedorah is also one of the few monsters whose impact on his human victims is explicitly shown: the slimy SOB actually DISSOLVES people into bloody skeletons. Great for Kids!
Not so much for the casual fan, Godzilla vs. Hedorah is an interesting, unique chapter from the big G's history. Not all of it works, not all of it makes sense (yeah, Godzilla totally flies in this one) but it was clearly made with a deranged sort of passion, and even after all the years it still makes for a wonderfully strange evenings entertainment.",1404864000,,1810,4.899022801302932

this movie is like a combination of horror, childrens movie, 70's era, and animation. The fights are pretty meh, but the concept of the movie is still VERY enticing: Hedorah, an alien life form from another planet crashes on to earth and feeds off our (then) heavy amounts of pollution, if there ever was a Metaphor for the consequences of pollution and not caring for the environment, Hedorah was simply perfect.

Thus the movie is about the struggle of nature (in the form of Godzilla), vs the toxic monster that mankind has created thanks to their lack of foresight and care for the environment (Pollution AKA Hedorah).

2121571,2,B0002V7OEM,"There's surprisingly little destruction in this cinematic hypnotic, (IMO) making Godzilla Vs. Hedorah (AKA The Smog Monster) one of the weaker Godzilla films. In fact, hardly a hair on Japan's head gets mussed during the film. Oh sure, a handful of extras get dissolved by The Smog Monster's acidic flatulence,  a few unconvincing toy ships get sunk, two plastic helicopters get grilled, one or two vehicles get banged up, and a scant few structures get stomped, fried, or fricasseed but the destruction is so minimal the Japanese Self Defense Force hardly puts in an appearance, undoubtedly deciding the huge beasts posed not enough of a national threat to justify leaving a comfortable barracks, and missing the latest Pink Lady Variety show on TV.

Instead of the usual legions of brave soldiers, sailors, and airmen and their high-tech weaponry sacrificing themselves fighting Big G and his antagonists in the spectacular scenes of battle featured in other Kaiju films, Godzilla Vs. Hedorah demands that audience be content with a pair of undoubtedly confused, and possibly suicidal chopper pilots who apparently wonder in from a neighboring Gamera set to drop smoke grenades on the Smog Monster, and a highly excitable Japanese general yelling at a handful of electricians who constitute Japan's entire defense. Even the civilian characters seem to be underwhelmed by the flaccid aggression shown by Big G and his bulbous, slow moving antagonist and so their attempts to convey fright and awe are limited to turning wooden faces into the sky, mouths gaping like a fish who just swallowed a watermelon.

The fight scenes between the two under-achieving Kaiju consist mainly of the two exchanging unintelligible verbal insults and giving each other the Kaiju equivalent of The Finger. Frankly I've seen worse insults and taunting displayed by drivers stuck in rush-hour traffic. When the two finally do come to blows Big G only manages to connect one or two good punches, but none of his famous Karate/Judo/Kung-fu moves. Hedorah's attacks on Big G seem to be limited to shooting green spit-balls from his nipples, firing an ineffective ray from his eye-balls,  and showering the big reptile with the by products of his gastro-intestinal distress. (which is ironic because that is precisely the response this film is likely to have on the audience.)

Garnishing all this celluloid destructo-grandeur are bizarre jump-cuts into crudely animated vignettes, such as a gluttonous , smog belching factories being morally compromised by an overly stimulated, and amorous Smog Monster which are likely to leave the audience wondering just what the director was smoking when he dreamed up such a scene. Finally, my copy included a scene where The Smog Monster melts the steel skeleton of a skyscraper in total silence...no music, banging or crashing of steel...nothing...leaving me wondering if such an omission was a technical glitch, or did the sound editor lapse into a coma out of sheer boredom while working on the film?

Still, the movie has its plusses; baffling and sometimes hilarious Japanese-to-English translations, some delightfully inept acting (my favorite character is Dr. Toru Yano, who wears the expression of someone passing a kidney stone throughout the film but is surprisingly active for someone who's had half his face burned off by acid.)  stupendously silly music scoring. (What monster movie dramatic scene isn't improved by the use of a Jaw Harp in the musical soundtrack?), and howlingly ridiculous physical stunts pulled off by Big G. And finally there are some great (and completely irrelevant) scenes of 1971 Japanese dance club life.

The action is corny, along with the music, but if you are into corny action and music, then this is the one for you.

But the packaging with the title ""Godzilla vs The Smog Monster"" in big letters at the top might lead you to believe that what you're getting here is a DVD with the old American-International dubbed version originally released in the U.S. in 1972 (and later rerun endlessly on television). Or perhaps, since the title ""Godzilla vs. Hedorah"" is on the bottom of the package front, you might think you're getting both the AI-dubbed version and the ""Toho International"" english-dubbed version. In reality, this looks like it's just the latter version, which has been released on DVD before. Move along, Godzilla fans, there's nothing you haven't seen on DVD before, here.

I hate the way Amazon just tacks reviews from older versions of the same movie on video onto a new release, as if the specifics of the particular version mean nothing. Is this release better or worse than previous releases of the same film? Guess we'll never know, and Amazon doesn't care. Big deal. Stupid Godzilla movie, who cares if it's pristine, what version it is, or if it's a raggedy old washed-out print.

2121609,4,B0002V7OEM,"Godzilla VS Hedorah A.K.A.  the Smog Monster is a bizarre entry in the Godzilla series to say the least. It's full of psychedelic music with teens dancing, cartoon montages, anti-pollution messages and surreal fight scenes that take place mostly in the dark and are void of city destruction. This is mostly because of budget cuts and the death of the studios FX veteran Eiji Tsubaraya, add in a new director and you have one of the weirdest Godzilla films of all time.

The fight scenes are still interesting and at least it looks like something we haven't seen in other Godzilla films, but it is strange that there are times that each monster seems to just taunt each other. Godzilla isn't afraid to use his atomic breath in this outing either, something he forgets to use in a lot of other films.

Only Godzilla can stop the shape-shifting beast before it destroys all of humanity! While it has commonly been overlooked by fans and was even disowned by Toho chairman Tomoyuki Tanaka at the time of its release, GODZILLA VS HEDORAH has received an unjust reputation when compared to the films of Jun Fukuda. Unfortunately, much of this can be attributed to the way that Godzilla is made to look like a bumbling idiot by Riichiro Manabe's awful score, let alone the monsters' ridiculous posturing before each battle. And who can forget the gravity-defying stunt where Godzilla propels himself into the air using his radiation beam? These things aside, Godzilla and Hedorah frequently face off in a number of thrilling confrontations, even if the continued action comes at the expense of any meaningful storyline. GODZILLA VS HEDORAH proves to be an entertaining (if not clearly misguided) entry in to the series, while adding with it a strong ecological message along the way. The silliness of some of the music numbers is outweighed by the horrific images of disintegrated bodies and burnt skeletons that are left behind in Hedorah's wake. Nothing of this sort had been attempted since the original GOJIRA, although in retrospect, GODZILLA VS HEDORAH hardly seems like the proper tool with which to fight pollution. As giant monster movies go, however, it is a worthwhile watch for any fan.

2121616,5,B0002V7OEM,"It's been several years since I have last watched this Godzilla film in a long long time, and I'am very glad I own this film now, and added it to my collection of Godzilla films. I'am very pleased to say my Godzilla movie collection is a few steps closer to completion. A big thanks, too Seller (frankenberry) for selling me this film. I'am very happy with my product, it arrived today, and I've watched it twice already. Again, many thanks too you selling me this product. On to my personal opinion on this film. One of the creepiest, and strangest Godzilla films I've have ever seen since Godzilla vs. Biollante. Like I said before, I haven't laid eyes on this Godzilla film in ages, even tho I haven't seen it in a long time, I did notice the different Eng Dub track. It was wierd at first, but I got used to it real quickly. Hell! The Dub sounds better than the previous Dub in the VHS version of the film, when I would rent it from Blockbuster years ago. The Special Effects are great for a film being this old, and my favorite parts of the film is that whenever I hear Hedorah's Voice, it gives me chills up my spine everytime. The BGM is very creepy, and erie. Which sets the right tone for this film. The monster fight between Godzilla, and Hedorah is the highlight of the film, and also you get to see something you don't see every day XD. All around, this is a great Godzilla flick, and I will enjoy watching it again, and again. Too all Godzilla Fans, this is a must have if you don't own this now. Newcomers... Blah!

2121628,1,B0002V7OEM,"Critically derided as the worst in a long-running series, ""Godzilla vs. Hedorah"" (1971) is 100% monster mush. Misguided direction, low-rent visual effects and a dreadful score torpedo the film's anti-pollution message. The theme song should have been retitled ""Save the Moviegoer.""",1345939200,,281,5.878048780487805
2121629,1,B0002V7OEM,"Released between the maligned ""Godzilla's Revenge"" and the two milestones of awfulness, ""Gigan"" and ""Megalon"", ""Godzilla vs. Hedorah"" is an obscurity among Godzilla fans and not in a good way. Before Captain Planet and his nimrods warned us about pollution, director Yoshimitsu Banno was using the Big-G to deliver a similar warning to the Japanese masses. As if we idiot moviegoers did not get the message, in some sequences, Banno uses horridly drawn cartoon segments to show us the dangers of pollution on Mother Nature.

""Hedorah"" may be better than ""Megalon"" and ""Final Wars"" but that's not saying much. In fact, ""Hedorah"" is one of the most boring and baffling of all the Godzilla movies. Besides being sluggishly paced and banally written, the pro-environmental message is so didactic that it makes ""Once Upon a Forest"" look absolutely restrained. As if the dreadful cartoon segments were not enough, the movie shows Hedorah killing people in a graphic manner with his toxic sludge just to hammer its message across even more. And these aren't dummies being used; these are actual corpses, bones and all. I thought this was a children's movie.

As if ""Hedorah"" doesn't descend into pure silliness enough, the movie also includes scenes involving psychedelic drug references and a bizarre pro-hippie sensibility. In one bizarre scene, a guy goes to a club and starts to have hallucinations of dancers wearing fish masks. Later on, when Hedorah's slime nearly covers the place, it withers away to reveal a cat being caught in the midst. What the hell?

But the lowest point of the movie comes near the end when Hedorah tries to escape and Godzilla uses his radioactive breath as a propeller to fly against his sludge adversary and pin him down. How art the mighty have fallen: from a walking manifestation of the nuclear bomb to has been reptile reduced to defying laws of physics. And to think, this wasn't even the low point of the Big-G's career (if you don't believe me, I got three words for you:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dropkick-of-Death/dp/B005K8RJKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dropkick of Death</a>).

But even without these ridiculous scenes, ""Hedorah"" still ranks as one of the worst Godzilla movies ever made due to its lousy pacing, awful special effects, poor acting and ridiculous monster fights (the battle between Godzilla and Hedorah near an oil refinery is a perfect example on how NOT to direct a monster fight). Adding insult to injury is the horrifying music by Riichiro Manabe: an awful mishmash of acid rock, jazz and avant-garde, listening to this music, after hearing Akira Ifukube's thunderous anthems, is equivalent to going to an Italian restaurant that is covered with cockroaches. Ironically, when ""Hedorah"" was first released in the United States, it came in a very good English dubbed version by AIP, which somehow managed to mask the flaws. Unfortunately, the AIP version is pretty much gone, having been replaced by the inferior Toho international version on the DVD, which makes the flaws more obvious.

To say that Godzilla didn't have a prosperous period during the 1970's was an understatement. After the all-monster bonanza ""Destroy All Monsters"", he followed it with a hugely maligned children's movie (""Godzilla's Revenge"") and was then part of three stinkers (""Hedorah"", ""Gigan"" and ""Megalon"") that did enormous damage to his reputation before his comeback in 1984. ""Hedorah"" is not worth anybody's time, regardless if you like Godzilla or think a forest tree has more value than a Subway sandwich.

pollution was placed into a clear testing dish. Pollution in the form of tadpoles join together by themselves and then by the spark of electricity brings about life
itself. Such is the formation of Hedorah the pollution monster. You will have to watch the movie on how this evolved pollution monster is destroyed.

There are some very dark scenes complete with people turning into clumps of goo and bones. This DVD is the best version of this film released so far in terms of picture quality.  The only thing I didn't care for is when Godzilla starts to fly near the end of the film and they used the Godzilla suit from this period which looks like a fierce cookie monster. They could have cut the flying scene which could have been an easy edit. To bad they didn't leave this option in the main menu. Some people don't care for this flick. It is beyond weird for Godzilla standards yet that is why it holds up better then the other Toho films from this period.  Give it a chance and let us know what you think.

2121632,3,B0002V7OEM,"By 1971, the Godzilla series had become rather stale. To solve this problem and attract more numbers to theaters, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka recruited newcomer director Yoshimitsu Banno to helm the project and co-write the screenplay. For better or for worse, Banno certainly made his mark in this film, whose primary theme is an ecological warning about the dangers of pollution, something that the general public first became aware of in the late 1960s. The first Earth Day had been celebrated on April 22, 1970 so the time seemed right for the Godzilla series to address this important issue, just as war and nuclear weapons were covered in the first Godzilla film back in 1954. Godzilla vs. Hedorah was a plan to return to its roots, to bring relevancy back to a series that had long become irrelevant.

The implementation of this plan is quite another story altogether because Godzilla vs. Hedorah (or Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster as it was known here in the U.S.) is easily the most bizarre Godzilla film ever made. There are some very unsettling images of pollution and carnage, but whenever the film gets close to becoming serious about its message, the message is then sabotaged by some of the weirdest action and misguided decisions ever in a Toho kaiju film. Animated interludes, psychedelic rock music, poetic imagery (a broken clock in a sea of oil and garbage), an elementary school lesson about stars and nebulas, and an acid trip resulting in a fish head hallucination in a discothque combine to create a wild hodgepodge of a film. Oh yeah, and Godzilla flies in this one, using his atomic breath as jet propulsion.

The grand music of Akira Ifukube is sorely missing, replaced with marching band music by Riichir Manabe. Fortunately, he would return to score only 1 more Godzilla film, the dismal Godzilla vs. Megalon (1973).

Despite all its drawbacks, one has to admire director Yoshimitsu Banno for being gutsy enough to make a Godzilla movie that dared to be this level of different. I wouldn't want all Godzilla films to be like this, but I'm glad it's there in the canon.

So how does this new DVD compare to the original Sony release? As far as the video, it's neither better nor worse than the image quality of the Sony release, which was already pretty good. The flier design is an improvement in my opinion, being similar to Classic Media's cover designs, with the original Japanese poster and both the Japanese and American titles on the cover. The plot synopses are cool and good for a chuckle. As for extras, there is only the original Japanese trailer with subtitles. But the Sony dvds didn't even have that. Menus are a step up too.",1301270400,2,2663,4.782608695652174

2121634,3,B0002V7OEM,"I don't know if I should call this movie refreshing, disturbing, a work of diamond-in-the-rough art, or simply a film to watch if you're on something. Something very strong I might add. Perhaps it's all of those wrapped in a messy yet effortful presentation. Some look at the rating I gave it and probably remark, ""Is he high?"" No, I am not. Compared to the MechaGodzilla films of the 70s era, this movie remarkable holds its own. Although I will never say it really surpassed the epic ""Terror of MechaGodzilla"" by far.

First off, let me say this, Sony is over-childizing the marketing on these DVDs. Films like this, along with ""Godzilla vs. MechaGodzilla II"" (with all its blood and coarse language), are far from a PG rating. This film is remarkably dark on both ends: (1) we see many disturbing shots, like crowds of people killed at once by inhaling sulfuric mist, leading to complete skeletazation later, (2) A shot of bodies half submerged in Hedorah's goop, (3) The main scientist has his face badly malformed by acid very early in the film. I wouldn't recommend to the too young of viewers. So, all in all, I give this film a decent rating. All those rating six and lower are too hard on the film. Appreciate it as a different type of G-film and a memorable trip back to the 70s.",1295481600,,1289,4.556034482758621
2121635,4,B0002V7OEM,"Yes, this movie is silly and perhaps aimed at a younger audience than some Godzilla movies, but it is still quite watchable 28 years later in 2010 and it has a solid plot.

All in all I think the film stands up well. Yes, it is a bit boring but it is a Godzilla movie. Personally I marvel at what the creators of the movie were able to create with what they had back then. Yes, I can tell when I see a model ship or toy trucks and so on but one has to put stuff like that aside and go with the story. The special effects are quite good for the genre and for the time. I bought this movie on vhs for one dollar at the thrift store. I know I got my money's worth. I also bought ""Son of Godzilla"" and another Godzilla movie with a three headed monster.

2121648,5,B0002V7OEM,"My ordered this movie from Amazon put a sly, secret smile on my face for the two weeks it took to arrive.  I remember the movie well from a single rental when I was 9 years old (over 20 years ago).  For years after, anytime the sky would be dark and menacing at around dusk with low visibility, I would be afraid that I might see the smog monster looming dimly in the distance.  Hedorah is literally a monster made of (human-produced) filth.  Effects-wise, certain scenes, especially near the beginning, definitely fail to convince -- that's just par for the course with old monster movies.  But as the film develops, thankfully the effects become increasingly convincing.  I haven't see half the G-films, but I can still assume that this monster is surely the CREEPIEST of them all!!  I think the director did well at eliciting dread and hopelessness in his audience in many scenes, which adds to the impression of how truly powerful this monster is.  Like when people throw torches at it, and they appear as mere harmless glowing cinders in front of its face, and it doesn't even flinch -- it just stands there looking at you creepily and powerfully.

The fight scene isn't over when you think it is, and I'm not sure that's a good thing, given that it just caused me and my wife confusion, more than gladness that it (somehow) wasn't yet over.  Lots of exactly-repititious scenes in the final third of the film give the feeling that the director was trying to stretch the film over the feature-length threshold.  Still, this film is so original, and so creatively successful at being what it means to be, who can say it isn't a one-of-a-kind classic creep-fest?!",1277251200,,1665,4.667808219178082
2121649,3,B0002V7OEM,"It was such a big deal when Godzilla movies showed up on TV in the 60's and 70's. Now, nearly all those movies are readily available today. Whenever I see one again, memories of my youth come flooding back. I can see myself reflected in my 11-year-olds, who are much bigger fans than I was, I must say. Hedorah, or Hedra, as it was known back then, was unique for its combination of animated vignettes and a hip, mod anti-pollution message. However, even when I was myself 11 (in 1972), I knew that this movie was high-camp. That Godzilla could fly seemed pretty silly to me, but my twins were really impressed. Hedorah has become a favorite toy of theirs (they have 2 versions of this figure), and have created a YouTube video called ""Godzilla vs. the Smog and Sea Monsters"" with their toys.",1270944000,,792,4.506944444444445
2121650,4,B0002V7OEM,"A gigantic, tadpole-like creature appears in polluted Japanese coastal waters, and Dr. Yano, a biologist, ventures underwater to investigate the horror. His encounter with the monster proves nearly fatal, for the creature burns him with an emission of concentrated sulfuric acid. Soon, Hedorah, as the thing is called, metamorphoses into a gigantic amphibian that consumes the very pollution emitted by Japanese factories. Godzilla arrives and engages the monster in battle, but is unable to destroy this creature composed of living sludge. Undergoing even further transformation, Hedorah takes to the air, spraying deadly sulfuric acid in its wake. Godzilla and the military quickly find themselves in a violent, all-out battle to prevent the total destruction of Japan.

Frequently ranking as one of the most bizarre motion pictures ever made, Godzilla vs. Hedorah (a.k.a. Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster) is an anomaly in the series, its story unapologetically ""socially relevant,"" its style nothing less than experimental. Moments of exceptionally brutal violence are interspersed with bizarre humor, cartoon animation, and psychedelic hallucination sequences. Plus there's Godzilla.

The anti-pollution message in Godzilla vs. Hedorah comes across like a flashing neon sign, but the smog monster itself is one of Toho's most fascinating creations. Despite its undeniable air of silliness, the movie features a grimmer, darker undertone than in any since the original 1954 Godzilla. Like the rest of the Sony Godzilla 50th Anniversary releases, the DVD offers a beautiful, widescreen print of the original Japanese version with English subtitles.",1265500800,,1648,5.722448979591837
2121651,5,B0002V7OEM,"Growing up in the 1970's we were innundated with anti-pollution icons like the Owl with his ""Give a Hoot, Don't Pollute"" slogan, or Iron Eyes Cody shedding a single tear when a litterbug throws some trash from his speeding car...but the one I remember most vividly was Godzilla's Hedorah! This greyish slimy ooze monster was truly disgusting, and seeing Tokyo's polluted waters, the dead fish floating among the discarded mannequins and slime...YUCK!

The basic story here is that thanks to mankind's pollution a mutated space tadpole grows to gargantuan size and threatens Japan and the Earth. Our only hope lies in Godzilla protecting us from the acid spewing creature. Hedorah is a pretty nasty foe for the giant lizard. Made of sludge, Godzilla's powerful punches are all but useless against the ooze monster, more often than not passing right through the creature without doing any harm. Hedorah can spit wads of goo which burn will burn through almost anything and Hedorah can also turn himself into a flying spaceship-type thing that leaves a poisonous gas in its wake, killing everything on the ground below. Can Godzilla stop Hedorah before all of Earth is covered in a cloud of noxious gas???

This was always one of my favorite Godzilla films growing up. You had the cool late 60's early 70's Japanese rock music sprinkled throughout the film, some nifty little animated sequences, a pretty inventive monster with some unusual powers, and one of the first films I can remember where the monster targets humans specifically, not just causing havoc by flattening buildings or sinking ships (though there is also plenty of that as well) but actually doing it's best to kill any human bystanders it sees. I love the moment when Hedorah attacks a freeway, or when some Japanese kids are rocking out on Mount Fuji and Hedorah decides to crash the party. This is a pretty imaginitive flick, and if you haven't seen it since Creature Features ran on the UHF channels, you should give this one another viewing.

I am well aware that Hedorah looks (and sounds) like he is taking a hit off a titanic bong when he inhales the smoke from the smoke stacks(all red eyed & laid back even).  Yep, those are electric instruments, powered by what must be the longest extension cord in the world, being played by hippies so concerned about the environment, they light a bonfire big enough to burn down a house.  Yes, yes... All of this is true.  However, I love this movie.  Why?  Because it's fun in its own weird way.  Perhaps it helps that I saw this film every year around Thanksgiving as a child.  I would spend hours entranced by WOR's Thanksgiving marathons of King Kong & Godzilla films.  Hedorah was always the capper.  I have many fond memories of watching scenes of Godzilla battling a giant pile of sludge set to a groovy 70s soundtrack.  No, it's not a great movie but, you know what?  I still love it.  And, while I am confessing... I really like Hedorah as a monster.  Yes, I know.  I should be ashamed but.. I'm not!  This is one crazy G film.  See it.  Dig it.

2121654,3,B0002V7OEM,"Out of every godzilla film I've seen, I would definitly say this is the wierdest. The story is good and actually quite effective. If we continue to pollute our planet, this is what could happen.
Hedorah himself actually looks very good, and he goes through more than one form. Big G is kinda goofy, with big eyes and a plain suit. I noticed he swayed and stood alot, with this really wierd music playing while he did so. The battles aren't great, and the characters are completely random (as usual).
At the very beginning, this kid comes out and starts playing with his godzilla toys. What he does with them is put them at the top of his slide, watch them slide down , go get them and do it again. That part made me laugh.
As much of the movie was funny as it was scary. The monster (hedorah) was tougher than one may have thought, and godzilla had some trouble. There are no other kaiju in this film, just Hedorah and Godzilla. It probably wouldn't be much better even if every giant monster was in it. On second thought, that could have been cool.
To sum up, it isn't the best Godzilla film at all, but other ones from the same series such as Godzilla vs. Gigan and Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla are much better. Of course you can always check out the other series, and in particular the newest ones from the millenium series, such as Godzilla against Mechagodzilla, Godzilla Tokyo S.O.S or Godzilla final wars.

I actually find the animated sequences and the psychadelic freak-out sequences to HELP the movie rather than hinder it, as this is a total product of a late 60's/early 70's mindset, so why shouldn't it look like one?  Even though the earlier films like ""Mothra"" strike a more nostalgic chord with me, this one is my favorite to sit down and actually watch all the way through.",1246752000,,951,4.52906976744186
2121656,4,B0002V7OEM,"I'm a Godzilla movie fan (only the old cheesy ones 1960s-1980s) because I used to watch them around the holidays growing up.  Recently I decided to start a small collection of favorites and this was one of them.  Believe me, there is no shortage on weirdness in this one!  Starting with animated cartoons of Hedorah sprinkled throughout the movie to unusual sound editing and strange 1970's trippy disco scenes, Godzilla vs Hedorah hits high on the strangeness scale!

All sillliness aside, an interesting aspect to Godzilla vs Hedorah is how the movie attempts to raise environmental awareness regarding global pollution.  The cheesiest way possible, but nevertheless it drives a good point home.  The movie's solution was through a monster named Hedorah who goes around Japan finding sources of pollution and literally gobbles it up.  Unfortunately through the process of traveling from city to city, Hedorah emits a noxious gas crippling or killing all people in its path.  Naturally, Godzilla is there to save the people of Japan from dying horrible deaths!!!

Why 4 stars?:
Although I was impressed by the eco-awareness of the movie, I gave Godzilla vs Hedorah 4 out of 5 stars because I was disappointed at the sound editing.  During scenes where Godzilla destroys buildings it seems like you are watching a silent movie!  Not a single sound is present-- not even background music, it's like your TV is on mute.  Times when background music is present, it seems very out of place.  Example: Disco music playing while Godzilla is looking for (and going to fight) Hedorah.

Bottom Line:
I'd recommend it for its cheap price and crazy hijinx.  It's a good buy (and great laugh) for anyone who likes the old-style Godzilla movies.",1236988800,,1732,4.986062717770035

Even the music wasn't the classical Godzilla music we heard in the 1960s. The director never did another G film. The effects in this movie are ok to good for the most part, particularly the flying Hedorah and the explosions and what happens when he flies overhead. Hedorah is a very cool monster. With all his looks & different stages/forms he makes as it grows are pretty cool.

If you own the VHS tape of Godzilla vs the Smog Monster keep it. This is the movie with the song Save the Earth (sung in Japanese in this INTL dubbing) This also contains the alternate ending with the words ""Will there be Another"" and another Hedorah head popping up in a still shot.

2121683,5,B0002V7OEM,"A strange Godzilla movie. I saw ""Godzilla Vs. The Smog Monster"" in the movies  in 1972. The dubbing is not very good, but the high definition remastering is incredible despite some of the movies dark lighted scenes. The anomorphic widescreen presentation of this film is awesome. ""Save The Earth"" is not sung in english (RATS!!!!) as it is sung in Japanese, it doesn't matter as I know the words from my childhood days. Yoshimitsu Bano the director of Smog Monster would be directing this movie as it would be his last for Toho Pictures. Yoshimitsu Banno angered Toho studios so much because they wanted a child orientated Godzilla movie. What Banno gave them was a crying baby trapped in the Hedorahs deadly sludge, knowing full aware that the baby was eventually to die. Another disturbing scene was when Hedorah flies over some people they are incinerated and turn to bones. A crying cat in a night club was trapped in sludge as you were aware of its final outcome.  The drug, pot smoking hippies were cool in their night club scene with their dancing to the Psychedelic lighted back drop. The thing that was really interesting and facinating was the animated explanations about the Hedorah and pollution. The music score by Riichiro Manabe for this movie was really cool and far out there. My favorite part of the music score was towards the end when Godzilla flies after Hedorah (the drum roll as Godzilla takes off and than the big horns and the organ rip as Godzilla catches up to Hedorah).
Toho was concerned about offending children with this Godzilla release due to some graphic scenes. No Godzilla movie before Smog Monster was ever as graphic and offensive as this one, and this was in my opinion Godzillas whimp stage in his movie career as Toho tried to make Godzilla more human like to appeal more to children. What a mistake that was, as I am not crazy about the Godzilla mask in this installment of the Godzilla films. If you look when Godzilla is wallowing in the mud pit that Hedorah dropped him in, you could see the Godzilla mask from ""Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster 1966"". This is definintly not one of my favorite Godzilla movies but I enjoyed this movie for it's message about pollution and its dark message of profit despite the pollution it creates. This same message (pollution) was used in Godzilla Vs. Mothra (1964) but clearly more visible in Smog Monster. I also enjoyed the creativity that went into the production of this movie. Yoshimitsu Banno presented a grim message about pollution and was banned from Toho pictures after ""Godzilla Vs. Hedorah"" but he really tackled a growing pollution problem in Japan at the time of this pictures production and release. There are no extra materials on this dvd release, but it is worth buying for the high definition widecreen presentation and clear sound. ""Godzilla Vs. Hedorah"" is embarassing at times, but an oddly, facinating, interesting Godzilla movie. Even Godzilla was a Hippie, HAA!!, HAA!!, HAA!!, HAA!!............",1170460800,,2998,4.842105263157895
2121684,3,B0002V7OEM,"Godzilla vs Hedorah is insane even by later Showa era Godzilla standards, a surreal mix of monster mash, message movie, kiddie flick, 1960s educational shorts, groovy protest songs, go-go dancers wearing fish masks, terrible special effects and basic Sesame Street style animated inserts as Friend of the Earth Godzilla takes on a giant toxic flying tadpole that craps acid on him, drowns mah-jong players in excrement and farts deadly toxic fumes over the population of Japan. Avante garde doesn't cover it: this is Godzilla on acid and it's a real happening, baby. The big feller even gets to fly in one scene.

Despite getting a great entrance in front of a rising sun while introduced with a slide trombone theme straight out of a Laurel and Hardy get drunk comedy, Godzilla has never looked camper (well, at least until Godzilla vs. Megalon), mincing his way through his underpowered punchups with the allegorical scheissencritter - Hedorah is basically just a vertical turd with a tail and glowing red eyes. It's tempting to believe from the number of times Mr G wipes his nose that this was during the big feller's cocaine period, but he seems all too aware of the humiliation: at one point he even turns to the camera and shakes his head to the audience in disbelief.

Co-writer-director Yoshimitsu Banno had been an assistant director on Kurosawa films before being hired to revitalize the Godzilla series while its producer Tomoyuki Tanaka was in hospital only to be suspended from the studio after they looked on with horror what he had wrought, but is currently writing next year's IMAX Godzilla 3D. The mind boggles...

As others have noted, for those who want to watch the film dubbed, the English soundtrack is one prepared by Toho rather than the one used for AIP's re-edited version of the film, Godzilla Vs The Smog Monster.

This DVD has the horrible Toho International dubbing which at this time their dubbing was just bad, in later films they start doing a better job but here it's just horrid. The AIP cut sounds so much better, the voices fit much better and the ""Save the Earth"" song is translated!

After viewing a few after many years I seem to enjoy them more now than when I did as a kid.  Hedorah has always been my personal fave just coz it's pretty oddball(even by Godzilla standards) and stands out from the rest of the films with it's psychedelic hippiness and short animated scenes.  Hedorah may not be as badass looking as Godzilla's other foes, but he's a tough mother.  Hell, he beats the snot out of Godzilla.  Godzilla needs to enlist the help of the humans to defeat the thing.  Reading over the negative reviews of this film, all I can do is scratch my head.  How the hell do you criticize a Godzilla film?  A Godzilla film criticized for having fake looking monsters?  For having badly dubbed english dialogue?  Weren't these the very things that made the Godzilla films entertaining?  You might as well criticize the old John Waters films coz the acting was bad and they were offensive.  Even Leonard Maltin called this film, ""Dubbed and Daffy"".

2121698,4,B0002V7OEM,"This movie is different to other G movies, as it is, despite what many people (mostly teenagers, who aren't exactly known for researching things)would tell you, the only G movie to be aimed at kids*. This is something the director was fired over, mainly because  most of the intended audience were given something aimed at people considerably younger than themselves. This also resulted in a lower budget the following years, resulting in G vs Gigan and G vs Megalon relying on more stock footage than usual.

Anyway, this movie involves a pollution monster, Hedorah, who is mutating by absorbing more pollution. At first, many Hedorah's exist ina a tadpole-like form, but they join together to form a large quadruped creature. Although the creature's body is potentially fatal to humans, G is unaffected by direct contact with Hedorah during their battle, although acidic mud fired by Hedorah is capable of burning him. Furthermore, when G tries to punch Hedorah, his arm goes through Hedorah's body with no effect... [more stuff happens after this, obviously, but to avoid  spoiling the movie, I am only writing very the general idea of the first 30 minutes or so, and not mentioning anything that happens after that at all.)

Being aimed at a considerably lower aged audience than other G movies, there is considerably more corny stuff that happens in this than in other G movies (although i'm not denying that other G movies have corny stuff in them, but they have a lot less than this). Despite that, the movie does have tension and the the fight scenes are at most times better than what happens in G vs Mecha G. Probably because Hedorah doesn't sit back firing away for almost the whole battle.

* - G movies, not counting this one, have never been aimed at kids. However, Gamera movies are aimed at kinds. While we're on the subject of Japanese TV censorship, despite what many teenages from America and some other countries would try to tell you, there has NEVER been an Amine show aimed at adults.",1144022400,,2007,4.805797101449276
2121699,5,B0002V7OEM,"This movie is crazy, but I love it!!

From man's pollution, the evil Hedorah is spawned, and only Godzilla can save us!

This has to be the most darkest film of the Showa Era, and the most unique. It holds the dark aspect of the original Godzilla by introducing a similiar threat:Hedorah, a monster of pollution both figuratively, and literally. Hedorah represents the result of waste, and what may happen if we continue to pollute the earth. This monster is actually shown as a threat like the original Godzilla by burning people, crushing cities. The difference between Hedorah and the other foes Godzilla faces is that you see the horrors of Hedorah, while as in other movies you just had to assume the people died. The scenes where Hedorah melts the skin of people is disturbing and none the less, it's used effectively. Godzilla may have turned to a campy hero, but it suits the movie well. I find both sides of Godzilla, the monster and hero, good aspects. The human cast is good, especially the scientist. The most boring characters are that of Yukio and his girlfriend. The special effects are really good for a movie of the time. The Hedorah suits and attacks are awesome and Hedorah's flying form looks effective because you don't see the wires. Godzilla looks a little beat up, but grand none the less. There is NO stock footage in this movie which is a big plus in my book. I hate stock footage in a movie. And the music, although odd, is suited well for this movie. It's nowhere near Akira Ikufube though.

Yoshimitsu Banno was sadly banned from making another Godzilla film after this. But know this- Yoshimitsu Banno made a great Godzilla Film. I really appreciate his efforts!

I know a good although odd Godzilla film when I see one.

Give this movie higher reviews!

2121700,5,B0002V7OEM,"I first saw this film when I was just a mere 5 year old tyke, and then again when I was about 9.  I remember both of those viewings well, and have seen it numerous times since then.

Godzilla vs. Hedorah was born during Godzilla's infamous, corny, and non-serious period of his life known as the ""Dark Age"" of Godzilla films.  During this period, the quality of the films had been dropping drastically and the appeal to general viewers had plummeted.  This film, however, displayed a very noticeable difference in regards to the previous films, and remains the most bizarre, and unique G-film in the great history of Godzilla.

One major difference many viewers will likely notice (who are familiar with many of the other Showa films of the 60's and 70's), is the tone set in the movie.  All the films prior to this film, with the exception of the original, were easily notable for their somewhat ridiculous stunts and plots, and incredibly poor quality and low budgets.  They also seemed to lack any true message anymore and had moved away from the allegory-style original Godzilla and made simply for kids and their viewing pleasure (the main reason the original series was ended).  Yoshimitsu Banno, the new director selected for the film, really increased the tone for this film.  The film was very dark in contrast to the previous films, and displayed graphic images of death and terror not seen since the masterpiece, Gojira (1954).  The amount of campy humor commonly found in typical Showa films, was greatly reduced for the film, though manages to preserve just enough to retain its nostalgic feel.  Godzilla vs. Hedorah was also the first Godzilla film to feature a true, heavy message about mankind and its sins against nature in years.  The original Godzilla was about mankind being punished for crimes against nature and the embodiment of the nightmares and horrors faced by the Japanese people in a massive, unstoppable beast.  In this film, the message is very similar, yet this time, the death-spawned Hedorah is the containment of pollution and its negative side-effects and what will happen to mankind if they do not cease their destructive and reckless ways.  Also, this film has more impact and horror in one respect: that is, pollution is everywhere and affects life on a world-wide level.  Godzilla symbolically represented mankind's futile efforts to solve their pollution problems and just how hard it is to cleanse themselves of the obviously permanent damage done to the earth (which explains Hedorah's indestructibility).  However, there is a degree of campiness still present, mainly because Banno wanted children to be exposed to this message as well, and knew that an all-dark, graphic, nightmarish film would not be suitable for young viewers.  He was also well-aware of the reputation Godzilla had among children to begin with, and knew Godzilla must retain many of the most familiar qualities.  It is surprising, though, that this film didn't receive a higher rating due to drug references, and the overall graphic nature of the film.

Perhaps readers are wanting more specific details of the movie itself and not just the symbolic perspectives on Godzilla as a whole?

Well, first off, this film is definitely a worthwhile purchase and makes both a great popcorn movie, and a sick-in-bed movie, so it's enjoyability is a versatile one indeed and conforms to many different environments and moods.  The plot of pollution taking the form of a horrible sludge demon and annihilating much life on earth is simple, but effective and entertaining nonetheless.  Godzilla himself puts up a great performance, while still being rooted to the good ol' camp days.  Hedorah deserves as much praise, as he is one of the most deadly, and creative foes ever created and whose virtual indestructibility really made him all the more terrifying.  This is a film that people of all ages can enjoy, whether really young, or really old, and will likely be cherished for generations to come.  So if you can relate to everything I said, then this is one hell of a film and that you'd do well to get.  If, however, you just can't see yourself getting this film no matter what I or anyone else says, well, then at least rent it and watch it at least once, then see if you've changed your mind.",1138406400,2,4302,4.8911845730027546
2121701,3,B0002V7OEM,"I've loved Godzilla for as long as I can remember, but ""Godzilla vs. Hedorah"" (or ""Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster"", the original U.S. release title) has always been my least favorite - until the last time I saw it.

The 70's produced the worst of the Godzilla flicks - a series of dark, hokey, and dull films which ultimately caused the end of the Godzilla film line (until the beginning of a new series in 1984).  Executive producer Tomoyuki Tanaka was in the hospital for much of the time while the film was being made, so he didn't see the different direction which ""Godzilla vs. Hedorah"" took.  For the first time since 1964, the film had a strong social message: stop the pollution!  A series of grim, grungy images show the pollution which is seeping into the air and the sea.  From it rises Hedorah, the smog monster, intent on gobbling down the world's smog and pollution whilst killing off Earth's people.  Bullets go through it, knives do nothing to it.  Who will stop this ""demon of drudge""?  Why, Godzilla, of course!

Yoshimitsu Banno pointed the series in a different direction (which enraged producer Tanaka upon his release from the hospital), inserting funky tunes, a scene in a revolting dance club, and entirely unnecessary animations.  Then there's the creepy-looking Hedorah, which actually becomes quite scary when you see it's glowing eyes in the dark gray night sky, while the eerie bass guitar plays quietly amongst the soundtrack's instruments.  This is certainly the weirdest, creepiest Godzilla flick of 'em all.

A sequel to this film was planned, hence the ""And yet another one?"" title at the end of the film.  In it, Godzilla would travel to Africa and battle another smog monster.  But the project was shelved when Tomoyuki Tanaka banned director Banno from ever coming near a Godzilla film again, claiming that Banno had ruined the series.  I can't really say that I'm sorry for that decision.

""Godzilla vs. Hedorah"" is one of the most unique of the Godzilla films, and because of that, it's one of my favorites.  It's a weird, creepy film, that becomes much more fun (and funny) when you watch it with the terrible English dubbing.",1135900800,3,2165,4.808108108108108

I had to watch it a couple times before I finally really understood it.  The hippies and all the 70 stuff really made the movie distracting especially the annoying Save the Earth song.  Plus, the most disturbing moment in film history can be found here.  Breaking just about every rule of physics, Godzilla actually flies.  A bit on the totally weird side there LOL.  Still as Banno wanted this movie is a bit dark at times.  Let my point out one scene where Hedorah sprays a bunch of people and they die after being disformed and mutated.  Then there are two scenes where it shows an innocent creature in Hedorha's path.  First, Hedorah's sludge traps a kitten its its goo.  The small animal is covered in Hedorah's poisenous sap and would probably and painfully die.  Then there's another scene where is shows a small baby waist deep in Heodrah's slime crying for his mother.  Of course, since the slime is poisenous the baby would die slowly just like the kitten.  In other words, this movie could be looked at comicly but then when you finally really get it you start to see what Banno wanted you to see.  At other times it shows garbage from dolls to grandfather clocks floating on the water with dead fish covered in garbage that people just threw away into Tokyo Bay.

that was released to American theatres and TV in the seventies. That version had excelent dubbing done in America. And the opening disco/go-go number dubbed into english by a very good professional american singer.  The dialogue was more fun also. ""Superman beats them all!!""  This version isn't bad really.  The dubbing is that same Hong-Kong Kung Fu ""OH!! OH!!! You have killed my master!! AAAHHH!! AHH!""

""We heard about your trouble with Fut-Yoo""  ""OH OH, Fut-Yoo was my own student!"" Etc., dubbing from other seventies Godzillas. But it is not too bad. I'd say the dubbing is close to the quality of TERROR OF MECHAGODZILLA and alot better than the dubbing of GODZILLA VS. GIGAN or GODZILLA VS. MEGALON which is by far the worst. By the way the name HEDORAH means ""sludge monster"", but ""smog monster"" just sounds better. The english dialogue is pretty good actually, since I could follow what everyone was talking about alot better than usual. No double talk suggests that this is not translated directly from the Japanese, and a peak at the japanese track seems to confirm this. So the english script was probably written by someone with a pretty good concept of how english speakers actually talk. Real Japanese dialogue tends to sound repetative and confusing, especially when discussing scientific jargun.  Japanese has a structure that is very different from english, unlike, say for example. So an idiomatic translation from japanese to english is out of the question.

Also, in regards to Godzilla's flying. As silly as it may seem, and look onscreen. The more powers the better! I say. Superman gets cooler the more powers he gets. Right!

It's impact on me then still remains with me to this day. It is perhaps one of the few Godzilla films with a serious theme (pollution) in comparision with the others. Hedora was perhaps the toughest opponent Godzilla ever had. It is gruesome and disgusting. The fight sequences were fought well and ruthlessly by both monsters. The director did an efficient job in evolving Hedora into a very evil monster. What intrigued and yet sickened me about Hedora was not only its rapid growth from polution, its arsnel of lazers, sulfuric elements, but its going to the bathroom on Godzilla and chuckling about it (Did everyone really catch that scene?). The heat drawn from that scene alone in unision with the previous items mentioned made one really want Godzilla to really fry, nuter,and stomp Hedora into ash. Personally, I liked the 70's pop culutre in the film. I really wish that Sony would've rescued the English soundtrack from from The Amercian International version, nevertheless I'm not really picky about it.

Godzilla vs Hedorah is a fun relativly fast paced ""epic"" with a lot of gratuitous pollution shots.

Pollution is on the rise in Japan and a monster (possibly from some dead planet full of muck, the scientist postulates) arrives in the ocean and begins wrecking fishing ships for no good reason.  It is soon named Hedorah by a young poorly dubbed kid who almost worships Godzilla and even dreams about him.

Hedorah is made of teeny tiny tadpoles that join togather to make one big shape-shifting hulk of a creature that enjoys sucking on factory smokestacks (like cigarettes).  He flies or walks or oozes around pooping out clouds of acid and gooey toxic crud.

Godzilla appears and tries to defeat Hedorah...agian and agian and again, only to get burned (literally).  His atomic breath is useless and his punches go right through the stinky beast!

This film has it's odd moments to be sure: short cartoons, dream sequences, bad seventies songs, and a drug halucination (a guy thinks everyone in the club he's drinking in has fish heads!).

This is definatly a seventies film.  Listen to the score and notice the direction style.

The best scene (and argubly the most talked about in the film) is the infamous shot of Godzilla flying after Hedorah!  I laughed and laughed at this one.  It's very funny, and the music accompanying it (this piece can be found on the Best of Godzilla Volume 1 CD) made it even funnier!

parental warning: As funny as it was, a cautious parent may want to watch this film before letting his/her kid(s) watch.  People are turned to skeletons or graphically burned by Hedorah's acidic exaust and Hedorah itself might be scary to really young children.  Also Godzilla rips Hedorah's eyeballs out.

All in all, I was surprised at how much I like this film.  The only thing I really hated was the dubbing of the little kid (PAPAAAAAAA!!! GODZILLAAAAAAA!!!).",1109721600,,2074,4.756302521008403
2121732,4,B0002V7OEM,"It's wonderful that American home video distributors have finally started taking Godzilla seriously and releasing excellent DVDs of the Big Guy's flicks. This DVD of the 1971 ""Godzilla vs. Hedorah"" (originally released in America as ""Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster"") may not offer much in the way of extras, but it lets you see the film as you've never been able to: in a beautiful widescreen image (enhanced for 16:9 TVs) with the option to watch it in Japanese with English subtitles or dubbed into English. For older viewers, I definitely recommend watching it in Japanese; it will change your whole perspective on Godzilla and makes the film seem less cheap and campy. However, the English dub is a good feature to have for younger children, who will definitely want to watch the film as well.

Although watching ""Godzilla vs. Hedorah"" in Japanese will tone down the camp somewhat, this remains the weirdest, oddest, most mind-bogglingly bizarre of all Godzilla movies. In the 1970s the Japanese film industry entered a steep decline because of competition from television, and the Godzilla films suffered from severe budget cutbacks. One of the guiding fathers of the Godzilla films, special effects wizard Eiji Tsubaraya, died in 1969 and the effects work on the Godzilla films suffered an additional drop in quality. ""Godzilla vs. Hedorah"" therefore came at a time when the Godzilla films were changing, and not always for the better. A new director, Yoshimitsu Banno, helmed this film and purposely set out to make a completely new kind of Godzilla film: a weird mixture of serious environmental message, frightening horror sequences, rock 'n' roll party scenes, cartoon montages, kiddie antics, and surreal monster fights. This is one strange film! The shift between the often grisly horror sequences (Hedorah the Smog Monster does some nasty things to his human victims) to animated ""bumper"" sequences and Godzilla actually flying (!!!) will make you wonder if somebody put the reels out of sequence! For all these problems and the film's silliness, there's something endearing about this monster mash: compared to the next few films, which are so cheap and uninspired, ""Godzilla vs. Hedorah"" feels like a project that the people working on it actually cared about. The environmental slant also provides a real message, the first time since the original ""Godzilla"" (1954) that the series approached such a heated topic.

Godzilla steps into full superhero mode here. Hedorah (the name comes from the word 'hedoro' meaning 'sludge'), a monster born in the waters from humanity's pollution, rapidly mutates into a jelly-like giant that comes ashore in Japan and starts wreaking havoc and turning humans into skeletons. Godzilla answers the call to save humanity. But Hedorah is a fearsome foe, armed with laser eyes, poison gas, and toxic spit-balls! Godzilla won't have an easy time, but maybe the scientists and the military can lend a hand with their electrode device. In between scenes of monsters battling, you can hang out with Japanese teens at a disco and watch the psychadelic acid pattern show on the wall. Or just listen to the wah-wah-wah soundtrack music -- guaranteed to make you want to buy a lava lamp!

Yeah, this is a weird film. But it's a cult classic, and resembles no other Godzilla film. (Apparently series producer Tomoyuki Tanaka hated the final product and director Banno consequently never directed another film.)

Note about the English dub: Viewers who remember seeing this film on TV in the 1970s and '80s may notice that the English dub on this film is different than the one they remember. This is because there were two English soundtracks made for the film back in 1971. American International Pictures released the film as ""Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster"" and did their own dub through Titra Sound in New York, composing cool English lyrics for the theme song, ""Save the Earth."" Toho studios made their own English dub in Hong Kong for use in other English-speaking territories. In the early 1990s, the rights to the picture in America returned to Toho, and the Toho dub has now replaced the American International one. This DVD therefore contains the Hong Kong dubbing job, and that means ""Save the Earth"" is now in Japanese instead of English. Fans of this classic camp song might be a bit disappointed!",1103500800,96,4346,5.040333796940195
2121733,4,B0002V7OEM,"The Movie:

After watching this movie for the first time in so many years, I can see why fans are so divided by it. It's either one of the best or one of the worst Godzilla films in fans' eyes. The style is so different that many people hate it, but its also the reason why many people love. In my opinion, it ranks as one of the best, and though Banno has a style far different from Honda, he sits close up to him as giving the series one of the most intruging films.

""Godzilla vs. Hedorah"" is set in a time where pollution was a huge problem in Japan. Taking action in utilizing this inviormental problem in the movie, ""Godzilla vs. Hedorah"" becomes one of the darkest and effective message throwing Godzilla films since the original ""Gojira"". Hedorah is the embodiment of man's ignorance and carelessness, just like Godzilla was. In many scenes that can be considered graphic for the time, the movie shows us the death and carnage Hedorah causes. Some scenes could be considered more graphic than the hospital scene of the original ""Gojira"". News reports flash up throughout the film citing how many people have died by Hedorah's attacks, and the number simply keeps growing to shocking results. Cartoon segments and many effective media drenched, mob scenes of worried people break in the film. The symbolize the panic Hedorah has been causing and it works well as many G-Films in this era fail to do this. These segments truley are a testament to the director's approach.

Banno's style is utilized in a very bizzare, but 'artsy' way. Linking the carlessness of the youth (or hippies) as just as much of the problem: 'Sure they can preach we're messing up the world...but that's about it. Drinking and dancing is the only other thing they do.' And they decide to do this even to the point of death. (In a great scene, one of the characters has too much to drink and looks around to see everyone wearing fish masks. A testament to the youth's ignorance? A sign that they are all in a sense 'fish in a barrel' for Hedorah?)

Godzilla himself is characterized as an almost tragic hero with the excellent characterization of young Ken. Though Ken beleives (and acts like he knows) Godzilla is there to save them, who's really going to listen to a kid? This makes Ken one of the most well written children characters in the conventional Godzilla series. Most children in thes series seem to know everything and influence the adult characters to the highest degree. But Ken's words aren't taken seriously (despite the fact he's right) and the media still has a very bleak view on Godzilla himself. Meanwhile Godzilla is found angry at the pollution taking place in the world (specificly the ocean where he lives) and is angry at mankind for doing this to their own planet. In turn, Godzilla hates what Hedorah stands for. A glaring rivalry seemed to grow on screen between the monsters in a fabulous fashion. Many scenes before battle dragged out a long stare-down between them. Their battle wounds also show their spite for each other as Godzilla's left hand is deteriorated to a skeliton with skin hanging off it and his right eye becomes crusted by Hedorah's sludge. Meanwhile, not only does Godzilla take out Hedorah's right eye, but has a field day ripping the monster to pieces at the very end of the movie. The battle was quite savage and showed a very dark side of Godzilla movies' battles. Easily one of the most graphic battles in Godzilla, especially for the time this movie was made.

The characters aren't the best developed of the series, but better than many other movies as well. Like I said Ken is one of, if not the best child character of the series. Even in the recent ""Godzilla x MechaGodzilla"" we see children with too much influential power on adult characters and unrealistic wisdom beyond their years. This is not the case here. Ken is clearly a kid who thinks of Godzilla as a hero and loves to play with his toys. His words are mostly ignored and his courage isn't unrealistic. (Unlike a certian child putting desks together in ""Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S."") His uncle is a bonified hippie/drinker that you really can't tell is an antagonist or protagonist, but intresting non-the-less. And Ken's mother and father show conflict in learning about Hedorah, struggling to live their own lives and yet worry about others. The main problem with the charactrs is that their not given much to do by the end of the film but watch the monsters fight-- much like Okawara's films (""Godzilla 2000"", ""Godzilla and Mothra: The battle for Earth"") in which he wasn't sure what to do with his characters at times.

Needless to say, despite the movies heavy symbilism, very powerful message and refreshing style, its not without flaws. Hedorah's design is pretty goofy looking and the suit itself is poorly realized. But at times it can be considered creepy as well-- With those two huge red eyes randomly placed in the middle of walking sludge, you'll either look at him as a phantom-esque creature, or a carpet with red golf-balls . The editing is also a bit akward. In one scene Godzilla is trapped in a hole being swamped by sludge and the next time we see him, he's rolling down the side of Mt. Fuji with Hedorah. The most painful scene in this movie is the infamous flying scene in which Godzilla uses his ray to propel himself backwards in the air to stop an escaping Hedorah. Though the movie is very stylized, has a beautiful approach to it and is the darkest film since the original, this scene still manages to make it in to the final cut and is simply out of place. Admittedly though...it is kind of fun to watch.

The music can be both a complaint and a praise. Though Godzilla's theme can be considered kind of 'wonky' and embarrassing, it also has a noble sound to it at the end of the theme. It takes some getting use to but its not that bad. Hedorah's theme is very in place for the character though and fits the creepy killing machine's presence perfectly. Overall the 70s-esque music fit the style and ton of the film and is able to make the mood a bit more bizarre. It can be argued that it does and doesn't add to the dark atmosphere of the film, though I think it does.

Overall ""Hedorah"" proves to be one of the most different Godzilla movies. Creating a different style and approach to Godzilla it delivers realistic characters, a message that speaks loud and clear and some nifty effects shots here and there. (The best shot in the entire movie being the scene where Godzilla first appears and roars with a gorgeous sunrise behind him. Magnificent!) For some its Godzilla's worst. For me, I put it high up on ""The Best"" of list as a rather artistic looking film.

**** out of *****

Picture quality:

Astounding. The DVD picture quality makes this movie look like it was made yesterday. The night scenes are easier to see was well as you can make out much more of what's going on. The picture was so clear and the colors so vibrant, I felt like I could reach in and touch what was going on in this film.

***** out of *****

Sound:

Mono, but it didn't really bother me at all. The sound was still clear and the music was always booming through magnicantly.

**** out of *****

Extras:

We have the English dub and Japanese audio tracks, with the options of English and French subtitles. There's the Japanese Teaser to ""Tokyo: S.O.S."", ""Godzilla: Save the Earth"" for PS2 and X-Box, previews to two animated features, The GINO Series on DVD and a movie parodying old, black and white horror films. (The title escapes me.)

The dubbing is what we've heard before from this movie and the subtitles are actually quite accurate. Some might seem like dubtitles, but there are several lines that are different from the dubbed version--- Which was probaly just well translated.

It's plenty for me to finally have the Japanese language released in America, but overall, very weak special features.

** out of *****

Overall:

A fantastic movie, a great release with beautiful picture quality and Japanese language and the only set back being lack of features. It's still a valuable collectors item JUST for the fact it has the original Japanese version on it. Go for it now!

2121734,2,B0002V7OEM,"Not a great God-Z flick but not the worst- however definately the most unusual of the old series. More like an art film or sixties acid/hippy flick. Lots of psychedelics going on here. My only real complaint about the film is the Hedorah/Smog Monster, it's far too goofy/fake looking. If they had of given him more eyes or one big eye or better yet eyes without pupils would have worked best and made him more other worldly (he's not an animal he's a giant hunk of living polution). Also the monsters movements are REALLY terrible. Godzilla acts like a prize fighter(?) or something strange and the little kid at one point even immitates his moves!? Which makes no sense at all as he has never acted like this before!? Not to mention the crazy flying scene... Although the film is strictly for kids it has a lot of hippy/adult themes about polution (which are still relevent today) and scenes of graphic violence- if they had of stayed serious and aimed it totaly at adult acid heads it would have worked better. And it needed more carnage! Really thats the whole reason to watch these movies is for things to get blown up and there is very little. Also the music doesn't work in spots like when Godzilla shows up they have replaced the traditional God-Z theme with hippy guitar that falls completely flat. Over all its an enjoyable although some what long B-movie hippy Godzilla flick. The films MADE BETWEEN ""Destroy all monsters"" and ""Terror of Mechagodzilla"" represent the very worst godzilla films ever made, this is one them but it has a lot of unusual hippy camera work to keep it above the pack.
