5401743,5,B00A9YBW0Y,"The Hunt is a Danish film about a teacher falsely accused of molesting one of his pupils by the young girl herself. With no proof except that of the girl's word he finds himself condemned by those around him.

It's an interesting story that is well told and the paranoia associated with sex offenders is readily apparent. At times the film is moving and at others it makes you angry at the unfairness of it all. The lead character is very well played (by the same actor who plays Hannibal in the new TV series), you feel for him as his world crumbles around him and those that were once his friends now treat him as a pariah.

The rest of the cast also do a superb job with their roles, especially the young girl. The film is made more effective by the understated nature, it feels authentic and when certain events occur, they really do come as a shock.

This is an excellent film about a tricky subject, highly recommended.",1381622400,10,925,4.39766081871345
5401744,5,B00A9YBW0Y,This was the most thought-provoking film I have seen in a very very long time.  Mads Mikkelsen's portrayal of an unjustly accused man is brilliant.  You become completely engrossed in the man's struggle and your heart breaks scene after scene for the dilemma he is in.  Mikkelsen is able to capture the loyalty of the audience and bring you on this hideous journey even when the topic leaves you squirming in your seat.  You feel how uncomfortable he is from the very beginning and evolve with the character as he discovers that those closest to him are able to turn their backs on an instant.  The supporting cast is equally as talented.  You feel engulfed in this community's problems and can envision how such a misunderstanding can occur. This movie had us talking for hours about the dilemma of accusation and truth.  A genius film that will leave you thinking.,1380153600,3,866,4.733333333333333
5401745,4,B00A9YBW0Y,"""The Hunt"" (2012 release from Denmark; original title ""Jagten""; 106 min.) brings the story of Lucas (played by Mads Mikkelsen), a forty-something, recently divorced man. He is aching over the loss of his marriage and the fact that his teenage son is living with his ex-wife. Lucas is helping out at the local kindergarten, where the kids adore him. We also get to know Klara, the 5 or 6 yr. old  daughter of Lucas' best friend Theo. After having overheard a racy conversation by Klara's brother and his friends, Klara flaps out some words to the kindergarten's principal, implying improper behavior by Lucas. Things develop rapidly from there, and soon thereafter other kids at the kindergarten also come forward with similar allegations. At this point we are about 40 min. into the movie. To tell you more of the plot would do a big disservice to your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this movie demonstrates how a young child unknowingly can cause destruction of a life and of a community. It is a very difficult issue, as of course we tend to believe what young kids tell us, since they have no reason to lie, right? Except that at such a young age, young kids may not yet fully comprehend the difference between telling the truth and telling lies, or at least certainly they cannot fully anticipate or comprehend the consequences of their actions. Second, the acting in this movie is outstanding throughout, none more so that Mad Mikkelsen as the accused sexual offender. Mikkelsen also excelled in last year's ""A Royal Affair"", another outstanding movie from Denmark. No surprise that he won the Best Actor award at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival (where this movie premiered). But kudos as well to the little girl who played Klara in what obviously at times had to be a very difficult/awkward shoot. Third, I read that this movie was made on a budget of about $3.5 million, proving once again that you don't need a superhero saving the world or an action movie in which everything is blown to smithereens every 5 minutes to engage an audience and make a gripping movie.

I have no idea why it has taken more than a year for this movie to arrive in US theatres, but better late than never I suppose. The movie opened this weekend at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati. I figured this probably wouldn't stick around for very long so I went to see it right away. Imagine my surprise that the screening I saw this at (a matinee show) was absolutely PACKED! That is great news indeed, and I can only hope this movie proves to be a big hit on the art-house theatre circuit. All that aside, if you are in the mood for a top quality foreign movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. ""The Hunt"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1375574400,28,2859,4.6351084812623276
5401746,5,B00A9YBW0Y,"A painful and well-acted drama that is often difficult to watch as a kindly man's life and future begin to unravel as a consequence of dark forces beyond his control.  With absolutely no trace of preachiness, this foreign language film sheds a piercing light on the difficulty of determining the veracity of criminal charges brought by under aged victims.  Along with the accompanying violence, hysteria and social breakdown that emerge in a close knit rural community.  A must-see for mature and discerning viewers.",1375056000,5,516,5.192771084337349
5401747,5,B00A9YBW0Y,"[The following review refers to a 2012 Danish film ""Jagten"" starring Mads Mikkelsen. The director is Thomas Vinterberg (""The Celebration"").]

Lucas is a 42-year-old, recently divorced kindergarten teacher living in an unnamed small Danish community. His lonely and quiet life turns into a nightmare when 6-year-old girl Klara, one of the children at the kindergarten and Lucas's best friend Theo's daughter, tells an innocent lie. Shunned by most of the community as a child molester, and even harassed to the point of being terrorized, Lucas is driven to the edge of despair.

""The Hunt"" (in original Danish ""Jagten"") is a difficult film to sit through, but is a rewarding experience nonetheless. Self-deception and mass psychology have been taken up in films, but the result is rarely as chilling as the nerve-shattering story that is realistic and unpredictable.

What makes the film compelling is the superb performance of Mads Mikkelsen. Mikkelsen, known as Le Chiffre of ""Casino Royale,"" is simply fascinating as Lucas, a warm-hearted man accused of what he did not do. Thomas Vinterberg (""The Celebration"") directs the film with confidence, building up tension incredibly high as he keeps the story moving along. A must-see.",1373414400,87,1231,5.302564102564102
5401748,5,B00A9YBW0Y,"This movie is pretty amazing, I was expecting it to be really good but I had seen some other movies on IMBD given over 8 out of 10 (as in the case of that movie) and except for a few exceptions, I wasn't impressed with most of them, and lots of them I think are overrated. and it has been a while since I saw some excellent cinema like this. I was getting too used to Hollywood standard entertainment. This movie belongs to another league entirely and is easily one of the very best I have seen ever. Lots of European cinema is very different than American cinema. This movie has a very realistic story that could happen for real, and for that, it is disturbing, and right toward the ending when I thought that the 'ending' would be very improbable, my expectations have been violently thwarted and the true conclusion of the movie hits you like a slap on your face.  Here's what I learned from it:

1. Nothing is black or white, there are shades of grey. It's easy to take things for granted and especially if other people do it. (find out about the Lucifer Effect by Zimbardo after you see the movie, but you don't need to know all that to enjoy the movie)

2. Often the best people pay as they are taken advantage of.

3. I have to find more movies as good as this.

A must see, great actors and really compelling film making and story. Wow.",1372377600,91,1344,4.275590551181103
5401749,5,B00A9YBW0Y,"It shows exactly how eager society is to believe men are monsters; how sheltering the ""victim"" leads to the accused having no rights; and how accepting anything you fear to be true leads to coaching the ""victim"" into what to say (instead of letting them tell you). There is no ""innocent until proven guilty"" if a woman or a child makes a sexual accusation against a man, the damage is done as soon as the accusation is made.

The way the events unfold are believable, and I mean this is something that could happen in any country, in any setting.  I found myself feeling the panic that Lucas, the main character, starts to feel as, bit by bit, he is abandoned by those he needs support from, and his whole life is starts to careen more and more out of control.

Mads Mikkelsen, who plays Lucas, shows that he feels betrayed and angry, but such human emotions have to be kept under wraps.
 With the strength of the irrational fears growing around him, he knows he has to keep his wits about him.  I felt for him until the end of the film, because as easy as it is to empathize with him, he really has become the prey in what you could call a ""hunt"".",1503532800,,813,4.219354838709678

5401757,4,B00A9YBW0Y,"The Hunt calls up images of men together out hunting, as in The Deer Hunter, rituals of the tribe in some small Danish village, a close rural backwater. Mikkelsen as Lucas is a kindergarten teacher, who has recently split up from his wife, with only limited access to his teenage son Marcus. He is accused of child abuse, but its presented clearly that hes innocent. Vinterberg explored previously in Festen a dogme film, the repercussions, at a party when the father of a family is unmasked as an abuser of his children. Here its in reverse. Vinterberg suggests children may lie and are not always innocent: the accused may be the victim. The fairy-tale setting removes it from the modern world. We get this close set of good people, the warmth, the innocence and the rationality of the people, then the sliver of doubt about one good citizen descends  into the ferocious persecution of one individual, Lucas; how the fairy-tale is based on the thin-ice of civilization. The audience closely identify with him. A lonely, bespectacled man and his dog, with occasional visits from his son. Mikkelson has acted as the villain in James Bond and as a Viking warrior. Can such a man be humbled? He has no doubts about his own innocence. This is where his defiance comes from. He has just started a sexual relationship with a teacher from work, Nadja .

Lucas is close friends with the father Theo(Bo Larsen) of the little girl Klara ( (Wedderkopp), who falls out with Lucas after a misunderstanding(she puts letters into his pocket, she kisses him on the lips) whereby he tries to say she shouldnt do that. Background to this is that Klara feels unhappy at home as her parents are rowing a lot. One scene sees Lucas determined to buy groceries, despite the violent objections of store workers and former friends. His attempt at civility both here and in church is rebuffed and Lucas is not civilised any more. He is testing the moral majority( he wants to believe in the good of his community) to see how far they will go. We are told that Klara never lies, but she has been exposed by her brother to a fleeting image of sex on iPad. This and her familys troubles are enough to disturb and confuse her. Her father Theo doesnt take much convincing of Lucass guilt, so all old loyalties are quickly severed. Lucas fights back and has a sense of humour about his plight. The films tone is quite light, despite the breaking of a taboo and the sheer terror. There are moments of humour. The ending is foreboding to suggest people never forgive. This dour subject matter is told straight and is surprisingly grim and gripping, with great performances from Wedderkopp and Mikkelsen. Vinterberg on vintage form.",1489276800,,2698,4.701902748414376

I went in with low expectations because I figured even Mads Mikkelsen couldn't strike gold every time. The premise bothered me - Lucas (Mikkelsen) is a kindergarten worker falsely accused of molesting his student, who is also his neighbor and best friend's daughter. In real life, the bigger problem is that children are afraid to come forward. However, they handle the subject with grace and sympathy for everyone involved. No one in the film is a bad person. They are just afraid and doing their best to cope. There's some incredible acting on all sides.",1483488000,,657,4.823008849557522

5401764,5,B00A9YBW0Y,"I just saw The Hunt at the New Zealand International Film Festival and I walked out speechless. The Hunt has such a difficult story to tell but the film makers never go too far with little exposition. The film doesn't take one side over another, making the point that there isn't really any ""bad guys"" in the film, just people on opposite sides of one coin. The script is shocking, tragic and at times funny. The film is very intimately shot with an almost documentary approach. The film is mostly shot hand-held, giving you the feeling of realism. The camera likes to get in close and hold on the actors eyes and it is the eyes that tell the story. Most of the story is told through what was not being said, but instead with looks and pauses. Mads Mikkelsen is stunning as always as the man accused of sexual abuse. He plays the role with such sensitivity to the character but always keeps you guessing throughout the film. Annika Wedderkopp plays the role of the innocent young girl to perfection, again always keeping you guessing. Their relationship being one of the most interesting I've seen on film this year. If I had one complaint it would be that the main plot ends quite abruptly, not leaving me fully satisfied before it goes into the epilogue. The Hunt is drama at its best with beautiful performances from the entire cast. It is hard to explain how great this film is without giving away spoilers but the film gives no clear answers for such a difficult subject and it makes you ask yourself, what would I do?",1475020800,,1523,4.521739130434782

He plays his character with such honesty and innocence, a stark contrast with what he's being accused of, and by whom. We feel his only-ness, his isolation, and we can't help but hurt with him, protest with him against his false accusers, and worry for him, especially at the end.

Life is good for him that is until a horrific lie by the daughter of his best friend begins to destroy his life completely. It is clearly established for us as the audience without a trace of doubt that Lucas is completely innocent but the entire town turns against him, his friends turn into enemies, he is refused service at his local grocery store. Mikkelson is amazing as the man  trying to make sense of events , and occasionally losing his mind while he claims his innocence. The movie ends on a note that does not give us a clear resolution.

Sharing the screen with an equally mesmerizing performance is Annika Wedderkopp.  This child actor succeeds in a complex role and makes the character of Klara fully believable.

The actors are given a wonderful script of a story that shows how easily a reputation can be unjustifiably ruined. In a culture that is now so attuned to even the slightest suspicion of pedophilia, it would be surprising if any rational adult did not give a second thought to the risks of going into a profession where any innocent gesture could be open to misinterpretation.  This film shows the suffering that results from such an erroneous accusation.

And of disbelieving, shaming, blaming victims, calling them liars, etc. This is discussed in the article:

Why Do Adults Fail to Protect Children from Sexual Abuse or Exploitation

https://1in6.org/men/get-information/online-readings/others-who-were-involved-or-not/why-do-adults-fail-to-protect-children-from-sexual-abuse-or-exp

This article discusses the myths perpatrated by this movie including research and psychological reasons people do not want to believe victims and survivors etc.
EIGHT COMMON MYTHS ABOUT CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE
http://www.leadershipcouncil.org/1/res/csa_myths.html

""Millions of children have unwanted or abusive sexual
experiences. Many of them believe, correctly, that someone else knows or
should know about their situation, but does little or nothing to
protect them. SOME TELL ADULTS WHAT'S GOING ON, seeking protection and
help, only to be met with disbelief, denial, blame, or even punishment.""

Physchological reasons for societal and individual failure to protect children and recognize abuse (and reasons to create a film such as this) include:
Overwhelming feelings (like fear, anger, or shame) caused by just thinking about the sexual abuse of children.

Confusion caused by incorrect stereotypes about what kinds of people sexually use and abuse children. (A nice, kind, charming, charitable person could not be a molester. Molesters use this belief to their benefit, often projecting just such an image.)

Physical, emotional, and financial dependency on an individual or group that would be lost (for oneself and the family) if such concerns are raised

Self doubts of various kinds (e.g., Im paranoid. What if Im wrong? Its none of my business.).

Fears of various consequences (e.g., of acknowledging betrayal by a trusted and respected person, of being wrong, of being right).

Automatic defense mechanisms to prevent being triggered into awarenesses of your own traumatic experiences of which you may or may not be fully aware.

THIS is the REALITY:

The Catholic Church has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal
fees to defend priests and brothers who have already been tried and
convicted of serious sexual assaults against children in their care.

5401806,5,B00A9YBW0Y,"It is interesting to me that Denmark seems to be behind us in how these child molestation cases must be handled from the very first interview with the child. We learned very painfully in California's McMartin case that children are highly imaginative and suggestible. It is not hard at all for them to overhear things and take imaginative leaps from there, especially if the adults are encouraging them to do so.  McMartin ended up being a fabricated case with the children telling the adults what they were expecting to hear.

I DESCRIBE THE OPENING OF THE FILM  NEXT WHICH SOME MAY CONSIDER A SPOILER.

From the very start in this Danish story, the adults who first handle this case do so by asking leading questions of the young child. They accept nods by the child instead of an actual verbal narrative by the child. The child is nudged so far as to be asked if she saw a whitish discharge come out as part of her experience. Could there be a more leading question? This is set in a rather rural and backwoods section of Denmark so perhaps if it were set in a more urban environment, the Danes would be more up to date on how questioning children in these cases must now take place. That is the opening of this story and since they are so backwards about handling this, things go downhill from there. The actor who is the alleged molester is Mads Mikkelsen who plays Hannibal on American tv but who has also starred in many excellent foreign movies.

The director of this film must have a continuing interest in this subject matter because child molestation was at the center of his other top movie ""The Celebration"". It was an entirely different story but that was the central issue.

The film is excellent, the acting is excellent but I will say that I probably have an upper limit on how many of these stories I can see. This is a very upsetting subject matter, no matter which side of the case you are on, and the creators better be doing an excellent job to make the viewer want to sit through it. Some viewers frankly may not want to sit through any of these films. If you are a viewer who does not like dark, dramatic works, this would not be my first recommendation of an evening's entertainment for you.",1431907200,,2216,4.4727722772277225

I enjoyed and appreciated the character ""Theo"" as he was torn between the word of his child and that of his best friend.

My only criticism would be the ending, Spoilers obviously follow. We go there like the flick of a switch.  At one moment everyone in town hates him and deals out their own justice based on the lies, the next, they love him again.  I can understand his former best friend suddenly realising his daughter lied but unfortunately this sort of allegation usually sticks to people.  I would have liked to have seen how the town switched their viewpoint, did the father with his daughter go to everyone and outline she lied.  Also what happened to the old woman who spread the child's lies? Was she sued for not handling that professionally and at least telling him what he was accused of before getting the mob involved and spreading gossip amongst the women of the town? The obese thug who punched a boy in the face?  Did he get his comeuppance?

But other than the ending, it's a film everyone should watch, if you're ever in this situation for well any crime really so you stop and pause and think, maybe we're being too quick to judge and condemn.",1418688000,,1475,4.522556390977444

The succession of events that are portrayed in this film are all beholden to that singular notion, which is taken as truth despite lack of evidence. The film captures the conundrum of commitment to an idea or position, and the potential people have to become locked into a particular viewpoint or stance once they have engaged in action that aligns them with one side or another.

Overall, this film did very well at capturing the difficulty a false accusation presents an individual, especially when the nature of the supposed crime carries a particularly emotion charge.

And, as our world becomes a much smaller ""town"" due to the Internet, the modern levels of surveillance, multinational business activities and social media, the entire Earth is rapidly becoming just one small town. This story explores the effect on one man whose life is turned upside down by misunderstanding of neighbors, the damage done by malicious remarks and the inability of narrow-minded  people to examine themselves and their beliefs. The protagonist is a man who has lived in the town where generations of his ancestors have lived, worked and died. His friends are men he has grown up with, with whom he drinks and hunts. They are men who don't articulate in words what they're thinking and feeling. Maybe Scandinavians are a bit more reticent than most, both women and men, but I sense that the habit of "" jumping to conclusions""  without a fair trial is widespread among all cultures. The protagonist will never feel the same sense of security and comfort that he once enjoyed. What a shame!! And all this injustice and horror is delivered to the viewer with a minimum of words and a maximum of body language. It's faultless. The cruelty of the mob mind in action is portrayed in exquisite detail. The claustrophobia of living in a small town and the inability to get away from the only world that you know creates a sense of oppression that chills the viewer.",1413072000,3,1479,4.750972762645914

5401834,5,B00A9YBW0Y,"Collective fear stimulates herd instinct, and tends to produce ferocity toward those who are not regarded as members of the herd. -Bertrand Russell

The opening scene of Thomas Vinterbergs (2014 Best Foreign Language Oscar nominated) film encapsulates the overall theme of the film in a subtle but powerful way. We are introduced to Lucas a character who appears uncomfortable while everyone around him is laughing and having a great time. None of this is said outright, it's told through our main characters eyes and posture. His smiles are forced and his body language conveys how anxious this particular group of men make him feel. We have been introduced to a man who is so guarded with his friends he jumps in a lake with all his clothes on while his peers are naked. The following scene shows Lucas in a different light. He appears comfortable and more content with his surroundings. We see a different man. In those scenes he is with children. This is an effective way to set up our story. The dichotomy of our protagonist has been clearly laid out and the story is ready to unfold.
We have a man going through a bitter divorce fighting for the custody of his child who has lost his teaching position and lives alone with his dog. A man who becomes the victim of a lie.
The Hunt is both a character study and a study of society on a micro level. After watching the film I was thinking about capital punishment, the media and criminal justice in modern society. While this story is very small in its narrative scope, the subject matter reaches into and overlaps with all facets of societal existence.
This film is about mob mentality. How innocent lies can build momentum and crush the lives of the people in it's wake. The way we treat members of the swarm who show independence or unconventional behavior hasn't changed much since the beginning of human civilization. We view the unfamiliar with fear and treat them as interlopers. Most of us will not admit to how truly unevolved our reactions to these people are. Finding the truth is rarely our top priority when we have the taste of vengeance on our salivating tongues.
Don't watch the trailer (below). I've intentionally avoided discussing most the specific details of this movie. The less you know about this film when you see it the better. We are smack in the middle of summer movie season and while I enjoy giant monsters, robots and mutants crushing national landmarks it was refreshing to spend two hours with an adult film.
PS- This film is in no way refreshing. It is a brutal self portrait we should all experience.

This Danish film by Thomas Vinterbert, who also co-wrote with Tobias Lindholm, takes an all-too-familiar topic both in film and real life to new levels of tension.  Set in a small Danish town, Mads Mikkelsen gives a remarkable performance as a kindergarten teacher who is charged with molesting one of his students.  Vinterbert isn't interested in keeping the audience guessing about Lucas' (Mikkelsen) guilt or innocence.  We know right away this is a false accusation because of Lucas' rejection of a student's inappropriate gesture.

Lucas is a divorced father of a teenage son who lives with his mother.  Marcus (Lasse Fogelstrom) is determined to live with his father, even after learning of the accusation.  The focus of the film here is the scant evidence of wrongdoing and how it affects Lucas, his son, girlfriend and his friendship with his best friend, Theo (Lasse Fogelstrom).

Even the young girl, Klara quickly recants her accusations, saying she was just mad at Lucas.  No one pays attention however.  Minds are already made up.  The general hysteria even leads to other children accusing Lucas, with obviously rehearsed, but inaccurate detail.  These are kids who had loved having Lucas as their teacher.  Eventually, Lucas is exonerated, both by the law and by the townsfolk and it appears all is forgiven.  I can't say that I loved the ending, but it (and the alternate) would seem appropriate to heighten Vinterbert's point.  This movie is hard to watch, but is well made and contains some strong performances.

The Blu ray version I watched was excellent in every way.  Shot digitally, it still looks very film-like.  The detail is excellent as are the colors and textural contrast.  It has a 1080p resolution and a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The audio comes with a Danish DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  There are scenes where English is spoken as well.  Subtitles are available in Spanish, English and English SDH.  The dialog is very clear.  Even with the scenes where Danish and Swedish accented English is spoken, it is easily understood.  The soundtrack features a quiet guitar most of the time, yet is quite evident as scenes develop.  Extras include the alternate ending, some outtakes, deleted and extended scenes, a short making of featurette and a trailer.",1401840000,2,2308,5.0396825396825395
5401850,4,B00A9YBW0Y,"This was an incredibly difficult film to watch. It just tore your heart to pieces, because you loved the little girl and wanted to yell at everyone in the film, ""This is what actually happened! You've got to understand! Ask more questions, delve a little deeper!""

(Spoiler Alert)

It was most heart-wrenching because far more often than not, accusations like hers turn out to be true. But this one case was much closer to the Salem Witch Hunts/Trials, in that one child's false accusations turned up many others in the community who created false 'memories' or were scared into 'admitting' they 'remembered' something that didn't actually happen. Fear is such a powerful thing. We have to always remember that, and realize that sometimes kids tell awful stories, because they are reaching out in other ways. Her parents were constantly fighting, and even though they loved her very much, they were not giving her the full attention she really needed! When she thought she could get that from this kind teacher of hers, and he had to explain to her that her kiss was inappropriate, it all went to hell. He did absolutely everything in that situation he should have, but films like these and stories like these that actually happen have everything to do with why teachers and other community mentors who work with kids are increasingly more hesitant to get down on floors and rough-and-tumble and play with kids, or to hug them, or to give comforting/consoling touches.

5401856,5,B00A9YBW0Y,"This is another Nordic offering and is one that can only build on the reputation of our Northern cousins. It stars the excellent Mads Mikkelsen as Lucas you may remember him from `A Royal Affair' or `The Three Musketeers'. He is a kindergarten teacher where he does everything for the kids including bum wiping. He is in a battle with his ex wife over access to his teenage son, who wants to live with his father. Lucas has a best friend in Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen) and one of Lucas' charges is his young five year old daughter, Klara.

One day Klara makes an accusation against her favourite teacher to the Head mistress and before you can say `J'accuse, the local authorities are involved including the most unprofessional child counsellor I have ever seen. He is at first sent home and then the old chestnut that children do not tell lies is pulled out of the hat and all of a sudden he is guilty as charged. Worse still half the school now claim to be victims, talk about the power of suggestion. What happens next is the spiral he is thrown into from being a revered and valued member of the community to social pariah over night where even his friends have judged him and found him wanting.

Director Thomas Vinterberg has made a quietly, powerful film of emotional torture and the effects of being over trusting of kids. This is one of those films that just pull you in and make you actually live the on screen antics, even the dog is good. It is in Danish and some English with fairly good sub titles and runs for 115 minutes and I found it absolutely engrossing. To tackle such an emotive subject and get the balance just right is some feat and Mikkelsen puts in a sterling performance, but actually so do all of them Anika Wedderkopp playing the young Klara looks like having a career path already mapped out judging by her performance here. The reference to `the Hunt' I assume refers to the Witch Hunt that Lucas suffers but is nicely ambiguous as they are a hunting community, either way this film is truly exceptional and I can thoroughly recommend.",1399680000,4,2062,4.510695187165775

5401859,4,B00A9YBW0Y,"Other reviewers have commented very cogently on the film's thematic preoccupations with the ways in which allegations of pedophilia can ruin a person's life, even if they have not done anything.  What is perhaps most noteworthy about Thomas Vinterberg's film is the way in which the story has been told: with no music to influence the viewers' attitude towards the characters, or set the mood for each sequence, we are left to make up our minds for ourselves.  Charlotte Bruus Christensen's camera focuses relentlessly on the characters' expressions through tight close-ups: we see the way in which Lucas' (Mads Mikkelsen) life is ruined through the way in which he begins to look wildly about him, as if fearful of reprisal.  The sequence taking place on Christmas Day where Lucas sits in a pew and looks behind him at his best friend Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen) is particularly effective; through a series of shot/reverse shots, we see Theo's face becoming more and more anxious as he understands just how much mental strain Lucas undergoes.  The sequence builds up to an uncomfortable climax as the two men are seen in two-shot, with Lucas grabbing Theo's lapels and shaking him.  In the background, the carols sung by the infants' choir stop abruptly, and everyone stares at the two men.  Vinterberg's film is intelligently set around the changing seasons, running from autumn to Christmas; as the festive season approaches, so life becomes more and more unbearable for Lucas: so much for the season of goodwill.  The title is deliberately ambiguous: not only referring to the annual winter hunt - where all the menfolk gather in good-natured celebration of a time-honored ritual, but to the way Lucas is hunted by the rest of his community.  We are left to reflect on the ways in which the menfolk seem blissfully unaware of this distinction, even a year after the pedophile incident has supposedly occurred.  This oversight paves the way for a seriously uncomfortable ending during the annual deer hunt, where we learn the extent to which Lucas' life has been ruined.  A profoundly unsettling piece, of especial significance today, when so many scandals involving alleged pedophiles seem to be coming to light,",1398729600,2,2212,5.01912568306011

5401867,5,B00A9YBW0Y,"Most of our societies exhibit the tendencies to vent their collective prejudices and discontent in the form of anger and violence towards vulnerable, fringe groups. At times, it is the minorities in the case of terrorism, or immigrants in the case of mass unemployment. In the past few decades, ever since more and more cases of pedophilia have been reported, adults who come into regular contact with children through work or otherwise, have come under substantial scrutiny for much of their interactions with children. Actions like a teacher hugging a child or placing an affectionate hand on a child's shoulder or a parent being quite intimate with his/her child can all be deemed `sexual abuse' depending on circumstances. Malice, gossip, the over-arching protective cover of the state or that of an institution like a school come into play. This brilliant Danish film examines one such instance in a small Danish town and its fallout. The director, Thomas Vinterberg, does a brilliant job in guiding the film through the story and poses an open question at the end for the viewers.

Lucas is a kindergarten teacher in a small Danish community. He is separated from his wife but has a fulfilling relationship with the kids at school as well as with his own son Marcus, even though his wife makes it hard for him to be with his son. Theo is Lucas' best friend and five-year old Klara is Theo's daughter at Lucas' kindergarten.

One day, as Lucas is playing with the children at the school, Klara jumps upon him, hugs him and kisses him on the lips. Lucas takes her aside gently and tells her that she must not kiss anyone on his lips except her parents. Klara possibly feels rejected and in a sudden turn of events, complains haltingly to the headmistress that Lucas exposed his private parts to her. All hell breaks lose, the authorities come in to investigate and even though Klara gives contradictory and unclear testimony, the headmistress says that children do not lie and proceeds to investigate further. Leading questions are asked of other children, who also suddenly 'remember' events of `abuse' by Lucas.

The town condemns Lucas as a despicable pedophile and he is expelled from the school. He loses his best friend Theo and is subjected to much violence and vilification by the closed community culminating in his beloved dog Fanny getting killed in retribution. Lucas' teenage son Marcus stands steadfastly by his dad amidst all this mental agony. Finally, as Christmas approaches, Theo accidentally listens to Klara mumbling in her sleep her apologies to Lucas for falsely implicating him. Theo realizes that Lucas is innocent and goes over to his place with some food and beer as peace offering, without necessarily apologizing in so many words. Lucas, the decent human being that he is, eventually reconciles with the community even though no one actually apologizes for their abominable conduct.

The film ends with a scene that points to Lucas being scarred and `targeted' for life, in spite of having been cleared. In the process, it raises fundamental questions in the social discourse of contemporary Western societies. How far should the community and the state go in the protection of individuals and family life? How far should we believe children's allegations of pedophilia, given that children have vivid imagination and also known to lie on occasion? The film also raises the disturbing question as to how we ourselves would have acted in case the same thing happened in our own communities?

Mads Mikkelsen as Lucas gives a stunning performance. Young Annika Wedderkopp as Klara is also arresting in her small but important role. The film shows that even in Scandinavia, where the state is permitted to intrude heavily (compared to Asian societies) into the personal family lives of its citizens in order to `protect' them, things can go horribly wrong in a way that can ruin a person's life in a matter of days.

5401886,4,B00A9YBW0Y,"THE HUNT never leaves its Smaller Town, Denmark, setting; it doesn't have many big dramatic twists and turns beyond those described in the premise-synopsis; and it shows little or nothing of things that would be crucial in most big Hollywood productions: police interrogations, hearings, news flashes, interviews with the other children besides the original ""accuser"" and what they (supposedly) said. Nevertheless, there is an immediate realism here, with excellent dialogue and interactions of all kinds by ordinary people, that more than compensates if you do not absolutely need big-film elements. THE HUNT also makes fine use of nuances of mannerism and subtle everyday symbolism. Some great scenery too.

Excellent character development and fine acting, especially by Mads Mikkelsen (who co-starred in another excellent Danish film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Royal-Affair/dp/B00BSYMY56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Royal Affair</a>), Annika Wederkopp, and all the actors who play the various other children. THE HUNT simply and straightforwardly shows how this sort of random ""accusation,"" embellished and escalated by adults, can irrevocably ruin any of us, including the very best of us. Yet, it also shows the other perspective: How, even when there is no solid evidence and tons of reasonable doubt, Lucas's former closest friends will never be able to entirely discount the possibility of some truth somewhere to the allegation, especially when it involves their own children. Moreover, even those without involvement or first-hand knowledge of the case(the local grocery store staff, etc) are eager to jump on the sanctimonious bandwagon and get in their chops. Finally, it's very revealing of how the biggest, most horrible mistakes and misjudgments are the hardest to admit or correct.

The message of the movie is powerful and righteous, but the quality of the movie itself is another story. This movie reminded me of ""Passion of Christ"" which is also powerful for similar reasons: unjust accusations, torture/martyrdom and then possible crucifiction. The accused teacher in this movie makes almost no attempt to solve the situation: he throws some words, alienates people around him. The headteacher in the kindergarten is about as ridiculous as can be: she says ""I always believe children"". Anyone who spent time with children knows that children lie from time to time (and they do not always understand the consequences). It looks like the village people have not had a sacrifice for some time and were looking for blood but that is where another problem lies. Perhaps the idea was to show that these people knew so little about children and life that they could not figure out how to go about these things, except to jump to conclusions. However, the characters are shown in general as fairly reasonable and likely educated people. This is where I find this movie so unrealistic.

This film is one of those scarce films you watch, where you cringe, but you can't shake off the horror, oh the horror.

I don't think mere words can do any credit to the acting which is nothing short of spectacular. It has a slow and engaging plot which will leave you feeling hunted for a long time.

In the tens of thousands of cases of priest pedophelia, the parents of the children who knew their children were being molested did nothing to the pedophile.  Most people who learn of the accusation of pedophelia, get behind the accused pedophile and support him.  In one case, when the evidence was pouring in, the people attacked the accuser and invited the pedophile into the home with their children to show support, and later, after it was proven that he was a pedophile, the pedophile left the area, only to be later appointed the head of an orphanage.  In the case of Sandusky, people saw him molesting children and said and did nothing. In one case, a child was being molested in the middle of FDR Drive in NYC and all drivers of vehicles passing by, did just that - passed by, later admitting that they actually saw the molestation.  This movie is ridiculous and unrealistic to believe that ""society"" will ""ostracize"" him, or that parents would ""punch him in the nose.""

******** SPOILER ALERT **** SPOILER ALERT ****** READ NO FURTHER IF YOU INTEND TO WATCH THIS FILM *****SPOILER ALERT **** SPOILER ALERT ****** SPOILER ALERT **** SPOILER ALERT ****** SPOILER ALERT **** SPOILER ALERT ******

Parts of the film seemed to make little sense - perhaps due to cultural differences? For example: when the protagonist was made aware he was accused of making some kind of sexual transgression against one of the kids he didn't get a lawyer immediately! Don't they have lawyers in Denmark? Further, he was never really charged, he was given his accuser's name only by accident via his co-worker.

Later, when he enters the local grocery store to buy food, he is attacked and beaten to a pulp by the store manager and staff. Why weren't the police called? Why didn't the protagonist press charges against his attackers? They don't do that in Denmark?

By the end of the film the protagonist had lost everything - his job, his personal security, his reputation, his family pet had been killed, his relationship with his teen son damaged. All because this one child had made an accusation against him. One of the closing shots shows him picking the child up and lifting her across the floor as she was afraid of stepping on cracks.  The fact that he even touched the child in any way, even to help her, is beyond stupid. He could have called for another adult to help in that situation or better yet, avoid being alone with the child. Through the movie i kept asking, ""what is he thinking??"" I wanted to see him at least fight back. So maybe he was guilty or he would have fought back?  Hmmmm.

The closing shot showed him being shot at on a community hunting excursion so we can figure he is still a target for the hunt. Maybe if you suspend logic (or don't apply American legal standards)  the film holds together better.",1391817600,5,1884,4.602985074626866

Once the remark is made into something bigger by adults who mean well, instead of being innocent until proven guilty, the accused is simply guilty even when proven innocent.  Thus, people in societies around the world need to reevaluate the ways in which they handle such off-the-cuff remarks by child made against their teachers.  Being a teacher is being set up to fail because kids say all kinds of things and parents and school boards blow their childish remarks way out of proportion.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the subtitles were not posted long enough to read them in English.

5401907,5,B00A9YBW0Y,"MADS MIKKELSEN, as Lucas, a kindergarten teacher falsely accused of sexual misconduct, delivers one of the finest performances I have seen by an actor in any film, ever.

Everything comes together in THE HUNT to create for viewers a powerful and disturbing experience: Thomas Vinterberg's direction, the script, the producers, a superb supporting cast--especially Annika Wedderkopp (the child accuser) and Thomas Bo Larsen, her father, who was also Lucas's friend--and just the entire galaxy of talent that made this film the extraordinary work of art that it is.

Even as I watched the film, Shirley Jackson's chilling short story, ""The Lottery,"" came to mind. The works have much in common, except that ""The Lottery"" is clearer to readers in the telling, with everything in black-and-white, whereas THE HUNT is infused with suspicion and doubt, cast in subtle shades of grey, and we are never entirely certain about anything in it. Both works, however, shock us with surprise endings.

I'm not going to say too much about the story of THE HUNT, because the plot is fairly straightforward, and you've seen it before. What is so remarkable is how skillfully nuanced the reactions are (by friends, co-workers, his own son, and a new woman in his life) to Lucas's plight. Yes, he is falsely accused, but we aren't sure of that, not at first. And we struggle to figure out what kind of man Lucas is.

A pretty woman who finds him attractive practically throws herself at him, and his response seems lukewarm, if that. What's with this? He's not attracted to women?

We do find out: Lucas is warm, kindhearted, sensitive, intelligent, and heterosexual, but Mikkelsen reveals the man slowly, action by action, reaction by reaction, until we feel that we truly know him. And once we do understand Lucas, we are horrified by the treatment he endures at the hands of people who ought to know better.

But how can they know better? A terrible thing has happened. It must have happened. A child, only five or six years old, has said that it happened. How can we not believe her? Well, maybe she's making it up.

But what if she isn't? What should we do? We can't take chances with something like this. We have to tell everyone. The entire community has a right to know. And so it goes, and with it, the portrayal of ""mob psychology"" is frightening: we think of ""The Lottery,"" of William Golding's LORD  OF THE FLIES, of Lyndon Johnson's disastrous foray into Vietnam--in other words, we think of tragic consequences when panic throws reason and social order into disarray.

THE HUNT has been criticized for glossing over relationships between Lucas and his son, and between Lucas and the new woman in his life. But I would suggest that these relationships are not what this film is about. I see the film as being more concerned with Lucas's connection with his community--to what Americans call ""we the people""--when a perverse and horrendous crime is thought to have been committed by one of their own.

A teacher in your child's school has been accused of exposing himself to your child.

What would you do?

This, it seems to me, is the question THE HUNT is asking. The film does not offer an answer and persuade you to accept it. The answer, the film seems to be saying, lies with you. With me. With all of us.

Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0

'The Hunt' takes its name from a fraternity of men in Denmark who bond over hunting. Except in the case of this film, the hunted is one of their own. Lucas is a kindergarten teacher who is having a hard time with his estranged ex-wife obtaining visitation rights in regards to their teenage son, Marcus. Things get a whole lot more difficult for Lucas when he's accused of molesting one of his nursery school pupils, little Klara, who also happens to be the daughter of his best friend and neighbor, Theo.

It's all a misunderstanding as little Klara sees some picture of naked men on her brother's iPad at home. But when she arrives at school and gives Lucas a kiss on the cheek, he tells her that the kiss should be for her own parents. Klara also can't understand why Lucas won't accept a heart shaped piece of embroidery she gives him. Before you know it Klara implies that she saw Lucas' erect penis. The school director calls in a male staff member who asks Klara leading questions. Lucas is then accused of additional sexual misconduct and the accusations spread like wildfire around the town, even before the police become involved.

The story becomes a cautionary tale of modern day witch hunts. Things like this have happened in the U.S., especially in cases where psychologists 'uncover' past abuse through alleged exploration of so-called repressed memories. The mere suggestion of misdeeds causes the purported victims to become convinced that criminal behavior may have occurred, when it actually did not.

The nightmare escalates for Lucas when almost all his friends desert him, including Theo, who is egged on by his wife, who's now in panic mode. Lucas bitterly throws his new girlfriend, Nadja, out of his house, as she expresses doubts as to his innocence.

One of the weaknesses of the story is that we never get to see Lucas interact with an attorney, nor are any of the courtroom scenes shown. Instead, another one of Lucas' best friends, Bruun, described as Marcus' 'godfather', helps with his defense. We learn that legal case against Lucas falls apart, after scores of children (after being coached by either their parents or school personnel) all accuse Lucas of sexual abuse, in the basement of his house. Police investigators, however, discover that Lucas has no basement!

Despite the legal victory, Lucas remains ostracized and in two powerful scenes, he's beaten up while attempting to buy food at a supermarket and then has his beloved dog, Fanny, killed by a faceless tormentor. Lucas still has two things going for him: the love of his son, Marcus and his determination to prove his innocence.

Lucas finally is able to bring most of the community back on his side when he confronts his former best friend, Theo, in church on Christmas eve. Theo was much affected beforehand, when he saw Lucas being beaten up at the supermarket. As a result of the confrontation, Theo talks with Klara, who again denies Lucas did anything wrong and he finally comes to believe Lucas' claims of innocence.

I'm not completely sure if I believe that Theo would have come to accept Lucas at the end, given the community pressure as well as the fears of his own wife. After all, he could have been ostracized by the community himself. But the way it turns out, after a year has passed, somehow many (not all) have forgiven Lucas, when we see that Marcus is being accepted as an adult into the local hunting society (animal rights people beware--this is NOT a touchy-feely movie toward animals, especially deer!).

Director Thomas Vinterberg throws in a twist at the end, when an anonymous hunter takes a shot at Lucas, just to remind him that not all in the community believe in his innocence.

'The Hunt' plays out highlighting the savagery lurking beneath a staid bourgeoisie society. Leaving out the legal battle on screen seems intentional, as the focus is on the errant community members, who decidedly refuse to give Lucas not one iota of a benefit of a doubt. Perhaps Vinterberg reasoned that this potboiler of a story might have ended up diluted, if he showed us a few more rational members of this community, pleading Lucas' case before the bar of justice.

Nonetheless, 'The Hunt' accomplishes what it sets out to do--a gripping tale of an innocent man falsely accused, fighting for himself and his way of life. Not all of it is necessarily completely believable, especially how Lucas ends up being restored to the community, through the efforts of his old friend, who finally sees the light. But that final gunshot is a tragic reminder, that not everyone is so forgiving, as Lucas' old pal, Theo.",1390521600,3,4688,4.809937888198758

5401913,5,B00A9YBW0Y,"Absolutely riveting study of claimed child sexual abuse by an adult male.  The understated acting and direction portrays how powerful the accuser can be, regardless of the merits of the accusation.

Wrongly accused of sexual misconduct with a young child, Mads Mikkelsen seethes and silently evaluates his plight while trying to understand why this personal catastrophe is unfolding before him and threatening his life, reputation and freedom.  Finally, after 3/4 of the film passes, the protagonist begins to stand up for himself- a welcome development.

As much as I expected this film to be a character study of the wrongly accused, and how they rise up to meet the challenge and viscerally defend themselves, Lucas' unwillingness to aggressively counterpunch is frustratingly courageous.

My one complaint is the ending- a one shot reminder that all is not past and rehabilitated. A simple derisive or angry stare by a townsperson would have accomplished the same thing, subtly, without the implication that Lucas feared for his life.  Or, in the woods, Lucas could have seen an adult male, innocently, with his hand resting on a child's shoulder.

5401916,4,B00A9YBW0Y,"Generally there is a last minute flurry to release potential Golden Globe and Oscar contenders as close as possible to the deadline, to keep them fresh in the critics' minds. The Hunt was released early last year, garnering a Best Actor award at Cannes for Mads Mikkelson's portrayal of Lucas.

This Danish movie, sensitively directed by Thomas Vinerberg, is set in a small village where Lucas is a kindergarten teacher. Klara (Annika Wedderkopp) behaves inappropriately towards Lucas, who tries to nip this in the bud by returning her gift to his best friend, Klara's father, Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen). In a fit of pique, the young Klara tells the nursery staff (with a fair amount of prompting) that Lucas displayed his genitals to her. Like the story of The Crucible, other children, resenting Klara's spotlight, join in with their own fabrications, further discrediting Lucas.

In a flash, Lucas' already troubled world is turned upside down. Ostracized by the little community, Theo tries to maintain tenuous contact, but his wife Agnes (Anne Louise Hassing) is adamant that Theo cut Lucas off. This separation is particularly painful for both parties. Overt acts of violence by other village residents follow.

Even though the incident resolves itself, it is a heartbreakingly sad movie. Some scenes had me in tears at how easily a community can turn on a decent man, without thorough investigation. Fine performances all round, but Mads Mikkelson as the quietly stoic Lucas, never becomes maudlin nor loses hope. The young Annika Wedderkopp is truly outstanding too as the sly misguided Klara.",1390348800,2,1598,5.138461538461539
5401917,5,B00A9YBW0Y,"Disturbing yet powerful film.  American audiences know Mads Mikkelsen as the primary villain in the James Bond movie ""Casino Royale"".  But he has been a successful leading man in Danish films for many years.  (Be sure to catch him in ""After the Wedding"".)

Mikkelsen plays a divorced father falsely accused of a sexual crime by a 6-year-old girl pouting because she got her feelings hurt for a few moments.  Just as frightening as his character living under that shadow is that the school leaders, the child psychologist, and the parents of the other schoolchildren take the lie as fact purely on faith without any kind of investigation, despite the man's protests of innocence.  Not only that, but in fact the school leaders and the child psychologist practically spoonfeed the little girl her story, so sure are they that her tentative self speaks an immutable truth.  When she feebly attempts to retract her story the adults simply don't believe her -- they even tell her that she is just trying to repress the memory.  The lie takes on a life of its own thanks to the unwillingness of the adults to give the man --- a lifelong member of the community --- the benefit of the doubt.

What happens to the man next is largely predictable, and check out the DVD bonus features for an alternate ending that is equally disturbing.

I made the mistake of going to Vudu and reading all the expert reviews there and ignored the member reviews. Big mistake! I also judged on the fact that it's got a high over all star rating here and there at Vudu. Yep the critics made this sound like some horrifying heart stopper,. The truth is this movie while well acted is slow, tedious and boring. I've seen a couple of what I consider far better films on the subject. This one applies to much bland reality to it. There's no suspense at all, no sense of dread, not much emotion either. There's nothing that kept me drawn in. I mean the people in the film play this sort of like it would happen in real life, but it's downright not all that interesting. I love foreign movies, and don't mind subtitles, but sometimes the titles here moved too fast and I did miss about 15% of the entire sentences here and there in the movie. The actor playing the lead, I thought he was fine, but it's a role that is not all that demanding if you want my opinion. I understand he has already won a couple best actor awards for this at a couple of prestigious film festivals, but I don't see what all the fuss is about. I couldn't see much all that memorable about his performance. Though I agree the film tells the story in a believable way, there are also holes in the story that didn't make any sense to me. And I also don't think the title is fitting at all. Primarily there was no ""Hunt"" at all. Once they started to question this man and if or not he was perhaps a pedophile, they weren't hunting him, they were avoiding him or telling him he's not welcome.

5401935,5,B00A9YBW0Y,"Best Picture- Hands Down
Mads MIkkelson- Oscar for Best Actor- Should win hands down in my opinion.
Best supporting actor oscars- Rest of cast of The Hunt.  There is no other film that comes close.

This film in the most realistic way I have ever seen (or can envision seeing it) shows the quietly disgusting side of humanity and mob mentality at its worst, but not the kind with the pitchfork where you get strung up in the square, but the kind where the mob lurks in the shadows too cowardly to own up to their horrific behavior.

Here's it is.  What happens when someone is falsely accused of a horrific act by a child?  Well the Hunt ventures into this territory like no other film I have ever seen.  As I was watching it, I said to myself, how stupid can people be, to always blindly believe children, when they are prone to wild tales of exaggeration and lying as a matter of course?  How can you simply disbelieve and turn your back on a friend you have had your whole life over an unproven and utterly ridiculous allegation?

  Moreover, how disgusting can officials be in asking loaded questions of little children so that any which way they answer, a horrific accusation is made. And the answer is sickeningly simple.  It is easy for people to be this way.  To be so void of common sense, to let fear grip them in such fashion as to make them forget all sense of right and wrong and perspective.

And that is why the Hunt is like a quiet, yet raking shot gun blast to the face.  The more you watch the Hunt the more you realize that this could very well happen and just in this way.  You will be very angry ( and I mean seething vengeance minded angry) watching the Hunt, because there truly is no justice or peace once accused.  And the worst part is, you know it happens in real life, far too often, and ultimately you simply have no other option but to churn inside because you know it can be you in a heart beat that this could happen to.  One of the best films ever made.  Ever.

If you watch anything at all over the next 10 years, do yourself a giant favor and watch this masterpeice that is the equivalent of someone performing surgery on your heart and stomach with a wrench.  Incredible stuff.",1388966400,2,2213,4.325242718446602

(This paragraph is a semi-spoiler: be ye warned!) The ending was the only part that was not completely satisfying. Left much to the imagination (which was perhaps the purpose). However, it was not bad. Only puzzling.

Parents and those concerned with content should be aware of the following: There is a scene with a large naked man jumping into a lake. This is non-sexual and humorous, but his buttocks and genitalia are exposed briefly. In a disturbing scened (SPOILER) a little girl is shown an image of hardcore pornography. The image makes it to the screen, exposing a penis. This is brief, but is still very graphic and disturbing. There is a brief sex scene where the main character's buttocks are seen briefly. The movie is about sexual abuse, so the content and dialogue of the film is related to the topic. Be warned of graphic and explicit detail, sometimes muttered by children. There are a few mildly violent scenes; some blood, no gore. There is a fair amount of language.

5401947,5,B00A9YBW0Y,"THE HUNT as directed by Thomas Vinterberg (The Celebration) is a profoundly moving film that should be seen by everyone. Co-written with Tobias Lindholm, the film takes a brave stand on the current obsession with pedophilia, demonstrating that at times the accusing children are the true criminals when the stories are fabricated by the 'abused ones'. One of the reasons this film is so powerful is the extraordinary acting by Mads Mikkelsen who offers one of the most impressive performances on film.

Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is a 42 year- old teacher whose life has recently been bruised by divorce and the loss of custody of his son. He has found work in a very small Danish town as a teacher of kindergarten where his students and faculty and parents love him for his kindness and his exceptional skills in dealing with children. He meets an eligible girl Nadja (Alexandra Rappaport) who is eager to establish a relationship with him, and finally his ex-wife is allowing his son to come live with him. But everything about his life becomes a nightmare when one of his pupils Klara (Annika Wedderkoop), the young daughter of his best friend Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen), who adores Lucas suddenly turns on him, creating a lie she shares with the school principal Grethe (Susse Wold). Grethe `believes children' and Lucas is cast out of the community as a pedophile. Even Theo refuses to hear Lucas' denial about the lie as well as the folk in the little church in the town. The degree of agony one child's lie creates in the life of the innocent Lucas is almost unbearable to observe.

Throughout the story and the film Mads Mikkelsen delivers a highly nuanced performance, one that will remain indelibly imprinted on viewers' minds - hopefully. This is a brilliant little film. In Danish and English with subtitles. Grady Harp, December 13",1388361600,3,1837,4.8471337579617835

5401957,5,B00A9YBW0Y,"Pedophilia is a very touchy subject.  I take it very personally.  Ive seen the effect that it has on children and on parents, and being a parent myself I honestly abhor nothing more than child abuse.  I find nothing as repugnant, disgusting and reprehensible than the molestation of an innocent child and so films that touch upon this subject usually spark something almost primal in me.

I want to kill people.

The Hunt dares to pretty much break every preconceived notion I have towards the subject and dares to make me question everything I think I know and or feel about the subject.  No, The Hunt does not make me side with pedophilia, that is not what I mean.  What I mean is that The Hunt dares to question the integrity of a child and the condemning nature of a community stricken by fear of a monster.  This is precisely where The Hunt soars as a social commentary, because it presents a portrait of humanity that feels extremely authentic and honest; brutally so.

I cant remember the last time I was this uncomfortable and this frustrated while watching a film.

Thomas Vinterbergs melodrama from Denmark covers a terrible time in the life of Lucas, a man working at a Kindergarten and going through a rough divorce.  While he struggles to see more of his son, Marcus, he gives of himself to all who surround him with love, including the children he supervises at the school.  He is a charming and kindhearted man, but when his best friends young daughter, Klara, shows him special attention, he does his best to direct her affections elsewhere.  This causes a problem, for when Klara gets her feelings wounded she makes some harsh comments that are misconstrued by Grethe, the headmistress at the Kindergarten, and soon Lucas is being accused and practically crucified as a pedophile, despite a jarring lack of evidence and no real accusation made by Klara (outside of an obviously coaxed one).  Immediately, Lucas is ostracized.  His once welcoming and comforting community has now turned their backs on him and have outright lashed out at him.  His best friend has shut him out and his life begins to completely spiral downward.

The Hunt makes a very bold statement with regards to our reputations; for once they are tarnished they are rarely ever restored completely.

Where The Hunt succeeds is in conflicting our emotions in such a unique way.  As I mentioned, I find child abuse to be utterly repulsive.  I loathe nothing more.  This is why The Hunt is so frustrating.  As the viewer, you know that he is innocent, and so when he is ostracized, condemned and violently mistreated you are frustrated because it feels so unjust, but when you factor in the fact that you are the ONLY one who knows of his innocence, it becomes frustrating in a different way.  You realize that you understand and completely agree with his mistreatment.  Had you been in the shoes of the community, youd feel the same way and possibly react in the same manner, and while I wanted to punch Grethe in the face for destroying Lucass reputation by taking it upon herself to handle the situation, I almost sympathize with her because, in that situation (she felt betrayed and even partially at fault for possibly allowing something like that to happen on her watch so-to-speak), you may have possibly done the same thing.

The Hunt also marvelously showcases how panic can spread like a virus in close communities, for once an accusation is made soon its being made ten times over.

The one issue I take with the film is the conclusion, although not entirely.  In fact, my issue is merely a technicality to be honest and the more I think about it the less it bothers me.  Initially, I found the suddenness of the final scenes to feel rushed and not very well thought out.  There should have been a few sequences of progression that would have colored in the lines a tad and helped us to accept the surface acceptance that Lucas experiences in the finale.

That being said, the final scene is perfection and further solidifies the themes Vinterberg and Lindholm create here.

The performances by the entire cast are extraordinary.  Mad Mikkelsen has been getting some seriously great ink for his very honest portrayal of Lucas, but for me it was Thomas Bo Larsen who stole the whole film.  As the conflicted father, broken at the seams at the thought of his very best friend abusing his daughter, I connected to him on a personal level and felt his every shudder.  His breakdown at his daughters bedside shook me to my core.  Annika Wedderkopp is also rather sensational here, delivering a powerfully stirring child performance that feels organic and understanding.

As a whole, The Hunt is unlike anything Ive ever seen on the subject, for it refuses to take a stand on either side of the situation and merely presents it to us in an honest and remarkably astute light.",1387497600,3,4863,4.720379146919432

5401961,4,B00A9YBW0Y,"SPOILERS.
Here in America, we have waited a year for this movie, which got rave reviews in Europe and England. Finally it arrived, just in time for the Oscars. I hope Mads gets the Oscar. I am, once more, impressed by the emotional range, the precision, and the visceral power of his acting. When he crawls into his couch, like a beaten dog, after the fight in the church, you don't see the ""handsome and sexy man,"" as he is often touted, but a miserable man at the end of his tether. Mads is a towering actor.

The plot of the movie is tight and suspenseful, but I was troubled by two things which, in my view, diminish its true greatness.
Yes, the whole village turns against Lucas when the false rumors that he is a child molester take wings. Men in the supermarket beat him up within an inch of his life, and others ignore him, as if he were a ghost, the one who lived amongst them all his life.  But some men support him: his son Marcus is his passionate advocate, and so is Marcus's godfather. Even Ole, Klara's father, sometimes doubts Lucas's guilt, reflects on it, and is determined to find the truth.

By contrast, the women in the movie seem like some Greek mythology furies who want to tear Lucas apart. They are all impervious to doubt and reason. Perhaps the worst one is Grethe, in whose kindergarten this drama occurred. As soon as Klara reveals to her that Lucas molested her, Grethe gets into action. She never allows Lucas to defend himself but immediately announces the false accusation to all the parents and the village. Before the police has a chance to investigate Lucas, Grethe calls a friend to interrogate Klara. When Klara--all four years of her--tries to deny the accusation or pedal it back, Grethe insists that Klara repeat the accusation.  This interrogation is chilling.

Klara's mother is also furious with Lucas, perhaps understandably. But when poor Klara, who sees the havoc she had unwittingly created, wants to repair her mistake and tell her mother the truth that Lucas had done nothing wrong, the mother won't have it. She tells Klara that the molestation happened, certainly, and that Klara just wants to repress the awful memory.

Lucas's ex-wife, as we hear her on the phone, is also nasty and hysterical.

Who then is more rational? Perhaps Lucas's American girl-friend? Well, no. When Lucas tells her about the accusation laid against him, she bursts out laughing. Really, she laughs. She later tries to cover it up, but she seems not to know or care really if he is a child molester. He throws her out, and good for him. But at the end of the movie, they are back together again. How did the reconciliation take place? And for that matter, how did the other reconciliations take place? Why and how does Lucas forgive what they had done to him? How do they ask (do they?) for his forgiveness?  This is certainly an essential part of this story, but we are not privy to it. Perhaps the director had no time or money to develop this part, but without it, I feel that the movie is incomplete, cut at the knees.",1387065600,7,3053,4.568555758683729
5401962,5,B00A9YBW0Y,"Wow! This movie feels so realistic. We instinctively believe children when they tell us things. We completely forget that below a certain age, kids cannot tell the difference between the truth , a lie or something their imagination came up with.

Also, it shows that people when they are invested in something, even if it is proven untrue, it can be difficult for them to let go. Excellent acting all round.

Writing, directing, acting and cinematography all come together perfectly. Watching Lucas go from beloved teacher and friend to a wrongly accused outcast is heart breaking to watch. In a typical Hollywood movie Lucas would have railed at his accusers in great dramatic fashion but Mads plays Lucas as a man who knows his innocence and doesn't try to convince anyone that he is. He just quietly tries to go about his life. The ending is brilliant because it brings home the lasting effects that the one lie will have on him the rest of his life, no matter how normal life may appear to be after time has passed.

You are on the edge of your seat rooting for this man's life to somehow turn around.  Mads Mikkelsen - best known to American audiences as ""Hannibal"" on the TV series - stars in this film.  He has been a major star in Europe for years, and how lucky we are to finally have him in the USA.  He plays a character, Lucas, who is wrongfully accused of sexually assaulting a small child, the daughter of his best friend.  He is the victim of vicious lies that snowball out of control.  Everyone can relate to what this character is going through because we have all at some time been the victim of rumors and lies.  Except that what this character is going through is 1,000 times worse than most things I can think of.  The supporting cast are all perfect in their roles.  Although Mads Mikkelsen's role on ""Hannibal"" is striking, it gives us a limited view of his acting abilities.  But there is nothing this actor cannot do.  I know, because after seeing ""The Hunt,"" I rented or bought about 8 of his films, and I would recommend that you do the same.  I haven't been this impressed with an actor in about 10 years.

Furthermore, how often do we really fear for ourselves vs. the fear we have for our loved ones? What lengths do we go when we assume danger beyond the terrible? The Hunt doesn't simply function off of fear  the energy comes from the lie and the power of accusation. This is where we find Mads Mikkelsen,caught in the drama of humiliation when a 5 year old girl suggests sexual misconduct, and a poison spreads throughout a small town in Denmark. A bold,intense, and raw film the depicts the horrific effects of pedophilia on the human spirit, yet equally the effects of a lie which could be so ostentatious that perhaps our own views of this issue (with respect to schools, churches, and other organizations) is skewed. Our media obsessed culture doesn't factor into small-town Denmark when we contemplate rumor and tabloid. We should also sincerely consider adding this film to the collection of greatest Christmas movies of all time for its honesty of the season. Not in the jaded melancholy the way Bad Santa (2003, Terry Zwigoff) portrays the holidays  but rather the honest emotions evoked by the season. The Hunts Christmas is stripped of the commercialism and replaced with simplicity; small arts and crafts and a very old-fashioned spirit that seems reminiscing of older generations. What are the emotions we feel at Christmas, particularly the eve and day of? We are always suggested for it to be a time of joy, yet often we feel at lost, a sense of loneliness and despair. Mikkelsen delivers the most American and most un-American depiction of Christmas in his scene the church. When all is done,The Hunt reveals the awful truth that behind accusations  we are never exonerated  we continue to live a perpetual state of fear and suspecting hatred.",1514419200,,1885,4.862928348909658

8548808,5,B00A9YBW0Y,I love love love this movie! But because of the content it is hard to watch multiple times and it makes you angry! You definitely have to be in a certain mood and headspace to watch this movie. Which just means it did its job and made you feel what you're supposed to feel with this subject matter. Mads Mikkelsen is the reason I bought this movie and is the reason this movie shines! His performance is enduring and heartbreaking and plain out oscar-worthy and I'm not surprised that this film was up for best foreign language film. It deserves it and he deserves all the accolades he got for it.,1513036800,2,597,4.387387387387387
