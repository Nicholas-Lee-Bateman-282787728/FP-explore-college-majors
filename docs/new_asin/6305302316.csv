1007316,5,6305302316,"This 7th volume of ""The Twilight Zone"" series of DVDs issued by Image Entertainment, Inc., is a first-rate installment. Two of these four half-hour ""TZ"" episodes are a couple of the best in the Rod Serling TV series, IMHO. Those two episodes being: ""The Hitch-Hiker"", starring the lovely Inger Stevens, and ""Shadow Play"" with Dennis Weaver.

The other two programs on the disc are ""Perchance To Dream"" and ""King Nine Will Not Return"". Both earn an ""OK"" rating by yours truly, but fall short of the quality of the other two programs on the DVD.

Video quality is excellent on all of these Image Twilight Zone discs, with very good audio quality as well. Video is displayed in the standard TV ratio of 1.33:1; while the audio is in 2.0 Dolby Digital Mono.

The 1960 tension-filled TZ classic episode, ""The Hitch-Hiker"", stars 25-year-old Swedish beauty Inger Stevens, who tragically committed suicide at age 35 in April 1970. Inger plays ""Nan Adams"", who is driving alone across the country and keeps seeing the same shabbily-dressed hitch-hiker along the roadside. She can't seem to shake him. He's always there, no matter how fast she drives to elude him. It's an absorbing and effectively-told tale of one woman's growing fear and apprehension. The hitch-hiker's final line of dialogue caps off the episode in fine fashion. One of THE best ""Zones"" ever made.

Ironically, ""The Hitch-Hiker"" in many ways mirrors the plot of the 1971 Steven Spielberg TV-movie, ""Duel"", which starred Dennis Weaver, who just happens to be the star of the other top-notch episode on this TZ DVD.

""Shadow Play"", as noted, is my other fave on this platter. It is ""Zone"" episode #62, airing in May of 1961. Dennis Weaver portrays the tortured death-row prisoner ""Adam Grant"". It's not physical torture that Mr. Grant is forced to endure, but rather a mental agony, stemming from his own horror-filled dreams of being put to death -- over and over again. This is yet another excellent TZ script, and Weaver is simply outstanding in his role here as a man who cannot escape his persistent nightmare.

Chalk up Volume 7 as another winner in the Image Entertainment series of ""Twilight Zone"" Digital Discs.",1101168000,14,2180,4.894308943089431
1007317,4,6305302316,"The illusion of reality is explored in Volume 7 of ""The Twilight Zone.""  In ""Perchance to Dream,"" written by Charles Beaumont from his own short story, Edward Hall (Richard Conte) tells his psychiatrist (John Larch) about nightmarish dreams in which Maya (Suzanne Lloyd), a carnival dancer, is trying to scare him to death.  Because of a heart condition, if the dreams do not kill Hall, trying to stay awake will.  Beaumont continues his exploration of dreams in ""Shadow Play,"" which features a memorable performance by Dennis Weaver as Adam Grant, a condemned prisoner who will be executed.  Grant insists he is having a recurring nightmare and that when he dies everyone else will cease to exist.  In Rod Serling's ""King Nine Will Not Return,"" Captain James Embry (Bob Cummings) wakes up besides the wreckage of his B-25 bomber, ""King Nine,"" and frantically searches for his crew as odd visions persist.  Inger Stevens and Leonard Strong turn in strong performances as Nan Adams and the title character in Serling's ""The Hitch-Hiker,"" based on the radio play of that name by Lucille Fletcher.  Following a blowout, Nan repeatedly sees the same hitch-hiker as she travels along the highway.  Since this is, after all, the Twilight Zone, we all know the true identity of the hitch-hiker.  The two Beaumont Zones are superior the pair of Serling efforts, although none of the four really qualify as outright classics.  Still, this is an interesting ""theme"" volume in this DVD set.",990403200,3,1479,5.0
1007318,4,6305302316,"Image is releasing these original Twilight Zone episodes NOT in the order  of the original broadcast date (which I would've preferred), but rather in  a way so that each volume contains episodes that have roughly similar  themes.  The result is often that the best episodes, mostly the earlier  ones in the series' 5-season run, are scattered among different  volumes.
Volume 7, however, is one of the better ones, since 3 of the 4  episodes selected are among the best in the series: ""The  Hitchhiker"", ""Perchance to Dream"", ""Shadow Play"".  The weakest of the 4 in my opinion is ""King Nine will not Return""  but many people like it and think it's one of the best also.  All 4  episodes are about hallucinations or dreams that doom the  protagonist.
Picture and sound qualities are superb throughout.  The DVD  also include extra material such as episode descriptions, biographical  notes, and trivias.
It is hard to find TV stations that show TZ episodes  these days, and even when they do, they sometimes don't show all the  episodes (especially the 1-hour ones), and episodes are almost always  edited for time.  The TZ episodes on these volumes are uncut and  uninterrupted; and for TZ fans they definitely worth collecting.
Programs  like The Twilight Zone are a dead genre.  Today's viewers aren't likely to  watch a sci-fi show without expecting special effects and action scenes.  TZ had no flashy effects and rapid actions, only IDEAS that provoke our  thoughts and stimulate our imaginations.",968112000,37,1502,4.979757085020243
1007319,3,6305302316,"I'll have to admit,  I'm not a huge Twilight Zone fan, but I do like it.  My favorites have always been the space type ones, or time travel, aliens etc.
This DVD contains three stories.
Perchance to Dream is about a man  who is terrified to sleep because he thinks a mysterious woman is trying to  kill him in his dreams.  I found it average.
The Hitch-Hiker is about a  woman travelling to L.A. She see's this hitchiker ever so often on her trip  and starts getting more and more afraid.  I liked it.  It had a cool spooky  kind of a fell and the ending is the kind I like.
King Nine Will Not  Return is about a WWII Captain who awakes to find his plane downed and his  crew missing.  He freaks out in the desert and sees Jet planes in the sky.  They haven't even been invented yet, but he knows what they are.  Strange,  but enjoyable.
Shadow Play is the story of a man who dreams the same  dream everynight and is always electrocuted at the end of it.  He pleads  with the courts to let him live because it is driving him mad in his real  life.  This one was a bore.
The DVD features are okay.  Trivia, Serling  biography, history of the Twilight Zone, cast info, season-by-season  comments, and reviews.  All features are text based so they aren't that  exciting.  The menus are neat, but get pretty tiresome after a little while  because of their slow load time.",926812800,9,1367,4.275590551181103

7887304,5,6305302316,"""Perchance To Dream"" with Richard Conte is a classic. It is horrific in nature and the image of Suzanne Lloyd as Maya the mysterious woman is haunting to this day. Definitely written by Charles Beaumont. Richard Conte plays a man terrified of falling asleep. If he succumbs to the alluring and spellbinding mysterious woman he meets in his dreams he fears she will murder him in his dream and simultaneously kill him in reality. He must never fall asleep again.

""The Hitch-Hiker"" is another haunting episode about a woman (Inger Stevens) who is driving cross-country and continually sees the same lonely and strange looking hitch-hiker on the road ahead. This is a eerily frightening episode written by Rod Serling and directed by Alvin Ganzer. It is a classic well remembered episode.

""King Nine Will Not Return"" is yet another haunting episode. Bob Cummings is Captain James Embry of the WWII B-25 Mitchell bomber that has crashed in the desert. He is alone except for the wreckage of his plane. All of his crew are gone. He does find the grave of one of his crew and suddenly sees jet aircraft in the sky, which are impossible to have existed during WWII. It gets better. I have seen Bob Cummings many times in films and on television and I must say this may be his best performance ever. This is a very good episode written by Rod Serling and directed by Buzz Kulik. This was the opening episode of the Second Season and the first to feature the Marius Constant Twilight Zone theme.

The nightmare quality of ""Shadowplay"" is riveting and disturbing in nature. It was written by Charles Beaumont in his typical fashion and directed by John Brahm. It deals with a man who tries to convince everyone involved in his trial that is just part of a dream, a nightmare. Dennis Weaver's performance of that man is devastating.

In all, these are four very good, haunting and memorable episodes from THE TWILIGHT ZONE.",1421107200,,1914,4.721556886227545

7887307,4,6305302316,"Volume 7 in the ""Twilight Zone"" DVD series features one of the most outstanding and memorable episodes from the series as well as three other thought provoking stories. The theme for this volume deals with dreams in some form or another. Or maybe they are really more like nightmares!

Number one on the disc is ""Perchance to Dream"". In the story a man, played by Richard Conte, goes to see a doctor because he has been afraid to sleep for four days now. It's all because of a mysterious woman who appears in his dreams and he is sure she will in some way cause his death. Not a bad episode but also not on of the best either. ""Perchance to Dream"" is from the first season of the show and for trivia fans this was the first episode that wasn't written by Rod Serling. It was instead Charles Beaumont's first contribution instead as a writer to the series.

The second episode on the DVD is a true classic from the series and one of the creepiest of TZ. It is titled ""The Hitch-Hiker"" and stars Inger Stevens who at the start of the story is having the tire on her car replaced after having a blow out. She is traveling cross country by herself and she has a problem. It starts as she is leaving after her tire has been changed and sees a creepy little man trying to thumb a ride. As she goes down the road a bit to her surprise she sees this same creepy man again still trying to thumb a ride from her. Of course this both scares and confuses her as to why he keeps trying to get her to stop as well as how he keeps getting ahead of her on the road even though it doesn't look like anyone else is stooping to give him a ride. It will lead in the ending to her finding out the answers to all her questions.

 ""King Nine Will Not Return"" is the third story on volume 7 and it seems to be one of those episodes where either the viewer likes it or doesn't care to much for it. I tend to fall more towards the ladder. Not a bad episode but not great too. It stars Robert Cummings as a World War II pilot whose plane has crashed in the desert. He is all alone. Can't find the rest of his crew anywhere and then there is those futuristic airplanes flying overhead. Under normal circumstances that would be an extremely unusual event. But then this is the Twilight Zone.

The disc concludes with the story ""Shadow Play"", one of the most intriguing episodes from the series. It stars Dennis Weaver who claims he and everyone else around him are in a reoccurring nightmare. One where he is on trail in a courtroom and is being sentenced to death. He tried to convince everyone around him this is all just a dream and they have gone through this over and over again in the past and will continue to do so in the future. Of course people think he is crazy and nothing Weaver tells them can get them to change their minds about him or the situation they are in. It leaves the viewer to decide if its a dream or not. A pretty good episode from the series.

For any fan of the ""Twilight Zone"" you will want to get this volume because of the great stories on here. For someone who has never seen the show before this can make an excellent introduction to both the show and to Rod Serling.",1389312000,,3172,4.183306055646481
7887308,5,6305302316,This DVD had one of my favorite Twilight Zones episodes on it. It brings back many memories of my childhood.,1364342400,,108,4.45
7887309,5,6305302316,"Another great classic fearfull tale by Rod Serling! I got this dvd just becuase of the eriee tall of ""The Hitch-Hicker"" with (Inger Stevens)starring as the inasent driver heading towards California, Oakland but is soon disturbed by a strange drifter on the side of the road no matter how far ahead of him she is he seems to be always following her everywhere she goes... But soons comes across a eriee ending? --- It is kinda hard to understand though I had to watch it more than once to totally understand the full storyline.

A must get product for any Twilight Zone fan and it's all because of this one Twilight Zone Episode ""The Hitch-Hicker"" A MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1294963200,2,670,4.677966101694915
7887310,5,6305302316,"All of these episodes make references to dreams. In ""Shadow Play,"" a convincted man claims his sentence and execution is a dream. Watch for the white horse prop in the D.A.'s living room that makes an appearance in ""The Jungle"" and ""A Most Unusual Camera."" In ""King Nine Will Not Return,"" Cummings suffers a nightmare -- and was later pissed because Serling would not submit the episode for Emmy consideration. Cummings could have played the role in Serling's ""The Loner"" had relations not been severed. ""Perchance to Dream"" is the first of Charles Beaumont's clever stories and a man who suffers from a recurring dream. Suzanne Lloyd, who played Maya, the Cat Girl, spent hours watching tigers and lions at a zoo to imitate the actions of a cat for this episode. ""The Hitch-Hiker,"" well . . . better than give away a bit of trivia, go to bear manor media (dot) com and look up The Twilight Zone (biography) and read up on it.

Trivia above supplied not from the DVD, but from the book, ""The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic"" because the 800 plus page book is a P-E-R-F-E-C-T companion to the DVD. Before or after you watch an episode, you can use the book to uncover the in-jokes, bloopers and trivia that make viewing these episodes fun. Both are available on Amazon.",1222214400,,1294,4.650655021834061
