8134370,1,B000GRTR7O,"This play is horrible.  The first half hour is pointless.  I couldn't even continue to watch after all the overacting and failure to get to the point.  The audio is low too and not clear enough.  Shelly Garrett needs a little help with production, and storyline.",1182297600,12,262,4.630434782608695
8134371,1,B000GRTR7O,"This was the worst low budget play I wish I hadn't purchase. The singing and acting was awful, don't waste your money.",1181606400,17,118,4.409090909090909
