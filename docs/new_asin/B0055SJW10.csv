4581223,3,B0055SJW10,"First off Sy Fy / Aslylum enthusiasts should be aware that the Piranha flick isn't Roger Corman's classic, nor the remake, nor the double D. It's an old grindhouse flick ""Piranha, Piranha!"" with little piranha in it. Also Attack of the Giant Leeches is not the remake (Yes, they remade it) but the classic b/w film.

Having said that - this goes for the cheap, usually used for $1. You Get Mega Piranha and Mega Shark vs Octopus (two greats in the mega series), 30,000 leagues and Beneathe Loch Ness. It's a really good deal. But with Mills Creek expect inconstant quality of their transfers. Mills Creek mostly puts out 50 packs of public domain flicks ranging from god awful to great. Luckily this is mostly good. There's no rhyme or reason to this collection - but it's a fun batch for movie parties",1341619200,7,802,4.569444444444445

4581230,4,B0055SJW10,"I chose this rating because on this DVD there was six movies presented and there was two of them that I didn't really care for. Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus was a pretty good movie. It had a lot of action and a lot of monster action, the only problem I had was that some of the CGI was obvious and somewhat outrageous but overall it was a good movie to watch. Beneath Lochness was another good movie about Nessie and although Mega Piranha had some outrageous and unbelievable computer generated graphics it was an okay movie. I liked attack of the Giant Leeches, it was an old classic. When people of a small swamp town began disappearing the townspeople was blaming a newcomer until it was proved that some giant leeches were to blame. The movie Piranha, I did not like. I did not see any piranhas until the very end of the movie. Most of this movie was about a photographer and her brother running from poachers. Boring movie. 30,000 Leagues under the sea was somewhat disappointing and boring as well. I would tell anyone that wanted these movies to buy them separately that way they wouldn't have to settle for ones they didn't like.",1367712000,,1136,4.492753623188406

4581233,3,B0055SJW10,"This is a moderately entertaining set of films IF you take them for what they are.  I've given it 3 stars overall, even though none of the movies would rank 3 stars, just simply taking into account the value of 6 movies for less than a buck a piece.  Heck, you might even like 1 or 2 enough to watch them more than once.

Here is a brief review, including a legend for reference.  AS = Adult Situations  SS = Sexual Situations
L - Language  N = Nudity  BN = Brief Nudity  V = Violence and/or Terror  and Gore.  I'll note if any are graphic.

A brief synopsis of each movie;

Mega Shark versus Giant Octopus - Starring Deborah Gibson (singer Debbie Gibson), Lorenzo Lamas, Vic Chao, and Mark Hengst.  A military mishap causes a glacier to break open releasing, not 1 but 2 prehistoric creatures, a giant octopus and a Megalodon (giant shark long extinct).  They rampage the oceans and ultimately must be vanquished by the scientist.  Fair acting with a decently interesting story, did I really say that???  2 1/4 stars.  V, L, AS

Mega Piranha - another ""The Asylum"" mockbuster release, mocking Piranha 3D.  I am being generous with 1 1/2 stars .  Genetically altered fish..... okay,  extremely large....okay,  feeding frenzies galore....okay,  .....But fish that not only consume ships but blow up hotels, house sized fish with the ability to leap dozens of yards into the air and onto shore that explode on impact devastating ocean front property... c'mon.  Sorry, I just cant' be that generous,  1 1/4 star because the piranha do look kinda cool.  AS, V, don't remember any language or so on but I am trying very hard to forget this.

Beneath Loch Ness.  Actually not bad.  Pretty good creature FX.  Decent acting, directing and writing.  Yes, there are some oversights, like calling the US Coast Guard after the 1st mishap on Loch Ness in SCOTLAND.  But overall good.  Seismic activity releases a hungry fella with a bad attitude.  AS, V, maybe a little language.  2 3/4 stars.

30,000 Leagues Under the Sea - Stars the B movie man himself Lorenzo Lamas.  Also starring Sean Lawler, Natalie Stone, and Kim Little.  Modern day offering of the Jules Vern novel with decent creature FX, good sets (for the most part), some actually fair to good acting and moderately interesting. 2 1/2 stars  V, L, AS, SS

Disc 2;

Attack of the Giant Leeches - 1959 release that is still fairly interesting.  B&W movie with the over acting, under acting and 50's scifi drama you can't get enough of, well maybe ya can, but still a decent offering for a change.  Men in Leech (?) suits terrorize a small swamp community.  Actually pretty racey for 1959.  Stars Yvette Vickers (Playboy centerfold in 1959) showing more skin than is customary then (no nudes) as an adulterous wife caught in the act by hubby who forces her and her lover into the swamp where the men... er... leeches attack... good stuff here.  Incidentally it was remade in 2009 but very poorly from what I've read.  V, AS, SS 2 stars Hey, c'mon, it's classic!

Piranha - No not the 1978 Roger Corman pic, nor any other film sharing this title.  This is the 1972 release starring william Smith (always the bad guy it seems) Peter Brown, Anha Capri.  I'd like to say it has more cheese than Kraft but that would mean it had substance.  Large quantities of film of planes, motorcycles, and nature.  Has a good use as relief from insomnia. Picture transfer is bad, but that might be good.  SS, AS, V  >1 star.

You have a decent value at $6 or less total cost.  If you want you can pic it up sometimes for <$4.00 shipped here.  Worth it!",1354665600,11,3583,4.563091482649842

8458801,3,B0055SJW10,"""Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus""

Released in 2009, ""Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus"" chronicles events after an illegal military experiment accidentally unleashes two prehistoric creatures frozen in mid-combat: A Megalodon shark and an equally colossal octopus. The beasts start wreaking havoc on the world, attacking ships, oil drills, and even airplanes at 28,000 feet. A marine biologist (Deborah ""Debbie"" Gibson) teams up with her former professor (Sean Lawlor) and a Japanese man (Vic Chao) and they, in turn, hook up with the military (lead man played by Lorenzo Lamas) to provoke a fatal battle between the shark and octopus

Considering the cheesy title and the fact that this is a The Asylum movie, you basically know what you're going to get  A Grade C creature feature with cartoony non-special effects. Whether it's entertaining or not depends on (1.) how compelling the story is and (2.) the quality of the cast. While the story is only mildly compelling and sometimes downright dull, the likable cast makes up for it. There's a palpable warmth to the relationships of the four protagonists (despite some gruffness here and there); and the way two of 'em hook-up romantically is almost touching, not to mention you can tell they all had a good time making the flick. There are also a couple of laugh-out-loud moments, which shows that the filmmakers regarded the material in a tongue-in cheek way, as in ""Yes, we know this is schlock, but we're going to have a good time and hope the viewer does too."" There are also numerous cool visuals (of the sea, mountains, beaches, etc.) plus an intense stand-off in the last act, which is pretty effective. Lastly, Debbie is still cute and a pleasure to behold. But none of these positives can redeem the movie from what it is  a mildly amusing low-budget giant monster flick with weak effects. Nevertheless, it's worth seeing IF the positives trip your trigger.

The film runs 88 minutes and was shot in the Greater Los Angeles area of Southern California.

GRADE: C-

====================

""Beneath Loch Ness""

Released in 2001, ""Beneath Loch Ness"" chronicles events at the popular loch in Scotland as a team of researchers try to find the infamous ""monster."" The team is played by Brian Wimmer, Lysa Apostle, David Andriole, Chris Taaffe and Lysette Anthony. Their work is complicated by the presence of local teams playing a Nessie stunt. Patrick Bergin is on hand as a vengeful Scottish fisherman.

While not as polished and weighty as 1996's ""Loch Ness"" with Ted Danson, ""Beneath Loch Ness"" is better than 2008's ""Beyond Loch Ness"" (aka ""Loch Ness Terror""). Despite the obvious budget limitations, I'm giving it a mild 'thumbs up' because the cast and story drew me into the world of the characters. Plus there's an interesting twist revealed in the third act. In other words, this isn't just another movie about encountering Nessie, although Nessie's in it. Lacking the funds for quality F/X, the filmmakers make the right decision to hold off showing the creature till the very end, where the CGI is cartoony but serviceable for a low-budget flick from 2001. After just viewing the laughably bad ""Mega Piranha,"" I was ready for the worst, but ""Beneath Loch Ness"" surprised me as a respectable nature-runs-amok flick. It's far from great, but it's not bad either. Despite the lack of funds, the filmmakers took the project seriously and it shows. Critics nitpick the Scottish accents and stereotypes, but who cares about that? Besides, stereotypes exist because there's SOME truth them.

The film runs 96 minutes and was shot in Scotland and Castaic Lake, Santa Clarita, California. I'm assuming that establishing shots were done in Scotland with the actual movie being shot at Castaic Lake, CA. If so, they chose a convincing stand-in for Loch Ness. Excellent job on this front.

GRADE: B-

====================

""30,000 Leagues Under the Sea""

Released in 2007, ""30,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" features an eccentric billionaire madman, Captain Nemo, who's obsessed with the underwater world and threatens to destroy the surface with only his underwater utopia remaining. His ship, The Nautilus, is a mobile submarine city and includes civilians. It's up to a Naval rescue crew, led by Natalie Stone and Lorenzo Lamas, to stop him.

This is a The Asylum flick, a company known for its low budget knock-offs of major productions. I've only seen a couple of their films and actually liked 2009's ""The Land that Time Forgot"" by C. Thomas Howell. That plus the fact that I'm a fan of Jules Verne, Captain Nemo and Mysterious Island gave me hope.

The movie attempts a James Bond/Jules Verne hybrid in that it has the same plot as 1977's ""The Spy Who Loved Me."" Captain Nemo, played by Sean Lawlor, even looks like Charles Gray's Blofeld from 1971's ""Diamonds Are Forever."" Unfortunately, it fails on many levels. Lamas and Lawlor are effectively charismatic in their roles, but most of the rest of the cast are okay at best and sometimes downright bad. The CGI is cartoony, but serviceable for a low budget flick. I can forgive practically any production weakness if the story is captivating, but this is where the movie fails most. The set-up of the first half hour is relatively dull, but things perk up when Nemo appears. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't capitalize on this and it spirals into a boring darkened vessel adventure, like a bad episode of Deep Space Nine. On the female front Kim Little is fetching, but they don't do enough with her. By the last 12 minutes I couldn't wait for it to be over.

The movie runs 86 minutes.

GRADE: D+

====================

""Mega Piranha""

Released in 2010, ""Mega Piranha"" chronicles events when a mutant strain of increasingly-growing piranha escape from the Amazon Basis to threaten Florida. Tiffany stars as a researcher in the jungle while Paul Logan plays a kick-axx government agent and Barry Williams his superior back in the US. David Labiosa is on hand as a Hispanic militant in the jungle.

While a little overweight, Tiffany makes for a likable protagonist and Logan is spot-on as a Rambo-ish action figure. The jungle and beach locations are good and there's quite a bit of action. Unfortunately, the story isn't very compelling, although it develops some drive by the last act. But it's all for naught as the cartoony CGI of the huge piranha and what they're able to do makes you bust out laughing rather than scare you (or impress you or whatever). As the story moves along, the colossal fish are shown jumping into water that's obviously too shallow for them to occupy. It just boggles my mind that The Asylum would blow all this money on cast and locations and then plague the flick with such lousy F/X. One worthy brief scene occurs during the beginning, however, when Tiffany's character amusingly pays tribute to the great ""Apocalypse Now,"" which will be missed by most viewers because it's not one of the more popular lines from that movie. Speaking of Tiffany, she sings the end-credits' song ""Frozen Skies"" and it's pretty good.

Bottom Line: Even viewed as a parody, ""Mega Piranha"" is bad, Mega Bad.

The film runs 92 minutes and was shot in Belize, Los Angeles and Long Beach.

GRADE: D (2.5/10 Stars)

====================

""Attack of the Giant Leeches""

Released in 1959, ""Attack of the Giant Leeches"" takes place in a small swamp community in Florida where giant leeches threaten the populace. Ken Clark stars as the ranger who investigates the strange happenings.

I didn't have much hope for this flick considering it's dubious name, its short length (62 minutes) and the fact that it's B&W, but the characters are decent and the story engrossing enough. The late 50's ambiance is worth the price of admission and the swamp atmospherics effective. Clark makes for a great masculine protagonist with his athletic build and meek disposition (sorta like a smaller Clint Walker). Jan Shepard plays his wife, the good girl, contrasted by Yvette Vickers' bad girl. Vickers was the July '59 Playmate of the Month and the movie shows off her body a little bit. While the leech monsters are rather lame, the sequences in the underwater cave where the leeches suck the blood of their captives are pretty nightmarish with the accompanying spooky music.

Despite these positives, critics lambaste the movie on the grounds that the leeches are laughable, essentially people covered in trash bags with suckers here & there where you can clearly see the actors' arms moving inside the bags. If you can overlook this shortcoming, this is worthwhile 50's swamp horror.

The film was shot in Los Angeles.

GRADE: B

====================

""Piranha""

Released in 1972, ""Piranha"" chronicles events when a brother & sister photography team (Tom Simcox & Ahna Capri) enlist a guide (Peter Brown) for a tour in the jungle wilderness where they meet a friendly-but-mysterious hunter named Caribe (William Smith), who lives in the jungle. Caribe shows his true colors when he acts upon his Native namesake.

People badmouth this movie because they fell prey to a bait-and-switch by DVD-makers or whomever. This is NOT the Roger Corman nature-runs-amok flick of the same name from 1978. Neither is it a creature feature at all. It's a realistic Venezuelan jungle adventure/thriller with hints of horror highlighted by genuine early 70's atmosphere. Despite being an adventure/thriller, the title ""Piranha"" does not misrepresent the movie, which is explained in the second half and ties into the plot (I'm not going to give it away). Another thing to keep in mind is that the movie was released in '72, three years before ""Jaws"" made nature-runs-amok flicks popular. So the filmmakers didn't title it ""Piranha"" with the intention of misleading fans of creatures-on-the-loose flicks.

In any case, the cast is great, although they coulda done better with someone other than Capri in the female role, even though she plays the part well despite my slight misgivings. Simcox is a likable masculine protagonist and it's too bad he didn't become a star, although he had constant TV work. Brown is good too, but it's Smith who towers here, literally at 6'2"", but in overweening taciturn charisma as well. Caribe seems like a cool guy to party with in the jungle and the quartet have some good times together, including a long (8.5 minute) motorcycle race, but the story takes a dark turn in the final act. I've seen a handful of Smith films & TV episodes over the years and this is by far his best role.

Some complain about the ""stock footage"" of numerous animals, but it adds to the jungle atmospherics. Others complain about the thinness of the plot and the seeming padding with the animal, Native and diamond-panning footage, etc. This has caused some to criticize the movie as a ""Venezuelan travelogue,"" but I enjoyed this aspect. Viewing the film IS like vacationing in Venezuela and I found it interesting and informative, but it's just a stage for the interesting low-key drama of the quartet. And, say what you will about the thin story, it gels together into a meaningful whole with interesting things to glean.

If you're in the mood for a 60s-70's psychological adventure/thriller I recommend ""Piranha."" However, if you need an explosion every second and unrealistic action sequences to maintain your attention look elsewhere.

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot entirely in Venezuela.

GRADE: B+

====================

LAST WORD: So, for me, three of the six movies make this pack worthwhile: ""Piranha,"" ""Beneath Loch Ness"" and ""Attack of the Giant Leeches"" (in that order). The other three are bad, but with some worthwhile elements, if you're in the mood for a low-budget cartoony creature feature.",1459209600,,11711,4.965235173824131
