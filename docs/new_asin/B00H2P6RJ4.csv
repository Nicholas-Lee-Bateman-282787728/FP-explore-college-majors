8629281,5,B00H2P6RJ4,"This is an absolute incredible training video for the beginning pistol shooter. I'm a retired police officer and now a firearms instructor. I've been looking for a video exactly like this to incorporate in my training classes. This will be an excellent addition to my classes for the new shooters to take home for training reinforcement. This hits the essential elements that are absolutely necessary for a new pistol shooter to be successful.

During most training classes, new pistol shooters have a lot thrown at them and it's easy to miss details. If they can grasp the basics in class and let this DVD reinforce the details, I believe new shooters will have a solid foundation to become great shots.

I contacted Frontier DVD's to determine if there are follow up videos for intermediate pistol shooters as well as rifle shooters. There will likely be subsequent videos covering these topics, but they aren't available yet. I hope that Andy Stebbing and Frontier DVD's will pursue additional segments down the road. I'll definitely support them in those efforts.",1437177600,,1067,5.022598870056497

8629283,5,B00H2P6RJ4,"Great video.  Thought I knew most everything about using my HK but after watching this video I realized there is always more to learn.  Utilizing just a few of the instructional techniques has improved my accuracy and comfort level immensely.  Unless you have been trained by a professional, this video is a must buy.",1386633600,,317,4.833333333333333
8629284,5,B00H2P6RJ4,Very well done. I purchased a Glock model 22 and had no previous experience with it. I followed the instructors methods very closely. I can now put all of my shots in the inner circle at 21 feet. My confidence has grown tremendously with this video. I practice the methods taught and am getting better every weekend I go and shoot. Thank You!,1386028800,,342,4.444444444444445
8629285,5,B00H2P6RJ4,"I purchased this DVD and can't say enough good about it!  Mr. Stebbing shows very clearly how to shoot a pistol in a way that is easy to understand. Since he was a Sergeant with over 25 years of experience I trust his guidance and methods. I've been practicing his techniques and have become very comfortable with being able to protect myself if I ever need to. I feel that I now have the skill to shoot a pistol that I would never have achieved if I had not purchased this DVD. I highly recommend this pistol training DVD, the price is right and the instructions are clear and precise. There is nothing else out there like it, I know I've looked for years. For someone who does not have time to go to the shooting range and practice every week, this DVD is invaluable. This instructional DVD is useful for those who have never shot a pistol and great for those who just want to hone their shooting skills. You put it in your DVD player and learn pistol shooting skills right in the comfort of your own home. Genius!",1386028800,,1016,4.319371727748691
