3800030,5,B001UHNXQA,The contiunation of the previous 15 Sharpe's DVD and still done quite well.  I highly recommend this DVd for anyone who is a Sharpe and,1273104000,,135,4.4
3800031,5,B001UHNXQA,"I AM A RICHARD SHARPE FAN, THIS MOVIE IS DONE IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE PERVOIUS 14 SHARPE'S BBC SERIES.  I HAVE ALSO READ THE ASSOCIATED BERNARD CORNWELL BOOKS WRITTEN BEFORE THE MOVIES WERE EVER PRODUCED. THESE ADVENTURES DEAL WITH THE WARS BETWEEN ENGLAND AND FRANCE IN THE 1800'S.  IF YOU ENJOY A 1800'S ADVENTURE THIS IS A MOVIE THAT YOU MUST SEE.",1272931200,,352,4.484375
3800032,5,B001UHNXQA,"This video, like all of the Sharpe's episodes is excellent in both acting and story, the only thing missing is the full cast of characters from the first 14 episodes, and it therefore lacks the interaction between the men that made the initial offerings so engaging.",1272499200,,266,4.804347826086956
3800033,5,B001UHNXQA,"A worthy addition to the series, & agreeable end to the films.

All things are subjective, and some Sharpe's pictures are better than others (but taken as a whole or individually they're better than 98% of the other stuff out there) but this was a romp as good as any other Sharpe's picture.  As to the reviewer who opined that Bean is ""...wee bit over the proverbial hill..."" & another who observed ""...Bean...&...O'Malley...looking far older and more haggard than in the previous installment..."" I say of course they are!  The actors, like the characters & the rest of us, are getting on in years!  If the old dash is dulled with a weary patina, it occurrs to me that old soldiers know too well the futility of war & are wearied by the waste.  ""Wars are for kings and bureaucrats."" says Sharpe, & too right.  Fights & battles are for Sharpe & his ilk; they make a man old beyond his years & Bean & O'Malley play their parts very well.  Thank you all, & thank you two most especially.",1272412800,,985,4.438888888888889
3800034,3,B001UHNXQA,"If you have followed Richard Sharpe's adventures on television over the past 17 years (yes, ""Sharpe's Rifles"" debuted in 1993!), the latest installment, ""Sharpe's Peril"" (filmed in 2008, but released in the US, in 2010), may seem a bit of a letdown, with Sean Bean and Daragh O'Malley, still in India after 2006's ""Sharpe's Challenge"", looking far older and more haggard than in the previous installment, and the 'original' story, a cut-and-paste of elements done better in several earlier Bernard Cornwell adaptations. Both Bean and O'Malley, in the 'Making of' special feature, imply that this will be the final adventure (""Sharpe's ready to retire from soldiering""), although the film has less of a sense of closure than 1997's ""Sharpe's Waterloo"".

But I was not completely disappointed by the film; it has some entertaining elements, and after discovering the hardships of the production (with over 100-degree heat every day, nearly inaccessible locations, and a variety of language problems involving a multi-national production team), the fact the film 'works' at all says a lot about the professionalism of a veteran cast and crew. I don't bemoan Bean's careworn features, now; nearly 50 when he made ""Peril"", in a hostile environment, he shows a higher energy level than many of the cast! I believe there is still a great final ""Sharpe"" story to be made, that will be more satisfying...

The wonderful team that gave us so much pleasure and entertainment with ""Sharpe"", should be given a better send-off, in a more hospitable environment!",1271980800,6,1547,5.159362549800797
3800035,3,B001UHNXQA,"I have really enjoyed the Sharpes series both DVD and the books, in fact I would classify myself as a Sharpe's junkie.  (I've read 4 or 5 of the books and they really add an extra dimension to the DVD episodes.)  I saw that this was released and jumped at the chance to see an episode I didn't know by heart. What a let down. Yes the budget is higher and India somewhat interesting backdrop, but Sean looks like he's spent all of Boromir's pay on scotch over the past 6 years. At first I thought his haggard appearance was a cinematic ploy and that they would clean him up, but no that's the actor. Sargent Harper wasn't much better. And the bit with Harper doubled over with pain down in ""Manland"" whiles he's trying to wiz, and then nothing more ever comes of it is wierd. In fact the whole episode is really the worst of all of them. Everything that made the original series so bloody good- outrageous villans (who could not hate Hakeswell, or Simmerson), the intolerant snobbery of the English officers, the barely plausible but enjoyable romantic interests in every episode, and overall the triumph of true honor, skill and bravery over all odds,  none of it is in this episode. I wish I had rented it and spent the money on one of the older series sets- like ""Sharpe's Sword""  Harper: ""Am I gonna die Father?""  We're all gonna die ...someday Patrick"" - If you know the scene - it was bloody fabulous.
Even at its worst Sharpes Peril is better for my tastes than most other productions. For the uninitiated- go watch the first 5 episodes. Three stars",1271289600,,1555,4.461267605633803
3800036,3,B001UHNXQA,"After viewing an excellent SHARPE'S CHALLENGE and reading that PERIL was forthcoming, I was chomping at the bit for the continuence of Sharpe in India aired on PBS's Masterpiece Classic April 4, 2010.  What a let down! If an increased budget was available for the production, it certainly was not directed to the screenplay or  potentially to making this final Sharpe contribution the best of the best in the Sharpe series. For starters, Sean Bean is no longer ""dashing,"" and Director Tom Clegg has Sharpe barely able to stand up with erstwhile energy in the battle scenes; sadly, Sean is a wee bit over the proverbial hill now.  Conversly, Sharpe's sidekick, Patrick Harper (played by Irishman Daragh O'Malley) looks fit as a fiddle and none the worse for wear through 15 Sharpe episodes. The most disappointing element of PERIL is the battle scenes, all of which give the impression of Keystone Cop mentality; they are poorly staged, that is unbelievably staged to the point of being unrealistic and plain foolish. Sharpe in battle suffers multiple shoulder wounds, saber gashes, etc., but always appears to recover and fight on as if the wounds were ""tis a scratch"" (like in Monty Python's HOLY GRAIL). And, of course, the now old, worn out story line of Sharpe et al. being charged with overseeing the traveling, young female and the travails that ensue do not make for fresh treatment. Do note that PERIL is a 2 disc set, which is new to the DVD series. Disc 1 represents a 20mins. longer version than the PBS airing of 1hr. 50mins. which is included on disc 2 along with the ""Making Of .."" and a photo gallery. For my money, all the Sharpes that came before PERIL, and certainly CHALLENGE is included here, are of better quality. In the end, as usual, Richard and Patrick ride off together after victory to the tune of ""Over the Hills and Far Away"" taking added comfort in their successes. Amen!",1270857600,2,1901,4.737160120845921
3800037,4,B001UHNXQA,"I am great fan of the books but all the previous movies were so low budget as to well, really not hold my interest. You can't recreate any sort of French / English war with the same 30 actors running around trying to be an entire army. Plus the books were just butchered for the films.

This film, if I am not mistaken, is actually an all new adventure penned specifically for this film. It concerns Sharpe and Harper's adventures later in life after they have retired - but still fighting trim! - and returned to India (which never happened in the books but no matter). Strong acting for the most part - Bean remains the perfect Richard Sharpe and some very nice surprises and twists and turns. Really keep me engaged to the end.

Filmed in India I think and so the scenery is lush and fantastic.",1270684800,,797,4.378378378378378
3800038,4,B001UHNXQA,"Richard Sharpe and the redoubtable Patrick Harper are finally on their way home from India.  Both look exhausted but are attending a ball given by the Governor of India who asks just one last favor.  Would Sharpe be so kind as to deliver a valuable piece of property to one of the hill outposts?  He can do this, the Governor goes on to say, without any, repeat any, peril.  That should have been a flashing red light of a clue, but of course, Sharpe says I'd be delighted or something like that, and so the adventure begins.

The 'property' turns out to be the spoiled young fiancee of a French officer, who won her in a game of cards.  She's already gotten off on the wrong foot with Sharpe, so to speak, after she smacked him a good one because he wouldn't dance with her. Sharpe and Harper do some grumbling, but dutifully set out with Marie and soon come across evidence of bandits.  Not just any bandits, though.  OMG, THESE bandits kill women and children and old people.  Shame on them, especially since everyone has so repeatedly demonstrated a high regard for the sanctity of human life in the previous episodes of Sharpe and all.  Shame, I say.

When our merry trio runs into a group of travellers headed to the same destination, they immediately hook up.  After all, there is safety in numbers and Sharpe and Harper see a glimmer of hope as they think they'll dump Marie on the travellers.  She won't have any of THAT, no sirree, so Sharpe and Harper must tag along to the outpost. Finding out about the other travellers and their issues, of which there are many, occupies everybody's time and energy until they reach the outpost.  OH NOES!!!!  Devastation everywhere!! There is much skullduggery and buckling of swashes; lots and lots and lots of blood, though the cavalry always seems to arrive in the nick of time.

There are plenty of Sharpe stereotypes in this entry:  the very young officer who has something to prove, the old officer ditto, feisty heroine, several doomed heroes as well as some swell new villains.  There's a portly English soldier deliciously named Wormwood who's up to no good, and a suave Russian officer named Dragonoff or something like that who's moonlighting as an opium dealer. In addition, Sharpe is revisited by his past.  A couple of characters have surprising last names and remember General Simmerson?  He has a great role.

Without spoilers, this Sharpe ends very satisfactorily, even if some of the events are major eye-rollers.  For example, the French fiancee is kidnapped by her betrothed, who is on the lam from both the East India Company and the Army.  They stop so she can TAKE A BATH????  'Cause we all know how important personal hygiene was in 1818.

If you haven't seen any of the Sharpes, DON'T START WITH THIS ONE!  For non fans this would be about a two and a half star movie.  I'm rating it four because I am a fan and am willing to overlook a lot for the pleasure of spending two hours in Sharpe's world.  Really, in spite of the above snarkiness, this film wasn't at all a bad entry in the series.",1270339200,53,3065,4.574311926605505
3800039,3,B001UHNXQA,"Any fan of the series will enjoy this 16th outing for Sharpe and Harper.  On par with 2006's ""Sharpe's Challenge"". The larger budget really shows in the scale of the scenes over the tv series.
Not sure why anyone would buy it from Amazon US though.  They want $29.99+$2.98 shipping for a Pal format Region 2 DVD. That is twice the price from Amazon UK - $12.94+$5.00 after converting from pounds sterling.  It is the same DVD!!! I love British Drama and Mystery and have ordered lots from Amazon UK - never took more than 7 days to arrive.  Why would anyone pay over $15.00 more just to have it arrive 1-2 days sooner.  Amazon still gets your money - just not twice as much!",1244073600,41,674,4.36

3800057,4,B001UHNXQA,"I missed the Sharpe TV series first time around, but have been enjoying episodes on DVDs and public media. They are somewhat dated in production value compared to the quick-cut, super action thrillers being produced today, but I really enjoy Sean Bean's portrayal of the main character. As he's commented, he does anger very well. I understand the author of the Sharpe books was thrilled with Bean's performance and incorporated some of the series characters into his later books.",1463529600,,480,5.0886075949367084
3800058,5,B001UHNXQA,Very true to the feel of the original Sharp series in its story and presentation.  The authentic Indian location made this picture very good as well as the logical progression of how Sharp would have felt at the end of his military career.,1462060800,,239,4.558139534883721

3800093,3,B001UHNXQA,"I really hated to give this film three-stars, because I really love the Sharpe series.  And let me be clear, the three star rating does not reflect my opinion of the performances nor very high production values, but of the story itself.

This Sharpe installment gets three stars because we see a redemption of one character who was killed many films back, albeit in the form of his offspring, and the redemption of another character who, in my not so humble opinion, could not be redeemed, and probably should have never been considered to be redeemable by the powers that be.  It is in point and fact, very artificial.

The rest of the plot is okay, and of course we have very sumptuous Indian scenery and exceptionally high production values in costumes, props and everything else.

I always love seeing Bean win the woman, and Daragh play his boon companion Sergeant Harper in another action pact installment in a very exotic location.

But did they have to do what they did to Simmerson?  That just doesn't sit well with me.

Either way, pick up a copy and enjoy it for what it is.",1428710400,,1085,4.585492227979275

I thought Disk 2 was a quality control error, labelled as 2  because when I watched it, it was a repeat of disk 1. I reported it to Amazon and Amazon immediately sent me a replacement. This time when I watched Disk 2 and found a repeat of Disk 1, I did fast forwarding and I found a repeat of perhaps 15 or more minutes of Disk 1. This showed I had been incorrect, it had not been a quality control error, BBC had played games with the customers. ABOUT THE STORY: There are  many sudden skips, like skipping pages in a novel and threfore, unexplained situations.  Sharpe twice gets a musket ball shoulder wound, and in the same shoulder. After the first, he shows no limitation on his strength or endurance. After the second, he has a strenuous saber sword fight that includes too much page skipping.

I won't say who the son's father was and spoil it for those who haven't seen this movie yet...but I thought it was a great idea from the movie's writers.

Don't waste your time or money getting them one at a time. Buy the series set. You will not be disappointed. The actors do a fine job and the shows might have had a small budget, but the talent is priceless. This has a bigger budget, bueatiful sets and costumes.

Seeing it in Blu ray was even better.",1357344000,,131,4.076923076923077
3800144,5,B001UHNXQA,"Okay, so Colonel Sharpe and Master Sergeant Harper have aged a bit (sigh, haven't I too). But the excitement, drama, surprise events abound in this wonderful finishing episode to the A&E series. I only wish the author(s) would have given Sharpe the right to get his revenge on so-called Lady Jane - she stole all of Sharpe's money after all. But I am happy to have bought this episode, as well as Sharpe's Challenge. Sitll sorry it is all over.",1355529600,,444,4.5625

3800146,5,B001UHNXQA,"Sharpe's Peril completes my set of Sharpe DVD's. I saw the whole original series on TV when it first came out. It is a very good period piece, well acted, good storyline, good scenery. Watching it on DVD is much better than the original TV screening. The picture quality and sound are much better. Sean Bean and Daragh O'Malley are excellent actors and really bring the action to life.",1350777600,,385,4.594202898550725

3800148,5,B001UHNXQA,Sharpe is the best!  If you like the rest of the series or just Sean Bean in general then you will enjoy this movie.,1303862400,,116,3.8333333333333335
3800149,4,B001UHNXQA,"Ok, this story isn't the best in the series. but after all the Napoleonic wars are done with by the time of this story,  and this is the second India story. It has alot of classic soldier in India story fixtures etc with bad soldiers, boy soldiers , a beautiful princess and the brave but sometimes clueless and petulant heroine. It's probably the weakest of the series of films but it's still got good acting from all involved and of course Sean Bean who is both a weary soldier and yet still able to lead and overcome. He and the actor who plays his sergeant companion bring this a better rating because they are these characters in some degree by now.  The story isn't too bad imo and the budget isn't a huge one but it's decent enough and reminds me of a classic b movie. I would say the earlier sharpes stand above this but this blu ray is  worth owning for all SHarpe fans as well as for adventure fans.",1301184000,,909,4.273255813953488
3800160,5,B001UHNXQA,"We have the entire ""Sharpe's"" series and this was a wonderful addition to the collection!
Sean Bean truly is ""Sharpe""!  The story line and characters are very accurate for the time period portrayed in this series!
Anyone interested in the Napoleonic Wars and that time period will enjoy this movie.  However, I would suggest watching the series from start to finish since, this is the last episode (to date) in the series.",1294617600,,422,4.847222222222222
3800161,5,B001UHNXQA,"I enjoyed this movie very much. It's great to see Sharpe and Harper at it again. The plot was exciting and the characters were compelling. The only downside was the fact that it left you hanging at the end. There's a promo for the next one, yet there's no sign of a sequal.",1280275200,,273,4.169811320754717

3800163,4,B001UHNXQA,Good movie - Richard Sharpe at his best!  Better than the last one (2006 - Sharpe's Challenge),1277596800,,94,4.529411764705882

3800165,4,B001UHNXQA,"Not part of the original series, but an offering later after Sharpe returns to India.  Beautifully scripted and performed, it is a Richard Sharpe adventure.  If you look at the books, though, it covers territory that includes many of the older plots.  Worth it?  Yes - but only if you have seen the entire series.  It follows Sharpe's Challenge.  Watch all 14 and Challenge to really understand the dynamics here.",1276300800,,413,4.828571428571428
3800166,1,B001UHNXQA,"I thought with the BBC connection I would get something well done - what a disappointment on so many levels.
(1.) Same old stereotype of gallant British military morality in India fighting rebellion/dishonesty despite a couple of not-so-good British soldiers but with the help of a couple of good Indian natives.
(2.) Nothing-new script where British must safely transport a stereotypic India princess and a spoiled blonde European both of whom coincidentally have an appearance that confirms that sex sells movies.  The only parts you don't fast forward through.
(3.) Dialogue and acting are predictable simplistic - prisoner soldier, young soldier, Hindi soldier, black soldier, crooked soldier, gallant soldier, wounded soldier, incompetent officer soldier - vomiting is permitted.
(4.) Location consists of one brief India like fortress; one brief could be anywhere village and the rest is lots and lots of walking/riding on a dusty road that could be in South Dakota for all we know because there was nothing to indicate otherwise.
(5.) Cheap production as indicated by just a few dozen cast members; just a few horses; just a couple of rifle volleys; an improbable large sculpted cast metal cannon in a village?; and cheap plastic-looking swords used in a couple of fight scenes that looked like they were performed by a middle school fencing class for beginners!
(6.) Predictable ending - more ad nauseam where all the bad people die, a few good people die but who cares and everyone else that's suppose to live, well, they do. End of story.
(7.) I predict that all the five star ratings come from people who have an association with the film or are OCD for Sharpe's movies.",1275868800,6,1681,5.025089605734767

3800169,4,B001UHNXQA,"For fans of historical military drama serials, Bernard Cornwell's enduring character, Richard Sharpe, is at or near the top of the list. The original series chronicled the rise through the ranks of an enlisted man who, after saving Lord Wellington, was promoted to officer (unheard of in the British army.) He served Wellington admirably during the peninsular wars in Portugal and Spain, and culminating in the famous Battle of Waterloo. The BBC television series, starring the durable Sean Bean, does an admirable and faithful job of adapting the various Cornwell novels, particularly considering some of the budget limitations inherent in television series. As book adaptions, they are not unlike the excellent Granada Television production of the Sherlock Holmes stories starring the late jeremy Brett.

In the latest two additions to the chronicles (including the preceding Sharpe's Challenge,) Sharpe, accompanied by his faithful partner sergeant Harper (played solisly by Daragh O'Malley) has resurfaced in India. What sets both episodes apart from the original series, is that they were shot in 16X9 format with HD cameras. Although the DVD for both Sharpe's Challenge and Sharpe's Peril are, of course, presented in standard definition, the widescreen format increases the technical quality immensely, particular on the modern digital widescreen televisions.

The episode for Sharpe's Peril offers nothing new, preferring to stick with the reliable Sharpe ""format."" While hardly a film masterpiece, it is a definite step up from most seies television, offering good, solid, entertainment for fans of military history and/or Sean Bean.",1273276800,12,1642,5.590361445783133

8343796,5,B001UHNXQA,I bought this to complete the set. After reading all the books I became a Richard Sharpe follower.... the tv series were all done on a pretty small budget but still pretty impressive.... Sharpe's team exposed me to John Hams who sang throughout and that caused me to chase his music down as well ....Cornwall has created a truly great character caught up in history..... I really enjoyed this film as well as the others..... the books are better but then they generally are,1485561600,,473,4.642857142857143
