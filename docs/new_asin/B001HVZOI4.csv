8309783,5,B001HVZOI4,"This is a really superb, intelligent, well-made documentary about the Bay Area peace coalition, Direct Action to Stop The War (DASW), that helped mobilize the huge anti-war demonstration in San Francisco at the onset of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Not only does it celebrate what DASW did right like building an alliance with longshore workers and successfully shutting down buisness as usual in San Francisco on the first day of the war, it more importantly reflects on what it did wrong like not dealing effectively with internal problems of racism, classism, and patriarchy and allowing an informal, unaccountable leadership to evolve. For peace and justice activists interested in building a diverse, sustainable movement for global liberation, this is a must-see documentary. I especially recommend it for local anti-war groups to use as a consciousness-raising tool around issues of long-term strategy and political analysis.",1234915200,,930,5.465277777777778
