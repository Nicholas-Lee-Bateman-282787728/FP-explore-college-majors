6735388,5,B00OBWPAT4,"Taras passion for sharing the importance and benefits of practicing yoga during pregnancy really comes through in her Pregnancy Yoga DVD. Her sequences are easy to follow and her exercises are an essential part of my week. There is a hypnobirthing section with a leading hypnobirthing expert called Katharine Graves. It is split into different menu options so that if you have a bad back or sore hips, you can choose specific sections to do. The DVD has different timed options too making it easy to fit your yoga sessions into your busy life.",1449100800,4,543,4.787234042553192
6735389,5,B00OBWPAT4,"Tara is one of the best pregnancy yoga teachers around. I just love her positive and supportive spirit. She helped guide me through both of my pregnancies in a loving, supportive way. This video is a must do for moms to be. I recommend her videos to all of my expectant students pre and post pregnancy. Amazing healing energy!!!

6735390,5,B00OBWPAT4,I looked at a ton of prenatal yoga video reviews... I selected this one and I am so glad I did. It gives me a little bit of everything.,1440806400,5,135,3.689655172413793
6735391,5,B00OBWPAT4,"I Loved this DVD.  Tara Lee has a unique background and expertise - she is passionate and dedicated to the evolution of the body, mind and spirit before, during and after pregnancy.  It was an essential part of my pregnancy and I have given it to girlfriends as early baby shower gifts.",1432080000,,286,4.480769230769231
6735392,5,B00OBWPAT4,"I love this DVD! I was really into the idea of hypno-birthing and the section of the dvd that covers it was so useful helping me have my 3rd birth naturally. This time round I wanted to go as natural as possible as I hadn't managed with the other 2. I only followed the hypno birthing section for about 3 or 4 weeks before the birth and it made SUCH a difference this time round with my delivery. I was so much more relaxed and in control.

Number 3 is now 6 weeks old and I'm doing the post-natal section a few times a week and I'm almost back in the skinny denims - this is way quicker than with my previous get back in shape missions! I'm passing this on to my sister who is due in 2 months.",1431820800,10,694,3.9571428571428573
6735393,4,B00OBWPAT4,This yoga video is perfect to release sore muscles and stiffness or for relaxation. I use the 20 minute move segment once a week on Monday morning to stretch my muscles and joints. Other mornings I do Hilaria Baldwin's DVD or my pre-pregnancy workouts with some modifications that I learned from doing pregnancy workout DVDs. This DVD is a little pricey and definitely not worth the purchase if you are looking for a yoga workout that's going to challenge your body. I was a little disappointed with it when I was 14 weeks but now I'm 26 weeks and it has definitely has been useful for relaxation and lengthening. This yoga DVD is more holistic and focuses on preparing your body for pregnancy.,1458691200,2,694,4.650406504065041
6735394,4,B00OBWPAT4,"I've been doing yoga (just on my own, a combo of stuff I learned way back, stuff I've learned from various videos, etc) for years now, just to stay flexible, and when I got pregnant my sister recommended I get a DVD of prenatal yoga because she really enjoyed the class she took when she was pregnant. This one sounded pretty good so I nabbed it, and I'm glad I did. So far I haven't explored more than maybe half of the segments; I'm not as into it for the ""deep connection with your baby/the earth/etc"" spiritual part; I mostly want it to deal with aches and pains after work, to relax and de-stress, to keep acclimated with my body and how it moves and how I balance as it changes during my pregnancy.

I'm only in my second trimester so we'll see how it goes by the third (which is when I'll start exploring the breathing/preparation/hypnobirthing sections), but so far this DVD has met my needs. I mostly stick to the Move section and go through Neck and Shoulders, Back, and Hips every day after work. It helps a lot as I work on my feet 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, and all those areas get sore by the end of the day. On the weekends I do the 20 minute move, which is a little more active. The music is relaxing, Tara's voice is very gentle and soothing. I do wish Amy would demonstrate more of the adjustments Tara mentions for stuff like pelvic girdle pain (though thankfully I haven't had any of that yet). She will demonstrate some adjustments but I almost feel like it would be better if Amy showed the most modified moves (like ""do it like this if you're very restricted""). There's one move in the 20 minute move section that they say not to do in a squat if you have a low-lying placenta (as I do), but they don't give you any variation to do instead. Even if they just told me to kneel or something, it would be nice.",1458086400,7,1833,4.222222222222222
6735395,5,B00OBWPAT4,"A great collection of workouts for prenatal and post-natal.  I am in my second trimester and so far I love the workouts, and I also love that Tara Lee's voice is actually calming and she has a peaceful way about her.  I plan to use this DVD throughout my pregnancy and after.",1457568000,4,275,4.269230769230769
6735396,3,B00OBWPAT4,"I bought this due to the 5 star reviews and I'm not all that impressed.  It's definitely made for someone that is a beginner in Yoga. I did not feel like the poses were challenging enough to really do anything.  They do recommend not starting this dvd until you are past 14 weeks, however I feel like it's designed more for someone in their first or third trimester.  I'm in my second trimester and have been actively doing yoga and pilates and was just meh about the whole thing.  I might change my review as I get larger and unable to move (expecting twins) and need to do less, but for right now it's a solid 3 stars.  For the price, I was expecting more.",1457308800,3,658,4.232
6735397,4,B00OBWPAT4,This video is very relaxing but they sit in the Indian style position for long periods of time and my back would ache. It's low key with a lot of stretching. I expected more long hold poses. It's a good tension relief video.,1457136000,,224,4.232558139534884
6735398,5,B00OBWPAT4,Tara's classes in London are incredible and so are her DVDs. I have recommended this DVD to many friends because the poses and stretches helped with my pregnancy and labor. It is so important to keep moving during pregnancy and this DVD makes it enjoyable!,1455926400,,256,4.711111111111111
6735399,5,B00OBWPAT4,I attended Tara's yoga classes in London for all 3 of my pregnancies and I can safely say she is the absolute best pregnancy yoga teacher around. Her DVDs kept me practicing at home and I loved her calm voice and graceful sequencing. I managed 3 natural births and am sure the yoga helped! Every pregnant woman should own these precious DVDS.,1454284800,3,342,4.532258064516129
6735400,5,B00OBWPAT4,"This is hands-down my favorite prenatal yoga DVD.  Tara is an excellent instructor, and I love that she has Amy doing the routines alongside her.  So many modifications are offered! Also, 20 minutes is the perfect length for me as, in addition to being pregnant, I have a nearly one year-old daughter. I can easily fit in some yoga during a nap or before she wakes up in the morning.  The music is soothing and the routines are gentle, but effective.  You do NOT have to be an experienced yogi to do these!  I definitely recommend this DVD and wish I'd had it for my first pregnancy!",1453420800,6,583,4.411214953271028
6735401,5,B00OBWPAT4,"Tara Lee's yoga is one of the most holistic I have found and after doing her practice I have always felt cleansed, rested and energized.  I practiced her yoga throughout my pregnancies and felt so good!  I have recommended her to sisters and friends countless times as it helped me have happy, healthy pregnancies and to give my children the gift of a natural birth.",1452816000,2,366,4.615384615384615
6735402,5,B00OBWPAT4,"I bought it for my daughter for Christmas.  After the usual Thank you when gifts were exchanged, she called me back a week or so later to rave about it.  She said she loved it and especially liked the fact you can do it in ten minute segments",1452729600,,242,4.020833333333333
8683115,5,B00OBWPAT4,This is a wonderful yoga video. I am in my second trimester and wish I had it for my first. It is not very challenging which is nice because my energy level has been fluctuating so I go to this video when I don't feel like pushing my self too hard. I love it!,1528243200,,259,3.814814814814815
8683116,5,B00OBWPAT4,"This DVD is very calming. The instructor moves through the movements at a good pace, not to fast, not too slow. I have experienced a lot of sad/crying emotions with this pregnancy (now 2nd tri. wk. 22). This DVD brought our happy tears during the connection moments given by the instructor. I am grateful to have some more positive experiences with my son while he is with me in utero. Thank you Tara and Amy~",1516665600,,409,4.466666666666667
8683117,5,B00OBWPAT4,"Very easy to follow instructions, even for a beginner like myself. Love the calming tone in her voice. It is great to have one part that gets you moving and another that helps you achieve ultimate relaxation.",1489449600,2,208,4.648648648648648
8683118,4,B00OBWPAT4,"Some of the sections I really like, the neck and shoulder segment is my favorite (I get very tight there), other sections not so much. I have another prenatal yoga video that I tried that I felt tighter and worse after, this one helped loosen things up.",1474934400,,253,4.404255319148936
8683119,4,B00OBWPAT4,"At first I thought this DVD was not going to work for my needs. If you are active in yoga, then this DVD may not work for the first and second trimester.  I found the flow too slow for those months, but by the third it was perfect.",1472601600,,231,3.8125
8683120,4,B00OBWPAT4,"I started this video in my second trimester.  I like that you get to pick the workout you feel like doing at the time.  If I just want to relax, I do the relaxation portion.  If I am up for a little more, I do some of the other workouts before doing the relaxation portion.  I am now in my third trimester and am still enjoying the video.",1470873600,3,338,3.926470588235294

8683123,5,B00OBWPAT4,I loved the DVDs. Had ordered for prenatal and postnatal and both are just amazing. So clear in instructions and everything so well explained. I would totally recommend it to anyone and everyone looking for a prenatal yoga DVD.,1462147200,,227,4.846153846153846
8683124,4,B00OBWPAT4,"There are many great workouts to choose from-varying lengths, as well.  It was a little difficult for me to do a few of the moves, but I was not into yoga before pregnancy.  A couple of the moves did relieve my back soreness.",1458777600,3,225,4.209302325581396
