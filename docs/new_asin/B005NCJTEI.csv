8480324,5,B005NCJTEI,"Dick Hardy has again hit the nail on the head. The elements mentioned in the video from the ""Make it Happen Series"" are right on. The best part is the explanation of how some pastors make a mistake in the hiring of youth and children's pastors and the order they should be hired. This is a great resource for those pastors desiring their church to grow and wanting that extra push to help them make it happen!",1322697600,,409,4.324675324675325
8480325,5,B005NCJTEI,"This video is a must see for any pastor wanting to take their church to the next level.  Too often pastors focus on the wrong things when seeking to grow their church and with this video Dick points out the 3 most important foundational elements many churches overlook.  None of the elements are rocket science, but sadly they are lacking in many churches today.  Watch this back to the basics video and watch your church begin to grow once you put these 3 elements into place.  I also agree with a previous reviewer that the third element is probably the most important element, but sadly the most often overlooked.",1322611200,,616,4.623853211009174
8480326,5,B005NCJTEI,"ELEMENTS: 3 Foundational Elements Necessary for a Church to Grow provides pastors with the fundamentals which allow a church to be built successfully, enabling them to stand the test of time.  One of the points that stands out to me most is ""discipleship begins with good preaching"".  So fundamental, yet so over-looked by many.  Who would go to a restaurant if the food wasn't good?  Then why expect people to come to your church if the preaching is not.  If Jesus was not prayed-up, prepared, charismatic, or compassionate, multitudes would not have followed him.  We should take a cue from Him and work on our preaching in order to help draw the masses.

Without a foundation, a building will not stand.  Listen to this DVD and complete the guide so you can truly see what foundational elements need repairing or building in your respective ministry.",1322524800,,853,4.834482758620689

8480329,5,B005NCJTEI,"Having ministries available to our churches isn't enough?  Rather, we must begin evaluating if these are good ministries.  Then, ""we must determine how good each is, and then determine to make them better.""  In this ten-minute video, Dick Hardy discusses the three foundational elements for church growth.  While maintaining that these elements are necessary for growth to occur, they themselves do not guarantee growth.

This video accentuates becoming better, to never ""arrive.""  Through this video teaching and the outline/discussion provided in the workbook, this is another valuable tool in our growth as church leaders.  It serves as a valuable reminder of potential blind spots that may be stagnating growth.  Have you settled?  Have you ""arrived?""  Pick up this video and learn what it means to become better.",1321228800,,817,5.362204724409449
