8488185,5,B005WXU44C,"The movie ""Courageous"" is more relevant now than it ever was.  Stephen Kendrick is a man of great vision for taking on the task of producing and directing this movie, especially when it seems the normal genre for movies these days deals more with war, mayhem, drugs and sex.  This movie takes us right back to family values where everything really begins for young impressionable lives.  Thank you Mr. Kendrick.

Would like to purchase 5 DVD's of this movie when it is released on DVD.  Kind regards.",1376611200,,500,4.7011494252873565
