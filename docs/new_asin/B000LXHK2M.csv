8165295,5,B000LXHK2M,"I searched for Lamborghini Gllard DVDs and this one came up on the World Wide Web.

Must say not only did I enjoy it my son loved it as well. Great supercars in this edition, but many imports and tuner cars with street time and track time with drifting segments!

I would recommend for any car nut of all ages. Decent editing of GoPRO type video and digital cameras...

8165296,1,B000LXHK2M,Dude this is quite possibly the worst one of the bunch. its just boring doughnuts in expensive cars and boring shots of lambos. theres some drifting but its boring there should be more destroying stuff which is what tek is known for,1205884800,3,232,4.5476190476190474
8165297,1,B000LXHK2M,"...only it's not free and you spend two hours hoping for the payoff at some point. Bad news - there is no payoff. If you want to watch filthy rich people do donuts in their Lamborghinis for two hours, this is the movie for you! If you'd prefer to see something with a story, like a Gumball run or Players Run, do yourself a favor and look into the previous Teckademics videos. ANY of them are better than this. The series has really lost its charm. Don't waste your money.",1182384000,5,472,4.2555555555555555
