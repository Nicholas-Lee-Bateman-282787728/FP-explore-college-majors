8124945,5,B000FO0ANI,My son enjoyed this.,1455494400,,20,4.25
8124946,5,B000FO0ANI,"This is the best sports video I've ever watched.  Recounting some of the most glorious moments in Boston sports history.  Set to great music and the editing is great - especially the short bursts famous (and infamous) from Boston Sports figures.

The makers of this DVD picked wisely - these truly are great moments.  I wish they would make a volume II.

The Dream On highlight montage is probably the high point.  That and Bill Russell overcome with emotion upon winning his last championship.",1413676800,,494,4.821428571428571
8124947,5,B000FO0ANI,Originally from Boston but have not lived there for years.  Watched with my nephew (who still lives in Boston) and it was great to go back to the early years.  Absolutely loved the DVD.,1379462400,,185,4.411764705882353
8124948,5,B000FO0ANI,"This is an awesome movie.  To knock this movie at all because it doesn't include the '08 celtics or '07 red sox is complete stupidity.  This movie was made before then.  Besides, the movie captures the glory days of the celtics back when the NBA was still enjoyable.  I could watch this movie once a year for the rest of my life.",1340928000,,329,4.258064516129032
8124949,3,B000FO0ANI,"Great for what it is, but doesn't take you through the 2007 sox victory, 2008 celts, KG, etc etc...  sure pulls on the heartstrings, though.",1260835200,,140,4.6
8124950,3,B000FO0ANI,"I liked watching it once, but not sure if I'll need to watch it again. It's very nicely done but I don't think it's a serious collection piece. It's brief, emotional and feels great as you watch it for the first time, especially if you love Boston...This dvd is like a tear jerker romantic movie..only this one is for boys..it's a Boston championships sampler plate.",1203120000,,366,4.6461538461538465
8124951,4,B000FO0ANI,"I really thought that Jamie Most did an excellent job putting together the Best of Boston sports highlights. Very well done. Showed a lot of highlights that the casual sports fan doesn't know about, like the 4th quarter of Game 7 NBA Playoffs in 88 between Bird and Dominique Wilkins. Not enough Patriots stuff for me, though the Snow Bowl and Tuck game as well as the Super Bowl in which Viniateri won it at the buzzer were good.

One criticism: Too much Parcells and Pitino.",1163030400,,476,4.534883720930233
8124952,5,B000FO0ANI,"I just received this in the mail a couple of days ago, and I've already watched it twice (extras included) and started annoying my friends that they need to watch it. I grew up in Massachusetts and it blows my mind at how much of the sporting events in this DVD triggers memories -- I almost flipped when I saw a clip of Yaz's last game in 1983....I was there, at the age of 9, with my mother and brother, sitting in the bleachers of Fenway. It's my first distinct memory of a professional baseball game. I also remember watching the ""Snow Bowl"" a couple of years ago -- sitting in my living room in D.C. with a friend from Massachusetts, both of us having a twinge of home sickness.

What I also like about City of Champions is all the historic stuff that I wouldn't have even known -- I was floored when I realized that Phil Rizzuto played for the Bruins at one point (go ahead hard-core hockey fans, you can pick on me). But then again, my parents are originally from Buffalo, so I had all the history about the Sabres available.

The only disappointment in this DVD -- and it's VERY MINOR -- is the very small focus on the boxing folks from the area. Marvelous Marvin, Rocky Marciano, Micky Ward, etc. These guys provided some exciting matches. But, I can't complain too loud since all the interviews, clips and music videos are phenonemal.",1152230400,3,1344,4.415322580645161
8124953,5,B000FO0ANI,"This is far and away the best sports DVD I've ever seen. Not only does it have virtually ever Boston Sports moment you could ever imagine - over 500 of them - but it sets them to music like Aerosmith's ""Dream On"", AC/DC's ""Thunderstruck"", Pearl Jam's ""Man of the Hour"", Train's ""Drops of Jupiter"", and a ton more. I could not stop watching it. It also has some great interviews with the likes of Ray Bourque, Doug Flutie, Theo Epstein, Peter Gammons, Jerry Remy, Steve Nelson and so on...

Besides just great footage, City of Champions also has all kinds of more obscure stuff, such as press conferences, retirement speeches, parades, and even things like Bob Kraft dancing in Governement Center when the Pats won their first Super Bowl and the Rick Patino and Bill Parcells press conferences -  too funny!

I'm telling you, I own all of the sports DVDs that have come out in the past bunch of years, from Faith Rewarded to the aweful DVD the Globe put out and if you're from New England or love Boston sports, this DVD is it.",1149638400,5,1026,4.505376344086022
