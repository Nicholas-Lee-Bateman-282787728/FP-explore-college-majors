5301346,4,B009AMAK54,"After starring in the remarkable ""Million Dollar Baby"" in 2004, then following it up with the gritty ""Gran Torino"" in 2008, Clint Eastwood announced his ""retirement"" from acting, instead focusing on on directing/producing films.  When the script for ""Trouble with the Curve"" came along, though, Mr. Eastwood decided that it was too good of a vehicle to pass up.  Thus, in his return to leading-man status, the 82-year old thespian proves that his filmmaking (or film-choosing) instincts are as solid as ever.

For a basic plot summary, ""Trouble with the Curve"" focuses on Gus (Eastwood), an aged baseball scout who relies on his eyes, senses, and gut feelings to scout the top prospects.  The trouble is, his eyes are failing and his job is on the line.  As such, Gus's friend Pete (John Goodman) is concerned about him and gives a call to Mickey (Amy Adams), Gus's daughter.  Predictably, the father-daughter duo do not share a strong relationship with each, and that is tested on a road trip together to scout the newest ""can't miss"" prospect.  Along the way, rival scout Johnny (Justin Timberlake) teaches both parts of the duo a little something about each other and their lives.

When evaluating ""Trouble with the Curve"", there is one thing that you must do: Absolutely DO NOT try to compare it to ""Million Dollar Baby"" or ""Gran Torino"".  It's not even so much that it doesn't measure up to those movies (although it doesn't), but rather that it takes a bit of a different tone.  It is a bit more light-hearted and not nearly as ""life-or-death serious"" as those other flicks.

When looked at under its own merits, then, ""Curve"" is an excellent film that does everything it sets out to do.  The plot is interesting enough to keep you invested, the emotion runs high throughout, and the acting is superb.  Eastwood is his typical self, while Adams and Timberlake provide the much-needed camaraderie that a movie like this needs from time to time.  The characters aren't quite as fleshed-out as a normal Eastwood movie (in this case, there is more ""telling"" of emotions than ""showing"", generally speaking), but they are still engaging.

Basically, ""Trouble with the Curve"" is a conglomeration of a number of different themes (aging, fatherhood, baseball scouting, etc.) that work not in isolation but blended together.  All those themes have been done better in other movies, but having them all play off each other still manages to produce a cinematic treat.  I hope Eastwood still continues to shine ON the camera as well as BEHIND it, but if this does turn out to be his final acting role, there is no reason to look back with any regret.",1348272000,2,2643,4.824833702882484
5301347,3,B009AMAK54,"Trouble With The Curve is a watchable film about an aging baseball scout facing problems with a changing game, fading eyesight and a difficult relationship with his daughter that he's running out of time to fix. In a lot of ways, it could have been the perfect counter-point to last year's excellent film Moneyball, showing the view of the veteran scouts and their traditional ways of looking for talent in contrast to the analytics-driven approach which now dominates the game. But in the hands of first-time director Robert Lorenz and first-time screen-writer Randy Brown, Trouble With The Curve never ventures beyond formula and manages to run for 111 mostly by-the-numbers minutes without a single moment of unpredictability.

Gus Lobel (Clint Eastwood) is a man caught between the rocks of old age and failing eyesight and the hard place of trying to hang on to his job as a baseball scout as the whole nature of the business is changing around him, going from a hands-on gut feel approach to boiling down potential players into a set of stats on a laptop. His contract with the Atlanta Braves baseball team is coming up for renewal, but his bosses, team owner Vince (Robert Patrick) and manager Pete Klein (John Goodman) aren't sure if Gus is up to the job anymore. Especially with their up-and-coming scout Phil Sanderson (Matthew Lillard, oozing sleaze) telling them that Gus' way of doing things just doesn't cut it anymore.

Ultimately, everything depends on a scouting mission Gus is set to handle: to check out a player named Bo Gentry (Joe Massingill, oozing obnoxiousness), a hard-hitter on a small Georgia college team who's viewed as a potential top pick in the upcoming draft.  Klein, who's a long-time friend of Gus's as well as his boss, gets in touch with Gus's daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams, shining brilliantly) a successful attorney on the brink of being made a partner at the law firm where she works. Klein tells Mickey his concerns and what's at stake for Gus if he blows this mission, asking her to go with Gus and keep an eye on things. Unwilling at first, particularly as her being made a partner depends on a big presentation she's to give for a major client in a matter of days, Mickey reluctantly gives in when she finds out about Gus's eye problems, telling her bosses that she has to take a couple of days off to deal with her father but that she _will_ be there to handle the presentation on time. While Mickey and Gus aren't exactly estranged, there is nonetheless a distance between them that neither seems able to overcome, making their relationship difficult at best and more often one of walking away with hands thrown up in frustration. Their only common ground, rather naturally given the film, is their love of baseball.

While scouting out the intended prospect, Gus and Mickey run into Johnny (Justin Timberlake), a former pitcher first recruited by Gus who is now a scout for the Boston Red Sox, having been forced to find an alternate career after his arm gave out too soon. Johnny rounds out the odd trio, Johnny in his relationship to Gus as a former recruit and now rival scout, Gus with his awkward and ever frictional relationship with Mickey, and now Mickey who finds herself being drawn out in spite of herself by Johnny's almost clownish come-on's. And of course all three of them with their relationship with baseball, the one thing where they all find their moments of grace.

It has to be said that if Trouble With The Curve works at all, it is in no small part because of Amy Adams' performance. In spite of Lorenz' mechanical direction and Brown's pedestrian script, Adams manages to make Mickey shine nonetheless, engaging you in ways that make you buy into her character even when you'd otherwise see no reason to. Some of her best moments are those in which she has no dialogue and it's just the expression on her face conveying what Mickey is feeling that make the connection. Her scenes with Eastwood and with Timberlake work because she makes them work, bringing a chemistry to the situations that keeps you watching and makes you care. Eastwood's Gus is adequate to the role, but only just, with Eastwood basically just playing the same role he's been playing for the last twenty years, largely glaring and growling his way through things, mostly relying in this case on the fact that at 82 he actually _is_ old instead of having to act old.  In the hands of a better director, Eastwood would almost certainly have given a better performance, but one of the problems with Trouble With The Curve is that Lorenz doesn't seem to know how to draw the best out of his actors or the situations they're in. Timberlake is not only largely wasted but in retrospect grossly miscast:  he would have been far more effective as Gus's in-house nemesis Sanderson. As Johnny, he really doesn't have much credibility or even reason to be there as you could pretty much cut all of his scenes and it wouldn't affect the main plot in the slightest. But at the same time, his scenes with Adams do give her even more opportunities to shine. One of my favorite scenes is in a country bar where Mickey pulls a reluctant Johnny out onto the dance floor for a throw-him-in-the-water lesson in clog-dancing.

The other performances are a mixed bag, but two in particular stand out in ways that encapsulate the problems with the script and the direction.  Matthew Lillard's Phil is almost a caricature of a sleazey underhanded in-house rival to Gus, so over-the-top that you know from the moment he first opens his mouth that you're supposed to hate him. I think this could be something of a career problem for Lillard as he's gone from always playing goofy comic sidekicks when he was younger to now playing complete sleazeballs in recent years, most recently in The Descendants.  And Joe Massingill's Bo Gentry is so unbelievably obnoxious that it's a mystery why the rest of his team hasn't taken him out behind the stadium and beaten him to death with his own bat long before Gus and Mickey show up. If Trouble With The Curve had been an outright comedy, then both Lillard and Massingill's performances would've fit perfectly, but as it is, some subtlety was badly needed and unfortunately was completely lacking, the primary blame for which must be laid at the feet of Lorenz and Brown.

One wishes that Lorenz and Brown had been more daring or ambitious, given the talented actors they had to work with, but they weren't. You can tell early on that before Trouble With The Curve is over, all problems will be resolved in true Hollywood fashion, the characters you like will all triumph in the end and the characters you dislike will all get their deserved comeuppance. One also wishes that they'd gotten a more experienced director and writer to begin with as quite frankly Lorenz and Brown display a lack of talent in both the direction and the writing. The one element of mystery in the film - the reason why Gus and Mickey have such distance between them - when finally revealed feels completely artificial due in part to the clunky way in which the foreshadowing was handled and in part to the fact that, once revealed, it apparently makes no difference to either character as the movie just returns to its original track. The editing is often jumpy in places instead of smooth, and apparently Lorenz never wanted to do more than one take because you're constantly seeing all of the major actors' eyes looking to the sides, apparently to read cue cards to get through their lines. A regrettable waste of A-list actors in the C-list hands of a first-time director and a first-time writer.

On the plus side, the feel of the settings is well done, and you can believe that you're actually seeing Gus and Mickey doing a scouting mission in a small town where a local baseball star can be a big fish in a small pond. The music score by Marco Beltrami is also well done, setting the tone in the background without ever being intrusive so that you're barely aware that it's there, exactly the kind of score you need in a film like this.

Recommended for Amy Adams' brilliant performance and for anyone interested in a film about baseball recruiting and doesn't mind if the rest of the film is routine and completely predictable.

PS - A particular thanks to 'ellison' who corrected me in an earlier draft of this review when I mistakenly thought that the Grizzlies in the film were a minor league team. I didn't know that players in minor league teams were ones who had already been drafted as the minor league teams are owned by the majors.  You learn something new every day.  :)",1348272000,,8622,4.7
5301348,3,B009AMAK54,"In this 2012 offering, Clint Eastwood makes his return to the big screen since the blockbuster, ""Gran Torino"".  Eastwood plays Gus Lobel, an ancient, ailing baseball scout for the Atlanta Braves, who is perhaps embarking on his last scouting road trip, as younger Braves management is beginning to see him as an anachronism rather than an asset.  Fortunately, his scouting boss happens to be his good friend and supporter, Pete (played by John Goodman), who suspects Gus is having physical problems.  Pete calls up Gus's estranged daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), an aspiring corporate lawyer, and urges her to go with her father on this last road trip.  Being fiercely independent, Gus resents the intrusion of his daughter into his job, but after his anger subsides, he stubbornly accepts her at his side.  Gus's job is to scout a highly touted top high school baseball prospect and decide whether ""Bo"" should be the Braves number one pick in the upcoming draft.  It readily becomes apparent that Gus' failing vision puts him at a distinct disadvantage of evaluating Bo, so daughter Mickey steps in to be her father's failing eyes.  In the process, she tries to reconnect with her father and figure out why he seemed to reject her and ignore her after the death of her mother when she was just 6 years old.  She also rediscovers her true love of baseball, and learns from her father the intricacies on how to scout players, from the flow of their swings to the sound of the fastball hitting a mitt.  Intermixed into the relationship is  Johnny Flanagan, (Justin Timberlake), a rival scout who takes a definite love interest in Gus's daughter, Mickey.

Although the movie stars Clint Eastwood, clearly, this is Amy Adams' movie.  She absolutely shines in her role of ""Mickey"" (named after Gus's favorite Yankee player), and she single-handedly rescues this film from being a mediocre film about an aging old man, to a very relevant film on how a father and daughter reconcile their past hurts and differences.  To his credit, Eastwood knows to step back from the limelight and let Adam's star shine.  While baseball plays a major role as the backdrop of this movie, it is the troubled parent-child relationship that is the core of this film. Amy Adams is nothing but terrific and her performance may very well be Oscar-worthy.  Justin Timberlake, as Johnny, is also remarkably well cast as Mickey's love interest.  I thought Timberlake could only sing; but his acting performance is more than adequate, and his relationship with the emotionally confused and tentative Mickey carries this movie forward in a huge way. A strong supporting cast, namely John Goodman, shores up this movie as well.

The ending is particularly satisfying, and while all the questions about the troubled relationship between parent and child are never fully answered, clearly, the relationship is healed, and there is a promising future for both Gus, Mickey, and Johnny.

I hope this is not Eastwood's last film performance.  He has some emotionally engaging scenes where he really shows his range as an actor.  He has so much more to give yet to the film industry.  I hope he finds another role that allows his diverse talents to shine.

While probably not generally appealing to the crucial 16-24 age group, (thus not a box office smash hit), I believe many ""Baby Boomers"" will appreciate this movie, not only for the portrayal of the angrily aging parent, but for the reconciliation that is possible in all relationships.

(Rated PG-13 for language).

5301349,3,B009AMAK54,"""Trouble with the Curve"" is Clint Eastwood's first acting role since 2008's ""Gran Torino."" Eastwood was talked out of acting retirement for this movie. The San Francisco born actor turned 82 this year and it seems as though ""Trouble with the Curve"" took advantage of his age. Eastwood plays Gus; a baseball scout who is too stubborn to retire or make time to deal with his health issues. While this is probably the best way to approach writing a character for someone of Eastwood's age, ""Trouble with the Curve"" often feels like surveillance footage of Clint Eastwood being ancient rather than being anything substantial. The health issues in the movie relate to his eyesight, so seeing him run into furniture or not being able to see a baseball player swing a bat are vital to that story point. So did we really need to see him have trouble urinating or curse at his bladder the entire time?

The drama feels pretty unbearable until Gus's daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) enters the picture. Adams makes ""Trouble with the Curve"" worthwhile thanks to her strong on-screen presence. Her performance makes it seem like she really is Gus's daughter as she has stubbornness and is extremely tough, but at the same time she's extremely smart-witted and incredibly flawed thanks to how Gus always put baseball before his daughter.

Meanwhile, Justin Timberlake isn't bad but doesn't really stand out either. Johnny Flanagan (Timberlake) was a pitcher who could once pitch a fastball at over 100mph, but eventually threw his arm out and is now a scout for the Braves just like Gus. His one-liners are often pretty humorous, but his performance overall seems to struggle to be as charming or even keep up with Adams' performance.

The forced relationship between Gus and Mickey is the heart and soul of the movie. Not only is that a focal point of the story, but the chemistry between Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams is what keeps the movie from being a complete train wreck. Gus still grieves over the loss of his wife and feels like he did what was best for his daughter while Mickey feels as though Gus pushed her away to keep baseball the main priority in his life. Their arguments and their bonding moments are when ""Trouble with the Curve"" is at its best.

The Gus character has the same problem that Hushpuppy's dad Wink did in ""Beasts of the Southern Wild."" If the character wasn't so stubborn, his issues wouldn't be as inflated as they turn out to be. But at the same time, you wouldn't have the same journey laid out before you and the final product wouldn't be nearly as interesting.

In what is quite possibly the best scene in ""Trouble with the Curve,"" a man hits on Mickey at a bar and grabs her arm and Gus ends up stepping in and threatening the guy with a broken beer bottle. As the confrontation escalates, Johnny steps in, makes a smart aleck comment and the guy eventually walks away. The scene combines humor, intensity, and drama into one sequence that lasts only a few moments, but its consequences are felt long after and when its finally revealed why Gus jumped in then it gains quite a bit of depth as well.

The issue with ""Trouble with the Curve"" is that it's nothing special. While it certainly may contribute that the person writing this review isn't a fan of any sport, that doesn't always play a factor as ""Moneyball"" from last year was pretty good. If you can get past Eastwood whispering nearly every line, then he doesn't do too bad of a job here. Amy Adams is the only reason you should really go to see this though. She's really coming into her own as an actress and does an exceptional job here. ""Trouble with the Curve"" does take a while to get going, but thanks to the tainted father/daughter relationship at its core is much more sentimental than it lets on.",1348185600,,3784,4.631892697466468

It's a steal as a rental at 99 cents , or purchase for $6.99.
It has a tremendous cast: Eastwood, Adams, John Goodman, and Justin Timberlake, who is working hard on serious acting, and does a good job in his role as a promising pitcher permanently benched with an injury before making it out of the farm league.
He meets Eastwood and Adams on the road in his new job as a scout.
Timberlake is a very smart, witty, guy.  He needs to keep dialing back his natural charm he used to work the crowd in his ""boy band"" days, and I think he could end up becoming a very good actor.
Its a feel good movie you can watch with kids, grandparents, etc.
Maybe it's hard to play off Easteood's interminable scowl, (I DO love Clint, and my mom who just passed, said, ""I love the way he walks."" Snow on the roof......)  but I kept thinking if they just turned up the energy in this film, it could maybe have been great, instead of just good.
Another older feel-good true story is 'Invincible"", with Mark Wahlberg  as a sandlot player, who lost his job and wife during a deep recession in the 70's, making an unheard of walk-on spot on the Philadelphia Eagles. Great music and inspiring story that just might inspire audible cheering.

5301970,3,B009AMAK54,"The third time (so far!) that Clint Eastwood plays the same character. The crotchety old guy with a dead wife and a troubled relationship with a daughter. It was great in Million Dollar Baby, wearing thin in Gran Torino, and now it is just a caricature. He played the same role for years as the squinty-eyed  cowboy type, and now I guess this is his new persona. It's tiresome. We are supposed to believe that everyone loves him even though he treats them all like crap. Was he ever a nice guy? Who cares? And seeing a scrawny old septuagenarian take on a young, strapping redneck in a bar and not get his ass handed to him is a stretch of the imagination for sure. He would have been toast in the real world.

Then it's all wrapped up nice and neat in the last ten minutes and they all lived happily ever after. Just average and very predictable. Seeing Clint Eastwood play a fun guy who enjoys himself and is nice to people - now that would be a stretch for him. I guess he's just too tired to try to be more than one character. Too bad.",1491782400,,1039,4.21608040201005

The writing, the directing,  the poor casting decisions, the overall artlessness of this film made me irritated at having gotten sucked into watching this based on the 4plus star reviews.  I give one star because John Goodman and Justin Timberlake were great.  Poor Amy had nothing decent to work with especially combined with Clint Eastwood's truly terrible performance.

5302322,4,B009AMAK54,"My review is a correction of TreyRoo1's review: ""I liked it"".

TreyRoo1 provided a great, insightful film review overall. In his review, TreyRoo1 incorrectly states that Matthew Lillard's character is John Goodman's character's boss. This is incorrect, as Pete Klein, played by John Goodman, is actually Phillip Sanderson's colleague (played by Matthew Lillard), since Phillip is also a scout, one that Pete notes has never watched a player actually play on the field, instead relying on computer statistics. Also, TreyRoo1's review claims that Gus informed his daughter, Mickey, that his sight was failing him. This is inaccurate, as Mickey states in an earlier scene that she had called the longtime family doctor about her father, Gus', health, and he had filled her in. Though the audience is not told explicitly what was shared, audiences can reasonably conclude that the doctor shared with Mickey about her father's condition, macular degeneration, early onset glaucoma, etc., since this was the only news the doctor had to share with Gus during the visit. At best, we can see Gus confirm what the doctor had already shared with Mickey.",1483142400,,1142,5.206521739130435

5302781,5,B009AMAK54,"I normally do not like movies about sports. I love sports; just not movies about sports. That being said, this film was not so much about baseball as it was about a father and daughter relationship.
It also touched on how technology has taken over the human element of scouting for players. This film is the complete opposite of Money Ball, where technology actually helps in building a team. Gus Lobel (Clint Eastwood) is an aging scout for the Atlanta Braves who is struggling with his eyesight and the front office has doubts about whether or not he is still up to the job of spotting up and coming talent. Because of this affliction, Gus is a grumpy old man which actually adds a lot of humor to the film. His character kind of reminded me of the character that Eastwood played in Grand Torino. His daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) discovers that her father is having difficulty, reluctantly takes on the roll of caregiver and follows her father on his scouting adventure. Incidentally, she knows more about baseball than probably anyone else in this film. Johnny Flanagan (Justin Timberlake) is an aspiring sports announcer who was scouted by Gus years ago. The relationship that develops between Mickey (named for Mickey Mantle) and Johnny is fun to watch and provides some insight to Mickey's reluctance to develop a serious relationship with any man. Pete Klein (John Goodman) plays the mediator role that brings Mickey and Gus together. I really liked his unyielding devotion and trust to Gus. It was also good to once again see Scott Eastwood (Billy Clark) act alongside his father. They have acted together in several films, and it was good to see them spending some family time together. I think that the entire cast definitely made this film better and I am sure that it will draw young viewers to the theater. I do not think that this film was utterly brilliant, but it was thoroughly entertaining. There were aspects of the film that were totally predictable, but I looked forward to seeing it play out. Director Robert Lorenz may not have hit it out of the park (like he did with Million Dollar Baby), but I think that it is a definite triple play. I recommend that you do not sit on the bench and go out and see this film. I give this film a green light.",1474243200,,2266,4.6393034825870645

5303341,4,B009AMAK54,"Taking the opposite tack from Moneyball, this film is about how a HUMAN can recognize talent (or lack of it) better than running computer statistics on a player (as in Moneyball). Clint Eastwood is fine in an old salt role, Amy Adams is pretty good as his hardened-hearted lawyer daughter who seeks resolution on their relationship. Also with Justin Timberlake as the love interest. I might also mention that John Goodnman is one of the best performances in the film. Because there are a few slow moments in the film, I held the fifth star from the review. But honestly, I'd watch this film again and again (I'm up to four viewings, I think).

5303415,3,B009AMAK54,"Fairly good but could have been awesome!  First, who doesn't love Clint Eastwood?  Overall he did a fairly nice job.  My complaint is the storytelling was a bit disjointed at times.  Developing the story/introduction of the baseball ""find"" could have been done better.  I think there could have been a little more realism in the portrayal of the tension between Eastwood and his daughter (sometimes at parts in the movie I found myself thinking ""real life doesn't happen that way"").  The ""shadow"" scout was never really shown and then it just pops up towards the end that he's been there the whole time? (don't want to give too much away).  The relationship-mending between 2 supporting characters at the end seemed too quick and easy.  John Goodman is great!  The burned-out player who becomes a scout does a great job, too!  Again, I would have opted to ""tell"" the story just a little differently in a few areas.  Decent and entertaining move overall.  Cheers!",1462752000,,962,4.8343558282208585

there are those that want him out.,
'Gus's' sight is failing, age is taking it's toll.
He insists on going on one more scouting trip.
his daughter 'Mickey'(Amy Adams) is persuaded by 'Gus's' pal 'Pete'
(John Goodman) to go with her father.
The two have not been close in recent years,however 'Mickey' decides to
join her reluctant father on the trip.
Despite his failing eyesight 'Gus still has a good 'ear' for talent.
Must admit i understood that 'Gran Torino' would be his final on-screen
appearance............really glad he chose to take this part....loved it.",1447286400,,636,5.125

Pros: The characters are believable and likable. It looks and sounds professional.  Like a good hitter, it exhibits excellent timing. Finally, as Clint Eastwood nears the sunset of his career, I found his exit in this film moving. Rated PG-13 for profanity and crass language.",1446940800,,421,5.1911764705882355

5304043,3,B009AMAK54,"The great cast doesn't seem to know how to play this movie - is it a comedy or is it a clever play on words on multiple levels? While it does have it's moments, overall, it's not any better than ho-hum. The cast members seem to be working hard and the storyline is like a short story that can be understood in the manner of peeling an onion to get at the underlying truths. In my estimation, it fails as a comedy because the levity is very predictable. It falls ""short"" as a short story (sorry). It's supposed to be a baseball story (but then we all know it's just another a boy meets girl story) . Unfortunately the baseball parts do not all ring true.",1446249600,,653,4.190476190476191

5304102,5,B009AMAK54,"Can a grumpy old man (Clint Eastwood) and his estranged daughter (Amy Adams) outsmart the bad guy and find happiness?  The answer is yes, if John Goodman can get them together before its too late, and Justin Timberlake shows up to distract Adams attention away from her fathers bullheadedness.  The backdrop is pastoral North Caroline where baseball and family picnics go hand-in-hand, and where Eastwood is scouting a hot young hitting prospect for the Atlanta Braves.  Eastwood, as usual, is a man of few words, stubborn, resilient and, in this movie surprisingly vulnerable.  If he doesnt make the right decision, his distinguished career will end in disgrace.  Adams is equally stubborn.  At the request of Goodman (and against her better judgement) she puts her law career on hold to help her father.  Hes having trouble seeing clearly without glasses (which he won't wear) so she becomes his eyes.  She knows baseball almost as well as he does, and confirms his doubts about the hitting prospect; more importantly, she discovers a prodigious flame-throwing pitcher.  Everything comes to a head back at the stadium in Atlanta where Eastwoods hunch is proved correct: the slugger cannot hit the curve.  The bad guy who drafted the hitter over Eastwoods objections is fired.  Adams presents the team with her pitching discovery and now must decide to return to her law firm or accept a front-office position with the Braves (presumably as general manager).  Her unhappy relationship with her father mended, and Timberlake back at her side, the credits roll on a decidedly happy ending.  Eastwood and Adams make for a dynamic acting duo.  Five stars.",1444780800,,1652,5.07037037037037

It has a great cast:Clint Eastwood, Amy Adams, Justin Timberlake and the gentleman who played Roseanne's t.v. hubby, John Goodman.  Timberlake's role is subtle, sweet and so believeable.  There is a fine chemistry between the actors Amy Adams and Clint Eastwood.  Yep, there was no doubt that she is the crusty old fart's daughter and she is as sharp as he is in scouting out baseball talent.  Goodman is the faithful friend who stands by his buddy.  As always with Eastwood, the movie is poignant and yet humorous;it speaks to the hearts of American viewers who yearn for a sweet uplifting story that they are not embarrassed to share with their children.",1443139200,,764,4.706766917293233

5304234,4,B009AMAK54,"Not much better than Gran Torino, not a violence-fest as most Eastwood movies are, there are only two fight scenes and both are not bloody, not particularly violent. Movie deals with ageism and how younger generation ignores older parents until things reach crisis level. Clint's character plays aging scout for Atlanta Braves, whom the younger scouts disdain and treat him like stupid old man. Daughter is career-climbing lawyer, who is focused on becoming youngest partner ever in law firm. Movie has decent story line and good scenes. Cliche scenes between Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake characters, but sure to draw a few awwwws from the audience. John Goodman does great supporting job as other old timer who sticks up for Clint and talks daughter into checking in on Clint's character because he realizes she is clueless as to what is happening to old man. I wish they developed the character of the subject HS ballplayer they were scouting some more, he did a great job portraying the arrogant, self-important, entitled star of the team. His scenes interacting with the other players were priceless!

5304296,4,B009AMAK54,"Nice drama about an aging baseball scout and an opportunity he has to bond with his lawyer daughter.  Slow, and somewhat sweet with melancholy overtones.

Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams have a believable father/daughter relationship, Justin Timberlake is good as the love interest for the daughter, and Matthew Lillard plays the quintessential jerk.

The only funny thing is the premise that baseball scouting benefits from the human factor. I reality, and as Moneyball shows, baseball is largely statistics driven.  Still, it is a good baseball movie, if not a great one, and definitely worth a rental.",1442016000,,601,5.229166666666667

5305223,4,B009AMAK54,"Trouble with the Curve
 As sports movies go this is not bad but it is not a patch on Eastwoods Million Dollar Baby.  As Eastwood movies go this one is not bad but it is not a patch on Gran Torino.  This is a solidly entertaining film about a cranky old baseball scout on his way to perhaps overdue retirement and his estranged daughter, a 32 year old attorney on her way up.  If Eastwood was not involved in the film, we would be able to better judge it on its own merits.  Because he stars as the cranky scout, we expect-based on passed experience-to see true blue movie magic.  We get a very conventional but worthy movie instead.
 This is the first Eastwood film that he has not also directed in many years, and it shows.  Robert Lorenz is a long time film producer who has been involved in creating such successful recent Eastwood projects as Gran Torino, Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima.  His relationship with Eastwood goes back decades.  This is his first outing as a director.
 But the lack of pop and zing this time can be laid at the feet of writer Randy Brown, also in his first time out.  This is ordinary, predicable and verges on the pedestrian.  This can also be said of the vast majority of sports films.  It is in some measure the nature of the beast.  Perhaps writer Brown and director Lorenz would have done better with a lesser luminary in the starring role.  It surely would have lowered expectations.
 Amy Adams plays the daughter with the right balance of fire and pathos.  There is a sub-plot about her relationship with her dad, a single father after the sudden and early death of the wife and mother.  It is not a happy relationship.  Her love interest is Justin Timberlake.  I like Timberlake better and better every time I see him.  I am still astonished that the boy band singer has so successfully transitioned to movie actor.  Eastwood of course is terrific.  He is much less likable than his character in Gran Torino, which fans will not like.  But his portrayal is fine.  Just remember that he didn't write the way the character is, Randy Brown did.  Eastwood just plays the role as written, and does that with excellence.
 This is a three saw blade movie, acceptable in anyone except the larger than life movie gargantuan that post retirement Eastwood has become.  It is rated PG-13 for some language issues and hinted at sex but no naked people and no gory stuff.  It runs an hour and 51 minutes.
 I liked this movie just fine.  There are enough clever and accurate references to ageing to make it interesting to people my age and the father/daughter stuff is tragic and touching by turns.",1426809600,,2639,4.5021097046413505

5305439,4,B009AMAK54,"Trouble with the Curve(released Sept/12)stars,among others,Clint Eastwood,Amy Adams,Justin Timberlake,Matthew Lillard and John Goodman. This is a wonderfully acted,well edited and tight little film. Eastwood comes on board as a co-producer but is more than ably backed by a solid cast.
The story finds Eastwood as an aging baseball scout for the Atalanta Braves. He has three major strikes against him:a fellow colleague(younger)that would like to see him gone and put out to pasture,a smart and talented lawyer daughter(Adams) from whom he is on a fragile relationship with, and macular degeneration,hampering his ability to see/scout..
Eastwood is given an assignment to check out a hitting prospect in North Carolina. While there Adams joins him at the bequest of his boss,Goodman. She used to go with her dad when she was younger while scouting, and over time became as  savvy about the game as any person around. Unfortunately,her father placed her in her uncle's hands after his wife died and an incident(which she learns about later) in which she was sexually assaulted(but does not recall).Since that time their relationship has been strained because of Eastwood's short sightedness and lack of communication about how Adams feels about the issues that have come between them.
She spends a few days with her dad being his eyes and scouting the prospect,even though she has a client pitch to make back in Atlanta,for which she may be offered a promotion to partnership if successful. While juggling these two things in comes Timberlake a former pitcher who is now a scout like his old pal Eastwood. The two eventually hit it off but it is a roller coaster of a ride due to the emotional wall she has developed over time. Timberlake breaks through, but not without a major glitch popping up. Eastwood discovers their batting prospect has heretofore unseen problems with special pitches like curves and rejects him as a prospect .He advises Timberlake to reject him also. Back home the Braves management is persuaded against Eastwoods judgement(from a wet behind the ears fellow scout) to take him anyways. The next day Timberlake's future has collapsed, as his bosses think he let a good prospect go to the Braves. Timberlake in turn takes it out on Adams and leaves in a huff. To top this she receives news that her bosses are going to let another associate at her firm take on the client pitch,thereby depriving her of the shot for a partnership she has worked years to obtain.
Eastwood the next morning has gone and taken the bus back home,leaving his car with his daughter. At the motel they have been staying at the owner's son is outside pitching to his younger brother. The guy is a natural talent and she persuades Goodman to give him a try in Atlanta. Next day she and her new found talent arrive at the stadium,and her father,Goodman and other management types are there to witness him pitching against their new batting acquisition. He puts on a demonstration of super raw talent and their new batter cannot hit one ball thrown at him. Out with the battter, and in with the pitcher. Eastwood proclaims his daughter as the pitchers manager and is offered a renewal on that contract of his. Walking out of the stadium his daughter finds out that the associate who made her pitch ran into trouble, and they want her to step in to what should have been hers to begin with. She gives them the same answer Eastwood gave his bosses about his contract renewal:""I'll think about it"".Outside Timberlake has been waiting patiently, and Adams and he have a grand make up. The film ends as Eastwood walks off alone, bemoaning the fact that he will have to take the bus.
This is such a well acted and solid film. There are no pretensions here. It is a straightforward story told with some nice twists,and edited and shot beautifully. The film keeps a classy look and tone to it. I wish the makers of a more recent flick called The Judge,with Robert Downey Jr.and Robert Duvall,had taken a lesson from this one. There is a scene in that film in which Downey has a down and dirty  and graphic sex scene with a fellow actor. It essentially ruined what was,up to that point,a film along the same lines as this one. Trouble with the Curve,to its credit,did not take the easy and low route like so many films do these days. In a scene in a lake where Adams and Timberlake finally come together,they share a passionate kiss. The camera lingers just long enough, and then there is a cut to the following day. Leaving it to one's imagination is what real film making should be about,but seems to be a lost art in this day and age. Eastwood plays the curmudgeonly baseball scout to a tee. He has plenty of scenes to stretch,acting wise,and  makes the most of it. Goodman,Timberlake,Adams are top notch and the rest of the cast also ably supports along the way.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.there is a featurette on the making of the film.
All in a lovely film. A story told in a straightforward manner with enough twists to keep you interested throughout. The cast is super solid and Eastwood really shines in his role. Don't let the baseball angle throw you off. This has something everyone can relate to. 4 1/2 stars.",1420416000,,5264,4.744541484716157

5305468,5,B009AMAK54,"The movie as a whole was a good movie, but, there was a little bit more profanity than was necessary for the movie, but, still a good movie over all.  I guess a typical Clint Eastwood movie.",1419724800,,190,4.135135135135135
5305469,5,B009AMAK54,"Trouble with the Curve is a sports drama film starring Clint Eastwood in his supposed final acting role. It revolves around an aging baseball scout whose daughter joins him on a scouting trip. Robert Lorenz directed it.

Gus Lobel has been one of the best scouts in baseball for decades, but, despite his efforts to hide it, age is starting to catch up with him. Nevertheless, Gus, who can tell a pitch just by the crack of the bat, refuses to be benched for what may be the final innings of his career. He may not have a choice. The front office of the Atlanta Braves is starting to question his judgment, especially with the country's hottest batting phenom on deck for the draft. He is given one last assignment to prove his worth to the organization, which sees him as unable to adapt to changes in the business. His boss and friend Pete, who does not want to see him let go, asks Gus's daughter Mickey to join him on the trip to make sure he's okay, against Gus's wishes. Together they scout a top new prospect in North Carolina, where Mickey begins to take an active role in her father's work to make up for his failing vision, which he has hidden from his bosses. Along the way Gus reconnects with Johnny, a rival team's scout who has a friendly history with Gus, as Gus was the man who scouted him when he was a baseball player, and who also takes an interest in Mickey.

Though predictable and somewhat dramatically underwhelming, it benefits from Eastwood's grizzled charisma as he looks a in his 80's and lot trimmer compared to some of the performers in this film half his age. He may be the only octogenarian actor who has to play older than his age to be convincing. Added to that, his easy chemistry with a charming Adams benefits the film so much. Both do the best they can with the cornball sentimentality and cheesy dialogue which turns out great as this film is a stunning, beautiful surprise. Like the baseball diamond that features so prominently, we all know which base will be dutifully tapped next and that a home run for the characters is inevitable. It is a sports movie, a romance without sentimentality, and the emotional trauma of a family secret.",1419638400,,2176,4.520304568527918

I didn't really read any reviews about the movie before I watched it, so I wasn't expecting it to be a movie about father-daughter and female-male love interest relationships.

5305753,3,B009AMAK54,"For a movie with a superb cast, this film just doesn't deliver. Most of the acting is good (as you'd expect), if take each scene individually. But there's too many separate stories going on, and they don't come together to collaborate into a good film. The end is redeeming at least, although it is such a typical hollywood ending, you see it coming from the beginning.",1411430400,,369,4.606060606060606

I would have liked to see him do something different here.  The conflict between Clint and his estranged daughter is really the story line here, and is explored well, with Justin Timberlake thrown in for some romantic interest.  In the end, Trouble with the Curve suffers a bit with a hastily thrown together ending, but is still a ""feel good"" movie worth a watch on a lazy afternoon or evening at home.",1410307200,,524,4.612903225806452

The plot is along familiar lines, but very well done, despite the somewhat fairy tale ending (all the bad people get their comeuppance, the good people triumph).

Amy has one of her best roles as a troubled young woman.

5306022,2,B009AMAK54,A very decent plot and characters could have been interesting. Clint Eastwood was too old to be the father of Amy Adam's character and the grouchy old man persona is getting old. It was Grand Torino on the baseball diamond. If he had played it as a regular distant father it would have been more believable. It got better toward the end thanks to Timberlake and Adams.,1406678400,,368,4.507462686567164

Clint as an ailing crotchety old baseball scout and his estranged lawyer daughter played perfectly by  the lovely Amy Adams.  John Goodman is strong as his best friend and Justin Timberlake does an amicable job as aspiring radio announcer doing miner league scouting to keep himself in the baseball business.  Like ""Moneyball"",  baseball is the perfect back drop for a look at the people around the game with a great twist at the end that will have you giving a great cheer.",1405641600,,614,4.745283018867925

5306271,3,B009AMAK54,"I liked this movie, although it is a pretty predictable story.  The good guys and bad guys are sorted out pretty early.  Eastwood plays a pretty mean old guy right up until the very end, when he suddenly seems pretty reasonable, especially toward his daughter.  I think he did a much more exceptional mean, old guy in ""Gran Torino.""  In any case, the story is engaging and the supporting characters do a good job (I'm not quite sold on Justin Timberlake in this role, but he seems like a decent actor).  This is pretty light fare; if you want  more dramatic Eastwood, try ""Gran Torino"" or ""Unforgiven.""",1396742400,,602,4.579439252336448
5306272,5,B009AMAK54,"When i first learned about this movie and the title I thought of something provocative. Curves? Probably a woman's figure until I actually saw the movie. Yes! A baseball story filled with suspense and humor that I could watch over and over again.
An aging baseball scout named Gus, played by Clint Eastwood, with failing eye sight joins up with his estranged daughter, played by Amy Adams, to pursue a promising young ball player for the Atlantic Braves.
Gus was once known as one of the best baseball scouts in the major league. Now, however, the Atlantic Braves start to cast doubts on his ability to choose good ball players. Then, a daughter whom he hasn't seen for years helps him save his career. It's a tantalizing experience for Gus to work with a daughter, a lawyer, who he never knew, while at the same time struggle with a physical limitation that may hamper a baseball career he grew to love. Gus rides the hurdles with lots of pressure on his back that must've been devastating.
This movie intrigues me. Filled with lots of suspense and humor I can watch it all day. I liked the part when Gus challenged a called strike by the umpire while his daughter sat by amazed. ""How did you know it was a strike,"" she asked. His reply, I heard it."" And I laughed all the way home from the movies that day.
Anybody interested in a great baseball story will love this movie, and I, Marvin P. Ferguson, author of THE UNKNOWN BASEBALL PLAYER give it FIVE STARS.",1396569600,,1460,4.513207547169811

Amy Adams is very good as a woman caught between a path that was forced on her to be a lawyer and give up on baseball and the father who she loves, but doesn't have a good relationship with.

5306314,4,B009AMAK54,"Okay, how many times has Clint Eastwood hinted that he's done acting...I'm not complaining, just wondering.  Well, this star's latest comeback in the role of an aging baseball scout is a comeback to remember.  And while Clint Eastwood does just fine being Clint Eastwood, he'd be nowhere without the rest of this fine cast.  Amy Adams is always worth watching and her tom-boyish streak was a perfect touch.  I could never get enough of John Goodman and the man delivers here as a good friend and fair boss to Eastwood's character.  Matthew Lillard was perfectly slimey and Robert Patrick was great about seeming competent while missing something obvious...mainly Eastwood's skills as an actor and his characters knowledge of the American pasttime.  I'll be honest here...I want to like Justin Timberlake...I really do.  I'm just having trouble with his transition from boy band singer to serious actor.  But if Mr. Timberlake turns out more performances even half as good as this one, he'll win me over for sure.  Of course, no great cast is without a great story to work with and this film delivers on that just fine.  I do find the ending a bit too neat and perhaps corny, especially as it all depended on a number of pretty amazing coincidences and some serious luck.  But maybe this is just part of the film's charm...after all, some of our great historical moments are born out of coincidences and luck.  I'll admit I enjoyed the desperation exhibited by Robert Patrick's character when he was trying to get Clint Eastwood's character to renew his contract with the team, ready to offer him anything he wanted, and Mr. Eastwood wasn't in any hurry.  And sometimes, we just need an ending like this.  It's certainly no Disney fairytale (imagine Clint in one of those) but that doesn't mean a happy ending isn't out of the relm of possibilities.  This is a great film for families (minus young children) and it has something for everyone.  Enjoy.",1394496000,,1949,4.825301204819277

Clint's old geezer, self-deprecatory characters have been fun in the past-his anti hero in Forgiven, and comedic in Heartbreak Hill and Gran Torino.

5306395,5,B009AMAK54,"This review is based on the movie on HBO
Clint Eastwood does a good job as an aging former baseball player and minor league scout.
John Goodman does a fine job as Clint's best friend.
But the real star of this movie is Amy Adams, as Clint's daughter.
It's a baseball movie, about a home run hitter.
It's a buddy movie between Goodman and Eastward, but the ""curve"" in this movie is Adams.
Will she make it as a corporate lawyer? Will she decide to stay single?
Will she overcome her own and Clint's independence streak?
For me it was interesting to watch for the answers to these questions.",1390003200,,589,4.412844036697248

I must say..JOHN WAYNE is the biggest & great star of my generation...BUT CLINT EASTWOOD..is right up there with the Duke. No offense Duke..but Clint has really been directing,writing music,acting like no other actor of his time. Director great & late..Otto Preminger once said..""Actors can't direct..that's why they act..they can't do nothing else."" WOO..was he wrong. Paul Newman once directed a movie..which I own. He was great. The movie was""Somtimes A Great Notion"". John Wayne himself did it twice. But getting back to Clint Eastwood in this movie..""Trouble with the Curve."" For me it was a home run.

With Lake Chatuge as a backdrop and the Young Harris College baseball field as the set it constantly reminds me how much I take this beautiful part of North Georgia for granted.

5306626,5,B009AMAK54,"You would have thought the excellent ""Gran Torino"" would have been Clint Eastwood's swansong in front of the camera.  He must have found the script for ""Trouble with the Curve"" compelling enough that he had a change of heart.  Like most of the great baseball movies the sport is only a subtext.  The main themes here are family, friends, and loyalty.  Gus Lobel (Eastwood) has been a successful scout for the Braves for decades but he's slipping a little.  Instead of relying on the ""interweb"" for evaluating talent he depends on charts and his instincts in evaluating prospects.  There's a high school slugger in Gus' North Carolina territory that the organization is hot on and there is pressure on him to get the kid signed.  Mickey Lobel(Amy Adams) is a successful lawyer about to make partner who is aware of her father's travails.  As a young girl she used to travel with her father on scouting trips and a little of Gus' instincts rubbed off on her.  Despite her better instincts she drops everything to help her father.  Though not necessarily a dysfunctional relationship there is a bit of a disconnect. Mickey still harbors the wounds from being sent to live with relatives by Gus after her mother passed.  Throw in an amiable Red Sox scout (Justin Timberlake) who has as much an eye for the young slugger as for Mickey and you have a terrific dynamic.  As good as Eastwood is he wisely delegates the limelight to his younger co-stars.  John Goodman also turns in a good performance as Gus' friend in the organization.  Matthew Lillard, though, grates playing one of his stock idiots.  I love the atmosphere of this film from the dingy bars to the dinky motels.  I love the smell of the baseball diamonds, the hot dogs with mustard, and the roasted peanuts.  I love this movie.  I watched it with my ten year old nephew and he loved it, too.",1376438400,2,1851,4.643076923076923
5306627,4,B009AMAK54,"Certainly the star studded cast attracted me as did the landscape of scouting of baseball prospects. The characters were fascinating with Eastwood and Adams dealing with a not uncommon disconnect between elderly father and successful job obsessed daughter. Baseball provides a splendid backdrop for the main plot hook of the father/daughter dilemma. Timberlake as the love interest is compelling although appears a little too young for Adam's character. A happy ending helped! Look, this movie is not about brain surgery but it is a feel good little movie with no aliens, explosions, or saving the planet. No unnecessary graphic sex, gunplay or violence. It's a story of real people ala Woody Allen, and I wish there were more!",1376438400,2,727,5.169491525423729

5306654,5,B009AMAK54,"Trouble With the Curve is a really nice movie that takes place in a small town.  It's basically a light comedy and a light drama for that matter about scouting the best baseball players for the major league, but what elevates the movie to greatness probably has to do with the actors/actresses, which are all really spectacular and deserving of their big name well-known success.

You can probably guess the biggest one I'm going to mention since he's sort of legendary- Clint Eastwood!  He's wonderful.  He plays a grumpy old scout that has vision problems, but that doesn't prevent him from acknowledging the bigger picture- that he has a talent for knowing the good players from the bad.  Listen up young men- take Clint's advice since he's been around for a while.  His daughter is the center of the storyline.  Played by the beautiful and charming Amy Adams, she's constantly fighting and bickering with her father concerning her troubled childhood and why Clint Eastwood basically gave her away as a child, as well as informing people that she's more suitable for the scouting job than anyone else in that office.  Her baseball knowledge is just incredible.

Robert Patrick is one of the more underrated actors and a personal favorite of mine (DARN IT for the Unit being cancelled so soon!).  Justin Timberlake -while I'm certainly not a fan of his music, he plays a genuine good guy/boyfriend of Amy Adams in this movie.  We all John Goodman for his role in the Flintstones.  Haha, just kidding.  Roseanne all the way!  Bob Gunton- yes I recognize him from the hit TV show 24.  Matthew Lillard is the man who plays the guy everyone hates, being a know-it-all jerk and everything.  We want to see him make wrong decisions and take his walking papers!

Basically Trouble With the Curve is one of those feel-good type family movies that does everything correctly.  It's a movie that probably plays it safe with the storytelling more often than not, and any boring moments are occasional and quickly veer in a more constructive/enticing direction so there's always something to look forward to.  Perhaps light on substance, but again, the big name actors/actresses makes up for that tiny flaw.  Overall, quality movie.",1376006400,,2221,4.872

5306705,3,B009AMAK54,"I won't revisit the story line, as so many have already done that here. The story line is fine, although it could have focused on certain aspects that would have built drama. The tumultuous upbringing of Amy Adams character, as a result of her mother dying so young, should have been a focus, yet it gets two short scenes in which to build from. We get that she is a miserable person, but you aren't sure if it is because her personality was developed from agony or because she inherited her fathers gruff manner. There is just little character development.

For the baseball part of the story, which there isn't much, it is just barely okay. The scenery of all of these minor league ballparks in GA is great. Loved that! You really come to hate the star prospect that Gus and many other scouts are following. Although, he may be the best part of the movie! The baseball is atrocious. The concept that all these people are viewing a supposed regional prospect league with players that couldn't make a junior high team makes for a poor experience. I get it: the baseball is just the vehicle for the drama aspect of the plot. However, the baseball scenes are just so poorly played that you find yourself hoing thye are over.

Other parts are just rushed. The degrading of Gus' skills, the love development between Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake, the discovery of the hotel workers son as a major league pitcher are all just rushed and come off as hokey.

Last negative is that Amy Adams is just miscast. She is terrible in this movie. I mean, she ruins it.

So why the okay rating? Well, he ending is just great. I watch this entire movie just to see the last 5 minutes. The rest is just blah at best.",1374796800,,1700,4.456591639871383

Clint Eastwood plays an aging professional scout for the major league team, the Atlanta Braves. Unlike Moneyball's firm adherence to computers and stats as determining talent, Eastwood has nothing but disdain for computers and the ""interweb"". Scouts looking at ballplayers, he believes, is what drives this game. On a personal level he finds old age and regret to create problems with him physically with his vision and paternally with his daughter-played brilliantly by Amy Adams. There is a lot of stuff in here for the hardcore baseball fan and the director manages to beautifully capture the sights and sounds of what Cal Ripken once defined, as the great american game.
Spoiler alert.
At the end, Clint walks out of the ballpark, cigar in hand, growling. Albeit a much better exit from the acting stage than his hail of bullets kamikaze ploy in Gran Torino.",1372032000,,888,4.959731543624161

5306791,3,B009AMAK54,"What happens when you take quite a few excellent actors and put them in the same movie?  Almost always it's the same:  blah.  And blah some more.

Not that this is necessarily an ensemble film, but it is certainly close.  Clint Eastwood, one of the best directors ever and a very good actor as well.  Amy Adams, one of my favorite actresses who rarely makes a misfire.  Justin Timberlake, who I think is actually better as an actor than as a singer (check out ""The Social Network"" if you disagree.)  And John Goodman, who -- minus ""Roseanne"" -- is always good for a really good laugh.

I could argue that the dialog is full of sports clichs, and I would have a strong argument there.  However, in reality, people often speak in clichs in real life -- particularly sports; have you ever listened to a sports broadcast? -- so I don't always have a problem with it in film.  But worse, ""Trouble with the Curve"" feels overly manipulative to me.  You've got the daughter-who's-still-upset-with-daddy thing going on.  You've got the old-timer-who's-career-is-coming-to-a-close thing going on as well.  And you've got the unnecessary-love-triangle thing that might be the worst.  The entire plot just felt terribly contrived to me.

It looks like Mr. Eastwood didn't direct this film, and perhaps if he had, it would have surely been better.  I think that if he had directed, he would have required a rewrite on the script, and he would have made it less manipulative.  After all, Mr. Eastwood is an expert at taking a story, telling it straight, and not purposefully manipulating his audience.

What's the ""Trouble with the Curve""?  I think there was a story here somewhere trying to get out that, well, unfortunately remained on the bench.  And to risk using another sports clich while simultaneously ending a sentence with a preposition:  They should have just sent Robert Lorenz down and called Mr. Eastwood up.",1371168000,,1908,4.842105263157895

5306797,4,B009AMAK54,"Whereas MONEYBALL makes a case for the cold hard stats of sabermetrics, THE TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE celebrates the gut instinct and the long years of experience of the baseball scout. In the realm of America's national pastime, old Gus Lobel (Clint Eastwood) roams, a dinosaur in the era of the tech-savvy armchair pundit. Gus is a veteran baseball scout for the Atlanta Braves. In the twilight of his career, his eyes are steadily failing him. It's not fully incapacitated him yet, but he's steady tripping over stuff now. His contract is up in three months. He gets wind that management is set to put him out to pasture. Gus, that stubborn, snarling mule, is just ornery enough to prove them wrong.

Mickey (Amy Adams) is Gus's estranged 33-year-old daughter, an ambitious attorney on the cusp of being made partner. She's named after her dad's favorite baseball player. When an old family friend approaches her to relate her father's faltering vision, she's guilted into coming along Gus's latest scouting foray, never mind that Gus is fiercely against her tagging along. That tender father-daughter intimacy thing just ain't his bag.

I could've sworn GRAN TORINO was the last bow, and that Eastwood was forever done with the acting side of the industry. But acting's an itch, isn't it? You can say that THE TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE is a bit obvious, and there's no arguing from me. You can say it's too leisurely paced, but that's what you get with character studies. The film works hard to get into the skins of its characters, is diligent with examining the two leads' foibles and quirks and a slew of neuroses that runs bone deep. It peels back layers. There are tiny details and pieces of memory that unfold gradually, the blend and sum of which explain away that monumental rift between Gus and Mickey. Gus is such a defensive, self-reliant old cuss. It literally pains him to have to depend on someone. You never question his daughter's committment to set things right. After all, this is Amy Adams playing the role, and Amy Adams exudes sunshine and light. The question always was will Gus learn to bend and meet her halfway. He's never had before.

I'm still not sold on Justin Timberlake as an actor. In each film I'd seen him in before, he seemed to be always ""on."" That feeling doesn't evaporate with his performance here, but he's likable as the once promising pitcher ('til he wrecked his arm) and now fledgling scout for the Red Sox. He strikes an easy familiarity with Eastwood and is off-the-cuff charming with Adams. Timberlake presents the film's secondary and tertiary plotlines. Not only is he Mickey's potential love interest, he and Gus are vying for the same high school power hitter. More instrumental is that he provides the bridge between Gus and Mickey. Who would've thunk it that JT could pull off a part that's funny and diplomatic and wise? But his clogging is horrible.

THE TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE works too hard for the perfect conclusion, except by that time I am so invested in the characters and their interactions that damn if I didn't lap it all up, all the convenient but very satisfying endings (Take that, Matthew Lillard!). The narrative won't ambush you with crazy plot twists. The conflicts are ones that play out a lot in typical familial relationship dramas. But Eastwood and Adams' nuanced performances glue you to where you'd parked your butt. I enjoyed THE TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE, but for Eastwood, GRAN TORINO is the better film to go out on.

5306812,1,B009AMAK54,"If you are a baseball fan, you will hate this movie.  It is apparently an attempt to counter Moneyball and the idea that baseball can be figured out by analyzing stats.  It stars a grizzled old scout who, even though he has gone blind, can hear how good a batter is by the swish of his bat from hundreds of feet away.  His rival is a stat geek, using a newfangled computer thingy to try to scout players.  Of course in the end the old scout is a genius and the computer geek is wrong.  And how do they know he's wrong?  Because the guy his computer told him to draft swung and missed 4 times in his first batting practice with the team!  (Clearly showing he's a terrible hitter, because of course top hitters get a home run 100% of the time).",1370476800,5,742,4.146853146853147

5306817,2,B009AMAK54,"""Trouble With the Curve"" is yet another Clint Eastwood movie in which he is once again the cantankerous, old isolated man fighting against the odds. This time, his character is the symbolic representation of the dated, but perhaps purer, world of baseball before the computer analysts arrived with their statistical analyses of a game that the movie argues, both metaphorically and literally, should be assessed by those who have a more indefinable human approach.  It is therefore an undisguised attack on ""Moneyball."" But this challenge is filled with more bluster than substance. In its unsophisticated, transparent attempts to make the audience smile, "" . . .  the Curve"" lacks depth, development and realism.

Eastwood plays Gus Lobel, a veteran Atlanta Braves baseball scout whose traditional methods are not only questioned by a few of the upstart, obnoxious members in the front office- especially ambitious executive Phillip Sanderson (Matthew Lillard)- but whose eyesight is failing as well. (Ah, but he is still able to detect the ability of a hitter by the sound of his swing!!!) To help Gus defeat the villains who want him fired, Pete Klein (John Goodman), his best friend and immediate superior, tries to convince Gus's estranged daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) to lend a hand.  Waging a battle of her own combating the weary jabs of the chauvinist pigs at the all-male law office where she's been working to make partner, Mickey reluctantly pledges to look in on her father for a short time; but when she's then taken off an important case she abruptly decides to quit the firm in favor of becoming his full-time assistant.  Their subsequent rapprochement is aided by Johnny Flanagan (Dustin Timberlake), a former promising pitcher originally scouted and signed by Gus, who is now a rival scout for the Boston Red Sox.  Johnny runs into the pair when they're all in North Carolina to check out a young batting phenom, Bo Gentry.  What then occurs is so evident that I needn't tell you how the story turns out.

This over-simplified morality tale is distasteful enough (the only thing missing is black and white hats to tell the good guys from the bad), but becomes all the more objectionable in the scenes which focus on baseball itself.  Indeed, in its ostensible effort to defend the game's honored traditions, the film commits repeated, blatant blunders, revealing a fundamental ignorance and misunderstanding of the game that even a casual fan will notice.

The script didn't give Amy Adams much to work with, but she's easily the best thing in the movie, demonstrating once again that she is an actor of great talent and versatility.  Goodman does what we now have come to expect, a journeyman-like job in his supporting role; and for his part, Justin Timberlake does not embarrass himself. How often, however, will Eastwood continue to play the same tired character? We've seen this old grouch with the heart of gold in ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Gran Torino."" He doesn't even have to read the screenplay - just show up and ad lib. Regrettably, that's what it appears he did here, and his work falls far short of what we witnessed in those other two superior efforts.

Maudlin, clichd, predictable and, not incidentally,  LOADED with stereotypes, ""Trouble with the Curve"" is neither a good baseball movie nor a decent film of any kind.  Allow this bad pitch to go by.",1370304000,4,3385,4.947089947089947
5306818,3,B009AMAK54,"I had wanted to see this movie when it was out in theaters but I missed it there.  Strike one.
I thought this would make a good date movie for me and my wife when it hit the second-ran theater but I still missed it.  Strike two.
I was at a friends and saw he had it on DVD and his family liked the flick and let me borrow it (freebie).  Swing and connected!
Watching at liesure soon after with my wife within the first 20"" of this cinematic game I knew exactly how it was going to play out and I was grateful that I hadn't wasted any moolah on it.  Out at first!

This film is pretty pedestrian; it goes by the numbers.  You have the story of a revered but aging out of the game scout (played by Clint Eastwood, all gruff and no substance) who is suffering an eye malady and who is never in the office to battle the young statistic crunchers who want to push him out of his job.  You have the story of his daughter (played by Amy Adams doing her best to raise the emotinal bar of this film but generally failing), physically and emotionally abandoned by her father, but still loyal to him and with a driving internal ache to still be daddy's little girl.  You have the romantic love interest (played by Justin Timberlake who isn't given much to do and does alright) who has a strong tie to the daughter's father and who could be easily manipulated to give them what they want...

Okay I tried not to spoil anything but if you can't see where this is all going then maybe you'll dig on this movie like some other people have.  What was worse for me than the simple see-the-pitch coming storyline was how utterly one-note all of these characters were (and the ball player making a name for himself with his bat was simply the worst; it's as if the movie was sticking in a cue card that read ""DON'T LIKE THIS GUY, AUDIENCE!  HE'S A JERKWAD!"").  The performances (excepting John Goodman who offered empathy and vulnerability) were either dull (Adams), wooden (Eastwood, I know he was going for gruff but that was ridiculous), or stiff (all of the extras; and I mean all of them).  It makes me wonder if director Robert Lorenz knows what an emotion is outside of a high school play (yeah, yeah, I know I shouldn't knock high school plays...).

Trouble With The Curve has trouble of its own finding nuanced emotional beats and avoiding heavy foreshadowing.  I can't help but believe that otherwise good actors were hampered by a faulty script and directing.  It turned out to be like watching a boring baseball game where nothing ever really gets going, absent a pitcher's duel.  Watchable I suppose, but just barely.  2.5 stars.",1370217600,,2623,4.406639004149378

To be honest, I'm surprised he associated himself with this project at all. As a big fan of Eastwood and Adams, I expected a lot. Add Goodman and Timberlake, and on paper you would think it couldn't miss. It did. I'm making it sound worse than it is, because I actually DID like the film!  I just didn't love it - and seriously - it could have easily been so much better. Some strong performances, and a very good story were marred by a sappy ending that will insult your intelligence. Obviously, I'm not going to ruin it here, but Eastwood should be ashamed that the finished product was not rewritten and shot over. It felt to me like a junior high school girl was given a decent screenplay and asked to write an ending. It's that juvenile. So if you're asking me if you'll enjoy this movie, I'd have to say probably yes - for the first 100 minutes.  After that, don't say I didn't warn you.",1368057600,,1035,4.329896907216495

It was very easy for me to relate to their relationship. Eastwood and Amy Adams did a great job presenting a dad who wanted the best for his daughter and in so doing neglected her as she grew up. She responded by becoming a high achieving lawyer so she could be accepted and loved by her dad.

The awkwardness of an elderly dad, unable to demonstrate how much he loves his daughter, and yet so whats too. A daughter who just wants to be loved by her dad. And then there is baseball.

He, the talent scout who instinctively sizes up quality targets, and she who has unbeknownst to both of them developed the same attribute due to the many hours they've spent together watching the game.

Justin Timberlake does a good job too. He's definitely improving as an actor.

Amy was clearly nervous in this role and might have been a miscast, but I like her and I still liked it. Justin was very natural on screen and did not work to hard at it - as a support character. Clint was Clint right down to the bar fight, I laughed pretty hard at that. It was a frustrated with Father-want his approval formula movie...Finding Nemo was better. But it was worth the cost to rent it.

5307145,4,B009AMAK54,"I got the opportunity to view TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE on two separate flights.  My goodness, is film legend Clint Eastwood making a memorable ride into the sunset (arguing with an empty chair notwithstanding), not only as a gifted director/producer, but as a squinting, raspy-voiced actor.  You can't help but like him, which is why I so enjoyed TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE.  Here Eastwood plays aging Atlanta Braves baseball scout Gus--a seasoned veteran who avoids statistics and numbers to evaluate talent. Gus relies on the old eyeball test; trouble is, the old eyeballs are failing him.  And Gus has to deal with a Braves front office just itching to get rid of him, led by director of scouting operations Phillip (Matthew Lillard).  Yet also residing in the front office is Gus's good friend and ally Pete (John Goodman just keeps getting better and better).  With Gus en route to scout the most sought-after player in the country, a concerned Pete contacts Gus's estranged daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), a busy lawyer on the fast track to make partner in her firm.  Yet Mickey takes a leave of absence to accompany her father; their reunion is bittersweet, to say the least.

Over the course of Gus and Mickey's journey, they encounter Johnny (Justin Timberlake), a former ballplayer and current Red Sox scout with broadcast aspirations.  Gus had once signed Johnny, so they're competitors on friendly terms, and Johnny is romantically attracted to an (initially) indifferent Mickey from the start.  So as the trio scouts the decided diva slugger named Bo (Joe Massingill makes this brat truly unlikable), who, as Gus insists to his superiors, has ""trouble with the curve,"" Gus and Mickey reconnect, Mickey and Johnny also connect, and, in the unlikeliest of places, Mickey discovers an amazing pitching talent who ultimately gives both Phillip and Bo their long overdue comeuppances.  Like Eastwood himself, the film occasionally feels a little long in the tooth, and meanders and flows a tad unevenly before recovering to deliver its predictable feel-good ending.  Yet these slight irritations take little away from TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE'S tender portrayal of a father and daughter finally getting acquainted after decades of estrangement.  It's a solid double, right up the middle.

5307146,5,B009AMAK54,This movie is just great fun for the whole family.  The actors are amazing.  It is one of those movies you want to see more than once.,1364428800,,134,3.925925925925926
5307167,5,B009AMAK54,I rated this movie a Five Star because it is very entertaining and very well produced.  The movie holds your interest from the beginning to the finish.

5307168,5,B009AMAK54,"After ""Gran Torino"" I didn't think Clint Eastwood was going to star in another film.  I had heard he was going to just direct films from now on.  I had seen trailers for this film and thought it would be just so-so.  NOT SO! This is a most enjoyable movie!  Amy Adams was just wonderful in the role of Clint's estranged daughter and Justin Timberlake was surprisingly good as the washed-out baseball player turned scout who becomes the love interest for a disinterested Amy Adams (at first).  Clint Eastwood is also wonderful as the aging baseball scout who is losing his eyesight and is reluctant to admit he's not able to do his job anymore.  I enjoyed watching Clint and Amy's characters gravitate around each other and eventually find a way to reconcile through the game of baseball.  This movie is a joy to see and I particularly liked how the pompous young ball player who is so highly touted for his ability to hit a baseball in one arena and then has ""Trouble with the Curve"" in another.",1364428800,,995,4.5251396648044695
5307169,5,B009AMAK54,"I'm a baseball fan.  I'm a Clint Eastwood fan.  So it follows I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

Clint is a baseball scout in this movie who is near the end of his contract.

The owner of the team is concerned about Clint's ability to continue scouting because of his age.  He has a critic, in the team's front office, that claims Clint can't do a good job because he doesn't know modern methods of scouting like using computers and statistics to verify a player's potential value to the team. He also has a front office supporter, played by John Goodman, that reminds the owner of the all-star players and MVPs that Clint has found for the team.  The owner isn't sure what is his best option.  Goodman takes responsibility for sending Eastwood to scout baseball's hottest prospect.

John visits Clint to fill him in on what's at stake and observes that Clint is having problems with his sight (macular degeneration)and a rather foul attitude in general. John becomes concerned about Clint's trip to scout the nation's hottest baseball prospect.  Back in the office John calls Clint's daughter, who is a lawyer and estranged from Clint.  He tells her that he believes it would be good for her to join Clint on the trip.

She says no.  She won't do it.  However certain events cause her to change her mind and she goes.

The movie has several subplots.  Clint and the daughter reestablishing their relationship.  The daughter and a young rival baseball scout falling in love.  Clint recognizing that the hot power-hitting prospect has ""trouble with the curve"".  The daughter discovering a pitching prospect that no other team was scouting.

I rated the movie five stars because it is a feel good movie and Clint's antics are great comedy.

The movie's premise that no other team's scouts would not be aware that a certain power hitter couldn't hit a breaking ball except this one crusty old scout is I think not realistic.  That fact doesn't keep the movie from fully enjoyable.",1364342400,2,1976,4.752941176470588

5307173,5,B009AMAK54,Another great Eastwood movie. Very intertaining from start to ending. Supporting cast also did excellent work as well. The story is very believeable if you are a baseball fan!,1364169600,,175,5.068965517241379
5307174,5,B009AMAK54,I wasn't sure what to expect from this film but since I like Clint Eastwood so much I decided I couldn't lose. It was tender and uplifting in Mr. Eastwood own way. I would recommend it,1364169600,,184,4.138888888888889
5307175,4,B009AMAK54,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this film, but I must say that I genuinely enjoyed it.  There is some nice character development, a killer performance by Amy Adams and some nicely toned dialog that keeps the film freely moving, even in parts that could otherwise drag.  I will say; it does feel long.  By the time the draft picks are made I really thought the film would be over, but it wasn't.  That being said, it's an enjoyable film with some heart.

Eastwood does Eastwood well and Timberlake continues to prove himself the next Matthew McConaughey (you know, charisma without the ability to do something special with a performance), but Adams is the real reason to see this.  I have never considered her a true leading lady, but she knocked this one out of the park with a genuinely heartfelt turn as an ambitious lawyer concerned with the welfare of her aging father.  Gus is a scout for the Braves, but his stubborn demeanor and seeming lack of success have his superiors questioning his relevance.  He's sent to tail a prospective #1 pick, but his failing eyesight is a concern and his daughter Mickey gets roped into tagging along to help him out.  While on the road they both strike up a friendship with a scout for the Red Sox and they begin to find out things about themselves they've been shielding for a long time.

I'll say that there are some very predictable turns of events here, and there are also some segments that make no sense (especially the film's resolve) but at the end of the day it was charming and had nice flow and Adams really makes up for a lot of the film's faults.  As a friend of mine was quoting saying soon after he saw this; I ain't got no problem with those curves.",1364169600,,1707,4.456591639871383
5307176,3,B009AMAK54,"Let's start by stating that Justin Timberlake steals the show in this film.  Amy Adams is pretty good too, but Clint?, Somewhat painful to watch.  I always loved the old Clint Eastwood westerns and chafed when people said he was a bad actor.  Then he directs a string of great films in which he doesn't act.  I was proud for him.  He should go back to that.  In this film, he just growls and is ornery, in essence, the exact same character as in Gran Torino.  Time to retire from acting.",1364169600,,487,4.285714285714286

5307248,4,B009AMAK54,"I'm not a fan of sports movies but I do like Eastwood so I watched this movie.  It's more of a father/daughter movie with a sports background.  Some of it was uncomfortable to watch because I can identify with a man that can't do simple things, like getting a car into or out of a garage, as well as he once could but is still as good as ever at others.",1363478400,,353,3.9577464788732395

I found the movie easy to watch, with a few emotional up-down, back-forth trips. If you're not a baseball fan, it's probably a 3 star movie.",1363219200,,372,4.04054054054054

5307282,5,B009AMAK54,"As an aging American myself, I was delighted to see age played with a 360 degree view.  Yes, there are failing body parts but also there is a measurable wisdom that the years do indeed bring.  Amy Adams did a nice job of playing the offended-but-responsible daughter.  Clint Eastwood's gravelly-voice and irasible manner may have been ""done to death"" as his schtick, but it was right on the money for this part.",1363046400,,411,4.680555555555555
5307283,5,B009AMAK54,"This movie already had three things going for it before I ever saw it; Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Amy Adams. The story takes you through just about every human emotion from beginning to end, and it's wonderful. A tortured lonely childhood causes a rift between a daughter and her father, mainly because the daughter, Adams, doesn't understand why her father, Easr\twood, sent her away. It is a wonder and heartwarming movie.",1363046400,,432,5.013888888888889

5307310,2,B009AMAK54,"""Trouble with the Curve"" is formulaic, predictable, long, and as outdated as its anti-sabermetric and anti-moneyball message.  (While the baseball argument remains unsettled, ""Moneyball"" is a far better film, so that much is clear.)  Beyond that, the movie wastes decent actors like Amy Adams and the legendary Clint Eastwood, who just plays the latest in his recent long line of ""old curmudgeon"" roles, and much more lifelessly than his great work in ""Gran Torino,"" for example.",1362873600,,479,5.2894736842105265

I honestly believe he has become better with age and seeing him in movies like 'Trouble With The Curve' and 'Gran Torino' I feel we get to see more of HIM in the movies.

This is a heartwarming tale of a father and daughter working their way back to each other after having grown apart.  Oh, and a little baseball scouting is in it too.  : )",1362787200,,459,4.123595505617978

Even though im not a baseball fan,  the personal relationships that dominate the movie help over shadow all the baseball references that are mentioned in the movie.

This is a terrific story of a father and daughter, once estranged, who reconnect through a mutual love of baseball.  They realize how much they love one another as the father (played by Eastwood) begins losing his eyesight) and his daughter, and attorney, helps him as he scouts prospects for the Atlanta Braves.  She proves herself every bit as good a baseball scout as her father when she discovers a young pitching prospect.  Justin Timberlake is excellent as an opposing scout who falls in love with Eastwood's daughter.

5307332,5,B009AMAK54,"Yes, you read that right!

Amy Adams and Clint Eastwood just work so well together.  Throw in Justin Timberlake and you have a really good movie.  Clint is getting old but still extremely effective as an actor.

(spoiler alert)Most the movie was realistic, (spoiler alert) the only part I would have changed (spoiler alert).......was his daughter discovering a pro level picture.",1362355200,,393,4.794117647058823

Amy Adams plays the estrainged daughter that takes a break from her high-powered legal life to check on her father.  Justing Timberlake is an up-and-coming scout for another team also scouting the same kid.

Mix the three together and you have a wonderful fun story about aging, love and baseball - what else could you ask for?",1362355200,,455,4.7215189873417724

5307381,4,B009AMAK54,"I enjoyed this movie. It kept my attention and Clint was funny with his one liners and general grumpy disposition. The reason for not giving it 5 stars is: the hitter that Clint advises against saying he can't hit a curve apparently drops his hands. That's a minor mechanical adjustment, nothing a hitting coach couldn't fix. It wouldn't stop any MLB team from taking him as a top prospect much less cause anyone to get fired.
So overall enjoyable but unrealistic and a little predictable, but is worth watching.......enjoy!",1362355200,,524,4.898876404494382

5307416,4,B009AMAK54,"Trouble With The Curve isn't the most catchy title for a film, but being an Eastwood fan (as well as baseball fan), I decided to check it out. With a solid  cast (Amy Adams, Eastwood, Timberlake) this movie showed promise early on. Eastwood plays an aging baseball scout whose vision is deteriorating, and in the end, despite not being able to see players' mechanics clearly, he manages to use his wisdom, experience and 'hearing' to still be the best scout in the business. His daughter is an attorney who's so caught up in her work, that she forgot how to 'live'. A strained lifelong relationship with her father comes to a head when she accompanies him on a scouting trip to North Carolina. There, they clash, until her father finally tells her the reason why he wasn't in her life for many years. With his visual impairment affecting his evaluation of players, she takes over and ultimately finds a true gem of a pitcher who easily strikes out baseball's top prospect, with (you guessed it) the curve ball. It was this prospect that Eastwood said wasn't good enough for the Braves to draft, because he couldn't hit the curve, but they did so anyway. This movie has a nice touch to it, and carries a message of forgiveness and love. Recommended.",1362268800,,1248,4.647058823529412

Timberlake cannot act to save his life. Their relationship (w/ Adams) was bland and extremely predictable, eventually ending in sex--what else???

However--enter Amy Adams!! Amy is sweetly stunning as Eastwood's daughter who just wants loving acceptance from her steely father. Adams plays the twisted feelings of loving/hating her dad, wanting to have nothing to do with him and yet that natural, deep desire to be close to him! Adams' performance isn't dazzling nor striking--but sadly the director nor script require her to perform that way. Very disappointing. Maybe the easy-going script attracted this very talented, multi-Academy Award nominated actress.

For me--the movie has NO substance worth seeing unless, like me, you adore the work of Amy Adams! The ending is very satisfying because how her character ties in. Easily the BEST part of the movie--as endings should be!",1362096000,,1081,5.273255813953488

It has it's very awkward spots; it has it's almost romantic comedy moments; and more often then not, a very real look at the great Clint Eastwood who is most certainly no spring chicken anymore playing into the overtly rough and tumble character he usually plays, just minus the smoothness to it or the varsity it usually carries in his performance.

I would watch it again. I would even buy it and put it on my DVD shelf. Would I watch it often? No. This is a once in a very great while kinda watch; however, well worth a one time look for a one time rental.

Clint plays his typical curmudgeon and Amy Adams is a delight as a daughter trying to develop a last minute relationship with the old man before he shuffles off this mortal coil.  Adams has really developed into a wonderful actress of surprising depth and complexity. I will see almost anything she does.  However, someday someone is going to explain to me what the virtue in promoting Justin Timberlake because... I really don't get it.  Marginal looks, marginal talent. There are so many talented and deserving young actors out there ya gotta wonder why this guy gets so much opportunity. But whatever -  he manages to walk through this film without injuring anyone.  But his contribution is - wait for it... strictly marginal.

I like how the movie showed the true struggles of older people and their adjustment to getting older and developing health problems. I also like how it showed a true bond between a Father and Daughter is even though they did not always feel or relate to that bond. It still was always there.",1361145600,,415,4.402597402597403

Showed the dynamics of business, family, and of an aging father/daughter relationship, both sides to what they were going through, and had gone through.  Great movie that the family enjoyed.",1361059200,,410,5.119402985074627

5307657,3,B009AMAK54,"I love Clint Eastwood, I love baseball, I even like Justin Timberlake in the films he's been in. But, I have to be honest, this was a rough watch. Very predictable, everything had a pretty little bow on it at the end of the movie. Bad guy fired, arrogant kid struck out by gifted son of a hotel employee,arrogant lawyer bosses regretting not making Amy Adams character a partner. This is what Hollywood is giving us and we eat it up. Justin Timberlake's scene where he pulls over and announces some random kids playing ball in a field. Seriously what the heck was that all about? I'm just as guilty as anybody, I rented it this against my better judgement.

It's not the worst movie, it's a date night movie I guess. Nothing too controversial happens,one of the softest PG-13 movies I've seen in a while. Amy Adams in no Meryl Streep, but she's not the worst. This is really a 2-star affair, but Clint Eastwood and John Goodman get the extra star, even if Clint is the same exact character he was in Gran Torino.",1360800000,,1012,4.440860215053763

5307659,5,B009AMAK54,"Baseball, romance and a grumbling, gruff old Clint Eastwood. What more could you ask for in a movie? This is a pic with an outfield piled high with appeal. The characters are so nicely defined that you're almost instantly drawn to them. The story of a dad and daughter's tug-and-pull relationship full of communication hurdles, painful loss, pride, past protectiveness, love and emotional distanceis well-written and wonderfully acted.

5307687,5,B009AMAK54,"A true life relationship displayed out well by both! I agree she is better as a scout than an another Dumb A** Attorney.

5307695,3,B009AMAK54,"Trouble With The Curve felt like a movie that was constantly trying to find its groove.  Clint Eastwood's character is so surly and changes so little throughout the majority of the movie that he is difficult to like, which is bad for the character who spends the most time onscreen.  It's almost as if they took his character from Gran Torino and placed him in a baseball movie, except that his character in Gran Torino changed more.

The biggest fault with this movie is the way it was advertised.  It was made to feel like a warm story of a father and daughter reconnecting over their love of baseball after drifting apart for many years.  Rather, it was darker than I anticipated, and less enjoyable.  That's not to say it wasn't a good story, more that it wasn't told in a way I found enjoyable.",1360627200,,799,4.475862068965517

5307743,4,B009AMAK54,I like Eastwood since he has done some good movies with a moral outcome.  This is a kind of unknown movie about baseball.  I liked the Money Ball and the Natural so I had to see this.  It was good.  Good characters and a decent story with a good ending.

Clint is a scout for the Atlanta Braves and is the best in baseball. His problem is, he is losing his vision and age appears to have caught up with him.

Amy Adams stars with Clint in this movie and plays his estranged daughter. He is in the process of being phased out by computers and hot shot scouts who really know little about baseball except how to find statistics on a computer. Clint does a brilliant job and Amy Adams is well worth watching. Its another baseball movie that is not really about baseball. Eastwood may be in his 80s now but he still knows how to make a great movie. Well worth watching",1360195200,,821,4.290322580645161

It was a movie that had its slow points in the middle but it developed the relationship between a father and  daughter. It really showed the strength that a daughter can count on her advise from a father on what it takes to pick up on what it means to hit a curve ball. I was glad to see Justin Timberlake and Amy Adams get together .....The other movie in which Eastwood should have been Nominated for an Acadmy award is Gran Torino.,1360022400,,521,4.107843137254902

5307861,5,B009AMAK54,"I was told that I had to be a baseball fan to grasp the fine details of this film, but after watching it I learned that that was not the case.

While our main character played fantastically by Clint Eastwood is a baseball scout, the story revolves more around his relationship with his daughter, played achingly well by Amy Adams, after the loss of Eastwood's wife in the film.

It is about the choices we make so that the ones we love most will have the best chance at success based upon our point of view at the time those choices are made.

*spoiler alert* After a near miss with a child predator when Eastwood's daughter is very young and on the road with him while he's scouting the next great thing in baseball, Eastwood decides that it is better for his daughter to go live with her aunt and uncle, giving her stability and security.  The problem is that he never explained that to his daughter, he just left her with the aunt and uncle and headed out onto the road, thinking that somehow she'd come to magically understand why he had done what he'd done.

Think about it for a minute.  How many times in our lives do we look back on the choices and actions of our parents and think to ourselves, WTF?  How could they have possibly done what they did if they'd had a clue?  However, life doesn't come with a hindsight manual that allows us a glimpse of the future to see how our choices will pan our for ourselves and our loved ones.

That's what makes this story so meaningful. Regardless of what profession a parent is in, especially when they have lost their partner in life and the other parent to their children, every single choice and decision that the remaining parent makes becomes proportionately more important.  That kind of pressure and the desire to do the right thing can sometimes result in choices that the children wished their parents had never made, and that is what we see play out in this movie.

Surprisingly enough, Justin Timberlake delivers a very funny and heartfelt performance as the love interest for Adams and the quasi-protege to Eastwood and his character acts as a bridge between the two in the film.

Clint Eastwood is a phenomenal actor, delivering powerful performances time and again, and this movie is no different.  The ensemble cast is crisp and clean and John Goodman provides a great performance in the role of longtime friend and co-worker of Eastwood's character.

This was a truly enjoyable movie from start to finish and I couldn't recommend it more highly.  If you want good story telling and a well crafted film, you'll find it here, and with the feel good twists and turns that some might call a bit predictable, it provides a very satisfying ending to the film.

Mickey, named after guess who? has been shuttled off to relatives while her dad,Gus, has pursued a career as a baseball scout.  There's the usual resentment brewing underneath and it all comes to a head when Mickey is pursuaded by her dad's boss to accompany her father who is losing his sight to games and help pick players for the big leagues.  There's some romance in the mix as well with Justin Timberlake playing Johnny an ex pitcher, now scout who looks up to Gus as his mentor.

There were so many different ways they could have gone with this movie, but this ending was the best one I have seen in a while. There was no what I like to call many exciting parts with music that bumped, but it wasn't boring either. It was intriguing.

When I first heard of this movie on a commercial, I thought it would have been more of a comedy with the few funny clips. Now I haven't watched this movie in the theaters at all and that made me a bit disappointed. It made me even more just after I watched it. It was a great movie. I love the fact that there was actual footage of the balls movement. You were able to tell if the pitch was a breaking ball, change-up, or fastball. I really love the fact that they got all of the ball moving from the pitchers hand to the catchers glove without losing sight of the ball. As a baseball player, this is good graphics.

5307915,4,B009AMAK54,"This movie moves swiftly but has a few wise messages for viewers of all ages if they pay attention.

The  main message here is that, you might be older, you might feel older- but that doesn't mean you still don't have something to offer the world.

In this story, Eastwood is angry. Even on a good day, he is angry.

While he has always been an angry sort of guy,  now he is angry because he is noticing the signs of aging that he fears could hold him back or cost him, his beloved career as a baseball talent scout.

He might have physical problems- but he is still mentally sharp and for the most part, a mobile man- as long as you don't give him a car to drive. :-)

Eastwood's ""Damn it all"" attitude, is all about not giving in to things that slow you down or prove to be an obstacle.

 Despite his looming health issues, he won't hang up his cap just yet!

You find yourself rooting for him and admiring his pride, while feeling his embarrassment just as equally, when he uses tactics( some successfully- some not so successfully) to cover up his physical deficits.

In fact, in defiance( and some would say stupidity) he opts to ignore his problems and blow off further medical assistance( at least, perhaps, for the time being ) in order to go scout the latest and greatest out there.

He has to see just how authentic these hyped up school baseball players supposedly are- not just because it is in his blood- but because his career is also in jeopardy.

And he has to ABSOLUTELY GET THE NEXT DRAFT PICK, RIGHT. He can't afford to make a mistake, especially now.

This is a man whose identity is very wrapped up in his career.

If forced to retire when his contract runs out in 3 months- you might as well just kill the guy.

 He lives, eats, breathes and sleeps baseball.

There may be other things he can do- but he wants to remain  a talent scout.

The idea of retirement sends a fury through him, so this particular venture of scouting out the players, just 3 months before he could be forced into retirement, proves to be so extra serious for him.

It is an understatement to say,the week of scouting proves to be very intense as Eastwood tries incredibly hard not to drop the proverbial ball.

His daughter is played by Amy Adams.

 She gets wind of his problems thanks to her father's friend( played by John Goodman) and despite her own promising career in a law office, and with the strong chance at partnership on the horizon, she decides to leave everything at work to intervene and attempt to help her Dad out.

This means she takes off from her job at a critical time, a time when a major legal case hangs in the balance, as well as the pending decision on whether she makes the cut  as  a firm partner.

Eastwood has no idea of the sacrifice his daughter has made.

 All he knows is he doesn't want her hanging around.

It is not long before he gets a revelation he is forced to accept:he comes to realize, much to his chagrin, he really does need her around.

Their relationship has long been troubled and very complex.

Despite having a grumpy man for a Dad, a man who seems to disdain meaningful conversation, Adams has compassion for him and his plight.  She makes the decision to tag along with Eastwood for  the week, to check out the talent with him.

 She frequently calls into work to make sure they realize that while she has to take this week break, she is very serious about her job, the pending legal case and her partnership.

She has worked there many years, putting in long hours, to make her mark, she is not about to give it up so easily.

Her office is not happy she is gone.

 The veiled threats start to happen. Adams tries to appease them, saying when she gets back, she will have things on track.

Yet, despite knowing what she might lose, the priority of her job( and chance at partner) is superseded by her need to help her Dad.

 Or perhaps, deep in her heart,she knows it is more than compassion- but love that is making her stay with him-  despite his his cantankerous behavior and personality quirks.

Though the phone calls begin to allude her place in the company is shifting on her, she still makes the decision to stay with Eastwood and not yet return to work. This despite her bosses gentle, yet  pressing request to come back to work a.s.a.p.

So you have Eastwood, pissed off about her coming along, clueless as to what his daughter might be putting in jeopardy FOR HIM; while she feels a deep sense of obligation to Eastwood, even though her father has failed her in  many ways, growing up.

And so the story unfolds: a man desperately trying to hold on to his career, resisting the truth about his health issues, pissed off about getting older, and feeling both resentful -outwardly- and loving and proud-inwardly- toward his adult daughter.

They may be blood related but in so many ways they are total strangers to one another.

The movie covers the week the two are off on this journey of scouting.

 But it covers more than just baseball, even though that is the obvious theme of the movie.

Justin Timberlake is a key character in the movie as well, but rather than explain his role, I will just say that he is a part of Eastwood's past and could possibly be a part of Adams future- if she ever decides to break down the emotional barriers she has erected over the years.

Barriers meant to keep from feeling rejected and unloved, as she often felt from her father growing up and into adulthood.
It is a fast paced movie and I enjoyed it.

While based on baseball, there are other themes going on in the movie,  so everyone can watch this and appreciate it, even if they know nothing about baseball.

Side note of trivia: Adams has an attorney boyfriend she is seeing.
He is seen briefly, but he is played by Mariska Hargitay's real life husband.",1359504000,,5810,4.41110065851364

5307978,3,B009AMAK54,"Clint Eastwood resurrects his grouchy character from ""Gran Torino,"" this time as an aging scout for the Atlanta Braves.  As his contract is up for renewal, he faces the usual effects of getting older, but his deteriorating vision could jeopardize his career.

In a by-the-numbers story, Gus (Eastwood) has a successful daughter (Amy Adams) who is on the cusp of making partner in a high profile law firm.  Gus and Mickey's (Adams) relationship is strained to say the least.  Mickey's mom died when she was about 6 so dad was responsible for her care.  Rather than spend time with her, he pawned her off on relatives most of the time.  We keep waiting for the real reason which eventually comes with a thud.

Gus is sent to North Carolina to scout a highly prized slugger in high school.  When Mickey learns of her dad's eyesight problem, she meets him.  He's not happy of course, grumbling all the while.  Why?  It is here Justin Timberlake is introduced as a former protg of Gus who blew out his arm.  He's now a scout for the Red Sox as well as a potential love interest for Mickey and some comic relief.  This movie signals where it's going more often than a third base coach.

It also adds the traditional Hollywood treatment of secondary characters.  The high school star is a real dick; cocky, arrogant and just unlikeable.  So we are set up for movie revenge.  Likewise, Gus has to deal with an assertive executive (Matthew Lillard) who wants Gus out of the organization.  He's also portrayed as a real jerk, just so we can smile when he gets his due.

This movie is certainly the other side of 2011's ""Moneyball"" where technology and statistics are the winning formula.  ""Trouble with the Curve's"" plot line relies on Gus's ability to calculate a player's potential by the sound of the bat.  I'll take ""Moneyball"" both as a movie and a strategy to find good players.

Well, there is certainly no trouble with the Blu ray transfer.  Delivered in 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio, the picture is clear and crisp.  Every Eastwood wrinkle is there.  The colors are excellent as are the black levels.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option is likewise excellent.  Nothing in particular stands out, but the crowd ambiance and the dialog are clear.

The HD cost was $1.00 less than ordering it from Verizon On Demand, but at least when you order an HD movie from them, you get an HD movie.  I would have happily paid the extra $1.00 to watch in HD.",1359331200,3,540,4.104761904761904
5308012,3,B009AMAK54,Poor Clint has lost it. His acting in this film is nothing short of awful.  They plot is predictable and over done.,1359331200,,115,4.2272727272727275
5308013,2,B009AMAK54,"Clint Eastwood: Great as ever.
Amy Adams: She played her part fine, but left me wanting a bit more.
Justin Timberlake: Like the guy and his character is likable as well, but feels miscast.
John Goodman: Gives a strong supporting role performance.

I liked the concept of the movie, but it felt very formulaic. You'll likely be able to figure out very quickly where the movie is headed, which is fine, but the execution feels clumsy.",1359331200,,432,4.684210526315789

5308034,5,B009AMAK54,"Loved this movie.  Another great baseball ""behind the scenes"" take and Clint Eastwood is ideal for the part.  This movie was a good counter to ""Moneyball"".  I recommend it even for casual fans of baseball.  It's a look inside the scouting process and the subplot speaks to the fact that you're happiest when your doing something you love.",1359244800,,338,4.775862068965517
5308035,3,B009AMAK54,Eastwood has been one of my favorite actors over the years. He may want to stick to directing rather than acting. The movie is entaining but not among his best.,1359244800,,160,4.366666666666666
5308056,4,B009AMAK54,Enjoyed the movie.  Eastwood plays similar rolls in many of his later movies.  Gruff at first but mellow out when the movie gets going.,1359244800,,135,4.583333333333333
5308057,4,B009AMAK54,"Other than expecting Clint to pull out a .44 Mag, cause he was talking like Harry Callahan, a good movie. Slow to start, but it pulls you in.",1359244800,,141,4.071428571428571

5308061,3,B009AMAK54,"I rate three stars because watching Eastwood is always an experience.  The movie is best at relating the tension between father and daughter working through the struggles and issues that life, family, experience and relationship often bring.  The theme and backdrop of baseball is great, but it lacks depth and breadth in developing the theme.  But it was still enjoyable, with good characters and interesting insights into baseball.  I'd recommend it but it might let you down a bit.",1359158400,,484,5.0886075949367084
5308062,3,B009AMAK54,Typical late era Eastwood. Slow moving but always seems to have a payoff at the end. Casting could have been better.,1359158400,,116,4.571428571428571
5308063,4,B009AMAK54,We were not able to watch the movie via amazon video. The movie would play for a few minutes and then we had technical problems. This happended multiple times before we gave up. There was no way to request technical help. Ultimately we gave up and watched via time warner cable on-demand service.,1359158400,,296,4.60377358490566

5308065,4,B009AMAK54,Like the relationship part of the movie more than the baseball part.  Reminded me of my aging father.  It was hard to see Clint getting old.,1359072000,,140,4.346153846153846
5308086,5,B009AMAK54,"Very good movie.  Clint Eastwood does a great job.  It was sad to see him geting older.  The movie had a good ending, but I am not going to ruin it, so buy the movie.",1359072000,,166,3.6857142857142855

5308126,3,B009AMAK54,"I liked this OK as a baseball movie. Eastwood was good. The biggest problem with the movie was the romance angle. It felt forced and fake like the producers said, ""Gee we got baseball, we got Eastwood, that will bring in the guys, but we need something to bring in the 18-34 year-old female demographic. I know lets throw in Justin Timberlake to give the daughter a love interest. Women love that kind of stuff. Never mind it doesn't really have much to do with the story, we'll throw it in anyway.""

5308128,4,B009AMAK54,"Not Eastwood's best, I'm thinking Grand Torino, but a light hearted romp. No movie could be bad with Amy Adams in it, and Justin Timberlake holds up well in this comedy.

5308147,5,B009AMAK54,"I just loved this movie, little did I know how hard baseball scouts work!  This is not a glamorous job.  Before I saw this movie I thought Scouting for pro baseball players was a day at the park and a night on the town.  It's a day at a hot, dusty, park with tasty yet unhealthy and limited items on the lunch or dinner menu,while trying to ""out scout"" your opponent scouts.  On the phone trying to reason with the GM or others to go after a kid . Clint Eastwood always at his finest, but was so convincing in this movie as a very skillful scout.  The scene in which a high schooler was a typical jackass demanding a bag of peanuts from a vendor, and expected the peanuts to be free because of this batter's self imposed ""status"".  The route taken for this peaut vendor to become a walk on pitcher at this tryout  is priceless.  I don't want to spoil the plot, but rest assured this is a great film,  with stellar actors.  Don't miss it.  Take your Little Leaguers so they can see what is expected of them after their tenure during their Little League years, it's good step in the right direction and a great movie that will show them the way!",1358899200,,1143,4.221198156682028

5308151,4,B009AMAK54,I liked this movie - I had read a number of reviews after purchasing it but before watching it which made me think it would be a disappointment but it was good.  My husband and I both watched from beginning to end without distraction.  Clint Eastwood still has it,1358899200,,263,4.346938775510204

5308188,5,B009AMAK54,Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams do a great job portraying a Father-Daughter that has twists and turns over the years. My wife and I watched the movie - both of us thought it was entertaining and had a great ending. Well worth renting.,1358812800,,231,4.395348837209302

I thought that Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake played a very good role. In this movie Clint Eastwood was a baseball scout and he was using his daughter (played by Amy Adams)to use her eyes for him. He had claimed that the batter was losing his grip on the ball and that's why he has trouble with the curve. He also said that's how he heard the ball. And the person that they get to pitch for the Atlanta Braves is the peanut guy. Who, the batter was making fun of.",1358726400,,639,4.161290322580645

This movie shows a very true-to-life idea of the conflict between the reality of the real people of baseball and the modern version of the ""successful"" business which too many people think is the way things should be run.
There is no substitute for 'the man on the ground' who knows the sights and sounds and smells of baseball. Baseball has become a game of numbers and statistics, but there is no better feeling than being in the park, watching the American Pasttime with someone you love and who loves the game as much as you.
Gus has lost sight of that and has to be re-introduced to the idea by his long-estranged daughter, Mickey.

It's not technically a baseball movie, so don't look for a lot of detail in that area, but it offers some excellent perspectives on relationships and priorities -- all done in a baseball setting.

It addresses the modern workforce idea that one should replace the old with the younger, newer and more shiny but, you know what, it's a poor philosophy because we are robbed of some of life's most experienced and valuable members of society. Why do I hear over and over ... if you are over 50 forget ever finding a decent job again. That is the CRAZIEST thing I have ever heard! Sure, I understand youth and modern ideas having some perks but wake up employers before it's too late!!!  The older, experienced, reliable workforce with ""older values"" are still going strong and want and need to be productive!",1358640000,,685,4.569105691056911

5308239,2,B009AMAK54,"The problem with this movie is that it is not very good. From the moment that the heavily recruited player shows himself to be a first class jerk and insults the kid who THROWS him a bag of peanuts you know exactly where this movie is heading.  The lines of plot are so clear and foreshadowed that the end can be predicted within the first 30 minutes.  The baseball talk is less sophisticated than that found in The Sandlot and overall is a third class effort.  Bull Durham had a lot of chick-flickiness as well but you could tell that it was written by someone who knew and loved baseball.  This movie is a weak backhand rebuttal to Moneyball and I have to admit, the minute I finished this movie, I had to watch a few scene selections from Moneyball to get the taste out of my mouth.  There are some sweet moments but  I am pretty sure that if the characters in the movie were to walk into this movie, they would snort and walk out.  Excellent baseball movies may be romantic but they are not allowed to be sentimental.",1358640000,2,1021,4.31413612565445

5308241,4,B009AMAK54,"Trouble with the Curve wasn't as heartwarming as Gran Torino, nor was it as good as some of Eastwood's other movies.  For Clint Eastwood, however, that isn't saying much.  I really enjoyed this one.  It's a great look at the game the way it was before sabermetrics came to rule the day, before the days of 28-year-old GMs and Wins Above Replacement.  Not that that stuff hasn't benefited baseball, but there's something romantic about the ability to look at a player and tell if he's able to hit certain pitches or if he can strike people out.  It's both reactionary and forward-thinking: reactionary because it hearkens back to an earlier age of scouting, forward-thinking because statistics can only use past performance as an indicator of the future.  The ability to change isn't something that can be gleaned from a box score or a pitch count breakdown.",1358553600,,857,4.835616438356165

5308299,3,B009AMAK54,I love Clint and Amy but they should have been grandfather and grand daughter not daughter and father. They don't seem to be able to decide if this is going to be a comedy or a drama. As it turns out is is neither and I still do not know wha t is is.,1358380800,,250,3.6481481481481484
5308300,2,B009AMAK54,"Trouble with the Curve stars Eastwood as Gus Lobel, an aging Atlanta Braves baseball scout that is sent to North Carolina to scout a first round prospect and possible future star of the organization.  The problem is Gus is losing his eye sight and can no longer visually see the game.  His friend and co-worker, Pete (John Goodman), asks Gus' daughter Mickey (Amy Adams), an ambitious lawyer trying to make partner, to accompany him on the trip.  Gus also reconnects with a failed prospect turned scout, Johnny (Justin Timberlake).

As far as the acting goes for this off-field drama, there's really no need to critique anything that Dirty Harry does on film, quite simply because he's earned the right to do whatever he wants.  If he wants to play a cranky old baseball scout that's losing his sight, he should indulge himself.  Amy Adams is easily the most enjoyable character to watch and masters the part to the best of her ability, but unfortunately she is thrust into a love story with Justin Timberlake, which feels out of place and unnecessary for this film.  That's not to say Timberlake is bad in the role (since he has surprisingly turned out to be a decent actor), but there are already too many other variables to deal with without a forced/rushed love story complicating an already slow-moving story - namely stress father/daughter relationship.

If you're a fan of sports films, it's highly doubtful that this will even come close to breaking your top twenty.  It is certainly no Moneyball, or even a Field of Dreams caliber experience.  It's more of a Sandlot type film that only uses baseball as a backdrop to further its predictable, lackluster plot.  Could this have been a football or basketball film?  Very easily.  The studio should be advised and encouraged to change the name of the film from Trouble with the Curve to Trouble with the Plot.  Just saying.

Overall, anyone that loves Clint Eastwood will want to check out this film.  He is still a master of his craft and it will be a sad day when he decides to call it quits on his long-lived acting career.  Let's hope he stays in the directors chair, though.  In any event, this film could have also been so much more to look at visually.  Instead, audiences are forced to look at a high school baseball stadium backdrop for the majority of the film, giving it the 'cheat seats' quality feeling.  For a film that had such high potential, it felt too busy and drawn out - not to mention sappy and bland.  Aside from the acting, it really did provide a high amount of disappointment.

5308302,4,B009AMAK54,"I got this movie as a Christmas present and just had a chance to watch it last night.  It was a good formula baseball/family relationship based movie.  The main characters played by Eastwood and Adams felt believable in their relationship with each other.

As for the rest of the movie it reminded me a lot of the movie ""Talent for the Game,"" with Edward James Olmos, an older aging scout, trying to find that last player before retiring or moving on.  In the case of ""Trouble with the Curve,"" instead of focusing just on the player they find it is more about the way scouting has changed for better or worse and sometimes the old ways of doing things work better.  I would recommend this movie for people who like Baseball movies however if you don't even like baseball it is still an enjoyable watch.",1358380800,,802,4.503448275862069

5308322,4,B009AMAK54,"I'm not much of a baseball fan but I enjoyed this picture immensely. One of the beauties of this film is how it crosses over baseball subculture with relationships of all types. Clint Eastwood plays a grumpy old timer baseball scout whose vision is going out and Amy Adams plays his lawyer-daughter trying to make partner (dependent on a big case) yet she gets called to assist her father's scouting because a friend (played by John Goodman) asks her to do it and she's scared for her father's health. Enter the standard work with your relationships from the old American perspective but the conflicts and layers are so much more.

As one might expect the father and daughter have a troublesome relationship that became scarred when the father ""abandoned"" her, sending her off to stay with an uncle and aunt. As a result the daughter has obvious intimacy issues and fear of abandonment which make her troublesome in any intimate relationship. The whole thematic focus as a result is about this relationship while baseball further symbolizes and layers the issue. Compare players who are not quite up to the Major Leagues because they have one serious issue holding them back much like people who cannot function in an intimate relationship.

Justin Timberlake plays the romantic interest to Amy Smart. He's a washed out pitcher who is trying to make a life as a baseball scout and stay in the game. Timberlake is one of the lead romantic male choices in the last few years and as expected he delivers. His lines and mannerisms are great for bringing down the walls of the Adams character.

Overall, I'd describe this as one of those slice of life family pictures about people you can like. Baseball fans will appreciate the details, too.

Also starring Robert Patrick as Eastwood's boss in the film.

Eastwood claimed he was retired from acting but the 82 year old actor liked the script enough to get in front of the camera again.

The budget for this film is not listed but it has made over $35M at the Box Office so far.

Otherwise, this movie was terrific.  We will change our 1 star rating if Amazon gives us a refund. I seem to have a difficult time finding anything related to getting refund.  Not happy about that. If this happens again we would consider not using this service until we were assured of satisfaction guaranteed.

I wouldn't normally say this, but, I can't think of a better way to say it simply. This is a feel good movie. Clint is as good as he's ever been and Amy Adams seemed to be a natural for her roll.

5308485,5,B009AMAK54,I am really intrigued to see Clint Eastwood still in the movies.  He did a real fine job as the dad.  But he sure had a lot to learn about being the best father to his daughter.  So often that happens in real life.  But it was good for the daughter to keep trying to make amends with him.  I truly enjoyed this movie.  Great story,1357862400,,330,3.9242424242424243

5308491,5,B009AMAK54,Another Clint Eastwood classic. An old timer baseball scout that knows stats don't mean everything. I would recommend this film to others.,1357862400,,138,5.318181818181818
5308492,4,B009AMAK54,"Can Clint Eastwood actually make a bad movie? I'm beginning to think it's impossible. I went back to check out the list of movies he's starred in over the past several decades and while I found one or two that weren't my taste and maybe one other that was just different I couldn't actually find one I would say was terrible. Remarkably at 82 his record remains intact with the new release TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE.

Here Eastwood plays Gus, a baseball scout for the Atlanta Braves. Gus is getting older and beginning to have problems with his eyesight, something he needs to do his job. The franchise is looking for smarter ways to decide who to sign and Gus is in competition with Phillip (Matthew Lillard) and his computer stats style of knowing which players to sign.

Running along side this story is that of Gus' daughter Mickey (Amy Adams), a top notch lawyer who is on the fast track to partnership. If Mickey can win the latest case she's in charge of then she's almost guaranteed a partnership at the firm. But things with Gus will find these two crossing paths that are not well traveled between father and daughter.

The two have issues with one another that stem back from years before. When Gus' friend Pete (John Goodman) begins to think Gus might have a problem, he calls on Mickey to help him out and to make sure Gus is all right. While Gus doesn't want this so called babysitter with him on his latest trip to scout out a hot prospect, Mickey goes anyway hoping that perhaps she can get some answers to the questions she's had most of her life about her father.

Eastwood's Gus is a cantankerous sort who is unwilling to admit that there is something wrong. He does have the occasional moment when he lets down his guard to his daughter but he's determined to be on his own and do things his way like he always has. Adam's Mickey is just as stubborn as her father and attempts to give him plenty of opportunities to open up but those moments don't seem to be happening. How they resolve these problems that have developed over years on a three day road trip makes for interesting viewing and touches the heart as well.

Included in this mix is Justin Timberlake as Johnny, an ex-ball player that Gus signed up years before but whose career has changed over the years. Having thrown out his arm, he's now a talent scout as well. He still gets along great with Gus and as the days go by begins to develop some feelings for Mickey as well.

While the movie is centered around the world of baseball make no mistake, it's not baseball that is the film's focus. This film is about the lives of two people who should be connected from the start but whose lives have taken them down different paths away from one another. While they both should find comfort and ease with one another their lives offer little of either. It is this path that they've gone down for years that has driven them apart and has left them with emotional scars that they won't easily repair.

There isn't a bad piece of acting in this entire film. Adams does a great job as Mickey, trying to solve the problems that she's built up over the years. Timberlake has grown on me over the past few years showing that he can be a dynamite actor given the chance. The surprising thing for me in this film was Eastwood though. Always teased about a monotone delivery and for his use of silence more than speaking, the character of Gus is given plenty of life in Eastwood's performance here. One sequence involving him visiting his wife's grave was particularly touching and totally different than anything I've ever seen him do before.

When this film came out I wasn't sure that I actually wanted to see it. I held off on it even when it came out on DVD but thought finally why not. I'm glad I did. This was one of the most enjoyable dramas I've seen in some time. It also proves that while Eastwood is getting older, he's also still one of the best movie stars around today.",1357776000,,3950,4.438620689655172

4 stars. As with most things it's all subjective.",1357516800,,274,3.824561403508772
5308622,5,B009AMAK54,I love clint Eastwood.  He is a  lovable cranky old man.  Great story line.  Always looking for a movie both my husband and I can enjoy and this was one of them.  Very entertaining.,1357516800,,181,4.205882352941177
5308653,5,B009AMAK54,In this film lives diverge when a mother dies leaving the father to raise a child alone. It is the epitome of what happens when parents don't communicate with their child and how that can change both of their lives forever.  A must see.,1357516800,,236,4.363636363636363
5308654,4,B009AMAK54,"feel good movie with Clint at his best
predictable outcome but clever twists
almost no profanity, and no sex scenes per say",1357516800,,123,4.636363636363637
5308655,3,B009AMAK54,"I disagree with some of the other reviewers - this is NOT Clint's best movie - far from it.  But, it is a likeable movie and an interesting (although unrealistic) plot line.  Most of the material has been done before; estranged father/daughter issues, love story, good overcomes bad, etc.  I would say that there was some miscasting (especially Timberlake), but I still enjoyed the movie.  I watched it once, but I would not watch it again.  There is nothing endearing to the movie that would make me want to keep it.  I will pass it along to others who have not seen it.  Clint's acting is very good, and fits perfectly with his character.  The love story between his daughter and Timberlake is disjointed and forced...IMHO.  Rent it, don't buy it, until you have seen it.",1357516800,,773,4.625
5308656,5,B009AMAK54,"Finally a movie with no sex in it!  You can watch this move with your kids.  It is a typical Clint Eastwood movie with some humor and some seriousness.  Loved Justin Timberlake in it too.  It's a ""feel good"" movie the whole family can enjoy.",1357516800,,241,4.288888888888889

5308659,3,B009AMAK54,"Very much followed a formula. I was looking forward to this movie and was disappointed. Clint Eastwood's character is much like the one he plated in Gran Torino, but that movie was much better.",1357516800,,193,4.705882352941177

5308663,4,B009AMAK54,"Cute romantic comedy drama.  If you need something to cuddle up to on a Sunday this is your movie.  This movie explores the complicated relationship of a father that has worked his whole life as a baseball scout and his daughter that was dragged along with him game to game.  Even though she harbors some bad feelings about how she was raised, in the end I think she grew up in a unique situation that she starts to appreciate as the movie progresses.  Enter a good looking an ex baseball player and the movie is a nice blend of family drama, romance and baseball.",1357430400,,564,4.394230769230769

5308669,3,B009AMAK54,"Familiar Hallmark-style drama made palatable by Clint Eastwood's iconic presence and his effortless rapport with Amy Adams. ""Trouble With the Curve"" (2012) offers few surprises but remains an agreeable diversion. A disappointment at the box office, this bottom-of-the-ninth Eastwood vehicle works better on the small screen.",1357344000,,324,6.065217391304348

5308671,4,B009AMAK54,Typical new style Clint drama that I think can be seen by the family. The movie that makes you wonder whats wrong with Clint till he finally shares with his daughter. Enough curves in movie to make it worth watching.,1357344000,,216,4.425

5308697,3,B009AMAK54,"This is a great movie if you just want to relax and have a good time.  The performances from the main actors are good, although the supporting characters are extremely predictable and manipulative.  The writers went short of hanging signs on the characters necks, like ""No one knows this, but I'm the bad guy"", or ""I will be the hero at the end"", etc.  In short, they try not to make you feel guilty or sorry for certain characters' fates by making them unlikable, thus killing any possible moral conflict.  Would have been a much better movie had the actions of the characters had some real-life bad consequences along with the good results.",1357344000,,642,4.654867256637168

5308723,5,B009AMAK54,"Eastwood's grumpy demeanor was typical of his roles lately, but he adds his personal touches to bring the character to life. The sports movie, that's really not about sports at all, explores the strained relationship between an aging baseball scout (Eastwood) and his successful, workaholic daughter (Adams).

5308821,4,B009AMAK54,"I liked this film, I liked the story line, Clint Eastwood, OK. He plays an over the hill father and baseball scout. Amy Adams plays his daughter, a smart, savvy lawyer, whose entire life is her job, somewhat like her father. John Goodman plays Gus's (Eastwood) boss,  and Justin Timberlake plays an injured baseball player turned scout.

Gus is losing his sight, which is his mainstay in his business. Mickey, his estranged daughter is called about Gus's problems by Goodman's character. She is betwixt and between, she is on the edge of a big business promotion, but she decides to pay her father a visit. They quarrel, but she perseveres and helps dad with his scouting. They concentrate on Bo Gentry, an obnoxious country boy who thinks he is hot stuff. Gus does not like Gentry, he can hear the whistle of the ball when it slides by Gentry and knows he can't hit all the balls. Timberlake's character is not so certain. Timberlake and Mickey meet and carry on in a grown- up manner and their repertoire is entertainng. The final day when Gus must give his appraisal of Bo Gentry is the complete opposite of the computer generated models. Will Gus's decision be his last? Will Mickey and the scout hook up? Wil Bo Gentry meet his comeuppance?
Stay tuned, the last scenes are worth the price.

5308822,4,B009AMAK54,Pleasantly surprised by this little gem of a movie. Justin Timberlake turns in a great performance while Amy Adams and Clint Eastwood are simply stellar as a daughter/father duo. A must-see for any baseball fan or anyone from the South. Yet another great movie to come out of Georgia's newly incentivized and re-energized film industry. John Goodman also holds his own in a perfectly cast supporting role as the Braves' scouting director.,1357084800,,438,5.097222222222222

She becomes interested in another scout ( justin) and they have contests to see how much she knows about baseball. One of the questios is about the 4 20 game winners who Lose in the world series. That answer is of course is the orioles vs Pittsburgh. Pittsbrgh beat them 4-3 to become champs.

5308872,4,B009AMAK54,"In this 2012 offering, Clint Eastwood makes his return to the big screen since the blockbuster, ""Gran Torino"". Eastwood plays Gus Lobel, an ancient, ailing baseball scout for the Atlanta Braves, who is perhaps embarking on his last scouting road trip, as younger Braves management is beginning to see him as an anachronism rather than an asset. Fortunately, his scouting boss happens to be his good friend and supporter, Pete (played by John Goodman), who suspects Gus is having physical problems. Pete calls up Gus's estranged daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), an aspiring corporate lawyer, and urges her to go with her father on this last road trip. Being fiercely independent, Gus resents the intrusion of his daughter into his job, but after his anger subsides, he stubbornly accepts her at his side. Gus's job is to scout a highly touted top high school baseball prospect and decide whether ""Bo"" should be the Braves number one pick in the upcoming draft. It readily becomes apparent that Gus' failing vision puts him at a distinct disadvantage of evaluating Bo, so daughter Mickey steps in to be her father's failing eyes. In the process, she tries to reconnect with her father and figure out why he seemed to reject her and ignore her after the death of her mother when she was just 6 years old. She also rediscovers her true love of baseball, and learns from her father the intricacies on how to scout players, from the flow of their swings to the sound of the fastball hitting a mitt. Intermixed into the relationship is Johnny Flanagan, (Justin Timberlake), a rival scout who takes a definite love interest in Gus's daughter, Mickey.

Although the movie stars Clint Eastwood, clearly, this is Amy Adams' movie. She absolutely shines in her role of ""Mickey"" (named after Gus's favorite Yankee player), and she single-handedly rescues this film from being a mediocre film about an aging old man, to a very relevant film on how a father and daughter reconcile their past hurts and differences. To his credit, Eastwood knows to step back from the limelight and let Adam's star shine. While baseball plays a major role as the backdrop of this movie, it is the troubled parent-child relationship that is the core of this film. Amy Adams is nothing but terrific and her performance may very well be Oscar-worthy. Justin Timberlake, as Johnny, is also remarkably well cast as Mickey's love interest. I thought Timberlake could only sing; but his acting performance is more than adequate, and his relationship with the emotionally confused and tentative Mickey carries this movie forward in a huge way. A strong supporting cast, namely John Goodman, shores up this movie as well.

The ending is particularly satisfying, and while all the questions about the troubled relationship between parent and child are never fully answered, clearly, the relationship is healed, and there is a promising future for both Gus, Mickey, and Johnny.

I hope this is not Eastwood's last film performance. He has some emotionally engaging scenes where he really shows his range as an actor. He has so much more to give yet to the film industry. I hope he finds another role that allows his diverse talents to shine.

While probably not generally appealing to the crucial 16-24 age group, (thus not a box office smash hit), I believe many ""Baby Boomers"" will appreciate this movie, not only for the portrayal of the angrily aging parent, but for the reconciliation that is possible in all relationships.

(Rated PG-13 for language).

By the way, I love baseball as well, even to the point of moving to Cooperstown for a number of years.  So loving Eastwood and baseball makes this film a winner for me.  However, there is more to the story.  It is a counterpoint to Money Ball and shows the problems of a young person (daughter in her 30s) coping with an aging grumpy father (Eastwood).  Such a situation is the case with my brother and his daughters and is probably the case for many younger people these days.  As a result, I bought copies for my brother and each of his two daughters as gifts.  Perhaps it will help them to understand each other better.  So a person gets three stories in one: baseball, problems of aging, and problems of children in dealing with an aging parent.  It's a bargain!",1356912000,,920,4.290697674418604
5308937,4,B009AMAK54,"I enjoyed the relationships between Eastwood's character stubburness and his daughter's.

  I liked how the idea of old versus new worked out.  It shows an idea how people still have a role where a computer can't feel or hear experience.  Actually that is about the programmer who doesn't program that in to their program.

 I also enjoyed the idea when a person gets older, they tend to hide  their faults fearing rejection or possible loss of something earned, whether its a job, a drivers license or just the ability to take care of one's self.

There does seem to be a little too much just sitting around.  It's a movie with a lot of dialogue with other people performing action tasks in the back ground.  The characters do drive down the road some.  So, while it's not an action flick, it's got a lot of dailogue... issues that people come across in their live times packed into a 2 hr movie -- good stuff.

5308952,4,B009AMAK54,"This one's not for the kids and probably wouldn't hold a teenager's interest; expect strong language, coarse references/innuendo, adult situations and frank glimpses of the realities of aging.  That said, you can also be prepared for a film that takes its time on character development without ever losing the mellow, measured pace of a Carolina summer, where the heart of the story unfolds.  You will be slowly enveloped in a culture at times gritty and mercenary and at other times inspiring... the culture of baseball.

But this movie doesn't stand alone as a sports piece; you'll be in for a disappointment if that's all you're looking for, and in for a pleasant surprise if you want a movie about real people and real problems that stays within the bounds of plausibility while being charming, funny and poignant.  It is about baseball, but it's also about family, love, the value of every day and the far-reaching consequences of our choices.  It's a film that never tries to shock you, or proclaim its own brilliance.  There are no grand-standing emotional moments, gun-fights, chase scenes or bedroom romps.  The seamless, well-written screenplay is delivered artfully by a director who knows when cinematic tricks would be jarring, and is content to let the story tell itself through his characters.

Genuine, believable performances from Timberlake and Adams support Eastwood's quietly brilliant personification of a man who has given his life to a sport to escape pain, and is finally having to come to grips with human weakness and find an identity outside of being one of baseball's most talented scouts, as a father.  It's not a complex story, but the director refrains from a culminating flash-back or intrusive narrative at the end, allowing viewers to savor the film a second time while tying up all of the loose threads that slip past the first time.  Watch it twice... fans of good stories, well-told, won't be disappointed by this unassuming gem.",1356825600,,1966,5.021538461538461

5308956,4,B009AMAK54,A goodmoviebut had a few holes in the story. Eastwood is our favorite old guy kicking up dust at modern change.,1356825600,,111,4.333333333333333
5308957,4,B009AMAK54,Enjoyed the movie and would definitely recommend it to others. Ridiculous u have to add more words to the write up...,1356825600,,117,4.619047619047619

5308959,2,B009AMAK54,Hackney'd script. I like Eastwood but this grouchy old man routine is wearing thin. Very formulaic. Very predictable. Watch the trailer and you've seen the only parts of the movie worth watching.,1356825600,,195,5.125
5308960,4,B009AMAK54,This was a very enjoyable movie. I am pleased that I chose this movie to rent. I would recommend this for all baseball fans.,1356825600,,124,4.208333333333333

5308973,3,B009AMAK54,"This movie was OK.  I like Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams from other movies they have made, but was not impressed with this one with both of them in it.  I felt Clint Eastwood was replaying his role in Million Dollar Baby and Grand Torino, but not as well.  While I will applaud Amy Adams for her effort I found it difficult to believe her as tough and as a true baseball fan.  I am glad I did not spend $15 or $20 to see this movie in a theater.",1356825600,,444,3.9

It was enjoyable and wasn't a wast of time.",1356825600,,169,4.419354838709677
5308977,2,B009AMAK54,Clint's grumpy old man act is tired and boring at this point. Amy Adams said her lines with faint enthusiasism. The baseball portions were frankly stupid and the whole thing was as predictable as a sunrise.,1356739200,,206,4.75
5308978,3,B009AMAK54,"Too slow. Clumsy ending.
Could've been better. Justin was good. Expected more from Clint Eastwood, but I guess I overestimated him on a baseball movie.",1356739200,,151,5.08
5308979,5,B009AMAK54,I would not have watched this if my daughter hadn't asked if we could watch the trailer. I was hooked. I love the way the story is told. The characters are developed well enough to make you really care what happens. The script was fresh and had enough little surprises to keep me on my toes. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who misses a great story being told instead of disconnected special effects.,1356739200,,408,4.453333333333333
5308980,4,B009AMAK54,"There won't be any surprises, but the acting is top notch.  Justin Timberlake keeps surprising me, even if he does play the same quirky romantic type.  Same goes for the performances from Adams and Eastwood.  The plot is predictable, but in the end, you can't help but feel that it was well worth it.  Maybe we need to revisit the classic genres with some fresh faces like Timberlake and Adams.",1356739200,,394,4.585714285714285

5308995,5,B009AMAK54,"I write with partiality given that the movie takes place on the familiar grounds of both North Carolina and Georgia.  Yes it starts off bleak and I certainly could have done without some of the visuals and 'gd' inserts but it ended well and left me smiling.  Was it the beautiful scenery of the southern Appalachian Mountains?  Was the struggles, not so uncommon, between the Father and Daughter? Was it the happier feel good ending? Or what it the less obvious lessons between egos and relationships? What it seeing the jerks justifiably meet their end while the more noble got recognition?  I almost could feel the sense of freedom that the daughter experiences as she tosses her phone into the dumpster.  And I could certainly related to the freedom that both Father and Daughter feel through forgiveness and moving forward.  I do not know what all took place to make their relationship so tumultuous.  Maybe it was just trouble with the curve.",1356739200,,947,4.808641975308642

5309000,2,B009AMAK54,"I'm not sure how these actors signed on for a script of this quality...but they did. Eastwood, Adams, Goodman and Timberlake are all quite good. Without their skills this movie would have been completely unwatchable due the script. Simplistic, clumsy and downright condescending at times, the writing for this film was atrocious. Even with the star power, I had trouble believing in the narrative truth of the film, with plot points edited in willy nilly, character arcs that resembled flatlines and an emotional arc to the film that resembled a child's (badly) written reading primer. I watched the film and got through it because of the actors (all of whom did a good job,) but save yourself the time if you are looking for something that has some subtlety or nuance in the script...because it ain't here.",1356739200,,807,4.897810218978102

5309015,2,B009AMAK54,I was looking forward to seeing this movie because I am a big Clint Eastwood fan but this movie felt flat to me. It was way too predictable and Clint is once again cast as a grumpy old man. This could have been a lot better. I won't be watching this one again.,1356652800,3,260,3.9245283018867925

SO, this could be an excellent ""date night"" flick as it has enough for the ""chick"" and enough Eastwood and baseball to keep you from falling asleep. My only negative is that the plot, character interactions, are so bloody predictable. There is not one surprise in the movie and it must have been written by a TV script writer because in the last 10 minutes, everything and I mean everything, comes together, resolves..... UGH! Enjoyable. For the chick in your life.",1356652800,,605,4.559633027522936

5309042,4,B009AMAK54,Clint Eastwood played the role he always played and this was appropriate for this film. Amy Adams very good in the role. The story of an old-timer baseball scout with special skills competing successfully with the new computer-reliant scout was enjoyable for me.

Movie had some genuine moments such as the value of life wisdom trumping computer science which left a nice aftertaste..  Skinny dipping scene was a surprise, actually left their real people underwear and shirt on....not sure why that was more fun than the usual Hollywood interpretation, but it was.",1356652800,,439,4.905405405405405

5309051,3,B009AMAK54,"This movie has a nice plot (perhaps a little predictable) with an interesting ending.  I guess the thing that makes it kind of hard to watch at times is Clint Eastwood's over-the-top portrayal of the gruff, aging and fairly belligerent father.  I've always been an Eastwood fan, but he almost looks to be trying too hard at this role.  Plus we've seen him before like this as in Gran Torino.  Amy Adams, as his daughter, is perfectly cast, although in reality she should have had this confrontation much earlier in her life.
I liked the ending, so stick with it.  All in all, a nice movie with family situations that hopefully you never had.",1356652800,,641,4.587719298245614

5309066,5,B009AMAK54,"This movie was very well cast and is entertaining.  It leaves you with a happy feeling, which is rare in many of the newer movies.  At first I was a bit concerned about the demeanor of the aging Eastwood but his professionalism came through as always, and the movie benefits from his years of experience.  The big surprise for me was ""pretty boy"" Justin Timberlake's job of playing a baseball pitcher who is dealing with the aftermath of a rotator cuff injury that put him on the bench permanently.  His sensitive yet believable portrayal of his character left me wishing him well in his new found career in films.  I was unfamiliar with Amy Adams prior to seeing this movie  but she did a marvelous job.  I will check for other films she has done.

You won't go wrong with this unless you just detest baseball.... and even then the storyline carries Trouble With The Curve quite well.",1356566400,,885,4.556962025316456

5309068,4,B009AMAK54,We enjoyed this movie about baseball. Don't worry if you don't like baseball. It's just a nice movie about a tomboy girl and her Dad and how each grow. The pace of the movie is good and keeps it entertaining with some nice zingers!,1356566400,,231,4.2727272727272725
5309069,5,B009AMAK54,"Father time has not diminished Clint Eastwood's ability to put forth another truly memorable performance. Mr. Eastwood's portrayal of a major league baseball scout hounded by upstart executives and a troubled relationship with a family member, while having his judgement questioned because of his age, was masterful.  If you're a true Clint Eastwood fan, spanning the years from Rowdie Hayes in Rawhide, to Dirty Harry movies you are sure to love his latest acting masterpiece.",1356566400,,477,5.36

After that the movie starts to roll and it loses some of its depressing quality for a more upbeat and comedic feel.  Still sad, but happy ending helps.

Eastwood is always great, so nothing more needs to be said about that. I haven't seen Amy Adams in a film before, but I certainly will in the future. She was more than excellent as the daughter.

5309161,4,B009AMAK54,This is for die-hard Eastwood fans.  Eastwood continues to age gracefully and reprises his by-now familiar role of irascible senior facing the frailties of old age with something less than grace.  Both Justin Timberlake and Amy Adams turn in charming performances as a secondary romance develops.  The plot is a little predictable and dialog nothing to rave about but its an enjoyable flick and moves right along.,1356307200,,413,5.134328358208955

5309183,4,B009AMAK54,I enjoyed the movie although I would not classify it as a true sports movie.  Clint was in rare form as a disgruntled and aging dad who did things his way and refused to change.  He reminded me of that uncle that everyone has who you're forced to deal with during the holiday season.  Good humor and a solid story.  I recommend watching!,1356307200,,337,4.301587301587301

Clint Eastwood again turns in another great performance since GRAND TORINO. This reviewer also liked the side-story romance in the film and the small-town locations which served as a kind of ""character"" in the film. The other actors in this ensemble which includes John Goodman, Amy Adams, Justin Timberlake, Robert Patrick, Mathew Lillard et al. are were cast perfectly. Justin Timberlake proves again that he works better in the confines of a support ensemble instead of a lead (i.e. THE SOCIAL NETWORK). The side story of the romance bewteen his character and Amy Adam's character is a nice touch with the baseball backdrop. Overall, with all the big-budget special-effects movies coming out during 2012, it's nice to see a small-budget contemporary baseball/romance film out there.",1356220800,,893,5.340425531914893

5309241,5,B009AMAK54,"This is Clint Eastwood in another great movie representing an average individual. Not inspector Callahan but an everyday Joe with his problems and qualities.

Clint plays the role of an aging baseball scout (Gus Lobel) who works for the Atlant Braves, and who is slowly losing his sight and the respect of the people around him. His daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) who is auditioning to became partner with a macho law firm (aren't all like this?...patronizing) must take time off and help him in his last assignment. At this point everybody knows what will happen to her partnership in the firm... but apparently she is resolved this time to help her father. During the trip many old family stories come out, including the fact that he had to practically abandon her when she was little after her mom died. They also meet another scout (Justin Timberlake) who is really more interested in ...Mickey than in baseball.

As always, Clint Eastwood performance is outstanding. Reminded me of ""Bloodwoork"" where again he is weak and dependable. He also reminded me of ""Bloodwork"" because he is always fighting an arrogant young idiot who thinks he knows everything after few months on the job. Of course the plot in this movie is totally different from the one in ""Bloodwork"".

This movie represents very accurately our society and what is happening these days. On one hand we have an old experienced guy who lives in a modest house with minimum furniture, who travels alot, and who is used to seat in the stands for years and years watching AAA and high school games all over the country and uses his on-the-field experience and instinct to select real baseball talent, not really caring for the payback. On the other side we have an arrogant idiot with an iPod and an iPhone with minimum education and a computer, who thinks that he knows everything because he can Google the player's name and check his statistics. Never saw him play but he is looking at the stats and therefore if he looks great on paper he must be a great player. In addition, anticipating that he will be in this job forever because he is so good (...because he has a computer), he is living the great life on a credit card (...but I just bought a boat and I have mortgage payments). Typical metrosexual that we usually expect to find in New York city, but he is in Atlanta and works for the Braves.

This kind of attitude has real consequences in life. Just two examples. Look at the mess with the BCS. Every year it is a blow out because it is not the people on the side lines who decide which is the best team and which teams are going to play in the championship game. The computers decide (strength of schedule, stats etc). Look what happened to Tim Tebow. A decent human being with huge potential to become a great QB, coming out of a great school. The sportscasters ridiculed him because he is a Christian, putting up his bad stats all the time, to a point that now it will be difficult for him to come back. Only because the teams are affraid to offer him a contract because of what the sportscasters will say. If it weren't for the idiots sportscasters (who know everything because they have a computer in front of them and can draw footbal plays) he could have the starting QB position in a good team and with a decent QB coach he could have done well in the NFL.

The ending of the movie is not surprising but is not predictable either. Really enjoyed the scene towards the end when Mickey disposes of her cell phone. There is so much patience to have with some people!

This is a great solid family movie with great acting, a solid story, and great direction. Five stars all around. Thank you Mr. Eastwood for another great movie to put next to Bloodwork, Million dollar Baby, and Gran Torino.",1356134400,5,3769,4.559822747415066

great old man. I still would pay for a movie about him talking to a chair.
 But here, we have characters, baseball stuff...scouts....and other older actors.
Solid story, solid acting...its actually a baseball movie..a love story ..and
a hope story as we're all hoping that the right actions are taken.
  Just like other great baseball movies, this one will find its place with the rest. And also, finally they gave Big John Goodman a decent role where he does nt
have to torture or kill anyone like his previous roles in the past few years.
Good actor and actresses shine when you have a decent script.

He is starting to get outdated as computers seem to be the new way of evaluating player talent. He is also starting to lose his eyesight and it makes it harder for him to see what a player can bring to the team. The problem is that he doesn't believe any of that. This first and foremost is a good and entertaining movie. Eastwood once again plays himself and once again it works. Amy Adams however steals the movie and if any one could be Eastwoods kid in a movie it is her. It was probably just my wishful thinking but I was hoping for this to be more of a baseball movie then it was. The movie was really good but it was more about Gus and Mickey's (Adams) relationship then baseball. That isn't a bad thing but I was hoping for another ""Moneyball"" type movie.

5309285,4,B009AMAK54,"Amy Adams owns her role and is totally convincing. Justin Timberlake has been fairly mediocre in his acting career thus far, and is given just enough of a role in combination with good directorial coaching to perform adequately; how much of this is based on him virtually playing himself is questionable. Eastwood's roles are something of an enjoyable cliche, but he goes on to show a lot more emotional depth than was evident in Gran Torino. John Goodman is also a welcome face.

I have no knowledge of Amy Adam's baseball expertise, but she sells her role expertly. She seems genuine at all times, something which is difficult and rare when you are selling an artificial expertise you don't own (guessing that regardless of any baseball knowledge she has, that her character is on the extreme end of that) Example are special forces soldiers in movies who don't know how to handle weapons and speak jargon and regurgitate dialog that anyone associated with the infantry or spec-ops community would laugh at.

The plot develops evenly, the characters seems to change as the plot progresses (perhaps because many of the scenes were shot in order), and the resolution is satisfying.

On the whole this is a pretty good movie, not a great movie, but pretty good one. The film ended and I was left satisfied; there were no loose ends to tie up, and no feeling that something was missing.",1355616000,2,1384,4.7824267782426775
5309286,5,B009AMAK54,"I thought this movie was great and funny. It was kind of like an older movie meant for older audiences but I still thought it was great. This movie is about a man named Gus who is a baseball talent scout but he is losing his sight. He is old-fashioned and always relied on his sight and a feeling to pick good baseball players. Without his sight he doesn't know how to scout and even though he is having trouble he won't ask for help. His daughter comes to help him anyway and they have a good time together but bad things happen too. The main characters in the movie are Gus and Mickey. Gus is played by Clint Eastwood and Mickey is played by Amy Adams. Amy Adams is in another movie that my little sister loves called Enchanted and I also really liked her in The Muppets. My favorite character in this movie is Gus because he is a good man that people should trust. He knows a LOT about baseball and has a good heart. The movie also has really good chemistry. Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams work very well together. He kind of seems like a grumpy old man and she is kind of sweet.

My favorite part in this movie is when Mickey meets a new guy who can through a really good curve ball and since she really loves baseball they become really good friends. I would recommend this movie for ages 10 and up because my brother says that the movie was a little too old for him and he's seven. The movie also has some inappropriate language and situations that are too young for kids under 10. Anthony A, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

5309289,5,B009AMAK54,"I have to say up front that I like baseball movies, a lot.  Add that to my lifelong admiration for Clint Eastwood and the fact that I find Amy Adams to be absolutely charming and very easy on the eyes makes ""Trouble With The Curve"" a true home run for me.

It's obvious that Clint Eastwood is slowing down a bit with age, but that just makes him the perfect fit here for the aging baseball scout who scouts for the Atlanta Braves but is having vision problems.  Since it's hard to actually scout anything without proper vision, his estranged daughter, played by Adams, who is a hot-shot lawyer on the partner path decides to join him out on the road for his latest scouting mission.

""Trouble With The Curve"" is a quiet little movie that may telegraph its pitches a bit, but for me that just added to the charm of the movie.  There are no major twists and turns, just a simple and heartfelt story being told with grace.  Adam's character wants to know why her dad abandoned her after her mother died when she was younger and Eastwood is reluctant to talk about it.  Both characters have their flaws and both of them have been carrying demons from the past.

Justin Timberlake plays Johnny, a once hot-shot pitching phenom who was scouted by Eastwood and who then threw his arm out early in his career and is now scouting for the Red Sox in the hopes of landing a broadcasting job with the team.  His character plays nicely between Eastwood and Adams, helping bridge the gap between them and as he grows closer to Adams' character helps her understand that her old man may not be the cold guy she thinks he is.

When it's all said and done, this isn't as much a baseball movie as it is a movie about the father and daughter relationship and a movie about why people follow paths that they may not want to follow.  The characters are all so very human and well played that it was a joy to watch.

The bottom line is if you like quiet little movies about real people then you'll probably like ""Trouble With The Curve.""",1355097600,68,2015,4.372654155495979
5309290,4,B009AMAK54,"Clint Eastwood plays an old talent scout for the Atlanta Braves. He has failing eyesight and doesn't have a computer. He has a strained relationship with his successful daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) who is a workaholic and about to be offered a partnership in a law firm.

Clint's latest task is to scout Bo Gentry, a slugger from North Carolina. At the request of her dad's associate (John Goodman) Mickey torpedoes her chance at being a partner to be the eyes for a father, who is not exactly grateful for the help, yet uses her talents. While away, she meets a young scout for the Red Sox (Justin Timberlake).

The movie is enjoyable as Clint plays a man perhaps too much like himself. Amy Adams was magnificent as the shunned daughter in what amounted to an improbable film. The movie spends time to develop character for a plot that lacks the action associated with Eastwood films. A heart warming film for Eastwood fans. Worthy of a view and might make for a decent date night film. Border line chick flick.

5309292,4,B009AMAK54,"Clint Eastwood stars in (but not directs) ""Trouble with the Curve,"" a drama about a veteran Atlanta Braves baseball scout Gus Lobel and his estranged 33-year-old daughter Mickey (Amy Adams). The film is directed by Eastwood's long-time collaborator (assistant director/producer) Robert Lorenz making his feature film debut here.

Clint Eastwood plays Gus Lobel, whose latest (and possibly last) assignment is to travel to North Carolina and scout a promising high school player Bo Gentry (Joe Massingill). Being unsure of his ability to see whether Bo is really worth the No. 1 pick, Gus's friend and boss Pete Klein (John Goodman) asks Gus's daughter Mickey to accompany her father, whose eyesight is failing. Mickey, herself an able lawyer (who has an important presentation to deliver), reluctantly agrees.

The film is always fun when Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams share the screen. Justin Timberlake as Johnny Flanagan, a young Boston Red Sox scout (and romantic interest for Amy Adams's character) is also very good. Except for John Goodman, however, supporting players fare less well, including the talents like Bob Gunton, Ed Lauter, Matthew Lillard and Robert Patrick, with one-dimensional characters that almost look like caricatures.

That the film's story is predictable didn't bother me much. I could even forget the incredible turn of events at the end of the film that is too good to be true. I know this is a Hollywood film, sentimental and melodramatic, and as such it is enjoyable. But with a pair of a grizzled Clint Eastwood with understated charisma, and always reliable Amy Adams as his daughter, it is obvious that this film could have been something more.",1354060800,,1678,5.161764705882353

5309295,3,B009AMAK54,"Trouble With The Curve is a watchable film about an aging baseball scout facing problems with a changing game, fading eyesight and a difficult relationship with his daughter that he's running out of time to fix. In a lot of ways, it could have been the perfect counter-point to last year's excellent film Moneyball, showing the view of the veteran scouts and their traditional ways of looking for talent in contrast to the analytics-driven approach which now dominates the game. But in the hands of first-time director Robert Lorenz and first-time screen-writer Randy Brown, Trouble With The Curve never ventures beyond formula and manages to run for 111 mostly by-the-numbers minutes without a single moment of unpredictability.

Gus Lobel (Clint Eastwood) is a man caught between the rocks of old age and failing eyesight and the hard place of trying to hang on to his job as a baseball scout as the whole nature of the business is changing around him, going from a hands-on gut feel approach to boiling down potential players into a set of stats on a laptop. His contract with the Atlanta Braves baseball team is coming up for renewal, but his bosses, team owner Vince (Robert Patrick) and manager Pete Klein (John Goodman) aren't sure if Gus is up to the job anymore. Especially with their up-and-coming scout Phil Sanderson (Matthew Lillard, oozing sleaze) telling them that Gus' way of doing things just doesn't cut it anymore.

Ultimately, everything depends on a scouting mission Gus is set to handle: to check out a player named Bo Gentry (Joe Massingill, oozing obnoxiousness), a hard-hitter on a small Georgia college team who's viewed as a potential top pick in the upcoming draft. Klein, who's a long-time friend of Gus's as well as his boss, gets in touch with Gus's daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams, shining brilliantly) a successful attorney on the brink of being made a partner at the law firm where she works. Klein tells Mickey his concerns and what's at stake for Gus if he blows this mission, asking her to go with Gus and keep an eye on things. Unwilling at first, particularly as her being made a partner depends on a big presentation she's to give for a major client in a matter of days, Mickey reluctantly gives in when she finds out about Gus's eye problems, telling her bosses that she has to take a couple of days off to deal with her father but that she _will_ be there to handle the presentation on time. While Mickey and Gus aren't exactly estranged, there is nonetheless a distance between them that neither seems able to overcome, making their relationship difficult at best and more often one of walking away with hands thrown up in frustration. Their only common ground, rather naturally given the film, is their love of baseball.

While scouting out the intended prospect, Gus and Mickey run into Johnny (Justin Timberlake), a former pitcher first recruited by Gus who is now a scout for the Boston Red Sox, having been forced to find an alternate career after his arm gave out too soon. Johnny rounds out the odd trio, Johnny in his relationship to Gus as a former recruit and now rival scout, Gus with his awkward and ever frictional relationship with Mickey, and now Mickey who finds herself being drawn out in spite of herself by Johnny's almost clownish come-on's. And of course all three of them with their relationship with baseball, the one thing where they all find their moments of grace.

It has to be said that if Trouble With The Curve works at all, it is in no small part because of Amy Adams' performance. In spite of Lorenz' mechanical direction and Brown's pedestrian script, Adams manages to make Mickey shine nonetheless, engaging you in ways that make you buy into her character even when you'd otherwise see no reason to. Some of her best moments are those in which she has no dialogue and it's just the expression on her face conveying what Mickey is feeling that make the connection. Her scenes with Eastwood and with Timberlake work because she makes them work, bringing a chemistry to the situations that keeps you watching and makes you care. Eastwood's Gus is adequate to the role, but only just, with Eastwood basically just playing the same role he's been playing for the last twenty years, largely glaring and growling his way through things, mostly relying in this case on the fact that at 82 he actually _is_ old instead of having to act old. In the hands of a better director, Eastwood would almost certainly have given a better performance, but one of the problems with Trouble With The Curve is that Lorenz doesn't seem to know how to draw the best out of his actors or the situations they're in. Timberlake is not only largely wasted but in retrospect grossly miscast: he would have been far more effective as Gus's in-house nemesis Sanderson. As Johnny, he really doesn't have much credibility or even reason to be there as you could pretty much cut all of his scenes and it wouldn't affect the main plot in the slightest. But at the same time, his scenes with Adams do give her even more opportunities to shine. One of my favorite scenes is in a country bar where Mickey pulls a reluctant Johnny out onto the dance floor for a throw-him-in-the-water lesson in clog-dancing.

The other performances are a mixed bag, but two in particular stand out in ways that encapsulate the problems with the script and the direction. Matthew Lillard's Phil is almost a caricature of a sleazey underhanded in-house rival to Gus, so over-the-top that you know from the moment he first opens his mouth that you're supposed to hate him. I think this could be something of a career problem for Lillard as he's gone from always playing goofy comic sidekicks when he was younger to now playing complete sleazeballs in recent years, most recently in The Descendants. And Joe Massingill's Bo Gentry is so unbelievably obnoxious that it's a mystery why the rest of his team hasn't taken him out behind the stadium and beaten him to death with his own bat long before Gus and Mickey show up. If Trouble With The Curve had been an outright comedy, then both Lillard and Massingill's performances would've fit perfectly, but as it is, some subtlety was badly needed and unfortunately was completely lacking, the primary blame for which must be laid at the feet of Lorenz and Brown.

One wishes that Lorenz and Brown had been more daring or ambitious, given the talented actors they had to work with, but they weren't. You can tell early on that before Trouble With The Curve is over, all problems will be resolved in true Hollywood fashion, the characters you like will all triumph in the end and the characters you dislike will all get their deserved comeuppance. One also wishes that they'd gotten a more experienced director and writer to begin with as quite frankly Lorenz and Brown display a lack of talent in both the direction and the writing. The one element of mystery in the film - the reason why Gus and Mickey have such distance between them - when finally revealed feels completely artificial due in part to the clunky way in which the foreshadowing was handled and in part to the fact that, once revealed, it apparently makes no difference to either character as the movie just returns to its original track. The editing is often jumpy in places instead of smooth, and apparently Lorenz never wanted to do more than one take because you're constantly seeing all of the major actors' eyes looking to the sides, apparently to read cue cards to get through their lines. A regrettable waste of A-list actors in the C-list hands of a first-time director and a first-time writer.

On the plus side, the feel of the settings is well done, and you can believe that you're actually seeing Gus and Mickey doing a scouting mission in a small town where a local baseball star can be a big fish in a small pond. The music score by Marco Beltrami is also well done, setting the tone in the background without ever being intrusive so that you're barely aware that it's there, exactly the kind of score you need in a film like this.

Recommended for Amy Adams' brilliant performance and for anyone interested in a film about baseball recruiting and doesn't mind if the rest of the film is routine and completely predictable.",1351987200,10,8264,4.714186851211073

While his immediate superior and longtime friend Pete (played by John Goodman) values Gus's opinion and defends him against his detractors, one of them is Pete's boss and Gus's ultimate superior. That man, Pete Silver (played by Matthew Lillard) is determined to fire Gus even though he is completely unaware of Gus's failing eyesight. To Silver, a man who relies on statistics and equations over experience and first-hand observation, Gus is a relic of a time gone by. Gus is given one chance, scouting a highly-coveted player in North Carolina, to prove his value to the organization. Pete worries about his friend and so, behind his back, he contacts Gus's daughter Mickey (played by Amy Adams). Mickey is a lawyer on a partnership track in a prestigious firm with a pressing case on the horizon. She's been told that her handling of this case will determine the outcome of the upcoming partnership vote. Still, despite a strained relationship between the two of them, she chooses to go to her father's aide in rural North Carolina and work in her hotel room and over the internet. When Gus informs Mickey that his eyes are starting to fail him, she begins taking an active role in her father's scouting trip. A task she is well-suited for, after a spending a large portion of her formative years by her father's side on scouting trips. In addition to colleagues Gus has known for many years, there is Johnny Flanagan, a relatively inexperienced scout who Gus recruited into the major leagues and who later suffered a career-ending injury. Johnny (played by Justin Timberlake) thinks of Gus as a mentor and, separately, takes an immediate romantic interest in Mickey.

  Now, many believed that 2008's Gran Torino would be the end of Eastwood's career, both as a director and an actor. Some who thought little of the film even took great joy in the very idea of Eastwood's retirement. I was not among them. I won't say this is better than Gran Torino or Million Dollar Baby, it isn't. Still, it's an enjoyable film about the endurance of family that also manages to incorporate some timeless wisdom regarding the quintessential American sport.

5309300,5,B009AMAK54,"In September movie studios generally release their small box office films that may be successful or not as many are not going to the theatre as in previous times of the years. The films during the fall are usually known as ""sleepers"" and are quick to be forgotten as Hollywood gears up for their next big round of film releases for the Holidays.

 In ""Trouble with the Curve"" Clint Eastwood plays an aging scouter well past 80 who finds his eye sight is getting worse and he realizes that he may not be able to do what he did once: to find the best baseball players around. On the advice of a friend (played by John Goodman) his daughter (beautifully portrayed by Amy Adams) decides to escort her father to North Carolina on his latest round of scouting activity. There they meet Johnny (Justin Timberlake) who is a fellow scouter of Gus' (the Eastwood character) and he immediately falls in love with Gus' daughter.

 The material may sound heavy (someone going blind is tough story for audiences to digest), but in ""Trouble with the Curve"" there is humor, an intelligent script and some of the finest performances by a supporting cast in a movie.

5309301,4,B009AMAK54,"I knew that I wanted to see Trouble with the Curve without knowing anything about the plot. The reason? Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams are so likable. Eastwood claimed that he would never act again after making Gran Torino, but I'm happy that he changed his mind. Eastwood plays baseball scout, Gus Lobel, and his character is similar to Walt from Gran Torino in many ways. He's hard to get along with, even if you happen to be one of his close friends.

One thing I should point out is that Trouble of the Curve is funny. Although it's tagged as a drama, there is a lot of humor in the movie. Eastwood has good comic timing and his character delivers one-liners at every opportunity. The audience in my theater laughed loudly and often. But the story also has the ability to move you emotionally. It feels somewhat like a James L. Brooks movie, such as Broadcast News or As Good as It Gets.

Like Moneyball, Trouble with the Curve is about people more than it is about Baseball. Gus has three months left on his contract and with the exception of his friend, Paul (John Goodman), people are starting to wonder whether he's still capable of doing his job. He's a dinosaur, preferring to dig through a pile of newspapers for statistics, rather than rely on computers for the information. His boss (Matthew Lillard) wants to replace him.

The thing is, there is some truth to the belief that Gus is struggling to do his job as a scout. His eyesight is failing and it doesn't go unnoticed. Paul pays him a visit and advises him of the situation, asking him if he has considered the future, but Gus won't listen. In desperation, Paul asks Gus's daughter, Mickey (Adams), to go on the road and help out her father with his latest scouting assignment. She's an ambitious lawyer, and on the verge of becoming a partner, but she agrees to squeeze it into her schedule and intervene.

Adams is a talented actress and I've been waiting for her to get a meaty role after earning an Oscar nomination for her performance in Doubt. Her role in The Fighter was too brief to count. I've yet to see The Master, but I came away thinking this was the best Amy Adams performance in the past four years. I mentioned that she is likable, but she's also good at what she does. There's a certain intelligence and vulnerability to her characters that I find appealing, and it's present in Mickey. She appears successful on the outside, but she has never been close to her father.

There are three main themes present in the movie:

If you have seen Absolute Power, you'll know that Eastwood is convincing as a father who has a problematic relationship with his daughter. One of the keys to Trouble with the Curve is seeing how Mickey attempts to resolve her issues with Gus.

The most obvious issue is with Gus, as old age threatens his livelihood. Director Robert Lorenz takes plenty of time at the outset to establish his characters, allowing us to get an idea of what is at stake. Is Gus washed up, or does he still have something to offer? I won't ruin that for you.

The other main theme is the ability to decide what constitutes happiness. It's different for everyone. Are you happy because you earn a good salary and thrive in your career? What about personal relationships and family? How about having time to enjoy your life?

It's clear that Gus is happy working as a baseball scout, but what isn't clear is how Mickey views her own life. Is she truly happy as a lawyer? Can she come to terms with the distance between her and her father? She's also romantically involved with a man who thinks of her as a commodity rather than as a woman he loves. He figures that they get along quite well and are both successful, so it would make sense for them to be together. He's not the most romantic of men.

That's the setup. As you can see, there are a lot of issues at stake.

One thing the movie does badly is make it obvious which characters you are supposed to root for, and who you should dislike. That flaw makes it easy to predict the outcome for Gus, Mickey, and at least three other minor characters. Those flaws aside, I enjoyed the pacing and the thorough characterization.

If this turns out to be Eastwood's final acting role, it's not a bad way to finish. As for Adams, it is good to see her in a role which allows her to show that she can actually act. I should also mention Justin Timberlake, who plays a former baseball player and young talent scout. He's also interested in Mickey if she'll let down her defenses long enough.

Trouble with the Curve isn't a great movie, but it's very good, and one that I want to own. It's a pleasure to spend time with the actors and the story has a lot of warmth. If you're a fan of Eastwood or Adams, I doubt that you'll be disappointed.",1348272000,4,4768,4.441647597254004
