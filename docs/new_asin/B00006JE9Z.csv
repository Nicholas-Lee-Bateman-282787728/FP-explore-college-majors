91 - 100 - Perfect. A flawless PPV, you must buy this. Without a doubt this belongs in everyone's wrestling collection.

81 - 90 - Superb. An outstanding PPV, I highly recommend that you buy this.

71 - 80 - Great. A first-rate PPV, certainly worth your money.

61 - 70 - Good. A satisfying PPV. Perhaps buy this if you really feel you want it.

51 - 60 - Fair. An average PPV. It is worth a look, not your money.

41 - 50 - Mediocre. A dull PPV. - Perhaps take a look at this if you get a chance, I don't recommend it though.

31 - 40 - Poor. An unsatisfactory PPV - Maybe for hardcore wrestling fans, not for anyone else.

21 - 30 - Bad. A lousy PPV - This is not worth a look from anyone.

11 - 20 - Terrible. An awful PPV - Stay away from this and make sure you never see it.

1 - 10 - Abysmal. An appalling PPV - This is just a waste of time.

BAPTIZED IN BLOOD 3:

New Black Panthers vs. American Wild Child/Street Styles vs. Pogo/Juantastico vs. Mexico's Most Wanted - 7/10

A very long match however an entertaining tag match. Not hardcore at all but still an enjoyable opener.

3 Way Dance Ladder Match

'Rock Superstar' Kaos vs. Chris Hamrick vs. Psichosis - 6/10

I expected more from this ladder match. No jaw dropping spots at all, not much high flying action. A pretty boring match and it's a shame, this match could have been amazing.

Round One Deathmatch:

Vinne Massaro vs. Altar Boy Luke - 7.5/10

Not very hardcore but an entertaining match. This isn't just garbage wrestling, a lot of wrestling moves are performed and this makes the match fun to watch.

Round One Deathmatch:

Crimson vs. Steve Rizzono - 7/10

A pretty hardcore match but it is cut short by the entrance of Pogo the clown. Not a bad short match.

Round One Deathmatch:

G.Q. Money vs. Angel - 9/10

Surprisingly the best match of the night by far and one of the best deathmatches I've seen in a long time. Extremely hardcore with a lot of sick spots, mostly involving light tubes. The flaming table spot is messed up but GQ Money misses the table and takes a sick fall. Superb deathmatch.

Round One Deathmatch:

The Sandman vs. Supreme - 5/10

Not very good at all. Pure garbage wrestling, they just hit each other with weapons for a short while and then the match ends. Not an exciting match at all.

Round Two Deathmatches: - 0/10

Pogo the Clown vs. Angel

Altar Boy Luke vs. Supreme

These are MISSING. Yes, the round 2 deathmatches are NOT on the DVD. I just don't understand this. XPW relies on these hardcore matches to sell their DVDs, so they go out and film these matches where men put their bodies on the line and then what do they do? They don't even put the matches on the DVD. A real big disappointment. This ruins the DVD and the worst part is that if you look at the `photos' section you can actually see photos of the matches. Why they didn't include the matches I will never understand.

XPW World Championship Match

Webb vs. Shane Douglas - 6/10

It starts off ok but gets very dull and boring. This is what you would expect from a non-hardcore XPW match.

Final; Exploding Ring 40-Foot Scaffold Match

Supreme vs. Angel - 6.5/10

The deathmatch is actually pretty good at the start but that is cut short by the climbing of the scaffold. Yes, the 40 foot fall is sick but why did they put all those explosions? If the explosions weren't there we could have actually seen him fall through the tables and it would have looked way better. another disappointment.

SCORE: 54/90 (60/100)

According to the key I have rated this PPV as `Fair', an average PPV and It is worth a look, not your money. I totally agree with this. Some of the deathmatches are worth a look but do not buy this. Baptized in blood 1 and 2 are much better. Check out my reviews of those also.",1119398400,2,3777,4.287128712871287
7970291,4,B00006JE9Z,"It was a night that would change XPW forever as Webb prepared to defend his XPW World Title against a mystery opponent selected by THe Enterprise's Veronica Caine. No one could have guessed that her choice would be ""The Franchise"" Shane Douglas or what the ramifications would be.
Webb vs. A Mystery Opponent
XPW World Title Match
Not the best match on the video but it is still good. It is very suprising who it is.(3/5)
40-Foot Scaffold Exploding Ring Match
Angel vs. Supreme
XPW King of the Deathmatch Title on the line
The best match on the tape. It is amazing how these two men can fight in this devisting match. No man will be the same after this match.(5/5)
Kaos vs. Chris Hamrick vs. Psicosis
XPW TV-Title Ladder Match
Very entertaning match, if you thought TLC is bad for WWE just wait until you see this one. Very sic move that they put each other throw.(5/5)
Shady/AWC vs. The New Panthers vs. Pogo/Juantastico vs. Mexico's Most Wanted
XPW Tag-Team Championship Match
This is not a bad match but it could have been alot better. but they did crown the first ever XPW tag team championship.
There you have it that is the run down of XPW BIB 3. it is not the best XPW video that I own if you want a good video get Bapized in Blood 1 or 2. But it is still a very good wrestling video. And it ... that it is only 1 hour.",1052092800,2,1326,4.286852589641434
7970292,1,B00006JE9Z,"If this was the whole event it would be 4 stars but this is just a hacked up 1 hour video with only 4 matches, and 1 of those matches doesn't even have a finish, it just cuts to the next match.  Basically your missing out on 6 death matches and a few more undercard matches.  The videos ""king of the deathmatch"" yet they only show 1 out of 7 death matches.  Whats worse is that this hacked up piece of garbage costs the same as other 3 hour XPW events. The only good Baptized in Blood video is the second one.  This one is obviously too short and the first one is just garbage.  Try to pick up the full 3 hour version of this tape and you'll love it, if your in to death match style wrestling.  But stay away from this version, and any other edited 1 hour XPW videos!",1039651200,5,767,3.980392156862745
