2475397,5,B000DZ95IK,"I am so pleased to read that Roseanne season 3 will be coming out to buy in just s few months when season 2 was only just released a month ago. When i was growning up i never enjoyed wathcing Roseanne until a few years ago i was watching re runs of the show and i couldn't stop watching it and i was so excited when it came out to buy on Amazon as i live in Australia and its not available to buy over here. I was also very pleased with the extras on the last disc of season 1 & 2.

Thanks for bringing this out and i hope more come out real soon.",1136678400,9,547,3.7155172413793105

2475468,1,B000DZ95IK,"Do yourself a favor and do NOT purchase the episodes individually here on Amazon video. I purchased the ""Bird Is The Word"" episode on Season 3, and it is the cut up episode like you would see on TV Land. There are scenes missing. This is the butchered version condensed for TV Land's ridiculous commercial breaks and NOT the original ABC uncut episode. Buy the DVD instead so you can be sure to get the full episodes!",1457222400,2,417,4.428571428571429

2475555,5,B000DZ95IK,"This is the best season of Roseanne. I'm one of those people that can watch Roseanne over and over all day, every day, and when I get to this season, sometimes I watch it twice. If you buy ANY season in Roseanne, buy this one! I grew up with Roseanne and this is superb! I'm so glad she's available to purchase on DVD. I just wish Roseanne was on Blu-Ray and they had totally un-edited episodes. This season is perfect, but the 9th season and the 1st season have unnecessary editing, such as cutting out the song for Darlene's baby.",1397779200,,532,4.33
2475556,5,B000DZ95IK,Got this for my daughter for Christmas. She didn't watch much Roseanne growing up but it's fun to watch with her now that she's a little older. I love watching the actors now that they've moved on to other programs and movies. Good to watch when you just want to relax mindlessly!,1396051200,,280,4.403846153846154

2475559,4,B000DZ95IK,"This would have gotten five stars if it weren't for the packaging. I love Roseanne, and since Millcreek took over they have the full, uncut episodes, which is fantastic.

But the packaging! Horrible! This isn't a snap-in DVD case like every other DVD case on the planet. It's pretty much just a plastic box made to look like a DVD case. The DVDs are held in flimsy paper sleeves which are set in the case. But you get what you pay for and that explains why they can sell 3-disc sets for such a low price.",1392076800,,504,4.25

2475561,4,B000DZ95IK,"For the price (I paid $5), I guess I shouldn't complain about the presentation. I love ""Roseanne"" but there are too many commercials when it airs in reruns. Plus, it seems like they cut stuff. When I realized the entire season was only $5 with free shipping (we have Amazon Prime), I ordered it. I've had no problem with any of the DVDs. My only gripe is the DVDs are cheaply stuffed into paper sleeves and packed loosely into the DVD box. Kind of shabby treatment for a great sitcom.",1390348800,,484,4.388888888888889
2475562,2,B000DZ95IK,I think Roseanne is fantastic however my personal DVD's that I received I was unable to watch the last 4 episodes because the DVD's were to scratched up,1389744000,,152,4.464285714285714
2475583,5,B000DZ95IK,"It's Roseanne. The best of the best. I would never disgrace her with a bad review. She is the highlight of the day and brings relief into your life when you feel everything is falling apart. She has you telling yourself, ""I'm not the only one who feels that way. Good. That makes me feel better."" My advice to anyone who hasn't given Rosanne a chance... Give it a chance. Especially if you have financial stuggles and dreams to do better in life. Roseanne has a good heart and she's real, not fake. It may be a 80's to 90's based T.V show, but there is alot of irratating things in this world, especially today, that still happen since then that effects people nerves and emotions and sometimes the best medicine for this emotional stess, (especially if another cup of coffee doesn't cut it) is a episode or more of Roseanne. I will admit that Roseanne has been there for me even if it's on my T.V. Like I mentioned before, if you haven't yet, give it a chance.",1383696000,,961,4.374301675977653

2475586,4,B000DZ95IK,An old show which was poplular when I was growing up. I enjoy watching the old shows. Today I am not really into watching TV because I don't really care for the show. So I watch the old ones which I like.,1379808000,,204,3.880952380952381

2475589,4,B000DZ95IK,This is a great season of Roseanne.  Main reason to get it was to see Shelly Winters as Grandma  Mary and to see Bonnie sing at the barbecue.,1375401600,,141,4.0

2475621,5,B000DZ95IK,"Roseanne is the queen of comedy. The show on its own is quite hilarious. However, I would say this is one of the more funnier seasons. This is when the kids are starting to get a little older so the jokes start to get a little bit more adult. This is before she had that fit with all those anti-depressants and became a complete whack job.",1362355200,,339,4.151515151515151

2475645,5,B000DZ95IK,I grew up watching Roseanne and over the years you just feel part of the family. Watching then with my sibling is such a happy memory for me. I can't get enough of her and Dan they just crack me up.,1357603200,,198,3.8536585365853657

Very Happy in Oregon, Thank You",1350172800,,328,3.984848484848485
2475667,5,B000DZ95IK,"What can I say about Roseanne and this show that hasn't already been said. It was groundbreaking for its time but still endures today.

Roseanne and her family often had a lot of troubles and bad times just like anyone else at the time but even through it all they loved one another and were there for each other when it really counted.

I would have to easily count this among one of my favorite shows all time and am looking forward to getting more of the seasons.

While I wouldn't necessarily recommend younger kids watch the show because of some of the language and what not but I think it would be OK for PG13 and up. It could even be used with some kids as a springboard to discuss family issues, ""growing up"" topics, and even things such as depression.

I recommend that you find it on TV check it out and then buy the seasons because you won't want to miss an episode and they tend to play certain episodes more than others on TV.

2475668,5,B000DZ95IK,"The 411 by Maria:
I LOVE Roseanne it is absolutely one of my favorite shows. Even now all these years later I still laugh at the Connors. My favorite characters were Jackie and Darlene. Whenever they were on, I knew it was going to be funny! You know Darlene is going to have a zinger about absolutely everything!

In Season 3, the kids are getting older and going through growing pains. Becky is dating a guy named Mark which has the Connors worried since he is a ""rebel"".

Roseanne is working as a waitress at Rodbell's much to the disdain of her girls.

There is always the Halloween episode which the Connors do so well.

During this season Roseanne dresses as a man and when her car breaks down has to hang out in a bar with Jackie. She of course plays the role of a dude and even using the men's room Eventually Dan comes to her rescue at the bar before a fight breaks out and kisses a bearded Roseanne. Love Dan dressed as all three Stooges.

What I loved about Roseanne is how real the show was. Maybe all families aren't as funny as the Connors but they all make fun of each other, they all hang out together and most parents do go out of their way to get through to their kids while having fun doing it. In the end, all families have a good time while driving each other crazy. At the bottom of it all there is a whole lot of love!

Another of my favorite characters was Roseanne's Grandmother Shelley Winters. LOVE HER! Great writing and characters you come to either love or hate. Good TV!",1335744000,,1501,4.267605633802817

I highly recommend this witty comedy/drama, enjoy!",1235952000,,297,4.96
2475677,4,B000DZ95IK,"Roseanne still stands as one of the few, if only, sitcoms that accurately portrayed the every day struggles of the working class family.  Even more astounding is how the show didn't compromise any of its sharp, sarcastic humor doing it.

Seasons 1 and 2 of the show are just as spectacular and solid and Season 3 continues its comic stride, making the characters more complex, especially Darlene and Becky as they enter their teenage years.

The episodes are unedited (unlike Season 1 DVD) and there's nary a misstep in the whole bunch.  Every episode is grounded in believable every day situations and the writing is superb.  It never talks down to the audience and as such, the viewer really identifies with each of these richly drawn characters.  Add the fact that the show is scathingly funny and you really have one of my all time favorite sitcoms.

The DVD comes in 4 discs with all 25 of Season 3's episodes.  Some extras on Disc 4 include interviews with Lecy Goranson (Becky) and Laurie Metcalf (Jackie).",1231632000,4,1013,4.748571428571428
2475678,5,B000DZ95IK,This season was great. There are not many shows out there that are so funny yet can be so serious. I plan on getting the entire series.,1229040000,,135,4.037037037037037
2475679,4,B000DZ95IK,"I like the older seasons where the kids are still young. Roseanne seems at ease in front of the camera, although Jackie and Dan make the shows great.",1226966400,,149,4.357142857142857
2475680,2,B000DZ95IK,"There are still scenes missing from this season.  Many of the Roseanne episodes have opening scenes, and there arne't any in this dvd.  I'm disappointed because I bougth this dvd thinking that the episodes are unedited.",1225584000,7,219,5.055555555555555
2475681,4,B000DZ95IK,"First off, the packaging: the DVDs are set up to get out of the way and let you watch the episodes, which is great. They're not really fancy, but one of the things that annoys me is when you have to wade through previews, or several layers of menus, just to watch the episodes. It'd be nice to have a ""Play All"" option, but not necessary.

As for the content of this season, I was surprised to see how well the show held up. I remembered liking the show, and after buying the first season as a trial, I liked it enough to get the second and third. The characters develop well and storylines carry over from one episode to another. The writing was particularly sharp at this point in the run, with great interplay between the characters and a lot of real-life issues for the family to deal with. It's still very much a sitcom, where problems get resolved within half an hour, but at least the resolutions feel plausible, often stretched in the framework of the show to cover several days of time. The hook of this show was always the gritty realism, and that holds up over time.",1212278400,2,1077,4.358208955223881
2475682,5,B000DZ95IK,Roseanne was one of the funniest and best sitcoms on TV. The third season is funny and reminds everyone of their own family growing up.,1209168000,,135,4.44
2475683,5,B000DZ95IK,"Season three of Roseanne doesn't revolve around any particular overriding story arc, but the kids are definitely beginning to grow up. As in almost every season, there are quite a few changes taking place in all of the characters' lives, but the show's greatness mainly lies in the ""real life"" way that each situation is handled and in the raw emotions and interactions of the characters, not in the situations themselves.

""The Test"" is a great season opener as Roseanne and her family wait for the outcome of her home pregnancy test. There are some precious moments, such as when DJ asks if he was an accident, and Roseanne tells him that he was a surprise, the difference being that ""an accident is something that you wouldn't do over again if you had the chance, but a surprise is something you didn't even know you wanted until you got it."" The girls show their selfish side, trying to make a case for not having the baby even before the test is complete. Becky goes as far as asking her mother ""Don't you want me to go to college?"".

The audience gets their first look at the late Glenn Quinn as rebel and smart-mouth Mark Healey in ""Becky, Beds, and Boys"". Mark doesn't even pretend to care what the Conners think when he shows up in a bar, obviously under-aged and the Conners see him there. His answer to their question of how he got in there when he is only 18 is that he has a piece of paper that says he is 21. Becky's concerned parents forbid her to see Mark anymore, but she keeps coming up with ways to see him anyway. I liked how Mark was portrayed in these early seasons when he was ""Rebel Without a Cause"" as opposed to the last three seasons when he was transformed into ""Rebel Without a Clue"". Mark and Becky are the cause of quite a bit of trouble, starting with ""Her Boyfriend's Back"", in which Mark and Becky take Dan's prize Harley out for a ride without telling him. This infuriates Dan who doesn't even bother punishing Becky - his hurt and anger are so deep that he just ignors her for days. Of course, this is far worse than any punishment he could have given her.

In the Halloween episode, DJ decides he wants to dress as a witch this year, and this has Dan very upset as he believes it might mean DJ is having trouble with his own gender identity. You see, Dan believes only girls should dress as witches. Meanwhile, Roseanne decides to find out what it's like to be one of the guys by dressing up in Dan's clothes. She then goes to the Lobo and enjoys conversing with a group of men there on a variety of subjects. You even see Roseanne trying to make conversation with ""another"" man at the urinal. Unfortunately, the restroom scene has been cut from most (if not all) syndicated showings of this episode. We also get another look at Crystal's desperation for male companionship as she shows an interest in Roseanne ( alias Bob) after ""Bob"" pays her some well placed compliments.

""PMS I Love You"" is one of my all time favorites. Dan's birthday party collides with Roseanne's PMS, and she is on a rampage. Dan, being the guest of honor, must ride out the rollercoaster of his wife's emotions, including her blurting out to everyone present that he cried when he saw ""Old Yeller"". In one of those great moments that Dan and Jackie often have together, Dan vents to her privately about how his 39 years have been a blur and he wonders when will it be his turn, when does HE get to have HIS PMS?

Ned Beatty returns as Dan's father, although he is more subdued and less buffoonish than he was in season one when he was first introduced. Dan, however, is still somewhat contemptuous of his dad, and it doesn't make things any better when he finds out that his father is planning to marry one of Roseanne's friends. Matters go from bad to worse when he finds out why - the bride-to-be is pregnant. Dan fears that his new brother/sister will have the same kind of life he had as a child - a life with an unhappy mother and an absentee father who is always on the road.

The other plot developments include Jackie being injured and leaving the police force, Roseanne getting a job at Rodbell's, a diner in the mall, and Dan opening a motorcycle shop of his own. This is truly one of the best seasons of Roseanne, and I highly recommend it. I just wish that there were more extras and interviews in the DVD sets than we have been getting.",1156291200,18,4363,4.400247831474597
2475684,5,B000DZ95IK,I loved watching this when I was younger and my daughter loves it now. I actually bought this because she wanted it for her 10th birthday.,1152489600,3,138,4.346153846153846
2475685,4,B000DZ95IK,"The 1990-1991 third season of ""Roseanne"" was clearly the season where the show really defined itself.  While the first two seasons were good, especially the second, the third was the first Perfect Season, and it was also when the show really started to take risks and tackle heavy issus with amazing skill, all the while remaining laugh out loud hilarious.

The first episode of the season was ""The Test,"" and it was test in many ways.  It was the first episode to air after Roseanne's National Anthem incident, where she pissed off most of America and was called a disgrace by President Bush (quite ironic considering how his son is running the country these days).  Fortunately, the incident was forgotten and ""Roseanne"" continued to roll along smoothly, turning out some of the finest episodes of the whole series.  Who doesn't love ""Like, A Virgin,"" in which Darlene is caught making out with her friend Brian on the couch?  And who could forget the classic Halloween special, ""Trick Or Treat,"" in which Roseanne dresses as a man and is so convincing that she spends most of the night hanging with a group of men at The Lobo.  Probably the funniest episode of the season is ""PMS, I Love You,"" in which Roseanne's PMS collides with Dan's surprise birthday party and disaster ensues.  ""Vegas Interruptus"" is a very notable episode as Roseanne and Dan debate whether to go to Vegas or stay at home so Roseanne won't lose her job.  The episode shows how rare a vacation is for Roseanne and Dan and how Roseanne has to balance the importance of her job over the importance of her trip.  The classic ""Scenes From A Barbecue"" introduced Nana Mary, portrayed brilliantly by the late Shelly Winters.  Also, the late Glenn Quinn makes his first appearance on the show in ""Becky, Beds, and Boys,"" and who could know he'd be sticking around until the very final episode?  Natalie West as Crystal joins the cast in the credits for this season (and the next one, as well, before pretty much vanishing from the series save for the occasional appearance), and other great characters include Bonnie, played by Bonnie Bramlett, and of course Leon, played by Martin Mull.  This season also brings us the Bowman family, including the mother Kathy, who would share some wonderful comic moments with Roseanne before leaving near the end of Season Four.

Season Three is excellent, although not up with the flat out brilliance of Seasons Four and Five (the two finest seasons of the whole run).  It's sad to see how poorly the season is treated in this DVD set.  The episodes are uncut, thank God, but once again, the features are nearly non-existant.  We get 'interviews' with Laurie Metcalf and Lecy Goranson, but these are polluted with so many episode clips we barely get any interview time.  It is worth watching to see Lecy Goranson tear up near the end of her interview (very touching) but overall these are not very exciting.

""Roseanne"" is one of the best shows of all time, and this season is an example of why.  Although the features are again incredibly dissapointing, the episodes are uncut and their quality can not be argued.  Although it falls short when put up against Season Four and Season Five, this is definately not a set you want to pass up!

When I found out they were finally putting Roseanne on DVD I was more than happy.  The quality of the DVD packaging is not too impressive, they split the 4 discs into 2 DVD mini cases and then put those in a bigger case.  Personally I find the mini cases sort of worthless, they do not hold the discs tightly and I find that the DVDs often slide against eachother, easily getting scratched and damaged.  Other than that I think the DVDs are great, they include great bonus material along with interviews and The Best Of that season.  If you are careful with the discs you'll have no problems.  I can not wait to collect all of the seasons.

And Roseanne made it ok to be different, to be crazy, to be fat, to be g-a-y, or to be anything else you wanted to be in a Busch-lead society.

I don't think any other TV ""sitcom"" in the history of modern American culture has touched more lives or portrayed a more realistic nuclear family than ""Roseanne."" My family was ""Roseanne"" and there millions of other ""Roseanne"" families in America, right?

2475691,5,B000DZ95IK,"I'm delighted that the uncut episodes of ROSEANNE are being issued afterthe snafu of the first season. But, WHERE ARE THE COMMENTARIES? Before Anchor Bay decided to release the show on DVD, Roseanne spoke to HomeMediaReatiling ([...]) on March 27, 2004 and said:

""Roseanne said she would be happy to create extras for a DVD package. She's particularly keen on providing commentary tracks and promises to come clean on the notorious behind-the-scenes conflicts between cast and crew. ""I would totally do commentary for it, because I remember almost every show and what was going on,"" she said. ""I would say, `Well, this is where such and such was fired.' There are good stories.""  And yet she maintains, ""We always had fun, the cast. We always had great fun every day on that show.""

We're going into the third season and still no commentaries. You'd think someone who controllled the show so completely as Roseanne did would be proud to talk about her struggles and triumphs on this ground-breaking show.

Wouldn't you all love to hear Roseanne doing commentary either solo or with co-stars John Goodman or Laurie Metcalfe? Hope Roseanne is listening.",1140998400,19,1152,4.984375

Thay are bad picture quality! They've changed the intro, the intro font and everything. Original songs not used, etc. This is a CHEAP knock-off. You get what you pay for.",1480896000,2,367,4.575757575757576
