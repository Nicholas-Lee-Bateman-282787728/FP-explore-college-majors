If you're a fan of Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Carolla, and appreciate guy humor then this is worth a watch.",1413331200,,278,3.8596491228070176

7999621,5,B0000D0YXM,"I recently bought the second 3 disc set of Season One. I loved it, I'm a huge fan of Jimmy and Adam and especially love the juggies. I truly hope that the next 3 seasons are released sometime soon.",1069891200,2,197,4.076923076923077
7999622,4,B0000D0YXM,"The material on these 3 discs would have easily fit onto just 2 discs and might have resulted in a cheaper selling price, but it was not to be.
The Man Show is still funniest with Kimmel and Carolla -- far, far funnier than the two new hosts that took over for Season Five.  This DVD set offers 12 episodes and a few bonus features, but the bonus features are nothing to get too excited about.
Language that would have been bleeped out for TV is now heard in all its glory, but there is only a scant amount of it.  Nothing to get all worked up about.
I really hope they plan on releasing Seasons 2-4 someday soon.",1068508800,3,613,4.142857142857143
