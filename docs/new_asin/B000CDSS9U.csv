There is now a new and entirely fresh perspective for our American epic, the Lewis and Clark Expedition.  The perspective of telling the Expedition's history through the filming of the present-day construction of Camp River Dubois, an interpretation of the first encampment.  The video documentary, ""Camp River Dubois"" (produced by Solstice Productions, St. Louis, MO), follows Steve Lailoff as he constructs the interpretation on behalf of the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency.

Also, this documentary has special appearances by Robert J. Moore, Jr., Historian, National Park Service, and Michael Haynes, the foremost Expedition artist.  These two professionals are largely responsible for the  face of the 2003-2006 National Bicentennial commemoration and the  character of its interpretation, now unfolding west across the country and then back.

""Camp River Dubois"" offers many rich levels of highly intelligent insight, both in the present day and in the historic.  These insights include current issues surrounding the construction of an interpretation of a historical structure, such as sensitivity to which trees should be harvested for building materials.  Following near daily construction at the Lewis and Clark State Historic Site (Hartford, IL), the documentary provides many additional and unique insights into the lives and personalities of the actual historical figures who built the original at the onset of Winter 1803.  All of this occurs in a natural setting opposite the mouth of the Missouri River, as did the encampment.

Historic Camp River Dubois, the place of final planning, preparations and commencement of exploration (the ""Point of departure""), is an undersold story of the preparatory phase of the Expedition.  This documentary offers insights into why the Expedition ultimately was so successful, in part, due to its activities at the Camp.
