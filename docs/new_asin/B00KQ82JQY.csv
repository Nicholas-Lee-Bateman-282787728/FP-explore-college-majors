6440369,5,B00KQ82JQY,"My kids, ages 2 and 4, absolutely love this batman. It is funny, a ton of one liners, and not frightening for little ones. There are SO many characters! Even Aquaman is OUTRAGEOUS!
  This was recently taken off of Netflix, and buying the series is a no brainer. Over 9 hours in season one, as well as season two.
  The animation is very well done, not all Pixar/overdone. It's clean, old school bright and colorful scenes.
  I would check out some clips on YouTube and if you like the style you will not be disappointed.",1433635200,2,520,4.421052631578948

6440372,5,B00KQ82JQY,"This was a great series! I've always enjoyed Batman's various media interpretations, and this was an animated throwback to his Silver Age comic adventures. For the past several years we've some more serious depictions of superheroes; nevertheless, I equally appreciate light-hearted comedic adventure shows featuring superheroes, even when such series inject some serious sides to them. Such is the case in this Season of Batman: The Brave and The Bold with the episodes featuring the Starro Invasion, The Flash, and The Doom Patrol. Finally, I love how producer James Tucker showed the world just great Plastic Man and Aquaman are as characters.",1468800000,,646,5.3431372549019605

6440376,5,B00KQ82JQY,"Season Two was just as good as Season One, if not better !  Lots of somewhat funny episodes, evoking the comics of the 1950s, but surprisingly handles the demise of heroes in valiant ways, and even for younger viewers to understand and grasp.  Whereas Season One showed the death of the Blue Beetle (Ted Kord) in flashbacks, and again in 'Menace of the Madnicks', you also see a flashback to the death of the Silver Age Black Canary, as well as the death of Thomas and Martha Wayne in 'Chill of The Night'--this episode ALONE is worth purchasing this set, as it casts Adam West and Julie Newmar and Bruce's parents, and both Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy as Spectre and Phantom Stranger, and even had Richard Moll from B: TAS in a supporting role, providing a bit of a reunion, as this episode was written by Paul Dini. Also, you see the tragic and heroic deaths of The Doom Patrol (no Beast Boy, but there is a reference to him), and of B'wana Beast, as he and Vixen are cast as a couple, but he sacrifices himself in 'Starro Part 2', and as a true partner, she sensed when he had given himself up in saving Earth.  For a good laugh,
Emperor Joker' rocks !  Also, like the reference to many of the legendary comedians as his henchmen.  All in all, definitely worth the purchase: have had for about a month, and at least one disc from this collection has been in my DVD player at any time !",1459296000,2,1389,4.326923076923077

6440379,5,B00KQ82JQY,I liked this series - I actually got this for the episode: Matches Malone - because I LOVED the Birds of Prey song/dance part. :) The episode was on season 3! it was okay anyway; Chill of the Night was a great episode as well.,1453075200,,226,4.044444444444444

8660770,5,B00KQ82JQY,"This zany Batman series is a love song to all things DC (especially the more off-beat aspects of DC).  If you are anything like me, you're probably sick of DC trying to be dark and angsty and messing around with the personalities of classic characters in order to achieve this.  Batman: The Brave and The Bold strikes exactly the right balance by having a sort of dark and gritty ""noir"" style Batman in DC's signature absurd world system.  Also, it's a stellar show to have around when there are small children present.  You have to love family friendly TV that isn't obnoxious to all the adults in the room!",1511136000,,608,4.5504587155963305
