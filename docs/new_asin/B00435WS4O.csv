8414211,5,B00435WS4O,"""Flame is perhaps the most controversial film every made in Africa - certainly the only one to be seized by the police during editing on the grounds it was subversive and pornographic. Ingrid Sinclair's moving tribute to women fighters in the Zimbabwean liberation struggle aroused the ire of war veterans and the military because it revealed that officers sometimes used female recruits as ""comfort women"". Flame's real crime may have been that exposed not just past abuses but continuing divisions within Zimbabwean society, especially against women and peasants.

Flame is the story of two close friends, Florence, impulsive and brave, and Nyasha, scholarly and cautious, whose involvement in the war of liberation leads to very different outcomes. In 1975, while still teenagers they join the Chimurenga, the Zimbabwean freedom struggle, at its camps in Mozambique; Florence assumes the nom de guerre, Flame, while Nyasha chooses, Liberty. We watch as they grow into confident women, training as soldiers and learning about their political rights.

After independence, Flame, like so many others, is left behind by the new society in rural backwardness. She drifts to the city for work and reunites with Liberty, now a well-paid executive secretary, and some old comrades. As they watch Zimbabwe's new leadership on television, hey decide, ""a luta continua,"" the struggle continues.""",1455753600,,1387,5.416666666666667
