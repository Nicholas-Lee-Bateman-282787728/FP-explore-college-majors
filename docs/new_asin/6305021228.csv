7880902,4,6305021228,"I didn't remember the title of this film, only the story, because I saw it with my mother, as a small child. Seeing it again, I can understand why the adventure of it was so appealing to me at that age.",1394064000,,202,3.951219512195122

7880904,5,6305021228,"""John and Julie"" evokes memories of my own childhood, seeing this sweet, wonderful comedy on TV in the sixties. A simple story, of two British children, separated from their families, enroute to London to see Elizabeth crowned, the film offers a wide variety of British performers (including Wilfrid Hyde-White and a young Peter Sellers), as 'typical', if often eccentric, countrymen who aid the children on their way. Colin Gibson and Lesley Dudley, as the children, are completely natural, and captivating (Dudley pouts so wistfully that you want to hug her!)

With a beautiful score (highlighted by a trumpet solo), stock footage of the actual event blended in with the story, and a joyous finale that could turn the most dedicated 'Yank' into an Anglophile, ""John and Julie"" is a small gem, something the entire family will love!",1156896000,3,833,5.08029197080292
7880905,5,6305021228,"I ordered a copy of this video on behalf of my father as a Christmas present for my Mum. I knew that from what I have been told in the past, this was a very good film (and I was proved right). My Mum and her twin brother were named John and Julie after the film as my Grandparents loved the film so much...it even made her cry to receive it, even before seeing the film again for the first time since a child (now in her latter 40's). Now, this film in the 50's was good enough to name their children after...I was named after one of te disciples in the Bible...What does that tell you? Make sure you see this...and I can confirm that any US or Canadian video will play on UK machines but not the other way round (sounds like Alvin and the Chipmunks there).",1104710400,3,757,4.087248322147651
