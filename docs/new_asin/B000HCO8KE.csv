2634318,4,B000HCO8KE,"I just ordered this item so I can't give a review to the set. I did notice in most of the reviews I've read no one has mentioned special features and extras. Does anyone know what this set contains besides the basic episodes?

I watched Andromeda when it began and was very intrigued. As I recall, both the idea fro Andromeda and for Earth: Final Conflict, both pre-dated Star Trek. Both series suffered a tragic problem when Roddenberry died. Both series became ""lost"" in writing and theme. Andromeda recovered in its final season, and like Babylon 5, tied the storyline from beginning to end.

Andromeda's biggest problem was budget. The writers and plots were amazing. The crew was terrific, but after the first season Andromeda started to recycle special effects. I still remember the same line of soldiers used in four different episodes in two seasons. At times it bordered on the stock footage fiasco of the original Battlestar Galactica. Despite this problem, the series has many huge high points. It also featured a wide range of guest stars including Grace Park (BSG), Emmanuelle Vaugier (Smallville, Saw 2), Michael Dorn, Tony Todd, Michael Shanks and numerous others.

  Andromeda is the original space opera. It is as optimistic as the Star Trek universe, but stacks the odds against the crew from the very beginning. Watch Andromeda with an open mind.",1163980800,44,1365,4.943231441048035
2634319,5,B000HCO8KE,"I only saw a few episodes of this ""Gene Roddenberry Gem that stayed on his desk long after he died"", during its original run, but what I saw intrigued me.  So much so I bought the novelized version of the pilot in a used book store.  But the discs I thought were coing out too slow (2 discs of 1 season at a time THEN a full season after the final set) and too pricey (even here on Amazon).  But when I saw the deal for the Complete Set was much better than the sum of its parts, I couldn't resist it.  Unfortunately, dummy me spent a gift certificate I had gotten at the same time on another order, but still this is the BIGGEST MEGASET of a series I have ever bought.  Now I am going to take the time and watch all these, season by season, so I can finally understand the plots and counterplots (and counterplotz for that matter ;-)) that I missed earlier this decade.  I am especially eager to see the first episode where we see Andromeda's physical body working outside the computer let alone the ""transition"" in Trance.  If you bought the other sets or subsets, just complete your collection whichever way is easiest, if you waited to buy all 5 ""complete sets"", buy THIS set instead.  Now to sit back and (pardon my Arthur Clarke) time for a ""Renedesvous With Rommie"" ;-)",1160179200,54,1276,4.309623430962343
2634320,5,B000HCO8KE,"Had no idea the Andromeda series was coming out ""bundled"" together in one box set collection. Was at Best Buy looking at other items and by chance stumbled across the collection. FYI - Best Buy is selling it for $99

Picked it up as a FY'06 Christmas present for the husband. Regardless if you buy it here or through Best Buy, the price is a great bargain for those who can wait for the box set rather than purchase each season individually.

Some of you may wonder about Kevin Sorbo stepping out of the Hercules role well enough to define himself as a different character. He does a great job in the series and is convincing as Dylan Hunt.

What I like about the series is each episode acts as a stand alone with a clear story to tell. Yet, each episode is woven into the entire series and like a puzzle, the pieces fit. My husband and I were hooked from episode 1.

The boxed collection is attractive and the thin paks will not monopolize an entire DVD shelf. The thin paks, when in the box together, display the Andromeda Ascendent on the spinal cover.

Excellent series. This is a good deal.",1160006400,42,1095,4.374384236453202
2634321,5,B000HCO8KE,"I was pleasantly surprised by this. The product details don't mention it at all, but this IS a ""thinpaks"" release.

Placed sideways on your bookshelf it will take up less room than the First Season box set. The artwork on the outer sleeves of each thinpak is the same as previous releases. Artwork on the spines of all thinpaks, when viewed together, portray the Amdromeda Ascendant comin' at ya! The discs in this collection are single-sided, unlike the double-sided discs in the 2-5 season box sets. The content and episodes on the discs are the same as in previous releases.

However, if you didn't like the double-sided discs of the season 2-5 sets and would like the space this set will save on your shelves, it IS worth getting.",1159920000,230,998,4.676136363636363
2634322,4,B000HCO8KE,"This is by no means another Star Trek.  In many ways it's more fun minus the tech babble you'd get on any Trek show.  Kevin Sorbo is playing this shoot from the hip character like Han Solo.  Why didn't it become a hit like the others?  The writing wasn't always there like Hercules but it was still a good series.

If you like Kevin Sorbo and the cast of characters it's not a complete waste of time.  Andromeda is much better than Roddenberry's  Earth: Final Conflict series.  In this starship the crew does go to other worlds and deals with alien threats in a manner Captain Kirk would be proud of.",1156636800,17,600,4.342342342342342
2634323,1,B000HCO8KE,I bought this collection FROM Amazon (NEW) as a present for myself about 3 years ago since I am a fan of the show. Over time the DVDs have gone bad with squirls and discolouring on their surface. I researched this on the internet and there is no solution to the problem. It is a matter of poor quality DVDs. I HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF. These DVDs are no longer read by DVD players and I have tried more than one.,1358640000,4,408,4.049382716049383
2634324,5,B000HCO8KE,"I've always found Kevin Sorbo to be a great actor, and I've enjoyed seeing him as Hercules in ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys."" When I first watched ""Andromeda,"" I felt alittle uneasy because I seemed to perceive the show with a bias that Sorbo would be returning as Hercules in the future. How dense was I? But then, I discovered with a shock that I actually ended up enjoying this show and its interesting stories and actually ended up falling for Trance Gemini (such a mystery that girl portrayed). Great cast, good themes, but sometimes writings can be off here and there. However, I did found myself imagining to be part of that universe - it is such an interesting life.

As for the set, I found it to be useful set with interesting features but it appears to be a bit pricey at the moment (I brought it back in 2009, though). I would recommend another and new release of this DVD sets. It's a great collection to have.",1355443200,3,927,4.485207100591716
2634325,5,B000HCO8KE,"Andromeda... we've watched this from start to end, twice.  It never gets old.  This is like Star Trek, just can't get enough.  Big fans.",1348790400,5,136,4.583333333333333
2634326,4,B000HCO8KE,"I remember watching this show back when it was airing on TV over 10 years ago.  Gene Roddenberry, father of Star Trek, re-envisioned his view of the future and created an entire new Sci-Fi  saga.  The show is based upon notes that Gene Roddenberry had written back in 1976, found after his death I believe.  Andromeda is a show that has its share of good and bad moments, sometimes even falling prey to bad writing.  Overall the show does what it sets out to do, and that is entertain you.  Below I've broken the review down into a review of the show itself, and a review of the box-set.

*ANDROMEDA: THE SHOW
The biggest effort to Andromeda can be felt in season 1 and 2.  The storyline is very focused, and flows together nicely.  Kevin Sorbo aka Captain Dylan Hunt aka Hercules! ends up being trapped for over 300 years in a Black Hole, only to be salvaged out thinking his sentient ship (Andromeda) was abandoned.  With the once proud Commonwealth long gone, Captain Hunt sets out on a crusade to restore the Commonwealth and order to the known universe.

With his newly found crew the show follows his quest to restore peace one episode at a time.  Season 1 and 2 are strongly focus on this but once we hit season 3 things start to take a turn for the worse.  The show begins to suffer from clear writing problems and begins to lose focus.  Episodes still remain very entertaining but the focus seems to have been lost , replace by a multitude of subplots.  Season 4 slowly  re-focused itself only to toss viewers into the infamous Season 5.

Season 5 is a love or hate season from what I have seen all over forums.  You either will love it, or wonder if you ended up with a completely different show.  Season 5 moves slowly and feels like the writers were just running with a random idea.  The sci-fi aspect seemed to take a back seat for more of a  Small-Town Western, mystery feeling.  If you stick with it however, pieces begin to fall into place and leads into some of the best episodes of the series(in my opinion).  Overall I would give Andromeda as a show **4 stars**.  It would easily entertain sci-fi fans, and despite season 3 and 4 having some bad moments the show never loses its entertainment value.

*ANDROMEDA: THE BOXSET
This is easily one of my favorite box-set's I own.  It is a very simple piece that has been crafted exceptionally well.  I've owned mine over 3 years and it has held together exceptionally well.  The set comes in a cardboard case with artwork around it (as seen in the sample image).  All the episodes are spread out over slim-case DVD packs, 2 disks per set.  When placed in proper order the slim-cases create an image of the Andromeda.

Each disk contains a variety of content besides the standard episodes.  Interviews, terminology, articles about the lore, details about the various ships, bloopers, behind the scenes, alternative takes, deleted scenes.. it is all here.  It is a mammoth package that feels truly like a 100% complete collection.  It is great that after you watch a few episodes, you can then look at alternative dialog options or scenes for that episode.  The bloopers can be very funny!  Some of my favorites are when Kevin Sorbo accidentally becomes ""Hercules"" and tends to break the set pieces(Example: Sorbo grabbed a console and acted as if they just impacted something.  In doing so he broke the console!  Next thing you know everyone starts going HERCULES Hercules!! )  The behind the scenes shows you how much care went into the show and just how down to Earth the cast and crew were.

OVERALL Andromeda as a show gets 4 stars... the Slipstream set itself gets 5 stars easily!  If you can find one at a reasonable price it is worth it.  If not, the current box-set's being offered are a good alternative if you simply want to experience the show.",1315353600,5,3818,4.554411764705883
2634327,5,B000HCO8KE,"It's really disappointing to realize this set is no longer available.  I really want to buy it, but I can't find it anywhere.  The ""New"" ones that are currently available through the Marketplace vendors are not the same packaging as shown here and I cannot even verify they are legitimate.  Please give us a way to buy this set.",1302998400,3,328,4.52542372881356
2634328,3,B000HCO8KE,"I did not see this show when it was on television. I purchased the DVDs based largely on the positive ratings here. I regret having bought this show. Having bought it, I regret spending the time watching it. It was so uninteresting it took me three years to watch all five seasons.

In episode 4-20 of Andromeda, the character Harper asks the question: ""Who writes this crap?"" If we could answer that question, we would know who to blame for the shortcomings of ""Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda.""  This series was ruined by bad writing. The show had a great cast and crew, but without well-written screenplays, the show never realized its potential. While watching this series, I kept thinking about how interesting it COULD have been. The dialogue on this show is appalling! The dialogue is clich&eacute;, puerile, and annoying.

There is so much about Andromeda that is good: concept, cast, sets, costumes, special effects, makeup, lighting, stunt coordination, et cetera. Considering the low budget of this show, the production values are admirably high. Unfortunately, poor scripts and sub-par direction spoiled what could have been a very good show.

If we were to give Babylon 5 a five-star rating, then ""Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda"" would only rate two stars. I gave it three stars to acknowledge the good job done by the cast and crew. It is a pity that all of their hard work was not supported by better scripts and directors.

If you enjoyed this show on television, then you will enjoy owning this DVD set. The quality of the DVDs is quite good, the DVDs are loaded with special features, and (with one exception) all DVDs played flawlessly. As with all Roddenberry/Barrett productions (including Star Trek, Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and Enterprise), this DVD set was absurdly overpriced.

After one of the DVDs would not play, I found that someone had used a pen to write a little message on the data side (including a date just one month prior to my purchase). Obviously, this graffito was either made at the factory or I was sold a used set of DVDs (although it came to me shrink-wrapped). Fortunately, I was able to remove the ink with an alcohol swab.

Out of five seasons (110 episodes), I would say that there are ten good episodes. With a few notable exceptions, Seasons 1 through 3 are mostly bad. The series improved notably in Season 4. Season 5 was totally superfluous.

Since this show is called ""Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda,"" it is only fitting that it should be compared to Gene Roddenberry's original ""Star Trek"" series. Sadly, there was not a single Andromeda episode that was as good as any episode of the original ""Star Trek."" Most (but not all) of the writers of Andromeda didn't have a clue how to craft an interesting story for television. In the book ""The Making of Star Trek,"" Gene Roddenberry explains what makes a good television story. Obviously, most of the writers of ""Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda"" never bothered to read that book.

Does anyone else remember ""Genesis II"" (1973) and ""Planet Earth"" (1974)? Both of those Gene Roddenberry shows were based on the premise that the main character (""Dylan Hunt"" in both shows) was frozen in time, and later awakened after the fall of civilization. In one of the special features, Kevin Sorbo explains that Andromeda was based in part on these pilots, and in part on notes found by Gene Roddenberry's wife following his death. As I watched this show, I wondered if Gene would be embarrassed having his name associated with it.

The cast of the show is good. Kevin Sorbo (as the star) was an excellent choice (by Majel Barrett) to play the captain of the Andromeda. The smartest and most interesting character (Tyr Anasazi) is played to perfection by Keith Hamilton Cobb (who is the best actor in the series). Tragically, instead of writing clever plots for this character, the show's writers and directors pushed him into the background. Lexa Doig is a perfect choice to play the avatar of the warship Andromeda. I am sure that many fans tune in just to enjoy her beauty. Tragically, the writers turned her into ""Xena, Warrior Princess"" instead of writing clever parts and dialogue for her (after all, she is supposed to be the smartest one on the ship!). Laura Bertram is thoroughly charming, but her character was disgracefully neglected through most of the show. Surprisingly, Brandy Ledford (Season 5 only) turned in better (and more believable) performances than any of the other cast members. The other actors in the series are certainly adequate for their roles. Overall, the cast is very good; they are in no way to blame for the poor quality of many of the episodes.

Peter DeLuise (who had so much to do with the success of Stargate SG 1) directed the best shows by far. In Season 3, I saw the first episode directed by Peter DeLuise (The Illusion of Majesty). It wasn't Akira Kurosawa, but this episode was much, much more entertaining than most previous episodes. Mr. DeLuise directed several more episodes after this (eight total, I think) - - - and all of them were superior to the run-of-the-mill Andromeda episodes. This just proves how this series could have been improved by hiring talented television directors like Mr. DeLuise.

What the series lacks in imaginative and interesting stories, it more than makes up for with numerous fight scenes. In fact, the whole series may be an excuse to choreograph and film fight scenes. For me, this became overly repetitive and boring. And, (come on!) considering the technology at their disposal, fist-fights and line-of-sight blaster battles are quite stupid. Quite frankly, considering the body count, Captain Dylan Hunt and crew are homicidal maniacs. Tell me: How come Dylan's force lance does not have ""stun"" setting? Is it really necessary to kill so many people?

While the costumes are often impressive, why is everyone always dressed in leather? Did some executive producer's nephew own a local fetish store? Many of costumes would be more appropriate on ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys."" Really! What's with all the leather? The worst costume award goes to Rommie's (Lexa Doig's) new costume in Season 5. When I first saw it I thought it was a sight gag. Why in the world would anyone dress the lovely (and absolutely perfect) Lexa Doig up in a costume with a Double-D chest?! I suppose it just proves who the target audience is for this show: giggling twelve-year-old boys.

Before you watch Andromeda, check out any or all of the following (better) shows available on DVD: Firefly, Babylon 5, The 4400, the original Outer Limits, the original Twilight Zone, Stargate SG 1, and Roswell.",1268524800,3,6661,4.8936170212765955
2634329,5,B000HCO8KE,"Another marvelous creation from the mind of Gene Roddenberry. If you are reading this you probably know about this series and what it's all about, well, if you have any doubts about if this DVD set is worth the $ have no more, it is :-)
Beware though, there are some sellers hera at Amazon charging more than $200 and at this point I would really consider looking somewhere else...
Enjoy.",1267747200,2,388,4.47887323943662
2634330,4,B000HCO8KE,"In a nutshell, the first two seasons are worth it, the third is a disaster (but intriguing at times) and the final two keep trying to decide what they want to be. The show began with Roddenberry's vision, but it's a very different take on the universe than the Star Trek franchise and it seems that the Sorbo and the other onsite producers thought continuity is overrated.

That said, this is an enjoyable program because the characters themselves are so engaging. They aren't your run-of-the-mill goody two shoes types. Sometimes they are bad or wrong or just plain stupid, but you (almost always) end up rooting for them in the end.

The set is a little pricey for people who don't know what they're in for but if you like Kevin Sorbo, Gene Roddenberry, or slightly cheesy SciFi in the Firefly or Farscape mode, it's worth the price of admission.",1264809600,2,848,4.6466666666666665

I am so glad I got it early for somewhat less ~ as it is the best way to get the whole series ~ as there is NOT a *more complete* series-and-extras box-set. This is easily my favorite box-set of my favorite sci-fi. *Andromeda* has all the aspects of why I ever got into sci-fi ~ whether via books, movies or even games. There is ongoing action, adventure and mystery presented by great actors, scenes and settings with entertaining drama and dialog [in my view]. The colorful scenery and fantastic futuristic hi-tech are attention-locking and just really cool [in my view]. Some folks I know, who are especially into sci-fi, treasure this series as I do ~ an almost hidden treasure, considering its excellent overall quality. I especially appreciate the flowing balance of human and alien races and the way the ability and nature of each *Andromeda* crew member fits with each other. The entertainment has lessons and even some philosophy woven into it ~ and even upon repeat viewing, I see subtle clues and cues as well as the direct ones easy to see. *Andromeda* is very well-balanced via various *good*, *odd* and *bad* aspects ~ overall via the theme of a *do-gooder* [but smart and tough] Captain who gets tossed into a quite later and much darker universe ~ and via the various human and alien beings who have a mix of *fair* and *dark* aspects. Even the Captain's crewmates vary in *fair* and *dark* aspects [motives and moves] ~ even if they just about all do *look good*, whether in person or in motion. This fine-artistic and well-crafted box-set has *special feature* content provided alongside the five yearly seasons of episodes via the fifty DVD set. So, there is plenty of background provided to the *Andromeda* universe ~ the history of its various humans and aliens using their various sci-fi hi-tech artifacts ~ as Andromeda and her Captain and crew never give-up in their *QUEST* to *Push back the Night to restore the Light of the Systems Commonwealth* ~~~",1250380800,,2148,4.761394101876675

2634335,4,B000HCO8KE,"I'll review this product in 2 parts: 1) Andromeda as a series 2) The SLIPSTREAM collection DVDs.  Andromeda is the standard episodic version of futuristic scifi.  It's action orientated with numerous special effects and some outlandish aliens. In true Gene Roddenberry fashion, the captain is the hero and always gets the girl. Apparently all female species in the universe are beautiful, love to show cleavage and have no morals. But it does make for good storytelling. The cast here is top notch. Lisa Ryder, Gordon Woolvett, Laura Bertram, Keith Cobb, Steve Bacic and the incredible Lexa Doig all are accomplished and polished entertainers. Kevin Sorbo is a good lead but at times is a bit too stoic. The episodes each tell their own story but there are also a couple of story arcs that run the length of the series. Characters come and go throughtout. The problems this show encountered were a vast - vast overuse of flashbacks and heavily overused stock footage. The editing leaves much to be desired, there are actually scenes where cast got out of character before the cameras stopped rolling. This is slightly above average scifi. 2) The Slipstream collection is well packaged and compact. The special features are tiresome and often duplicated. There are even deleted scenes and bloopers on the wrong discs. Interviews are repeated and sometimes serious, most times not. An uninspired production at best.
 If you take anything from this series, it should be an appreciation for the acting chops of Lisa Ryder, Lexa Doig, Steve Bacic and the very likable Gordon Woolvett. I also was amazed that Laura Bertram spent almost 1800 hours in the makeup chair during the 5 year run. I give the series a grade of ""B+"", the DVD collection a ""C"".",1237334400,3,1744,4.905084745762712

With only half the budget of shows like ""Farscape"", this show brought the action. The characters were interesting..

The show starts off showcasing brilliant special effects, and incredibly deep plot. From the first episode, the series grips the viewer and immerses them within a world of intrigue and deception. Our ""hero"" for this story is Kevin Sorbo (of Hercules), and seems to be a perfect fit.

As the story unfolds and the episodes roll by, the secondary characters come to life with deep development for each and every person. Quickly it feels like there is no ""lead"" character as much as the entire crew of the Andromeda is the ""main"" character, and with each of the parts being played so well by so many talented actors this is no surprise.

I believe that almost anybody could enjoy Andromeda, it's probably one of the Sci-Fi genre's best kept secrets.

2634345,2,B000HCO8KE,"I just finished watching this entire series, and I have to say I'm very disappointed.

I had read the basic plot synopsis on wikipedia, and I was intrigued and in the market for a new sci-fi series.  I hadn't seen any of Andromeda on TV, so bought this set to give it a shot.

Upon reflection, it wasn't worth the time to watch it.  I kept hoping that the writing would improve, but it didn't.  The initial setting and plot - a super-advanced warship essentially slipping forward in time to a sci-fi dark age - is an awesome concept.  But the stories never lived up to their potential, and some episodes had some fairly mind boggling inconsistencies with one another.

The acting, I thought, was fine, and the special effects were fairly good for a TV Sci fi series.  The DVDs are well packaged with plenty of extras.  These elements of the show made me rate the series with two stars, instead of one.  I will note that this DVD set has the annoying penchant for putting only 2-3 episodes per disk, when they could easily fit 4-5 and cut down on space.  As noted by another reviewer, though, they do use thinpaks, so there is that.

If you're looking for a good sci fi fix, I really recommend you look elsewhere, as this series was disappointing.",1207699200,5,1246,4.440528634361233

2634347,5,B000HCO8KE,"I picked up Andromeda on a whim.  I had heard good things about the series, and I thought I would give it a try - especially with how cheaply I was getting off buying this set.
I have to say that I really liked the series.  I found my self itching to see the next episode.  I have to admit, as I watched, I read a little off some of the forums out of interest in the show and why things went the way they did.  I have to agree that in the 5th season (and tail-end of the 4th season) the show changed direction, but when all is said and done, I really liked the series, and I find myself sad that I am done with it.  Who knows, maybe I will pick up one of the books and see how they are...",1207526400,2,688,3.75
2634348,5,B000HCO8KE,"Never had the opportunity to follow this series while it was on TV, but I did see a few episodes which I enjoyed...so when it became available at a good price, I took a chance. It was well worth the price and more! Great characters, Sorbo is perfect as Captain Dylan Hunt and the rest of the cast mesmerized me...Trance Gemini has to be one of my all-time favorite characters! This is a series that really must be viewed from the beginning to truly appreciate the story-line! If you like the genre, this is a must-buy! Nice extras as well, lots of bloopers and interviews with the cast and crew! Five stars!!",1207440000,,608,4.4375
2634349,5,B000HCO8KE,"Based on a combination of two original ideas from the late Gene Roddenberry,Andromeda gives us another unique take on the Sci-Fi universe,and a wonderful trip it is.
There are so many plot turns and twists in this five year,110 ep show,that it is impossible in the space provided here to give you a proper synopsis of the show in any great detail.
The series story is based around the rescuing of the star ship Andromeda and its'Captain,Dylan Hunt,from the event horizon of a black hole. 300 years have gone by and the Commonwealth that he served during his lifetime has now fallen to two main factions,Nietzscheans and the Magog. Dylan sets out,with the help of the crew that rescued him,to restore the Commonwealth...quite the monumental task. That crew is made up of one Bekka Valentine(the captain of her own ship the Eureeka Maru),Tyr Anastazi(a Nietzschean),Trance Gemini(species unknown-purple,with a tail!),Rev Bem(a Magog seeking enlightenment and the true path)and Seamus Harper the genius with the wise cracking attitude(like a smart Morey Amsterdam).Along with the important main plots that move each show and the story arc along are the many sub plots involving each crew member and how their lives past,present and future, effect and fit into the entire puzzle. The story arc in toto is a gloriously rich tapestry of human endeavour and of good trying to triumph over evil,and some of the story line's journeys simply amaze. It is a smartly written series and the CGI effects throughout the series are nothing less than spectacular. Kevin Sorbo who plays Capt. Dylan Hunt is an extremely likable actor and plays his character with much elan and pinache. He is the star but that it is an ensemble work there is no doubt. Mr. Sorbo is always there and hits his marks and really anchors the show when it's most needed but the shows' main strength is what every actor in this show brings to the table...and none of them at any time fail to disappoint. There may be eps that are better than others,which is de rigeur of ANY show Sci-Fi or otherwise,but the acting throughout this series is first class all the way.
The shows themselves were shot on a no more than SIX day shooting schedule and sometimes were completed in FOUR! Budgets were apparently very tight throughout this series shooting which is all the more amazing when you look at the finished product. This was a Cadillac show produced on a Volkswagen budget. The show was shot in Vancouver,B.C. and from what little of the special features in this set I've seen there is consistently high praise for the crew and staff by the actors and production staff behind the cameras. And speaking of special features this set is packed with them. I do not believe there is anything that has been left out. You will learn everything about specific sets,set ups,make up,the camera crew,the producers and directors,the music and on and on and on. My favourites are the multi blooper reels for the crew in general,each crew member and even special guest stars! All 110 eps along with their trailers are here and in beautifully transferred(clean and crisp) widescreen formats.
This show was co-backed by Tribune Entertainment(U.S.) and Global-CanWest(Canada) which ran concurrently on both their respective networks. Global treated their product with what I can only describe as sheer neglect and disinterest. They ran the show on a fairly consistent basis for about the first two years in a regular time slot. After this Andromeda's appearances on the network were sporadic at best. You just never knew when and where the show would surface on its' schedule as it would preempt it for(it seemed) the local weather report! And of course they would never tell you why it was not showing or when it would reappear. I eventually gave up about a quarter of the way through the fourth season because I had totally missed so many eps of the third season. I understand now that Global was reluctant to carry on with Andromeda past the fourth year. It was only Tribunes' insistence that won the day. Thank goodness someone had the guts and vision to take it further.
I am glad also to see this set is now available on both Amazon.com and .ca. I however had to get my set from another source than Amazon. A few months back I did try to order it from Amazon.com when it was available. However a couple of months later(no explanation has ever been forthcoming) I was no nearer to getting a copy than before so I had to cancel my order. By this time Amazon.ca had also run out of copies so I ordered the first season set only from them. It was defective!(my luck).I returned that. So I got my set from elsewhere and my luck again there was a defect in some of the first season disks. I phoned ADV video in Texas which makes and distributes this set and got one Lisa,in the customer service department there. She,with no questions,sent me replacement discs for the set. Absolutely wonderful service. So if anyone ever has a problem that can't be resolved through Amazon(which is RARE!)then by all means contact Lisa at ADV Ent.(1-800-282-7202,ext#1).It's an extra bit of peace of mind to know that not only are you dealing with one of the best consumer oriented companies around in Amazon.ca. and .com,but also the very makers of the product you are buying!
In conclusion no fan of this show or of just good,intelligent and smartly written series in general,will be disappointed in their choice to buy this set. With 110 eps packed into 50 discs(two to a thin pack-less chance of damage),filled to the brim with special features and in their gloriously transferred widescreen format,Andromeda will not fail on any level to disappoint.

2634350,5,B000HCO8KE,"Good Series, even the last season, which was a little worse then the rest.  Worth getting as the set.  The The individual packages take up a lot of shelf space.  This set takes up about the same space as the first and second season box sets.  Also Alot cheaper then getting the season box sets",1206230400,,293,4.2727272727272725
2634351,4,B000HCO8KE,"I saw the initial broadcasts of the series and was glad to finally see this released for the price. Less than $.72 an episode people.  I don't mind the thin packs but hate that the descriptions/synopsis' are poor...I don't know if this was lacking on the individual seasons or not but even at the bargain price, a simple synopsis would have been great and in fact should be standard.  I loved that it was in 16x9 format and thought the transfer looks excellent as well.

As for the series plot, Special fx, acting I have to say that overall I give it a three and a half.  Better than average, but not quite the full four.  I would even say three and three-quarters.

Kevin Sorbo-Dylan Hunt-Acting, while I like Kevin Sorbo, he has the same style as he did in Hercules as are the deliveries of his lines.  This is not a bad thing but I guess I have seen all of his stuff and it seems the same BUT I will say that it is strong and vibrant.  He is able to show a strong and commanding presence in his roles without even trying, so take the first comment in after reading the second.

Lexa Doig-Romy/Andromeda- is a favorite and played Romy quite well being mechanical when needed but showed a truer human side in many episodes.  The way her character was shifted around though made for sometimes odd unexplained behavior changes.

Gordon Woolvett-Harper-was very likeable and true to his character throughout the series always looking to scam and claw his way to a better place in the world...He seemed more Nietzschean at times than Tyr.  I loved that he was brilliant and very flawed not in his brilliance but in his character flaws.

Keith Cobb-Tyr-Well played and consistent.

The special Effects were good for their time and still hold up today.  The sets and settings were varied up until the last season and made their journeys quite varied.

The Plot was refreshing at times but did have heavy destiny/prophecy filled themes as well as some old standard sci-fi fare episodes to tie them all together.  I loved that most episodes had a continuing overall story arc that carried from season to season.

As sci-fi goes this is a solid 8 out of 10.",1205798400,3,2149,4.537662337662337

And the story as a whole will remind you more of a Crimson Pirate kind of adventure than any thing else, this due to the main male characters Dylan Hunt (ex-Hercules, Kevin Sorbo) Tyr Anasazi( Keith Hamilton Cobb). As such stories revolve more about the interaction between the characters posed with solving a problem, than elaborate different civilisations which need to be inspected.

I hoped that all future complete series sets would have a similar format.  Unfortunately that hasn't happened.  From the cardboard cases that scratch the discs like Mash & Stargate SG-1 to the release of the complete set on double-sided discs like the Addams Family.

Most of the story line is not at all compelling, though there are some episodes that are quite good. The acting leaves a lot to be desired; however, Lexa Doig is well worth watching.  That cannot be said for most of the special effects, which appear to be vintage 1970 and used repetitively. As for the DVD set itself, I like the compact package.  I really liked the price; I got my set for $80.00. The deleted scenes are okay and the ""tours"" with the cast are very interesting. The bloopers are lame; surely there were more and funnier mess ups. One big NEGATIVE is the lack of close captioning. Overall, I am not unhappy that I bought the set, but I will not put Andromeda in my ""will watch again"" pile as I did with Firefly and B5.

2634375,3,B000HCO8KE,"I will start by saying my favorite Sci-Fi is classic Doctor Who. The ones from 1963-1989. I like to use that show to campare other sci-fi to. Problem is, those old Doctor Who episodes were usually 96-100 minutes long. Andromeda and most ""modern"" sci-fi Shows are limited to 45 minutes or so. Still there are 2 part Doctor Whos episodes that only ran 45 minutes. So whats my point in bringing all this up?

Well if you watched a 45 minute Doctor Who show and then Andromeda right afterwards, you would notice some very stark contrasts. Doctor Who was more of a true Sci- Fi show where the heroes relied on intellectual thought and improvisation to get out of 85% of the scrapes. The Andromeda Crew are much more apt to come down to fire all weapons or physical combat.

Is one of these tendancies better than the other? Not really. Its more of a personal preference. Why some people go to see the WWF and others go to see the Boston Pops. Obviously since I stated I like Doctor Who, I prefer the illtellectual sci-fi. This type of Sci-Fi relied more on building up suspense through some type of mystery that had to be gotten to the bottom of.

Moving on to strictly Andromeda. I like the first 2 seasons. By the way Harper is my favorite character, followed by Tier,(spelling?) Rev, Andromdea, Trance, Becka and the Captain is last. I like the tension between tier and Hunt. Rev was good to help balance the other characters. I preferred Purple Trance over the later version. Why you ask? Well you already had 2 alpha males. Tier and Hunt. PLus you had 2 alpha females in Becka and Andromeda as an android. So the writers decide to turn purple Trance into a 3rd alpha female.

Later, when Rev is gone, the only non alpha charactor is Harper. The drawback to me is that more and more the show becomes physical combat and ship combat. There is one episode in season 3 where the fight scene lasts almost 10 minutes. Think about that in a 45 minute show. The same episode then has part of the crew being chased by the Magog ships for another 10 minutes. Thats 20 minutes where the plot hasn't budged an inch. If your thing is fight scenes, then its great.

The charactors pretty much get boxed in during season three and none of them makes any personal growth. Sadly Harper, though more often then not, saves the crew with his genous, never gets much respect from anyone. In fact the crew keeps treating him like he is a teenager.

I think that the actor that plays Hunt was too big for the show and started to take over the writing to some degree. By season 5 he is even credited as a Producer. The same lines get worn out, like ""It's never Easy"", or ""That can't be good"". They were cute for one or 2 episodes but get worn out.

After 2 of my 3 favorite charactors got written out and Harper's role seemed to get diminished. I wasn't that sorry to see the series come to a sputtering end.

The 2 parts that ended season 4 are probably the best 2 episodes of the series, and would have been a good place to end it. In season 5 Harper is completely penned in and its mearly extended bar fights with not much imagination left.

Someone was wanting to know about the extras. They are excellent. Lots of interviews with the actors. Behind the scenes look at make up for Trance and Rev. Picture Galleries, Some explanation and clips of the CG effects. Insight from the producers and directors. Out takes. Pretty well loaded and for the amount of entertainment is a great value.

Like any series that runs 5 seasons, there are episodes so good you can watch them over and over. Then there are ones where you want to send the disc across the room. All in all theres more good than bad in this one.",1182124800,23,3685,4.382137628111273

Also as mentioned in another comment here it is a 'Thinpacks' release. Each thinpack is about 1/4 thick, they also have all the other normal features just like the seperate ones. The only difference is how they are packed within this release.",1178582400,7,370,4.707692307692308

To be able to see every episode and so much behind the scenes information was incredible.  I really wished that Andromeda stayed on for many more seasons.  I believe shows like these bring some light into our dark world at times.  If Andromeda was to come out again, they definitely have someone here willing to watch every winking moment.",1170547200,39,483,4.623529411764705

8138531,3,B000HCO8KE,"This is a tough one to review, because it starts out with a bang and ends with a whimper.

If you are at all familiar with sci-fi, you know the name Gene Roddenberry.  While most know him for his Star Trek contributions, he came up with several other futuristic settings (such as Earth: Final Conflict); this show is one of those settings.  The world building of the Andromeda series is top-notch.  The idea of a mighty, galaxy-spanning empire is believable, but even more believable is the idea that it fails, collapsing into ruin and bringing about a dark age (think the fall of Rome).  In this dark time there are good people, sure, but there are more people out for themselves and just trying to survive.  Mix in numerous alien races, a good over-arching plot, and interesting characters and you've got quality television.

Unfortunately, it doesn't last.  About halfway through the series the show takes a dramatic, noticeable, and obvious turn for the worse.  I've read that this was due to one of the main creators and writers leaving the series, but whatever the reason, the quality of the show suffered.  Worse, the show really just stopped making sense.

In the end, like much of Roddenberry's work, this show is worth watching and the core setting will hopefully endure.  Star Trek itself has had many iterations over the years, some excellent, a few good, and a couple really bad.  If you look at Andromeda in the same light, then it is clearly a worthy addition to any sci-fi library.  If you are looking for a satisfying ending to a single show, however, this program doesn't quite deliver.",1511395200,,1604,4.743682310469314

8138535,4,B000HCO8KE,"I bought the Slipstream collection when it first came out. I loved the series when it first aired. I have to say the potential was there for a great story beginning to end. The first 3 seasons were well written, substance over flash really. The last 2 seasons suffered due to letting go of Robert Hewitt Wolfe in 2001, who was in fact the executive producer and co-creator of the show. This had huge series implications and really impacted the over all series-arc in many negative ways. It didn't help that Kevin Sorbo supported Robert's removal either. The story would have built up with the rise of the Nietzschean people under the their new leader, Rev Bem leading the new warrior priests and the commonwealth all going to meet in a final battle between the Abyss and the Lucifer's. If anyone one wants to know how the show was supposed to be just look up a one-act play called Coda by Robert Hewitt Wolfe. That would have been a great show. to see. :) But all in all still worth having.

Afterthoughts:
This unfortunate incident led to several discontinuities in the historicity of the series. Wolfe published a vision of how the series would have been developed if he had remained with the show in a one-act play called Coda: http://www.roberthwolfe.com/Coda/Andromeda___Coda.pdf

""You're probably wondering what the hell happened,"" Wolfe wrote at the Slipstream BBS. ""Short answer: Television happened.""
Wolfe left the show in late September, during the production of the twelth episode of the season, 'Ouroboros'. Wolfe said the reason for his departure was a creative conflict over the direction Andromeda was taking. While Wolfe had always envisioned a complex arc-based storyline, production companies Tribune Entertainment and Fireworks as well as series star Kevin Sorbo (Dylan Hunt) felt the show had to be more episodic. ""Basically, they want the show to be more action driven, more Dylan-centric, and more episodic,"" Wolfe explained. ""They also want more aliens, more space battles, and less internal conflict among the principal characters. Also, they want a lot less continuity so as not to confuse the casual or new viewer with too much backstory. And finally, they wanted to rework the visual signature of several of the characters, most especially Trance and Rommie, but also Dylan (less uniforms, more civvies).""

8138536,5,B000HCO8KE,"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: Slipstream Collection bought it on sale from BestBuy, $199.00  NOT $999!

ALL seasons, ALL shows, DVD resolution.  Watching them back to back for the first two seasons is like reading a novel,
the rest of the seasons still follow long term plot lines, but many episodes are enjoyable as 'stand-alone' self contained stories.

Overall, a very enjoyable show, better than most, and explores many meta-physical Sci-Fi questions:
What 'lives' in black holes, what if their is anti-matter periodic table we can never know,
what would the consequences of trans-dimensional 'slip stream' travel?
(""Slip Stream, it's not the best way to travel faster than light, it's the only way!"")

Best Episode EVAR:  ""Harper 2.0""  (season 1, episode 14):  Harper gets some super genius upgrades !
(every geeks technological dream come true! (almost))

Harper is the techno genius who, among other things, builds Andromeda the War Ship her very own android avatar, Rommie.
(Introducing Rommie: Andromeda Season 1 Episode 3 & 5.)

In Harper 2.0 - he accidentally gets some super genius cyber upgrades, where we find out more details of Trance Gemini's past (as a purple sun goddess), he can speak to Rev Bem in his Magog native language, does multiple upgrades to the ship,  and discovers the mysterious leader of the bat-like Magog.

And of course, using his improved mental powers, helps save the day, once again !  :-)

A great big THANK YOU to the full cast and crew that brought ANDROMEDA to life:

8138538,3,B000HCO8KE,"I am such a Roddenberry fan, I would like to give Andromeda more stars, but . . . I found the first two season's stories to be topnotch and compelling. Then, I felt that the writer team must have changed. Suddenly, the Commonwealth has been restored in a big way and the tenor of the storyline changed for the worse. It was as if corporate executives insisted on more ""shoot em up"" action and let's character development and story arc. I honestly felt like moving to something else, but trudged through to the very end. If the show had ended with season three, I would have been happier. Season five was just just awful. Restarting with the crew in a different universe just made no sense and the stories weren't very godd - oh, but someone must have felt they needed a new babe on set and voila, sexy android shows up. Well, I don't discourange anyone from buyhing this set, and some will like the show for the same reasons I felt somewhat disappointed.
