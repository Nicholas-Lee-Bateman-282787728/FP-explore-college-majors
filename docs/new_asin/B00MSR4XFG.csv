6600834,5,B00MSR4XFG,"Activism is a fundamental way to fight social injustice. So begins Live and Let Live, a feature length documentary that looks at our relationships with nonhuman animals, what turns people vegan, and the reasons why we stay vegans. The history of veganism in this film is a great introduction to what this movement means, featuring six short biographies of people who went vegan and why, including Peter Singer, Tom Regan, and Gary Francione. Rather than focusing solely on the ethical or moral aspects of veganism, the film analyses the movement from every angle. The fact that so-called lifestyle diseases are running so rampant across cultures, climate change is fast approaching to knock down an apocalyptic door, and the growing number of food scares across the Western world are all important aspects of the broader call to rise from our collective slumber and make a change.",1449446400,4,880,5.075862068965518

6600836,5,B00MSR4XFG,"Interweaving six stories of peoples paths to vegan eating, thepoignant documentary delves into the ethical, environmental, and health reasons for leaving animals off of our plates. Well-paced and well-rounded, the film even addresses the world hunger and public health issues associated with raising animals for food, and thoughtfully acknowledges that even farm workers are victims too.
But the focus is on the animals: their sentience, individual personalities, abilities, and more. Biologist Jonathan Balcombe expertly describes why we should consider other animals capacity for pain and emotional needs. The point is driven home with a story from sanctuary founders Jan and Karin. We won't give it away, but we suggest you keep a tissue nearby.
Journalist Will Potter, philosopher Peter Singer and psychologist Melanie Joy also providevaluable insights such as without awareness there is no free choice. Joy reminds us of how carnism  a thought system so entrenched in our culture that allows us to continue harming animals while considering it the norm  plays into our interactions in society, and why its so challenging to open peoples eyes to the suffering of the animals we exploit. Its an enlightening concept.
WhileLive and Let Liveweaves all of the delicate issues surrounding factory farming very neatly together, the real highlight of the film is thevariety of people who have chosen to eat vegan foods as a way to stand up for animals, and share their stories. Most compelling are the stories of reformation: a priordairy-farming couple who have nowcreateda farmed animal sanctuary, and, in another case, a foie-gras- and veal-serving butcher turned vegan chef. Of course, the documentary features the expected activists, but the film also highlights individuals like professional track cyclistJack Lindquist, who has found his recovery time has decreased and energy increased since transitioning to a plant-based diet.

6600838,2,B00MSR4XFG,"Love the subject matter. I am a devout vegan but I found the documentary to be lacking in flow, and facts. It was a bit repetitive and lacking in substance. We recognize the problem but it would be nice if offered helpful advice for those wanting to make the change.",1461542400,,266,4.34
6600839,5,B00MSR4XFG,Excellent film that explores the thick behind a vegan diet in a non-aggressive way. I've been vegan for two years and I thought it was a beautiful explanation of the lifestyle.,1461024000,,176,4.709677419354839

6600842,5,B00MSR4XFG,"Live and Let live is a fantastic documentary about veganism. It features ordinary people thoughts and benefits about being vegan, animal activists but also professional people. These includes a biological ethologist who explains how all animals can feel suffer and have feelings, a psychologist & sociologist who is telling how come humans are capable of killing other animals, a professor in nutritional biochemistry, a foodcscientist, a geophysicist etc. By featuring these people the documentary contains every important aspect there is about eating meat and animal products. Therefore I can highly recommend this documentary for everyone, but specially to people who is curious about the issue and yet don't know much about it. In contrast to other similiar documentaries, this ones aime is not as much giving you guilt and a bad taste in your mouth, but is positive and enlightning in a good way. I like that and I think this is the best way to educate people.

I myself have been vegetarian for about 3 years, and for the last month I've become vegan. I have seen the popular documentaries there is out there, but still Live and Let Live gave me new perspectives and knowledge. The thing I personally love most about the documentary is that when i was finished seeing it, i got a even stronger feeling that all creatures are equal and that non-human animals also deservere respect and justice. Besides that, it gave me a community feeling about being vegan. Thanks and go vegan! (:",1451692800,3,1487,4.948
6600843,5,B00MSR4XFG,"A brilliant movie, one of the best vegan ones I've watched. It conveys the message clearly without the use of graphic imagery. It was incredibly moving, and does a great job of portraying human and non-human emotions.",1451606400,2,217,4.891891891891892
6600844,5,B00MSR4XFG,"An all encompassing reason to change your life, and make new goals.  Already a vegetarian I needed something to kick start the next phase in my life.  Live and let live is an all around great short flick, for anyone concerned about the environment, animals or their own health.  Informative and educational it is a great starting point for any transformation.",1451606400,3,359,4.852459016393443
6600845,5,B00MSR4XFG,"Great recap and explanation about veganism. All aspects are covered (animals, health, environment, etc) and glad it even took to human rights as well. Easy to watch, both informative and entertaining.",1451606400,,200,5.483870967741935
6600846,5,B00MSR4XFG,"An easy way to understand that even a butcher can make the connection that we feel and we are all the same... and learn the lesson.
It's a really good step to the ones that didn't start to swim in this big ocean called veganism/ animal liberation.

8674454,5,B00MSR4XFG,"A powerful documentary about our food choices and the horrific ways we exploit and abuse animals, as well as the disastrous effects animal agriculture has on our environment. Several prominent vegan health experts and physicians are also featured in this documentary.

The film was suitable for most ages and did not contain any gory or graphic images that could be considered disturbing. I highly recommend seeing this documentary and sharing it with libraries, colleges and health-conscious groups.",1517616000,,500,5.4935064935064934
8674455,5,B00MSR4XFG,"I liked the fact that a lot of the documentary involves German farmers, activists, and scientists, not just Americans.  So you see that animal rights and veganism is a global movement.  I also liked the fact that Peter Singer, Tom Regan, Gary Francine, etc were interviewed.

The only critique I have is that there are no closed captioning subtitles, just subtitles for the foreign languages.  When I saw this documentary on Netflix, you could access closed captioning subtitles in English.",1510876800,,490,5.0875
8674456,1,B00MSR4XFG,All the people in this documentary that are so concerned with animal rights are all still using by products of the meat industry. From the makeup on their faces to the glue holding their shoes together. I'm sorry but that is the hard truth. If you want to make a documentary at least understand that you have to change more than people's eating habits. It requires reinventing so many technological advances that it will never happen.,1494115200,,434,4.723684210526316

It's perfectly executed and covers all of the messages that are essential to the vegan movement. What's more, it is by far the most heartfelt film on these subjects, and never loses track of the core arguments at any point throughout.

8674461,2,B00MSR4XFG,"One of the most boring and least informative documentaries on this subject that I've ever seen.  The best information came from T. Colin Campbell.  It comes off as more ""preachy"" than informative, primarily focused on convincing people that animal rights are important.  While I'm all for animal rights, the average person isn't phased by being told that chickens have feelings too.  If you'd like to really learn about veganism, whole foodism, healthy eating, etc., try checking out Forks Over Knives, Hungry for Change, Food Matters and That Sugar Film.  There are also some great books to read from people like David Wolfe, T. Colin Campbell, and Dr. Andrew Saul.  If you've never watched a documentary like this before, it might not be a bad place to start... if you don't mind subtitles... but generally I recommend Food Inc. and Hungry for Change for newbies.",1465689600,,865,4.972222222222222
