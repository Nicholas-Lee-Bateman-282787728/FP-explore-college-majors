557915,5,630306664X,"This time around, the Ubriaco's let two dogs into the family, and it is just hilarious! Danny Devito and Diane Keaton supply the voices of the two dogs who are always at each others throats. Kirstie Alley and John Travolta give good performances as the parents who are learning to live with the new pets around the house, and the lady that plays Travolta's sexy and coniving boss...she's good too!
Watch it with the family, and, unlike the first two, the PG-13 on this one is rather tame, so don't worry about showing this one to your kids without guidence.
It's great!",1018310400,3,569,4.588235294117647
557916,1,630306664X,"Okay, maybe this movie would have been a big hit in 1952....but these days, cheesy talking dogs and a plot that would even make Bob Saget barf, just DOES NOT hold up as a good movie. They shouldn't have made this third ""Look Whose Talking."" It's not funny.....it's bad acting...and the only station that would even consider airing it is ""The Super Station"" Save your money, go buy the original two movies. At least they were some what cute.",1004227200,3,440,4.582278481012659
557917,5,630306664X,I Like This Movie. It Is Better Then The First 2. I Like The First 1 Alot But I Gaved It Five Stars Like This One. This One Has The 2 Cute Dogs In It. Also The Returning Parents Of Mikey And Julie: Kirstie Alley And John  Travolta. This Movie Is Not Stupid Or Booring. It Is Great.,961718400,11,281,3.8448275862068964

557919,1,630306664X,"One word. Why?
Why didn't they call it LOOK WHO'S BARKING? Why did they make it? Hollywood should be bombed. Not once, but twice. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
Movies are good with only one (not that the first  one was any good); sequels almost always plunge to the basement. This time  around, the dogs are doing the talking. Voices of DeVito and Keaton add  absolutely no humor or life to this faded series of films.
See, now  you've gone and destroyed my faith in Hollywood. And to think Travolta and  Alley are amongst the highest paid actors/actresses in Hollywood. Urgh.  Kill me.

558251,4,630306664X,After years of avoiding Sony's dreaded full frame release they finally give the film to Mill Creek for a re-release. Granted the movie is originally framed in 1.85:1 this new release is 1.78:1 (obviously the matte is either slightly opened up or they just cropped it to hi-def ratio). A great film that combines innocence and adult humor. Danny DeVito and Sally Field were hilarious in this film.,1438387200,,396,4.838235294117647

558448,5,630306664X,"We have watched this movie countless times, and each time we view it, it's as enjoyable as the first. Kirstie Alley and John Travolta make the perfect team. They are as funny as the children, and so are the two dogs. We love this movie as much as 'Look Who's Talking' which was laugh-out-loud entertainment from start to finish.

Danny DeVito as Rocks and Diane Keaton as Daphine entertain as much as the parents, and children. The little girl is adorable, and we already fell in love with Mikey in 'Look Who's Talking.' Kirstie loses her job, and John Travolta finds the best job he ever had. However, his female boss hires him for more than one reason, and both John and Kirstie are faced with a problem, until it gets resolved later on.

Mikey no longer believes in Santa, John is never home, and Kirstie takes matters in her own hands. Since John cannot come home for Christmas, Kirstie and the children, including the two dogs, bring Christmas to John. An adventure begins in the cold, deep snow as the family tries to reunite.

This movie is fun for the whole family, and entertains with humor from start to finish. The movie also portrays compassion and love within the family unit, and is filled with holiday spirit. Highly recommended!",1404777600,3,1244,4.6454545454545455

558450,4,630306664X,"I like John Travolta in pretty much anything but what you think would be worn out jokes and lame story line in the 3rd installment, you get pleasantly surprised. I won't go into the details other than it ends up a great Christmas movie for the family, but it's funny and a very entertaining movie. I recommend it even if you've seen the others because you don't feel like you've seen it before, you feel like you know these characters but it's a whole new approach. Good job guys.",1398124800,3,480,4.404494382022472

Mollie refuses to get one, but James is more open to the idea. This time, we have Danny DeVito and Diane Keaton as the voices of Rocks and Daphne; two dogs who can't get along and become adopted by the Ubriacco family. On Christmas Eve, James is stuck with his female boss who is trying to seduce him, and Mollie and the rest of the gang try to find him. When they have car trouble, a wolf shows up and tries to attack Mollie, and it's up to Rocks to save his new family. I would recommend LOOK WHO'S TALKING NOW!!!",1290038400,,651,4.216

558656,5,630306664X,"For a while HBO would show this movie 4 or 5 times a day, but I could never resist watching it again and again whenever I came across it.  John Travolta and Kirstie Alley are so endearing, and the kids are hilarious.  Anyone who has siblings can understand the hilarity behind their sibling rivalry.  The dogs, or course, are the best part, voiced by Danny DeVito and Diane Keaton.  This movie is great for kids or adults.  Kids get to enjoy the talking dogs and adults (at least females) get to look at John Travolta. :)",1103241600,5,521,4.385416666666667

Possibly my all-time favourite film, it comprises childish playfulness with mischeivous adult humour whilst reinforcing core values of love, loyalty, family and best of all, Christmas! Not a film for stuffy old scrooges, but if you can get past the talking dogs (and at one point talking sperm as well!) you will see it as one of the most beautiful and heart-warming films ever made. A part of the Look Who's Talking series, but 's really no need to watch the other two films first, Look Who's Talking Now stands alone as a masterpiece.

 James Ubriacco (John Travolta) is a happy-go-lucky chap who gets through life mucking about and making people laugh. Not the usual example of one of life's high-flyers, James gets offered his dream job as a pilot but only because the rich blonde president of the company, Samantha LeBon, fancies him! But she's got her work cut out trying to seduce him, as James is already married to the beautiful Molly (Kirstie Alley) who he adores, and although she gets a little frustrated with his joking around, the two are very much in love, living happily with their two endearing children, Mikey and Julie. On hearing how desperate Mikey is for a dog, Samantha gives James her French poodle, Daphne (a bitch in every sense of the word) just as James has bought Mikey a mongrel dog, Rocks, from the rescue home. This annoys Molly who didn't want a dog in the first place, and she is lumbered with two dogs while scheming Samantha is flying James all over the world and never letting him home. But as Samantha's plans become more devious and James is forced to spend Christmas away from home, will temptation overcome him or will he make it home for Christmas? Or will Christmas make it's way to Daddy...? With two intelligent dogs that secretly talk to thrown into the equation, anything's possible!

The story between the dogs is just as captivating as the story between the people, the humour is of a dry, intelligent nature, the children and dogs are very cute and the chemistry between Travolta and Alley is unsurpassable! A true gem of a film, Look Who's Talking Now will make Christmas complete, whether you're young or old this film is bound to crack a smile! :-)",1098921600,11,2217,4.664961636828645
558658,5,630306664X,"LOOK WHO'S TALKING NOW! Two dogs named Rocks and Daphne. Mikey and his half-sister Julie are now talking on their own so there no provided voices for them like the previous two films. Rocks was found by James Ubriacco(John Travolta). He tries to convince his wife Mollie(Kirstie Alley) to let Rocks become part of the Ubriacco household otherwise he'll be euthanized. Rocks,voiced by Danny DeVito,finds a mate of his own. Her name is Daphne,voiced by Diane Keaton. Get a load of DeVito exclaiming ""Schwing!"" when Rocks eyeballs Daphne. The exclamatory word was inspired by the two Wayne's World movies and the Saturday Night Live skit that spun them off. James,now an airline pilot and no longer driving taxicabs,becomes involved in a scam orchestrated by a business associate of his. The scam is eventually thwarted. The associate(Lysette Anthony) even threatens to kill Rocks. She and James,alone in a cabin,are found by Rocks,Daphne,Mollie and the Ubriaccos' children. The deceptive associate is taken into police custody.",1079395200,,1025,5.294478527607362
