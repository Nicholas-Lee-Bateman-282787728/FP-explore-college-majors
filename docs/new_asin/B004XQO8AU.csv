8447323,5,B004XQO8AU,"They were a group of Musicians, that my Mothers generation grew up listening to. I had a chance to hear them play when I was younger. They were fantastic players, Adam was also director of the Choir at St. Archangel Church in So. Chicago. They sang all over, but localie, they would have concerts, plus each year they would have a Barn Dance. This was a fun night of singing, joking around, and giving everyone a lot of love. I know they are missed. But we have many records, and if you get a chance buy the DVD's about them. You will enjoy them. You can get the records or CD's at Balken Records in Chicago.",1423872000,2,608,4.25

8447326,5,B004XQO8AU,"Director Jill Godmilow heads to the south side of Chicago to document the 50th anniversary celebration of the Serbian-American tamburitza band, The Popovich Brothers. But when one brother, Marko, tragically dies of a heart attack the celebrating is cut short. Godmilow is allowed a glimpse into the mourning of a family and an entire community. Friends and family open up to her about the loss of Marko and the importance of the Brother's music in preserving tradition, culture, and a sense of community amongst generations of immigrants struggling to hold their own in a foreign land. Yet, concerns still arise about how younger generations can experience their heritage in rich and meaningful ways; a concern that is perhaps even more apt today 30 years after the documentary was made. Set against the backdrop of Chicago's South side, the film captures the sharing of voices and the capacity to be carried away by song that is all a part of the Popovich Brother's music. Expressive and entertaining this newly restored documentary is a rare chronicle of one of Chicago's most eminent musical groups.",1317081600,4,1102,5.06043956043956
