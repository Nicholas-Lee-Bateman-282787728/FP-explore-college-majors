2714308,5,B000LV6OI0,"As beautiful as an Eisenstein movie, ""Commissar"" focuses on the contrast between a cold brutal woman soldier from the Red Army and a poor tender intense Jewish family. A deep insight into the 1920s Civil War and life in the Pale of settlement, children, motherhood. A unique masterpiece!",1248825600,9,287,5.0
2714309,5,B000LV6OI0,"Another interesting and engaging film fro  the Soviet era. It is very realistic and does not shy away from deep, and politically ""deviant"" explorations of the title character, the Commissar. A must see for any student of the USSR.",1239840000,,230,4.897435897435898
2714310,4,B000LV6OI0,"The Bottom Line:

Though a similar storyline was handled to somewhat better effect in Ballad of a Soldier, Commisar is still a reasonably interesting story of a soldier who leaves the chaos of war to the idyll of the home front; notable for its references to the Holocaust, Commisar should interest Russian film aficionados.",1234051200,,324,5.0
2714311,5,B000LV6OI0,"Komissar is a movie very dear to me. I watched this for the first time in my life in November 1989, in Romania. I was quite young, Ceaucescu had his last Communist Party Congress - he was to fall with a (literal) bang soon, in December 1989. I still remember how shocked I was that the Communist censors allowed this amazing anti-Communist movie into the cinemas... it must have been ignorance rather than courage.

This 1967 movie was banned during its own time, the director Askoldov never made a movie again, his very life was in danger for a while. Even as late as 1987, in full-blown perestroika, he had troubles to get his movie out of the censors' hands. Finally he could do it, and the movie was a triumph with international critics and audiences.

If you believe this is an obsolete, half-boring movie, the main quality of which would be that it was courageous for its own time, think again. This is a poetic masterpiece which endures fantastically well the test of time. If you only like American movies, avoid this. If you're reasonably cultivated movies-wise, if you like Dreyer, Fellini, Carne, Kadar, and the like, by all means, do not allow yourselves to die before watching this movie. Askoldov, the director of one and only serious movie, is on the same level with the ones named above. Apologies for the apparently shrill sale pitch, but yes, this is a one-of-a-kind masterwork. It is deep, tragic, subtle, it deals with the ethics and chaos of war, without the gore nor the guts. I would place this movie on the same pedestal as I place Kadar's (also unique) The Shop on Main Street.

A few words about this particular edition, which made me throw the old, worn-out VHS tape to the garbage: it is extraordinary as well. Everything is ideal. (OK, the English translation could have been better, perhaps.) The transfer, both in its video and audio aspects (terrific soundtrack from a young Schnittke!!) made me experience this, on a plasma TV, like I was back in the cinema.

What was even more unexpectedly generous and good was the second DVD, containing special features. I have never seen, not even in my many beloved Criterion DVDs, such a generous, relevant, well-made bunch of interviews - with priceless historical context, contemporary documentation and the like. Watching the special features was almost as riveting as re-watching the movie itself.

Do not buy this in any other edition. This is cinema at its true best, offered in an ideal packaging.",1229904000,28,2478,4.780373831775701
2714312,1,B000LV6OI0,"If you lots of marching - going this way and then that way, or lots of horses being driven this way and that, this is the film for you.  If you like many long scenes of stoic faces - facing this way and that way - this is a winner. Perhaps there is a cultural issue here.  Maybe the subtitles failed to tell the full story.  Any impact was lost on us.",1410393600,3,351,3.8472222222222223

The acting is superb and quite frankly, the quality of this work makes the trash produced today in Hollywood look rather foolish.  Recommended for serious film buffs as well.",1401235200,2,332,4.910714285714286

2714316,4,B000LV6OI0,"Filmed in 1967 and released on 1988 (thanks to the glasnot) this brave film hovered by a desperate and ruthless poetry which works out as an existential dilemma for a woman who must make an irreversible choice: to return with her political convictions or her devotion for her newborn child.

Along this crucial decision, emerges the figure of Yefim - a kind Jew - who knows and understands about the life further his academic studies.

Dramatic, intense and direct. It's like a red hot sword direct to our soul. Don't miss it.",1344729600,4,526,4.706521739130435
2714317,4,B000LV6OI0,"A work of she-commissar (Bolshevik ""chaplain"") was addressed to own folks while contextual nuances of October Revolution-timing affairs between poor Jewish family and a revolutionary servicewoman giving a birth to her child and ushered back to the arms with Holocaust visions, had to some extent lost in translation.

A movie-maker was ostracized at the time and had his career ruined for pro-Jewish motives of a work questioning the very basics of Bolshevik revolution, which what was unthinkable before the USSR disintegrating.

Well, could such an intellectual genocide be experienced in a former communist block only?",1321833600,,621,5.526315789473684

8164326,1,B000LV6OI0,"Pointless, depressing and confusing, this film is NOT worth the extraordinarily long time it takes to watch it.  The dialogue, what of it there was, was bland and pointless, the cinematography was just horrible, the story was impossible to follow what with all the flashbacks and fade in/fade out to what ever vision and dream the director was trying to show.  Seriously, you could make a better movie yourself with a cheap VHS camcorder and make up a script as you go along.  I find it difficult to believe that any production company would have spent two cents - or ""kopecks"" on this drivel, I am still hating myself for wasting the time I spent watching it.",1470441600,,660,4.6239316239316235

8164331,5,B000LV6OI0,"A disclaimer first. This film is not for the lovers of Hollywood blockbusters. They will find it slow and low on body count. It does not offer a happy ending, either. It is European art house film, after all.

It tells a tragic story of civil war and leaves the heroes facing the tragic future. But the story of the making of this film deserves to be told, as it became the part of the film. The film director, whose parents were victims of Stalin's purges, knew well ahead of time that his film should have a difficult fate. He made it anyway. He was thrown out of profession, had to work as a laborer for years and was able to return to Moscow by luck. The film was ordered to be destroyed by the Communist Party Central Committee and was saved from destruction by a very prominent and successful Soviet filmmaker and a director of the film studio, who took his chances. After his death in 1985, there were two items found in his personal safe: his Communist Party member card and the copy of this film.

The movie foretells the story of the Holocaust and calls to us to remember that war means death, no matter what are the principles it declares as a just cause. There is another tragic life weaved into the canvas of this story: the composer, one of the greatest composers of 20th century, Alfred Schnittke, also had a very difficult life in the Soviet Union. His music is incredibly moving.

Once you see the film, it becomes clear why the film was declared anti-Soviet and was released by a turn of luck. It speaks the truth, often uncomfortable. The story line is reminiscent, in some ways, with Doctor Zhivago. You can tell that the future of the baby, born from a Russian upper-class father and a ""proletariat"" mother, left to be raised by poor Jewish family in Ukraine of 1920-ies will be tragic, much like the life of the daughter of Yury and Lara in Doctor Zhivago.",1431734400,3,1878,4.453488372093023
