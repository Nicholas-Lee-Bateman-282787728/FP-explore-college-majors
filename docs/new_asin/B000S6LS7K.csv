8204493,3,B000S6LS7K,"As a lifelong fan of Gene Autry I was very pleased to see that the only two films he ever made in Colour was to become available on DVD.  Having missed seeing them at the cinema when I was a teenager, I was even more pleased to be able to buy this DVD along with the only other colour film -""The Big Sombrero""

Whilst I found the production values and Script  of 'The Strawberry Roan' to be much better than most other Gene Autry films, I was quite disappointed with the tranfer to video.  Unfortunately I have found that the transfer has not come out well.  The films suffers badly from poor quality colour (probably to to the actual Cinecolour process) and the sound has not been remastered too well.

On my copy at least the film brightness undulates sometimes and also has slight double vision in parts - quite disappointing.  Having said this, I did like the story and the songs and it was nice to see Gene Autry in colour. Not a typical Gene Autry film unfortunately in some ways as he has no comic sidekick with him, nor are there any real baddies.  A much better quality transfer of his only other colour is the ""The Big Sombrero"", this does however to me lack a decent script and has too much in the way of modern vehicles in it.",1190073600,5,1238,4.306034482758621
