5957181,5,B00EYO1X7M,"this is a great starter video.  what i love is that there is a teacher and a student, and you can see what the teacher wants via watching her fix the pose of the student.

it really is great.

a big thank you to jill satterfield for approaching this video in this fashion.
i am officially a huge fan.",1412121600,,300,4.0508474576271185
5957182,5,B00EYO1X7M,"I was advised by my Doctor to do Yoga 3-4 times a week. I have been searching for just this approach. Everything else out there  seems so advanced. The ones that I have tried caused me pain. I am getting both of these.
I liked being introduced in new thing softly.
Thank you Jill.",1410912000,,280,4.185185185185185
5957183,5,B00EYO1X7M,Simple relaxing and easy to follow. Great video.,1410480000,,48,5.125
5957184,4,B00EYO1X7M,Really great video teaches you the basics. Challenging but doesn't make things too hard.,1408233600,,88,5.357142857142857
5957185,5,B00EYO1X7M,"Truely for beginers the whole 1st episode is dedicated to just how how to peeform some basic stances.
I wish there were more than only 2.",1407628800,,137,4.3076923076923075
5957186,5,B00EYO1X7M,"This is slow, thoughtful yoga meant to combine meditation and yoga. I love this approach.",1406332800,3,89,5.0
5957187,5,B00EYO1X7M,"The main aspect that I liked so much was that this was divided into 2 segments. The first one really broke down the major points of each pose, providing detailed instruction on alignment and variations. The instructions were very clear and easy to digest. The second segment was the full sequence demonstrated by two yogis who showed you two variations for nearly all the poses. The pace was slow enough to move through, yet not too slow. One of the main things I liked about this video was its emphasis on mindfulness and breathing. It helped me stay more in my body during the class and made a huge difference in how I felt after the class! Great for beginners and those who wish to return to the basics of yoga with a great teacher.",1400630400,7,735,4.451851851851852
5957188,5,B00EYO1X7M,"Excellent for beginners. What I liked most about these two episodes is the fact that the first one has detailed instructions with demonstrations for modify the poses. The second episode is the full class, also with good, clear instructions and two students that you can follow. Great addition to my yoga collection.",1398729600,9,315,5.076923076923077
5957189,5,B00EYO1X7M,Great intro to yoga.  I am still terrible but getting better.,1445472000,,61,4.545454545454546
5957190,4,B00EYO1X7M,I liked the way she spoke and described the movements. It didn't seem as hoakey as most do.,1443052800,,91,4.111111111111111
5957191,5,B00EYO1X7M,a huge help to me!,1438992000,,18,2.8
5957192,5,B00EYO1X7M,"I really like this video. This video teaches you proper alignment as well as modified positions. Before watching this video apparently I was not doing the poses properly and ended up hurting my back, worse than before I started. Now I'm consious of proper body alignment and am benefiting greatly from yoga. This is truly a beginner video. love it!",1438819200,,348,4.816666666666666
5957193,1,B00EYO1X7M,VERY BORING,1438387200,,11,5.0
5957194,3,B00EYO1X7M,There are some wonderful stretches in here.  It takes a couple practice runs to get it down due to the horrible voice editing. lol.,1438214400,,131,4.458333333333333
5957195,3,B00EYO1X7M,Good instructional for poses. I was looking for a class....,1438041600,,59,5.0
5957196,3,B00EYO1X7M,The explanation is excessive and could be improved within the practice.,1436745600,,71,5.545454545454546
5957197,5,B00EYO1X7M,Very thorough and gentle workout.  I recommend this for out-of-shape seniors!,1434499200,,77,6.0
5957198,2,B00EYO1X7M,Really slow and not enough talking through the process. Did it with my boyfriend to get him started and when you're actually DOING yoga it's very difficult to watch the TV - so they need to explain the process a little more in depth and the movements.,1433376000,,251,4.361702127659575

5957202,5,B00EYO1X7M,I enjoyed this yoga instruction. I felt I learned the proper forms. Wish she had more.,1429401600,,86,4.4375

5957204,5,B00EYO1X7M,Great yoga sequence for the morning.,1428710400,,36,5.166666666666667
5957205,4,B00EYO1X7M,"This is a good DVD for beginners. Easy enough for someone who doesn't know yoga, but still challenging. Poses are explained, and instructor gives tips on how to protect your knees and back. One instructor gives a simpler version of the poses for people who aren't as flexible. Also comes with a short video that shows how to do each pose, which is very useful.",1428019200,,360,4.553846153846154
5957206,4,B00EYO1X7M,"Very good, pretty easy for a newbie like me. Only problem is, if she expects you to get into position properly, she should give a little more time to do so, check your position and look up at the screen. I found I constantly had to stop the DVD, go back and break the train of calm, reflective breathing one is supposed to do while cranking around trying to get into the poses. This isn't really for beginners in that respect, since I got the feeling the instructor knows this so well she doesn't take into consideration that some of us have never even heard of these poses before.",1427328000,,581,4.339449541284404
5957207,5,B00EYO1X7M,"This is my first time to do yoga and this video has been great, super simple and it gives me some confidence moving forward to start going to class.",1426896000,,148,4.137931034482759
5957208,3,B00EYO1X7M,"This video does a good job of showing how to get into certain yoga positions, which is helpful for a beginner like myself. However, I found that it moved on too quickly to the next position, and I had to scramble out of the current one to pause it. It would be beneficial, when one side of the body is used as an example, that the instructor the go on to show the other side...but she does not. It seems stupid to have to go through the entire video again just to do the moves with the other side of your body.",1426636800,,510,4.009803921568627
5957209,3,B00EYO1X7M,"I like this video, but poses are really held for an uncomfortably long time for beginners. That being said, the helpful encouragement that she gives  for improving form is great. It is very clearly stated and certainly slow enough. I almost gave it 4 stars just for the instruction.",1426636800,,282,4.755102040816326
5957210,5,B00EYO1X7M,Enjoyed it a lot. I like that the video shows alternatives to the positions the instructor gets in. I wish I did yoga more often my body benefits so much from it.,1426204800,,162,4.09375
5957211,5,B00EYO1X7M,I really enjoyed this.  It gave me new stretches that helped a lot (I'm not very flexible) and had a perfectly moderated voice over to accompany.  I would definitely recommend this particular yoga workout.,1426118400,,205,5.0
5957212,4,B00EYO1X7M,Good introduction instructions at the beginning of the program especially if your new to yoga. Liked it --will fast forward to the guided exercise part next time. Recommend for real beginners,1426032000,,191,5.193548387096774
5957213,2,B00EYO1X7M,"Didn't like the intro video very well. Didn't do both sides for each pose, and didn't narrate each transition. Hard to watch what she's doing and do the pose myself without a verbal cue as well. I found myself often behind when I would look up.  I did learn some new fundamentals for proper alignment to apply to other lessons, but I will not be trying this one again.",1425340800,,368,4.333333333333333
5957214,4,B00EYO1X7M,"I was new to yoga and I found that Yoga for Beginners was a great workout to start with. The poses aren't hard to do but they give you a good stretch workout. Jill doesn't hurry from pose to pose which helps you to settle into the pose before switching to the next one. If you're looking for a strenuous workout for weight loss and toning, I wouldn't recommend this workout. If you're looking to learn yoga and loosen and relax your muscles, then this is the workout for you.",1424476800,4,475,4.288888888888889
5957215,5,B00EYO1X7M,I really enjoyed this video. I like how the instructor goes through the poses and highlights the techniques in detail. I also like how techniques for student and advanced practitioners are shown. Very helpful.,1422748800,,209,5.176470588235294
5957216,5,B00EYO1X7M,"A a beginner to joga,  I was very impressed with this detailed presentation.  I found that for me it helped watching it a second time to realize that the details explained in each pose might be implemented best if taken one pose at a time, only adding the next pose when the previous pose was understood and mastered.  We live in a society that leads us to believe in instant gratification.  When it comes to our bodies,  their is no schedule,  it is more a feeling/listening that we must quiet outside stimulation to achieve.  This is where breath/visualization  plays such a huge part in relaxation.  Jill Satterfield helped guide me mentally, as well as physically, to understand and learn to accomplish this.

Thank you,  RLE",1421193600,2,729,4.752

5957220,4,B00EYO1X7M,"I have done a few other yoga videos. I really enjoy this one but it's not for absolute beginners. I am not flexible at all so a lot of moves are very challenging. I do like that there are 2 demonstrators, one modifies the moves which is nice. It is very peaceful and helps me relax and concentrate on each pose.",1418688000,,311,4.114754098360656

5957223,1,B00EYO1X7M,"This was a waste. There was no real yoga session in this video. This video is comprised of the ""instructor"" looking at someone else doing the poses and then randomly moving one of their body parts to correct them. She doesn't even bother to do left and right.

8610388,1,B00EYO1X7M,"This video was really poor. The audio quality was terrible making both the background sounds and the narrator's voice terrible.
