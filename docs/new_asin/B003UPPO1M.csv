4207357,5,B003UPPO1M,I loved the show and the chemistry between the band members was fantastic. [...] for some of the other shots I took.,1283817600,3,116,4.318181818181818
4207358,4,B003UPPO1M,"First, a confession.  I am not, nor have ever been, a die hard Jane's Addiction fan.  The closest I might have ever come is commandeering my brother's cassette tape of Ritual de lo Habitual (RDLH) back in the early 90's.  Aside from stopping to surf the radio dial over the years whenever ""Been Caught Stealing"" was playing, my music of choice over the last decade has largely been Zepp, Rush, various types of reggae and even some fusion.  Not too long ago, I had the sudden craving for RDLH and so purchased a copy on iTunes.  Not long after, I found myself listening to ""Three Days"" and ""Then She did"" over and over while working out at the gym.  Without exaggerating, I have probably heard those two songs streaming over my iPod Touch well over a hundred times in the last month or two. Now, I might not be a lifelong fan, but when I read the news release for the forthcoming ""Live Voodoo"" on Blu-ray, I pre-ordered without blinking an eye.  Now, for the part most of you probably care about.  I am a Blu-ray enthusiast having embraced the format during the war with HD DVD and digested every bit of news and magazine article since.  I also happen to have a good pair of eyes and at least one very good ear and own several hundred Blu-ray disc.  So, it's probably fair to say I know a good high definition title when I see, and hear, one.  That takes me to ""Live Voodoo"".  Here's my take and I'll be brief.  I just got done viewing it all the way through and while I did see occasional motion judder, usually from the quick movement of one of the band members and usually Perry Farrell, it was never too distracting. Like other ""reviewers"", I did see some mild background noise in some darker scenes and even some black crush, but overall, the blacks are inky and the image quality very strong. There were a few instances during ""Three Days"" when I had to lean a little closer toward my Polk CS10 monitor to hear Farrell's vocals.  Otherwise, the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track really shines especially for Eric Avery's bass guitar.  I did not sample the other audio tracks (English Dolby Digital 5.1 and and a LPCM 2.0).  ""Live Voodoo"" definitely comes with a lot of magic that without a doubt has Marie Laveau and Rosita Zerruda dancing in their graves. Jane's Addiction has come and gone in my life's ever evolving music interest, but ""Live Voodoo"" has managed to capture a mature snapshot of the band in the most modern of ways.  Buy this now and for once in your life, select next day delivery. You will not be disappointed.

P.S.  Let's hope that Jane's Addiction's recent re-break-up [...] isn't a permanent one. If so, it will make this release all the more special.",1283299200,16,2677,4.482474226804124
4207359,5,B003UPPO1M,this was a fantastic show with the original line up. I am going to buy this and compare my photos. One of my all time favorite bands. It's a shame there broken up again. It was a great halloween and my anniversary also and the dvd will be a great reminder.,1283212800,2,256,4.03921568627451
4207360,5,B003UPPO1M,"If you like Jane's Addiction, you will love this concert! Great quality Blu-Ray! Always better to see bands live, but also nice to keep the memories!",1365552000,3,149,4.769230769230769
4207361,5,B003UPPO1M,"Plenty to appreciate about this show. For starters, the band forgoes playing its more recent tracks in favor of delivering the tried and true Jane's Addiction classics. Unlike so many other bands whose fame rides on the accomplishments of the distant past, they had no delusions about what the audience wanted to see and hear. The set-list is a gesture of respect and mutual admiration for the core fans who remember the band for being the powerful force of radical change that challenged a music establishment which was begging to be dismantled brick-by-decadent-brick.

Dave takes no short-cuts in his delivery of each and every song, belting out a flawlessly executed solo during ""Three Days,"" and seamlessly re-creating the hypnotic intro from ""Ted, Just Admit It"" with studio-quality perfection. He is determined to use his guitar as an instrument of justice, playing every riff with the same conviction that mesmerized audiences decades ago, and which catapulted the band to its legendary status. Rarely contributing a spoken word, he leaves the role of stage presence and off-colored commentary to Perry. He instead communicates through his guitar, masterfully conveying the sonic message of the Jane's Addiction catalog in its full glory.

If you were expecting to see Perry's renowned on-stage convulsions, hyperactive interpretive dancing, and psychosis-driven ramblings, then you might be disappointed. As you might've guessed, he's no longer in his twenties and loaded up on whatever is put in front of him. You'd have to imagine that if he hadn't slowed down at some point in his life, he probably wouldn't be around to give these performances. How many of us who witnessed the band in its prime can actually say that we have the same vigor and intensity that we had 20-30 years ago?

But, that doesn't mean he isn't his old self. He is provocative bordering on lewd, and who would expect otherwise? Several of the tracks are preceded and followed with his no-nonsense, gritty take on life as he sees it. Whether done intentionally or through his own disregard for common decency, he routinely makes brutally honest references to subjects that might be considered taboo. Scoffing at personal limitations, he summarizes his life-long war on balance and moderation by declaring that ""the highest form of control is having no control at all.""

Audio quality is superb. DTS-HD is as it should sound. Moreover, the show was played outdoors, which means the recording has a certain natural openness that is often difficult to achieve with indoor venues. It's an experience comparable to hearing the ""XXX"" album for the first time.

Stage lighting is surreal, so it's definitely worth it to see this in blu ray as opposed to dvd. 1080p is really taken advantage of here.

As a life-long Jane's fan, I was not the least bit disappointed by this offering from a band whose impact and influence on music is probably immeasurable.",1359936000,5,2932,5.0600414078674945
4207362,5,B003UPPO1M,"If you're a Janes fan, this is a must buy. Cheap price for an awesome product and its Blu-Ray!

4207363,5,B003UPPO1M,"Ignore what Perry Farrell is wearing, I have no idea where you buy an outfit like that. This is a great show that was filmed well. I was thrown back 20 years to when the band was at the top of their game. Being a bass player, I only wish there more footage of Eric Avery. It's a shame that he could not work out his differences with the band. This is a must buy for any fan of the band.",1339804800,,386,3.7777777777777777
4207364,5,B003UPPO1M,"Show took place on Halloween night, 2009 at the Voodoo Experience in New Orleans. I was fortunate enough to catch Jane's Addiction just months prior to this gig with Nine Inch Nails while out on the NINJA trek. After viewing the 'Live Voodoo' DVD a number of times, I can now (more than ever) proclaim to this very day as to just WHY Jane's Addiction is one of my all-time favorites. Simply could not get enough of the seventeen song track list here. Thoroughly soaking in ""Up The Beach"", the true alternative MTV classic ""Mountain Song"", ""Three Days"", their signature tune ""Been Caught Stealing"", ""Ted, Just Admit It"", the wailing ""Summertime Rolls"", ""Stop!"", the (always) beautifully-played acoustic gem ""Jane Says"", ""1%"" and ""Ocean Size"". I encourage to you over-look other fan's reviews out there in Cyberspace that are negative because I truly believe that 'Live Voodoo' does a magnificent job of capturing a Jane's Addiction live performance as it should be done. Highly recommended.",1337040000,,989,5.036585365853658
4207365,1,B003UPPO1M,"I would have gotten more satisfaction by pulling a $20 out of my wallet and lighting it on fire. I'm a huge Jane's fan and saw them twice way back in 1991. This was so bad, and the crowd was so pathetic I would give it a 1 on the energy scale. I should have listened to the poor reviews. Don't kid yourself, this show was pathetic. Other reviews said ""going through the motions"" and that is right on the money. When I saw them back in the day it was nothing like this. To give you an idea of how bad this was, after about three songs (three too many!) this went into to a box to be shipped to Amazon for a trade in. Amazingly they gave me $5 for it and I feel like I ripped them off. When I watch a live show I want to see energy and crowd participation ala ACDC live at Donington! Save your cash...",1325116800,5,799,3.9079754601226995
4207366,5,B003UPPO1M,"ok .... the first time i saw jane's addiction live was in a little club, here in NM .... in 1985-86ish. before XXX, before anyone knew who they were, they were just a club band. i was BLOWN AWAY by them! then i saw them about a year later, after XXX came out .... blown away, again. when they finally released a full length album, i almost pee'd myself. THAT tour, i saw them here in NM, in colorado, and again in LA .... what i'm trying to say is this .... i have a history with this band, i have loved them from the start, and all these people saying that Perry has ""lost it"" or there is ""no passion"" are CRAZY.

 first of all, never expect album/cd quality lyrics from Perry live, it's NEVER happened. his live interpretations of the songs he wrote are NEVER the same as what gets released in recorded format ..... ever. it's loose, at best. but that's what makes it great, and in the moment .... ultimately, he's an artist and has proved that over, and over, and over.

 second, to the guy complaining about him drinking from his bottle of whatever it was, and the ONE comment he made about cocaine ..... a.) it's halloween and he's partying with his fans, never shows any signs of being drunk. he's weird, generally, and always has been. so he's acting like perry, not like drunk perry. i've seen this band through the years of drug abuse, and in THIS performance, he is connected to the audience .... something i can say was not always the case. and b.) the comment about cocaine ""you ever hear those voices when your on cocaine"" .... ummmm, hello .... it's part of his past. it's not a hidden fact that he struggled with many forms of drugs, but he came through it .... unlike some of the idiots who ended up killing themselves. and since it is a part of his past that he's overcome, he has the RIGHT to talk about it, and joke about it .... which is what this was, a JOKE.

  third, to the people bashing Perry for things he may, or may not, have done in the past to other members of this band .... Dave's still there, Stephen's still there  ..... so, him and Eric don't get along. that happens. if Perry was so horrible to work with, why is this still 3/4's of the ORIGINAL line-up? because these three respect each other enough to know that people say stupid things, do stupid things ... and while you can not take it back, ADULTS forgive each other and move on. i saw them with the original line-up,serveral times, and i've seen them with a number of the other bassests that have filled Erics place ... and while there is the slightest difference, it's never been enough to drive me away, or turn me off.

 i AM a diehard fan, from the very first time i saw them take the stage. i loved this live performance and am THRILLED that there is finally a high quality recording of them, doing what they do best. if you want to believe people who weren't there for the ride, and are referencing what jane's addiction ""was"", 20 years ago .... on a record, not live .... then believe them. but i'm telling you, as a fan for 25 years, who has seen them doin' it live more times than i can count .... this is THEM! rockin' like they always have ..... nothing has really changed. a few more wrinkles, a bit more gravel in the voice .... but, ultimately the same as they always have been ..... AMAZING!",1316131200,10,3300,4.282504012841091
4207367,1,B003UPPO1M,Just another sad example of an old band coming out of the wood work for a payday and going through the motions....none of the original emotions of the songs are present...just singing and smiling all the way to the bank. :-(,1309737600,,224,4.487804878048781
4207368,2,B003UPPO1M,"I've always liked Jane's Addiction.  They, at one time, had a lead singer who had a distinct voice and a unique ability to deliver irresistibly catchy vocal melodies combined with a very aggressive hard rock/heavy metal style.  The way it was done however, was quite original sounding.

However, this particular performance leaves me confused and disappointed.  It doesn't show any of the bands unique talents, and it actually shows Jane's Addiction as a very mediocre and generic alternative rock band, which they most certainly are not.  I can assure you- listen to their early albums, and you'll hear GREAT songwriting.

Perhaps Jane's Addiction just aren't a great live band, or maybe they didn't have the energy or dedication to rip out a stellar performance on this particular night, who knows?

I'm also not very fond of the way Perry Farrell curses while communicating with the audience.  It doesn't offend me, but I'd rather he not do that.

Anyway, just pick up one of the bands early studio albums.",1307232000,,1009,4.958333333333333
4207369,1,B003UPPO1M,"Jane's should have died in a plane crash in 1991. They can never recapture the glory of their heyday. It's sad and embarrassing to see them now. Except for Eric Avery, they're all sell-out hacks, recycling the same 15 songs they wrote more than 20 years ago. I don't know why I bought this DVD. I'm like an abused woman, hoping each time her husband would change. Buyer beware.",1302220800,3,377,4.478260869565218
4207370,4,B003UPPO1M,"This review is from: Live Voodoo [Blu-ray] [2010] [US Import] (Blu-ray)
It's taken a long time for Jane's Addiction to finally release an official live blu ray/dvd, and while we might have preferred something from 1990/91 when the band were on top of their game at least we get the original line up performing as opposed to the 97 reunion which had Flea on bass or the 2003 line up which had Chris Chaney on bass. Eric Avery(Who has since left the band again to be replaced by Duff McKagan) reunited with the band when they got back together in 2008 and they were much better live for it, those of us lucky enough to see the original Jane's line up on tour last year would no doubt agree!

So its the Voodoo Experience Festival, New Orleans, Halloween 2009 and the original Jane's line up are about to deliver a brilliant performance which see's them draw from their legendary studio albums 1988's Nothing Shocking and 1990's Ritual de lo Habitual as well as their self titled live debut release(2003's Strays has no material played from it mainly because Eric Avery did not appear on that album).

The band open up with instrumental Up The Beach before we hear Avery's familiar bass line as Mountain Song comes crashing out of the speakers. Without doubt some of Jane's best moments are in their longer songs such as 11 minute classic Three Days which has Dave Navarro playing one of the best guitar solo's ever as Perry Farrell dances with 2 scantily clad dancers(one of which is his wife Etty Lau) it's a song that could last 30 minutes and you'd still want to hear it again straight afterwards. On Then She Did Perry asks the crowd to celebrate death, the song still sounds as good as ever with all it's twist and turns, Been Caught Stealing really gets the crowd fired up, and just before the band begin Ocean Size Perry Takes a moment to reflect on the damage that hurricane katrina did to the city of New Orleans. Ted, Just Admit It is one of the highlights of the night as it reaches it's dramatic climax. For the encore Jane's play Jane Says and are joined on stage by loads of people in fancy dress, they then finish the night off with the Drum and Percussion heavy Chip Away.

The blu ray/dvd contains a small selection of extras the best being the two bonus tracks(1% and Ocean size) recorded in small clubs in 2008, as well as an NME featurette, the only draw backs about this release is that sometimes Perry's vocals seem a bit buried in the overall mix, but since official live Jane's footage is fairly thin on the ground this release is a must for Jane's fans!",1298505600,,2576,4.488272921108742
4207371,1,B003UPPO1M,"Wow am I glad I got to see Janes back in the day in small venues and of course the first Lalapoloza otherwise if my first encounter of them was this performance I would never had been a fan. There is no passion. I thought cool....the Mountain Song was the second song and that being one of my favorites especially the very first line. It used to come at you like a ton of bricks and at that point you new you were in for a ride. This version seemed like Perry was afraid to put any effort into the lyrics. It just went downhill from there. From Perry gallivanting around the stage like Mick Jagger to pretty boy Navvaro's close ups. I really think it is time to hang it up for good. Leave on a good note. There is just no ""umpph"" to this performance. Sorry Janes Fans...all this really did was keep saying to myself, ""remember when these guys rocked?""",1295308800,7,851,4.226993865030675
4207372,4,B003UPPO1M,"I was browsing through the blu-ray collection at my local Fry's and came accross this one.  I flipped it over to the back side and noticed that it was of a relatively recent event (Halloween 2009) and that Eric Avery was in it - that was enough for me to buy it!

I wasn't disappointed, and was happy to see Eric playing his parts flawlessy and with that unique bottom end precision that is unmistakable as the true sound of Jane's Addiction.  Dave Navarro and Stephen Perkins were also great.

I absolutely am a fan of Jane's Addiction music, however, after viewing this blu-ray coupled with the information I've read in the past about Perry Farrell and the crappy things he's done to the rest of the band, I'm definitely no fan of his - what a vapid immature narcissistic egomaniac.  I absolutely hate it when I go to a concert (or in this case, purchase a blu-ray) and the lead singer is getting drunk during the performance that I paid good money to see (Perry took several swigs from his bottles of what could have been wine or possibly something else?) and then talking about experiences with cocaine, which frankly, has no place during a performance!  Please be a professional and have some respect for those of us in the audience who want to experience a great (or at least good) performance.

Anyway, I recommend you buy it primarily for Eric Avery's performance, and secondarily for the performances of Dave Navarro and Stephen Perkins, and that you try to tolerate Perry Farrell's silly antics.",1294358400,2,1505,4.656603773584906
4207373,5,B003UPPO1M,"Always a gift to see these guys live, as I did twice on the tour before this show was recorded (Charlotte, Columbus), so the third time's a charm! Comparing the vocals of this show to the shows that I've previously seen isn't really fair, since it was about 5 months of touring later. Clearly, Farrell is running out of high-pitched vocal yieldings, but performance-wise, he is spot-on. Navarro, Avery, and Perkins are never wildcards-- they are consistently great in every performance I've heard and seen. I'd highly recommend this for any Jane's Addiction fan, but only a ""maybe"" for the newbies. It has a real nostalgia feel to it, so I'm really glad I own it.

I will add that Jane's toured with NIN for the middle part of the year, and for some unknown reason they opened up one extra date without NIN in Columbus Ohio on May 29th, 2009. This show was superb, magical, and vocally superior. The crowd was raucous, dangerous, and on edge at every moment. It rivaled the first show I saw in 1991. If anyone has a recording of this, it would be a shame not to share it with everyone, and and it would be ESPECIALLY for newcomers to discover the band.

Anyway, if you've ever seen these guys, and liked them, this is a must-have.",1294099200,3,1230,4.511210762331839

Blu-Ray picture and sound (DTS Master) are good, but not great.  Surround sound is virtually non-existent other than crowd sounds between songs.
