8292097,4,B001D72SM2,"This movie is so bad, it probably is worth more than they are asking for it. It is absurd and surreal with the stupidist dialogue ever put on film. Yet there is an undeniable charm to it. K. Gordon Murray did a dubious english dubbed version in the 60s that is not available. How I wish it was. Until it is all we have is this the original spanish language version with english subtitles. The title translates into ""Little Red Riding Hood and Tom Thumb Vs. the Monsters"". If you can sit through the sickening sweet songs you will be rewarded with the cheesiest looking monsters in history. One of the monsters is, I kid you not, a child abductor. Honest. You will probably need to slap yourself after this is over in disbelief. Highly recommended for lovers of bad cinema.",1392595200,2,772,4.4822695035460995
