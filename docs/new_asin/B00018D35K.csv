8007728,4,B00018D35K,"Brilliant dark look at the daily lives of working class London. Like every Mike Leigh film, as soon as it's done I want to watch more. Hopefully more films will be available for streaming on Amazon soon. Life is Sweet or Abigail's Party would be the top of my list.",1446336000,,265,4.32
8007729,5,B00018D35K,"Because Leigh went on to make films with greater production values, and because this is his early work, it's tempting to classify this as ""for aficionados"" rather than as important in and of itself.  Especially since we've seen films with this concept and style done by others.  But you know what?  This is, really, a great movie.

It's poetic and memorable and quite meaningful.  Leigh gets deep into things, unpretentiously.  Great art.",1419033600,3,438,5.013888888888889

8007731,3,B00018D35K,"Observation of lower middle class British families in 1973.  As usual with Mike Leigh films, there is one relative who has climbed up the economic ladder to a posh and stylish home.  Both households have their own particular types of nasty, hypercritical, and stingy behavior.  The one truly good character has silently allowed herself to be a doormat for so long there is nobody to root for in this bleak film.",1372636800,,411,4.76056338028169
8007732,5,B00018D35K,"I watch as many Mike Leigh movies as i can, repeatedly. He writes of life and social issues which interest me.",1372550400,5,110,4.285714285714286
