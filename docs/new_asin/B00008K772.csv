1848835,4,B00008K772,Really enjoyed this one.  It switches from film (outside shots) to video (for inside shots) which dates it a bit.  Sticks to Christie's story well.,1241395200,2,147,4.84
1848836,5,B00008K772,"This is an Agatha Christie ""almost"" Tommy and Tupence adventure.  Actually the beginning of their relationship and the beginning of their sleuthing before they come to known as ""Tommy and Tupence.

It is the classic county house murder mystery with all the elegant settings, glorious countryside, and ""English"" characters!
One glorious cameo is that of Joan Hickson, who later played Miss Marple, Agatha Christie's famous lady of St. Mary Meade.  In this story she is a London socialite who literally rips up the screen with her over the top performance in a strikingly beautiful Art Deco flat in town.

Many famous Brit actors are featured, among them John Gielgud, Eric Porter and of course Francesca Annis who has done so many delightful films and television performances.
Great costumes and elegant interiors combine with the senario of false identities, murder and intrigue in a bucolic Welsh coutryside setting.

One is struck by first rate acting all around and what becomes a joyful romp even with the sinister themes.  If you like English county house mysteries and nostalgia for the England that seems all but gone, this is pure pleasure!",1241222400,3,1148,5.079787234042553
1848837,4,B00008K772,"The acting was a bit stilted in this one but, all in all, not a bad rendition of a Christie favorite (I'm a HUGE Christie fan). The filming comes off as sort of soap-opera-ie for the indoor shots but the outdoor scenes are A-O-K. I confess (as a Christie apologist) that this is one of Christie's more inplausible mysteries but the director pulled it off darn good, without making his actors look ridiculous. I was especially impressed with the length of this film, quite long, and a good partial afternoon of DVD entertainment as far as I am concerned. To summarize, if you're an absolute Agatha Christie NUT, go ahead and consider this one a 5-star rating... however, if you are randomly looking around for ANY film to watch, regardless of genre, and have never seen a Christie mystery, you might find this to be a THREE.... (or a TWO!). I liked it a great deal and very much recommend it to appropriate fans.",1181520000,4,911,4.560975609756097
1848838,5,B00008K772,"Playing badly at golf witht the local doctor, starry-eyed Bobby Jones (James Warwick)discovers a body on the rocks below them. Before he dies, the man quietly says ""Why Didn't They Ask Evans?"" Bobby passes the job of waiting for the doctor and some men to carry the dead one back into town to a passerby so that he can play the piano for his father's sermons.

While helping out a friend with a stuttering problem and love of 1920 cars, Bobby meets up with old friend, and secret love interest, Lady Francis ""Frankie"" Derwent (Francesca Annis). When both join the trial to see if the dead man's death was accidental or not, Bobby points out that a picture isn't the one he saw in the dead man's pocket. Thus, the adventure of a lifetime begins for the three friends (Bobby, Frankie, and Bobby's friend)as they meet up with a crazy doctor, a dashing young man that sweeps Frankie off her feet, a drug addict and his nervous wife, and the doctor's equally crazy wife.

Agatha Christie's made for TV movie is a wonderful adaptation of the book. What I mostly like about it is that you never get bored and it makes you keep guessing right up until the last scene of the movie (which is really a surprise no one would've guessed). James and Francesca have the most interesting and real chemistry I've ever seen. I've seen them in Tommy and Tuppence some years ago, and I feel in love with the characters as well as the actors protraying them. A perfect example is when both are tyed up by the ""murderer"" in a locked room and Bobby's friend saves them, Bobby becomes upset that Frankie has feelings for another man, but Frankie says ""But, Bobby. I did miss you and I do care for you."" And the way they look at each other...it's magical. I couldn't even tell if they were acting sometimes.

My favorite short scene in the movie is when Frankie and Bobby, when trying to save someone and have little time to do it, fly to Frankie's estate and borrow her father's car. It's funny because you just see the father and than Frankie and Bobby run by with Franie screaming, ""Hi dad. Bye dad. Can't talk now, going to borrow the car.""

Anyway, ""Why Didn't They Ask Evans?"" is a wonderful film to me becasue of an interesting story with fake ID's and many twists and turns, thanks to Dame Agatha Christie, and the leads played by James Warwick and Fransesca Annis who play Bobby and Frankie, as well as Tommy and Tuppence, picture perfect. This is a good film to watch if you love Britsh movies or a huge Agatha Christie fan.",1137196800,11,2509,4.459694989106754
1848839,5,B00008K772,"In my opinion the star of this movie is Leigh Lawson, who plays the villain Roger Bassington-ffrench. (Yes, in England they really do have names like that!) Such an attractive villain! So handsome, so charming, so intelligent and sensitive that it is almost impossible to hate him. And he falls genuinely in love with Frankie (Lady Frances Derwent, played by Francesca Annis). It is true love, not just the result of cold, villainous  calculation. If I were Frankie I'd be sorely tempted to accept his offer (made in the superb final scene between them) of running away with him to a new life and making an honest man of him.",1099440000,6,625,4.681818181818182
1848840,3,B00008K772,"In 1981 London Weekend Television presented a three hour adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel WHY DIDN'T THEY ASK EVANS? (starring two actors who would go on to play Tommy and Tuppence in another series of Christie mysteries) James Warwick and Francesca (DUNE) Annis. In this adventure the two play amateur sleuths Bobby Jones and Lady Frankie Derwent in a 1920s murder investigation caper.

The story opens with Jones tackling a game of golf on the Welsh coast. Playing his ball onto the edge of a cliff he comes across the body of a man lying on the rocks below and his companion (the local doctor) goes to fetch help (seems a little backwards, but no matter). Regaining consciousness briefly the man utters the cryptic words `Why didn't the ask Evans?' and then passes away. Jones finds a copy of a ladies picture in the man's pocket - a woman he feels an obvious attraction towards.

Passing on the role of watcher over the dead body to a passing man so he can keep an appointment, Jones takes of without thinking anything of it but that it was a tragic accident.

However his suspicions are raised when the man's body is identified by means of the police tracing the girl depicted on the photograph they find on his body. However, this girls photograph is of a different person than that which he discovered.

What follows is an intriguing and well acted made-for-television feature. I did not notice any particular problems with the picture as was noted in other reviews, but the sound level did fade in and out and was at times distracting. This is not the best DVD transfer I have seen, but it also is far from the worst either.

Overall this comes recommended for Christie fans, not the best of her stories, but certainly one with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing to the very end.",1092355200,27,1804,4.607476635514018
1848841,5,B00008K772,"If you like the Agatha Christie Partners in Crime Tommy and Tuppence series, you're going to love this story!  Actually, it doesn't matter because this is an enjoyable 1920s mystery romp with just enough humor and romance blended into the more serious goings-on to please most everyone.  It's amazing how complex and LONG a story this is. I checked the online description and the back of the box, but I couldn't discover if this had been a television mini-series or just a lengthy made-for-TV movie.  Even though it's lots of fun, it does seem to go on forever!
The lead characters, played by Francesca Annis and James Warwick, are just as attractive a couple as they are in Tommy and Tuppence, except they don't seem to realize it until they've both had romantic ""flings"" with other characters in the cast. The sets and costumes look authentic 1920s, and the cars are particularly interesting, especially in the used car lot.

The only reluctance I had for giving this DVD release 5 stars is because of the uneven look of the movie itself.  Sometimes this looks like sharply focused videotape, and at other times it looks like fuzzy film.  This is probably because of the source material from 1980 rather than the fault of the DVD production, but it still should be noted.  This is the same ""look"" as on the earlier Upstairs, Downstairs programs.
Nit-picking aside, this is a thoroughly worthwhile DVD that should appeal to most mystery and Agatha Christie fans in particular.",1088035200,5,1477,4.8142292490118574
1848842,4,B00008K772,"And why indeed didn't they?  While this long, made for T.V. movie could have been much shorter if they simply had asked Evans, it would not have been nearly as enjoyable.  The script, adapted from an Agatha Christie novel of the same name, mimics the pace and rythem of the original quite well.  While the quality of acting was good, the picture quality of the DVD was grainy and the sound faded in and out at times.  The attempts at action and/or suspense via fights or late night escapades also did not come off very well partially due to the bad picture quality.  These scenes did not in any real way hinder the movie since the real fun is trying to solve the mystery before Bobby and Frankie do.  (If you find out who Evans is before they do, my hat is off to you!)  The last scene with the villain is a clumsy and implausable plot device (how many times is Frankie going to fall for the same ruse?) to the viewer to get a detailed description of the plot from the villain himself but  if you like mysteries in the Agatha Christie style, then you will enjoy this movie.",1058745600,9,1073,4.303482587064677
1848843,4,B00008K772,"As an Agatha Christie fan, I love the story. You do not know the murderer till the end. The acting is wonderful, typical british. Costume and sceen is beautifully selected. The only pity is the DVD effect is not obivious, maybe because the movie is comparably old - 1981",1057795200,5,270,4.530612244897959
1848844,5,B00008K772,"Why Didn't They Ask Evan's? is a terrific Agatha Christie mystery story (based on Christie's novel The Boomerang Clue) made into a terrific mystery movie. The plot, though a bit convoluted, is well developed and the excellent cast carries it out superbly. Although this is not one of Agatha Christie's biggest hits, it definitely is one of her best stories and as fine a Christie-based movie as I've ever seen.

The plot, however, is complicated with multiple twists and turns, and goes on and on and on.  I've enjoyed DVD's of a large number of Agatha Christie mysteries, but at just over three hours this is the longest one I've ever encountered. It was enjoyable and ultimately rewarding, although I kept checking the time and wondering if it would ever end.

1848883,4,B00008K772,"Bobby Jones and Dr. Thomas are golfing near the Welsh seacoast. You have to watch for hikers on those rugged courses. Bobby hits another atrocious shot and tells the Doctor, ""I thought I heard a shout. I hope I didn't hit anyone."" He goes to the cliff edge to try and find his ball, and spies the body of a man lying on the rocks below. They make it down to the beach to find the poor hiker barely alive, his back broken. Dr. Thomas leaves to get help, leaving only Bobby to see the man gain consciousness for a minute. Just long enough to say ""Why didn't they ask Evans?"" before dying, with a photograph of a beautiful woman in his pocket.

An inquest is held and the dead man's sister identifies him - apparently the picture in his pocket was of her. The only problem is, the photo the newspapers print is not the same photo Bobby saw on the dead hiker. This would remain a minor puzzle, soon forgotten, except Bobby receives a mysterious letter. He's 8 months out of the navy, and living with his father, when the letter arrives offering him 1,000 a year salary for a job in Buenos Aires - providing he leaves in a week. That's an extraordinary salary for the 1920's, when the average working man made 10 a month. To his father's disgust, Bobby turns it down. Not because he's suspicious, but because he's promised a friend he'd go into business with him.

The next week, Bobby is poisoned. Not to death, fortunately. Because he and childhood friend, Lady Frances ""Frankie"" Derwent determine to solve the case of the misidentified hiker, mysterious woman and Evans. As Bobby tells Frankie 2/3 of the way through: ""I've an idea about Evans. I've a feeling that although he's been the starting point, he really doesn't matter at all."" Well, he gets it almost right.

This British made-for-TV series originally aired in three parts in 1980. It's 188 minutes total, and if you watch it all in one sitting it will seem to crawl in some places and there's a bit of over-acting (including 35 year-old's acting 25 years-old). The mystery part of it is very good. Red herrings and suspects - I kept switching who I thought must be the murderer. There's some great dialogue (and sometimes too much exposition), occasional humor and improbable situations. ""Now I know how a mouse must feel when a cat won't quite kill it.""

I bought this because of the ""Agatha Christie"" in the title. It has an extraordinary treat - seeing Joan Hickson as a minor character whose personality is so far removed from Miss Marple (whom she didn't start playing until 1984), as to be disconcerting.

The next year, 1981, they aired another Agatha Christie:

1848904,4,B00008K772,"""Why Didn't They Ask Evans?"" was adapted by London Weekend Television in 1980 from the 1934 Agatha Christie novel of the same name. It's notable for being a long and faithful adaptation and for being the first in a series of successful Agatha Christie television adaptations following the author's death. In the Welsh seaside town of Marchbolt, Bobby Jones (James Warwick) and Dr. Thomas (Bernard Miles) are out golfing when they spot a man (Roy Boyd) who has fallen off of a cliff onto the rocks below. His injuries prove fatal, but before the man dies, he says to Bobby, ""Why didn't they ask Evans?"" Bobby removes a photograph of a lovely young woman from the dead man's pocket but replaces it before turning over watch duty to a passerby, Roger Bassington-French (Leigh Lawson), and rushing off to an appointment.

Returning from a London job hunt, of which his sour father the Reverend Jones (John Gielgud) does not approve, Bobby runs into a childhood friend on the train. The beautiful and stylish Lady Frances ""Frankie"" Derwent (Francesca Annis) is pleased to see him and thrilled to learn that Bobby will be testifying at the inquest concerning the death at the cliff, which she has read about in the newspaper. At the inquest, the woman in the photograph, Mrs. Amelia Cayman (Mitzi Rogers), apparently the sister of the deceased, testifies as to his identity. Bobby thinks that Mrs. Cayman doesn't resemble the photograph but thinks little of it -until someone puts a near-fatal dose of morphine in his beer. Frankie convinces Bobby that this must have something to do with the death, and she takes the initiative in what will be a long and convoluted investigation.

This adaptation includes more scenes and dialogue from the book than are strictly necessary, which account for a 3 hour 8 minute running time. For the first half of the film, it sometimes feels like we are hearing too much of the characters' thought processes. The interior scenes have an awkward staginess, like a play that was filmed. The cast is terrific, though, including a memorable supporting performance by Joan Hickson as the flamboyant and plain-spoken Mrs. Rivington. The detective duo of Frankie and Bobby are adventurous but nave, in a charming way. Francesca Annis and James Warwick made such an appealing couple that they were reunited 3 years later as Tommy and Tuppence Beresford in ""Agatha Christie's Partners in Crime."" The wardrobes are a pleasure to look at. The detectives are fun and occasionally comical. And they are true to their time, in contrast to more recent adaptations of period mystery novels for television.",1388793600,,2618,4.947727272727272

1848919,3,B00008K772,"At 180 minutes, this is a sprawling, rambunctious mystery in desperate need of some judicious editing.  Filled with never ending complications and a strange list of suspects, the story is primarily played for laughs.  The best of the humor is provided by Joan Hickson and John Gielgud.  Unfortunately, their characters are under utilized in only a couple of scenes.  The bulk of the silliness is left to Francesca Annis (Lady Frankie Derwent) and James Warwick (Bobby Jones).  Both are a bit dim but enthusiastic to solve the case of a dead man found on a beach, his dying words: ""Why didn't they ask Evans?""  These two untalented amateurs don't start investigating in earnest though, until someone attempts to poison Bobby.  ""Who'd want to put you out of the way?""  After that, it's a slow slog through false clues with a couple of clueless sleuths who take forever to get to the source of the intrigue.  Along the way, they continuously throw themselves into dangerous situations, they keep making the mistake of trusting the wrong people, and they continuously fail to notice the obvious until it's almost too late.  ""It's extraordinary how men like helpless women.""  More careless snoopers than detectives, it's a miracle they finally solve the crime(s) and live to share the tale.

7984856,5,B00008K772,"Bobby Jones (James Warwick) is pitifully attempting to play golf on ground above the cliff to the sea. He would most assuredly hit someone if the ball just gets that far. He hears a cry but just plays on. That is until the search for the ball takes him to the edge of the cliff where it appears that a hiker fell on the rocks below. Bobby rushes to the aid of the fallen man. The fallen man come conscious just long enough to say ""Why Didn't They Ask Evans?"" then expires.

From here characters pour in from all sides and you need to keep a score card and there are several doctors and mysteriously guilty looking people. You may guess some of the story but not all as they hold back most of clues until the last moment.

Once again Britton has excelled in bringing a great Agatha Christie story to life. They did not try to overstate or rush through the story. Also true to Christies writing they left in the characters instead of trying to homogenize them into fewer numbers for TV's sake.

We recognize the actors for other such stories:

James Warwick who trained at the Central School in London also played Tommy in Agatha Christie's ""Partners in Crime"" series.
Francesca Annis was Tuppence in the ""Partners in Crime"" series. But where I remember her most as Lady Jessica in ""Dune"" (1984).
Sir John Gielgud, a graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic arts in London played Hamlet on the stage.
The big surprise is the late Joan Hickson who made her stage debut in prudential theater in 1927 and played the best Miss Marple in the Agatha Christie series of movies. You may not recognize her but she was also the landlady in ""The Man Who Never Was"" (1956)",1505174400,17,1659,4.447368421052632

7984860,1,B00008K772,"I suspect that the movie is a good one, but we could not get the closed captioning to work.  The captions were several seconds ahead of the dialog, which forced us to read ahead and try to match up what was in the captions to what the actors were saying, sometimes two or more captions further along.  This was so frustrating that we stopped viewing it.  We also had a couple of glitches that were not directly connected to the captions.  We don't stream from Amazon very often, but we own many Acorn DVDs and have found their captioning to work well when viewing the DVDs.  I am going to try to watch stream the movie to my computer to see if the captions work there, but that is not the way that we want to watch the movie. We have had only minor problems with the CCs when streaming from Netflix on the same TV so don't think that the problem is in our TV or the Sony smart DVD player that we are using to do the streaming.",1475107200,,926,4.122222222222222
