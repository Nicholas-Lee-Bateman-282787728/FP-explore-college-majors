This was my first time seeing this movie and I would recommend it. Glad I have it in my collection now.",1441756800,2,187,4.222222222222222
8430050,5,B004I4B32S,"You never know what you get with D'Amato or  Jess Franco  and this effort kinda unusual to watch and understand what's  real life is and about. The combination of sex, music, good looking chicks and reality makes it a winner in my book.
Everything  filmed in Dominican Republic where I never been but will visit soon. His another strange title ""Papaya..."" even better  but lacks coherent music. If you addicted to good music try  Jess Franco ""The unconfessable orgies of...""",1402185600,4,474,4.8625
8430051,5,B004I4B32S,"Mark Shannon, after a visit to the doctor, receives news that his manhood must be removed due to cancer. His days are limited, so he schedules one final trip to an exotic island to fulfill his desires before the upcoming operation.

The hardcore scenes (these involve Annj Goren, Lucia Ramirez, and a couple of other women) are nothing extreme and just involve oral, masturbation shots and regular type sex; Goren and Raimerz look really good here.  There's a hardcore scene when Goren screws a guy next to an overweight girl who's screwing a couple of guys that's a little different than the rest of the scenes, but none of the hardcore sequences are what I would call extreme; even this scene isn't what I would call sleazy. With the exception of one sequence in a hotel room with Shannon and some other woman that's a little sleazy and harder, I didn't think any of the other sex scenes are sleazy. These other sequences are basically erotic and romantic. While these scenes won't win any awards, I thought that most of them are better than many of the hardcore inserts that I've seen in other D' Amato films. These scenes are linked into the story. The film does contain dialogue sequences as he meets various people, and the picture has beautiful locations and nice soundtracks. There's only one graphic gore sequence during the climax that involves what you might expect. Aside from that, there's only one death throughout the film. The movie usually has a calm tone and there's very little action, but there're some parts when Shannon is shown to be suffering from the spreading cancer.  You see nudity and sex scenes and excellent scenery, and a story is also present that does require some dialogue sequences. One of Fidenco's soundtracks called ""Sexy Night"" ( it's performed during a dance club sequence in this film ) is very good and is on YOUTUBE. The film is driven by Nico Fidenco's soundtracks, so you may not like the film that much if you don't like his music. I'm a fan of D' Amato, so I really liked his directing. However, the overall lack of action and intensity may be a problem with some. I gave it 5 stars because I'm a big D' Amato fan, but some may disagree with that rating.

The DVD quality isn't crystal clear because there's grain and assorted marks throughout the film. With the exception of that stuff, I still thought the quality looked really good overall. The deleted scene extra shows some hardcore masturbation shots in poor quality VHS.",1386460800,7,2475,4.695852534562212
8430052,5,B004I4B32S,"A Classic Joe D'Amato film. Part three of the Orgasmo Nero series. Exotic Malice, real title Sesso Nero finally receives its very over due USA DVD release. Released before my X-Rated Kult DVD on PAL format. The film clocks with a run time of 88mins. Little longer then the PAL DVD, which was 83mins.

Cover art is still wrong. Features cover for another D'Amato film, Papaya, Love Goddess of Cannibals. Original movie cover can be seen in the Beyond the Darkness ""Easter Egg"" on DVD.

The film has One, let me clarify that, One Special Feature or Extra. Its Deleted Scenes. Again, let me clarify the truth behind that. There actually is Only ONE Deleted Scene. But, now let me clarify again - the so called ""Deleted Scene"" is NOT from Sesso Nero. Its from another D'Amato classic, Hard Sensation. Also, its not a Deleted Scene from that film. They just took the scene from the film. That is all. Funny thing, besides it not being from the same movie - they didn't even try to remaster or clean up the Deleted Scene. Its widescreen scene, but put in a fullscreen box. Weird huh? Maybe, this means WE can expect to see them release Hard Sensations some time soon? That is another Great D'Amato classic.

Moving on to my next part of the review. The movie is in Widescreen format. Includes optional Eng. Subs. Quality transfer of the film is very well done. But, again there is some things I noticed wrong again. In at least two scenes, I noticed - there were audio/sound drops.

The soundtrack is Amazing on this film. My personal favorite of all D'Amato films. Music was composed by Nico Fidenco. He has done work on most of the D'Amato films. Such films like Porno Holocaust, Black Emanuelle series and Hard Sensations.

Over all, this title deserved it long awaited DVD release. Myself and other D'Amato fans I'm shore will enjoy finally getting their hands on NTSC version of the film with Eng. subs. One of Joe D'Amato's best (in my opinion).",1313452800,29,1945,4.609826589595376
