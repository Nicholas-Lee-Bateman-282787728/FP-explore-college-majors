7099816,5,B00VMX1IKA,"EXCELLENT documentary! Very well done! This is a MUST see for anyone who is interested in the unique history of Oklahoma City, or interested in the history of the national banking industry as it relates to the oil and gas sector during the oil boom & bust of the 1980's.

This is incredibly informative and very well done. My wife who does not like documentaries loved this!",1431561600,,374,4.582089552238806
7099817,5,B00VMX1IKA,"If you were in Oklahoma through this period - and even if you weren't and just have an interest in how much things can change - you will LOVE this movie/documentary.  I have lived in Oklahoma City almost my entire life - some 66 years.  My forebears made the run into Oklahoma (one of my relatives several generations back was Zane Grey, the author) and settled around Chickasha... my great grandmother used to dance at the barn dances with the Dalton Boys.  I lived the oil boom, the oil bust - and the failure of Penn Square Bank that caused the cascading failures of banks all over the country.  I worked downtown about 3  blocks from the Murrah Building - on the 29th floor of a skyscraper.  Felt the shock wave - it almost threw me out of my chair and all the ceiling tiles flew up and then crashed back down with a shower of dust.  Looked out the window and saw the debris cloud rising.  Have watched Oklahoma City recover, grow and prosper since then like no one would have ever imagined.  These were all times that will never be forgotten...  I had to buy the DVD to be sure I had this documentary to watch over and over.",1431216000,4,1129,4.308056872037914

7099819,5,B00VMX1IKA,"I'm not even from Oklahoma (Missouri), but I grew up during most of the boom and bust, certainly remember the bomb. Wonderful story of triumph. Anyone interested in bringing cities back to life, city government/leadership/activism should see. Well done.",1468627200,,253,5.512820512820513
7099820,5,B00VMX1IKA,Really enjoyed this documentary. Everyone from Oklahoma should watch this. This should definitely be shown in every Oklahoma Public School.,1468454400,,139,6.0

7099823,5,B00VMX1IKA,"For anyone who has, does, or will live in Oklahoma City this is an exceptional documentary about how Oklahoma City has not only survived some horrific economic times and homegrown terrorism, it has flourished in spite of them into the city it is today.  Very interesting and well done.  We bought a copy for all our friends.",1453334400,,324,4.666666666666667
7099824,5,B00VMX1IKA,"Mick Cornett has accurately connected the dots about Oklahoma City's high's, low's and heartaches.  I've lived in OKC for over 28 years and have supported the $.01 sales tax to revitalize the city (which it has made great strides).  When United Airlines chose to build a maintenance facility in Indianapolis rather than OKC, I didn't understand why - this documentary 'fills in the blanks.'  Through the Oklahoma Century Chest opened on April 22, 2013, I have had the privilege to get acquainted with the pioneers and city builders from the Land Run of 1889 to 1913.  Not only does the video tell 'what happened' but 'why it happened.",1447804800,,634,4.842592592592593

7099827,5,B00VMX1IKA,It was cool to see old photos of a time that I saw first hand fresh out of high school. Good job Mick.,1431561600,,102,3.4782608695652173
8710620,5,B00VMX1IKA,This is an AMAZING documentary.  I worked in the oil and gas industry and watched it all unfold.  Mick Cornett did a masterful job of weaving all the intricate details together taking us from the darkest of times into the light.  The interviews with various people who became a part of history through their insight as well as their bad decisions was spellbinding.  I never knew the backstory as to why Oklahoma City didn't get the Boeing plant until I watched this film.  It is fascinating to see and was over way too soon.  I watched this on OETA a few years ago and am now buying several copies of it to give to family and friends. Whether you grew up in Oklahoma City is irrelevant - the fall out from everything that happened affected all people from all walks of life.,1527638400,,774,4.415492957746479
8710621,5,B00VMX1IKA,"As a native of Oklahoma City, I lived here during the period of history outlined in this DVD, but I was a little young to completely understand how the bust came to be.  It was interesting to view this story, and I've passed it around to several people who liked it.",1501977600,,266,4.215686274509804

8710626,4,B00VMX1IKA,The history of Oklahoma City from the early 70's until the mid-90's.  I lived there from 1976-1985 and was very aware of what was going on economically in the city.  It was very nostalgic for me.,1474848000,,195,4.388888888888889
8710627,5,B00VMX1IKA,"As one who lived through this entire period, this documentary was masterfully done! Anyone who lives in Oklahoma City, has lived in Oklahoma City or has loved ones living in Oklahoma City should see this!  A great film!",1469404800,,219,4.7631578947368425
