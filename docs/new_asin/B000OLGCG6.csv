2797332,5,B000OLGCG6,"""Welcome to Sheetrock Hills! When folks need help, there's one person in town who always gets the call--Handy Manny, the best handyman around. At a moment's notice, Manny Garcia is ready to help. Whatever the job--erecting a new flagpole, fixing a broken trophy or repairing stairs--Manny gets it done with the help of his trusty set of mismatched, talking tools, who just love to put in their two cent's worth!

When you're Tooling Around with Manny and his boisterous bunch of tools, you'll find messages of teamwork, friendship and community."" -- From the DVD backing

My son's a bit older than the probably target age range for Handy Manny, but he still enjoys the colorful animation and crazy antics of Manny, tools and the citizens of Sheetrock Hills (I think it's hilarious how Mr. Loport's comb-over is always getting flipped!)

This particular DVD has a 55 minute run-time and features these five episodes:

1. Squeeze's Day Off (The only never-before-seen episode)
2. Amigo Grande
3. A Sticky Fix
4. Pat the Screwdriver
5. Supremoguy

There are two games: ""Build it with Handy Manny"" and ""Set-Top Game"".

If your kids like Bob Builder--or even Dora the Explorer--they'll likely love this DVD! (Spanish words are often peppered throughout the dialogue.) There are subtitles on Tooling around, as well.",1189468800,6,1310,5.041666666666667
2797333,1,B000OLGCG6,"My 2 y.o. son is a Handy Manny fanatic -- although he calls him ""Hammy.""  And so, when I learned that a new DVD was to be launched, I was quite excited.  Upon receiving the disc, I must say, I'm more than a little disappointed.  Of the 5 episodes, only 1 is new; all others are currently running on the Disney Channel.  Yeah, there is a game or two on the disc as well, but my I feel a bit cheated.

Shame on you Di$ney for not making this more clear.",1188345600,9,451,3.912087912087912
2797334,5,B000OLGCG6,Finally! we've been waiting for a DVD to come out of Handy Manny! My son's 2 and has been watching the show for a  year now. He loves the tools because they are just like daddy's! I think the show teaches good values like teamwork and problem solving without being condesending or preachy! We can't wait to own it!,1185494400,,314,4.322033898305085
2797335,5,B000OLGCG6,"My son is only five months and started watching (or rather looked toward the TV screen) Handy Manny at four months. While he might not understand the message the show brings he certainly loves the colors and shapes of the CG animation. I know this is a show I will want him to watch as he gets older and starts understanding words and the world around him.

Why this show? Because it displays some very good values without being preachy. Teamwork, honesty, integrity, and work ethic (not to mention a little spanish). Not to be all socio-political, but it also shows how to respect people of all social and economic classes. It's a very well written show for a young children's show, and I don't mean deep character development or anything like that. More like the pacing of the show is smooth with very few hiccups to move the simple story along.

The computer animation has a softer tone to it that makes me wonder if they were using some cell shading to give it the ""cartoon"" look and feel. Either way it's easy on the eyes. It looks like this DVD will have three episodes of the show plus a bonus, never before seen episode (Sweeze's Day off). Not much else besides and interactive game, but then again most parents get these DVDs to occupy their kid's time with the show, not the special features.",1184889600,6,1302,4.512711864406779

I love that Manny teaches kids Spanish, the value of friendship, that we all have a purpose, that we are all part of a team and when we work together we can succeed... and so much more! Manny is a great show for kids. We have a talking Manny with a toolbox and all of his tools that my son loves to play with, so I bought this movie as well as ""Fixing it Right"" so he can see Manny in action.",1367193600,,561,4.017857142857143

2797357,5,B000OLGCG6,"Handy Manny: Tooling Around is a Disney DVD based on the Disney Junior original series about a Mexican-American carpenter named Manny Garcia(voiced by Wilmer Valderama, Fez from That's 70's Show)and his team of talking tools, as they help out their friends with home improvement challenges in the town of Sheetrock Falls. Also, Manny is bilingual in English and Spanish so the young viewers can learn about the Hispanic culture. Although it has one interactive game and a few Disney sneak peeks, Handy Manny: Tooling Around is still a great Disney DVD to watch with pre-schoolers. :)",1365033600,,583,5.083333333333333

2797365,5,B000OLGCG6,"My grandson started first hearing the sounds from Handy Manny on the TV. He was fussy at a month old and as soon as Handy Manny came on, he quieted down immediately!. Now Mom is taping the show on TV and he is fixed to it. This new character is fantastic, and soothing to children. The music is great and the colors are bright and attracting to young children. I don't believe putting a child in front of the TV, but he did it all by himself..now he is 6 months and still stops dead while playing on the floor as soon as Handy Manny comes on!!!",1250812800,,544,4.093457943925234

2797368,3,B000OLGCG6,"Nothing much here to say, except kids love this stuff!  Ive built houses with my dad and loved construction since I was a kid so I can relate to the tools and projects.

Overall its a pretty decent movie, and a nice change of pace from watching Spongebob repeatedly... ;(  It has enough of an educational aspect that I think its worth it.  My nephew seems to enjoy it and hes learning the names of tools and the idea of what they are used for so its good for that purpose.",1235520000,,472,4.153846153846154
