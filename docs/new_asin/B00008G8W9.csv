1844668,3,B00008G8W9,"I think these are probably a little better made then the baby einstein videos however my active 2 year old wouldn't watch more than 5 minutes of this at a time.  It just couldn't hold his attention.
We also just bought The Leap Frog Letters DVD and he is actually really enjoying that one.",1212019200,2,289,4.351851851851852
1844669,3,B00008G8W9,"This is alot like flash cards on TV.  I sit with my twins while watching this talking about it with them, about 2/3 thru the dvd we all are ready to goudge our eyes out.  It gets irritating very fast imo.  Some kids and parents may really like this dvd, it just didn't fly at our house.

I (we) do very much like the 2 other Brainy Baby dvds we have : ).",1205798400,2,354,3.808219178082192

1844671,5,B00008G8W9,"Ok I have to say this is one of the best.  I have a couple of the Baby Einstein DVD's for this age group and my son who is 28 months loves this Brainy Baby DVD.  He'll look through all of our DVD's for it and pop it into the DVD player on his own and start watching it.  He'll repeat about everything that they try to teach like with the numbers, colors, and words.  The only draw back is that it's kind of long for a two year old.  It's 45 min.  He'll watch it for about 15 min, then he may go off and do something else and while it's still playing, he'll come back to the tv to start watching it again.  All in all, this is a great educational DVD.  Must have!  Hey for the younger babies too;  I have a 5 month old that loves classical baby by HBO, my 2 year old, loves that DVD too.",1171152000,15,786,3.7962962962962963
1844672,5,B00008G8W9,"I have a few Baby Einstein DVDs, but I favor the idea of having a narrator explain the objects and actions on these Brainy Baby DVDs because it provides not only a visual representation, but a verbal one as well.

I currently own Brainy Baby Left Brain, Right Brain, Art, and English. I purchased these when my daughter was about 9 months old. She is now 14 months  and has started clearly verbalizing since she turned 12 months. She is pointing to objects around her and saying many of the words in these shows, particularly from Brainy Baby English.

This DVD reinforced the learning of her body parts, shapes, colors, animals, and more. I couln't be more satisfied. I also purchased this for less at deepdiscountdvd with no tax and free shipping.",1166313600,7,749,4.659090909090909
1844673,5,B00008G8W9,"I have 18 month-old twin boys who are just beginning to talk and communicate with us.  There are a few other videos (DVD's) out there for 'first words', but this has been the most complete.  Not only does it cover a lot of common words, but it also teaches some concepts like (put on or pushing something).

The boys really do like watching the real people and objects in each scene, and they appear to be taking everything in.

I am not what you would consider a 'flash card mother', but I do appreciate constructive entertainment.  This seems to really help both of them with their communication.",1132358400,21,598,4.5514018691588785
1844674,5,B00008G8W9,My two year old is speech delayed and I purchased this video along with Brainy Baby ABC's.  He loves it!  I hear him imitating and saying the words and as a parent I am pleased to give him a break from the puppet based shows.  I love puppet based shows just like he does but he doesn't miss them at all in this video.  Looking  forward to buying more....much better results and attention than Baby Einstein or Baby Bach.  Two thumbs up!!!,1117584000,34,438,4.280487804878049
1844766,5,B00008G8W9,"I have fraternal twin girls, age 18 months.  They have been watching this show about once a week along with the other Brainy Baby shows and a few of the Baby Einstein DVDs (I put a dvd in to occupy the babies while I eat breakfast or take a shower in the morning...poo poo to you who argue about babies watching TV...you have to HAVE some time to do some things for YOURSELF so chill out already).  One of my babies is on the normal spectrum of things with walking and talking.  My other baby is on the slower end, she crawled late, isn't yet speaking.  BOTH OF THEM ADORE THIS SHOW!  Some of the other dvds I will put on and they will fuss a little bit but with this one, there is complete silence.  This morning I was changing my babies diaper and she was holding one of her small baby plastic hangers.  She was showing it to me and I said ""hanger"".  She looked at it and then looked up at me and pointed to it saying ""triangle"".  OMG!  She has started pointing to parts of my face and saying ""eyes"", ""nose"", etc.  With twins and a six year old I try my best to have play time and teaching time with them (I try to do them together).  I know FOR SURE that my baby learned the words from this show!  Amazing, really amazing.  The music is beautiful and there is a mixture of baby toys and babies (which they adore watching).  I am so impressed with the Brainy Baby shows.  I like them better than Baby Einstien.  All of them are excellent.  But if you only get one, get this one.",1265760000,2,1480,4.115384615384615
1844767,5,B00008G8W9,My daughter really enjoyed this DVD and it was very educational for her.  It really helped her to start talking and understanding words.

1844768,5,B00008G8W9,"This was shipped quick. Our son isn't quite old enough for it, but he loves watching the other children and babies. We don't want the t.v. to be his babysitter, but it comes in handy when my child's restless and I have chores to do around the house.
The video usually puts him in a better mood, and he even fallen asleep while watching. We bought one other B.B. vid, and plan to buy more.",1242172800,,388,4.1866666666666665

1844770,1,B00008G8W9,"I like the Brainy Baby line, but this video, although has great information, did not keep my one year old interested at all.

1844771,5,B00008G8W9,"Brainy Baby cds are great products. My 1 year old daughter enjoys this video. She watches it as she begins her nap and and bedtime. She knows her nose, feet, hands, and mouth. I love they way she enjoys laying and watching the dvd. I thought she had to have the ""Your Baby Can Read"" by Dr. Titzer in order for her to begin early learning. But, she did not. This cd is just as good but less affordable. It is enjoyable for her and impressive to me. It is not boring. It has lots of live babies, they spell out the alphabet, count numbers, show parts of the body and so forth. She has even begun to say words like please and our names. My husband and I love the way she is progressing and plan to buy more to alternate her viewings. (We don't want her to get bored.)",1234656000,,764,4.066225165562914

1844773,5,B00008G8W9,"I was hoping for a more extensive vocabulary.

This video is good for a none English speaking household.

1844774,2,B00008G8W9,"I bought this video because I'm working with my son to try to get him to start saying some words.  This video got great review, thus being the reason for my purchase of this specific product.  It was so boring that it put my son to sleep!  We watched it after he had gotten up from his nap, actually.  It's no better than Baby Einstein - which is a great concept for the little ones - but not good for toddlers.  My son can communicate very well receptively, which might be the reason for him not having any interest in this video.  We bought a Baby Babble video which seemed to engage him much better.",1216944000,2,602,4.191304347826087
1844775,5,B00008G8W9,"Brainy Baby dvd are not as popular as Baby Einstein, of course Baby Einstein are from Disney, so more money is spent on advertisement; im my home, Brainy Baby dvds have been much more effective in teaching my children.  The programming is of good quality and my children learned not only what the dvds taugh, but also how to read the words for every concept taught (my six year old was reading the brainy baby words by age 2yrs, 3mos, my four year old by age 1yr, 11mos, I now have a nine month old, lets see...",1216598400,,511,4.268041237113402

By just watching and participating with these discs he has learned all his ABCs, letter sounds, shapes and colors along with how to count to 100 which is great for his age.

The AAP recommends ""2 hours of quality programming, per day, maximum"". Of course this is a recommendation based on who knows what studies on who knows what subjects over who knows what period of time with who knows what expected outcomes. Which is to say, I'm not one of those parents who believe video education is an instant brain musher. People are exposed to plenty of brain mushing stuff throughout their lives (10 minutes of Superbowl commercials can attest to that) and they still manage to learn and function just fine. I think the AAP is just trying to steer parents away from TV babysitters which is an idea I can agree with. Besides, kids will get bored with any medium and will get more from a healthy variety of formats.

Some complain this video is bad because their child didn't take to it. In all fairness, every baby is going to appreciate educational materials differently. For that reason I can't recommend this video to everyone. Rather, I suggest going to your local library and renting a copy if they have one on hand. Brainy Baby videos use many of the same actors/illustrations/sets/format so if they don't have a specific title you'll still get a sense of pacing and format.

For the first couple of viewings I suggest you provide supervision, siting nearby, injecting whatever you feel supplements what you see and hear (i.e. missing context, additional examples or even funny commentary). If you're lucky, as I was, your child will love this video and get hours of educating entertainment from it. If this isn't for your baby, don't let it frustrate you. There are a variety of brands (Baby Einstein, Leap Frog, etc.) your baby may respond to and, hopefully, learn from. And if no video works, then perhaps your baby will take to music, books, flashcards or verbalization.

As for us (baby and I), my child transitioned to the Brainy Baby series after several viewings of the ""My Baby Can Talk"" sign language DVDs (an excellent video learning series for very young babies, by the way) and Baby Bumblebee brand ""Action Words"" (1 & 2) DVDs. We checked out different videos from the library and my baby took very quickly to the Brainy Baby line which prompted me to purchase the Brainy Baby ""Grow With Me"" 3 Disc set. The set includes:

Right Brain (rec. for ages 9mo-2yr)
Left Brain (rec. for ages 9mo-2yr)
Peek-A-Boo (1yr-3yr)
Laugh & Learn (1yr-3yr)
Shapes & Colors (1yr-4yr)
ABC's (1yr-4yr)
123's (2+ yr)
Animals (2+ yr)
Art (2+ yr)
Music (2+ yr)

My baby is definitely on pace with these at 22Mo. and has picked up a lot of letters and words from the ABC's disc. She could watch these endlessly if I let her and asks for them excitedly. The only limitation with the set is some titles (Art, Music, Animals) are too advanced for her so I wanted to add an age-appropriate, vocabulary based title. I hoped ""English"" wasn't too advanced and was lucky enough to preview a copy from the library. As I'd hoped, it fits in really well between ABC's/123's and Animals/Art/Music. It borrows many actors/shots from the other series so it is new while being familiar for baby. The format is a little fast-paced so a little background on these words helps (i.e. Brainy Baby ABC's and 123's provide a good foundation).",1268697600,19,3948,4.7730600292825764
7983201,5,B00008G8W9,I have 16 month old twin boys and they love this DVD.  It moves at a great pace and holds their attention.  It moves on to various learning topics and reinforces what they have learned.  I also have Baby Einstein DVD's but I like the Brainy Baby products because they speak and also display words.  All kids learn differently but this one works for me and my boys.  I have 10 other episodes of Brainy Baby DVD's and I have to say this one is the best one if you only buy one to try them out.,1268092800,,491,4.020618556701031
