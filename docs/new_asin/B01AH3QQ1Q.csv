7600108,2,B01AH3QQ1Q,"Clearly the first ""Ride Along"" made money so here we are again! Director Tim Story has brought back some of the old gang and signed up some new faces. The scriptwriting team is once again headed by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi.

Our wannabe cop wants to ride along with his soon-to-be brother-in-law in hopes that he too, might make the grade. The Atlanta PD has a hot tip about an important witness in Miami whose capture might be just what he needs to be taken off probation and sworn in as a ""real"" police officer.

We watch:
  * Ice Cube (""22 Jump Street"") returns as by-the-book James Payton, a no-nonsense policeman who is the real deal. He IS touchy about his sister's choice for a husband.
  * Kevin Hart (""Get Hard"") Motormouth bungler Ben Barber is hot on the trail of that witness but he keeps seeing hydrangeas in the plans for his upcoming wedding, which is a distraction for a person who has problems focusing.
  * Tika Sumpter (""Get On Up"") Gorgeous Angela Payton can't convince Ben that her wedding planner's ideas are better than his so she talks her brother into taking him along to Miami so she can finalize those wedding plans.
  * Bruce McGill (""Rizzoli & Isles"") Lt. Brooks wants that witness from Miami to testify against a drug kingpin. He forbids Barber to go along.
  * Benjamin Bratt (""Justice League"") Antonio Pope is a prominent Miami citizen known for his generous contributions to civic enterprises. Where does he get all that money?
  * Ken Jeong (""Dr. Ken"") A.J. is a computer hacker extraordinaire. Plus, he listens in on phone conversations. Consequently, his life is in jeopardy.
  * Olivia Munn (""The Newsroom"") Maya is a capable police officer with the Miami PD. They are trying to shut down a major importer of illegal contraband. She's by the book, so Ben bewilders her as he ricochets onto the scene.

This PG-13 script offers too much over-the-top humor, nutty situations and vehicular mayhem. Expect lots of gun play and plenty of blowie uppie stuff.

SPOILER ALERT: I was sorry to learn that the only incident that made me laugh out loud is included in a trailer. ...sigh...",1452902400,,2116,4.672972972972973

Read a review that begged ""I hope they don't make a 3rd""; I understand that feeling,
unless they make it much darker (wife gets kidnapped/Miami cop shot) + Kevin Hart's
humor thrown in periodically....but that's probably too close to Central Intelligence 2.",1515456000,,345,5.0701754385964914

7600147,5,B01AH3QQ1Q,"""Ride Along"" turned out to be pretty good entertainment, so I gave ""Ride Along 2"" a chance.  Again, Ice Cube keeps this movie from being utterly stupid (which, movie-wise, isn't always a bad thing either) and plays off Kevin Hart's ditzy character to perfection.  They get a boost from Ken Jeong as a hacker nerd, and it works so well that....""Ride Along 3""? Let's hope! Like its predecessor, ""RA2"" is well worth a night on the couch with a big bowl of popcorn.  Highly recommend this series.",1492214400,,492,4.632183908045977

7600201,1,B01AH3QQ1Q,Hands down top ten of my least favorite movies that I expected to be decent. I like Kevin hart and ice cube there's no denying that just that in this movie Kevin does the most he needs to settle down a bit some parts were funny just Kevin was a bit too much like your neighbors freaking chihuahua that won't shut up it's seems that 80 percent of the movie was just Kevin acting ignorant. It also feels like they didn't even try when putting this movie together they just slapped together a plot and storyline and called it good and hoped Kevin would carry the team. This was just my opinion but if you want to watch it for yourself then good luck! Hope you enjoy it because I didn't.,1484870400,,683,4.221374045801527

that it makes it stale. I've seen scenes taken from Beverly Hills Cop,
Rush Hour, Swat, Bad Boys, and The Hangover. I usually like Kevin Hart,
but his performance in this movie seemed a little forced. It could've been a
better movie if they smoothed out some of the rough spots. Ice Cube's
character has a love interest that goes nowhere. Kevin Hart's character
is overly concerned about the details of his upcoming wedding. Ken Jeong's
character is somehow fit enough to outrun cops and bad guys through the
streets of Miami, but he still needs the help of the police....what?!",1468627200,,649,4.752212389380531

7600456,4,B01AH3QQ1Q,"An entertaining sequel to the first ride along with laughs all around. If you didn't like the first movie I don;t know why you would try the second. However, if you did like the fist then this is right up your alley. I found the movie funny enough to stick around even after I knew the plot. As they say it's the journey not the destination that makes it worth it. Most certainly that saying applies. Even the ending was hilarious!
Kevin Hart is a personal favorite, I've seen all of his movies and I love his humor. The addition to Kevin's outrageousness is Ice Cube's portrayal of a no nonsense investigator. The movie reminds me of a take on Rush Hour.

What I didn't like: the easy to follow plot. Nowadays it's hard to come up with something that hasn't been done. Outside of Interstellar, which made me question my existence, I haven't been shocked by a movie. Don't get me wrong I loved the movie. It's perfect for a night in when you don't want to think too much. But don't expect a huge twist...or I'm double crossing you and setting you up for a better experience, only one way to find out!",1468281600,,1100,4.365853658536586

The combination of tough guy Ice Cube and the little napolean complex character that Kevin Hart is so good at playing was just hilarious.  This is one sequel that actually stands up to the first movie.  It is like an action movie with a ton of comedy.  We were very pleased with this movie and would probably watch again.  Kevin Hart is just so funny, because half of the movie is basically making fun of him.  He delivered once again.  Ice cube was actually funny too.  The acting was so good all around.  We are still reciting lines of this movie weeks after watching. You know that is a good movie.  Definitely recommend this one if you are searching for a good laugh!",1466467200,,728,4.398496240601504

Kevin Hart delivers.  Ken Jeong too.  There are a few giggles every few minutes.  Mostly amusing or silly--never hilarious.  The bulk of the movie is a waiting game.

7600739,4,B01AH3QQ1Q,"PLOT...
The RIDE ALONG 2 sequel picks up about a year after our heroes' last adventure. Plans for a quick trip to Miami go bad. With the wedding upcoming, James reluctantly takes Ben with him to Miami to follow up on a lead connected to a drug ring case he's been trying to crack. In Miami, they meet Maya, a no-BS homicide detective, They also encounter AJ, a cocky computer hacker who reveals evidence that implicates a well-respected local businessman, the wealthy Antonio Pope. Pope rules South Florida's drug trade. If Ben and James can convince the authorities that Pope is a brutal crime boss they'll stop his spree. If they fail, well there may not be a wedding after all.

Like the original this is a wise cracking joke per minute predictable small budget actioner that's just so incredibly entertaining mainly due to the great and lovable characters played by Ice Cube and Kevin Hart, the movie is highly funny mainly like I said if you love the cast, its certainly a movie that puts the comedy before anything else and the jokes are funny mainly from Hart who never stops! There is some fun action scenes like the GTA style POV car chase where Hart thinks he's playing a video game, it has a simple story that is highly predictable and been done a million times before but its just one of those movies where you don't care because your having so much fun with it. Great soundtrack too! If you loved the original you will easily like this, its a very distinctive taste of movie, you either love it or hate it, personally I think Cube and Hart are genius together.

Picture looks good in HD on the Blu-ray, Running time 1hr-41mins, 2016.",1464652800,,1646,4.5574324324324325

I found Ride Along 2 to be more action packed than the first but with similar villains with a similar motive and overall just a similar plot line. Ice Cube and Kevin Hart have a great on screen chemistry together but I think the addition of a couple of new characters (Ken Jeong and Olivia Munn) added to the story line. Overall, Ride Along 2 is definitely worth the watch.",1464652800,,485,4.170212765957447
7600743,3,B01AH3QQ1Q,It was ok. Haven't really seen any movies in a long time that i really really like. It has some good parts but thats about it. Only worth renting. I just don't think they make them as good as they use too.,1464566400,,205,3.9047619047619047

7600745,3,B01AH3QQ1Q,"I like the original Ride Along and I think the seriousness of Ice Cube and the silliness of Kevin Hart make a good combo, so I was looking forward to the sequel.  Comedy sequels tend to be a letdown as they rarely live up to the first in terms of originality and laughs.  That is the case here as the sequel just isn't as funny as the first.  The story is a similar rehash of the first and although there is great chemistry between Ice Cube and Hart, the laughs just aren't as frequent as they should be.  It is almost like the movie takes itself a bit too serious.  There are some funny moments though that made me laugh and plenty of action that kept me interested and watching.  As far as comedy sequels go, this is better than some sequel attempts, although not as funny as the first.  Its an entertaining, yet forgettable way to spend a movie night.

Kevin Hart is a bird though. He's what I call, 'annoyingly funny'. You definitely have a love/hate relationship with him, but Ice Cube is who I watch it for anyway. Love him!
This is a typical cop gets drug lord movie, so don't expect too much from it in the way of a plot. Still, it's good enough for chilling with the hubby.
The hubby liked it, probably more than I did. He thought it was kinda funny, but he loved the action and things blowing up, y'know guys... lol...

7600878,2,B01AH3QQ1Q,"Ride Along 2,"" the sequel to 2014s Ride Along, once again has Atlanta detective James Payton (Ice Cube) working with rookie beat cop Ben Barber (Kevin Hart) to follow a lead in a drug-ring case. What starts out as a two-day trip to Miami turns into an extended series of comic missteps, with Ben running the risk of missing his wedding as his fiancee, Angela Payton (Tika Sumpter), James sister, organizes their big day back home in Atlanta.

Hart and Ice Cube have easy screen chemistry, effortlessly bouncing zingers and one-liners off each other while doing some dangerous sleuthing. Comic screen duos have been popular at least since the days of Laurel and Hardy, extending through the comedies of Abbott and Costello, Hope and Crosby, and the antics of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. In recent years, the pairings have been sometimes successful, other times not, but Hart and Ice Cube have clicked. Together or separately, they provide some funny moments in a film that is quite similar to the original only bigger. Theres the squabbling, the inappropriate cop behavior, the awkward situations on the job, and the many examples of poor judgment that drive the comedy. The plot is predictable.

Sequels strive for one thing  to make more money than the original by amping up what is perceived to have made the original a success.  It is disappointing how unimaginative Ride Along 2 is. Yes, we have the characters we enjoyed watching once before, but the writers and director Tim Story cover well-trod territory.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include deleted scenes, gag reel, Ride Along With Us (in which Ben and James host a police departments recruitment video), behind-the-scenes featurette, close-up look at the chemistry between Kevin Hart and Ice Cube, and feature commentary with director Tim Story.",1461542400,,1825,5.029801324503311

7600901,2,B01AH3QQ1Q,"I watched this on ShowBox last week, and I must say, it got off to a slow start.  For one, I think Kevin Hart's ""little man being pushed around"" shtick is old. He's overly exposed and needs to come up with a new ""gimmick.""  I guess because I'm tired of seeing Hart in the same ole roles, this movie wasn't really funny to me.  It was so boring, I got through maybe 50 minutes before I started skipping through it.  Some scenes were redundant and unrealistic.  I think the only reason I really watched this movie is for Ice Cube.  Now that I think of it,  he was the only reason.  I do like Tika Sumpter and hopes she goes far in her career.  I know that I didn't like this movie because I know that I wouldn't watch it again.  Didn't keep my attention.  I wouldn't even suggest this to someone else.  They shoulda just left it at the first movie.  I figured they'd do another one (after the first one), and I knew that any more sequels would resemble the first.  Waste of time IMO.",1458086400,,981,4.176470588235294
7600902,4,B01AH3QQ1Q,"Hes like an accidental genius. James (Cube) is on the trail of a drug dealer and his sources and evidence has led him to Miami. Not wanting him to go alone the Captain tells him he needs a partner. After some convincing he agrees to take Ben (Hart) with him. Ben is is typical helpful self and as usual causes more harm then helps, but when he does find a way to help it changes everything. I was not a big fan of the first movie for one reason. I think Kevin Hart can be a little irritating and obnoxious sometimes. He is funny is small doses but for the most part he is hard for me to watch. That said, he was a little more toned down in this one that the first one. In terms of this movie, much like the Hot Tub Time Machine series I thought this one was a much better movie but not as funny as the first one. To me that is strange because this is essentially the same thing as the first one with just a few changes. The biggest difference is that Hart didn't seem to try to hard and just let his natural comedy show, which really helped a lot. Overall, fans of the first one will love this as well, if you didn't like the first one you may not be all that impressed with this one either. I give this a B.",1457654400,,1208,3.9549180327868854

7600904,3,B01AH3QQ1Q,"If I could give it 3.5 stars I would but I don't have that option, this movie's about as good as the first.

If you liked ride along you'll probably like ride along 2, it's got more of the same type of humour and the same characters joined by some new characters, Ice Cube and Kevin Hart return to their previous roles after Hart's character graduates from the police academy, he doesn't want to be just some beat cop, he wants to be a detective just like his soon to be brother in law ( Ice Cube ).
Ice has to go to Miami FL for a case and Hart wants to go with him, they fly there take out a few bad guys Hart does his big mouth thing, Ice Cube does his tough guy thing and well I don't have to tell you anything else because you have already seen this movie.

Sometimes it's funny, sometimes it's not but at least it's not unbearably offensive and rude like so many other comedies made today.
I saw it the other day and I enjoyed it for the most part, that being said it's not a movie I will watch again, at least not now anyway.

A fun movie worth watching once.",1454976000,2,1066,4.018867924528302
7600905,4,B01AH3QQ1Q,"Our unlikely duo teams up again. After they make a bust in Atlanta the trail leads them to Miami as they chase A.J. (Ken Jeong) ""a low budget Jackie Chan"" who can read the thumb drive they captured. This was one of a number of such lines that could be taken out of the context of the script, At one time Hart says to Ice Cube ""You want to be responsible for ruining my career?"" I could see that. Or When Hart feels he has to tell us, """"I'm acting.""

Once again Hart saves the film and Ice Cube (In more than one way) and uses skills he learned from video games, perhaps the memorable scene of the feature. Bad guy Benjamin Bratt appears to be impersonating Ricardo Montalban for much of his role. I was waiting to hear something about Corinthian Leather, but it never happened.

The film was fun on the formula scale. I had one delayed Laugh Out Loud moment. It is a film you can rent or wait until it flops in price.

3 1/2 STARS

Guide: 2 f-bombs. No sex, or nudity. Bikinis and some sex talk. Toned down from first film.",1454198400,,1023,4.177664974619289

I am still preordering it just like I did with the first one, because I know it's going to be good. They probably just say negative reviews so people won't go see it, which is the same with Alvin and the Chipmunks.",1453939200,,336,4.106060606060606

Can't compare it to the first one either but i thought it was worth the price of admission.  Kevin hart is always a plus when it comes to comedy and ice cube makes a great duo for a comedy.

Not sure why all the negative reviews i enjoyed the movie and im sure alot of others did too they were laughing throughout the movie...",1453507200,,414,3.963855421686747
7600908,2,B01AH3QQ1Q,The movie was underwhelming with little to no laughs. I enjoy Ice Cube and Kevin Hart as comedian actors but their latest film just wasn't good at all. If you'd like to read a more thorough review please visit thecinemascore.com and subscribe.,1452988800,,243,4.809523809523809
