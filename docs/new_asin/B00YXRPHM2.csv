7269334,5,B00YXRPHM2,I absolutely love fantasy stories like these. You will enjoy the visuals and the graphics. Smaug you can come and be my pet dragon any time you want. I always wished for a pet dragon; even as a kid. I would recommend this movie to any one who loves mideval stories and time pieces. This is part two of the Hobbit trilogy. Smaug come and let's fly on the winds with those great crimson wings of yours. And let's go burn something with your fire breath. I love you Smaug. I would take such great care of you.,1450569600,2,506,4.173469387755102
7269335,5,B00YXRPHM2,"I wanted this edition because I can choose Japanese as the spoken language and caption; it has more language choices than other editions.  Just what I was looking for, and it's not that easy to find.",1447027200,,199,4.527777777777778

7269337,5,B00YXRPHM2,"If you saw this movie in theaters, you have to have the ""extended version"" which includes so many scenes that were left out.  Just like the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy....the extended version DVDs that came out after the movies shown in theaters were so much better because so many things were explained that made the ""LOR"" Trilogy so much more enjoyable.",1444176000,3,355,4.725806451612903

7269340,5,B00YXRPHM2,"Always, always, always get a director's cut if you can find it!

In my own opinion, movies are shortened so as viewers do not have to leave the theaters to use the restrooms.  This means a lot of good footage is deleted in order to shorten the running time.  At home, watching one on DVD, one can hit the ""pause"" button on the remote for the same purpose, or to make a snack, so the length of a directors's cut on DVD doesn't matter at all.",1518220800,,440,4.093023255813954

7269342,5,B00YXRPHM2,"It is exactly as advertised on the site and arrived in excellent condition. Though the box of the set looks a bit less like a book than the Lord of the Rings trilogy box sets do, it still looks smart on a shelf.  The artwork on it is top notch.  The best parts are the extra minutes of film that you didn't see in theaters and especially the commentary and documentaries.  I find the process of making movies as fascinating and entertaining as the films themselves. After buying The Fellowship of the Ring on the regular DVD only to see that they re-released it like this later on, I've waited for the extended special editions of the other LOTR and Hobbit movies. It's worth the wait.",1509321600,2,685,4.420634920634921

7269353,2,B00YXRPHM2,"I re-watched this movie recently. I'm not a purchaser myself, however the copy we have was bought by a family member who is more immune to boredom than me.

This movie is the second of the three part Peter Jackson movies expanding Tolkein's The Hobbit into a wannabee epic. It follows the lead of the first movie (The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey) to endlessly expand the children's story to the point where no child would watch it unless they were sedated or so sick with a fever that they couldn't escape - not that the movie is in any way appropriate for children.

The extended version runs over three hours if you could imagine. The theater version is a few blissful minutes shorter but no less cluttered with chaff. (At least the series is shorter than Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelunge).

We all know the plot: Bilbo, Gandalf and the dwarves have escaped the first of many brushes with Orcs and have continued their journey. They are pursued by a one armed Orc who is not found in the book, with more interruption here and there for backstory, right up to Beorn's door where, instead of a delightful interval as guests of a peace loving giant they are regaled with horrible stories of torture and imprisonment. They proceed on to Mirkwood where (for the watcher's next million or so subjective years) they walk in dramatic circles, engage in witty repartee and fall under the black spell of the forest. Bilbo, with the help of his magic ring helps them escape the spiders. This is the slowest chapter in the book and why Jackson expands it further is beyond me. They are captured by wood elves, who are expanded to the point where we learn all their loves, fantasies, triumphs and failures. Bilbo, again with the aid of his magic ring, helps them escape to Laketown, a town which is another footnote expanded beyond reason.

More backstory is liberally sprinkled here and there, more minor characters expanded in a quasi Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead fashion. (All they really lacked was a chorus of Vikings singing about Spam.) During another few of the watcher's subjective years they reach Lonely Mountain, enter the backdoor and wake up the vengeful Smaug.

Out of fairness toward Jackson the habit of ruining children's stories by making them into movies goes back a long way. Even so, ""The Hobbit"", just like ""Alice in Wonderland"",  ""The Call of the Wild"", ""Tom Sawyer"", ""The Phantom Tollbooth"" and a host of others is best read aloud by a parent to a child one page at a time.",1494633600,,2497,4.689497716894977

7269357,5,B00YXRPHM2,"I'm more of a fan of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but wanted to complete my collection by adding all The Hobbit movies in their extended versions. The prices were fantastic and it was enjoyable to watch a bit of the extras whenever I could. The extras are so worth it!

Was as expected, great packaging and fast arrival. The only thing is I am having an issue with the Ultra Violet digital code, it does not seem to be working. It tells me the code is invalid. So for the movie I give it 5 stars, for the invalid code a 4 star.",1479081600,,389,4.131578947368421

7269363,3,B00YXRPHM2,"This is fantasy, I know, but some of the scenes in this series stretch belief too far. The Thunder Giants from episode one for example. That everyone survives the odds when the band are attacked by thousands of orcs and other assorted creatures, only in the movies you say?

The trek plods on finally arriving at the misty mountain after encountering the spiders of Mirkwood and running into the woodland elves including Legolas. Throw in a dwarf/elf romance and a picture of Gimli as a boy with his mother--no beard. The visit with Smaug drags on and on and on. Coating him with liquid goal seems (?)

And suddenly we come to an abrupt end.",1475712000,,641,4.565217391304348

8719326,5,B00YXRPHM2,"Extended versions of movies are not always better movies.  Jackson's extended version of The Lord of the Rings movies turned each movie into a much better movie.  He achieved the same brilliant results with his extended versions of The Hobbit movies, which are as outstanding as the Rings movies.  The connection between The Hobbit and Rings is weak in the books.  Jackson made the connection much stronger in the moves without violating the books.  The changes made all preserve the spirit of the stories Tolkien told.  I confidently predict these movies will become as classic as the books are now.  G.
