3455373,5,B001AOC9G8,"I haven't enjoyed movies this much in years.  Although I have read most of the books, it was fantastic to see them acted out in this collection.
Agatha Christie was a genius and David Suchet personifies her character of Hercule Poirot.",1231459200,,235,4.7317073170731705
3455374,2,B001AOC9G8,"As much as I love Agatha Christie and these Poirot series, I have been surprised at by at least 2 episodes in which homosexual relationships are wound into the plot. I do not remember this being in the books. ""Cards on the Table"" & ""Five Little Pigs"" (I think that's the title) added material and even made it crucial to the plot to use specifically homosexual relationships. Why?",1229299200,31,380,4.602941176470588

3455376,3,B001AOC9G8,"OK, I'm among the Dazed & Confused.
I love Hercule Poirot and David Suchet is brilliant.
I now own 59 titles between Acorn & A&E.

Does anyone know where to see the whole list of what is available on DVD?

And does anyone know when these will be available:

Appointment with Death
Cat Among the Pigeons
Hallowe'en Party
Mrs. McGuinty's Dead
The Third Girl",1228953600,5,355,4.515625
3455377,5,B001AOC9G8,"Well for the benefit of the woman who asked me to explain the difference in the Poirot collections back when the Acorn sets of the ""original series"" came out, now she and others who waited can complete their collection and save space at the same time.  This indeed is all 12 feature length episodes released to date that were shown here on A&E. For those of you bought them like me in either the smaller sets of 4 and/or individuals, their is nothing new here, but at least this set like the 2 Acorn sets (1 of the hour length shows, the other of the 2 hour ones both of which aired ""here"" on PBS and A&E later on) will take up less space on your shelf.  Since nothing new was added, I will be content with what I have, if by now 7 years after they started you have not gotten any of the  A&E ONLY aired stories now is your chance to get them all together. 12 for less than $100 is most definitely a bargain.",1217808000,171,908,4.089887640449438
3455378,5,B001AOC9G8,"""There's nothing like boredom to make you write."" So said Agatha Christie, but I doubt many who attempt to write a novel do so for similar reasons. And asked about where she came up with her ideas, she responded once: ""They come suddenly, I even don't know how. Whenever: when I am listening to opera, walking on the street... they come from everywhere! Also, when a smart idea falls into your head, which you like, you have to build a believable story from it. Suddenly faces grow as well, one by one. And then comes this unpleasant day, when you have to sit down and everything what had beautifully grown put on paper. Yes, the first part is much more fun!""

Miss Christie's characters are most interesting and Hercule Poirot, a literary treasure, certainly has been brought to life by Miss Christie. He is an extraordinary character and A&E has done a superb job at providing wonderful art deco decor and visuals in which David Suchet
plays Miss Christie's famed detective to perfection.  (Albert Finney's Poirot, in the 1974 film ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" is accomplished, as well, but Mr. Suchet has to get the nod just on the basis of volume and consistency.)  These films are simply just well crafted, well filmed, and acted with aplomb.  These films are a feast of art deco sumptuousness and the plots and players live up to the decor.  ""Lord Edgware Dies"" is my personal favourite herein.  Check out that film if you're not familiar with any of these productions, as a prelude to considering this collection.  Cheers",1217289600,20,1531,4.7330827067669174

3455420,5,B001AOC9G8,"Nobody does Poirot like David Suchet and I honestly believe that this is how Agatha Christie intended Poirot to be. Suchet is magnificent as Poirot, so good in fact, that he will forever be identified with Poirot, and vice versa. And of course, no-one makes mysteries like this than the British. The costumes, the sets, the locales - all so beautifully British. I can watch these over & over again, & never grow tired of them.

Some of her better books are portrayed in this collection. Though, not as enjoyable as the earlier series in which Inspector Japp, Hastings and Miss Lemon were present, they're still enjoyable. Think cerebral and that is what these are. There is some humor but not as much as in the earlier series and there is no camaraderie here, except for the few episodes in which Zoe Wanamaker portrays his mystery writer friend. Think dark overtones here.
Overall, a worthwhile and enjoyable set of DVDs, if you're a big fan of Christie or her character, Poirot. I do prefer the earlier movie collection myself.",1412121600,,737,4.676923076923077

There is some profanity (bleeped out) and for a Poirot...quite a bit of sexual innuendo.

David Suchet still is exemplary and the storylines are good despite the choppiness due to the multitude of subplots and ""red herrings."". I still enjoy them and would buy this set again even though I like the older ones much better and WON'T be watching these with my ten year old granddaughter.

Agatha Christie's Poirot in the The Definitive Collection contains 12 mysteries on 12 discs, each about 98 minutes long. David Suchet plays the role of Agatha Christie's favorite Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot. This is the second period in Poirot's career. His supporting sidekick and secretary are absent; however, he is occasionally joined by Ariadne Oliver, a writer of detective and other exceptional stories; and Poirot himself begins to acquire a slightly more intense personality. In at least some of the stories we see him in a new apartment with George, his gentleman's gentleman. Most of these mysteries are sensational; others are gorgeous gems in the rough. Three of the mysteries are also available with Peter Ustinov playing Poirot: Death on the Nile, Evil Under the Sun, and Lord Edgeware Dies. You can have fun with family and friends comparing the two actors playing the same role in the same mystery.

After the Funeral: The Abernethie family was shocked at the family gathering when after the reading of Richard Abernethie's will Cora Abernethie bursts out with ""But he was murdered, wasn't he?"" A little later Cora was murdered with several strokes of an ax, and the family solicitor, Sir Entwhistle, called in Hercule Poirot.

Cards on the Table: Eight guests arrived for dinner and a social evening. Then the most unimaginable thing takes place, a murder is committed. Only one of the four guests playing bridge in an adjoining room could have committed the crime. Poirot and two high ranking officers, one from Scotland Yard and the other from the Foreign Service, set out to solve the case; Ariadne Oliver's provides uninvited help.

Death on the Nile: A beautiful young heiress, Linnet Ridgeway, married Simon Doyle the fianc of her oldest friend Jacqueline de Bellefort. Linnet and Simon Doyle honeymooned in Egypt and were staying at the Cataract Hotel in Assuan when they saw Jackie who was obviously tracking them with the objective of spoiling their honeymoon. Hercule Poirot who was also traveling in Egypt and staying at the Cataract Hotel met an old friend Colonel Race (David Niven). Curiously Linnet's American Trustee Mr. Pennington was also staying at the Hotel. The next day they all boarded the water wheel boat, Karnak, for a sightseeing cruse up the Nile; trouble soon began.

Evil Under the Sun: Poirot was hired by an insurer to investigate a murder on the Yorkshire moors and the substitution of a faux diamond for a stunning genuine gem that the millionaire industrialist Horace Blatt had given to a New York musical show star Arlina Stuart in contemplation of marriage. They were all staying at a swanky island resort in the Adriatic owned by Daphne Castle. There is a murder and of course Hercule Poirot solves the mystery.

Five Little Pigs: A young lady retains Poirot to investigate a murder that happened many years ago for which her mother had been convicted and hung. Poirot reluctantly takes the case, interviews all of the witnesses and calls all of the players together. The outcome was not only a surprise it was shocking.

The Hollow: A British week end party ends in the murder of one of the guests. The likely murderer was being shielded by the family including the murdered party's mistress. After a horse is found hiding the murder weapon, Poirot identifies the murderer and says ""...go to the living; I will stay here with the dead"".

Lord Edgeware Dies: (also published as ""Thirteen for Dinner"") The most obvious suspect was having dinner with twelve high profile witnesses. More murders follow; finally all of the participants were called together to hear Poirot explain how it was done and who the guilty part was.

Murder in Mesopotamia: Poirot visited an ancient archeological site in Iraq just before the chief archeologist's unpopular wife was found dead. Poirot immediately suspected that it was murder and investigated.

The Murder of Roger Ackroyd: was set in the peaceful village of King's Abbot, which was over populated with unmarried ladies. Poirot had recently retired there and was engaged in cultivating vegetable marrows. According to some of Christie's contemporaries the mystery was too difficult to solve and deemed it ""Foul Play""; others cried ""Bravo"" for the exceptional dexterity the author displayed in hiding the true identity of the murderer until the very end.

The Mystery of the Blue Train: A young girl of modest means unexpectedly inherits a fortune. A disguised jewel thief was hired as a secretary by a wealthy business man who had given a priceless gem mounted in a necklace to his daughter; she is married to a hopeless gambler. The daughter was murdered; the young heiress, the jewel thief and Poirot all went to the south of France to stay in and party at a house owned by a distant relative of the heiress.

Sad Cypress: It gets all tangled up when love blooms between the wrong people, and greed to inherit Hunterbury warps fair judgment. Laura Welman dies during the night without a will leaving everything to Elinor Carlisle, as next of kin. Mary Gerard dies of poisoning and Elinor is arrested. Elinor, standing in the dock, pleads not guilty but the case against her is daunting. Dr Peter Lord, who has fallen for Elinor, calls Poirot in to look at the case and begs him to save Elinor.

Taken at the Flood: Lynn Marchmont returning home after service in the Navy during WW II finds it difficult settling into the life of the village she had left. She was engaged to Rowley Cloade; his family lived nearby. Her and her family members had grown accustomed to drawing on their future inheritance from Gordon Cloade, but Gordon had recently married Rosaleen invalidating his will. Gordon passed away making Rosaleen exceedingly wealthy. David Hunter, Rosaleen's brother, jealously guarded his sister's wealth, making everything very difficult.

This set, ""Poirot: The Definitive Collection"", is a real treasure. It is a must have for every devote of Agatha Christie, and for every collector of British mysteries. Where else can you find 12 wonderful movies made from the stories of one of the greatest writers of all time, Dame Agatha Christie?",1391385600,2,6158,4.977626459143969

The characters of Captain Hastings and Miss Lemon are missing from most of these movies (as, I understand it, Christie did not include them in the original novels); nonetheless, each dramatization is thoroughly enjoyable.  While not remastered for high definition, I find the picture quality and sound quality quite acceptable.

It is driving me crazy, and I usually remember these things, I thought it was one of the best stories POIROT he ever did, and since I just ordered the DEFINITIVE COLLECTION, The newer one, I hope it is on this set..
I love all Agatha Christie mysteries though, so will probably love this set as well...

Please help, someone must know the answer to this mysterious question..I know I saw it on tv a very long time ago...I saw this set before and loved it, that's why I am finally ordering it, and for the bonus too, that makes it even more special..

p.s.*** I just got this set and realized it doesn't have***- ANY CLOSED CAPTIONING, BUYER BEWARE! I am a senior and watch nearly everything on bluray or dvd in cc, I am writing A&E to get their answer, since I have a low vision problem..most dvds and bluray have the cc option, even foreign movies..

The visual is very good, but the captioning would help me and I believe others, a lot more...especially seniors, like me..It had better have the BONUS FEATURES..doesn't say which dvd they are on, on the box doesn't say either (just bonus features and what they are) but I am only on first dvd of the set..thanks UPS for delivering it early!

 I believe this is the only set with the bonus features, that is why I ordered this one, if you don't want cc, it is a great dvd set to get.. but most blurays or dvds give you a choice anyways.

POIROT IS EXCELLENT  AS USUAL! no, MY REMOTE DOESN'T HAVE A CC BUTTON EITHER,cc was programmed for my tv only, but nothing else.. I HAVE time warner cable HD box AND A Vizio WIDE SCREEN TV..and a Time Warner cable remote too, when playing my dvds, etc, the vizio tv remote only works certain functions so I can see the dvd,etc..the T.W. remote controls the cc and none for this video anyways..I hope this helps all the seniors out there who love POIROT and buy through A&E by using AMAZON...but if you need cc don't buy this set and check if A&E HAS CC ON ANYTHING YOU BUY THROUGH THEM..YOU CAN CONTACT THEM BY 800 NUMBER, GOOGLE IT,A&E  OR YOU CAN EMAIL THEM TOO..I called but it was after hrs., so the nice girl said she would email for me..the cc question..Oh yes, Forgot to say I recommend this to any POIROT MYSTERY LOVER, GREAT COLLECTION!!

I didn't realize that until I'd opened the package and started watching, but David Suchet is such a perfect Hercule Poirot (imho) that I didn't mind. In the first two films ""The Murder of Roger Aykroyd"" and ""Lord Edgware Dies"", Poirot is played as eccentric and cute. They butch him up quite a bit for the next film, ""Murder in Mesopotamia"", and keep him that way, while still emphasizing his strange walk and OCD germophobia. The rest of the films are: Evil Under the Sun, Death on the Nile, Sad Cypress, The Hollow, Five Little Pigs, The Mystery of the Blue Train, After the Funeral, and Cards on the Table.

Of the three films I have currently watched, all have had this little annoying/distracting flashing black bar across the top of the picture. It's like someone had this little strobe light going on behind the entire film. If it were just one, I could see that as maybe a singular incident. But we're striking out three for three here, A&E. Not good.

As one that wants to maintain a complete collection, I have no choice, I suppose, but to endure the inferior quality and lack of care put in to this treasure. But knowing I spent as much as I did on such pitiful work is really starting to rub me.

At present, I am considering returning this set and trying a replacement. I'd like to think I just got the moldy berry from the bushel.

It is only the earlier episodes that are of poor video transfer. HOWEVER, I have recently come across ridiculous dialogue censoring. Several instances accur in Mystery of the Blue Train. So stupid.

 1. David S is fun to watch because he really is fat, just like Christie had in mind when she penned Potroast.
 2. Although he portrays a Belgian, and his dialogue requires him to speak interchangeably from Belgian/French- back to English, it is sometimes obvious that he is not fluent in what should be his native tongue.

3455544,4,B001AOC9G8,"I remember when this Poirot series first aired.  I watched a couple of episodes and lost interest.  I think this was because I am not a fan of art deco and pretentious television.  Over the years I've managed to catch all 12 of these shows on A&E as endless repeats.  The series still did not catch my fancy.  David Suchet is very good as the fastidious Poirot, a character straight-jacketed by an almost psychopathic regard for himself in the third person and, here, imbedded  within homogenous productions of impeccably sterile atmospheres.  This Poirot, as adapted for this television series, has few facets, unlike the prismatic Jane Marple as portrayed by Joan Hickson.

The producers of this A&E powered Poirot have gone for style over everything else.  After seeing these shows again after all these years I am still not impressed.  The scripts are as stiff and fussy as the eponymous hero, lacking humor and irony. What smug humor there is barely raises a chuckle.  Suchet carries the show single-handedly.  His cast of regular sidekicks is not very interesting, unlike Miss Marple's chums in the great Hickson series.
Poirot's devoted secretary,Miss Lemon, wears out interest after her first complete episode.  Everything she does after  that is predictable and routine.

I found myself getting a little bored with the same old red herrings and stabbings in the neck of rich bastards who are murdered by envious and vain people of little intrinsic interest themselves.  Marple's killers are always fascinating and unexpected.

If you like schtick murder mysteries that never enter the realm of the believable then this Poirot adaptation will appeal to you.  If you are addicted to Joan Hickson's Miss Marple then you might find yourself yawning your way through this art deco purgatory.

I still give this Poirot 4 stars for Suchet's definitive performance, and the set and costume designs.  The famous tune that runs fairly incessantly throughout is the only thing you will remember about the musical background, and the squeaky clean streets of London (what a laugh!) almost make me want to take a star away.  This show isn't bad, it just isn't as good as people have come to believe it is.  It would be comforting viewing on one of those semi-brain-dead weekends when you are in the depths of a terrible head cold.

A&E's dvd presentation is good but nothing special as is usual with their products.  Certainly A& E, along with Acorn releases, isn't in the same league as the excellent dvd releases from AMC (Mad Men) and HBO (Rome).",1302566400,5,2545,4.934117647058824

I guess that is because I have the other movies of that title with Peter Ustinov, Bette Davis, David Niven, etc.  I got this entire set, brand new on amazon for like 35 bucks! Some of the shows are slow moving and boring: ""Murder in Mesopotamia"" I fell asleep watching, could have left this one out completely! But on the other hand, standing ovation,  Elliot Cowan, ELLIOT COWAN as Mr. David Hunter is ABSOLUTELY superb in ""Taken at the Flood!"" Buy the entire set just for this one episode! Why this actor is not a super star is beyond me? Equally engaging and worthwhile are: ""After the Funeral"", ""Cards on the Table"", and ""The Mystery of The Blue Train"". Of course, these are my favorites. Others may disagree. But buy this set regardless. I prefer it to the classic collection. Entirely different in the way it is presented, filmed, etc. Find it much more interesting, the scenes are fast moving, jumping from one to another!  And,  as usual,  the sets, the backgrounds, the scenic beauty, Poirot's obsessive tidiness and attention to every little detail, all these things are there;making for great entertainment! The only reason I buy the Poirot and Miss Marple series, is that I want to watch them over and over and over! No other series, movies or shows, do this, for me! I hope this review was helpful in making others to make up their minds if this set is for them or not? Thank you for reading it!",1299974400,6,1769,4.478260869565218
3455548,5,B001AOC9G8,"Unlike the inanities that are inflicted by A&E television today, in the past the station used their budget for more reputable fare, including mysteries like Nero Wolfe and Miss Marple. In each case, the acting, script and sets were just spot on marvelous. The same applies to A&E's Hercule Poirot; David Sachet is perfect in lead role of the Belgian detective, the acting ensemble works as a fluent whole. As mentioned before, the scripts and production values of the shows are superlative; as fine an adaptation of the Dame of Mystery's books to television as one could get.",1299801600,5,575,4.877551020408164
3455549,3,B001AOC9G8,"This  is somewhat of a transitional collection incorporating a few titles left out of the original Acorn series with the balance being those produced and distributed by A&E.  How well you like them probably will depend on when you first encountered David Suchet's run as Hercule Poroit.

The original series was first seen in the US as a group of 36 one hour episodes on ""PBS Mystery"" and ran from 1989 to 1993.  PBS supplemented those with an additional series of 9 feature length films produced by Carnival Films, Ltd.  Those initial programs are available on Acorn Media's ""Poirot: the Classic Collection"" &  ""Poirot: Classic Collection 2"".  With a few exceptions the various episodes are tightly scripted by the likes of Clive Exton and Anthony Horowitz, and are centered around the character ensemble of Hercule Poirot, Arhtur Hastings, Miss Lemon and Inspector Japp.  In ""Classic 2"" that tight little group began to break up just a bit as the lengthier films brought in more characters yielding less screen time for the supporting cast.  At the same time, the series seemed to develop a road trip syndrome as a great many of the later ""Classic 2"" episodes involved trips to distant locales while the earlier ones were centered in and around between war London.  Petty criticism aside both ""Classic Collections"" are 5 star rated in my opinion.  The only caveat being that the episodes were produced and broadcast in non-chronological order.  Since they range from WW1 to just prior to WW2 much of the ""time period correctness"" that the producers strove to achieve can be a bit jarring when viewing episodes back to back.  Fashions, automobiles, trains and airplanes all morph from one era to another in keeping with the period that Christie wrote the original stories.  You can, of course, shuffle the episodes to reflect the actual chronology but then you have the cast aging, getting younger, and then older again right before your eyes, also a bit disconcerting.

This ""Definitive Collection"" contains an even dozen 100 minute episodes of which  the first 4  are stylistically identical to those in Acorn's Classic 2 collection.  I would surmise that ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"", ""Lord Edgware Dies"", ""Murder in Mesoptamia"" and ""Evil Under the Sun"" were originally scheduled for PBS and were, in fact, produced  by Carnival Films Production, the originator of the ""Poirot"" project.  The balance of the episodes were produced by newly created Agatha Christie Ltd. specifically for the A&E audience.  I'm not sure  why the PBS contract lapsed, nor why Carnival was replaced, but  broadcast and production rights were transferred to A&E with significant differences which you may or may not appreciate.  Essentially, while David Suchet was always the star of the series, the A&E productions put him front and center without his companion Capt. Hastings, his long suffering secretary, Ms. Lemon and his foil/friend, Inspector Japp.  Instead A&E cast guest stars from British and American TV leaving Suchet alone to carry the narrative load.  For the most part they're solid performances and not tasteless ego trips by over the hill has beens, though the David Soul and Elliot Gould inclusions might be questionable. However the central charm of the earlier films and the leveling effect Hastings, Lemon and Japp had on the egocentric Poirot are clearly missed, sort of like Sherlock without Dr. Watson. Additionally, the overall sense of the later A&E productions have the grandiose feel of Edwardian melodramas with all sorts of self important cads and spoiled young ladies parading around aging manors.  These are not the Christie penned village mysteries.  There is a total absence of humor in these films which was very prominent in the earlier episodes. Poirot becomes more of an oddity in investigating the crimes rather than merely an eccentric.  He's often friendless and seems sadly out of place in the surroundings he finds himself in.  I feel his character is diminished rather than enhanced by the absence of his friends.  ""Evil Under the Sun"", the third film in this collection, is a a good example of the earlier ensemble format and I would suggest purchasers compare it to any of the later A&E produced episodes and draw their own conclusions as to which approach works best.

Having said all that, the production values are quite good and if you had not seen the original series you might well be inclined to enjoy these later productions.  My preference is clearly for the earlier films, but I did come up with 3 (or 4 if you consider the Roger Ackroyd episode which briefly includes Insp. Japp) additional ""ensemble"" discs which are well worth the price of the entire set.  If you like the recent A&E episodes then this set is a no brainer, but to those who viewed the Suchet series commencing with the original Carnival films I fear you'll find the viewing more of a chore than a pleasure.  I gave it 3 stars  due to the absence of the supporting cast, and hopefully as a warning to others that the Poirot they once knew is no more.

*****

As a postscript I would caution potential purchasers to review the subsequent releases with great care.  A&E ultimately bailed on the Poirot project and the most recent films are being independently produced and are again being broadcast on ITV in the UK, PBS in North America and issued on disc by Acorn Media.  Unfortunately they're following the same A&E format and are filmed almost exclusively in near darkness. Not quite film noir, the constant low light scenes are, I suppose, designed to invoke sinister events about to take place, however it's all a bit over done. While Suchet continues his excellent portrayal of the now older Poirot nearing his mortal end, there's a depressive quality of self importance with each new episode thankfully absent in the original series.  I don't mean this as a sleight, but the recent films seem to be following the same course as the 1980's ""Murder She Wrote"" where Jessica Fletcher was initially a small town writer who solved local mysteries in bucolic Cabot Cove.  By the final seasons she had morphed into a jet setting socialite involved in all manner of dark intrigue affecting the Robin Leach crowd.  An additional concern  is that some of the re-mastered earlier Poirot films have been added to these later sets, so avoiding duplication is becoming increasingly difficult.  Finally, to further complicate matters for prospective purchasers is the emergence of yet another ""Definitive Collection"", thus far only available in region 2 coding, which purports to include all the episodes thus far produced, but lacking specific information about re-mastering.  The one high note is that a few of these later independently produced episodes feature the return of Hugh Fraser as Poirot's confidant, Captain Hastings.  The scenes with Fraser and Suchet immediately recapture some of the series's glory days and are well worth adding to your collection.  While Christie's novels often had Poirot doing a solo act, the literary form provided the author's voice to describe events and details the screenplays failed to properly convey.  The inclusion of Hastings into these stories would have been a welcome addition even if not perfectly following the literary form.

The original goal of filming every short story and novel with a single actor in the title role was highly ambitious given the sheer volume of work Agatha Christie produced.  The UK film industry is always affected by economic conditions and they suffered through at least two severe recessions during the course of Suchet's run.  The fact that they completed the project is an accomplishment in and of itself.  While, I'm critical of the choices they made in the later films, I'm sure there is a substantial audience who finds the entire series very rewarding.  For David Suchet it's a singular achievement not duplicated by any other actor.",1298764800,73,7919,5.0

3455573,4,B001AOC9G8,"This was the first Poirot set that I purchased, and although I think all of these DVDs are overpriced, I think the quality of the episodes is excellent.  The quality of the transfer of these episodes is better than those of the ""Classic Collections"".  Thus, I recommend first Poirot DVD buyers get the Definitive Collection first, although it should be noted that the episodes selected for this set are not as highly rated as many of the other episodes (see below).

 I have listed all of the Poirot episodes below. The first number is the season in the format Season #.Episode #, the next number is the IMDB rating (10 is highest) and the third number gives the collection (C1=Classic Collection (36 episodes), C2=Classic Collection vol. 2, D=Definitive Collection (The collection reviewed here)).

These three sets cover a significant fraction of the available episodes as shown below. What is nice is there is no overlap, provided you limit yourself to these three collections.  However, there are a number of sets called ""Classic Collections"" which makes things difficult.  The two referenced here do not have set numbers, but rather volume numbers.  The best deal is volume 1, which has 36 episodes.  However, the Classic Collection vol. 2 has the episodes with the highest ratings.

All of these DVDs are overpriced based on the quality of the DVD conversions.  I love Poirot, so I have purchased two of these (definitive and C1), and am patiently waiting for C2 to drop in price.

3455582,5,B001AOC9G8,Bought these for the wife for Christmas and thought we had seen all of Suchet's Poirot episodes but there were a couple neither of us had seen before.  We love this series and this set is a MUST have for the Poirot fan.,1265414400,,219,4.093023255813954
3455583,5,B001AOC9G8,This series with David Suchet is very well done.  He plays the role to a T as do the other characters and the settings and costuming take one back to the era they portray with accuracy.,1261008000,3,185,4.138888888888889
3455584,5,B001AOC9G8,My husband and I are in love with these Poirot collections. We love all of them. David Suchet is the perfect match and he is truly Poirot! Agatha Christie would be proud. To bad she never got the chance to see him play the part. Her murder mystries are great writings. The set was in great condition when we received it. We have enjoyed it so much and have shared it with others. Thanks Sheri~,1254528000,2,393,4.253333333333333
3455585,5,B001AOC9G8,"The quality of this collection of Poirot mysteries is better than anything I have ever seen in the realm of television production transfer to DVD. To say that the video quality is magnificent is an understatement. When I began watching these DVD's I was immediately struck by the depth and richness of the color and the brilliant clarity of the images, right down to the finest detail.  A&E deserves the highest praise for treating this collection like the masterpieces of cinematography they are.  For people who are familiar with David Suchet's brilliant portrayal of Hercule Poirot and the fine acting of Hugh Frasier as Poirot's good natured friend and associate Captain Hastings and Pauline Moran as his dedicated secretary and friend Miss Lemon, it goes without saying that the quality of the acting is a mark of excellence throughout the world. Philip Jackson as Chief Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard rounds out the experience as these four great actors are like welcomed family members to the viewers who know the wonder of this fantastic series.  This collection is something you will treasure forever. The only thing that I did not like is the way the DVD's were packaged in the box.  The box they come in is designed to hold all twelve DVD's but in order to make the box reasonable in size the DVD's are overlapped, two on each leaf of the box, one DVD on a full spindle and the one overlapping it on a half spindle.  It makes it awkward to remove the DVD's carefully from the leafs. I purchased 12 separate jewel cases for these DVD's and I am storing them in the jewel cases rather than the box.  It is a small price to pay for maintaining these equisitely high quality productions.  I find that each of the twelve productions runs approximately 95 minutes including credits and opening. Whether you are a mystery fan or not, these video productions are wonderful to behold.  Absolutely worth the investment. There is one thing, however, that I must caution you about. These productions are NOT for young viewers. Some of the scenes in these films are brutal enough to earn an ""R"" rating if they were shown in theaters today. For example, in the very first DVD, The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd, there is a scene in which his murder is depicted and it is a horrific scene.  A knife is clearly rammed into the victim's throat, firmly held there as blood pours out, and every agonizing twitch of his screaming death throes are displayed. It is enough to give even the most jaded person nightmares. So please exercise caution regarding allowing younger viewers to watch these films.  I recommend no one younger than a teenager.

3455586,4,B001AOC9G8,"Great collection as always. However in the US version (Region 1) the format it 4:3 Full Screen, which means the picture has been cropped from the original European version (Region 2) which was shot in 16:9 Wide-screen. If you are into cinematography this is a big deal and sometimes the cropping is pretty awful. It still great TV though!",1250208000,52,338,4.745762711864407
3455587,5,B001AOC9G8,"Some of these episodes have no Capt. Hastings.  I miss him.  However, Insp. Japp is there and Miss Lemon is also present.  These is just a minor observation, as these Poirot episodes are so well done, I want every episode.  David Suchet's portrayal of Poirot is superb and he is the quintisential Poirot.  As in all the episodes, the acting is superior, the attention to detail of the period is second to none, and the photography fantastic.  I can watch these over and over and never get tired of them.
I do wish that the company producing these DVDs would add some ""real"" special features, rather than the short text-only biographies of David Suchet and Agatha Christie.  To me, the text is not a special feature.  For fans of mysteries, these are a must have.",1249603200,,762,4.592592592592593
3455588,5,B001AOC9G8,"I love this set.  i wish to buy others.  They are so richly filmed - the colors, villages, mansions, English countryside, London, etc.  the visuals are so enticing.  The characters are always very pleasing and proper as i would expect from the Britts.  David Suchet is just one of my favorites.  i'm into my 2nd & in some cases, 3rd go round watching these movies and, it's true, they get better & better each time.  It's exciting realizing more details everytime i watch them, understanding character nuances more astutely.  If you're a Poirot fan & like to see movies more than once, i recommend buying a set!",1246752000,3,611,4.644859813084112
