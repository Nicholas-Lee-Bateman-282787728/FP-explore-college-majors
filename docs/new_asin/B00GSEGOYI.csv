6107670,3,B00GSEGOYI,"This collection only contained ten of the ""long"" episodes of ""The Flintstone Kids"" (none of the Dino shorts and, unfortunately, no ""Captain Caveman and Son"" are in this volume)  I believe that when these originally aired, it was one ""long"" [24 minute] episode, one or two short episodes, a Dino short, and one ""Captain Caveman and Son.""

Anyway, the episodes are as follows:

DISC 1

Barney's Moving Experience
Curse of the Gemstone Diamond
Dusty Diapers
Freddy's First Crush
Heroes For Hire

DISC 2

Poor Little Rich Girl
The Bad News Brontos
The Fugitives
The Little Visitor/Grandpa For Loan
The Rock Concert That Rocked Freddy.",1395187200,27,630,5.009615384615385
6107671,4,B00GSEGOYI,"How did I grow up on The Flintstones and never know about The Flintstone Kids? I must have been living under a rock or something. HA ha  get it? Living under a ROCK? Anyway, I digress. The Flintstone Kids: Rockin in Bedrock was my first experience to these little munchkins even though it aired during the eighties when I was a kid.

It was funny, and a little bit disturbing, to see these mini versions of the same characters I grew up on.  The cover is so cute and bright and current looking that I expected the DVD to be the same, but it wasnt. It definitely had the sound and look of the eighties. Its not a bad thing. Its actually very nostalgic for me. Its just a little misleading if you think you are getting whats on the cover. Dont judge this one by the cover!

This fun filled set contains two DVDs with five episodes on each. Im not sure why it took two DVDs for just ten episodes total but you get them all for one price so I guess it doesnt really matter!

It was fun to see these little characters and what The Flintstones and friends looked like before the adult versions I was used to. Their personalities were the same and they even looked exactly the same, only little!

The Flintstone Kids: Rockin in Bedrock was a walk down memory lane for me even though Id actually never seen this version of the show before. Its a must have for all Flintstone fans!",1394496000,8,1372,4.257692307692308

6107681,5,B00GSEGOYI,This is one of my favorite cartoons. I always wanted The Flintstone Kids on DVD. I'll be 100% satisfy if every single episode is released on DVD. I mean all of it. Including the shorts. The quality is great. There's only a few of my favorite episodes. I ordered my very own copy this past Monday and it came today. I'm suprised that it came that fast. Highly recommend it.,1397001600,6,372,4.328571428571428
6107682,5,B00GSEGOYI,"I am a child of the 80s and i watched the Flintstone Kids. I was also raised to be a huge Flinstone fan. I bought this at the store so I could share it with my kids (age 2 and 4) and they LOVE these episodes!! i do wish there were more episodes on here- but  I am thankful for the 10 episodes that are included. My daughter was so excited about watching this show, she made me pull out my old Flintstone Kids toys. I love being able to share this classic 80s cartoon with my own kids now! I recommend this DVD to anyone who loved this show as a child.",1395360000,11,551,3.8761061946902653
