8028173,5,6301996119,"BLOODSUCKING PHAROAHS is a great film about a mysterious Egyptian slasher terrorizing Pittsburgh. There's good gore effects, but this is a comedy, and the humor shines. The jokes are great, offensive, and at worst flow sort of like Leslie Neilson in his glory days. The characters are great and you'll fall in love with all of them as a whole. The pacing sort of stops and goes, but it never gets ridiculously bogged down to the point that you start wondering if you could get away with fastforwarding.

It's a great film overall, and if you love horror-comedies this is a perfect addition to your collection.",1193616000,6,609,4.745283018867925
8028174,5,6301996119,"If you like original humor, dark humor, humor that knows no bounds... then you have to see this movie.
It does start a little slow... but stick with it... once it picks up it keeps rolling.
For having very little money or talent to work with (no big name stars) the group here managed to churn out a classic of unspeakable proportions.
I don't want to give away too much... but there is humor here that can be quite offensive in today's climate. This was made before things became 'politically correct'... so, if you offend easy then this one isn't for you.
But... if you want a number of really good belly laughs then I recommend you buy this one.... you'll want to watch it a number of times.",1182470400,4,694,4.387596899224806
8028175,2,6301996119,"Bloody indeed!  Gore galore!  But there is enough humor and shtick to overcome all that muck.  We laughed from beginning to end.  The nicotine addicted wife should be the star of the show.

And it was filmed in Pittsburgh - Lawrenceville, the strip, the north side.  There is no Egyptian quarter in Pittsburgh.",1178928000,,310,4.754716981132075
8028176,5,6301996119,"If you're into cult classics, enjoy a bit of dark humor mixed with a splattering of blood, gore, and comedy, this one's for you.  This flick has been rated ""my favorite video"" by a renowned Egyptology scholar from Long Island University in New York.  Bob knows his Pharaohs, take his word for it.",1167782400,3,296,4.566037735849057
