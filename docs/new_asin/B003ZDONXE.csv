4233532,1,B003ZDONXE,Its not a good yoga DVD. I can think of a hundred other yoga teachers Id choose before Id even think of choosing this one,1343865600,,121,3.88
4233533,5,B003ZDONXE,This is a great video for learning the Primary Series. She has a nice voice and makes it look easy ... but it's not easy. I consider this video a valuable asset in my library of great yoga teachers.,1308355200,,198,4.102564102564102
4233534,3,B003ZDONXE,"Klebl is a talented yoga practitioner but I was hoping for more (any)  modifications on her video as it is advertised for all levels.  Ashtanga yoga is a set series of poses so if a person is already able to practice at an advanced skill level then they probably don't need a video.  I am pretty new at it and have practiced enough to have learned the asanas.  I still lack flexibility to do all of them without modifications so lacking an instructor, a video is the next best thing.  David Swenson is very good at offering modifications to use as you gain flexibility but I thought another instructor might offer different options. I don't recommend this video to beginners without flexibility.  That being said, she is very impressive to watch.",1292112000,3,746,4.656488549618321
4233535,5,B003ZDONXE,"this is a wonderful DVD, good timing, beautiful music and clear instructions. Great for practicing at home or with a small group.  If you know ashtanga you'll love it.",1291939200,,167,4.758620689655173
8410155,5,B003ZDONXE,"Not verified purchase -- didn't actually purchase it -- but I did live it.

If I got certified by someone who coddled me through challenging asanas I'd probably be championing their DVD as well, but from the reviews here, this is how Caroline approaches her certification course, and I'm seven years later still thankful for this approach.  If you find yourself falling on your head, sucking down oxygen in a pool of your own tears, you're doing it right.  With daily, unyielding practice, you'll stop crying in about three days and in a week you'll know you'll get this.  Modifications aren't asanas; if it's important to sneak up on an asana while feeling a sense of achievement along the way, you can make up your own modifications, but attacking and failing at even resembling a challenging asana moves you forward far more and far faster than you believe.  And, constant failure helps cement the concept that you'll never achieve perfection, though you aim for it every day.  You don't achieve success, you just get much, much better, every day.  Such is life.

I've bastardized what I learned to something more resembling self-waterboarding, but the one thing I can't shake from Caroline's certification course is, whatever neck-breaking asinine asana I decide to throw into my practice, I'll eventually fall into something pretty close to the real thing if I keep hitting my head against that wall.

Embrace failure, it's good for you.  If you want an instructional DVD of asanas you can already do, consider purchasing my ""How to Lay in Bed Chainsmoking in Front of 'CSI' Reruns.""",1489536000,,1588,4.913857677902621
8410156,5,B003ZDONXE,"The sequence in this video is a gateway into hundreds of Yoga postures.

8410158,1,B003ZDONXE,Absolutely NOT to buy. It gives only short cues of positions available everywhere. Very disappointing.,1463961600,,102,5.866666666666666
8410159,3,B003ZDONXE,"NOT FOR BEGINNERS
I am new to Ashtanga ( but I am a vinyasa yoga instructor) so I would not call myself a beginner to yoga by any means. I was hoping to start doing the primary series as something new to try. She is an amazing practitioner but I was hoping to have some modifications offered. The second time I did the video I made sure to have a strap and some blocks to help with the jump backs which made it much better.

 Being an instructor myself I was able to somewhat modify when needed but it is very fast paced and during that series in the middle with the numerous jump backs/marichyasana/janu sirsasana/armbalances I had a hard time keeping up and using my props, but I made it work and I plan on continuing to do the video to better my practice and eventually go to an actual Ashtanga class.

Not recommended unless you know enough to modify the poses when needed,or have most of the poses accessible in your practice.  I do not recommend this for the average yoga student or new beginners. I could see how this could be dangerous for those who don't know how to modify or get into the positions safely- there is NO instruction on how to get in to the postures.

Overall great video for the advanced practitioner.",1419811200,,1226,4.359649122807017
8410160,5,B003ZDONXE,Loved the wording and descriptions! The pictures and examples offer a clear understanding of the postures. Gave me great detail of the practice! *Highly recommended read*,1363996800,,170,5.576923076923077
8410161,5,B003ZDONXE,"""Yoga"" by Caroline Klebl is a fantastic Ashtanga Yoga DVD. Caroline is such a devoted yogi and her DVD inspired me and my yoga practice in many ways. I purchased this DVD because the yoga studio where I usually practice stopped offering true Ashtanga Yoga classes and I wanted to keep practicing.
Caroline Klebl has studied Yoga with Guruji in India and it instantly became very clear to me how evolved her practice is. Apart from this DVD being very inspiring, I was able to stick to a daily practice with out having to go to a Yoga studio.
""Yoga"" made Ashtanga Yoga a significant part of my daily routine and I can recommend this DVD to everyone who is interested in true and pure Ashtanga Yoga and wants to learn from a professional. For my yoga practice, the DVD in combination with her book ""Ashtanga Yoga: Primary and Intermediate Series"" are very valuable.",1363392000,,863,4.6103896103896105
8410162,5,B003ZDONXE,"I purchased this DVD over a year ago, to prepare me for my teacher training with Caroline last summer.  The first time I tried it, it was incredibly difficult! That is what makes Ashtanga so amazing! You build up your strength and flexibility and eventually are able to complete all the asanas.  It definitely helped prepare me for my training last summer.  I am now able to do all the asanas in the DVD and it is a great resource to go back to.  Caroline is amazing to watch. She definitely knows her yoga!!!  I am now an Ashtanga Instructor myself and I recommend this DVD to my students so they are able to practice at home when they cannot make it to class.  I would highly recommend it.",1363132800,2,691,4.317829457364341
8410163,5,B003ZDONXE,I found Caroline's nice approach to simple and complex yoga moves refreshing and beneficial. I have incorporated a host of her suggestions into my workout regiment and see fast results.,1363132800,,185,5.2
8410164,1,B003ZDONXE,This video is poor quality. No instruction given. Instructor is shaky in balancing postures. Sequence is correct but timing is bad. Production and sound quality is cheap and cheesy. Many better Ashtanga videos out there.,1346976000,,220,5.314285714285714
