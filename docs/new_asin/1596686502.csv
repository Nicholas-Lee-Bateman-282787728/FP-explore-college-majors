200746,5,1596686502,"Watching this DVD was like having a flood gate open in my mind.  Now I'm anxious to try all kinds of new things, such as tie-ups.  Previously, I was afraid to do anything beyond using the hand controls for raising the shafts.  After seeing this DVD and Tom Knisely's other DVD, I'm freely tying up and using the treadles.",1376697600,7,321,4.406779661016949
200747,5,1596686502,"This DVD by Tom Knisely contains useful basic information for all weavers, such as, the parts of the loom, variations in the way different types of looms work, how to understand drafts and tie ups, what tools weavers should have in their toolbox, how to troubleshoot common problems, and how to care for looms.  Tom shows the parts moving so that you can see clearly how they work. He covers jack looms, countermarch looms, counter balance looms, and table looms, giving brand names of the modern ones and a little history of the older ones.  When you are done watching it, you feel confident that you understand your own looms better.  He speaks in such a friendly, relaxed manner that you feel you might be able to call him up to consult on a particularly difficult problem you are having and he would be interested in hearing about it.

There are dozens of useful facts and ideas that will help novices or intermediate weavers accomplish more work faster, save money, and maintain their looms and tools.  Some of the information I already knew, but I was especially grateful to learn the material that applies to my own.  I discovered that I can lower the seat of my bench, set it inside my countermarch loom, and sit on it while threading.  No more crouching in a twisted position, sitting on a little stool, trying to reach through an 8 harnesses forest of white Texsolv heddles at an odd angle for me!  That alone is worth the price of the video.  I will also try out Tom's advice about maintaining a wide shed as I weave by moving the overhanging beater to a notch with a pivot point further back.  He says this is how the production weavers of the past used to do it. Another idea I am going to try out is using doups to save warp and money.  Doups are string extensions that are tied around groups of warp threads. He shows when and where to wax, oil, and polish, where not to, and how to periodically tighten the nuts on the beater bar so that the beater is exactly parallel to the cloth edge and breast beam and you get a straight piece of cloth.

Tom gives a good summary overview on how to read drafts.  He contrasts two different classic systems of notation and explains how combination systems have evolved from them.  He uses the principles demonstrated in the earlier part of the DVD. When you press a treadle, what happens to the parts of your loom, where does the weft go in relation to the warp, and how does the result turn out? This is a part of the video I will return to many times, when I am starting specific projects, until I can ""get it"" in my head, like learning a piece of music.

In all, I feel it was worth the money and would recommend this DVD to others.",1345161600,14,2688,4.391129032258065
7799713,5,1596686502,"I have to admit that I'm biased. I've known Tom since I was a beginning spinner and weaver, and I've spent many hours (and dollars) at The Mannings, where he worked and taught for many years. I mostly bought this DVD for sentimental reasons. BUT it is excellent, and almost as good as taking a class with him. Even veteran weavers like myself (thanks to Tom) will likely learn a few useful things. Every weaver should have this in their library.",1517875200,,445,4.506172839506172
7799714,5,1596686502,I am a big fan of Tom Knisley. I found the DVD very informative. Tom has a way of providing good instruction in a manner that is easy to follow. Good explanation of the parts of the loom to how to clean and take care  of a loom. Included descriptions of differences between looms. Will be a great resource.,1504137600,,306,4.186440677966102
7799715,1,1596686502,"I would love to watch this DVD. Unfortunately neither the first copy Amazon sent OR the replacement copy will play on my Windows 10 machine OR Samsung DVD player. Disc won't load, Windows Explorer doesn't even see the drive. Other DVDs by Interweave Press play just fine. I contacted Interweave and all they said was, their copy works and I need to take it up with Amazon. So, do I just keep ordering replacements until one finally works?? NOT HAPPY.",1484265600,,450,4.6375

7799718,5,1596686502,"I own this DVD and it's great - I HIGHLY recommend it and deserves 6 stars.  But this review is actually for Tom's ""Comprehensive Guide to Warping your Loom from Front to Back"", which I can't find on Amazon but which I'd like to encourage every beginner to get their hands on.  Warping can be pretty intimidating and difficult.  Even though I've taken a beginning weaving class, Tom's Guide to Warping your Loom is a godsend; I put the DVD on my computer, watch how to thread the heddles, pause the DVD and thread the heddles, and then move on to the next part.  Tom is clear and patient, and pretty much knows exactly how you're going to screw up so that he can warn you NOT to do it!",1454112000,4,685,4.246153846153846

7799722,5,1596686502,"I thought this was a book.  It is a video I could not turn off once I started watching it.  You should make this the second purchase after a good pattern book if you have a loom.  If Tom Knisely were within a day trip, I would go to the shop just to pick his mind.  Don't bypass the editor and director's talk at the end of the lessons.",1387411200,7,336,3.8260869565217392
