8482788,5,B005PZAX8E,"Of the two reviews submitted thus far, nobody has quite captured this video yet.  This is NOT a video aimed at those interested in picking up information about popular places to find lots of tourists.  Nor is it a video aimed at ""grand vistas"" and ""breathtaking scenes to take your breath away"".  This is an intimate portrait which celebrates the beauty of Arkansas by focusing the camera on the little things that many people overlook.  Close-ups of spider webs, and flowers, and grass next to streams, and fog, and B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L close-ups of fall leaves.  Stuff that makes you just exhale peacefully.  But then the film goes one step further, shooting a particular scene in the summer, then fading the EXACT scene into fall, then fading the EXACT scene into winter; some really nice stuff with creeks becoming flooded.  Just marvelous work; I have seen this technique done before, but not at this level.  Just wonderful. This is a beautiful video, made by someone who appreciates nature for the subtleties that it has to offer. Not to be missed by anyone looking to relax the mind, set the worries aside, and simply drift for a few brief moments.",1343606400,6,1152,4.812182741116751
8482789,5,B005PZAX8E,"This is an incredibly beautiful and mesmerizing film about Arkansas's wild beauty.  Every scene has great composition sharing foreground and background.  Close-ups and panoramas are displayed in the sharpest images that a blu-ray can offer.  Although the music is also great, I preferred to watch it just with the sounds of nature.  Many of the scenes morph through various seasons so that one can appreciate Arkansas in spring, summer, fall or winter.  Unlike some other Picture Perfect videos which spend minutes at a single scene, this one moves along at a very comfortable pace.  I would love to see the wild beauty of other states portrayed this way.",1324857600,4,655,5.018518518518518
8482790,2,B005PZAX8E,"I purchased this video to show my wife the spectacular views of Arkansas.  This does have some very pretty scenes but they spend too much time on close-ups.  I was hoping for some type of narration or comments on where the scenes were located in Arkansas.  It just starts off with a header of the Ozarks.  Well the Ozarks makes up almost the upper third of Arkansas.  You have no idea which park your at so if you would like to travel there to see the scenes first hand you can't.  If you need scenic views to show on a big screen during a party, this video would suit your needs.  If you would like a video that educates people about the beautiful scenery of Arkansas' various parks, this video falls very short.",1323043200,4,713,4.315789473684211
