Actress Donna D'Errico from Baywatch Nights became a regular cast member in this season. You also get to see Traci Bingham as Jordan Tate. And junior lifeguard Manny Guitterez, played by actor Jose Solano. This season 7 is the last year for actress Pamela Anderson and Yasmine Bleeth.",1328572800,2,392,4.865671641791045
