8015811,3,B0001OGUV8,"The SD's are a fun group, and the skits are cute.  The big problem is that they spend about 2 minutes on each topic.  A little surprising as they could make MORE money if they spent longer, making MORE DVDs.",1381622400,,207,4.15
8015812,3,B0001OGUV8,"THE VIDEO WAS OKAY, I FELT IT COULD'VE GONE JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE IN DEPTH.  IT SKIMMED THROUGH EACH TOPIC WITHOUT GIVING EXAMPLES ON HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  IT'S LIKE BEING IN CLASS, AND THE PROFESSOR IS EXPLAINING THE TOPIC, BUT STILL, IT'S NOT WELL EXPLAINED.",1293926400,,266,4.520833333333333
8015813,5,B0001OGUV8,"This is a great video for any teacher to use in their chemistry class.  Its smart, funny, fast paced, and interesting.  Its great to use as an intro to a section, or as a closer right before a chapter test.",939254400,,206,4.125
