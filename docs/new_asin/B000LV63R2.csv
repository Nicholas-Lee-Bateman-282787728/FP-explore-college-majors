8164227,1,B000LV63R2,"One shouldn't waste to many words of rubbish like this. The film is seriosuly inept. The likable lead might have been better employed with a half-decent script, director and cast.",1175126400,3,179,5.0
8164228,3,B000LV63R2,A fun movie with a lighthearted cast makes this entertaining. A clever story with good writing. The characters are both sincere and quirky. Fun to watch with friends over pizza.,1172534400,3,177,4.933333333333334
