5062274,5,B0077PBPXM,"The 4/25/12 NOVA episode entitled SECRETS OF THE SUN reveals that much more is known about the yellow dwarf at our Solar System's center than was available just a decade ago. The goal of scientists who study the sun is to reach a point where solar events called Coronal Mass Ejections (or CMEs) can be predicted. The tons of electrically-charged particles hurled toward Earth at a million mph by a single CME have the potential, if in a large enough quantity, to overload and shut down power grids on a worldwide scale, a catastrophe that could take a decade to fully recover from.

Because our sun generates sound waves of varying frequencies, its interior can be seen using a new type of science called helioseismology.  We're shown gorgeous maps of the sun this technique reveals, images completely different from those of its surface.

This 53 minute episode explains in clear language the mysterious workings of this star. Although large enough to contain a million Earths, its core, where nuclear fusion occurs, is only 25 times the size of our planet. We learn how particles freed from this dense plasma mass take 100,000 years to work through the radiative zone in a zigzag fashion, then a month to travel straight toward the surface through the sun's convective zone and just a handful of minutes to reach Earth as light and heat.

Also explained is why the sun's magnetic field is haphazard compared to Earth's, how polarized flare loops at its surface are affected by turbulence below and what actually causes the explosive throwing of plasma into space. Sun spots are also explored.

An advanced camera system on a recently placed satellite permit scientists at NOAA and other facilities to view the entire sun's surface in greater detail than ever before. We are also shown glimpses of these awesome images. Combined with helioseismology, they present a clearer picture of the maelstrom that is the source of all life in our little nook of the Universe.

Thanks to plain speaking scientists who participate in SECRETS OF THE SUN, the otherwise complex processes that occur there are made understandable, and viewers can come away from this fascinating show having learned much about Sol, our brilliant light in the sky.",1335744000,19,2232,4.938666666666666

5062281,5,B0077PBPXM,Got this as a gift for my boyfriend who had seen the show on PBS a couple years earlier and loved it.  Fascinating stuff.,1358121600,3,121,4.041666666666667
5062282,5,B0077PBPXM,"Secrets of the Sun is another must for your library.  The Sun's surface is revealed at its most dynamic and the Sun's core, via computer images, is just as fascinating. It was only until recently that science can study the surface of the Sun, analyze sunspots and why they occur.  Coronal Mass Ejections (CME?  Yes! Those too are explained in detail and what happens when they hit the Earth and provide the Auroras. What amazed me, is our laboratories can record a ""live"" Sun image on the wall for study! You come away with an appreciation of that ball of fire that gives us light and heat. The documentary would wonderful for school classrooms for you science teachers out there.",1355616000,8,680,4.65
5062283,5,B0077PBPXM,"I purchased this for my 5 year old son who is fascinated by science. He watched the whole DVD in one sitting. I watched it with him and even I learned incredible things that I never knew existed. This is a great DVD with amazing interviews, incredible graphics, very easy to understand, extremely informative.

5062284,5,B0077PBPXM,"This is a video that anyone paying attention to the SUN these days, simply,,, ""Just,,, must,, have!""  If you wish to know what causes explosions on the sun often shown daily at a Space Weather a web site, get this video immediately!  Reflecting... So much is known from a series of recent amazing SUN satellites launched by NASA, that this video has captured into one spot, that is now pieced together what our SUN does, I am left speaking to others as if I am some kind of expert, which I am not...  Should I just say, I 've watch this video four times,,, and that I am planning on watching it again and again...  Na...  ""I will just continue to be a PRETENDER!""

8511934,5,B0077PBPXM,"I first watched this documentary on Netflix awhile back, and watched it again a few weeks later.  A few months had passed and I wanted to watch it again with my daughter and husband, but it was no longer on Netflix, so I decided to purchase a copy to keep.",1522195200,,256,4.12
8511935,5,B0077PBPXM,"I love, love, love this DVD! It was wonderful, full of incredible new facts, excellent speakers, and incredible knowleage! I have become very careful about checking the dates on new documentaries, to be sure that I am getting the very latest in the topic, in this case Sol. I was not displeased, not in the least! Technology, science, and new theories and knowledge are coming to the fore all the time now, and it makes a huge difference in our thinking and looking at these different topics in a whole new way. I highly recommend this for the armchairs and high school kids who love astronomy!",1512950400,,594,4.613207547169812
8511936,5,B0077PBPXM,Very good documentary. Learn about the Sun. Recommended.,1470009600,,56,6.125
8511937,2,B0077PBPXM,"There are interesting facts about the sun, such as musical sound waves being used to determine the structure under the surface of the sun.  And the visual images of the sun's surface are amazing!  However, a major distraction is the disturbingly bushy eyebrows of the lead scientist who is given a lot of camera time.  Each eyebrow is so thick it could wind the Gabby Hayes mustache contest.  It is disturbing and distracting from the scientific message to have such an UN-groomed individual being given so much on camera time.  This would be the equivalence of putting a person  on TV with a strange appearance and then telling them to read the evening news.  People would just turn it off.  And I don't watch this video anymore because of the distraction.",1448064000,,757,4.7251908396946565

8511941,5,B0077PBPXM,"Nova does it again with this update on the sun.  Solar astronomy goes back centuries, but it was given another shot in the arm with the launch of a new satellite, known as SOHO.  It allows us to monitor the sun all the time and to see it in far better detail than ever before, including the ability to study the sounds within the sun, its seismology.

The program begins with a short history of what we know about the sun:  the core is where all the energy is produced and it takes many years for the photons to work their way to the surface.

One of the keys to understanding the sun is its powerful magnetic field -- this is responsible for sunspots and they in turn are responsible for space weather -- the sun is constantly giving off charged particles, as well as light, and those particles can have a very powerful and drastic effect on us here on earth.

Solar storms occur when the sunspots explode; they are darkened by virtue of the fact that the magnetic fields don't let the light out so easily and, when they do, it often goes off with a bang:  lots of particles that slam into earth's magnetic field and cause brilliant aurorae and, sometimes, damage to things like our power grid.  Those power lines make a wonderful antenna that picks up that energy and directs it into some of the key components, sometimes burning them out.

There is so much good detail in this program that I've watched it three times and still learn more every time.  Well worth the effort, if only to understand that we have to take our star seriously for our own good.",1422835200,2,1557,4.393728222996516
8511942,3,B0077PBPXM,"Decent interesting information.  Not the most entrancing thing I've watched, but then how many DVDs do you have about how the sun works?",1416873600,,136,4.913043478260869
8511943,5,B0077PBPXM,"So many NOVA programs have become melodramatic but this one is a solid, engaging, and informative look at that star we all take for granted.  Very well done.",1411603200,,157,4.607142857142857
