8097684,5,B000CCSADU,"This DVD is fantastic. Worth the money for the best entertainment ever (for me)! The modern opera based on the book ""Notre Dame de Paris"" by great 19th century French writer Victor Hugo. This is the Italian version of the original French version by (Italian-French) composer/songwriter/singer Riccardo Cocciante. The French libreto by Luc Plamondon. Italian libreto version by Pasquale Panella. Production by David Zard and Charles Talar. The recording is from the live performance in Arena di Verona in 2002 (with 35,000+ spectators). This is just a fantastic entertainment - intelligent, rich, deep, and highly emotional. I don't know even where to start. Everything from production, director, and organization, to music and music arrangement to scenography to choreography to light show to sound recording to costumes and make-up and to ALL performers (singers, dancers, acrobats, etc.). It makes my cry every time when listening to Gio, Lola, Vittorio, Marco, Matteo, Graziano and Claudia. Both female and male dancers are just wonderful. Words are not enough to describe intense emotions watching and listening.",1384732800,2,1116,5.494186046511628
