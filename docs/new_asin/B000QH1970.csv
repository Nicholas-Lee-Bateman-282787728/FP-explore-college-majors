8196406,4,B000QH1970,"While I realise this was made in 1999 and before the current & popular ""Aerial"" series now made of America and other countries of the world, this is almost a 'blink and you'll miss it' rush over one of the most beautiful countries in the world.  At a running time of only 56 mins, this could have been so much better as a full feature length 2 hours at the very least.  As a non-Canadian I found the speed at which the flyovers were taken too fast and didn't give one really a chance to properly see some places.  What is does do is leave you wishing for more!

But that aside, it's spectacular (or should I say the scenery is) but where was the world famous Butchart Gardens?  I do hope someday someone will make an extended version of this idea, perhaps state-by-state and REALLY let us see Canada.",1378166400,,800,4.306666666666667
8196407,5,B000QH1970,"Wonderful photography. Excellent picture quality. It shows me many gorgeous scenes of Canada I've never seen before.

Other good DVD's about Canada are: Over Canada, Canada by Rail, Greatest Canadian Invention.",1183161600,3,210,5.774193548387097
8196408,5,B000QH1970,I love this tasteful and artistic video. The scenery is so beautiful that I can't bring myself to look away from the screen for a second so as not to miss anything. It's mesmerizing. The musical accompanyment is also well chosen and very Canadian. There are some scenes that give me goosebumps every time I watch them. Makes me feel proud to live in this gorgeous country. I just wish I could afford to buy copies for all my overseas friends.,1074816000,,442,4.469135802469136
