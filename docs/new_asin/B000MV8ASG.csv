8172611,1,B000MV8ASG,"I don't fault Amazon for this mistake, it must have happened at the factory. The DVD inside the case had the correct label and everything but would not play in any of our DVD players. We put it in our computer to see if it would play there and discovered that a bunch of medical data was on the DVD and not the actual music DVD we were hoping to get. I wonder if someone out there needs their medical tutorials and got an acoustic jam dvd instead....",1320105600,,450,4.125

8172613,3,B000MV8ASG,"People who can play the guitar really well, won't buy this DVD, so they should know their customer base is more in the beginner area.  I am trying to play Every Rose has it's Thorn - but like the other reviewer mentioned, it give the chords, but not the strumming pattern, which is critical.  I have even used all the camera angles and gone in slow motion using my DVD player (played slowly is also they should have done) I still can't figure out for sure the strumming for the song.  It's too hard to tell when he strikes the strings, despite going in slo-mo over and over and over and over again.  Why wouldn't they even go over that 1 time ?  It doesn't make sense.  This could have been a 5 star DVD, but because of that I gave it 3 (and could have dropped it to 2).  And unfortunately every tab I have seen on the net was different than this one - don't know who's right (for ERHIThorn) - but I can't get help for the strumming pattern for this DVD on the net either.",1263168000,2,972,4.111111111111111
8172614,3,B000MV8ASG,"Es un dvd que trae la tablaturas, pero las explicaciones son muy rapidas y debes de estar regresando a ciertos riffs para que te resulte facil poder tocar la cancion, creo que la combinacion de las canciones no es 100 % en el mismo genero ya que mescalan Slaughter con Goo goo Dolls",1256256000,,282,4.339622641509434
8172615,5,B000MV8ASG,"This is a great product at a great price.  Keep in mind one thing, it only does what it claims to do. No more, and no less.

 It does give you a lesson before each song which include chords used and rythm to the main riffs.  It does not play the song for you.  To use the DVDs in this series you must practice practice practice.  Take it slow and be patient.

 I spent months with other beginner guitar dvds before i found this one.  I do not regret practicing with or purchasing others, ( I have used Metal Method DVDS and the John Petrucci Rock Discipline DVD).  However, after playing with those dvds and practicing for over 6 months I still could not play a complete song.

That is where this DVD series comes in.  After practicing with this DVD about 3 hours a day for one week, I can play along with and sing (at the same time) to be with you by Mr. Big.  If you are a beginner who wants to learn a whole song choose one of these DVDs and practice your butt off.",1214870400,5,968,4.058201058201059
8172616,2,B000MV8ASG,"I was very disappointed in this DVD.  He didn't break down the strumming pattern or the picking techniques. He goes through the each chord used which is great, but when there were no other instructions after that - just video showing him playing.  Perhaps the dvd is not geared towards beginners who require a little more information than just the chords used for a song.",1194739200,3,371,4.6923076923076925
