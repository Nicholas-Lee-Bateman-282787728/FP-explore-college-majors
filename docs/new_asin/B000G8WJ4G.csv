I think that's what they mean by ""Enhanced Audio.""

All in all, a very nice collection.",1430524800,,330,4.360655737704918
8129602,1,B000G8WJ4G,"Don't bother with the public domain episodes of ""The Lucy Show."" You're throwing away your money. The audio and video quality isn't very good. Buy the official season releases of ""The Lucy Show."" We already have seasons one through three out. Season four should be out sometime in March 2011. You won't believe the difference between the shabby quality of the public domain episodes and the unbelievable quality of the official releases. It's like they were filmed a month ago. In addition you get great bonus features. So stop buying the same 30 episodes. I was fooled twice and decided to wait for the real thing.",1292198400,,615,4.811320754716981
8129603,2,B000G8WJ4G,"The eight sitcom episodes on this GENIUS ENTERTAINMENT product are certainly tempting. Be advised however that the description ""sound enhanced"" means cheesy modern music that's used in place of theme songs or during breaks in action where background score is all you hear.

Programs thus tampered with are very annoying, especially to those who remember how they originally sounded. I made the mistake of buying one of GENIUS's TV Guide ""sound enhanced"" box sets, but won't be purchasing others.

Change the channel.",1275868800,3,516,5.280487804878049
