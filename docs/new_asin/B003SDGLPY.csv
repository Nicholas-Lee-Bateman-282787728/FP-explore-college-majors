4187965,5,B003SDGLPY,"I bought this as a gag gift when I found out my girlfriends step father was ""Richard Simmons"". Not the exercise guy in the video, but who could resist bringing this along to meet him for the first time. The item arrived on time and as promised. Another great purchase.",1352764800,,268,4.38
4187966,5,B003SDGLPY,"Tonin' to the Oldies follows the great Richard Simmons tradition of making workouts fun with singalong music.  It's a quick 25 minute workout, that you can do when you don't have a lot of time, but want to get a workout in.  Focus is on the arms with dance/leg movement an integral part of it.  I would recommend this to anyone whether you're a beginner or exercise regularly.  The resistance bands are not a necessity, but add challenge to the workout.",1350345600,10,453,4.555555555555555
4187967,5,B003SDGLPY,"Very happy with my most recent purchase of ""Tonin' to the Oldies with Bonus Resistance Bands. Got order per terms.",1342742400,2,114,4.75
4187968,5,B003SDGLPY,"I will give Richard Simmons credit. He is a good work out for those of us that have no rhythm. He isn't slow paced, but not so fast paced that you can't catch up in a step or two, or wind up giving up altogether.
I like that the music is literally the oldies, from the 50's/60's/70's, and not from a few years ago, and also I love the fact it isn't rap, like so many others tend to have on their sound track.
I did 2 songs, and was relieved that this a 30min dvd, and you can do 1 or 2 songs, and work up to the full 1/2 hour. Also the dvd shows you how to use the cords correctly. And YES, mine came with cords.
All in all, I am very happy with Tonin' to the Oldies, and is always nice to see its Richard Simmons, who was doing this before it became the thing to do, and is still fun to watch and move with.",1341619200,23,808,3.7588235294117647
4187969,3,B003SDGLPY,"I bought this video as a gift, so I have not actually watched it/done the workout.  The description was unclear about if the Boogies Cords needed to do the excercises were included or not.  They are not.  I couldn't even find them available on Amazon, so I had to go to richardsimmons.com and order them separately.",1319673600,6,315,4.589285714285714
4187970,1,B003SDGLPY,I feel as if the customers should be sent a work out cord since it does say in the description that it comes with one.,1318982400,7,118,3.76
4187971,3,B003SDGLPY,"I received this DVD today.  It looks like a great workout, but no boogie cords where included as stated in the description of the DVD.  Now I must find and purchase the boogie cords separately in order to do this exercise program.",1307145600,18,230,4.4523809523809526
4187972,5,B003SDGLPY,"This DVD is suppose to come with Boogie cords and it did not. The DVD doesn't even look new, and if it was new the Boggie cords would be with the item. They lied that it was new and charged me full price. Worst of all, they list no e-mail or phone number for you to contact them with. I would never buy from then again.",1302480000,14,319,3.8484848484848486

4187977,5,B003SDGLPY,"Love this product.  Music selection and work out was easy to do at home.

I've recommended this Tonin video to many friends and family.",1473724800,,272,4.510204081632653

4187980,4,B003SDGLPY,"Richard Simmons is lots of fun and he works hard to take care of his ""charges"". As a senior, that's what I need and I like to move to the music that had me dancin' as a teenager. The bands work easily to help me keep strong and toned without damaging ""well used"" muscles. I enjoy having this one in my fitness library.",1459209600,,318,4.063492063492063
4187981,4,B003SDGLPY,"I really liked this workout, but due to physical limitations and previous permanent upper body injuries, I could not do it properly or safely.  If you have any injury in your shoulders or neck or upper body please use this video with care!  Plus, you would need to purchase the boogie cords separately because they are not included and you need them to do the workout.  There is nothing on the box or label to let you know the boogie cords are not included.",1456012800,,457,4.416666666666667
4187982,4,B003SDGLPY,"This is a great toning video if you use heavy weights or strong resistance bands. Also, regular bands won't work with this, you need to have his particular ones otherwise it's just frustrating.",1454284800,,193,4.878787878787879
4187983,4,B003SDGLPY,"Not as long as I expected; does not include much lower-body workout. After reading the reviews, I ordered the ""boogie cords"" from another seller at the same time. Could do without the end of self-congratulatory hoopla. However, the workout seems to do well for upper body toning. We'll see.",1453075200,2,290,4.938775510204081
4187984,5,B003SDGLPY,"I love Richard Simmons but I hate to work out so when I watch his video, I tell myself that I am ""dancing,"" not working out and it works for me.  Good music and you can follow along easily.",1450137600,,189,3.8461538461538463

4187996,1,B003SDGLPY,Tonin to the Oldies was to replace an older work out of Richard Simmons where toning cords were used. The older session was was structured and provided clear instructions for a good workout.  Tonin with the Oldies is not in the same league with the older session. The short little workout does not meet my needs. Previous customer reviews complained about the cords not being included with the DVD.,1428796800,,398,4.768115942028985

4188003,5,B003SDGLPY,"A joyful dvd.  Everyone on it is having a wonderful time with smiles from ear to ear.  The exercises are easy to do and the time flies.  Didn't want it to end.  Richard is sensational as ever, sensitive and encouraging.",1422489600,,219,4.4

4188005,5,B003SDGLPY,Awesome DVD. It is WAY too short and the resistance bands are way too easy but it is really fun how the bands are with you during all the moves. So if you get some harder resistance bands and do it twice it would be even better. It was more fun than anything. I don't expect this dvd to help with toning because it is so easy and short.,1422316800,,336,3.8840579710144927
4188006,4,B003SDGLPY,"Oops, this DVD do not come with the toning cords which means it is useless.  Such a shame since I love Richard Simmons.  Will have to see if I can find the cords separately.

4188026,3,B003SDGLPY,"I bought a Richard Simmons  video probably 15-18 years ago featuring similar resistance bands and I loved that video; however, it wore out and so I bought this DVD, thinking it would be similar.  Don't care for it so much!!",1402358400,,223,4.55
4188027,5,B003SDGLPY,"This is a fun hybrid workout of toning and cardio. The bands are low resistance, but add intensity to the cardio movements. The music is awesome and Richard is great, as always!",1398816000,,177,4.5625

4188034,2,B003SDGLPY,"If you got this thinking you would improve your workout using these bands you won't improve unless your so weak and out of shape, you can't move forward to the next level.  I would recommend getting just bands themselves, and follow that workout, I'm sure the results would at least worth mentioning.",1394064000,,300,4.769230769230769

4188039,5,B003SDGLPY,"Oh what can I say..... haven't exercised in years and he makes it fun. I challenge any one to put this on and not move right along with him.

4188041,4,B003SDGLPY,I was very pleased with this video. I have the first two Sweatin' to the Oldies videos. I love working out to the songs and it is nice to see people of different sizes. This video gave me a great workout.,1384819200,,204,4.0
4188042,3,B003SDGLPY,"The exercises are good and the music is upbeat, but the exercise bands are NOT designed for someone who is only 4 ft 10. Unfortunately, the bands are not adjustable and some of the routines are not geared toward using bands that are not attached to the feet, as the Simmons bands are. I hope I can return them. It's a shame, because I love Sweating to the Oldies 1 and 2 and was looking to do some toning/resistance exercises to my kind of music.

If you are ""normal"" height, you will probably enjoy and get a lot of use from this tape.",1381190400,,536,4.203883495145631
4188043,5,B003SDGLPY,"I'm in my late 60's and was looking for something a little better geared to my age group...and to keep muscles functioning.  I figured Richard was reaching my age and must have something out for ""olders"".  This fits the bill perfectly.  I bought this set and also bought an additional pair of his resistance bands (from another source), since I work out 3 times a week (in my ""gym"" in my basement) with a friend.  So one day a week we do the original ""Sweatin' to the Oldies"" (as well as we can at our age!), one day we do this Tonin' to the Oldies, and one day we do machine workouts.  This toning CD (and you really need these bands for it) is a great workout for keeping upper muscles strong. And I have no trouble keeping up.  Highly recommend it.",1378339200,10,751,4.253521126760563

The resistance bands really helps to tone and take off some of those unwanted inches...fun, fun, fun, and you sweat too!",1376092800,,269,4.702127659574468
4188046,5,B003SDGLPY,"Fun, fun, fun! As usual, Richard choreographed a great  DVD filled with aerobic dance and resistance training. The songs are fun, the moves are smooth! The ""Boogie Bands ""(resistance bands) are a unique twist on others that I have used in the past. These are put on BEFORE you put you shoes on. There are plastic clips that you use to attach/re-attach your bands - ingenious! For me, the resistance training was not difficult but I made it  more difficult by knotting each band so it was harder to do an exercise!
If you have never exercised or if you need a very low impact workout, then this would be the one to buy - you won't be disappointed!",1373587200,,646,4.420168067226891

4188049,5,B003SDGLPY,"I haven't exercised with a daily for quite awhile, although my job as a nurse assistant does keep me moving constantly.  Richard Simmons has always been an inspiring ""coach"" and this workout did not disappoint.  I enjoyed every minute of the workout.  It took me only a few steps to get caught up with the others on the video as the steps changed and not once during the video did I feel like quitting. I recommend this purchase to anyone of any fitness level as they show all shapes, sizes and ages in various modes of excerise (sitting and with/without boogie bands).",1371427200,,569,4.5588235294117645

4188051,3,B003SDGLPY,"There is very little aerobic workout very low low impact. Yet the BANDS and the toning section is awesome.
The toning part really paid for itself and free bands cant beat that.
I recommend using other dvds for your cardio to alternate with this toning class.",1370217600,3,258,4.630434782608695

4188053,4,B003SDGLPY,"The DVD is good to work with, but to see Richard Simmons struggling to exercise with a bad leg is a little hard to see.  I always thought people who did physical fitness exercises for a living would stay in great shape forever.  But between Jane Fonda and Richard I see it just isn't so.  But I do see that no matter what age you've got to MOVE!!!",1369526400,,347,4.073529411764706
4188054,3,B003SDGLPY,"I was expecting this video to have more workout routines, longer video time.
It does have a good workout for the upper body and that is it. If that's all you want to tone then this is a good buy.",1369008000,3,195,3.9
4188055,5,B003SDGLPY,"I love the sweating to the oldies, and this makes an excellent addition to my collection. I just wish I could find the Stretching to the classics on DVD. I used to have it on VHS and it was great for relaxing before bed time. I love Richard Simmons!!! :)

4188056,5,B003SDGLPY,Product was received very fast and in perfect condition. it came with toning straps and the moves are very easy to follow. Just what the doctor ordered to get the weight down and muscles toned!! And it's FUN!!,1367971200,,209,4.526315789473684
4188057,5,B003SDGLPY,Excellent dvd. It DOES come with the necessary boogie cords. Good work out. Classic richard simmons style- fun ans effective.,1367712000,,125,5.3
4188058,5,B003SDGLPY,"You cannot help but enjoy working out with Richard Simmons.  The DVD has great music selections, the set and people are dressed colorfully, everyone appears upbeat and happy and you get 30 minutes of aerobic exercise with resistance bands that help you tone.  You will sweat, you will be sore the next day, but you will also feel accomplished.  I have knee problems but I could easily do this workout.  I recommend!",1367625600,8,415,4.722222222222222
4188059,2,B003SDGLPY,this item was a gift for my mother. she did not like it. It does not come with the proper equipment which is not good.,1367280000,,118,3.76
4188060,5,B003SDGLPY,Our group of ladies 45+ has most of Richard Simmons DVD exercise videos.  We especially like this one & hv each purchased the bands to do it.  It is an excellent workout & you can feel the workout with the bands. Us older woman are enjoying this very much.,1366243200,,256,4.204081632653061
4188061,5,B003SDGLPY,"I really love this workout! With a healthy eating program and using this DVD 4-5 times a week, I've lost over 20 pounds and 1 size in just 6 weeks.
What makes this DVD so good is that it is only approximately 30+ minutes long and fun.  I sometime alternate this workout with Richard Simmons ""Sweating to the Oldis"" original workout which is 45 minutes long.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.",1365206400,,397,4.424657534246576
4188062,5,B003SDGLPY,I love this video because the music is so energizing and Richard Simmons provides a great workout while being funny and entertaining.  The Bonus Resistance Bands help increase the challenge of the workout and leaves you feeling that you have accomplished a great workout without leaving your home and/or going to a gym.  Great value for the price!,1364688000,8,347,4.9655172413793105
4188063,5,B003SDGLPY,"Classic Richard Simmons, a workout anyone can do. Great oldies music and real people working out.  Wish I had the bands though, as most of the exercises called for them.",1362700800,,169,4.633333333333334
4188064,4,B003SDGLPY,I enjoy toning to this video. This meets the same standards that Richard has done in his past videos I will be using this video.,1362441600,,128,4.16
4188065,3,B003SDGLPY,"Richard Simmons moves fast from move to move, and it takes a bit to catch up.  They really need to include those bands with the purchase because you can't use bands you already have.  These are special that attach to your feet.  I modified the moves a little to use the toning cords I had, but really wish those bands would have been included. Richard is his usual goofy self.  =)",1362355200,7,380,4.309859154929577
4188066,1,B003SDGLPY,"After having done this workout several times -- I can't tell I have even done anything, even after trying to exert more effort into it. Very disappointed.",1362268800,,154,4.7407407407407405
4188067,5,B003SDGLPY,I had this in VHS format and was always one of my favorite videos.  I am really glad to have found it in a DVD,1361836800,,110,3.4
4188068,4,B003SDGLPY,I knew after reading other reviews that I wouldn't get boogie cords with this dvd but I decided that wasn't going to stop me doing the workout so I chose to do this with light dumbells. If you choose this method you will have to adjust some movements a bit but believe me it's a good workout. By the end of the first weights song I feel like my arms are going to fall off but I always keep going because I adore Richard and his motivation always puts a smile on my face. I finish the workout with a big smile on my face because I know that I've forced my muscles to work which is all I can ask from a workout DVD. I do highly recommend this workout as you can tailor it to work for you even if you don't have boogie cords. Use some tomato soup cans or light dumbells. No excuses not to do it.,1360368000,8,792,3.9254658385093166
4188069,5,B003SDGLPY,I am older now and and trying to get in shape for my health. Most of what's out there now is too intense for me. This was perfect!,1360281600,11,130,3.6785714285714284
4188070,5,B003SDGLPY,"I'm a huge fan of Richard Simmons to begin with and have many of his tapes and CD's.  He's fun to work out with.  You also do not have to learn to get the steps perfect; as long as you're moving, then you get a good workout.  I also like that the others working out with him in the DVD are people of various shapes and sizes.  It shows us that no matter what our weight, we can still work out, even if we do it from sitting in a chair.

I've been on a couple cruises with Richard, and he really does care about people, and you can see that in his workouts.

If you're looking for a workout that's fun, then Richard's are the one for you.",1358985600,,637,3.89922480620155
4188071,4,B003SDGLPY,"I think his workouts are  enjoyable  and he  gets you motivated in a fun way.  The music  is good too, and  the  moves are very easy to follow. The workout is not intense, by any means, but  I wasn't looking for a high aerobic, tough workout.

The resistance bands are very light  weight, , but  sturdy and loop under  each foot separately. They do add some resistance and variety to the workout.  I am pleased with this DVD.",1358812800,12,425,4.294871794871795
4188072,3,B003SDGLPY,"I ""goofed"" on this purchase.....failed to read the other customer reviews before purchasing and then found out the toning cords needed to do this workout weren't included with purchase.  Now I have to purchase them separately.  I love the Richard Simmons workouts....but am not happy that the cords were not included with this DVD...but partly my fault for not ""reading"" first!  Had I done that, I probably wouldn't have purchased this DVD.",1358640000,6,440,5.083333333333333
