7664374,5,B01BN1BSVY,"Don't be put off by the title.  Really really good movie.  So right-on with the romance and the issues in relationships.  No the least bit sappy.  The only aspect of the movie I took issue with was the performance by the young blond guy who was competing with the main character at the ad agency (that guy's performance is WAY over the top.  The movie would have been better without him).  Well acted by all, with that one exception.  My subtitles worked fine.",1467590400,5,460,4.469879518072289
7664375,5,B01BN1BSVY,"Mikko Nousainen is BRILLIANT in this one, as he is in Levottomat, which I highly recommend that you check out.

First of all, this is NOT a ""low budget"" film as others suggest. This is just a film that is in Finnish style cinema. This has some well known Finnish actors in it. It has a references to many things in Finnish culture that if you are interested in seeing, you can see very well in this film. However, if you just want to watch a foreign film, in traditional American style, you will be disappointed, like the other guy who holds Finnish morals up to American ones, which is IMPOSSSIBLE!

The Finnish people are open-minded about sex throughout their whole lives, as projected here. Stigu doesn't live a life unlike many other Finnish men, single into their 40's. He is struggling to say how he feels and so is she, which is typical of Finnish culture. They use sex as a way to connect, which is part of Finnish culture. The Wife Carrying competition is another GREAT thing about Finnish culture and really cool if you hear the story about how this happened. You can see in Finnish business culture how laid back they are, as Stigu is wearing jeans to work in a corporate environment.

YOu can see how it feels sort of like a small place where you see people you know, everywhere you go. In Turku many people have cars so this is not so common in all places in Finland. You can see how the business loan practices are reflected upon the experience of the borrower, not so the credit.

I could really go on all day, from the opening scene and friendships, to how Stigu struggles to say ""I love you"" at the end, about how this film is a great mini holiday in Finland. Watch it, study it, learn about a great people! Does it have some entertainment value? Yes! The backdrop is quite dark, which is how almost all Finnish movies are. Throughout most of the movie, you can feel the negativity. In American movies, we like to keep things upbeat. They like the kind of dark feeling, which represents them and their climate. You never know what life is like, living without the sun most of your life, until you live it.

Enjoy this movie:  Rakkauden rasvaprosentti

By the way, Finns didn't rate it that high either. Their criticism was more of the development of the characters, not so much the plot. They all agree in the reviews that this is DEFINITELY a Finnish film!",1465862400,11,2375,4.45852534562212
7664376,4,B01BN1BSVY,"This was a bit congested, it was a bit difficult to follow however everyone learned their lessons and lived happily ever after!",1465689600,,127,4.818181818181818
7664377,5,B01BN1BSVY,"Wonderful, engaging story;  entertaining premise.  enjoyed the characters and scenery",1464566400,2,85,7.4
7664378,3,B01BN1BSVY,"OK. You have to understand that this film has no subtitles. It's in Swedish - I think.

The title has nothing to do with the plot. I'm 99% sure of that, and I watched the whole flam-dam film without a clue as to what anyone was saying. It was a refreshing little trip to a Scandinavian country, with lots of sunshine, open space, cool apartment interiors, and some fairly tame sex scenes (the usual pounding and oral sex which today seems truly tame.)

Stigu and Ella are creative types. She has something to do with dress design. He has something to do with advertising campaigns. He is almost 40 and still speeds to work on his skateboard, wearing a tee-shirt. This is meant to be cool, hip, and charming. Ella schedules him into her day for 40 or 50 minutes of sex. That is meant to be cool, hip, and charming. They go to poetry slams, they hang out with affluent friends, Stigu's best friend's wife has a baby so you know that they know 'grown-ups.'

According to American morality and culture, they are very recognizable to a young audience. Stretching adolescence into your forties is not just an American thing!

I was entertained. I could be wrong about this being a Swedish movie. I think that 'Nay' means 'No' in Swedish, and I think I heard 'Nay' from time to time. It could be Norwegian. Not likely to be Finnish because there would be 'dottirs' galore, and those are missing.

Someone should 1) change the name of this movie; whoever titled it is trying to atttract the attention of fat Americans, and 2) add subtitles. The favorable reviews of this film have to be fabbricated - this is not the best romantic comedy you'll ever see. It's not bad. It's pretty good in a sentimental, romantic, predictable way. But it's really like being plunked down in the middle of a strange culture with no road signs and no interpreter. That can be fun. Or not.",1464393600,,1861,4.526785714285714
7664379,3,B01BN1BSVY,"A low-budget movie yet delivers a good story. I should give 4 stars at least  but the quality of playback, always freezing on the first 40 minutes. Nevertheless, good acting especially on the guy.",1464220800,,196,4.764705882352941
7664380,5,B01BN1BSVY,"romantic comedies are not an important part of my balanced movie diet. that having been said i should admit that i have seen quite a few romcoms. this movie is The Best romantic comedy i have seen. it should not be assumed that this movie is better than classics such as BRINGING UP BABY, but it is fair to say that BRINGING UP BABY was a movie which was much more biased toward comedy than romance. this movie is the best romantic comedy that i have seen which is strong in both romance and comedy. also noticeably lacking are any distractions such as crude humor or topical subtexts.",1464220800,5,585,4.425925925925926

7664390,5,B01BN1BSVY,"I thought it was very well done, loved the northern feel I intuited from the light and the sort of serious but deep backdrop. A sweet love story with recognizable dilemmas and regrets that go with loving and losing.",1469577600,2,215,4.538461538461538
8750759,4,B01BN1BSVY,Cute romantic comedy with a weird title.  Editing seems a little sketchy and of course it is predicable (what romantic comedy isn't).  Some laugh out loud funny parts. Mikko Nousiainen is wonderful.,1528502400,,198,5.15625
8750760,4,B01BN1BSVY,"A realistic, comical and empathetic view of relationships. No hollywood-style acting here, however I think to really capture the feeling of this movie there's no need. Ella and Stigu make an interesting pair having come together under personal and work related circumstances. I think it gives an outstanding perspective on the role and norms of relationships in Finland. Watching the characters evolve individually and as a couple is entertaining and relatable to anyone in any stage of romance- surely not an hour and a half wasted!",1513468800,,533,5.209302325581396
8750761,1,B01BN1BSVY,"Mainstream propaganda at its best. The actor from original flick ""Levottomat"" was the reason I watched this nonsense and I expected
some new ideas--big disappointment. Plot? Yeah, lifetime channel has it everyday; chicks ugly, old and nothing to talk about; skin factor zero;
music zero; real life--maybe as I never visited Finland. People trying make good living?--ok, but not good enough for me.",1507248000,,397,5.317460317460317
8750762,4,B01BN1BSVY,A chick flick. But I liked it just because it gives a Finnish perspective.,1503100800,,74,4.357142857142857
8750763,5,B01BN1BSVY,"Great movie, romantic, caring. Great to add the children skit at the beginning and end. I thought I missed some dialog in the translation. I would like to see it updated, and see what I missed in translation.",1490832000,,208,4.5

8750766,2,B01BN1BSVY,"Decent acting. Too predictable-- nothing new or creative about this storyline. The other reason this movie was lacking was that it follows the current movie trend of the woman being cold and difficult to connect with in relationship, I guess as a statement of feminist strength(?), when it's obvious she wants love too. Not showing your heart is not a strength. I like to watch movies depicting Real romance.",1485043200,,408,4.927536231884058
8750767,2,B01BN1BSVY,This was all right.,1484784000,,19,4.0
8750768,5,B01BN1BSVY,"I loved this! Definitely different than American style movies, and that's a big reason for liking it. Much quieter, real-life, not so in-your-face with explanations, musical wallpaper or special sound effects- the audience is left to figure things out a bit or the explanation comes later. The two main characters do a lot of emoting with their facial expressions (yes, Finns CAN have facial expressions) and the long time that the camera may linger allows us to see the inner workings of the characters. I also loved seeing the Summer midnight Sun, which I experienced and how easy it is to keep doing stuff since you never get the feeling to go to bed! To get thru' all of the goals this picture sets out to do was a big task, but with several enjoyable hitches and twists, everything works out to the best. Very authentic and believable, even the business development office where the 'work experience' will win her the loan for her business plan. Finns are often mis-judged as being humorless, they rather have a different style, sometimes very wry, slightly wicked but never fake. Their saying for it: A Finnish smile is rare, but genuine. The people in this movie behaved so naturally I forgot I was watching actors.",1483315200,3,1222,4.768867924528302
