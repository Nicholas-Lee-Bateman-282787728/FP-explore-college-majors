4073500,3,B00366BBSU,"I was excited for Sherri when she announced she was getting her own sitcom on Lifetime. The bulk of her tv career has been playing bit parts on well known shows like Friends, Everybody Loves Raymond, and Suddenly Susan. Not to mention her 4 year run on the hilarious Less Than Perfect. A show of her own was just what she deserved, but this one wasn't quite what I expected. It's based on her real life experiences with divorcing her husband who cheated on her with another woman and got her pregnant. Yeah, the premise is very similar to Reba, but it wasn't a rip-off. Far from it.

I watched every episode and unfortunately my hopes for it fell after each one. Sherri's performance is excellent, funny, a bit sad, but determined to make life better for her and her young son Bo. The supporting characters were meh at best. James Avery (you might best remember him as Uncle Phil from The Fresh Prince of Bel Air) is funny, but only appears in 4 episodes. Wish there was more of him. Sherri's best friends and co-workers played by Tammy Townsend and Elizabeth Regen feel flat and one dimensional. Her snarky ""frenemy"" co-worker Summer (Kali Rocha) tries too hard to be funny and instead comes across as obnoxious. Malcolm Jamal Warner stars as Sherri's ex-husband and does the best with the material he's given, but it's not much. Most of the episodes are predictable and made me chuckle at best. Not much else. Sherri alone couldn't carry the weight of making the show work.

It's unfortunate Sherri wasn't picked up for another season. With some radical changes and a better supporting cast it could've done better. Ms. Shepherd deserves better.",1272585600,11,1647,4.695501730103806
4073501,1,B00366BBSU,I can say I only watched a couple of episodes but I think I got the just of it.  Much of what I don't like about the show has nothing to do with Sherrie but the style of sitcom it is.  The laugh track style sitcom is really getting old and went out with Friends.  Sherrie is really funny on 30 Rock and I would love to see her on there more and become a recurring character.  I wouldn't be surprised if Lifetime brought this show back considering their lackluster programming.  But there needs to be some serious changes.,1272585600,,521,4.222222222222222
4073502,3,B00366BBSU,"Sherri: The Complete Season One
13 Episodes on 2 Discs, Widescreen Edition (2010)

Actress, comedienne, author, and co-host of The View, Sherri Shepherd stars as Sherri Robinson, a single mother who works as a paralegal still attempting to follow her dream as an actress. (Obviously, this role must be SUCH a stretch for her.) Sherri has a six year old son and is separated from her husband who cheated on her with a white girl who works at Quizno's and got her pregnant. Most of Sherri's conflicts are with her son, her ex, her career, and dating new guys.

I wish sitcoms could just be judged on how funny they actually are. Laugh-tracks still seem unusual and fake. When it doesn't rely on sentimental moments and just stays in the comedy mode, Sherri is actually pretty funny. Her delivery is enthusiastic and while the story lines are very predictable each episode, her fresh expressions help keep the show going. Her rant on the ""cow giving away the milk for free"" was one of the most hilarious moments.

It is uncertain how many of these episodes are based in some small scale on things that actually happened in Sherri's life, but whether or not the viewer has had any of her situations, they still can be pretty funny. She is easy to empathize with and who doesn't like a mad black woman going off about her ex-husband? This is one of the funnier sitcoms this year and it is easy to get drawn in with the characters and situations.

Theo from the Cosby Show (Malcolm-Jamal Warner) makes an appearance as Sherri's ex who got a white girl Quizno's employee pregnant when he cheated on her. Her father is James Avery, the dad from ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" and he shows up to give her comfort and tough love advice when she has trouble keeping her divorcee bitterness at bay. Her friends at work are all distinctive, Celia's a sassy reverend's wife (Tammy Townsend), Angie's a blond from Brooklyn (Elizabeth Regen), and Summer's a quirky nerdy single lady boss (Kali Rocha). Michael Boatman from ""Spin City"" is one of Sherri's potential suitors as her son, Bo's (Brandon Khalil) pediatrician. Bo himself is a pretty low energy personality, could've used a little more pep in their casting.

Final verdict is that this show has a lot of merit and is worth a look, especially if you are a mother, a divorcee, an actress/comedian, black, or a woman and if you are a combination of all of these, you should definitely buy this season one set. If you are a fan of Sherri's and watch ""The View"", you'll love this. There is no verdict yet that I could find on whether a second season will be made so you should check out the DVD set to see it. The season ends with a cliffhanger so there has been a bit of online message board requesting for another one.

DVD Extras:

There are 8 Webisodes including stand-up about about family, friends, kids, dating, and finding the right guy. Sherri does her version of what Jerry Seinfeld used to do for his show but she only does stand-up in Season One of her show in two episodes. It's funny, it's fresh, and it is easy to relate to without having to get shock value, swearing, or sex involved. The bits she does on friends playing games together is hilariously accurate. It seems like these may have original been recorded to go on the very beginning of the show or the credits but was not included in the show.",1271376000,4,3355,4.553897180762853

4073525,5,B00366BBSU,"I have seen many sitcoms over the years and I was SO glad I got to view something different than the caucasion-cookie-cutter-comedy. With so very many people boycotting individualism / artistic creativity in every sector these days, it is refreshing to see a funny, clean,  and a slightly naughty comedy. I literally choked laughing so hard!  I was suprised that a 'black' show would make light of stereotypes of themselves but it was in a witty way that, I felt, was not demeaning or bully-ish. The loving mother has some family issues to handle but deals with it mostly with love, laughter, intelligence, & integrity. Besides motherhood, there is an equal focus on her work life, her romantic life, and social life.
  I found it a fairly ""clean"" show and found nothing offensive; on multiple fronts. There are so many shows that are getting so gutteral, including ""cartoons"", that there was not one cynical eye roll throughout this series. I searched for a year to get this so it's a ""score!"" for me.
  As for the political statements expressed towards the lead actor here: if you knew, first hand, every actor, musician, dancer, painter,  sister, brother, friend's stance on issues & beliefs, you would be one dull dude or dudette via exclusion!  I personally can not stand babs the human, but a few songs and movies are so dear to me that I wouldn't let IT bother me or take something from my enjoyment.
  The show is a SHOW; Entertainment!  If you need to cling to your issues, cling but when you heal, there is a sweet and salty comedy waiting for you.",1418774400,,1558,4.670329670329671

4073530,5,B00366BBSU,I love this show it is so funny and heartwarming at the same time I highly recommend watching this show. Sherri Shepherd does an awesome job in her leading role,1409270400,,160,4.366666666666666
4073531,5,B00366BBSU,"I LOVE THIS SHOW, I wish it went on for more seasons.  I like THIS Sheri.  I don't care for her on the View though and am glad she's gone, she was too confrontational in my opinion.  But on this show she's funny as hell!!  I love all of the characters, it was a great ensemble show.  Although it was funny how they tried to hide the Liz Regan's budding baby bump.  Had this show been on a network with more exposure I bet it would've lasted longer.",1406851200,,448,4.034090909090909
4073532,5,B00366BBSU,"This is a very nicely done situation comedy focusing on character Sherri Robinson's efforts to balance her romantic and professional lives as a single mother. With a lively supporting cast including her co-workers Celia and Angie, as well as recurring appearances by her ex-husband and new dating interest, ""Sherri"" is a well-rounded, colorful program that effectively presents the challenges of modern-day living in an easily relatable, believable manner. Thankfully, the writers do not resort to fads or gimmicks to keep the show relevant to a particular audience. Each episode has a nice combination of humor and seriousnessalthough my favorite has to be ""Thanks-for-Not-for-Nothing-Giving""!

With a total of 13 episodes, we get a clear picture of the personality and priorities of Sherri and her friends and family. I believe that had this series continued, viewers would have gotten even more insight into the multi-dimensional framework of the characters' life stories. It's unfortunate that, for whatever reason, production stopped after only one season. Still, the short and sweet run of ""Sherri"" is one that I will continue to enjoy for its fun, intelligence, and well-rounded premise.",1397692800,,1194,5.489130434782608

4073563,1,B00366BBSU,"I wanted to enjoy this show because I used to be a fan of Sherri Shepherd on The View. She was funny, self-deprecating, and candid about her not-so-pure past. She once told a shocked Barbra Walters about her days spent in the slammer, while the audience sat there, loving her honesty.
I lost Sherri when she came out against gay marriage, using her faith as a shield against the belief that two men or two women can be happy and in love - just as two heterosexuals came. Sherri quotes the Bible as her reasoning and says that Jesus will eventually judge, but this self-righteousness doesn't appear to figure into her own checkered past. It's the very reason I think that people avoided this show. How can you laugh with someone when you know that she doesn't believe in your right to exist? Humor shouldn't be hateful.

My point is that I was unable to enjoy this show, despite trying to get through the pilot. I don't think any gay men or women can enjoy Sherri's humor knowing that at the end of the day she will vote against us. Vote against our rights, our love, and our very existence. As a comedian, Sherri Shepherd has lost my laugh and my love.",1355788800,,1152,4.433962264150943
4073564,5,B00366BBSU,"I love this sitcom. It's very chick flickish but still feel good and funny. She goes thru all the phases of one on the verge of a breakup...angry one minute,wanting him back the next etc. Did I mention I love it? :)",1311724800,4,215,4.142857142857143
4073565,4,B00366BBSU,I love love love this sitcom. She is a funny/silly/witty caring mom and full time paralegal. She goes through all the challenges that real people go through but manages to keep her sense of humor. Love it.,1311120000,2,205,4.5675675675675675
4073566,5,B00366BBSU,"I think Sherri is adorable and I loved her in this show. The struggle of a single working Mom, dealing with an ex-husband, his new baby with someone else, a crazy job, trying to be an actress and a new love interest all felt realistic to me and hit just as many great funny moments as it did the poignant ones. I think the supporting cast was first rate, and Elizabeth Regen reminded me of many of my NY BFF's. Maybe she didn't strike the right note with others but I think everyone was well cast and did an excellent job of supporting and enhancing the story. Catch episodes on Netflix and judge for yourself but this is a 5 star show for me!",1308614400,5,643,4.193548387096774
4073567,5,B00366BBSU,"I watched faithfully every week when the Sherri series  was on LifeTime and I simply loved it.  The Characters aren't just funny, we can relate to each one of them.  It's rare that we get to see good, clean, funny television.  I really regret that the show did not last beyond one season.",1300233600,4,288,4.377358490566038
4073568,5,B00366BBSU,"I don't know what it is with television?  When you have a really funny show and the viewership doesn't catch right on RIGHT away they cancel it.  Thank goodness for the Brass at NBC for sticking with Cheers whos first season needed to be desired as well as a littlew show called FRIENDS too.

The high archies of tv as well as cable should stick it out for more than just one season.  OMG how I do wish they had given Sheri another season too.

4073570,5,B00366BBSU,I love this tv comedy series. Sherie is funny and smart and a sassy office girl with her family life just as funny. Any woman would love this comedy. I can't wait till the season two comes out.,1280793600,3,193,4.105263157894737
4073571,5,B00366BBSU,"This is a very funny show although it was difficult to see ""Theo Huxtable"" cast as the bad guy.  You could not help but wish they could get back together but at the same time, you know he is getting more than he deserves.  Most women couldn't be that nice.  The only really horrible part was the way it ended.  I assume it was the last show of the season and haven't heard about there being anymore.  It left us with a cliff hanger and we want more!!!!!!",1276387200,4,454,4.113636363636363

I was more than excited when i found out Lifetime picked up her show and i couldn't wait for its premiere. Every episode cracked me up and before i knew it my family and i were watching it each week. Although the premise is cliche, the cast more than makes up for it with each person bringing something different to the table. I hope Lifetime picks it up for a second season and i recommend it to anyone, whether you can relate or not and if the show is renewed, please bring back Donna!!!!She was hysterical!

8389584,5,B00366BBSU,"Imagine my surprise!..I was really missing out on some great t.v.shows in the past because of a crazy work schedule and seeing this here Sherri show for like under 6 bucks, I took a chance and ordered it. Man, this is such a sweet and funny show with some great on-screen chemistry with it's actors! So very disappointed that it only ran for only just one season! Sherri should've never been cancelled and it should've ran at least 3 or 4 seasons.

But, I guess that's the sorry state of television today: wonderfully cool and heartfelt shows like Sherri get the axe quickly after only a few episodes but all this other disturbingly dark and overly sexual stuff just goes on and on for seasons. Then, the big and mighty t.v. executives sit and wonder why American families don't sit together and watch t.v. more often.
