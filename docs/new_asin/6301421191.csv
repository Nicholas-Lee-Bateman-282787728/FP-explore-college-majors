330603,5,6301421191,"Upbeat. Poignant. Humorous. The life of Christ is presented as if he had lived in modern-day Georgia instead of in ancient Galilee. For Christians, old familiar stories (that may have become all too familiar) take on new life. For non-Christians, this musical provides almost two hours of engaging and thought-provoking entertainment. Great songs with witty lyrics and memorable music. The five musician/actors in the cast give an outstanding performance. Truly worth watching!",1424217600,,477,5.638888888888889

330610,5,6301421191,"I loved this musical the first time I saw it and have grown in that love. Tom Key is a man of deep faith and he used it in service to God through this production. I love Harry Chapin's lyrics and music; the chorus behind Key is glorious. I've been singing the songs of late. Time to pray it again! Truly, a deeply spiritual and reverent telling of the story of Jesus.",1401494400,,367,4.111111111111111

330629,5,6301421191,"I saw the original production in NYC at a small theater off-Broadway, and this was videotaped at that venue with the original cast. I've watched this many times and always appreciate the musicianship, Tom Key's acting, and the Harry Chapin score. My one negative comment concerns the obligatory cutaways to the audience: the show itself is timeless and the music will always have a bluegrass/country/folk flavor the downhome acoustic crowd will enjoy...but the production is dated by the early 1980s dress and hairstyles. Nonetheless, that aside, this good-old-boy retelling of the Gospel is both inspiring and fun.",1396828800,,615,5.350515463917525
330630,5,6301421191,"If you haven't seen this DVD, give it a try. A wonderful telling of the good news through song and narrative. Harry Chapin music provides depth and rhythm to the message of the Gospel through the eyes of Clarence Jordan.",1396310400,,220,4.525

330633,5,6301421191,"This is the production of Cotton Patch Gospel, a musical drama that can be produced with minimal sets and a small or large cast.

330634,5,6301421191,"I guess you could call this a modern version of the story of the life of Jesus.  My talking about it just can't do it justice.
It's like watching a home town play and wanting to come back to see it again.  If you like blue grass kind of music at all this is full of wonderful talent and humor.  It pays the highest respect to the story of Jesus and leaves you with a good feeling.",1393632000,,380,3.909090909090909

330636,5,6301421191,"This adaptation of the gospel story is brilliant. It shows the true spirit of the story, but in a more modern setting. And combined with the music of Harry Chapin (who said that this music was what God had put him on this earth to accomplish), it is a dvd you will want to watch over and over. I buy copies just to give them away.",1385424000,,330,4.015151515151516

Being from the South, I love the music, all the characters portrayed so convincingly by Tom Key and, of course, the story, which holds true to the Bible.  I was so happy to find a copy in DVD format.  It assures me of many more years of enjoyment.",1375401600,,336,4.138461538461539

330660,5,6301421191,"I find myself singing the songs long after the dvd has ended.  The variety of music and the talent of the artists is incredible.

330661,3,6301421191,"While the music in this version of the play still delights, I saw the play in the small town of Hendersonville, NC, which was far more dynamic and entertaining that this rendition of the play.  We left the little theater on Main Street in Hendersonville uplifted and inspired by the wonderful message of the play, i.e., bringing the birth of Jesus to one's own town, whatever town that might be.  Somehow, the acting in this version of Cotton Patch Gospel seems flat and, except for the music itself, leaves a lot to be desired.",1372118400,,528,4.6063829787234045

330663,5,6301421191,"I watched this DVD at my Church before I bought my copy which I have not unwrapped yet.  I really enjoyed the whole show, It has bluegrass music, singing, jokes and gags, and a well told version of the Easter story, if not a bit cockeyed.  But it's religion, you will have to decided if you like it or not.",1370563200,,306,4.083333333333333

330665,5,6301421191,"Nice, respectful take on the Gospel story, with some outstanding music from Harry Chapin. Imagines the Life of Christ in more-or-less contemporary Dixie, and told in dialect! Judas becomes ""Jud""! Good wholesome entertainment.",1369180800,,225,5.848484848484849

330669,4,6301421191,"Tom Key's musical play based on the Cotton Patch Gospel by Clarence Jordan is fun. The minimalist setting allows Tom and his country quartet to imagine a world where Jesus did not come into the world 2000 years ago in Israel, but lived his life in rural Georgia in the middle part of the 20th century, with all of the civil unrest and injustices of the time. The musical score by the great Harry Chapin is imaginative and fun. I came for the music, but was happily surprised by the story telling.",1366243200,,496,4.4021739130434785

330672,4,6301421191,"We really enjoyed this DVD.  A very unique way to see the gospel.  We liked the singing group behind the main actor very much.
The DVD went blank at one point but didn't really ruin the show.  I think it was just poor camera skills.",1364256000,,232,4.111111111111111

330711,5,6301421191,Sometimes the best way to get at the meaning of a thing is to see it in an almost alient light. Tom Key and the rest of the cast blend southern gospel with 20th century version of the Gospel of Christ. It will make you laugh -- and cry. It will do you good.,1358553600,,257,3.7777777777777777
330712,5,6301421191,"If you know the CPG, then you know you love it. My family and I always have. My one complaint (if any) is that the DVD is still VHS-quality. It looks exactly the same as if I put my old worn tape copy in the VCR and played it. Perhaps I'm spoiled with my HD and blu-ray and 240hz etc but I had hoped they would dub to DVD in a better-looking format. Other than that though--it's the original that you're hoping for.

330714,5,6301421191,This is a really unique interesting drama presentation of Jesus in a modern day setting.  The music is awesome...kind of a bluegrass/souther gospel.,1356652800,,148,5.434782608695652
330715,5,6301421191,"Even though this musical was performed several years ago, like the message of Christ's life, it never grows old. The music is superb and the performances by the 5 actors/musicians is as fresh as Christmas and as somber and Easter.",1355875200,,230,4.775
330716,4,6301421191,This DVD is a very good way to reach people with the gospel message.

330718,5,6301421191,This is a great show about the story of Jesus and what it would sound like if it were based in the South (Georgia) instead of Israel. If you are from the South you will appreciate the humor. I saw this in person when I was young and it made the gospels easier to understand. It would be great for younger children ages (7 and up) I hope you enjoy it as much as my family did!,1352160000,,375,3.883116883116883
330746,5,6301421191,A very interesting accounting of the Gospel.  Easy to understand and enjoyable for all ages.  I used part of the video as a program for a women's group and they enjoyed it so much.  We'll view the remainder at a later time.,1348876800,,223,4.261904761904762

Music is well written, catchy melodies and solid and soul filled arrangements. I recommend it for any age group from about the 5th grade through seniors.

330751,5,6301421191,COTTON PATCH GOSPEL IS ONE OF MY VERY FAVORITES AND I WANTED AN EXTRA COPY.  IT ARRIVED IN GOOD TIME AND EXCELLENT CONDITION.  FIVE STAR SERVICE.  VERY SATISFIED.,1324771200,,162,4.714285714285714
330752,5,6301421191,"A few minor spoilers ahead.

I'm not a Christian, but I love the story of Jesus and have collected Jesus movies for decades.  This is my very favorite to date.  What sets this apart from the others, besides the wonderful humor and energy, is the ecstatic resurrection scene.  It's so unlike the solemn depictions in other movies.  Tom Key and the musicians capture the excitement and joy so perfectly.  One of my favorite lines:  ""He almost gave us cardiac arrest when he walked through--and I mean though--the door.""  And Jesus' first words to his disciples as he speaks from the mountaintop in Alabama make me cry every time I watch this.  They seemed to resonate with the audience too, judging from the outburst of applause.

Tom Key as amazing in this play.  The four musicians play some bit parts, but in many ways it's a one-man show, with Key playing Jesus, Judas (Jud), Matthew, Peter (Rock), Herod, Pilate, Joseph (Joe Davidson), Satan, Gabriel, and many other characters.  It's the same face, but it's not the same voice each time, and I find myself forgetting that it's the same face, as the expressions change.  I often feel I've seen a stage full of characters, and am a little startled to realize they were all one man.

The humor is delightful.  When Rock mistakes Jesus, walking on water, for ""the biggest duck I've ever seen"", when Jesus laments, as he changes water into wine, ""Here I am stuck playing bartender"", when Joe complains that the kids have gotten peanut butter on the steering wheel again, when Rock ""pulls in a big one"", I laugh and laugh.  As a teacher I especially enjoy Rock's reaction when he gets called on in class to answer ""Who do you say that I am?""  And it's the humor that makes the tragedy near the end so heart-wrenching.  But that's also what brings the resurrection to glorious, ecstatic life.

The music is wonderful too, full of energy and fun and pathos and beauty.  And the musicians are actors as well as musicians.  Their performance as disciples at the last supper is heartbreaking.  ""Go ahead and drink it boys, it will make him happy.""

My only complaint is a very small one.  Since the names of the other characters have been updated to fit into our modern world, it would have been nice if Jesus' had been too.  Joseph becomes Joe Davidson, Peter is Rock, Andrew is Andy, Judas is Jud, and so on.  I would have liked Jesus to become Josh, since Jesus was a very common name in his day, and Yeshua is the background name for Joshua.  But that's only a very minor suggestion.  Other than that, I thought the show was flawless.",1320624000,4,2581,4.576419213973799
330753,5,6301421191,"Harry Chapin's finest work was writing the songs for this rollicking musical introduction to the modern day gospel of Luke, telling of the birth of Jesus in the great state of Georgia.

Tom Key changes from one delightful character to another with ease. The quartet of musicians supporting him were brilliant on their instruments as well as fine actors, often comedic. ""Spitball Me, Lord, Over the Home Plate of Life"" is one funny song!)

You will laugh, cry, and gasp as you see the Gospel through new eyes. Enjoy! Share it with everyone who will sit and listen.",1319932800,,563,4.73469387755102

It is a great video.",1289001600,,334,4.583333333333333
330828,5,6301421191,"I recently received my copy of ""The Cotton Patch Gospel"" and I must say that I am thrilled.  I have never written a reveiw for anything before, but I believe that this video warrants my time and attention.
This is the Gospel story of Jesus Christ as told through the lens of the South.  This one-man (for the most part) performance offers the Gospel story in a new and interesting fashion.  The town names are familiar.  The dialect is familiar.  The music, well it's not familiar, but it sure is a true Southern comfort.
I would recomend this video for ages ranging from youth to adult and this would be a great launching pad from which to begin discussions on the Gospel story.  Also, I believe that this may be a valuable resource for helping Christians develop their own way to 'tell' the Gospel Story.

God Bless",1284940800,,817,4.517006802721088
330829,5,6301421191,Cotton Patch Gospel will make you laugh but at the same time brings the life and teachings of Jesus Christ to life.  It is a wonderful DVD and I will enjoy it for years to come.,1276732800,4,177,3.9166666666666665

The music is amazing, the lyrics gorgeous, and Tom Key is one of the most unbelievably phenomenal performers I have ever seen. With almost no props and the barest hint of costuming, he brings the characters and world to life. The same goes for the rest of the band, too. Amazing.",1258675200,,395,4.424657534246576
330831,5,6301421191,"I enjoyed this DVD. I must confess that I had taken a Bible study at a local church many years ago. The study was one of Phillip Yancy's and he had clips of this (at that time) video in it. It went well with the study. Seeing the entire movie is really cute and adds humor to what most people may not be able to put into context.
I will also have to add that my husband is a new Christian and found it to be not as enlightening as I did. He felt it was making fun of the birth of Christ.
From this I believe you need to have that happy medium place with your Christanantity. A yound christen or some one that belongs to a legalistic churh most likely will not enjoy this DVD. But any one who has been a christian for some time and is comfortabel with where they are in their belief in Christ will understand and enjoy this DVD. It is quite well made and a fun movie/skit to watch. I have to give a hands up to all  involved with this story. To be able to take the word from the Bible and  have the confidence to put it in this form and in the 80's area in the USA, in hopes that all would be able to understand our Saviors birth.",1238803200,2,1129,3.9043478260869566

I have used it sucessfully in Christian education programs with teens and adults. Often, looking at something from a different perspective is rewarding. I highly reccomend this program",1231113600,,449,5.0
330835,5,6301421191,"I have known about Clarence Jordan's sharp and witty Cottonpatch Gospels for years. They do more than translate the language; they translate centuries and the geography to put Jesus in twentieth century Georgia. Anyone who takes comfort from the King James Version ought to read Jordan's versions of the Gospels. They will make you distinctly uncomfortable, especially if you are a ""church person,"" or worse, a church leader. Those are the folks whom Jesus ""challenged"" during his ministry. As an Episcopal Priest, I am truly humbled by Jordan's Jesus who is not attacking Pharisees in first century Palestine, but the pastor and church board of ""First Church"" in Atlanta.

Baptist layman, Tom Key, has done a masterful job of translating Jordan's works to a one man show. He is aided in this effort by a very talented quartet of musicians who play and sing (along with Key, sometimes) the music the late Harry Chapin wrote for this show. Key goes beyond skewering the current religious establishment and their parishioners. He also works in lovely bits that expose the hypocrisy of TV Evangelists, Hellfire and Brimstone preachers, and ""Hot Gospel Quartets."" All is done with an enthusiastic and energized spirit of fun that has the audience ""good church folks"" attending this filming of the show laughing their heads off. Yet when it is time to get serious, Jesus' good bye to his disciples at the last supper will bring tears to your eyes and his prayers in the Garden of Gethsemane will fill your heart with terror. All of this is made possible by the prodigious talents of Tom Key, who can make you laugh, make you cry, make you scared, and make you think. Given the enthusiasm he brings to the stage, you wonder how he found the energy to do just one of these shows, not to mention doing them once or even sometimes twice a day.

The peformance was filmed in front of an audience--there are no retakes or touch up edits. If there is any quibble with The Cotton Patch Gospel  is the billing that says the play is based on Jordan's version of Matthew and John. If that is true, someone slipped the parable of the Good Samaritan, which appears only in Luke, into one of those gospels without telling us. As an ordained person, I would recommend The Cotton Patch Gospel to anyone--Christian or non-Christian.",1203552000,17,2310,4.77

330980,5,6301421191,Tom Key and his friends have produced a version of the life of Jesus on Earth that I found unbelievable the first time I watched it.  There are 5 talented guys with their musical instruments and a wooden table and chair on a bare stage in what looks to be a barn.  There is nothing fancy in the mix but the story is told with feeling and a reality that I think I have never seen before. In this video you can laugh and cry while you enjoy original toe-tapping music and a new bent on the old story-Jesus-the saviour of the world being born in Gainesville Georgia!  This whimsicle version of the Gospel is also very believable and very touching.  Watch it and then just try to put it back in the cupboard,1180656000,,703,4.223880597014926

330983,5,6301421191,"As a Southern Baptist fundamentalist, I don't generally like people fooling around with the Gospel - I'm a KJV-only kind of guy - but I think Cotton Patch Gospel is just fantastic.  It moves the story of Jesus from Israel to the American South and retells the story in the Southern vernacular, but it still tells the Gospel story - and it does so in an immensely entertaining, surprisingly powerful way.  The roots of this musical really extend back to man named Clarence Jordan, a Georgia native and social activist who translated the Gospels of Matthew and John into the Southern vernacular as a means to extend the reach of the Gospel story.  Later, Tom Key (who stars in this production) wrote a play based on Jordan's Cotton Patch Gospels, and then Harry Chapin supplied the music that turned the play into a full-blown off-Broadway musical.

The story follows Jesus from his birth in an abandoned trailer in Valdosta to his lynching in Atlanta, resurrection, and ascension.  Mary becomes Mary Hagler, Joseph Joe Davidson, while the disciples include Rock, Tad, Andy, etc. - and Judd.  At twelve, Jesus stays behind to discuss the Lord with leaders of the Baptist Sunday School Conference in Atlanta.  He's baptized by John the Baptizer in the Chattahoochee River, he gives his Sermon on the Mount on Stone Mountain, and his appointed hour comes not during Passover but during the Believe in the Bible Society Convention in Atlanta.  His teachings reinforce the Gospel message, and, in this updated form, prove especially relevant to the social and cultural problems of our own time - including racism.  Tom Key has emphasized the fact that he wanted to show audiences just how radical Jesus' message was - and I think he succeeds wonderfully.  The show strips bare the glitzy, too-often selfish faade of televangelism, challenges believers to refocus and make sure they are living truly Christian lives, and reminds us that we should never let ourselves become complacent but should remain permanently excited about Jesus and His great love and sacrifice for us.

And it's funny.  I daresay even atheists would enjoy this show despite its message.  There are numerous jokes and funny lines along with plenty of fun, toe-tapping, hand-clapping songs from the musicians.  The music is mostly bluegrass, but you don't have to like bluegrass in order to enjoy yourself here, especially since several of the songs feature entertaining lyrics.  Christians should be the happiest people on Earth, and Cotton Patch Gospel truly does make joyful sounds unto the Lord.

This production is really a tour de force by Tom Key.  While four talented musicians play a part and furnish a number of songs, it's really a one-man show by Key, as he portrays a whole cast of characters: Jesus, the disciples, John the Baptizer, angels, Judd, Dr. Caiaphas, Governors Herod and Pilate, and others.  Besides the musician's instruments (two guitars, a banjo, and a bass fiddle), the props consist of little more than a table and chair.  This is a stage production of the show before a live and very appreciative audience - simple and spare for the most part, it also features some really effective camera angles that add wonderfully subtle power to the whole performance.  Key is a consummate actor with incredible range.  The power of Jesus' sacrifice and the terrible events surrounding his death are delivered with great emotional depth, and that's when you really know that this entertaining performer is truly a great actor.  Key truly brings the Cotton Patch Gospel to life.

It does help to have some familiarity with the Gospel, but this show is really for anyone and everyone.  It's apparently as popular in the North as it is here in the South, and I would let my fellow proud Southerners know that the play is in no way condescending to Southerners.  Cotton Patch Gospel is a video you will want to watch time and time again.",1126915200,16,3917,4.907435508345979
330984,5,6301421191,"This is a marvelous work in every area of attempted endeavor: the music is rich, the jokes are humorous without detracting from the emotional impact of the performance, and the presentation of the core elements of Christian faith as presented in the gospel of Matthew are reasonably accurate and incredibly accessible.
It's simplicity can be deceptive: it may be tempting to write this presentation off as overly simplifying the message or the content of the Cotton Patch sermons, but repeated viewings reveals that the simplicity results not from a lack of depth, but rather from focus and clarity. This work feels like a heartfelt attempt to communicate the richness and joys of Christian faith, and it does so wonderfully.
Despite the age of the show, the jokes still feel relevent and fresh, the fools it pokes fun at familiar, 20 years later. The humor is a well presented moral admonition: while it's easy to laugh when we recognize the character who resembles someone we know, the presentation is so frank and gentle that one often sees the fool in oneself: the best accomplishment a satire can claim.
The music is simply wonderful. The performers are accomplished musicians (incidentally, this group is STILL on tour with this show), the lyrics alternately witty and poignant, and the melodies are memorable and beautiful. This is what folk/old country is meant to be: musical communication.
This is not a film to rent, or to see once then pass along (although it is certainly worth sharing). While the first viewing may be sentimental and amusing, the potence of the message grows each time it is viewed. Much like reading scripture, I come away with a new insight each time I watch it.",1050537600,29,1695,4.909407665505227
330985,1,6301421191,"This version of Clarence Jordan's adaptations of the Gospel
stories is weak, lacking in the depth of the social gospel
message which Clarence provided to an earlier generation of
prejudiced Americans who so easily accepted a civil religion that
glossed over the tyranny and oppression which still are at the
heart of our culture. Nothing has changed. The gloss is just a
bit shinier and phonier.  The bozos who sing and act in the back-
ground make the quality comparable to a low budget 3 Stooges
Comedy. The story teller is right out of the local Bible Book
Store which sells nothing to make you upset about the status quo.
  The movie made me angry.  This is not what Clarence would have wanted for his legacy.
