I was disappointed I did not get the price I was to pay in my own currency :-( so when I got the bill after it was processed it was in American dollars not Australian dollars which turned out to be more.",1397520000,,238,3.9791666666666665
8497340,4,B006G28MXS,"I'm not a fluent Italian speaker, but I want to teach my son the language.  I've bought everything - Muzzy, Little Pim, Professor Toto, Dino Lingo, etc.  This set of DVDs is just as good a system as the others.  My son loves the ""monkey on the motorcycle"" (as he calls it) and asks to watch the Farm DVD pretty frequently.  A lot of vocabulary is introduced in an understandable way in each DVD.  The format is almost exactly like that of the Little Pim series; the only difference is that Early Lingo introduces slightly broader vocabulary.  I gave this product 4 stars only because, in my opinion, there wasn't enough conversation on the DVDs to teach my son sentence structure, grammar, intonation, etc.  There were simple sentences introduced, but I would have liked to see more use of the new vocabulary in a conversation between the two characters.  But otherwise, great product.  I will probably buy DVDs 7-12 when they come out.",1359417600,7,936,4.693251533742331
