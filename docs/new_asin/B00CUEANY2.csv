8586539,5,B00CUEANY2,"I agree with another reviewer who feels Hershel House is one of the greatest builders of these muzzleloading rifles.  I think he is actually much more and probably (at least in the community that follows his work) is somewhat of a ""Rock Star"" for his work on not only these rifles, but a whole host of other ""Folk Art"" items that anyone would admire.  He even is known for being the catalyst behind an entire school or style of rifle that is immediately recognizable.  largely because the style or art behind them is so timeless.  House is also a great American who literally was born on the Fourth of July.

An article on the Contemporary Makers web page describes Hershel this way:

""Hershel Carmen House was born July 4, 1941 and needs no introduction to these pages. His work has been nationally known for the better part of four decades. Hershel and his younger brothers Frank and John are the progenitors of what is known as the Woodbury School in todays contemporary longrifle society. Named for the small Kentucky town on the banks of the Green river in which they grew up. Products made by this family ingenuously express their personalities, exhibit varied artistic talents, and reveal a genuine way of life that has significantly influenced many aspects and countless members of todays contemporary longrifle culture.""

Now, this video is all Hershel.  I have a close friend who has absolutely no interest in building these Kentucky rifles, their history or really much of anything else related to this longrifle culture, but she really enjoyed this video.  I think it was Hershel House's personality and ability to explain each step as he was building his rifles.  Also included are some quaint and quirky sections where you get to see everything from his puppy to a wild squirrel that hangs out in his shop.  Just more of House's personality.

Then there are his tools.  I'm probably a middle level tool aficionado and tend to get some nicer tools for my own use.  In fact, I honestly have too many tools for what I produce with them.  House is the antithesis of this.  His tools make me think of rust, relics, antiquity, getting by and even getting my tetanus shot updated.  My friend thought we should take up a collection to get this guy some real nice tools.  Yet Hershel House uses his simple, down-home tools to build some incredible folk art.

I have an older set of these videos so it's possible (but not likely or even necessary) that there have been some changes over time.  The booklet that was included with the videos wasn't anything too special but it does give the outlines of the rifle that was built.

I have Kentucky Rifle Building videos that were done by all of the better known builders and Hershel House is the very best, the most watchable and enjoyable, and in a unique class of his own without peer.",1443225600,6,2837,4.679435483870968
