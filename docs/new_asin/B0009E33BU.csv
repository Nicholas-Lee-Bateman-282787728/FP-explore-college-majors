8059574,5,B0009E33BU,Paw Prints of Thieves is the story of Robin Hood while Hot Diggety Dawg is Journey to the center of the earth. The quality of the DVD's isn't that great on my 60-inch HD tv (a little fuzzy) but definitely not awful and very watchable. I wish they would release the other episodes on DVD as well! I love Wishbone and it was fantastic to hear the theme song once more and regress back into my childhood!,1251244800,,401,4.220779220779221
8059575,5,B0009E33BU,"The Impawssible Dream

This episode is based on the book Don Quixote. (By Miguel De Cervantes)

Well the story is about a man named Don Quixote who goes on imaginary adventures with his companion Sancho Panza (played by Wishbone) but will Don Quixote realize these are ""Impawssible dreams."" Back in reality Joe is attempting to make it into the Encyclopedia of World Records for basketball free throws. But someone else wants to make the world record too. Will he beat the record? well go ahead and get this episode and you'll find out.

Man I love this episode I was cracking up at Wishbone's eeerrr... Sancho Panza's wisecracks and I like the story in Oakdale since I like basketball. So you got to get this episode or you're missing out big time!

The Hunchdog of Notre Dame

Hunchback of Notre Dame (written by Victor Hugo) in this episode is changed just slightly to Hunchdog of Notre Dame of course because Wishbone plays the character Quasimodo. Quasimodo gets involved with a life-and-death struggle with his evil master Frollo. Back to reality, during a hockey game Wishbone sees a clumsy boy named Nathaniel who's trying to keep up with the other kids only to be humiliated by the other players. So can Quasimodo defeat Frollo and save the life of a Gypsy woman and will Nathaniel find his skill in hockey? The only way to find out is to watch this great episode.

Finally we get some episodes of Wishbone on DVD. (Too bad there are only four episodes on DVD overall!)Since there are such a little amount of episodes you can get on DVD these are must haves for any Wishbone fan.",1250121600,,1588,4.633451957295374
8059576,5,B0009E33BU,My students loved this interpretation of classic literature.  The format is enchanting and delightful!  Wishbone is a wonderful edition to any parent or teacher's video library.,1246924800,,177,5.769230769230769
8059577,5,B0009E33BU,Was like having this wonderful show back for my viewing pleasure.  My duaghter loves it.,1193443200,,88,4.866666666666666
8059578,5,B0009E33BU,"I watched WIshbone when it was ""Fresh"" 10 - 12 years ago.  I have a few of the videos and the kids (9 & 6) love him as well.  I was glad to see that I could expand the collection a bit since the kids enjoy his stories.  Heck--- I still enjoy them.

The creativity they use to parallel what is going on with Joe and his friends to the literary classics is great. The books these are based on are _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_ with Wishbone as Quasimodo and _Don Quixote_, where Wishbone is the ever-faithful Sancho Panza.  The stories are easy for the kids to follow, and at the end they show how the show was made---how they created the special effects and so on.

Will these videos entice the kids to read these classics as they get a bit older, only time will tell, but it has given them a base of reference.

The downside is it has been harder to find Wishbone videos since he has been off the air for a while.  Too bad.",1179014400,2,923,4.088888888888889
8059579,5,B0009E33BU,"The Wishbone show was such a wonerful way to introduce kids to classic books.  The way the storyline of the cute dog and his family are woven in with the classic story is so very clever.  Seeing the shows has sparked interest in my kids to open the books and read them.  When she was 4 until the show ended, this was my daughter's very favorite show.  It was one that I was actually happy to have her watch.

I was so very sorry when this show went off the air.  However, I am thrilled to now be able to purchase some of these wonderful shows.  I highly recommend this for the entire family.",1175644800,2,591,4.131578947368421
8059580,5,B0009E33BU,"""Wishbone"" is the name of a terrier that lives with his human family, a boy named Joe and Joe's widowed mother, Ellen, who is a librarian. This excellent series follows the adventures of Wishbone, Joe, and Ellen in their daily lives and illustrates the relevance of classic literature to pre-teens. As Joe faces a challenge at school or with a friend, Wishbone ""dreams"" of a similar situation faced by a character in a great novel, and often points the way to the solving of Joe's dilemma. This wonderful series destroys the ridiculous theory all-too-prevalent in academia that today's  children can't relate to works of fiction that may be centuries old. In each 30-minute episode, ""Wishbone"" introduces works of Shakespeare, Mark Twain, Homer, and many others, in ways both imaginative and humorous. Children will be fascinated, and I am sure many who viewed this series went on to read the books presented here. I am glad this series is being released on DVD. Every single episode is blessed with great scripts, and high production values; and Wishbone's period costumes must be seen to be believed!! Highly recommended!",1149379200,15,1123,5.037634408602151
8059581,5,B0009E33BU,"I loved this show when it aired on public broadcasting and miss it. What's NOT to like?  A classic novel told with the cutest darn dog in the lead. This show needs to come back on the air, but in the meantime, these DVD's are terrific and fun.",1140393600,7,243,4.0625
8059582,5,B0009E33BU,"You would not think that a children's show would be fun to watch for an adult but Wishbone just makes you laugh.  It really gives a fine decription of the story but also entertains you to the end.  With the amount of garbage in children shows, it's a blessing to find a program that is of value to children and adults.",1138579200,4,318,4.19672131147541
