1573250,5,B00005JOKL,"I have been patiently waiting for this series to come out on DVD. When it aired, it was totally without peer as one of the funniest TV dramas ever. I never knew John Ritter had this superb serious side to his acting. He was one of those very rare talents that could shift back and forth from comedy to drama to comedy again and make it all appear so effortless. Ritter shares this ability with a very small contingent of actors over the past century, perhaps the best-known being Cary Grant. I happened to watch ""The Tonight Show"" the night after an episode involved Ritter being kidnapped and shackled by a guy who told him he was the Devil. I thought it was one of the finest half-hour episodes ever to appear on TV. But Johnny Carson went out of his way to report to the audience that the previous night more than half the viewing audience of that episode ""tuned-out"" when they heard the one actor say he was the Devil. This immediately told me how right I was about the quality of this show. That episode, and this TV series, overall, was the high-water mark in television series production for that entire decade. This series deserves to be released on DVD, not just for all of the lucky TV fans like myself who realized the series enriched our lives, but for the millions of TV viewers who WILL become the cult fans of this series as word spreads that it is now available on DVD. We deserve to have that calibre of entertainment back in our lives again. God knows, there is nothing on commercial TV of the past decade that is enriching anyone's life today. ""Hooperman"", ""The Texas Wheelers"" and ""Grand"" are 3 series that were never allowed a descent enough time to find their audiences. And this country is definitely the worse off for it.",1427241600,4,1745,4.4733542319749215
1573251,5,B00005JOKL,"This series combined humor with a lot of human stories of life, which I liked very much.

The series consisted of 42 episodes and was directed by 1987 and 1989. It's about the cops harry Hooperman played by john knight (died 2003) and his work with colleagues. He inherits a house and have to deal after his work as a policeman with the tenants of the house and their complaints. A sequence has a length-minutes of 30.

I hope that this great series will soon be released on DVD",1363910400,2,478,4.359550561797753
1573252,5,B00005JOKL,"John Ritter played Detective Hooperman, a serious but sensitive detective. The cast jelled very early in the series. It was really too bad that the series did not run longer. The interplay between the characters with the backdrop of police business was excellent. This drama/comedy was cut short before its full potential was reached. I hope it is produced in DVDs.",1310860800,4,365,5.0
1573253,5,B00005JOKL,"This was an awesome show.  I don't think it lasted very long, though, but it should have.  I really hope they put it on DVD.  I would definitely like to see it again.",1264291200,4,166,3.9696969696969697
1573254,4,B00005JOKL,"Hooperman was a departure role for John Ritter, very different from Three's Company and it seemed that people were reluctant to let him try a more dramatic turn as a darker character with flaws. If you are looking for Jack Tripper then this is not the series for you. However, if you enjoyed John Ritter the actor; you might want to check out this series if it becomes available.  His role here was much more in keeping with his son's dramatic turn on Joan of Arcadia.  Debrah Farentino was all over television in the late 80s/early 90s though none of her excellent series were ever successful television hits and it is nice to now see her (when she's on) in Eureka.",1187827200,12,666,4.4958677685950414

7941933,3,B00005JOKL,"I'm glad that this series was finally released on DVD after nearly 30 years.  I recall this show as one of the best shows on TV in the late 1980s.  Perhaps my memory is accurate, but perhaps shows in the late 1980s weren't very good compared to the present day.  The show doesn't even hold up very well when compared to near-contemporary Bochco police procedurals such as Hill Street Blues and NYPD Blue.  John Ritter's dramatic acting skills had not yet developed, and the scripts seem cliched and full of plot holes.  Trying to produce a police procedural in self-contained, 22-minute episodes probably wasn't a great idea, especially when at least half the show is devoted to the protagonist's personal life.  On the other hand, Bijou is as charming as I remember.

Technically, the DVDs are okay.  Some of the episodes are out of order on the Season 1 DVDs, and there are serious sound problems in the pilot episode.",1519603200,,920,4.70625

7941935,2,B00005JOKL,"Fail to launch. The cast and crew just never get it together. Writing is all over the place. Some episodes have several plot starts but only one actually finishes. I like Ritter, he was a nice man and good actor, I wish he had a better platform and better support. There are three major cop shows set in San Francisco. The best was Nash Bridges. The over the top, too intense is The Streets of San Francisco and then there is Hooperman. If you like the location of San Francisco and enjoy a crime format buy Nash Bridges.",1492819200,,521,4.326530612244898
