2768959,5,B000NIBUZ8,"Sabata is a great spaghetti western.  If you are into this genre of way over-the-top, violent, non-traditional westerns, then this is a great film.  It has a great story and the visual quality is very good (i.e. not grainy and cheap looking).  The acting is also very good.  I respectfully disagree with previous reviewers about the quality of the film... the sound sync issue isn't as bad as they make it out to be, and isn't worth missing this one.  Yes, there are a few bad moments with sound sync, but not enough to ruin the film or make it unwatchable.  Keep in mind, this is the norm for spaghetti westerns, they employed actors that spoke their lines in other languages and then were dubbed over later.  Compared to some of the other lesser known spaghetti westerns that you buy on DVD, this one is high quality.  I'm glad I have this film as part of my collection, and am happy I bought it.",1275696000,11,898,4.432926829268292
2768960,3,B000NIBUZ8,"Well, I bought this hoping for a performance like the one in ""For A Few Dollars More"", but didn't get it. At times this movie is silly, when you are expecting it to be something better. I won't be buying any of the other Sabata movies, as this was supposed to be the best one. I was disappointed.",1241481600,6,296,4.120689655172414
2768961,3,B000NIBUZ8,"Sabata is a great adition to the Italian Western genre: the characters are well rounded, the plot is involving, the music is cool and, above all, it stars Lee Van Cleef and William Berger.

There are no extras, only a set of trailers for other westerns (Italian and otherwise). Sabata is a sadly neglected film which I think could do with a special edition.

At least it's uncut.",1190764800,8,379,4.5588235294117645
2768962,4,B000NIBUZ8,"This review is for Sabata on DVD and not Sabata on Blu Ray.  I have not seen the Blu Ray version but I understand that the sound-synch problems have been fixed and the video and sound quality are improved on Blu Ray.

Sabata is one of the very best Spaghetti Westerns. Unfortunately MGMs american version of this DVD is marred by a terrible sound-sink problem throughout most of the middle of the film. And I do not mean bad dubbing! Sabata was filmed with the actors speaking entirely in English so the sound should be perfect. The sound becomes and stays so out of sink that voices and all sound effects (footsteps, slaps, gun shots etc.) are noticeably off by about a whole two seconds. There is one scene where Sharky's mother is slapping him. The slap sounds occur every time she pulls her hand back. Characters continue to move their mouths long after their voices have stopped. This completely mars one of the greatest spaghetti westerns of all time and the very best of the three Sabata films! This is a problem with the MGM/Sony DVD pressing not with the original film.

Sabata is otherwise an excellent combination of western action, acrobats, fancy gadgets, humor, good music and clever camera work. The acting by Lee Van Cleef and the rest of the cast is top notch.

Van Cleef, a great character actor has incredible presence yet never upstages the other actors giving the cast an ensemble feeling rather then a one man show.

The clever editing, fluid camera work, and color photography in Sabata is super. The film is extremely stylish and purposely tongue in cheek, highly entertaining, imaginative, and funny.

The plot - A trio of city-big-wigs attempt to empty the bank. Sabata finds out and blackmails the buch. The trio sends more and more bad guys to dispatch Sabata (Blazing Saddles Style). With each attempt the henchmen are bumped-off (in increasingly funny and imaginative ways). After each attempt Sabata ups the anti. This continues until all hell breaks loose in a wonderfully filmed Indiana Jones style shootout.

Roger Greenspun of the New York Times accurately describes the film in his review: ""As heroic fiction, it is stronger on colorful success than on noble character, but it is so energetic and at the same time so tactful about its achievements that I find it impossible not to credit most of its ideas at face value-and sometimes a little more... Sabata (Lee Van Cleef) is a black-cloaked mysterious stranger, with looks of Judex and the manner of Fearless Fosdick...Sabata is one of those rarities (even among mysterious strangers) who absolutely never makes mistakes, never is surprised, and always wins, usually by superior fire power, even when their enemies number an army. He is assisted (not that he needs it) by a Mexican ne'er-do-well (Pedro Sanchez) and an acrobatic Indian (Nick Jordan) whose leaps and somersaults wonderfully extend the meticulous agility that is central to Sabata's enterprise and to the film's style...style must be very nearly an article of faith with (director) Frank Kramer (his real name is Gianfranco Parolini) whose graceful camera performs elegant arabesques above the simplicities of a plot for which he is also partially responsible. ""Sabata"" keeps throwing out almost gratuitous pleasures in movement and design-like the lovely Mario Bava adventure films-and for this enterprising prodigality Kramer deserves praise. So do the cast members""
We have waited a long time for Sabata to come out on DVD. The sound problem on Sabata is terribly disappointing. I would have given this 5 stars if not for the sound problem.

Note - The new Blu Ray version and MGMs European PAL regon 2 version of Sabata has the sound in perfect sink with the film throughout.
Its great - 5 stars!",1186963200,14,3753,4.917851500789889
2768966,3,B000NIBUZ8,"It's got a great music score and some nice shots, but it's so absurd that it's not to be taken seriously.  Sabata and his three pals taken on fifty men and come out okay?  Yeah, you'll like it as a kid but as an adult it really is just average.",1428278400,,244,3.86

2768968,4,B000NIBUZ8,"I love spaghetti westerns, more than American ones , and I live in New Mexico. The Italian versions have a sense of magic and in some case whimsy and humor, American counterparts lack. Sabbath has all of that plus a good plot and the great Lee Van Cleef. The story isn't complex gold, outlaws etc. but is told in a manner that catches you up in the flow. Haven't seen the other ""Sabata films, but this one is a bulls eye.",1416096000,,421,4.209876543209877

2768970,1,B000NIBUZ8,"Let's face it: Sometimes a movie is simply less than the sum of its parts; Trying to recreate a formula for the spaghetti western doesn't always work, even if the director has convinced himself he's Sergio Leone.

No matter that the director over-dubs the speaking roles for most of the cast; no matter that Lee Van Cleef revives the man-with-no-name motif for this film; no matter that ambiguous morality punctuates this film, it simply doesn't work. It's a confusing hodge-podge of loosely related plot lines that more often than not do not resolve themselves.

Trying to recreate the role of Tuco fails miserably, as well. It is, quite frankly, an insult to Eli Wallach to think that you can substitute one ethnic minority for another, tailor him so closely (but ineptly) to the original, and hope people won't know the difference.

And what's up with the acrobat jumping from one trampoline to another throughout the film? Are we to believe that the ground itself is so elastic that anybody can simply leapfrog from one place to another because he's called ""Alleycat""? There were more than a few moments in this film that made me wish that magic-realism wasn't taking over...

As a western, though, it functions well enough to satisfy the viewer, though an intelligent film goer will be continuously distracted by the badly enacted send-ups to the master of this genre.

Lee Van Cleef could have done so much more with this role, but sadly he was tethered to a weak script and imbecilic story lines.  I suppose this is the kind of film you could stomach if you were confined to a hospital bed for a number of days, but it will ultimately leave you wishing family members would show up with a lap-top and a subscription to Netflix.",1409011200,3,1734,4.744186046511628
2768971,4,B000NIBUZ8,"Kino Lorber Video has licensed the MGM library of titles to the Blu-Ray format that were released previously on DVD over a decade ago.  Here we have Director Gianfranco Parolini 's aka Frank Kramer's brilliantly entertaining 'SABATA aka 'EHI, AMICO...C' E SABATA, HAI CHIUSO'-1969, the first of a supposed trilogy featuring Lee Van Cleef in the title role (although the character is not mentioned by name in the film).  Released in 2005 in a 3 disc DVD set by MGM entitled the 'SABATA' trilogy , the transfer to the Blu-Ray format is outstanding.  The colors are richer, the photography by Sandro Mancori is finally appreciated in 1080P 2.35 wide screen making the images sharper, clearer and eye-popping, and the music score by Marcello Giombini stands out rather than being stifled in the background as in the past. The film highlights the Euro Westerns best eccentric character actors:  William Berger as Banjo, the only one who can out shoot Sabata more or less; Franco Ressel giving his best performance of villainy personified; the beautiful Linda Veras balancing both heroes between her fingers;  Luciano Pigozzi here billed as Alan Collins showing why he was known as the Italian Peter Lorre; and Robert Hundar among others.  Coming off his excellent oater 'SARTANA aka 'IF YOU MEET SARTANA, PREY FOR YOUR DEATH' aka 'SE INCONTRI SARTANA PREGA PER LA TUA MORTE'1968 , Parolini brings a cartoonish atmosphere to the proceeding but never going over the top as he does in the 1972 sequel 'RETURN OF SABATA' aka 'E TORNATO SABATA, HAI CHIUSO UN ALTRA VOLTA' where he brings in James Bondish gadgetry to the proceedings. He was no stranger to that format having introduced and directed the first of the Sixties Kommissar X spy series 'KISS KISS, KILL KILL ' aka '12 DONNE D'ORO-1965 featuring Tony Kendall and Brad Harris as the Sabata/Banjo dynamic duo.  The third film 'ADIOS,SABATA'aka 'INDIO BLACK, SAI CHE TI DICO...SEI UN GRAN FIGLIO DI SABATA'-1970 was formed around star Yul Brynner who is far from the Sabata we know but the title was changed to highlight the Sabata character after the international success of the Lee Van Cleef opus.  The shootout/twist ending rounds out the mix giving Van Cleef and Berger a chance to shine in the genre. Kino releases the film in a no frills package with just an original trailer its only extra.  Not the best of the Spaghetti Westerns , it emerges as an entertaining diversion in the canon and the Blu-Ray format suits it just fine.",1406332800,9,2483,4.878859857482185

8177826,3,B000NIBUZ8,"RELEASED IN 1969 and directed by Gianfranco Parolini, Sabata chronicles events in a west Texas town when a black-clad gunfighter named Sabata (Lee Van Cleef) teams-up with an alcoholic ex-soldier named Carrincha (Ignazio Spalla) and an acrobatic Indian (Bruno Ukmar) to thwart the town leaders (Antonio Gradoli  & Gianni Rizzo) who want to steal $100,000 from their own bank to purchase land that the encroaching railroad will cross. William Berger plays a minstrel of dubious loyalties while Franco Ressel is on hand as the effeminate heavy. Linda Veras appears as the stock saloon babe.

This was the first of the official Sabata trilogy released in 1969-1971. There were four other Sabata films released in 1970-1972, but they were considered unofficial imitations. The only other Sabata flick Ive seen is the third imitation one, ""Dig Your Grave, Friend... Sabata's Coming, with Raf Baldassarre in the eponymous role. While that one lacked Van Cleef, the story is more compelling than this debut.

Sabata starts promisingly enough with a colorful cast of characters and an innovative bank robbery, but the story bogs down in the second act and tries to make up for it with an action-packed climax and typical Italo Western epilogue (think The Good, the Bad and the Ugly). Speaking of which, Sabata is reminiscent of Sergio Leones Dollars trilogy. Van Cleef simply takes over the Eastwood role while Spalla is basically a re-dressed Tuco.

Thankfully, there are original elements, like the acrobatic Native and the effeminate kingpin. Still, as with most Spaghetti Westerns, the characters are cardboard-thin caricatures rather than three-dimensional people, which limits their appeal and prevents the story from having much suspense. The usual goofy absurdities don't help.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 51 minutes and was shot in Almera, Spain and (studio) Rome. WRITERS: Parolini and Renato Izzo.

8177827,4,B000NIBUZ8,"I had watched the first two movies starring Lee Van Cleef at the drive-in theaters (when they were still around).  He did quite well in those spaghetti westerns as did Clint Eastwood.  The only difference between the two actors was that the Van Cleef seem to star in those films that truly stretched the imagination as to the weaponry and the situation he and his compadres always found themselves.  But don't let this distract you.  If you want to watch a really entertaining western that goes beyond what is expected, then this one is for you!",1505347200,,545,4.645833333333333
