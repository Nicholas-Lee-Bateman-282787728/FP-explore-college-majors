2688990,5,B000KF0WKI,"As a father of three children in elementary school, we love this video.  It is hard to find a video that all of my kids agree on watching.  Plus, to know the ABC's in sign language allow your children to tell you anything.  It also makes them better spellers in school because they like to figure out how to spell the word in sign language.

We started teaching our children some basic signs when they were babies.  It creates another way to connect with your children.  We love using this video to continue building their singing skills.",1163980800,,538,4.494845360824742
2688991,5,B000KF0WKI,"My nephews (5 and 8) loved the first Sign-a-lot DVD, The Big Surprise, and I have to say this one is just as big a hit!  They love the animation (the robots make us laugh every time!) and really have fun ""interacting"" with the kids on the screen.  We had some of the neighbor kids over ranging in age from 3-8 and it was amazing to see them all signing along and yelling out the answers.  They were even fingerspelling which was great b/c my older nephew hates to do his spelling words--maybe fingerspelling will turn that around for him.  I couldn't believe that we had learned more than 100 signs while having so much fun.  We definitely recommend Signalot!!",1163548800,,660,4.466666666666667
2688992,5,B000KF0WKI,"this is the best sign dvd i have watched.  my 25 month old daughter has learned her alphabet from it.  it is her favorite dvd and she asks for it by name.  i am buying the big surprise next.

2688993,5,B000KF0WKI,"After watching this video only once, my son, who has been diagnosed with Behavioral Issues and SI Dysfunction, learned 10 new signs.  He was able to use them and recall them the day of, and even now, two weeks after previewing the video.  This video, and its companion, are a Godsend.",1177027200,3,284,4.549019607843137
2688994,5,B000KF0WKI,"As a sign language instructor, this video as well as ""Sign-a-lot,The Big Surprise"" are by far the biggest hits of my class. Perfect for younger and older children.  Offering a ""story line"" that attracts older children and easy to understand signs that engage all children, I highly support the use of this video in your classroom.  I can't wait for more, the children just love watching them (more so than any other video that I have shown.)

2688995,5,B000KF0WKI,"I think this is a GREAT DVD.  I have two boys, ages 5 & 8 and both of them really enjoy watching it.  They have already memorized many of the signs on the DVD.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in having their child learn sign language.",1171324800,,245,4.0625
2688996,5,B000KF0WKI,"I want to highly recommend the sign-a-lot signing videos.  My daughter is speech delayed and she loves these videos!  They have helped tremendously in our communication, along with her other signs. She picked up the signs very quickly and have learned all of them.  She wanted to watch them over and over again!  Please pass this information on to friends and family so they can spread the word!  Excellent Choice!  I will be purchasing more dvd's for family members!",1170979200,3,467,4.848101265822785
2688997,5,B000KF0WKI,"Our five year old daughter loves Sing-a-Lot, ABC even more than the first. She watches with rapt attention and sings, signs and dances along.  She is taught sign in school as a core part of the learning process and it helps her grasp meaning. Sign-a-lot helps entertain her and helps her learn new ways to present her ideas.  She is always demonstrating new sign's she has learned. We highly recommend it to all our friends with young children.",1170979200,,444,4.67948717948718
2688998,5,B000KF0WKI,"My 3 children love ""The Big Surprise"", so it is no surprise that they love ""ABC Games"" just as much. They talk about the See me Sign kids as if they were friends in the neighborhood and I can't believe how they have all embraced fingerspelling. They love to play the ABC game from the DVD and are constantly asking for me to give them words to fingerspell. I can recommend this series as a parent and an educator.  I have also taken the Sign-A-Lot DVDs into my preschool classes and my preschoolers LOVE both DVDs. For any parent or educator interested in having thier children not only learn American Sign Language, but also want them to love to sign, this is the sign language dvd series for you!",1168128000,2,698,4.410852713178294
2688999,5,B000KF0WKI,"My two children, ages 8 and 3, love this video. My eight year old has started practicing her spelling words using the sign language alphabet and this has greatly increased her ability to remember how to spell words. My three year old who just learned the ABC song a couple of months ago now knows his ABC's using the sign language alphabet and practices just about every day with all of us at mealtimes. I highly recommend this video both for older kids who are learning to spell as well as for younger kids who are just beginning to learn their ABC's. My daughter's school is strongly anti-media, but my husband and I make an exception to the usual no-TV rule at our house for this video.",1167523200,2,689,4.433070866141732
2689000,5,B000KF0WKI,"This is the first ""story line"" signing DVD that my children have watched and I couldn't believe how it not only kept their attention but how many new signs they picked up after just watching it the first time.  My 22 month old,my almost 4 year old, and my 6 year old twins all love it. (Needless to say, finding something appropriate that everyone can agree on is a beautiful thing in my house!) I think the way the have put the image over the signing hands has really helped my youngest in remembering the signs. And I need to say that the theme song is very catchy, my kids love to sing it.  This DVD series is a must have for any family interested in signing!",1166400000,2,662,4.2047244094488185

8156193,5,B000KF0WKI,"after watching the video only a few times, my two year old neice began signing along with the video.  the actors keep her interest and the repetitive nature makes it easy for her to learn.  would definitely recommend.",1351036800,,217,4.684210526315789
8156194,5,B000KF0WKI,sign a lot videos are great.  my 2 year old loves them.  he sits throught the whole video without getting up.  wish they had more. there are easy to follow and learn from.,1270080000,,171,4.121212121212121
8156195,5,B000KF0WKI,"This is the best series around - hands down.  Our preschool kids have seen other series, yet this is the one series that they constantly ask for again and again.  They get bored with the other series, but this one with the story lines and fun kids and Lee keeps them entertained and learning.  Our preschool/daycare absolutely loves them and it's so amazing how they remember all the signs - I have seen them again and again and yet I can't remember them all quite yet, but the kids have them down cold!  It's fantastic!",1265673600,,520,4.442105263157894
8156196,5,B000KF0WKI,"I got this for my kids (ages 3 and 5) as they get exposed to sign language at school, and they love it.  They learned a lot of animal signs from this DVD and love signing them when we go to the zoo.",1264809600,,198,3.604651162790698
8156197,4,B000KF0WKI,"I like this one better than "" The Great Surprise"" because it can help with spelling and the alphabet but I don't understand the 5 stars everyone is giving the DVD. There is more talking than signing",1258675200,,198,4.378378378378378
8156198,5,B000KF0WKI,"I knew this video was great when my son and I were on a walk and we were doing our signs. He was mimicking me after every letter (a for airplane, etc) when we got to h, I couldn't remember the word from the video, and I look down and he's making the sign for hat on his own.

To set expectations, it doesn't look very professional, but my son loves it and has learned a lot.

This is a more advanced one, so would start with the first version of this which my son also enjoyed, if you are just starting to learn signs.",1247270400,,518,3.9238095238095236
8156199,5,B000KF0WKI,"The Sign-A-Lot videos are an excellent way to teach little ones (and big ones) fun and useful signs.  We are fostering a child who has a condition which may prevent him from ever verbalizing any words.  My wife and I are fluent in ASL, so we are teaching him sign and these videos help. For parents without a prior knowledge of ASL, there is a ""For Parents"" section in the ""Extra Features"" part of the DVD that teaches each sign used in the video.  These are a wonderful break in the day and his sign language improves everyday as a result.",1247184000,,540,4.326732673267327
8156200,5,B000KF0WKI,"My children 2 1/2 and 5 1/2 love the video as well at the Big Surprise.  They learned over 50 signs in this one video alone.  They enjoy watching the videos and interacting with them.  My 2 1/2year old has been going to speech therapy, so we bought him this DVD to help him learn ASL (and thus reinforce his speech therapy). Not to mentition helping us-his mother and father learn ASL.  Because my son loves this DVD, he wants to watch it at least every other day, and because he watches it all the time, the signs are really sticking. Our entire family has learned a good bit of ASL, and that has made a huge impact on our son's ability to communicate. His total vocabulary is improving and his spoken vocabulary has more than doubled. Within 2 weeks of starting him with sign language he was able to sign over 100 words.  We looked at several DVD's to help us with learning ASL and found Sign-A-Lot to have the most words in one video.  I recommend getting both Sign-A-lot videos.",1226102400,,982,4.368131868131868
8156201,5,B000KF0WKI,my girls ages 2 and 3 love the DVD and would watch it several times in a row if I let them. One is hearing imapared and the other is not but both love it and learn.,1215648000,,164,3.4594594594594597
