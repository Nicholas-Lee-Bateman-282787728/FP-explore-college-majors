3011635,4,B000Y5CHIE,"I just watched the blu-ray version. It is tons better than the dvd version, but is not the same as the theatrical. For the most part the scenes that they cut out of the dvd version are back in (""Women apart make no sense..., Cameron's monument, face to the north and real sudden like turn left, Clannad song, serious disagreement, and most of what was added to the dvd version was gone except for the Fort William war scenes).

They did make a few odd cuts, ""Nothing better to do on the lake today Major?"" and a scene under the waterfall  (""One of us survives...""

I'm buying the blu-ray version, because it overall exceeded my expectations compared to the dvd.",1286236800,22,661,4.491666666666666
3011636,5,B000Y5CHIE,"Update: Clannad's ""I Will Find You"" is restored in this Blu-ray version.

From the rumor mill: the blu-ray movie length will be 114 minutes - the same running time as the VHS.

Michael Mann should take a cue from Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and release the BluRay with both the theatrical and the director's cut.",1282867200,8,312,4.654545454545454
3011637,5,B000Y5CHIE,"This Blue-ray release finally brings the film back out of the darkness of the DVD director's cut version, technically it's not 100 percent the original theatrical release but don't let the director's definitive cut title scare you because it's close enough. They fixed all the major changes like: they put the song back, fixed the fort scenes, and fixed the whole ending sequence to what it once was. Everyone rejoice for the DVD version is dead!!! Now I don't have to hang on to the widescreen VHS anymore, bravo!!",1281139200,5,515,4.797752808988764

3011639,3,B000Y5CHIE,"It's so hard not to buy this, because this is near or at the top of my list of the best 5 movies of all time.

Its painful to say anything at all negative about this movie. I have it on VHS and DVD and would love to have it on Blu-Ray, but the ""Director's Cut"" (first seen on the DVD version) butchers so much of what makes the orignal release great.

If you have never seen the original movie or the VHS version, you will likley rate this much higher than I do here, but for those of us who have and know what is missing, this version is a disappointment when compared to what could have been.",1280880000,7,594,3.9831932773109244
3011640,5,B000Y5CHIE,"I loved the theatrical cut of the this movie.  Then Michael Mann re-cut the film for some odd reason only he knows or cares about, so I will only be buying the Blu-Ray if he includes the Theatrical Cut in the edition.  If filmmakers like Mann and George Lucas want to keep revisiting and destroying their work that people fell in love with, at least let fans of their films see the original work!  If you ask me, Mann's recut edition of Last of the Mohicans is not better in any way.  The music, which is beautiful, was edited brilliantly to the images.  With Mann's last cut, he disrupted the flow in some spots.  I thought the film was wonderful before.  I don't know why he had to change it.",1279929600,13,694,4.292307692307692

3011642,1,B000Y5CHIE,"***This 1 star review is for the ""Director's Expanded Edition"" DVD version of this film and not for the ""Director's Definitive Cut"" Blu-Ray.  Amazon is lumping the reviews. ***

Like many others, I love the theatrical release of this film.  It remains one of my favorite movies of all time.  However, I made the mistake of purchasing the ""directors expanded version"" on DVD and I will not make that mistake again.  Key dialog has been removed along with the moving song by Clannad, ""I Will Find You.""  This all so we can get a few extra shots from the cutting room floor thrown in that look completely rough and unnecessary.

I love this movie, but if there is a Blu-Ray release, I will not purchase the ""director's expanded edition.""  There was no reason to issue the director's expanded version in the first place.

3011644,3,B000Y5CHIE,"Why is there so much dialogue cut out of this movie? I remember growing up, watching this movie 100 times, memorizing every line. I just bought the definitive director's cut Blu Ray and it still has alot of dialogue missing. After magua leads the British into the woods for the ambush, when the 3 guys save cora and Duncan, after he gets rid of the horses, cora asks why did he get rid of the horses, and he says to easy to track, we'd be heard for miles. After that in the original movie, he says very distinctly to""find yourself a musket"". That's cut out. Cora talking to Hawkeye, alot of the dialogue is there but there's one part where she says ""what?"" After he says ""don't try to make them understand you.."" that's cut out. And when they reach the fort, when they walk in, a guy walls past hawkeye, he says"" I thought you boys weren't coming?"" In the the original version he says"" we didn't, we just dropped in to see how you boys were doing"". In this version, that whole like is cut out. Wtf?! So much cut out. Why is that?

3011671,5,B000Y5CHIE,"I do not own this DVD nor do I own any of the others but I recently had the privilege of watching the original theatrical release in 35mm back-to-back with a digital cinema projection of what I believe was the definitive directors cut and I too noticed the differences in image brightness and contrast and changes in the audio track and since I'm seeing this as a trend in a lot of comments, then I know with some certainty that these changes were made intentionally. While I'm not sure if these changes were purely due to considerations for recent technology and home theatre advancements, the fact remains that no matter how bright you set your television or how loud you make your sound system, changes were definitely made that remove detail from the picture and lessen the impact of the musical score (at least until the ending). All these changes essentially create a completely different picture from the original and I would argue might be the best version (if not just the most mature). The reduction in color saturation, the darkening of the images, and the lowering of the bass during some of the musical moments all comes together to tone down the sexiness, excessive emotion and mtv viscera. What you're left with is a more even tempered and cerebral and meditative (but no less stirring or entertaining) viewing experience. If you're hoping to relive the experience from the first time you saw this in the theatre, you might be disappointed. However, if you want to see a well-aged more mature revision of a Michael Mann masterpiece, this is definitely worth owning.",1508716800,,1580,4.8125

3011704,5,B000Y5CHIE,"This review is for people like me who've seen this and are wondering which version to buy.

I grew up watching the Theatrical Release; by now the VHS is worn to shreds and I don't even have a VHS player anymore. A few years ago, hoping to replace it, I bought the Director's Expanded Edition. It feels like a different movie: the pacing, flow between scenes, even character development - they're all different from what I'd loved for years.

In the Expanded Edition, key dialogue is missing between nearly all the characters, muddying their motivations. Magua's motivations are also muddier, the actions of the French are less clear, and the over-all thread of the politically-charged situation between the French, British, and the Indian peoples who sided with either of them feels disjointed. It's a choppy cut. It takes out vital moments between Nathaniel and Cora, and it feels to me like it further pushes Uncas and Chingachgook back as supporting characters by reducing little moments with both of them, when honestly they should have more screen time than they do in any version. It seems like most of the added time was for the fort fight scenes. Yes, they built an actual fort and probably used actual canons to blow it up, but it feels like filler in any other typical Hollywood action movie. That's the greatest insult I can give to it. This edition made it mundane. tl;dr - don't buy the DVD.

The Definitive Cut on Blu-ray is a different matter. While it isn't quite the same as the Theatrical, it's so, so much closer. The storyline isn't disjointed anymore, and they've cut back on the ridiculously long fort siege scenes in favor of adding dialogue back in. The sound quality is also stellar in comparison to the Expanded Edition (and my highly degraded VHS, ha). It's beautifully crisp and nicely color-balanced, to boot.

My advice? Get the blu-ray. The only thing the Expanded Edition has that I miss is a gorgeous capstone speech at the end by Chingachgook (Russell Means), which is greatly reduced in the Definitive, but you can probably see that on Youtube.",1484524800,115,2079,4.798882681564246

Often times I will purchase a Blu-ray hoping to get digitally remastered blu-ray quality but find just regular DVD quality. This is one of those cases. Watching this blu-ray on my hi-def tv was perhaps the worst I ever recall seeing it. The night scenes were the worst I've ever seen in any movie. The colors in the fire light seemed like an old Disney animation (sorry, only way I can describe it). If you have it on VHS or DVD...... don't bother upgrading even if it's only $5.

P.S. for an example of an old movie with a great transfer to Blu-ray check out ""How The West Was Won"". You won't believe the picture quality. That's what I look for.",1438992000,5,813,4.279220779220779

I am searching for the original version of this movie,  with the song in it,  which I have somewhere on VHS.  I admit I had no idea they could make so many changes to a movie when you buy it on DVD.  How is anyone supposed to know if they are getting the real movie or not when it is bought on DVD or Blu Ray?  It's a real eye opener,  especially for those of us that no longer go to theatres to watch a movie,  but wait for the DVD/Blu Ray version to come out.

3011806,4,B000Y5CHIE,"I would love to give this one 5 stars. The movie is excellent, a classic, the picture quality is superb, if a bit dark, the audio is quite... dynamic (like any Michael Mann movie), and the extras are solid. All in all, I am quite pleased with this product. Many have expounded on the changes director Michael Mann has made, reediting the movie to improve little tiny things here and there. Nothing drastic. Never straying too far from the original theatrical version. Having not seen the theatrical version, I can't compare this version and that one, but the experience of watching this movie was definitely just like any movie; that is to say, the editing is just fine.

There's just one problem. One small, tiny problem. A miniscule imperfection so jarring it's infuriating.

Spoilers.

When the British are marching back wherever it is they happen to be going, having just surrendered the fort to les franais, and they're attacked; Magua, the brilliantly acted, developed, and written antagonist of the film, hidden in the shroud of the forest with his army of frightfully aggressive Hurons, creeping alongside the ragged, exhausted troops and the innocent women and children, sees Colonel Monroe, his sworn enemy. The camera pans in, Magua looks ready to kill some Yengeese, and he raises up his arm and shouts a frightful war cry, which the others Hurons quickly join in. Everyone is scared, all hell breaks loose, etc. etc.

Or at least that's how it goes in the other versions. I know because I compared them on YouTube. In this version, it suddenly cuts away from Magua before he's even begun to raise his arm. It was such an unexpectedly bad, poorly considered, contrary-to-apparent-original-directorial-intent, and noticeable flaw in the editing, I'm forced to subtract a star. Four stars. How does that feel, Mr. Mann?",1428451200,10,1829,4.967320261437909

3011828,5,B000Y5CHIE,"Last of the Mohicans centers around a band of Mohawks caught in the middle of a war between the French and the English where Indian forces are pitted against each other for the gains of the colonial powers. The social political setting revolves around the love story between white, adopted son of the Mohawks, Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his love for Cora (Madeline Stowe). This story is a foundational fiction for the North American continent.
 Whilst we get a sense of life and history in the late 18th century, we are also given main characters that represent more than just themselves. Hawkeye, a transplant of the native culture, falls in love with a proper Englishwoman, and daughter of a general of the British military. Their story is predictable, we know from the beginning that these two will unite in the story and fall in love. However, they are faced with outside forces that will try and thwart their chances of falling in love. In this film, the forces of war, Coras father, and an officer of the British military who loves Cora, are all things that are working against the two lovers being together. The love represents the coming together of people of the land and people of aristocracy. The lovers are from different socio-economic backgrounds, but their relationship paves the way for mingling in-between classes to find love, and to progress. This only works for the white people however.
 There is another narrative of love in the story, between Uncas (Eric Schweig) and Coras sister Alice (Jodhi May). Uncas is a Mohawk; because of this his chance to be with the white military daughter is significantly less from the start. They too are plagued with the same forces as Hawkeye and Cora that hinder them from falling in love, but these characters do not over come their obstacles in the end. Uncas is killed, and Alice takes her life shortly after. Representing the idea that on the North American continent, it was not an acceptable to have intercultural marriage with Natives and Europeans. There are no mestisos. Their love from the beginning was doomed because of the ideals of the time in this area, and their deaths represent the inability of the North Americans to fully co-exist with Natives.
 This storys foundational fiction aspects sets it characters to represent a larger part of the North American continent at the time. While love can be forged, it is still limited to the privileged: the whites.",1417737600,,2435,4.862650602409639

The original theatrical version of ""Last of the Mohicans"" has to be one of my favourite films. It has everything, including heart-stopping action and a marvellously developed romance between the two leading stars. I would have readily given this film five stars for the original Warner Brothers DVD version which also appears to have been the original theatrical version. It is unfortunate that the Blu-ray falls well below the standard set by the original DVD. The darker scenes in the Blu-ray version are much darker than in the earlier DVD and could fairly be described as muddy. Other reviewers have pointed out that important pieces of dialogue have been omitted from the Blu-ray version. I would urge those who love this film and own a region-free DVD player to avoid the Blu-ray versions and try to obtain the original Warner Brother's DVD which is still available in Britain and Australia at a very modest price.",1411689600,2,1062,5.005649717514125

""The Last of the Mohicans"" is generally a pretty darkly-lit film, and while the blu-ray is no doubt a more accurate copy of the original print and is sharp-enough, allowing one to make out detail even in nighttime scenes, it's just so dark throughout that I prefer my brighter DVD of the Director's Cut (not ""Director's Definitive Cut"" in fact, but a slightly different edition).  Also, I wish the soundtrack were a good-deal louder, especially the dialogue -- and I don't like listening to really loud soundtracks, such as at the movie theater (where I always use earplugs).

I already had this on video tape and DVD . Bought the Blu-ray copy to watch at my brother's house. Bottom Line: I regret the purchase.

3011854,5,B000Y5CHIE,"Leave it to Michael Mann, creator of ""Miami Vice"", the quintessential 1980's chic cop drama, to wipe away centuries' worth of dust and must from James Fenimore Cooper's ""The Last of the Mohicans"" and uncover the still beating heart of an action adventure film within. His exhilarating film is replete with chases, gun battles and a deeply felt and genuinely adult love story as well as an appreciation of nature that a charter member of Greenpeace could endorse.
The deep woods of North Carolina are perhaps the only place in the country that could successfully evoke the forest primeval of pre-Revolutionary War America (at least in 1992, when the film was made). No wonder Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe, currently starring in television's ""Revenge"") comments to her future lover Nathaniel/Hawkeye (Daniel Day Lewis) regarding her geographical as well as her emotional situation: ""It is more deeply stirring to my blood than any imagining could be."" Freed of the social constraints imposed on her in her role as a British colonel's elder unmarried daughter, Cora can return Nathaniel's male gaze with equally passionate intensity.
For Daniel Day Lewis, ""Mohicans"" marks the first fully realized American characterization by this Anglo-Irish actor who would span the emotional and political landscape of America from the Puritan rebel, John Proctor in ""The Crucible"" (1996) to our most beloved and highly regarded president in ""Lincoln"" (2012). In between those multi-faceted performances, Day Lewis would offer us such diverse Americans as Bill the Butcher, a Civil War racist and xenophobe in ""The Gangs of New York"" (2002), Newland Archer, an emotionally repressed New York aristocrat in the Gilded Age in ""The Age of Innocence"" (1993) and Daniel Plainview, a murderously sociopathic oil magnate at the turn of the 20th century in ""There Will Be Blood"" (2007). For DDL, America begins here.
Lewis's Nathaniel/Hawkeye is a prototypical American hero before there was a U.S. A. He is the bare-chested romantic ideal, a man of action with a variety of weapons, especially the long rifle (score one for the advocates of the Second Amendment) and yet he is also an exemplar of racial tolerance, if not integration (ACLU, take note), raised as he was among the Mohicans. The entire film exhibits a politically correct sensitivity to Native Americans and their attitudes toward the natural world of which they consider themselves a part, brothers even to dead deer. This attitude is reflected in the real deal casting of Russell Means as the title character and Wes Studi as a seriously terrifying, seriously well motivated Magua, the film's arch villain.
The cinematography of Dante Spinotti, riveting in all kinds of light, as well as the minutely accurate production design of Wolf Kroeger, make us believe that America was once an Eden where man lived in harmony with nature and oftentimes with each other; though there are tribal animosities and the presence of the imperial powers of Britain and France, there is also the spectacle of a Native American single father raising his blood son and his adopted American son as equals. Even the ancient trees seem fresh and new, dialectical elements in a film that is at once refreshingly old fashioned (there are scenes evocative of 2 John Ford films, ""Drums along the Mohawk"" (1939)- by virtue of the French and Indian War setting and ""The Searchers"" (1956),reflected in the discovery of the victims of an Indian massacre), and as contemporary as the latest discussions of imperialism and patriotism.
After a night spent with Nathaniel, Cora speaks truth to power in the person of her father, Colonel Munro, using revolutionary rhetoric. Her sister's nascent love affair with the Mohican Uncas is terminated by the death of each, but has elements of an interracial Romeo and Juliet to it. They are us, we are them.
Ultimately, ""The Last of the Mohicans"" throbs with romantic intensity, especially in the central performances of Day Lewis and Stowe and the pulsating score by Trevor Jones and Danny Elfman. Michael Mann directs with unrelenting energy and the Oscar-winning sound mix totally immerses the viewer in a long gone but amazingly recognizable world. 20th Century Fox has produced a Blu-ray of sharp imagery and piercing sound. Simply put, this Blu-ray rocks.",1405900800,,4313,5.1365576102418204

I find it too mainstream and to me it reveals mann's weak side: when it comes to politics and history, he's much more mainstream than when he deals with original character/plot driven films. Here you recognize its usual cinematographic touch, but it doesn't stick out as in Manhunter, Insider, Heat, Collateral. To me it's like Public Enemy: when he knows he can't work on history with as much freedom as he does when he works on stories, his movies become basic, too classic, and lose that magic touch where great narration and great cinema-style usually succeed resulting in a great mix of  humanistic storytelling, excellent visual and originality, al, well balanced. The Mann I like is dark but classic, maniacally well crafted but with a heart. Here he seems to be too respectful and focus on telling the story well, but I expected a less manicheistic and cliche approach to spa story wiphich could have been treated in a more provocative and personal way.",1402790400,,1017,4.811428571428571

3011873,3,B000Y5CHIE,"Based on James Fenimore Coopers novel about the British and French Colonial wars on the American Frontier in 1757  Michael Manns ""The Last Of The Mohicans"" is a 5-star blast of a movie with fabulous chemistry between its lead actors Daniel Day-Lewis (Nathaniel Hawkeye) and Madeleine Stowe (Cora Munro  a generals daughter). But no matter how much I love the 1992 movie or want it to be great on the new fangled format  I take exception to anyone suggesting that the ""Director's Definitive Cut"" on BLU RAY is 'stunning' to look at. That's just nonsense  it isnt.

Unfortunately the whole film seems afflicted with a sort of out-of-focus blurriness and lack of definition that infects scene after scene. Sure it looks clean in the daylight sequences - especially when Hawkeye and the power mad Magua (a sensationally good Wes Studi) go at it with hatchets on the mountain ridge at the end. The scene where Magua seeks the approval of the tribe elder and Hawkeye tries to reason with him  is superb too - gorgeous clarity. But other outdoor sequences (running through foliage) are just plain ordinary looking. And again there's huge parts of The Last Of The Mohicans - especially the interminably long night sequence in the centre of the film when General Munros Fort is being bombarded by French guns - when blocking and grain fill every shot to a point where it looks like a bad Eighties video.

Its defaulted to 2.4:1 aspect ratio (bars on the top and bottom)   but if you stretch it to semi or even full screen aspect  immediately the picture quality degrades  and the haziness of the focus returns.

The ""Director's Cut"" runs about 5 minutes longer than the Theatrical Version - and other good news is that theres all-new Making Of featurettes:

1. Act 1: Becoming Hawkeye
2. Act 2: A Love Story Between Hawkeye and Cora
3. Act 3: Bringing The Epic Story To Life
4. Commentary by Michael Mann

Subtitles include English, Brazilian Portuguese, Complex Chinese, Czech, Dutch, French, Hungarian, Korean, Polish, Romanian, Thai and Turkish. This November 2012 BLU RAY reissue is also REGION FREE.

I hate to throw a damp squib on the log cabin fire  but Ill now find this movie hard to watch ever again. Its a bit like American Graffiti (see review)  another huge favourite of mine thats been made worse somehow by BLU RAY rather than better.

Once BluRay was released, it was one of the first titles that I searched for, but sadly it was not available yet.  I put myself of the waiting notification and was thrilled when it was finally released!

To say that this movie has some of the most beautiful scenery is cutting it short; now add the defintiion of BluRay and it is astounding.  The acting is amazing, believable and at times so heart wrenching that the tears flow.  The story is one that there is no compare to in the movie world.  It is a classic that (should) go down as an all-time great.

As if that is not enough, the music score is one of the best that I have ever heard.  The horns in the intro are so amazing that I purchased the score cd (first one I have ever purchased and notice I said the score, not the music), and I turned it up and let it blast on my stereo.

Daniel Day-Lewis showed even back in 1992 that he had an acting range like no other, going from his Oscar win in My Left Foot to this colonial ""white Indian"" action hero. Madeline Stowe made the love story aspect believable and Wes Studi is easily one of the most memorable villains ever. The final sequence on the mountain, with almost no dialogue and the hypnotic music building as the action unfolds is something you will never forget.

Luckily, unlike most people I have another blu-ray player for which the display has been 'professionally' calibrated with a colorimeter and there was a drastic improvement. However, this blu-ray still almost feels more like a dvd. Not worth an upgrade.

It is still an outstanding film worth owning, if you don't already, but the picture quality and even the sound, which it won an academy award for, both leave something to be desired.  I was expecting to be absolutely blown away by the sound but it is average at best. The dts core sounded identical to the dts hd-ma track.  Last 20 minutes are still the best, as always, but I don't see how a film can win an academy award based on 20 minutes.

Only three lines didn't make it back in--Nathaniel's snark to Duncan when he's explaining that he isn't a scout--""That Clear it Up any"", the line Nathaniel says right before they all escape in the canoes, and Cora's lines at the waterfall, about if the worst should happen...and of right when the promentory starts, in the original, you have Nathaniel and Cora walking slowly away before Duncan is tortured, that wasn't restored.

But I'm okay with that, because everything else was restored and that made me happy. Because my two favorite scenes,
Nathaniel to Duncan ""Someday you and I are going to have a serious disagreement"" and the scene between Nathaniel and Cora about women being a ""breed apart"" was put back in.

It would be nice to know why the theatrical version was not made available in North America releases though. And it still isn't.

Though someone posted the original online on youtube, the there is about 45 minutes that was taken down--the first 15 minutes, the second hour (first 15 minutes) and the scene right after the water fall up until the last 5 minutes.

3011931,5,B000Y5CHIE,"Last of The Mohicans purists like myself who are so unhappy with the ""Director's Expanded Edition"" of this film should be a bit more pleased with the Blu-Ray ""Director's Definitive Cut"" version of the movie. As discussed by other reviewers, the ""expanded edition"" edited out what many think are the stellar lines of the movie. Imagine a version of Dirty Harry where Clint doesn't ask the punk to ""make his day.""  Imagine a version of The Terminator where Arnie doesn't say he'll ""be back.""  Imagine Clark Gable failing mention he doesn't ""Give a Damn."" and you'll get the idea of what the ""Director's Expanded Edition"" of Last of the Mohicans is like to watch.
  The GOOD NEWS is that in the Blu Ray (""Director's Definitive Cut"")SOME but not ALL of the the dialogue that was foolishly edited from the ""Expanded"" version remains. Happily, the blu-ray version does not edit Cora and Hawkeye's discussion about how his father ""warned me about people like you.""  It remains fully intact - including Hawkeye's ""In your case, Miss, I'd make an exception"" and Cora's sarcastic ""thank you SO much.""  In the Blu ray version the viewer also gets to see Hawkeye tell Duncan that one day the two of them are going to have a ""serious disagreement"".  The bad news is that Hawkeye DOES NOT ask Duncan (in the canoe scene) if he doesn't ""have anything better to do on the lake today.""  And in the scene by the waterfall, Cora doesn't say how if ""the worst should happen"" and one of them dies, a part of the other will live on in the survivor. Instead, as soon as she says ""And if the worst happens..."" the scene edits directly to Hawkeye screaming all that ain't-no-mountain-high-enough stuff about ""Stay Alive! Stay Alive!"" The way it's edited, it is as if he's responding to her having asked what she should do if the worst should happen.  So there you have it.  Some of the good stuff is still in the blu ray version and some is still missing.  While not as intact as I understand the European, Region 2 original theatrical release is, the blu ray version is a huge improvement from the ""extended cut"" edition in terms of leaving some of the most dramatic lines of the movie intact. Was tempted to give it only 4 stars because of the missing lines but in this version it's a great movie so 5 stars won out.",1339200000,71,2293,4.554744525547445
3011932,5,B000Y5CHIE,"Michael Mann's penchant for tinkering with his films after their theatrical release has reached something of a fever pitch with his ""Definitive Director's Cut"" of one of his best movies: the 1992 adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper's THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS.

A movie that underwent a turbulent production that saw Fox bump the picture's original, highly-visible July 4th weekend opening to the fall, have Mann re-cut his reportedly three hour initial version down per the studio's wishes, and see Randy Edelman come in to rework some of the music after a reported breakdown in communication between original composer Trevor Jones and Mann, ""Mohicans"" felt like a film that was primed to become a major box-office disappointment before it opened.

Happily, the resulting film proved the doubters wrong and ranked as one of the year's (some may argue the decade's) finest films - a rugged, authentic outdoor adventure with Daniel-Day Lewis brilliantly embodying Hawkeye, and striking up a magnetic chemistry with co-star Madeline Stowe, in a story set against the backdrop of Colonial America with spectacular cinematography by Dante Spinotti and production design from Wolf Kroeger. Vivid action scenes, a stirring romance, great performances (Wes Studi and Russell Means lend ideal support) and unforgettable soundtrack all culminate in a truly inspired production from Mann, working at the height of his filmmaking ability in what would be the first of three outstanding films he made in the `90s (""Heat"" and ""The Insider"" followed).

The movie's production woes reportedly did not enable Mann to implement all the editorial work he wanted on the picture. Despite the film's solid grosses and widespread critical acclaim, the director re-cut the film in 2002 for its Director's Cut DVD, eliminating some dialogue and making mostly minor tweaks here and there, including the removal of Clannad's popular song ""I Will Wait For You"" and the addition of some unnecessary dialogue from Chingachgook during the film's final scene.

Fans of the movie who lamented some of those changes will be happy to note that Mann once again has gone back in and reworked ""Mohicans"" for a second time. His new ""Definitive Director's Cut"" Blu-Ray doesn't find Mann crafting his rumored three-hour version (Jodhi May fans will remain disappointed that her role still remains mostly on the cutting room floor), but ironically returning, for the most part, to his original theatrical version - restoring lines of dialogue that he cut for the prior DVD, adding Clannad's song back in (though this time with Native American lyrics), and taking out the preachy, unnecessary dialogue at the picture's end (the images spoke for themselves). While it can be frustrating that Mann can't always seem to leave well enough at times, the alterations - in this case - improve the picture over its 2002 edition and make for a more satisfying version all told.

Also far more satisfying here than any prior DVD release of the film is Fox's excellent AVC-encoded 1080p transfer. One of the most breathtaking visual films of its era, this sharply detailed presentation is very good indeed, preserving the movie's original grain and adding detail unseen since its original theatrical release. DTS Master Audio sound robustly backs the film's potent, multi-composer soundtrack, which Randy Edelman had told me years ago hat he may have rescored completely had there been the time to do so.

Supplements aren't overwhelming but will prove to be of major interest for fans: a new, 42-minute doc includes interviews with all the principals (Stowe still looks great) plus behind-the-scenes footage, presented in HD; there's also a new commentary from Mann along with the original trailers.

Obviously, then,  I eagerly awaited the DVD release several years back, thinking that my new home theater projector would help me to relive the theatrical experience. When I played that DVD, which I have only played twice in a decade, I could not believe how much the director had damaged the dramatic effect of several vital scenes, most notably the ending, which is drawn out by a long speech by Chingachgook, diluting the effect of his brief, essential, overwhelmingly ""right"" utterance in the theatrical version.  A big thank you to those who mentioned the original version available at Amazon UK, from whom I frequently order anyway.  (BTW, universal DVD players are cheap, and universal Blu-Ray players are getting cheaper.)

4/05: I consider The Last of the Mohicans one of the all-time great films.

When I saw the picture at the theatre, it was just brilliant, and I hadn't seen anything like it before or since then.

Hence, Michael Mann is one of the best directors in the history of motion pictures. All he does is make visual masterpieces.

The Last of the Mohicans should have received a boatload of Oscar nominations including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor (at least twice), Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing.

It's impossible to deny how good Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeline Stowe, Wes Studi, Russell Means, Steven Waddington, Maurice Roeves, Patrice Chereau, and Eric Schweig among others were in the film.

As Magua, Wes Studi turned in the best performance of 1992, and it's not even that close. If anyone remembers The Last of the Mohicans, it's Wes Studi's performance because of how he shows his emotions.

Wes spoke four different languages: French, Huron, Mohawk, and English. During the scene on the cliff, he twisted his knee and tore his cartilage, forcing him to have an orthoscopic surgery before returning back on the set a week later. That's why he is seen wearing a brace or rather a legging over it.

Some of my favorite lines of the film are:

""Well, we kind of face to the north, and real sudden-like, turn left.""

""l, Chingachgook, the last of the Mohicans.""

""It is more deeply stirring to my blood than any imagining could possibly have been.""

""I do not call myself subject to much at all.""

""In case your aim's any better than your judgment.""

""I ain't your scout. And we sure ain't no damn militia.""

""In the response to ""What are you looking at, sir?,"" ""I'm looking at you, miss.""

""Yes, and, 'do not try to make them understand you. That is because they are a breed apart and make no sense.'""

""Magua's heart is twisted.""

""We're sorry to kill you, brother. We do honor to your courage and speed, your strength.""

In Huron, ""Magua understands that the white man is a dog to his women. When they are tired, he puts down his tomahawk to feed their laziness.""

""Magua said, understand English very well.""

""Some day, I think, you and I will have a serious disagreement.""

""A breed apart, we make no sense?""

""When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies, Magua will put his children under the knife, so the Grey Hair will know his seed is wiped out forever.""

By the way, the DVD version of The Last of the Mohicans is atrociously bad. Because certain lines and shots are cut out and new but unnecessary shots are added in, the spirit is just not the same as the theatrical version. The battle scenes are too long and boring. That's why I still have the VHS copy (in fact, two) and prefer to watch that one.

All in all, there's nothing like The Last of the Mohicans.

7/07: I said it before and I will say it again: The Last of the Mohicans is a unique masterpiece.

Wes Studi was snubbed big time for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. If not for him, I don't think The Last of the Mohicans would have been half of the film as it is.

Daniel Day-Lewis is at his sexiest and is complemented well by Madeleine Stowe. They have some of the best romantic scenes in any film.

All in all, The Last of the Mohicans might be the best picture that Michael Mann has ever directed.

7/11: Wes Studi was clearly robbed of the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.

All in all, The Last of the Mohicans is a masterpiece.

2/17: Still a great film.",1310169600,6,3632,4.54

I gave my previous DVD version of this movie away once the BD version arrived. I wish I could get it back. Even the dark scenes on the DVD version had more detail than this crummy BluRay rip-off. I know now that when you first open up the BD case and find only the disk, be alert to a mediocre effort in providing a good quality BD product. What a waste of time and money.",1305763200,12,529,4.0
3011945,4,B000Y5CHIE,"I read the many reviews of the LOTM prior to buying the Blu Ray version for myself. (I already had the DVD version). Here's my two cents in a straight forward manner.

The documentary about making the movie was absolutely EXCELLENT, and this was exactly the kind of documentary I had been yearning for, for almost 20 years. If I recall, there was also one made by HBO when the movie was first broadcast on that channel almost 2 decades ago, but this one is different. Michael Mann along with DDL, Madeleine Stowe (who looks even more gorgeous and ravishing as she did years ago), Wes Studi, and Dale Dye (the famous military consultant) all make great insights into the movie.

The commentary track throughout the movie (that I rarely use, except for movies I am fanatical about, like LOTM) was done by Mann. He gave a great deal of historical commentary which was interesting, but I was hoping for more observations about the specific movie scenes themselves, which he did only on an occasional basis. I thought the in-depth historical information was to the point of saturation.

Other reviewers commented on the dark quality of the movie, which is unfortunately true and was a slight disappointment. HOWEVER, the Blu Ray version is indeed crystal clearer and sharper, when compared to the normal DVD version. Interestingly, when I compared the DVD version of LOTM, the DVD was generally darker in color as well, when compared to other DVD titles I had, but the Blu Ray version is noticeably darker than the LOTM DVD version and was a little bothersome.

In summary, as a diehard LOTM fan, I am happy with the Blu Ray version. The darker color shouldn't dispel anyone from buying it.",1301356800,11,1685,4.7406143344709895

Being one of my all time favorite movies, I recently broke and purchased the Director's Definitive Cut on Blu-Ray. I watched it expecting some major differences from the Theatrical Release version, but it wasn't that different. I have heard that in the DVD release of the film, the Clannad song, ""I will find you"" was cut and the ending dialogue was vastly different. Both are intact in the Blu-Ray release of the film. There are a few dialogue changes, all pretty minor, and some added scenes. Overall, this version of the film is still true to the version I remember and love, the VHS/Theatrical release version.

3011953,5,B000Y5CHIE,"I am a big fan of the Last of the Mohicans. I have loved this movie for many years and have practically worn out my VHS copy. I have been waiting impatiently for the theatrical release of this film to be available in the US on DVD. Needless to say, I was very disappointed with the directors expanded edition when it was first released on DVD. Too many scenes were cut. I kept hoping that maybe the Blu Ray edition would solve all of these problems. Even though it is still considered the directors edition, it is much closer to the original theatrical release with only a few minor changes.

Disclaimer: This review is meant for the detail oriented fans who are looking for a breakdown of what made the cut and what didn't. Obviously, I couldn't include everything, but these are some of the key issues many had with the original DVD release. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

Most of the interactions between Cora and Hawkeye have been put back into the movie. The scene with them talking about her being, ""a breed apart that makes no sense"" is back.  However, you don't get to hear her shocked reactions.

Most of Hawkeye's lines are back especially, ""one day you and I are going to have a serious disagreement."" One that didn't make the cut is his cocky retort at the end of explaining how they are heading west. You no longer hear him say, ""clear it up any?"" Lastly, the line, ""Nothing better to do on the lake today, Major?"" is still not back in the film.

There are a few additions to the film. It's nothing too extreme that takes away from the plot though. There are more shots at the battle taking place at Fort William Henry. The French Colonel is given a few more lines. The parley sequence has a few added lines. You get the idea.

Yes, Clannad's I Will Find You is back, but it is all in a different language as many have already pointed out.

Chingachgook's original speech is back at the end of the film.

The entire ""I will find you"" speech has been returned.

One more thing that I noticed is that they changed the coloring on a lot of the scenes. Some scenes are duller and some scenes the colors are more vivid. The director explained in the behind the scenes that he was going for natural lighting, so it's possible that he simply got rid of any alterations/filters they had done in the past. I have THX capability on my tv, but it's still very dark/dull looking in some places. Perhaps it's because I'm used to my VHS copy, so take this with a grain of salt. For those who haven't watched it one too many times, you won't even see the difference.

Overall, I am thrilled with this version. It is ten times better than the original DVD release. I am very glad that all of the lines that I loved are back in the movie. The small changes/missing lines are not enough to make me want to wait another 5-10 years and hope my VHS copy lasts. I am very satisfied with this version. I really enjoyed the behind the scenes feature and would not be ashamed to add this copy to my library. It's worth the money.",1292889600,20,3039,4.343915343915344
3011954,1,B000Y5CHIE,"The movie is great, but the image is so awful. I am shocked with the quality. It is not Blu-ray, It's VHS.",1291939200,3,106,3.8636363636363638
3011955,3,B000Y5CHIE,"I've spoken with many people about this movie and how ridiculously messed up things were when it came to DVD.  Well I went ahead and bought the blu ray anyway because I love the movie but also because I heard it's slightly different than the DVD, and it is.  But the differences are subtle and in the end I think the original theatrical release was ultimately the best version of this movie.

Most of the time when a director makes a final cut he/she shouldn't be aloud to delete anything, only add.  That was Michael Mann's problem with his definitive cut of ""Last of the Mohicans"" for blu ray.  There are 2 major deletions, 1 noticeable add on (there are also a few extra shots of the French storming the fort which are nice) and 1 minor deletion.

1st major deletion - When Daniel Day Lewis and Madeline Stowe were in the waterfall scene and they decided that he had to try and escape while she stayed behind and attempted to survive, ""Just stay alive!""  Yes, it was one of the worst scenes in the Hollywood history but it was at least supplemented a little by the dialogue of Madeline Stowe's character ""if one of us survives then a part of the other survives too,"" that whole thing.  I liked it and they cut it out.  It went straight from ""There's no powder it's all wet,"" to ""stay alive!...""  Really bazaar.  He took a scene that was already terrible and made it worse.

2nd major deletion - When the French General Montcalm was talking to Magua in the original release and on the DVD, Magua asks if the thinks the English will keep their promise to leave, to which Montcalm replies ""Col. Monroe would, but General Webb will not honor the agreement.""  Basically indicating that he wouldn't ""mind"" if Magua's war party somehow ""found"" Col. Monroe's dilapidated army and wiped them out, but at the same time expressing how he felt about the English officer.  The dialogue showed the respect that Montcalm had for Monroe and how he knew if Monroe were in charge they would leave.  For some reason it was cut.  Now the dialogue in the scene is very choppy.  It also doesn't tie in well with a previous scene between Monroe and Montcalm (that Michael Mann added btw) and now makes the characters of Monroe and Montcalm lack depth.  Why take that out, this one over the others is the one that confuses me the most.  FOR WHAT REASON???  It's only about 5 seconds of dialogue, what's the big deal, why did Mr. Mann not care for that particular dialogue?  Changing just a few seconds of a movie can have a big affect.

1 minor deletion - This was in the trailer as well as the original release.  It's when Daniel Day-Lewis shows up to the fort and says ""just dropped in to see how you boys was doin'.""  I have no problem with the deletion of this, it wasn't even amusing when I saw it the first time in the trailer.

1 addition - As mentioned before there is an extended scene with Col. Monroe and Montcalm discussing the terms of surrender (just like on the DVD).  It was a great addition, I liked it, made sense, but then of course it was screwed up by editing the aforementioned scene between Magua and the Montcalm.  Michael Mann must have the same mentality as the Washington Redskins; do one thing good and then do 3 stupid things.

Well just thought you'd want to know.  It's still such a great movie, wonderful music, good storyline and the history is actually very close.  Next time Michael Mann, if it ain't broke don't fix it.  ""Ali"" was very broken, maybe you should try and fix that movie.",1291766400,20,3499,4.445839874411303

I've watched it many times on regular DVD and the expanded DVD version. Now to the Bluray version. This is a very dark movie. Much of it is was filmed at night, at dawn, or at dusk. The daylight scenes of this on bluray look wonderful. It's sharp, black level is nice, and the colors really pop. With the many darker scenes, not so much. Definition suffers. It's very difficult at times to see any facial expressions and colors seem to smear a bit. Shadow detail is pretty bad. The sound mix is good, not great. Again an improvement over the standard DVD, but not by much. It has it's moments but it's not a very consistent or dynamic mix. Dialogue is a bit low at times.

This is without a doubt the best this film has ever looked and, I might add, one of the best HD transfers I have ever seen for any movie. I was a little wary of buying this due to some of the negative reviews about the transfer, so I went ahead and got it from Netflix first. I must say that whoever thinks this transfer is worse than the DVD is completely efing nuts. Sorry but you are. Go check yourself into the mental ward because you need help. I am not an expert about film transfers, but I do a lot of amateur photography so I can truly say that there is nothing I would improve with this transfer. Let me say it again--there is NOTHING improve about this transfer. You can disagree with me all you want; I couldn't care less. The contrast and saturation are both perfect--the colors just pop and everything is amazinly bright and crisp. The black levels are normal, ie. they haven't been given a face-lift like on the DVD, but for the amount of whining some people have done you would think it's a bad thing. Guess what? On my 52"" Samsung the blacks look rich and detailed and perfect. Much better than the DVD.

I just barely watched this on DVD a little while ago so I was just planning of renting the blu-ray and watching it a bit to check out the transfer. But I could not stop watching, it was so gorgeous. I literally could not tear myself away. I was completely enthralled for two hours. There are not many movies that have that kind of magic. With the HD transfer, I felt like I was watching an entirely new movie and that I was right there in the action. I am not a noob to HD, in fact I have been watching HD movies since 2007. Again, this is an amazing transfer and as long as you aren't watching it on a crappy HDTV with poor black levels, I can promise you your jaw will drop as you watch. And let's be clear, the whole movie isn't filmed at night. There are five, maybe six scenes at night, but they all looked fantastic to my eyes. I just don't get why people are complainging about this transfer. The saytime shots are even more beautiful and there were several scenes (Gen. Monroe's surrender where the two armies march out, the battle in the glen, for example) that had me totally floored with how crisp and rich the colors and details were, particularly on the flags and uniforms.

Anyway, I can't say enough about how good this transfer is. Don't believe the whiners on this one. It's completely amazing.

P.S. One minor quibble-- I was annoyed that they changed the Clannad song to some weird language version. It didn't feel right at all. Better no song than a butchered one. I think we all just want the original back, are you listening Michael?",1288915200,2,2752,4.327519379844961
3011967,5,B000Y5CHIE,"1 Blu-ray disc, released October 5, 2010

""The Last of the Mohicans"" was directed by Michael Mann and loosely based on the book by James Fenimore Cooper. The director and writers felt the novel was too simple and inaccurate to the times so they took it up a notch. The story is about three trappers who fight to protect the daughters of a British Colonel during the French and Indian War.

Daniel Day-Lewis plays Hawkeye who was raised by the Mohicans in their ways. The last Mohican, Chingachgook was played by Russell Means who was the first national director of the American Indian Movement and was in the 1973 standoff with the US government at Wounded Knee. Dennis Banks who played Ongewasgone was another member of this movement. The casting director and director really wanted authenticity in the movie and felt that these two would really add to the genuineness of the film by playing out their heritage.

The British are asking the Colonials who live off the land and fend for themselves to fight for the British in the war and give the guarantee that they will be allowed to go back and defend their homes if the battle goes there, a promise which is broken. Hawkeye refuses to get involved from the beginning, but when his group comes upon a war party targeting the daughters of Col. Munro, he saves them and later begins a relationship with the elder daughter, Cora played by Madeleine Stowe. Her sister, Alice is played by Jodhi May. Later the two are kidnapped by Huron Magua played by Wes Studi and pursued over great distances by the Mohicans (""I will find you!!"").

What this movie excels in is excitement, beauty in nature, demonstrating the raw bravery of the time fending for yourself in the wilderness, and the musical scores are neverending, gorgeous, and will NOT get out of your head for DAYS afterward. It had five wins and 10 nominations for Awards that year, winning the Oscar for Best Sound and some British acting awards for Daniel Day-Lewis.

Special Features:

This is a great film to get the Blu-ray treatment. Look at the scenery!! Once the camera pans over in this widescreen format and you get a good look at those mountains and trees and dudes running uphill with their guns with the music swelling up, it's all movie magic. My only complaints would be that in dark scenes, the Blu-ray does not adapt 100% and gets confused. My particular Blu-ray had a meltdown after the long series of dark scenes between Hawkeye and Cora and I spent a long time trying to re-load it. The Blu-ray has director commentary with Michael Mann which goes over a lot of the same information in the making-of feature but also talks about more details like locations, how hard they were to get to, the challenges of using natural lighting, etc.

The Making of Feature includes interviews with actors, the director, the casting director, and sound/score people. They spend a great deal of time on the story and why it was so important to deviate from the book in the manner they did and also how they cast the roles and the training that took place. Daniel Day-Lewis had to complete a survivalist bootcamp, learn how to fire a gun, and load it while running uphill. They knew from his infamous method acting in ""My Left Foot"" that he would take everything to heart and just be Hawkeye during the shoot. The score is based off a Celtic tune that the director's wife heard one day and they decided based on Hawkeye's heritage that they wanted to use it with some variations. The interviews appear fresh and are in high-definition. This is a great one to pick up for fans of this film and nature in general. The last time I saw this movie was on a VHS tape so it'll blow your mind.",1288483200,,3690,4.598784194528875
3011968,5,B000Y5CHIE,Product was surprisingly satisfying.  The director cut a little and added a little.  Much more like the theatrical release.,1288483200,,123,5.421052631578948
3011969,3,B000Y5CHIE,"I really wanted this Blu-ray for the DTS sound, but it came up mute. There was normal audio on the commentary track, the menu, and the supplements, but, the moment I hit Play, all sound disappeared (I have a DTS amp, obviously, but neither the Dolby nor DTS setting would work). It was still gone when I stopped the disc and then resumed. I finally discovered, by accident, that if I started the movie, changed the input on my amp (an Onkyo) to something else, and then returned to the film, that sound appeared. However, it was of very low volume compared to any DTS disc I've ever heard. I don't know if this is a mismatch between equipment, or an authoring error, but I'm going with the latter (no other Blu-ray disc has ever done this).
  BTW, I also thought the film looked unusually dark, even in the daylight scenes, although the images were crisp. I think I'll look for a region 2 Blu-ray.",1288051200,3,897,4.430303030303031
3011970,1,B000Y5CHIE,This item is another example of transferring dvd content directly to a blu-ray disk and then marketing it as being of blu-ray high definition quality--- IT IS NOT.  The image quality is less than the image quality of Last of the Mohicans on a dvd played on a up-conversion dvd player.  The color is so poor(low chroma) that it appears to have actually been copied from an old VHS master where much of the data has vanished over time. The quality of this item is pathetic when compared to any real blu-ray mastered item.  I am really offended to be scamed like this again!,1287792000,8,571,4.471153846153846
3011971,5,B000Y5CHIE,"I have had many blu rays come into my home that I was unsatisfied with and returned or sold on Amazon, This will DEFINITELY not be one of those. This movie is from the early 90's and was filmed in a lot of natural lighting, therefor you can not expect to have the same picture as lets say """"TROY"" or ""Pirates of the Caribbean. Fact of the matter is that the standard DVD quality was not the best in the first place, actually if you ever see this movie on TV or a premium channel in HD, there is never a good picture, its actually quit terrible, but not on this blu ray, the picture captures the moment and the audio is so clear I heard things Ive never heard before. There was alot of reviews claiming when its dark it looks terrible, well that may be because of your TV or DVD/Blu ray player, Because I have a Samsung 700 Series and a Sony Blu Ray player and this movie looked amazing, and I am one who returned ""Gladiator"" because the first release of it used DNR and EE recording quality and it looked terrible, not the case here!  I will be keeping this and recommending it to many who love this movie but were steered away by the reviews!",1287705600,5,1143,4.171945701357466
3011972,4,B000Y5CHIE,"I have viewed the VHS and every DVD that has been issued. And never bought this movie. However when I saw the Blue Ray I bought it. I had read all bad reviews. Then one night while watching HD TV saw the end of a show that told about Mann looking at old paintings. Noticing the shadows and the darkness in the woods. So he made it as real as he couldon Blu-Ray.
The HD sound track is just a bit better than the normal DD.I have a way I can switch back and forth from HD and normal fiber optics. Newer movies like Robin hood and Iron Man 2 a huge differance.  But it is still a wonderfull movie. Glad I bought it. Good deal, its $24.99 at Best Buy when I picked it up.
I'm watching on a Panasonic Plasma which handles black levels much better than a LCD
which could be why we are seeing so many saying its too dark. A person with a new LED HD TV should have a wonderful viewing of this movie. Of course Plasma viewers will love this movie.",1287532800,4,938,3.9893617021276597
3011973,4,B000Y5CHIE,"Michael Mann's obsession with ""The Last of the Mohicans"" began with seeing a 16mm print of the 1936 version of the film. In bringing his version of the story to the screen Mann relied less on James Fennimore Cooper's novel combining it with the authentic feel of the time and more realistic characters with greater depth (particularly for the Indians)in his classic 1992 take on the same tale.

This is the third version of the film to appear. In 2001 Mann revisited his theatrical cut and re-edited it altering the pacing for some scenes and adding three minutes to the film (primarily to the sequence set at the Fort). This ""Director's Definitive Cut"" adheres more closely to the original theatrical version although there are still some minor differences (bits of dialogue dropped, some alternate shots substituted)and Mann has restored Clannard's song to the film during Hawkeye's pursuit of Magua.

The big issue seems to be how dark this transfer is. Shot using natural light the look here is closer to the original theatrical version of the film than the DVD where contrast was boosted. The daylight sequences look marvelous with colors bolder, richer and foilage a deeper green than before capturing the feel of being in the forest but it's the night time scenes (and there a lot of those) that are more problematic. While our eyes can adjust to the dark, they can't do that when watching a film set in the dark particular where fine detail, resolution and clarity are buried in the murky depths of some of the sequences here. Mann and those who supervised the Telecine transfer would have done well to increase the contrast here for those who purchase this edition. You'll have to do it manually and while it does improve the darkest sequences it also impacts the sequences set in the daylight losing much of what is gained in those sequences.

For Fox and Mann ""The Last of the Mohicans"" should be a do-over; the darker sequences lose much of their power because, quite honestly, even with contrast boosted you can't always make out all the action. I realize that using natural light was the intent of Mann but even for Blu-ray the presentation here is  a challenge as it doesn't have quite the resolution of seeing it on film in a theater and there are going to be variable viewing conditions that will impact the look of the film on Blu-ray.

I can cautiously recommend the film but suggest you may want to rent it first to see if this edition will fit your home viewing environment, monitor and if your eyesight is able to make out the fine detail in the darkests sequences. It tends to be more problematic early on during the sequence where the French raiding party is pursuing Hawkeye and his band after they discover the ruined farm house attacked by the raiding party.

Luckily Fox has given us a nice group of extras here none of which were included on the previous DVD edition. We get an intelligent commentary from Mann discussing the making of the film covering everything from casting to his decision to shoot the film in natural light.

We also get a three part (divided into acts)documentary that runs just under 43 minutes focusing on the origin of the film, casting, location shooting and the military school the extras had to endure to create the authentic air including Daniel Day-Lewis undergoing paramilitary training for his role. There are plenty of interviews including Day-Lewis, Mann, Stowe, composer Trevor Jones (who contrary to rumors wasn't fired--Randy Edelman was brought on board because Mann's constant recutting of the film and his decision to go with a natural vs. electronic score forced Jones to bring on someone to help him compose/arrange additional musical cues), the military advisors and others.

We also get the original teaser and theatrical trailers presented from a video SD source.

While the extras are exceptionally good, I have to question Mann's decision to present the film this way as most monitors will have to be adjusted during the film to appreciate the film during the nighttime sequences. As mentioned, I'd suggest renting first to see if this version might be too dark for you (particularly given how bright the DVD was which didn't faithfully reproduce the dark look of the theatrical presentation). I've docked the film a star for the presentation which should have been done a bit more carefully.",1287273600,12,4369,4.845844504021447
3011974,4,B000Y5CHIE,"I don't see any of the problems the previous reviews of the blu-ray list and I have a top-of-the-line Sony system.  Yes, it is a little dark, but that coincides with Mann's vision of using natural light.  I don't see a tint at all.  I had low expectations for this release, given the reviews on here, but I must say, I was not displeased with my purchase.  This is one of my favorite movies of the 90's and it looks and sounds so much better than my DVD version.  Maybe rent it before you buy it if you're skeptical, but I think the people who talk about a tint need to check the settings on their system.",1287273600,3,605,4.136752136752137

We got it and watched it the same day it arrived.  Horrible!  Most of the scenes are so dark you can't see what is going on on the screen.  The scenes that are not dark are so distorted color wise.  Every scene has a yellow hue.  We will revert to our DVD and put this Blu-Ray aside.  We have duplicated many of our DVD's with Blu-Ray and this is the first disappointment.",1287187200,7,528,4.262626262626263
3011976,4,B000Y5CHIE,"I am nearly at the end of watching this movie received it today, have to say I am very impressed with not only the picture quality but also the surround sound, the film maker has obviously keept the use of the rear channels to a minimum as they only kick into life for dramatic effect, mainly during the action scenes.

True I would have loved to have had both this version along with the theatrical version but you can not have it all your own way no matter how much we would wish.

I can not see a problem with the picture - if I hadn't seen the making off first I may have had an issue but seeing as the director made a point of stating he wanted natural lighting hence nothing is really lit, the night time scenes reflect this natural environment, ie only limited candle lighting, or reflections from camp fires etc, this makes more sence and the daylight scenes are outstanding,I was worried before I put this on as I had read a few reviews complaining about picture quality, nonsense this is nowhere near anything like the worst blu ray picture out there far from it, Django still holds that honour for me.

if you love this movie and you love blu ray buy it, I do think some people should really get their kit sorted out or like myself purchase a new set of glasses.

However, the color in this BluRay presentation is not good. Much worse than the DVD and theater release. Darker, inaccurate, and unpleasant to the eye. There are exceptions. The officer uniforms and the flags at the surrender negotiations are in full magnificent color, but the surrounding scene is muted and ugly. The scene, early on, where the carriage crosses the Biltmore
Estate bridge, is so muted and so lacking in contrast as to be nearly unwatchable. What a shame. I'll stick with the DVD of this magnificent movie and be totally content. Skip the Blu-Ray edition is my recommendation.",1287014400,9,689,5.0
3011978,2,B000Y5CHIE,"Last of the Mohicans is one of my top ten favorite movies so I was very excited to get this in Blu-Ray.  Unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed.  Most of us fans recall seeing this movie in the theaters and fondly remember the stunning panoramic scenes.  I was expecting breathtaking blu-ray quality. Unfortunately, the picture doesn't look any better in most instances than an upscaled DVD.  After telling my wife about how great the visuals were in the movie, I was quite frankly embarrased as we watched it.

This version adds back many of the deleted parts from the theatrical version.  So I'd say it's mostly like the theaterical versions except with a few additions.  However there are still minor things missing that most fans will easily remember from the original theatrical release. Here's a list of differences:

(1) Still missing is the line:  ""Haven't you got anything better to do on the lake today, Major?""
(2) Still missing:  Uncas says: Too easy to track; they'd be heard for miles missisng is the final part: ""Find yourself a musket.""
(3) The BR retains the Clannad song over the chase scene but the lyrics aren't exactly the same (that is the song is used but the parts of the song used are different which is better than the DVD version, but still not what we fans wanted).
(4) The preachy last lines of Chingachgook are eliminated leaving the preferred ending.
(5) The line where Hawkeye says he heads to the North then suddenly turns left is added but the final line in that part of the dialog ""clear it up any"" is missing.

I also believe the fight scenes were edited.  Some of the cuts look poorly made and not as I remember them.",1286928000,10,1657,4.636986301369863
3011979,2,B000Y5CHIE,"Last of the Mohicans is one of my favorite movies, it is sad to see such a butcher job on this bluray release.  For starters the picture is average at best.  It doesn't look like typical bluray and quite honestly doesn't look much better than what a good DVD can do.  The dark scenes are far too dark and there are many scenes that have a strange yellow tint.  Many of the scenery scans  are filled with grain.  The picture quality unfortunately is the better part, the sound is far worse.  The sound is flat and hollow.  There is no depth to the sound quality and the balance is also off.  It goes from barely hear able audio speech to ear piercing gun shots within seconds.  There are a few times where there is clearly suppose to be sounds but there are none, but rather silence.  So far I haven't picked on the biggest flaw which is the apparent lack of surround sound...  yes I am being honest here.  I watched the movie last night on my surround (Onkyo Reciever, Klipsch Speakers) and 90% of the sound comes out the center while the other 10% is from the fronts.  The rear speakers were dead silent the entire time.  I routinely watch bluray and game (360 and ps3) and my system is hooked up properly.  Hell it is even calibrated.  I was shocked, this movie even during large battle scenes features no rear speaker noise.  The quality is simply piss poor.  I honestly can't get over how poor the sound is.  Mario Galaxy on the Wii using RCA cables sounds better.

As for the movie itself, I noticed 1 added scene which fit and the speech at the end has been shortened, everything else seemed to be left online.  Overall the movie is still an excellent movie but the quality of the bluray release is horrid.  It is easily the worst bluray movie I have watched to date.",1286928000,16,1773,4.3547400611620795

3011982,3,B000Y5CHIE,"My review is based on The Director's Cut DVD. And like most of the other reviews, ""The Last of the Mohicans"" was one of my favorite movies, having owned the widescrean VHS version. I was delighted to get the director's cut on DVD, but ultimately disappointed with the results. I liked some of the new scenes that were added that explianed things that you could only guess at, such as the main characters meeting with the Cameron's at the beginning. That sequence works better than the original. But the rest of the film with bits and pieces of dialog dropped (such as sarcastic comments between Duncan Hayward and Hawkeye) I found that they lost its bite. But the biggest disappointment was (the same as other reviewers) cutting out the Clannad song ""I Will Find You"" (which was one of my favorite parts), yet leaving the song listed in the end credits which makes no sence at all. I didn't mind the extra dialog at the end, although I agree that the original ending is perfect.

I am familiar with director Michael Mann's work, especially coming from his work with the television series ""Miami Vice"", and that's why I thought that parts of ""The Last of the Mohicans"" played like a music video. And the climatic fight sequence is one of the best sequences in recent film history. ""The Last of the Mohicans"" won the Oscar for best sound, but the music, the cinematography, art direction and set direction and costumes were equally as impressive. Daniel Day Lewis is excellent as Hawkeye, but sometimes he was a bit over the top. Wes Studi as Magua turned in an award winning performance that was ignored.

The bottom line however is that director Michael Mann should have left well enough alone. Like myself included, the original version is an all around fan favorite.",1286668800,4,1768,4.7

Especially on the day scenes with wide landscapes and the final scene of the film. The sound quality on a surround sound system is brilliant. The battle scene really make you feel like you are in the middle of a war. For the low price offered on this site I would high recommend all fans of this film to buy the Blu Ray. One of the greatest deals I've had in a long time.,1286668800,,537,4.0754716981132075
3011984,3,B000Y5CHIE,"I've been awaiting this excellent movie on Blu-ray since High Definition discs were released.  Not only is it an outstanding movie, but you can read web sites full of information on how accurately this movie depicts the era.  It is beautifully shot and looks stunning on-screen.

Which is why it's hard to give one of my few 5-star movies a 3-star Blu-ray rating.

WITHOUT ADJUSTMENT, SCENES ARE TOO DARK ON BLU-RAY
The nighttime scenes  (which is half the movie) were too dark to enjoy. Facial nuances and a great deal of the interaction was completely lost in the darkness of every scene that didn't take place in absolute daylight. Even the scene when Hawkeye comes back to the Cameron cabin the second time (which was a daylight scene), was too dark to make out any details until things brightened a bit later in the scene.

I removed the Blu-ray and put in both the U.S. and the U.K. DVD versions just to make sure I wasn't just seeing things. And both of the DVD versions were infinitely easier to view and make out details.

This is the first and only BD I've had to radically adjust my gamma values to restore the nuances of the nighttime scenes.  So, the information is there (on the Blu-ray), but the default viewing experience is way too dark.

For non-videophiles or those who don't have a professionally calibrated setup, jack up your Blu-ray player's gamma value (or brightness if you can't find your Gamma setting) to make sure you don't miss out on half the movie.

DIRECTOR'S DEFINITIVE CUT
For those who prefer the theatrical version of the movie to Michael Mann's Director's Cut, you'll be pleased.  Although this is a new and different edit, most of the elements sadly removed from the theatrical version have been restored here.  Some additional scenes previously available only in Director's Cut are welcome in this version since they don't come at the cost of the scenes previously removed in the Director's Version.  For the curious, these include the minor goofs noticed only by a picky few (one's yellow, the other ripples).  Either way, neither take away from the particular scenes nor the overall movie.

This is a great version that brings the best from the previously-released versions into one.  Be sure to increase your gamma values for this disc to enjoy it fully.",1286668800,14,2297,4.762626262626263

At least the Blu-ray disc isn't terribly expensive, so it's only a small waste of money. I'm not sure I'll ever watch it again. I'll probably go back to watching the film on DVD, especially if the Clannad song is back in the Blu-ray version. (I've not gotten that far yet.) I frankly hated the song, so much so that I would mute the audio when it came on, and was glad it was gone from the DVD.

Any scene that takes place inside, with natural lighting, is ruined by this transfer. To give you an idea of just how dark this transfer is, remember the scene where the Indians attack the British column early in the film? Right before the attack, Magua walks down the length of the column and as he's walking, he draws his weapon and strikes a green British soldier who smiles at him. This transfer is so dark, you can't even see the look on this kid's face. If I was the cinematographer, Dante Spinotti, I would be very angry about this transfer. I watched the first 25 minutes of the movie and turned it off in frustration. It's too bad because I was enjoying Michael Mann's great commentary.

However, this release has a very dark appearance (i.e. absence of light) in many scenes as if filmed under a heavy cloud cover. It also has a yellowish tint in many scenes. Increasing the brightness level by 100% on my professionally calibrated 65"" plasma couldn't fix the lack of light issue and the yellow tint makes the film look old. If these problems are due to a poor HD mastering process, the disc should by recalled and a ""fixed"" version reissued. If due to the ""directors intent"" I think he screwed up. I don't appreciate a movie that looks like it was actually filmed in 1757 and kept in a box someplace until this release.

3011988,4,B000Y5CHIE,"The Film

I haven't seen this flick in years so it was a surprise when the credits finally showed up.  What an amazing film.  It's been said, and I will retort, this is quite a feat for a watchable film to be made from the sprawling novel, let alone such an earthy piece of filmmaking.  This film succeeds on so many levels, and simplicity is a key reason.  Music, acting and excitement; anything you can think of Michael Mann has turned out in force.  And let's not forget about drama.  The sight of Chingachgook reacting to Uncas' death is one you will never forget.  It's powerful stuff.

Now for the Blu-Ray report.  I never picked this one up on DVD, because of the ""Expanded"" edition and I have no clue to what the changes have been for this one.  Frankly, I don't care.  The movie holds up.  The problem with the Blu-Ray is multi-fold.  Sound recording is flat.  The foley is often subdued, which isn't a problem.  But music and voices are muted too - which is a problem.  I had to do some tweaking on my surround to get the best out of it.  Also, the TrueHD audio track IS NOT surround enabled.  I found the option surround track to be superior.

The Blu-Ray

Now for the video.  I am a photographer by trade and I have always held Dante Spinotti's work in the Last of the Mohican's to be among my favorites.  Blu-Ray often has two effects, the first being an enhancement of quality.  On the right screen, you are allowed to see textures, color and details cheated in lesser formats - example.. You can now see rain falling in the cliff chase finally, which I had never noticed before.  The second effect of High Def is there is no longer a mask for photographic flaws.  I will get the grain issue out of the way first saying, there is some grain present, but never to the point of distraction.  However, Last of the Mohicans is plagued by some degree by missed focus.  This is understandable to some level.  Spinotti has often been challenged by Michael Mann's desire to shoot in low light.  Using Panavision it is notoriously difficult to maintain proper focus with wide apertures - that is with times when a shallow depth of field is present.  But there are scenes in plain daylight where the stock just looks either cropped in, or focus has been completely missed.  This issue was distracting.  Inconsistent color processing was also an issue - be it digital or in the celluloid emulsion.  There are times colors bleed with intensity - almost too much.  Where other times - it feels desaturated.

So while the film is a definite 10/10, I would rate the audio a 7/10 and the video a similar 7/10.  This is not a disc that will consistently show off your setup to friends.

All that being said, this is one hell of a movie.  Visual blemishes be damned.  You all can keep your Braveheart discs, I'll take Last of the Mohicans any day of the week.",1286323200,15,2855,4.436293436293436

The acting, directing, soundtrack, and shot locations for this film (as well as the best French and Indian War film ever) are an unbelievable combination, and it's a crime it took years for this to come out on Blu-Ray.

This movie was my first Blu-Ray purchase, as I always promised myself this would be my first venture into it.  I can't tell you if this is better or worse than other Blu-Ray movies, but let's compare it to the DVD.  Actually, we can't because it's that much better than the horrible quality of the DVD.  For years I've had to deal with the horrible lighting, the super soft sound where my volume is set at 82 out of 100, and the fact they took out a lot of neat scenes.

I was in awe being able to see the movie finally in amazing quality and look forward to one day getting surround sound.  For those that like the theatrical version, you'll love the movie.  However, I'm still ticked off at Michael Mann.

It's almost like Michael Mann has this obsession that LOTM cannot exceed two hours in length.  While he put in many of the theatrical cuts, he also removed almost all of the good content from the Director's Cut on the DVD.  What makes no sense to me, is some of it, such as the parlay scene between the French and the British were left untouched.  However, the fort battle scenes featuring Duncan were cut, as was the very emotional speech given at the end by Hawkeye's father which perfectly wrapped up the movie.

I cannot fathom why Michael Mann couldn't just put both versions together and instead had to tinker.  For those who really know the movie, you'll also notice the sequence of Magaua and the Sachem converse has changed to where it just seems very awkward.

In the end, if you love this movie, you must buy the Blu-Ray.  Despite the fact that Mann did not put together a true Definitive cut, this is light years better than the DVD.  I just really had hopes that when this was the ""Director's Definitive Cut"", he would have stood by that and just put both versions together, and maybe added a few deleted scenes.

I personally will be interested to see what happens now that the Blu-Ray transfer if complete.  If this movie sells well, I can at least hope they could possibly release another more expanded edition as there were rumors this was going to be a three hour version.",1286323200,12,2452,4.408888888888889
3011990,5,B000Y5CHIE,"This review refers to the Blu-ray of The Last of the Mohicans, ""The Director's Definitive Cut."" Be advised.

The Movie: The Last of the Mohicans is an old favorite of mine and many of my friends. This ""definitive cut"" is new, and is the third cut of the film to see daylight. It seems to incorporate sizeable chunks of the extra footage from the ""Expanded"" edition on standard DVD while jettisoning a lot of footage from the same and including some deleted parts of the theatrical cut, but not all. Comparison showed few significant differences between this cut and the two preceding it; most of the changes came in editing (the battle scenes have all been tweaked a bit) and in shot selection. The good news is it's still The Last of the Mohicans, and it's still a fantastic movie.

The Image: Reviewers elsewhere on the internet have complained about softness or excessive darkness in this Blu-ray's image. After watching the whole thing, I think such complaints are exaggerated. There are a number of soft scenes but the majority of the film is very sharp and the detail is a vast improvement from the standard definition DVD. The massacre after the surrender of the fort and the climactic fight on the mountainside look especially good. As for darkness, a good chunk of the film does take place at night or in dense forest, and there were no dark scenes in the Blu-ray that were not already dark on VHS or DVD. Darkness in some scenes--especially the forest ambush on the road to Fort William Henry--is certainly intentional and (speaking as a native of the area in which the movie was filmed) realistic. Rhododendron thickets are dark. Especially after comparison with the old DVD, this Blu-ray is solid.

The Sound: As far as I can tell with my rather low-budget sound system, the mix on this Blu-ray was very good. The music especially boomed and the reports of weapons were very loud. There were one or two scenes in which the dialogue was rather muddy, such as the scene in which Hawkeye and the escapees of the massacre hide behind the waterfall, but that seems to have been intentional.

Special Features: The commentary by Michael Mann is good and packed with information, both about the film and the historical period in which the film takes place. Mann clearly researched this subject deeply and his commentary is worth listening to. The Blu-ray also includes a very good 40+ minute ""making of."" Lots and lots of good interviews with cast, crew, and consultants, as well as behind-the-scenes footage. The background on Daniel Day-Lewis's preparation for his role was especially informative.

Miscellaneous Complaint: The one thing in the whole package that gets on my nerves is that, in order to access the chapter menu either during the movie or from the main menu, you have to select ""Search"" from the menu and then choose ""Scenes,"" an unnecessary extra step and an annoyance. That's a minor complain, though.

Overall, this Blu-ray does justice to a great movie and was worth the money.

Well Michael Mann has really come through on the Blu Ray release and has restored the movie back to the way it was meant to be...as was seen in the theatres.  All of the lines from the original taken out have been put back in (including the song by clannad!) with only a few minor changes.

If you ask me, Mann's recut edition of Last of the Mohicans is not better in any way.  The music, which is beautiful, was edited brilliantly to the images.

Cora talking to Hawkeye, alot of the dialogue is there but there's one part where she says ""what?"" After he says ""don't try to make them understand you.."" that's cut out.

3246168,5,B000Y5CHIE,"I do not own this DVD nor do I own any of the others but I recently had the privilege of watching the original theatrical release in 35mm back-to-back with a digital cinema projection of what I believe was the definitive directors cut and I too noticed the differences in image brightness and contrast and changes in the audio track and since I'm seeing this as a trend in a lot of comments, then I know with some certainty that these changes were made intentionally. While I'm not sure if these changes were purely due to considerations for recent technology and home theatre advancements, the fact remains that no matter how bright you set your television or how loud you make your sound system, changes were definitely made that remove detail from the picture and lessen the impact of the musical score (at least until the ending). All these changes essentially create a completely different picture from the original and I would argue might be the best version (if not just the most mature). The reduction in color saturation, the darkening of the images, and the lowering of the bass during some of the musical moments all comes together to tone down the sexiness, excessive emotion and mtv viscera. What you're left with is a more even tempered and cerebral and meditative (but no less stirring or entertaining) viewing experience. If you're hoping to relive the experience from the first time you saw this in the theatre, you might be disappointed. However, if you want to see a well-aged more mature revision of a Michael Mann masterpiece, this is definitely worth owning.",1508716800,,1580,4.8125

3246201,5,B000Y5CHIE,"This review is for people like me who've seen this and are wondering which version to buy.

I grew up watching the Theatrical Release; by now the VHS is worn to shreds and I don't even have a VHS player anymore. A few years ago, hoping to replace it, I bought the Director's Expanded Edition. It feels like a different movie: the pacing, flow between scenes, even character development - they're all different from what I'd loved for years.

In the Expanded Edition, key dialogue is missing between nearly all the characters, muddying their motivations. Magua's motivations are also muddier, the actions of the French are less clear, and the over-all thread of the politically-charged situation between the French, British, and the Indian peoples who sided with either of them feels disjointed. It's a choppy cut. It takes out vital moments between Nathaniel and Cora, and it feels to me like it further pushes Uncas and Chingachgook back as supporting characters by reducing little moments with both of them, when honestly they should have more screen time than they do in any version. It seems like most of the added time was for the fort fight scenes. Yes, they built an actual fort and probably used actual canons to blow it up, but it feels like filler in any other typical Hollywood action movie. That's the greatest insult I can give to it. This edition made it mundane. tl;dr - don't buy the DVD.

The Definitive Cut on Blu-ray is a different matter. While it isn't quite the same as the Theatrical, it's so, so much closer. The storyline isn't disjointed anymore, and they've cut back on the ridiculously long fort siege scenes in favor of adding dialogue back in. The sound quality is also stellar in comparison to the Expanded Edition (and my highly degraded VHS, ha). It's beautifully crisp and nicely color-balanced, to boot.

My advice? Get the blu-ray. The only thing the Expanded Edition has that I miss is a gorgeous capstone speech at the end by Chingachgook (Russell Means), which is greatly reduced in the Definitive, but you can probably see that on Youtube.",1484524800,115,2079,4.798882681564246

Watching this blu-ray on my hi-def tv was perhaps the worst I ever recall seeing it. The night scenes were the worst I've ever seen in any movie. The colors in the fire light seemed like an old Disney animation (sorry, only way I can describe it). If you have it on VHS or DVD...... don't bother upgrading even if it's only $5.

I am searching for the original version of this movie,  with the song in it,  which I have somewhere on VHS.  I admit I had no idea they could make so many changes to a movie when you buy it on DVD.  How is anyone supposed to know if they are getting the real movie or not when it is bought on DVD or Blu Ray?  It's a real eye opener,  especially for those of us that no longer go to theatres to watch a movie,  but wait for the DVD/Blu Ray version to come out.

3246303,4,B000Y5CHIE,"I would love to give this one 5 stars. The movie is excellent, a classic, the picture quality is superb, if a bit dark, the audio is quite... dynamic (like any Michael Mann movie), and the extras are solid. All in all, I am quite pleased with this product. Many have expounded on the changes director Michael Mann has made, reediting the movie to improve little tiny things here and there. Nothing drastic. Never straying too far from the original theatrical version. Having not seen the theatrical version, I can't compare this version and that one, but the experience of watching this movie was definitely just like any movie; that is to say, the editing is just fine.

There's just one problem. One small, tiny problem. A miniscule imperfection so jarring it's infuriating.

Spoilers.

When the British are marching back wherever it is they happen to be going, having just surrendered the fort to les franais, and they're attacked; Magua, the brilliantly acted, developed, and written antagonist of the film, hidden in the shroud of the forest with his army of frightfully aggressive Hurons, creeping alongside the ragged, exhausted troops and the innocent women and children, sees Colonel Monroe, his sworn enemy. The camera pans in, Magua looks ready to kill some Yengeese, and he raises up his arm and shouts a frightful war cry, which the others Hurons quickly join in. Everyone is scared, all hell breaks loose, etc. etc.

Or at least that's how it goes in the other versions. I know because I compared them on YouTube. In this version, it suddenly cuts away from Magua before he's even begun to raise his arm. It was such an unexpectedly bad, poorly considered, contrary-to-apparent-original-directorial-intent, and noticeable flaw in the editing, I'm forced to subtract a star. Four stars. How does that feel, Mr. Mann?",1428451200,10,1829,4.967320261437909

3246325,5,B000Y5CHIE,"Last of the Mohicans centers around a band of Mohawks caught in the middle of a war between the French and the English where Indian forces are pitted against each other for the gains of the colonial powers. The social political setting revolves around the love story between white, adopted son of the Mohawks, Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his love for Cora (Madeline Stowe). This story is a foundational fiction for the North American continent.
 Whilst we get a sense of life and history in the late 18th century, we are also given main characters that represent more than just themselves. Hawkeye, a transplant of the native culture, falls in love with a proper Englishwoman, and daughter of a general of the British military. Their story is predictable, we know from the beginning that these two will unite in the story and fall in love. However, they are faced with outside forces that will try and thwart their chances of falling in love. In this film, the forces of war, Coras father, and an officer of the British military who loves Cora, are all things that are working against the two lovers being together. The love represents the coming together of people of the land and people of aristocracy. The lovers are from different socio-economic backgrounds, but their relationship paves the way for mingling in-between classes to find love, and to progress. This only works for the white people however.
 There is another narrative of love in the story, between Uncas (Eric Schweig) and Coras sister Alice (Jodhi May). Uncas is a Mohawk; because of this his chance to be with the white military daughter is significantly less from the start. They too are plagued with the same forces as Hawkeye and Cora that hinder them from falling in love, but these characters do not over come their obstacles in the end. Uncas is killed, and Alice takes her life shortly after. Representing the idea that on the North American continent, it was not an acceptable to have intercultural marriage with Natives and Europeans. There are no mestisos. Their love from the beginning was doomed because of the ideals of the time in this area, and their deaths represent the inability of the North Americans to fully co-exist with Natives.
 This storys foundational fiction aspects sets it characters to represent a larger part of the North American continent at the time. While love can be forged, it is still limited to the privileged: the whites.",1417737600,,2435,4.862650602409639

The original theatrical version of ""Last of the Mohicans"" has to be one of my favourite films. It has everything, including heart-stopping action and a marvellously developed romance between the two leading stars. I would have readily given this film five stars for the original Warner Brothers DVD version which also appears to have been the original theatrical version. It is unfortunate that the Blu-ray falls well below the standard set by the original DVD. The darker scenes in the Blu-ray version are much darker than in the earlier DVD and could fairly be described as muddy. Other reviewers have pointed out that important pieces of dialogue have been omitted from the Blu-ray version.

Also, I wish the soundtrack were a good-deal louder, especially the dialogue -- and I don't like listening to really loud soundtracks, such as at the movie theater (where I always use earplugs).

3246351,5,B000Y5CHIE,"Leave it to Michael Mann, creator of ""Miami Vice"", the quintessential 1980's chic cop drama, to wipe away centuries' worth of dust and must from James Fenimore Cooper's ""The Last of the Mohicans"" and uncover the still beating heart of an action adventure film within. His exhilarating film is replete with chases, gun battles and a deeply felt and genuinely adult love story as well as an appreciation of nature that a charter member of Greenpeace could endorse.
The deep woods of North Carolina are perhaps the only place in the country that could successfully evoke the forest primeval of pre-Revolutionary War America (at least in 1992, when the film was made). No wonder Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe, currently starring in television's ""Revenge"") comments to her future lover Nathaniel/Hawkeye (Daniel Day Lewis) regarding her geographical as well as her emotional situation: ""It is more deeply stirring to my blood than any imagining could be."" Freed of the social constraints imposed on her in her role as a British colonel's elder unmarried daughter, Cora can return Nathaniel's male gaze with equally passionate intensity.
For Daniel Day Lewis, ""Mohicans"" marks the first fully realized American characterization by this Anglo-Irish actor who would span the emotional and political landscape of America from the Puritan rebel, John Proctor in ""The Crucible"" (1996) to our most beloved and highly regarded president in ""Lincoln"" (2012). In between those multi-faceted performances, Day Lewis would offer us such diverse Americans as Bill the Butcher, a Civil War racist and xenophobe in ""The Gangs of New York"" (2002), Newland Archer, an emotionally repressed New York aristocrat in the Gilded Age in ""The Age of Innocence"" (1993) and Daniel Plainview, a murderously sociopathic oil magnate at the turn of the 20th century in ""There Will Be Blood"" (2007). For DDL, America begins here.
Lewis's Nathaniel/Hawkeye is a prototypical American hero before there was a U.S. A. He is the bare-chested romantic ideal, a man of action with a variety of weapons, especially the long rifle (score one for the advocates of the Second Amendment) and yet he is also an exemplar of racial tolerance, if not integration (ACLU, take note), raised as he was among the Mohicans. The entire film exhibits a politically correct sensitivity to Native Americans and their attitudes toward the natural world of which they consider themselves a part, brothers even to dead deer. This attitude is reflected in the real deal casting of Russell Means as the title character and Wes Studi as a seriously terrifying, seriously well motivated Magua, the film's arch villain.
The cinematography of Dante Spinotti, riveting in all kinds of light, as well as the minutely accurate production design of Wolf Kroeger, make us believe that America was once an Eden where man lived in harmony with nature and oftentimes with each other; though there are tribal animosities and the presence of the imperial powers of Britain and France, there is also the spectacle of a Native American single father raising his blood son and his adopted American son as equals. Even the ancient trees seem fresh and new, dialectical elements in a film that is at once refreshingly old fashioned (there are scenes evocative of 2 John Ford films, ""Drums along the Mohawk"" (1939)- by virtue of the French and Indian War setting and ""The Searchers"" (1956),reflected in the discovery of the victims of an Indian massacre), and as contemporary as the latest discussions of imperialism and patriotism.
After a night spent with Nathaniel, Cora speaks truth to power in the person of her father, Colonel Munro, using revolutionary rhetoric. Her sister's nascent love affair with the Mohican Uncas is terminated by the death of each, but has elements of an interracial Romeo and Juliet to it. They are us, we are them.
Ultimately, ""The Last of the Mohicans"" throbs with romantic intensity, especially in the central performances of Day Lewis and Stowe and the pulsating score by Trevor Jones and Danny Elfman. Michael Mann directs with unrelenting energy and the Oscar-winning sound mix totally immerses the viewer in a long gone but amazingly recognizable world. 20th Century Fox has produced a Blu-ray of sharp imagery and piercing sound. Simply put, this Blu-ray rocks.",1405900800,,4313,5.1365576102418204

I find it too mainstream and to me it reveals mann's weak side: when it comes to politics and history, he's much more mainstream than when he deals with original character/plot driven films. Here you recognize its usual cinematographic touch, but it doesn't stick out as in Manhunter, Insider, Heat, Collateral. To me it's like Public Enemy: when he knows he can't work on history with as much freedom as he does when he works on stories, his movies become basic, too classic, and lose that magic touch where great narration and great cinema-style usually succeed resulting in a great mix of  humanistic storytelling, excellent visual and originality, al, well balanced. The Mann I like is dark but classic, maniacally well crafted but with a heart. Here he seems to be too respectful and focus on telling the story well, but I expected a less manicheistic and cliche approach to spa story wiphich could have been treated in a more provocative and personal way.",1402790400,,1017,4.811428571428571

3246370,3,B000Y5CHIE,"Based on James Fenimore Coopers novel about the British and French Colonial wars on the American Frontier in 1757  Michael Manns ""The Last Of The Mohicans"" is a 5-star blast of a movie with fabulous chemistry between its lead actors Daniel Day-Lewis (Nathaniel Hawkeye) and Madeleine Stowe (Cora Munro  a generals daughter). But no matter how much I love the 1992 movie or want it to be great on the new fangled format  I take exception to anyone suggesting that the ""Director's Definitive Cut"" on BLU RAY is 'stunning' to look at. That's just nonsense  it isnt.

Unfortunately the whole film seems afflicted with a sort of out-of-focus blurriness and lack of definition that infects scene after scene. Sure it looks clean in the daylight sequences - especially when Hawkeye and the power mad Magua (a sensationally good Wes Studi) go at it with hatchets on the mountain ridge at the end. The scene where Magua seeks the approval of the tribe elder and Hawkeye tries to reason with him  is superb too - gorgeous clarity. But other outdoor sequences (running through foliage) are just plain ordinary looking. And again there's huge parts of The Last Of The Mohicans - especially the interminably long night sequence in the centre of the film when General Munros Fort is being bombarded by French guns - when blocking and grain fill every shot to a point where it looks like a bad Eighties video.

Its defaulted to 2.4:1 aspect ratio (bars on the top and bottom)   but if you stretch it to semi or even full screen aspect  immediately the picture quality degrades  and the haziness of the focus returns.

The ""Director's Cut"" runs about 5 minutes longer than the Theatrical Version - and other good news is that theres all-new Making Of featurettes:

1. Act 1: Becoming Hawkeye
2. Act 2: A Love Story Between Hawkeye and Cora
3. Act 3: Bringing The Epic Story To Life

I gave this version of the film one star. If Michael Mann had truly cared enough about the fans of this film he would have wanted a Blu-Ray / DVD version to be a tribute. This was the last film my father and I saw together when it came out in the theaters before he died. It was my father's most favorite film. I had really wanted this version to remind me of those incredibly beautiful moments I shared with my father, where the story sucks you in and makes you feel you are there.

To say that this movie has some of the most beautiful scenery is cutting it short; now add the defintiion of BluRay and it is astounding.  The acting is amazing, believable and at times so heart wrenching that the tears flow.  The story is one that there is no compare to in the movie world.  It is a classic that (should) go down as an all-time great.

As if that is not enough, the music score is one of the best that I have ever heard.  The horns in the intro are so amazing that I purchased the score cd (first one I have ever purchased and notice I said the score, not the music), and I turned it up and let it blast on my stereo.

Madeline Stowe made the love story aspect believable and Wes Studi is easily one of the most memorable villains ever. The final sequence on the mountain, with almost no dialogue and the hypnotic music building as the action unfolds is something you will never forget.

Luckily, unlike most people I have another blu-ray player for which the display has been 'professionally' calibrated with a colorimeter and there was a drastic improvement. However, this blu-ray still almost feels more like a dvd. Not worth an upgrade.

It is still an outstanding film worth owning, if you don't already, but the picture quality and even the sound, which it won an academy award for, both leave something to be desired.  I was expecting to be absolutely blown away by the sound but it is average at best. The dts core sounded identical to the dts hd-ma track.

Only three lines didn't make it back in--Nathaniel's snark to Duncan when he's explaining that he isn't a scout--""That Clear it Up any"", the line Nathaniel says right before they all escape in the canoes, and Cora's lines at the waterfall, about if the worst should happen...and of right when the promentory starts, in the original, you have Nathaniel and Cora walking slowly away before Duncan is tortured, that wasn't restored.

But I'm okay with that, because everything else was restored and that made me happy. Because my two favorite scenes,
Nathaniel to Duncan ""Someday you and I are going to have a serious disagreement"" and the scene between Nathaniel and Cora about women being a ""breed apart"" was put back in.

It would be nice to know why the theatrical version was not made available in North America releases though. And it still isn't.

Though someone posted the original online on youtube, the there is about 45 minutes that was taken down--the first 15 minutes, the second hour (first 15 minutes) and the scene right after the water fall up until the last 5 minutes.

3246428,5,B000Y5CHIE,"Last of The Mohicans purists like myself who are so unhappy with the ""Director's Expanded Edition"" of this film should be a bit more pleased with the Blu-Ray ""Director's Definitive Cut"" version of the movie. As discussed by other reviewers, the ""expanded edition"" edited out what many think are the stellar lines of the movie. Imagine a version of Dirty Harry where Clint doesn't ask the punk to ""make his day.""  Imagine a version of The Terminator where Arnie doesn't say he'll ""be back.""  Imagine Clark Gable failing mention he doesn't ""Give a Damn."" and you'll get the idea of what the ""Director's Expanded Edition"" of Last of the Mohicans is like to watch.
  The GOOD NEWS is that in the Blu Ray (""Director's Definitive Cut"")SOME but not ALL of the the dialogue that was foolishly edited from the ""Expanded"" version remains. Happily, the blu-ray version does not edit Cora and Hawkeye's discussion about how his father ""warned me about people like you.""  It remains fully intact - including Hawkeye's ""In your case, Miss, I'd make an exception"" and Cora's sarcastic ""thank you SO much.""  In the Blu ray version the viewer also gets to see Hawkeye tell Duncan that one day the two of them are going to have a ""serious disagreement"".  The bad news is that Hawkeye DOES NOT ask Duncan (in the canoe scene) if he doesn't ""have anything better to do on the lake today.""  And in the scene by the waterfall, Cora doesn't say how if ""the worst should happen"" and one of them dies, a part of the other will live on in the survivor. Instead, as soon as she says ""And if the worst happens..."" the scene edits directly to Hawkeye screaming all that ain't-no-mountain-high-enough stuff about ""Stay Alive! Stay Alive!"" The way it's edited, it is as if he's responding to her having asked what she should do if the worst should happen.  So there you have it.  Some of the good stuff is still in the blu ray version and some is still missing.  While not as intact as I understand the European, Region 2 original theatrical release is, the blu ray version is a huge improvement from the ""extended cut"" edition in terms of leaving some of the most dramatic lines of the movie intact. Was tempted to give it only 4 stars because of the missing lines but in this version it's a great movie so 5 stars won out.",1339200000,71,2293,4.554744525547445
3246429,5,B000Y5CHIE,"Michael Mann's penchant for tinkering with his films after their theatrical release has reached something of a fever pitch with his ""Definitive Director's Cut"" of one of his best movies: the 1992 adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper's THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS.

A movie that underwent a turbulent production that saw Fox bump the picture's original, highly-visible July 4th weekend opening to the fall, have Mann re-cut his reportedly three hour initial version down per the studio's wishes, and see Randy Edelman come in to rework some of the music after a reported breakdown in communication between original composer Trevor Jones and Mann, ""Mohicans"" felt like a film that was primed to become a major box-office disappointment before it opened.

Happily, the resulting film proved the doubters wrong and ranked as one of the year's (some may argue the decade's) finest films - a rugged, authentic outdoor adventure with Daniel-Day Lewis brilliantly embodying Hawkeye, and striking up a magnetic chemistry with co-star Madeline Stowe, in a story set against the backdrop of Colonial America with spectacular cinematography by Dante Spinotti and production design from Wolf Kroeger. Vivid action scenes, a stirring romance, great performances (Wes Studi and Russell Means lend ideal support) and unforgettable soundtrack all culminate in a truly inspired production from Mann, working at the height of his filmmaking ability in what would be the first of three outstanding films he made in the `90s (""Heat"" and ""The Insider"" followed).

The movie's production woes reportedly did not enable Mann to implement all the editorial work he wanted on the picture. Despite the film's solid grosses and widespread critical acclaim, the director re-cut the film in 2002 for its Director's Cut DVD, eliminating some dialogue and making mostly minor tweaks here and there, including the removal of Clannad's popular song ""I Will Wait For You"" and the addition of some unnecessary dialogue from Chingachgook during the film's final scene.

Fans of the movie who lamented some of those changes will be happy to note that Mann once again has gone back in and reworked ""Mohicans"" for a second time. His new ""Definitive Director's Cut"" Blu-Ray doesn't find Mann crafting his rumored three-hour version (Jodhi May fans will remain disappointed that her role still remains mostly on the cutting room floor), but ironically returning, for the most part, to his original theatrical version - restoring lines of dialogue that he cut for the prior DVD, adding Clannad's song back in (though this time with Native American lyrics), and taking out the preachy, unnecessary dialogue at the picture's end (the images spoke for themselves). While it can be frustrating that Mann can't always seem to leave well enough at times, the alterations - in this case - improve the picture over its 2002 edition and make for a more satisfying version all told.

Also far more satisfying here than any prior DVD release of the film is Fox's excellent AVC-encoded 1080p transfer. One of the most breathtaking visual films of its era, this sharply detailed presentation is very good indeed, preserving the movie's original grain and adding detail unseen since its original theatrical release. DTS Master Audio sound robustly backs the film's potent, multi-composer soundtrack, which Randy Edelman had told me years ago hat he may have rescored completely had there been the time to do so.

Supplements aren't overwhelming but will prove to be of major interest for fans: a new, 42-minute doc includes interviews with all the principals (Stowe still looks great) plus behind-the-scenes footage, presented in HD; there's also a new commentary from Mann along with the original trailers.

When I played that DVD, which I have only played twice in a decade, I could not believe how much the director had damaged the dramatic effect of several vital scenes, most notably the ending, which is drawn out by a long speech by Chingachgook, diluting the effect of his brief, essential, overwhelmingly ""right"" utterance in the theatrical version.

4/05: I consider The Last of the Mohicans one of the all-time great films.

When I saw the picture at the theatre, it was just brilliant, and I hadn't seen anything like it before or since then.

Hence, Michael Mann is one of the best directors in the history of motion pictures. All he does is make visual masterpieces.

The Last of the Mohicans should have received a boatload of Oscar nominations including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor (at least twice), Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing.

It's impossible to deny how good Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeline Stowe, Wes Studi, Russell Means, Steven Waddington, Maurice Roeves, Patrice Chereau, and Eric Schweig among others were in the film.

As Magua, Wes Studi turned in the best performance of 1992, and it's not even that close. If anyone remembers The Last of the Mohicans, it's Wes Studi's performance because of how he shows his emotions.

Wes spoke four different languages: French, Huron, Mohawk, and English. During the scene on the cliff, he twisted his knee and tore his cartilage, forcing him to have an orthoscopic surgery before returning back on the set a week later. That's why he is seen wearing a brace or rather a legging over it.

Some of my favorite lines of the film are:

""Well, we kind of face to the north, and real sudden-like, turn left.""

""l, Chingachgook, the last of the Mohicans.""

""It is more deeply stirring to my blood than any imagining could possibly have been.""

""I do not call myself subject to much at all.""

""In case your aim's any better than your judgment.""

""I ain't your scout. And we sure ain't no damn militia.""

""In the response to ""What are you looking at, sir?,"" ""I'm looking at you, miss.""

""Yes, and, 'do not try to make them understand you. That is because they are a breed apart and make no sense.'""

""Magua's heart is twisted.""

""We're sorry to kill you, brother. We do honor to your courage and speed, your strength.""

In Huron, ""Magua understands that the white man is a dog to his women. When they are tired, he puts down his tomahawk to feed their laziness.""

""Magua said, understand English very well.""

""Some day, I think, you and I will have a serious disagreement.""

""A breed apart, we make no sense?""

""When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies, Magua will put his children under the knife, so the Grey Hair will know his seed is wiped out forever.""

By the way, the DVD version of The Last of the Mohicans is atrociously bad. Because certain lines and shots are cut out and new but unnecessary shots are added in, the spirit is just not the same as the theatrical version. The battle scenes are too long and boring. That's why I still have the VHS copy (in fact, two) and prefer to watch that one.

All in all, there's nothing like The Last of the Mohicans.

7/07: I said it before and I will say it again: The Last of the Mohicans is a unique masterpiece.

Wes Studi was snubbed big time for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. If not for him, I don't think The Last of the Mohicans would have been half of the film as it is.

Daniel Day-Lewis is at his sexiest and is complemented well by Madeleine Stowe. They have some of the best romantic scenes in any film.

All in all, The Last of the Mohicans might be the best picture that Michael Mann has ever directed.

7/11: Wes Studi was clearly robbed of the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.

All in all, The Last of the Mohicans is a masterpiece.

2/17: Still a great film.",1310169600,6,3632,4.54

3246442,4,B000Y5CHIE,"I read the many reviews of the LOTM prior to buying the Blu Ray version for myself. (I already had the DVD version). Here's my two cents in a straight forward manner.

The documentary about making the movie was absolutely EXCELLENT, and this was exactly the kind of documentary I had been yearning for, for almost 20 years. If I recall, there was also one made by HBO when the movie was first broadcast on that channel almost 2 decades ago, but this one is different. Michael Mann along with DDL, Madeleine Stowe (who looks even more gorgeous and ravishing as she did years ago), Wes Studi, and Dale Dye (the famous military consultant) all make great insights into the movie.

The commentary track throughout the movie (that I rarely use, except for movies I am fanatical about, like LOTM) was done by Mann. He gave a great deal of historical commentary which was interesting, but I was hoping for more observations about the specific movie scenes themselves, which he did only on an occasional basis. I thought the in-depth historical information was to the point of saturation.

Other reviewers commented on the dark quality of the movie, which is unfortunately true and was a slight disappointment. HOWEVER, the Blu Ray version is indeed crystal clearer and sharper, when compared to the normal DVD version. Interestingly, when I compared the DVD version of LOTM, the DVD was generally darker in color as well, when compared to other DVD titles I had, but the Blu Ray version is noticeably darker than the LOTM DVD version and was a little bothersome.

In summary, as a diehard LOTM fan, I am happy with the Blu Ray version. The darker color shouldn't dispel anyone from buying it.",1301356800,11,1685,4.7406143344709895

I have heard that in the DVD release of the film, the Clannad song, ""I will find you"" was cut and the ending dialogue was vastly different. Both are intact in the Blu-Ray release of the film. There are a few dialogue changes, all pretty minor, and some added scenes. Overall, this version of the film is still true to the version I remember and love, the VHS/Theatrical release version.

3246450,5,B000Y5CHIE,"I am a big fan of the Last of the Mohicans. I have loved this movie for many years and have practically worn out my VHS copy. I have been waiting impatiently for the theatrical release of this film to be available in the US on DVD. Needless to say, I was very disappointed with the directors expanded edition when it was first released on DVD. Too many scenes were cut. I kept hoping that maybe the Blu Ray edition would solve all of these problems. Even though it is still considered the directors edition, it is much closer to the original theatrical release with only a few minor changes.

Disclaimer: This review is meant for the detail oriented fans who are looking for a breakdown of what made the cut and what didn't. Obviously, I couldn't include everything, but these are some of the key issues many had with the original DVD release. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

Most of the interactions between Cora and Hawkeye have been put back into the movie. The scene with them talking about her being, ""a breed apart that makes no sense"" is back.  However, you don't get to hear her shocked reactions.

Most of Hawkeye's lines are back especially, ""one day you and I are going to have a serious disagreement."" One that didn't make the cut is his cocky retort at the end of explaining how they are heading west. You no longer hear him say, ""clear it up any?"" Lastly, the line, ""Nothing better to do on the lake today, Major?"" is still not back in the film.

There are a few additions to the film. It's nothing too extreme that takes away from the plot though. There are more shots at the battle taking place at Fort William Henry. The French Colonel is given a few more lines. The parley sequence has a few added lines. You get the idea.

Yes, Clannad's I Will Find You is back, but it is all in a different language as many have already pointed out.

Chingachgook's original speech is back at the end of the film.

The entire ""I will find you"" speech has been returned.

One more thing that I noticed is that they changed the coloring on a lot of the scenes. Some scenes are duller and some scenes the colors are more vivid. The director explained in the behind the scenes that he was going for natural lighting, so it's possible that he simply got rid of any alterations/filters they had done in the past. I have THX capability on my tv, but it's still very dark/dull looking in some places. Perhaps it's because I'm used to my VHS copy, so take this with a grain of salt. For those who haven't watched it one too many times, you won't even see the difference.

Overall, I am thrilled with this version. It is ten times better than the original DVD release. I am very glad that all of the lines that I loved are back in the movie. The small changes/missing lines are not enough to make me want to wait another 5-10 years and hope my VHS copy lasts. I am very satisfied with this version. I really enjoyed the behind the scenes feature and would not be ashamed to add this copy to my library. It's worth the money.",1292889600,20,3039,4.343915343915344
3246451,1,B000Y5CHIE,"The movie is great, but the image is so awful. I am shocked with the quality. It is not Blu-ray, It's VHS.",1291939200,3,106,3.8636363636363638
3246452,3,B000Y5CHIE,"I've spoken with many people about this movie and how ridiculously messed up things were when it came to DVD.  Well I went ahead and bought the blu ray anyway because I love the movie but also because I heard it's slightly different than the DVD, and it is.  But the differences are subtle and in the end I think the original theatrical release was ultimately the best version of this movie.

Most of the time when a director makes a final cut he/she shouldn't be aloud to delete anything, only add.  That was Michael Mann's problem with his definitive cut of ""Last of the Mohicans"" for blu ray.  There are 2 major deletions, 1 noticeable add on (there are also a few extra shots of the French storming the fort which are nice) and 1 minor deletion.

1st major deletion - When Daniel Day Lewis and Madeline Stowe were in the waterfall scene and they decided that he had to try and escape while she stayed behind and attempted to survive, ""Just stay alive!""  Yes, it was one of the worst scenes in the Hollywood history but it was at least supplemented a little by the dialogue of Madeline Stowe's character ""if one of us survives then a part of the other survives too,"" that whole thing.  I liked it and they cut it out.  It went straight from ""There's no powder it's all wet,"" to ""stay alive!...""  Really bazaar.  He took a scene that was already terrible and made it worse.

2nd major deletion - When the French General Montcalm was talking to Magua in the original release and on the DVD, Magua asks if the thinks the English will keep their promise to leave, to which Montcalm replies ""Col. Monroe would, but General Webb will not honor the agreement.""  Basically indicating that he wouldn't ""mind"" if Magua's war party somehow ""found"" Col. Monroe's dilapidated army and wiped them out, but at the same time expressing how he felt about the English officer.  The dialogue showed the respect that Montcalm had for Monroe and how he knew if Monroe were in charge they would leave.  For some reason it was cut.  Now the dialogue in the scene is very choppy.  It also doesn't tie in well with a previous scene between Monroe and Montcalm (that Michael Mann added btw) and now makes the characters of Monroe and Montcalm lack depth.  Why take that out, this one over the others is the one that confuses me the most.  FOR WHAT REASON???  It's only about 5 seconds of dialogue, what's the big deal, why did Mr. Mann not care for that particular dialogue?  Changing just a few seconds of a movie can have a big affect.

1 minor deletion - This was in the trailer as well as the original release.  It's when Daniel Day-Lewis shows up to the fort and says ""just dropped in to see how you boys was doin'.""  I have no problem with the deletion of this, it wasn't even amusing when I saw it the first time in the trailer.

1 addition - As mentioned before there is an extended scene with Col. Monroe and Montcalm discussing the terms of surrender (just like on the DVD).  It was a great addition, I liked it, made sense, but then of course it was screwed up by editing the aforementioned scene between Magua and the Montcalm.  Michael Mann must have the same mentality as the Washington Redskins; do one thing good and then do 3 stupid things.

Well just thought you'd want to know.  It's still such a great movie, wonderful music, good storyline and the history is actually very close.  Next time Michael Mann, if it ain't broke don't fix it.  ""Ali"" was very broken, maybe you should try and fix that movie.",1291766400,20,3499,4.445839874411303

I've watched it many times on regular DVD and the expanded DVD version. Now to the Bluray version. This is a very dark movie. Much of it is was filmed at night, at dawn, or at dusk. The daylight scenes of this on bluray look wonderful. It's sharp, black level is nice, and the colors really pop. With the many darker scenes, not so much. Definition suffers. It's very difficult at times to see any facial expressions and colors seem to smear a bit. Shadow detail is pretty bad. The sound mix is good, not great. Again an improvement over the standard DVD, but not by much. It has it's moments but it's not a very consistent or dynamic mix. Dialogue is a bit low at times. I don't know how much of this is due to the film itself, or a result of the mastering process. For me, the movie is 5 stars, the bluray is 3 stars, 4 stars overall. And while the bluray is an improvement over the standard DVD's, particularly in daylight scenes, it's not without problems. The bluray is worth having for fans of this movie, but you won't be using it to show off your system's capabilities.",1289520000,17,1475,4.52808988764045

3246463,5,B000Y5CHIE,"I just finished watching the blu-ray transfer and all I can say is, ""WOW!""  This is without a doubt the best this film has ever looked and, I might add, one of the best HD transfers I have ever seen for any movie. I was a little wary of buying this due to some of the negative reviews about the transfer, so I went ahead and got it from Netflix first. I must say that whoever thinks this transfer is worse than the DVD is completely efing nuts. Sorry but you are. Go check yourself into the mental ward because you need help. I am not an expert about film transfers, but I do a lot of amateur photography so I can truly say that there is nothing I would improve with this transfer. Let me say it again--there is NOTHING improve about this transfer. You can disagree with me all you want; I couldn't care less. The contrast and saturation are both perfect--the colors just pop and everything is amazinly bright and crisp. The black levels are normal, ie. they haven't been given a face-lift like on the DVD, but for the amount of whining some people have done you would think it's a bad thing. Guess what? On my 52"" Samsung the blacks look rich and detailed and perfect. Much better than the DVD.

I just barely watched this on DVD a little while ago so I was just planning of renting the blu-ray and watching it a bit to check out the transfer. But I could not stop watching, it was so gorgeous. I literally could not tear myself away. I was completely enthralled for two hours. There are not many movies that have that kind of magic. With the HD transfer, I felt like I was watching an entirely new movie and that I was right there in the action. I am not a noob to HD, in fact I have been watching HD movies since 2007. Again, this is an amazing transfer and as long as you aren't watching it on a crappy HDTV with poor black levels, I can promise you your jaw will drop as you watch. And let's be clear, the whole movie isn't filmed at night. There are five, maybe six scenes at night, but they all looked fantastic to my eyes. I just don't get why people are complainging about this transfer. The saytime shots are even more beautiful and there were several scenes (Gen. Monroe's surrender where the two armies march out, the battle in the glen, for example) that had me totally floored with how crisp and rich the colors and details were, particularly on the flags and uniforms.

Anyway, I can't say enough about how good this transfer is. Don't believe the whiners on this one. It's completely amazing.

P.S. One minor quibble-- I was annoyed that they changed the Clannad song to some weird language version. It didn't feel right at all. Better no song than a butchered one. I think we all just want the original back, are you listening Michael?",1288915200,2,2752,4.327519379844961
3246464,5,B000Y5CHIE,"1 Blu-ray disc, released October 5, 2010

""The Last of the Mohicans"" was directed by Michael Mann and loosely based on the book by James Fenimore Cooper. The director and writers felt the novel was too simple and inaccurate to the times so they took it up a notch. The story is about three trappers who fight to protect the daughters of a British Colonel during the French and Indian War.

Daniel Day-Lewis plays Hawkeye who was raised by the Mohicans in their ways. The last Mohican, Chingachgook was played by Russell Means who was the first national director of the American Indian Movement and was in the 1973 standoff with the US government at Wounded Knee. Dennis Banks who played Ongewasgone was another member of this movement. The casting director and director really wanted authenticity in the movie and felt that these two would really add to the genuineness of the film by playing out their heritage.

The British are asking the Colonials who live off the land and fend for themselves to fight for the British in the war and give the guarantee that they will be allowed to go back and defend their homes if the battle goes there, a promise which is broken. Hawkeye refuses to get involved from the beginning, but when his group comes upon a war party targeting the daughters of Col. Munro, he saves them and later begins a relationship with the elder daughter, Cora played by Madeleine Stowe. Her sister, Alice is played by Jodhi May. Later the two are kidnapped by Huron Magua played by Wes Studi and pursued over great distances by the Mohicans (""I will find you!!"").

What this movie excels in is excitement, beauty in nature, demonstrating the raw bravery of the time fending for yourself in the wilderness, and the musical scores are neverending, gorgeous, and will NOT get out of your head for DAYS afterward. It had five wins and 10 nominations for Awards that year, winning the Oscar for Best Sound and some British acting awards for Daniel Day-Lewis.

Special Features:

This is a great film to get the Blu-ray treatment. Look at the scenery!! Once the camera pans over in this widescreen format and you get a good look at those mountains and trees and dudes running uphill with their guns with the music swelling up, it's all movie magic. My only complaints would be that in dark scenes, the Blu-ray does not adapt 100% and gets confused. My particular Blu-ray had a meltdown after the long series of dark scenes between Hawkeye and Cora and I spent a long time trying to re-load it. The Blu-ray has director commentary with Michael Mann which goes over a lot of the same information in the making-of feature but also talks about more details like locations, how hard they were to get to, the challenges of using natural lighting, etc.

The Making of Feature includes interviews with actors, the director, the casting director, and sound/score people. They spend a great deal of time on the story and why it was so important to deviate from the book in the manner they did and also how they cast the roles and the training that took place. Daniel Day-Lewis had to complete a survivalist bootcamp, learn how to fire a gun, and load it while running uphill. They knew from his infamous method acting in ""My Left Foot"" that he would take everything to heart and just be Hawkeye during the shoot. The score is based off a Celtic tune that the director's wife heard one day and they decided based on Hawkeye's heritage that they wanted to use it with some variations. The interviews appear fresh and are in high-definition. This is a great one to pick up for fans of this film and nature in general. The last time I saw this movie was on a VHS tape so it'll blow your mind.",1288483200,,3690,4.598784194528875

3246466,3,B000Y5CHIE,"I really wanted this Blu-ray for the DTS sound, but it came up mute. There was normal audio on the commentary track, the menu, and the supplements, but, the moment I hit Play, all sound disappeared (I have a DTS amp, obviously, but neither the Dolby nor DTS setting would work). It was still gone when I stopped the disc and then resumed. I finally discovered, by accident, that if I started the movie, changed the input on my amp (an Onkyo) to something else, and then returned to the film, that sound appeared. However, it was of very low volume compared to any DTS disc I've ever heard. I don't know if this is a mismatch between equipment, or an authoring error, but I'm going with the latter (no other Blu-ray disc has ever done this).
  BTW, I also thought the film looked unusually dark, even in the daylight scenes, although the images were crisp. I think I'll look for a region 2 Blu-ray.",1288051200,3,897,4.430303030303031

The image quality is less than the image quality of Last of the Mohicans on a dvd played on a up-conversion dvd player.  The color is so poor(low chroma) that it appears to have actually been copied from an old VHS master where much of the data has vanished over time. The quality of this item is pathetic when compared to any real blu-ray mastered item.  I am really offended to be scamed like this again!,1287792000,8,571,4.471153846153846
3246468,5,B000Y5CHIE,"I have had many blu rays come into my home that I was unsatisfied with and returned or sold on Amazon, This will DEFINITELY not be one of those. This movie is from the early 90's and was filmed in a lot of natural lighting, therefor you can not expect to have the same picture as lets say """"TROY"" or ""Pirates of the Caribbean. Fact of the matter is that the standard DVD quality was not the best in the first place, actually if you ever see this movie on TV or a premium channel in HD, there is never a good picture, its actually quit terrible, but not on this blu ray, the picture captures the moment and the audio is so clear I heard things Ive never heard before. There was alot of reviews claiming when its dark it looks terrible, well that may be because of your TV or DVD/Blu ray player, Because I have a Samsung 700 Series and a Sony Blu Ray player and this movie looked amazing, and I am one who returned ""Gladiator"" because the first release of it used DNR and EE recording quality and it looked terrible, not the case here!  I will be keeping this and recommending it to many who love this movie but were steered away by the reviews!",1287705600,5,1143,4.171945701357466
3246469,4,B000Y5CHIE,"I have viewed the VHS and every DVD that has been issued. And never bought this movie. However when I saw the Blue Ray I bought it. I had read all bad reviews. Then one night while watching HD TV saw the end of a show that told about Mann looking at old paintings. Noticing the shadows and the darkness in the woods. So he made it as real as he couldon Blu-Ray.
The HD sound track is just a bit better than the normal DD.I have a way I can switch back and forth from HD and normal fiber optics. Newer movies like Robin hood and Iron Man 2 a huge differance.  But it is still a wonderfull movie. Glad I bought it. Good deal, its $24.99 at Best Buy when I picked it up.
I'm watching on a Panasonic Plasma which handles black levels much better than a LCD
which could be why we are seeing so many saying its too dark. A person with a new LED HD TV should have a wonderful viewing of this movie. Of course Plasma viewers will love this movie.",1287532800,4,938,3.9893617021276597
3246470,4,B000Y5CHIE,"Michael Mann's obsession with ""The Last of the Mohicans"" began with seeing a 16mm print of the 1936 version of the film. In bringing his version of the story to the screen Mann relied less on James Fennimore Cooper's novel combining it with the authentic feel of the time and more realistic characters with greater depth (particularly for the Indians)in his classic 1992 take on the same tale.

This is the third version of the film to appear. In 2001 Mann revisited his theatrical cut and re-edited it altering the pacing for some scenes and adding three minutes to the film (primarily to the sequence set at the Fort). This ""Director's Definitive Cut"" adheres more closely to the original theatrical version although there are still some minor differences (bits of dialogue dropped, some alternate shots substituted)and Mann has restored Clannard's song to the film during Hawkeye's pursuit of Magua.

The big issue seems to be how dark this transfer is. Shot using natural light the look here is closer to the original theatrical version of the film than the DVD where contrast was boosted. The daylight sequences look marvelous with colors bolder, richer and foilage a deeper green than before capturing the feel of being in the forest but it's the night time scenes (and there a lot of those) that are more problematic. While our eyes can adjust to the dark, they can't do that when watching a film set in the dark particular where fine detail, resolution and clarity are buried in the murky depths of some of the sequences here. Mann and those who supervised the Telecine transfer would have done well to increase the contrast here for those who purchase this edition. You'll have to do it manually and while it does improve the darkest sequences it also impacts the sequences set in the daylight losing much of what is gained in those sequences.

For Fox and Mann ""The Last of the Mohicans"" should be a do-over; the darker sequences lose much of their power because, quite honestly, even with contrast boosted you can't always make out all the action. I realize that using natural light was the intent of Mann but even for Blu-ray the presentation here is  a challenge as it doesn't have quite the resolution of seeing it on film in a theater and there are going to be variable viewing conditions that will impact the look of the film on Blu-ray.

I can cautiously recommend the film but suggest you may want to rent it first to see if this edition will fit your home viewing environment, monitor and if your eyesight is able to make out the fine detail in the darkests sequences. It tends to be more problematic early on during the sequence where the French raiding party is pursuing Hawkeye and his band after they discover the ruined farm house attacked by the raiding party.

Luckily Fox has given us a nice group of extras here none of which were included on the previous DVD edition. We get an intelligent commentary from Mann discussing the making of the film covering everything from casting to his decision to shoot the film in natural light.

We also get a three part (divided into acts)documentary that runs just under 43 minutes focusing on the origin of the film, casting, location shooting and the military school the extras had to endure to create the authentic air including Daniel Day-Lewis undergoing paramilitary training for his role. There are plenty of interviews including Day-Lewis, Mann, Stowe, composer Trevor Jones (who contrary to rumors wasn't fired--Randy Edelman was brought on board because Mann's constant recutting of the film and his decision to go with a natural vs. electronic score forced Jones to bring on someone to help him compose/arrange additional musical cues), the military advisors and others.

We also get the original teaser and theatrical trailers presented from a video SD source.

While the extras are exceptionally good, I have to question Mann's decision to present the film this way as most monitors will have to be adjusted during the film to appreciate the film during the nighttime sequences. As mentioned, I'd suggest renting first to see if this version might be too dark for you (particularly given how bright the DVD was which didn't faithfully reproduce the dark look of the theatrical presentation). I've docked the film a star for the presentation which should have been done a bit more carefully.",1287273600,12,4369,4.845844504021447

Yes, it is a little dark, but that coincides with Mann's vision of using natural light.  I don't see a tint at all.  I had low expectations for this release, given the reviews on here, but I must say, I was not displeased with my purchase.  This is one of my favorite movies of the 90's and it looks and sounds so much better than my DVD version.  Maybe rent it before you buy it if you're skeptical, but I think the people who talk about a tint need to check the settings on their system.",1287273600,3,605,4.136752136752137

Every scene has a yellow hue.  We will revert to our DVD and put this Blu-Ray aside.  We have duplicated many of our DVD's with Blu-Ray and this is the first disappointment.",1287187200,7,528,4.262626262626263
3246473,4,B000Y5CHIE,"I am nearly at the end of watching this movie received it today, have to say I am very impressed with not only the picture quality but also the surround sound, the film maker has obviously keept the use of the rear channels to a minimum as they only kick into life for dramatic effect, mainly during the action scenes.

True I would have loved to have had both this version along with the theatrical version but you can not have it all your own way no matter how much we would wish.

I can not see a problem with the picture - if I hadn't seen the making off first I may have had an issue but seeing as the director made a point of stating he wanted natural lighting hence nothing is really lit, the night time scenes reflect this natural environment, ie only limited candle lighting, or reflections from camp fires etc, this makes more sence and the daylight scenes are outstanding,I was worried before I put this on as I had read a few reviews complaining about picture quality, nonsense this is nowhere near anything like the worst blu ray picture out there far from it, Django still holds that honour for me.

if you love this movie and you love blu ray buy it, I do think some people should really get their kit sorted out or like myself purchase a new set of glasses.

However, the color in this BluRay presentation is not good. Much worse than the DVD and theater release. Darker, inaccurate, and unpleasant to the eye. There are exceptions. The officer uniforms and the flags at the surrender negotiations are in full magnificent color, but the surrounding scene is muted and ugly. The scene, early on, where the carriage crosses the Biltmore
Estate bridge, is so muted and so lacking in contrast as to be nearly unwatchable. What a shame. I'll stick with the DVD of this magnificent movie and be totally content. Skip the Blu-Ray edition is my recommendation.",1287014400,9,689,5.0
3246475,2,B000Y5CHIE,"Last of the Mohicans is one of my top ten favorite movies so I was very excited to get this in Blu-Ray.  Unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed.  Most of us fans recall seeing this movie in the theaters and fondly remember the stunning panoramic scenes.  I was expecting breathtaking blu-ray quality. Unfortunately, the picture doesn't look any better in most instances than an upscaled DVD.  After telling my wife about how great the visuals were in the movie, I was quite frankly embarrased as we watched it.

This version adds back many of the deleted parts from the theatrical version.  So I'd say it's mostly like the theaterical versions except with a few additions.  However there are still minor things missing that most fans will easily remember from the original theatrical release. Here's a list of differences:

(1) Still missing is the line:  ""Haven't you got anything better to do on the lake today, Major?""
(2) Still missing:  Uncas says: Too easy to track; they'd be heard for miles missisng is the final part: ""Find yourself a musket.""
(3) The BR retains the Clannad song over the chase scene but the lyrics aren't exactly the same (that is the song is used but the parts of the song used are different which is better than the DVD version, but still not what we fans wanted).
(4) The preachy last lines of Chingachgook are eliminated leaving the preferred ending.
(5) The line where Hawkeye says he heads to the North then suddenly turns left is added but the final line in that part of the dialog ""clear it up any"" is missing.

I also believe the fight scenes were edited.  Some of the cuts look poorly made and not as I remember them.",1286928000,10,1657,4.636986301369863
3246476,2,B000Y5CHIE,"Last of the Mohicans is one of my favorite movies, it is sad to see such a butcher job on this bluray release.  For starters the picture is average at best.  It doesn't look like typical bluray and quite honestly doesn't look much better than what a good DVD can do.  The dark scenes are far too dark and there are many scenes that have a strange yellow tint.  Many of the scenery scans  are filled with grain.  The picture quality unfortunately is the better part, the sound is far worse.  The sound is flat and hollow.  There is no depth to the sound quality and the balance is also off.  It goes from barely hear able audio speech to ear piercing gun shots within seconds.  There are a few times where there is clearly suppose to be sounds but there are none, but rather silence.  So far I haven't picked on the biggest flaw which is the apparent lack of surround sound...  yes I am being honest here.  I watched the movie last night on my surround (Onkyo Reciever, Klipsch Speakers) and 90% of the sound comes out the center while the other 10% is from the fronts.  The rear speakers were dead silent the entire time.  I routinely watch bluray and game (360 and ps3) and my system is hooked up properly.  Hell it is even calibrated.  I was shocked, this movie even during large battle scenes features no rear speaker noise.  The quality is simply piss poor.  I honestly can't get over how poor the sound is.  Mario Galaxy on the Wii using RCA cables sounds better.

As for the movie itself, I noticed 1 added scene which fit and the speech at the end has been shortened, everything else seemed to be left online.  Overall the movie is still an excellent movie but the quality of the bluray release is horrid.  It is easily the worst bluray movie I have watched to date.",1286928000,16,1773,4.3547400611620795

3246479,3,B000Y5CHIE,"My review is based on The Director's Cut DVD. And like most of the other reviews, ""The Last of the Mohicans"" was one of my favorite movies, having owned the widescrean VHS version. I was delighted to get the director's cut on DVD, but ultimately disappointed with the results. I liked some of the new scenes that were added that explianed things that you could only guess at, such as the main characters meeting with the Cameron's at the beginning. That sequence works better than the original. But the rest of the film with bits and pieces of dialog dropped (such as sarcastic comments between Duncan Hayward and Hawkeye) I found that they lost its bite. But the biggest disappointment was (the same as other reviewers) cutting out the Clannad song ""I Will Find You"" (which was one of my favorite parts), yet leaving the song listed in the end credits which makes no sence at all. I didn't mind the extra dialog at the end, although I agree that the original ending is perfect.

I am familiar with director Michael Mann's work, especially coming from his work with the television series ""Miami Vice"", and that's why I thought that parts of ""The Last of the Mohicans"" played like a music video. And the climatic fight sequence is one of the best sequences in recent film history. ""The Last of the Mohicans"" won the Oscar for best sound, but the music, the cinematography, art direction and set direction and costumes were equally as impressive. Daniel Day Lewis is excellent as Hawkeye, but sometimes he was a bit over the top. Wes Studi as Magua turned in an award winning performance that was ignored.

The bottom line however is that director Michael Mann should have left well enough alone. Like myself included, the original version is an all around fan favorite.",1286668800,4,1768,4.7

The battle scene really make you feel like you are in the middle of a war. For the low price offered on this site I would high recommend all fans of this film to buy the Blu Ray.

3246481,3,B000Y5CHIE,"I've been awaiting this excellent movie on Blu-ray since High Definition discs were released.  Not only is it an outstanding movie, but you can read web sites full of information on how accurately this movie depicts the era.  It is beautifully shot and looks stunning on-screen.

Which is why it's hard to give one of my few 5-star movies a 3-star Blu-ray rating.

WITHOUT ADJUSTMENT, SCENES ARE TOO DARK ON BLU-RAY
The nighttime scenes  (which is half the movie) were too dark to enjoy. Facial nuances and a great deal of the interaction was completely lost in the darkness of every scene that didn't take place in absolute daylight. Even the scene when Hawkeye comes back to the Cameron cabin the second time (which was a daylight scene), was too dark to make out any details until things brightened a bit later in the scene.

I removed the Blu-ray and put in both the U.S. and the U.K. DVD versions just to make sure I wasn't just seeing things. And both of the DVD versions were infinitely easier to view and make out details.

This is the first and only BD I've had to radically adjust my gamma values to restore the nuances of the nighttime scenes.  So, the information is there (on the Blu-ray), but the default viewing experience is way too dark.

For non-videophiles or those who don't have a professionally calibrated setup, jack up your Blu-ray player's gamma value (or brightness if you can't find your Gamma setting) to make sure you don't miss out on half the movie.

DIRECTOR'S DEFINITIVE CUT
For those who prefer the theatrical version of the movie to Michael Mann's Director's Cut, you'll be pleased.  Although this is a new and different edit, most of the elements sadly removed from the theatrical version have been restored here.  Some additional scenes previously available only in Director's Cut are welcome in this version since they don't come at the cost of the scenes previously removed in the Director's Version.  For the curious, these include the minor goofs noticed only by a picky few (one's yellow, the other ripples).  Either way, neither take away from the particular scenes nor the overall movie.

At least the Blu-ray disc isn't terribly expensive, so it's only a small waste of money. I'm not sure I'll ever watch it again. I'll probably go back to watching the film on DVD, especially if the Clannad song is back in the Blu-ray version. (I've not gotten that far yet.) I frankly hated the song, so much so that I would mute the audio when it came on, and was glad it was gone from the DVD.

3246483,1,B000Y5CHIE,"Great movie, engaging commentary track by director Michael Mann but terrible transfer to BluRay disc. It's way too dark. Any scene that takes place inside, with natural lighting, is ruined by this transfer. To give you an idea of just how dark this transfer is, remember the scene where the Indians attack the British column early in the film? Right before the attack, Magua walks down the length of the column and as he's walking, he draws his weapon and strikes a green British soldier who smiles at him. This transfer is so dark, you can't even see the look on this kid's face. If I was the cinematographer, Dante Spinotti, I would be very angry about this transfer. I watched the first 25 minutes of the movie and turned it off in frustration. It's too bad because I was enjoying Michael Mann's great commentary. Now I have a coaster that I'll never watch again, like the recent transfer of PREDATOR.",1286496000,25,904,4.62111801242236
3246484,1,B000Y5CHIE,"This Review applies to the Blu-ray release. I love this movie and as a movie would rate it at least a 4. However, this release has a very dark appearance (i.e. absence of light) in many scenes as if filmed under a heavy cloud cover. It also has a yellowish tint in many scenes. Increasing the brightness level by 100% on my professionally calibrated 65"" plasma couldn't fix the lack of light issue and the yellow tint makes the film look old. If these problems are due to a poor HD mastering process, the disc should by recalled and a ""fixed"" version reissued. If due to the ""directors intent"" I think he screwed up. I don't appreciate a movie that looks like it was actually filmed in 1757 and kept in a box someplace until this release. To bad I gave my DVD version away in anticipation of the Blu-ray release.",1286409600,24,812,4.3841059602649
3246485,4,B000Y5CHIE,"The Film

I haven't seen this flick in years so it was a surprise when the credits finally showed up.  What an amazing film.  It's been said, and I will retort, this is quite a feat for a watchable film to be made from the sprawling novel, let alone such an earthy piece of filmmaking.  This film succeeds on so many levels, and simplicity is a key reason.  Music, acting and excitement; anything you can think of Michael Mann has turned out in force.  And let's not forget about drama.  The sight of Chingachgook reacting to Uncas' death is one you will never forget.  It's powerful stuff.

Now for the Blu-Ray report.  I never picked this one up on DVD, because of the ""Expanded"" edition and I have no clue to what the changes have been for this one.  Frankly, I don't care.  The movie holds up.  The problem with the Blu-Ray is multi-fold.  Sound recording is flat.  The foley is often subdued, which isn't a problem.  But music and voices are muted too - which is a problem.  I had to do some tweaking on my surround to get the best out of it.  Also, the TrueHD audio track IS NOT surround enabled.  I found the option surround track to be superior.

The Blu-Ray

Now for the video.  I am a photographer by trade and I have always held Dante Spinotti's work in the Last of the Mohican's to be among my favorites.  Blu-Ray often has two effects, the first being an enhancement of quality.  On the right screen, you are allowed to see textures, color and details cheated in lesser formats - example.. You can now see rain falling in the cliff chase finally, which I had never noticed before.  The second effect of High Def is there is no longer a mask for photographic flaws.  I will get the grain issue out of the way first saying, there is some grain present, but never to the point of distraction.  However, Last of the Mohicans is plagued by some degree by missed focus.  This is understandable to some level.  Spinotti has often been challenged by Michael Mann's desire to shoot in low light.  Using Panavision it is notoriously difficult to maintain proper focus with wide apertures - that is with times when a shallow depth of field is present.  But there are scenes in plain daylight where the stock just looks either cropped in, or focus has been completely missed.  This issue was distracting.  Inconsistent color processing was also an issue - be it digital or in the celluloid emulsion.  There are times colors bleed with intensity - almost too much.  Where other times - it feels desaturated.

So while the film is a definite 10/10, I would rate the audio a 7/10 and the video a similar 7/10.  This is not a disc that will consistently show off your setup to friends.

All that being said, this is one hell of a movie.  Visual blemishes be damned.  You all can keep your Braveheart discs, I'll take Last of the Mohicans any day of the week.",1286323200,15,2855,4.436293436293436
3246486,5,B000Y5CHIE,"Let me start off by saying that this movie is without a doubt my favorite of all time. I will never give it a rating less than five.  The acting, directing, soundtrack, and shot locations for this film (as well as the best French and Indian War film ever) are an unbelievable combination, and it's a crime it took years for this to come out on Blu-Ray.

This movie was my first Blu-Ray purchase, as I always promised myself this would be my first venture into it.  I can't tell you if this is better or worse than other Blu-Ray movies, but let's compare it to the DVD.  Actually, we can't because it's that much better than the horrible quality of the DVD.  For years I've had to deal with the horrible lighting, the super soft sound where my volume is set at 82 out of 100, and the fact they took out a lot of neat scenes.

I was in awe being able to see the movie finally in amazing quality and look forward to one day getting surround sound.  For those that like the theatrical version, you'll love the movie.  However, I'm still ticked off at Michael Mann.

It's almost like Michael Mann has this obsession that LOTM cannot exceed two hours in length.  While he put in many of the theatrical cuts, he also removed almost all of the good content from the Director's Cut on the DVD.  What makes no sense to me, is some of it, such as the parlay scene between the French and the British were left untouched.  However, the fort battle scenes featuring Duncan were cut, as was the very emotional speech given at the end by Hawkeye's father which perfectly wrapped up the movie.

I cannot fathom why Michael Mann couldn't just put both versions together and instead had to tinker.  For those who really know the movie, you'll also notice the sequence of Magaua and the Sachem converse has changed to where it just seems very awkward.

In the end, if you love this movie, you must buy the Blu-Ray.  Despite the fact that Mann did not put together a true Definitive cut, this is light years better than the DVD.  I just really had hopes that when this was the ""Director's Definitive Cut"", he would have stood by that and just put both versions together, and maybe added a few deleted scenes.

I personally will be interested to see what happens now that the Blu-Ray transfer if complete.  If this movie sells well, I can at least hope they could possibly release another more expanded edition as there were rumors this was going to be a three hour version.",1286323200,12,2452,4.408888888888889
3246487,5,B000Y5CHIE,"This review refers to the Blu-ray of The Last of the Mohicans, ""The Director's Definitive Cut."" Be advised.

The Movie: The Last of the Mohicans is an old favorite of mine and many of my friends. This ""definitive cut"" is new, and is the third cut of the film to see daylight. It seems to incorporate sizeable chunks of the extra footage from the ""Expanded"" edition on standard DVD while jettisoning a lot of footage from the same and including some deleted parts of the theatrical cut, but not all. Comparison showed few significant differences between this cut and the two preceding it; most of the changes came in editing (the battle scenes have all been tweaked a bit) and in shot selection. The good news is it's still The Last of the Mohicans, and it's still a fantastic movie.

The Image: Reviewers elsewhere on the internet have complained about softness or excessive darkness in this Blu-ray's image. After watching the whole thing, I think such complaints are exaggerated. There are a number of soft scenes but the majority of the film is very sharp and the detail is a vast improvement from the standard definition DVD. The massacre after the surrender of the fort and the climactic fight on the mountainside look especially good. As for darkness, a good chunk of the film does take place at night or in dense forest, and there were no dark scenes in the Blu-ray that were not already dark on VHS or DVD. Darkness in some scenes--especially the forest ambush on the road to Fort William Henry--is certainly intentional and (speaking as a native of the area in which the movie was filmed) realistic. Rhododendron thickets are dark. Especially after comparison with the old DVD, this Blu-ray is solid.

The Sound: As far as I can tell with my rather low-budget sound system, the mix on this Blu-ray was very good. The music especially boomed and the reports of weapons were very loud. There were one or two scenes in which the dialogue was rather muddy, such as the scene in which Hawkeye and the escapees of the massacre hide behind the waterfall, but that seems to have been intentional.

Special Features: The commentary by Michael Mann is good and packed with information, both about the film and the historical period in which the film takes place. Mann clearly researched this subject deeply and his commentary is worth listening to. The Blu-ray also includes a very good 40+ minute ""making of."" Lots and lots of good interviews with cast, crew, and consultants, as well as behind-the-scenes footage. The background on Daniel Day-Lewis's preparation for his role was especially informative.

Miscellaneous Complaint: The one thing in the whole package that gets on my nerves is that, in order to access the chapter menu either during the movie or from the main menu, you have to select ""Search"" from the menu and then choose ""Scenes,"" an unnecessary extra step and an annoyance. That's a minor complain, though.

Overall, this Blu-ray does justice to a great movie and was worth the money.

3246488,5,B000Y5CHIE,To all of those who loved the theatrical version of this movie the way that i did...were obviously disapointed with the dvd release.  Well Michael Mann has really come through on the Blu Ray release and has restored the movie back to the way it was meant to be...as was seen in the theatres.  All of the lines from the original taken out have been put back in (including the song by clannad!) with only a few minor changes.
