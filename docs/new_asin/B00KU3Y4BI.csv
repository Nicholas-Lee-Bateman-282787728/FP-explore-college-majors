8661736,4,B00KU3Y4BI,"This is the story on how the US Military dealt with the consequences of Vietnam and its aftermath, the re-organization of the military leading up the the Gulf War and the challenges posed after 9/11 as told from the generals' perspective. Most of the key players were present with a few notable exceptions such as Tommy Franks, Peter Pace and Norman Scharzkopf. Those generals were arguably the best field commanders the Army produced after the Vietnam War.
One of the main stories told is the comparison of the War In Iraq to Vietnam. While the origins of the conflicts and eventual outcomes were completely different, they do have some remarkable similarities. Both were largely supported by the public at first. The cases for intervening were made on false premises and assumptions. Low grade insurgencies and all out civil war ensued which the Army was not prepared to fight. The irony was not lost on the ones who served in Vietnam and went on the command the forces in Iraq.
The most interesting tidbits came up during the discussion of the Battle of Tora Bora. In perhaps the quickest most successful campaign to overthrown a government after WWII in terms of personnel used and speed of execution, we somehow managed to let several hundred of al qaeda's top leadership get away. We had every opportunity to throw every asset into the battle and press home the attack. But the Bush administration was all ready planning for the invasion of Iraq and would not provide any additional assets. Had the al qaeda leadership been killed or captured, the case for invading Iraq would have been extremely difficult to make if not impossible. It was in the Bush's administration's interest to keep Osama Bin Laden alive and free to build public support for invading Iraq. Of note, Tommy Franks, mastermind of the Afghanistan campaign do not appear in this video.",1414800000,,1859,4.867507886435331
8661737,4,B00KU3Y4BI,"The wars of the mid 20th century, particularly Vietnam, have had lasting effects on the US Army even to this day.  These generals are quick to identify some of the problems but not particularly forthcoming in their part of that problem.  True, the skills required in asymmetric warfare are not obvious but, even as they identify those skills, the Army finds it difficult to change.  This is a tendency the 4th generation warfare crowd has been warning us about for many years now.  Senior Army commanders continue to identify the same problems, given enough years of experience, but the lessons never seem to get passed down to the next generation.

On the other hand, these generals cannot be held entirely responsible.  In a sense, the requirements of nation-building are political and strategic problems and not simply a matter of the right tactics.  It has been said that the role of the Army is to kill and break things - which implies a skill set diametrically opposed to those required for nation-building.  In other words, the solution to this problem is not a military solution and expecting the military to resolve the issue is to ask the wrong questions.

An entertaining approach to let the generals speak for themselves and provide a good diagnosis of the problems. But they seem to have few answers for resolving those problems.",1412553600,3,1342,4.8766519823788546
