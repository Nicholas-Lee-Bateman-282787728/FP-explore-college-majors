4335737,4,B004E10JGQ,"Before watching BURKE AND HARE, I had never heard of the notorious murderers and grave robbers, Burke and Hare. I rented the movie because it stars Simon Pegg, Andy Serkis, and Isla Fisher, and marks John Landis return to movie directing (he hadn't directed a major motion picture since 1998). Pegg plays William Burke and Serkis portrays William Hare. Burke and Hare are a couple of immigrants to Scotland from Ireland. They've done all sorts of odd jobs to stay afloat, but are running out of money. After their latest scheme fails, they return home, excited at the prospect of collecting the rent money from one of their boarders. However, upon returning home Hare's wife, Lucky, informs him that they won't get any money because the boarder died. They attempt to dispose of the body, but then learn that Dr. Robert Knox (Tom Wilkinson) at the Edinburgh Medical College is in need of bodies for his work. So, Burke and Hair bring the body to the College and are a paid a nice sum with the promise of more if they can bring more bodies. Knox is a great surgeon but all the ""sanctioned"" bodies are being used across town at Edinburgh's other medical school by Dr. Monro (Tim Curry) so Knox is in great need. Hare thinks they've found their next business because Edinburgh is full of people just waiting to die, but who just need a little help. Burke isn't so sure and is conflicted by the whole enterprise. Then Burke meets Ginny Hawkins (Isla Fisher), a performer who wants to launch the first full-female cast of Shakespeare's MacBeth. Sensing a possible way to keep meeting Ginny, Burke agrees to finance her production and, thus, the killings continue.

BURKE AND HARE is a dark satirical comedy. The title characters are murderers, but the script really makes one sympathize with them. For instance, in this film, Burke doesn't enjoy killing, but he needs money because he loves Ginny and the only way he can spend any time with her is by producing her play. Hare isn't quite as likeable, but is more of a lovable fop. Landis has said in an interview that he imagined the duo being an evil Laurel and Hardy and that's a good description of how they come off in this movie. There's a lot of layers of comedy from pure physical sight gags and slapstick to more subtle humor and witty wordplay.

All of the actors give great performances (it was nice to see Tim Curry restrained for a change). The sets and costumes are period perfect. You really get the feel of what 1828 Edinburgh, Scotland must have been like.

I enjoyed BURKE AND HARE. It was one of those rare video treasures. It caught my eye on the shelf at the local video store and I figured that with Pegg and Serkis and Landis directing, it couldn't be too bad. It was a delight. There have been some comparisons of this film to AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON. That movie was a horror movie. BURKE AND HARE is not. BURKE AND HARE is a comical satire that just happens to revolve around two infamous murderers. If you spend a couple hours with BURKE AND HARE, you won't be disappointed.

The DVD includes a lot of extras including interviews with all the stars, bloopers, a look at the behind the scenes, trailer, and more.",1334448000,4,3187,4.576182136602452
4335738,3,B004E10JGQ,"19th century Edinburgh grave robbers Burke & Hare have been the subject of at least 4 films prior to this one (5 if you count Val Lewton's THE BODY SNATCHER (1945) which has the same setting and plotline but only one grave robber). 1) THE GREED OF WILLIAM HART aka HORROR MANIACS (1948) with the legendary Tod Slaughter which had tremendous censorship and legal difficulties as a relative of Hare's threatened to sue, 2) THE FLESH & THE FIENDS (1959) with Peter Cushing, Donald Pleasence, and George Rose which after 50 years is still the best version, 3) BURKE & HARE (1972) a very uneven combination of broad melodrama and peepshow comedy that capitalizes on the then new lack of censorship with lots of gratuitous nudity. It also has a dreadful, totally inappropriate soundtrack, and 4) THE DOCTOR & THE DEVILS (1985) with Jonathan Pryce, Stephen Rea, Timothy Dalton and based on a screenplay by Dylan Thomas written in 1953 which changes the characters' names for probably the same reason as GREED OF WILLIAM HART. That film, directed by horror veteran Freddie Francis, is a dull affair which, considering the talent involved, should have been much better than it was. That bring us to this new version in which director John Landis said he views B & H as a pitch black version of Laurel & Hardy.

It looks as if Landis took the four previous versions and borrowed bits and pieces from them. Like THE DOCTOR & THE DEVILS, the settings and the period costumes are superb. The squalor of 19th century Edinburgh (most notably the crowd scenes) is beautifully captured just as in THE FLESH & THE FIENDS. Tom Wilkinson's Doctor Knox is as over the top as anything Tod Slaughter ever did and the comedy bits and undistinguished soundtrack recall the 1972 film. This BURKE & HARE is meant to be a black comedy in the Ealing Studios tradition but the trademark Ealing subtlety is definitely missing. Not that it's totally without merit. Simon Pegg and Andy Serkis make a fine Burke & Hare. Serkis, in particular, is given a chance to shine as an actor not just a CGI creation like in LORD OF THE RINGS or RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. It's certainly possible to mix black comedy and horror. Landis himself did it brilliantly 30 years ago in AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON but here I'm afraid lightning failed to strike twice. BURKE & HARE is definitely worth seeing especially if you're fans of Serkis & Pegg and it has odd moments that stay with you like the burning of the photographs or the final shot of the real Burke's skeleton. I didn't hate the film but I was definitely disappointed with it.",1330646400,5,2598,4.6355748373101955
4335739,2,B004E10JGQ,"""Burke & Hare"" is a handsomely produced film, with a lot of notable actors, including some old pros in cameos (Christopher Lee and Ronnie Corbett among them), but it is like the proverbial souffle that fails to rise, no matter how slavishly one follows the recipe.  Andy Serkis and Simon Pegg play the lead duo of graverobbers, but for some reason, they're incapable of digging up a laugh--and this is supposed to be a black comedy version of the story of Edinburgh's historical ""resurrection men.""  After a while, watching bit after bit, gag after gag, setup after setup, either fall flat and lay there or limp to a non-resolution, gets a bit depressing. John Landis has long been one of the cinema's most overrated comedy directors, but here he proves that whatever talent he may once have possessed has vanished like smoke.  To be fair, though, Mel Brooks probably could not have breathed any life into the lame script by Piers Ashworth and Nick Moorcroft.  The ubiquitous Tom Wilkinson works overtime to try and keep things alive, but it's a lost cause.  The result looks like a film assembled from rejected takes.  The two stars therefore, are for the sense of period, excellent costuming, and decent photography (by John Mathieson).  But when the scenery chews up the actors, even good actors like Serkis, Pegg and Wilkinson, you know you're in trouble.  There is also an interesting musical score by Joby Talbot...interesting, but totally wrong for the film. All in all, a sad misfire.",1329264000,3,1492,4.869565217391305

4335741,3,B004E10JGQ,"I rented this film based on the strength of the cast but I wish I'd researched it a bit first.  Loosely based on a true story, Burke & Hare is about two men who commit increasingly heinous murders and sell the corpses to a school of anatomy (circa 1828).

I can handle some dark comedies if I find myself empathizing with the characters on some level (as with the premise of Horrible Bosses), but I didn't find Messrs. Burke and Hare to be very sympathetic at all.

I must admit I didn't watch the entire movie.  I decided to cut my losses and quickly skim through the remainder of the film after an extended sequence where B&H are trying to zero in on the perfect way to kill their victims (after several mishaps and unusable corpses).

If you're into dark comedies I would imagine this film rates a 4/5 at least - it is well done otherwise.  For me personally it rates a 2/5, so I'll split the difference and call it a 3.",1327708800,2,923,4.275862068965517
4335742,1,B004E10JGQ,"Say you had to pick a director to helm a black comedy about 19th-century Scottish serial killers; John Landis would be a reasonable choice. But the Landis you're dreaming of and the Landis of today are two very different people. So here lies Burke and Hare, a story of two friends who sell their murder victims for scientific dissection, and a non-firing comeback special for Landis. The film is too uneven and unpleasant even for a movie about slicing bodies up. But as a document that captures an odd moment in Landis's already odd career, and a moment in time when you could get both Simon Pegg and Andy Serkis in the same room, this movie is a compelling failure.",1325116800,5,667,4.566666666666666
4335743,5,B004E10JGQ,"Attention to detail is usually a quick indicator of overall quality in a product and this rendition of the infamous 1820s Burke and Hare, Edinburgh murders began with quality performances from a great cast and continues with the authenticity of the setting, costuming and props. You truly feel as if you are a cohort with our medical supply entrepreneurs as they roam those streets looking to supply the local medical institutions. Historically accurate as their business was particularly lucrative given the increased demand for, and declining supply of - their product.

It is a comedic interpretation in every way possible from slapstick to high humor to incompetence. It is also dark given the people chosen to be dispatched with and the methods used. At times you feel sympathetic toward Burke and Hare and at times disgust at the complicity at all levels of society - with money often the source of ""looking the other way"".",1324944000,12,929,4.993548387096774

4335745,3,B004E10JGQ,"""I have got enough money put aside to start our new business...funeral parlors."" This is the very funny true story about Burke (Pegg) and Hare (Serkis). They started off as simple grave robbers trying to make a living in Scotland in the 19th century. When an opportunity that is more lucrative comes along they jump at the chance. The job - providing cadavers to ""teachers"" around the city. The thing that gets them into trouble is how they find the cadavers. This is an extremely dark comedy that makes you laugh at things you should not laugh at. The plot of the movie deals with two guys who go around killing people for money. The fact that Simon Pegg is the main star is the reason I watched this to start. The supporting cast is also fantastic, but the movie on it's own is pretty entertaining and worth a watch. While not as funny as ""Shaun Of The Dead"", it does have that type of should I laugh at this quality to it. The best way I can describe it would be a comedy along the lines of ""Sweeney Todd"". If you like that movie you will like this one, no singing and more laughs. Overall, worth a watch, unless you are easily offended. I give it a B.

4335746,4,B004E10JGQ,"Very much in the tradition of classic, sly, gentle and darkly funny Ealing comedies, ""Burke & Hare"" takes a genuine point in history and plays with it, all the while remaining tongue in cheek, true to its premise, delightfully unpredictable and profoundly human. Anyone that still thinks fondly of the very original ""The Ladykillers"", ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"", ""The Lavender Hill Mob"" or others from Ealing's golden age will be more than pleased to see that style arrive refreshed, updated, carefully written -- the multiple plot lines add considerable depth, bringing this humour noir / period comedy in line with 21st century expectations -- and wonderfully produced and performed. We'll see if ""Burke & Hare"" manages to stand the test of time as well as those earlier films, but it easily surpasses any requirements needed to engage your interest and your humor for a near pitch-perfect 90 minutes.",1315267200,7,903,5.108108108108108

Pegg and Serkis hold their own amid a cast full of scene stealing character actors (notably Christopher Lee, Tim Curry, and Ronnie Corbett), all bringing their A-games.

4335763,4,B004E10JGQ,"A macabre, darkly humorous tale directed by the long-dormant John Landis and starring Simon Pegg, Andy Serkis and Isla Fisher, with deft (daft?) supporting roles provided by the wonderful duo of Tom Wilkinson and Tim Curry.

The film chronicles the 1828 exploits of Mssrs. Burke and Hare, who turned the provision of dead bodies for medical research into a demented and starkly illegal Shark Tank opportunity well ahead of its time.  As a period piece Burke and Hare survives minimally, but the dialog is a stitch and the goofy interplay between Pegg and Serkis, as well as the sight gags, make for a truly fun entertainment interrupted occasionally by scatological humor including gross visuals of rotting or dismembered humans.

Some reviewers upset at the ""trivialization"" of murder are indeed missing the point.  Whereas ""Burke and Hare"" spends little dramatic energy focusing on the true consequences of such heinous pursuits, it's not the first time a movie or play took on the macabre- Sweeney Todd anyone?

At times broadly comedic, the last third of the movie invokes both conscience and a budding romantic relationship (which fuels the murderous indiscretions).  While not necessarily a ""happy"" ending in the true sense, it's nevertheless an enjoyable and heartfelt ride.",1401667200,3,1281,5.224390243902439
4335764,3,B004E10JGQ,"Having really enjoyed Paul The Movie, I found this mildly disappointing.

The plot is that the titular Burke and Hare are down on their luck in 19th century Edinburgh, United Kingdom, where a new law means that Dr Know cannot get cadavers for his anatomy class. Through a series of contrivances, our ""heroes"" wind up murdering people and selling their bodies before the law catches up with them.

The cast is strong: in addition to Simon Pegg, there is Tim Curry, Isla Fisher (who looks very hot), Bill Bailey, Hugh Bonneville, Ronnie Corbett, Stephen Merchant, Paul Whitehouse... you get the idea. Best of British.

There are two problems with this movie. The first is the ""comedy"" tag. There were instances where I smiled, but there were no belly laughs.

The second is the ending. Accepting that this is not a historically accurate film, the ending was disappointing because all of the worst villains got away whilst the ""hero-villain"" sacrificed himself for an ideal that never existed.

The sex scenes mean that this is unsuitable for children, but the characters don't have enough depth to generate the tension necessary to grip and adult. Ultimately this was an average film that you will watch once, and then never again.",1390003200,2,1229,4.917874396135265
4335765,4,B004E10JGQ,"Its understandable the division of opinion on this one.. black comedy of this nature is an acquired taste, and tonally, this is an odd mixture.  And yet, something about the over-the-top Scottish-ness, and the surreal laugh out loud moments involving spurting arteries and cadavers in barrels, make this a welcome modern addition to the Ealing Studios output.  The story is summed up in the old nursery rhyme, Up the close and doun the stair, But and ben wi' Burke and Hare. Burke's the butcher, Hare's the thief, Knox the boy that buys the beef., with apologies to those not conversant in Scots.  Simon Pegg and Andy Serkis are the two Irishmen who find themselves drawn into a world of supplying bodies to teaching surgeon Andy Wilkinson, and when graverobbing itself seems too dangerous (due to the militia led by Ronnie Corbett!) the solution seems clear  the way to get the freshest cadavers, is to be the reason they become cadavers in the first place.
The tone is kept resolutely light, bordering on the slapstick at times, as if it doesnt quite have the conviction to let the material speak for itself, in the way that director John Landiss earlier American Werewolf in London did, or earlier Ealing classics such as The Ladykillers.  But it works thanks to a cast giving it their full conviction, and that includes some marvellous cameos which it is far more fun to discover for yourself rather than have me point at them here.  Isla Fisher and Jessica Hynes are terrific value as the significant others, Isla in particular providing a few moments of pathos and calm between the murders, as she struggles to understand Macbeth.
Shot well, well acted, but tonally .. well, odd.. this is bound to be an acquired taste.  But if you like the offbeat nature of, for example, Plunkett and MacLean, I hope youll give this a shot too.",1388448000,,1835,4.751572327044025

I loved and identified with Simon Pegg's character - William Burke - and his undying (literally!) love for the beautiful actress Ginny. Tim Curry - in his role as a conniving physician - was magnificent. Overall, this was a brilliantly silly satire with amusing lines from a fantastic cast (besides Pegg and Curry, this movie features Andy Serkis, Tom Wilkinson, Isla Fisher, among others). However, this movie is not for the squeamish or faint at heart :)",1386633600,,531,4.835164835164835
4335767,5,B004E10JGQ,"I was gently convinced to watch ""Burke & Hare"" after my husband raved about Simon Pegg's and Andy Serkis's performance as the duo of Burke and Hare in the aptly named film. I also wanted to check it out as a way to further understand what my husband likes and I unexpectedly liked the movie more than I originally felt I would.  The movie centers around two men who resort to desperate measures for their financial survival and is partially influenced by true life events from the 1800's.  There have been times that I have been tempted to resort to crazy and legal means to improve my quality of life for my husband and I (while being harm-free to other people).  This is only due to being subjected to certain life tests even after doing the ""right things"" for myself and for the greater good of others in life and witnessing the charmed lives of others who have little concern for doing what is ""right"". It is mainly my conscience that has stopped me from acting on such dark temptations.  Naturally, these life experiences helped me understand the motivations of the characters and plot of the movie.  For instance, the characters of Burke & Hare are shown figuring out the best way to flesh out a decent living for themselves after Lucky (Hare's wife) expresses concern on how to meet their basic expenses.  My husband greatly admired the comedy that Pegg and Serkis provided through their wacky portrayals of Burke and Hare conducting ""business"" for a doctor in one of Scotland's top medical schools. However, he let me know that Jessica Hynes portrayal of Lucky was among one of his favorite performances in the movie. This was due to Lucky being portrayed as a shrewd encourager of her husband's enterprise and her aggressive nature as the brain-trust in their marriage.  In contrast, I enjoyed the love story brewing between  Simon Pegg's William Burke and Isla Fisher's Ginny Hawkins. It was both fun and comedic watching the character of Ginny Hawkins convincing Burke to fund her thespian dreams using her natural beauty, wit, and feminine wiles.

4335774,3,B004E10JGQ,"A 2010 UK comedy ""Burke and Hare"" centers on William Burke (Simon Pegg) and William Hare (Andy Serkis), real-life notorious grave robbers turned murderers, whose criminal activities inspired Robert Louis Stevenson's short story ""The Body Snatcher"" (basis of a 1945 Robert Wise horror film). Set in the nineteenth century Edinburgh, the new film tells in a comedic way how the small-time crooks Burke and Hare stumbled upon their first dead body and later managed to provide corpses for the eminent anatomist Doctor Robert Knox (Tom Wilkinson).

Another noteworthy thing about ""Burke and Hare"" is that the dark comedy is directed by John Landis, who hasn't made a feature film in years (his last being ""Susan's Plan"" in 1998). Those who grew up watching American comedies in the 1980s still remember his name and works such as ""The Blues Brothers"" and ""Trading Places.""

Though it still has moments, especially when displaying the director's dry (and twisted) sense of humor, ""Burke and Hare"" is a far cry from his best works. After 30 minutes in, where the film veers erratically from comedy to drama with Simon Pegg's Burke falling for Ginny (Isla Fisher), a former prostitute reciting Shakespeare at a bar, it becomes clear that the film has really no story to speak of. What is worse, the film's tone wavers uncertainly from dark comedy to pathos, giving us an impression that by then the film has run out of ideas.

The stars are doing their best, and the film has a few amusing cameos (including Christopher Lee and Ray Harryhausen) and interesting historical references, but considering the source material's great potential, ""Burke and Hare"" is really a missed opportunity.",1358553600,2,1680,5.0359712230215825

Lol) makes it more interesting.  Yet, with all this good, I went away faintly disappointed that it wasn't better.",1510099200,,277,4.3076923076923075

8426390,4,B004E10JGQ,"This was a fun romp of a dark comedy. I enjoyed seeing Ronnie again and I fondly remembered watching ""The Two Ronnies"" with my dad when I was a kid. Although based on factual events, about the only facts I found were the names of Burke and Hare, the two doctors, and the victims. Other than that the film went for dramatic license. In truth Burke did not confess to protect his friends and gain a conjugal visit with his actress girlfriend. Since there was little evidence of any crimes and the four people involved, Burke, Hare, and their wives, were giving conflicting stories, authorities focused on one person, in this case Mr. Hare. Contrary to the movie, there was, in fact, a trial. After offering Hare immunity he turned King's Evidence and testified against Burke. Burke's wife was let go for lack of evidence while he was found guilty and sentenced to death. Hare's wife, who was not named Lucky, was released. Both women fled Edinburgh after being confronted by angry mobs. Hare was kept in prison for his own protection and spirited out of Scotland to Ireland in disguise and at night. He was recognized in Ireland and sought police protection. The three disappeared shortly after that and nothing else is known about them. Burke was executed and his body was dissected by Dr. Monro. Burke's skeleton is on display at the Anatomical Museum of the Edinburgh Medical School. Before being hanged Burke made another confession and placed most of the blame for the murders on Hare. Dr. Knox did not flee to America and become a traveling medical showman. Hare and his wife did not open a Funeral Parlor. There was no actress girlfriend.

I understand why the film makers did what they did to paint Burke as a love struck man, which caused him to partake in the acts he did, and then he confessed to protect his friends and lover. This makes Burke a far more sympathetic character.

Even with diverging from the truth so much, this is still a fun, dark comedy. Simon Pegg and Andy Serkis work well together and I hope they have more opportunities to work together.",1486512000,2,2070,4.6530054644808745
