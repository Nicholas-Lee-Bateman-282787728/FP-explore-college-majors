3011027,3,B000Y0J37C,"I wanted to help teach and expose my two young children (2 and 3 years old) to Japanese since I speak it but my spouse does not.  I loved the idea of this DVD series covering topics only related to young children (as opposed to playing a second language learning DVD geared towards adults).  However, I expected the DVD to show Japanese children speaking Japanese or at least have a Japanese setting, but the video clips only showed American children with romanized subtitles displayed on each clip.  I was disappointed that their method of language learning was disassociated with culture, and that they didn't use the Japanese hiragana characters when spelling the words/phrases.  Although children can still pick up words and their meanings through watching the DVD, I was disappointed at how it didn't feel ""Japanese"" at all.",1357516800,,829,4.9855072463768115
3011028,4,B000Y0J37C,"I ordered Little Pim for my 2 year old because I have heard how important it is to expose children to different languages at a young age when they learn differently than adults and because I am taking a Spanish course and I thought at the very least he could watch Little Pim with me while I study giving us both exposure to vocabulary. I have been pleasantly surprised with how much my son enjoys it. He has always been a fan of Baby Noah and Baby Signs and other movies from the Baby Einstein collection and asking to watch them specifically and now he begs to watch ""Pim"". He repeats words as it is playing and will say the words in both english and spanish. We are excited to take him to a local language school in our area that does immersion play groups for toddlers because I think he will pick it up fast as he already is able to tell you the english translation for some words from the video if you say them to him in spanish when the video isn't playing.
It is nice because it is broken up into 5 minute segments/episodes and each episode introduces a new vocabulary. My son loves animals and enjoys watching it as Pim the Panda introduces each episode with musical background.
If your child has interest in Baby Einstein type movies I would definately recommend this if you are looking to expose them to a 2nd language.",1295481600,2,1330,4.3453815261044175

3011031,4,B000Y0J37C,"My two-year-old son got the triple-DVD set for Christmas, and has already watched all of them. I am a native speaker of Russian, have a degree in English and linguistics. Overall, I would recommend this product to parents who want to introduce (emphasis on ""introduce"", not ""teach"") their children to a foreign language and have extra cash to spend. First, the ""pluses"":

- enjoyable video sequences that (in my son's case) seem to be able to hold a young toddler's attention
- a cute little Panda animated character helps to ""navigate"" through vocabulary
- some reinforcement techniques (words and phrases are repeated in (slightly) different situations
- English subtitles (selectable from main menu) for parents
- Onscreen transliteration text helps with pronunciation

Now the minuses:

- DVD menu does not have selections for individual video segments, thus you're forced to cycle through using the forward button if you want to find a particular video segment (there are about 10 segments for each DVD)
- Transliteration text is not very consistent and in some cases -- wrong
- No actual Russian text. That would be very helpful to parents who can speak the language and to kids who are bi-lingual and learning to read.",1262044800,11,1225,5.024630541871921
3011032,5,B000Y0J37C,"We recently adopted an two year old from Mexico and bought this series to expose her to her native culture and language. Raising a child here in Des Moines, we wanted our daughter to understand her own unique background. Learning Spanish is a first step.

We played the DVDs and watched with her and were immediately impressed with the quality of the animation and the thoughtful and insightful way language is taught. It's even helped my wife and I to brush up on our Spanish. Sitting with our daughter and sharing in the process has been an eye opener - watching the learning process first hand is exciting. She's now using several of the words she learned and in the proper context! My wife and I are amazed!!!!",1259280000,3,714,4.578125

8230644,1,B000Y0J37C,"I am Italian and while I like the concept, the voiceover is clearly made by somebody who has never learned the language well. I don't want my kid to be confused because in the family we pronounce the same words correctly. The stress and accent and the vowels are all a little funky. I guess if you want your kid to speak the equivalent of an obscure ancient dialect you will be fine.",1455408000,,383,4.260273972602739

8230649,5,B000Y0J37C,"We received the Little Pim DVD relating to food when my toddler was about a year old.  It amazed me how captivated she was at the Panda cartoon and the shots of the kids eating/ preparing various foods.  At that time, my child would not focus on anything for very long, but she would watch the entire DVD without losing focus!  We decided to purchase Wake Up Smiling as a new Little Pim DVD for her.  This DVD has the same format as the other, with short segments introducing an activity using the Spanish Language.  My daughter loves it! The Little Pim series is definitely a fun, educational tool for toddlers!",1380758400,,612,4.4774774774774775

I think my husband and I are getting more out of it then my toddler, it would probably help if either one of us had a background in japanese, but we do not. We just thought it would be helpful for her to learn since we live in Hawaii.",1358121600,,371,3.769230769230769
