515514,3,6302784743,"Is it just me, or is that lovely song ""Anna's Reverie"" (written by Paul Baillargeon) one of the most beautiful and sadly overlooked songs in film?  I've never heard anyone comment on it and it is truly haunting.  As for the film, it is full of terrific ideas and is not badly put together, but it is decidedly amateurish and marred by ugly production values that are quite dated.  Overall, the film is a perfect candidate for a remake, having good ideas but needing a more polished production to pull them off.  Byrne does a nice job in the title role, however, and the song makes it worth a look. . .",1066780800,30,601,4.339285714285714

515678,4,6302784743,"Certainly George Orwell [1984, Aldous Huxley [Brave New World, Ira Levin [Boys From Brazil], are among a select coterie of writers of the genre ""Science Fiction"" where the 'science' far outstrips the 'fiction' component.  The 'Fright Factor' of bug eyed monster flicks like Alien pales when compared with films like the ones mentioned above.

Anna to the Infinite Power, although deficient in many aspects of its production, is one of those Terrifying films, simply because I know there are brilliant scientists who are, in fact, 'Going There' and doing unmentionable things. This knowledge blisters my mind, and often makes gentle relaxing sleep all but impossible. I believe, without being a clairvoyant, that an unfortunate end awaits our race.  The sad part about this is that we will not get 'taken out' by a natural cataclysmic disaster, but by our own idiotic egomaniacal hand.  My father said to my brother and me when we were children, in his gentle understated way, that the most dangerous combination in life was that of arrogance and ignorance. And he was right on the money. But now that I have lived into my seventh decade, and have experienced much more than I wish I had and have been privy to much more than I wish I now know, I must add my own perspective to that of my Father's, so many years ago. And it is this: while there is no doubt that the combination of arrogance and ignorance produces a very unfortunate dynamic, perhaps an even more catastrophic melange is that of Arrogance and Brilliance.

This little gem, Anna to the Infinite Power is, again, right on the money, but the creative craft of the director and all the other production ingredients did not have the combined skill to make this a superb story.  And yes, I agree that the title song that insinuates itself through the film is an absolutely haunting and painfully beautiful musical creation, a ""Five Thumbs Up"" act of incredible creative sensitivity.

First half is boring, and the acting is, at best, marginal.
I realize that there are those afraid of cloning, and these days more specifically GM, but as with all technology, the best way to deal with fear is with education.

SPOILER ALERT

Unless there were extreme world wide sanctions against human cloning, killing people is not a good course (seldom is.) So why are villains always so simplistic?

If I got several viable clones in attempting to recreate a great physicist, and none were idiots I'd be thrilled. If all were healthy and developed different interests, well, they will all have potential to do great things.

The difference between that potential and it's reality often lies in the environment--if someone is watching and waiting to give the right boosts at the right time, any child can reach a higher potential.

There are hundreds of better written SF stories about clones which should have been better converted to films.

It's a shame so many studios are using plot lines outdated in the 1950's.",1426464000,,1025,4.862068965517241

A spoiled, self-centered child changed by discipline and exposure to music, a self-centered brother who gives up (spoiler alert) the thing that matters to him most to help his sister who he once said he hated, thereby demonstrating true love.  A family torn apart by deception brought together by love and forgiveness.  An unexpected twist at the end.  A good old-fashioned story all around.  Very interesting old computers too.  Haven't seen those before.  I would watch this again.",1393372800,,604,5.229166666666667

516128,3,6302784743,"I have to agree with one of the other reviewers that the tune ""Reverie"" is a show stealer. A very beautiful tune.  I would love to have the song on a CD to listen to.  The little girl in the starring role pretty much saves the film from the amateurish camera work and I don't think any of the adults in the film were quite as believe-able as her and sometimes her older brother.  There were some definite holes in the story that could have been developed as well.  (Why did the people in the airplane just give up and not follow through on the security snafu?) We'll just buzz her a few times and then let her go home for a couple of months?)  All in all, it gave me something to watch on a day when I wasn't feeling very well and it held my interest enough to see it through.",1378598400,,776,4.045751633986928

Watching it as an adult, I have to say that it is just as good as I remembered it. My husband and kids loved it too. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so I'll just say that the plot has withstood the test of time--the ""events"" are still relevant and being written about in children's literature today.

I would consider showing this to a classroom--5th grade and up. However, there is one short part where the father is staying in a room at the YMCA, smoking a cigarette and drinking alcohol (if I remember correctly). My husband and I had a laugh over this (it was such a 1980's stereotype) but parents might object.",1292976000,11,772,4.181208053691275

516141,5,6302784743,"I first stumbled onto this film searching for movies that starred Martha Byrne, a lovely and talented actress whom is best known for her work on As the World Turns. I bought an old VHS I found of this film originally and loved it. I was absolutely ecstatic to find it on DVD! The film quality is fairly low as it was done on a small budget in the early eighties, but despite the low film quality it is an excellent movie! Martha Byrne portrays a young girl who figures out she is the subject of a scientific experiment and sets out to uncover the mysteries surrounding it. Watching this film today, one might roll their eyes a couple of times at some dialogue here and there, but in comparison to some family films put out today, it is much more realistic and has much more genuine heart behind it. A younger sister of mine is nothing if not a modern teen and when she watched this movie with me, she loved it! There's just something about the film that brings out a sense of nostalgia, adventure, and warmth. This movie would be a great addition to any family's film collection.

7831674,5,6302784743,"11 year-old Anna Hart (Martha Byne) seems to have some problems dealing with people, she also has a few problems like kleptomania, and being amoral. Her neighbor and piano teacher Michaela Dupont/Anna Parkhurst (Donna Mitchell) is not helping; if anything she seems to be aggravating the situation (or is she supposed to be guiding the child to some end. Her mother Sarah (Dina Merrill), tends to look the other way as she seems to know something that anna does not.

One night Anna sees her doppelganger on TV and decides to investigate; this will lead her to a secret about herself and a person once known as Anna Zimmerman. Often overlooked is the help and support she receives from her older brother Rowann (Mark Patton.)

There is a lot of danger and mystery to the story. As it unfolds there are some twists and turns. You will find your self kibitzing during potential escape scenes. In the end you decide who the good guys are and who the bad are.

The movie was based on a novel 1983 ""Anna to the Infinite Power"" by Mildred Ames. The Novel and movie are closely aligned.

What is missing from the book is the haunting sound of ""Anna's Reverie"" written by composer Paul Baillargeon Sung by Christine Andreas German Lyrics by Charles & Marion Linton.

If you find this film intriguing then you may want to read the Replica book series by Marilyn Kaye, starting with ""Amy Number Seven.""",1504742400,35,1392,4.642276422764228

I love science fiction and the idea of cloning.

This movie is very old fashioned and dated - - no internet and no cell phones, etc.
I looked it up, and I was surprised that this movie is from 1983.
It definitely looks like about 1975.

The last five minutes is a twist followed by an unclear ending.

I would recommend this movie if you like science fiction fantasy and old movies (because it looks and feels a lot older than it is),
even though it is slow-moving and the acting is poor.

This is a movie that should have a remake.",1466812800,,562,4.214953271028038
