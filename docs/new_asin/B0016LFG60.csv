I am already a huge Stooges fan as is my husband so we couldn't be happier with this purchase. Also, there is a black and white version if you like the old Hollywood feel while watching these. Mike Nelson was fabulous as usual. 5 stars!!",1395878400,,375,4.611940298507463
8263106,4,B0016LFG60,The DVD has awsome COLOR!!! but the 3 men that made it really made me mad with their commentary inbetween every comedy short. I thought they were really bashing the stooges. Great DVD i advise just to skip over the commentary.,1277251200,2,226,4.536585365853658
8263107,5,B0016LFG60,"Watchin' the Stooges for about 50 years and here's my chance to watch several good scenes for the first time! Talking about ""Swing Parade"", a low budget musical with high powered results: Louis Jordan doing two production numbers, including a time-capsule rendition of ""Caledonia""; Gale Storm doing many smooth ballads.
Gale is excellent playing an unemployed singer just waiting for that first break (should say, first audition), who manages to get hired at the last moment by a wealthy industrialist who needs to hire someone to serve a Process Notice to his son, who (guess what?) owns a club he also sings in. The Three Stooges are the cooks and mayhem creators who befriend Gale, then learn of her mission. Not gonna tell you any more. It's pretty funny.
Connee Boswell plays herself in this surprisingly solid musical comedy; statuesque high society matron who has an eye for the band leader in this club, barely subsisting; she even bounds up to the bandstand to complete a duet started by a younger starlet.
The color processing is brilliant - a great achievement to find a ""lost"" small film with big names, then present it with all the style another production company might offer ""South Pacific"".
Made probably in 1945 and not long before Curly's health required him to retire. He's not 100% ""Curly"", a bit slower, but the roles of all the Stooges are somewhat modified to fit a more sophisticated setting.
The four Public Domain shorts look great, too. A serendipitous occasion to have (apprently) four of their best movies available at an amazing low price.
Extras include an episode of ""My Little Margie""! Five big ones!!!!!",1225324800,,1637,4.913357400722021
