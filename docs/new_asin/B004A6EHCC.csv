I enjoy RLM output, with this being a favorable addition. Please give it a chance. I am not (too) big on detailing movies beyond recommendation. Comparable to Spielberg produced relatively low budgeters and the Troma Production Films.

4295498,1,B004A6EHCC,"All the Red Letter Media fanboys don't want to tell the truth about Feeding Frenzy so I guess I will.

Honestly, Feeding Frenzy is very difficult to recommend to absolutely anyone. The pacing is really poor and just about every scene feels tangential, hopelessly lazy and inconsequential which makes the overall movie a monotonous, amateurish mess that's too patched together with non sequiturs and doesn't engage the viewer like a good comedy should. The humor is juvenile and crass and the gags fall flat thanks to the poor acting and bland direction. The laughs are few and far between because the actors have zero chemistry and they're also too amateurish to carry even a Saturday Night Live skit. The story and the characterization is TIRED, cliche and uninspired and the monsters are disappointingly bland as well. Imagine The Langoliers combined with My Name Is Bruce crossed with Family Guy. Not unlike My Name is Bruce, the humor in Feeding Frenzy is extremely forced and derivative and all of the characters come off as unlikeable smartasses. The outtakes are a little fun though.
I think people who gave this movie five stars are being WAY too generous. It really is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and it does not get a pass just because it's independent or low budget or because the same guys that made the Star Wars reviews made this. If I were you I would just stick with the GREMLIN films, Sam Raimi's EVIL DEAD series and Peter Jackson's early films.
If you like anti-humor and small ironies then I recommend you waste your money on Feeding Frenzy. Just make sure to lower your expectations significantly because this is one of the most obnoxious movies ever made.",1323388800,2,1688,4.780821917808219
4295499,5,B004A6EHCC,"I love the redlettermedia guys, so I took a chance on this.  Feeding Frenzy is a fun, if goofy, throwback to cheesy 80's horror schlock.  Low, very low, budget, but still well done and very tongue-in-cheek.  If you've spent way too many Saturdays watching C and D grade sci-fi/horror flicks over the years as I have, you'll enjoy this homage.  A silly plot, corny acting, lots of blood, and even a gratuitous pillow fight make Feeding Frenzy worthwhile, plus a lot of behind-the-scenes extras.",1321660800,2,493,4.833333333333333
4295500,5,B004A6EHCC,"This movie is different.  And I don't like it when things are different.

It's great to actually see Plinkett in a movie.  For those who are clueless, look up ""red letter media,"" specifically their Star Wars episode 1 review, on youtube.  It's like the only reason I bought this movie, because I loved their reviews so much.",1318464000,2,324,4.631578947368421
4295501,4,B004A6EHCC,"The guys responsible for the famous Star Wars reviews and Mr Plinkett released this last year. Turns out to be not particularly easy to get hold of - you can only buy it from them and it seems to take 3 weeks to get here to the UK. Anyway.

I knew it would be low budget, but I also knew it was tongue in cheek and I'd read a few reviews that said it was pretty good fun.

Yes. I fully agree. Feeding Frenzy is great fun. I wanted it to be good as well - I think Mike Stoklasa and Jay Bauman are fundamentally funny guys who, judging by their reviews (Check out Half in the Bag and the Plinkett stuff), have a good understanding of what makes a good film. They don't disappoint here. Feeding Frenzy got me chuckling a few times - and there was a good few LOL moments.

Yes, it's low budget - but I didn't really care, it was pretty well written. (Unlike say, Phasma Ex Machina/Ghosts from the Machine - which is dreadful).

I wouldn't go so far to say it's fantastic or extremely funny, I think the script could have been sharpened - and someone else said(can't remember who) that the direction in some respects isn't quite as exciting as some of the Plinkett stuff - I'd agree.

If you're looking for a few laughs in the vein of Gremlins/Ghoulies/Critters - this is it (which is what it intended to be). 8/10",1316304000,5,1309,4.22
4295502,5,B004A6EHCC,This film is delicious. All I can really say to describe the raw entertainment contained in the confines of this disk. Special Edition? I'd have to agree. Great film for anyone looking for a low budget film with high amounts of hilarity. Red Letter Media is a group consisting of pure comic genius.,1312934400,2,298,4.6415094339622645
4295503,3,B004A6EHCC,"I became a fan of RedLetterMedia when they released the ""Star Wars"" reviews. I now really enjoy the ""Half In The Bag"" reviews that they started putting out. I wanted to support the group by buying their projects. Long story short, the trailer I saw on this movie got me interested but I really did not like the movie. It seemed to only have a few funny parts far and in between. I could not bring myself to giving it a 1 or 2 stars even though that is how I initially felt. I would rent this movie if possible and have a few drinks with friends. I think I am going to stick with the reviews.",1304985600,8,591,4.05982905982906
4295504,5,B004A6EHCC,"I've been a fan of Mike Stoklasa's work since I came across Oranges Revenge of the Eggplant here on Amazon a few years ago. Since then he's gone on to create some very popular movie reviews on YouTube under the profile name ""Redlettermedia.""

It's no surprise I was excited to hear about Feeding Frenzy last fall. I watched the YouTube trailer a bunch of times and quickly pre-ordered a copy. This movie more than met my expectations!

Feeding frenzy is about the dark humor, crazy situations and characters. You don't even see the little critter-like eating machines much of the time. There are many other more interesting scenes going on between the human characters instead. However, there is certainly more than enough carnage and mayhem to keep that 1980s horror movie feel.

One of the best things about Feeding Frenzy is of course the creativity. Since this movie was made using their own money, Redlettermedia got away with doing a lot of weirdness and dialogue that probably wouldn't have been approved by Hollywood bigwigs.

The production values are obviously very low but seemed like they did the best with what they had. The locations, sets and props were nice, and the movie had that charm like they made it for the love of making movies. And there were some good performances by Gillian Billinger, Ron Lipski, Rich Evans, Jay Bauman, Jocelyn Ridgely, the rest of the cast and even Mike Stoklasa himself. I've never heard of most of these people, and assume they are all unknowns, but bravo.

If the movie weren't enough there are several special features including deleted scenes, making of featurettes, trailers, and also an amusing commentary track done with both directors.

So if you like the idea of South Park-type humor combined with old horror movies you'll probably love Feeding Frenzy. Give it a try.

P.S. Definitely don't watch this with your parents or kids.",1304035200,11,1886,4.893416927899686

8419521,5,B004A6EHCC,"Red Letter Media's tentpole horror comedy squeezes as much joy out of it's molecule-sized budget as an indy movie ever could. Filled with deadpan dialogue that lampoons horror, teen romance and other movie genres, Feeding Frenzy delivers an un-apologetic middle finger to every  slasher film trope you can name.

The quality of the acting does not need to be overstated. Ron Lipski is a serviceable shlub as Jesse Camp, the semi-retarded everyman hero of the film. Better in her role is Jesse's unrequited love interest Christine (Gillian Bellinger), who spends most of the film cutting off Jesse's balls in ever more creative ways.

Balls, incidentally, are the monsters here: bouncing rubber balls with teeth, kept hidden in a wooden crate in a hardware store by Jesse's degenerate boss Mr. Plinkett (played with relish by Rich Evans.) The movie's writers Mike Stoklasa and Jay Bauman deliver guileless performances as Jesse's friends and, together with some pretty clever writing throughout, cement this movie as a worthy satire.

Feeding Frenzy is a crappy film that aims to take the piss out of itself before the MST3K snarks descend upon it, and for the most part pulls off this jiu-jitsu maneuver.",1425254400,,1204,5.096446700507614
8419522,2,B004A6EHCC,"I'm happy to finally review Sam Raimi's Army of Darkness starring Bruce Campbell. Oh no... wait... the cover looks like Army of Darkness. It has some buff guy utilizing a power tool as a weapon of some sort. There is a woman with her arms clutched around the buff guy's leg. It says, ""Feeding Frenzy."" Oh, it's that movie from Redlettermedia a.k.a. those hacks who make those internet Star Wars reviews. The movie is sort of what you would expect these guys to make, especially if you've watched their skits on their web zone. Sort of random, dry, and cheese ball humor. I sure could go for a cheese ball right now. Put it on some crackers. Mmmmm mmmmm. Anyway, the movie has its moments. I laughed when the main character, Jesse Camp (played by Ron Lipski), first interacts with love interest Christine (Gillian Bellinger) and her boyfriend Kyle (Mike Johnson). Kyle's seemingly random gibber jabber was hilarious. The little puppet monsters that make up the movie's main obstacle are charmingly corny and it's a hoot to watch them roll or hop down the street. The use of practical effects is admirable and looks like so much fun.

The problem is that the movie is kind of boring. Most of the jokes aren't laugh out loud funny, but rather smirk-funny. That's not even chuckle-funny! The main characters, Jesse and Christine, are unlikable and uninteresting. You see, in order to bring the viewer into the world the main characters need to have some redeeming quality. I'm not saying a main character needs to be liked, but there needs to be something! Jesse is a shallow personality who thinks he deserves more than he's got and blames the world for his misfortunes. Christine is flat out mean, though I will give her some props on her honesty. Admit it, everyone watched this movie for Mike Stoklasa and Rich Evans (Sorry Jay). And in the movie Mike and Rich play the more interesting characters, but they are not the focus of the film. *SPOILER* Even Kyle (who would have made an awesome main character) has an earlier death and isn't seen for most of the movie. I had more fun watching the behind the scenes footage than I did watching the movie. It was fun watching Jay make the monster suit. And everyone seemed to be having a genuinely fun time working on the film. The jokes in the Making-of documentary were funnier than in the movie itself, like any time Rich Evans says anything.

The lighting in this movie sucks. Jay and Mike even mention in the commentary that they suck at lighting. There are some scenes where the light is too powerful and is makes the actors' faces glow like the Death Star's super laser. Other times shadows cover up the actors' faces almost entirely. Sometimes the shadows even make Gillian Bellinger's nose look larger than it already is. Something that size could threaten this planet's orbit. Probably has mass equivalent to that of a black hole.

I appreciate this movie for how it was made and what it tried to do, but it isn't a movie I'll be going back to watch any time soon. It's no Army of Darkness that's for damn sure. Is 2 stars a bit harsh? Who cares, that's life ya jerks. It is probably a better movie with friends who also like cheesy movies, and/or a 6 pack of beer.
