8077581,5,B000AC7OKM,"First of all, to clarify any confusion, this is the Starter Set for the FIRST SEASON of Case Closed - this box contains Volume 1, which contains episodes 001-009, as well as a one-of-a-kind Wall Scroll and Keychain.

""Case Closed"" - or as it is known in Japan, ""Detective Conan"" - originally aired on US Television in May of 2004 (the series premiered in Japan in January 1996). Placed on the ""Action"" line-up of Cartoon Network's ""Adult Swim"", the show received mixed reviews - mystery fans were in love, while others claimed the show wasn't ""mature enough"". By August, 49 episodes had been aired - and later, the next 30 episodes were released on DVD. Those episodes never aired, as Case Closed vanished from US Television altogether by 2005.

Now, fans will be able to re-live all the excitement and ponder over all the mysteries once again, as the first three seasons are released on DVD. Those new to the series will finally be able to discover the reason why Jimmy Kudo became Conan Edogawa, as well as receive a general intro to the series.

With a new mystery in every episode (some extended into 2-part thrillers), mystery fans will rejoice at this Anime, which constantly boggles the mind and challenges intuition. The series also boasts a charming and enjoyable cast - such as the ""great"" Detective Richard Moore (Mori Kogoro in the Japanese version), his young Karate-master daughter Rachel (Ran) who also serves as Jimmy's love interest, and of course, everyone's favorite detective, Jimmy Kudo - who has the misfortune of being shrunk into the body of a child after being administered a strange drug by two criminals.

This Anime is a terrific treat for the young adventurer/puzzle-solver in any family - but most of the content is not reccomended for children under Age 13. But as some may be surprised, Case Closed isn't as childish as it may seem - Teenagers as well as Young Adults may very well enjoy the series, which contains many of the complex and sentimental emotions which all teenagers experience - except not many can say they were stuck in the body of a 9-year-old when they were!

""Case Closed"", which is currently entering its tenth year on Japanese Television (episode 426 aired on January 16th, 2006) has spawned 9 movies, several OAVs, and is perhaps the closest competitor to America's ""The Simpsons"" in terms of national TV dominance by an animated series. Plenty of reason to at least try the series - or at least, that's what this Reviewer thinks.",1137801600,71,2484,4.794392523364486
