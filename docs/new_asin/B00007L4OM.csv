1819893,5,B00007L4OM,"If you like Jean Leon and Crismon Rivers, you will adore this film!  Not only do you have action, with a body count, but you also have drama and a real plot, with humor and pathos too.  Jean Reno ""the coolest frenchman in the world"", plays a french officer, with an out of control ""cop rage"", and a past with special ops.  When he is given a manidatory leave, he finds out the love of his life (who disappeared 19 years ago), has passed away, and he must travel to Japan for the reading of the will.  From the moment he hits the airport, the action and the plot twists start.  The supporting cast is great, and his old special ops friend provides wondeful comic relief.  I bought the DVD as soon as it came out, and everyone I have lant it to, has thought it was get.  yes it is volient at times, but it can also help you with your golf game (hint).",1054512000,7,849,4.109090909090909
1819894,5,B00007L4OM,"My family recommended this movie to me because of my love for foreign films, Japanese culture, and action movies in general. I'm very glad that they did! It has since become one of my all-time favourites.

Wasabi tells the story of Hubert, a French government agent-turned-police officer who is still longing for his lost love, a fellow spy named Miko whom he met in Japan many years prior. He suddenly finds himself suspended from work after assaulting several innocent bystanders during an arrest, and it's not long after that when he learns his beloved Miko has died. He flies to Japan to hear out her last will and it's here he discovers he not only has a teenage daughter named Yumi that he never knew about, but in several day's time she's to inherit a hefty sum of money which her mother stole from the Yakuza. Yumi has no idea that Hubert is her father, that her parents were spies, or that the Yakuza are after her, so it's up to Hubert to keep her safe -- all while trying to keep her oblivious to all of it. What could possibly go wrong?",1050883200,5,1048,4.430051813471502
1819895,3,B00007L4OM,"A tough Parisian cop, Hubert Fiorentini (Jean Reno), accidentally beats up the Police Chief's son and is asked to take some time off.  In the process, his long lost love of19 years back appears to have died and has given him everything in her will.  This means that he has to go to Japan and as he arrives he also finds out that he has a daughter that is now 19 years old who has developed a huge dislike for authority.  In addition, there is a bank account with 200 million dollars in it and someone is trying to threaten him and his daughter in order to get it.  A question remains as to where the money came from and who is after it.  Wasabi is an action comedy that plays with parody as Hubert drags along his huge .44mm Magnum Smith & Wesson, however, the story gets lost in the jokes.  This serves as the foundation for a cinematic experience that is neither remarkable or common.",1050796800,2,886,4.275449101796407
1819896,5,B00007L4OM,"I took a chance and bought this DVD because I like Jean Reno and Luc Besson.  MONEY WELL SPENT.  Worth every penny!  I loved this movie.  I had to show it to other people.  They loved it!  They went and bought the DVD!  Great action.  Funny action.  A French cop with an Italian name in Japan.  I love it!  The department store scene was priceless.  If you like action movies with humor, get this!  Your DVD collection is incomplete without it.  As far as the guy who didn't like the subtitles... turn them off.  (The subtitles were sanitized.)
Buy it.  Watch it.  Enjoy it.",1049587200,3,574,4.365384615384615
1819897,4,B00007L4OM,"Luc Besson has written an action packed comic book of a movie with Wasabi.  Jean Reno plays a tough, violent cop but with a lonely heart and a past.  Years before, his Japanese girlfriend left him for no obvious reason.  Reno hasn't been able to love since.
Reno is put on suspension with the police after an especially violent episode, and he is 'encouraged' to return to Japan when he discovers his lost love has just died and left him her heir.  Suprise!  When Reno arrives in Japan, the action really takes off.  To tell you more would spoil the fun...
Wasabi takes off with a pulsing electronic beat from the opening scene and keeps moving at a fast pace.  Sure, there are plot holes...  sure, some things don't make sense.  So what?  This isn't a film you see to make you think.  Quite the opposite...  no thinking, just fast paced action with some light comedy mixed in for good measure, all in a sleek technocolor package.
Regarding the DVD, sound quality was excellent.  The video quality was also VERY good, with no contrast problems or compression errors, etc.  Bright colors and a sharp image.  Enjoy!!!",1049155200,45,1115,4.61734693877551
1819898,2,B00007L4OM,"Great movie, great cinematics, great ""no-plot"" and great fun... only if you literally swallow ""Wasabi"" down your throat just exactly as Jean Reno does by almost the end of the movie. Forget the good-ol' Reno-The-Cleaner (Nikita), do not expect any twisting, noir and all-french action-plot: just pretend your are reading a colorful comic-book with plenty of no-brainer action.
Besson should get back to deeper, more elaborated plots, with possibly less color extravaganza and much more atmosphere and acting.",1046649600,6,508,5.5256410256410255
1819899,3,B00007L4OM,"WASABI is a light-weight Hong Kong action film from writer/producer Luc Besson starring the always charismatic Jean Reno.
High-energy hi-jinks unfold when no-nonsense Paris detective Fiorentini (Reno) is summoned to Tokyo to settle the estate of the only woman he loved.  He discovers that her death was not an accident and that he's the father of a strong-willed, red-haired, Japanese teenage daughter (who is worth hundreds of millions of dollars (not yen). Oh yes, and some very, very, very bad guys want the big bucks.
Terrific action set pieces deliver the pleasurable jolt of the spicy title.
I liked this move a lot as a passing diversion.  No profound meaning, but it sure looks great and the action rarely lets up for more than a few minutes.  And there's plenty of sly wit to season the mayhem.
Much better than you might first guess since you're probably wondering why you haven't heard of this title.  With Reno and Besson doing their thing, it's slick and colorful and sly.",1046390400,,986,4.851190476190476

1819901,5,B00007L4OM,"I just saw this yesterday, on a foreign DVD, and it was FAN-TAS-TIC!!!  I've always believed that anything with Jean Reno in it can't be all THAT bad, (ok maybe except Just Visiting). Wasabi has got the pulse-pounding techno beats of the Replacement Killers, the comedy of the Visitors (French), and the colors of the Fifth Element!  Luc Besson was smart to put his seal of approval on this!  The acting from both Jean Reno, and the young girl played by Ryoko Hirosue, is wonderful and you really believe the characters.  The arcade scene is GREAT!  You'll have to see it to believe that Mr. Reno CAN dance...ok maybe not...but, it's still funny!  This is a must see for any Hong Kong action fan who also loves Jean Reno's past films (Mission Impossible, The Visitors, & Ronin).  Definitely worth buying!!!",1044230400,14,806,4.714285714285714
1819902,3,B00007L4OM,"Wasabi is a very popular green-colored Japanese condiment served with sushi or sashimi, and those who love Japanese food must know its pungent taste.  The film takes its title from this wasabi paste (which Jean Reno actually tastes in this film), suggesting the content is sharp and spicy.
Jean Reno is a marverick French cop Hubert, whose way of arresting the criminals are so outrageous that he is suspended from the job by the disgruntled police chief.  But when a detective like him uses a weapon like fists faster than Jackie Chan's, and golf clubs, who can really hate him?  And, hey, he seems to be having a dinner tonight with no other than ever gorgeous ex-Bond girl Carole Bouquet (who appears as a cameo), Hubert has nothing to complain of.
But he left a very bitter memory in Japan, which he could never shake off.  And Hubert receives a ring from a lawyer telling him that his former Japanese girl-friend is dead.  But the news do not end here; it turns out that she left a daughter Yumi, and appointed Hubert as her guardian in her will.  Then Hubert flies to Japan, meets his daughter without telling the truth, but soon he finds that Japanese yakuza gangsters are aiming at Yumi for the unknown reasons.
OK.  The script of Luc Besson (who also produced through his film company Europa) is as thin as you can imagine, and the tone of the film is very light.  There are many actions (including that of using games and ... er ... golf balls), but the charm of the film largely comes from understated humor of Jean Reno as laconic Hubert.  He is not as cool as the assassin in ""The Professional"" (aka ""Leon""); his relations with Yumi is not as convincing as the one with Natalie Portman.  Still, the ride goes pleasantly.  The film is good as pure entertainment.
Some informantion about the production.  Besson obviously made ""Wasabi"" in French and Japanese film market in mind, and he decided to use fully the potentials.  So, French actor Jean Reno is called in, who is very popular in Japan (far more popular in Japan than in USA or UK, I can say) while Japanese popular actress Ryoko Hiroshue is cast as Yumi as his daughter.  The director is Gerard Krawczyk, whose previous action-comedy ""TAXI 2"" was a huge hit in France (more than 10 millions came to the theatre in France, where the population is much smaller than in USA).  So, you may call ""Wasabi"" a unashamed result of market research, or ""product.""  But it is defenitely better to see good product than to watch awful art, isn't it?
The film is mostly shot in Japan.  You can watch briefly a temple of Kyoto (Kiyomizu Temple) and the streets of Tokyo, and will have a glimpse (just a glimpse) of how teenagers are having fun in this city (such as ""game center"" as we call it in downtown of Shibuya) though the film is fast enough not to indulge in showing these scenes.  The film's location is not as exotic as the title implies, and its camera always focuses on the two leads, both of whom are great.  I don't tell you much about super-cool Reno except that he is as good as before, and he shouldn't have been in ""Rollerball.""  About Hirosue, you may feel that her costumes and behaviors are too spanky for a Japanese girl.  In fact, some of her costumes, I admit, look too cartoon-ish, directly from Powerpuff Girls, but they are all intentional.  And as a teacher in college in Japan, I can tell that her dresses are exaggerated, but not so exceptional in downtown Tokyo.  And her frequent use of cell phone is nothing unusual among Japanese teenage girls.
""Wasabi"" is too light-weight, it is true, but it gives fun certainly.  Just don't think.  Enjoy yourself and that's all you have to do.",1042761600,32,3670,4.557926829268292

1819957,5,B00007L4OM,"This is wonderful movie originally in French with English subtitles. If you like lips and words to synch I recommend you watch it with the subtitles.  I thought it was neat that all the actors in this movie dubbed the English voices as well and you can tell when you hear it in English. My favorite two scenes are when Jean Reno's character finds all that money in his account thanks to his ex-girlfriend her infiltration of the Yakuza. Also I like the shootout scene in the gameplay place and the golf scene with the Yakuza leader. It's great movie if you like Japanese culture when it collides with Western or in this case French culture. All the Japanese actors speak French which is great too.
Ryko Hirosue (the actress that plays the 21 year old woman) is also in the award winning ""Departures"" movie and ""Key of Life"" another really great Japanese movie I recommend along with this. She is pretty famous in Japan and is also an accomplished singer too.
Wonderful movie, watch soon as you can!!!",1448236800,,1000,4.58659217877095

The Japanese funeral home was a new one. However, there were 2 teeth-grinders: one, they cast, as his Japanese daughter, a girl who never met a line she couldn't go over the top with, and two the little side-kick was not only emoting, but hard to look at.

This one is a sleeper because if I hadn't gone looking for Reno films I probably would not have found this movie.  Be advised it requires reading subtitles.

The story was interesting with lots of action.  I enjoyed the scene where Reno went to a gaming parlor with his daughter, but he can't dance or do most of the games his daughter's friends like.  Just before he's invited to play a shoot-em-up game, the yakuza arrive, and Reno shoots them all.  He apologizes to the friends for having to run out and not play the game.  All those guns in Japan is not quite believable. Oh!  Wasabi is the name of a very hot condiment that Reno likes.",1385683200,,982,4.225806451612903

Plenty of suspense all the way through. Some flashbacks to Hubert's past with Miko would have been nice, though, along with a resolution to his love life.

1820133,4,B00007L4OM,"`Wasabi', a film directed by Gerard Krawczyk and more importantly written by Luc Besson (`The Professional', `The Fifth Element', `La Femme Nikita') and starring Jean Reno (of many of the same films), is a French take on the American Dirty Harry / Axel Foley type of loose cannon policeman played by Jean Reno in place of Eastwood and Murphy. This may be a bit odd as Reno is much less the hot Murphy figure as he is the French equivalent of the modern Noir hero as played by Harvey Keitel. In fact, Reno and Keitel played exactly the same role in `La Femme Nikita' and the less successful American remake.

The unfortunate thing is that while the plots of `Dirty Harry' and `Beverly Hills Cop' are an interesting framework on which the rogue cop struts his stuff, the plot of `Wasabi' is almost inconsequential. That doesn't mean the film is not fun to watch, as Reno and his two primary supporting characters do great jobs of bulking up their characters to fill out the absence of a meaningful plot.

The story, briefly, is based on Reno's character, Hubert Fiorentini, a Paris policeman and former French intelligence agent in Tokyo is summoned to Tokyo because he is the only beneficiary in the will of a Japanese girlfriend who jilted him 19 years earlier when they both worked in the French embassy in Tokyo, Reno as an intelligence operative and girlfriend as a crypographer.

In Tokyo, we meet the second of the three main characters, an operative colleague of Fiorentini both were France's covert strongarms in Tokyo. Soon, when Hubert sees the lawyer probating the will, we meet the third major character, the 19 year old daughter of the Japanese code breaker and our Hubert. Daughter does not know Hubert is her father, and threatens to kill her father when she meets him. Daughter is a chip off the old Nikita character block, slightly younger, less larcenous, and certainly less dopy, but just as manic and irresponsible.

The big surprise which drives what is taken for a plot in the movie is when Hubert discovers that dead girlfriend / mother has $200,000,000 in her Japanese bank accounts in trust for soon to be legally adult daughter. It seems, however,that this money was somehow taken from a Japanese gangster who does a rather poor imitation of Italian-American gangsters as depicted by directors far less talented or imaginative than Martin Scorsese or Frances Coppela. With a combination of the fact that our Nippon scarface (yes, he has prominent scars on his face) has relatively inept bodyguards and the fact that our hero Hubert is something of especially adept at fanciful means of incapacitating bad guys, Hubert is able to keep himself and daughter out of scarface's clutches for most of Act II.

In the last act, with the help of some heavy duty hardware from the French Tokyo cold war stash of weapons and Hubert's Tokyo wingman, Hubert ultimately teletransfers the money out of the bad guys' clutches and take down the whole gang with help from his long dormant network of Tokyo operatives.

The fact that it is so much fun to write this review is a sure sign that the movie is fun to watch, at least once. The problem is whether or not the DVD is worth buying. The thin plot never explains how dead girlfriend got the 200 million bucks from scarface or exactly how girlfriend died or what connection a hidden notebook had to the case or even why the seeming larceny occurred many years ago, as 4/5 of the loot was interest, which could only have accrued over many years.

The point of the title is based on no more than a sight gag of Reno's character eating gobs of undiluted Wasabi with no sigh that he senses the very high heat in this Japanese horseradish. The point is made when faithful henchman eats a small portion himself and is rewarded with a scorched mouth which he demonstrates clearly with mumbles and large amounts of drinking water.

Very few comedies wear well after multiple viewings. Aside from Shakespeare's comedies and Woody Allen movies, there are very few I consider worth owning, and this is not one of them, although I sincerely enjoyed the experience of watching it the first time, as I am something of a Jean Reno fan.

Note that like most French movies, watching with the original French soundtrack and English subtitles is superior to watching the dubbed English, as you always loose something in the inflections of the dubbed speech. And, the two translations are different, and based on my rudimentary High School French, I think the subtitled translation is better.",1251331200,,4533,4.756997455470738

The tone of the script is very much along the lines of Besson's action-comedy, ""Taxi"", with elements of ""Leon - the Professional"" thrown in. This film does not take itself too seriously and there are some fun action set-pieces along the way (the fight scene at the golf range is particularly notable), although the film could have been improved by an increase in the number of these action scenes. Overall, I see this film as Besson-light (much like ""Bandidas"").

Although not being a fan of foreign films regularly, Jean Reno and Luc Besson are obviously a winning combination. I had seen ""The Professional"" years ago, but I hadn't paid much attention to the other movies these two collaborated on. My mistake which I'm correcting. Suffice it to say I will now buy anything the two of them have made. I must say though you probably won't go wrong with anything Reno is in. I caught ""The Crimson Rivers"" last night and it was an excellent murder mystery. If you enjoy action movies like ""The Transporter"" with some comedy thrown in I think you will like ""Wasabi"". I watched the dubbed version and although other voices sounded a bit odd, Reno's voice sounded like his own to me. Next time I'm going to watch it with the foreign voices and subtitles. Be sure to catch Reno in ""The Visitors"". I bought ""Wasabi"" right after I rented it. It was like a cross between a ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Pink Panther"" movie. Very entertaining as Reno as a cop finds out his love from twenty years ago has died and named him the will executor. When he gets into trouble at the airport he is saved by a friend that he worked with in coutner-intelligence twenty years ago. Then on arrival in Japan he finds out his love not only left him her millions but a daughter as well that is being followed by the Japanese mafia.

Hubert's daughter Yumi is played by Ryoko Hirosue in the 3rd of her 4 films.  ""Poppoya: Railroad Man"" & ""Himitsu aka Secret"" are other credits of hers I have yet to taste.  She does an excellent job dressing like a Japanese Cyndi Lauper, while just wanting to have fun.  The bright oranges of her costumes are wild & wonderful.  Hubert's sidekick in Japan is Momo played by Michel Muller from ""Like a Fish Out of Water"" & ""The Daltons.""  Muller does an excellent job of keeping the comedy light, being just dumb enough to make the jokes work and bright enough not to get shot.  The film works if you don't look at the plot too closely.

Jean Reno is his always watchable self and I have to admit he looks GREAT in this movie. And I have admit that the daughter wasn't as bratty as she could have been. And kudos to the fellow who played Momo, he was pretty funny. All in all, a harmless bit of fluff. Enjoy!",1128124800,6,848,4.401273885350318

It intends to be funny but falls way short, the characters are annoying -the ""spunky"" daughter he suddenly inherits  is a willful smart-ass teenager, and the inspector is not convincing as a dad trying to protect his newfound daughter nor as a tough-cracking investigating officer.

1820164,3,B00007L4OM,"Essentially it's a story about a man (Jean Reno) called Hubert. He has no life other than his cop life. He has a tendency to proceed about investigations in a rather violent manner (he actually punches anyone, good guy or bad guy, who gets in the way or interupts him). The chief puts him on leave for 2 months for his violent behavious. Then he gets a phone call from a lawyer telling him that his lover, Miko, has died. The whole movie is about the mystery Miko leaves after her death. Along the way, he manages to find out that he has actually fathered a Japanese daughter (with Miko) called Yumi.
This movie can be 'analysing material', but not as itself. This is because Jean Reno has this history of playing men who have fighting and shooting as their job description, e.g. The Cleaner in Luc Besson's Nikita; The Professional. So Jean Reno actually brings his screen experiences on board the show. Unless you happen to be watching him act for the first time, it is quite hard to detach yourself from his film pressence.
The French and Japanese mix is interesting enough. But Japanese culture is not really presented realistically here. Sure, the surface materialistic youth culture carries across, but no more than this. Yumi's plaintive cries for her papa are touching, but shallow. She also cries a whole lot.
The dialogue is witty. The camera angles are nice, especially when Yumi sticks her legs up in the lawyer's office. It's a great movie, not too intense, enjoyable, funny, action packed. Would I buy the DVD? Probably not. I do not think it bears rewatching.",1088726400,3,1574,4.6859205776173285
1820165,4,B00007L4OM,"This is a very fun action comedy that throws together a father and daughter that didn't know each other existed.  Style, culture clash, humor, and fast paced action are what make this work, as well as some fine performances.",1088467200,4,224,4.743589743589744
1820166,4,B00007L4OM,"I consider myself pretty knowledgeable about films, but in purchasing Wasabi (2001), I had no prior knowledge about the movie other than it was written by Luc Besson and starred Jean Reno, who were both involved in Nikita (1990) and The Professional (1994), two wonderful films worth any action movie fan's time.  Given the talent involved in Wasabi, I thought it would be a pretty worth looking into, and I wasn't disappointed.
Reno stars a Hubert, a retired secret government operative who is now a no nonsense French cop who seems to follow the guidelines within the Dirty Harry Law Enforcement Manual, that's to say his methods, while extreme, get results.  The films dives headfirst into the action as we see Hubert single-handedly bust up a transvestite bank robbery ring.  While Hubert is very good at what he does, his superior notes that that is all he does, as Hubert has no life.  That, along with pressures from a local politician with regards to Hubert's' old school tactics, forces Hubert's boss to put him on extended vacation, with a recommendation that he basically get a life.
Soon Hubert gets word that a Japanese woman he once loved but who left him almost 20 years ago to which he still carried a torch for, has recently passed, and she has named him in her will.  He travels from France to Japan to witness the reading of the will, and see his long, lost love, but gets more than he bargained for as he learns the woman had a daughter, Hubert's daughter.  Not only that, but the woman has also left a mystery behind not only in why she left him in the first place, but why now the Yakuza is after the daughter.  Hubert must learn his now deceased lover's involvement with the Yakuza, protect himself and his daughter, named Yumi, and deal with the fact that he's an instant father, and the complications of having to try and relate to a 19 year old girl.
Wasabi mixes a very genuine blend of action, comedy, and a pinch of drama pretty successfully.  The action is pretty steady throughout, and is more of the comic book variety, like what you might see in a Jackie Chan film.  The comedy comes mostly in the form of Hubert's contact in Japan, a fellow Frenchman named Momo, whom Hubert worked with many years ago when he was a government operative.  Momo reminded me of a chubbier version of Rob Schneider, except a bit funnier.  The drama, while present but not over done, comes in the form of Hubert and Yumi trying to come to terms with the fact that they are now all they have.  While the combination of these three elements doesn't allow for a whole lot of substance within the story, that mattered little as this was just a fun, exciting ride I enjoyed all the way to the end.  Certainly one who has seen the Besson/Reno film The Professional will notice similarities, but more or less these two films relate superficially.  What's really interesting is how much this French-made film looks like an American actioneer.
The quality of the wide screen picture here looks great, and the audio is really excellent.  Keep in mind the dialog is in French, with English subtitles available, but there is also a dubbed English track, for those of you who don't care to read while watching a film.  I, myself, preferred to allow the original voices to come out, while reading the translation below.  The dubbed voices sound a bit weird at times, especially since I am fairly familiar with how Jean Reno's voice sounds like, and the guy hired to dub him is way off.  As far as extras go, there are some theatrical trailers available, for this film, and Formula 51 (2001), Swept Away (2002), and Trapped (2002).  While Wasabi really isn't a cinematic feast, it's definitely a satisfying appetizer, and sometimes that's all you need.

1820167,4,B00007L4OM,"It's not the greatest, deepest movie ever filmed.  But it doesn't aim to be.

Great for casual rental or to have in your DVD library to entertain friends when they're looking for something to watch.

1820168,2,B00007L4OM,"Wasabi, one of the latest products of Luc Besson sector. However anti-American movie fans have raised their `Yankee Go Home' banners; to my mind this comedy - action film which is harmonized with French - Japon sensibilities, can be an alternative film to American movies.
Luc Besson - Jean Reno cooperation is going on. Leading character Hubert is a puncher policeman just like in American movies, ignoring legal details, fighting against the bad people. Again just like in American movies, Hubert has a chief who is complaining and shouting all the times; at the other hand he likes Hubert. Love book of Hubert is empty for 19 years, after a Japon woman has broken his heart and left him with memories, meal descriptions and a beautiful pen. Hubert has closed his love book and has focused on crime world. Then he learns that his Japan woman has died and has left him an inheritance: a daughter. Time for a Japan voyage.
Just focusing on the story, it is easy to think that this film doesn't have any difference from American ones. But this film isn't an American popcorn movie; it is a French / Japan popcorn movie.
There are enough big guns, rocket launchers, bombs; but the action scenes is not in American style, Hubert generally finishes his work quickly with one punch. In American movies the bullets let people fly backward for 2 meters; Hubert can fly people for 5 meters.
Sense of humor which is full of small coincidences and comic events is extremely French. Lets turn to the Japan side of the film: there are many Japan people.  The beautiful girl of the film is Hubert's Japan daughter Yumi. I find her very cute with her teenage gestures and phone talks beginning with `mochie, mochie'.
By this film, I've surprised that there are many Japan including policemen and mobsters speaking French very well.
If you want to watch a French (and a little Japan) comedy - action movie similar with American ones (but not in American style), I'll advice you this film. At worst you will lose time.",1075420800,2,2002,4.703703703703703
1820169,5,B00007L4OM,"This was a solid film. A lot of people didn't care for it because they believed it to be rather hokey, to me that's what made it great. Watch it in French with English subtitles or you lose the feel of the film. Michele Muller and Ryoko Hirosue boast great cameos, but Jean Reno showed why he is one of my favorites in Hollywood these days. His role as Hubert in a dilapidated combination of rogue cop and gentleman bring's the viewer back to why ""Leon"" was such a fine film, Reno's acting. This was great and one that you generally find by accident, a great accident.",1067644800,5,568,4.317757009345795
1820170,4,B00007L4OM,"I am a big fan of Jean Reno, so I guess that I am a bit biased. This is one fun movie, though even if you are not a fan of Reno. This is in part due to the writing credits of Luc Besson, a long-time collaborator of Reno's, famously teaming together for the brilliant Leon aka' The Professional, my all time favorite piece of cinema! While this movie doesn't have the depth and brilliant script of Leon, it is certainly a fine piece of work from both Besson and Reno. Adding to the wonderful spicy flavor of this dish, we have Ryoko Hirosue, who is an absolute gem as Hubert's surprise daughter, and Michael Muller, Hubert's longtime partner, who is hillarious when he takes a big scoop of wasabi and puts it in his mouth, the look on his face....priceless!! We should see more of him in domestic movies, he is quite a card! The cast plays off each other very well and the scene with Hubert's past love, lying in the coffin as Reno looks at her, is very touching and sweet. Bottom line, this is a sweet fun movie, plenty of action, humor and entertains divinely!! The movie also has a wonderful soundtrack, although it is not available here in the states, but definitely worth going to the trouble to get. I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a great fun movie and it will be definitely worth the time you spend to watch!!! Hai!",1060905600,9,1340,4.364
1820171,3,B00007L4OM,"Wasabi is a high-spirited French action comedy with a Japanese name.  This Luc Besson production stars Jean Reno in a wonderful performance as a tough-guy French cop who is as quick to use his tongue as his overeager fists.  One day, out of the blue, Detective Fiorentino discovers that he has a 19 year-old daughter by a Japanese woman who left him almost 20 years ago, breaking his heart in the process.  The girl, Yumi, turns out to be an orange-haired free spirit who hates cops and has been led to believe that her father raped her mother.  Much of the film is spent with Hubert and Yumi getting to know one another, as they uncover secrets about her mothers past that seem to have made the young woman the target of some rather unsavory characters.
The plot is the least of the matter in this film.  As directed by Gerard Krawczyk, Wasabi is really all about style.  Bessons screenplay is fitfully amusing, doling out cleverness and cutesyness in roughly equal measure.  Cinematographer Gerard Sterin brings out the colorful richness of the urban Japanese landscape and editor Yanne Herve doesnt linger longer on the jokes and sight gags than is absolutely necessary.  These elements help to compensate for the somewhat desperate air that afflicts the screenplay from time to time.
The prime asset of Wasabi is Jean Renos performance.  Reno perfectly mines the comic potential inherent in the material through the tone of weary cynicism and superiority to all around him that he conveys throughout.  As an actor who has played this type of rogue-cop character many times in his career, Reno obviously relishes this opportunity for a little good-natured self-ribbing.  And he does a splendid job.
Wasabi is little more than a piffle when all is said and done, but Reno makes it worth seeing.",1059436800,7,1796,4.836601307189542
