8392011,5,B003954H52,"~ This DVD presents one hour of a concert recorded in Paris in 1965. The band, consisting of Art Blakey (drums), Freddie Hubbard (trumpet), Jaki Byard (piano), Reggie Workman (bass), and Nathan Davis (tenor sax), is designated as the ""New Jazzmen"" rather than the ""Jazz Messengers"". The reason for this name change is because Art had disbanded his previous version of the Jazz Messengers and threw this group together strictly for the purposes of a European tour. The band in this video was dissolved immediately after the tour, and never recorded together. For that reason the video is a unique archival item.
~ When Art recorded or performed with established editions of the Jazz Messengers the musicians were told how long each solo could last; however, in the case of this temporary band no such limitations were imposed. There are two consequences that result from this difference: The first is that the soloists play as long as they have something new to say (thus, only four tunes in the span of one hour). The second consequence is that Blake does not provide his usual arc of dynamics behind the soloists; instead he simply provides the drive and the colour behind each soloist. The exception to this is that Art takes a hands-off role in support of Jaki Byard because he had no idea where Byard was going next in developing his solo.
~ Indeed, one of the things that makes this group unusual is the inclusion of Jaki Byard on piano. Byard was more of an avantgarde or outside pianist than the usual swing and blues-based pianists that Blakey hired for the Jazz Messengers. The unpredictability of Byard forced Art to assume a less commanding role during Byard's solos.
~ The real star of the show here is Freddie Hubbard, who composed ""The Hub"" and ""Crisis"", which take up two-thirds of the hour concert. His solos on these two tunes and on ""Blue Moon"" are reminders of just how innovative and great Hubbard was in the 1960's.
~ In addition to Hubbard, tenor man Nathan Davis offers some strong solo moments, especially on ""Crisis"". The rhythm section with Reggie Workman is rock solid with Byard being rather restrained compared to his well-known work as leader and with other more aggressive bands.
~ Sound quality is acceptable. Cinematography is good. The 19-page insert booklet is informative and adds to the value of the DVD.
~ Highly recommended as an exciting documentation of an Art Blakey band that you will not hear anywhere else. Especially recommended for Freddie Hubbard fans.",1356480000,2,2500,4.843457943925234
