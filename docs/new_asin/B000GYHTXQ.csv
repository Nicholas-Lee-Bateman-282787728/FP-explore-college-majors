I do wish that Amazon would note whether or not video products are subtitled or captioned - I am hearing impaired, so this is very Important to me. Happily, this is.",1471996800,,281,4.222222222222222
8135461,5,B000GYHTXQ,"These are region 2 encoded (which is clearly stated in the description) which requires a multi-region player. Image quality is considerably better than I expected (I own several VHS tapes of Up Pompeii for comparison). Obviously the quality cannot be better than the source recording! I was delighted with my purchase - the 3 DVD set contained several programs and interviews I had never seen before. I do wish that (somehow) the collection could've included the Up Pompeii feature film, however this is purely and observation and not a gripe.

This set is thoroughly recommended for anyone who is a fan of Frankie Howerd.",1454371200,,622,4.980769230769231
8135462,5,B000GYHTXQ,"I used to love watching Up Pompeii on PBS so when I found this DVD collection I couldn't resist.  It includes all episodes of the ""Up Pompeii!"" series, as well as the BBC special ""Further Up Pompeii!"", the series ""Then Churchill Said To Me"", and a ""Comedy Greats"" episode featuring Frankie Howerd.

""Up Pompeii!"" was filmed in front of a live audience which allowed Howerd to do what he did best: interact with the audience.  This is the fun and magic of the series.  Viewers should remember that this was a different era of comedy.  The writing and the humor are silly, bawdy, and perhaps politically incorrect (by today's standards) but seldom raunchy.  Vaudevillian one-liners and silly running gags abound throughout the series.

NOTE that these are region 2 DVDs and must be viewed on a Region 2 or multi-region player.  They will not work on a standard US (Region 1) player.

Sadly the picture and sound quality are not up to current standards but if you enjoy Frankie Howerd this is easily overlooked.  Most of the original video tapes of the series were wiped out by the BBC and nearly lost forever.  Fortunately some poorly converted recordings were found in the Canadian Broadcasting Corp archives in the late 70's in NTSC format and spun to DVD in the mid 2000's.  Thanks to this we can still enjoy the genius of Frankie Howerd!",1403913600,3,1339,4.6995708154506435
