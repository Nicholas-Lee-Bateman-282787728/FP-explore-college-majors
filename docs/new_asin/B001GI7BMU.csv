8305385,3,B001GI7BMU,"This DVD is just ok... My preschoolers have learned from it and repeated the words. However, it doesn't have the upbeat momentum to hold the attention of my five year-old and three-year-old twins. By upbeat momentum I mean that the graphics on the screen and background music are fairly bland and very slow paced. For the learning style and age of my kids this DVD works best played in the car DVD player when the kids are able to give it their full attention without any distractions. But even then they quickly get bored with it and ask for something else to watch. There is no way I could sit my 5-year-old down on the couch and expect this DVD to hold his attention.
The plus side to the bland style of this DVD is that most of what is shown on the screen is only the sight word and the constant repeating of the word. In comparison to the other sight word DVD we own (Meet the Sight Words 1) - the opposite style is used. Upbeat music and fun animation. That DVD does hold the attention of all three of my boys and they actually like watching it. The drawback to the fun animation with ""Meet the Sight Words 1"" is that sometimes my 5-year-old confuses the graphics with the sight word being shown. For example if there is a boat in the background graphics while the sight word ""They"" is being shown my son thinks boat is spelled ""They""... Sorry to compare the two DVDs in a review for just this one. Buts it's the best way I can describe how this DVD could be better.
It basically comes down to the learning style of your child.  If your child can focus on a mellow bare bones format, then this DVD would be great for you. But my boys require a fast paced, fun, learning style that can hold their attention and this DVD doesn't do that.",1242950400,6,1741,4.275757575757575
