8152047,4,B000JLTSB2,"SOV fans will enjoy this, gorehounds won't.  This is a horror sitcom without gore.  If you expect carnage and meat spatter, you'll be very let down.  Understandable.  Coming at this as a shot-on-video fan, you'll love this fun movie.  If you get in the mindset this is a ""horror"" sitcom done over-the-top, you can appreciate it.  Very niche.  If you've seen movies like Cannibal Campout, Black Devil Doll From Hell, and The Basement boxed set, you're a good candidate for liking this movie.  Everybody else might want to rent this flick.",1416787200,2,537,4.824175824175824
8152048,3,B000JLTSB2,"Jon McBride wrote and directed this shot on video comedy horror 80s flick, about three siblings who are forced to have their mean awful Aunt Tess take care of them for the whole weekend, but when the younger brother accidentally stabs the heartless bad Aunt, they disposed her corpse by chopping it up and then putting it in the Woodchipper! It's a decent home video like film, this one to me lives up to it's potential, give it a Try!",1410652800,,435,4.45
8152049,4,B000JLTSB2,"This movie is not for everyone, but for those who like supercheesy no budget 80's retro, or anyone who want's to get into film making, this is a course study and goldmine. The movie was shot on a VHS camcorder in the Connecticut home and backyard of the writer/director and star of the film Jon McBride at a total cost of $400, and managed to get worldwide distribution, despite all this, or maybe because of it, I found this film to be really charming, and thoroughly entertaining. Definitely more of a comedy than gorefest (there is scarcely any blood in the film) it has a good pace, several chuckles, horrendous acting, and a fun 80's vibe, I also liked the cheesy casio score to the film. The DVD is packed with extras including commentary track with Jon McBride, interviews with the cast and crew, and previews for other Camp Motion Pictures.",1301443200,4,848,4.622516556291391
8152050,5,B000JLTSB2,"Camp Motion Pictures has done us all a favor by unearthing this strange yet entertaining gem from the awesome 80s.  Jon McBride directed and starred in this one, which plays out like a really bizarre sitcom.  Even though it's called Woodchipper Massacre, there are not any splatter or bloody scenes.  It is full of offbeat humor though and you just GOTTA love that consumer grade vhs camcorder look!  At times you almost feel like you're watching someone's home movies.  The special features are also great, and they include interviews with the cast and McBride.  Pick this up if you are a fan of SOV films or, dare I say it, bad 80s fashion.",1186704000,5,642,4.6371681415929205
