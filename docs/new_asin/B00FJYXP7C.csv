8616197,4,B00FJYXP7C,"Dack Rambo fan. Was not sure I would like it from the title as I'm not a horror film fan. It's more suspense than horror. It does touch on some interesting issues related to dealing with sexual assault. The story line is not one I would call my favorite, but it was interesting and suspenseful.",1486944000,,294,4.363636363636363
8616198,5,B00FJYXP7C,"Nightmare Honeymoon starreed Dack Rambo and was released in 1974. It is a gritty tough B-Film, of one man's revenge when he is attacked, and his wife raped after they witness a murder on their honeymoon. Not for the squeamish. Dack rambo fans will like this the most.",1435622400,,267,4.583333333333333
