7898740,4,6305895805,"In this workout, instructor Suzanne Deason leads you through a nice, moderately challenging routine to work your lower body.  She begins with a 5-minute instructional and warm-up section and then moves on to the 27-minute workout.  The workout starts sitting on the ball for balance challenge work such as knee lifts and leg extensions, which Deason makes progressively more difficult.  She also does some dips with the ball behind your back to work your butt, but I didn't feel much wiht this move.  Next comes some work lying face down over the ball, including leg lifts and extensions.  At first, this felt easy to me, but Deason then goes on to more challenging moves from an elbow plank position, and I could really feel my butt working.  Lying sideways over the ball for Pilates-like moves comes next; for some reason, this position did not feel comfortable to me.  Deason finishes with some inner thigh work by holding the ball between your thighs in a seated position.  The final 5 minutes of the workout consist of stretching, including forward bends over the ball, bridge pose with your feet on the ball, and hamstring/leg stretches.  Plus, Deason includes many stretches throughout the routine, making this a nice workout if you want to gently challenge your muscles while providing plenty of opportunity to make them more flexible as well.",1122940800,,1351,4.942477876106195

7898742,3,6305895805,"If you are new to using your ball for basic toning then this video will be helpful.  You should be aware that living arts has another video out that combines lower, abs and upper body workouts all in one tape.  I actually prefer that one even though it does not include everything that you find on the individual tapes.
I use this tape to see how far I am progressing and about once every two weeks I whip it out on one of the days I do toning exercises.  It's great for helping to tone and to give you balance.  Balance equals control and if you can control your body through various exercises your overall performance in any exercise is improved along with your posture and general health.  That being said if you want a vigorous ball workout you had better skip this one.",1003968000,12,774,4.347222222222222
7898743,1,6305895805,"I eagerly awaiting the arrival of this tape as change of pace from my ususal workouts of strength training, aerobics, and yoga. I was very disappointed as I feel that it provides no challenge whatsoever.  If you have never done pilates or yoga and need to work on beginning to balance your core than you may like this tape but if you work out regularly in the above practices, thus having some core strength already, than you will probably be left as unchallenged and bored as I was.  If anyone knows of a challenging tape that I could get to utilize this new piece of exercise equipment please let me know, otherwise it will become yet another toy for my 2 kids.",997142400,9,663,4.426229508196721
