8692240,5,B00QO5CXEG,"This documentary must be seen by fans of early movie comedians like Harold Lloyd, Laurel & Hardy and Our Gang. It provides background information about the producer of what brought genreations to laugher: Hal Roach and his studios, better known as ""The Lot of Fun"". The humor still catches and the documentary provides rare footage and unpublished pictures and photographs. All commented by companions, film historians and comedy experts.

This award winning documentary (New York Festivals Gold Award Winner Biography/Profiles) is great fun to watch!",1448496000,,551,5.482352941176471
8692241,2,B00QO5CXEG,most of it is uninteresting and unfunny. So much more could have been shown about the Roach backlot.  For me the highlight was a brief  filmclip of a fake front faade of a building on the Roach backlot street set being bulldozed.  And it was very smeary.  All in all it was disappointing.,1437004800,,288,4.377358490566038
8692242,5,B00QO5CXEG,"This is really a great documentary - the one I missed all the years! It's about all those comedy heroes of my childhood like Laurel & Hardy, Our Gang or Harold Lloyd and the brain behind them: comedy producer Hal Roach.

The film is made in a very modern way with lots of never seen before photographs which are animated in 3 D, rare or unpublished film clips and interviews with experts.

I learned a lot about those comedy stars and their private lives and you'll get a great look behind the scenes.

There's also a Bonus Disc with a lot of rare stuff as well. All in all really a great buy!",1429920000,2,593,4.230088495575221
