8602198,5,B00E6RM2JU,"17th Century Joined Chest with Peter Follansbee

I have several tools from LN and have come to expect that anything they do will be outstanding.  This DVD is outstanding for production, instruction and presentation.

Follansbee walks you through material selection, tool selection, tool use techniques, SAFETY!, construction, assembly and carving.  Follansbee is simply the master for this type of 17th Century joinery and an outstanding instructor.  An added bonus is he has an easy, cheerful and positive style that is enjoyable to watch and listen to.

If you want a preview sample of some of Peter Follansbee's other work, go to PBS and look for his appearances on Roy Underhills The Woodwright programs.  I think there are a couple of hours worth of video there.  If you log into PBS, they let you watch the videos in HD.  If you watch RoughCut with Tommy McDonald, he also built a similar style of 17th century chest and did a FWW article on its construction.

The instruction by Peter Follansbee in this video is excellent.  He has years of experience working with the public and doing presentations.  It shows in how he organizes and communicates the concepts.  He knows how to frame the instruction at a good level for anyone to understand.  After watching the 17th Century Joined Chest video, I felt I could follow his process and build a great piece.  More importantly, the instruction is clear enough to give you a structure to work from and allow a builder to adapt the construction methods to your woodworking tools or techniques.

LN and Peter Follansbee have worked on some other videos and after seeing this one, I cant wait to get those as well.",1429142400,2,1663,4.823321554770318
