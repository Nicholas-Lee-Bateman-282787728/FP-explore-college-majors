3863445,5,B0027CHPDO,"Lohan really pulls it off well in this fun, non-traditional romantic comedy. It's a smart, funny film that kept me completely and constantly entertained as it follows the story of an office secretary faking pregnancy in a desperate attempt to keep her awful but financially-necessary job.

It's a great story and keeps you rapt with unpredictable chemistry between Lohan and male lead Luke Kirby while her lie spirals out of control at home and at work as she is unable to come clean and finds it necessary to expand her fake pregnancy bump. The movie is full of great supporting roles with the likes of Cheryl Hines, Chris Parnell, and a lot of familiar faces. Really enjoyed the soundtrack and overall it was a very pleasant deviation from your traditional romantic comedy. For anyone who's ever worked a crappy job you just couldn't afford to ditch like myself, it's really relatable in a fun way and keeps you laughing as it goes. Would be a great watch for the whole family.

Being a fan of Lindsay from The Parent Trap to Mean Girls, I was pleasantly surprised to find her just as on-point as ever, despite all the negative hype of her personal life lately. She certainly seems to find herself at home playing an adult role but keeping the lovable, fun quirkiness that we all fell in love with in the first place.",1256428800,3,1319,4.632478632478633
3863446,4,B0027CHPDO,"This film wasn't bad for a Lindsay Lohan movie. I was expecting to hate it, but I didn't - I even laughed a few times. Even though the plot is predictable, it has a few funny twists and turns. It doesn't just run on pregnancy jokes.

The acting is overall pretty decent. Lohan actually comes off well, not unbelievable good nor really annoying, but rather as a frustrated person stuck in a worthless job. I wasn't familiar with the other actors but they all came across as pretty believable and not too over the top (one of the things that can kill a movie like this is overly dramatic acting - see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Management/dp/B002C39T3M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Management</a>).

The movie does suffer from what I call the ""1.5 hour problem"" - it tries to cram so many relationships and a lot of plot twists within 90 minutes. Unfortunately, that seems to be the typical trend in Hollywood nowadays. Nonetheless, parts of the film, such as Lohan's relationship with Nick, seem a bit forced.

For some reason (possibly Lohan's trouble with the press), this movie slipped under the radar of most movie-goers, but it doesn't deserve to stay there. Certainly one of the better romantic comedies around.",1255305600,3,1262,5.206896551724138
3863447,4,B0027CHPDO,"I thought this had a really good and funny plot. Lindsay Lohan did an awesome job. Lohan stars as a secretary named Thea Clayhill who is about to be fired by her very stubborn boss. She is soon forced to lie and tell him she is pregnant. People start being nicer to her, and she is given a promotion. Will Thea ever reveal to her friends that she isn't 'with child'? I highly recommend LABOR PAINS!!!",1254614400,3,400,4.276315789473684
3863448,5,B0027CHPDO,"Personal life and mistakes aside...Lindsay Lohan is a true shining star and gem in this brilliant film. I have been Team Lindsay for as long as I can remember and this movie just all the more confirms my choice. This is a REALLY smart and hilarious film, I think it would have done wonders had it been given an actual theatrical run. However I love this film never-the-less. A great watch primarily for women of all ages, but it will also serve as a perfect ""date night"" movie. No more ""Pains"" for Lindsay Lohan...she is back in business!",1250208000,3,538,4.5
3863449,5,B0027CHPDO,"After the poor reviews, I waited for DVD, expecting very little. But Lilo had so impressed me in her sheer ability to carry a bad movie by sheer talent; (as in that clunker ""I Know Who Killed Me."") Here again  Lohan doesn't dissappoint, still managing to hold you captive with a screen presence that just doesn't quit, even when the writing or directing is not that great.
The movie was funny and just slapstick enough to strain - but not break - credibility (once you accept the whole premise). I liked it for fun and enjoyment; I might even buy it. It also serves to remind us that Lindsay Lohan is only one good role away from an Oscar-winning performance. Hines and Mendler are excellent as well.

I am surprised by the complete trouncing by the critics. I think it is possible that critics -and a great deal of the public - get 'mud-colored glasses' on when they smell blood in the water - as with Lohan, Spears, and anyone else who appears vulnerable. They may love-to-hate, but I do know I very much enjoyed watching Lindsay Lohan act in this movie.",1249430400,2,1056,4.494791666666667
3863450,3,B0027CHPDO,"I don't usually review movies but I wanted to pop in to offer some support for Lindsay Lohan. I just saw the movie last night and she was pretty good in it! I was really expecting to hate the movie and laugh at her for being such a failure but no, not only was her acting good, she looked good too! She does play a 25 year old and she looks the part, even though she's younger in real life but it's good to see that it really seems like she gave up on the drinking and partying when she was filming.
Cheryl Hines was a blast too, I love her from Curb Your Enthusiasm. And the lady that plays Hilda from Ugly Betty has a part in the movie also! She was super funny and stole every scene she was in :D
This movie is a HUUUUGE improvement from the disaster called 'I know who killed me'.

Keep it up Lindsay! 3 1/2 stars.",1249430400,4,818,3.9575757575757575
3863451,3,B0027CHPDO,"Shockingly, this film is a lot better than its premise would warrant. It's funny and silly and entertaining. Lindsey Lohan is back to top form in a role that is borne out of circumstance - Lohan plays a young woman forced to take care of her sister because their parents die in a car crash. As such, she is unable to finish college and becomes a secretary who is about to get fired. So she does the only thing she can - she pretends she is pregnant to avoid getting laidoff. When she pretends for too long, all hilarity ensues. Not as fun as ""Baby Mama,"" this film adds a variation to the romantic comedy genre.",1248220800,3,611,4.275862068965517
3863452,4,B0027CHPDO,"Lindsey L is not my favorite actress, but she really was quite hilarious in this well written and stylish film.  I really enjoyed the story and really laughed at a number of scenes, especially the birthing class scene.  The supporting cast is suburb and Cheryl Hines is particularly hilarious.  Chris Parnell is very strong and the setting is true LA at its best.  I particularly loved the sound track and story line.  I am now a fan of Lindsey's and highly recommend this fun film for any group of expecting women looking for a laugh.",1244678400,14,535,4.589473684210526
3863453,5,B0027CHPDO,"Whatever her press, Lindsey Lohan delivers a great performance in The Parent Trap, Freaky Friday, Mean Girls, and now Labor Pains.  This is a REALLY smart and funny film--well worth seeing and far better than the usual comedic maternity genre.  Rest of cast is excellent, as well.  Haven't heard of Lara Shapiro before, but i want to see anything else she's written or directed.  Gold!",1244419200,18,385,4.876923076923077
3863454,5,B0027CHPDO,"Labor Pains is a fun, entertaining comedy with a bit of drama thrown in for good measure. Lindsay Lohan stars as Thea, a beleaguered secretary at a military publishing house. To be honest, I wasn't expecting to enjoy this film as much as I did, considering Lindsay Lohan has had such negative press lately. But the story is well told, Lohan is very likable, and her comedic abilities are put to good use. Other cast members round out the film well: Cheryl Hines from Curbed Your Enthusiasm, plays Thea's best friend at work; Chris Parnell Dr Spaceman from 30 Rock, plays Thea's mean boss, Kevin Covais from American Idol fame is an office intern, Jeneane Garofalo is a talk show host, and Creed Bratton from The Office plays an author at the military publishing house where Thea works. The film seems to be a bit of a hybrid--a combination of a bigger budget studio-style romantic comedy, and a lower budget indie-style, quirky comedy, where things unfold on a smaller scale. This is an appealing combo, as the film had charm and heart, while the story kept me amused and entertained.",1244246400,9,1084,4.7105263157894735

3863560,4,B0027CHPDO,"Really a fun and funny movie.  The casting was near perfect.  Chris Parnell doing what he does best - going over the top in an almost believable way.  Cheryl Hines is fun and NOT over the top as opposed to her silly role now on ""Suburgatory.""  Even Creed from The Office is here, and he does a brief but hilarious bit as an an eccentric, aging author.  But the real surprise is Lindsay Lohan.  The woman can act, but it hasn't been obvious in years.  Notwithstanding her awful perception in the public eye and her stupid personal behavior, ""Labor Pains"" shows that, in the hands of a talented director, Lohan is a really good actress who is capable of much more than generating tabloid headlines.  A good fun family movie if you have kids in the middle-teens.",1367539200,,759,4.489051094890511
3863561,3,B0027CHPDO,A typical ABC Family movie. You can pretty much guess the outcome of this movie and I had no desire to watch it again. It's one of those see it just to see it movie.

3863578,4,B0027CHPDO,I was given this as a gift and I had low expectations of this movie because of the drama surrounding LL's private (not so private life).  Well this movie is much better than I thought it would be.  The plotline is decent and I found myself routing for her character.  It is a light comedy that works and is an easy watch and the movie movies along at quite a decent pace.  To some it up do yourself a favour and give this movie a chance you will not regret it.,1294790400,2,460,4.021978021978022
3863579,5,B0027CHPDO,"Lindsay Lohan as Thea is at the top of her game in this feel good movie. Thea fakes a pregnancy in order to keep her job, but then her maternal instinct kicks-in!  She starts hoarding baby paraphernalia and ultimately requires a full-blown ""intervention"" before she can kick her ""pregnancy addiction"" :)

Be sure to watch the entire movie because the last five minutes contains a surprise ending - a year or two in the future.

The Behind-the-Scenes is also interesting - it hints the movie was injected with a parody between Thea's pregnancy addiction versus LL's current challenges as a 20-something party girl:)

In one scene Thea is asked to go out for a drink with a co-worker after work. It's classic to see LL [I mean Thea] look up and say ""Drink? I don't drink! I'm pregnant!!""",1276300800,3,785,4.666666666666667

3863581,3,B0027CHPDO,"The problem here is that if you go in thinking this movie is going to be slapstick comedy, it's not. The comedy is very low key. Somebody mentioned the humor was like Working Girl which I agree. There are no belly laughs here. If you watch the movie with that mind set, it's an o.k. movie, but it seems more serious than funny.

3863582,3,B0027CHPDO,"A young woman, with a self-centered boyfriend, is stuck in a secretarial job, but when her boss is out of town, she assumes greater responsibilities, falls for an executive, and succeeds, brilliantly...only to be 'caught' when her boss returns, losing everything, until her contributions are fully recognized and appreciated. While this neatly sums up Lindsay Lohan's 2009 ""Labor Pains"", it is actually a brief synopsis of Melanie Griffith's 1988 hit, ""Working Girl"". While the gimmick of a faked pregnancy adds a degree of topical relevance to the mix (as well as a stream of gags about the embarrassing side effects of carrying a child), ""Labor Pains"" never succeeds in being more than a pale copy of the earlier film.

The problem with the film isn't Lohan, who gives a very credible performance as a likable, self-sacrificing workaholic struggling to juggle an underappreciated job, supporting a younger sister, and a relationship, while keeping her sanity; the problem is a shallow, superficial script by Stacey Kramer and Lara Shapiro, and Shapiro's heavy-handed direction, lacking the lightness and polish that Mike Nichols gave the earlier film. The pregnancy 'con', itself, is poorly conceived (can you think of any business with more than a dozen employees without some form of medical plan, or accepting the claim on face value, alone?), and the lack of any symptoms or signs would have aroused somebody's suspicions (besides the geeky kid trying to pass Lohan on the career ladder). Then there are the shaky characterizations, from the intellectually-challenged, chauvinist, dog-fixated boss (who inexplicably becomes a caring soul in the final scene), to the equally-challenged first boyfriend (why would Lohan even date such an idiot?), to the rude, unlikable younger sister. Lohan's new love interest totters from wimpy to sincere and back, and even her best friend (Cheryl Hines), after a nice character build-up in the first half of the film, is reduced to nearly a background player by film's end. Other than Bonnie Somerville's terrific performance, as a pregnant author who introduces Lohan to the world of 'living for two', the supporting cast are all nearly caricatures.

That the film 'works', at all, is due to Lindsay Lohan, and if you are buying this to see her, you'll enjoy this film...if you aren't, I suggest purchasing ""Working Girl"", instead!",1259539200,2,2374,5.228346456692913
