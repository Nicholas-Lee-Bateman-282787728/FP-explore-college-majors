8589859,5,0970279612,"i have always heard awesome fighters coming from pancrase, like ken shamrock, semmy schilt, and a bunch of japanese dudes but when i finally watched this it is great. not alot of hard and greusome knockouts but a slew of good submissions. I HIGHLY recommend this to fans of royce gracieish and shamrock fighting styles. this is a very good video for first timer NHB and vets to watch!!!!",989884800,3,387,4.6231884057971016
