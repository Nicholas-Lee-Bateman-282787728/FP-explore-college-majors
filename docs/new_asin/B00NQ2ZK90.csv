8679753,5,B00NQ2ZK90,"I am a huge fan of Fred Hersch's, have been for years, but this dvd is something absolutely unexpected, uncategorizable and breathtaking. Hersch's last several  albums have been wonderful (""Whirl"" and the current ""Floating"" stand  out as my favorites), but still, nothing prepared me for this. My Coma Dreams is a beautiful, moving production. So incredibly simple and truthful. I assumed it was just an obscure little gem, and then I saw a rave review for it in both DOWNBEAT and the BOSTON GLOBE, which subsequently picked it for its top jazz releases of the year. Both reviews convey far better than I can the specialness of this dvd:
From the BOSTON GLOBE's BEST OF 2014: ""The surprise here is that this jazz theater piece really is theater  moving, provocative theater  not just a song cycle with visuals... in a scenario written by composer/librettist Herschel Garfein, with Herschs 11-piece ensemble and a brilliant performance by singing actor Michael Winther.""
And then, from Frank Alkyer writing in DOWNBEAT: ""Fred Herschs brilliant multimedia piece ""My Coma Dreams""...conceived, written and directed by Herschel Garfein... incorporates music, spoken word and computer graphics into a fantastically interesting 90-minute work.... It has beautiful musical moments and narrative passages that will make you laugh, think and maybe even cry a little... The narrative here is smart, honest and true. And the music is superb.""
Now I am pounding the table for this exceptional dvd --which is beautifully lighted and shot , by the way. I am giving it to friends for the holidays, and if they look puzzled that they're getting a movie about being in a coma, I will say: just watch it. Just watch it.",1418515200,2,1700,5.060714285714286
