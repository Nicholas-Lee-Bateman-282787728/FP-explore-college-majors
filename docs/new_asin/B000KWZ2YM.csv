The entire Hare + Guu series [box set and two specials DVDs] is a real gem for anime fans enjoying laughs with a great storyline. I am very happy I got the entire series and specials [background information in story form].
The twists of story are masterful. It is humor within a normal/bizarre
world, but very funny.",1229558400,,460,6.092307692307692
