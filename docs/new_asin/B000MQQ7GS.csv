8170989,3,B000MQQ7GS,"This is a review of the double feature VHS videotape released by Nostalgia Entertainment titled THE FALCON IN HOLLYWOOD (1944) and THE SAINT'S DOUBLE TROUBLE (1940).

THE FALCON IN HOLLYWOOD (1944) directed by Gordon Douglas.  The famed private slueth known as The Falcon, aka Tom Lawrence played by Tom Conway, is vactioning in Hollywood when he finds himself involved in the middle of the murder of a movie actor.  Although the case has no shortage of suspects including a costume designer, a French starlet, a director, a producer and even a New York gangster, The Falcon with the help of a wisecracking but cute cabbie makes this case his own.

THE SAINT'S DOUBLE TROUBLE (1940)  directed by Jack Hively.  When The Saint is suspected of crimes such as smuggling diamonds into the USa from Egypt, Simon Templar, The Saint played by George Sanders gets on the case and comes face to face with his exact double, the crook played by George Sanders look-alike, George Sanders.  In many ways these series mysteries are fun and full of ""B"" movie conventions but somehow the story for THE SAINT'S DOUBLE TROUBLE just isn't very convincing or even interesting  and I have to admit that my attention lagged after a while. Unfortunately, Bela Lugosi is completely wasted in this chapter of  The Saint series.

I give this videotape a Three Star rating.",1284508800,,1345,4.859649122807017
