7113009,5,B00VWGIJRW,"Joanne Kelly never fails to deliver. I was once told that the key to any movie was to get people to care about the characters. Love, hate, empathize - just care. Well Joanne does that in this film, she gets you to feel for the plight of this good woman. Its a sad story that really tugs at your heart. You feel for the woman struggling to save everything, her family, the farm and a way of life. It does not take long to become emotionally invested in this story. A story you know in the back of your mind is based on what farmers struggle with just to survive.

The role of a woman fighting the odds was reminiscent of the first thing I ever saw Joanne Kelly in, The Bay of Love and Sorrows.",1438041600,2,692,4.088235294117647
7113010,5,B00VWGIJRW,"What would you do and how far would you go to protect your family, your land and your home? Hopefully, you will never be confronted with the decisions the characters in ""Runoff"" must face!

An incredible story of determination and persistence, thwarted by typical big business intervention with no respect for most of humanity.

The ending may just leave you in tears, as you decide what you might do if faced with desperation!",1435622400,9,427,4.835616438356165
7113011,5,B00VWGIJRW,"I had missed the premiere of Runoff at the LA Film Festival, and so was very happy to catch it a few months later at the Woodstock Film Festival. I knew the film was about a woman running her family farm and dealing with big-food corporations. Without spoiling anything, I'll simply say, it's about a whole lot more.

Kimberly Levin weaves an intricate tale about family traditions, faith in the community, and the survival of local agriculture amongst corporate greed... with a dynamic twist at the end. The story is told to us through the nuanced and powerful performance of Joanne Kelly, a woman fighting for her family's survival and faced with more than one dubious solution. Levin makes her heroine strong, thoughtful, and refreshingly realistic.

Beautiful shots of rural Kentucky fill the frame, reminding us that the land- and specifically our use of it- is at stake. But, kudos to Levin for making a film that is much more than a morality tale. Runoff succeeds in layering suspense with each choice the characters make, building to a climax that left me shaken, and resonated for days. I love nothing more than thinking about a film long after I've left the theater-- as you will do-- when you see Runoff!",1434412800,13,1215,4.780952380952381

My car insurance increased to pay for all the fraudulent claims in history and the value of my house decreased by $23,000.00 in one year...it was a steady decline in value.

7113043,1,B00VWGIJRW,"This film is sorely lacking in intelligent dialogue.  It would be okay for those who know nothing about farming, but a poor depiction of a farm family.  The plot was supposed to make one guess what was happening.  I had to keep fast forwarding trying to get to the meat of the story.  I think too much of the film was spent on facial expressions of the actress.  The film jumps around in a mishmash of scenes and nuances.  Much time spent on a stupid carnival, as if that is all that goes on in ag land.  Somebody was trying to make a statement about the horrors of chemicals used in agriculture and did a poor job of it. It could have been educational for those who have no idea what goes on in the land of chemical farming.  This really missed the point.  Of course, they probably did not want to step too heavily on the toes of the big chemical producers.",1448150400,,858,4.214723926380368

7113047,5,B00VWGIJRW,"Realistic and incredibly sad, like something Sam Shepard would write. In this movie, a family works very hard to maintain independence, keep up with the demands of making a mortgage, farming, keeping bees, selling the various farm chemicals that livestock producers need and watching as things go straight to hell. Of course big corporations see a market and move in. Of course long time customers start doing business with the corporations because the price is a few cents cheaper.

7113067,5,B00VWGIJRW,"Runoff is a compelling movie that gives one time to think during and between scenes, unlike the typical ones where a change ever few seconds and jumping to something new is demanded. And it's a movie that we need that time, just as the characters in the movie need that time, to sort out and give meaning to their complicated story. Everything is not just black and white or even gray here. It's a myriad of colors challenging what is and what we think should be. Joanne Kelly deserves an Academy Award nomination for her beautiful delivered role. In fact, the acting of everyone is superb. Kimberly Levine direction and care for what's happening in this movie is phenomenal. To all this add the beauty of the Kentucky autumn  scenery and the close ups of bugs and crawly things that play as much a role as the actors, and you have something special going on. It's not your traditional movie. It's much closer to what we think of as an ""art"" movie. It's one, however, that will not leave you the same. I've seen it four times on the big screen and I just ordered the DVD. Take a look. Let yourself be part of the movie; let the movie be a part of you. You'll see why I'm looking forward to watch it again. Congratulations to Kimberly Levine and Kurt Pizer and all others involved in the making. All of you have pulled off a stunning first movie by any standards. I am a movie goer. I rate this one as one the the best I have ever seen. It's a classic and time will judge it so.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Runoff/dp/B00VWGIJRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Runoff</a>",1443744000,2,1605,4.691489361702128

7113069,5,B00VWGIJRW,"I think I was expecting something preachy, something heavy handed. But instead Kimberly Levin succeeded in doing something that's very difficult to pull off: she wrote and directed an incredibly engaging story that MIGHT have an agenda, but instead entices the viewer to ask questions not only of the motivations of the characters, but of themselves. There wasn't a moment in which I felt bullied into a point of view. It's provocative in the best way possible. I loved this movie so much I watched it twice. The cinematography was beautiful and the acting heart felt and honest. The mother's choices were complex, and portrayed very convincingly by Joanne Kelly. I wanted to hug the children, who also did a great acting job. It left me wanting to know more about them and watch to see what kind of people they would grow into. Well done!",1443744000,3,839,4.7534246575342465
7113070,5,B00VWGIJRW,"Runoff"" illuminates how Big Ag is literally shifting the landscape. Starting with the soil, corporate monoliths are corrupting our American roots and bankrupting the small, family farmers who have fed our nation. If you're looking for light fare, come back and watch Runoff"" when you're in the mood to dig into whats deeply wrong with our system and the rot at its core...this movie is more heart of darkness. The acting is A+ across the board from lead Joanne Kelly, who I had never seen before to character actor Tom Bower whos been in everything from Crazy Heart to Die Hard 2. I love docs like Food Inc and movies like Erin Brockovich but if you're looking for something more challenging, youll probably get a lot out of Runoff.""",1443657600,2,733,4.689922480620155
7113071,1,B00VWGIJRW,"Read all the reviews and not a single one says what the drums of toxic chemical were that our central character, Betty, pours into a local creek.
That is because, despite the importance of understanding the dialogue:
a. No subtitles.
b. Poor audio level control - all over the place.
c. Poor enunciation.
Why it was poured into a creek that is used by the community instead of just poured into a remote dry feet feet of land makes no sense. Why there would be drums of toxic whatever in the first place from a neighbors milking farm is a bit far fetched. What milk farm chemical could be so toxic that even diluted in a creek causes burns on a body isn't clear either.
The majority of the film is prolonged close ups of bees, pigs, cows, trees (and not even interesting trees), turkeys, people driving in a pickup (viewed always from the passenger seat) all tediously slow and made more so with prolonged loud droning cello background sounds.
Supposedly the point of the story is that some people that need money will be dishonest. Of all the ways Betty could have addressed her problem this shortcut dumping just didn't seem believable.",1442707200,11,1137,4.605911330049261

Hence the title ""Runoff""  Watching this movie is not nearly as exciting or mind provoking to us that struggle with the daily hardships of farm living and often droughts and unacceptable soil and climate infringements.  I suppose the movie might seem utterly immense at the choices that the main character makes to try to save her farm and their house from foreclosure or the human condition of Kentuckians who rely on the resources of the land for any bounty that we might be able to put on the table for nutrition.

Not only did this make me look deeply at my own family and situations, but it reminded me to check myself when judging others.  I watch a few movies per day (disabled) and probably only consider giving five stars about 2 out of 10 times, however, everyone interprets ratings differently.

To be clear (and hopefully more helpful):  In comparison to other movies in this genre, with a complimentary style, Runoff is a 5 star success.
The film runs in a similar fashion to The Pursuit of Happyness or Bluebird as it is slow rolling and uncomfortably engaging, but it gripped me more in the ways of The Hunt.",1440892800,9,837,4.450980392156863
