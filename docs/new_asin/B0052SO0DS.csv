4530611,3,B0052SO0DS,"Typical B-Movie from the 1950's and early American-International. Familiar faces include John Bromfiled, Joi Lansing and Dabbs Greer. Interesting old cars including a 1956 Chrysler New Yorker convertible.",1366588800,2,204,6.321428571428571
4530612,4,B0052SO0DS,"HOT CARS (UA,1956) is a terrific little B-movie that packs a suspenseful wallop in a scant 60 minute running time. I watched it on Netfilx on a whim and liked it well enough to pick it up off Amazon.

Directed by Donald McDougall, HOT CARS stars John Bromfield as an honest used car salesman who loses his job and gets roped into selling stolen cars in order to raise enough money for his baby son's operation. When a cop (Dabbs Greer) who is investigating the hot car racket is murdered, Bromfield is framed for the crime by his boss (Ralph Clanton). The rest of the supporting cast features some familiar '50's faces - and figures. Second billed pin-up queen Joi Lansing is quite good as a sexy blonde who finds honest suckers to work for Clanton's crooked dealership. Carol Shannon plays Bromfield's loyal wife and Mark Dana is greasy as Clanton's strong arm man. Veteran screen heavy Robert Osterloh is Bromfield's pushy employer who gives him the axe. Dabbs Greer was in a lot of '50's T.V. shows, such as THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN, and turns in a good performance as the persistent cop.

The film projects an authentic feel due to its mostly on location shoot at Big John's and Johnny O'Toole's used car lots and surrounding area in Culver City. The exciting climax with Bromfield and Dana slugging it out aboard a speeding roller coaster without the aid of process photography must've been inspired by the opening sequence from THIS IS CINERAMA (1952).

This DVD-R offers a high polished print of HOT CARS in its original 1:33:1 aspect ratio with crisp audio. The vintage cars are great to look at, and the film gives us an intriguing glimpse into the machinery behind the used car business. Anyone who is into classic '50's cars will enjoy this noirish, surprisingly good programmer.

Recommended.",1364947200,6,1806,4.76038338658147
4530613,5,B0052SO0DS,"I bought this little gem on the merits of it having lovely Joi Lansing in a small yet essential supporting role. Joi plays the femme fatale that almost causes leed John Bromfield to get arrested for murder. Joi is probably best known for her role as Sgt. O'Hara who pretends to marry Superman, in the classic Adventures of Superman t.v. series starring George Reeves.
The plot is simple. Good Guy John Bromfield, works for a Used car Lot that happens to sell Hot (Stolen) Cars. When he discovers the dealership is dealing said cars, he storms off. But, his baby child is sick, and John Can't afford to quit without being able to get the money needed to pay the Hospital bills.
Against his better judgement, he remains at the dealership. In steps Hot Car investigator Dabbs Geer. Will John do the right thing and possibly cause his son future illness?
Crystal Clear footage of vintage 50s cars and scenery. Seeing Joi at her sexy best is a bonus.
A great way to spend 62 breezy minutes. Recommended.",1318723200,8,998,4.612359550561798

The story line is fair and the acting is decent. I'd watch it again just to see what things looked like in the simpler era of the 50s.",1419724800,,299,3.6875
