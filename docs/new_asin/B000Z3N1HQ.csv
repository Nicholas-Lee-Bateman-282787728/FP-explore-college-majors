3037779,3,B000Z3N1HQ,I purchased this product in hopes of learning more about human behavior and how the mind attaches to things and how it learns to deattach. Seems to me more of a rating docmunetary that one looking really to teach and inform.,1238025600,3,224,4.487804878048781
3037780,5,B000Z3N1HQ,"As an Alcohol and Drug counselor, I am always looking for new products to show to my therapeutic groups.  This ABC primetime special that was aired in 2007 is excellent. It tells the tale of Daniel Baldwin, the black sheep actor and Baldwin brother who has struggled with addiction for over 20 years.  It chronicles his life, his various relapses (and he has had 8 other rehab attempts before this one) the ups and downs of his addiction, and his stay at a $50,000 a month treatment center. Daniel Baldwin discusses his setbacks and sucesses in a tone that suggests he is telling the viewer what they want to hear.  Mr. Baldwin seems familiar with treatment lingo and concepts, and the viewer at the end is left unsure as to whether or not he has made a real commitment to being sober.  However, Daniel Baldwin is to be commended for showing the television viewer as to what the life of a chronic relapser is really like.
 This DVD provokes an excellent discussion with groups on the nature of relapse, and whether or not someone can really stay clean for a long period of time after having previous treatment attempts.  If you are interested in learning about the thinking process that starts a relapse, or just want to learn more about how someone's life can be devastated by addiction, please get it.",1223856000,66,1303,4.619047619047619

3037783,4,B000Z3N1HQ,"This was an excellent video regarding the interviewing of a person who has been through so many expensive rehabs, and whom, by interview, could not acknowledge his role in his own addiction.  His criminal thinking was evident.  It was just what I was looking for so that I can pause while teaching my clients, and ask them what is wrong with this man's thinking?  Very good instruction material.  Very good lesson for others who are aware of addiction, and the need for one to take ownership of one's responsibility for the behaviors that ""under the influence"" cause in one's life.",1368921600,,581,4.78

Im a drug and alcohol therapist, and this long drawn out dvd serves absolutely no purpose, watching a ""star"" continue to tarnish himself through addiction, hook up with the chef from his rehab, and continue to stay in his pathetuc inflated ego.
