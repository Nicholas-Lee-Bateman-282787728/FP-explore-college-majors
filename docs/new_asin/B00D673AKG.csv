8589839,5,B00D673AKG,"I saw this movie in the theater soon after it came out. This is such a wonderful look at a time in history when there was no equipment from REI.  This is worth seeing just to look at the ""man against nature"" scenes.  I am not going to do any spoilers here, but I will tell you that there are scenes in this movie that I will never forget.  One of them still makes my laugh then I remember it.  The filmmakers have a wonderful knack for telling a story with humor and with detail about a major historical event in the Pacific Northwest.  You won't regret buying this.",1386374400,,566,4.155963302752293

8589841,5,B00D673AKG,"This run was just attempted last month by some people from Bellingham and the weather ended up stopping them in their tracks.  Too bad.  Hopefully this run will be attempted again.

The originals must have been amazing men.

Mr. Warger did a great job on this little movie/documentary.",1378080000,,285,4.875
