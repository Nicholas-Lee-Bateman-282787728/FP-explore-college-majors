8089909,1,B000BNY6BA,"This film was never released to any media format.  The only way this person or company has the film is if they copied it from the TV over 30 years ago, that's why it's on VHS, and would have been illegal to do so.  Plus John Wayne only played a small part in this film, the stars were Jack Holt and Richard Cromwell so Wayne would not be on the cover unless it was home-made.  This is not a long lost film but a bad television reproduction copy.",1383177600,2,445,4.034090909090909
