6208187,5,B00HTMJKRQ,"I absolutely loved it.  Loved the ""quality special effects"" that make watching syfy movies great!  I put this on one night when my mother-in-law was spending the night.  She normally falls asleep watching my ""quality"" movies, but this one she was up til 3 am.  A plus was it stuck with the story , no love scenes or arguments.",1413590400,,326,4.47457627118644

6208191,3,B00HTMJKRQ,"I am a big fan of B horror movies and I watched this movie with extremely low expectations! On the surface this is your typical cheesy grade B horror movie with cheap special effects and so so acting but, on the other hand it really surprised me! This is a movie that is so bad it's actually pretty good and there are moments where I was laughing so hard I was crying! I mean vampire fish consider the possibilities and yes, they work in every vampire cliche you can think of! If you are looking for something a little different then I can recommend this movie but only as a rental, I don't recommend this as a keeper at all. Best described as campy cheesy fun!",1399939200,2,661,4.253968253968254
6208192,3,B00HTMJKRQ,"Nothing really stands out in this movie.
Acting is average at best.
Plot pretty average
Son Sells out Dad in movie and its never even mentioned.

Probably not worth renting.",1396828800,,173,4.766666666666667
6208193,5,B00HTMJKRQ,"Here's the thing...no one, and I do mean no one, watches a SyFy movie or anything that looks like it might be one, under the impression they're getting great cinematic quality. Or even a passing glance at anything that could be reality. That is the beauty of it. This movie had me giggling within five minutes, and curled up in a ball with tears rolling down my face within the first half hour. The sea bats are wonderfully low budget, and the plot line is perfectly absurd. After renting this I immediately ordered a copy to keep, and I will display it proudly on the shelf next to Sharknado, Dead Alive, my Evil Dead trilogy, and my Troma Films collection.",1396569600,16,658,4.491666666666666
6208194,2,B00HTMJKRQ,"While smoking a bunch of weed, script writer Brook Durham looked at a set of dentures sitting on top of a large garbage bag and thought, ""I think I can make a movie out of this. Quick to the Ed Wood machine!""

While diving for gold, a man gets killed by a sea bat, or better yet, CG bat. Rather than inform authorities, they wait. A few more people die and a local marine biologist (Jaqueline Fleming) gets involved as it seems man has disturbed the breeding grounds of these creatures, which like Supercar can travel on land, sea and air.

Seasoned outdoors worker Donna (Cassandra Scerbo) who has silky smooth hands and skin, leads a small group against the creatures. Also know as ""Bering Sea Beast"" when it was shown on TV. The BERING Sea Beast was filmed in Slidell, Louisiana where you really can't see Russia.

Good cheese value but not as good as the ""Mega-shark"" series, or anything with the name shark in the title made in the last few years including Sharknado, Avalanche Sharks, and Ghost Shark.

I was in the Navy, I know sea bats are for real. I have seen them. ;)",1395964800,4,1078,4.429292929292929
6208195,3,B00HTMJKRQ,"*** I enjoy just about all monster /creature films...It really is quite impossible to create an original creature,... and i like to check out the imagined monsters put forth by their creators...this films creatures are ok,.. their more like flying stingrays,.. so not all that original,.. but were pretty menacing,.. being that they could fly,..live out of water,.. and breathe air..
 The title is misleading because none of this movie was filmed in the bearing sea..and 80% of the action sceans are on land??...being i know alaska, and have been exploring thare for the past 27 years, this was filmed on and in the gulf of alaska but not the bearing sea....two seperate worlds entirely..
the plot was decent as well as the young actors...and like i said before,.. its a solid 3 stare monster movie,.. lacks on big action but a fun little watch just the same if ur bord and want to see some creatures, or something to watch with your kids..not a lot of strong violence and no bad language***",1395792000,5,991,4.728323699421965

6208203,4,B00HTMJKRQ,"Look what followed me home, can I keep it?  That's the basic premise of this sea vampire flick.  A small group of nitwits go night diving for gold, besides picking up HUGE chucks of the yellow stuff, they also awaken a sea vampire who kills their diver then follows them back to their port of call.  As they explained it, once it got a taste for human blood.....................(insert maniacal laughter here).  Naturally, like all good citizens, they decide to hush up the death (he was only a deck hand after all).  ""It's not like we murdered him!""  Wonderful, a family without a conscience.  Unfortunately, the body also followed them home and lands on the beach, destined to be found by a nosy marine biologist also willing to forgo informing the authorities until she gets a chance to poke and prod the body (apparently, she does unauthorized autopsies as a side venture).  All goes well until daddy dearest (Kevin Dobson in a mercifully brief appearance as the doomed dad) has the misfortune to have one growing inside of him.  (Hmmm, now where have we seen a beastie burst out of someone's chest?)  Pretty soon, it's up to the final four nitwits to handle the growing sea vampire menace on land and sea.  There's a lot of running, hiding, snapping and snarling......""I'm coming for you suckers!""  They jerry-rig a plan for the jerry-rigged plot that involves claim jumping, the merits of being a single dad, the brightest lights this side of Broadway, and a bad guy who wants to cause ""a permanent accident"" wherever he can.

Wow, this is a really crappy movie with really crappy FX and the worse monster design...........ever!  (They look like raincoats with teeth and a tail.)  It's awe-inspiring what passes for art these days.  Thankfully, it belongs in the limited category of ""so bad it's good.""  I thought it was hilarious.  It wasn't supposed to be hilarious, but there you have it.",1424044800,,1897,4.7846153846153845

8635681,5,B00HTMJKRQ,"Is this movie good? Well, technically no. Is it great? HECK YES.

Those dang sea vampires are up to no good again! Time to get out the backhoe and... dredge the ocean floor? Oh man, they were so into that misinformed scene that they put it on the cover. This movie is ridiculous fun and my family loved every minute of it. Definitely the best bad movie we've had the genuine pleasure of watching.",1513123200,,396,4.351351351351352
8635682,2,B00HTMJKRQ,"just got it today and stuck it in the machine and it was terrible. however, I stayed a little while longer...until the voice of actress cassie scerbo who is a big star (?) somewhere.....as I was saying, until the voice of this actress forced me to press the sound thingie to off.  it's been a while and I can still hear it.....ok....the movie:  movie stinks in almost all details. I mean really bad stuff. just glad jonathan Lipnicki is taking every job he can.  he is a talented guy and the more he works the more he learns.  read the case: depths of unspeakable terror!!!  bloodsucking sea monsters (in capes) !!!

8635683,4,B00HTMJKRQ,"RELEASED TO TV IN 2013 and directed by Don E. FauntLeRoy, ""Bering Sea Beast"" (aka Beast of the Bering Sea) chronicles events on the Alaskan coast when gold dredgers inadvertently unleash bloodsucking sea creatures. When their father (Kevin Dobson) falls prey to the ravenous beasts, siblings Donna (Cassandra Scerbo) and Joe (Jonathan Lipnicki) unite with a stalwart seafarer (Brandon Beemer) and a dedicated marine biologist (Jacqueline Fleming) to kill or be killed by the monsters.

This is a snappy, action-packed TV creature feature with great ocean/gold-dredging location photography. Scerbo stands out in the cast mainly because she looks great in tight pants, which is offset by her feisty, stubborn obnoxiousness. Lipnicki is duplicitous; Beemer is palpably noble; and Fleming is intelligent, celestial and compassionate. Sure, the CGI creatures are cartoony, a meshing of stingrays, vampire bats and frogs, but they're formidable opponents. Unfortunately, the first half is better than the second, which seems to fizzle out despite all the action.

THE MOVIE RUNS 86 minutes and was shot in Slidell, Louisiana (but the mountains in the background show that some of it was shot in the Great Northwest). WRITER: Brook Durham.

8635684,3,B00HTMJKRQ,"this is a very tenuous 3 stars. When this movie started I thought not too bad. The acting was okay and the story was okay and then IT happened. Once the ""sea Vampires"" showed up this went rapidly downhill. The sea vampires were such bad CGI? if it was CGI that it was painful. Once they were introduced the acting and the dialog went quickly downhill too. The actors (I'll get more into them in a bit) made bad attempts to convey fear and terror and suspense and it never worked. The story of waking these beasts up by dredging in the Bering Sea is different but they never gave the scenery a chance to help this dreck happen. Now for the actors....Brandon Beemer and Kevin Dobson gave it the old college try and did the best they could with the company of ""actors"" and story they had. Jonathan Lipnicki (Jerry Macguire kid) was lost at sea and the absolute worst was the I don't know what to do with this character, Cassie Scerbo, she was awful.",1493337600,,946,4.350282485875706
