8325127,2,B000G5SICG,This was a very cloying movie. Very irritating. I did not find it funny at all. I do not recommend it.,1375056000,,102,3.9047619047619047
8325128,5,B000G5SICG,"This is a very funny film written and staring a very funny comic, Kelly Monteith.",1180742400,,81,4.466666666666667
8325129,5,B000G5SICG,"We have always been fans of comedian Kelly Monteith - and loved his sit com in England, as well. So, we had high expectations when we heard he was starring in - and directing this picture. Well, he exceeded our expectations. The story is original. The laughs are painfully true...PLUS you get the always hilarious Teresa Ganzel...and the villian chick from Mission Impossible III as his co star! Keep 'em coming Kelly, we love you!",1170547200,2,431,4.76
8325130,5,B000G5SICG,"I haven't laughed so much in a long time. I recall Kelly Montieth from his appearances on the ""Tonight Show."" He's a really funny guy. When I saw that he not only directed, but appeared in this film, well I couldn't wait for it to arrive -- and it is worth the wait believe me! My whole family loved it.",1169942400,,303,4.066666666666666
