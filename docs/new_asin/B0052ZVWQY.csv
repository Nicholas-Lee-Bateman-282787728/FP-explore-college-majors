4533659,1,B0052ZVWQY,"The above DVD and Blu-ray (supposedly)release
is missing a total of 10mins of crucial footage. The first involves Doug
McClure when he consults the engineer ""Fitz"" played by Tom Skerrit in
the library about a book on engineering specifically on flying. the
second scene is when the scientist character ""Volda"" or ""Brevick"" has a
flashback to how his first escape plan from a top secret facility run
by the Nazis fails after an attempted rescue by British Commandos. The
third scene missing from the DVD / Blu-Ray release is when the blind
character called ""Davies"" an ex British commando has a flashback to the
raid on the Nazis top secret facility and how he became blind due to an
exchange of gunfire during the failed raid. All three scenes are
crucial to the telling of the story and especially the establishment of
the relationship by chance between Brevick and Davies. Do NOT buy this DVD if you want to enjoy the film you remember due to the poor master of this and this product is NOT in Dolby Digital as advertised and it has NOT been remastered to Blu-Ray quality as advertised. NBC Universal should be made aware of this false advertising as i believe amazon.com should be.

4533660,1,B0052ZVWQY,"This DVD was horrid on all aspects! I must emphasize first though that I am COMPLETELY satisfied with the seller! The dismal quality of the DVD is NOT the seller's fault. It arrived on time as promised... To begin with, the DVD was supposed to be in Blu-ray, as mentioned on the cover and back of the jacket. Not only was it NOT in Blu-ray, but the movie looked as though it was filmed by someone holding a camera up to a VHS copy playing on a TV! Extremely grainy fuzzy video, scenes fading out and back in like someone hitting ""pause"" and ""record"" over and over. The audio was depicted as being in Dolby Digital and even displayed the Dolby Digital logo on the back. Not only was it not in Dolby Digital, but the sound was not even in old fashioned stereo! The film's audio was very quiet and distant. It sounded like something from an antique single speaker transistor radio! The back of the DVD mentioned such Blu-ray features as ""... interactive menus and chapter selections."" None of these were there. The DVD loaded, the only option of PLAY came on and that was it! I could have created a better copy using an HD camcorder and Windows 7 Movie Maker!... The debacle of this Blu-ray sham should be strewn at the feet of Timeless Media Group, the distributor of the DVD! To brand this bad Super 8 copy of a classic film with the names of NBC Universal, Blu-ray and Dolby Digital should be a crime! I have several authentic Blu-ray DVDs and some in standard digital format from Universal, some over 10 years old; and they all put this farce to shame in both video and audio quality! I will chaulk this up as a lesson learned and will never order anything from Timeless Media Group ever. Someone should notify Universal Pictures of this ""mistake"". I can't believe they would condone this hideousness!! Thank you.",1320105600,36,1814,4.5

4533663,5,B0052ZVWQY,"Don't expect a pristine transfer - it looks its vintage - but to finally have this on DVD is worth it.

Fine performances by all involved, especially Basehart, lifts this story up to a decent level of entertainment.

4533664,3,B0052ZVWQY,"Would not stand up to today's standards of course, but some good TV actors in roles helped this plot.  Obviously, there are some ""holes"" in the story line (like how did the prisoners know about the song sung by jews at the concentration camps), but although not historically 100% accurate it is an entertaining TV movie.

4533665,3,B0052ZVWQY,"Since I was a kid I have been captivated by ""The Birdmen."" Light, fluffy, exciting, the film is great fun for whiling away 85 minutes as long as your brain has been disengaged and tucked safely under your seat. It has a great cast, a fun plot and a wonderfully hummable recurring theme song in the German folk ballad, ""Die Gedanken Sind Frei."" In fact, it amazed me that an entire story could be woven around a single footnote to World War II history: the creation by resourceful POWs of a glider in the attic of Colditz Castle. (It vanished after the Russians ""liberated"" Saxony.) I am guessing that is the ""true fact"" that the opening narration says the film is based on. Apart from that, Colditz has absolutely nothing to do with ""The Birdmen,"" so what possessed the makers of this DVD to retitled the film ""Colditz: Escape of the Birdmen"" can only be surmised to be pure sensationalism, right down to adding Nazi flags to the photo of the real Colditz Castle on the front cover of the  DVD package. There are lots of explosions and stock footage of bombers in the exciting pre-credit sequence, most of it swiped from other genre films. Sadly, as has been previously noted, Davies' flashbacks, lifted from ""The heroes of Telemark,"" have been cut from this excremental print, probably transferred from a deteriorated 16mm print found in the warehouse of a small-town TV station. The color is washed out, the image is fuzzy and there are countless scratches (which, fortunately, are also fuzzy). That NBC/Universal put their name and logo on the label is frankly amazing. I had to have it for my collection, so I bought a used copy, and relived happy moments from childhood when I first saw ""The Birdmen"" telecast on a local TV station in New Jersey. With any luck, demand for the film will encourage the studio to issue a decent, restored, intact print of this delightful war adventure.",1313020800,22,1888,4.686746987951807
4533666,2,B0052ZVWQY,"I was excited when I came across the Amazon notification of the pre-release of this DVD. Poor transfer, missing scenes, disappointment. When I saw the movie on television in '73 or '74 (as a teenager) it was probably one of the most moving films I'd ever seen.  I'll keep hoping that someone locates a good copy and does it right.",1312588800,,330,4.5
4533667,2,B0052ZVWQY,"This appears to have been copied directly from an old tape to DVD, with no attempt to clean up the picture or sound.  My fifteen year old VHS tape of the movie is much clearer and sharper than this DVD.  In addition, I noticed a couple of scenes are missing.  One is a bit of the opening that was taken from ""Memphis Belle"" (no great loss.)  The other is the flashback scene in which the blind commando recalls the rescue mission during which he lost his sight.

The movie, loosely based on two different WWII incidents, is terrific.  If you haven't seen it, it's worth ordering this DVD at only eight bucks.  But if you're hoping to replace your worn out VHS copy with a nice new DVD, save your money.",1311984000,,702,4.312977099236641

The transfer is poor by technology standards. All the flaws on the original tape or film is copied here. The sound is mono. In short, I love the movie but am gravely dissapointed by the quality of the transfer. There is a disclaimer at the beginning od the disc to this effect. I probably would have baught it anyways, but it would have been nice to be warned in advance.

4533674,5,B0052ZVWQY,"This made for TV movie was pretty good for network television.

Based on true events, the Escape of the Birdmen was in some ways a watered down Hogans Heroes where the commandant (Basehart) and the major (Doug McClure) have a mutual understanding and this is not played often enough.  I really liked their cat & mouse conversations.

Dougs character has to get this scientist across the border and back to the UK for research that will create a weapon that will end the war, implying the USAs Manhattan Project and atomic research.

Old favorite character actors such as Rene (whom I remember from Star Trek:Deep Space Nine) and Max (from Beverly Hillbillies) with a very odd moustache, and finally Chuck Connors (one of the best Western actors on television at that time).

Final Thoughts:

Was not as exciting as I remember.  The theme song is played pretty much throughout the film.  Would have been nice to have some musical variety of soundtrack.  Richard Basehart (of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea) makes a convincing Nazi (and he also played in a film called Hitler).

Overall a good entry into network TV.

4533715,3,B0052ZVWQY,"Originally airing on ABC as a movie of the week in 1971, The Birdmen (aka Colditz: Escape of the Birdmen) takes some factual historical events from World War II, and constructs an interesting and edgy story with an overdramatic fictional conclusion, as Allied prisoners of war (POW's) construct a glider and make a daring bid for freedom.  While most of the events depicted did not actually happen, the adventure does contain some elements of truth which makes for an idealized vision of what might have been.

During the war, Colditz Castle was converted from a hospital to a POW facility.  Located high on a hill, the ancient castle was used to house Allied prisoners with a previous history of escape, or specialized skills in evasion.  With so many experts in one location, some ingenious schemes were hatched, with some resulting in successful escapes.  Perhaps the most daring scheme was the secret construction of a glider that was to be launched from the roof.  Although the glider was constructed, it was never launched, as the end of the war was approaching.  For some strange reason the name Colditz is not mentioned in the film, instead the castle is referred to as ""Breckstadt"".

The Birdmen takes this actual event, and embellishes it to a great degree, as Major Harry Cook (Doug McClure) is an OSS officer, assigned to deliver Halden Brevik (Rene Auberjonois), a Norwegian nuclear physicist, into Allied hands.  Brevik is masquerading as ordinary pilot when he and Cook are captured, and assigned to a POW facility located in a castle.  A Luftwaffe officer named Schiller (Richard Basehart) is in command, and communicates in English with the prisoners.

Colonel Morgan Crawford (Chuck Connors) is the Allied senior officer, and in charge of the escape committee.  As Cook and Brevik must keep their mission a secret, it takes a while for them to earn the trust of the other prisoners, but eventually Major Cook gets the approval to proceed with a daring plan.  Realism comes more into play as the film focuses on the construction of the glider, which is very much is a team effort.  A false wall is built in an attic space, and the bulk of the construction of the glider takes place in this hidden compartment.  Matters are complicated, when a suspicious Schiller institutes a number of roll calls, but work still manages to proceed.  The cloth covering the glider frame is stiffened with starch refined from porridge, and the prisoners also rig up an elaborate launching system for the glider, involving pulleys and a weight provided by a bathtub.

The film contains a number of sidebars that add to the drama, including a prisoner who is killed while trying to crash out of the castle in a truck.  The dead man is buried in the courtyard of the castle, and during his funeral the prisoners sing a song that annoys the Germans, Schiller in particular.  Paul Koslo plays a British prisoner who lost his eyesight while on a mission to free Brevik, and Schiller is shown ignoring a bulletin with Brevik's photo, which allows the scientist to escape detection.

Doug McClure might be a little young to play a major, but he makes a capable and attractive hero type.  Chuck Connors often plays a tough guy with a hair trigger temper, but here he is a little more retrained and reflective.  This is an early movie appearance for the versatile Rene Auberjonois, who would become very popular on TV in the 70's.  Max Baer Jr., known to a generation as Jethro on The Beverly Hillbillies, is good in a more conventional role.  The film also features Tom Skerritt and Greg Mullavey as POW'S.  Richard Basehart, who once played Hitler, at times seems to be challenging the Fuhrer in his portrayal of Schiller, who while not a madman, is quite gruff, egotistical, and with a tendency to rant.

The prisoners assigned to Colditz were all well-known to the Germans as dedicated escape specialists.  So while a nuclear scientist in disguise, who might turn the tide of the war, makes for a good story, it simply could not have happened.  Although the real glider never flew, that probably wasn't an option for the movie, as featuring the glider's flight was too dramatic and cinematic an event to pass up.

Timeless Media Group specializes in classic TV programs, and they usually do a decent job with their releases, but unfortunately this transfer looks like a VHS tape.  The colors are a little dull, and the image lacks sharpness.  The DVD has no extra features, and is a real disappointment to those expecting a quality remastered transfer.  While not in the class of films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Escape/dp/0792838408/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Escape</a>&nbsp;(1963) or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stalag-17/dp/6305678790/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stalag 17</a>&nbsp;(1953), The Birdmen is in the same tradition, and incorporating some elements of truth, is a nice testimony to those men whose desire for freedom could not be crushed.

4533717,3,B0052ZVWQY,"As stated by other reviewers this disk is no where near the quality a blu ray should be. But the video does seem to get better about 10 minutes into the film. I have been looking for this movie for a long time. I am a Doug Mcclure fan. If you like this film this bluray is still the best way to see it. I seriously doubt it will ever be released in better quality. This film has the aformentioned Doug Mcclure, Chuck Connors, Richard Basehart, Rene Auberjonois, and Max Baer Jr. This interesting cast and cool flick deserves better.",1322870400,3,532,4.33
4533718,4,B0052ZVWQY,"This is a fairly ambitious made-for-television-movie about an aerial escape from a POW camp in Germany during World War Two which I first saw when it was broadcast in 1971. The big surpise upon seeing it again was that one of the main characters is played, very well as usual, by Ren&eacute; Auberjonois - Odo from ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" and Father Mulcahy in the movie version of ""M*A*S*H"".
 Although the story seems almost unbelievable it is as a matter of fact quite true and is well worth watching.",1322352000,,508,4.644444444444445

8454904,3,B0052ZVWQY,"I remember this TV movie from when I was younger and jumped when I saw that it was available.  It didn't fully stand the test of time, but it was a nice distraction for an evening.  The history of it is almost non-existent and many of the characters are cardboard cutouts we've all seen many times before.  By far not the best of the 'based on actual events' W.W.II films, but for nostalgic reasons I'm not sorry to have made the purchase.",1515369600,,439,4.329268292682927

8454907,4,B0052ZVWQY,"I really like this movie - especially given that is was a movie of the week. That being said a few things about this release. 1. This was a TV movie airing under the title ""The Birdmen"" in the US. 2. A different version was shown theatrically in parts or Europe under the title ""Operation Braindrain - Codename: Chessboard"" 3. As per the now defunct Angelfire BIrdmen webpage ""The video release has several scenes that are not included in the domestic version. Thrse is an extensive opening sequence of Allied bombers and pilot briefings, the meeting of Cook and Brevik in a Nazi workcamp and their escape, a flashback as Brevik recalls failing to meet the commandos sent in to Norway to get him out, and another flashback where Davies recalls the incident that caused his blindness."" (when you view this DVD you will note a marked difference in the quality after the opening sequence - I believe they spliced the European opening onto a better quality print of the US TV version - which may account for the omission of the flashback scenes as denoted in earlier reviews.) 4. This story was inspired by true events but this escape as depicted here didn't happen. 5. ""Colditz"" never appeared in the title when this was released and was tacked on somewhere for some reason - presumably to tie into the mini series or to confuse folks about what this was - not really certain. ....All of that being said this is a fun film. One can see how much better it could have been had it been made for theatrical release with a larger budget - in the right hands this could have been on par with Victory or Force Ten from Navarone - these aren't high water markes in cinema I grant you but solid 70s WW2 adventure films.... made earlier - and with some re-writing (as I say this was not a true story but ""inspired by"") this could have been up there with The Heroes of Telemark. All of that being said I like this one and will be actively seeking out a copy of the European version. If this had been a true Shout Factory release what we may have gotten would have been the European Cut and the US version and perhaps even a combined cut - which is what this DVD appears to be. I will be searching out the Euro cut and will update this review should any of this be inaccurate. In the interim, you could do worse than this film but definitely give it some time as the picture quality is rough but does get better - this one is not for videophiles but for lovers of WW2 adventure films.",1489795200,2,2469,4.381263616557734

8454910,1,B0052ZVWQY,"I expected a high quality Blu Ray movie but after viewing it, feel that I got cheated.  This movie was worse than VHS quality (very fuzzy).  I wasted my money on a very poor resolution quality movie that wasn't even a full screen view.  I would never recommend this movie to any prospective buyer unless they are satisfied with VHS tape quality.

8454912,5,B0052ZVWQY,"REVIEW OF MOVIE NOT DVD! I have had a 'bootleg' copy for years. As a big fan of WII Nazi and McClure I got this from another collector of
those great network movies they use to make which most are not available on VHS or DVD. This is one of the great TV movies and most like
this one were and are better than big Hollyweird budget movies! This could have been released on big screen. It has got McClure and Chuck
Conners and many other big stars. Based on true story this movie is very well done with the writing, directing and acting. No it's not filled with
CGI effects and blood and gore but it has good story characters and action for those who like good classic movies without all the garbage added.
If you grew up like me watching and enjoying these kinds of movies this is a good one to get started again. Relive the golden years of TV movies.",1482710400,,850,4.189024390243903
