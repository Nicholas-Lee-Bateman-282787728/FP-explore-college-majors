8165262,3,B000LXH5HC,"My son and I enjoyed watching how the US Navy has preserved the USS Constitution for almost two centuries.  I have to say that, as a former square rigger sailor in the Coast Guard barque Eagle, for me it was painful and even embarrassing watching the Navy crew learn to sail a square rigger.  It's clear that the Navy did not ask for help from the US Coast Guard, which has decades of practical experience sailing such ships.  In the end, they manage to set and work just six sails, and truly it must have been a glorious day.",1179187200,2,526,4.292929292929293
