3454325,4,B001AJIWQE,"In this coming of age story, a young lesbian learns how to rise against the system and defy everything she's learned about what it means to be a woman.

Who best to create a movie about women than a female director? Jamie Babbit, who has worked on ""Alias,"" ""The L Word"" and ""Nip/Tuck,"" helps the audience see America for the male-dominated society that it is.

3454328,5,B001AJIWQE,"there have negative and positive reviews of this movie. people as usual indicate they didn't care for the feminists in the movie to be like them (you find that argument in most gay movies). its a movie about gay feminists mostly except shulie and annas mother.
yes the feminists in this movie take measures to illegal lengths and were not perfect people. Sadie was pretty strong in her march as a feminist but you find in a short while that shes rather gutless in her own life and jumps from girl to girl while still with her older more conservative girlfriend who runs a non profit womens group called women for change but isn't as radical as the c(I)a that sadie is with.  anna stomps on her family and friends (id say co workers but they were kind of hm douchebags? lol) and has to learn that everyone isn't her enemy and that though she is finding a sense of power for the first time she needs to care about how she affects the people in her life. meats still holding onto alot of anger about her affections for sadie. courtneys feeling like an old worn out shoe. shulie has no faith in anybody. aggie, well aggies precious, i just love aggie. they aren't perfect people and most are budding feminists still tripping over their own two feet.
i questioned the facts thrown out in this movie but they seemed to pan out.
i love this movie. its lots of fun and with a generattion that takes advantage without apreciation of the right that they hold today it sets a spark to get the attention of a new generation of feminists and in a world still in need of change that in itself is important.",1324944000,2,1592,4.396610169491526
3454329,2,B001AJIWQE,"This indie proves why having a remote control with fast-forward and skip buttons is so important. The oh-so P.C. characters include lesbian, bisexual, and a female-to-male trannie wannabe. The central roles are that of a Latina who lusts after an Anglo blonde, that in turn leeches milk and honey from a diligent 'sugar mama' at least 25 years her senior. Rage against the patriarchal manipulation and exploitation of women's natural beauty is the fuse that brings the gang of anarchist girls and faux boy together, but the absence of not-so-young and not-so-slender members promotes the very same misogynist intolerance that mandates what female ages and body types are acceptable in our society, and its films. But then after all, this is a comedy...no, a dramedy...no, a...well, actually, it's a dud. Whatever ""message"" lurked in the minds of the creators, the absurdist rampages become one too many contrived tantrums. (And just in case you don't notice immediately: gay and lesbian cinema earns one more lesbian script with a subplot of infidelity flowing like spring waters.)",1319068800,,1081,5.218390804597701
3454330,4,B001AJIWQE,"This was an amazing movie. Unlike all of the outgoing lead characters in most LGBT movies, the lead in this movie is a quiet girl who has a hard time speaking up for herself. During the movie, she gains empowerment. As soon as I saw Jamie Babbit's name in the credits I knew that there was a high probability of the movie being great and I definitely was not disappointed. There were some things about the plot that I would change. But as a whole, I still loved the film and look forward to seeing it again.",1304640000,,507,4.237113402061856

3454332,4,B001AJIWQE,"In the late 1970s I saw women wearing ""Itty Bitty Titty Committee"" t-shirts, as if they had to apologize for having slight builds.  The contemporary film ITTY BITTY TITTY COMMITTEE reminds us not enough has changed as its opening scenes depicts lead character Anna working for a cosmetic surgeon catering to women who want to make a besty chesty investy.

While it has its point about the state of double standards in America, ITTY BITTY TITTY COMMITTEE entertains AMERICAN GRAFFITI-style as young Anna, chancing upon a small female activist group trying to raise awareness and make a name for itself, comes of age.  The common ideals of the women up against interpersonal drama (lesbian love triangles, to name one distraction) and zero budget, Anna and her new friends see more growing pains than success as the organization attempts to reach the public.  As the film concludes, perhaps you'll agree these women can still claim victory in the experience they shared.

ITTY BITTY TITTY COMMITTEE holds your attention throughout.  It may be no surprise to find yourself rooting for both the group to hit it big and Anna to figure out where she belongs.

3454340,1,B001AJIWQE,By far one of the worst films I have ever seen.....Claire of the Moon was equal in being a boring film. Wasted film media in my opinion.,1246579200,2,136,4.074074074074074
3454341,2,B001AJIWQE,"This film's politics represent some of the weaker--and whiter--aspects of second and third wave feminism. As a result, it offers a vision of feminism that ignores those issues of most pressing interest to third world women/women of color, queer and otherwise. The main character is latina, but her family is very bourgeois; her ethnicity exists to add multicultural ""color"" but not anti-racist critique.

I was particularly upset by how the film appropriated the figure of Angela Davis: early in the film, the protagonists put a statue of Davis in the part, next to a sign that says ""Angela Davis never got the props she deserves Thank you Angela! Women like you changed the world."" Although the sign recognizes in its grammar that Davis is still alive, it locates her activism in the past, in the history of the black power movement, a movement that is conjured in the movie not by reference to the white supremacy that that movement sought to combat, but by a visual reference to  Davis's iconic afro. Angela Davis is currently a tenured professor in the History of Consciousness program at UC Santa Cruz. Her recent work fighting the prison-industrial complex forms a major aspect of her work in anti-racist struggle. See for example her recent book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Are-Prisons-Obsolete/dp/1583225811/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Are Prisons Obsolete?</a>&nbsp;Given that Davis's work focuses on the California prison system, and its effects on those--including queers and trannies of color--who are most vulnerable in our society--it would have been a very relevant and important aspect to incorporate into the film. At the very least, to respect Davis's work requires taking it to heart. Otherwise, they are just appropriating her ""brand"" to their privileged and naive political ""radicalism.""

For that matter, paying more attention to the work of Davis and other women of color would have allowed the script to offer real critiques of marriage instead of second wave slogans and vapid ""down with the man"" arguments. [...]",1244505600,6,2085,5.468944099378882
3454342,1,B001AJIWQE,This was a horrible movie!  I can not believe I sat all the way through it (I was hoping it would get better...IT DIDN'T. Save your money and get something else,1244332800,,160,4.161290322580645
3454343,2,B001AJIWQE,"To quote Leslie Felperin's review in Variety, ""Great title, shame about the movie.""

Actually, the title is only tangentially related to the film.  Secondly, the tagline for this movie (""Every generation needs a new revolution"") sums up its painfully unaware self-importance.

Not only was the acting shameful, but the dialogue writing was atrocious.  It was clear that no editor had been over the script, which can alleviate some of the concerns over acting, but also--even when there are bad lines, you can TELL when someone couldn't deliver them even if they were good.  Example: Carly Pope.  She is awful.  She's especially cringe-worthy when we get glimpses into her non-crusty self, because the actress only knows how to yell or be mean.  The scene at the marriage rally in Sacramento, and pseudo-playful lines like, ""Jesus, you dykes are such closed-minded b****es,"" are a) just Godawful, b) could have worked much better if edited or recited better.  Trimming it to, ""Jesus, you're so closed-minded"" or ""Stop being a closed-minded dyke!"" would have been funnier, and saying it flippantly (in a way Pope likely is incapable of doing) would have vastly improved it.  Also, cursing a lot does not make up for talent deficiencies.

Furthermore, there is a lack of likable characters.

Anna is whiney, immature, and her ""growth"" seems to consist of becoming the epitome of why the mass populace hates feminists / queer activists.  She becomes inconsiderate of her family and co-workers, hostile without provocation, and seems to think that self-confidence and self-esteem involve spray-painting her room (in her parents' home) with words like ""cock,"" ignoring customers, snapping at people around her, and storming out of work while demanding, in a presumptuous and volatile manner, that others cover for her.  Unlike Megan from But I'm a Cheerleader, who showed personality, dignity, and composure and truly found a grounded sense of self through evolution viewers could directly watch on-screen, Anna shows stagnation, clinginess, and juvenile irresponsibility in her life, throughout the film.  It's difficult, then, to see her attractiveness.

The whole film should have been centred around Aggie, one of very few characters I could feel sympathy towards.  His role was extremely minor, but he proved to be the only decent human being with sensitivity in the film--he is a great face for the activist movement, contrasting totally with the other whiney, overly aggressive, stand-offish ""representatives"" for the cause.

While we're on the topic of radicalism, let's talk MONOGAMY, which was a theme that the director/writers seemed to overlook.  While fighting marriage, boob jobs, and the other ever-present symbols of patriarchy, they failed to include monogamy in this category.  Sadie, the only truly polyamorous character, is continually faulted for her inability to leave a long-term older (and more mainstream) girlfriend, Courtney, in order to commit to her monthly flings.  Both Meat and Anna are crushed when she refuses to devote her romantic life exclusively to either of them, and Anna is rebuked for a brief fling with another of the C(i)A members.  Paralleling the rest of the film, the director/writers show obliviousness on this issue, much like they show blindness to the clichs of the film by neglecting parody and satire.

Also, the deadpan, hackneyed Smith and Sarah Lawrence references fall completely flat.  If you're going to bring up gigantic stereotypes, you've got to have humour to back it up, or show some recognition of how ridiculous it is that you're including the stereotype.  There should be some irony and self-conscious snarkiness.

Lacking any of the self-deprecating, self-referential humour that made But I'm a Cheerleader so brilliant and spot-on, IBTC also fails in emotional integrity and complexity, and even sensitivity and exploration.  Two-dimensional and sermonising, IBTC is a horrible way to expose non-activists to activism.  It is awful misrepresentation.  It's just utterly false and trite and caught up in the superficial, stereotyped aspects of radicalism.",1235088000,25,4117,5.359253499222395

3454345,3,B001AJIWQE,"The message of standing up for women's rights and fighting the objectification of women was the one saving grace of this film. The characters could not have tried any harder to overact, and it was barely watchable. Or perhaps I've outgrown this age bracket of Lesbian drama. My partner and I watch some of the ""standouts"" occasionally, but this one will not be a benchmark for me.

The movie does offer some interesting psychological twists such as the relationship between the older woman who founded an organization, and the young, blonde (and extremely overacted), girl. The ""roughing up"" of the network was funny, and the highlight of the film, but overall, this film was a ""miss"" for me.",1232496000,,692,4.864406779661017

3454347,2,B001AJIWQE,"This movie was not only boring, but was a waste of time.  I rented it because first of all, it is a lesbian movie. Next, because the character MAX from ""L Word"" was in it.  I was thoroughly disappointed.  I guess if you are totally bored and have seen every other lesbian movie out there, you could waste a Tuesday night for almost 2 hours, but I definitely would not recommend it.  It is cheesy, and almost too stereo-typical.  The ""almost"" funniest part is when the main character writes on the bathroom wall at her place of employment that ""men put chemicals in tampons to make you bleed more, so that you will have to buy  more tampons"".

3454351,5,B001AJIWQE,"I was blown away by this movie.  Most of the other reviews comment on what a great lesbian romantic comedy this is (which it is), but what stood out to me more is the politics and approaches to activism.  I was very compelled by the conflict between the culture jamming activism of the CIA (Clits in Action) and the activism of the older partner of the CIA's leader (who is, in the film, head of the National Women's Coalition).  For me, this conflict is a rather personal one... do we work within the system for change (through women's organizations and lobbies) or do we take the advice of Audre Lord: that ""the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house"" and go outside the system as the primary characters in this film do?  Is it possible to change society while still following its rules?  Is perhaps a combination of both forms of activism best?  This film does a great job examining these issues in the midst of humor, warmth and characters that are very compelling and real.  I can't wait to get my hands on a copy so I can watch it 30 or 40 times more (thus far I've only seen it once)!",1219881600,16,1107,4.397058823529412

Eye roll after eye roll this predictable ""lesbian romp"" only had a chance had it not played into those typical lesbian stereotypes.  i've seen this on the screen before. the only saving grace for me on this one is that it was in fact jamie babbit and i had a few giggles and of course, being older, i enjoyed the soundtrack that called to my younger years. i guess i could suggest this film if you are looking for something better than say....claire of the moon or better than chocolate, but beyond that, stick with but i'm a cheerleader and popular because that's camp that succeeds.",1216339200,10,1184,4.397260273972603

It is primarily a love story between two very sexy lesbians, who happen to be committed activists.  Their struggles against what they see as society's continuing oppression of women is never very believable, but the love story is real enough, and the lovers are sympathetic.  You want them to get together, because you can easily see that they are meant for each other.

So much so, that she decides to join their ranks and subsequently falls head over heels for their leader, Sadie (Nicole Vicius). Sadie is equally smitten, but the situation seems hopeless as Sadie already has a girlfriend, Courtney (Melanie Mayron), who is bankrolling C(i)A.

Despite the difficulties, Anna and Sadie hookup leading to lots of hot lesbian sex. When they have a falling out and the future of C(i)A is in jeopardy, Anna spearheads a high profile stunt to get C(i)A national coverage and push the group into the spotlight. However, the stunt could either bring Sadie closer to Anna or push her further away and into the waiting arms of Courtney.

Jamie Babbit again brings us a unique film exploring queer culture, this time from the perspective of a radical feminist group trying to make their mark on society. Babbit is also the director of `But I'm A Cheerleader,' and the producer of `D.E.B.S'.

The film boasts a fantastic cast, fellow members of C(i)A include Carly Pope as Shulamith, Lauren Mollica as Aggie, and Deak Evgenikos as Meat along with appearances by Daniela Sea and Guinevere Turner.
