8417578,3,6304119461,"This is a cute story about a boy (Tom) who has several 'hidden' monsters living with him. The story revolves around their search for one of their missing monster friends (Colin) on Christmas eve. Colin ends up scaring Santa who falls out of his sleigh, and into Tom's chimney, hurting his leg. Tom and his monster friends decide to help Santa deliver presents while he rests in Tom's bed. Meanwhile there's also a cat burglar on the loose in Tom's neighborhood where the monsters are searching for Colin. Comic relief is provided by two bumbling policemen searching for the burglar. Everything ends up rosy at the end with a monster party and Santa bidding farewell as he flys off on his sleigh. And the policemen catch the cat burglar.

There are a couple of cute and somewhat catchy songs, particularly the one where Tom and his monster friends make some Christmas 'pudding' or 'pud' as they say (a mixture of a little of everything).

This is not animation up to quality Disney standards, or even Hanna Barbara for that matter, but it's done with love nonetheless. My five-year-old son loves this movie.

Note that there is no mention at all of the real Christmas story.",1101945600,,1173,4.712195121951219
