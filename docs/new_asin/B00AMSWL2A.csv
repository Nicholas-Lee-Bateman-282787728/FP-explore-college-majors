8554308,5,B00AMSWL2A,"I believe it is the nature of the THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN gunfighters, their motives for that one chance at gallantry and redemption. That combined with the way the story is visually told makes for its greatness. It teaches us something about nobility, dignity and devotion. The hearse-ride taken up to Boot Hill with Yul Brynner driving and Steve McQueen riding shotgun sets the stage and tone for the entire film. Images such as when Charles Bronson, is bent over with a bullet inside and the three little Mexican boys clutch him crying out his name while in his death throes bring a tear to the eye. In another the viewer reflects along with Yul Brynner as he takes the lifeless James Coburn's knife out of the adobe wall and folds it gently in his hand. These are heart rendering and indelible images. Even Eli Wallach as the bandit Calvera gets his moment of pathos. After being mortally wounded by Yul Brynner's bullet, Calvera can not believe that the seven came back to save the village even after the villagers told them that they did not want their help anymore. ""You came back. A man like you. Why?"" asks Calvera as he dies. Yul Brynner has no answer for him. It was as if Brynner had committed some sacrilege.

Director John Sturges captured the ambiguities of the human spirit in this film.
For me Yul Brynner was the epitome of `cool' and aplomb. From his dark gray and black outfit down to the tip of his thin cheroot he was the kind of man others look up to but keep their distance. Yul Brynner as Chris, was a man of few words and often communicated by the mere gesture of the hand. Of the seven, he was the cohesive element that drew them together simply by his demeanor. The aura of his worldliness beckoned them all to the place he was heading. He was just the first to recognize it. Brynner too was the cohesive element that kept them all together. Brynner was the one who followed some unwritten code of honor that is only alluded to in a few passages. McQueen was perfect as the gunfighter who was ""just drifting"" and signed on with Brynner. The levelheaded McQueen represents the other characters' realizations one by one as they join. James Coburn was perfect, as the stoic knife throwing Britt, who lived only for the thrill of the moment. Charles Bronson as O'Reilly played his stoically rugged but sympathetic role better than any actor could have. Bronson had a unique visual presence whose kind facial expressions counterbalanced his pockmark face and strong physique. Bronson was a conundrum unto himself and perfect for the role. Brad Dexter's performance as the unlucky fortune hunter has gone unrecognized. He was the least noble of the seven and died the mercenary to the end. Still, he gains our sympathy after returning in the clutch and saves his friend Chris and in turn is killed. Dying in the arms of his friend, Chris lets him go to the grave with a lie. Robert Vaughn's character was probably the most interesting of the seven. His enigmatic portrayal of Lee the tormented soul and not really the coward he labeled himself somehow never stood out. Only his act of redemption, his gun play and death during the finale lingers. Vaughn's portrayal is a success because as he said he was ""the coward hiding out in the middle of a battlefield"" and at that he succeeded. Horst Buchholz gave an energetic and bravura performance the only one of the seven that had not yet been corrupted by the world. At the end he symbolically hangs his guns up and roles up his sleeves. Brynner and McQueen say that ""only the farmers have won"" and they lost. As they ride off into screen immortality I think we all won.

THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is probably one of the best and most widely known and remembered Spaghetti Westerns ever produced. Arguably, this may also be Sergio Leone's directorial masterpiece of that genre. The film's narrative flow, visual style, script, music, acting, cinematography and even the dubbing and sound effects make for one cohesive artistic statement. So much has been said about this film that it is virtually impossible to say anything more. Yet, there is always room for more. One element that always astonished me was how the film manages to take a somewhat little known campaign of the Civil War at Glorietta Pass in New Mexico and use that as the backdrop of this fascinating film.

BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID was made at a special time where filmmaking was rethinking many things, trying to stay current with so many changes in society coming out of the 60s. Does it take itself seriously or not? Perhaps that is the magic of it. Butch and Sundance in this film are young at heart in a western landscape shrinking and aging before their eyes. Yes, there is magic here. The humor, the tragedy, living life to its full are so personified here. Burt Bacharach's score is so unwestern, yet so modern, but still yet so romantic to reflect those times when the landscape and the heroes were vanishing from the horizon. I look back on this film with fond memories. I smile a bit and savor the moment.",1418083200,4,5067,4.627777777777778
