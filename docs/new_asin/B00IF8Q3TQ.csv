8641840,1,B00IF8Q3TQ,"Just a batch of bad interviews, some unbearably lame and uninteresting, even embarrassing to see the kind of interviewers and questions guys so cool have to go through it. Bad image quality and sound too. Big disappointment. VH1 or even E! would be WAY better than this",1406073600,17,269,4.74468085106383
8641841,1,B00IF8Q3TQ,"As a fan of Imagine Dragons, I'm disappointed in this DVD. I was expecting an interview and performances. What I got was low quality interviewed by different media outlets and edit into a DVD. It was badly edit and not worth buying. All the interviews featured on this DVD can be seen on YouTube. I'm very unsatisfied and I can't believe I bought it.",1405123200,18,350,4.484375
