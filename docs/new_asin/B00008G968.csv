7983874,3,B00008G968,"Of the two, I liked Bikini Airways more.

Julie Snow and Loni Lynn are very watchable. Especially that long scene in the restroom.

The pilot and co-pilot were funny. And it had a cute plot with lots of humor, intended or otherwise.

A number of reviewers said they couldn't find Bikini Airways-- I turned my dvd over and it was on the other side.",1368576000,,347,4.390625

7983876,2,B00008G968,"So, she has inherited a bankrupt airline from her uncle Hugh Janus and decides to throw a wild bachelor party to raise $25,000. The actors stop to deliver monologues about themselves into the camera for no apparent reason. I guess this is their way of begging for work after being cast in this flop. The empty plot is relieved by some wild sex scenes standard for this series of films, but even they are ruined by our snapshot taking  pilot (Jay Richardson) who wants to sell the photos as souveniers for ten dollars each. The film's cheap home movie sets must've not cost much more than that.",1225756800,,593,4.542056074766355
7983877,3,B00008G968,"Terri (Regina Russell) inherits Janus Airways with its one airplane from her uncle Hugh Janus (say his name once or twice until you get the joke).  She needs $25,000 to pay off the airlines debts and comes up with the idea of having girls in bikinis man the ticket counter to inspire clients.  Many are inspired, but no one actually buys any tickets.  Fortunately, rich guy Gary (Brad Bartram) has to get to his wedding in Miami to Francine (Wendy Divine), and since the girls in the bikinis were going to be the entertainment at his bachelor's party, Terri comes up with the bright idea of flying Gary to Miami and having his bachelor party on the flight (take a wild guess how much it will cost Gary).

This 2003 direct to video movie is your standard late night cable combination of soft core and soft comedy, the later provided by Captain Sam (Jay Richardson) and Dave (Sam Silver), who do their shtick with no concern for whether or not it is funny.  Still, Richardson gets credit for being for nailing all of the bad jokes and being the only actor in the film totally at ease with his character and the story line, mainly because he does not have to do anything but watch the half-dozen sex scenes that are the main selling point of ""Bikini Airways.""  The verdict is that the scenes involving the women (Kylie Biscayne as Vicki, Loni Lynn as Traci, and Julie Snow as Pam) are better than those involving the guys on the plane for the simple reason that the guys (Leland Jay as Jeff, Frankie Cullen as David, and Noah Frank as Jim) have this silly sophomoric grins on their faces before, during and after the sex scenes.  I see those looks on their face and I do not think that these guys are lucky, I just think they are idiots, which is probably not the point and strongly suggests I am not this film's target audience.

There is an element of mystery here because we are pretty sure Terri and Gary have to end up together, since their names come first in the credits, and it only takes one phone call from Gary to his fianc to convince us that the nuptials will not be taking place (although the incompetence of the pilots is potentially another reason there will be no wedding).  This matters because Terri is part of the ""serious"" sex scenes that bookend ""Bikini Airways.""  Everybody else is just having sex, but Terri is having sex with the man she loves (it just happens to be a different man at the end than it was in the beginning).  The strange thing is that the humor is probably better in than the sex in this film, and you know that just cannot be right.

""Bikini Airways"" might not be as titillating as you would like, but the kitchen sink approach with regards to the humor manages to save it from being an offensive example of this genre.  The end title promised a film to be entitled ""Bikini Frankenstein,"" but apparently the movie has yet to be made, and I have to admit I am ambivalent about such news...",1119139200,8,2928,4.430167597765363
7983878,1,B00008G968,"There is in no way anything in this film that could even remotely be mistaken for hard core content.  It was with out a doubt one of the most disappointing films I've ever seen and wouldn't even classify this as soft core.  My advice to anyone who's out shopping for films of a truly adult nature is that they ignore the reviews listed by wanna be film critics who wouldn't know a good film if it fell out of the sky, landed on their face, and started to wiggle.  Go online and find real info about the films you are interested in, or narrow certain studios that you know turn out quality work.  This piece just wasn't even worth the plastic it was re-mastered  on.",1109376000,6,665,4.288
7983879,5,B00008G968,"Can't say much 'bout this movie but it's a must-have who wants the discovery of erotic or hardcore films. I don't call this ""adult"". I call this a more hardcore porn film than it has been 'cuz of the eroticness, sex, masturbating and everything. This would turn u out. 'Specially check out Playmate of the Apes w/ Misty Mundae in it. It's such a great adult classic.",1106524800,2,366,4.477611940298507
