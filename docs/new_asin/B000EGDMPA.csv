8210504,3,B000EGDMPA,"After having seen Doyle BramhallII's Great Wall show on PPV, I ordered this and the Alamo segment of the Wonders of the World series.  After a number of delays, I got an e-mail saying this isn't available.  And recently I've seen the Alamo show won't be available untill Jan. 1, 2010.  Anybody know what's up with the availability of these shows?  I gave it 3 stars because I LOVED Bramhall's show, which was the whole of his portion of the Great Wall show.",1169942400,,457,4.469879518072289
