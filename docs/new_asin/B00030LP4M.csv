8035876,4,B00030LP4M,"Disclaimer: I am not a kendo practitioner, nor a Japanese stylist, but my ignorance may help others in my situation.  I bought this DVD (in rather roundabout fashion, since Amazon initially took my order, then couldn't deliver, and ultimately I used the Amazon-sponsored 3rd party distributor and got the DVD right away...)

Anyway, to someone with my experience, ""kata"" means form.  And ""kumitachi"" means exercises with a partner.  Kumitachi was more along the lines of one-step sparring.  So the title of this DVD implied ""kata""-- sequences for solo practice.  Which is what I wanted.

For some reason, in kendo at least according to the All Japan Kendo Federation, kata means one-step sparring exercises.  Included are ten exercises with katana/tachi, and seven for the wakizashi.  Also are instructions on bowing, wearing the sword, etcetera.

A narrator points out common mistakes verbally, but sometimes lumps five or six errors in one sequence, and it is difficult to tell which means what.  Also, some of the errors are quite subtle to my untrained eye, making the erroneous sequences somewhat difficult to distinguish from correct sequences.  The kata are shown from a lateral angle-- that is viewing the two kendoka from the side.  And then another from an aerial oblique angle, about 30 degrees offset from behind the attacking kendoka.

Again, from an errors standpoint, the angles in kendo appear to be quite subtle, and sometimes I had difficulty discerning what the errors actually were.  I am a martial artist with over 20 years' experience (different systems), so I am not a complete novice in detecting such things.  However, kendo is far different than my native styles, and so I must admit the possibility that I am already biased in my perspective in looking at these DVDs-- in that I am looking at other things that are important in my styles, rather than in kendo.

Visual quality is adequate, and another reviewer commented on the white walls-- to me, these blended quite well with the practitioners' white gi-- making the movements more difficult to discern.

I am sure this DVD is wonderful for the beginning kendoka who is actually training in this style of kendo, because it serves as a good visual reference to their system.  It does not go into such basics as basic strikes, how to hold the sword, stepping/stance, etcetera, and so is not for the complete novice.  Nor is it for the advanced student-- my perception was that the instruction, while good perhaps up to the intermediate student, would simply be review for the advanced practitioner.

All in all, adequate for your $25, but not what I expected or wanted, and I hope this review saves some folks some money.  I do not expect to learn kendo from a book (of which I have read a couple now) nor a DVD.  I am simply looking for concepts to broaden my own training horizons.  However, I was really looking for full-fledged kata, not one-step sparring.",1136160000,5,2938,4.90080971659919
8035877,3,B00030LP4M,It is a nice video which adequately demonstrates the Kata technique and presents both right and wrong styles so that Kendogas can compare and avoid common mistakes.,1123545600,2,164,5.111111111111111
8035878,4,B00030LP4M,"As mentioned previously in the other review you get every Kata you need, yetI do not know why this studio is claiming

this is their title as this is actually just a copy of the

""official"" All Japan Kendo Federation Nihon Kendo Kata produced

by the All Japan Kendo Federation.",1101340800,4,278,4.52
8035879,5,B00030LP4M,"I have found the DVD to be an invaluable supplement to classes and to the often-badly-diagrammed textbooks.  Some prior knowledge in Kendo is necessary to understand the DVD.

This DVD presents:
- Rei
- An quick introduction to all 10 katas: 7 kendo kata plus 3 kodachi kata (with the short sword)
- It then reviews all opening stances, e.g. Chudan, Hidari Jodan.. etc..
- It shows how to switch swords and how to wear the sword depending on whether you have a bokken or a katana.
- It then goes through all the 10 kata again in more detail as follows. For each kata:
1. It presents the kata movement from 2 angles.
2. It repeats some of the movements in closeup and/or in slow motion.
3. It demonstrates common mistakes.
4. It repeats the movement one more time.

Everything I have mentioned above is presented in its own DVD chapter and the menus have thumbnail images for them as well as labels for quick and easy access.

The one odd glitch I found is that when you put the disk in, it starts out on DVD menu page 2 rather than 1. Just make sure to go back one page before playing the video.

The video is shot very well. The 2 Japanese kendoka practice in an empty white room so there is nothing visually distracting in the background. All text labels are clear and bold with black outlines to improve visibility. The audio is well narrated with a clear british voice.",1097020800,24,1373,4.389763779527559
