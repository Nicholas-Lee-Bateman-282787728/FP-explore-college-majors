7888156,3,6305371849,"MASTER OF DISASTER (aka TREASURE HUNTERS, 1982) is a Hong Kong kung fu film that deserves to be seen because of its trio of top kung fu stars, its well-choreographed fight scenes, and the letter-boxed transfer seen in the currently available edition. While two of the stars, Alexander Fu Sheng and Gordon Liu, had appeared together in several superior films (LEGENDARY WEAPONS OF KUNG FU, INVINCIBLE POLE FIGHTER) and had each fought the third star (and chief villain here), Wang Lung Wei, in much better fight scenes in earlier films (THE CHINATOWN KID, FIST OF THE WHITE LOTUS), they're all still consistently exciting to watch in this well-mounted Shaw Bros. presentation.
The bad news is that one has to sit through lots of forced comedy on the part of Fu Sheng and his onscreen partner, newcomer Chang Chan Peng (who seemed to have disappeared from films thereafter) and several supporting players, including a bumbling, cross-eyed police captain (To Siu Ming) whose interference constantly impedes the already underdeveloped plot, which has to do with various parties searching for a hidden treasure to which none have any clear leads.
The director is Lau Kar Wing, who was a competent fight choreographer and actor (he appears here as an elderly, kung fu-fighting antiques dealer) and also directed HE HAS NOTHING BUT KUNG FU, FISTS AND GUTS, DIRTY KUNG FU, and ODD COUPLE. However, he lacks the sure hand and confident touch of his masterful older brother Lau Kar Leung (aka Liu Chia Liang), who showed how to blend comic bits and kung fu more seamlessly in such films as DIRTY HO (1979) and MY YOUNG AUNTIE (1981). This low-cost tape edition of TREASURE HUNTERS at least offers a letter-boxed transfer, a boon to kung fu fans because it enables us to see all of the action.",1041292800,,1782,4.884488448844884
7888157,5,6305371849,"The box art has Gordon Liu all over the box, but this is primarily a Fu Sheng vehicle.  You would think that a movie called Treasure Hunters and starring Fu Sheng and Gordon Liu would have the two of them as treasure hunters.  Uh-uh.  Fu Sheng is the treasure hunter here with Chang Chan Peng.  Gordon Liu enters later as a Buddhist monk.  The movie starts out as a straight up Fu Sheng comedy, with Fu Sheng portraying the upstart, cocky, brash, smirky, highly skilled ruffian he plays all so well.  He is in top form here.  At first, Gordon Liu's appearance comes across as a cameo, and you say to yourself ""but of course...yet another shamelessly marketed film 'co-starring' Gordon Liu.""  Fu Sheng plays strictly for laughs in high comedy with outright slapstick.  Just when I'm about to dismiss the film as some low-brow screwball comedy, THEN THINGS GET INTERESTING...  Gordon Liu returns and gets involved in some wicked hard-core Buddhist monk Shaolin kung fu with the villians.  Shaw Brothers hugely popular villian, Wong Lung Wei (the paunchy never-smiles mustached villian that ALWAYS plays the evil magistrate/junior boss/super villian's right hand guy), gets cooking with his female compatriot.  In this one he's the main villian. We get a look at the awesome ""Five Monk Array"" and I'm starting to really get into this film.  The film does the nearly unthinkable of mixing a screwball Fu Sheng comedy with a serioso Gordon Liu deadpan hard-core kung fu flick...AND IT WORKS!  Also if you like Lung Wei, this is perhaps one of his biggest roles, comparable to his role in Instructors of Death.  You will love this film!",991094400,2,1630,4.833935018050542
7888158,5,6305371849,"Treasure Hunters was actually released as a movie called Dirty Ho. Ho is a man that Gordon liu (the 11th prince) meets at a bar. Ho becomes Liu's servant who must call Liu master after he loses a bet with Liu. There is  comedy, beautiful sets and  costumes, and the kung fu is off the hook  especially the last fight with Lo Lieh. If you are looking for Quality  Gordon Liu shaw brothers movies then get this one.",952473600,,413,4.256410256410256
7888159,4,6305371849,"But Jackie fans beware! After reading the other reviews I felt there needed to be a little clearing up in the matter of what this movie is. First off, I'm what you'd call a Hong Kong Cinema freak. I have seen well  over 200 films from HK. Everything from The Bride With White Hair to The  Demon Wet Nurse. So I know what I'm talking about.
This movie is a Moon  Lee film. The original title was NEW KIDS IN TOWN. It was releashed in the  early 90's over in Hong Kong. What Xenon/Hong Kong Connection did was  add-in scenes from The Protector (which actually does show Jackie &  Moon Lee starring in the same movie). The reason they did it? Yep, as a  previous reviewer wrote: ""to sell more copies."" It is a shame  they had to do it that way but they (Xenon) knew if they just releashed it  as MASTER OF DISASTER Starring Moon Lee most people would go Moon who? And  probably not order it for the main reason of not knowing who Moon Lee is.  Well friends & neighbors, Moon Lee (Lei Choi Fung)is one of the  greatest female action actress' in Hong Kong. Now if it would have been  Moon cast in Supercop instead of Michelle Yeoh/Khan things would be  different. You must understand that good Hong Kong action doesn't start and  end with Jackie Chan & Michelle Yeoh. And if you do then you just don't  understand the genre at all.
Now if I've kept your attention and you are  thinking about getting this DVD, let me add this: the quality of this disc  is surprisingly good. I know this goes against what another reviewer said  but please keep in mind that most HK flicks have a shoe-string buget to  work with and their equipment is less than the best. They also have a  fraction of the time to spend shooting it. I have seen the oringinal video  of New Kids In Town and the DVD transfer is superior to the video of this  film.
So, if you want to broaden your movie horizons into the world of  fast, intense, wild, silly action then give this film a try. And think of  the added Jackie scenes as a bonus. What can it hurt?",947462400,9,2018,4.247368421052632
7888160,1,6305371849,"If you have already read the other reviews on this movie then you know that this is NOT a Jackie Chan movie, but in fact, is a very horrible attempt at a movie with clips of The Protector (A Jackie Chan movie) added  to it. Now, if you have seen this movie and liked the Jackie Chan clips  then you need to get the HONG KONG version of The Protector. Do not get the  American version because it does not have these clips (they were added to  The Protector when released in Asia).",946339200,,479,4.118279569892473
7888161,1,6305371849,"I Was Skeptical When I Ordered This Film Because A Previous Purchase From This Same Manufacturer That Was Labeled A Jackie Chan Film Wasn't (It Was 'Jackie Chan's Second Strike'). Well I Was Proved Correct. This Is NOT A  Jackie Chan Film. It Is An Incoherent & Incomplete Film That Has Scenes  Added To It From The Chinese Version Of 'The Proctector'. (These Are The  Scenes That Were Added To The Chinese Version And Not Seen In The American  Version Of The Film.) Save Your Money And Buy 'The Protector' And See The  Whole Film That Is Miserably Dissected In 'Master Of Disaster'.  ALSO, BE  VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU ORDER ANY 'JACKIE CHAN' MOVIES FROM THIS MANUFACTURER  - 'HONG KONG CONNECTION' THEIR PACKAGES ARE MISLEADING AND THEY LABEL NON  JACKIE CHAN FILMS AS HIS JUST TO SELL THEM.",930096000,3,790,4.666666666666667
