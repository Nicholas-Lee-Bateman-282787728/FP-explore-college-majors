Even though we've all been exposed to this plot (matrix, all the terminators, iRobot and more this one twists it a bit and your hooked-in. Don't blink from the opening scene the audance gets more and more details of the mission.

Being with-in the bounds of actual believability gives this SciFy 2 thumbs-up, dag I Hope all the engineering A. I. Techs watch theses movies too.? Just don't let them think/reasb",1480723200,,471,4.7439024390243905
7622097,2,B01B6MMESG,Clunky CGI. No practical effects but squibs. Otherwise the acting and plot were alright. A decent low budget CGI sci fi flick.,1480550400,,126,4.7727272727272725
7622098,5,B01B6MMESG,Action with a great story to it. Science fiction fans are going to love this. It's about the future of AI and what happens when it thinks and problems solves just like us.,1477958400,3,171,4.212121212121212
7622099,4,B01B6MMESG,"Kill Command. So I had never heard of this movie until last night even though it came out this year in May. It has 57% on Rotten Tomatoes but it sounded just good enough that I gave it a chance and I have to say, I love it. The special effects are great, acting isn't bad, and the story is pretty engaging, if you like SciFi. Full of action and some suspense. It's pretty much a mixture of Predator, Terminator, and any military op type movie. Has an almost 80s SciFi feel, but with more advanced special effects and less cheese. I only had one eye roll moment towards the end, but that's just me.",1471996800,3,597,4.2
7622100,4,B01B6MMESG,"Kill Command tells the story of ""Tech Head"" Specialist Mills and a elite squad of highly trained marines who are sent on a routine training exercise to a remote island  they soon find that their exercise is far from routine and to make matters worse they are being hunted by advanced military robots.

Kill Command is a pretty decent movie which has some really good CGI effects for a low budget film it has a interesting combo of having the slow burning tension vibe of Predator and the vibe of unstoppable killing machines of Terminator which makes the film interesting. the story of the movie is good along with the decent pace of the movie which is enough to keep people interested in the story of the film from start to finish the cast involved all did a good job with the screenplay that had to work with Mills character having an good story arc of a person who has advanced tech being inside her head. the robots were well designed too ranging from flying drones, walking gun turrets to those hulking spider legged killing machines.

With so many sci-fi movies coming out over the years there's always one in the pile that you come across that's worth watching and Kill Command is one of those films some people might be put off with the slow build up of the movie but Kill Command does deliver the goods in terms of a well told story suspenseful moments good action set pieces and well designed robots with cool CGI effects.

If you are a fan of Sci-Fi action movies and enjoyed films like Predator and Terminator then you'll enjoy this film.",1468627200,,1550,4.525
7622101,4,B01B6MMESG,"In the not too distant future the Harbinger Corporation is perfecting drones and robots to replace man in the field of combat. Mills (Vanessa Kirby) has designed self modifying machines and has numerous electronics implanted in her including a set of Google style eyes that does facial recognition and communicates with her creations.

She accompanies a group of combat seasoned soldiers to an isolated area for a training exercise using live ammo. As the ominous music starts as they walk through the woods....

The special effects were very good and the highlight of the film. The film felt like a combination of ""Predator"" and ""Terminator"" which is why it is rated high. The character aspect, i.e. acting and human drama left a little something on the table. The hottest babe in the film was unemotional having a hate-hate relationship with the captain (Thure Lindhardt) of the mission. We get some introductions on the aircraft as Mills (Vanessa Kirby) eye scans everyone's face, but unless you read fast....

Good film if you like the ""Terminator"" stuff.

That led to a too obvious and not very climatic build up and ending.  Very interesting tech ideas that I really liked.  Acting was so-so but not helped with weak character and story development.

Afterwards, I thought, how easily the world would accept just turning the waging of war over to mechanical ""monsters"" in order to avoid spilling the blood of ""our troops"" and think that nothing could be better.  It only takes us another step away from our responsibility for what our country does on a battlefield.

I liked it a lot, and would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.  Loved the story, the characters, and the action.  Special effects were well above what I expected.  Very pleased and I will watch this action thriller again.  I have been telling my fellow co-workers.  Is it John Wick good?  No, but then again I did not pay big bucks for this sci-fi thriller either.  I would love to see a KILL COMMAND 2 as well.",1491868800,,550,4.113207547169812

Kill Command doesn't attempt to make much sense and there are very few surprises. It also feels longer than it's runtime. But for the porn factor this film might have rated another half star, but certainly not more. There are robots trying to kill humans. It's on Netflix.

7622129,4,B01B6MMESG,"Not a Bad movie, much of the acting was predictable for the first 3/4 of the movie with the one civilian / company insider that tags along and the trust, as it climaxed towards the end the trust with the civilian / company insider did grow but in a way it to was a bit expected. But right from the start you can tell that they were going to cannon fader, but I found interesting in this movie is the AI and the robots. The AI as it is depicted is actually being developed be it for robots or your smart phone / smart house, as I have heard in the news and those in silicon valley are a bit worried that things are progressing a bit to fast. But at the same time what is actually being developed is what you see in this movie right at the start and through out the entire movie and that is a bit creepy, I would not want that done to me at all, but I'm sure there will be many will jump at the chance to have it done. I gave it four stars just for the tech that is depicted and I found it interesting with the humans and the robots and that is the one thing that I was not expecting as to why this small group of marines was sent in for training, for a short movie they moved things along and did not drag things out. But the ending was a cliff hanger, at least that is how it seemed to me, I know it is from 2014 and it's 2017 now, but that is how they left it in all honesty, for those reading this, I don't want give away anything but it is worth watching, but keep in mind that much of what is in this movie is being developed.

Great acting and FXs though, and definitely focused on science fiction. There was nothing is the film that made me think, ""What, that was stupid.""  There was no soap opera like drama, and there wasn't even a romance of any sort. That's what I mean by ""tight."" That is, there is no filler at all.

I wanted to give it 3.5 stars, but since I can't, I gave it 4 based on a tight script and good FXs, and nothing moronic happening.

I was never bored, but the message about humans vs machines was done a long time ago, and perhaps better, in the Terminator series (or others).",1489536000,,745,4.416058394160584

There were no A list stars, but ones they had did well, the CGI and what I believe was some use of real robotics in the movie was done extremely well!! The plot was kind of very watered down ideas from other movies, but I didn't mind. The only thing lacking from this movie was substance in the dialogue and a back story. This had potential to be an A list movie with the right star power.
Actually this story would have been or could be, a different angle or alternate dimension of the Terminator story. Basically I'm saying we all know how the Terminator came to be, this movie story could have been and alternate story to tell on the rise of machines.
Back to the movie, it lacked much of the back story, it just kind of dove right in from the beginning and then lacked dialogue that could have filled us in along the way. Wasn't boring, just lacked substance., CGI and action was great. This is a must watch for any sci-fi geeks.",1489363200,,1100,4.344660194174757

I don't regret watching the film, it's not a big budget affair, it's not oscar worthy, but similar to Phantoms (I think that is the name) which came out recently, it's invoking and entertaining.

7622160,4,B01B6MMESG,"Not bad at all for a movie that went straight to video. The CGI was very good for a movie of this type. I hate CGI heavy movies and this had a credible seamless transition between CGI and real action robots. Lets put it this way, the CGI was better than those in Star Wars Episodes 1 and 2. The combat sequences were believable in that it wasn't the usually moronic amateurs and actually had credible tactics, teamwork and realism. As a former Marine, I sometimes cringe when I see a bunch of yahoos running around with weapons not even aiming.  Was it full of cliches from past movies? Yes, but there's enough original stuff to keep you interested. Were there some plot holes? Of course, just like most non-epic sci fi movies. The characters may be cliched, but they still had decent to good acting.

I give this 3 Stars when compared to epic sci fi productions like Aliens, Avatar, Blade Runner, etc. But I give it 4 Stars for being very good for a straight to video production that is heads above SciFi Channel types of movies or cheap international ones.",1487635200,,1058,4.476683937823834

7622205,3,B01B6MMESG,"My over-arching emotion after having watched Kill Command was boredom.  I found myself checking the display at the bottom, to determine how much time was left to play.  Relevantly, I spent 4 years in the US Army Infantry, so my review is probably colored by that fact.

The movie is set in the near future, and follows a squad of soldiers, on a live-fire training exercise, on a remote island.  Robots are an integral part of everyday life in the movie's future reality, and things start to go wrong for the soldiers, when the robot-adversaries on the training mission start to display 'renegade' programming.

To be fair, there are positives and negatives, so I'll lay out all.

First, the positives.

(1)  This movie was a cut-above no-budget B-movie science fiction films.  A small attempt was made to develop a backstory to the characters.  At least 15 minutes was given to us, as an audience to watch the squad members, put through their paces, getting to the training island, and going through their first training exercise.  If you've ever watched a no-budget B-movie science fiction film, then you know that having a thoughtful, well-developed script is a luxury!  In Kill Command, we never get to know enough about any character to really care whether they live or die, but at least, after they've cracked a few idiosyncratic jokes, and said a few one-liners to identify which 'type' of stock character they are (the naive new guy, the tough African-American sergeant, etc), you understand the significance to the plot, as each one meets their fate.

(2)  Likewise, as at least some effort was made to develop the characters, at least some effort was made to immerse us in a believable sci-fi world.  There were at least some scenes, at the beginning of the movie, that set up the fact that robots were an integral part of military life, and that cyborgs--humans implanted with technology--were an unremarkable occurrence.  Nothing so sophisticated as, say, creating the world of Pandora, in Avatar, but the film makers have to be given some credit for attempting to set up a somewhat lived-in world.

(3)  Finally, on the plus-side, the CGI was pretty well done.  At least the close-in shots of the villain-robot invoked a sincere sense of dread, and menace.  The limited budget showed when the screenplay called for battle scenes with a 'host' of robots.  But, its' a movie, so let's give it points for trying.  Again, a better B-movie.

On the negative side:

(1)  I'll just get this out of the way, because I know it may be unique to myself, and other military veterans.  The tactical maneuvering of the soldiers is all Hollywood.  (For example, walking slowly down the center of a road, in broad daylight, instead of hiding behind trees).  So too is the portrayal of the soldiers.  (In Hollywood, there's always gotta be a naive-new-guy-who-just-arrived-innocently-from-some-place-in-the-Midwest, and a tough-as-nails, muscular, African-American sergeant, who talks really slowly and with a deep voice).

(2)  I also really had a problem with the male lead.  Googling, the actors' name is Thure Lindhardt, and he really has problems portraying a battle-hardened professional soldier.  Now, as I think about it, his squad gets eviscerated, he is constantly placed in mortal danger, and I don't think he ever even got motivated enough to raise his voice!!!!

(3)  It's really hard to see past the fact that this movie has been done many times before, much more successfully.  It borrows liberally from Aliens, Avatar, Predator, and others.  That being said, I think the film makers are aware of that, and they do try to place an original twist on the combat-sci fi movie.  There is tension in discovering exactly what the motives of the robot-villain are, and how the protagonist-cyborg (Vanessa Kirby) will fit in.  The routine training exercise that turns bad, serves as a good vehicle to carry the plot along.

My verdict:  a solid 3, a cut above the average B-movie.

My recommendation:  it's a good investment of your time, if you are a sci-fi fan, if the price is not too steep, and if you're not too bothered by actual military tactics.  :-)",1483660800,17,4160,4.915229885057471

If you liked the movies Predator, Aliens and other Sci-Fi movies you will like this one.  In my opinion; and this is surprising, the CGI rivals big budget films.  The CGI in some movies makes you feel a disconnection from the main characters and the computer generated cartoon creation they interact with, not in this movie.  I think the negative reviews of this movie are done by people who expect nothing less than Hollywood perfection.  There are a couple minor flaws in the movie but easily over looked, and one big flaw if you manage to see it. The story line is simplistic, no real character development and is a bit predictable. On the other hand every big budget movie you've seen is also predictable for the most part. There are not huge explosions, like a Michael Bay movie and I like this because the explosions seemed more real.  The acting done by a bunch of people you've never seen before is actually pretty top notch. The ending is a little cheesy but expected.  Why Four stars? It was very entertaining and suspenseful, and lastly the sound editor of this movie needs to be working for the big leagues.  I can't remember the last time I didn't have to turn down the sound from overpowering explosions or turn it up from mumbled dialog.",1483228800,23,1377,4.614754098360656
7622217,2,B01B6MMESG,"This is a by the numbers monster movie, with killer robots as the monster and a diverse and multiethnic unit of soldiers as the victims, a pinch of interpersonal tension, and lots of shooting.

The CGI is well done and used well, the setting is a back woods somewhere and is acceptable, if bland.  The plot itself is a bit basic, with limited characters and minimal focus on them or their motivations, and even less on the antagonists.

From a horror prospect, this won't scare many people.  From an action angle, the action is basic and limited.  From a sci-fi standpoint the film really doesn't delve into the various topics surrounding A.I., drone warfare, or the use of violence.

I would suggest if your curious to rent at best. There really isn't anything here deserving of multiple viewings.
This probably would have been a good blockbuster in the late 80's or early 90's, but by more modern standards it's a decent B level at best.",1483056000,,939,4.66060606060606

My bad; most of the data was there to opt for renting, but the CGI in the trailer sold me.  And the CGI was only so-so it turned out despite tons of it...TONS.  Meanwhile acting and writing was very spotty with many WTFs where the viewer just is given no explanation for why characters are suddenly somewhere else.  Lots of soldierly strutting and posing and tramping around, but no real connection with any of the personalities.  Ending was a doophus ending.  Way too much ""combat"" with everyone shooting and missing everyone.  Physics didn't add up.  Many bothers; spent most of the film as a critic instead of identifying with someone.  3 stars because I feel cheated -- with a better ending and a lot less combat and a lot more machine vs person communications, it could have earned another star.  The writer didn't come up with a very interesting personality for the heroine babe.

Been getting ""stung"" by several ""robot"" films in the last year or so.  They're coming up short in some major way.  Future me:  don't watch until after Aug 2017 and then fast forward through most of the beginning and half of the combat scenes.

A lot of the robots seemed like a clever, old-school type kitbashing of blue-light 21st Century parts and old military parts - cool!
