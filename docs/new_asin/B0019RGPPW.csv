You have to have a sense of HUMOR for this film! I  laugh so hard through this movie. Its about a Man who is gay and he turns his life around and decide he doesnt want to be gay anymore, but his mate is upset and all the ladies at Church start to like him and they start throwing there self at him, but the chick that he is intrested in doesnt buy it!! Then there is this lady in the film whos son is a drug dealer and he goes in the Chruch and shows out and start attacking people and I think he tryed to rob them! But Long story short, the man gets out of Jail and decide he wants revenge!! Like i said if you have a Sense of Humor- Buy it! If you don't like low budget films with ok actors- Dont buy it!!",1278892800,,908,3.7736842105263158

3443446,2,B0019RGPPW,"Um, I don't know where to start; so here it goes.

This video is very very (did I say very?) low budget. There was something about the quality of acting also. However, the cover of the video is very appealing!
The portrayal of the pastor in this movie is the same that millions experience in real-life today; however, the quality of the directing & the acting just didn't fit the bill.

*I did very well as I didn't want to use the word 'Ghetto' to describe this film as there is a large target audience that loves those types of movies*
- Just horrible - however, it's horribly funny parts in this film as well-",1230595200,,612,4.3130434782608695

8275102,4,B0019RGPPW,this was a very well written script.  no abrupt endings or undeveloped plot lines.  The actors are great and even better singers.  I really liked this film,1507420800,,155,4.666666666666667
8275103,1,B0019RGPPW,"It's a sorry film. Horrible quality. Cheap laughs at the expense of gay people. Demonstrates the unfortunate, but widespread prejudice against gays in the black community. Characters act as if gays have a disease. Just sad. God is love. This movie sure ain't showing any love.",1305936000,,276,5.021739130434782
8275104,5,B0019RGPPW,We loved it and we have watched it several times. It make you think and look at your life.,1282521600,,90,3.789473684210526
8275105,5,B0019RGPPW,"I thought that the movie was great. I did not look at the price that it may have cost to produce this picture; I look at the bigger picture. One Man Delivered from his sins and was called to do God's will and another getting hurt, forgiven and healed from his sins and that was a powerful message, it was kind of hard to miss it. When I watch a movie like this one, I'm looking for a message and sometimes it could be a message for you, that you miss because you are to busy looking at the smaller picture (what it cost to produce the picture) which causes us not to grow as Christians.",1279324800,,586,4.060344827586207
