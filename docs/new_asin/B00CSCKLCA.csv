Veggie Tales: All The Shows, Volume 2 includes the following shows: King George and the Ducky, Esther: The Girl Who Became Queen, Lyle the Kindly Viking, The Star of Christmas, The Ballad of Little Joe, An Easter Carol, A Snoodle's Tale, Sumo of the Opera, Duke and the Great Pie War, and Minnesota Cuke and the Search for Samson's Hairbrush. This set is great because it has 10 discs, each containing one episode and bonus features. In fact, these discs are exactly the same as the individual releases of the episodes. So if you don't already own them, this is definitely the way to go because it is priced cheap and takes up less shelf space. This is also a great set for older collectors because it contains everything from the original releases. I'd recommend this to any Veggie Tales fan!",1375315200,74,874,4.681818181818182

5737768,5,B00CSCKLCA,"Bought this for my daughter to watch on Sabbath; we will only watch movies based on bible stories.  She asks to watch them all the time! My only complaint is that since my mother in law is strict on what we can watch on Sabbath, she will only allow the movies that are specifically based on a bible story and only three of the ten movies do that. They all have great lessons but I would be nice if it listed what story the movie is based on so I don't have to argue over if the movie is Sabbath day appropriate.  But that's just a personal issue really.for every other day of the week, we watch them all and love them :-)",1404950400,,621,4.040650406504065
