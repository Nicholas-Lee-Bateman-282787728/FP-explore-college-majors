6567413,5,B00MBD5GNU,Love this film from Corbucci with a touch of comedy and especially Jack Palance as Curly. Terrific score by Morricone. Flawless,1444176000,,127,5.095238095238095
6567414,1,B00MBD5GNU,"This release of Sergio Corbucci's Companeros only contains the edited English cut of the film, which cuts nearly five minutes from the runtime. This isn't the standard removal of violent scenes; rather, this cut is missing the entire opening of the film, which establishes Tomas Milian's character of Vasco as the hero of the film, and explains his backstory. When viewing the English version, it makes it seem as though Franco Nero's character of Yodlaf is the main character, even though he is intended to be a foil for Vasco. For a company like Blue Underground, which has made a name for itself by presenting films from this era as their directors intended them, this is unforgivable, as it goes against all that they have previously stood for, and not even for reasons of ""taste"" and ""decency""; this is a butchered version of the film that has been butchered for the sole reason that it means the audience won't have to spend the first few minutes reading subtitles.

If we're willing to read subtitles during violent scenes for the sake of completion, then we'll certainly be willing to read them if they are present during scenes that are critical to the plot of the film.",1442275200,5,1179,4.751219512195122

6567416,5,B00MBD5GNU,"More disciplined than Il Mercenario and less heavy-handed than either Django or Il Grande Silenzio, here Corbucci strikes a perfect balance between the genre's textbook whacked-out theatrics and explosive political posturing, a feat that several Italian Western directors tried to accomplish (Sollima with Face to Face, Leone with Duck, You Sucker, and Damiani with Bullet for the General) but few succeeded at producing. Jack Palance's character ""John"" is perhaps the greatest villain in Spaghetti history and Morricone's score perfectly complements cinematographer's Alejandro Ulloa's vivid, sun-soaked visuals. But the majority of the kudos go to Corbucci, whose trademark messy directing shines here in all its delirious glory. 5/5 stars, recommended for any and all fans of Cult Cinema.",1433116800,4,791,5.769230769230769
6567417,3,B00MBD5GNU,"Also known as ""Vamos a matar, compaeros"", this Spaghetti western was directed by Sergio Corbucci in 1970. This western has an appropriate mix of a good story, shooting scenes, a few very funny moments. Thus, the overall mood of this movie is that of an adventure instead of greedy. The contrast is quite amazing if you check for The Great Silence and even Django, two other very good Corbucci films. On this film, both of our heroes (Franco Nero, Tomas Milian) play antihero characters in the middle of a politically messy Mxico at the time. The film is not that political though but a bit ethical or moral. Overall then, the film is entertaining, with nice shootings, good characters, a good example of a more ""positive mood"" spaghetti western (not a comedy though).

Ok, I gave three to this film based on the following. My top standard (5 stars) is Sergio Leone's trilogy, all starred by Clint Eastwood. So, this is a good, but not terribly good non Leone's Spaghetti western.

Technically, the Blu-Ray represents an improvement over the Anchor Bay DVD edition (which I own too). The disk comes with two versions of the film, the American that runs for 95 min and Italian version that touches the 120 min. I always go for the unedited versions so I watched the Italian version. This version comes mostly in English (except for a few scenes in Italian), with English subtitles. On the extras you have some nice interviews of Franco Nero, Tomas Milian, and Ennio Morricone. By the way, the main theme on the movie is just great, and clearly has to do with the original title of this film.",1416614400,10,1589,4.671428571428572
6567418,3,B00MBD5GNU,"Sergio Corbucci Western, so you know it'll be dull and hammy.  I didn't like his Django (1966) much either.",1410307200,2,107,4.631578947368421

8671388,4,B00MBD5GNU,"RELEASED IN 1970 and directed by Sergio Corbucci, Companeros chronicles events during the Mexican Revolution in the 1910s when a Swedish arms supplier (Franco Nero) and a Mexican radical (Tomas Milian) agree to an uneasy alliance in order to rescue the highbrow leader of the counter-revolution, Prof. Xandos (Fernando Rey), whos a prisoner in Texas. Unfortunately for them, a former business partner of the Swede puts a wrench in their plans (Jack Palance). Jos Bdalo plays revolutionary leader General Mongo while Iris Berben is on hand as the babe of the counter-revolution. Karin Schubert has a support role as a sultry prostitute.

In the wake of the surprising success of Sergio Leones The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) filmmakers in Europe and elsewhere tried to repeat the success using the same playbook. As such, Companeros is similar to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly with Nero basically in the Eastwood role, Milian in the Wallach part and Palance in the Van Cleef role (generally speaking). Add a catchy score by Ennio Morricone and  voil  you have a new version of that classic Italian Western.

These types of Spaghetti Westerns melded the hysterically overdone Italo grand opera with Spanish picaresque convention. A Spanish term, Picaro means ""rogue"" or ""rascal"", and the picaresque yarn is usually sardonic, featuring the misadventures of roguish protagonists of low stature who live by their wits in a crooked world; and told with realistic and humorous detail. Here Yodlaf Peterson (Nero) and Vasco (Milian) are the two picaros with Palance as the wooden-handed foil.

While you cant beat Morricones iconic score to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, I actually prefer this Western because it has better characters, a better story, WOMEN and superior mindfood. Concerning the latter, The Good had no depth or moral, unless you count lucre is the all and end all of life. Here there are serious deliberations on the rationalization for revolution and the justification (or not) of its proper or improper execution.

Those who favor picaresque Westerns (or stories in general) will appreciate Companeros more than me. I mostly don't like the occasional goofiness, but I can roll with it if I have to, which I did. Thankfully, the movies mostly quasi-realistic, akin to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Its well done for what it is with several highlights and novelties, including Marsha the hawk and some little turtles (youll see what I mean).

THE MOVIE RUNS 118 minutes and was shot in Almera & Madrid, Spain, and (studio) Rome. WRITER: Too many to cite.

8671389,5,B00MBD5GNU,"Top notch spaghetti western, stylish, good soundtrack, lots of action.  Not in the same class as the Leone westerns but as close as other Italian westerns are going to get.  Franco Nero is always a decent screen presence in this type of film, Thomas Milian is one of the better actors in this genre, and Jack Palance is..., well, he's freakin' Jack Palance.  Definetely in the Top 20 of Spaghetti Westerns.",1506470400,,406,4.690140845070423

8671393,1,B00MBD5GNU,"Possibly the greatest soundtrack devised by man, but the movie is bad even by spaghetti western standards.  The director experimented with ""innovative"" camera angles and camera zooms that either make no sense or are very goofy.  speaking of goofy, the movie has two ""songs"" in its soundtrack, one is amazing while the other is cartoony whistling.  The protagonists are capable of performing logic defying stunts when they are threatened.  did I mention that both characters cannot act and the supporting cast also could not act?  The best performance was delivered by a trained hawk who was flawless in delivering his lines.",1476144000,,624,5.138613861386139
