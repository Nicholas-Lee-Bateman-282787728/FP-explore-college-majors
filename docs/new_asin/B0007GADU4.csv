2211479,5,B0007GADU4,"Ive been a big fan of space ghost for a while now and these dvd's are awsome! And its a pretty reasonable deal. Now, if youve never seen the show, you might want to borrow the dvd from someone or watch something like aqua teen hunger force (as the same geniouses wrote both masterpieces) And even if you do remember liking it, you might want to buy just one. But for you hardcore fans, this is most DEFINATLEY the way to go",1119052800,8,423,4.170731707317073
2211480,5,B0007GADU4,I remember sneaking up late at night to watch this show as akid. It is funny now that I actually understand the jokes. GREAT BUY,1398470400,,128,4.16
2211481,4,B0007GADU4,"I loved this show back in the day, but it didn't really get good until AFTER these episodes. It's unfortunate that the rest of the series (volumes 4 and 5) are out of print and ridiculously rare and expensive.
I wonder why you can still find the first three volumes for less than $10 a piece...?",1395705600,2,295,4.285714285714286
2211482,5,B0007GADU4,Love space ghost and was so happy to find these. Very entertaining and enjoyed the guest stars.,1388016000,,95,4.647058823529412
2211483,5,B0007GADU4,"I purchased this as a gift for my daughter as I remember watching these episodes with both my two children. She is the youngest, who is now 18 years old. I haven't opened it yet however I can foresee us all sitting down & laughing away this up-coming Christmas 2013, as we did back in the day. I'm certain she (and us all) will enjoy it. Shipping time was as expected with no delays.",1385942400,,383,4.1891891891891895
2211484,5,B0007GADU4,"No need to bore you with a long review.  This is the funniest cartoon series what was ever made, and Space Ghost is the sexiest cartoon character ever created.  What else is there?",1383436800,,180,4.424242424242424
2211485,5,B0007GADU4,"A great tv show from when I was a kid. It can be kinda weird, but that's why  I  love it.",1375833600,,89,3.1904761904761907
2211486,5,B0007GADU4,Love Space Ghost!! This is a great collection to have. Have enjoyed it very much! Must have for Space Ghost fans!,1368662400,,113,4.428571428571429
2211487,5,B0007GADU4,I loved this tv show when it was on. It shipped very fast and was at my door in no time.,1355184000,,88,3.238095238095238
2211488,5,B0007GADU4,"I remember watching this show as a kid, and watching it now... well this show is super dirty! It's kinda really awesome!!",1306108800,,121,4.545454545454546
2211489,5,B0007GADU4,Item arrived quickly and was in new condition as specified. Would buy from this seller again.,1252627200,,93,4.875
2211490,5,B0007GADU4,"It can get pretty corny and slow at points, but overall, it's the voice acting that brings this show to life. Everyone is different, so I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, especially if you have low tolerance for indirect/pointless humor.

If you like Adult Swim, you will probably like this show, but only when your prefered adult swim shows are not on. Because compared to the other shows on Adult Swim, this one is OK.
I personally love it, but I have been a fan since I was 15.
I hardly run into people who've seen it, and the people I do meet who've seen it say they have seen it a few times, but have no opinion on it (the episodes run about 15 minutes each).

I am having trouble finding the rest of the seasons. There is suppose to be 8 I think.",1248998400,,756,4.206896551724138
2211491,5,B0007GADU4,"Been a fan for a while, but, never able to see all episodes. Glad I bought the full set, lots of good laughs. If you don't try to pick apart each one, I'm sure you'll enjoy them all.",1239494400,,182,3.8157894736842106
2211492,4,B0007GADU4,"I've been a fan of Space Ghost for years.  My wife purchased me the three season set for my birthday and I've enjoyed the viewing pleasure of the Slaptackular fun.
The down side is that the first season contained two of ""disk 2"" and I'm afraid I will never know how Space Ghost came to be.  Luck for everyone else, I may be the only person who has had this problem.",1216944000,,365,4.126760563380282
2211493,3,B0007GADU4,"I love Space Ghost Coast to Coast, but the best part about that show were the stupid crazy songs that Brak and Zorak sang.  I bought Vol 1-3 and they don't have these songs on them.  Not in special features either.  The series is presented chronologically, it seems, which means the first set is sort of awkward and not as funny as later episodes.  The second volume has a couple filler episodes and I just started Vol 3 and am sort of annoyed that there has been I think exactly 2 episodes with Brak in it.  I still laugh out loud at some of the episodes, it's good to own it, but be aware you will not get some of the best stuff.",1213142400,2,631,4.097560975609756
2211494,5,B0007GADU4,"I was wondering when I bought this if it was going to be something different than what they show.  Luckly, this is just volume 1-3 each in their own boxes like the pic.  If you love SGC2C get these 3 on this page, it's a great deal!",1208476800,6,232,3.9148936170212765
2211495,5,B0007GADU4,"All the awkward weirdness of the beginning of the series, with extras that include interviews with the cast and comments by the animators and writers.",1174780800,,150,5.04
2211496,3,B0007GADU4,"it was what I expected, but some of my favorite episodes were not included",1168387200,2,74,4.357142857142857
2211497,5,B0007GADU4,My husband absolutely LOVED this set!  He can't stop watching it.  The shipping was amazing!  I received it in 2 days!  It was still a 'pending' transaction on my bank account when I got it!  Space Ghost is so hilarious!  Now I just need to get him his other two favorite shows on dvd for him!  Thank You Amazon!,1150761600,2,312,4.186440677966102

8047142,5,B0007GADU4,"Take a ride on the nostalgia train!! My memories of this show are nothing but warm and fuzzy laughter, the sort that bubbles up when the babysitters let you stay up past midnight to watch that show that sometimes has naughty humor in it, but just ""don't tell mom""... over-hyper on sugar, not entirely sure what the plot of the episode is, but HEY, IT'S BRAK!!! Oh, that silly Brak. Too bad they killed his character when they gave him his own show, but we'll pretend that that didn't happen.

Anyway, if you're looking for some really dumb 90's humor that was HILARIOUS for its time (and for my age at said time), this is where to get it. This show was pure comedy gold. Looooooong before the ""lol so random"" was even a twinkle in the internet's eye, this show made every viewer feel like they were tripping on acid in cartoonland. It's just plain excellent. Still awesome.

Packaging was solid, discs were pristine, product came as promised, timely and in excellent condition. BUY THIS SHOW. It's awesome.",1418601600,3,1006,4.614525139664805
8047143,5,B0007GADU4,I love this show and there are a ton of episodes on these discs.  I'm glad I finally caved in and bought this.,1410825600,,110,3.782608695652174
8047144,5,B0007GADU4,"If you like this, you might be described as having a ""quirky"" sense of humor.  Take that as a euphemism.  What they really mean is that you're an intolerable weirdo.

I've never laughed as hard at absurdist humor.  It's incredibly well done, perfectly stilted, and awkwardly hilarious.  If you weren't lucky enough to be a young adult in the late '90s and missed this, absolutely order it and see if you're one of us.",1402531200,,417,4.581081081081081
