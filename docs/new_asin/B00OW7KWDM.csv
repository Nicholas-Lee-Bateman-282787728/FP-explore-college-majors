8685157,3,B00OW7KWDM,"Standard western fair with Willard Parker as the fair, good hearted doctor, an all around good guy loved by all, who on the verge of his wedding to beautiful Evelyn Keyes loses her to Ben Dembrow (Larry Parks) the good son of a evil family gang led by Edgar Buchanan.  Ben is arrested for being a Dembrow and tried.  Before the trial is over Ben decides to go bad and his family breaks him out.  Hannah chooses to run off and marry Ben.  The good doc has lost his clientele after defending Ben (who he had convinced the jury to rule not guilty) is preparing to leave town after a year when he receives a message from a pregnant Hannah that she needs help to get away from the gang.  The spurned good guy finishing last must come to the rescue.  Worth a watch for western fans.  Evelyn Keyes gets top billing.  How can these lower budgeted westerns be so much better than the small budgeted westerns of today?",1418947200,,908,4.331360946745562
