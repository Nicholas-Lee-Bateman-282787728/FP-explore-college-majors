8324544,5,6302711169,"I loved this program.  It showed many animals I had never seen before on any of the other ""nature"" type programs I have.  The program talkes about the special evolution that took place on Australia that resulted in some of the strangest animals on the planet.
The program would be perfect for any household or classroom where they want an overview of most of these most unusual animals.  Some of the segments are short, but not overly so.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Don't miss this one.  I loved it and so will you",1011916800,3,517,4.505376344086022
