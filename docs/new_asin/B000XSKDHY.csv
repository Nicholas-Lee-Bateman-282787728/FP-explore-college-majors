3005389,4,B000XSKDHY,"I had to stop and catch my breath during a couple of the cardio sections; the moves are no-nonsense and a bit repetitive.  There's intervals of jumping rope, plyometric leaps, lunges, and burpees (ugh).  I just wish that the instructor had suggested the option of using a moderate weight as an alternative to the medicine ball (rather than using nothing), and given the option of doing some of the moves more slowly.  To its credit, the workout does have a beginner and an intermediate modification - thank goodness - but a few more suggestions about modifying would have been helpful.  You also will need a stability ball, and that section is a nice challenge as well.  Just take it at your own pace.",1201564800,9,701,4.666666666666667
3005390,5,B000XSKDHY,"I like Cindy Whitmarsh, her workouts are effective and she is not annyoing like some aerobics instructors can be. I looked her up on Amazon and found she had done a few more dvds since releasing her 10 mintue solution dvd. The price was right under $6 so I decided to give it a try. The dvd is good for those of us who do not have a lot of time to exercise. There are cardio segments and then strength training segments. Strength exercises target the buns,legs, biceps,trieceps and abs. The cardio segments include jumping rope,shuffle squats, burpies and mountain climbers. There are modifications shown for intermedite and beginner fitness levels. Fitness equipment such as a medicine ball and jump rope are reccomended but not needed and modifcations are shown if you do not have the right equipment. I worked up a nice little sweat. I am an advanced exerciser so I will be using this dvd for light days and weekends when Im pressed for time and need an effective time saving workout.",1201305600,7,987,4.67816091954023

3005392,5,B000XSKDHY,This is a great exercise DVD.  It makes you sweat and it gives you great workout.  It is easy to follow and efficient.  I have been using it for 3 weeks and you can notice the difference.,1194998400,9,187,4.0

8229403,3,B000XSKDHY,"I bought this a while back and the first time I tried it, I couldn't do half the workouts at the non modified level. Well I tried it again today, I was able to do all, non modified, except no actual jump rope, carpet and ceiling fans and not throwing the ball in the air, 8 ft ceilings. I used a 6lb weighted ball. According to my heart rate monitor it got my heart rate up and I got to my heart rate reserve on some which for me now is 180s. It stayed in the 160 to 170s during the lower parts, like strength training, I'm happy for that. Reason for the 3 stars and not 5, it's boring to me, the weights sections should of been in more control, I did 8lb dumbbells on most of it and I had to go down to 5lbs because I thought I was going to injure my shoulder again. You do the same circuit over and over until you move to the next section. I'm used to cathe friedrich where she changes it up, you still do biceps but it's not the same exercise, and she also does like 3 counts up 1 down, etc. If I don't get to bored with it, I will do this workout when I want a shorter but intense workout, but i will use it for more cardio then strength training, until it gets to easy. It's about 41 mins long including warm up and cool down. Skip to 3 mins in for the workout.",1480291200,,1266,3.873076923076923
8229404,3,B000XSKDHY,"i really like cindy whitmarsh's workouts, but this one falls a bit short. Seems half of it shows ladies talking about their eating habits. I want a workout, not a ""talk show"".",1456272000,,175,4.5
8229405,2,B000XSKDHY,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

A pro that isn't really a pro is that the production quality of this company's DVD is better than the last one I watched (Fat Blasting Bootcamp.)  At least the audio was normal and the video was not blurry or oversaturated with red.  That said, I still thought this video was still awful since it played like a fitness informercial.  They should really separate that kind of thing out from the workout itself.

I usually like this instructor but she was a little peppier/smiley/talkative than usual and it was kind of getting to me.  I could probably tolerate more if I got a good workout but this one would probably be good for beginners working their way up.  It was too easy for me and I barely got into my target heart rate zone for a short time even for the tougher intervals.  The music was just soso and not used effectively to time the moves.

Companies should really put a target level on workout DVDs instead of things like ""ultra fat burning"" which is not really useful.",1303776000,2,1037,4.502673796791444
8229406,5,B000XSKDHY,"I'm an intermediate to advanced exerciser, and this video wiped me out.  It is very challenging and it hits the entire body.  Some reviewers complained about the sound/production quality of this DVD.  Cindy has redone it and now offers it in combination with her UltraFit book, which is also awesome.  You can find it in the shopping section of her website -- [...].  Cindy rocks!",1273276800,,380,4.7846153846153845
8229407,1,B000XSKDHY,"Everything is too fast in this video, especially the weightlifting segments. This type of speed just invites injuries. Workout is filmed outside in someone's backyard--don't really understand how you can translate a lot of these moves to an indoor setting--kind of impossible to jump rope on carpet and throw weighted medicine ball up into air when your ceilings are only 8 ft. high.",1209772800,2,383,5.095238095238095
8229408,1,B000XSKDHY,"I ordered two of Cindy Whidmarsh's DVDs produced by Natural Journeys after loving her 10 Minute Solution / Target Toning DVD (produced by another company). The quality (video and sound) of Natural Journeys products leaves a lot to be desired. They were so bad that I returned them to Caiman, explaining that the beginning of one of them was lopped off, and the other was so bad that I could hardly hear it. On the other hand, I use the 10 Minute Solution DVD nightly. It's absolutely wonderful. This is the first time I've overcome my sciatica in 30 years. I would recommend the 10 Minute Solution / Target Toning DVD -- and all of the 10 Minute Solution DVDs -- since the quality is far superior to anything I've seen so far (except The Firm; they're great too). But don't bother buying any of the Natural Journeys DVDs or you'll be disappointed.",1205798400,9,847,4.542483660130719

8229411,4,B000XSKDHY,"This is a tough video.  I consider myself an intermediate to intermediate/advanced exerciser and I do this video for a tougher workout.  There are modifications (easy and moderate)if needed.  The workout is designed as circuts.  The cardio includes lots of pliometrics, jumping rope, burpees, lunges, etc.  These alternate with bried toning sections using weights for upper body toning.",1202688000,,386,5.586206896551724
