6607930,5,B00N1W3WNG,This one I am buying . Yes I am a huge Nicole Conn fan but only thing I really see in common is a death in the end. Alice comes to visit her daughter and finds someone she can be herself with. Don't want to spoil movie will write more later. Rented first then bought VOD plus ordered the DVD very few movies do I do that out side of Nicole Conn's and Katherine Brooks.,1413676800,2,368,3.92

6607933,4,B00N1W3WNG,"I really liked the movie Tru Love, I gave it 4 stars out of 5. I would have given it 5 out of 5, but the movie reminds me to much of the movie A Perfect Ending. A Perfect Ending starring Barbara Niven (Rebecca) and Jessica Clark (Paris) had AMAZING on screen chemistry. Their sexual chemistry was off the chart. I would not be surprised, if they continued a relationship off screen as well, at some point.",1413072000,,405,4.2727272727272725

6607969,5,B00N1W3WNG,"Like another reviewer stated, this movie stays with you!  I would prefer more movies like this with the exception of the ending.  Maybe because I am an older woman and in my waning years.  I felt the acting was very good, the actors fit the characters and the entire movie  was tastefully done.  I can only slightly compare it to A Perfect Ending of which I also loved but Tru was a quality interpretation of an often iffy subject.  I will watch it again and laugh again and cry again.  Very satisfying entertainment.",1437436800,,517,4.494623655913978

Tru Love explodes the parameters of love, sweeping aside the constraints of age.  This film transforms innermost yearnings into deeply satisfying realizations.

6607983,1,B00N1W3WNG,"It was really bad.  We had to turn it off after 25 minutes.  The casting was horrible!  The main character was so unbelievable - first of all, that she was even a lesbian, and secondly that she was a 'player'.  They should have casted someone more like 'Shane' from L word.  That character needed to be attractive, exciting, interesting and she was none of it.  We just couldn't bear to watch it any longer.  Very disappointed we spent $3.99 for this.

The most impressive and entertaining factor in this film is the fact that the actresses are great.  The attracton between them the two women who fall in love seem sincere and genuine and the chemestry between them made me want to watch them forever.  The mother character is so charming, flirtacious and passionate I dare you not to fall in love with her too.
I do understand the frustration with the choice of endings here as it is too stereotypical if you know the history of lesbian novels and films but I still loved it!",1420934400,2,684,4.3700787401574805

It seems like the easy way out but then I'm not a writer.  I'm noticing some reviews comparing it to Perfect Ending.  The only similarities that come to my mind is the May to December romance and the death at the end that the characters in both movies knew was coming.  Other than that they are very different.  I personally like this movie much better than Perfect Ending.  I felt Perfect Ending tried too hard to be ""artsy"".

The movie storyline resembles Nicole Conn's ""A Perfect Ending"", however in its similarity, Tru Love is nowhere nearly as bad.  The story is lovely, the actresses are relaxed and living the part with honesty and ease, even the confused uptight daughter. The movie does end in a less happy way, but the whole package does not leave you angry, on the contrary, it leaves you with a warm heart amidst all the snow, and abject cold.

As another reviewer stated, this Canadian film is a lot like a Lifetime Movie Network story (not a complaint).  Same kind of cutesy tone and simplistic melodrama.  As for comparisons to Nicole Conn's A Perfect Ending... they did share a few major elements:  older/younger lead, similar tragedy, and one Don Juan type younger woman who merely ACTS like a whore.  End of similarities.  This one has more credible acting and is a much better story overall.  And the DVD cover isn't photoshopped to make the 60 yr old lead look 25, lol.  Best of all, the ending doesn't suck!!  But it is somewhat bittersweet.

Not bad. I actually enjoyed it.  But then I like cheesy melodramas lol.  However, there are piles of good lesbian stories floating about these days if you're familiar with lesfic- POSITIVE ones with 100% HAPPY endings!!!... I'm not really sure why any filmmakers would go with anything that would so easily draw even general comparisons to something else that recently came out (c'mon our movies are few and far between- comparing is inevitable).  In this regard, the lack of imagination and originality was disappointing for me.  Can ya blame me if I wanna see more original lesbian stories with truly happy, feel-good endings?!  Can we please leave 1952 already?? Sheesh.

It's about a 30something lesbian named Tru (played by Shauna MacDonald, who is also one of the directors). So Tru has some abandonment issues that cause her to be a commitment-phobe.  She lost her parents at the age of 12, and despite therapy, finds herself dumping woman after woman-- and being an insensitive ass in the process, I might add... I wondered what her appeal was, to be honest.  Frankly, I don't think Shauna MacDonald was the best choice to play Tru.  Along with women, she must have the same issue committing with jobs as she appears to be unemployed throughout the story.  hmm.  That's attractive.

When her ""straight"" friend's widowed mother gets chummy with her, they develop a connection that gets romantic.  Seems to help Tru tap into some mommy issues that block her from commitment.  Soon Tru finds herself entangled in a mother-daughter triangle of who knows what because these two don't really know what they are and seem confused by grief... though mommy approaches her bi-curiosity much more positively.

It's somewhere between a character study and a romance, but ultimately, didn't delve too deeply in either direction.  Had the romance been stronger, I might have seen the ending as more tragic. Though I thought the idea of this lesbian being attracted to people who would most likely abandon her an interesting one.  Because that's what commitment-phobes do... find people who won't stick around.

Meh.  I still enjoyed the ride.  It wasn't even as predictable as I thought it would be.  And I really appreciated that Tru had some character growth. It's probably the best thing about this film. Though if you wanna convince me a lead like Tru is gonna seriously attract/dump all those hot women... she should be MUCH MUCH HOTTER and maybe have a damn job, magical fingers, or SOMETHING interesting about her life.  I would imagine someone avoiding relationships would redirect all that unexpressed energy into something else.  Better script or better casting was needed where Tru was concerned.

There is hugging, kissing, and multiple instances of implied sex, but nothing graphic and no nudity.",1414540800,16,3421,4.9753086419753085

6608043,4,B00N1W3WNG,"I watched this because it has been compared to Nicole Conn's ""A Perfect Ending"".  Aside from the older woman falling in love with a younger one, I wouldn't place these two movies in the same category (but I'm a movie novice).  Tru Love is more like a life time movie.  There relationship starts off innocently and accidentally.  Tru was just helping her workaholic friend out by ""babysitting"" her friends mother.  Then, under the influence of good food, good conversation and other physical activities, things happen...",1413936000,4,519,5.0588235294117645
