5562969,5,B00B89WZG4,THE BRITISH ARE GREAT MYSTERY WRITERS.  IF LOVE PERIOD PIECES.  ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS.  CAN'T GET ENOUGH OFTHE ENGLISH.  JOHNNIE LYONS,1392336000,,134,5.55
5562970,4,B00B89WZG4,"This was good, it has several twists in the plot. At first I was a little miffed with the accused murderer, I thought, are you nuts, just tell them but if you remember all you've read and heard of the morals and ideas back in victorian times it makes sense. It has a good ending and that in itselfs says allot. Enjoyable.",1383868800,21,321,4.193548387096774
5562971,3,B00B89WZG4,"This is a decent movie if you like victorian mysteries,  The cast is decent and the story is decent.  I would recommend it to watch but not to buy",1378080000,27,146,4.0
5562972,4,B00B89WZG4,"I enjoy this period of English stories, especially mysteries. The story was a little weak, but I enjoyed it anyway.",1377734400,,115,4.8
5562973,2,B00B89WZG4,"Here it is Saturday night and I was hoping to sit down for 2 hours and be caught away in an exciting story set in the 19th century, but the attractive DVD cover promises more than I got. The story is choppy, hard to follow, edited strangely, and contains a boatload of characters introduced too soon so that you hardly have a chance to care about them as their problems unfold. Because it is set in Melbourne, Australia, 1886, people speak with an (not American) accent, so gee, subtitles would have been nice for the many lines delivered at low volume or too fast or when the horses are clopping noisily down cobblestone streets. Often I had to guess what the poor blokes were saying. Repeatedly my husband and I paused the DVD to confer on what was happening or what had been said that we missed.

I gave up early on the movie. It's just not a grabber. The delivery is amateurish and the plot lacks soul. Purchased this movie  at Costco today for about $12+. Sorry I wasted my money. I would have given it one star, but the costumes are nice, so it gets two.",1373673600,46,1060,4.348484848484849
5562974,5,B00B89WZG4,I enjoyed the DVD movie as always I'm a big fan of the movies from the British.  It was a good mystery,1373673600,2,102,3.6363636363636362
5562975,3,B00B89WZG4,"3 1/2 STARS --- BEGINS METHODICALLY AND BUILDS LATER ON.  FIRST HALF IS ONLY PART OF THE MYSTERY, SO HANG WITH IT

The tale opens with a drunken gentleman returning home for the evening who is helped into a horse drawn cab (Hansom Cab) by a younger man.  The young gentleman coming to his aid realizes after the fact that this drunk is his sleazy romantic rival.  The drunk man in the cab is later found murdered with an obvious implication against his younger rival.  The first part of the movie deals mainly with solving the murder mystery and seems a bit slow.  However, this is not the ultimate mystery.  Several more riddles will be introduced with engaging outcomes.  At the center is Madge, the love interest of the accused and heiress to a powerful father.  What is her father's secret?  What could it have to do with the charming and innocent Madge? How far would the young, self made, Irish man go to protect Madge from his sleazy rival?

Hang with this movie and it will reward you.  The filming isn't as polished as some period dramas we are used to.  However, it is certainly on a par with, or better than, older BBC productions.  This film is more recent so I mentioned that just for comparison. I found it a nice change for an Australian entry into the genre.  The acting is very well done and the actress who plays Madge is wonderful.  Rent it or pick it up cheap.",1366070400,80,1380,4.416666666666667
