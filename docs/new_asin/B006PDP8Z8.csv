5012456,5,B006PDP8Z8,"@SuicideRoom aka Sala Samobjcw is one of my favourite films. Ive watched it too many times to count. I was VERY happy when I saw that it was finally released in the US/CANADA. This film is not only visually stunning, but the message is VERY powerful. Made even more so by the amazing acting of Jakub Gierzal. This film deserves every single award its won, and any more it wins in the future. I think not only teens, but adults alike should view this film. Maybe its message would rub off in a positive way. Either way, I highly recommend this film. Its fantastic and REALLY stays with you long after the credits roll.",1349481600,9,617,4.421052631578948
5012457,2,B006PDP8Z8,"This is a very slickly produced, very pretentious, heavy-handed and plodding movie that presumes to be about teen suicide... or something - I'm really not sure what it was supposed to be. Maybe you have to be heavily into video games and Japanese cartoons - or a suicidal teenager - to appreciate it. All the technological glitz to me was just a huge, actually an insurmountable distraction. I tried to pick out what was happening to Dominik through all that crap, but it was hard work.

Evidently he was a rich, spoiled, whiny, self-centered baby in a man's body, throwing fits in public whenever he felt put upon. That's what most of us are like at that age: some get over it and grow up, some get older but never grow up, and evidently some go off into a weird techno-nightmare and either stay there or kill themselves.

The movie has a note at the beginning giving a hotline number for suicidal teens to call - if this movie brings comfort to any suffering kids, thank God for it; but as a movie, as entertainment, it's a plodding, heavy, glitzy, pretentious failure.",1349308800,2,1071,4.572916666666667
5012458,4,B006PDP8Z8,"First, this movie is spoken in Polish, so subtitles are important and done very well.  In a world where how others treat a young man, who comes to the realization he is gay, badly, he retreats into his bedroom and goes online to a social network site.  This is a place which has the Suicide Room where others go to interact with their pain and how to deal with it.  The mix of actors and the use of animation substitutes online is amazing.  The story line tells a lot about society from the parents (to busy)to school friends(judgmental) and online friends(using him)in the world today.  This is a movie well worth watching.",1333152000,7,624,4.535714285714286

5012465,4,B006PDP8Z8,It is a good movie that shows how much teenage peers can affect another teenager.,1420416000,,81,4.466666666666667
5012466,5,B006PDP8Z8,Loved it.,1419638400,,9,4.0
5012467,2,B006PDP8Z8,"This Polish-language film concerns Dominik, an alienated teenage boy with anger-control issues who becomes fascinated with death as well as with a woman, Sylwia, he meets online who belongs to a group called Suicide Room. The reason the writer-director gives for the boy's alienation is that he is allegedly gay, which in this film, is mainly a plot device to explain his cutting himself off from his school peers and to progress his online relationship with the young woman forward. The writer-director is clueless as to what a suicidal gay teen is actually like and the so-called gay elements of his personality are dropped  pretty quickly once they serve their function. Of more interest are the parents who on one hand have spoiled their son but on the other have been distant and uninvolved in his life. They attempt to change their behavior following his initial suicide attempt, but he rejects their advances.  The movie also includes some excellent animation.",1419206400,,967,5.0375
5012468,5,B006PDP8Z8,Excellent movie!! It will definitely make you cry and feel for the main male character. The characters and plot are so realistic that you can't help but be in shock and aw that you think bullying can't be this real but as the movie goes on you start to think that yes...yes it can be that real and it affects a lot of people.,1418083200,2,325,4.09375
5012469,5,B006PDP8Z8,"My boyfriend loves this movie and i really like it.
Came fast and wrapped and everything!",1407369600,,89,4.625
5012470,5,B006PDP8Z8,Loved the movie!! It was sad and lovey all at once. I really enjoyed it and glad i bought it.,1401840000,,93,3.7
5012471,4,B006PDP8Z8,I just got done watching this movie and yes it is in polish with english subtitles. This movie really riddled its way into my heart. I honestly thought it was just going to be another movie about bullying and the effects of it being self harm or suicide but this went even further in a way  I can't really describe. This movie stands out from the rest and isn't as cliche throughout it or with the ending.,1400803200,3,405,4.259740259740259
5012472,5,B006PDP8Z8,"Love this movie. It is in Czech or Polish, so be prepared to read subtitles. They don't scroll to fast so you can't read them. Strikingly beautiful images and a heart wrenching story.",1392076800,9,183,4.575757575757576
5012473,5,B006PDP8Z8,"I have this thing for movies that just completely rip your soul out. I watched this on a night I had planned to watch several movies. However when the film ended I found myself unable to move on to any other movies that night. Jakub Gierszal's performance is heart wrenchingly believeable. It really feels like you are watching someone's downward spiral.

I would like to add that if you are easily triggered you probably shouldn't watch this film.",1391126400,10,448,4.743589743589744
5012474,5,B006PDP8Z8,:D i had been wanting to get this movie for so long and i was finally able to get it thanks to amazon. The dvd arrived before the scheduled date and there were no scratches or any damage to the case. 5 stars,1382832000,,207,3.8372093023255816
5012475,5,B006PDP8Z8,"This is such an amazing movie. The only not so great thing about it is that I don't speak, or understand, Polish. Overall it's a beautiful movie that brings tears to my eyes every time I watch it.",1371772800,3,196,4.184210526315789
5012476,5,B006PDP8Z8,"u might think that its poorly acted but in actuality theres a reason 4 it (ex: when roma was ""poorly"" crying in the field is only cuz she never has cried before)...not against gays but i won't judge...but i looked into the meaning of this amazing movie instead of its gay shots and was NOT at all disappointed... although i sure wish it was alittle more depressing but it was realistic and heart breaking and brought a tear 2 my eye witch i can watch pure cruelty and not be phased!",1365465600,,482,4.3076923076923075
5012477,5,B006PDP8Z8,"I thought the movie was great! It really opens up peoples eyes and shows them that just because someone is rich or looks happy doesn't mean they always are.
The only thing i didn't really like was the Silvia character, it seemed she only acted the way she did for attention.",1364515200,,274,4.392156862745098
5012478,5,B006PDP8Z8,This movie was over the top. It clearly deserved all of its praise from the critics. The product I got from the amazon site was in perfect working condition. I would gladly be a returning customer.,1354665600,4,197,4.5

8502723,5,B006PDP8Z8,I've not watched it as I bought it as a gift. My brother has been searching for this all over the place. It's one of his fave movies. He loves it and was glad to finally get a copy.,1508112000,,181,3.6666666666666665

8502725,5,B006PDP8Z8,"Good movie. But the whole story isn't about him being gay, so I don't understand how the beginning before the movie plays a part in it. He was ""gay"" for literally 3-5 minutes of the movie.",1487030400,,188,4.25
8502726,5,B006PDP8Z8,Besides this being my favorite movie it came on time and I'm very pleased with it,1484179200,,81,4.125
8502727,5,B006PDP8Z8,"This is my favorite movie. I love the acting, Polish is such a beautiful language, the music score is great, like I could go on. It's definitely emotionally and can be triggering, so be careful. But I love this movie, I love the world the game has. I like main characters, I can relate to the struggle with parents and identity. Like this is just a beautiful movie, that's best watched in the dark.",1467331200,,398,4.391891891891892
8502728,5,B006PDP8Z8,Very sad movie so if you don't like sad movies don't get it. I LOVE sad movies so I give this movie 5 stars. :D,1453939200,,111,3.48
