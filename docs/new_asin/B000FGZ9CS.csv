8122466,5,B000FGZ9CS,"I was in Italy when this movie was debuted at cinemas!  I saw the movie even though I understand only a little Italian.  The scenery was beautiful and the premise of the movie was not too hard to follow, despite the language issues!  My DVD player was de-coded and now accepts all regions of DVD's.  I have recently purchased this DVD and look forward to seeing the sights of Santorini all over again and the memories it will bring back to me.  I wish this movie would be offered to all regions- especially those in region ONE.  Americans would LOVE this move as much as I do!",1236124800,,576,4.336448598130841
