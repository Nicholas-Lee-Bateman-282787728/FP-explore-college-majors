122061,4,0792151712,"While it is hard to say that this was the best picture of last year (it truly wasn't) it still deserves the strong praise it received.
Not since Atlanta was burned in Gone With the Wind has  Hollywood produced a movie that is great epic spectacle. It is a  reminder of what a great epic, diaster movie should be in comparison  to the awful, trite, ""movies"" Hollywood has shelled out over  the last couple years; Godzilla, Independence Day, etc.
Despite  that Titantic is plagued with awful dialouge (most of it given to  Leonardo DiCaprio- word to Leo- want an Oscar nomination demand better  lines like your co-stars Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart), over-acting  (Billy Zane- an actor who hasn't found a role to show what kind of  actor he probably is- shouldn't be blamed; James Cameron should), and  its overabundance of chees (ok I cried at the end to, but c'mon  on). Also, this movie did not deserve Best Picture or Best  Director. L.A. Confidential did. However, Titanic get! s a second  place in my book for a sprawling incredible dipiction of the greatest  disaster of all time.  END",902707200,3,1092,4.703703703703703
122062,5,0792151712,"The plot of this ""drama on the high seas"" is excelent. The only drawback is the dialogue. Often, it is simple and not very exciting. The dialogue of the character of Rose, for example, usually does not go more than 15 words without the utterance of her (in the eyes of her mother) unfit companion, Jack.  Many say ""if you want to see a great movie, walk into Titanic an hour late."" I find this to be erroneous. Even though the dialogue is a bit slow sometimes, i still enjoyed Titanic, and will continue to enjoy it. As I said, Titanic is an excellent movie.  Best in a theatre, but probably very good at home also.  END",902361600,,620,4.282051282051282
122063,5,0792151712,"Hollywood doesn't make films like this anymore.  With the two-hundred million+ budget of ""Titanic"", one can see why.  If moviemaking has reached the point where economics can restrain a vision, then we have a creative tragedy of near-Titanic proportions.
In ""Titanic"", James Cameron puts that two-hundred million on the screen.  Every costume, every set, and every prop were carefully designed to meet Cameron's exacting standards of historical representation.  The ship itself, whether sailing or sinking, is a testament to the power of the epic film that Cecil B. DeMille and David Lean would appreciate.
The general public has always wanted the element of realism in their fantasy.  It didn't matter that Charleton Heston wasn't Jewish as long as the clothes were right, the buildings had columns and he rode a chariot in ""Ben Hur"".  Likewise today, ""Saving Private Ryan"" has been hailed for its realism and has raised the bar for future war films.  People don't mind the story, as long as it seems real to them.
This illusion is an art, and James Cameron is one of its masters.  Cleverly starting the film in the present, he is able to build anticipation for the return to 1912 while seemlessly convincing us that Rose DeWitt Bukater and Jack Dawson were as real to the world as Molly Brown or J.J. Astor.  Perhaps most of all, Cameron accomplishes a great feat by making the audience painfully aware of the human tragedy while at the same time amazing them with the spectacle of the ship's demise.
Although there are weaknesses in the script, the sheer magnitute of the film keeps the story captivating while the actors bring the passengers and crew to life.  Much has been spoken about Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, but the true backbone of the film are the supporting characters  whose presence evokes the wide range of emotions needed for a viewer to invest in the plot.  Whether watching ""Titanic"" again or for the first time, take special note of Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, Francis Fisher as Rose's mother and especially Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews.
Hollywood doesn't make them like this anymore, but they should.  ""Titanic"" is one film that should sail into your collection and stay there.",902275200,7,2211,4.911290322580645

I'm pretty particular in what I feel is an ""excellent"" movie - this one takes the cake on all fronts.......the true factor (my grandmother knew someone on the Titanic, a survivor along with her children and husband), the drama and plot, the storyline and how it was portrayed, was off the charts, as was the excitement/drama and romance.

122117,3,0792151712,I had my doubts about this movie when it first came out.  I waited and saw it at the dollar movie.  It turned out to be a lot better then I thought it would be. It's more of a love story then anything else.  And the movie is longer then the actual sinking of the real Titanic.  Leonardo and Kate are wonderful.  It won trillions of awards and it doesn't feel like it's over three hours long.  I think it's a little over rated.  But it's pretty good.,1522713600,,449,4.034090909090909

What can I say?! A timeless classic remastered for 3D viewing makes the experience of watching this movie THAT much more immersive. Crisp, vibrant picture and at a fair price which is well worth it. The only downside is that the movie is divided into two discs - but a minor downside in all which you receive - which is an invitation for a little over 3 hours worth of feeling like you're actually experiencing a love story and tragedy of your own.

I never had the liberty of seeing this movie in theater on a big screen but watched it promptly when it was released on VHS, then moving up to DVD and now the fantastic quality provided on Blu-Ray (and in 3D as well). I lost touch for years of how truly powerful this movie and story were until I stumbled across it on Netflix a little over a month ago. Ive watched it thrice more since then.

I cannot help but blame Jack Dawson for my unrealistic expectations in men. ",1515196800,2,1069,4.35678391959799
122281,5,0792151712,"Titanic is one of the greatest love stories wrapped around an incredible historical event ever produced.  James Cameron has an amazing way with actors and his direction along with the chemistry between Winslet and DiCaprio make this a classic that never fails to engage the viewer emotionally, even after several screenings.  A great supporting cast like Billy Zane, David Warner and Kathy Bates only make the story more powerful.  What resonates the most for me, and why I suspect its popularity has only increased with time, is the story of self sacrifice that Jack so wonderfully embodies from, ""I'm too involved now, you jump, I jump"" at the start  until he puts Rose on the driftwood to close the drama.  This is the true meaning of unconditional love.  Putting another's welfare before your own, even to the death is a message that hits home every time with both men and women, various ethnic groups and religions as well.  Mr. Cameron and his entire cast and crew should be exceedingly proud to have made a film with a simple message, appealing to a mass audience, and without a trace of campiness, done perfectly.

It was a stupendous production for the year 1997 and it remains just such a stupendous production.  It has become and will remain a classic.

122449,5,0792151712,"Epic story, touching romance, moving music.

I find three noteworthy aspects of the titanic story:
1. The technological achievement of building Titanic over 100 years ago
2. The hubris in their accomplishment that brought them to ruin
3. What impresses me most was the nobility and heroism of the men on Titanic.  The most vulnerable of the passengers - women and children - had significantly higher survival rates than the men.  Both women in third class and children in third class had higher survival rates than men of every group, including first class and crew.  It wasn't a free-for-all.  It was an event of epic European heroism and chivalry.",1504483200,2,649,4.91743119266055

I wasn't disappointed and with Cameron at the helm I knew I would not be , yes my flat screen is 3d capable and yes this one fills my screen.  The early scenes of underwater exploration had the debris floating into your living room and when Dawson was playing poker for the tickets they appeared to be in my living room too.  You get a feeling of being even more involved with the 3d version.  It cost me about $20 bucks and to me it was well worth it as an upgrade to what I had.

I've spent over an hour...iTunes doesn't make it easy to even FIND the place to redeem, then, finally, it goes to ""you must read and agree to terms and conditions"" before it will download.  Good luck finding where that is.  So, the PERCEIVED VALUE of getting the BUNDLE with a digital copy isn't there.  I should return it, but I'll probably enjoy the movie, once again, and special features.  For now, beware if you bought it (as I did) so you could ALSO get the digital download (which, by the way, I GREATLY prefer to watch on Vudu, NOT...EVER...through iTunes).

Leonardo DiCaprio stars alongside of Kate Winslet as two people ""from different worlds"" that fall in love under less than desirable circumstances. The Titanic was built to withstand anything...so they thought. NEVER...EVER...say something to the effect of ""not even GOD could sink this ship"" which is an actual historic quote. BAD...mistake. An iceberg and trouble in the engine room proved that GOD has ways of earning respect. Or nature, if you do not believe in GOD.

The historic marvel that it was during its maiden transatlantic voyage in 1911 to its unfortunate sinking due to an iceberg on April 15, 1912 that still fascinates history buffs and the curious. Hollywood further continued and ehanced the interest and mysticism of the event with impeccable cinematography and special effects that recreated the glory of what the ship looked like more than a century ago in all of its elegance and glory as well its ultimate demise, deterioration and untiring efforts of preservation.  In spite of, the RMS Titanic will never be forgotten, nor will the film with its all-star and award-winning cast (Leonardo De Caprio and Kate Winslet) and crew that made it possible.

122648,5,0792151712,"I'm a 19 year old dude and this is one of my favorite films of all time, having really affected who I am.  Always been a history buff, and since I was a little kid I'd been fascinated by the story of the Titanic.  When I first watched this film, I meant to watch it for the historical aspect, and planned to disregard the love story aspect because ""that's for girls."" Well, I was quite mistaken.  the story and characters are excellent, and I sorta looked up to Jack as the kind of guy I wanted to be, just an all around good guy who treats everyone fairly and will do whatever it takes to protect those who need it.  Using this excellently constructed character as one of my role models, I've grown from a depressed young boy with a negative outlook on life to a much more positive, happier young man pursuing a military career at a great school.  Moral of the story is, ""Make each day count"" and I thank all who were involved in the making of this film for helping bring that message to me.  If you haven't watched this movie yet, you really should.  I never would've guessed spending that $19.99 would change me as a person.",1492128000,133,1127,4.287735849056604

122697,1,0792151712,"In typical female version, Kate is very selfish and not really aware of anyone's feelings around her. Though he be a large turd of a human, she was willing to openly cheat on and embarrass her fianc&eacute;e Cal. Let us not forget that the over sized emotional bag of ovary (aka Kate) jumped off the dang lifeboat so she could later selfishly steal a door from Jack and allow him to freeze to death. ""I'll never let you go,"" she states, as she lets him go - sinking into the frozen abyss also known as the Atlantic Ocean. If that wasn't enough she allowed her cold witchy mother to believe she had died during the sinking... ok well maybe I agree with her on that one... As an old wrinkly tuna fish smelling woman (trust me, she smelled like tuna) she miraculously still had the heart of the ocean!!! Wow, she couldn't save the love of her life but she managed to keep track of jewelry? Ah ok, we know what was REALLY important! (Let us not forget Jack's ""best girl"" Cora also died... I have no doubt Kate had something to do with that as well. She's vile.)

In the end the selfish old bitty died warm in her bed and then in a moment of pure bliss was reunited on the Titanic with all of the poor souls who froze to death while the over privileged brat stole a door from everyone's favorite artist, Jack. Did he even know she let him go after he froze to death? I bet he didn't know, he wouldn't have kissed her corpse had he known.

Either way, Britney Spears was able to take full advantage and slip a quirky monologue into one of her songs about dropping it into the ocean at the end. GD it Britney Spears, at least say ""spoiler alert"" first.",1489104000,,1645,4.252396166134186

There are some fantastic Special Features on here that are not only on THIS SET, but they are NOT on the Anniversary Bluray HD Remastered Set that came out in 2012.

** The 3rd DVD in THIS SET has some fantastic features NOT on any Bluray 2012 Anniversary sets**

What I did, personally, is I got the NEW 2012 Anniversary Bluray 3D set, added the two standard blurays to this beautiful box set, kept the 3rd DVD with a huge amount of special features. and wallaa, I got the EPITOME of a DELUXE SET. There is NO COMPARISON to the DVD movies in this set, (which are split on two DVDs), versus the BLURAY EDITIONs of 2012.
I do recommend getting this set for the packaging, which is just beautiful and the 3rd DVD of Special Features. I would look around for a great deal though, so you don't have to pay the huge price online is asking for this 2005 THX set.
I got a good deal at a used DVD/BOOKSTORE for far less and the quality of the set was near mint condition. So, the deals are out there if you really want this set.
I took a few pictures of this set and what I did, so that you can do the same. It is magnificent!  I have the best set available. This packaging is wonderful, far better than that of any standard DVD release or the standard BLURAY releases.

122717,5,0792151712,"Jack, a lowbrow gambler, and Rose, an upscale socialite who dislikes her situation, come across each other in the cavernous belly of the Titanic, the world's greatest luxury liner.  What follows is an epic romance with all the twists and turns that such an affair can have on board the doomed vessel.  This is not the greatest story ever told but it may well be the most elegant and most subtly erotic.  Historians take the wrecking ball to this film as it largely ignores the plight of the underclass when the ship sinks.  And, yes, they have a point - but this never pretended to be an historical account.  It falls in the ""true love"" category and, like ""Gone with the Wind"", facts don't stick well.  What is assured is a grand epic, romantic and/or otherwise, and I still love this film long after I've read the historical accounts.  The acting is razor-sharp (except for Bill Pullman's character who is underwritten), the story is compelling, the directing is on-point and all the horror that befalls the poor steamer and its occupants is done in grand manner.  It's somewhat painful to see this classic so underrated but, well, taste is overrated in its own degree.",1487808000,,1170,4.700980392156863

122731,5,0792151712,"Bloated spectacle movie from James Cameron in which the central romance between Leonardo DiCaprio's poor artist and Kate Winslet's society girl is overwhelmed by the monumental recreation of the historical disaster. The Oscar giant-killer critics love to hate, probably because Titanic has the distinction of being one of the few Best Picture winners not to include any acting or screenplay awards among its tally.
You don't like Winslet. You don't care about DiCaprio. You are grimly aware of every hyper-efficient emotional trigger and fast-forward through whole tranches of bad acting and writing.

Titanic has got to be one of THE BEST movies ever made! And how can it be improved upon? Being able to watch it in 3D!! I have to say If you have a 3D TV and you like this movie and have not watched it in 3D yet, then you have to get it in 3D and experience it again! James Cameron's remake in 3D has gone above my expectations. Some of the scenes have really come to life and have pulled me into the storyline further than it's 2D counterpart. I have alway's loved this movie, but now in 3D I have fallen in love all over again. I have over 30 3D titles and this is by far one of, if not THE BEST I have! A superb job was done on the 2D to 3D remastering of this title. It does not feel cheesy or appear to be a 3D remake at all. Some remakes in 3D are done poorly, this is NOT one of them. Buy it and see for yourself, you won't regret it!",1481068800,7,1065,3.7757847533632285

122870,5,0792151712,"This is a great movie as its impressive plots. Titanic enriches us with a romantic story of young love, passion and feelings, full of utopias and dreams, mother and child fighting for power and greed, idealistic and self-identified clashes within a consenting human ambitions society and victims of their own vanity and arrogance. This is one of the films that keep classic impression to the general public for so many years. The huge collections those are logical because they got obvious that Titanic has one of those stories full of strength and feeling, with great dramatic content. If we add the stunning beauty of the image, thanks to advances in digital technology, success is understandable. It is a very successful movie, which tells the story of the sinking of the ship, but in the background shows a passionate love story. It achieves a harmonious balance in that, in the mix of history and feelings, and makes it almost perfect.",1479600000,,940,4.918238993710692

122947,5,0792151712,"There are movies that are considered ""staples"" in any romantic's movie collection: The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, The Fault in Our Stars, and, of course,Titanic. For starters, the opening of Titanic almost gives us a sense of ""false hope,"" showing pictures of boarding passengers, people waving loved ones goodbye, and excitement flowing through the air as the ship prepares to head for America, while playing a very mournful theme alongside it. Skipping toabout one hundred years later, aman's search for a valuable necklace on thesunken shipleads him to discover a woman named Rose,with a remarkable connection to the necklace and Titanic.
The movieproceeds to go back in time. WhenRose, the ""well bred, oppressed lady""meets Jack,the ""penniless free spirited artist"" they have an immediate attraction blossoming to a passionate love affair. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have wonderful chemistry and work very well together. DiCaprios performance as Jack Dawson is very impressive, as his natural confident and brash demeanor makes him a very fitting choice for a poor man going where ever the wind takes him, in contrast to his love interest. Kate Winslets natural grace and elegance, with a dash of sassiness and independence, makes her a perfect fit for a first class lady and an excellent opposite to DiCaprios character.
The music of the movie is a huge part of why this movie is such a big success, with powerful melodies that flow through the characters' interactions and really help withthe dramatic scenes, while boosting the ship's ""predicted"" success. For example, the first part of the movie shows a very majestic and upbeat soundtrackthat is still being listened to today, while producing a very tear-jerking theme to play for in the aftermath. You almost believe this tragic moment in history happened only a few years ago and were still recovering from this tragedy.
The costumes are so detailed and elegant, its truly stunning. Elaborating more, there are clearly drawnlines between first, second, and third class passengers. For example, the first class passengers tend to wear more white,tight outfitsthat symbolizes their wealth and more refined taste, while the third class passengers are often seen in brown or dirty, loose fitting clothes as it symbolizes they have lower income and need to work.
Memorable and compelling lines make us fall so in love with the movie such as thefamous lines like""I'm the king of the world!"" and ""ICEBERG RIGHT AHEAD!""thatstill sends shivers down our spines. The accents and tones from the characters are also very amusing. For example, the old money on the ship talk with very snooty and dignified accents, while characters like Jack and Molly Brown (whose character is seen as new money) have more relaxed tones and tend to lead more towards sarcasm.
During the ships sinking, the effects were surprisingly very authentic and gives viewers a genuine fear for the characters lives, with not knowing who lives or dies. As one major ending plot twist is so subtly slipped in, it gives you a brief shock for a moment, followed by a rush of emotion. You feel almost as if you're grieving for the loss of a family member. This is what makes this movie so unique and compelling, as it steps outside of the normal happy ending. With director James Cameron leading at the helm, it's no wonder Titanicis such an instant classic that it still admired and loved today by all audiences.",1475539200,,3439,5.056338028169014

123006,1,0792151712,"Many viewers are concerned with the nudity in this movie. I agree the immorality is a problem and the movie should have got a different rating. But my reasons for not liking this movie have to do with the whole story, not just a section of it. Very cheesy and over the top, with historical inaccuracy that's so bad you feel like laughing out loud, and terrible national stereotyping.
I will in fairness point out that the costumes and sets are gorgeous and the tragedy at the end never stops scaring you. Every time you watch it. James Cameron did a good job directing this part.
As a movie about the Titanic, it's only good at the end. As a movie about people, it needed a lot of work. As a love story... well, if you like Leonardo di Caprio, it will work for you. If you're not, then you will honestly not relate to a society lady falling madly in love with a drifter who spends all his time drawing naked women.",1473552000,,914,4.289017341040463

The way James Cameron moves from the young Rose's character to the older Rose's character is done beautifully. He gives the viewers a romantic story to follow while telling the tragic and true tale of the sinking of The Titanic.

123265,4,0792151712,"Without question, Titanic remains one of the most well-received films in movie history. When it first hit the big screen, moviegoers were filled with awe at the massive project to bring Titanic to life - a feat that could only be undertaken by James Cameron. Titanic was the movie of the decade - the must-see of the mid-nineties. Unfortunately, it yielded one of the cheesiest performances by an actor in a lead role, that of Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson. The ""I'm the king of the world"" moment still gets laughs and spoofs to this day.

If you were a man of dating age when Titanic came into theaters, then you definitely brought a date or your steady girl to see Titanic.

If you broke-up with the girl you took to see Titanic or if you caught them cheating on you, then you probably never wanted to see Titanic ever again...

But, then you got married, and your wife like Titanic; she watches it over, and over, and over.

Nuff said.

Perhaps the best attribute for cinema fans is Cameron's authenticity and attentive representation of the RMS Titanic and its fateful end. I've seen numerous documentaries about the doomed ship, and Cameron is the only feature film guy to come close to an authentic Titanic docu-drama, period.",1463443200,,1235,4.6728110599078345

123271,5,0792151712,"Great movie, Kate Winslet is Absolutely Stunning as a redhead in her old time dark red ball gown. Couple of holes in the plot however. Rose, (Kate Winslet,) complains about having a rich mom and living an extravagant life when later we find out that the mom Isn't rich. Furthermore, her mom which now we know is poor wants to ""Pimp"" her daughter out to the rich guy. Secondly when Rose first seen the Titanic at 101 years old she marvels at it, calling it the "" ship of dreams."" Then later on when the movie progresses and  Rose is recollecting her story of hows she's young and she boards the Titanic, she refers to it as a ""Ship of slaves."" Well which is it??!!! Ship of dreams or ship of slaves?!!!! Other than that , great movie!!! One other tidbit, it shows Rich people being Utterly boring , having nothing worthwhile to say and poor people being the life of the party, which just seems wrong. Just cause a person is rich doesn't mean their Automatically a Bore, just cause some is poor doesn't make them raucous, and the life of the party.",1463097600,2,1046,4.391752577319588

Bought it instantly on Amazon Prime and he loved it. We have already watched it several more times. He knew the names of the people from the book that he was reading, so that's how well these roles were cast. It was hard to explain who Jack and Rose were, since they are fictional, but the movie is so steeped in genuine history that my history-buff son was enthralled. As I cried in the kitchen.

1. While the picture is great, it's not in the movie's original aspect ratio. This would be fine if it A. Didn't cut out that much stuff and B. The original aspect ratio didn't fit my monitor perfectly, but it does
2. The digital copy is only available for redemption on iTunes. I am an android user and iTunes does not work on my phone. I was so excited to be able to take this incredible movie on the go and watch it on long car rides but now I can't.
3. Mine didn't include a slip cover. I am a collector so I like all of my cases in pristine condition but without the slipcover it's not complete. Now the other review pictures I've seen include a slip cover so it might be just mine.

123426,5,0792151712,"I assume you've already seen the film. Most people feel it's a great film, and I won't argue there. If you want to buy it, make sure to buy it on Blu-ray. I've also owned it on DVD and the Blu-ray simply looks so much better and has tons of extra bonus features.

It's available in a number of packages (single disc, multi-disc, Blu-ray plus DVD plus digital download, 3-D, etc.). Is it worth it to have all the extra bonus features??? That depends on how much of a Titanic buff you are. Many people will simply want the movie and won't watch the bonus features at all or more than once. For them, I'd recommend getting the single Blu-ray disc. This particular multi-disc set gives you the movie and a LOT of bonus features that are very interesting about the Titanic ship and the making of the movie.

If you find this on sale it's a great value. I cannot comment about the 3-D version as I've not seen it. It wasn't originally made or intended that way so it's likely a novelty experience.

I'd also recommend you watch the older black and white film, ""A Night to Remember"", which is arguably the best Titanic film of all time.

123463,2,0792151712,"While DiCaprio has been justifiably praised in this film (more Gatsby-esque in charm here than in Gatsby) and Kate Winslett is fine as Rose (though she looks a lot older than DiCaprio) a sober re-screening of this film puts the blame entirely where it belongs: James Cameron.

I am not going to argue story points, as to which historical facts were chosen, omitted, or entirely fabricated by Cameron, that's been done and justifiably so.

My grievance is Cameron as a writer. He writes with a crayon, he trusts neither his cast nor his story, and he thinks the audience is stupid. He needs a fake dramatic development every six pages. He would have staged a car chase (on board) if only he'd thought of it.

Worst of all is the book-ended present day stuff, then flashbacking to the story. He takes a 90 minute movie and turns it into 3 hours. The acting is uniformly horrible, the elderly lady who plays Rose, whom I'm sure is a lovely person, is a horrible actress. Everyone else is awful too.

The contrivance of the doomed love story between DiCaprio and Winslett's characters should have been plenty if properly executed. Either Cameron had no confidence, or thinks his audience is dumber than dirt. Choose your poison.

The absurd romance between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, not only never took place, but doesn't particularly make sense in the context of the early 20th century.  I really enjoyed the 1958 film;  it was inspiring to see the selfless acts of heroism that took place, and it made me think -- unlike the more recent ""Titanic"".",1453593600,,517,4.5978260869565215

123738,5,0792151712,"Since the beloved James Horner (who conducted the soundtrack for this movie) tragically passed away, I wanted to contribute my thoughts and prayers by writing a review for this beautiful, amazing film.
  On IMDB, Titanic (1997) only got a 7.7 out of 10 rating. I find this to be absolutely shameful, for it deserves a MUCH higher rating (at least an 8.2!). With a winner of 11 Academy awards (including Best Picture) and 14 nominations, this movie TOTALLY stole the Oscars of 1998, winning almost every award offered! And it deserved every single one of those awards. The remaining three that it didn't win was Best Actress for Kate Winslet (Rose), Best Supporting Actress for Gloria Stuart (Old Rose), and Best makeup.
We all know the story: a society aristocrat girl (Winslet) falls in love with a 3rd class man (DiCaprio) on the ill-fated RMS Titanic. Aside from their wonderful love story, director James Cameron made this film a masterpiece. He's a director who doesn't settle for anything less than perfect, and it shines through in this movie. Here's a few examples:
 1. The craftsmanship of the set was amazingly accurate to the original ship's interior design, leaving historians stunned at Cameron's exceptional work.
2. The costume designer (Deborah L. Scott, winner of Best Costume Design) did a superb job on creating Rose's beautiful Edwardian dresses, my favorite being the silky chiffon ""Swim Dress"" that Rose wore during the sinking sequence of the film. Hard work was put into ALL the costumes, those of 1st, 2nd, and especially 3rd class.
3. The script and casting was greatly done. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet were the perfect choices of Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukater, and you could feel their unbridled romance in the air. Kate Winslet, being British, did an exquisite job with her American accent at the time of filming as a fiery girl trapped in a materialistic family. Leonardo DiCaprio outdid himself as a poor guy living under a bridge who figures life's a gift, make each day count, (and a kick-ass guy who'd do anything to protect Rose). Billy Zane played a convincing (and jealous) villain whose only goal was to do anything he could to break the bond between two pure, true lovers. Kathy Bates did a phenomenal job as Molly Brown. Not only does she look exactly like her, but her attitude throughout the film reflected the same one that the Unsinkable Molly Brown had. All and all, the movie's message was anybody can fall in love - no matter what social class one might come from; it doesn't matter.
4. The Cinematography. Another winner for the Academy award, the picture of this movie is outstanding. The colors are crisp clear and the filming had massive quality to it. The cinematography is especially admired during the ""Flying Scene"", the sinking sequence, the ship-split scene, etc.,
5. The Music. This is by far my favorite aspect of the film. James Horner, who died tragically in a jet accident about a year ago, composed a divine, heavenly soundtrack for this film. The soundtrack is a big reason why I think Titanic is a timeless, ""Blockbuster"" classic. A Swedish singer named Sissel provided the vocals for the heartwarming music that's heard throughout the film, such as in the opening scene, the Flying scene, and the ending scene, just to name a few. The flutes, strings, piano, and orchestra only made the film even more epic.
6. Best Original Song. James Horner partnered with Celine Dion to create one of the most famous and beloved songs in history, ""My Heart Will Go On"". Played during the ending credits of the film, the song follows the instrumental music heard in the film, only with lyrics and spoken word. No one else could've performed My Heart Will Go On besides Ms. Dion herself, for she did an angelic job. Another Academy winner. I love the song so much that I performed it at one of my piano recitals, being a pianist myself.
7. The Sound. Yet another Academy winner, the sound throughout the movie - especially during the sinking sequence, is epic and euphoric. Everything is crisp clear.
8. Special Effects. Yep - another Academy winner! The special effects in Titanic were masterfully done. Thanks to the great special effects crew, the set looked nonetheless like a real-life, honest-to-goodness ship sailing through the Atlantic. The added-in water around the ship looked like water plunging around any other cruise ship. Cameron added a lot of ""Movie Magic"" effects that were done physically without the need for CGI, such as building miniature sets that looked unmistakably real. What you put into a movie is what you get out of, and from the looks of it, a ton of effort had been put into the special effects.
9. The Overall Acting and Emotion. Thanks to the brilliant acting throughout the film, you can really *feel* impacting doom yourself as Titanic sinks into the Atlantic. There's scenes of mass hysteria on both the decks and in the freezing waters. The main cast along with the extras provide an overwhelming amount of emotion throughout the movie. A 3rd class mother who couldn't make it to a lifeboat tucks her two children in so they'll sleep through the sinking. An old couple snuggle together in bed as water plunges through their room. Passengers say their prayers. Why is Titanic considered such a  ""sad"" film by many people? You'll have to thank the actors, for they did a believable and wonderful job.

Those are just a few elements that I pointed out that makes Titanic (1997) one of the best films in history, and I strongly believe it should have gotten a higher rating on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes. However, everyone has their own taste, so to each their own. The film winning 11 Academy Awards and nominated for 14 speaks for itself. What matters most is the movie is beloved by the majority of viewers, for I've never met anyone (friends, family, etc.) who didn't like this film.
  I consider this movie a piece of history, and the entire cast and crew should be forever proud of the tremendous work they put into making such a film possible. An extreme amount of effort was put into the making of it, so I think those who don't appreciate Titanic should rethink their opinions. I give Titanic a 5/5 star! GREAT job, James Cameron! And Rest in Peace, James Horner. You'll forever be missed.",1450483200,2,6295,4.796313364055299

It paid homage to all those who died on the titanic( mostly men) and how much of a tragedy it really was. I wouldn't have had her throw the necklace into the water but I've come to understand that it was symbolic. This was a great blend of love and reality. Wonderful film and I recommend it to all. I can't understand those who bash this film. I dislike Celine's voice but the compositions for this movie are stunning.

123907,5,0792151712,"Titanic was released when I was five years old, and I remember going to see it in the theater with my family. I distinctly remember seeing this movie, and it has garnered a lot of sentimental value as the years have passed. Nearly everybody was crazy In love with this movie when it first came out, and now I feel like it's become the movie that everybody loves to hate (though continues to secretly watch at home - and I bet they cry). Some people criticize Titanic for focusing on fictional characters as opposed to real people who were impacted by the tragedy.

The point of this movie is not for it to be a recreation of one person's experience aboard the Titanic - the point is for the viewer to have their own experience, to be able to connect with the ship and the time thee way people back then were able to. The viewer is able to live vicariously through Jack and Rose, becoming acquainted with the array of true historical figures and the legendary ship itself. The first half of the movie is about hope, optimism, and freedom. This is what makes the second half so gut-wrenching, because you as the viewer feels that tangible loss of hope that people back then felt. If James Cameron would have made Titanic about any one historical figure, the movie would have been limited to what that one experience was like for that person - and they probably would have spent most of their time in particular areas of the ship, giving the viewer a limited scope of the Titanic's insides. The creation of Jack and Rose allows flexibility and also for the non-fictitious figures to retain their true essence.

Also, I feel that the love story is very misunderstood. The story is really about how Rose finds herself in the midst of a disastrous event. When the viewer first meets young Rose, we are confronted with a very troubled and lost young woman. She finds a kindred spirit in Jack, someone with whom she identifies with and is inspired by. Jack is naturally a very strong person, and he encourages Rose to become a fighter and tap into her true potential. The heart of the love story is strength and perseverance. Even when Rose loses everything, she continues to move forward and goes on to live a very full life. That is a lot more than I can say for stories like Romeo and Juliet (even though I love that play)! The cinematography and costume design is gorgeous, the special effects are awe-inspiring, the music is both uplifting and gut-wrenchingly sad, and the acting (while sometimes cheesy) is both youthful and innocent. It's nice to see both Kate and Leo pre-superstardom. My sentimental attachment to Titanic has inspired me to learn more about the real event, and I have read countless books that have given me deeper insight and knowledge on the subject. Regardless of how much this movie is made fun of, it remains one of my all-time favorites and always will.",1444348800,,2877,4.595330739299611

There will be a guy who loves a girl and they meet up and have fun doing different class things :p Meaning Jack, third-class, goes to Rose, first-class, and vice versa.

It's all fun and games and then they realize that the ship hit something.

And Rose knows.

Not everyone will get off. Not everyone will survive.

They do the new ""SOS"" but to no avail. There's a ship in the difference- but no response.

The frozen bodies. Noo. Jack is one of them.

What does Rose do? She slowly pushes him away and does what he wanted her to do- survive. She goes and lives her life, throwing away the purple heart in the ocean from all those days ago.

124122,5,0792151712,"3D is absolutely amazing! I'll be using that word a lot...

When young Rose first appears on the screen, getting out of the car to board Titanic, it's fantastic 3D work everywhere! The camera perspective and the depth of Rose's hat.... just amazing! The detail and clarity on the close-up shot of Old Rose and even the depth on her nose... Wow! Seeing Rose and Jack on the edge of the Titanic in 3D is so surreal.

They did an incredible job with the 3D conversion... it really feels like the film was shot in 3D! It's very, very impressive. A lot of money, time, and hard work definitely went into it.

The hallway scenes inside the Titanic gives amazing depth that I really feel like I'm standing there with them and totally forget that I am even wearing 3D glasses or watching a 3D movie....

Now, I don't believe all films should be in 3D. However, 3D is definitely NOT a gimmick when it's done right and the movie deserves it. (Terminator 2 definitely deserves to be rereleased in 3D!) Titanic is perfect for 3D -- it really gives the audience an experience of really feeling of being on the Titanic, and near Jack/Rose that would not be possible any other way.

The production value on Titanic and how much money it made really lives up to it's own name. It's everything you would want in a movie; love story, music, action.... and 3D just completely slammed it out of the park, making it the total complete perfect package. Titanic 3D is a must own for any 3D collector - it's a no brainer! If you're a huge fan of Titanic, you're missing out not seeing it in 3D... it's definitely an incredible experience, especially on a large projection screen. The technology really is amazing. Thank you, James Cameron! (Christopher Nolan needs to stop being pretentious and bring his films to 3D... Inception totally deserves it too)

Not just the 3D, but the HD detail/aspect ratio and clarity has been improved; it's very sharp, great colors and detail that it is worthy and pleasure to watch in 3D where there is no sense of fuzziness at all.

I'm a guy and I'm not ashamed to say Titanic is one of my favorite films. I owned it on VHS, DVD, Blu-ray... and now 3D Blu-ray... I'm sure Cameron is very happy... I'll wait for the Titanic Virtual Reality edition in 20 years.",1438128000,,2271,4.497572815533981

The lyrics "" my heart will go on"" has become household words. It is a Romance drama. Global box office revenue was more than 1.8 billion dollars. It shows that this film have great influence for people and the quality of film.
  The Titanic describes that the whole process from sailing to wreck by a love story about Jack and Rose. Jack is a poor painter, Rose is a noble girl. Because Rose felt nobody really cares her real emotion and she has to married with another man which is she does not love at all. She tried to jump into the ocean. But Jack saves Rose when she tried to murder and then they fall in love. Rose decided to married with Jack while the ship arrival. Unfortunately, Because of the ship's exercise too fast, causing the ship hit the iceberg in the Atlantic and make the cabin filled with water. But Jack and Rose always never abandon when the ship is sinking.
  A late dinner, the suffering of Rose to the stern of the ship to jump off the end of the suicide, but fortunately Jack found to persuade and stop. Besides, when the ship sinking, the director recorded the pillars of the boat collapsed and people were desperate to escape or calm the waiting for death. So, the director chose two different strata of people's love story as the material and the film used extraordinary technology to exhibited the Titanic scenery on the screen.
  In order to exhibited the Titanic scenery on the screen, the director spends two hundreds millions dollar and spends 5 years for shot this film. The film as much as possible to restore the scene. For example, used the world's largest deep-sea exploration ship, the ship's submarine is the world's only able to dive to about 4000 meters depth of five submarines. In addition, the Titanic was accomplished by a lot of good actors. Eg: Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kathy Bates and so forth. You jump, I jump."" ""To make each day count."" ""I figure life is a gift and I don't intend on wasting it. You never know what hand you're going to get dealt next. You learn to take life as it comes at you."" These words became classical lines.

I even remembered seeing the beginning of part two when I was a kid. We used to have 2 separate VHS tapes at home. Not anymore. I tried looking for it at Target of Best Buy but I couldn't find it. The only features on the DVD I bought were the deleted scenes. I watch the Jack and Rose compilation to get the gist as to what's happening after each scene so that I wouldn't have to ask ""Is it over yet?"" I admired both Leonardo and Kate before and after I've seen this. I even spotted a copy at Walmart and thought ""I should've gotten that."" My admiration of those two grew stronger and stronger after seeing this. I actually have this in French and Italian. This is my very first movie for adults and then after that, my collection is now called ""Movies for all ages in French & Italian"". I kinda know how the scenes where Titanic was sinking were shot. One of them is where one half of it going vertical and people couldn't hold on as they start to fall. They shot that scene in green screen. I know that some scenes were shot at a parking lot and the ale on the 3rd class is root beer. Sometimes I thought 1st class is nice and all but 3rd class seems to be a fun place to hang out and rest. People in 1st class would do things like have an afternoon tea, hanging out smoking and drinking, etc. And 3rd class is full of dancing, music and all the other fun stuff. A couple of things have puzzled and disturbed me and that is seeing the drawings of French girls and their breasts exposed; even the one that Jack did. (Though I like the first half.) It also made me think of the musical and one of the Magic Tree House books I read.",1430438400,3,1777,4.08

124403,5,0792151712,"This is for the 4 disc 3D Blu-Ray. I bought this as a first 3D DVD and I have to say it was beyond what I expected. Titanic in 3D is a whole new experience from the standard version. The picture is sharp and it feels like you can reach into the TV screen and touch everything that is happening. The sound is spectacular  5.1 THX sound. It was sobering to see the disaster presented in 3D. Those giant propellers crashing into the water. You can feel the weight of that ship and the forces at work to drag her down into the ocean. Like some relentless invisible force spitting in the face of mans ego, destroying his giant unsinkable ship. Hiding it in the depths and lost forever to history. Showing mankind there is no class of people when it comes to disaster. The special features on Disc 4 are worth the price alone. If you are a fan of movie making and you like history or big machines, definitely check out the documentaries. One of them being, ""Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron"". I highly recommend this, as it is a forensic look at the wreck. Cameron and a panel of experts treat it as a crime scene and reconstruct all the pieces through eyewitness accounts, science and computer graphics. It's the first time anyone has ever looked at the wreck like this. It makes you realize how massively huge Titanic was but how vast the ocean is in comparison. Upon buying this set, I have a different perspective now about Titanic itself, the folks that night on the sea and the making of the film. This movie may have had fictional lead characters, but the desperation of the people and events of the ship were real and it is history.",1428710400,,1644,4.407894736842105

124538,5,0792151712,"I remember the end of 1999, when a German DPA news agency writer, summarizing the 20th century on film, described the scene of Rose and Jack, standing at the top of the highest point of Titanic deck, as one of the most memorable romantic scenes ever put on the screen. Wasn't it too courageous a statement?
Well, the biggest film phenomenon of the late 20th century (as all big things) is good to be reassessed every now and then. Seventeen years afterwards - and more than a century after the most notoriously famous sinking of a ship - director James Cameron can be confirmed as a very successful filmmaker whose hugest accomplishment is good enough for him to keep him in film anals for the rest of movie history. In fact, he bettered the box office success with ""Avatar"" in 2009...
It is interesting how the reputation of ""Titanic"" and its stars has been changing ever since its premiere in late 1997. As a typical blockbuster, it was naturally criticized by self-interested film buffs, despite its shower of 11 Academy Awards. But the long-lasting work this is, and not only due to its technical accomplishments - the screenplay holds up surprisingly well, it is intelligent and accessible without getting too cheap or cheesy.
Its main two stars - Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, playing a fictitious couple amid the true story - have indeed entered among the most accomplished and versatile actors of our generation. The film itself appeared in the ranking of American Film Association's 100 best films of all time (updated chart published in 2007) at number 83, which testifies to its improved reputation and longevity.
So, with the added shower of special bonuses this product is packed with - what are you waiting for?",1426550400,,1731,4.831649831649831

124757,5,0792151712,"This review is of the 4 disc combo and there are already thousands of reviews here regarding the acting, historical accuracy, opinions of one kind or another and even those one sentence type of reviews saying ' I liked it'.  I will refrain from all of that and focus strictly upon the quality of the actual transfer from Standard Def to Blue Ray.  When this movie first came out, it was strictly available on VHS tape so a lot of time has gone by since.  My reviews for all Blu Ray discs are strictly regarding the transfer from Standard Definition to Blu Ray. Keep in mind that the quality of what you see and hear also depends upon the quality of TV monitor you are using and its accompanying home theater processor and speakers. I have a pretty high end,7.1 esoteric system and am judging the Blu Ray off of that.

VIDEO QUALITY.....
  The cover of the case says the film was completely remastered and I have no doubts that it was done so lovingly.  This is one gorgeous disc.  The color has all been restored with warm and natural color grading bypassing the need to pop any colors like you might see in a Transformers film.  There were absolutely no artifacts or dirt of any kind and I saw not a single dropout.  Details down to the creases in ones eye or brow and individual hairs were easily denoted without any smudging of said details due to over compression or careless reproduction.  In dark areas of the film, details remained very present and nothing was lost.  Color saturation and resolution is spot on and the remastering was successful in restoring all that from the original masters of the film.  MBPS rate varied, of course, depending upon the amount of action taking place. Therefore, static scenes could be seen at a low 20's Mbps rate but the action scenes went up as high as the mid 40's.  Overall, I'd say the average was in the high 30's which is pretty damn good.  CGI and green screen work was done extensively in this film and, since Titanic's release, technological improvements have been made by leaps and bounds. That said, some of the long wide angle CGI work in Titanic was especially obvious to me and not up to par with some of the more realistic CGI work of today.  Specifically, the shots taken from a distance that panned over the ship as it was sailing.  The CGI of people walking the deck was clearly CGI.  But, I am nitpicking. I didn't expect a remastering to also be a re recording or improvement over these scenes.  The video of this remastering of 'The Titanic' is excellent in every way.

AUDIO QUALITY....
  My only complaint is that they did not extend the wonderfully lossless DTS HD MA 5.1 audio to a 7.1 audio option.  That said, the audio is superior to most any film on Blu Ray that you will find.  Dialogue is clear and transparent with audio leveling set just right, so once you set the volume level on your receiver or processor, you will not have to adjust it again.  The audio is completely and totally immersive and you feel that you are in the midst of everything that is going on.  There is a great deal of appropriate panning of the audio around the front and rear sound stages with spot on directionality to the sides depending upon where the action is.  It is rare that the LFE sub channel is a star of audio as the subs are usually reserved for explosions and car crashes, gunshots and bombs, but in Titanic's audio, your LFE channel will be working full time to reproduce some very deep and accurate bottom end bass recreating the rush of water and a million other places that envelope you in the audio experience.  Another thing that I was happy about is that the musical score does not step on any of the audio foley fx in any part of this very long film.  This often occurs in other films but not here.

EXTRAS....There are a great many extras and I have not watched them all yet.  I did get to watch the fully finished 30 deleted scenes that are presented as full and complete scenes with Dolby Digital 5.1 audio.  Yes, they could have included them in an extended version bringing the film to over 4 hours in duration but I do not feel cheated that they were not part of an extended release.  There are also commentaries from James Cameron, the cast , the film on Standard Def spread over 2 discs, various behind the scenes documentaries and a bunch more which I plan on getting to when there is time.  The digital copy does work with iTunes...so happy about this as I am not forced to use Ultra Violet which I do not care for.

If you still have 'Titanic' on VHS, now is the time to upgrade and update to this 4 disc remastering.  You will see and appreciate the film in a new light.  I am very pleased that the manufacturers did not simply re-encode this film to Blu Ray but did all the remastering first and then encoded that to Blu Ray.  It is the way all films, especially older ones, should be remastered.  This set is DEMO Worthy, no question about it.
I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase. All my blu ray reviews focus only on the actual quality of the transfer to blu ray so I hope some of them may be of help to you as well.

124829,5,0792151712,"Last week I watched Titanic for perhaps the 20th time since its release in 1997.  Needless to say, it ranks very high on my Top 10 list of favorite movies.

Theres not really much I can add to the plethora of reviews written about the quality of Titanic itself, so I won't even try. The ratings at Amazon.com, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, and Flixster  speak for themselves, as does the number of awards the film has garnered over the years. Professional reviewers like the late, great Roger Ebert gave the film rave reviews. I completely agree with their assessment.

My review concerns the Blu-ray version of Titanic that I purchased from Amazon a week ago. Before last week, I had never seen this film in high definition video or surround sound. (I had only previously owned a copy of the movie on an early, bare-bones DVD edition that was of such poor quality it was almost painful to watch.)  So, when I sat down last week and  fired up my Blu-ray player and HDTV, and settled into my recliner to watch this fantastic film for the first time in HD, I was completely blown away

It was immediately evident that James Cameron and his production team spared no expense and cut no corners in remastering Titanic for Blu-ray. I found the video detail simply astounding from the very first frame! I saw colors that are perfect, images that are sharp and detailed (but with no edge enhancement) and film grain thats natural but unobtrusive. I didn't see any banding, crushing, dirt, speckles, or other anomalies anywhere throughout the films three hour runtime. This Blu-ray version uses a lossless DTS Master Audio Multi-channel that completely filled my viewing space with 5.1 surround audio thats completely immersive and life-like. To me, the experience was akin to seeing Titanic for the first time!

The Blu-ray version of Titanic that I purchased is the four-disc combo-pack that includes: two Blu-ray discs, one containing the restored feature film and accompanying audio commentary tracks, and the other containing over four hours of special features. Also included are two DVDs that each contain half of the feature film. It must be noted that the DVD version of Titanic contained in this set has been digitally remastered, and of extremely good quality.

If youve never seen Titanic in high definition/surround sound, or if you're looking to upgrade the version in your disc collection to one having the best video and audio quality available, this 4-Disc Combo Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy version is the one to get. Highly recommended.",1422144000,7,2542,4.934426229508197

124952,4,0792151712,"There are a ton of problems in ""Titanic""  the cartoon villains, the stilted dialogue, much of it obviously re-recorded in post production. Some weak supporting performances, the betrayal of a number of historical facts, and taking what was already one of the most dramatic nights of the 20th century and needlessly pumping it up with chases, gunfire, theft, scheming, etc.

Yet a lot works. As much as I didn't want to give in, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio make a great, old fashioned, star crossed romantic couple. Many of the effects and stunts are amazing (although at other times the hyper-sharp quality of blu-ray reveals some wide shots as basically giant video-game like cartoons). And it made me cry -- while I felt like a fool for being swept up in it's shameless melodrama.

I can't argue that ""Titanic"" is art, or deep, or a great film, but I can say it's a terrifically effective entertainment that everyone should see at least once.",1420329600,,951,4.822085889570552

125037,5,0792151712,"This gigantic film(in scope, subject, cost and revenue) was a wondrous blend of history, melodrama, and musical score.  The director, James Cameron, gave up his entire compensation package to get the final financing for the film. (They later richly rewarded him.)
The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as the ultimate tragic love affair.  Unlike other such cinematic tragedies, theirs was caused by Nature and not by Man.  As you know, the ship Titanic(unsinkable?) was a flawed(in construction) ship; when it struck a glacier a glancing blow, the hard side of ice opened the side of the weakly made ship, thus ending its fateful cruise.
The plot integrated the burgeoning love affair twixt DiCaprio and Winslet with the larger drama of the ship sinking.  We see gallantry and selfishness as the ship's emergency gear(lifeboats,etc) was found to be wanting.  The icy waters were unforgiving.
Interlaid into this patchwork of vignettes was the 'bookends': at the start, the woman who survived(due to the gallantry of that man) has come to observe the actual research into the Titanic undersea wreckage.  At the end, she consecrates the site to honor the fallen in a moving moment.  Unique among films such as this, we see an interweave of current time footage with period historical scenes.  Somehow it works.  At all times, the haunting musical score adds just the right touch...",1418860800,,1391,5.092511013215859

125182,5,0792151712,"The hype surrounding James Cameron's ""Titanic"" when it was released during Christmas, 1997, and early 1998 was so great that it worked against the film in a way. Few films could live up to such ballyhoo. Nevertheless, viewing it apart from the mass hoopla, it shines in all-around greatness.

The movie of course details the doomed maiden voyage of the magnificent Titanic from April 10-15, 1912. This is one of the greatest tragedies in human history. There were only enough lifeboats for half of the over 2200 men, women and children aboard. Why? Because the Titanic was so great they thought she was unsinkable. When it was all over only a little over 700 people survived and 1500 people went to their grave in the cold North Atlantic.

This is a movie and not a documentary and, as such, includes a fictional drama to hook the viewer. This is where people will either embrace the film or criticize it. As far as I'm concerned, the story of Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet) is excellent. Rose is only 17 years old and is being forced by her fearful mother (Frances Fisher) to marry the pompously rich Cal (Billy Zane). Jack, by contrast, is a dirt poor wandering artist who's free as the wind and brims with life, love, and humble honesty.

Rose instinctively feels trapped and would rather die than marry some fake snob, no matter how handsome and wealthy. She's attracted to Jack because he's the antithesis of Cal. By contrast, her mother views Jack as a threat because she thinks that her only hope of retaining the airs of wealth is through marrying her daughter into a rich family. The ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) is another significant personality. She's new enough to ""high society"" to still relate to the ""commoners"" and so goes out of her way to help Jack and his brushes with the stuffy aristocracy. Thrown into the mix is Cal's priceless diamond necklace for Rose and what happens to it.

Speaking of which, there's a modern story (1996 anyway) that brackets the main plot. Bill Paxton stars as a treasure hunter obsessed with the necklace, Suzy Amis as Rose's granddaughter and Gloria Stuart as old-aged Rose. Gloria was 85-86 years old during filming and she just shines in the role.

The casting and acting is exceptional, particularly the main performers. It's no wonder that DiCaprio and Winslet went on to great success. In addition, the depictions of the vessel and her tragic sinking are magnificent.

Yet it's the powerful subtext that inspires most. What good is great wealth without love, virtue, respect and freedom? In her untainted teenage idealism, Rose would rather die than have this. Jack lacks the former but possesses the latter and, therefore, possesses the former as well, even if you can't see it (if you know what I mean). Rose instinctively senses this and therefore throws all caution to the wind. Some criticize that she goes too far by prematurely getting intimate in the vehicle, but - remember - she grew-up with her life-stifling, greedy, fear-mongering mother and so when she finally gets away from her clutches she naturally goes overboard. Have some compassion!

As for the fate of the necklace (***SPOILER***), Rose didn't cash-in on the diamond because she didn't want to rely on Cal for money; and she didn't give it to her granddaughter or the
treasure-hunter because it wasn't hers to give. Since the insurance company paid out on the policy Cal's dad took out on it, the diamond belonged to the insurance company if found; it was no longer the property of Hockley or his heirs, and it wasn't the property of Rose either, because it was not made over to her by a deed of gift or a bequest. She came into possession of it by mistake and so was obligated by law to turn it over to the rightful owners or, if that was not possible, to legal authorities. More importantly, the necklace was a reminder of her promise to Jack to ""Never let go."" She thus throws it into the ocean because she had fulfilled her promise to live life to the fullest and was now ready let go, particularly since she finally returned to Jack's watery grave (***END SPOILER***).

It wouldn't be right to fail to acknowledge the great score by James Horner and the theme song sung by Celine Dion. Great movies are great because their producers take the time & effort to achieve excellence on every level.

Needless to say, because the film runs 3 hours and 14 minutes you have to be in the mood for a long movie to fully appreciate ""Titanic.""

125217,5,0792151712,"Can I possibly elaborate on what so many others have said already regarding this epic movie?  Maybe not... but here I go anyway!

The story is simple in it's complicated brilliance: a treasure hunter (Bill Paxton) is pillaging the wreck of the great Titanic for a legendary diamond, but when he comes up empty handed again and again, he finds the only person who can help him is a hundred year old woman named Rose (Gloria Stuart) a survivor of the Titanic disaster who clearly hasn't spoken of the tragedy since she lived it.  She relates her story on the doomed ship to the mesmerized explorers and here the movie really begins.  The young Rose (Kate Winslet) is a society darling who is about to marry for money (certainly not love) to the cold Cal Hockley (Billy Zane).  She's in first class on the fateful ship, and meets a steerage passenger (Leonardo DiCaprio) who won his berth in a poker game.  Over the course of the ship's voyage they fall in love, and when disaster strikes they find themselves in the fight of their lives.

A degree of hyperbole is appropriate when I say this movie has something for EVERYONE!  There's drama, romance (one of the most beautiful and sad since ""Casablanca""), danger and fights for survival (which of the characters we've come to know will perish on the great ship?), and sumptuous period details and costumes that totally immerse you in the times, prejudices, and customs of the Edwardian era.  Now, I am aware of the handful of historical inconsistencies (compiled by self-described ""rivet counters"" within the online Titanic community) and injustices  to the characters who were really on the ship, but I know when to keep my nit-picking mouth shut when I see a movie that's this good.  I have to pay special mention/tribute to the very sympathetic portrayal of Titanic's builder Thomas Andrews (Victor Garber).

James Cameron (love him or hate him) has pulled off the most faithful adaptation of the Titanic story ever committed to film.  Not to mention the beautiful James Horner soundtrack coupled with the extremely well known Celine Dion hit ""My Heart Will Go On"".  On a purely personal note, my one gripe is that Cameron didn't think to or didn't find it necessary to show those survivors who gave interviews in their old age as little kids aboard the ship (like Eva Hart, Ruth Becker, or even the French twin boys abducted by their father on his way to America).  I guess there could be only so much drama in an already highly dramatic, epic film.

In the scheme of things James Cameron's ""Titanic"" is by any measure a huge, HUGE film.  It left a it's mark on the pop culture of the late '90s, peaks interest in the tragedy it chronicles, and no matter how many times you see it, it's still an extraordinary cocktail of drama and romance that wrenches emotions out of you that you never knew you had.  In the story of film, ""Titanic"" is the last great old epic movie of the 20th century, in the mold of ""Ben-Hur"" and ""The Ten Commandments"", and also the first modern epic that would pave the way for ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.  In the scope of history, this movie could serve as a bookend of sorts.  The disaster of the Titanic in 1912 ""opened"" the 20th century and this movie, premiering in 1997, saw the 20th  century wind down.  This movie, therefore, is a phenomenal tribute to not just the power of film, but the power of star-crossed love, the history of a forgotten time, and a massive human tragedy that continues to fascinate over a hundred years after it happened.",1415404800,,3534,4.63884430176565

I know that most of you are thinking, why would I pay this much money for such an old movie... Well, James Cameron and crew spent millions of dollars and many months converting this movie into 3D. It is arguably the best 3D I have encountered. Most 3D films that post-convert into 3D just use a computer system. Titanic and Jurassic Park actually used humans (and the directors of the film) to show the guys what parts of the film need to ""pop-out"". They individually layered the backgrounds to produce an incredible 3D experience. If you think 3D is a gimmick, then you are either watching the wrong 3D movies, or do not have a great 3D TV. I recommend the 55 curved LG OLED TV.
This makes for an extremely enjoyable 3D film.",1414627200,,747,4.420289855072464

My wife had seen the original 2D theatrical release several times, but this is the first time for me, in 3D no less!!  The original 2D production and its cinematography is much enhanced in this 3D issue.  If you could only purchase one 3D BR, this is the one to get!!",1413158400,,746,4.522388059701493

125325,5,0792151712,"The disaster, you hate. The loss of lives, you deplore. The movie, you'll love. This huge, mega-blockbuster film was a larger than life hit, at the box office. Historical accuracy truly comes alive as the detailed, big-screen depiction of the doomed, maiden voyage of the 'unsinkable' ship, comes alive. Just as their were various levels and quarters in the decks of the ship, so too, were the inhumane, arrogant portrayals of the shameful and despicable social caste system. Either you belonged or you didn't. Either you were a part of the minority elite or you were branded an outsider who was useless them them, thus being expendable. And therefore, coldly and cruelly dismissed, unto the point of death and not worth, saving. What the wealthy, affluent, pampered, spoiled, snots of society had so callously forgotten, was that everyone on board that ship, was a human being. And their lives were worth the saving, just as much as their own. Death does not differentiate between the rich and powerful and the poor and the impoverished. Every human being deserves a chance to live, even if they aren't wealthy. Even, in times of a maritime disaster. Regardless of what the pompous, prideful,  aristocrats say, do or want. The sinking of the ship was tragic. The loss of lives, was horrific. But the scope of this big-screen depiction was magnificent. The cast and crew were superb, as were the special effects. And although some theatrical liberty was taken, the majority of the film was meticulous in detail and in it's historical accuracy. Which was based on eye-witness accounts, as witnessed by the survivors. It's mind boggling to think, that such a catastrophic disaster could have been avoided, if only the greed and arrogance of competitive businessmen and their driven lust for notoriety, had not consumed them. And overridden their regard for the health and safety of both rich and poor human lives, and the ship itself. This film is enormous in every form and fashion and will rivet your viewing attention. All this and so much more, on this 3 disc, special edition. But brace yourself, dear viewer. Because their is nothing shallow or superficial about the suffering and the loss of lives, depicted here. May those innocent souls that were lost, forever 'Rest In Peace.' Nina Kish",1412035200,,2294,4.958441558441558

Winslet and DiCaprio have more than proven themselves as durable performers since this picture was released, but not in this adolescent extravaganza.

125541,1,0792151712,"I saw this film in a theater when it was originally released. I anticipated a pretty accurate retelling of one of history's worst maritime disasters. At the time I remember being fairly impressed with the film. Watching it again last night for the first time in years, I have revised my opinion.
I find the story line involving Jack and Rose frankly unbelievable. We are asked to accept the premise that Rose is willing to throw her life over for the sake of Jack, a ruffian from the opposite end of the strictly enforced Edwardian social spectrum. This is bad enough, but in this film Jack looks like he has been plucked directly from middle school. He hardly seems like a convincing companion for Rose. As others have remarked,in the film she looks about ten years older than Jack.
She is engaged to marry Cal Hockley, who is presented as a cartoon villain straight from The Perils of Pauline. If there had been any railroad tracks handy, I do not doubt that he would have tied Rose to them. Also,for whatever reason, the people responsible for this film chose to transform Charles Lightoller into a knave and a buffoon. Even Cal Hockley, with little room to talk, identifies him as strutting martinet. Nothing could be further from the truth. Lightoller appears to have been one of the true heroes of the night the Titanic sank. His clear head and calm thinking were said to be responsible for saving a number of lives. Based on what I've read, the real Mr. Lightoller was nothing like his portrayal in the film.
In sum, I think the film was something of a bait and switch. I wanted to see the real story, not Rose and Jack pursuing each other through chest deep ice water shrieking Rose !, Jack ! , Rose !, Jack ! through half the movie.
It isn't a film I can recommend, or have any intention of watching again.",1406937600,2,1815,4.519756838905775

125654,2,0792151712,"What could have been a great opportunity to apply modern fx technology to a fascinating true story gets bogged down by a ridiculous teenage soap opera ""human interest"" narrative;  that at times is so smarmy it is painful to watch.

I saw this movie when it first came out in theaters and thought it was overrated.  Watched it again in my home theater and my opinion is unchanged.

The premise of the plot that Cameron used seems to be based on the following idea:  ""Hey! what if we took two typical oversexed, vulgar, smart-alecky American teens from the 1990s and placed them on a ship in 1912?""

We are asked to believe that in the space of 3 days a sheltered upper-class girl of the Edwardian era, with no outside experience of the world, would suddenly:

1)  fall for a scruffy third class guy
2)  pose naked for him on a couch and have sex with him in the backseat of a car
3)  give the ""middle finger salute"" to someone
4)  spit on her fianc
5)  tell her mother to SHUTUP!

DiCaprio is way too girlish-looking to be the hero.  Winslet looks about 10 years older than him.  The movie depicts Jack as having the run of the ship, including free access to the first class areas.  Not only is it very unlikely that a wealthy girl like Rose would ever go for a guy like Jack, on the real Titanic they wouldn't have even met;  since first and third class were very strictly segregated.

The dialogue throughout the entire movie is wooden and clichd, and in the climactic last part of the movie consists mostly of ""Jack! Jack!"" and ""Rose! Rose!""

Billy Zane is a caricature of a villain, and is almost hysterically funny.  He does almost every ""villain-thing"" except twirl his mustache and mutter ""Curses!  Foiled again!""  I'm surprised Cameron didn't depict him carrying a bullwhip around on the ship.

The caricature is  also applied to almost everyone else in the movie.  Nearly all the first class passengers are depicted as cynical, selfish, unfeeling snobs.  The third class passengers are all noble and brave.  Obviously money and its acquisition is evil, Cameron seems to say.  A particularly odd message from a director who made mucho $$$ off this movie and lives a lifestyle of multiple big homes, yachts, and private airplanes; that would have astonished the wealthiest of Titanic's passengers.

The only way to watch this film is to fast-forwarded through the silly Jack-Rose scenes, and view some of the scenes of the ship and the sinking;  which at least capture some of the feel of the real Titanic.",1403913600,3,2512,4.617647058823529

Although Billy Zane is a fine actor, I felt he was too young and handsome to play a man that the young Rose deplored and felt pushed into marrying (by her mother) for his wealth.  They should have cast an older, less attractive man (or downright ugly man) - because honestly, most young women would have been thrilled to be engaged to the handsome, sophisticated and extremely wealthy Zane.

125713,5,0792151712,"I've had a top-notch 3D-capable home theater system for almost five years. Quite honestly I haven't bothered with calibrating the 3D settings of my 75"" TV until recently because so few movies have been released in which 3D adds to the viewing experience. Most use it as a gimmick. The colors get washed out; the 3D effect is either meaningless or grossly overdone... and that's in the theater presentations! This is particularly true of post-filming 3D conversions, which is what most are.

Enter Avatar, the gold standard for 3D movies. It was created with 3D in mind and is flawless in that regard. There are also some great animated movies that work in 3D. But are there enough live-action titles to make it worth your while to bother with the format? Well, you can add one to that list: Titanic.

Even though it is a 2D conversion, Titanic in 3D impresses. It proves that picking the right story, and making the right 3D setting decisions, can result in a stunning viewer experience. The dramatic vistas benefit from the effect, and 3D depth is used appropriately. Colors still look great IF your TV 3D settings are properly set. I won't go into geeky technical details. You can get all that elsewhere. Suffice it to say that I'm glad I bought this Blu-ray product.

I would however like to add my 2-cents about 3D in general. If you haven't already invested in a home theater system and plan on watching 3D, I urge you to go big. A 55"" screen would be the minimum I would suggest because it takes a large image to immerse you into the 3D effect. Also read about your TV settings. They will need to be very different for 3D than they are for regular 2D viewing. You can find details about your model TV on forums like AVSforum.com. Of course professional calibration will give you the best results, but you can still vastly improve on the factory menu settings by doing some searching online.

Finally, keep in mind that your home 3D experience will only be as good as your glasses and other components will deliver. Do your homework and you'll find good deals on stuff that delivers great results.",1400112000,,2102,4.612299465240642

125718,4,0792151712,"I have just gotten this on DVD after having the VHS tape.  The DVD adds a lot to the movie's rich look.  I've always thought that the movie was miscast.  I can never see Bill Paxton without remembering the scene in the movie where he was such a piece of crap character and got so scared he peed on himself.  He just isn't a good actor.  I've seen him in several movies and he just isn't a good actor. Sounds too fake no matter what he says.  If he hadn't been a good friend of Camerons I don't think he'd have been cast.  I also don't care for the casting of Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack.  If they were going to use Kate Winslett who does a really good job, then they should have cast a man who was bigger than she is.  In their scenes together her head is larger than his. She is apparently a big woman. And, he looks like a 15 year old kid.  In the first parts of the movie her makeup, especially her lipstick, is very distracting.  High class women in that period of time did not wear dark lipstick or any lipstick at all.  She is actually a pretty woman but the makeup is garish. The first time I saw this movie on VHS I was very disappointed in everything about it.  But, it look better on DVD and is more enjoyable. The fact that they hint that she and Cal have already been sleeping together just isn't believable.  A well bred girl who was trying to marry money would never have given away samples so to speak.  They certainly made Cal despicable.  His only saving grace was that he did apparently love Rose or was obsessed with her. Other than that he was painted as the worst cad imaginable. I saw no purpose in the last scene where the old Rose throws the diamond into the sea.  She apparently needed money badly so why didn't she sell it in order to get a new start.  Things like that can be handled discreetly.  The diamond had no real significance regarding the romance she had with Jack.  Didn't make sense for her to hold on to it for all those years then throw it into the sea.  The least she could have done after he had arranged for her visit back to the Titanic site and listened to her story would have been to maybe slip it into his pocket before she left the ship.  Now,, THAT would have been a good ending. I liked the part at the end where she believes she is meeting Jack on the stairs again. Through out all their scenes together Kate simply carries DiCaprio along with her.  She is a tremendous actress.  I was glad to see how her love and passion for him made her go back into the bowels of that sinking ship to rescue him.  I believed her - that she was doing it.  Anyway, it's a good movie of it's type.  Of course, I've seen many movies about Titanic and the sinking of it.  This sinking may be a bit prolonged.  It seemed to last on the screen as long as it did in real life. That was the best Molly Brown I've even seen in a Titanic movie.  What an actress she is. If you haven't seen it - and I can't believe that there is anyone who hasn't, then get it and look at it.",1399680000,,3001,4.0977701543739276

125746,5,0792151712,"If I had to describe Titanic in one word it would be emotional. The movie leads you through ups and downs and ins and outs. The story is portrayed by a group of terrific actors and a beautiful and realistic set.
 The movie starts out with both Rose and Jack (the lead roles) arriving on the titanic. It shows how both of them get there, and the different lifestyles that they live. The contrast between there lives is extreme. Rose is a rich woman with a rich fianc, and Jack is a poor man who lives freely and does and goes whatever and wherever he wants. The two meet when Jack stops Rose from commiting suicide, and Rose stops the people in charge from thinking Jack is a criminal. The two introduce one another to each others lives, and they become very close. When the Titanic hits the ice burg and the two only have two hours to figure out how to survive there love is put to the test.
 The movie is extremely well made. The costumes are realistic and the animation is pristine. The way they told the story of Rose and Jack was not only clever, but unique. The script is very well written and the characters very well developed. I guess it is is hard not to develop a character if the movie is three hours long.
 All in all I give this movie a 9.5/10 stars. The reason I took the last half start of was because since the movie was so long it was hard to sit through. The movie was an emotional rollercoaster and I went from tears of laughter to tears of sorrow.

I love 3D and have a pretty big collection of 3D moves (not all of them good). Maybe it's because I have a big (really big) screen home theatre that uses active shutter glasses and displays amazing 3D images and because the conversion of this movie was done under the very close scrutiny of its director James Cameron, that I knew it would be superb, and it is.

125896,5,0792151712,"For years, I have been fascinated with the sinking of the Titanic. I know that sounds really dark, but it is just such a mysterious and intriguing subject. I mean a ship that everyone labeled ""unsinkable"" sank on her maiden voyage taking with her the lives of over a thousand innocent people. But, I just recently got around to seeing the movie, and I don't even know where to start. By far, this is the best movie ever made, and my personal favorite. The love story between Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet) is so lovely and romantic. The part where he takes her to the bow of the ship, and she ""flies"" is the best part of the whole movie. So amazing! When the ship hits the iceberg, you still have about an hour and a half to go, and it is action packed. The are many, and I mean many, close calls when you think they will both die, but then they escape somehow. Then, alas, when they get thrown into the water, everyone knows, Jack dies. It is very heartbreaking, but you almost feel like it's OK. He released Rose from her chains, and told her to never give up on life. The part that was the most touching to me was the end, when old Rose is in bed, and it shows you pictures of her life, and all the things she has done, fulfilling her promise to Jack. Then, just like Jack predicted, she dies an old lady warm in her bed, and you see her rejoin Jack on the Grand Staircase with everyone cheering on. I really don't know what else to say! This is a movie everyone should see before they die. It makes you grateful for life, and glad you have another day to live. It's my favorite movie, and I am sure I will watch it over and over and over again. You might want to have a box of tissues with you when you watch it, though.

My husband usually can't sit through a 2-hour movie, let alone a 3-hour movie. And while this at heart is a true chick flick, it was quite engaging and lively.

125924,1,0792151712,"I've never submitted a bad review, but, even if I'm the lone voice in the wilderness, this time I have to.
People seem to LOVE this movie, and I really, Really REALLY tried. But I don't!
It has been 16 years since I've seen this in a theater, but my recollections are accurate. The berg comes almost exactly in the middle of it all (you switch disks about 4 minutes after they hit the berg). So we watched it in two installments: neat (no ice) and on the rocks (ice).

It really IS two very different movies. The first half is a melodramatic love story, and the second half is an Irwin Allen Disaster movie! Occasionally, they mingle, and the mix STILL makes me angry.

OK. The love story is nice. Not great, not immortal, but nice. It's certainly would not be worth its own movie.
The second half is impressive, but it's spoiled by the bulls**t of the love story.
There never WAS a 'Star of The Ocean.' There never WERE a Jack and Rose. There never WAS a nasty, grasping, spoiled millionaire (whose name nobody remembers.) That's all CRAP! It's made-up Hollywood rehash.

What there was, was a John Jacob Astor. What there was was a Benjamin Guggenheim. What there was was a Molly Brown. What there were were 1500 drowned people. Most of all, what there was was TITANIC!

This is a NEWS Story that eclipses anything you could make up. UNSINKABLE!! And she went down, solely because of hubris and arrogance, on her FIRST VOYAGE!! She never completed one crossing.
I grew up fascinated by the disaster. It marked the end of the Guilded Age, it marked the end of the age of Iron, and it marked the end of mankind's smug assumption that it could do 'anything.'
It was an event of monumental significance -- and these hacks felt it needed to be 'enriched' with a stupid love story. And, because of that, the movie stretches On and ON and ON -- right down to the excruciating dying scene and ""I'll never let go."" (Spoiler alert: She lets go.)
And then that useless scene of Old Rose throwing the diamond overboard. Why? So we understand 'futility?' If 1500 dead people don't teach you that lesson, you're hopeless.

In 3D, the shots of the ship are amazing. They really should have just built the ship and offered cruises. I wanted more of that. The 3D works very well. It's subtle, simply providing depth. Once or twice things 'leapt out at you,' but mostly -- except for the MASSIVE shots of the ship, which are breathtaking in 3D -- you tended to forget it  was there. (That's GOOD!)
But, in one installment, or two, 2D or 3D, I felt this movie was an imposition. Sorry.",1390176000,6,2568,4.476495726495727
125925,5,0792151712,"I remember seeing this in the movie theaters with my friend in 1997. For its time, Titanic was one of the greatest movies of 1997 and still can't be topped - not even with James Cameron's Avatar (which some could argue.) There were techniques never attempted before and things never even done in special or visional effects in that year. The point of this movie is not about if history was correct (which one reviewer pointed out) it's about a love story on a doomed vessal. I've been studying the Titanic since I was 8 years old. The whole tragedy both facinates and stirs emotion, just like it did the many years ago when I saw this movie in theaters. I was only 12 years old at the time, I'm 29 years old now. So it seems like forever ago. Some of these reviewers who rated it a one, just by the typing alone are either done by trolls or done by kids who were only just born in 1997. Which, you have to understand - at the time of this films release - it WAS something never attempted or done before. Titanic opened the doors to more advanced technology and effects done in later films. Another gripe I have with other reviewers is speaking ignorantly about actors - keep in mind they were going to get Tom Cruise (or Brad Pitt, one of the two) and Madonna to play Jack and Rose. Leo and Kate were cast perfect for the parts and their on-set chemistry was flawless (at least in my oinion) we all will see a movie differently but some of the reviews I've read are from people who evidently were only just born in 97 or younger. Stick to Justin Bieber movies that are less complex for your comprehention.",1390003200,,1605,4.317880794701987

Leo and Kate were just as much fun to watch and my emotions were just as strong watching the stupid, arrogant, and negligent mistakes that were made that caused such a disaster.  Also, the selfishness and lack of compassion on the part of those in the lifeboats was just as disturbing...certainly a testimony to the fallen nature of man except for the few who had mercy and cared about others besides themselves. That much of this lack of compassion was based on the artificial ""barometer"" of class was appalling and still is.  Guess it will always be with us, sad to say.",1387497600,2,727,4.451127819548872

Titanic is one of my favorite movies. Ive seen it multiple times. Every time I watch it I find something new and something interesting that I didn't see the time before. One of my top favorite moments in the movie is when Jack Dawson sees Rose for the first time. The way he looks at her seems so real and he looks so mesmerized by her. Their love story is what makes me watch this movie over and over again. I love how Jack is the one who is so fascinated by Rose but as they get to know each other Rose ends up falling in love with Jack. Jack seems so humble and isn't afraid or embarrassed to show and talk about where he comes from. On the other hand Rose seems so sick of all the money Cal has. She shows that she is fed up with Cal and her mother treating her like a child when Rose feels like a grown woman. I think her mother has a big part on Rose being the way she is. My favorite character in this movie is definitely Jack Dawson. He stands up for what he believes in because nobody is holding him back. His art work makes him who he is, because he has seen so many women and know what real women are with real money. Hes shown to be very respectful to everybody even if others are rude to him. Another favorite scene of mine is when Rose is having tea with her mother and the other ladies. Rose notices the little girl across her table and realizes that girls are taught to be such delicate people from a young age; as they grow older they're not aware of what they have become or who and what surrounds them in the real world. And that it is not all about the money but about love. Another scene I like is when Jack is invited to dinner with the high class people and once the dinner is over Jack invites Rose to a real party. I love this part because it just shows that being rich and having class isn't always fun. You can tell she had fun because there was no one there telling her how to act, how to eat, stand, walk and so on. She just enjoyed her time with the rest of the people without thinking about it. Titanic has to be one of my favorite movies of all time. The acting, the actors, the plot, the overall message in this movie is what stands out to me the most. Not everything has to be about the money but about those who truly care about you and those who love you when its all gone before our eyes.",1386460800,,2385,4.033755274261603

I saw it when it first came out in 1997 with my parents and again when it got remastered in April of 2012.  Ironically I had seasonal allergies that day I went to see it.  I had to bring a box of tissues with me to the theater at which time I told the box office attendant when I went to buy the tickets for Titanic that I had allergies and the tissues were for that.

Great sound, great picture and the story was nice too. Titanic is a modern day classic...there's a reason it grossed so much at the box office! SPOILER ALERT: The ship sinks at the end.

My one and only regret/disappoint was that the DVD does not include a lot of extras. The two disc set is for the movie and deleted scenes only. The Blu-ray version is jam-packed with extras and for an extra bit of money I should have went that route. Had I known there were so few special features I would have.

126118,1,0792151712,"At what point does telling a fictional love story wrapped in the middle of an actual tragedy cross the line? The answer is of course, James Cameron's Titanic. Finding true love and one's personal inner fire is both personal and intriguing. There are many of us trying to find that every day of our lives, but to use the backdrop of one of historys worst maritime disasters to tell that story is callous, very callous. Cameron won the accolades of his Hollywood peers and a very big paycheck. Yet, the story, the real story of the loss and pain of the Titanic still eludes us and perhaps always will. So many different accounts of the few whom survived and the lack of technical recording equipment will leave this disaster's true horrors locked within history. No fanciful love story can or will give a respectful tribute to those who died that night. Fans of this film will claim it's only a movie - NO it's not just a movie according to James Cameron; he actually believes this film is a true telling of what happened and envelopes the confusion and pain that must have permeated the Titanics Crew and Passengers that night. I have a hard time believing Cameron's assertion. It's nothing more than a fanciful love story wrapped in the center of a maritime disaster that took the lives of 1,514 people. If that is what it takes to sell a movie ticket and make a name for yourself in Hollywood - then perhaps the industry as a whole is ripe for downfall.  Whats next a love story amidst the holocaust in Auschwitz?

As Cameron accepted his Academy Awards for this film he gave a very middle finger vindictive, ""I'm King of the World"" declaration to many who were in the audience that night whom had openly doubted and derided him about the film. And I do wonder, would he say the same, if in the midst of that audience there sat the 1,514 people who died that night?",1384732800,5,1866,4.501474926253687

Titanic is a 1997 American epic romantic disaster film directed, written, co-produced, co-edited and partly financed by James Cameron. A fictionalized account of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, it stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage.

Cameron's inspiration for the film was predicated on his fascination with shipwrecks; he wanted to convey the emotional message of the tragedy and felt that a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to achieving this. Production on the film began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. The modern scenes were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. A reconstruction of the Titanic was built at Playas de Rosarito in Baja California, scale models, and computer-generated imagery were used to recreate the sinking. The film was partially funded by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox, and, at the time, was the most expensive film ever made, with an estimated budget of $200 million.

Upon its release on December 19, 1997, the film achieved critical and commercial success. Nominated for fourteen Academy Awards, it won eleven, including the awards for Best Picture and Best Director, tying Ben Hur (1959) for most Oscars won by a single film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, it was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It remained the highest-grossing film of all time, until Cameron's 2009 film Avatar surpassed its gross in 2010. A 3D version of the film, released on April 4, 2012 (often billed as Titanic 3D) to commemorate the centenary of the sinking of the ship, earned it an additional $343.6 million worldwide, pushing Titanic's worldwide total to $2.18 billion. It became the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide.

This DVD is a ""must-have"" for any true movie collector.",1381968000,,2071,5.064516129032258

126190,1,0792151712,"I hate this movie and it is at least refreshing to find out I am not the only one. It is an insult to the public and an insult to those who died on the actual Titanic.

Let's look at the plot first. The premises are stupid. They attempt to turn one of the great tragedies in history into a saccharin sweet fantasy love story but I don't buy it. The sexual affair the two protagonists have is improbable enough - but improbable romances do happen. But the concept that this woman carries a torch for the young man for 70-80 years or however long it was is stupid. That is never going to happen because NOBODY is THAT good looking or that fantastic a lover or that anything, to the extent that you spend a couple of days and one night with them and then pine for them for almost a century. Millions of women lost their partners in the great war that followed, or the next one, or through any number of accidents or events and they moved on. This kind of thing does not happen. I don't recall if the rest of her life was dealt with, but what did she do? Stay a spinster her entire life? Dishonor whatever man she did marry by holding the object of a short affair in higher regard? The final scene where she throws the piece of jewelry into the ocean is the final insult to intelligence and just drives a nail in the coffin.

The producers apparently feel no compunction about knowingly slandering the crewmen who also gave their lives in the sinking. I guess they assumed that because those or any surviving crewmen were already dead, there was no reason to not insult their memory or their surviving families and descendants. Because there never was the least evidence that lower class passengers were locked in, and subsequent dives on the actual wreck confirm this.

From start to finish this movie is typical of the disrespect that Hollywood has for the public but all I can say a fool and their money are soon parted.",1379721600,6,1919,4.384831460674158

126242,5,0792151712,"Titanic's biggest flaw is that it is too big. Too big, too popular, too famous, and too profitable. The hype, the hate, and the endless parodies have made us lose sight of what was, at that time, the greatest motion picture spectacle on earth.
Flaws aside (and there are plenty), Titanic remains one of the most affecting blockbusters of all time. A touching love story merges almost seamlessly with awe-inspiring spectacle and heartrending action. The human drama of Spielberg merges with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/James-Cameron/dp/B0037NVM2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">James Cameron</a>'s own unsurpassed action and suspense (Aliens? Most action-packed movie of all time.) to create a half oldschool, half newschool epic.

This is one of those movies, like Shakespeare in Love, that get's a lot of bad hype BECAUSE it was hyped to the moon. Come back, I urge you, with an open mind, and you will find that the CGI is still amazing, the climax is still heartrendingly horrific, and Jack and Rose's (arguably the most famous duo in movie history) starcrossed romance is still affecting, and -- oh, is that a tear in my eye? Of course not, because real men don't cry in Titanic. It is scientifically proven that women are 97.77% more likely to cry during Titanic. And you can quote me on that.

Castwise,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leo-DiCaprio/dp/B000OLRH10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leo DiCaprio</a>&nbsp;bears the brunt of the criticism, because, let's face it: he's a little annoying, and it would still be a couple years before DiCaprio matured into the brilliant star of Blood Diamond and The Departed.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kate-Winslet/dp/B001VEE5KK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kate Winslet</a>&nbsp;fares better as Rose (it's impossible not to feel sympathetic towards her when she's swimming around with an axe in subzero waters), but it is the supporting cast -- Billy Zane, Kathy Baker, Bill Paxton, and Bernard Hill in a stunning performance as Captain Edward Smith -- that really impress.

Admittedly, the first half of the film is thin. Something about a submarine, and a bit of social drama, some love story and suspense thrown in for good measure (Because we all know how the story will end, right?)...I guess this is the ""melodrama"" part of Titanic, and this is done oldschool style. Still, a leetle slow. But's when we reach night time on the 4th day of HMS Titanic's maiden voyage, that TITANIC transforms from a sentimental sweet social drama/romance to an absolutely brutal and heartrending spectacle of horrific action. The sinking scene will still put you on edge and send shivers up your spine. The unthinkable tragedy of the event combined with the human element makes one of the most poignant climaxes in blockbuster history. The CGI supplements the sets and amazing acting, and, if you don't feel even an invisible tear in that horrific scene where everybody drowns in their rooms...then, well, you don't have a heart.

The story is _absolutely_ predictable, and Titanic almost flaunts this. Cameron uses every trope and trick in the business to wring emotion from us, ranging from the sentimental, to the sweet, to the cliched. But unlike any other film of the sinking of HMS Titanic, TITANIC is the only one to mix social commentary and emotion, as well the world's greatest, most terrifying sinking ship scene ever filmed. The result? We feel terribly sorry for the people on that boat.

CONS: Corny, predictable, hasn't 100% stood the test of time, ""I'm king of the world!"" is worst line EVER, ending is somewhat sentimental.
PROS: Spectacle, romance, great acting, something for men AND women, action, drama, melodrama, scope...what MORE could you ask for in a blockbuster?

In conclusion, Titanic has not fully stood the test of time, and many of us are forgetting how damn impressive it actually was back in 1997. This is a huge crowd-pleaser, as evinced by it's 2 billion dollar payoff, as well as a critic pleaser, as shown by it's impossible 11 Oscars! Overrated? Yes. A hugely affecting blockbuster of heart and drama, touching and melodramatic, yet terrifying and gutwrenching and brimming with impressive spectacle? Yes, yes, and yes.

Titanic is truly a TITAN of a film. 4.5 stars.",1378339200,,4372,5.44903988183161
126243,5,0792151712,"Its not a romance, its not a documentary, neither is a horror, yet James Cameron weaves all of these elements into his harrowing, haunting tale.  The historical facts are all in line, the romance is a pleasant touch, and there is just enough suspense to keep you captivated but not repelled.

126245,5,0792151712,"Sometimes I am just a sucker for a good love story.  And getting one set on such a historic vessell (brief as it's history may be)...well, who can beat that?  This film's $200,000,000 budget was worth every penny.  Not only could you find yourself rooting for these star-crossed lovers from minute #1, but the amazing set design and special effects showed us just how expansive the mighty ocean really was, even for a ship as grand as the Titanic.  This was especially prevalent when this mighty vessel met her ultimate and, if you know anything about history, inevitable fate on April 14, 1912 (if I just spoiled the movie for you, my apologies.)  Nevertheless, you find yourself rooting for these characters and their journey to America.  That can only be possible because of the 120% effort that was put into absolutely every aspect of this movie.  I don't even know how anyone could ever do a remake of this down the road (I'm not counting the 3-D version that came out last year.  I'm talking about someone doing this film all over again.)

Keep in mind I didn't see it in theaters for the 3D release, but I was just so blown away at how incredible it looked on screen. It has of course been remastered in HD so the quality is incredible, and the stunning 3D just topped it off. On top of the movie itself, the bonus features are incredible, I was fairly certain the content wouldn't be features I hadn't seen, but they most definitely were. Plenty of never before scenes that, in my opinion, changed the story quite a bit so it was really interesting to see how Jim Cameron cut them out.

126268,3,0792151712,"Titanic is about the idea that love conquers death. It demonstrates this idea with a love story between Jack and Rose that has its ups and downs but is sealed with Rose's decision to stay on the sinking ship and risk death rather than escape the Titanic alone. Jack returns her love in kind by saving her from freezing but dying in the process. Rose remembers her love for almost 80 years and returns to the spot Titanic sank to throw a priceless diamond into the ocean in memory of Jack. The main plots of their love and Jack's doomed escape from Titanic are supported by additional plots of Hockley's escape from the ship and the treasure hunters search for the diamond.

The story's focus stays true to the main love and escape plots that constitute the idea that love conquers death (love endures despite and because of Jack's death). The side plots provide fuel for the main turning points and add the final clincher of Rose remembering her love for decades by throwing away the diamond in memory of Jack. James Cameron really knew what he was doing with the story and it shows in the Story Chart.

126375,5,0792151712,"Finally, after a long time, my ""TITANIC"" DVD arrived safely, and in good conditions. Just as I expected.
There were a few problems/delays, due to the way the ""traditional"" postal service works but, thankfully, all the problems had been solved.
What else to say? Well, a movie like ""TITANIC"" doesn't need any special reviews/comments, as everyone knows what a masterpiece this movie had been, and how it changed so much the movie history.
What I like to say, though, about this DVD edition (the first Paramount's 1999 ""now out-of-print"", non-anamorphic, single disc edition) is that, unlike all the re-releases, special editions, remastered editions, that had been coming out in this last decade, this DVD release, besides the old Dolby Digital/DTS Laserdisc editions, is the only DVD edition to contain the ""unaltered"" original theatrical Dolby Digital 5.1 mix, as was heard by many people back in 1997/1998.
Forget about the Blu-Ray DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix, or the PCM mix you heard at the 3D re-release screening of the movie. Those are all remastered/post-edited mixes of the original.
Every single detail, effect, and depth is all here, in this Dolby Digital mix. The dialogues are crystal clear, the beautiful James Horner music spread out throughout the soundfield, making an enveloping rich experience, and every single cracking wall, crack, during the sinking of the ship, is horrifying, specially when the ship falls down deep in the abyss. You clearly hear every single piece falling down.
That said, if you're looking to re-experience ""TITANIC"" in all its glory, as you experienced back in 1997/1998, then get this DVD (or the Dolby/DTS Laserdisc edition, if you have the player).",1373068800,,1695,5.167272727272727

I'm a stereoscopic geek, so my plan was to watch the movie and constantly judge the job the artists did. But after an hour, I had given up, and was simply immersed in the story, which of course is enhanced by the stereoscopic depth (if you disagree with ""of course 3d is better than 2d"", then go ahead and skip my review, you cyclops).

I only wish J. Cameron had taken the opportunity and George Lucased the old CGI ship shots, and made them more realistic than was possible in 97.  Cause I gotta tell ya, that ship kinda looks like something out of GTA IV on my big LG monitor; pretty dated!",1372636800,,708,4.3893129770992365

126459,4,0792151712,"It has been over 15 years since I first saw ""Titanic"" in theaters.  While age and cynicism don't have me as enthralled about the movie as I was back then (I was 21 when it came out), I still find it to be a very entertaining saga of the infamous 'night to remember'.  There are obvious flaws in this rendition of the epic sinking.  One is the focus on the young couple of Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio, in a role that swore me off his acting until ""Catch Me if You Can"") and Rose Dewitt Bukater (Kate Winslet).  For the younger audience, the tale of young, forbidden love is enormously appealing, even it's a particularly underwhelming love story.  It distracts from the many other captivating stories that could have been told (and were told in an earlier Titanic film, based on the Walter Lord compilation ""A Night To Remember"").

  However, great plot and character development have never been director James Cameron's strong suit.  Where Cameron excels is in pure filmmaking that is able to create immersive transcendent environments and worlds (""Aliens""?  ""Avatar""? anyone?).  The effects he developed in recreating an incredibly authentic 'unsinkable' ship make the audience feel the terror and drama as the Titanic's final moments waste away.  I still enjoy embracing this experience many years later.

  The characters are largely hit and miss.  Aside from the youthful appeal of Jack and Rose, they are largely uninteresting couple; and, for all the talent DiCaprio displayed before and after ""Titanic"", his acting is pretty hard to stomach here.  Winslet does a much better job in a largely thankless role.  Billy Zane chews the scenery as Rose's controlling fianc&eacute; Cal, and Danny Nucci is one of the worst, most stereotypical caricatures ever as Jack's friend, Fabrizio.
  There are also major misfires with historical figures, such as the inaccurate and slanderous portrayal of First Officer Murdoch and omitting the heroics of Second Officer Lightoller.  Cameron did manage get it right with the nobility of the ship's band continuing to play while Titanic foundered, and illustrating White Star Line executive J. Bruce Ismay's cowardice in escaping while so many others died.

  While it may seem like I am eviscerating ""Titanic"", that is far from the case.  I'm only highlighting some of the shortcomings in a film that still remains a very compelling piece of entertainment all these years later.",1371600000,,2420,5.05050505050505

126461,5,0792151712,"This film was a classic the moment it was ""put into the can"" and released. It contained all the elements of the previous ""Titanic"" films yet more.

The only gimmicky use of the 3D was the intentional ""pop-out"" of the Blu-ray menu, otherwise, the use of 3D in the Blu-ray version of Titanic was tastefully used to enhance immersion into the movie.",1368921600,,623,4.473684210526316

This is a fictional account of two young people of very different backgrounds, who find one another on the doomed Titanic, among a variety of humanity, from the impoverished to the callous wealthy. The story begins and ends on the Titanic, except in the heart of the one who survives.  The music is inspiring in itself, enhancing the sense of grandiosity the ship embodied.

126900,1,0792151712,"When I first heard about this movie coming out, I was very excited.  After I saw it, all I could only think about was what it should have been.  Here you have one of the most fantastic stories of all times, a mega budget, and all we get is a ridiculous fictitious love story, and oh-by-the-way a ship that was considered unsinkable goes down on its maiden voyage.  Don't get me wrong, I think romance movies are great (one of my all-time favorite movies is ""Casablanca"").  However, in this case making the story of the sinking of the Titanic into a made up love story is just plain dumb, and as another reviewer said, an insult to those who lost their lives on that tragic night.

The actual story of Titanic's sinking is incredible, and there are so many fascinating facts about it. None of this is in the movie.  Instead, all we get is a syrupy romance which had an element of the ridiculous, such as the chase scene through knee deep water with Rose's fiance trying to kill Jack (I was rooting for that to happen).  I could list many other examples, but you get my point.

And then there is the character of Rose - here she is engaged to marry someone else, and almost the first thing she does when on board the ship is to ditch him, go around with Jack, pose naked for him and then have sex.  There are many words I could use to describe her, none of which should be used for an Amazon review.  Let's just say one of those words begins with a silent W.

James Cameron is probably the most over rated director of our time.  His two biggest movies are Titanic and Avatar, the latter being the WORST written big budget movie of all time.  I've often said that Hollywood uses special effects way too much to cover up bad acting, bad writing and bad directing.  This should be Cameron's epitaph.

If you want a really good movie about the actual sinking of the Titan, see ""A Night To Remember"", a low budget British movie from the 1950's based on Walter Lord's book.  Even adjusting for inflation, this movie's budget was a small fraction of this clunker, but way better.",1364601600,3,2070,4.365535248041775

126943,5,0792151712,"I have owned this move on DVD back in the day. While this is a great movie, I won't get into the film itself, just more of the Blu Ray Quality.

I do own a 3D TV, I must say that the 3D version of the movie is not impressive, there is no pop out effect, ""some might call it gimmick"" but some movies just have no business being in 3D. The only part that looks good in 3D out of the whole 3 hour movie, is the sinking part, and it's only when Rose is ""saving jack"" from being held as a prisoner.

The quality of Blu Ray, as far as the 2D image is awesome. It creates a GREAT sound, depth, and the movie looks as if it was shot in 2009, much closer than 1995-1997. However it does make old Rose's wrinkles look much worst because of the clarity. If you are a movie collector, I recommend owning the Blu Ray version of Titanic.",1363910400,,823,3.9221556886227544
126944,5,0792151712,"By Darrell Stoddard, darrellstoddard@gmail.com

""Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."" In the history of the world, the best example of giving ones life to save the life of another is found in the true story of the Titanic disaster; not the OK fictional story of Jack and Rose on the Titanic, but the true historical event of so many men giving up their seats in the lifeboats to save the lives of women and children.

Next to the story of the Titanic about people willing to die to save the life of others, is the sculpture of the ""Burghers of Calais"", and a 12 minute film entitled ""Greater Love.""

The story of the ""Burghers of Calais"" is found in a sublime sculpture by the artist Rodin  It is a monument to an occurrence in 1347 during the Hundred Years' War, when Calais, a French village was under siege by the English for over a year. England's King Edward offered to spare the people of the city if any six of its top leaders would surrender presumably to be executed. Edward demanded that they walk out wearing nooses around their necks to give their lives for their village. It is reported that they actually did this and then were spared by the intervention of England's Queen who persuaded her husband to exercise mercy by claiming that their deaths would be a bad omen for her unborn child.

No less than the above, is the simple story told in a 12 minute film called ""Greater Love"" which is about a little girl who gives a blood transfusion to save the life of her brother. Believing that the transfusion would end her life, she then asks the question. ""When am I going to die?""

To give ones life to save the life of another is reflection of the Atonement of Jesus Christ who died that we might live after death. This even ""greater love"" that God has for his children is represented in a ten minute film called ""The Bridge"" which is the story of a father who operates a railroad bridge. When his little boy comes out on the RR tracks of the bridge, the father must make a decision of whether to save the people on the train (you and I and everyone who has ever lived) or to sacrifice his son. He allows his son to die for all mankind to live. ""For God so loved the World that he gave his only begotten son..."" Jews and Muslims relate the story to Abraham's offering his son (Isaac or Ishmael) as a sacrifice. ""The Bridge"" is an even better analogy and schoolmaster because no lives were being saved by Abraham's sacrifice. The film is a bridge between man and God, a bridge between our mortal life and a life after death, and a bridge between Christians, Jews, and Muslims. For these reasons, I believe ""The Bridge"" is the most important motion picture ever produced.

126983,4,0792151712,"For years, I watched Titanic as it came on TV and grew annoyed at its cheesy and predictable storyline.  In 2012, I took a chance on the film and went to see it in theaters.  While I'll have respect for the film's music, the film itself wasn't as impressive.  However, as I sat in the theater with my fiancee watching the film, a new-found sense of awe came over me.  I was able to see the film as it was meant to be seen, in theaters, and instead of being unimpressed as I had before, I enjoyed the movie and got an understanding for why so many enjoyed it.  I purchased it on Blu-Ray in hopes my awe would remain intact.  Indeed, it has.

From the moment the disc starts, the high-def imagery and sound catches you and keeps you involved in the film that's been called ""a timeless classic"" to ""your typical romantic story"".  While it doesn't capture everything I experienced in theaters, which most likely will never happen, the beauty of the colors and visual effects as the Titanic sinks and people die still caused me to pause and feel helpless.

If you are a movie enthusiast, I highly recommend giving this version a shot and seeing if it changes your opinion of the film.  The extra features takes you into the world of making the highest grossing Best Picture winner and shows the many things they did in this pre-cheap CGI world.  If you walked out of the film humming the tunes, you have no excuse for passing this up.",1362960000,,1429,4.395437262357414

The Blu-ray 3D was not that great to me compared to other original 3D movies because the 3D effects didn't look so effective. Lots of scenes are just looking as if it is in normal picture. Even some of the most important and prime scenes still looks normal which was actually supposed to be coming very close to the audience to get that 3D effect.
The Blu-ray version is very good, the colors are so vivid and it really looks High Definition. Both the 3D and Blu-ray versions, has superb digital audio surround sound(I have a Bose Home Theater system and it was a GREAT experience).
Overall i am giving 4 stars because the movie is 100% worth buying and a must have in your movie collection, the reason why i didn't give  5 stars is because i was not so impressed with the 3D version.",1362355200,,924,4.4035087719298245

Very few scenes with pop-out effects, with the only one I can remember being from when a gun is shot into water and it splashes out a little.

Having seen this movie many times I was getting bored with it. However; seeing it in 3D made it enjoyable all over again. Now there are 2 minor issues to discuss. The 3D vesrion is on 2 discs so you need to change discs just when the movie was getting good. I expect the 3D version requires more space than a single disk provides. The second issue is the 3D effect is good but much more subtle than a 3D cartoon with things jumping out at you. However; the 3D efect improoves as the action increases on the second disk. If the water gets any closer you will get wet! The film also contains 2 aditional special feature disks to enjoy. I rateit 4 stars because I think they could made the 3D efects even more entertaining. The Blue-ray really makes everything sharp, clear and look amazing as if you were on board the Titanic. I do feel that your tv size makes a difference. Watching Blue-ray on a 32"" tv is nice but increesing the tv size to say 55"" makes a huge difference. You can really get into it and even feel like you apart of the film. Enjoy the movie!",1359158400,2,1184,4.243362831858407

Now we have money and no vision or concept. I really can't imagine who ""enjoys"" garbage like this unless it's those who think that reality TV is in any way associated with art or intelligence. This film drags on with no purpose whatsoever aside from CGI, diCaprio, and Winslet plus it plays fast and loose with history as well as reality. The acting is bad (at best) and the direction (if you can call it that) is asleep.

Far better films (all on DVD) of the Titanic sinking are ""Titanic"" (1943 German), ""Titanic"" (1953 with Barbara Stanwyck & Clifton Webb), and, best of all,  ""A Night to Remember (1958 with Kenneth More).

It was a real experience for me as i have not seen Titanic in awhile. So it was almost like watching it for the first time. The digital conversion was right up there withe the best.

TITANIC was one of those films that gave me a better understanding of life and death at a young age and it's one of those films to treasure at any age. On Blu-Ray you can certainly witness the beauty of TITANIC in the way you were meant to see it. I almost had to hold back tears when I saw the scene of Jack and Rose on the bow of the ship where Rose goes ""I'm flying,"" and then you see the amazing shot of the ship turning. Those were one of the experiences that I'll never forget from watching this film on blu-ray. Blu-Ray captures those moments in a way that you were meant to see it and it makes you feel like you're really there. I think the blu-ray version of TITANIC captures the experience of seeing the movie in the way audiences were meant to see it in 1997 when it was first released and I think this blu-ray version will stand the test of time for as long as blu-ray movies continue to be released.

However there are many events throughout the movie that were told by survivors to have happened as depicted. I recommend checking out IMDB for trivia, goofs and quotes.",1357689600,,459,4.7375

127442,3,0792151712,I do not own a 3D TV but bought this set anyways because I probably will own one in the future. I cannot tell you how the 3D is but the Blu ray looks grainy. Not Blu ray quality at all! My husband said I got ripped off and that the quality of the movie should not even get 1 star. I gave it 3 star because the movie is great but the Blu ray quality need to be worked on.,1357689600,,370,3.580246913580247

I was a bit hesitant on this one, as it was not filmed in 3D, but later converted. I was surprised at how good the 3D was. I had read from others that it was just OK, but perhaps everyone expects 3D to be like in the Avengers... It was like watching it again for the first time, and my wife and family loved it. I, Robot is another converted movie that I purchased, and it too is very well done. Beware though, as not all movies are converted to 3D with the same level of quality.

Many of the shots are just breath taking. I could be wrong but at the beginning of the movie they incorporated some footage from the movie Ghost of the Abyss and seeing the real Titanic at the bottom of the ocean in 3-D was jaw dropping. The movie is broken into 2 parts, Disc 1 . One a love story, two Disc 2 , a disaster thriller. Both parts are about as good as it gets. This for me is a real keeper. One note , the first time I went to watch it, it began freezing on parts of disc 1. I tried to contact the movie company with no luck, so I contacted Amazon customer service for help. The person I spoke to was great, when I explained my problem , he made arrangments to have the movie replaced. To that I say Thanks.",1357344000,,887,3.8

The picture quality is amazing and is crystal clear, they obviously spent lots of time getting this transfer to be as good as it could be. The DTS HD audio is also superb, lots of great sound and some nice surround effects as well as some nice LFE from the ships engines and the sinking sequences. If you like titanic you need to own this bluray.

The audio commentaries are also very cool, James Cameron's commentary is great and the the commentary with the two historians is good too, with lots of neat info and facts to go along with the movies.

127530,5,0792151712,"I received the Titanic 3D Bluray Edition as a Christmas gift from my husband. I was so excited to have it, I opened it immediately!

I half expected a booklet with details about the director, movie, etc. but unfortunately there wasn't. :(

Instead, there was a sheet of paper with the code for the DIGITAL COPY DOWNLOAD. Also included was the 3D DISK ONE, 3D DISK TWO, the 2D BLURAY DISK and finally, the SPECIAL FEATURES DISK. I was pleasantly surprised to see a new documentary titled ""The Final Word"" by James Cameron that contained new details on the current conditions of the Titanic and concluded mysteries surrounding the disaster.

I have yet to watch the 2D version of the film (obviously) but I must say the 3D was incredible! I do remember James Cameron stating that if he was to make Titanic in 3D, it would be of the BEST 3D quality. Bravo Mr. Cameron! He definately delivered!

The picture and the sound is brilliant. I have seen this film MANY times and outside of the theatre, this was the first time I got nervous watching it! The sound of the water rushing in, the ship breaking into two and the 3D aspect adding the feeling of really standing there with Jack and Rose got my heart pounding!

All around, this is a great buy/gift-especially on Amazon.com (19.99) and I truly LOVE IT!

Keep in mind that to view the 3D version of the film (and any 3D film) you MUST first have a 3D TV and a 3D bluray player. Otherwise, the disk will not work.",1357084800,,1460,4.42910447761194

The story is still great, and the 3D adds a whole new dimension to it (pun intended).

I have the DVD version and for the most part I like the movie but its not something I would watch on a frequent basis as I'm more of an action movie fan so am partial to James Cameron's other films like Avatar, Aliens, etc. However, I recently got a large 3D TV and a 3D blu ray player and after reading the rave reviews of the new 3D Blu Ray version of Titanic I decided to take the plunge and purchase this.  All I can say is - BAM! - it was like watching this movie for the first time again.  The 3D version blows the standard version out of the stratosphere!  The high definition is a serious upgrade from standard definition but the 3D takes it to another world.  This is what 3D is all about. The detail and depth bring out parts of the movie that I never caught the first few times I saw the movie.  The 3D draws you in and immerses you into the environment.  The depth conveyed during the sinking of the ship really brings out the intensity and enormity of the scene. I thought Avatar 3D was good and I thought Hugo 3D was good but Titanic 3D is at the top of my list right now for most impressive 3D.  If you have a 3D tv and a 3D blu ray player with 3D glasses then do not hesitate to get this blu ray especially if you liked this movie.",1356220800,,1298,3.9653846153846155

127663,5,0792151712,"So today I cracked the seal on what was an special treat to watch on my new 3DTV. I have to add that since I first saw Beowulf in 3D, I have become a fan of these movies in theaters but I missed Titanic after watching the blu-ray I wished I hadn't missed it in the cinema. The color, the picture quality, the incredible sound transfer is immaculate, so just watching this in blu-ray would be a treat, a movie that demanded Hi-Def treatment. I know James Cameron was very involved in the process of creating the 3D conversion and it shows,from the smallest vase at the edge of your screen to the grand staircase, to the engine room, you are drawn inward, immersed, you are a passenger. The effect was not so much to put things in your face like some gimmicky 3D films but to bring you aboard, make you a participant in what could be a modern day Romeo & Juliet, Tragedy of Epic porportions. I admit I saw this film 3 times when it first appeared in theaters but never once did I purchase the dvd and often skipped it on television so watching it again was a fresh trip back. I with all honesty and I don't like to get into all the technical jargon, you simply must experience Titanic 3D you will be taken away, you will walk the halls, climb the stairs, you will hang by the rails of the ship, stand behind Rose on the bow of the ship with her hands extended to the wind. Titanic 3D is a Dazzling Achievement of what can be done with loving care to detail in a 3D conversion and I would expect no less from the Maestro James Cameron.",1355875200,,1532,4.196610169491525

It doesn't over power the viewer with any of those over-the-top ""objects flying towards you"" type of 3D, but just provides an added depth that brings you into the film just that much more.  The fact that the 4 disc set provides a regular Blu ray option as well as the digital copy only adds to the value.

127672,5,0792151712,"I have always been mixed on Titanic. The technical aspects of the film are surely to be admired but the plot has plenty that legitimately could be criticized.  I won't really touch on that since our culture has had 15 years to decide if if Titanic is worthy of admiration.

The 3D conversion of this film was awesome to say the least.  The film itself was so bright and crisp it was like I was watching the movie for the first time.  There are few films that I can sit through for over 3 hours and this version of the film was one of them.

Someone really needs to ride herd on him when it comes to dialogue, and if Billy Zane and David Warner had switched roles this film would be flawless, but TITANIC is still entertaining as hell and both Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart together make a stunning Rose and one of them should have been recognized by the Academy.  DeCaprio does the best he can with some of the clunkiest dialogue he has ever been given, and he makes Jack a fun character that you really root for, so that when fate steps in, you feel for him.

127779,5,0792151712,"I would like to say first that THIS REVIEW IS STRICTLY ABOUT THE BLU RAY 3D PRESENTATION OF TITANIC and not the actual movie.
We loved Titanic and have waited for its blu ray release for a long time. After watching this on 3D, I must say, IT WAS WELL WORTH THE WAIT! The Blu ray 3D is that beautiful! Even if you have seen Titanic when it was re-released in 3D in theatres (April 2012), Do NOT give up on this 3D edition. The theatre 3D doesn't come any close to the picture quality and 3D depth you will feel here.
The 3D presentation of the movie is truly SPECTACULAR. It is so realistic in depth that you will forget the fact that this was converted from 2D to 3D. Every frame, every scene, and every moment tells you how much efforts have been put into making this edition so flawless. The color, contrast, sharpness and overall depth of the movie never loses its' grip from beginning to end. Last, but not the least, the SOUND! It's so immersive and realistic, you will thank yourself about this purchase after watching it at home. If you are a fan of this movie, you gotta have this in your collection. It is debatable that what format one would prefer for repeated viewing (2D or 3D Blu ray). However, if your preferred format is 2D, then watching this 3D once will surely make you think again about your preferences! (It's that good!)
Final Remarks:
Having seen many Blu ray 3Ds, I can certainly say that Titanic 3D offers one of the best 3D presentaions I have ever seen on Blu ray. The movie has been given a royal treatment (which it deserves) and this every bit of work reflects in every single moment on this Blu ray.

I know this a fictionalized work except for the iceberg, sinking and manufacturer's claim of ""unsinkable."" Two people who are now acclaimed actor's in their own right got started in their roles, Kate Winslett and Leonard DiCaprio. Romance and dramatic license make up the majority of this film around Titanic's actual date and cause of sinking. I recommend this movie for it's wealth of visual and auditory treats.

127804,5,0792151712,"Titanic is my favorite movie. It's got everything I could ask for: an epic setting, an engrossing romance, and historical resonance. By now the basic outlines are clear to most people. Where the movie shines is in the execution of each scene. The drama builds continuously, even with the end result assured. Mr. Cameron deserves credit for pulling off such a weighty subject so powerfully. He also deserves recognition for paying respects to the historical reality. The model of the ship is quite accurate, with one room having been created from the original blueprints. (I learned that on one of the behind-the-scenes feature on this Blu-ray set.) This movie is well-deserving of its long runtime, because it accomplishes so much.

I have been waiting for a high-definition version for years, and James Cameron took his time to release this copy. It's splendid. The extra features are entertaining. The documentary footage of the making of the movie humanizes its production, although it doesn't cast Mr. Cameron in a very flattering light. The movie itself looks brilliant at home. You have plenty of reasons to watch this again. Indeed, Titanic still blows away expectations.",1354320000,,1178,5.135416666666667
127805,5,0792151712,"In my opinion, after seeing the movie for the first time last night, and processing it with a more critical eye for most of today, Titanic is one of the finest films ever made (and I don't say that lightly), perhaps second only to Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo."" But Titanic has been praised in many reviews over the years (and put down in a few) so I won't go into much detail here. What I will talk about is this transfer, which is absolutely fantastic.

I started collecting blu-rays earlier this year, and I have around 70, ranging from the high-budgeted Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, to more modest films like True Grit and Memento and I can say that, video-wise, Titanic is the clearest blu-ray I have ever seen. The aspect ratio of the blu-ray 3D was changed by James Cameron by using the Super 35 film, which ""allows more information on the top and bottom of the screen without losing all that much on the sides,"" making the 3D blu-ray's aspect ratio 1.78:1. Cameron believed this would make for a more immersive 3D experience and it really does look great, but for purists, the traditional aspect ratio is preserved on the 2D disc.

This is indeed one of the best blu-rays out there (and judging from other reviews I'm not the only one who thinks so), so if you like Titanic, film history, or are looking for new movies to add to your collection I'd say take the plunge. (I did and I hadn't even seen the thing!)",1354320000,,1418,4.42911877394636

You should be able to see a recognizable difference in the Blu-Ray version.
I think that the studios are in too big of a hurry to pull more $$$$ in on previously released
movies without any additional effort on their part.

Reselling movies that were photographed in standard definition by putting them in a Blue Box and only recreating the menus DOES NOT MAKE IT A HIGH DEFINITION MOVIE. If it was shot in standard definition with standard everyday cameras then it will forever be in standard definition.

127866,5,0792151712,"TITANIC was just that. Escapist fare that served no other purpose than to entertain people. With a dash of 1940's sentimentality (the love triangle), and 2000 wizardry (the special effects), Titanic let's us leave the real world behind and sail off with Rose and Jack.

As other reviewers have rightfully cited, we all know the story by now.  This version of Titanic does not add anything except it serves up the solid facts of what happened that April night back in 1912.  By creating fictional characters, it mysteriously manages to add to the story even though it neatly side steps most of the real passengers who were on board that faithful night.

So, leaving the script and acting off to the side, I will comment on this Blu-ray version of the classic.

In short, it is nothing but magnificent.  The images are crisp, clean and accurate. Now, Cameron did not go in for much in the way of color.  Yes, the iconic images of ""I'm Flying"" were painted in golden hues but the bulk of the movie is in white, black and various shades of grey.  But this DVD makes the colors and images so vivid and sharp you feel you can reach out and touch them.  When you do get into a more colorful area (Rose's cabin suite, for example), your eyes almost pop out from the lush richness of it all.

A brilliant job of remastering and restoring.  The sound, however, could use some major tweaking but, on the whole, the story is now officially a classic and this Blu-ray version has assured its place there.",1353801600,,1491,4.526119402985074

I'm no expert at the art of 3D,  but my whole family felt the same way--blah. There was added depth to certain scenes, but the majority of it seemed like normal 2D to me.

As of recently I have been purchasing many 3d DVD's And this movie by far is the absolute best I've own or have ever seen in my life. I have 20  3D Blu ray movies, and with Titantic this movie has become the disk to showcase the 3D technology in my home entertainment system.

As i mentioned above in this review i have been buying many 3D movies as of late, and just tonight i watched two movies and then laid in bed. As i was in laying there i started reading more reviews on Titanic 3D in blu ray, after reading a lot of good reviews i got up and popped this movie in. As i was opening my new movie case to Titanic 3D i grabbed the part two disk and played it, instantly i was Blown away!!! By the picture quality the vividness  and the immersion i was thrown into, absolutely blown away with what I saw.

There has been some talk about how 2D to 3D conversation was not of good quality, but with this conversion it is (in total aspect of a converted movie) flawless.

Ok not to keep you reading this for too long, ill just get to the point.  The acting and story line is grate, but I'm sure you want to know about the 3D quality of this movie. With this movie being in full screen you'll seriously feel as if you are actually in the movie with the actors, with this movie in a way so to speak it will take you back in time and place you on/in the Titanic.

Every 3D movie on blu ray should be of this quality. After seeing a 3D movie this good everything else will be substandard.

Im going to end this review with a few points i would like to stick with you. The scenes seems to be to scale are very realistic.

When there are still camera shots in conversions it truly feels like you're in the room and taking part in the conversation.

This movie is a true must have for any home with a 3D TV.  Buy this movie and you will believe what I have written is true, you will enter this movie.",1353196800,2,2041,4.149746192893401

Some of that sweeping cinematography is bound to be lost on a home screen, but home surround-sound can do a nice job on its Oscar-winning Best Sound.

Seasoned KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Raven D calls Titanic a ""romantic masterpiece."" The film evokes strong emotion partly because of the real-life tragedy it recreates but also thanks to the intimate love story Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet bring to life. That the film is 15 years old does not diminish its impact. Says Raven, ""... even though I've seen it about a billion times, I still get choked up."" On a scale of one to five, she rates it a five only because higher numbers aren't available.

Titanic is my favorite movie by far. This romantic masterpiece starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet tells a tale of love, loss and tragedy. I remember the first time I watched Titanic. I was 7 years old, and I've been hooked ever since. This was the first film that really made me cry, and even though I've seen it about a billion times, I still get choked up.

This movie is beautifully done. I love that the cinematography is so grand and breathtaking even though the film came out in 1997. I especially love the way they capture the Titanic in all its glory. I'm a total history geek when it comes to the Titanic. I've seen every documentary and read every book there is to read about the Titanic, so the fact that they used actual footage of the wreckage of Titanic was really cool.

My favorite characters are Rose and Jack, of course! They defy the rules of their different social statuses and are in true love. Not only are those characters great, but Kate and Leonardo do a masterful job in these roles. I love the whole movie, but my favorite scene would have to be when Rose and Jack are running through the ship away from the butler after the drawing scene. It lightens the mood of the film before the sinking and is quite funny. Plus, you almost get a mini tour of the ship. I also admire the final few scenes in which the ship is sinking. The way it is captured is amazing. It's the perfect mix of chaos and emotion, which really conveys the tragedy in a brilliant way.

Like I said, this film is very tragic, and that fact that it was an actual event makes it even more sad. I would recommend this film for all ages, even though it is sad and slightly inappropriate. I watched it when I was 7 and nothing bothered me. This is a must-see movie, and I give it five out of five stars. I'd give it more if I could! Titanic is in stores now on DVD and Blu-ray, so be sure to add it to your home movie collection today!",1351468800,,2967,4.43302752293578
127957,5,0792151712,"First of All we all know Titanic is a masterpiece so that saves me the explaining. The 3D adds new light to this already classic, and makes an interesting watch again and again. Highly recommend this as an upgrade to your old version.",1351382400,,234,4.465116279069767

James Cameron delivers a classic and one of the best films of all-time. I love the story in the movie.  The class distinction.  How could they miss the iceberg in the movie?  They should have seen the iceberg coming.  The special effects are amazing and a groundbreaking film and the one of only three movies to win 11 Oscars.

I love Titanic and it is a classic movie.
A MUST SEE FILM.",1351036800,2,535,4.186274509803922
127994,5,0792151712,"Overall, hands down, this movie has all the elements I'm looking for. The best actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), the best actress (Kate Winslet), and the best supporting cast of all time. I mean, Mali Finn really did a stunning job casting actors and actresses that resembled their real life counterparts. Isn't it amazing how similar Kathy Bates compares to the real Molly Brown? Even Mr. Ismay and Mr. Andrews had actors that portrayed them really well. I could say the same thing for the rest of the cast.

Thematically, this film was everything beyond it's time, and I think it's everything beyond our time today. Avatar is an exception, as there are many recurring themes throughout both movies (love, technology, man vs. nature, etc.) and the fact that James Cameron wrote them at the same time, still an amazing movie regardless. The fact that Titanic speaks on so many levels, and the fact that it was an event that really happened, makes this a journey I had to experience over and over. Of course, one of the reasons the story is so good is because DiCaprio and Winslet did an absolutely unbelievable job working together and putting out work that is instilled in all of us.

Visually, this film was years ahead of technological feats. I mean, for a 1997 film, they really went in and created lifelike digital water that could stand today. There are plenty of other feats they accomplished that were years ahead, but the most important part is that they did their job of engrossing us into the movie that makes us watch it over and over again.

All in all, this is a fantastic movie that will stand the test of time. The story captured us, the themes inspired us, and the drama overwhelmed us, but most importantly, was a powerful message: ""only life is priceless, and to make each day count.""",1350950400,2,1796,4.677215189873418

127996,5,0792151712,I can still remember the first time I saw Titanic. It is one of those movies that moves you and takes you to another time and place. Some say that men don't or shouldn't cry. I am not ashamed to say that I cried like a baby. It simply touched me in that way. It's a film that will always stay with me. Loved every minute of it.,1350777600,2,327,3.823529411764706
127997,5,0792151712,"Ok, I FINALLY found a Blu-ray that works with my recent laptop, an HP Pro-Book 4530s, with another 4g Ram for the movies and games. 8 total RAM.

This was a whole weekend process. Tiger Direct where I bought the laptop, couldn't make it run with Titanic, either. I LOVE extras, btw, for the most part. Not the commentaries, good ones are few and far between, but special FX tricks and stuff.

""And a little child shall lead them:"" I finally said, it's a store, let's find something this film works with and use that program. We found the Power DVD 12 on a Sony gaming laptop for 1200. The Arc Soft is a coaster, btw. HP really blanked up, there. Works with some things, not Titanic.

I had to buy the program, but I'm going to HI soon, and I REALLY want this to work by then. So, it's on sale for 82.00 now. Follow prompts, keep a printout of your key info (you'll need it) upload through your email, type in the keys, and away you GO. It skips a tiny bit when you start, may skip if you pause it to check something. It will come back. Try to hang out for the whole hour; the aprox. time of each chunk of special feature so far.

I used my ADORED Bose QC 12 noise cancelling headphones with an ext. Sound Blaster sound card (phones 299.00, ext. card, maybe 40.00). Nagging wife, plane rides, loud kids? Oh, you can't hear a damn thing with these things on. :)!!!! Even better, THEY can't hear YOU right next to you! :)!!! I have a nagging husband, and he always thinks I can hear him complain :) I turn down just enough so he doesn't gripe: ""You never listen...!"" Wah, wah, wah...just like a woman, he'd say.

Ok, I never cried for deleted scenes before. I started with the hour of ""Reflections on Titanic."" I had tears in my eyes from all the beauty in the sound, costumes, FX, everything. The soloist on the James Horner instrumental Titanic theme at the end gave me spine chills. As I said, make sure you are ready to watch the whole hour per chunk at once. Then I went to ""Deleted Scenes."" Cried endlessly from one end to the other, esp. at the end.

Scenes that got me, Rose's slow-mo flowing dress in the boiler room. The clip of the sounds of shooting and the ship's dying creaking and groaning. It ROARS with these headphones. It's ALIVE. Don't even bother without them. The gentle clinking on China in the water. The flares, color and sound. Molly Brown rowing made me laugh. Fabrizio and Helga; their love story.

Bothered by minor issues: the lifejacket put on the kid who ignored the ice warnings would've got caught in his headphone cord. Willing to go along with it. Cord wound up OVER the jacket. Wrong, but Ok. I don't think anyone would give up a lifejacket if they just got off a sunk ship. Had issues with no one finding Rose on the Carpathia. They'd have been on there a few days, and even a BIG boat isn't THAT big. I've been. They would've looked under ""Dawson,"" don't'cha think? But Ok again. I think it's like the stuff in the old Twilight Zone show. You don't care that Burgess Meredeth might have been irradiated right after he left the bank vault; the script was iconic, so who cares??

The dogs on the boat running of course, bothered me. Real dogs would've been a bit more panicked. They're not stupid. Could've used CGI there, but it was an outtake.

As for anyone who says Cal is overdone, trust me, LOTS of men are just like that. Ask a woman. That's just what he'd do, because like a rapist, it's about CONTROL and WINNING, not sex. Not love. If they find someone who goes along with it AT ALL, they will be unrelenting to ""get her back.""

I don't mind the Celine Dion song. She IS actually singing. Auto-tune is no different from lip-synching, and why's it OK for Grammys to go to ""singers"" who use it both recorded and live?? Which is 90+ percent of all ""performers?"" But Milli Vanilli's bad?? It's the same thing! Celine's vibrato, well, that's a real singer, and Auto-tune apparently can't make that happen. In fact, I can't get rid of my vibrato when I'd like to. Some songs are flatter in sound.

I think the Horner song in stunning with a real piano. I don't like it with Rose on the ship with the diamond where it's a keyboard.

Lots of stuff that was cut is rightfully cut, but much is still very moving. It's still all stunning in terms of cinematography and sound design as well as FX.

I didn't feel much as I do now, before I quit drinking and any other type of drug. The feelings scared me at first, but now I see so much more--it's why we all came here to this life. To love, to feel, even to cry and feel hurt. I was so afraid to feel, and today I felt like it was so needless. I loved crying from one end to the other, and it's not my habit at all. I normally hate the type of things that try to manipulate that. I felt more alive, closer to God. I didn't feel sad, I felt MOVED. There's a difference. All those who suffered on such a gorgeous ship. Pointless deaths. I felt they were all alive on God's other joyous plane, and that they...knew us, and loved that we cared, even a hundred years after they died. That they loved that their lives MATTERED; isn't that why we all do EVERYTHING? Why we have kids, make money, give money away?? To not be forgotten.

WELL worth the wait and the extra cost of the Power DVD 12.

Highly, HIGHLY recommend it !",1350691200,,5302,4.293293293293293

128000,1,0792151712,"THIS REVIEW AND RATING IS FOR THE BLU-RAY BOX SET PACKAGING--NOT THE MOVIE!  THE MOVIE DESERVES FIVE STARS.
I recently bought two Titanic Blu-ray box sets.  Both sets arrived with the cheaply made cardboard inserts mangled.  This set was evidently created by someone who had no experience in manufacturing design.  The book, blu-ray disc, and supplementary materials shifted around during shipping and damaged the interior of the box set.  $109.00 plus shipping is a lot of money to spend for an item that is poorly created.  Paramount should look at what Warner Brothers and Twentieth Century Fox have produced over the past few years.  ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Gone With the Wind"", and ""The Sound of Music"" were superior box sets compared to this flimsy produced product.  One of the Titanic box sets also had missing supplementary materials. (Titanic passenger dossier as listed on the back of the box.)  At least Amazon provided a prompt refund, but I had to package the product up, and take it to a UPS shipper.

Amazon produced this set in a very small production run.  The online price varies from day to day--from just over $100 to $300 or more.  Believe me, this box set is not worth more than fifty dollars!!!  Stay with the standard blu-ray disc only edition.  You will avoid many problems!!!",1350604800,10,1299,4.819004524886878

There is only one likable character in this film and that's Victor Garber's character. I wish they had focused more on his character since he's the one that built the titanic, but no we have to endure three hours of crap from Jack and Rose.

First of all that ""love"" story between the main two characters was stupid. Fall in love after two and a half days and she's already opening her legs in the back of a car. Ready to run off with Jack and doesn't know a damn thing about him besides he doesn't have a lot of money and he sketches. What does he like to eat Rose? What are his beliefs? Rose was a tease and a manipulative bitch throughout the whole film. How she just flaunted her being a big tramp in her fiance's face by putting the sketch of her nude in the safe along with a note. She knows Cal doesn't like Jack but Rose just flaunted Jack in his face. Just letting her fiance know that another man saw her naked that she's known for about two days. Cal should have thrown her ass overboard. Rose is no better than Cal she's spitting in his face, cheating, and giving people the finger, so classy.

Jack is no better either, knows Rose is engaged but had no problem sexing her and damn near stalking the slut every chance he got. It's like he couldn't go one second without seeing her, following her on every part of the ship.

I don't blame Cal at all for how he felt about those two twits. I would have tried shooting them too. Why would Cal waste his time trying to help Jack get on a boat, he slept with his fiance. Was Rose that damn naive to think Cal would extend an olive branch like that, Jack's right, ""she's stupid.""

All in all the film could have been great if they nixed the stupid love story and concentrated more on the history of the boat, the victims, and the survivors.",1350172800,3,1912,4.201634877384196
128048,3,0792151712,"Love the movie Titanic, and enjoyed watching it again, but the 3D is not jaw dropping by any means.  It does give a dimensional aspect that was not in the original but it's all going into the screen.  Nothing ever comes out at you, not even one little splash of water.  In Avatar, there was so much more dimension, but not here.  I think the difference is that when a movie is filmed in 3D it comes alive in that format.

I feel that blu-ray players with 2D to 3D conversion did better job. They were consistent during whole feature film.

In 3D movie, I feel many places cheap tricks used to convert 2D movie to 3D movie and DIFFERENT tricks, although the film producer might paid a lot money for that. The DIFFERENT tricks made the film looking horrible to me. I've very good 3D perception.

For this movie, I'll prefer DVD or blu-ray with 2D to 3D conversion next time.
Studio conversion of 2D to 3D is quite expensive, it used to be about $100,000 per minute. Sorry to say, I don't find it worth - it is OK for collection, not for viewing. The blu ray player 2D to 3D converters are doing consistent job giving better view.

128137,5,0792151712,"Titanic is one of the few 'chick flicks' love stories that I really enjoy watching, and back then when it was first released, it was spectacular.  The story is beautiful, emotional, thrilling, and heart wrenching at the same time.

Now, this has been made into a 3-D experience of a lifetime.  The picture clarity has gone beyond 'clear'.  It is now something beyond that, the picture is FLAWLESS.  Not a single smudge, blurr, or second out of focus, and the colors are absolutely vibrant with life.  The quality is so 'real', you are in the scenes able to just touch everything you can see.  This is only the second blue-ray/3D movie that I can say this about, out of dozens.  The sound is also incredibly immersive.  You have those quiet dialogue scenes, but when the music and excitement picks up, you are drowned out in special effects, background noises, and it's accompanying background music.  Seems to be genuinely theatre style.

The story itself is just truly an experience to have to watch.  You will forget you are watching a movie only until you are prompted to insert Disc 2.  And THAT is my only dislike about the DvD.  But when the back of the box says it is split into 2 DvD's for maximum quality, the producers were not lying.  It is maximum quality.  And on top of the 3D experience, you get a blue-ray 2D copy, and a digital copy as well.

If you enjoyed the movie Titanic, and are able to watch 3D, you will absolutely and without a doubt love the Titanic 3D experience.",1348790400,2,1491,4.52434456928839

Disclosure:  I received this DVD and a viewing kit  for review purposes only. I was not compensated to write a positive or favorable review. This is Keeping Up With The Rheinlander's personal opinion.",1348704000,,657,4.646551724137931
128139,5,0792151712,"If you are like me, you probably own the 2005 3 Disc Collector's Edition which includes the deleted scenes. Recently there were 3 releases of Titanic, one in just DVD format with no extras, a Bluray/DVD Digital Copy combo and a 3D/2D Bluray/Digital Copy combo. Unless you are an ardent fan like me of which this is a must have, then you are probably wondering if its worth the upgrade.

Well, when it comes to special features, there are two featurettes that look back on the legacy of Titanic everything else is from the 3 Disc collector's edition. These aren't featurettes that are like 10 minutes long. They are actually about 90 minutes long each. So you will have to decide how important these two extra features are in comparison to the 3 Disc set.

Now as for the movies themselves:

3D
Having saw Titanic 3D in theaters, I can safely say that the 3D presentation looked wonderful on my 32 inch Vizio 3DTV. The 3D makes you feel like you are part of the movie. James Cameron does not use any 3D gimmicks such as during the sinking water doesn't seem like its coming at you, instead it just makes you feel like you are on the ship. The 3D effects brings the background into formation and things you never really notice before become noticeable which is good.

Like the DVD though, the 3D movie is split on to 2 discs.

2D
Owning the 2005 DVD, I decided to compare the 2D bluray to the DVD and can definitely say that there is a quality difference. The Bluray looks much more crisp and makes the grand Titanic look far more grander.

As for the audio, I did notice on my old Magnavox blu ray player and Emerson 32 inch TV that the special effects were great but whenever people talked, it was bad. If you tried to turn it up, it made the special effects louder but the rest of the audio did not improve in the least. On my Sony 3D Blu ray player as well as on my Vizio 3DTV the 2D blu ray audio is vastly different. Maybe its the HD StudioSurround and TruSurround on my TV, but the audio is far better than it was on my old player and TV.

As for the menu, I haven't seen the new DVD's approach but I can say that I much prefer the menu style of the 3D/2D blu rays over my 2005 DVD.

All in all, its a great combo set. I'll still be keeping my 2005 DVD set even if it is moot. But as to the question of upgrading, I think it is definitely worth doing. If you own the DVD, go for the 3D/2D Blu ray set as you never know if you'll need 3D and there is no point in owning double copies in the same format. If you don't own Titanic at all, then you must weigh the option of having DVD or 3D Blu ray.",1348704000,6,2600,4.134653465346535

There is no jack/rose on the real titanic ship of course or nude paintings being drawn. All this is just done to add spice to the titanic movie by the movie director. Another discrepancy from the real account i read compared to the movie was that according to Geelan, when the titanic was standing upright in a 180 degree vertical position just before sinking, all its lights were on and shining bright. Geelan described it as a sight so marvellous yet so frightening. However, in the movie, it is shown that the electric circuits stop working some while back and when the titanic is vertical all its lights are gone. Another discrepancy, in the account there is no mention of an officer shooting himself, but the movie shows so. And the rescue ship that arrives at dawn is named 'carpathian' with a 'n' at the end in the account by Geelan.

While most of James Cameron's movies tend to be the same (two characters in love from different places who struggle to stay together i.e. The abyss, avatar and true lies) I like his movies a lot. While they push the boundaries on cutting edge technology and effects, they aren't just some blockbuster, special effects extravaganza for the sake of making money. They are stories with meaning, value and intent. The special features on this are a testament to that statement with specials like the hour and a half long documentary, the final word. This is a bunch of scholars, navy men and engineers along with James Cameron discussing the eye witness accounts of RMS Titanic survivors as well as tracking the debris field of the wreck to find out exactly how the ship sank and came to rest where it did and how maybe knowing all of this could have resulted in less lives being lost during the sinking of the ship. There is also a great chunk of 57 minutes worth of deleted scenes and plenty of other features. This movie pops on Blu-Ray and is well worth the affordable price. I didn't care much for this movie as a kid but as an adult I really liked watching this and like it more and more as I learn about how it was made.

128185,5,0792151712,"This is a review of the Blu-ray not the movie itself.  It was watched on a 59"" Samsung Plasma 3D television with a Samsung 3D Blu-ray player and a Yamaha 5.1 DTS receiver.  I've seen this film several times through the years on DVD.  If you are looking for a showcase for ""pop-out at you"" effects this is probably not it.  But the added clarity of the Blu-ray and the depth given by the 3D is absolutely astounding!  The first part of the film in particular, when the submersibles are searching the wreck, the added depth is incredible.  I found myself saying ""wow"" outloud numerous times.  I noticed a number of things I hadn't noticed before (including a reflection of the steady-cam as it approached one of the glass doors aboard ship).  The CG effects are slightly more noticeable on the Blu-ray but are not distracting.  The crispness of everything else makes up for it.  This was not a ""rush and slap it on a Blu-ray"" job.  This is a GREAT transfer!  And for us audiophiles it is a real treat as well.  From the great low-ends of James Horner's orchestrations to the ship breaking up around you it is bliss to the ears.  Even the subtle rumble of the ship's engines in the background is sweet.  There is an added bonus after all of the credits:  You'll be treated to an extended THX logo theme that will shake your house to it's foundation... in 3D of course.  This is a PERFECT showcase for a nice sound system.  Even without the 3D, this Blu-ray is definitely worth getting for the picture and sound improvement over the DVD.",1348099200,4,1533,4.472924187725631

128187,3,0792151712,"First off, I do love the film (have the DVD version) but I purchased the BluRay on the hype that it had 2-1/2hrs of additional footage. That's what it says on the front of the box... on the back it says 6 hours of bonus features. Well in reality, the movie is nothing more than a BluRay version of the original. Now you can argue that's all it should be!!.. The BIGGEST mistake was that the Studios missed a golden opportunity.... There are 30 deleted scenes, 30 COMPLETED deleted scenes in that ""additional footage"". Most of those scenes have actual value to the movie. The ending... OMG... the original filmed ending was way better than the released edited down version. If they had wanted to make a ""new"" version, well what they should have done is make an ""Extended Version"" or the ""Directors Version"" and included all those deleted scenes. I guarantee you'd have made a much more enjoyable and more accurate movie to the original Titanic. You'd have seen where Rose's blanket actually came from that suddenly appears when she and Jack are racing through the sinking vessel, you'd have seen where 3 of the passengers (one pertinent to Jack throughout the voyage before it hits the iceberg) actually died and why they suddenly appear on the Staircase scene at the end as the youthful Rose finally returns to the love of her life, you'd have seen when the radio operators used the then new Morse Code SOS signal, you'd have seen where the Titanic received a message warning them of icebergs but they overlooked the message in the demand to send cables worldwide from passengers, and as mentioned you'd have seen a more detailed ending (no spoiler... watch the deleted scenes if you're interested). Of course this is all my humble opinion. Clearly the story of Rose and Jack was a fantasy love story and brilliantly done but the denial of some of the factual events as well as other scenes important for continuity could have been corrected at long last.

Overall, this is a great movie but sadly disappointed at the studio hype to sell the BluRay version in the original released format. I think mature audiences would have enjoyed a little more than what this repackaging is. Simply put, I just don't think this version is worth it if you already have the DVD version.",1347926400,7,2271,4.69172932330827

My sole complaint about the sound is that the dialog sound level was too low compared to the non-dialog sound effects.  I had to turn down the volume during sound-effects, such as hitting the iceberg, breaking apart, etc., and turn it back up for spoken dialog.  I don't remember having this problem watching the DVD or in the theatre.

I cannot comment on the 3D version included in the same package, as I don't have 3D equipment.",1347753600,,557,4.701030927835052
128189,5,0792151712,"Titanic finally gets the DVD treatment its deserved after all this time.  This particular set is great as its got the BluRay discs as well as the DVD in case you have other players in the house that just have DVD players like I do.  There are so many extras and features on this set that you'll never get through it all in one sitting. There is one thing I noticed after watching the excellent four part feature set called ""Reflections on Titanic"" and that was where is Leonardo DiCaprio?  He is the only main player that is completely absent from speaking and contributing.  I thought that was odd.  Maybe he was asked and he said no or he was busy.  Other than that, this is still an incredible dvd set that delves into detail on the making of the movie and what they all went through.  There is also a nearly 2 hour documentary of an in depth look at the actual Titanic ship itself and how they attempted to solve the mystery of what really happened as if it were a crime scene.  This is hosted by the Director, James Cameron who you really appreciate his genius and intellect.  This documentary alone is already worth the price of this set.  The special features however can only be played on a BluRay player.  The DVD movie is just the movie.  There are also 60 other behind the scenes vignettes and 30 deleted scenes.  If you have a surround sound system then this is a movie you want to crank up.  It's as if you're on the ship with them.  This is definitely a keeper!  James Cameron did an exceptional job at including as much of the historical facts of what happened on that ship from when it left port to it's tragic crash that destroyed so many lives.  While the story with Jack and Rose are fictional, the rest of the story around that is pretty on factual from the historical documents I've seen and read.

I realize they lump all reviews throughout the different versions of Titanic available.  The one I'm reviewing is Titanic (Four-Disc Combo: Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy)",1347753600,6,1989,4.414835164835165

My BD played all the way through, from beginning to end without any issues OTHER THAN one small freeze up between a particular chapter change. I don't think I lost more than a second or two. It could have had something to do with the issues people were talking about or just dust on the disk or a smudge. Either way I'm not complaining. It did not interrupt my movie experience and I continue to love this movie. So glad that I can own it in such high definition. It looks and sounds great. You see every detail of every scene like never before. They really went out of their way to make this as clean as possible, and we're talking about a movie that came out in the late 90's. Oh!

The Alternative Ending is interesting to say the least but I'm quite happy with the original theatrical version.

But this review is not for the movie TITANIC, but the blu ray release (after all these years!) of this tragic tale in history. Funny, after witnessing this spectacular blu ray (in 2D) I have a better appreciation for this Academy Award winner. I have had TITANIC on Laserdisc and DVDs and this is like watching it with new eyes. Paramount has done one fantastic restoration of this film. The detail is astounding as it should be! Never has this film ever looked so good (except IMAX).  And the sound is great in surround sound (too bad Paramount didn't carry over their 6.1 mix from the DVD) for 5.1.
So don't believe what some people are saying that Paramount just wants to ""cash in"" with a re-release. This is NOT a re-release. This is just another format and thankfully it makes this movie look its best. This film has never been on blu ray and its about time! What took so lomg?

128228,5,0792151712,"The past has an unreal quality about it, especially events that occurred before we were born.  For those who survived the sinking, no doubt, had vivid, life-long memories of that terrible night; for them, these were living memories.  For the rest of us, we can study the Titanic to death, but it will be only an academic exercise; it will not feel real.  Movies about historical events almost never achieve a sense of reality, however Cameron's ""Titanic"" comes close.  If feels real; perhaps as close as you will ever get to having a living-memory-like experience of Titanic's passengers and crew. . . .

For example, you can feel the exhilaration and excitement as the ship steams out into the ocean for the first time; you feel it in the music, you can sense it in the way the massive ship slices through the water, and you can see it in Captain Smith's face as he commands: ""Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.  Let's stretch her legs!""

As you watch the fictional romance develop between the free-spirited Jack Dawson and the blossoming Rose DeWitt Bukater and her falling-out with her overbearing fiancee and controlling mother, you can easily count the days of the cruise: from the coast of Ireland on the 11th to the icy Labrador currents on the 14th.

And finally, you witness Smith's fateful decision.  Before leaving the bridge for the night, he listens to Mr. Lightoller's concern - that spotting large icebergs will be difficult due to lack of breakers at their base.  Indeed, the sea is as smooth as the tea in Smith's cup.  He silently weighs the risks ... and decides: ""Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller. . . .""

But unlike most of the other releases ans the recent blu-ray the dvd version of the recent release only features deleted scenes on the special feature aspect. There are about 60 deleted scenes here so if thats what you are into by all means pick it up, but if you are like me and hoped for more features on the new dvd i'd look elsewhere. Some of the reviews i have been reading are for other dvds on past releases not the current release of Titanic that was released in theatres as Titanic 3-D. Again the only feature are deleted scenes, the film portion is great but thats about all you get. I had hoped for such an epic film such as this the new current release would have more features as well as updated features for example maybe a small tribute for the late Gloria Stuart who portrayed Old Rose, as other films have done for their stars.

I won't deny it brought a tear to my eye now and then when you actually see how much Jack and Rose really loved each other and how the story actually ended. All in all, a wonderful film and very heartfelt!

The bluray quality is a 10/10 in terms of picture and sound. I'm unable to comment on the extras as I rented this film from Redbox, but from what I understand it has tons of material on it.  This honestly is a great film when it comes to true romance, emotions and tragedy.  Three hours flew by in a heartbeat!

An update: I just had a friend call me who has the bluray and he said his disc froze when Jack allegedly gets arrested for stealing Rose's necklace. He had to press forward on the remote and says he lost about 45 seconds of the film before it played again.  I have read that other people have had issues with their discs as well! I certainly hope this isn't a screw up on Paramounts part where some defective discs have been released.

128253,5,0792151712,"To this day, Titanic continues to amaze me even though I must have seen this movie more times than any other film in my life! The strange thing is I'm not a big Leonardo DeCaprio fan but the film had everything else going for it, from the romance/action/adventure angle to the fantastical movie score (including the Celine Dion hit) and the other wise wondrous cast, especially Kate Winslet, that I can't think of anyone else who could play this part BUT him!  When Titanic was given the 3D treatment' I couldn't wait to catch it on the big screen again.  For some reason, the first 3D viewing was a little disappointing  because it looked a little flat but when I saw it for the second time (did I mention I've watched this film several times...) everything worked for me. I noticed the subtle changes that director, James Cameron, made but it wasn't distracting.  3D has not been ""all that"" for me but Mr. Cameron seems to know what he is doing as he had previously proven with his mega-hit,'Avitar'.  He doesn't go for the gimmicky effects going instead for the ""natural"" look when it comes to 3D.  Since 'Titanic' wasn't originally made for 3D, the transference comes across more lifelike and not 'in your face'. It's release on DVD at this time however gave me a little concern because I just returned from New York to pay tribute to the victims and survivors of 9/11 and the stories heard is very similar to the images seen in 'Titanic'.  As far as the DVD is concern, the only disappointment I have is that the movie is (like the original release of 'Titanic' on DVD) broken apart on two DVD's.  I haven't gone thru the 4th disc yet since it has something like 30 deleted scenes and 60 behind-the-scenes but it also includes his TV documentary 'The Final Word...' which showed the intense passion and vast knowledge James Cameron has for this historical event that has proven to be unsinkable. And even though 'Titanic' has been released on DVD in several versions...this is the one to get; unless you stumble upon the four disc 3D collector's edition that is already being sold by ""collectors"" for almost $300.00.",1347580800,,2121,4.637333333333333

It's nothing short of jawdropping. You feel as though you are ""in"" the film. Cameron and crew have provided the ultimate 3D film experience.
At first, it's a bit difficult to adjust to the full frame presentation of the 3D version.  We've become so accustomed to the 2:40 released originally. I kept telling myself that he must have cropped the sides. Wrong.  I put the Blu Ray version on another player and compared one frame side by side.  What Cameron has done is present the full frame of what was shot. Oddly, there's even more on the sides in the 3D frame plus the added height and bottom: you can see the ceiling and the back of the sofa in the 3D frame, you can't on the regular Blu Ray.

the 3D blu ray IMO was the best movie to be released. Granted I have not seen every 3D movie however have Transformers Dark blah blah, which has it's moments - but wasn't as great 3D wise as I had read prior to actually having owned or seen the movie. It was okay... With this movie, found myself getting lost in just about every scene because the 3D is just there. Doesn't matter if it's when Rose if looking at the paintings or Jack is eating a roll before tossing Cal a box of matches. JC did a wonderful job in bringing 3D to this particular movie. Cannot wait to watch Avatar 3D - have seen a 2D conversion and was impressed. My favorite scenes were: When Cal fires the pistol down the stairwell - the water from the round hitting errr the water flies up. Opening scene of the movie is pretty neat as well. Loved seeing Kate and Leo running through where the guys were I guess shoveling coal - the steam really stood out.

The bluray 3d picture is beautiful.  It shows how James Cameron had his hand in the tranfer to blu ray and 3d.  The sound is also very good.  I find though a lot of DTS blu ray movies have the dialogue very low, and the sound effects very high. This movie is the same.

I have probably watched this movie 20 times in the theatre and dvd since it first was released.  I never really get tired of it.  This release really makes it better.

One comment on the 3d.  I find most 3d movies on TV provide a great deal of depth, but very little in the way of protruding things coming at you.  This movie showed an amazing amount of depth and clarity which is appropriate for this type of movie.  Absolutely great.  If you liked this movie before, you will love it on blu ray and 3d.  James Cameron is responsible for so many of my favorite movies. Cameron and Spielberg. Cameron's Avatar, Aliens, anf Terminator 2 plus Titanic makes him a great director, creator and technician.

I used to run a fansite (one of the longest running ones in fact) and I still help a friend run one of the only remaining fan sites Back to Titanic.  I have props.  I had a couple of the dresses made as costumes.  I may have gone a bit overboard but I loved this movie and I still do.  One of the highlights for me as a fan was seeing the movie in 3D on Valentine's Day at the screening.  So needless to say, I was so excited for this Blu Ray.  However, I was disappointed in some regards.

The Movie:

The movie itself looks amazing.  I am glad I own it just for this.  It has been completely remastered and looks fantastic in 2D, I don't have a 3D tv but am eagerly anticipating watching this at a friends house in 3D to compare the difference.  The quality is beyond amazing and I can't imagine anyone finding it lacking.  It actually almost looks better than it did in the theater.

The Extras:

This is where it all falls apart!!  In 2005 the Collectors Edition came out and it was awesome.  There was so many extras and goodies!  Commentaries, Behind the Scenes and more.  Much of this is included in the Blu Ray and the sad part is that not much more IS.  There are two new documentaries and that's IT for ""new"" goodies that I could find.  The Titanic Facebook page was touting a Kate Winslet screen test that was supposed to be on the disc but I couldn't find it for love or money.  When seeing that, I hoped that perhaps the Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio screen test was also included on the disc but no such luck.  The two ""new"" documentaries are good - but if you're a Titanic fan only one is truly new as ""Titanic: The Final Word"" was aired this past April on television.  If you missed it, it's a great thing to see but it's not technically new.  The documentary on the film is worth a watch and does have new snippets here and there of behind the scene footage I'd not seen before and some new interviews that were interesting to see.  I liked seeing the coverage from the very beginnings of the movie all the way through the premiere of the 3D release.  However I just feel that things fall flat when it comes to the extras.  I was hoping for more behind the scene stuff like the screen test they teased us with on the Facebook page and am sad that other than ONE documentary, nothing is new and there's quite a few things from the Collectors Edition that didn't make its way over to the Blu Ray.  What would have been even better would have been an option to add in scenes that were deleted but no such luck.

They are saying this is the final word in Titanic and I'm honestly a tad disappointed with this final package.  A 5 star for the movie itself and the quality of the blu ray and 3 stars for the extras.",1347321600,5,2768,4.175803402646503
128261,5,0792151712,"Watching this film on my 120"" 3D projection home theater was faaarrr better than the experience I had when I originally saw the film in theaters years ago. The detail and depth was just amazing. The subtle sound design and overall spectacle was wonderful.

It's a film I'm going put on to show off to friends who stop over from now on.

The one oddity is that the 3D version of the film is broken up into two discs and when the first one ends, the screen goes black and my machine locks up. I had to unplug my player and put it back in to get the disc out.

I've yet to go through the hours of extras and commentaries, but my money was well spent with the film alone. Thank you.",1347321600,2,678,4.082706766917293
128282,2,0792151712,"Clearly (frankly, un-cleary), Camaron's Titanic movie was not meant for 3-D.  Only two stars were given for the upgrade in Cameron's effort and there are a few good scenes.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this conversion, sorry folks.

Over-The-Shoulder shots, images which focused on a character in the middle, the closer objects are excessively blurred.  Most distant backgrounds weren't annoying, though.  Naturally, blurred images are a focal strategy when a photographer/producer would want to lead his audience's attention on a subject hence everything upclose or further into the background is blurred.  A normalcy and it's professional photography when seen in 2-D because it helps the filmographer steer his audience to a the subject matter.  I never found it to hurt the eyes and this technique works well with 2-D.  However, in a 3-D conversion, particularly when the movie wasn't originally shot in 3-D, evidently this becomes blinding.

I'm not a professional in photography, by any means.  Just a logical assumption.  Actually, closer images should be sharper in real life world.  In 2-D, you would need to blur an image to represent depth.  However, in 3-D you already have depth.  So when you take the artificial 2-D depth and combine it into 3-D, it's overkill and I believe this would explain the blurriness I've seen in this movie.

Blurriness in this Titanic movie was evident everywhere, whether with various objects like the mast and funnel wire supports and/or the backs of fronts of peoples heads.  I know, these details aren't important at that moment.  But the ""you-are-there"" feeling with at least those images coming out of the screen was simply ""not-there"".  Nothing popped out of the screen and I was sitting with proper alignment to the screen.

Somehow, one could see that flat images were layered.  Character eye contact is off.  In several scenes where characters which would talk to one another, the talker's eye contact seemed like he/she was looking at the listener's side.  Well, of coarse that's where the ear is, but most human beings still provide eye-contact and they let the sound waves do the hearing function.

Another reason I wouldn't recommend this 3-D version: Simply too long of a movie while wearing 3-D glasses.

There are good scenes, I must say.  The Grand Staircase from balcony to lower level was awesome.

My equipment used is moderately new, both last year's (2011) with high regard.  The entertainment was watched with a Sony XBR and Oppo's best BDP-95.  I've seen great results with other materiel using this same setup.

I'm glad I bought this movie, though.  Experience.  Now, I'm not looking forward to the Star Wars reproductions.  Thanks to Titanic 3-D herein, I'll now look forward to something else better.  I'm sure that if a 1997 movie didn't work, a 1977 definitely won't!  In a way, I could understand that producer's wanting to make changes, however silly they may be.  The fans sometimes oppose the producer's changes.  For instance, there are people who don't believe in colorization on a black & white movie or television show for historical preservation.  Honestly, I consider colorization an improvement.  I think better they worry about 3-D conversions.

This Titanic movie was meant to be seen in 2-D, period.  Save your eyes!",1347321600,3,3304,5.080074487895717
128283,4,0792151712,"I can honestly say forking over the $70 for the collectors edition was a huge waste of money. From the outside, the box looks pretty, the same size as many other box sets in it's class. However upon opening the box the contents are just sitting in there in a very poor quality holding system. First off, my set had the little tabs broken off which keep the disc case from sliding around the inside of the large outside box. The book is very very thin and the photos are NOT glossy as I expected. The little pack of cards and extras is kind of neat, however not worth the $40 more for the collector's set. It just seems cheap.

The movie PQ and 3D are amazing. The audio is perfect and I can honestly say this is the best looking 3D movie I have ever seen. The movie, especially the 3D version is very well worth it, however I would pass on the Collectors Edition. Regret is a very strong word, and I will use it here in regards to this set.

128284,3,0792151712,"As a 3D buff, I was first in line at the local cinema when Titanic 3D opened.  Unfortunately, the theater in which I viewed the movie had a weak DLP projection system, rendering the film dark, dull, and colorless.

When my Blu-Ray arrived, I popped it into my LG BD670 and started watching it in 3D on my LG Cinema 3D surround setup. The video is ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!  Five times better than in the theater, the picture has gorgeous color, brilliantly sharp picture, and amazingly lifelike 3D. All I can say is, Roger Ebert is either blind or he watched the movie in a theater with a projection system as bad as the one I was in. Several of the scenes on-deck were like being there.

On the other hand, I and my wife couldn't help noticing that the sound track, brilliant in its clarity and dynamic range, was out of sync with the characters lips in several scenes.  It wasn't BADLY out of sync, but easily bad enough to be noticeable.  Could it be my setup?  I've watched over 50 movies in 3D and never noticed a problem before with sound sync.

128286,5,0792151712,"This review is for the 3D Blu Ray.  Having watched Titanic in the theaters in 1997, owning it on VHS, and then on the first DVD release I knew that the Blu Ray would be a must have, especially the 3D version.  I've probably seen the movie about 50 times before this release.  So, I knew there wouldn't be a lot of 3D shots that would jump out at me.  Besides, that expectation is a little much considering this movie was shot before today's technology was in use.

Firstly, as many times as I have seen this movie I was still very very presently surprised by how much detail I'd missed all these years, from the very opening scene until the end.  The 3D really adds to the movie in such a way that it enhances all the detail of each scene.  There are many times when I honestly felt as though I was on the Titanic or that the Titanic might sail straight into my bedroom.  That was new for me and I've seen a lot of 3D movies at home.  Keep in mind that I'm watching this on a 32"" Vizio.  So, not really a large television at all.  I would definitely recommend the 3D version to those who love 3D movies or just really love Titanic and would like to feel like they are apart of it.",1347321600,,1180,4.086956521739131

The colors are vivid, a lot of contrast, very clear picture.  It's hard to believe that this movie was converted from 2D to 3D because the 3D effect is one of the best I've ever seen.  There was no noticeable ghosting.  I had seen the 3D version of this movie in the theatre and thought it was good.  However, it is even more impressive on my 3D TV (47 inch LG).  The characters often appear to be with me in the room, they pop out of the screen.  There is a lot of depth throughout the movie, which is also visable in darker scenes.  The picture is amazing.

128288,3,0792151712,"This review is for the Titanic Collector's Edition. If you're a long time TITANIC fan and wondering whether or not to buy this exclusive, my advice is -- don't unless the price is around $50 or less. I got mine with Swagbucks coupons; had I paid $70 for it, I would have been disappointed. The exclusives are a 28 page full-color book with pictures in it (no text), a handful of reprint postcards of the costume designer's sketches for the main characters, a little bag full of reprint articles / memorabilia about the TITANIC's sinking, and the 3D Blu Ray/Blu Ray/Digital combo pack. And of course the box, which is pretty cool -- it has bumps for rivets, raised text, etc.

The extras in the set are cool, but not worth an extra $40-$50 dollars.

TITANIC and its ported over extras: in a word? AMAZING. This looks INCREDIBLE in HD. It includes ""The Final Word with James Cameron,"" which for any historical / TITANIC freak is a must-have, since it's about an hour and a half think-tank discussion on how TITANIC wound up in so many pieces on the ocean floor. The new documentary about the film, its troubling early days, the media blitz, and its long-term success is also a lot of fun. Not all the extras are ported over from the 3 Disk Collector's Edition from a few years ago, though, so you may want to hang onto that set if you like HBO's special. But the trailers and extra features look terrific in HD.

I haven't yet watched the entire film on Blu Ray, but was blown away with how good it looks (I checked out the ""Jack, I'm flying scene!"" among others); the restoration was impeccable, colors have been made more vibrant, and the detail on some scenes is simply jaw-dropping. The sound is wonderful as well, but some users are reporting a ""popping"" sound right after the Paramount logo fades and the movie begins.

Overall, this is a must-have movie on Blu Ray... but it's not a must-have set. Save your money and pick up the standard edition disks instead.",1347321600,5,1966,4.529577464788733

128314,5,0792151712,"This review contains thoughts of what I personally think about the movie itself and what my expectations of this blu ray should be.
First off-this film is incredible. Never mind the what some call sappy love story. This film is brilliant and had so much effort put into making it.
James Cameron is on my top 5 favorite director lists along with Spielberg and Ridley Scott of course. The first time you watch this film it affects you in a huge way. The thought of all these people fighting for their survival and some knowing they will not make it off the ship alive. The song Celine Dion performs well you got to admit your eyes pour out tears when you hear it. I am a big believer and worshipper of visual and special effects. Just not overly CGI crapped out though. The process to making this film look as real as possible is absolutely amazing in its own way. Now, here are my expectations for the blu ray release. Hopefully on the bonus features there should be an in depth process on the making of this beautiful ship 'cause you wonder- ""How did Cameron achieve The stunning, visual, shots which are set forth so stunningly in this picture?""
Hopefully the transfer is cleaned up a bit so as to have an enjoyable experience watching it. I heard for the blu ray that the disc art is plain. I always love when there is disc art. It is a minor setback but hopefully does not take away from the incredible experience that this has to offer in so many ways. Well I just ordered the blu ray version. No blu ray 3d since I do not own a 3d TV. But as I have heard Cameron say in interviews that and I quote- ""Even watching this film in 2d, It looks better than when first released back in 1997."" So that sounds good to me. So basically I encourage anyone out there reading this review to go pick this up in resect to the 100th sinking anniversary of the titanic and for a sureal viewing experience as to delight any viewer who has a love for cinema and its movies as brought forth for the public watching.",1347235200,,2001,4.310344827586207

We spent about 6 months working a typical 12-16 hours a day, 6 days a week, shooting this movie, so with 2.5 hours of additional material and never seen footage, we get to see stuff we only remember now, as a fading memory of this amazing project.

My shipment arrived yesterday (Saturday), before street date (thanks, Amazon!).

I have to admit that I wasn't really impressed with the 3D when I saw this in the theater, but I can honestly (and thankfully) say that it is MUCH better on my 3D TV than when I saw it in the theater.

The image quality is crystatl clear, and the 3D adds a wonderful depth that, again, I did not see in the theater. I wonder if the theater that I saw it in did not have the proper setup or equipment? In any event, I am thrilled that I got the 3D version of this movie. The restoration/cleanup is fantastic, and the sound is equally dazzling.

This set does come with 2 discs for the 3D version of the film. The 3rd disc is the regular 2D version (including audio commentaries), and the 4th disc contains all the bonus features. The bonus content includes 2 new documentaries, the first being ""Reflections on Titanic"", which includes new interviews with James Cameron, Kate Winslet, Bill Paxton, Kathy Bates and others. Leonardo DiCaprio is not featured in any of the new interviews but is seen in some of the older footage. The 2nd new documentary is ""Titanic: The Final Word"", which is a very interesting and informative re-examination of the sinking. Both of these documentaries run about 90 min or so each.

Also in the bonus materials are trailers, tv spots, music video (of course), 30 deleted scenes, 60 behind the scenes featurettes (none running over a couple of minutes), a few ""Titanic"" parodies, some footage shot by crew members (some is funny, some leaves you scratching your head), and some other archival features from the Special Edition DVD set from a few years back.

128346,5,0792151712,"Everyone true movie buff has seen this film, and with so many good reviews, there isn't much need to review the standard version. However, I went to the cinema to see the 3D version, and I must say that if given the choice of a standard def film with at least some of the deleted scenes re-inserted, I would have taken that over the 3D upscale any day. I found the 3D effect to be relatively minimal on a cinema screen, and I don't feel it's a film that NEEDED to be 3D.

Why ? - well, a criticism I had of the original release is that it ignores the Californian, the ship that was parked in ice about ten miles away, so if you had not seen or read ""A Night To Remember"", and were essentially a newby to the event, you would have no idea of the Californian. I mean, it is a major aspect of the tragedy that the officers of the Californian saw the rockets, but failed to investigate further by waking their own radio operator, Cyril Evans.

The Carpathia is also largely ignored in Cameron's original release, except during the rescue of Titanic's lifeboats. Other films have shown quite well how Carpathia's radio operator, Harold Cottam, caught Titanic's distress call & delivered the message to Captain Rostron, who went immediately into action (unlike the crew of Californian, who even had visual indications that warranted some further investigation on their part, but failed to react).

However, if you watch the deleted scenes, it makes reference to it. There are also some other areas of the ship that feature more prominently, such as the radio room, which was of course one of the focal points of the ship during the disaster.

Even the deleted scene where Jack & Rose are chased into the 1st class dining saloon by Hockley's valet, Lovejoy, is quite tense. Outside of the radio room & Californian scenes that were cut, I liked the scene where Astor mocked the gym instructor when he said that he wouldn't wear a life jacket because it would impede his swimming stroke.

I have always thought that Cameron could have even made probably a better film without using the fictional characters of Jack & Rose, as SOS Titanic (and while crappy in comparison, it's a pity the original cut of that film as released by Rank Arena/EMI isn't on DVD/Blu-Ray) is about the only one I can think of that featured hardly any fictional characters (even ""A Night To Remember"" had several fictionalized characters in it, as did the two mini-series that have come out). While SOS Titanic is a pretty average film, it does portray some great scenes, such as Jack Thayer & Milton Long shaking hands & wishing each other luck before diving into the water as the bridge started to submerge.

So for me, while I did like Cameron's version of the film for it being the best rendition of the ship itself, and some great acting, it was disappointing in other areas as it missed out on some key aspects to the actual historical event. For me, it's another one of those films where having seen the deleted scenes, I regularly wonder why the heck some of these brilliant scenes, that would have improved the accuracy of the film, were sent to the cutting room floor & were never re-inserted for the 100th anniversary for the public to enjoy.

NB (9/16/2012) - Since writing this review, and as this version of the film is not availabe, I bought the Australian release 3D Bluray. It should be pointed out that the 3D release for Australia (which is probably the same internationally) is on two discs, so if they are all the same, you will need to switch discs just after the scene where Thomas Andrews tells Capt Smith & Ismay that the Titanic will sink. Furthermore, I felt that the 3D depth in the home release is far better than what it was in the 3D cinema release, but the tenets of original review still stand - I would personally rather have seen some or even all of the deleted scenes re-inserted into the original theatrical release rather than a 3D release.",1347148800,10,3944,4.562146892655368

It has so much more character than that, it has great narration with a good story arch and some of the best performances by wonderful actors with a fantastic cast.  Leonardo DiCaprio seperates himself as a great lonesome kid ready to start fresh going back to his roots while Kate Winslet is terrific as a girl placed in a world she longs to depart.  Though they have great chemistry, they are not the best performances as Kathy Bates and Billy Zane are two side characters with spit fire personality and strong presence on screen. Overall the only negative I could imagine is that if you don't enjoy long films, overly romantic themes, or a predictable ending *spoiler* (the boat hits and ice berg and sinks) you should the movie either mildly enjoyable or extremely worth every minute of your time.",1346976000,3,967,4.5344827586206895

128351,5,0792151712,"It is not often you see a film whose convictions, dramatically and visually, match its ambitious intentions all the way through. Although it's been oft-parodied for years, James Cameron's eloquent, unforgettable 1997 Oscar-winner TITANIC (****, 194 mins., 1997, PG-13; Paramount) is one of those special films: an ""epic"" with an intimate, character-driven center, and a visual panache that truly makes one feel that you're right at home on the doomed ship itself. When the vessel meets its inevitable fate at the end, you feel the pain and horror along with the characters since Cameron has done such an amazing job balancing story with spectacle, paying proper respect and historically recounting the incident as accurately as he can, while still producing an entertainment - and, at times, a piece of art - that's been seldom duplicated by Hollywood in recent years.

Part of the film's enduring appeal is due to the chemistry between Leonardo Dicaprio (outstanding) and Kate Winslet (excellent), who embody the film's admittedly old-fashioned, somewhat hokey but still compelling love story between the lower-class passenger and the upper-class rich girl slated to marry snobby tycoon Billy Zane. DiCaprio confirmed with his ""Titanic"" role why he was one of the top young actors of his generation, with an unpredictable yet earnest quality that informs his performance. The then-buxom Winslet is often captivating as the female lead, a role that often comes across as cliched and maybe a bit forced, yet she does such a fine job with it that it is hard to complain. Excellent supporting work abounds in this film, from Kathy Bates's Molly Brown to fine character turns by David Warner and Frances Fisher. The first half of the film is so good, in fact, that you forget the ship is on-course for the deadliest maritime disaster of the twentieth century.

When the big event does arrive, Cameron treats us to a simply breathtaking dramatic display, the closest thing to a veritable rollercoaster (geometrically and otherwise) we've yet seen in the movies. The incident is awesomely conveyed in size and scope, with detailed special effects that haven't aged too badly. They masterfully assist Cameron in producing a meticulous recreation of the actual tragedy, with virtually every incident coming straight out of real-life accounts from survivors. (Indeed, Cameron frames shots that were supposed to have actually happened throughout the film. There is one moment early on where a young boy is spinning a top on the vessel's deck, a picture that originates from an Irish priest's photo of the Titanic in port at Belfast - one of the final photos ever taken of the ship. Clearly, Titanic scholars will find an incredible array of moments like those interpolated throughout the film, in addition to dialogue between some of the White Star line and crew members that also reportedly occurred in real life. Of course, not all of the film is historically accurate, yet that so much of it is speaks volumes about the director's attempts to balance art with authenticity).

Like every great film, the cumulative whole of ""Titanic""  is that of a true, bona-fide experience - the kind we hope to see every time we go to the movies. The picture stays with you long after the film has ended - yes, its relatively simple messages of living your life to its fullest, freed from the restrictions imposed by other individuals and society itself, may seem straightforward enough, yet Cameron's movie has a haunting resonance that is almost impossible to describe (part of this is due to James Horner's outstanding score).

After it's over, you're left contemplating the immense significance of an almost incomprehensible event that has been broken down into pure human terms that apply to all of us. It's hard to think back on other movies that have left that much of an impression on viewers, which is why ""Titanic""  is a movie whose cinematic legacy may live on as long as the historical impact of the tragic sinking itself.

Paramount has, at last, brought ""Titanic"" to Blu-Ray in a couple of different editions, the most notable being a 3-D Limited Edition combo pack. I didn't go to see the 3-D re-release in theaters, but there is no doubt that Cameron's attention to detail has resulted in one of the strongest 3-D conversions to date: there's scant ghosting, and plenty of depth-of-field, effects throughout here, with the picture playing more effectively in 3-D than you might've anticipated (note that the film has been split into two parts on the 3-D side). The 2-D version (contained on one disc), also included here, has been treated marvelously, with a razor sharp, natural looking 1080p AVC encoded transfer, while 5.1 DTS MA audio masterfully conveys an intricately mixed sound design that's as important to the film as the visuals themselves. It's a technical presentation as satisfying as you'd anticipate coming from Cameron and his Lightstorm Entertainment banner.

Extra features include three commentaries on the 2-D Blu-Ray plus a bonus fourth disc of extras. These include the all-new ""Reflections on Titanic"" (an hour-long film retrospective, in HD, offering interviews with all of the major participants sans DiCaprio) and ""Titanic: The Final Word With James Cameron,"" a 96-minute special (also in HD) that originally aired on the National Geographic Channel earlier this year, with Cameron talking with various Titanic experts one last time about the ship's final night. Deleted scenes are also included, in full HD, with optional Cameron commentary that's been brought over from the 2005 DVD edition. A series of original production featurettes are also on tap, plus a full range of trailers and TV spots (left off that 2005 release), Titanic parodies and, of course, the Celine Dion video for ""My Heart Will Go On.""

It's a rich, outstanding package that's been assembled here by Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment and Paramount, with terrific extras and spectacular transfers -- no matter which version of ""Titanic"" you wish to revisit.",1346457600,7,6052,5.111223458038423

128388,5,0792151712,"Within this review there are two things: my thoughts on the film, and a parental section with good information on different topics parents should know about before allowing their children to watch Titanic.
MY THOUGHTS ON ""TITANIC""
In simplest terms, I can put Titanic as ""The Greatest Movie In History."" The film ""Titanic"" rates a 5/5 on my scale, as it is the most beautifully sad romance story that kept me on the edge of my seat (and the verge of tears) throughout the entire film. WARNING: From this point on in the review, there may be spoilers :WARNING. So, the film is basically all about two people, one first class woman, and one steerage passenger who wins their ticket aboard the Titanic at a poker game. The two become star-crossed lovers and, when the ship hits an iceberg, their love only gets stronger and stronger until one of them dies.
As I said earlier, I would rate James Cameron's Titanic 5/5. However, the current edition I'm reviewing rates 3/5 because the special features are not, in simple words, ""good"". I suppose a better way to put them would be ""nonexistent"", although it is saved from being 0/5 because the menus are so beautifully done, and the entire 3h15min is compressed on one DVD video. I almost cried just seeing the menu images, knowing the story of the Titanic.
If I was rating the VHS version, it would receive 5/5 stars, as it's the original, and the only version of Titanic I can seem to find in fullscreen.
If I was rating the special collector's edition of Titanic, it would rate 6/5, as it has three discs. The first two are, obviously, the film, with many additional special features, and a third disc with all special features. And the disc is PACKED.
Unfortunately, I don't have a Blu Ray player, and I can't comment on any other versions of Titanic, as that is all I have. I am a lifelong collector of this film and, if you don't already know, Titanic will have a hi-def DVD release on September 10, 2012! Way exciting!
PARENTAL SECTION
While a wonderful movie, there are many things parents don't know if they haven't seen Titanic all ready. And if you're buying the movie thinking ""it's a nice history lesson for my child or teenager"", you might be upset if you don't know some of the stuff in the movie. For example, some parents don't want their teenagers seeing nudity, which they will see briefly if you let them watch Titanic on DVD (more details ahead). I have broken down everything in the movie for you, and it's listed here:
Violence: Well, the ship sinks, and there can be some pretty violent and disturbing deaths. We see dead bodies floating around in the water, and at one point, one of the life boat attendants picks one up, and we get a closeup on their dead face. Jack Dawson dies, suddenly. People fall off the Titanic as it's up in the air, and they slide to their death. People can be seen shooting one another, or even themselves.
Profanity: As far as I know, there's one f word, two or three s words, b@stard is used a few times, the middle finger is given once by Rose, and there are lots more religious words used throughout the film. It's not too bad in therms of profanity.
Alcohol Use: Smoking is shown throughout the movie, and some of the characters drink alcohol, although the scenes in which alcohol are involved are very minor.
Sexuality: Rose asks Jack to ""draw me like one of your french girls wearing this, and only this."" Then she takes off her clothes and has him draw a portrait of her. We see her breasts for an extended period of time during the movie. Later, the couple are lying in the back of an old vehicle atop each other, meant to symbolize that they just had s3x.
Scary Scenes: Well, it's a big ship that gets hit by an iceberg and sinks, leaving thousands of people dead. As long as you're not going on a boat ride any time soon... well, you be the judge. Would something like that bother your child?

If you just read this entire review, THANK YOU. Hopefully you got as much information out of this as I had to share, and hopefully Amazon doesn't reject this review due to length.

128404,5,0792151712,"""Titanic"" is an epic romantic drama film.

Whilst there have been several adaptations of the Titanic sinking, this is a story of young and eternal love.

This movie has contributed to a popular and lasting legacy of the Titanic's 1912 maiden voyage, and treats the viewer to vivid and poignant distinctiveness of the event, which honours the tragedy.

Great performances from the two leads, clever quotes from film history (Lubitsch, Kubrick, Eisenstein: it's all there) even the much derided script contains some good lines (viz Rose's campy lines about Freud and Picasso).

128457,4,0792151712,"Up until 48 hours ago I must have been the only person on the planet not to have seen this film! Curious how you can sometimes miss cultural juggernauts. It's even curiouser given I'm a fan of Leo's work. I'm sure I probably haven't got much to add that hasn't already been said but I thought I'd write a review anyway because the film has stayed etched on my mind since I saw it.

As it turns out, this is a multi-Oscar winner that pulls off the unique trick of being brilliant and rightly deserving its classic status with a movie that in places is toe-curlingly bad. For this writer/producer/director James Cameron must surely take the blame.

Cameron is a genius with the visuals and action. Everything looks utterly authentic; the camerawork, especially as the boat goes down, is masterful; the structure and how he allows us to see every aspect of life on the ship, brilliant. But Cameron knows that all this will count for nothing unless there's a human story at the heart of it. For that he deserves credit but alas his writing skills aren't up to the challenge. So the relationship between Jack and Rose, although touching in places, is also heavy-handed and a bit mawkish. Cameron is a well-known control freak on set which is a shame because if he'd handed some of the writing duties to a more sensitive scribe then quite possibly TITANIC would have been the greatest film ever made. Instead it's nearly there. Oh, and James Horner's score doesn't help: it can be gut-churningly sentimental.

Having said all that, as the ship sinks, especially in the final moments as it stands at a right angle from the ocean Cameron has captured some of the most visceral and haunting images ever put down on film. I found it almost too distressing to watch.",1335744000,6,1755,4.636655948553055

128495,5,0792151712,"In 1997, James Cameron made the most amazing movie in the entire world, and it's name was Titanic. I saw the movie last weekend and it was AMAZING on the big screen. I never had the opprotunity to watch it the first time as I was only 2 years old when it came out in 1997. The movie was beyond comparrison to other films released that weekend. One change I did notice was that the color was enhanced. For example, when Jack and Rose swim up after the back half of Titanic sank, the water was a blue color as opposed to the original greenish color. Another thing they enhanced the color of was the ship itself. I was hoping for some deleted scenes to be included, but that's alright. By today's standards, a new copy of Titanic could run you somewhere between $75 and $100, due to the fact that it's out of print. I will admit, with the re-release of the film in theatres, I knew it would be re-released on Blu-Ray and DVD. There is a Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital Copy combo also available. The only thing I don't really like is the fact that we have to wait til September to get it. You'd think it'd be more necessary in May or June. But of all movies James Cameron has done, this has to be one of my favorites. I've seen Titanic who knows how many times, and I was shocked to realize I did not yet own a copy. I have already set my money aside to purchase this DVD re-release, and I hope you do the same.",1334793600,,1396,4.174074074074074
128496,5,0792151712,"I saw the 3D version of this film over the weekend. The first time I saw this film, I liked it a lot but admittedly I spent too much time focusing on special effects and the general razzle dazzle of an enormous spectacle.
This time around gave me the opportunity to just watch the movie. I, like a lot of people, have recently been immersed (or drowning) in Titanic related books, DVDs, and television programs. Overall, I've learned quite a bit. The one thing that has come out of all of this is just how good a film this is. I'd label this movie's genre historical fiction. James Cameron threw in the subplot of the Rose De Witt Butaker and Jack Dawson romance to get this film made, but the real star is the Titanic. Everything about the ship's first and only voyage and its descent into temporary oblivion is not only well done but done in exacting detail given what was known in 1997 when this movie was made. The real passengers and crew are portrayed with accuracy and the Rose/Jack story slides into this mosaic seamlessly.
As for the 3D process, I really didn't know what to expect. I had heard some negative comments which were not specific. I thought the criticism might be comparable to what was said about colorization when b&w movies were being altered from their original format. That was an idea that came and went because the technology was poor at best and it was distracting. The 3D aspect of Titanic works. It isn't jarring or gimmicky or a grossly imperfect technology; strange objects such as the bow of the Titanic don't shoot out at you. There is no freak show here. The technology, which I have to assume is not only costly but time consuming, enhances a really nice photography job by adding depth and dimension. Clearly if you are a movie purist and don't like tweaking you won't want to see Titanic 3D. I'm o.k. with the enhancement and think Cameron & his people made a very well done movie even better.
Overall, this was a great viewing experience and was the 3D enhancement was not distracting as far as I am concerned. I enjoyed the opportunity to pay attention to a the wonderful small details I missed the first time around and am pleased to see this being introduced to a new generation of movie viewers.",1334620800,20,2239,4.530864197530864

I figured if anyone could properly retrofit a 2D movie and make it 3D, James Cameron would be the one.  For the most part that is true.  There are, however, some scenes that missed the boat (bad pun, I know).  The scenes of the ship in its entirety seemed not quite sharp.  The wide shot of the ship at the dock seemed fuzzy, but the closeups of the people on the dock have good 3D perspective.  A couple of interior scenes appeared to have no 3D (looked the same with or without the 3D glasses, while the shot of the table setting in the dining room was exquisitely done.  The underwater scenes had excellent depth (another bad pun).  I had been waiting for a blu ray release of the film because anything had to be better than the original DVD, but the reason I decided to pay extra for 3D is that the scenes after the Titanic hits the iceberg and until it sinks, make you feel like you are really there.  I expect the sound on the blu ray will be much better than it was on the DVD.

128533,4,0792151712,"Titanic wasn't the first attempt at turning the sinking of the big boat into a theatrical epic, but it's by far the best and will never, ever be bettered. Cameron's minute attention to detail, commitment to realism, and epic vision are light years ahead of the German Propaganda version, a Night to Remember (where the ship sinks whole), the dull Catherine Zeta Jones version, or the tawdry ITV mini-series.

The hugeness of the production is every bit as impressive at the ship, and the savage critics predicted that the film was doomed to fail as hard as its subject matter. Nope! Titanic went on to be a $2 billion hit and scoop 11 Academy Awards.

Despite the many positive reviews there are always film snobs who love to pick faults in popular culture phenomenons. But I think Titanic is more than that and doesn't deserve any nit-picking. It's easy to focus on inconsequential details, but Titanic has few faults. The worst I can say of it is that Leo DiCaprio's acting is sometimes a bit aggravating. Apparently Macauley Culkin was considered for the part of Jack Dawson. Now THAT was have been awesome.

Many snobs have called the characters flat and uninteresting. It's hard to develop such a wide cast in a film set within a short space of time (not including the 84 year time-span of the story). But the two and a bit days that the ship manages to sail before it sinks does have plenty of drama and development so anyone who complains otherwise is just deliberately being fickle. I don't even think that Billy Zane comes across as a caricature, as others have gleefully pointed out. Caledon Hockley IS actually a complex, and somewhat sympathetic character. I know he's the antagonist (or maybe the iceberg is), but the fact that he still searches for Rose on the deck of the Carpathia means that he really does love her, in a way.

Once the iceberg hits, at the 100-minute mark, the editing and timing (not quite real-time, but close) is perfect. The growing panic matches the rising water as Captain Smith walks around in a daze, completely unable to be believe that it REALLY IS HAPPENING. The hole in the hull doesn't seem to be a problem at first, but two hours later anyone not on a lifeboat is doomed.

In a way it's an end-of-the-world movie as much as a romance or disaster. The Titanic was a microcosm of human society, and despite its status as the biggest ship ever built it really was a tiny, fragile speck on a dark, unforgiving ocean. Even as a child, long before I ever saw the film, I thought that the sinking of it represented the futility of mankind trying to conquer the ocean and the meaningless of wealth.

It's a very different film from Terminator or True Lies, but James Cameron has always kept a gritty, earthy tone to his movie. Titanic isn't, but his commitment to realism keeps it consistent to his other movies.

I don't think it's the best movie ever, but it scores almost full marks for everything. Titanic deserves to be seen on the big screen, which is why I have only seen it twice. The new 3D conversion looks great, and with a few corrections to the content of the film, and the digital projection itself, now really IS the time to revisit the ship.",1334275200,6,3197,4.578671328671328

For those oblivious to the laserdisc format, they were large serving plate sized discs that were introduced in the late 1970's to compete with betamax and VHS but never really could because of production costs - the players and individual movies were expensive to produce but if you had the money for either, you were in the closest fidelity to what you could get at the local theater.

Laserdiscs were made until the early 2000s so films like ""Titanic"" were the start of final hurrahs for the format.  This version of ""Titanic"" is a two-disc, four-sided CLV letterbox feature with AC-3/Dolby Digital audio, which was the standard presentation for the epic films at time.  The little more than three hour-film is spread across the discs in forty-five to fifty-five minute intervals with breaks in the lulls in the subplots - so even after potty breaks or getting more snacks, you can quickly jump back to drama as another plot starts.

128536,4,0792151712,"What with the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic coming up in a few days, I figured why not go see the 3D re-release of 1997's Titanic.

I've long been a fan of both disaster movies and melodramas set in the Gilded Age, so a combination of the two seemed a natural fit for me. Now, I had enjoyed this the first time I viewed it (holy cow, can it really be 15 years ago? I'm feeling old...), but I'm well aware that it's long been fashionable in some circles to make fun of the film. But you know, I don't think it really deserves it.

Oh, there's no doubt the star of the film is the ship; the screenplay itself is less than stellar. It's a bit hokey and clunky and heavy-handed, with no real subtlety or originality. But in one sense, these attributes actually work well with a story set in this era; the simple plot (with a broad portrayal of both good and evil characters) is presented in a fashion similar to how a melodrama would have been depicted back in 1912, whether on-stage or in the earliest short silent films. I found myself thinking that the script really wasn't nearly as bad as many people have made it out to be, over the intervening years since the film was first released.

That said, I'm afraid that the film didn't really ""grab"" me as much this time around, as it had when I first saw it when I was a good deal younger. Maybe I'm just getting old and tired and cynical? Or, perhaps it's the fact that I'm not a big fan of any of the actors in the film, and have no interest whatsoever in the two playing the leads. I think if the film featured some acting talent about whom I was enthusiastic, who I was excited to see on the screen, I would have found the film to be considerably more riveting. As it is---eh, I'm not all that thrilled with any of the characters apart from Molly Brown, who I thought was a lot of fun in every one of her too-brief scenes.

Hmmm, what can I say---I still enjoy the picture (though it's not one that I'm likely to re-watch often in its entirety) and I do recommend it. However---any film with a running time of over three hours needs to have an intermission! Sitting still that long is too hard on the butt---heh.

The 3D conversion was nicely done, but not exceptional. I thought it would be a little more striking, in fact---after the first hour I kind of forgot that I was even seeing it in 3D. But, no real complaints on this score.

This re-release may not set any box-office records, but after only a week in theatres it's already easily paid for the 3D conversion process and is making a tidy profit.

---SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING---

Oh, I do have one huge complaint---and there's probably no need to even post spoiler warnings, because doesn't everyone already know exactly what happens at the end? While I find the very end of the film most touching---haunting, even---the bit that comes before that annoys the heck out of me. I STILL am ticked off that ""old Rose"" threw the priceless blue diamond into the water! I don't care how symbolic it is---explain it any way you like, that was just a stupid and pointless and senseless thing to do to an art object that had huge historical significance. Holy cow, she could have just written out a complete account of her story and packed it up along with the gem---and then upon her death made sure her will specified that the package was delivered to the Smithsonian, or something like that. Man---even writing out these words, and I find I'm getting ticked off all over again! So, that's the one thing that I really hate about this film.

128537,5,0792151712,"Since this is the 100th anniversary of the great ship's demise, filmmaker James Cameron decided to sink another $15-$20 into his blockbuster in order to re-release it in 3-D. Is he successful? Well kind of. I still waiver on the whole 3-D idea. I have seen some films where it looks great and gives added depth and dimension to the film and the story (Cameron's own ""Avatar"" may be the best example). Often the case however, it becomes a gimmick to make a few extra bucks at the box office, with the outrageous up charge.

In the case of ""Titanic"" Cameron is very restrained. You won't be dodging chunks of iceberg coming at you, but you will get the feel of torrents of water coming at passengers via nearly abandon passageways. I was a bit distracted by some of the shots, usually where 2 people are talking to each other. In relative close up shots, one person's head was not in 3-D (removed glasses to confirm) but the other, with his/her back to you, was. The shot was often blurry and partially off screen. The best use is when all hell breaks loose on the ship and it begins its imminent doom. Ultimately this wasn't originally shot in 3-D so there have to be compromises. Is it worth the extra $3? For me sure. Here's a review of the film:

I'm not sure how many times I've seen this movie, maybe 5 or 6, but it is the fastest 190 minute movie I know. Director, writer and producer James Cameron solidifies his place in film history with this masterpiece. It is a rare film where we know the outcome, so Cameron must give credence to the sinking of the ship itself. It must look real, and it does. The movie lays much of the groundwork early-on when a treasure-hunter (Bill Paxton) is searching the wreckage for an invaluable large diamond necklace. Instead he finds a charcoal sketch of a nude young woman. The news finds its way to television, where centenarian Rose recognizes it. It is her.

In a terrific performance, veteran actress Gloria Stuart as elderly Rose narrates much of the film for us and the crew of the treasure hunters. It is here we also become educated on how the Titanic actually sunk. Knowing this early on we are allowed to become invested in the characters and events leading up to and following the iceberg collision. Skillful writing to be sure. In Rose's flashbacks we see a young rapscallion named Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) use his poker playing skills to secure passage on Titanic in its maiden voyage to the U. S. Jack discovers young Rose (Kate Winslett) contemplating jumping overboard rather than marry an obnoxious, rich industrialist (Billy Zane).

Rose is being coerced into the marriage as her mother is penniless and only has the family name to bargain with. Rose and Jack, coming from different backgrounds become simpatico in their relationship and eventually brief lovers. Jack, an unschooled artist sketches Rose at her insistence. Bare, but for the necklace, the portrait is put in the safe. The scene is erotic and at the same time innocent.

Once the ship hits the iceberg, the action ramps up and Cameron doesn't cheat us. This section is a technological achievement of the first order. Using sets that include miniature and near full size models we sense the impending doom. Various characters in the story become more human with their actions. Some positive, some not, but all believable. Cameron also hired James Horner who provides a memorable musical score and even Celine Dion's overplayed song is perfectly placed over the ending credits. In the end, ""Titanic"" is a great love story, brief though it is. We know that as soon as Rose and Jack meet. Winslett and DiCaprio convince us from beginning to end. Their performances catapult them to stardom.

9-10-12 UPDATE: Certainly this Blu ray package is consistent with James Cameron's big screen vision in both the 3D version as well as the equally good 2D.  It is in 1080p of course but the original aspect ratio of 2.40:1 is slightly modified to 1.78:1.  The film is split onto 2 discs which certainly helps with video quality.  While the post-production 3D application isn't as good as Cameron's Avatar it is perhaps the best example I've seen with that process.  This is a film that focuses on grandeur and the Blu ray in either dimension looks great.  Likewise the audio is special.  It features a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 that brilliantly displays every squeek, rattle along with the collisions, explosions and screams.  The package includes: 2 new documentaries: Reflections on Titanic & Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron, 30 Deleted Scenes, 60 Behind-the-scenes Featurettes and a Digital Copy.

128539,5,0792151712,"Some movies become a part of you.  They are just so enrooted in your heart that despite their obvious, sometimes glaring flaws, you can't help but openly adore them.  `Titanic' is one of those movies.  It became a revelation upon its initial release back in 1997, and it continues to be considered one of the most beloved films in recent memory; maybe of all time.  It's generations `Gone with the Wind', `Titanic' is a sweeping romantic epic that has captured the hearts of millions and, as we all promised upon the film's conclusion, we have never let go.

I subject myself to `Titanic' roughly once a year.  It is a struggle because the minute Rose leaps from that lifeboat back into the sinking ship my tear ducts begin active duty and it's rather embarrassing, especially since I can't prevent it from happening.  With the release of the 3D version of the film I took the opportunity to try crying in public, considering that I have not seen the film on the big screen (it was released when I was twelve and my parents forbid it).  I was ecstatic, as was my wife.  This is just such a BIG movie, and event in itself, and you kind of have to see it on the big screen at least once; right?  With my bulky black glasses on, I settled into my seat (directly in the center of the theater thanks to arriving thirty minutes ahead of time) and prepared myself for the adventure once more.

It started and I literally got Goosebumps.

As I watch `Titanic', I am not blinded to the film's faults; for there are really far too many of them too ignore.  The script is atrocious.  The dialog is ridiculous (I hate it when characters detail out large amounts of information out of cinematic necessity despite the fact that NO ONE TALKS LIKE THAT).  The acting is spotty at best (Winslet is decent in the beginning, great in the closing).  Really, the film truly excels in two areas; the technical grandeur and James Cameron's dynamic direction (yes, I'm a fan of his win, even if he is not my particular winner that year).  Watching the cast muddle through such poorly conceived conversations and watching the pathetic plot points unravel could have easily became a chore.  I mean, what other film would be forgiven such horribly mediocre offerings?

I can't think of one; and yet it doesn't matter.

`Titanic' works because all these elements, no matter how mediocre they can be on their own, come together in a way that creates cinematic magic.  The chemistry between the two leads is undeniable and the whole idea of their unlikely love affair surpassing tragedy and `meaning' something becomes such a strong driving force for the film that one cannot help but become emotionally wrapped up in the film, despite what number of views one is on.

No, `Titanic' is just that one movie that gets a free pass because it is more than a movie; it is an event all its own.  The film becomes a part of you.  When Celine Dion belts out the chorus lines to `My Heart Will Go On' you can feel the emotional connection well up in your heartstrings and it's really all over from that point forward.  It doesn't make sense and it probably isn't deserved, but millions of warm blooded human beings agree; `Titanic' is one of those movies that defies logic.  Even now, fifteen years later, it still sends chills down my spine and extracts large amounts of salty tears from my eyes.",1333929600,3,3358,4.564273789649416
128540,5,0792151712,"All hats off to Mr. Cameron. Like all directors have, this is his masterpiece, and the 3D restoration is indeed worth another go round. For a new generation, this will be the first time they see it on the BIG screen, and they will be in awe. This is not what I call ""exploitation"" 3D. This is natural depth 3D, and it will make you feel like you are aboard the ship. Some scenes more impressive than others in the new format, but overall, the film was as effective, if not more so, than the 1997 showing. I cannot wait for the Blu-ray 3D release. I hope Mr. Cameron doesn't make us first buy the 2D Blu-ray like he did with AVATAR.

UPDATE, UPDATE !!!

The Blu-ray 3D is in, and WOW!!. On my projected screen size, about 10 feet wide, this movie is just amazing. To those seeing it in 3D for the first time, they cannot believe this movie was originally shot in 2D. This is total 3D perfection!. Just as good as AVATAR in 3D (taking into consideration that computer generated images usually make the best 3D movies). For those whose home theaters have 1.85:1 displays or screens, the 3D image will fill their screens completely, because Mr. Cameron decided to keep the IMAX ratio. The 2D version has stunning quality (Bit rates as high as 48 bps) and preserved the original PANAVISION theatrical ratio of 2.39:1, which does crop information from the top and the bottom, which we never knew existed. For those of us with Panavision ratio projection screens, the choice will be not to fill the sides of our screens, or to ""crop"" the 1.85 ratio like was done for the 2D version. I am projecting an image which is about 2.20:1, and I am not cropping any significant information, and the image is wider, which I personally prefer. This is a MUST have movie, especially now in Blu-ray 2D and 3D.",1333843200,2,1789,4.451219512195122
128541,5,0792151712,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE ""TITANIC in 3D"" MOVIE on BLU RAY ***

Holidaying in Ireland, I happened on the preview day of James Cameron's ""Titanic in 3D"" at the new Odeon Cinema in The Point Area of Dublin's refurbished docklands (or ""The Quays"" as they're known locally). We caught the first showing on 5 April 2012 - debuting on their all-bells-and-whistles ""iSense Screen"". ""iSense"" features razor sharp Real-3D imaging on a gigantic screen with state-of-the-art surround sound. So myself and the two kids popped along - donned the crazy specs - and started to watch. The sheer spectacle of what came next has prompted me to write this review...

I've seen about 10 films in 3D - some like ""Despicable Me"" have impressed and actually met the hype - the rest have either felt gimmicky or a downright hindrance - or worse a crass monetary exploitation. Even the new Aardman Animation feature film ""The Pirates..."" - which we'd seen some days earlier - is not great in 3D (although it's a top movie and thoroughly recommended). But Cameron's complete reshaping of ""Titanic"" into a 3D realm is a different beast. It's incredible and at times I was genuinely gobsmacked. I saw the film on its original outing in 1997 (which was a cinematic experience to say the least) and I'd estimate that 65 to 75% of this version has been improved by the 3D process with the remaining portions varying between not changed at all or just slightly better - but definitely better.

So what's changed? Scenes that were somehow 'ordinary' before are now 'dimensional' - at times you feel you could reach out and actually touch them...

Examples - the front railings of the sunken liner at the bottom of the Atlantic at the beginning of the film, the unmanned sub that is filming it then making its way through the insides of the wreck - you now feel the machine and its cables - the space around it - the bubbling of the water - the barnacles and silt disturbed to the left and right. When the engine room ship-sized pistons kick into gear as the last boilers are lit - their size and power; the drinks glasses on the table at dinner as Bruce Ismay pompously tells of how he arrived at the ship's name - they have space around them and you feel you could almost lift them off the tablecloths. Even something as unassuming as Molly Brown's decorative hat as she talks to Jack (at a later dinner table setting) now reaches out of the screen into the aisles with extraordinary depth. Winslet's costumes are glorious too - her radiant eyes and lustrous hair. The feeling of sea air and wind on the ship's gangways when Rose and Jack walk and talk and discuss art is accentuated - more realistic.

But if I was to note just one scene that sums up how improved this version is - it would be the one where Rose tries to kill herself by jumping off the back of the ship. As she steps over the railings and the camera looks down at the cold wash below - suddenly the distance and the hugeness of the ship becomes 'real' - looking downward and with that added depth - you can 'feel' that fall...that freezing water below...

The sound is huge too - groaning steel - creaking wood - the water crashing out of the screen right into your face as it floods corridors...

There were occasions where 3D didn't work - where the effect was detrimental rather than an enhancement - the boarding of the great ship at Southampton was one scene where too much was going on in the crowd sequences for the 3D to catch up. Other offences would be that one character on screen would be razor-sharp image-wise (usually the one talking) - while those beside them or to the left of them - would be slightly blurred. But these were rare.

What you also forget is what an incredible movie ""Titanic"" is. Like that other maverick filmmaker Ridley Scott (""Blade Runner"", ""Gladiator"" and ""The Kingdom Of Heaven"") - James Cameron isn't afraid of spectacle - he embraces it. He brings it to the screen with bravado and a passion for 'detail' that few have matched. His new 3D rendering of ""Titanic"" is the same - it seems like he's worked everything to give you the viewer as much as possible - or at least more than you saw the last time. And when the actual sinking finally comes in the early hours of 15 April 1912 - the horror and heartbreak still has the power to make your heart race and bring a tear to the eye. Captain Smith holding the wheel as the ocean crashes through the glass into the bridge area, the ship's funnel that breaks loose and collapses on the bodies below, the propellers rising out of the water, bodies bouncing off the ship's steel structures as the huge hull rises up and they slide downwards to their death - the camera panning back as Rose emerges from the swell to an ocean of bodies flaying about in the agony of the icy Atlantic - the guilty faces on the lucky ones in the boats that got away - hearing their screams and cries for help - yet not going back for survivors - and knowing they should...

Cameron's version of the sad tale has heart too - through all that technical excellence it doesn't forget to show - and somehow respect - the human cost. There's the rage and helplessness of the third class passengers locked into steerage below while the 'quality' on the decks above get the 'priority' placing in the lifeboats their tickets paid for - the band unselfishly playing ""Nearer My God To Thee"" as the ship goes down by the head, the priest praying with terrified passengers trying to give them strength, the elderly couple holding each other tightly on the bed as the sea floods their cabin - the Irish mum telling her two children of 'Tir na N'Og' - the mythical 'land of the young' as the inevitable closes in around her beloved...

Then of course there's the cast - Bill Paxton as the obsessed present-day treasure-seeker, Gloria Stuart as the elderly Rose recounting the tragedy to an enrapt crew, Jonathan Hyde as Bruce Ismay - the White Star Line egotist who ordered the number of lifeboats to be reduced from 48 to 16 (compliant with Board of Trade laws at the time) so as not to clutter up the promenade decks for the first-class passengers - and then once onboard practically ordering Captain Smith to open all engines to full speed ahead despite the danger (only to save himself in one of the last lifeboats - an act infamous now in history). Frances Fisher is Rose's social-climbing mum, Billy Zane as Rose's manipulative and jealous boor of a fianc, David Warner as his dastardly man-servant, Bernard Hill as the overwhelmed and ill-fated Captain Smith, 'new money' Kathy Bates as the 'unsinkable' Molly Brown - all of them exemplary. Victor Garber adds huge gravitas too as the ship's architect Thomas Andrews - a decent man grappling with his thoughts as it all falls apart around him (his dialogue titles this review).

But the movie belongs to its two young leads - Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose - a 17-year-old lady of art and means who falls in love with a 20-year old street-rat who paints to survive. While DiCaprio is good and couldn't go anywhere for a few years due to screaming girls (he was 22 at the time) - it's Winslet who impresses the most. She is sensational in the role - voluptuous, ballsy and humane. She also exudes an acting confidence that is staggering for a 21-year-old. In my book only Kiera Knightley gets this close to that kind of inner belief.

With regard to the 3D Film on BLU RAY (Sept 2012) - it arrives in multiple versions - a 2D Standard Blu Ray set, this 4-disc 3D version and a DELUXE BOX SET with memorabilia. There are 6 hours of extras, over 25 deleted scenes and endless in-depth interviews. It's a feast of detail. And there's also no doubt in my mind that Cameron has given '3D' a huge boost with this extraordinary rendering of his 1997 classic...

To sum up - even if you don't want to see this film again - and suffer through that dreadful Celine Dion schlock song at the end - think of James Cameron's ""Titanic in 3D"" as sheer cinematic spectacle. My kids are 18 and 14 - and given that their generation is so easily bored and their timespan for attention virtually nil - they didn't notice the three-hours-plus playing time go by. In fact my son Sean announced at the end ""...that was a great film Dad...really good."" I could see it in his young face - he was genuinely moved by what he'd just seen.

Praise indeed.",1333756800,340,8390,4.507560815253123

Well, I think James Cameron wanted to set the scene which he did in a beautiful way, look he won 11 Oscars!  I was thinking about it since it's re-released now on 3D.
  This movie has a beautiful love story. Rose is being treated like dirt by an angry, controlling husband and almost jumps into the scary ocean & runs into adventurous Jack who saved her life. They fall in love and share passionate times together.  Along with some great special effects.  What's not to love about this movie, even though it is sad.

128576,1,0792151712,"I wrote a review on ""A night to remember"" and said it was better than this movie, I still stand by that statement.  Here's why, do you have to have fictional characters in an historical movie to connect with your audience, NO. A night to remember had you invested in all the characters involved, even the drunk baker. Which was historically accurate, but here. Cameron seems to think that a movie about an historical event must have fictional characters, point number two. There is no way on God's green earth, that a steerage passenger would have been allowed up in the first class area to rescue Rose, the code of conduct was so strict between classes. As accurately portrayed in ""S.O.S Titanic"" when second class passenger Lawrence Beesley asked his friend about joining the third class passengers in a deck game, to which the friend replied it wouldn't be proper. While the sets and costumes looked good, this movie lacked substance. I actually liked the made for T.V movie with Catherine Zeta Jones, over this crap. My only problem with that movie is the rape scene, this movie tried to put 21st century dialouge and actions into a world that it doesn't fit. For instance, while yes Molly Brown was rich. She was looked on as grudgingly accepted by her class, but only because of her money. The people who blindly accept this movie, also overlook the fact, that a woman in 1912. Never spoke back to her husband, in fact they never spoke unless spoken to first. A wife stood by her husband in that time period, no matter how he treated her, because he was the head of his house no questions asked. That's why, when Molly Brown took over the life boat in real life, well Molly Brown herself contradicted the whole code of the first class. Just like when John Jacob Astor married his second wife, it wasn't that she was so young. But that he had just divorced his first wife, and on his second honeymoon his second wife is pregnant. He was actually ostracised by the first class for that, this movie failed in a big way. No had it been a fictional ship, then maybe, but history and class are against this movie, even if Jack had been able to rescue rose the first time. He most certainly would not have been able to passed off as a first class passenger, no matter how hard they tried. This movie tried to look at the tradgedy through modern day eyes, and it doesn't work. I was more involved in the characters, because they were actually there. I'm sorry, but you don't need a fictional couple to tell the story of the Titanic.",1331683200,6,2530,4.524017467248909

128617,5,0792151712,"About 40 minutes plus into Titanic, we see a lady named Rose running along the side of the ship. The reason? Well lets start with: She has a near-big life living with her moronic tramp excuse for a mother, is engaged to a complete ass of a man named Cal Hockley, who is the son of a laid-back mother in case you're wondering, both mothers have a ton of money, and does Cal-- I could go on all day. The real issue is: Rose sees a little girl in 1 of the Titanic's dining room, getting prepared for dinner. The real horror to Rose comes when the girl's napkin is letting settled on her lap by her rich mother. The reason for her horror is because the fictional character Rose is said to 17, an age where anyone that young can get confused about whats normal and whats not. ""Is being spoiled normal?"" seems to be the question on Rose's mind, but its not shown. In place of that, Rose runs out to the back end rail of Titanic, and is seeming like ready to attempt suicide, that is until a young man named Jack, who in movie really is as far from ""normal"" as someone can possibly get, shows up to convince her not to jump to the freezing waters of the N. Atlantic. Jack is poor guy/slash artist, whose pictures I won't go into detail with for the sake of my account getting in trouble, and I'm sure people are curious as to why this writer in his 20's is giving this movie a Perfect 5.

The reason why to me Titanic is excellent on a grand scale, is not because of the love story that exists here, though the formula does work on account of movie genius James Cameron. Its because of the realism that does exist within the story that Cameron conjures. The story is a team of scientists are looking for the ""Heart Of The Ocean"", a heart-shaped necklace said to have sunk with the Titanic back in April 1912. Even though the necklace couldn't be found, another clue soon has them meet with the older Rose 8 decades removed from the Titanic tragedy. Then is where she tells her story about her being on Titanic, and meeting Jack, and the event when the Titanic accidentally strikes an iceberg, and then dooming the cruise ship said to be biggest thing built by human hands.

The sequence where the Titanic last calls on its sinking is probably the craziest, saddest and horrifying event I've ever seen, much devastating is that it did actually happen, and then the ship finally sinks resulting in hundreds dead.

I don't understand why people are shooting this movie to pieces. After this, I do have a new respect for James Cameron. I thought it was gonna be horrible myself. WAKE UP!",1327104000,,2576,4.3625

128619,5,0792151712,"Director James Cameron has outdone himself.  We all know the famous story of the sunken ship, Titanic.  Thanks to Cameron, we got a chance to really experience it.  It is heartwarming and definitely tear jerking in most parts.  I felt sucked in to the scenes and was riding the Titanic with the two lovers throughout the movie, Rose and Jack.  Rose DeWitt Bukater arrives on the Titanic, dreading the upcoming marriage of her and an obnoxious but very rich man.  Her mother is now penniless, and is forcing the marriage.  Rose couldn't be any more depressed as the ship of dreams begins to float through the ocean.
One night on the ship Rose goes to the dock, to the very tip of the ship.  She almost jumps to take her life, but is stopped by a young man, Jack.  This is the first encounter between the two opposites, a first-class woman and a poor young man who only got a ticket on the ship through a game of poker.  Though opposites, they make the perfect pair and you can already feel the love flowing between them.  They meet each other more and more, much despised by Rose's mother and fianc.  You're so caught up in the romance between Rose and Jack that you forget all about the tragic end that will come to them and the ship there on.  A scene that resulted in many tears for most was when the ship had already sunk and hundreds of people we're floating in the freezing water.  Jack had gotten a piece of wood for Rose to lay on instead of staying in the icy ocean.  They hold their hands, shivering to death.  Rose gives up as she sees no way to survive it.  Jack forces her to hold on to life and promises that she will survive, grow up, and raise a beautiful family.  Though Jack's beautiful promise came true, the same fate couldn't be said for him.  He died like many others in the deathly cold ocean.  The actors we're excellent in this scene.  You felt all of their pain and despair and your heart ached for them both.
The special effects weren't as great as they could have been, but did include a fascinating model of the Titanic.  It was specially made to be able to break in half after it hit the iceberg.  The movie was long but you barely noticed as you we're so caught up in the romantic story.  The rating of the movie is PG-13 which is appropriate because of the dead bodies scattered everywhere in the water and all of the terror when the ship is sinking.  The whole story is being told by the older version of Rose many years later.  She is being interviewed about her experience on the Titanic.  The last scene of the movie is a bit surprising and beautiful. It was a great ending to a great movie.  Actors Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio, who played Rose and Jack, were excellent.

128622,5,0792151712,"TITANIC, that preposterously beautiful film made in 1997 with a very young Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet, James Cameron's Magnum Opus, continues to impress, especially when viewed yet again on New Year's Day 2012 - a fifteen year old film that remains one of the most impressive cinematic achievements from Hollywood. One of the many reasons it remains resonant is the manner in which the film addresses class systems - the wealthy versus the poor is a hot topic today and the film shows us why - and the extraordinary cinematic recreation of the sinking of that mighty ship.

But for many the manner in which Cameron sets the tone of the story, the reminiscence of the elderly Rose unraveling the tale to her granddaughter and crew of ship Keldysh attempting to raise the Titanic now 84 years on the bottom of the ocean and carrying that theme through the course of the film, seems more cogent today than even at movie's release.  Gloria Stewart is radiant as the old Rose and her rapt audience includes Bill Paxton, Suzy Amis, Lewis Abernathy, Nicholas Cascone, and Anatoly M. Sagalevitch.  From there the opulence of the 'unsinkable' Titanic unfolds and the gradual love affair between Rose Bukater (Kate Winslet) and poor artist Jack Dawson (Leonardo Di Caprio), a relationship at risk from the brewings of Rose's mother (Frances Farmer) and Rose's intended (Billly Zane). The cruise lasted from April 10, 1912 to April 15, 1912, but it was a lifetime of commitment between the young lovers.

In retrospect the performances by some fine actors who would continue to rise is of note: Ioan Gruffudd, Victor Garber, David Warner, Danny Nucci etc.  The film could have used some editing to reduce the length, and the presence of the unsinkable Molly Brown (Kathy Bates in a wasted role) though historically accurate ads very little to the film and even distracts a bit.  Still TITANIC is just that - titanic - and no matter how many times we see it, it never fails to impress.  Grady Harp, January 12",1325462400,,2006,4.797101449275362

Unusually for Hollywood, it seems to be historically accurate, too.

There's outstanding performances from Leonardo de Caprio and Kate Winslet in a lovely love story. The main villain of this piece is the class system, but the minor ones are believable and accordingly, hateful.  Stunning photography. Never would you believe that harrowing scene in the icy water was filmed in a swimming pool... Well, it's all been said before.

Almost unbearably sad...I was so glad that the ending shows an other worldly (or dream, depending on how you interpret it) reunion.",1320796800,,576,5.228260869565218

128708,5,0792151712,"On a moonless, bone chilling night, Titanic sputtered and gasped before plummeting into the frigid ocean waters of the Atlantic on the fateful night of April 14,  1912. A chorus of frantic cries echoed through a sea of bobbing heads and flailing limbs begging for their lives. ""Come back...., come back."" A symphony of pleas from passengers treading water between remnants of jagged iceberg that ripped through Titanic's impenetrable hull less than one hour earlier. Only one boat came back. R.M.S. Titanic's maiden voyage is reborn through the eyes of a red- haired beauty named Rose DeWitt Bukater and poker playing vagabond named Jack Dawson. The riveting demise of the ""unsinkable"" Titanic is depicted in the 1997 feature film. A chronicle of human courage, deceit, and technical catastrophe that invites movie goers to journey back in time and witness a tale of romance, opulence, and the stark division between the poor and power of the wealthy.
Yearning for the chance to travel, artist, Jack Dawson, bets everything he owns in a game of poker to win tickets to board the ""unsinkable"" Titanic. A smoke filled room, sweat glistening on his brow, each player displays his cards. Jack, a cigarette protruding from his mouth, grins as he lays his playing cards face-up on the ash- covered table. Jack's opponents faces were etched with disbelief. Vagabond Jack, going wherever he pleases, wins a once in a lifetime voyage aboard the Titanic. Celebrating, Jack gathers his things and sprints to the grandest ship, the Titanic. Red-haired beauty, Rose DeWitt Bukater, boards the ship accompanied by her mother and fianc, Cal Hockley. She is lead to the luxurious 1st class, as Jack settles in his bunk in 3rd class.
Although born into wealth, Rose's family was enduring economic struggles, and to redeem the family wealth and name, her mother decided on arranged marriage. Feeling as if no one could understand her, Rose, her face drenched in tears, runs to the back of the ship. Climbing over the railing, thoughts of suicide ran through Rose's mind. She had no other way out. Jack, memorized by her beauty, ran to her rescue. He began to remove his coat and shoes, readying himself to dive into the frigid waters after her, while encouraging Rose not to jump, getting him off the hook. Rose grabs Jack's hand as he pulls her up, she suddenly slips, falling. Jack uses all of his strength to pull her back over the railing. As a token of gratitude, Cal invites Jack to dinner in the 1st class the next night. On the Titanic, there was a great difference between the 1st class and the 3rd class, the 1st class had luxurious rooms and were highly thought of. The 3rd class was housed on the lowest levels of the Titanic, the so called steerage. They also were thought of differently compared to the rich of 1st class. The movie depicted this difference accurately. They repeatedly showed how beautiful and artistic the 1st class rooms were and how the 3rd class rooms were like steerage, filled with bunk beds.
In the aftermath of dinner, Jack invites Rose to what he calls `a real party'. Jack and Rose dance to their hearts content in the 3rd class party. In a smoke filled, beer covered, jam packed room, Rose feels herself relax and enjoy herself. In the days after, Rose realizes that she has fallen in love with Jack Dawson. They share their first kiss on the stern of the Titanic, as the sun sets. Aware of his artistic talent, Rose ask Jack to draw her wearing nothing, but the Hope Diamond. Jack and Rose explore the ship, and make their way to the deck. The sailors on the lookout for icebergs, peer into the moonless night, searching for the ship's only enemy. ""Iceberg straight ahead!"" the lookouts frantically called. In a panic, they try to turn the ship. However, the ship is moving too fast, and as a result of her massive structure, she cannot turn fast enough. The side of Titanic collides with the jagged iceberg. Ocean water rapidly pours into Titanic. Passengers are being told that they are not to worry, but should put on their life-jackets. James Cameron does a very good job of reenacting the ship's impact with the iceberg and sinking. The components of the music playing in the background and how the actors portrayed their characters make you feel as if you are on board the R.M.S. Titanic. You can feel the confusion, worry, and fear of the passengers. As the Captain gave orders to start filling the lifeboat, I felt as if I was there, and I needed to save my own life. The events leading up to the final moments of Titanic, show Rose, Jack, and Cal's true colors. How Cal despises Jack and wants him dead. The love that Rose and Jack feel for one another and how they would risk their own lives to save each other. As the ship plunges into the water of the Atlantic, it was very evident that everyone feared for their own lives. When the ship makes its final appearance then disappears, Cameron does a fabulous job in demonstrating how frantic and afraid the passengers were. ""Come back... come back."" They pleaded for the lifeboats to come back and save them. This scene gave me the chills. I felt as if I was in the bitter cold water. Rose and Jack were stuck in the water, fighting for their lives.
The costumes for the various characters and extras were very specific in how they had to look. They had to look like the clothing that people wore in that time period. The costume designers went to thrift shops to find the exact look that they wanted. The set was extraordinary. They had built one side of the ship. However, the model ship was smaller than the original. To compensate for this, they used green screens and scaled models to show how the different rooms and hallways looked like. A majority of scenes of the ship were computer generated. However, the crew depicted the ship's breaking in half and other significant events accurately.
Throughout the entire movie it was evident that love conquers all. Love is enough to give you the strength to survive and fight. Rose and Jack would always say ""I'll never let go."", ""If you jump, I jump."" This showed how much lust they had for each other. It makes you imagine of that happening to you. It all started out with Rose, who was raised to be ladylike and with money, in 1st class and Jack, a man who has no money, is an artist, and goes wherever he pleases, in 3rd class. It is almost unbelievable that two people who were complete opposites fall in love. This is what makes The Titanic a story of romance and lust. It was ironic that this love story takes place on the R.M.S Titanic's first and only voyage. That is what makes Titanic one of the most well known, and successful movies. It makes you come back for more. Titanic takes you back in time to the decks of the R.M.S. Titanic, and relive the tragic night of April 14, 1912.",1319328000,,6827,4.632838283828383

But I thought the romance aspect of the movie was the biggest lot of trash I have ever seen. The truth is that a woman of that social class would not have looked sideways as a boy (and I emphasize 'boy') from the lower ranks. Also no woman of that social setting would have been well-versed in theories of psychology as our heroinne was.

Instead, they find a nude drawing of a woman named Rose, who was wearing the necklace the night Titanic sank. Rose is now an elderly lady, and tells Brock and his team her story aboard the Titanic.

In 1912, teen-aged Rose is a first-class passenger, and going to England with her fianc Cal. Meanwhile, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson wins a ticket aboard the Titanic. When Rose wants to commit suicide, Jack talks her out of it, and they soon start a relationship, defying Cal and her mom. Soon, Titanic hits the iceberg and slowly begins to sink. Every passing minute, Jack and Rose try to find a way off the doomed ship together or not at all.

I have not seen Titanic in close to 15 years, when I saw it for the first time since I was maybe 13, an hour and a half into the movie I became overwhelmed with emotion.  One, I forgot how much I got attached to Jack & Rose and even Cal too.  The actors did such an amazing fantastic job, this movie is why I originally wanted to study film and theatre.  Not only do I get emotionally attached to the characters, but the fact that I did my research after this film came out, that ultimately, I was not able to finish watching the second dvd.  With that said, I have a review #2 and it goes like this:

As much as I love love love this movie, I was a bit disappointed when I saw the ""pods"" on the Special Features parts- they all are only at least 30 seconds long each.  I know the movie made more money so that they can afford to have hours and hours, minutes and minutes left of behind the scenes, rehearsals, more extras, interviews with Leo, Kate and Billy.  There really could have been a lot more in this Collector's Edition and I'm hoping perhaps for a 20 year edition, there is more to it.",1304121600,,1159,4.097345132743363

128828,4,0792151712,"This is a great set, lots of extras, but one major drawback. The movie doesn't have an extended eddition. In order to watch the video with the deleted scenes playing where they should be in the movie, you would have to do some major video editing, or run 2 disks at once and swap between viewing the movie disk and the extras disk, and you would have to know exactly where the scenes go, because half the time it doesn't tell you where they go in the movie.

Other than that this set doesn't have many flaws in my opinion.

Titanic is a good love story, epic historical tale and there are tons of extras, commentaries, etc etc. All in all it's worth the cash to buy this if you are looking for a good Titanic set.",1301616000,,713,4.197080291970803
128829,5,0792151712,"Just a few thoughts...

What else can be said about Titanic (1997)?  After nearly 2,200 Amazon reviews, here's one more.  I give this movie a 5-star rating.  It won 11 Academy Awards.  It's sad, interesting, entertaining, suspenseful, scary, and romantic all rolled into one.  The acting is great.  Kate Winslet plays the role of Rose very well, but I think the best actor in the whole movie was Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson.  Billy Zane, who played Cal, also did a great job.  He's my favorite character in the whole movie.  Really, every actor did a great job - Frances Fisher, Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Bernard Hill, everybody.  The script is great, the special effects are great, the story is great.

For MANY YEARS after this movie came out, I've been hearing Celine Dion's song playing everywhere.  I must say it drives me nuts.  Some songs just get on my nerves.  That's one of them.  An overdone song that's played WAY too much over the airwaves.  You can't go anywhere without hearing it.  And you know what?  It doesn't fit in with the movie too well, in my opinion.  Too commercial, too much of a sellout.  Now, the musical score by James Horner was good and fits the movie well.

Overall, this is a great epic movie that I highly recommend.",1301270400,2,1258,4.597285067873303
128830,5,0792151712,My daughters are true romantics and we about wore out our videotape so decided to upgrade to a DVD. Now it's getting even more mileage!,1301011200,,135,4.44
128831,5,0792151712,"Saw this movie when I was 8 or 9 years old in theaters and ever since then I was hooked. This movie receives alot of flack mostly because of it's success. This is probably the most romantic movie ever made. It has a great love story, and it has a great action sequence in the realism of the sinking of Titanic. If anything, at least watch the moving for the sinking sequence. The reason they have a love story in the movie is so that it will tug at our hearts more when the sinking and death starts taking place. Its easier to feel the kind of pain the women who had to leave their husbands behind, when you see the main characters you have grown to love in the same situation. Every rendition of Titanic, with exception to A Night to Remember, has had some kind of love story, and if you want a successful movie, you have to have a plot, not just a documentary.

Don't listen to anyone who downs on this movie because I have seen far worse such as Gone with the Wind, which is both racist and historically inaccurate, if people are going to fawn over a movie like that, then what is wrong with Titanic? Nothing, most people hate it because of how much hype surrounded it.

Titanic is the big romance flick of our generation the way movies like Gone with the Wind and Casablanca were 60-70 years ago. It is a true classic and 40 years from now, people are going to look back at this movie the same way society looks back at old movies, even the worst, as great films.

As for the dvd features, I have the 3 disc version which includes a 10 minute deep sea dive, and 45 minutes worth of deleted scenes. If you decide to buy Titanic, shell out more for the 3 disc 2005 version because the 2008 2 Disc 10th Anniversary edition, is basically the first 2 discs of the Collector's edition minus the most interesting features (deleted scenes). I plan to see this movie when it is rereleased in theaters next year, and I hope they put it out on blu ray soon or make another, more spectacular dvd release that beats the 3 disc version.

I also suggest getting Ghosts of the Abyss as a great companion to this, its basically an even longer more recent (2002) deep sea dive to Titanic.",1300233600,2,2174,4.269417475728155

128917,5,0792151712,"Although there were other films with the Titanic, no one but James Cameron put it into a fictional setting and still paid tribute to the film's history as well as Cameron has.

A top box office hit for many, many years until Avatar (also directed by Cameron), Titanic sticks to history's facts regarding the tale, but plays us with a love story, as well as statements regarding the aristocracy.

I'm sure the dear reader is already familiar with the basic plot of Titanic:  a scientist who has spent three years preparing for a salvage operation of the Titanic to look for a fabulous diamond that was rumored to be in the safe.  He discovers it's not there!

We then find an elderly woman who is flown in to tell her tale.  The tale of Rose and Jack.  Now simplistically it may be seen as a movie where she meets this great guy and their adventures together.  But the script is a bit more complex than that!

Themes:

The aristocracy versus the working class is a main theme.  In fact, Rose's mother, facing destitution, sees her daughter marrying into millions is the only way to avert disaster.  Rose however feels trapped by her aristocratic traditions and just wants out.  And if suicide is the only out, then so be it.

Another theme is free spirit.  Jack takes a chance and wins a couple of tickets to the Titanic's maiden voyage.  He and his Italian friend get on board just as the ropes are cast.  What an adventure!  I would have liked to see more scenes of Jack and his friend as well as how they deal with their roommates, since the tickets belonged to ""Sven"" and they have no clue who Jack is.

Anyway, Jack and Rose collide.  Their worlds are forever changed.  That is, until the Titanic makes its own collision with an errant iceberg!

Another theme is pride and arrogance.  The captain is convinced by one of his solicitors that if he turns on all steam engines and comes into New York ahead of schedule, what headlines they will make.  But by doing so, the ship goes so fast and it's so big that it cannot turn on a dime, much less a quarter, and this makes quite an impact with passengers and crew.

Finally, the theme of the lower class.  Rose shows Jack high society.  Jack then shows Rose the goings on below decks with an Irish jig and a few drinking games that get a bit wild.  Which is it Rose?  High society and arrogant pride, or a free spirit and living your life as you choose?

Bottom Line:  Although the audience knows it's not really looking at an ocean liner, the epic effects, the musical themes, the sound effects of the disaster are clearly not being put aside.  The crowds of people dying in the water, the blockheads of the White Star Line running the lifeboats who do not attempt rescue are both shocking and disturbing.

You will be disturbed, shocked, enamored and amazed by what Cameron has done with Titanic.  It holds up as well in 2010 as it did in 1997.

Rewatch it -- re-experience the magic of an early 20th century disaster that held a world of hope and despair within and without its hull intact!

128921,3,0792151712,"Of all the movies made about the fabled and tragic sinking of the Titanic, this one is definitely the most entertaining. The attention toward costume and set detail is impressive, except women did not wear nearly that much makeup in 1912. Lipstick was fairly new and didn't really become mainstream until the later part of the decade. On the other hand, I sat next to a couple of teenage girls while watching Titanic in the theatre. Upon the scene of Rose's entrance on Titanic, one girl said to the other, ""My mother said they never would have worn that color back then."" Her mother was wrong. Lavender was an extremely popular color at this time and often found in young ladies attire. Rose was supposed to have just come from a shopping trip in Paris and the costume designer took great pains to give her the most cutting edge wardrobe any girl could have in 1912.
Aside from the asthetic trivial, this movie does its fair share of ""keeping the mystic alive"". There has always been considerable mystery shrouding the sinking of the Titanic. This is largely due to the media's inability (or refusal) to ever really set the story straight. Why, if the mystery is taken away, movies may not sell tickets, books may not sell off shelves, this is a long fabled tragedy that can make some people some money...if they tell the story in a way that sells.
It is interesting in the movie Titanic, Rose tells Cal, ""It doesn't look any bigger than the Mauretania."" Whereupon Call responds, ""Titanic is bigger and far more luxurious..""  A myth buster would have been had the scene played more like: Rose says, ""It doesn't look any bigger than the Olympic."" Cal could not have responded as he did in his answer regarding the comparison to Cunard's Mauretania. The Olympic was the Titanic's sister ship. The first of 3 new luxury liners from White Star, the Olympic was the first one built, the first one launched, the last to survive, and was every bit as big as it's little sister Titanic. The Titanic was heavier than the Olympic, concentrated on a few more luxury suites with private promenades, more restaurants, and smaller luxurious details such as a clock on the landing of the forward grand staircase (yes, there were 2, the forward grand staircase is the one that gets all the publicity, but the aft grand staircase was nearly identical). In fact, the Olympic and the Titanic were so identical in construction and design, the only way you could tell them apart from the outside was from such details as the forward portion of the promenade deck being glassed in on the Titanic, whereas on the Olympic it was not. So much for ""the biggest ship in the world"". Olympic had been sailing for nearly a year before the Titanic and was every bit as big-just not as heavy. The Britannic, the 3rd of the White Star line's sister ships, was even more luxurious than Titanic and was being built as the Titanic sunk. This ship, sadly saw only war time activity, being converted into a hospital ship for World War I, then sunk. Besides, it would only be a couple of more years until another ship came along that was bigger than the Olympic, Titanic, and last built Britannic. Do you know which ship that was?
Another thing this movie does to sell tickets but really dates the movie was the most unfortunate decision to make fools and/or villains out of all the rich folk on board. This is perhaps the most blatant misrepresentation this film has to offer. If it were not for this wealthy class of people, the Titanic would never have been built! Not to mention the immense number of jobs many of these wealthy people created for others. The way this movie demonizes the rich and the defined classes between the people is a crime. Right or wrong, that is simply the way it was. It was so strongly entrenched for such a long period of time, we still see traces of this today. Airlines still have a ""first class"" to this very day, although, the accommodations these days for first class anything are nothing compared to what they were on board a luxury ocean liner in 1912. Captain Smith was made a martyr in the film. In real life, Captain Smith had quite a string of maritime mishaps..........the man just wasn't great at seamanship to say the least. Although, Captain Smith was not on the bridge when the Titanic struck the iceberg. He had gone to bed. He left orders to wake him if anything looked doubtful regarding the many ice warnings received by Titanic that day. The movie so demonizes, or flat out ignores the real actions of the first class passengers while filming most of the action around 1srt class! Poor 2nd class is NEVER covered. It will be always first or 3rd class passages that get the most publicity. To site a couple of instances with 1st class passengers who come off extremely underrated are: The Countess of Rothes. In the movie, the Countess of Rothes may only utter no more than 2 words, and the actress hired to play her was not nearly as beautiful as the real Countess was. The movie fails to mention that the Countess of Rothes handled the tiller of lifeboat 8 because none of the men knew how to do it! Furthermore, when rescued by the Carpathia, the Countess of Rothes helped out on deck to make sure other survivors had blankets and were comfortable, etc. When a Titanic officer present in lifeboat 8 was asked at the inquisition just how it came about that her ladyship, the Countess of Rothes, ended up handling the tiller of the life boat, the officer said so very tactfully, ""Well, the lady had quite a bit to say about the matter."" For someone who wasn't given more than 2 lines to say in the movie, and in actuality played an important and heroic part in manning one of the lifeboats, I'd say the Countess was severely misrepresented to suit the current times of 1997.
Rose herself stands in the dining room criticizing them all. While she herself and her mother are traveling under the disguise as being well to do and staying in the most luxurious suites Titanic has to offer payed for by her fianc! This would have been completely unacceptable etiquette in 1912.
Molly Brown is the only 1st class passenger who comes off remotely well. Alas, she is from a poor class working people and has run into money with her husband. Separate movies and plays will be done about this woman and her actions on in the lifeboat, but not on word toward someone who did the same thing, the Countess of Rothes, in a life boat that was hoisted up by the Carpathia the same as Molly Brown's.  The fact is it was actually far more unusual for someone like a Countess to handle the tiller of a lifeboat than someone like Molly Brown to handle the rowing in her life boat. Nobody ever in the entire world gets that. They were both hero's. But, I'd wager to say the Countess did more than Mrs. Brown that night and was far more out of her element in doing so.
They make fun of the builder of the Titanic. As if he didn't have a clue as to who Sigmund Freud really was. It is very unlikely that J. Bruce Ismay would not have conveyed the meaning of Rose's callus remark.
Another myth buster is the amount of well known wealthy passengers in first class. Many people confuse super natural irony with the natural course of the wealthy set of the day. The truth is, it was not at all unusual for there to be so many well known wealthy passengers in first class. It would have been more unusual had there not been. In fact, there were fewer well to do sailing on the Titanic's maiden voyage than would be expected. In this day and age, the gilded age, the wealthy were treated the way our movie stars are today. Their lives were followed and read about at every turn. If there was some big world event taking place, it was not at all unusual for them to see one another there. It was expected for many to be at such events, and the maiden voyage of the most luxurious ocean liner in the world would qualify as such an event. And so, there they were.
There are a number of other equally qualifying issues I could continue with, but I think you get my drift, so to speak. The movie Titanic is very entertaining. I love to watch it. Just don't look too much into it for serious fact.",1287705600,,8177,4.498318762609281

128987,2,0792151712,"As a recent subscriber to Netflix, I finally got around to watching Titanic. At the time of its release, I had heard both plaudits for and censure of this film, one of the most celebrated in the history of the Academy Awards. The movie left me with an impression analogous to my assessment of the Harry Potter novels: to quote the eponymous subject of the masterful film Capote, ""I don't understand what the fuss is all about.""

Simply put, the film really has nothing of interest to tell us -- no information of more than superficial value. The dialogue is a melange of cliches; the acting, with the exception of the British shiphands and captain (Bernard Hill gives a characteristically noble performance as the captain), is utterly saccharine and devoid of any credibility; and the plot is monotonous at best.

Most of the praise of this movie stems, as far as what I can see, from the belief that millions of moviegoers can't be wrong. Even the Amazon editorial reviewer feels compelled to mention the film's box office success, which seems to me to be irrelevant to a critical evaluation. Of course, many of the film's detractors are saying that the premise of the movie -- a story of thwarted passion against the backdrop of one of history's greatest manmade catastrophes -- simply can't work. This has perhaps become a cliched critical position in itself, but I would at least argue that it is incredible that Cameron would have us believe that this is anything other than the lustful pairing of a bored hussy who has become disillusioned with upper-class society to an on-the-make street urchin who at first sight is beady-eyed for a woman who is beyond his social milieu, then driven forward by the thrill of adventure and the hunt. At best, though the underlying idea might be superficially appealing, the development of a profound love affair is implausible within the four-day time frame of Titanic's voyaging existence.

The overarching problem that detracts from any ability to have a more workable plot is Cameron's meretricious focus on visuals. I have to confess myself being initially wowed by the special effects -- the rending of the ship and the plunging of the upper half into the Atlantic, the inner workings of the engine room, the underwater sequences. But in the end, it comes across as nothing other than sensationalism and the creation of cheap suspense through action. And it's all so far-fetched anyway, whether it's Rose's rescue of Jack from the ship's ""dungeon"" after being imprisoned for allegedly stealing the diamonds or Jack's last-minute unlocking of the gate for him and his ""soulmate"" to avert drowning. Such sequences as these offer the viewer a cheap thrill that is soon overcome by the question of why we should care a whit about Jack's and Rose's moral sham of a relationship when many other more worthy people around them are plummeting to their deaths.

The movie's banality comes to a climactic point in the ending sequence in which Rose, now a centagenarian and the Titanic's sole remaining survivor, drops the jewel that her former fiance had given her. What was perhaps intended to be a culminating message of quiescence, as Rose lets go a memento from her past into the rippling vastness of the deep, ended up being to me an annoying reminder of the scene in which Rose and Jack first meet, at that same place, when Rose is about to melodramatically leap to her death (possibly one of the most overworked, shamelessly indulgent suicide attempts in movie history). ""Why, oh why, couldn't they just slip their footing and rid us of their inane trifling repartee for ever?"" I asked myself.

Even if one excuses the obvious lack of reflection that went into making this movie, it all just simply goes on too long. Every moment you want it to end, it drags into another meaningless action scene, image, or piece of drivelly dialogue. Those who want to be encapsulated inside a cocoon filled with sickening sweetness for three hours may enjoy this. Me, I like to think when watching a movie.

128988,3,0792151712,"Back in the early 2000's, I used to watch James Cameron's Titanic numerous times when it was still on VHS. Now that I come back to it, my appreciation of the film has slightly waned. I'd still recommend it, but only for specific reasons. The flaws are clearer to me now than back when I still had a VCR player. First off, I would like to say that the dialogue is truly cheesy. The words spoken by the main characters (especially Jack, Rose, and Cal) come straight out of a sappy soap opera. Plus, the love story is one for the female audience; men won't be interested in it, anyway. I myself don't find the love story very intriguing, but at least we care for the main leads. But dialogue and romance aside, the film remains a visual masterpiece. The ship looks fantastic. It is so accurately detailed (the staircase, the boiler rooms, the promenade deck, etc.), that it almost looks exactly like the real RMS Titanic. And of course, we shouldn't forget about the second half of the film. Believe it or not, the sinking of the ship is one of the most spectacular displays of tragedy ever put on film. It's still amazing that 1,500+ people perished in the Atlantic.

Again, the sappy romance and the horrible dialogue (and a small fragment of James Horner's score) are the weakest links of the film, but the rest of the film works. Watch Titanic for its astonishing visuals, and for the powerful second half of the film.

The romance is still presented in a marvelous way, and it's what I walk away from the film remembering, even though I went into it for the fancy 1900's era visuals.

129014,5,0792151712,"One of the greatest romantic adventures of the 1990s, involving passionate romance, intrigue, adventure and danger.
This movie both resurrects the Titanic ocean liner and it's fate, and creates a an intricate romance against it's backdrop.
Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) is trapped in loveless engagement with the wealthy but arrogant and  cold hearted Caledon Nathan ""Cal"" Hockley (Billy Zane), and is rescued from ending it all by third class passenger  Jack Dawson (Leonardo Di Caprio).
Against the wishes of Cal and her mother, Rose falls into a passionate romance with Jack, who paints her in the nude wearing  the necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean.
This article provides the basis of the framing device as the 101 year old Rose (Gloria Stuart 84 years later explains the story to the treasure hunter Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) and his team who are exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic,.
Gripping throughout with a phenomenal ending. The captivating Kate Winslet is perfect for the part of the spirited young Rose, and De Caprio provides an energetic and irrepressible hero in Jack Dawson.
Spellbinding, gripping and heartbreaking scenes of the disaster itself. Memorable and heart wrenching is the scene of an Irish mother putting her young children to sleep with a bedtime story just before the ship sinks with them.
Appearance also by Kathy Bates as the real life heroine of the Titanic Molly Brown.
This has captivated millions of viewers with good reason.",1266278400,2,1509,5.052208835341365
129015,5,0792151712,"""Titanic"" (1997) was the world's top grossing movie until director James Cameron did ""Avatar."" Cameron also directed this blockbuster. It tells two tragic stories: the story of the ill-fated ship and the story of a doomed shipboard romance aboardship. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson and Kate Winslet as Rose. DiCaprio's boyish looks and slim body opposite Kate's rather chunky, hippy body make him prettier and more lithe than she. Both are captivating. It's probably Di Caprio's best role because it fits his youth and personality.
 There's some fanciful and improbable stuff going on in the bow of the ship. I've never been on a cruise ship yet where passengers had such access to the bow so they could stand up and act like they're the ship's fugureheads. In an early scene DiCaprio and his buddy are in the bow; how two steerage passengers got access to it is beyond belief. Later there are the famous scenes of the lovers cavorting at the bow. In several early scenes DiCaprio from Steerage seems to have too much run of the ship.
 The overhead shots of the ship are very impressive: the camera glides over the majestic funnels and decks from stern to bow. The technical features of the movie are quite well done. The ship's architect is aboard as is the president of the company, Ismay, who wants to see the ship break TransAtlantic speed records. The captain does not want to push the engines to capacity especially in iceberg-infested waters. The ship is reliant on two lookouts in the crow's nest to spot bergs.
 The two lovers, even as the ship is sinking, are pursued by Rose's manic, wild-eyed fianc (actor Billy Zane) and a gun-toting bodyguard. They're like classic Perils of Pauline villains. (Cameron never strays too far from the roots of cinema even when he's doing his breakthrough technical shenanigans.) Melodrama for sure, but what could have been more melodramatic than an unsinkable liner going down on its maiden voyage? The gutsy, outspoken Unsinkable Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) is aboard.
 The story is framed by a story within a story with an expedition exploring the ship's remains in the 1980's being the framing story. The centenarian Rose flies out to the discovery ship and relives her love affair. It's a great romantic movie of young love combined with a disaster flick.",1265673600,,2315,4.868020304568528
129016,5,0792151712,"In my youth, I mostly had eyes for Leo. I put away this movie for a long time assuming it was just a teenage phase, but pulling it out again years later just cements its real value.

Titanic was written and directed by James Cameron and was basically his baby for years. This movie won 11 Oscars. This movie tells the story of the tragic sinking of grandest ship ever made on her maiden voyage through the eyes of young lovers from different classes, Jack and Rose played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.

Again, Kate Winslet is one of my favorite actresses because not only is she amazingly talented, she holds up a standard of a real woman's appearance, not a anorexic twig. Her portrayl of Rose DeWitt Bukater being forced into a loveless marriage to save her destitute family masquerading that they still have money. Her emotional highs and lows throughout are amazing.

Her fiance, Cal Hockley was played by Billy Zane as one of my favorite uptight villains. His nose is in the stratosphere and he sneers down at everyone below his class, especially the threat to his love life, Jack. I particularly love the scene where he has an opportunity to help Jack and ruthlessly chooses not to, but the magnitude of that decision still brings tears to his eyes.

And of course, Jack Dawson played by Leonardo DiCaprio captured the attention of all females age 13 and up for several years while he wisely went into his shell until his work could again be judged without hormones getting in the way. His character of Jack is instantly likable, charismatic, moving, and if you don't feel anything for his humanity by the end of the movie and want to save him, your high level of testosterone is probably impeding your judgment. It has been 13 years since this movie came out so it's much easier to look at it with a clear frame of mind unclouded by gooey-eyes or jealousy.

I love the supporting actors: Bernard Hill as Captain Edward James Smith (years before Theoden in Lord of the Rings), Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews, Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, Frances Fisher as Rose's Mother, Ruth, and Jonathan Hyde as Bruce Ismay. All have a measure of dignity and grace (except Ismay of course) as they deal with the emergency on board and I really feel like they bring those historic people to life in a way that garners empathy from the audience.

The amazing images of the boat, the scale, the effects all take you completely into the movie, the grandeur and the danger. The music is beautiful although I could do without Celine Dion's song these days. If you haven't seen this movie, you live under a rock but it really is an amazing story based on historic events. Many of the events in this movie ACTUALLY happened, just not to fictional characters Jack and Rose. It is a blockbuster, one of the biggest movies of that decade, one of the biggest movies ever really and it propelled all careers of those involved to new heights.

DVD Extras:

After holding out on us for many years, this super deluxe special edition showing all the behind-the-scenes goodies was finally released. This edition has commentary from cast and crew including James Cameron and Kate Winslet (Sorry, no Leonardo DiCaprio). There is also a track of historical commentary commenting on the time period, appearance of the boat, and events that occurred as the movie progresses. If you're a history buff at all and interested in hearing more about the boat, it is definitely worth a listen. My favorite is that someone was actually scolded for breaking property on the Titanic while it was sinking. In this edition, the sound has been upgraded, the colors are richer, and the picture was anamophically enhanced for widescreen televisions. The only downside is that the movie is split into two discs so you have to get up and change it if you don't have a multi-disc player.

There are over 45 minutes of never-before-seen deleted scenes with optional commentary. One includes the nearby ship California's reaction to the Titanic distress call. The alternate ending, ""Brock's Epiphany"" thankfully was not used. Jack does not live, it's just really lame. Celine Dion's music video for ""My Heart Will Go On"" is included. There are just hundreds and hundreds of on-set photos, personal photos from the cinematographer, storyboard sketches, and technical drawings. There are many featurettes on how certain effects were achieved and what portions of the set were built to scale and which were modeled. A great deal had to be constructed rather than rented since it was going to be destroyed. The construction timplapse is particularly spectacular. The deep dive presentation in full is humbling as you get to see Titanic at the bottom of the sea minus Brock's rambling. The ""Breaking New Ground"" TV special does a good overview of the making of the film in a shorter time span, but if you want to see every detail, you probably can with this edition because all the bells and whistles are there...minus Leo.",1265328000,4,4976,4.763341067285383

129019,5,0792151712,"First of all...........THE SHIP, it gets 5 stars all by itself because the reproduction was excellent, Cameron paid great attention to detail and when he needed to use miniatures, his detail was even more magnificent, the only shame of it all is that the ship was not used in whole because it would've been quite a thrill to walk the decks of this set piece.
Second.................THE SINKING, Cameron claims the sinking was as accurate as he could get it based on all the information he could gather from the remaining survivors, experts, books, etc and from everything I have read and then went and saw the movie 5 times in the theater and about 22 times on video, I'd say it's pretty darn accurate...but the thing that punched me in the gut the very first time I saw it was the agony of the people fighting for survival as the ship was in it's final minutes, I'm a very emotional person with stuff like this and alot of it got to me, including AFTER the ship went down when the mother and child were floating dead in the water.....Yikes!
Third..................THE PLOT, I wasn't crazy about the cheesy plotline but without the cheesy plotline interwoven into the story of the sinking, there would be no movie I suppose, even though they could have done an ""A Night To Remember"" type storyline where more attention was paid to the ship and less was paid to the characters and they could've got away with it but of course then it may not have won 11 academy Awards.  I didn't care for DiCaprio, Had never heard of Winslet (but thanks to one scene, I KNOW ALL ABOUT HER NOW!!), it was just too gushy for me but I somehow muddled through it.
Lastly.................BLU-RAY TREATMENT, This movie, of all movies, deserves to get the Blu-Ray treatment, I think it will look absolutely terrific and I for one will definitely purchase it when it comes out...someday!",1262995200,,1862,4.642424242424243

129047,5,0792151712,"""Titanic"" has gone on to become a blockbuster movie, heavily regarded as the greatest film ever made. Released on December 19th, 1997, ""Titanic"" became the movie everyone wanted see, eventually hitting #1 at North American theatres for 15 consecutive weeks, a record still not broken to this day. The film would eventually gross over 1.8 billion dollars worldwide becoming the biggest money-making film. Nominated for 14 Academy Awards (tying with ""All About Eve"") and winning 11 including Best Picture and Best Director for Canadian born James Cameron, ""Titanic"" is also known for the beautiful theme song ""My Heart Will Go On"" performed by Celine Dion that won four Grammys. Cameron, who also wrote the screenplay, documents how the ill-fated ship struck an iceberg on the early morning hours of April 15th, 1912 off the coast of Newfoundland, while telling the fictitious story of Jack and Rose, star-crossed lovers who meet on ""Titanic"", fall in love, and who enter the hearts of millions of movie goers.

129048,5,0792151712,"To be honest, this is more critique than review, so if you're thinking of buying the DVD having yet to see the movie, I suggest you skip this and go straight to the next review or the ADD to BASKET button, which if you do you won't regret. But let's face it, just about everyone's seen this movie and if you have but are still considering purchasing the DVD as a gift or to have as a permanent copy, then you may safely read on because there's no intention here to put you off. On the contrary, I wish to extol the movie's virtues having had what could best be described as a Saul to Damascus conversion regarding a movie curmudgeons such as my x-self seemed to just love to hate.

A great spectacle hampered by a poor script. That appears to be the general feeling about Titanic, and one I used to harbor myself, but nothing could be wider off the truth, now, in my opinion. This script is as highly polished as the floor Cal Hockley slid upon as he chased Rose and Jack through the sinking ship. Those who rate the script poorly are, for one thing, likely confusing script with dialogue and for another, finding fault where there is so little. They're also forgetting, else not aware to begin with, that the characters' spoken lines are the lesser part of the script. They should realise that every picture, sound, mood, every jaw-dropping scene, every moment of joy, love, terror, every smile, frown, wince, lip-waver, and expression of fear on the characters' faces, has been written into the script. Then there's the characterisations, plot, pace, action, backdrops and coincidences, which are all carefully managed, weighted and envisaged by the scriptwriter. And they must all mesh with each other as they must with the dialogue. So this is in defense of a great script and that part of it subject to the most undue criticism, the perfectly formed love story.

When Rose deWitt Bukater sailed under the statue of liberty into New York harbor at the end of her voyage, it was lashing with rain. And significantly, though you'd be forgiven for missing this, Rose wasn't seeking shelter from the rain. Does anyone think the rain wasn't part of the script or that rain wasn't necessary to the story? It seems a trivial detail but to the scriptwriter the rain in the scene is everything. I'd go further and say the movie doesn't work without it. Rain cleanses. It reflects a change of mood. In terms of script dynamics alone, the rain marks the passing of time, and not just the sailing time of the rescue ship, Carpathia, from the disaster zone to New York, but also the eighty-four years separating the stories of young and old Rose. Rain is never just rain. It always has a function in a script. It's a dramatic device specifically chosen and precisely timed by the writer. Whether historically it rained or not as Carpathia docked is neither here nor there and matters not to the teller of this story. Here, more than anything, the rain symbolises a new beginning and the end to young Rose's story with the statue of liberty itself offering its own significance. The rain's also our cue to let Rose go, but without its cleansing, almost baptising effect, she cannot begin to make a new life for herself. Rose has to move on and we have to let her, as though we are steering the script with our expectations. Without the rain, Rose cannot become old Rose.

The script is near flawless, even given the almost cartoonish characterisations of Billy Zane's Cal Hockley and sidekick, David Warner's Lovejoy. But when I ask myself how such a man as Hockley, the spoiled, handsome and eligible heir to a major fortune would react to the provocation of his beautiful young fiance falling for the charms of some scruffy kid, I expect the answer would be pretty angrily. The dastardly villain might seem a cheap device, but for me it works exceptionally well in Titanic. Watch how long the character tries to maintain his composure and win Rose around - but his shallowness, cowardice and jealousy can't help but surface like scum in the end as he effectively sinks himself in Rose's esteem. Simplistically drawn he might be, but Hockley falls just the right side of believable and with that equal propensity for charm and flying off the handle makes all the right moves for a classic villain...

129050,3,0792151712,"Take any cheesy love story worthy of Mills and Boon. Set it against one of the worst shipping disasters of modern times, being sure to pad the story out so the film overruns by at least two hours. Add in some ""ground breaking"" special effects, and you have yourself an Oscar-winning epic, 1997-style.  Anachronisms abound. (Rose giving the ""finger"" - I half expected her to say ""kiss my ass!"") The ""class warfare"" angle is ridiculously overplayed, and just in case we *really* don't get it, no mention is made of the fact that the Titanic had classes of accommodation other than ""first"" and ""steerage"". Presumably the second class passengers spent the entire time below decks.  When the truth doesn't fit the class agenda, Cameron simply makes it up - witness the steerage class passengers locked below decks while the toffs boarded the lifeboats, and the officer who murders several passengers before turning a gun on himself (a shameful fiction which did not please the real fellow's living relatives; Cameron was forced to apologise).  ""Titanic"" was condemned in some sections of the English press as an ""anti-English"" film. In truth, it's simply a lazy movie which exploits Hollywood clichs (hence the English-accented villains) and twists the truth to suit its own prejudices.  In summary, ""Titanic"" is a dull, uninspired film which does the Titanic story a disservice. If this is the template that Cameron is using, I sincerely hope he doesn't have a ""9/11"" movie in the pipeline. ""Titanic"" could scarcely have been less credible if Cameron had filmed an all-out action adventure, with Arnie in the title role, and it would surely have been more entertaining!",1253059200,2,1665,5.021739130434782

Outstanding set design and effects, a wonderful musical score and and a timeless love story, are all used to retell the sinking of the Titanic. The historical points of film are surprisingly accurate and it inspired me to read up on other historical facts the movie couldn't get into.
This movie holds up well and is one of my all time favorite films. Class and gender warfare, are interesting backdrops to the love story. For a story you essentially already know whats coming, this film really kept you on the edge of your seat.
The extras on this collector's edition are well worth getting, with among other features, an additional 45 minutes of deleted scenes. Many of the deletions are simply the extra footage of shortened scenes that did make the movie, and frankly much of the extra scenes could have been left in the movie. However the film was already long by most standards, and timing and pacing reasons dictated most of the cuts. One 3 minute gun chase scene was properly deleted in its entirety. The somewhat alternate ending was fun to see, but the theatrical version was clearly the right choice.

129082,3,0792151712,"I've seen Titanic several times and I keep coming back to the same conclusion: other than Kate Winslet's spot-on treatment, the rest of this film suffers from miscasting and wooden performances that are the cornerstones of a James Cameron film.  It works passably in action flicks like Terminator, but when applied to an 'ageless love story"" that garnered Oscar hardware in abundance, it suspends disbelief and borders at times on camp.

The biggest miss for me was the casting of Leonardo diCaprio in the lead male role.  Unless you are a twelve-year-old girl, he possesses none of the verve, charisma, or intrigue one would have wanted from the role of Jack.  I kept wishing the part had found its way to a Johnny Depp or Ewan McGregor.  It pushed the bounds of reason to believe that Winslet's character would have been taken with a lightweight like DiCaprio's Jack, who looked plucked from a John Hughes movie.  This isn't a knock against Cameron or diCaprio--I've liked their work in many other venues like Terminator and The Aviator--but here it just felt sophomoric and manipulative.

The supporting characters are cardboard cutouts; no one does or says anything other than what you might expect. Other than diCaprio, that feels like more a function of script than of acting.  Billy Zane poses, broods, and preens--not that he was given a lot to work with. The actress Gloria Stuart playing the old version of Winslet's character I'm sure was a very nice lady, but not for a single second did I believe that she was an older version of Rose.  She appeared to lose her sophistication and zeal for life about the same time she lost her English accent. Kathy Bates makes a nice performance in a throwaway role as the Unsinkable Molly Brown.

The boat looks luminous; the special effects are impeccable.  Watch any ""inside the set"" documentary and you realize the care and effort that Cameron took to replicate the vessel and the sinking.  But once you get past that, you are left with a story that suspends belief and borders on cheesy camp.  I felt like a lone voice in that capacity when the movie first came out but over time (perhaps with maturity?) others have started seeing this, too.

The film is definitely worth watching for the cinematography alone, and has several memorable moments, but fifty years from now will it attain high standing among the list of Oscar winners?  More likely it will be wear as a big budget, glitzy vehicle that plays like an updated Poseidon Adventure.

Like many viewers, I think the Rose/Jack romance dialogue is weak (at times cringingly so), as well as their chase and escapes from both man and water which were overdone. I was amused in the theater when most others were watching with bated breath their many, many, many confrontations with the water coming into the ship.  It's as though James Cameron thought of every possible situation to escalate drama and used them all in exhausting succession instead of judiciously choosing and timing the most effective.

The story of the ship, the sinking and often accurate portrayal of the historic people involved with the ship, as well as the caliber of the acting, make the film outstanding.  The Rose story serves to paint mostly historic portraits well, and I love the older Rose in the framing scenes. Also outstanding are the special effects that make me feel as though I was there observing.

The trick I've used to make the movie a five rating is to watch it all through first, then re-watch with the fast forward button in hand.  I only need to see Brock Lovett's disappointing diamond search, Jack's poker game, his too long ""I'm the king of the world"" scene, the spitting scene, the boiler rooms, and many of Jack and Rose's on board water escapes once. By fast-forwarding through these and a few other parts, I'm able to focus on the majesty of the ship, the sometimes-accurate (but willing suspension of disbelief believable) historic persons, and the tragedy; I'm enthralled with my second edited viewing.

The teary part of the film to me are the photographs next to the bed of the old Rose's post Titanic adventures and freedom. It's there that I feel the strength of the romance.  Rose's memory of Jack and his encouragement to her to live life to the fullest that she that she honors and embraces make the sometimes goofy shipboard romance, in hindsight, beautiful.",1246838400,,2144,4.693333333333333

129122,3,0792151712,"Like many people, I thought the love story between Rose and Jack was crass, silly, poorly written, and unrealistic (the First and Third Class passengers never mingled, and class consciousness was so ingrained at the time that a real-life Jack probably would have had serious doubts that any romance with a rich girl would succeed). Perhaps the nadir of the film is when they engage in a spitting match over the deck of the ship! This vulgarity would have been unheard of in a well-bred girl of the 1900s, no matter how the filmmakers would like to believe that a Rose of the early 20th century would behave like a 1990s spoiled teenager popping bubble gum at a shopping mall. In addition, poor Cal is treated like a villain, even though he gives her the Heart of the Ocean, expects only that she acts like a lady, and treats him with respect. We are asked to identify with Rose, however, as if bad manners and the freedom to spit over a deck is admirable. These are 1990s values, not the 1900s.

So why is such a film with glaring inaccuracies so successful and sometimes poignant? The answer lies in the way Cameron strangely mixes in moments of genuine poignancy, loss, and respect for the Titanic dead. Unlike other films, he shows real respect for old people and shows everyone the beautiful young woman lurking beneath an aged crone's face. I cannot remember any other film in which the presumably youth-obsessed audience is asked to remember that elderly Rose Dawson was once a naked, beautiful Kate Winslet. And the ship is treated the same way - he starts the film showing a decayed, ugly, broken down ship and flips back to reveal how beautiful the Titanic was in her youth. Cameron's willingness to capture what it really feels to lose someone through death or through age is what makes the film powerful. Unlike other Hollywood ""feel-good"" films, Titanic doesn't stint on the tragedy and finds beauty and meaning in death and even ugliness. Even the Jack character shows an appreciation for beauty in ugly things - he draws pictures of an old lady wearing a moth-eaten coat, waiting for her love to show up, and a one-legged prostitute. The fact that the characters value life, no matter how ugly, and understand how precious life is, makes this film more memorable and more powerful.

Some people think the special effects made this movie, but I think it was only part of why it was so successful. It used special effects to capture the loss of a great tragedy, and did this so well people were willing to overlook the more stupider aspects of the screenway.'I know  I did!",1241049600,7,2585,4.6644736842105265
129123,4,0792151712,"I recently bought the 3-disc version of the movie, after reading here that it was a better value.

Well, it's true. The extras were great! The entire script, tons of photo galleries, and three commentaries made it worth going out of my way to find this version. Not to mention the  ""ships"" that appear on screen to lead you to behind the scenes footage. The crews' video is unexpectedly funny.

A few complaints to consider though:
*There are two discs (packed with extras) to the film itself, so expect to have to change to disc two to finish the movie. A little disruptive if you get very involved in the plot line.
*Watching the deleted scenes definitely adds a new level to the film, but there is no way to integrate them into play time. You have to watch them alone, or not at all--they're stranded on disc three.
*I would have loved to have seen a documentary on here. While the Fox special is featured, it would have been nice to seen something from History Channel or Discovery to add a little weight, and not just Fox sponsored material.

This is a great way to see the film if you're like me, and kept watching it for years wondering what the fuss was about. The added extras give new dimension to the movie, and make it the version to own.",1238025600,4,1250,4.3982683982683985

129128,3,0792151712,"I felt this movie had a lot of good points, and equally a number of bad ones. I'll start off with the good. I thought that the special effects were fantastic, particularly the scenes where the ship was sinking. I thought that they got the layout of the ship very accurate, and you could really sense the 'newness', freshness and splendor of this ship on its maiden voyage. It certainly had a feel of 1912 about it.

Now the bad points. I felt the love story of Jack and Rose was awful, and highly improbable, particularly for the times. Their dialogue is really poor, and almost cringeworthy at times! The way they act, and talk, just does not ring true for 1912. Also, the mystery ship seen in the distance by officers and passengers, during the sinking, widely believed to be a tramp steamer, called the 'Californian', does not rate a mention in the movie. This is an important part of the 'Titanic' story, that has been omitted.

I felt this movie was to a certain extent a wasted opportunity. A Night To Remember, is for me, still the definitive 'Titanic' movie.",1236556800,3,1066,4.546875

129177,4,0792151712,"I recommend buying this edition instead of the 10th anniversary edition.  There are a number of extras such as several commentaries by the director James Cammeron, cast and crew and noted historians.

James Cammeron did a wonderful job of breaking new ground, such as the ship breaking in half, which has never been seen before.  I feel that he cast the roles of officers Charles Lightoller and Harole Lowe perfectly.  The two actors Jonathan Phillips (Lightoller) and Ioan Griffudd (Lowe) were what I pictured them to be based on everything I read about them and pictures I saw of them.

The one negative part of this movie which I feel should be deleted was the suicide of 1st officer Murdock.  I have read a number a books on Titanic and there is no evidence or documentation that this happened.  It is an injustice to the family of William Murdock.

I felt that too much time was devoted to the Jack and Rose story.  Don't get me wrong, I thought the love story added entertainment to the movie, but I felt that more time should have been focused on the roles of Lightoller and Lowe and their roles in the tragic events.

The role of Molly Brown should have been bigger.  Few Titanic movies have ever portrayed her accurately.  She was a real heroine that night.  If anyone comes to Denver Colorado, be sure to take a tour through the Molly Brown House.  I make it a point to visit at least once a year since I live 7 blocks away.

The soundtrack was also great, especially the song ""My heart Will Go On"".  I feel that this song belongs to Lightoller and Lowe for their bravery.  Their hearts really did go on.",1230768000,2,1614,4.472602739726027

129213,5,0792151712,"It's hard to believe it's been 10 years since this movie came out. Moving right along, what makes this movie so interesting is that while there are fictional elements, they are mixed with historical elements as well. (So, to some extent, we are permitted to accept the fictional elements such as the Calvin, Rose, jack soap opera as real.) It is interesting how we are told the story from the 100 year old survivor Rose. So, obviously, we know that Rose will somehow survive. But that doesn't mean that Rose won't lose someone she loves. The scenery and outfits are beautiful. And although the movie is over 3 hours long, somehow, it never seems to drag. The story seems to move at a realistic pace (rather than everything being crammed to fit into a 2 hour slot). While Rose and Jack are the stars, other characters make good use of their screen time. (The unsinkable Molly Brown who comes into money, but never sacrificed herself or her moral values, and kept her redneckish charm, and also the virtuous and honorable Thomas Andrews to name 2.)

While Calvin is not seen in a favorable light often, his character is at least a tad grayer that we would probably like to admit.(I actually found Rose's mother to be more repulsive.) Basically, Rose's mother (now broke) wants Calvin to marry Rose to reestablish themselves financially. Calvin, despite his faults is willing to do so. In all honesty, Calvin starts off no worse than anyone else in his position would probably be. Rose then begins her relationship involved with Jack, and Calvin gets abusive to the point where he nearly kills her. I'm not trying to defend his abuse of Rose, or for that matter firing several gunshots in a rage. But if we wish to throw a small tad of understanding on the table (at least before he gets abusive), Rose's mother was asking Calvin to reestablish themselves financially. And then Rose runs around with Jack. A whiter Calvin may have decided that he shouldn't waste anymore time here.

Moving on, there is some generous time of just getting to know everyone, but this also provides a creepy suspense. (Obviously, we already know the ship is going to sink.) At about the 1/2 way point, a conversation between Rose and Thomas Andrews reminds us that there are only enough life boats for 1/2 the passengers. We can also see that Thomas Andrews wanted enough for everyone, but 'certain powers' didn't take his concerns seriously.

There are some romantic moments between Jack and Rose, and then the Titanic crashes. (While some people would pick and find someone to blame, the movie seems to not point the blame at any one party. Not even 100 % towards Mr. Ismay who came out splattered with mud the most.) In the event we forgot the conversation between Rose and Mr. Andrews, Thomas faces Rose again and reminds us.

One phenomenal thing about this movie is that it shows us the true horror of people dying. (Unlike many movies that glorify people getting killed.) Interestingly, the ship sinks for an actual hour or so. This is great in that we get to see the panic, tragedy, and horror of the crew knowing that less than 1/2 are going to survive. Rose finds herself not only in this situation, but in the climax in her situation between her mother and Calvin. (There is a predictable, but still shaking moment when Rose says: ""Goodbye mother,"" which infers that they will probably never see each other again.)

Moving on, we are permitted sympathy for even characters we never met as they face their probable death . Their different ways of facing it are interesting. (Story telling, playing music, simply waiting, or in one case, having a brandy.)

Most of you probably already know the personal tragedy Rose faces. But moving back to the present, it is interesting how the Bill Paxton character suddenly realizes that there is more to life than ourselves. Overall, it's a phenomenal romance (in a historical setting) that reminds us not only of the horror of people dying, but that there is more to life than our own existence.",1223251200,,4022,4.722222222222222
129214,5,0792151712,"I was one of the few who knew this was going to be good.
The hype before the film came out was mostly negative. Plagued by delays the film quickly became the most expensive film ever made. But I was steadfast on seeing it, because I liked all of James Cameron's films, and I was certain to go see this one regardless of what the story was.

And then the film came out and it was great. May not have been the best picture of the year, but it is one of the few films that have won best picture that weren't the best pictures of their year, that I believed earned the title because of the struggle the filmmakers went through to make this movie.

Now, watching and listening to James Cameron's commentary, ten years after the film's release, I like it even more, for he explains in this feature length commentary, how things he was doing in Titanic were revolutionary, but have now become the norm. The green screen compositing to transition from one sceen to the next, used ad-nausea in Speed Racer was pioneered in Titanic. The computer generated extensions of backgrounds and sets that were used in films such as Garden State was in the infancy stage when Cameron used it on this film. Cameron is big on research, and you can tell by the detail he goes into the story and each character that appears on the screen. His very insightful and thorough commentary and I strongly recommend it for anybody who wants to be a filmmaker.",1222128000,,1427,4.442748091603053

This movie allows people to see the true events which occurred on that cold night on April 15, 1912 and helps to remind everyone of the tragedy of the amazing ship Titanic.",1221436800,,606,4.371681415929204
129217,5,0792151712,"Everyone knows this film for being a multi-million-dollar epic as well as a definitive love story (with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet); less mentioned (but more of the film's actual concern) is its uplifting portrayal of a woman's liberation out of repression, set within a real historical time and setting used to create a symbolic fable.

The point is hammered home in its scene of the young Rose viewing a little girl folding her napkin on her lap (a girl she remembers in horror as herself) and its final scene of the elderly Rose happily drifting off with photos of her full life around her. The Jack in her life (even if fleeting) has given her wings. Looking at this being the main theme of the story, the film is not a tragedy but a triumph in a woman finding herself (through Jack) and living a full life without letting others dictate whom she will become.

On this level, even as its deceptive surface emphasizes its tragic love story, it's a masterpiece that Joseph Campbell would have venerated using a real-life tragic event to tell a positive, life-affirming story of a woman finding herself utilizing the iconography of Freudian dream symbolism.",1221004800,4,1166,4.796019900497512
129218,5,0792151712,"I admit... I've watched the film TITANIC three times in the theater and hunted city after city for the TITANIC soundtrack for that one Celine Dion song.

  Afterall, this movie was hyped as a mega blockbuster that would later become a winner of 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture.

  I also waited in line with almost a hundred other fans to get the VHS release but when the first DVD release came out,  I didn't buy it.

  I was a bit dismayed by the lack of special features and the fact that the film was divided into two discs.

  Knowing that popular DVD's tend to be re-released in different incarnations with a ""deluxe this"" or ""premium that"" , TITANIC has finally returned as a Special Collectior's Edition.

  The Special Collector's Edition does not disappoint as it is loaded with over 3 hours of special features.

  Included in this special version are cast and crew commentaries by director James Cameron, Kate Winslet, Gloria Stuart, Lewis Abernathy, Jon Landau and Rae Sanchini.  Historical commentary by Doon Lynch and Ken Marschall.

  To my disappointment, the movie again is split up into two discs  Thus you will need to get up from your seat to change the DVD when you get close to the two hour mark.

  But fortunately, DVD space is utiltized well  with the inclusion of branching technology, so when ever you want to know how certain scenes were made, you have an option to watch the behind-the-scenes featurettes while watching the movie.

  The DVD looks great and audiophiles should be pleased to learn that Dolby Digital 5.1 ES and also 6.1 DTS ES is available.

  Disc 2 includes the alternate ending titled ""Brock's Epiphany"" which is based on the original script.  Which I'm glad that Jim Cameron edited out of the final verison.  Also, included on this disc is the music video of Celine Dion's ""My Heart Will Go On"".  But I'm a bit surprised how dated the music video looks.

  On Disc 3, this disc features all the TITANIC goodies with 45 minutes of never-before-seen deleted scenes with optional commentary.  This was actually very interesting to watch and listen to why James Cameron removed those scenes.  Included also was the FOX special ""Breaking New Ground"", press kit featurettes, 1912 newsreel which was more of taking footage of the actors in costume and making it look like footage from 1912.

Construction timelapse, deep dive presentation, video matics, video effects breakdowns, still galleries and so much more.

  In closing, I admit that I was originally dismayed that the movie was split into two disc's but with the addition of the behind-the-scene brancing featurettes with the film,  I can understand why.

  James Cameron is no David O Selznick (the producer of Gone with the wind, for all you who don't know) and he sure dropped one sizzler of a turd with this abomination. The sad thing is that he cashed in on making a mockery of true historical events by putting them in the shadow of this idiotic tale.
  I suppose the actors did what they could with what they had to work with ( which wasn't much ), but the leads were most definitely miscast. The best character in this stinker was the iceberg, and thank God for it!!! It had a much more certain role than any of the so-called ""stars"" of this dreadful spectacle, and it did its job with much more style. It was with absolute pleasure that I watched Jack sink into oblivion. That's the one part of the movie that coulda been made longer, watching that clown perish.

Now people are going to argue this point with the ""The alternate ending is on the second disc!!"". Then what is the 3rd disc for? All of the special features should have been on one disc. The other featuretts really didn't astound me. They were short and rather boring. If the special edition wasn't so cheap I would have just gotten the regular DVD and probably would have been much better. On the other side of the spectrum, the movie itself is fantastic!

It has everything one would demand from a movie that won so many awards; wonderful period costumes, expert attention to detail and an absolutely magnificent soundtrack all framed beautifully on an ocean vessel befitting its name.

However what ultimately won over its devoted audience was the tender love story between Jack (Leonardo Di Capro) and Rosie (Kate Winslet). It follows a winning formula that's as old as time, handsome but poor young man wins the heart of a wealthy but stifled young woman by helping her discover her passion and see the world through the eyes of the common folk.

Yes it's a little over romanticized and if not for the epic sinking sequence at the end of the film this might have fallen into the category of nothing more than a ""chick flick"" but I think there's enough here to keep the male viewers focused for the most part.

Not only is the film itself massive but the history the film is based on involves the most infamous ship wreck in history. James Cameron defenitley shows his prowess as a director with this film the camera moves and the angles he uses during the sinking are unconventional and in my opinion he deserved the oscar that he got for the film.

The whole love story lacks credibility, characters are schematically terribly bad or awfully nice and the movie sinks down well before the ship does.

Only worth watching if you want to appreciate the catalogue of amazing special effects without caring at all about the plot and amazing (may be even terrifying) when thinking about how powerfully marketing can influence audiences (including myself... I went to see it)

- 45 min. of deleted scenes (including an alternate ending!)
- A photo gallery w/hundreds of pics

- The aforementioned theatrical trailer

129325,3,0792151712,"I was probably one of the last people to actually see ""Titanic."" Just one of those flicks my friends had all seen before me. After seeing it, I understood all the hoopla, so I won't go into the redundant details. However after seeing it several times- indeed, umpteen times (I bought the video)- everything about this movie grew hammier, more predictable, and even anachranistic in certain ways- attitudes and acting. This movie gives you all you pay for. But after all is said and done, you have a lot of 21st century attitude blended in with early 20th century characters and their mindsets. That setting works in giving you who you sympathize with and who you loathe, especially when it comes to crunch time, and towards that end this movie works well. But there's a lot about this movie that is very over rated, especially most of all Gloria Stuart's performance. Billy Zane gives us an over the top role as Rose's fiance. His performance is cliched, but effective in who you sympathize with. And there are several other roles like that. So to be fair, the movie works. But is it the ""second coming"" as it was purported to be when it came out? Hardly. Great movies withstand the test of time, mega-viewings. This one doesn't fall into that category. It's a beautifully made film that tells a nice story. But this movie in no way belongs up there with the ""Godfathers"" and ""Citizen Kanes"" of the world, nor do the performances. It's funny how in the immediacy of things some movies get by the test of common sense and unfettered judgement. Awards get handed to movies like that, waaay too often. Best picture? Shows why the Oscars have long lost their significance (am I the only one who feels that those who vote on the Oscars should at the very LEAST go and actually SEE the movies!). The fact that this soundtrack sold so many copies shows how people lost their senses while riding the bandwagon. ""Near, far, wherever you are??"" Those lyrics won an award. This movie is good. In several respects, it's incredible. The recreation that is pulled off is worthy of praise, as is most of the cinematography. But that's where the hindsight praise ends. That was like the shine on the new car you were looking at. Once that sheen wore away, the true colors were revealed.

Disaster movies have been popular for years. Take many big name (and not so big name) celebrities, place them in a dangerous setting, add incredible special effects, then watch them survive (or die trying).

There were disaster films set in airplanes (""Airport"" and its many sequels) capsizing ships (""The Poseidon Adventure,"") burning buildings (""Towering Inferno,"") cities destroyed by things from outer space (""Meteor,"" ""Fire in the sky,"") as wells as floods, fires, earthquakes and all kinds of other celluloid catastrophes.

So when I first heard about Titanic, I was anticipating another disaster film. One with a very, very large budget, but still a disaster film. The Poseidon Adventure part II, perhaps.

Oh, my, was I wrong. And so was everyone else.

This film affects each one who sees it in a unique and personal way, and after three viewing I feel I must share my impressions. Simply put, you MUST see this film. You must experience one of the grander offerings Hollywood has given us while it's on the big screen. You must experience this story for yourself.

Women who see Titanic are sobbing at the end. Big, burly guys leave red-eyed, sniffling. You can't help it. Often we go to the movies and our minds wander, or we leave to go the bathroom or buy more popcorn. Not this time. With this movie, no one leaves. People lean forward in their chairs watching the drama unfold. They're spellbound.

For three and a half hours you leave the theater and go back to that terrible night of April 15, 1912. You see this film and you think, ""this is what movie making is supposed to be about."" Epic. Larger than life. Pure escapism. And much more.

Why is this film such a success? Why are people seeing it again and again? Why the Golden Globe awards and a sure-fire Oscar night sweep?

Well, there are many reasons, and the first is realism. History, by and large, can be a pretty dry subject. There are facts, figures and events, but often there's no personal connection. The words, ""Titanic hit an iceberg and 1500 people died when it sank,"" are just words. Sure, it must have been very catastrophic, but we never met any of those people. That was 85 years ago. It doesn't convey any sense of tragedy.

Where Titanic succeeds first -- and it does so on many levels -- is that its realism is so striking that you feel as though one of the passengers was filming the entire event with a camcorder. Every detail (costumes, props, mannerisms, dress, sets, china patterns, etc.) is so perfectly recreated that very quickly you forget you're watching a movie. The illusion is so perfect that you never once think of what you're seeing as a ""re-creation."" The verisimilitude is tangible.

As such, you cringe as people die. You feel the panic as people fight for a slot on one of the few remaining lifeboats. As the water rises and crashes through staterooms and corridors, your pulse quickens. You shudder at the lifeless bodies bobbing in the frigid Atlantic. You almost feel the cold. You watch an ""unsinkable"" ship be consumed by the unforgiving sea.

""But this ship can't sink!"" Ismay cries.

And Titanic's builder, Andrews, replies, ""She is made of iron, sir. I assure you, she can. And she will. It is a mathematical certainty."" You know the ship is doomed. And you are a witness to its sinking.

This is no fictitious ship or skyscraper, but a very real ocean liner whose actual twisted wreckage on the floor of the Atlantic is seamlessly matched with the recreations of those long ago days.

You see the history, and you learn. You learn what a beautiful ship Titanic was, how strong, how fast. A ship of dreams. You learn why the ship sank, and how. You learn that the band played on deck until the ship sank, and that the lights stayed on almost until the same time. That the ship broke in half after lifting its stern into the air. You learn how human arrogance led to the disaster. You might have known some of these things before, but now they seem more real. Almost like you were really there.

But what makes the film such a true success is the love story. Rose DeWitt Bukater, an upper-class American suffocating under the strict expectations of high society, and Jack Dawson, a free-spirited poor boy, never really sailed aboard Titanic, but they -- and the characters around them -- are so well-written and acted that you believe they might have. They could have. For three and a half hours, they really did.

No one in this film is a cartoon stereotype. Even Rose's icy mother, who on the outside appears to be just a stuffy, aloof high-society woman, is revealed to be on the verge of poverty, desperately trying to marry Rose into wealth. ""We're women,"" she laments sadly. ""Our choices are few."" The dramatic class war between first class and steerage is complex and vivid. First class socializes in stuffy formal tea, cigar and dinner parties. They're dull and bored. Below decks, the ""have nots"" have rowdy, wild step dancing parties filled with music, singing, laughter, arm-wrestling and much drinking. They have nothing, yet they need nothing -- absolute joy permeates the air. Attending such a party, Rose cuts loose and has a wonderful time. ""Money can't buy happiness"" never seemed more obvious.

As disaster strikes and the ""haves"" wonder if the lifeboats will be loaded by class, the ""have nots"" merely fight for their right to be rescued as well. And for many of the lower class, there is a quiet dignity as they accept the inevitable (a mother tucking her children in bed as others scramble to escape), while the rich use any means to escape the doomed ship (Cal using someone else's child as a ticket onto the ""women and children only"" lifeboat).

Titanic is filled with powerful scenes. Rose's wordless observation of a little girl being trained in the proper way to sit up straight at a table and fold a napkin -- the look on Rose's face conveys her rejection for that code of conduct and way of life.

A father consoles his sobbing children and wife as they board a life boat, ""Don't cry... It's OK, they have another boat for the daddies."" But the look between husband and wife says it all: I'll never see you again.

In another scene, you marvel at the kind way ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown fondly looks after Jack and lends him a tuxedo. Throughout the film, you believe that 101 old Rose holds a love for Jack that has withstood 84 years. In a tasteful and non-explicit scene, as Rose and Jack make love for the first time, you feel the passion they share, and you believe they are really in love.

Despite the tragedy, the film is also surprisingly filled with many scenes that make you smile or are very humorous. The amusing way Jack -- clearly a fish out of water -- attempts to emulate the walk and gestures of the upper class is very funny and endearing. Jack teaching Rose to spit -- something she admits she never learned in finishing school -- shows the different worlds they come from. And in the memorable scene where Jack sketches Rose in the nude, Rose teases him: ""I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artist. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing."" ""He does landscapes,"" Jack replies.

James Horner's soundtrack is haunting and beautiful, and as the credits roll and Celine Dion's ""My heart will go on"" begins to play, you'll just be staring at the screen, amazed at how perfect a movie-going experience can be. ""Love can touch us one time / and last for a lifetime.""

When you do, then you'll understand.",1198108800,3,7647,4.7670196671709535

129342,4,0792151712,"One of the most epic and monumental productions ever attempted, Titanic soared to the top of the box office charts in 1997. Winning 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture, this grandiose film often takes a lot of heat for catering too much to female crowds, a.k.a. the ""chick flick"". However, the historical tale of the doomed monstrosity of the sea packs quite a bit of action, amazing special effects, an excellent score and lavish designs that can appeal to everyone.

Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) and his crew of deep-sea treasure hunters investigate the ruins of one of the most famous wreckage sites: the final resting place of the Titanic. When they discover a drawing of a beautiful young woman (Kate Winslet) wearing the ""Heart of the Ocean"" diamond, the jewel they've been hunting for, they announce it on the news. Rose, now a 101 year old lady comes forward to claim ownership of the drawing. Fascinated by the thought of uncovering the secrets of the diamond and details about the fateful night of the legendary ship, the crew patiently listens as Rose tells them about her adventure and romance with Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) aboard the unsinkable Titanic.

What begins as little more than a treasure hunt quickly turns into a colossal romance on the Atlantic between two unlikely lovers. Their love is consubstantial to many on-screen romances, considering that the boy is poor and the girl is rich. The snobbish mother doesn't want the two to be together, and would rather she marry the wealthy high-class gentlemen Cal Hockley, played by Billy Zane. Zane's character is also quite formulaic, with his constant deplorable acts of pride, hotheadedness and his persistence in underhanded deeds. Kathy Bates plays Molly Brown, the stereotypical kindly older lady who helps Jack fit in so that he can woo Rose. Even Jack and Rose are moderately generic - the nave young girl who thinks only of ending her life as an escape from her lack of decision-making power, and Jack as the street-smart, carefree, live by the moment scoundrel. The love story is essentially a fairy tale, complete with every character you'd expect to see in such a fantasy.

The acting in the film often falters between impressive and horrid, especially as the screenplay reflects obnoxiously insincere comments and jests. With the irony of mentioning Picasso as a hack, not even being recognized by his first name, or Freud as a passenger on the ship, and several hints as to the absence of light and binoculars with which they might have spotted the iceberg, the dialogue is often unpersuasive. Monotone and lethargic at times, Kate Winslet delivers many of her early lines with such noticeable lackluster amateurishness that it seems ludicrous for her to have been nominated for any awards at all. Leonardo DiCaprio is only slightly more authentic, although in all fairness the dialogue feels so modernized and petty that perhaps the actors didn't have much to work with. The captain (Bernard Hill) and the steerage band convey more convincing emotion with little more than glances and stares.

For all of its glamour and pizzazz, Titanic is just simply too unnecessarily long. With a running time of over three hours, it seems hardly important to include so much about the older Rose as she narrates the story. If the film had covered only the events of the Titanic during its short journey, not only would the pacing have been better, but the story would have been more involving. Each time the camera cuts back to the old Rose it violently yanks the audience out of the moment and away from the characters they actually care about.

What Cameron does still demonstrate admirably is his handling of suspense, and he masterfully shows chaos and panic as the ship begins to sink. Seizure-inducing flashing lights, screaming children and mob mentality violence are all portrayed with great care, and when the Titanic begins to capsize, it is believably unnerving. Great music, seamless special effects and contrasting characters add to the thrills - it's just a shame it takes so long to get to that point.

129344,5,0792151712,"The main merits of this well known tragic story resides on the fact James Cameron supported himself around four fundamental pillars; a solid and involving script, a perfect cast, an admirable soundtrack and  overwhelming stages, carefully and zealously showed, to bring us back a true kaleidoscope of encountered emotions. Of course the last ace of this brilliant filmmaker was to surprise us with the last words of a real survivor of that fatidic tragedy.

The film will be remembered for countless reasons, but mostly because the apparently forgotten, overlooked old fashion style about a love story that remits us to Romeo and Juliet at first glance, but then there is a tribute for Gone with the wind and specially Casablanca, powerful love stories that have as common denominator the tragic fact of being a project of life of brief duration.

On the other hand, the multiple emotive layers permeate the mind of the viewer, since the most sentimental sequences, the nave humor, refined splendor of Victorian echoes and the last minutes of chilling realism in which the death smiles trying to tell this couple: ""You have enjoyed the best the life can give you, you had all the time of the world, apart of the golden statement of Di Caprio ""I'm the king of world"" but now is my turn because my time has come.""

It shows as well how opposites attract like Jack & Rose.

129410,5,0792151712,"so many great reviews that to add the usual would bore all who bother w/ this site .  So I'll try a different approach :

# (1)  After reading so many reviews even by Amazon,  nowhere does anyone give Gloria Stuart her due as playing the elder version of Rose . First I'll remind all,  not about some unknown movie she may have played in BUT, does anyone recall or scary movie buffs own a little movie which is a Classic  now too,  titled "" The Invisible Man "" ?

 Gloria Stuart was a beauty back in 1934 playing the lead opposite Claude Rains ( invisible man )  . How many actresses can say their careers lasted so long ?  She did a helluva job here and believable as well . If you enjoy a good horror /scary ?  movie then  "" The Invisible Man ""  ought be in your collection too  , especially if you realize the that they had pretty good special effects back in that day ...think about it ...after you see it .  I, as well as  many folks have seen other versions of  "" Titanic ""  and was sketical about it's re-make once more . Usually a disaster of proportions such as a "" Titanic "" sinking !  But was SOOO wrong ! I love it !

I own both versions of this 1997 Titanic movie and some true books on it as I am interested in the truth as well about that devastating voyage and the  rich & well known people aboard her .

I am happy to say that I was lucky enought to visit the exhibit here in Phila. when it made it's tour and own many reproduction ( of course ) plates, etc. of that white star line ( Titanic ) , in fact I went back a second time.  There's nothing like seeing some of the artifacts that people who sailed that voyage actually owned.  They even had under heavy plexi-glass a piece of her Hull which you could place your hand inside and touch .
If you ever get the chance ...don miss that opportunity ...you'll be forever changed in how you feel about that ship and the tragedy of that night & those people on board .

Anyway, when the 10 year anniversary comes  four DVD comes out in Nov. 2007  , I shall purchase that as well .  No, I don't own many DVD's just classics of which this one  can be counted .

129415,5,0792151712,"I recall feeling so strongly positive towards only two other films in my life, after seeing them initially, and those moments were after seeing ""Apocalypse Now"" back in 1980 and ""Close Encounters"" back in 1977. ""Titanic"" became the third and like the previous two, it has remained a definite top ten for me at the very least.  While I did not care for the ""Redux"" version of Apocalypse Now, or the various versions of CE3K, DVD's for purchase which contain all the good parts of both, are available and this particular Titanic DVD adds TONS of extra goodies, making it a must buy for any fan or even semi-fan of the film.  And at a great Amazon price.  In fact, I did buy this DVD and sent it off as a gift to my sister, who loves the movie as much as me.

For all of its hype, awards, and budget (over $200 million), in many ways, this is a very ""personal"" film from director James Cameron (Terminator 2, The Abyss, Aliens, etc.), and never do the eye-popping special effects (of which there are plenty) get in the way of the very special adventure and exquisite and deep ""love story"" being told. That utterly and unashamedly romantic aspect, despite what some may think of such a blockbuster ""disaster"" movie, is at the heart of ""Titanic,"" and it is as powerful, convincing, and passionate, as the actual FX representation of the sinking of the ship, which only begins halfway through the movie itself.  Both halves however, stand on their own, and neither is less compelling and involving for the viewer. Add the two together, and what you've basically got is over three hours of absolutely spellbinding entertainment. To see ""Titanic"" in a way, is not so much like watching a movie, as it is to ""experience"" the best that cinema can possibly offer.

I will not attempt to summarize the plot here (ship sails, ship sinks, okay?), to list various technical aspects of the production, nor even dwell on the historical event this fictional film uses as a backdrop for the story it tells. Such information can be found elsewhere.  And what has been said since its release by fans, has not already been said?  My only purpose is to present my astonishment in this work, how like the original Apocalypse Now and Close Encounters (and a few other top ten films on my list including 2001, The Apartment, The Music Man, etc.), this is basically just a perfect Hollywood film, frame to frame, and scene to scene.  And to encourage anyone who loves this movie to buy this extra-packed DVD goodie.

Throughout, director Cameron's techniques seem flawless. It really does seem as if every piece of film, every scene, was carefully shot and edited in as exacting, interesting, accurate, involving, and exhilarating manner as possible. In addition, James Horner's brilliant music (in many different styles to boot) gives virtually every scene, regardless of the content, extra depth, feeling, and romance.  Not to mention the great title tune hit,  ""My Heart Will Go On"" by Celine Dion.  The theme of the song reverberates throughout the film and I'd strongly suggest buying the film's soundtrack as well.

The movie is fascinating and completely involving from start to finish and even its three hour plus length is something almost unnoticed.  The characters, the suspense, the beauty of the cinematography and sets, the great acting by the leads, and the lavish and achingly romantic triumphs and tragic story themes explored throughout are all first rate.  And they only bring to mind just a few adjectives I can only think of when recommending with five stars (though it deserves ten) this masterpiece, ""extraordinary,"" ""spectacular,"" ""breathtaking,"" and simply unforgettable.  Despite it all, this movie does one other thing which makes it deserve my highest praise.  It brings back memories of my aging, sick mom (RIP), this being the last movie I saw with her in a theater.  And my main memory of that is that at the end, both of us clapped out loud, and cried.

Finally, perhaps the most astonishing thing about the film however, is the power and almost cosmic taste Cameron gives to what amounts to a simple, old-fashioned (and done before), ""love story."" Imparting a positive, life-affirming, almost logical/rational attitude on the whole concept of romantic love itself, which is something sorely lacking in so many ""modern"" movies, the film often takes on an almost surreal tone on passion and desire many times throughout. None of it however, comes off in any way as ""preachy"" or sugary-sweet and phony. True love and its mysterious veneration for the mundane and ordinary, is treated with reverence, understanding, and subtlety by Cameron in virtually every moment.

I have a feeling it will be many more years before we see such cinematic gold like this again from the studio system. And this took the combined power and money of two studios to even produce.  However, I do hope that if and when Hollywood (as it inevitably must) tries something like this again, it will remember that the real power behind this particular film, has less to do with the fantastic effects or the obvious money spent to pull this off on screen, and more to do with the story and explicit/hidden, almost philosophical meanings and implications.

""Titanic"" is, in the highest sense of the word, not merely great entertainment throughout, but great ART.  This is a treasured gem, more valuable in spirit than the heart-shaped, priceless blue diamond ""Rose"" leaves with ""Jack"" in the end, somewhere at the bottom of the ocean.  For its main message is clear.  True love is invaluable and ""goes on.""  Perhaps even (wishing my mom luck in reconnecting with her own Jack, and my father in any afterlife), truly forever.  A transcendent classic, and an undeniable must-buy for any fan of the movie with a still-functioning DVD player and ""soul.""",1189296000,4,5822,4.859453993933266

It arrived in theaters when I was 18. My father forced me to watch this movie with him.  He made it clear that he was being forced by my mother to watch it and he wanted me to suffer through it as well.  It was easily the worst 3 hours of my life and I've been to jail before.

It's really hard to write a review and not use cuss words, but basically, this movie is complete trash.  There are interesting architectural details that are historically correct and some of the characters are based on real people.  But the movie was ruined by being a completely cheesy love story.  The soundtrack was bad enough that I would only buy the CD if I was going to torture someone by playing it over and over again to get the information out of them.

129438,5,0792151712,"There's nothing wrong with telling a love story against the background of a real-life historical event. That's what Margaret Mitchell did with ""Gone with the Wind"", one of the most successful films ever made from a huge best-seller. And ""Titanic"" is certainly not to be classified as a documentary, thereby making comparisons to ""A Night to Remember"" (which WAS done in the style of a documentary) totally unreasonable. Cameron's achievement here is undeniable, despite some of the negative responses.

""Titanic"" is an extremely impressive movie from every standpoint in recreating an actual ship disaster that took more than a thousand lives. Told in a flashback technique, it focuses mainly on Jack and Rose and their unlikely meeting when she attempts suicide--but also draws in a number of other characters that are equally well integrated into the plot, adding to the intrigue and conflict.

The class distinction that existed then (and now) is shown with clarity--making complaints from previous ""commentators"" meaningless when they say that the film doesn't even deal with this factor. The snobbery was there and is most fully exposed in the depiction of Rose's class-conscious mother.

TITANIC will go down as one of the greatest recreations of an actual event ever attempted on screen--masterful in all departments. The performances, from leads to bit players, are uniformly excellent--but no one has given enough credit to Billy Zane. He's the perfect villain and plays his juicy role with incredible skill and zest. David Warner is another first class villain and he's excellent, as is Gloria Stuart (as old Rose) and Bill Paxton.

The Jack/Rose love affair is played with considerable skill by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, putting emphasis on the class distinction that played a large part in this human tragedy. All of the supporting performances, including Kathy Bates as ""the unsinkable Molly Brown"", are cast to perfection.

The technical credits are beyond reproach with a standout recreation of the famous ship itself, and James Horner's score adds immeasurably to the film's poignancy and drama.

I watched this one while puppy sitting. And I don't have much to say for it other than watching one of the pups look me in the eye and piss on the carpet in front of me as I watched this film more entertaining.

Wonderful costuming. Beutiful and very accurate sets. (These  are why I don't give it just One Star). Good acting but a lousy class warfare driven story and an awful plot with characters who are absolutely too two dimensional to believe.

And what is this story? A 'salvage'/preservation effort at looting the Titanic turns up a drawing of a naked girl wearing a valuable diamond. And then the story follows. She's a seventeen year old girl sold into matrimonial slavery by her fortune hunting mother to a nasty rich kid who is taking her back to missery in Pittsburg. He's a smoking drinking gambling bohemian American expatriate artist on his way home to a questionable future recently from the  Left bank of Paris where he drew naked women who dies in the end but 'frees' her. Everyone poor is portrayed virtuous. Everyone rich is portrayed as bad, selfish, greedy arrogant and snobbish. Which is an insult to the men like John Jacob Astor who died giving up their places on the life boats for poor women to board saying Women and Children First.

And it really sucks.

 They can't even get their math up on the Lifeboats ratio to passenghers. Titanic was designed to carry more than three thousand five hundred passengers and crew while her lifeboat capacty was less than one thousand two hundred. Through poor organization they didn't even use that capacity rather than what this film implies.

No scenes really impressed me much beyond scenery and costuming but if there is one scene that really disgusts me it is that of the crew holding third class passengers at bay and at gun point as first class passengers board the lifeboats.  Next to that it is Murdoch shooting third class passengers trying to get to the last boats, something he did not do.

Overall this film is a BIG BIG disapointment.",1183161600,4,2235,4.604534005037784
129441,4,0792151712,"I have mixed feelings about this film.  It has great moments, a genuinely tragic true story, really lame dialogue, an unbelievable sentimental (though effective) ""romance"", and there are some factual errors in the film (which is not good considering James Cameron bragged about its authenticity).  Yet, this film is remarkable in so many ways.

Titanic, by all accounts, should have been a box office disaster.  It has many things that the ""experts"" say will kill your film.  First, it's 194 minutes long.  Second, it has no stars (Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet were not big stars when this was released).  Third, it's depressing (the boat sinks...SPOILER).  Fourth, it's predictable (the boat sinks...it's a true story).  Fifth, it was a troubled production that had its release date postponed due to cost overruns.  Yet, it is the biggest box office hit of all time.  The look of the film is sumptuous, with great production design, gorgeous cinematography, and excellent acting (for the most part).  Tecnhincally, the film is flawless (Cameron is known for his technological prowess).  As much as I like DiCaprio, I think he's a bit uncomfortable playing a role like this, but he is still believable.  Winslet is superb.  One of the best things about the film is how Cameron contrasts the upper deck snobs with the lower deck ""lower classes"", and how the lower classes are much more human and real than the snotty upper classes are.  Themes like that were not in great abundance in the 1990's.  There are moments of pure poetry and sadness, especially with the musicians playing on board as the boat goes down.

However, the romance between Winslet and DiCaprio is hokey and detracts from the film a bit.  The film also makes a glaring omission that there was a nearby ship that ignored the flares and the calls from the Titanic.  I found this out in the film A Night to Remember, which was far more meticulous about the actual sinking and the reasons behind it.  This film was more about the romance between Winslet and DiCaprio.  There is an awful lot of really bad dialogue here, which also detracts.  Interestingly enough, the only main categories this film didn't get nominated in was screenplay (which Cameron, rather pigheadedly, complained about), and best actor (which DiCaprio didn't show up at the Oscars, which caused some controversy, unwarranted in my opinion).

In conclusion, this is a pretty good film that should be seen.  James Cameron made a film that defied all expectations, and won a bunch of Oscars for it.  As of this writing, he is working on a new feature film called Avatar, but he didn't direct for almost 10 years after this film.  This film took a lot out of him, like Fitzcarraldo and Apocalypse Now did out of Herzog and Coppola (although those films are superior to Titanic).",1183075200,3,2812,4.852941176470588
129442,5,0792151712,"I saw this movie back in December of 97. I had knowledge of the Titanic and I asked myself 'Do we really need another movie about this subject? James Cameron did  a remarkable job and I loved this movie. The 3 disc DVD-let me suggest that any budding filmmaker rather young, in between or old should purchase this DVD. Cameron gives great insight on how to make a movie. The precise and intricate planning,his great writing. His technical expertise and great cinematography. A hands on director no doubt. He can do it all. He is a well educated and intelligent man that knows how to work. Unlike alot of them these days who got their big positions based on who they were related to. Filmakers should pay close attention to his subject on pacing, as a writer myself, the advice on this technique is still the same. I learned quite a bit.

Thank You James Cameron for this fantastic DVD.

The deleted scenes are fantastic, especially the scene where Rose tries to undress herself and can't manage it and she gets so angry...the emotional buildup in that scene helps to explain how she came to nearly killing herself but instead meeting up with Jack. I wish they hadn't cut that scene from the movie...very powerful!

129470,5,0792151712,"Hopefully, Paramount will give us this ultimate version of the film with all of those extras they left out of the 2005 3 DVD USA release. God, I hope. Why should we have to settle for less? I want to also see a retrospective. I'll bet money that Leo won't be doing an interview. I don't think Kate will either. But, it would be nice if those two showed some appreciation for their fans.

Titanic is still one of the greatest motion pictures ever made. It will be on par with Gone With The Wind, Casablanca and Lawrence of Arabia for a long time to come. Also, I doubt there will be a movie within the next ten years that will knock it off the number one spot. But, who knows?

If and when this wonderful film finally comes to HD DVD, don't miss out, buy up a copy. There's nothing like experiencing this film with a big screen and with perfect picture quality.

I am confused. Many have openly admitted that the amount of money Titanic could not have been made by teenyboppers. Titanic succeeded where so many others have failed because it is that good. I wonder if those Titanic haters are jealous. I wonder if they value their one-dimensional perspectives so much, they can't see the forest through the trees. Titanic is a truly great film.

When I first heard about the newest AFI 100 greatest films list, I was counting the days to see just where Titanic would stand. They advertised this list with several pictures of several great films, including Titanic. The Godfather, Citizen Kane and Casablanca were among those films listed. Boy, did Titanic ever look appropriately placed among those equally great movies.

The film made millions - almost billions. Is that any reason to attack it? No. As far as the screenplay complaints are concerned, what makes a great screenplay? If these naysayers can write me a better screenplay to fit perfectly with each and every scene shot in Titanic, I'll start to listen to those complaints. Until then, the film works perfectly with the dialogue that it has. In some ways I can't help but wonder if everyone saw the movie and fell in love with this 3 hour long, costume drama, ""chick flick"" about death, and rejected it.

I bet anything, everyone who first saw the film were instantly awe-struck, and instantly inspired by it. They automatically started considering it among the greatest ever. Then they realized that the film was all the work of one man. It was his screenplay, his editing, his directing, his producing that made the film so great. It may be easy to bash a film that becomes so sucessful when it is all one man's vision. I just don't know.

I've seen my share of films. I've seen Citizen Kane, The Godfather, Lawrence of Arabia, Gone with the Wind and even Schindler's List enough times to really start critiquing them. Titanic is no better or worse in my opinion - just different. Titanic belonged in the top ten on their 100 greatest list. Instead, they put the film under Forrest Gump. There must be something about James Cameron's filmmaking that everyone hates. If it's not jealousy, then what is it? Everyone knows that Ridley Scott's films haven't exactly been all-together successful. Everyone knows that once great directors like De Palma need not be on that list. But when a filmmaker can put out good film after good film or in Cameron's case, great film after great film, there's always something they'll find to use against him. He's an artist. He's in the same lot as Alfred Hitchcock. They probably didn't think much of his art until the more recent years. Maybe Cameron will have to die before audiences and critics start taking his work more seriously. Ha ha! The great James Cameron is a martar now!

No. I don't want him to die. I want him to make great film after great film for many more years to come.

Titanic will most likely be remembered as his greatest achievement. And, rightly so.",1175299200,3,3871,4.622998544395925

The film was groundbreaking in the new technology it devised for special effects as well as the benefit it gave to marine archaeology in the use of it's obscene Hollywood budget to provide technology previously unavailable to scientists.

As a long time casual student of Titanic, I am continually impressed by the film's attention to detail particularly in regard to historical accuracy regarding the ship.

As a love story, it is so wonderful only because he died. They would have been divorced within the year otherwise. Ignore that trite, cliched relationship and enjoy the stunning cinematics and attention to detail that will ensure that this film remains a classic.

129488,5,0792151712,"After many years of not seeing this movie, I stumbled across my old VHS collection, and decided to put Titanic in yet again. Immediately, I was so captivated; it was almost like I had never seen it before. Then I remembered just how fond I was of the movie even when I was young (I was only 11 when it came out!). At the time, I was too young to comprehend many subtle details and lacked the experience of life to really grasp the meanings in much of the movie. Now, more mature, this work has me spellbound. It was immediately after this revived viewing that I purchased the Collector's DVD set. And I'm glad I did.

The movie comes to life far better in DVD. The bonuses are amazing and amongst the best I have ever seen in DVD special features.

And about the movie, so many people quibble about the length of the movie, yet for all its worth, it could have been so much longer, and still have been fantastic. The 3+ hours running time is an excellent medium, and is ultimately necessary for the viewer to be engaged to the modern world, the Titanic's story (told by the now ancient Rose), the tragedy that followed, and the powerful impact that the voyage had on the life of young Rose and others.

On a different note, the visuals are amazing, no question about it. Even though we are all aware that is is not the RMS Titanic, immediately, the mind is transplanted and the time feels real. The ship looks and feels real. The people on ship feel real. Rarely can a film do this; take one setting and make it so compelling and marvelous, but James Cameron accomplished this in so many ways.

The story, following the main composite characters of Jack and Rose is second to none in my opinion. They provide and excellent conduit to see the world that this ship encompassed, everything from the style of the era, the type and diversity of the people aboard, the grandeur and significance of the ship, the layers of the ship itself and so on. Furthermore, we become so captivated in their story (now that I'm older, I can appreciate and understand to the nth degree) that by the tragic end, their relationship is beautiful yet so very bittersweet. Also, the premise that true love can change the lives of others feels so real, making the ending (and the entire movie) simply superb, powerful, moving, and astonishingly beautiful.

And an often overlooked aspect, which really drew me back into Cameron's epic, is the absolutely gripping and appropriate all-time highest selling score by James Horner. The soundtrack fits all the themes of the movies, and is so powerful because of this; love, changing, distant memories, tragedy, are all expressed so perfectly.. Coupled with the acting, it is such a powerful mechanism. One of the best, in my opinion.

After all of this, I realize that this is such a timeless and classic movie. To reject it is to be devoid of one of the best movies in decades, and simply one of the most powerful ever made.",1172534400,,2944,4.5452830188679245
129489,5,0792151712,There are so many reviews and opinions written about this movie that it would be difficult to add something unique. However I would like to emphasize that what really stands out from this movie is the directing the and reproduction of Titanic.  The scene of the engines was extrodinary.,1172361600,,286,4.836734693877551
129490,5,0792151712,"Everyone predicted disaster for Titanic prior to its release. However, contrary to what people anticipated, Titanic went on to capture the hearts and imagination of the world. The immense success of Titanic resulted in many thinking Titanic is now, ""overrated"" and some have gone as far to claim Titanic is the, ""worst movie ever created"". This backlash against Titanic is primarily driven by one of two factors, jealously and many becoming tired of ""Titanic-mania"" accompanied by a desire to be different from the norm. Obviously these reasons cloud the judgment of most of its critics and I plan to set the record straight.

When Titanic was released the world was in the first years of the Internet craze. Everyone was becoming desensitized to human tragedy and was wasting their lives away online. However, when Titanic was released it struck a cord with many people. It reminded everyone that any day could be your last and that you must live each day to the fullest. This is primarily what captivated the hearts and minds of a large chunk of the world. Titanic was released at the very moment many needed a reality-check. It showed us through this brilliantly crafted film that there is still a need for love and compassion and that our world is still filled with human tragedy, not just computers. For that alone, this movie must go down in history as one of the greatest movies ever created.

Another primary reason why Titanic is a phenomenal film is the well-acted love story between Jack and Rose. The love story created an emotional doorway to the tragedy that occurred that night. As a viewer you began to care for the characters. Through this you felt the feelings of those who lost their lives and loved ones on this fatal shipwreck. Having these lovers come from different social classes also allowed the viewers to see the mentality of 1912 through two different perspectives. It gave the audience insight into how man thought they were above Mother Nature, how women were expected to behave and how lower classes were treated inhumanly. The love story was crucial to telling the full story of Titanic.

Titanic has several others qualities that set it apart from other films. Firstly, the amazing music, which set the tone for each scene perfectly. Secondly, the outstanding cinematography that gave a variety of different angles shown in a unique fashion, which thus allowed you to feel that you were actually aboard the ship. Thirdly, the impeccable sets and costumes gave an extremely authentic feel to the movie. Fourthly, Titanic included many interesting facts throughout the film, such as not having enough lifeboats for all its passengers, increasing more speed regardless of ice warnings, telling us how many people were saved from the freezing waters and other numerous facts and figures. Finally, the ending tied everything together perfectly with Rose doing everything she promised Jack and eventually dying warm in her bed, while her soul returns to Titanic.

Cameron's film was flawless for it blended past and present perfectly, while telling the story of Titanic in its entirety. This film deserves the 11 Oscars it received (including Best Picture) and achieving the worldwide position of the 3rd highest grossing film of all time (inflation included). Those who tell you Titanic is undeserving are flat out wrong. Titanic revived what was lacking in the new age of the Internet and reminded us that we must make each and every day count.",1172016000,,3473,4.972461273666093

129493,5,0792151712,"What can I say about Cameron's ""Titanic"" that hasn't already been said? I watched it originally against my will, to please my wife, and was blown away. I had been led to expect yet another brit-bashing epic where the wicked aristocrats trample the poor working class - that's how it had been presented to me. Instead I found a film that portrayed clearly, accurately, and, most importantly, with balance, the world of the early twentieth century with its vast contrasts between haves and have-nots.

Many have complained about the score, or about Cline Dion's rendering of the theme song. Personally, I believe that the score was as near perfect as any movie score can be. And if you don't happen to like Cline Dion, well, that's your problem. I was a Cline fan back before she ever learned English, and I still am. I still find her version of ""The Heart Will Go On"" (minus all the crummy DJ remixes) to be absolutely magical (especially from the top of the Las Vegas Eiffel Tower, looking down on the Bellagio fountain ballet!)

And yes, ten years later, the film still enchants and impresses. Every time I watch it, I'm overwhelmed by the incredible attention to detail, the breadth and depth of the screenplay, the amazing special effects. I could wish that Cameron had eliminated the hokey scene with Jack handcuffed to the pipe, but apart from that, there's nothing I would add to, or take away from this movie. If time has jaded your tastes to the point where you can no longer appreciate it, I feel sorry for you. If ""maturity"" has robbed you of the ability to express your appreciation of it, then shame on you. The ""Mona Lisa"" is a magnificent work of art, no matter how old it gets, or you get.

129534,5,0792151712,"Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), is an artist who loves to draw, is a nice man, and he is also a poor man that wins two tickets to the Titanic, ""This was a ship that was unsinkable.""

Rose is a lady that lets her mother torture her by telling her what to do and her fianc Caledon is a very jealous man. When Jack took this experience of going into this ship he found love. When Rose and Jack meet each other in this ship, they immediately start to like each other. Not only do you see love and romance, but there are also other things that are going to happen in this movie, including violence.

The Titanic is a grabbing and sad movie.

129536,5,0792151712,"In Titanic, not only has James Cameron created a masterpiece of cinema, he has shown us the magic of love that can strike like a bolt of lightning.

Those who dismiss the romance of Jack and Rose as completely implausible have themselves never had the glorious experience.

I have.

I saw the love of my life across a crowded room, fell swiftly and madly in love with her and married her more than 35 years ago.

The love of Jack and Rose is rare but it certainly does exist and James Cameron has given us a look at that rare gem.

There is none so blind as him who will not see.

I found it hard to fathom how people could find this movie awful when it is so clearly a masterpiece.  Then, I remember, the master's art is judged by all the cynicism or joy WE bring to the moment we experience the art before us.  It is our own baggage that drags us down.

If we do not have the experience or the hope of a deep and abiding love, we can never believe one could exist.

There is a reason Titanic is the most successful movie ever made.  It has deeply touched millions.  They have the capacity to deeply love and experience what Jack and Rose felt.

I sincerely appreciate James Cameron's creation of this masterpiece.

This movie is not so much about the end of a ship as it is about everlasting love.

Leonardo DiCaprio is terrific on screen with big charisma... Conveying passion, trust, insouciance and ingenuity, he a free-spirited wanderer with artistic pretensions, and a zest for life...

Kate Winslet is absolutely lovely as the confused upper-class teen engaged to a nasty rich guy who finds herself, one night, plunged to the depths of despair...

Billy Zane is an arrogant racist, abusive and ultra rich who would lie, cheat, steal, bribe with money or even use an innocent young child to escape defeat... He keeps a 56 carat blue diamond worn by Louis XVI...

Kathy Bates is the legendary unsinkable Molly Brown, the richest woman in Denver, who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship...

Bill Paxton is the opportunistic undersea explorer in search for a very rare diamond called the ""Heart of the Ocean.""

Gloria Stuart is the 101-year old woman who reveals a never-before told love story... The nightmare, the horror and the shock are imprinted upon her deeply lined face...

Frances Fisheris is the impecunious cold snobbish mother who, deathly afraid of losing her social stature, forces her daughter to become engaged to marry a rich, supercilious snob...

Victor Garber is the master shipbuilder, the real-life character who attempts to fix time, to measure it, in a sense, to make it into history...

Jonathan Hyde is the White Star Chairman who wants the Titanic to break the Trans-Atlantic speed record, in spite of warnings that icebergs may have floated into the hazardous northern crossing....

'Titanic' is loaded with luminous photography and sweeping visuals as the footage of the shipwrecked Ocean liner lying motionless on the ocean floor; the incredible transformation of the bow of the sunken 'Titanic' that takes the viewer back to 1912, revealing the meticulously re-created interiors; the first sight of the Titanic steamed steadily toward her date with destiny; the Titanic, leaving the Southampton dock, and some dolphins appear jumping, racing along in front of the luxurious ship; DeCaprio and Winslet flying at the ship's front rail in a gorgeous magic moment; the intertwining of past and present as Jack was drawing Rose on his paper, the camera zooms closely on young Rose's eye, only to transform its shape into Gloria Stuart's aged eye...

Chilling scenes: Titanic's inevitable collision with destiny; James Cameron--in one of the most terrifying sequences ever put on film-- takes us down with the Titanic, finally leaving us floundering in the icy water, screaming for help that never comes...

Winner of 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, James Cameron's ""Titanic"" is a gigantic epic where you don't just watch the film, you experience it! The visual effects are amazing, like no other film's... The decor is overwhelming... James Horner's music intensifies the emotions... The whole movie is hunting and involving, filled with a wide range of deep feelings...

129539,5,0792151712,"Many have complained that this film is too long or that it has too much sappy substance to it, but that's what makes this film a STORY.  Obviously, if you're not into the whole star-crossed lover bit then this film is not for you.  However, I think that James Cameron did an excellent job of incorporating the story of Rose&Jack (or Kate&Leo) into one of history's most tragic events.  Both of these actors really came into their roles and the acting was extremely convincing.  They made the plot seem beautiful, intriguing and worthwhile, whereas many other actors could have easily made it seem cheesy, sappy and a waste of time.

As far as the movie being too long...what would you prefer?  That James Cameron take his budget and film a two-hour film of a sinking ship?  The point of the film is not to recapture what happened on the Titanic.  Everybody is already well aware of that.  The point is to introduce a new element into it; the story of Rose and Jack.  This is what makes the film worthwhile.  Again, if you're into action and little emotional substance in a film, then this beautiful drama is not for you.

For what it is, I think Titanic is an excellent movie.  Every moment in the film is spent building a very well thought out plot.  Sure, you know how it's going to end, but that isn't the point.  Sit back and enjoy what James Cameron has given us: a masterpiece that will stand the test of time and is to date the highest grossing box-office movie.

First of all - let me get this off my chest - I will admit that when I saw this film for the first time in 1997, I was rather awed by it.  And - even more embarrassing - when it came out on VHS some time later, I bought it right away, <mumble> maybe even the first day it was released </mumble>.  I watched it several times after that and, I assume, enjoyed it.  This may be attributed to 1) Billy Zane's personal heat quotient or possibly 2) the movie's visual lushness which is, admittedly, amazing or even perhaps to 3) the Titanic's enduring mystique.  Watching that gorgeous ship with all of those gorgeous people break in half and go down the bottom of the Atlantic brings it home in a way that a book, even a picture book, really can't.

However, it must be said that the storyline that weaves all the Titanic information together in this piece is incredibly weak and unbelievable, and both Jack (Leo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet) are both immensely annoying.  Especially Rose.  Old Rose is a bit more palatable, but not by much.  I mean, what kind of old lady travels across the globe to the middle of the ocean with a gazillion framed pictures, most of them of herself?  Ack.  This is not immediately apparent to the viewer, but if you do the math (1997 minus 1912 subtracted from Old Rose's stated age) Young Rose is 16.  Sixteen.  No wonder she's so self-involved, shallow, defiant, and passive agressive.  She's sixteen.  She's basically teenage dressmaker's doll who's had a little continental polish, enough to blather on about art and think she knows something about it.  But she's not old enough or worldly enough to realize that her life with her future husband, obnoxious as he is, will be a thousand times easier and more pleasant than the life of anyone traveling, oh, say, four decks below her.  James Cameron's endowment of Rose with his own late 20th century goals of feminist self-actualization seems at best awkward.  When Rose whines about having to marry to make her life and her mother's life easier, you can't help but think of all the people in steerage who are headed for the coal mines or the sweatshops and happy about it just to give their children more opportunities in life.  Poor, poor Rose, consigned to a lifetime of art collecting and society lunches.  The heart breaks.

But is Jack any better?  He seems to have no qualms about poaching another man's fiancee.  Or about deflowering a sixteen-year-old he has made to plans for or commitments to who would be ruined if that deflowering were made public knowledge.  He has nothing to offer her and no apparent history of gainful employment.  If DiCaprio weren't so anemic looking, his history of hobo-ing and hanging with prostitutes might seem - well, creepy.  But, of course, it isn't creepy because he never slept with those prostitutes.  Of course he didn't.  Nah.  And since from the moment of their meeting he's been devoted to helping Rose realize her true self.  Whatever that means.  Probably dragging her down several castes to where the real people live because it's more than GLARINGLY OBVIOUS that to Cameron rich equals snobbish, repressed, and controlling whereas poor equals carefree, happy, and friendly.  Isn't that what the back-to-back Rose-and-Jack-go-to-dinner scenes is supposed to telegraph to the viewer?

Really, considering that the Titanic briefly housed some 2200 souls, it seems quite likely that at least 2150 of them might have been more interesting protagonists for this little morality tale.  The boat was full of millionaires, diplomats, presidential advisors, military men, and just plain brave emigrants on their way to a new life.  Second Officer Charles Lightoller , who Cameron manages to portray as a panicky coward, actually had survived several sea disasters, pestilence, a revolution, and being marooned on a deserted island.  After the ship sank, he managed to keep the overturned Collapsible B with thirty passengers calm and afloat all night.  What are the odds that he would let loading the lifeboats freak him out?

It is only in the last third of the movie, when the ship begins its dramatic demise, that the film becomes really interesting.  The dynamics of the collision and its afteraffects - that's fascinating in a macabre fashion.  Titanic was so beautiful, so glamorous, that watching her list, take on water, come apart, and sink into oblivion is like watching a movie star go out in a pointless blaze.  Tragic.  Only its a muted tragedy because if - like me - the viewer isn't invested in Jack and Rose; the other 2200 people are so much floating luggage we never got to know.  No matter that there were hundreds of dramatic last moments, brides separated from grooms, fathers separated from wives and children, whole families who stayed in steerage because the calculated the odds of their being saved as nil - those stories aren't ones Cameron tells.  Instead we get Jack telling Rose that winning the Titanic ticket was the luckiest thing that ever happened to him because it meant he got to know and love Rose and sacrifice everything so she could thumb her nose at her Cal and her mother once more and become the true woman she was meant to be.  Gag.

And then Old Rose drops a million dollar necklace into the sea in - what? - remembrance. What a waste.  Like this whole movie was.  The waste of an opportunity to make us see what a turning point Titanic was in history and why a two whole nations were shocked and stymied and appalled at what had happened that April night.",1168560000,9,5575,4.746361746361746
129541,4,0792151712,"This movie won 11 academy awards and was over three hours long. Okay, fine. First let me say this was a good movie. I liked it. Now here's the problem. This movie was an hour longer than it should have been. When I watch a historical movie, what I expect is an accurate, educational, and well-done depiction of true events that have redeeming social value and purpose. What I do not want to see is a completely pointless, uninspiring sappy sub-plot designed to make a bunch of puberty suffering teenage girls swoon at the sight of a scrawny, uninspiring, mediocre actor known as Leonardo Dicaprio. It seemed this movie's purpose was to sink more into the depths of pointless romance than it did the Atlantic ocean. However, on the plus side this movie was a realistic depiction of the demise of the Titanic. The special effects were top notch. James Cameron's filmmaking skills were at their best. Cameron is also known for his work on such films as Aliens and the Abyss to name a few. So Cameron's work is definately worth recognition here. But a truely great historical film as I said before sticks to it's main purpose in accurately depicting real history, not a teen romance flick hiding inside a sinking ship.",1168387200,3,1214,4.677570093457944
129542,5,0792151712,"But being a hopeless romantic, I definitely loved it. The hopeless relationship on the doomed ship, was dramatic and sweetly pure.

129563,2,0792151712,"There was a time in my youth when I, being innocent and inexperienced, succumbed to the pressures of watching this feigned romantic drama set against the backdrop of history. Even at the time I found the plot to be artificial and cliche, the acting dry, the character development terrible, and the special effects quite impressive (the only real reason to see the movie). While Leonardo DiCaprio has evolved into a spectacular actor (e.g., the Aviator, Catch Me if You Can, the Departed), this has to be by far the most trite, redundant and superficial role that I've ever seen him in as an actor. I would say the same for Kate Winslet (who proved her acting abilities in Eternal Sunshine).

I'm not a big fan of special effects; I've always preferred strong plot lines and character developments. However, if you like those kind of blockbuster special effects then you might enjoy this film, and if you're a teenage girl you'll probably watch this film several times and do a Google image search for Leo. Compounded with the lackluster acting performances and subpar plot, the music for the film (esp. Celine Dion's big hit) is banal, sappy and devoid of substantive sentiment.

I would avoid this film at all costs. If you've never seen it then you've avoided one of the more recent cinematic blunders of pop culture.",1168041600,7,1319,4.8061674008810575
129564,4,0792151712,"I really enjoyed this remake. I love the original, and I think a good job was done staying true to the original, while managing to update it for a new generation. I've seen a lot of remakes, and very often you get a sense like the director is trying to avoid ties to the original movie, but not here.
I thought this movie was fast paced and fun. It kept me interested all the way through. It was quite violent at times, and gory, but when your subject matter is about an all consuming space blob on a huge boat, named the Titanic, you sort of expect that kind of thing.

The interaction between the characters was pretty well done.  Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jack, our hero who is also an outcast due to his rebellious nature. Kate Winslett plays the female lead, the all American cheerleader homecoming queen type. The two are thrown together to fight the blob.

This version starts off essentially the same as the original, the blob arriving from space and attacking an old man in the boat. The old man is found by the poorer people on the boat, and is taken to the infirmary, where the blob proceeds to consume some characters. Jack is initially suspected by the police, as he's no stranger to them, but they have no physical evidence to hold him, so they have to let him go. Soon, people in the boat start disappearing, and the police have their hands full. Jack and Rose are the only two who have some idea what's going on, but when Rose tries to relate her story, what she saw, no one really believes her, and Jack isn't very credible, due to the reputation he has with the boat in general.

Soon, the blob starts making itself known, consuming many people. Some kind of rich lady shows up, and seals the boat with the purpose of capturing the voracious organism. Facts about the origin of the blob come to light, and it seems the boat captain has a larger agenda than they originally stated. I thought it was quite funny how a number of people would fire at the blob with pistols and automatic weapons, only to find it had no effect on the creature. There were some pretty horrific scenes with people getting consumed by the blob, showing them basically dissolving as if bathed in acid. One scene in particular was when a ten or twelve year old boy gets taken. I was surprised to see this happen, as it seems pretty rare to me that kids get hurt or killed in these monster movies. I did see this when it came out, which was like 9 years ago, but I didn't remember that part. I didn't mind so much, as the kid was pretty annoying. There's a climatic battle at the end, and the teenagers save the day, but in the last scene we are left wondering if the horror is truly over.

The main differences between this movie and the old version are the effects and the level of violence. In the old version, the violence was more implied, where this version expands on that, showing us many people being consumed. Also, the poor people in this movie can really pass themselves off as poor people, while in the old version, the actors seemed a little older than was suggested. Also, some interesting plot elements are added which suggest the creature may not have originated from space, but here on Earth. Also, the special effects are well done, and show us more of what we didn't see in the old version.

I think the old version, which I also own, is and always will be a classic, and this makes a nice companion and is a good movie in it's own right.",1166572800,,3446,4.3765625

The plot of the movie is so unique. It is not just about the sinking of Tintanic. There are so many more elements to the story than that.

I've always enjoyed period pieces and this was such a fabulous step back in time, Kate Winslet looked magnificent in every scene. Each gown, hat, and piece of jewelry were perfect!!!

He had such an eye for detail in every scene, especially during the sinking of the Titanic, right down to the dishes falling to pieces!

129591,5,0792151712,"I liked this version of the Titanic story when I saw it on the big screen, and I've seen all of them except a silent reel made shortly after the sinking in 1912. I've been a Titanic buff for 50 years now, and read most of the books. However, last weekend I went to a museum to see ""Artifacts of the Titanic"", a collection of more than 100 items snatched up from the debris field two-and-a-half miles down, things once connected to the White Star Line or to individual passengers which survived 80-plus years underwater. It was incredibly moving and sad. Connected with the exhibit was an IMAX showing of James Cameron's ""Ghosts of the Abyss."" The ""Titanic"" director took some of his enormous profits from this 1998 release, and in 2001 he rented a Russian ship, two submersible submarines, and two robotic cameras, and went down to the wreck himself, taking along actor Bill Paxton from the movie. The resulting hour-long giant screen film is excellent. If you get a chance to see it, or the salvaged items, don't pass it up. Meanwhile, the movie works. So have most of the earlier versions, and so have most of the books, because the tragedy speaks to people of all ages and classes. The fictional parts of Cameron's film work better than the fictional parts of earlier movies about the disaster, in my view.

The acting is good, and the music is stunning (the ""My Heart Will Go On"" song by Celine Dion is one heck of a ballad), but the movie itself is simply too long and way, way too scary and emotional (no small children allowed for this kind of film); not to mention there are quite a few thematic elements here and there that I could have done without.

I know this is based on what really happened, and I know this is supposed to be a dramatic love story (I'm a sucker for romance), but there are certain things you just don't care to see on-screen. I do like drama, but this movie goes overboard with the whole drama thing (no pun intended). The scenes where the ship sinks, and where you see all those frozen corpses in the ocean--including poor Jack--have to be the very worst. I'm not saying the scenes are lame, but they're definitely too much for me. The movie people didn't underdo those scenes, they overdid them.

129599,5,0792151712,"First off Titanic won 11 acadamy awards and should have won 12 but I'm sure Hollywood jealousy had something to do with it. Hollywoods golden boy, Steven Speilberg didn't even show up at the Oscars in Mar. 1998 to represent his picture 1997s Amestad. Jealousy probably? Any negative reviews for this movie are just plain jealousy. Especially from our beloved Hollywood bigwigs. From Steven Spielberg to William Friedken all the way down the bigwig directors list all have negative comments about Titanic (1997). Jealousy run rampid, because none of these bigwig directors could have made a film like Titanic. I do recall when Titanics release date was pushed back in June 1997 to Dec. 19th 1997. The budget for Titanic was going over $200,000,000, all of Hollywoods bigwig directors and producers were laughing their arses off preying for James Cameron to fall on his face and sink to the bottom of the Hollywood depths with his version of Titanic. The amazing thing about Camerons Titanic is that  from Dec. 19, 1997 to Jan. 2,1998 the movie only made about or just over $30,000,000 in the USA, reciepts at the box office were low Paramount, 20th Century Fox were very unhappy and wanted Camerons head on a silver platter. Then amazingly word of mouth to ears about Titanic were spoken among the American public, from that point on Titanic 1997 went on to make domestically over $600,000,000 in the USA and a mind boggling $1.8 billion dollars world wide, that is only movie reciepts not merchandise including vhs or dvd release. God only knows with this dvd special edition release Titanic could gross over $2 billion. Spielberg and Friedken have amazing cinema achievments I take nothing away from their work in cinema. Yeah! I know the ticket prices are much higher than when ""Gone With the Wind"" came out in 1939 surly if the ticket prices were at 1997 prices in 1939 ""Gone With The Wind"" would have earned alot more than Titanic 1997. Yeah right!!!!!! and I can buy Bill Gates out to! "" Gone With The wind "" is a masterpiece don't get me wrong it is one of my all time favorites. God forbid if a maverick director like James Cameron could make a movie worthy of ""Gone With The Wind"". If Speilberg or Friedken or any other bigwig director made Titanic 1997 it would be considered the greatest movie ever made surpassing even ""Citizen Kane"". Main charachters Jack and Rose were only a guide to take you the viewer aboard the Titanic. Decaprio was not oscar material but his part as Jack Dawson was played smoothly and realistic forgive Leo if he did not have the looks of a young Tony Curtis, that was not Camerons point in the Jack Dawson charachter. Kate Winslet was splendid as Rose and took talent to speak American in the movie. The real acting credit should have went to Billy Zane as Cal Hockley. Billy was incredible and recieved no mention of any awards at all at the Oscars. Billy did not even attend from what I recall in March 1998. I saw an interview with a bald Billy Zane outside the oscars after they were concluded, Billy knew he wouldn't get any awards an chose to skip the oscars. This movie is as close as you could get to authentically reproducing the real events that night in April 1912 with the help of Titanic historians and experts Don Lynch and Ken Marshall. Years from now people will laugh at the love story of Titanic 1997, but Camerons film depicting the events on April 15th 1912 will be watched as the most historic and accurate depiction of that fateful night ever in any movie of Titanic made before or after Camerons version. Each actor(s)playing Captain E.J. Smith to Thomas Andrews the ships desighner to John Jacob Astor to Iwan Murdoch, to Margaret Brown to Lady Duff Gordon to Sir Cosmo were picked to look like the real people aboard the Titanic. Camereon spared no expense for his epic. Cameron had to have the finest effects the biggest budget, the biggest stage set ever created for a motion picture. Many Hollywood bigwig directors Speilberg, Friedken all the way down the list, critized Cameron for his absorbanent needs, hoping James and Titanic would flop. Not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the truth be known none of these bigwig bozos could have accomplished what Cameron did with all these lavish resources Cameron had. All or most of the Hollywood bigwig director bozos could not even conceive how Cameron let alone a human being with great directing skills accomplish the awesome, staggering completion of the Titanic 1997 production. How the hell did this  James Cameron, film 12,500 feet under the Atlantic ocean in a mini sub, oh by the way James did use the real Titanic, yeah! The real Titanic! Not a model. Let these Hollywood bigwig directing bozos Spielberg, Friedken etc. go to the bottom of a 12,500 foot ocean and direct a massive piece of rust, not happening!!!!!!!!!!. None of these director bozos have the skill and know how to do what Cameron did with Titanic. Believe me I am sure with all the jealousy from our great Hollywood directors and producers they to this day are shocked and amazed how the hell Cameron pulled this mind boggling production off and be the highest grossing film of all time sorry George Lucas, you brought me alot of joy with the Star Wars saga but the force is not with you or the rest of Hollywoods fine directors, except for James Cameron. You the reader of this review from movie goer to film student to director, sit back back and watch the Fox special ""Breaking New Ground"" on this dvd set and realize what Cameron accomplished with Titanic. ""Believe me the Hollywood bigwigs have""!!. I saw an interview with Linda Hamilton, Camerons old flame, a few years back and stated that James got a big head after the success of Titanic, this was after they broke off their relationship. You know what I say to that "" no one should show off any achievment, but Cameron deserved to have a big head on his success. Ignore all the nay sayers of Titanic 1997, they are all jealous or just don't care for the story. Enjoy this beautiful high definition film transfer to dvd, Titanic 1997 finally gets the treatment it desreves.

129655,5,0792151712,"Ah, what can be said about `Titanic' that hasn't already been said?  What possible input could I have to offer that you haven't already heard?  I doubt much, but I'm going to give you my opinion anyways, basically because I've been wanting to write this review for months now, and it wasn't until five or six minutes ago, when the credits got finished rolling that it all came to me...what I needed to say.

`Titanic' has already been cemented in the history books as one of cinemas finest accomplishments, hailed by critic after critic as the best disaster film ever released, and even further, one of the greatest films ever...period.  `Titanic', even after all the hype, truly lives up to it's name and is deserving of every ounce of credit and attention it receives, and yes, despite what many believe and contrary to all the `LA Confidential' fans (I being one of them) `Titanic' truly deserved to win the crown.  (I just wish it could have been a tie, I mean, `LA Confidential' is just as magnificent...)

Now, I truly believe that `Titanic' won for one reason and one reason only, and no it's not because of all the so-called `undue' attention or `over' praise.  I believe `Titanic' won because it struck a chord with modern day America, much like the recent `Brokeback Mountain' (although `BBM' didn't fair as well at the Oscars).  Watching `Titanic' for what must have been the hundredth time I realized something throughout that I wasn't privy too before, or at least didn't take the time to notice.  `Titanic' is less about a ship sinking then it is about a woman being set free from the chains that are binding her to a sinking ship (that ship being her life, not the literal sinking Titanic).  I mean, it's something I've always known and I assume everyone who has ever seen `Titanic' (which is pretty much everyone) has known, but it wasn't until tonight that it really sunk in.  Like Bill Paxton's character states towards the end of the film... ""For three years I've thought of nothing but Titanic, but I never got it.""  That's how I felt tonight.  I've seen this movie plenty of times since it's release but it was tonight, staring into Rose's eyes that I truly got what this movie was all about.

The love story between Rose (Kate Winslet...just breathtaking) and Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) is just a sideline, just a plot to keep you watching, but it's the growth that Rose's character undergoes, the release sort-of-speak that she encounters that really is the base of this extraordinary film.  Rose is a woman trapped in a life she wishes to be no part of, a life that she never asked for yet was forced upon her by her overbearing mother and her controlling and manipulative fiance (Billy Zane in a commanding and Oscar snubbed performance).

As everyone is aware, this film revolves around Rose and Jack as they live out an ill-fated love affair for a few days, defying all odds to be with one another, and as Jack sinks to the bottom of the ocean your left with a feeling of contentment, for even though Rose is losing the only man she's ever loved you know she has gained more in the past few days then she'll ever gain in her lifetime.  She gained happiness and the will to move on.  You can read this in her face.  There are two scenes in particular when you see this transformation in Rose.

The first is when the boat is sinking and the lovers are at the back of the ship.  They have yet to climb over the railing and Rose is looking to each side of her.  She glances to her right and she sees a young woman gripping the railing for dear life and she's all alone.  Rose looks up at Jack and then back to the woman.  You can see in her face, Rose's face, that she knows she has everything she needs with her at that very moment.  She has no need for anything else, and you can see this growing pity for the young girl, there all alone, for she has no strength to survive when you have no one to live for.  Rose has a reason to hold on.

The second is after the boat has sunk, when Rose first realizes Jack has died.  After the initial shock is over and she has stopped repeating his name she lays her head on his hand and closes her eyes, catching her breath, and as you can only imagine, contemplates whether she really wants to be rescued.  Why should she live without the man she loves?  But before the thought can fully cross her mind her eyes are open and you can see this conviction, this dire motivation to live.  Jack gave her the strength and the reason to live, with or without him.  He showed her that she doesn't have to be trapped; she doesn't have to be what they (her mother and her fiance or anyone really) want her to be.  She is her own person, and as we realized the moment she jumped from the lifeboat back into the sinking ship, Rose has taken hold of the life she should have never let go of in the first place.

Everyone gets so wrapped up in the fact that Jack dies that they forget this isn't about loss as much as it is about life.  As Rose states at the end of the film... ""Jack saved me, in everyway a person can be saved.""  A friend of mine told me that she hates this film for the reason that the love affair between Jack and Rose is unbelievable.  She said that there's no way that these two could have fallen in love.  I told her she missed the point, and that she did!  Regardless of whether or not Rose `loved' Jack, he was her everything because he was the only one who `gave' her anything.  Everyone around this poor girl was taking advantage of her, using her for their own personal gain, but Jack was the first person who ever saw her for who she was and looked for ways to make her happy, to `do' for her and not take away.

Rose loved Jack for setting her free.  It's up to the viewer to decide whether or not these two were truly in love, but I think it's foolish to believe that these two weren't in one way or another more than just lovers.  I personally feel they truly loved one another, for when Jack says, ""winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me"" you believe him for you know he's right.  But more so than loving him, she needed him, and that's a key point to remember.

`Titanic' will always be remembered as cinematic genius, but lets not forget the reason we love this film so much.  `Titanic' showed us so much more than a sinking ship, and gave us so much more than a glimpse at the terror of that fateful night.  It gave us inspiration to live, reason to find meaning in our lives and live each day as if it were our last.  As Rose toasts to her dinner mates... ""Here's to making it count"" and that's the point isn't it.

As the final frames of this film roll on we see a desk cluttered with pictures of young Rose making it count, doing everything that Jack inspired her to do.  She no longer lived her life controlled and afraid but she put caution to the wind and lived, plain and simple.  I want to take a moment and mention that this film would have been nothing had the beautifully talented Kate Winslet not been a part of it.  She embodied her character and proved to be the lifeblood of this beautiful and heart wrenching film.  With just her eyes and the slightest movement in her face she creates a feeling and tells a story that all can read, a story of a young woman afraid of everything, a young woman that finally learned to love, to live and to fly (cut to corniest part of the film for visual effect... ""I'm flying!"").

129657,4,0792151712,"The strength of Titanic is that we come to genuinely care for Kate and Leonardo during the first half of the movie, so that when the second-half disaster sequence ensues, we are emotional invested in the thrilling struggle for survival as the ""unsinkable"" luxury liner sinks, cracks apart, and submerges.  Titanic is also better than your typical disaster flick because we come to care about the common folk who populate the steerage and the working people who make the ship run.  When disaster strikes, you really feel for these people as they struggle for survival against all odds.  Although the disaster sequence is quite lengthy, interest is maintained as focus alternates between travails of Kate&Leonardo and the other passengers of the boat.  The dramatic arc of the film is superb.  Each phase of the disaster is thrilling.  And although the (titanically-expensive) art direction feels like a movie set, it sufficiently satisfies as the setting for this large drama without screaming ""look at me"" too often.  Our hearts and eyes stay on Kate&Leonardo throughout.

On the other hand, Titaninc has major flaws (therefore needing to be knocked down a peg).  First in my estimation, is the dialogue.  The dialogue was written at about the level of 7-year-old.  So, it doesn't surprise me that children flip over this movie.  The fact that Titanc was ridiculously popular does not validate its laundry list of Academy Award nominations (in paritcular the Best Screenplay nomination).  Fortunately, the drama is buoyed by some good acting, particularly Kate Winslet, DiCapprio, and Kathy Bates.  It is said that acting is the art of listening and responding.  It is the manner in which Winslet listens and responds to DiCapprio that really makes the romance believable.  Not that DiCapprio is bad, but Winslet's performance makes their duo greater than the sum of its parts.  Similarly, Kathy Bates's response to the snobbery and cold-bloodedness she encounters brings life to the class warfare on the board the ship.

I also must strongly disagree with the accolades for the soundtrack and title song.  The music is uninspired and vapid.  It is not bad, and at least it does not detract from the movie.  But, there is nothing extraordinary about it in the least.

Other weaknesses are the flimsy one-dimensional characterizations.  The only sympathy we are allowed to have for any of the upper class passengers is when we discover that Kate Winslet's mother has a motivation beyond pure greed.  The character of the greedy, unscrupulous, jealous, and immoral Cal only serves to provide an antagonist to Kate&Leonardo.  Each act of heartless aggression from Cal provokes an equally heroic and steadfast response from the not-so-young couple.  Any dispute over whether Cal really loves Kate is pointless.  Attempting to examine his motives is pointless.  Cal's actions service the plot and the action of the film, nothing more and nothing less.

Titanic is a fun, heart-warming ride which most audiences will enjoy, but don't expect anything deep, profound, or intelligent.  Do expect to shed some tears and to walk away floating on a cloud of romance and nostalgia (if you allow yourself to indulge in the fantasy).",1151971200,,3218,5.120921305182342
129658,5,0792151712,"The bonus material on this DVD is amazing. It lived up to my expectations. If you're a fan of this movie, I highly suggest you buy this special edition.",1151884800,,152,4.275862068965517
129679,5,0792151712,"I have read through all the reviews so far, and could not believe how many people said Kate Winslet is fat! Argh! Having curves just adds to her beauty; I'd have a harder time believing in a corpse-like leading lady winning Jack's heart. This was 1912, not the body-image-obsessed present day. She is a beautiful woman and looked simply wonderful (albeit she looked a bit older than her movie-age, 17).

I'm also in the minority here by declaring that I did not see Cal as ""evil"". Certainly, he had a temper and a clueless approach to romance, but I believed he genuinely loved Rose, evident by his expressions and the great lengths he went to in an attempt to keep her. Rose didn't have a dime, so it's not like Cal was adding another vast fortune to his own. It seemed to me his major fault was his approach in not treating Rose as a person to cherish but rather more his cherished possession. He finally realized he had a heart in time to have it broken, and reacted accordingly. I was touched when he went down to steerage on the Carpathia, hoping to find Rose among the survivors, and I don't think he was just hoping to get the diamond back. This happens a lot in movies like this- that the fiancee/husband is portrayed as a heartless jerk in order to make the competition more heroic.

Otherwise, the movie was dramatic, touching, and heartbreaking, especially the final scene-pure poetry.",1151712000,2,1396,4.58
129680,5,0792151712,"Titanic is a romantic, adventurous, and a thrilling movie all combined into one to make the perfect movie. It contains moments of exuberance, humor, and tragedy. In their own way, the characters are all larger than life, but they're human enough to capture our sympathy. Perhaps the most amazing thing about Titanic is that, even though Cameron carefully recreates the death of the ship in all of its terrible grandeur, the event never eclipses the protagonists. To the end, we never cease caring about Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio).

While Titanic is easily the most subdued and dramatic of Cameron's films, fans of more frantic pictures like Aliens and The Abyss will not be disappointed. Titanic has all of the thrills and intensity that movie-goers have come to expect from the director. A dazzling mix of style and substance, of the sublime and the spectacular, Titanic represents Cameron's most accomplished work to date. It's important not to let the running time hold you back. The movie is about 3 and a half hours long but you won't realise it because it goes by very quickly. Although this edition of the Titanic story is far from the first, it is the most memorable, and is the most deserved for Oscar nominations not only in the technical categories, but in the more substantive ones of Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Actress because they all did a magnificent job.",1151366400,2,1416,4.875518672199171
129681,4,0792151712,"...James Cameron is an action-flick hack director of ""Terminator"" fame and actually wrote this film's screenplay, so I rented it with low expectations, just wanted something easy and mindless to kill 3 hours with on a slow Saturday night, and being a longtime fan of the ever-spunky Aussie babe Kate Winslet (who looks much better as a blonde than a redhead, I might add), I figured what the hell...

I was surprised that the computer animation was actually not very impressive; at no moment did the boat in the film ever look like it WASN'T just a smaller-scale, computer-animation-enhanced model.  Probably a result of being used to today's level of computer animation which is light years beyond what was available during the mid/late 90s when this film was made.

YES, the film does take very long to tell its story, the first 10 minutes with the framing narrative of present-day sea explorers digging through the shipwreck was pretty tedious all right.

YES, there are some awful bits of purple and bombastic dialogue that no human being with a pulse would say in real life (especially DiCaprio's speech at the fat cats' dinner party about the Romantic and Zenlike glories of his wandering artist's existence).

YES, the film does take a sudden schizoid turn into more typical Cameron action-potboiler during the last hour after the boat finally smacks into the iceberg, with plenty of stock Hollywood cliffhanger moments (y'know: the hero and heroine seem completely doomed but against all odds somehow manage to miraculously pull it out at the last second and narrowly escape some gruesome death in order to repeat that experience in about 30 seconds of screen time).

HOWEVER, there were 2 highly redeeming aspects of this film that completely surprised and impressed me:

1.  The quasi-Marxist, Class Warfare subtext --- DiCaprio plays a working class everyday boy and Winslet an aristocratic girl about to marry into millions; the big boat is worked by working class grunts and most of the passengers are equally of modest means and crammed into very tight quarters and mainly left to die as the ship sinks and there are only enough lifeboats for half the passengers.

2.  The live-for-in-the-moment-while-you-can Zen subtext --- DiCaprio does a nice little speech about this while dining with the fat cats around Winslet, but tragically this theme is even more under-developed than #1 during most of the movie.

In the hands of a better director, if #1 and 2 had been pushed to the forefront and instead of the overreaching something-for-everybody approach that Cameron took, this could have been a truly great film.

As it stands, ""Titanic"" is fairly entertaining, in large part due to the charisma of the two young leads---enjoyable but not really worth owning.",1151193600,3,2774,5.019607843137255

FIRST THOUGHTS: DIFFICULT FILM TO PUT INTO PESPECTIVE UNLESS ---

Viewing ""Titanic"" to learn about the ship is alot like viewing ""Gone With The Wind"" to learn about the Civil War. In both cases the titles are vital settings that are done extraordinarily well, but the films are both about the same something else. The life changing event that caused epiphanies in the female leads are what Titanic, and Gone With The Wind are all about. Everything else simply contributes to the events our leading women, Scarlett O'Hara and Rose DeWitt, must endure to reach salvation for themselves, and thereby radically alter their destinies.

FLASHBACKS REVEAL ILL-FATED TITANIC ROMANCE & MORE

Certainly not for children, but a potent fictionalized drama that will strike an emotional cord for all viewers, and resonate loudly for some, especially young women.

WHAT IT IS ""TITANIC"" ABOUT:

""Titanic"" is about an improbable, lightning romance aboard ship, between two young people of completely different classes. It is vividly reenacted for us by a 100 year old woman, who, upon being questioned by the salvagers, describes the happenings that she recalls, ostensibly in regard to the whereabouts of a priceless diamond necklace that she was portrayed as wearing in a painting found aboard the ship, dated April 14, 1912, by a team within a submersible salvage vessel.

The salvage team's discovery of the titanic, now, some 85 years later, was motivated by the expectation of finding the priceless diamond necklace. Originally, within the context of the film, that is the only reason this secret romance, and the epic story which includes the historic tragic sinking of the Titanic, is recalled and revealed to us -- the audience.

FINAL THOUGHTS: A FILM WOMEN 'SEEM' TO ENJOY MORE THAN MEN

See this film in the way you would view ""Gone With The Wind"". There are powerful, even grisly scenes, and the depiction of the sinking is grand and accurate, but the story is more about the romance between Rose and Jack, than anything else. If you are looking for a film which makes the ship the star of the film, and for its theme, its sinking, consider viewing, ""A Night To Remember"", 1958, starring Kenneth More.",1149811200,,5272,5.0011534025374855
129684,2,0792151712,"For Women: You get Leonardo DiCaprio and a love story.

For Men: You get a sex scene and plenty of death.

For White People: You get to see a lot of white people and no blacks. (I'm being facetious.)

For Black People: You get to see a lot of white people DROWN.(I'm being facetious, I told you.)

For Young People: You get to see two youngsters as the leads.

For Old People: You get to see that there is a heaven when you die.

For Rich People: You get to see the underprivileged working so far in the bottom of the ship they look like they're underneath it.

For Poor People: You get to see a bunch of rich snobs DROWN.

Titanic is overblown and badly written. It's Gigli with a 200 million dollar budget. Only Gigli has better acting. The love story isn't believable at all. I applaud Cameron for using a woman who isn't wafer thin, but you never really buy Kate Winslet as a love interest of Leonardo DiCaprio. One re-view-er (Clint) even said religous people were hypocrites to love this movie because the love story with Winslet and DiCaprio has them having premarital sex. Honey, if religious people avoided every movie that had elements of sin in it, they'd never watch anything. You don't have to condone things in order to enjoy them. Get with it man!

I wanted Titanic to lose so badly at the Oscars, but much to my chagrin, it didn't lose.

It was laughable that everyone thought Leo was worth 25 million a movie after this. I notice no one contemplated giving Kate Winslet 25 million a movie even though she shared the lead, and is a much better actor.

In a nutshell, the movie isn't that good. It is a technical achievement in film, but it lacks a soul. Not to mention, the folks could have drowned 45 minutes sooner.",1149033600,4,1733,4.401253918495298

129687,5,0792151712,"I've noticed recently how various critics and the general population treat Titanic horribly with the test of time. I find it shocking how a movie that was once regarded as one of the best movies of all time has fallen ill to tons of criticisms. People seem to find it hip now days to bash Titanic and I fail to understand why. I personally find it to be the greatest movie ever made, the Academy Awards seemed to think it was a pretty damn good movie (tied for the most wins), the soundtrack and the single ""My Heart Will Go On"" shot to #1 Worldwide, the critics when it first came out weren't too harsh and movie-goer's truly expressed how the general population felt about Titanic with the gigantic ticket sales (3rd Worldwide with inflation, 6th in the United States with infation).

Now, however, Titanic makes the ""overblown movie"" list(s) from several critics, endures extreme mockery and the ridicule of anyone who actually admits to loving this film. This may be due to many wanting to be different from the norm in 1997-1999. Maybe this mentailty never went away? Or maybe it was the cheesy scene's people like to mock over and over which obviously must mean the entire movie is cheesy. However, I recently watched Titanic the other day and I'm going to say why I find it to my favorite movie of all time.

Lets start with the basics.

Titanic was authentic and historically accurate. It included more then just the love story. It had information about the lifeboats, the binoculars, how exactly it sank, the famous people aboard the ship and numerous other things. Even things such as the first-class band and their situation, what exactly was sung the last time day light hit the Titanic at the morning church gathering, increasing more speed regardless of ice warnings and many more examples were all little details included in this movie which made it far more then just a ""love story"". The sets, costumes, and the special affects were amazing in this movie. They basically built an entire ship for this movie, with extreme detail to being authentic. Just watching this movie is visually amazing.

Now more indepth thoughts.

The ship Titanic itself expressed a mentally during this time period in which humans felt they could overcome Mother Nature. With the sinking of this ship it made people truly eat the words ""Titanic is an unsinkable ship"" and the idea that man could overcome Mother Nature.

With the character Rose a first class passenger, you are exposed to this arrogant high society. Rose also opened your eyes to the luxuries high society had and how woman were truly trapped and were seen as second-class citizens. Rose almost committing suicide helps drive home how truly horrible it must have been for woman during this time period. The dynamics between Rose and her mother also show the dynamics between how woman had to behave and in a sense how they survived in society at this time.

With the character Jack, a third class passenger you are exposed to how large the gab between the rich and poor was. How first class dogs went down to be walked on the lower decks, how it was the poor who actually built Titanic and how it was the poor who were treated truly unfair on Titanic just because of social status, which also helped express the mentality of this time.

Having these two characters meet and expose the viewer and each other to these different lifestyles helped truly put into perspective the mentality of what this time period was like. Sure, it was in a way a clich e love story, two people from different world's falling in love. But regardless of it being typical it still exposed the different classes in a way that truly made you realize how it was for people back then. Also, many things are clich e for a reason, they most of the time work and have been shown to work time and time again.

Many complain that this movie was too much about the love story between Jack and Rose and not enough about the actual ship and the facts surrounding it. However, most everyone knows the basic facts around the Titanic and this movie was created to change this.

The love story in this movie created sympathy in which you felt for Jack and Rose. It made you truly feel how the people on the Titanic were feeling at that exact moment. Families, loved ones and friends were being torn apart. Without the emotion created from this love story you wouldn't have felt nearly as sad or seriously towards what had actually happened to these people. This makes the love story important to the actual event itself because it creates a feeling of emotion, which many people lacked before seeing this film.

Knowing the facts (like the crew who was searching for the heart of the ocean did) does not mean they actually get the entire story of Titanic. However, once they heard this story it helped them understand how truly tragic this event was. So, I'm all for having this movie be a love story, because without that people wouldn't have understood the true story of Titanic.

The ending of this movie was amazing. Everything tied together.

-When Jack died. In most love stories they would have both survived and lived happily ever after, but this truly hit home the pain people felt after this shipwreck.
-When Rose actually had the necklace. This shocked me. I  also thought releasing it back to the water was cheesy but very symbolic.
-When they showed the pictures of Rose doing everything her and Jack talked about and dying warm in her bed as he said she would was a wonderful way to end it in my opinion. I don't know why but it just seemed like the perfect way to end it.
-Oh! And how Jack was waiting in the same spot he did earlier in the movie was wonderful.

Titanic did have things in it that were cheesy, like the kissing scene at the front of the boat, the drawing scene and the ""I'm king of the world"" scene. However these scenes's helped keep the audience drawn in regardless of their cheese factor. Also running around the ship and opening the locked gate at the last minute before they would have drowned was also cheesy. But it is a movie and you have to have suspense, and even though these things were unlikely they were still probable and made the movie entertaining.

One of the major flaws people say this movie had was the acting. I however thought it had amazing acting and I saw nothing wrong with it. Acting is something that is hard to pin-point in terms of being good or bad. I find it an easy way to attack any film. If you say the acting is bad, you cannot really ""prove"" to that person it was good. Acting is something that just goes to personal opinion and you cannot really change someone's mind on it. I personally give an A+ for acting and even the script. But one thing to consider is that many shots could only be done a few times or even once because of what they had to do to the sets, making it sometimes hard to get the perfect take.

Honestly, this movie had everything. Funny parts, love, death, drama and beauty. I enjoyed this movie and am proud to say it is my favorite.",1148428800,7,7048,4.550118389897396

I've been watching it all the time since i was six and i can practically recite the whole movie.  How could u not like it?  It has sadness, funiness, and it set on the doomed ship.  The special effects are amazing for their time and the story line is amazin too giving us some lines we'll NEVER forget!  Honestly in my book there is no movie greater than this one.  And personally how could u not like the special edition even more?  I mean it has deleted scenes and such.  lets just say that i love this movie and i loved the special edition even more!  Ok well go buy its its amaaaaaaaaazing!",1147996800,,724,4.173913043478261
129709,5,0792151712,"...and I have to say ""Wow!"". What a movie it was back in the late 97, and still is today after this sorely missed proper treatment. This is one of the best films I have ever seen. And having been, since I was a little boy, very interested in the facts and myths about the famous and haunting ocean liner, you'd have no idea how much I was looking forwards to see the beautiful Titanic brought back up to the surface again... and again and again. I think I saw it three times in the theatres which is to say I was not disappointed. Maybe I thought that they'd overdone the action just a bit the first time, but still. I was overwhelmed by the amazing effects, the ship, the filming, the music, the acting, the presisements of the shots of historical facts between the story being told on the screen (you really learn how to value all that planning and timing watching the extra material on the new edition, really impressive and a reason to love the movie itself).

Many reviewers have stated this already and written excellent facts about the movie and the various editions so I won't waste anymore of your (nor my) time. If you haven't seen ""Titanic"" already, well, what are you waiting for? And if you likes the movie, and you're curious about how they managed to do some of the amazing shots, my response is the same. This should belong in your dvd-collection.

About the deleted scenes (one of the main reasons why I bought this) I have to say I would have enjoyed an extended edition of the movie. This because a lot of the edited material would have done anything but ruined the film. Some of the shots I can understand were cut, but a couple exlaines a little more about the eager for ""The heart of the ocean"" the treasure hunters were having despite the old lady Roses' story about what really happened on the ship before it's tragical fate.

Thank God they didn't use the alternate ending, what an extra disaster that would have been. I was actually surprised they'd even come up with that as an outcome of the amazing story, and it actually looks like a parody or something -but they didn't use it, and that's what's important. The original ending proves that sometimes less is more. And what a perfect ending!

Highly recommended, if not larger it is as large as life!",1147651200,,2279,4.471153846153846
129710,3,0792151712,"I thought that this was an excellant film.

Beutiful scenes. Excellant acting by the supporting actresses and actors. Beutiful costuming. Great special effects.

But it could have used a little work. Deleting all scenes with DiCaprio and what's her boobs would be my first recomendation. Would have improved the film greatly. I would also delete the class bigotry. The scenes of armed stewards shooting passengers have long since been disproven. Many rich men chose to go down with the Titanic so poor women ahd children could live. many men chose to die, shouting 'women and children first'. The first officer also deserves a little respect.

Otherwise a great film.

A trival goof. Tommy Ryan wasn't a passenger. He was one of the crew. A steward.  Two other Ryans, Edward Ryan and Patrick Ryan were, both third class. None of them related.",1147132800,,842,4.943262411347518
129711,5,0792151712,"Every once in a while the conversation will turn to ""favorite movies."" I'll mention Titanic, and at least a couple people will snicker. I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears by that very movie. And they're too embarrassed now to admit it.

I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years. I cried again.... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time. A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people won't even admit they enjoyed it. Folks, let's get something straight -- you don't look cool when you badmouth this film. You look like an out of touch cynic.

No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults. Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly. However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. Wait 'til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully.

James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night. How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me. I was utterly transfixed.

This film is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow, ""flying"". ""Iceberg, right ahead!"" The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean. The screams of the doomed after she went down. And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.

The music, which has also been a victim of the film's success, was a key ingredient. James Horner's score was simply perfect. And the love theme was beautiful and tragic. Too bad Celine Dion's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.

I confess, I am a Titanic buff. As such, I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it -- in all its beauty. Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because I've had such an interest in the ship all my life. However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity.

One thing I noted - and saw for the first time - the duty bound officers aboard, the old ""there is not to question why, there is but to do or die"", for it was obvious the people aboard the Titanic left behind, never thought it would sink as fast as it did...the Captain went down with his ship. It seemed to me they made saints of some sinners, and sinners of some saints - and the Oh So Social returning from Upper Egypt were made to appear as though they were not gentlemen, but a bunch of ruthless,hate the poor robber barons.  This movie was anti our Giants but stop to think - this Giant of a Ship destroyed, and aboard some of America's giants killed as if they had all walked into a trap - even some of the crew made to appear ruthless, etc., which was not true - for in the Radio Room lay the secret to the demise of the Titanic......while this was some type of a propaganda piece it is worth watching - true the script was almost childish and whoever wrote same, should take refresher course in TRUTH ABOVE ALL....but all it all it is a collector's item, and we got a peek of the most beautiful ship in the world - and it made me wonder WHO IS KILLING OUR GIANTS?

129744,5,0792151712,"DISCLAIMER: This is a review of the movie ""Titanic"" that I wrote back in 1999.  Having bought the Collector's Editon DVD, I've decided to post it - plus, I just found it buried in my stuff.

March 1999

Okay, so I saw ""Titanic"". I was expecting to have a gut-wrenching experience and go through numerous boxes of Kleenex.  However, I found myself waiting for things to happen. ""Okay, this is where the third class passengers kick the ice from the iceberg around like a hockey puck.""  Not that the film wasn't well done.  It's magnificent.  It's just that those who have taken more than a cursory glance at the story of the Titanic  over the years and have ventured beyond the summaries given in grade school history books, already know the true tragedy that occurred that dark, starry night in 1912.  James Cameron seems to be presenting all these ideas, such as class discrimination, human vanity and pride for the first time.  Perhaps many of the peoploe who are so 'floored' by the 'shocking revelations' are in fact only seeing these truths for the first time in their lives. Let's face it, with the casting of Leonardo DeCaprio and a gorgeous Kate Winslet, Camerson knew good and well who the majority of his audience would be.  Perhaps this is the genius - knowing that teens would come running hom, anxious to drag all of their friends and family to see it and share the experience.  By making it appealing to today's teens, he was able to draw them in to teach them the more important lessons more effectively than any history text where it would have been just another answer to memorize for the test.  However, he brings in the teens (who it seems these days are oblivious to the definition of true tragedy), lured by the romance of Leonardo and Kate, only to allow them to see the greater tragedy at hand.  most young people probably expected to be moved by the romanticism, only to brutally discover that they're reacting in a an opposite manner than they had expected.  Who knows, maybe it even jostled a few self-absorbed, angst-ridden teens out of their lair of self-pity.  The age range is a very impressionable one.  But as much as I had heard about the stories of the Titanic while growing up, seeing the stories portrayed gave me and eerie feeling. One girl told me that the file made her angry.  That she feels the need to discuss it with someone.  This is good. To hear a teenager make this kind of statement warms my heart and gives me hope for the future.  Here is something that I've been marvelling at for years.  Seeing this on film produced a strange calm within me. It's almost as if I feel justifed now that I knew there are people out there in the next generation that are feeling the way I've felt about Titanic for so many years.  I no longer have to explain to those around me when they ask why I have so many books on this subject.  The appropriate emotions have been safely handed down to the next generation.  The girl I talked to also said how she kept hoping that the boat wouldn't sink - even though she knew it wouldn't.  I used to hope for that.  I'm glad that Cameron decided not to go for the easy out - the Romeo and Juliet ending, or worse, the fairy-tale, happily ever after ending. Billy Zane survives, Leonardo doesn't.  The world isn't fair.  But as the movie keeps driving home, life goes on.",1145750400,,3342,4.497512437810945

129746,5,0792151712,"Titanic is the story of Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt-Bukater, two ill-fated lovers who find each other on the ill-fated ship, the Titanic. The film itself is rated PG-13 for sexuality, nudity, language, and violence. It runs at 194 minutes (3 Hours and 14 Minutes), but nothing of this three hour spectacle is boring! James Cameron's dazzling spectacle of reinventing the wheel is what Titanic is. It is beautifully crafted. It is well-written. It is beautifully acted, and it is beautifully directed. The film has flaws, but for this spectacle, thirty flaws is nothing compared to an hour and a half length film with one hundred goofs.

The film opened in December 1997, with a first weekend opening of only 20 million dollars. That is hard to believe, i know, but check anything. It only opened with 20 milion dollars under its belt. That is probably about sixty million dollars today. It would soon grow hype as the best film of the year and earn more that six hundred million dollars, the highest grossing film of all time, in the Unted States alone and over 1.2 billion dollars worldwide. This film was the best picture of 1997, winning 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Costume Design, Best Original Song, and best everything else dealing with cinematography and sound, along with visual effects and music scores.

The first DVD release of Titanic was pretty weak, I must admit. All that it had was the film itself in 5.1 Dolby Surround sound with the theatrical trailer. It was also only on one disc. This release of the film was released in 1999. The 3-Disc, ytes 3-Discc set came out on October 25, 2005, leaving Titanic fans, and movie fans, with the collection it well deserves. Entertainment Weekly gave the Special Collector's Edition of Titanic a B-, but it should have received an A. The DVD includes everything a fan could dream up and much more. The first two discs consists of the wonderfully crafted film and audio cmmentary, along with some featurettes. On disc three, though, it includes the who she-bang! It includes 7 featurettes, historical commentary, historical facts about the Titanic itself, the real ship, the ""My Heart Will Go On"" music video, over 45 minute of deleted scenes, original concept poserts and one sheets, the whole Titanic script electronically, over 650 pages on the television, visual effects breakdowns, demos, and so much more! THe film is an amazing, dazzling spectacle ehich should be cherished forever and for always. Thanks to Paramount for giving Titanic the rightful collection i deserves. It is by the far the best film and best picture ever made!",1144800000,,2630,4.907865168539326
129747,4,0792151712,"The special effects are great in this film, and the love story is compelling. Even though there is no uncertainty as to how this movie plays out, it is still quite dramatic and interesting. I particularly enjoyed the extras on the DVD, especially how digital actors were inserted as the boat sank, showing how so many fell to their deaths while still on board without having to perform these scenes with actual human actors and actresses. Plus, you have to marvel at a movie that managed to win the Academy Award for best picture and was also a huge box office hit - a distinction shared with few films over the last twenty years.
However, there are a few oversimplifications of the social situation of the passengers in the context of the realities of the early 20th century that bug me every time I watch this movie. First off, there is a heavy handed message of rich = bored and unhappy, poor = genuine and full of life. Given that there was absolutely no social safety net anywhere in the world in 1912, there could be nothing more brutal and grinding than being poor in that era, as if there is any such thing as ""easy poverty"" at any point in history, including today.
Second, and somewhat accompanying the first sticking point, is the idea that Rose will somehow be free to be something out of a 1969 Virginia Slim's commercial if only she can lose that rich stiff she is engaged to (Billy Zane's character, Cal) and run off with kindred free-spirit Jack. This illusion not only confronts the fact of grinding poverty in early 20th century America, this flies in the face of entrenched sexism enshrined in the law  during that time that wasn't even confronted as a problem until the 1960's. Who, in 1912, is going to let Rose put on a pair of jeans and ride side-saddle on Coney Island? Let her learn to pilot a plane? Allow her to pursue her career goals unless they involve teaching school, nursing, or performing (i.e. doing something that involves serving men)? And even learning those skills cost money she did not have. The fact is at that time a woman in America or anywhere else in the world was considered property. She could either be the property of a rich man (evil Cal) or a poor man. The only main character in this movie that seems to be facing facts is Rose's mother who shows genuine terror at the idea of being poor again - and she SHOULD be afraid, VERY afraid.
I once had a 3rd sticking point, but it has been nullified over the last five years. That sticking point was that Billy Zane's character could feel so superior and entitled given that his wealth and stature were accidents of birth, not the fruits of his own enterprise and imagination. I have since come to realize that some of the smuggest most entitled people on earth are those that were born into their circumstances, so I withdraw that objection.
This movie did do a service by dispelling the myth that the slogan on the Titanic was ""women and children first"", when it was, in fact, ""first class women and children first"". In reality, if you were a first-class woman, you had a 97% chance of survival, and just about every first class woman that did die chose to stay behind because she did not want to leave her husband. If you were a female steerage passenger you had about a 45% chance of survival. Worse yet, third class children had a 1 in 3 chance of survival, which was the same rate of survival as the first class men. Not one of either the first or second class children died on the Titanic.
Thus, I am glad I bought this DVD set, and I still enjoy the movie and the extras immensely, but I think that the false presentation of early 20th century social reality will always bother me a little every time I watch the film.",1144195200,2,3723,4.466960352422907

Although over 3 hours long, this movie is so captivating. The cast is superb with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet giving outstanding performances as Jack and Rose. The poor guy and the rich girl romance is very touching. I personally think that BILLY ZANE, who plays Cal in the movie, should have been nominated for an award for his spectacular performance!!!! He added so much to this movie. Without him, the movie would not have been the same. The movie was perfectly casted and the special effects were bar none. Of course, no one will ever forget the ""I'm The King Of The World"" quote made famous by Jack in the movie. The first half is a true love story until the unthinkable happens and Titanic hits an iceberg in the North Atlantic. From that moment on, it's a heart pounding race to see who will survive and who won't. We see so many souls lose their lives and it makes us think of the terror these people went through who were on the real Titanic ship. This is truly a movie that touches you in many ways. We see Jack freeze to death in the icy waters and Rose hanging on for her life promising Jack that she'll never let go. The movie also gave us the beautiful song by Celine Dion... My Heart Will Go On. A song no one will ever forget for it will forever remind us of Titanic and true love. It's not a wonder why Titanic has been called the most popular movie of all time. James Cameron touched everyone's heart from beginning to end. The film ends as the ""old"" Rose falls peacefully asleep in her warm bed after finally letting go of the Heart Of The Ocean necklace she had kept to herself all those years. We realize she dies in her sleep and is then reunited with Jack standing in front of the clock and all the other people who lost their lives in this tragedy. They can finally be together forever. I would give this film more than 5 stars if I could. A true masterpiece that will never be forgotten and will always remain a classic and one of the best films ever made. It could not have been done better. I suggest everyone buy it and treasure it for years to come.",1140652800,3,2260,4.35781990521327

I remember when this filmc ame out how hugh it was and no one would expect it to become the highest grossing film ever and win 11 academy awards(tied the most with Ben-Hur and Lord of the Rings: Return of the king). The best dissaster film ever to be put on screen. While you watch it espesially when the ship is sinking you are left without words to explain how great this film is. The story is about a doomned love affair aboiard the doomned luckery liner Titanic(which actually sunk in 1912). The acting is good but at times you watch it thinking it could be better acting. The special effects are just excellent. Overall a great film one of the greatest films ever and it will not go away and we will always remeber it.,1139875200,,818,4.25

129812,4,0792151712,"I have officially joined the ranks of Those Who Have Seen Titanic.  I fought it long and hard.  Back in 1997, when it first debuted, I waged a massive campaign, sent out a horde of evil beasts and mercenaries to destroy every living human.  Oh wait, that's when I was Sauron.  Anyway...

It had become readily apparent that this was The Chick-Flick of All-Time, as well as the highest grossing movie.  It broke attendance records that were held by Star Wars for something like twenty years.  Demographics showed that every woman in America, age 30-50, had seen this five times apiece.  (Of course, I'm only slightly exaggerating.)  I decided then and there that I would not see it.  James Cameron, the mediocre bastard who gave us Terminator II and True Lies, did not need anymore fame or money.  This whole Titanic bit had clearly gone to his head.

So last night, I finally watched it because I could do so with the knowledge that I was not giving a damned red cent to anything related to that film.  Because I checked it out from the library.  And you know what?

It was pretty good.

I could have done without the modern-day beginning, narration, and ending, though I can understand why they were in there.  The acting was fantastic, the sets were beautiful, and apparently pain-stakingly accurate.  I even got teary-eyed a couple times because of the intense emotional charge.  Especially when the band stayed to play, when the couple slept on the bed as their room flooded, and most of all, when Rose blows the whistle.  That scene is so fierce, as it is the fulfillment of her promise and there's just this I-WILL-LIVE ferocity in her eyes.  It was beautiful.

I'm very happy this movie was made.  It allowed Leo DiCaprio to not work for a long time, and gave him the freedom to choose his roles much more carefully and allowed him to only do what he wanted and, unlike a lot of actors, not take crap roles just for the paycheck.  It also gave us Kate Winslet, who has become one of my favorite actresses of all time.

So all in all, it was good, and I'm glad I waited eight years to see it.  I wouldn't have appreciated it back in 1997.  I'm a much more empathic and emotive person now, which allows me to enjoy life and its many accoutrements with a greater depth and breadth.

129814,1,0792151712,"This is like the most over-hyped movie in the history of cinema. How could a guy who brought us such great hits as Terminator, Aliens, and True Lies have made this stinker?

From the beginning, I questioned why this movie even needed to be made. WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. The boat crashes and sinks. Yes, that's a horrible disaster but it can hardly become a story, let alone a 3+ hour movie.

So we have a contrived story then. Rich, snobby white girl meets poor, grubby creep, sees the good in him, rejects her good-girl upbringing and joins the dark side. She becomes a promiscuous tramp, and she does it for love.

So basically what we are saying here is that this movie has virtually the same plot as ""Grease"". Only a heck of a lot more boring, with no cool music, 50's cars, or leather jackets.

I find it interesting that evidenced by this movies' stunning box-office sales, many Christians seemed to have no problem with the morality that it protrayed. A girl meets a guy, has a good time, decides that she likes him, strips for him, gets horny, and the next thing you know they are having sex in the back seat of a car - literally. (What the heck was a car doing on the Titanic anyway? But I digress...)

This is considered ""TRUE LOVE"". In other words, what would be called a quite sleazy one-night stand in any other context is here embraced as a love story, apparently because some expensive jewelry and a dead artist are involved. If you take out the necklace and the handsome dead guy, you've basically got the same plot as a typical ""Penthouse Letters"" magazine story.

It just goes to show you how fleeting the morality of the religious types in this country truly is. Apparently, morality is only important when it is convenient. If it gets in the way of telling a so-called ""love"" story, then it can be ignored. We can overlook the fact that they shacked up before they got married, because it was love right? It must have been true love, because we have a necklace to prove it. (A STOLEN necklace, by the way. Must have cost the guy a lot, huh?) Also, what woman would have obsessed over a guy for 50 years after the fact if it wasn't true love? It MUST be true love. Heck, it's romantic right? So let's forget all this morality stuff.

Hey, don't get me wrong. I'm all for consenting adults doing whatever it is they want to do. I just can't stand the hypocrisy of people who want to tell us how great this movie is on a Saturday night, then head for church on a Sunday morning. I mean, give me a break. I'm not THAT dumb.

Even if you love this movie, if you're honest with yourself then you've got to admit that it is just a teeny bit over-hyped. Come on, admit it!

I have yet to meet a guy who really likes this movie. All men I know who have seen it did it as a favor to their significant other. They watched a chick flick to keep their woman happy. In that regard, this wouldn't be a bad movie if only it were not so dad-gum long.

After this movie, I couldn't stand pretty-boy Leonardo Di'Caprio for the longest time. Mainly because of all the women I saw fawning over him because of this movie. It was only when I saw ""The Aviator"" that the man redeemed himself in my eyes. As an actor, he truly did an outstanding job in that movie.

129817,5,0792151712,"Watching writer/director James Cameron's 194 minute masterpiece TITANIC (1997) in one all evening sitting on letterboxed DVD alone in a dimly lit bedroom, I felt a miracle pass over me that I seldom feel at a movie.  This is not just a great movie.  This is one of the great motion pictures of my lifetime, one of the greatest of the movie sound era.  It is flawlessly crafted on every craft level and down to the smallest detail.  It has a highly intelligent and very interesting screenplay.  And it has a dream cast who give performances they can all look back on with great, great pride.

It all starts with the writing.  Cameron gives us all of Titanic's voyage, unlike A NIGHT TO REMEMBER (1958) just doing the night the ship sank in April 1912.  We need those first few days to get acquainted with this exquisitely lovely ship (re-created both as miniature and almost full-size in Baja California) and its passengers.  And no one else seems to see the triangle romance between Rose-Jack-Cal as akin to a 1912 D. W. Griffith silent romantic melodrama-dashing hero, lovely heroine, and dastardly villain.  Plus an even nastier villain, the despicable manservant Lovett.  This is especially so in the gripping climax with Jack handcuffed in a steerage room, Lovett with a gun, and Rose swimming down a flooded corridor with a fire axe in one hand; and Cal callously seeking her out as she debates getting into a lifeboat.  Pure Griffith melodrama-sublime.  And my heart stopped when (SPOILER ALERT!!) survivor Rose is hiding from unjustified survivor Cal on the deck of the Carpathia.  Man, I detest him!

Cameron was a fanatical perfectionist, determined to let his audience truly feel they are passengers on the real Titanic, again re-created perfectly down to the slightest detail, from furniture and wallpaper and china in first-class, to the look and feel of steerage, to the boiler room and car garage.  The Oscar-winning sets and elegant first-class costumes and breathtakingly beautiful wide-screen cinematography are stupendous achievements, as is the loveliest of music scores by Oscar winner James Horner.  (The movie won a whopping eleven Oscars, including editing and sound, and was nominated in three other categories.)

The night of the ship's sinking is also done just right and really gets to you emotionally.  You are with those characters in lifeboats that were in some cases heartbreakingly only half-full, or on the deck of a huge ocean liner that is literally splitting in two.  You really feel the frosted breath on freezing passengers on overturned wood pieces in a freezing clear deep blue night ocean with a starry black background.

Most of all, I think TITANIC is a flawless movie gem is because of the towering starring performances by Oscar nominee Kate Winslet as young Rose and Leonardo Di Caprio as Jack Dawson.  This is acting the likes of which I have seldom seen even as a film scholar.  These are performances of a lifetime, the type that both talented actors can look back on decades from now with deep pride.  So will I.  But Billy Zane as the nasty and egotistical Cal, David Warner as the reprehensible Lovett, Frances Fisher as Rose's unpleasant mother, Kathy Bates as the likeable ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown, and especially the amazing 87 year old Oscar nominee Gloria Stuart as Old Rose (blessedly still with us) are also wonderfully right.

You simply must buy and lose yourself in the three-disk DVD of James Cameron's movie miracle, on sale for only $20 at Target and also Amazon.com.  The first two disks have the 194 minute movie in wide-screen format, with three audio commentaries.  James Cameron (on the one I chose) talks about his deep dives down to the real shipwreck in the years before the movie was made and how those dives both deeply moved him and inspired him to tell the true story of the ship as a memorial to its 1500 victims.  He talks about fanatical realism, safety, but also a lot of movie wizardry with visual effects.  For instance, the people clinging to wood in the freezing ocean under a 2 a.m. starry sky-this was shot in 70 degree water, four feet deep, in a tank in Escondido, with faked frosty breath, and computer graphic night sky!  Amazing.  The other two audio commentaries have cast and crew on one, and Titanic historians on the other.  Maybe one of these can be played by me on the April 12th anniversary.  Needless to say, the DVD quality is unequaled, and you get to watch the whole movie in pajamas, stretched out on a bed, taking breaks with a pause button whenever you need or want to.

Disk three has a full three hours of bonuses, including 45 minutes of very good deleted scenes with optional commentary by Cameron; a mock 1912 newsreel; more on deep dives down to the real Titanic site, which also provided blueprints for re-constructing the ship for the movie; a haunting Celine Dion music video of the Oscar-winning song ""My Heart Must Go On""; visual effects breakdowns; and press kit and publicity material.  It takes a whole evening and tells you everything you want to know about the making of the film, especially if you play the actual movie with one of the optional commentaries.

James Cameron allegedly really drove his cast and crew hard to get TITANIC right, but always with safety in mind.  There must be a thousand people listed in ten minutes of closing credits, including dozens of lifeguards and stunt extras when the ship breaks in two.  Everyone here has proudly raised the bar on what movies can do and how passionately one can embrace them, even on a tiny TV screen on DVD.  After all, you don't think this movie had return business week after week at the box office to become one of the five highest grossing movies of all time if people were not reacting to something very special here.  The unforgettable tragic romance between Rose and Jack. Amazingly, it still has that feeling alone on home video at night.  Maybe more so because the romance is so private and intimate.

This 1997 masterpiece is a movie to cherish and embrace passionately as the highest pinnacle of movie art and emotional storytelling.  Thank you again, Kate, Leo, and Mr. Cameron!  The queen of the world and her two kings, now and forever.",1137024000,4,6231,4.787652011225444

That alone would take one uninterrupted day. Then you can watch all of the deleted scenes which, in my opinion, should have been left in. Not one of them is garbage and some are very helpful in tying things together, like how Rose went from looking pristine to disheveled before she decided to jump off the ship in the beginning, or what happened to Lovejoy.

The story is ludicrous - a completely unrealistic soap opera (nearly impossible during this time period), with one-dimensional villains Zane and Warner, more concerned with bumping off the innocuous Leo than in saving themselves from the sinking ship.  Just when you think the thing can't get any sillier, the villains and their intended victims go sloshing through knee-deep water (which, by the way, would have been freezing cold on that horrible April night in the north Atlantic, but appears to be a comfy swimming pool here) trying to shoot one another.  Beyond all that, the characters are among the most one-dimensional ever put on film.  Everyone who ever earned an honest dollar, or managed to amass some wealth, is evil; those without a plugged nickel are one step removed from sainthood.

As a Titanic junkie I had to sit through the whole wretched thing and I did enjoy seeing the nicely reconstructed ship in full color, but in the future, when I want to see a good film on the Titanic disaster, I'll watch ""A Night to Remember,"" or re-read Walter Lord's wonderful book again.

From the wonderful song performed by Celine Dion to a detailed breakdown of the movie's many scenes much is offered here over the original release.

While many criticize the script for this work as insipid I do not. From the beginning when  a turn of chance takes our hero Jack to the ship and thence to his great love I was enthralled. I also greatly admire Mr. Cameron for the courage and imagination of vision that led him to undertake a perilous underwater visit to the wreck of the fabled liner. He shot his own underwater footage. The imagination and effort that went into the sets to create the very real illusion of sinking is nothing short of truly amazing. This movie was (and still is ) knocked by some critics for its lack of ""substance"". I could not disagree more. The viewer's themseves have voted and the verdict was and is overwhelming.

129904,3,0792151712,"There are a number of things that are unforgivable in this movie, and what's significant about them is that they all stem from the writing.

While the number of Oscar nods `Titanic' received might have been contentious, there can be no argument that James Cameron didn't deserve one for his screenplay. While his storytelling strengths lie mostly in a clear, confident and sturdy hold on and account of the historical events that transpired, his characterisation leaves much to be desired.

Stereotypes abound amongst the passengers on board, the most glaring being the overly emphasised contrast between the apparent wisdom of the bereft and rustic, and the ignorance of others well off to the point of apathy and callousness, since it is, basically, the primary means by which the two protagonists are drawn to each other.

Character development is hardly aided by some very campy and affected lines and scenes. Jack's rescue of Rose from the latter's attempted suicide, for instance, strives for amusing, unexpected absurdity as Jack manages to interject with a brief lecture on ice-fishing, but tumbles off the thin line into being plain ridiculous. The deleted scenes on this DVD reveal the very worst of Cameron's trite writing that, thankfully, never made it to the final cut. If he can't be credited with decent writing, though, he certainly gets the thumbs up for storytelling instincts. It's a genuine fortune, for example, that Brock's Epiphany didn't end up as the movie's conclusion. When Bill Paxton awkwardly asks Rose's granddaughter for a dance, the by-the-numbers Carpe Diem contrivance gloriously implodes from a false sense of what constitutes an emotional resolution. It takes you away from Rose by trying fruitlessly to accommodate Brock's moment of enlightenment, and, by tacking on a lesson about making the best of life, it feels strained and thoroughly undermines everything Rose was put through.

Several elements save the movie, though, and one of them is good acting, particularly from Kate Winslet. To an extent it doesn't harm that her reputation precedes her in this movie - because we know she has the acting chops to pull off more intelligent material like `Sense and Sensibility', we know the vigour she exhibits when emoting is a real attempt at getting close to her character and not overreaching. Her sincerity makes Rose's blossoming convincing, and it's the same honest quality with which she fills the shoes of her character that salvages her suicide scene with Leonardo DiCaprio, for one, from being entirely unbelievable. Again, there are several instances where Cameron tries too hard to drive home the characteristics of each onscreen persona, but in the case of Rose, who stares wide-eyed and surprised at horse-riding with one leg on either side and petulantly and weakly commands Jack to return to his part of the ship, Winslet gives her enough credibility for her responses and actions to be taken seriously. One of the most dangerous character moments - as a result of limp writing - is when Rose tries to deflect Jack's inquiry into her feelings for Cal. Brushing off the subject with a line like `This is not a suitable conversation' reads as too blatant an attempt at being evasive and, thus, loses the subtlety of, what should have been, the conveyance of a woman's knowing self-deception, her fear of confronting it and the consequences of that confrontation, and hence her choice to linger in her tortured comfort zone of delusion. However, Winslet brings across her insecurity and veiled vulnerability well. It's an example of why it is largely because of her that we invest ourselves emotionally in Rose's story, which, ultimately, is the spine of `Titanic' - it is the main narrative. Of course, there are supporting performances that contribute fruitfully to the telling of her story, and when actors like Kathy Bates, Gloria Stuart (who gets the most contemplative and well-written lines), Bernard Hill, Victor Garber and Billy Zane add touches of pathos, spunk, torment or sheer malevolence, that is no harmful thing.

Even as he succumbs at times to indulgence (if he'd left the car out, the portrait-sketching alone would have become one of the most original love scenes ever), Cameron's occasional knack for nuance helps the movie along as well. Sometimes he effects it through his actors, for instance Cal carelessly, brusquely and rudely slamming Rose's music box shut before introducing the Heart of the Ocean, his misperceived key to her heart. Other times he does it with James Horner's wonderful score. Notably, Rose's suicide scene is graced by a simple piece of music that strikes gently yet unflinchingly at the core of her plight. As she clambers over the rear of the ship, we hear Sissel hauntingly singing a poignant lament for Rose. Setting this scene to that piece of music is an example of sheer observance and sensitivity, as, with so many contemporary movies choosing to depict suicide as an act of angst or rashness, or even a bargaining tool to make a point, it becomes so easy for audiences to forget the fundamental sadness of the act.

While some of the material filmed was appalling (read: Deleted scenes, again), focussed editing saves the day and, in the end, keeps it all about Rose. The photography is quite remarkable, capturing the spectacle of the maiden voyage of Titanic, the terrible image of her demise, and, most importantly, the intimacy of character moments (this DVD, in particular, sees a restoration of the film to a quality virtually unmatched by any other, in this reviewer's opinion, making for a deeply satisfying visual experience).

Gripes galore but one might say that this movie redeems itself in the way Wolfgang Petersen's epic `Troy' does, and more successfully at that: Dramatic intelligence. Cameron knows his way about bringing an audience through a great course of emotion, which in no small part is attributable to his ability to entertain. His writing might have been improved, but it's clear enough that he never intended to sacrifice characterisation for mere technical wizardry. And, as much as we want to deny it, there is a palpable, compelling love for the work done here from Cameron at the helm. Perhaps that's why for a movie with its share of inexcusable flaws, it's had the luck to be received by an audience so forgiving.",1134691200,10,6355,5.046666666666667

But that one can go now!!!

Since I am from Germany I had the choice between the 2-discs Special Edition and a 4-disc Deluxe Edition, which I bought. And I was very pleased to say the least. The Movie itself was much clearer in picture and sound quality having been spread out on two discs. I don't mind changing discs in between, while it was shown in theater here there always was a 10-minute-break. As for the Extras, they are great and very informative for those interested in the history behind it and what went on Behind-the-scenes. The only disappointing element was that the 3-Hour Making Of got cancelled by James Cameron.

129910,4,0792151712,"The first two discs of this new edition show the film itself so that the best sound and resolution are possible; indeed, the presentation is likely to be definitive, at least until another edition is issued next year. For those inclined to watch this three-hour movie four more times, there are four commentary tracks by filmmakers discussing their input. A fifth commentary and other features on a third disc leave no aspect of this film unremarked. Clarity of sound and picture, together with the extras explaining how it was made, makes this ""Titanic"" the one to own. So throw away your other two editions if you can't wait for the fourth transfer next year.

James Cameron has spared nothing to bring us his take on history's greatest maritime tragedy. What happened that night is full of incidents of heroism, sacrifice, cowardice and hubris, all true, involving legendary New York financial and society figures, on the grandest of scales. A black-and-white feature film of a BBC television account, based on Walter Lord's book, movingly tapped that potential in ""A Night to Remember."" Cameron's big-budget version using modern movie magic, even a replica of the giant ship itself, was highly anticipated, hugely lucrative and received numerous awards.

Alas, the true drama of this disaster, and the people it tested, are ignored by Cameron, who wrote, produced and directed. ""Titanic"" focuses on a romance between an uppity poor boy (Leonardo DiCaprio) and unhappy rich girl (Kate Winslet), her snobbish mother, and the society cad (Billy Zane) she wants for her daughter. This tired cliche, told in flashback, dawdles for two hours until the vessel scrapes an iceberg because its lookouts were watching the young couple neck. While fate transfixes the ship and its doomed passengers, we must watch the cad chase the lovers, shooting at them as the waters rise.

Still, there is likeable work from DiCaprio and Winslet (she got the Oscar nod he should have had.) Kathy Bates is a natural ""unsinkable"" Molly Brown and Victor Garber is touchingly bewildered as the ship architect. Sinking the unsinkable is partly CGI rendered in harrowing detail. Insights into real and compelling incident and character disappear behind a trite love story, trivializing the 1,500 souls who drowned. Our heroine (nicely played in the present by Oscar nominee Gloria Stuart) has grown old clutching a diamond pendant. Why she drops it in the deep only Davy Jones knows.",1133654400,,2457,5.091811414392059
129911,5,0792151712,"On April 14, 1912, the RMS Titanic hit an iceberg in the North Atlantic Sea. The ship, that had been declared ""unsinkable"" went down within two and a half hours taking the lives of 1,500 passengers and crewman. Since that fateful night,the fascinating story of this tragedy has been retold over and over again in both print and film. The culmination of this came in 1997 with the release of the James Cameron's film, ""Titanic"". This epic movie won 11 Oscars and went on to become the highest grossing film of all time. Why was the movie so successful? Why does this film work so well? I think it is because Writer/Director, James Cameron chose to tell the story of Titanic's sinking in very human terms. He gets us to care about the majesty and beauty of the ship itself. Then he gets us involved in a fictional love story, that uses history as a backdrop. For those of you, who are the few individuals on the face of this Earth, who havn't seen the movie, the plot is fairly simple. In a flashback, a 101 year old, women (Gloria Stuart) recalls how as a upperclass, young lady named, Rose De Witt Bukater (Kate Winslet) she boarded the Titanic with her Fiance, Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) to be wedded in America. He is a wealthy and smug man, who seems to treat her more as a possesion then a love interest and is intent on reigning in her free spirited nature. Rose's mother, Ruth (Frances Fisher) has pushed her into this marriage, because they are in financial straits. Rose is so distraught of her future nuptials, that in a fit, she rushes to the stern of the ship to commit suicide. Luckily, she is saved by Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) a  young, poor, adventurous artist. The two make a connection and fall in love against the backdrop of history and that fateful night, that Titanic goes to the bottom of the sea. This movie is successful because it envelopes us whole into this opulent world of the past, where money, class & gender distinction mean everything. We watch as Rose emancipates herself from the formidable rules of this world. Finally, we see an incredibly meticulous, historically accurate, depiction of the Titanic disaster as it unfolds in very human terms. This is one of those rare times in which the big Hollywood budget actually helped instead of hindering the creativity and vision of a film maker and his movie. Usually a Director (and especially the Producers) become quite timid in making creative choices, when the budget climbs sky-high. Clearly there is nothing timid about this movie! The attention to authenticity and detail is just amazing! James Cameron truely was ""the King of the World"", when it came to creating the world of ""Titanic"". Everything just comes together from the casting, the wonderful performances, the script, authentic period costumes, amazing sets and special effects (that are truely special without overwhelming the story) and even James Horner's unforgettable, musical score. Movies work best, when they transport us to another world that not only entertains us, but says something about the human condition. I think the film ""Titanic"" works on all these levels. In the past the movie has been released to the public on a bare bones DVD. I think most of the film's legion of fans felt this was pretty shabby treatment for an 'Academy Award' winning film. The movie just seems to cry out for extras and the box set treatment. Well, with the release of the 3-DVD ""Titanic"" (Special Collectors Edition), the past injustices have certainly been rectified. This is quite possibly one of the best DVD box sets, I have ever seen. The film has lovingly been remastered in both picture and sound. It is Nirvana for both ""Titanic"" fans and movie buffs in-general, who are just interested in a detailed analysis of how major motion pictures are made. The set offers 3 different commentaries (Cameron's is the best of the lot) plus over 45 minutes worth of deleted scenes (with there own commentaries). It also includes full length documetaries plus a large number of short ""pod"" documentaries on the dives to the real Titanic and the making of the film. Finally, a whole host of publicity materials used for promoting & marketing the movie are included. This truely is the best in DVD treatments and extras. It's a wonderful movie and great DVD box set!

129912,5,0792151712,"Sorry, this is going to be long.

James Cameron is such a talented writer and director, Titanic is definitely one of his finest films.

This is the only film that can get me to cry and i mean tears gushing down my face and even 8 years later, there are still scenes that get me. Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet are the main stars in this picture as fictional characters Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukater. In my opinion, the strongest character is the older Rose played by Gloria Stuart, she is such a wonderful actress, and even though only being seen in a few scenes, she is amazing.

Others are Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, she doesn't exactly look like the actual Molly Brown but she fits the personality well in this movie and i really couldn't picture anyone else in that role. Billy Zane who plays another fictional character Caledon Hockley. Frances Fisher as Ruth DeWitt Bukater is another fine actress in this movie, and is also a fictional character. Bernard Hill is wonderful as the captain and is a great actor. Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews is great. That's all i'm going to say about the cast because the list goes on forever.

The movie tries to mix history with fiction, with sinking of Titanic and a love story with Rose and Jack, which works rather well, because they are able to introduce us to the real names on that ship. The plot starts off with basically treasure hunters (that's what i call them)lead by Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) looking for a Diamond which was named The Heart Of The Ocean, after failing in their attempts, they find a drawn picture that has a women wearing the diamond, and it just so happens that later that day, that woman calls them (ironic isn't it). They quickly fly her over to their ship and she eventually tells them her story on Titanic. In her story, she is set to marry a man named Caledon but is doesn't want to. To make a long story short, she meets Jack Dawson in her attempt to commit suicide and he stops her, and everything goes from there.

Visual Effects are amazing in this film, especially shots of the ship. I'm still amazed that they built that ship, that is truly amazing.

The music in this movie, is probably the best music i've ever heard in the history of the movie business, the scores in this movie are wonderful. Usually i don't buy soundtracks but i bought this one right on the day it was available.

The ship sinking is amazingly done. Very emotional to watch, because we have to remember, this actually happened. The moment I started to cry during the sinking was when the glass dome over the staircase broke, the combination of the music and seeing all those people getting hit by that water just made me cry. The tears just kept on coming after that.

The ending to this movie, is also great. Gloria Stuart in the last few scenes is great, even though she does play a fictional character, in the end you feel like she was a real character, which made the ending so good. The very last scene when she dies (i guess she dies or it's a dream, not sure) and she goes back to Titanic, and we see the wreck evolve into its original form is an amazing shot and seeing all the characters in that one shot was very well done.

Overall, a Classic, i know some people didn't like the Jack and Rose story but i liked and this movie will remain one of the all-time greats. 200 million dollars to make, 600 million in domestic box-office and 1.2 billion in international box-office. Overall, 1.8 billion. Like the movie or not, you have admit that is impressive

DVD extras are the reason why i bought this. The Commentary by James Cameron was the reason why i bought this.

Out of a 3 hour movie, i really didn't think there were going to be that many deleted scenes, i couldn't believe there were over 20. Seeing the making of this film is amazing. I still find it hard to believe the recreated that entire ship, that is amazing, and seeing them build it, made it even more unbelievable.

The DVD extras overall, are totally worth watching.",1133049600,4,4015,4.455040871934605

Not only is this a masterpiece filled with visual storytelling and state of the art special effects but the story is of such consequence at the turn of this century, that it became an instant classic. What a compelling tale of the largest ship ever  to sink to the depths of the cold North Atlantic Ocean taking hundreds of precious lives in the process, mainly because of the senselessness of intelligent men risking everything to prove their prowess and their superiority. For what?

Everything that went into this film makes it truly a classic.  A simple rich-pauper young love story that grabbed hearts. The marvel of being on this great vessel and sailing with it again. The opulence, the characters, the color, the fun of it all.  Yes, we all experience the thrill and the excitement of the moments. Watching the events that lead up to that eventful brush with the iceberg. The spectacle, the horror and the loss of seeing it all die. We are left heart broken and we love it.
Then there was the song, so tenderly sung by French Canadian songbird Celine Dion. You bet we fell for it.

The single vision of writer/director James Cameron was determined to craft this epic, no matter what the cost. Reputedly $250 million US dollars. I remember a week before the film was to open, all the critics, media moguls and so many people in the entertainment industry knew, yes knew, that this was going to be the greatest flop in film history. So much so that the horrors of ""Heavens Gate"", the film that sunk the studio (United Artists), were revived. Titanic was a story everyone knew, everyone died, disaster films had had their fling and were no longer successful, and James Cameron was massively over budget to the point of the studios demanding back his salary. This film was a looser from the start. But the public prove them all wrong.

IT IS NOT!!!!!!!!!!

I just purchased it at Best buy, and spot-checked it tonight.

I AM HORRIFIED!!!!!

This is a VHS style crappy ultra-letterboxed transfer to DVD.  Believe you me, I have an expensive 16x9 widescreen TV I bought just to watch anamorphic DVD's since I can't get High Def from my cable company.

When I watch an anamorphic DVD, it looks almost as good as high def.  I am a film editor and post production supervisor in Burbank Ca., and know what I'm talking about.

TITANIC has ultra-letterboxing and is presented FLAT.  On a wide-screen TV you have to press the zoom button twice to fill the screen, resulting in about a 30 % enlargement of the NTSC frame to get rid of the letterboxing.

THIS RELEASE OF TITANIC IS A TITANIC RIP-OFF TO THE PUBLIC, AND  I WILL NOT REST UNTIL I CAN GET A FULL AND REASONABLE EXPLAINATION FROM ALL PARTIES INVOLVED.

I've already posted to Mr. Cameron on IMDB this evening, and tomorrow, Nov 21, I'm calling my contacts at Ascent Media in Burbank where the transfer (and the encoding?) was done to get some answers.  I'll report back here and the IMDB.

I had heard and/or read about many of the scenes as well as the alternate ending, and had often wondered how they played out on the screen.

While I can see why some of the scenes were cut for time (the scene with Jack & Rose being chased by Cal's gun-toting valet was a bit too long!), some of the scenes definitely should have stayed in the movie, as it fills in the blanks of some questionable scenes (now we know why Rose's hair was up at dinner, yet down when she threatened to jump or who the girl was hanging on the back of the ship next to Rose when Titanic sank - it's Fabrezo's girlfriend Helga!).

I was a bit disappointed that you are unable to view the entire movie with all of the deleted scenes.  Instead of having the movie split onto two discs (this gives the best possible sound/picture, although I honestly didn't see that much of a difference), I would rather have seen the original theatrical release on one disc, with an extended version on the second disc, which included all of the deleted scenes.  Maybe this will be a possible release further down the road.

I also like how you are given the option of viewing the behind-the-scene features ""branched"" out from the movie, although it does make viewing the entire movie from beginning to end rather long!

Many people have commented here that they were disappointed that the US was only being given a 3-disc collection, while 4-disc sets were made available overseas.  I too was disappointed about this, until I learned that many of the features from the 4th overseas disc could be found within hidden ""easter eggs"" on the US version!

That's right!  The US collection includes the ""30 Second Recreation with Bunnies"" (which is hilarious!), the SNL skit with Bill Paxton, James Cameron, Cheri Oteri, etc., and the MTV skit with Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller & James Cameron.  These features can be found on the 3rd disc (the one with all the deleted scenes). Here's where to look:

30 SECONDS WITH BUNNIES - go to the SPECIAL FEATURES section, then to the STILL GALLERIES, click on the PRODUCTION ARTWORK and highlight SELECT ALL, press the UP arrow and an arrow in the background will light up, press ENTER.

SNL SKIT - Go to the DELETED SCENES selection, go to CHAPTER 29, Highlight the picture of the scene that is shown, then quickly press the RIGHT arrow AND down ARROW (on your remote) and you will see the picture of the couple on the screen get highlighted - press ENTER.

MTV skit w/Ben Stiller & Vince Vaughn - go to the MARKETING section, highlight and click on the newpapers in the lower right-hand corner of the screen (you can also hit ""5"" on your remote & ENTER)

129918,3,0792151712,"""Titanic"" is one of those movies that I dig up from the bottom of my VHS collection once or twice a year and always enjoy watching it. However, my enjoyment is always disturbed by some annoyingly unrealistic details towards the end of the movie:

- Rose never seems to get cold although she is wearing nothing but a flimsy gauze evening gown. And you never see people's breath until the very end, when Rose is floating in the water on a piece of debris. Come on, we're in the middle of the Atlantic in the middle of the night. Isn't it cold outside?

- The Rose-saves-Jack-from-the-Master-at-Arms'-room scene:
I'm sorry, but nobody could be so totally unaffected by ice-cold saltwater, especially a spoiled, indoor type of high-society girl like Rose - adrenaline rush or not. And all this after Jack's vivid description of the effects of ice cold water in the beginning of the movie.
I find the whole scene unnecessary, anyway. People are trying to escape from the sinking ship, they're running for their lives, fighting to get on the lifeboats - isn't that enough drama? Why do we need an act of female heroism here? It's your typical American action movie scene: somebody must rescue somebody else in a limited amount of time and, of course, succeeds. How predictable! Did anyone really think the director would kill Jack or Rose - or both - at his point? Bah!",1132012800,4,1363,4.698744769874477
129969,1,0792151712,"Bought this and 8 hours later read about the 4 disk set to be released on Nov 30.  Kind of rediculous to make 3 different collectors editions isn't it.  The 4 disk set has the trailers, the heart of the ocean documentary, and 3 parodies not in the 3 disk set.  Nevertheless, eventually there's going to be a HDTV edition which is going to blow these DVD sets away.

Watching the deleted scenes initially can be gutwrenching.  They're all the stupid parts of the original script.  After getting back into the state of mind you were in in 1998, they become more bearable, providing the extra bit of Titanic immersion you could never achieve in 1998.  There are some nice special effects shots dropped from the movie.

In 1997, it was a real dissapointment to discover this movie never really happened but was made on a movie set in Mexico.  It was so realistic and convincing you thought it must have been made in an actual ship at sea.  The DVDs assure us that although it was a Mexican movie studio, what you saw were complete replicas of Titanic's rooms with enclosed cielings and walls, and the same building materials used on the original ship, much closer to reality than traditional movie sets.  Furthermore, some of the scenes were really shot on the open ocean.  That assuaged a lot of the grief.",1131235200,7,1303,4.568965517241379

129971,4,0792151712,"I just bought and watched Titanic again (Twice) once with actor commentary, I have to say that the special edition is worthy for DVD collectors.

Of the deleted scenes I found only two enjoyable. One where Rose has a mental breakdown in her suite, where she trashes it and breaks things before running out on deck to where she would meet Jack for the first time. The second where Molly Brown is at the dinner table and asks a waiter for some ice as she holds up an empty glass. (You see the iceberg drift past the windows behind her)

Though the extended and alternate endings were a treat as well. Such as Old Rose letting Brock 'hold' the Heart of the Ocean in his palm just before she chucks it over her shoulder into the water.

The movie is just as enjoyable though every time you see it.

Of the commentary, its interesting in that Kate Winslet came up with the idea to spit in Cal's face as Jack had taught Rose to spit, as it was written in the script that she stabs Cal with a hair pin. Cameron praised Kate on this idea.",1131062400,5,1030,4.239795918367347

I'm not going to review the extras.  Too many have already done that.

Instead, I'm going to point out a few things people either haven't discussed or have made mistakes when discussing.

1.  The film is spread over 2 discs because it has 3 commentary tracks, a pod branching option, 5 separate sound/language tracks and 3 subtitles.  Try fitting all that with a 3:15 film on one DVD.  Just try.  Give Cameron a break, here.

2.  The 3-disc version DOES contain the parodies--they're on Easter Eggs, OK?  Hunt around.  Or read the Easter Egg review on Amazon.  Thanks for the tip, BTW.

3.  There is a video artifact on Disc 1 at about 1:19:19.  It apparently is on ALL the DVD's out there.  No word if Paramount will exchange discs.  If you didn't know, you'd be hard pressed to see it, but once you do, it is noticeable.

129973,5,0792151712,"I have noticed that many of these reviews have criticized the Titanic for being an overdramatic, cliche piece only designed to please teenage girls. You say that the only reason this film went over so well at the box office was because of the scores of ridiculous 14-year-old girls who went 10 times to see it so they could drool over Leonardo Dicaprio, and cried only for his death. I suppose you will have to call me a silly girl too, then, because if I had had the opportunity to view it 10 times over in the theater, I most definetely would have. But it certainly would not have been because of Leonardo Dicaprio.

I suppose I am a foolish girl. I cried during this movie, which I never do, but I began crying far before Jack's death. You all seem to have a terrible opinion of teenage girls, to think that every single one of us only notices death when it is that of a hot male. And perhaps you are in some cases right; many of us are quite shallow. But do you really think that the movie was made so that no one cared about the other deaths? And you call us shallow. Didn't you see them? Didn't you see the captain as his room was being flooded, or the nameless man and woman in their bed as the water welled around them? Didn't you see Jack's companion before part of the ship crashed down onto him? Didn't you see the woman who was lulling her two children to sleep so they wouldn't be afraid when death came? Didn't you see? Are you that stupid? Are you that blind? How could you not care about them? The movie makes you cry for utter strangers that don't even exist. The movie was that amazing.

129975,5,0792151712,"If you are a Titanic fan, you must have this DVD set.  Order it, and then clear your schedule for a weekend because you won't be leaving the house for a while.  Here are some of the highlights:

The cast and crew commentary is certainly varied, with producers Jon Landau and Rae Sanchini commenting throughout and then Kate Winslet, Gloria Stuart, various supporting characters and even extras and stunt people chiming in with behind the scenes stories.  Interesting to find out about the scene where Jack and Rose are taking their first daylight walk on the deck and Jack confronts Rose by asking her if she loves Cal.  That wasn't in the original script and was only added at the insistence of Kate and Leo that there be something more than hearts and flowers in the Jack - Rose relationship.

The historical commentary with Don Lynch & Ken Marschall was fun.  Cal and Rose may be arguing on screen - but Don and Ken are talking about the historically accurate White Start Line ashtrays on the dresser.  Of course, sometimes we are back on a set they've already dissected, so they are reduced to watching the movie and saying things like ""I love that line!"", just like any fan.

Motor-mouth James Cameron gets his own directors track where he tries to give background on every shot: ""This is on the set, and then now we cut to models with CGI water; now this is back on the set with green screen and now we're in the tank with models and the boats in the background are CGI, and now we're...""  It may be more than most can take for the length of this movie.  Still, Jim actually gives more historical background that Don and Ken - he obviously knows his stuff and is very passionate.

Breaking New Ground - The Making Of Titanic Tv Special  is a good behind the scenes feature, particularly for people who want some of the backstage story but won't be taking the time to get into the commentaries and ""pods"" where much of this is explored in even more detail.  Titanic Crew Video is a hoot - one of the AD's took home video footage of the shoot and then edited it together with some of the movie scenes (along with a few shots from Poseidon Adventure and other old films) for comic effect.  Low brow - but funny.  (I particularly liked the shot of Titanic pulling out of the harbor with a big ""Sink Me"" Post-It digitally slapped on to the stern.)

Then, of course, there's always The Movie:

I realize that there are a lot of people who disagree about this - but I think Titanic is an incredible screenplay.  Yes, some of the dialog is inane, and yes, Cal does everything but twirl his moustache (if he had one).  But screenplays are not built on dialog.  (Case in point - Star Wars.  Some of the worst dialog ever written - but still a compelling and entertaining movie.)  Screenplays are about structure and visual storytelling.  And it's here that Titanic excels.

The first problem in writing a screenplay of the Titanic story is this: how do you get beyond the tragic numbers (1500 people dead) make people care about these long forgotten people? Enter Rose, Cal, and Jack - a cross-class love triangle.  Their story will show the audience the ship as well as the social structure of the day.  (And you can't understand Titanic without grasping the social underpinnings.)

The second issue the screenwriter has to overcome is the Apollo 13 problem: everyone already knows how the tale ends. Enter Brock and his modern-day crew.  What I love about the opening of Titanic is that you are expecting to see this 1912 story with Kate and Leo, but for the first 20 minutes you are firmly in the present.  This tells the audience that, like Brock the treasure hunter, they don't know this story the way they think they do.  They need Rose to take them back to Titanic and paint the triumph and tragedy of the great ship.

The film is visually audacious - the angles are dramatic and unimaginable.  Where previous Titanic movies have shot scenes tightly to disguise the fact that the real ship isn't there - Cameron boldly goes for big helicopter views. Even the close shots have deep detailed backgrounds.

Finally, the themes of the film acted out by the characters, are the drawn from the lessons of Titanic as well.  Rose begins the story corseted into a beautiful, but narrow existence with limited possibilities.  She leaves all that behind in the North Atlantic, and embarks on a life with no security - but unlimited possibilities.  On a larger scale, Titanic was that beautiful but strictly controlled society.  But, passengers and crew found out that you can't control everything, and the grand world broke apart and sank into chaos.  Two years after these events, The Great War would scuttle most of the upper classes of Europe and kill or wound 30 million more.  At the same time the rights of workers, women, and minorities were ascendant, so that today it is hard to imagine living under the Edwardian social conventions.  Titanic foreshadowed the violent demise of the old order.  We can roll our eyes at their arrogance, but we also can't help but be a little nostalgic for the lovely world they created.

This exquisite DVD set will be treasured by anyone who wants to immerse themselves in the craft of the actors and technicians, or in the great ship itself.",1130803200,14,5276,4.6038543897216275

129977,2,0792151712,"Three discs and only three hours of special features... TWO OF THE DISCS ARE THE MOVIES WITH ABOUT 10 MINUTES OF EXTRA FEATURES! So basically you're buying a 2-disc DVD spread out on 3-discs, hell, there are so little special features (HALF OF THE ""THREE HOURS"" ARE DELETED SCENES) this could be on one disc of the film wasn't so long. Titanic is a good movie, although cheesy at times I don't wonder why it grossed $1.8 billion, but the special features on here just aren't worth it. This DVD should've came out 7 years ago as a 2-disc edition and this year should've came with a 4-disc edition with hours upon hours of special features.

What special features do we have here? About 6 hours of deleted scens that were deleted for a reason (I especially hate the first one where Cal says Picasso won't amount to anything; haha, get it? Picasso won't amount to anything but now he's perhaps the most famous artist right up there with DaVinci? Haha!). The alternate ending is painful, but that's merely a drop in the bucket compared to My Heart Will Go On music video. The only special feature really worth it is that Fox Marketing video, all the other ""special features"" are about 2 minutes, especially when they could be 20 minutes and very interesting. The ""Titanic Ship Tour"" for example is amazing but could have been better. The special features just aren't worth it unless you love deleted scenes. At least when Peter Jackson made the film spread out on 2 discs, HE PUT 2 EXTRA DISCS FOR SPECIAL FEATURES! And his movie (Return of the King) wasn't half as big as Titanic! What a waste.

This movie tied the 1950 classic, All About Eve, starring Anne Baxter and Betty Davis, for 14 Academy Awards nominations; tying Ben Hur with the receiving of 11 Academy Awards let alone. The movie in itself would deserve a five star rating, and while the first DVD release of the movie was basically of only the film alone, this 3-disc Collecter's Edition still does not live up to expectations nor the respect it deserves.

The digitally transferring of the film itself does appear to be of a higher quality than previously seen. The bonus features serve the movie well in accompaniment, while giving away most, if not all, the secrets of how the movie and special effects were put into play. However, some of the bonus features' qualities are not at all satisfying. For example, Celine Dion's music video to the film seems like an old analog playback of a VHS tape in the VCR recording a TV show with bad rabbit-ear reception. The sound is not as superior as the film either and for a song and video as such, the fan deserves to receive better than what's put together in this box set.

When I first knew of the movie I thought to myself, ok theres been other Titanic movies, but seriously, being released in the time it was with or new use of special effects, I knew it would be an amazing visual movie to watch, especially with action director James Cameron behind the helm. Impressive movie, the epic scale and visuals blow me away, honestly the love story could have been stronger though.

I enjoy Leo in a number of films, but James Cameron is not known for his romance portrayed on film, but the huge epic sets, action, intensity, sound and suspense put into his work like Aliens, The Abyss, True Lies, Terminater 1 and 2.

Titanic is the best movie about Titanic you'll ever see, mostly for action wise. I saw an older version and the boat in that sank really fast and looked kinda funny. I just knew it would be done right this time, and oh man was it, especially the smoke pipe falling down and the boat breaking in half.

130035,5,0792151712,"There's many instances of this happening: film/cd/tv show gets released, people rave about it, people check it out and call it overrated. I always think that people do this because either it was too hyped or they just hate it because it's popular. So is the case with Titanic and in some cases they're right. Love story needs work as it takes awhile for anything to happen then whoosh, some of the most intense and gripping action filmed. Back in the era of theatrical trailers and production notes listed as the only special feature, we finally get the tricked out version.

You pretty much know the story. In fact, there's not enough here to warrant a paragraph as it's simply this: old Rose tells present day treasure hunters who are looking for an incredibly rare and valuable diamond the story of when she actually wore the thing on Titanic the night it sank. This also ties into what is essentially her soulmate, third class free spirit Jack. This of course happens right before Titanic meets the iceberg.

Now, I will agree: the love story needed some more re-writes. It's a bit trite and some scenes should've been cut. But then the ship hits the iceberg and holy **** this film's great. The sound design and the production literally gave me goosebumps, especially certain scenes. Not to mention that the main theme(not the ""ooh's"" that you here during the main title and a key moment at the end), it's actually the ""aah's"" at the end when it does a big long shot. It starts when we see a picture of Rose riding a horse. It's so incredibly haunting yet beautiful at the same time.

The bonus features are quite nice but part of me wants more stuff. There's very little featurettes on the digital effects, only miniature shots or what they call ship extensions where they add to the set they had to make it match the real ship's length. There's a feature on the first 2 discs called pods which are kind of like the white rabbit featurettes on the Matrix disc or the Web-i-sodes on the Spiderman discs. There's an incredibly handy play all feature so you don't have to watch the film to access the pods. On disc 2 is the alternate ending which plays fine as a scene but doesn't fit(I'm not a director and even I think so). It does have a hilarious line by Lewis though.

On disc 3 we have the other featurettes such as video diary. A big feature is 29(!) deleted scenes, a lot of them exercised for good reason. The fight between Jack and Lovejoy(briefly seen in the trailers) is good but would've broke the film's pace. I have to jump back to the first 2 discs but James Cameron's commentary is a must-listen: it's informative on all fronts such as what a shot entailed, ad-libs and accidents and even some historical knowledge(and he also either agrees or shoots down things people had issues with such as Rose giving the finger or the infamous ""I'm the king of the world!"".

I don't know where he's going next after this. He's apparently working on an adaptation of the anime Battle Angel Alita so I'm looking for to that but as his last film from 8 years ago, this is a keeper.

People went to see the movie, not once or twice or even three times, but a half a dozen or more. Theaters were packed to the gills on all screenings and the movie ceased being just a movie and became a phenomenon. Titanic mania was everywhere, from books to the soundtrack which spent an amazing 18 weeks at number and you couldn't turn on a radio and not hear Celine Dion's omnipresent ""My Heart Will Go On"". Leonardo DiCaprio became a teen idol and Kate Winslet became a star. Oh yeah, James Cameron made pretty enjoyable and good film. Known for his use of special effects, Titanic boasts some stunning visuals. The detailed recreation of the doomed ship is stunning. The sinking of the ship is terrifying and breathtaking. Amid all these effects is a classic Hollywood love story. Mr. DiCaprio's Jack is a rogue who wins his way into the third class steerage section in a card game while Ms. Winslet's Rose is from a family of means and travels in the first class section with her money hungry mother (played by Francis Fisher) and her loathsome fiance Cal (played with an evil sneer by Billy Zane). Jack and Rose meet on deck and quickly fall in love. They are meant for another, but their love is doomed from the start. The tragic ending to their relationship will leave you misty-eyed. While the movie definitely pulls on your heartstrings, the two leads are so believable and charming you can't help but be drawn in.

130084,5,0792151712,"It's 1996 and James Cameron's new film is in trouble. Facing titanic production set backs, on set disasters (such as food laced with PCP fed to the production crew by a disgruntled employee), Cameron's film which is relying on state-of-the-art digital effects to bring the epic story to life keeps edging over budget and running behind. The film surprisingly wins an Academy Award for Best Picture among a slew of other awards, faces a critical drubbing in the press and manages to become one of the highest grossing films of all time. When ""Titanic"" was first announced the two studios releasing the film 20th Century Fox and Paramount both knew that they had a monumental project that might make bucket loads of money. They also knew given Cameron's reputation as a perfectionist it wasn't going to be an easy shoot. Still with an appealing cast, epic story chronicling the sinking of the unsinkable luxury liner R.M.S. Titanic in 1912 it seemed worth the gamble. ""Titanic"" may have been the most expensive movie ever made up to that time (rumor varies as to the final cost of the film and Fox has been mum on the final cost) but it also became the blockbuster of the year. While this isn't quite the definitive edition fans were hoping for, it's about as close as were likely to get until the film shows up on the HD DVD format or Blu-Ray.
***
Told in flashback ""Titanic"" begins by chronicling the attempt of treasure hunter Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) trying to find the wreckage of the luxury liner. On board at the time was the stunning Hope diamond a priceless piece of jewelry that has been missing since the ship went down. As Lovett's salvage operation is televised he's contacted by a woman named Rose (Gloria Stuart) who claims to be a survivor of the disaster and also to know the whereabouts of the strand of jewelry the diamond was set in. Skeptical at first, Rose tells Brock and his crew about the journey and her shipboard romance with starving artist Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). The itinerant Dawson wins two tickets on the luxury liner in a card game and looks forward to returning to America after years abroad. When Dawson meets socialite Rose De Witt Bukater (Kate Winslet) his world and hers is turned upside down when they fall in love on the voyage. There are two problems; the first is Rose's wealthy fianc&eacute; Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) a man ruthless, egotistic man that will resort to violence to get what he wants and the fate of the luxury liner itself. When it was launched from England the unique design of the Titanic made it appear unsinkable but when the ship hits an iceberg that rips through the hold of the ship the travelers are in for a horrifying ordeal.

One of the most popular DVD releases back in 1998, ""Titanic"" has been in need of refurbishing for some time now. Paramount has pulled out all the stops for this release when it comes to the transfer of the film to DVD. Released for the first time in anamorphic widescreen, receives a magnificent transfer here spreading the movie over two discs allowing for as much breathing space for the video and audio as possible. The image quality is exceptional with strong, bright colors and flesh tones that are accurate. The contrast is exceptional and although there is grain noticeable in the image that's to be expected since the original film itself demonstrated grain in its theatrical run. Remember, this was shot before the launch of HD video for movies. While there are some minor issues with edge enhancement they aren't noticeable on most screens and are not a distraction even on when viewed on a 61 inch widescreen TV. ""Titanic"" provides a visually stunning picture with a state-of-the-art transfer. While I thought this was only on my disc, it appears that there is an endocing flaw that makes a small portion of Di Caprio's face dissolve into pixelated bits on all the first pressings of this DVD.

""Titanic"" also offers a wide range of audio options as well. There's an excellent Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo soundtrack as well as an exceptional Dolby Digital 5.1 EX and stunning DTS 6.1 ES soundtrack. While the DTS soundtrack sounds slightly fuller and less clipped than the 5.1 EX soundtrack, they are very, very close in terms of quality. Keep in mind that you won't experience the full wonder of these mixes until the last section of the movie when the disaster occurs. While the format is used well in the early part of the movie most of the effects are limited to ambient sound until the disaster occurs.

Although most of the extras are confined to the third disc there are also quite a few interesting extras on disc 1 and 2 which primarily focus on the movie itself. First, there's an interactive behind-the-scenes option that allows you to view footage from the production of the film. Most of these segments run about a minute or two and you're returned to where you were in the film after they conclude. You can also view these bits separately as well. An alternate ending for the film is provided on the second disc. As Cameron points out in his commentary track (it can be viewed without his comments as well) for the ""alternate ending"" it's not that at all-it's the ORIGINAL ending for the film. When Cameron was writing the script his focus was to tie together all the strands of the film much as a novelist would but, in the end, he went back and reshot the ending when he realized that it said and showed things that didn't need to be said and shown.  We also get the music video for Celine Dion's treacly radio favorite ""My Heart Goes On"".

Disc 3 features the bulk of the extra material here and while it isn't quite as extensive as the 4 disc set being released in Europe, there's a vast amount of material here. We get a number of featurettes including ""A Time Lapse Creation of the `Titanic' Set"" with a commentary by Ed Marsh. It's fascinating to watch because even if you have been in film production the scope of the sets build is staggering.  Marsh also created a faux 1912 newsreel for the launch of the Titanic and that's included intact and, again, features commentary from Marsh. ""Titanic Crew Video"" features the actors and crew appearing in what's more or less a gag reel for the movie. Cameron provides commentary on the ""Deep Dive"" that he did in 1995 for the footage of the real Titanic. It's eerie and fascinating and Cameron's comments are pretty interesting as well. Cameron justified the shoot to Fox by pointing out that to do it in miniature would cost more and the publicity would be worth millions. We get a ""Ship Tour"" which Anders Falk narrates. The footage was put together for the ""Titanic Historical Society Convention"" done on the Queen Mary. It's as close as we'll ever discover what it felt light to walk through the actual Titanic. ""Visual Effects"" provides a breakdown of the shot in the engine room using both miniatures and full scale parts. ""I'm Flying"" demonstrates how the visual effects were done for the sequence where Rose is at the front of the ship with Jack looking over the water from the edge of the boat. It includes all the individual elements used to make up the sequence including real footage, large scale miniature and digital effects along with the full scale footage shot on a green screen stage. We get to see how the final sequence was put together as well. It's a marvelous example of how the visual effects created the illusion we see in the final footage. ""First Class Lounge"" was a section of the ship that was flooded. A miniature of the first class lounge was created and shot compositing elements of a green screen shot so that it looked as if the actual stage had been flooded. It's a brilliant and seamless optical. Finally ""Titanic Sinking Simulation"" takes us through the the various stages of completed CGI that were combined to give the sinking sequence its powerful impact.

""Stills Gallery"" includes the ""Titanic Scriptment"" which allows you to read Cameron's script. ""Storyboard Sequences"" is designed so you can view the entire gallery or individual sections which include everything from the ""Southampton Departure"" sequence to the ""Final Sinking Sequence"" from the film and includes nine sequences in total. ""Production Artwork"" includes production paintings by Tom Lay, costume design art by David Le Vey and ""Wreck Sketches"" done by James Cameron. ""Photographs"" covers the deep dive that Cameron did as well as photos from the model shop and even includes the extras' scrapbook with photos of the extras during production as well as behind-the-scenes photos of the sets. There are over 200 photos included in this section. ""Ken Marschall's Painting Gallery"" features material that Marschall completed for ""Titanic: An Illustrated History"" which was done in collaboration with writer Don Lynch. The book provided inspiration for Cameron throughout the writing and research process. These wonderfully detailed collection of 82 paintings clearly inspired Cameron's attention to detail in the film. Finally there's a text section that discusses the international performance of ""Titanic"" in terms of local currency and how that translates to the US gross of the film. There's even a 72 page bibliography referencing the material that Cameron used to do research and that came out as tie-ins with the movie.

The extensive deleted scenes section includes 29 scenes with Cameron's commentary. The scenes include finished visual effects and music to allow viewers to see how the sequences might have looked if they might have been finished. Cameron chose not to reintegrate them into the film. It's pretty clear why the scenes weren't put into the movie but many still have value and will be appreciated by fans of the movie. The scenes have a ""handle"", i.e., the sequence that preceded the cut sequence and followed it.

""Marketing"" includes the ""Fox Special: Breaking New Ground"" which was produced as a promotional tie in to the movie. We also get the press kit featurettes which were originally included as part of the Electronic Press Kit (EPK). We also get a 62 page gallery of concept artwork for the posters considered for the film as well as the final ones used to promote the movie. There's also an Easter egg featuring Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn (much thinner and much younger) as two dim movie executives suggesting that Cameron do a sequel. I believe this played on the ""MTV Movie Awards"". It's a very funny sequence and can be accessed by clicking down to the main menu and then clicking right.

Cameron's comments cover everything the performances to production trivia and even a bit of history as well including a short discourse on women's rights. Cameron discusses the real vs. reel aspects of the story. Interestingly, Cameron comments that in the sequence where they launch the lifeboats they (meeting the actors and crew) had to figure out how they launched the real ones they were so different from what we have today. The lifeboats included in the film were manufactured by the same company that manufactured the original lifeboats for the R.M.S. Titanic. Packed with trivia and detail, Cameron's commentary track is one of the richest on the disc even though he does his solo. The passengers thought that the lifeboats and life preservers were all part of an elaborate exercise or drill based on Cameron's research. Likewise, he points out that the only person beyond the crew that would know what happened was Thomas Andrews (Victor Garber) who heroically stayed behind on the sinking ship as well as trying to organize and get people off the ship. Surprisingly, carrying a concealed fire arm was not that uncommon. There were a lot of bodies that were discovered with guns on them. Cameron also points out that no one wanted to get off the ship into the boats because the band was still playing and everyone still thought that perhaps it was a drill.

The cast and production crew provide a second audio track. Whenever the speaker changes there is a title telling you who is speaking. Covering everything from the actor's preparation for the film (from reading books about the incident to talking with historians) to production details (producer Jon Landau provides a unique perspective since he is both a producer and a director), it's equally as fascinating as Cameron's track or the one done by the historians. While there is some duplication (how can there not be?) most of the commentary tracks have enough new information to keep each one interesting on its own. Having three commentary tracks might seem like overkill but, well, this is a James Cameron film and Cameron is known for exhaustive detail in both his research and his production of his films.

The third audio commentary track features historians discussing the accuracy of the film and the world in 1912. It's amazing how accurate Cameron's film is. The historians point out that misinformation was rampant and stewards told people to go to bed because the ship probably just dropped a propeller blade.  Cameron was worried that the davits that lowered the lifeboats might break during the sequences when they lowered them. The concept of a major sea rescue at the time was unthinkable. If a ship went down, it was thought that most people would die if another ship was too far away to rescue them immediately. Far from the usual dry historical commentaries, it's a wonderfully articulate track.

Although it's missing theatrical trailers, this is a pretty comprehensive boxed set for ""Titanic"". It's filled with wonderful behind-the-scenes footage, photos, production art, featurettes and commentary tracks. The two disc presentation of the movie has better clarity, remarkable detail and color when compared to the previous single disc edition of the movie. This is one that you'll definitely want if you're a fan of the movie.",1130198400,15,13829,4.836924376848331
130085,3,0792151712,"The highest grossing movie of all time, James Cameron's Titanic follows the love story of Jack and Rose set on the doomed 1912 maiden voyage of the Titanic.  It is a real tear-jerker and very moving on many levels.  However, anyone who takes love-life advice from this movie is in for big trouble.

In the movie, Rose is supposedly ""redeemed"" by Jack--he not only saved her life but also freed her from a tyrannical mother and fiance (her father is dead) and enabled her through a brief love affair to go on to lead a fulfilling and whole life, riding horses and flying airplanes.

Sorry to burst the bubble, but this rarely happens in real life.  Father-absent girls aren't helped to live a full life through the temporary attention of a sporadic nomad figure like Jack.  What is needed is the consistent love of a father figure to give a sense of worthiness and security to face the world (cf. Bowlby).  In the real world, Rose's love affair with Jack would not have helped her escape her bad situation.  She would probably have been too insecure to leave her situation and would have come crawling back.  Otherwise she would have escaped to 1912 America and most likely fallen into a life of poverty, e.g. prostitution.  And let's get real--if Jack had survived, do you think he would have given up his responsibility-free artist life to feed babies?  I doubt it.

James Cameron also tries to make Jack into a pseudo-Christ figure, presumably to take the place of a dead father/God.  But the same argument holds here: a vagabond come-and-go lover can't take the place of a loving Daddy/God to take care of you and give you the strength to overcome tyranny.",1130198400,,1659,4.65979381443299
130086,4,0792151712,"I just pre-ordered the 3 disk set. My only gripe is I hate the movie itself being split into two disks. Yes, I know the quality will be better, but movies split into two annoy the hell out of me. Anytime I sit down to watch Pearl Harbor, Seven or A Time To Kill (for example) my enjoyment is ruined by having to get up and put the other disk in to continue the movie or flipping the disk to see the other half of the movie. I know movie length and quality is why this is done, but really how much quality do you need? If you have a good dvd player the quality is most likely there.

You may wonder why I am getting this DVD set then. My major reasons is EXTRAS! For one I love commentaries and this set will offer three of them up. Commentaries give good insight, humor and let you get a feel for those involved in making the movie. I like that James Cameron has a commentary (loved his commentaries on Aliens, Terminator and T2 Ultimate Edition). The Director commentaries are usually good if the director is not boring. Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart should give insight into the character of Rose. Two historians commentary should give us actual facts to hear what most-likely took place in reality.

I have the original DVD release of Titanic and it is everything that is wrong with DVD releases for me, for one it is a bare-bones DVD release with only the trailer. Now for the movie itself I might stick to the original DVD release, but when I want to hear the commentaries or see the extras I will throw on this new DVD release.

For those who wanted a documentary Titanic was probably not the movie for you. The romance is the drawing point to relate to what these people went through. I doubt if any of us can relate to being on a huge ship and have it sinking in freezing waters. Though the mystery of just what took place that night is still very compelling, the romantic aspect makes it very relatable to people today.

This is not a movie for most men, unless if you are a romantic (as I am) this will most likely not appeal to you. If you want action basically go to the part where the ship hits the iceberg and watch from there. Or just buy other James Cameron movies like Terminator, T2 or Aliens. Titanic is a very visual movie. It's strengths lie in beautiful scenery of the ship, ocean and sky. The score matches the breathtaking scenery. For comparison, if you like James Cameron's movie The Abyss you will probably like this, if not you most likely won't like Titanic.

I liked the movie. There were some slow aspects of it that could be called boring, and it was very much a chick-flick, but the romance is what gives the movie heart and emotion. It gives a lot of meat to the movie in that a lot of Hollywood movies sacrifice story to fit into the 90 minute or 2 hour time slots for most movies. While Titanic's story could be called simple it is done this way to make it relatable. Viewers should feel like they are almost on the ship themselves and given that panicky feeling when the ship is sinking just like all the passengers feel. Without the romance it would have been hard to relate to the people from that time. As long as the movie is, it doesn't seem that long if you like it. If you don't like the movie it will seem like it takes forever. So warning for those of you out there who don't like chick-flicks, stay away! For those of you who want reality about Titanic I recommend watching History or Discovery channels. For those of you who want to be entertained by a romance along with a some bits of reality Titanic should be the movie for you!",1130025600,6,3580,4.289940828402367

Did I like it?  Not really. At three hours long, I felt it could have been wrapped up more quickly instead of investing so much time into the improbable Winslet/De Caprio romance which clearly would not have happened back in those times.  The scenes which focussed on the sinking and the aftermath helped bring the movie back into credibility.

Why would an American film be released with FEWER discs than Latin America and Britain will get???

How can a historical fiction story of one of the most memorable disasters of all time be released in a ""special edition"" DVD with no documentary of the actual tragedy???  When I look at the extras that are on the 4th DVD, I really don't think we're missing much.  But what could Paramount have done with that 4th disc????  They could have had one disc about the making of the film, and another disc about the actual tragedy.  Now THAT would have been an awesome DVD presentation.  Paramount needs to take some lessons from a studio such as Warner Brothers who REALLY knows how to pull out all the stops when producing special editions of classic films.  Instead of purchasing a special effects extraveganza that is given mediocre treatment on DVD, why not spend your money on the 3-disc set of the Wizard of Oz from Warner Brothers???  Check out the list of features on that DVD set, and you'll see the treatment a TRUE classic film should receive.

130114,4,0792151712,"James Cameron's Titanic, the highest grossing movie of all time, follows the story of Jack and Rose set on the doomed 1912 maiden voyage of the Titanic.

Due to its craftsmanship on many levels, the movie attains a power rare among movies, reminiscent of the first installment of the Star Wars saga.

Though it is not unusual for movies to be based on audience-pleasing wish-fulfillment fantasy, in this case the fantasy is very illusory.  The movie shows how Rose is ""redeemed"" by Jack--freed from tyrannical mother and fiance (her father is dead) and enabled by her very brief love affair to lead a fulfilling and whole life.

It is clear from real life that a situation like this almost never happens.  Father-absent girls don't attain what they need for life through the temporary attention of a sporadic nomad figure like Jack but through the consistent love of a father figure to give them a sense of worthiness and security to face the world (cf.

Otherwise she would have escaped to 1912 America and most likely fallen into a life of poverty, e.g. prostitution.

As in Out of Africa, the male hero conveniently dies without having to take responsibility to love and care for a family (can you see Jack the nomad-artist feeding babies?  Ugh - some lover.).

If Cameron intended a layer of spiritual meaning here, that's also a fallacy: pseudo-redemption by Jack a dead Christ figure--rather than the love of a supportive Daddy/God--results in lostness.

130116,1,0792151712,"Directed by James Cameron. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, and Bill Paxton.

Titanic is a fictional love story about Rose (Winslet) and an `average joe' Jack (DiCaprio). Both meet on the infamous, unsinkable Titanc ship. Yeah, I just love these one-dimensional characters where the poor are the noble underdogs, and the rich are evil bastards.

Ahh, we all know about Titanic, probably the most overrated movie ever. James Cameron is a fine action and sci-fi director. I repeat, ACTION AND SCI-FI. When it comes to love stories, especially tearjerkers, he has no skill. Why? The man can't write...at all...he just sucks at it. Lets face it, Terminator 2 was an awesome action movie, but the dialogue is cringe-worthy at times. And what about the end of T2? It tried to be deep and heart wrenching, but it failed and came off as stupid. Keep in mind, I love T2. I've seen it more than any other movie, and it still continues to entertain (it's actually one of my favorites). But I won't pretend that it doesn't have any flaws, because it does. So anyway, you get the point. Cameron is a limited director, and shouldn't do anything besides action and sci-fi. Case in point, the dialogue for Titanic is bad too (there's too many embarrassing quotes to list). If anything, Titanic can give you some minor entertainment from it's laughable script.

Instead of focusing on the real tragedy at hand, we get an unnecessary, clich love story. Furthermore, I personally think the premise is ridiculously disrespectful. Taking a tragedy and turning it into a love story. WOW! What's next? 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, or better yet, The Crucifixion (yeah, I bet Jesus had a few ladies on the side. That dirty dog!)? Why is this wrong? Because they're basicially saying, ""Ok, lets focus on these two characters, and ignore the rest! As long as these two get out, it doesn't matter who else dies!"". Sure enough, I've seen this movie with different groups of people, and none of them cried (or even cared for that matter) when most of the passengers were killed, but once Leonardo froze to death, then here come the waterworks! I don't care if I spoiled the movie for those that haven't seen it (since you shouldn't watch it anyway). Yep, a pathetic tearjerker ending to make the easily amused women in the crowd cry. No wonder it won so many Oscars.

The acting here is pathetic. Leonardo DiCaprio was still in his teenage heartthrob phase, and didn't have an excellent director like Martin Scorsese to make him look good. As a result, his emotions seem terribly forced and unbelievable. Billy Zane is basicially the same, only twice as bad. It's quite embarrassing to watch, really (he should stick to cool movies like Tales From The Crypt: Demon Knight. That was a great horror movie, and his character was pretty funny).

Overall, I give Titanic * (that may be overrating it, actually). This was an insult to the viewer's intelligence, and nothing more than a dull storyline to fill out a 3 hour long borefest. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. No compelling storytelling, no brilliant acting, and no interesting dialogue. Nope, it's almost worthless in every way. Yeah, the boat looked good, but they had $200 million to work with, so you knew it would.

They originally announced a 2 disc set AND a 4 disc set, just like Fox did, then they changed their mind and decide to cut out the option, drop the 4th disc but charge the same. Well, they aren't getting my $$$, I am region-free and I'm buying the FOX UK version.

  Speaking of which, IF you do pick up a release from another region, be sure to call Paramount and TELL them why. Let them know why they're not getting your money.

130118,1,0792151712,"First of all may I address the hacks of Hollywood: CAN'T YOU PEOPLE SPELL ANY OTHER NAME BUT JACK??!!! Come on, it's the most overused name and it's in almost all the movies! I think there's a button on your word processors that spell ""Jack"" and all you have to do is press it and it will print it over and over in your script, kind of like the ""F"" word that you folks use in place of actual LANGUAGE!

It was bad enough that Cameron couldn't use as characters people who actuall LIVED; he had to go and invent the most BORING characters who ever ate up 16 hours of my time (well, it FELT like 16 hours!)

First of the casting! Leonardo DiCrapio looks like (and always will) an aging teen-ager. If Leo strained really, reeeeally hard, he might sprout a 5 hair mustache! He's just another of the aging boy types Hollywood is all agog about: Jude Law, Colin Farrell, Orlando Bloom and others. The only real adult male actor around today is Russell Crowe and he has totally karate chopped his career as brutally as he does hotel employees.

And Kate Winslet! Lord, in terrible need of an extreme makeover! Nose needs refining, body needs to drop 45 pounds at least! She looked more like the older girl next door than Leo's lover, or maybe like his sister which is incest and that's just eeeeewwwwww!! And the hair color on Winslet and her ""mother"" who bore absolute NO physical resemblance, but they tried to ""fool"" us by dousing both with Lady Clairol Un-natural Tangerine Red #45.

As for the excrutiatingly irritating ""love story"" that seemed to suck all the attention and lenghthen this stupid movie, listen up all you ditsy teen-age girls. Here's what really happened if Jack had lived:

Jack and Rose run away to New York to live by the sea... in a cardboard shack with a corrugated tin roof. Since Rose has STUPIDLY put love above security and Billy N.Zane's (well, that's the characters he plays!) millions of bucks, she's paying for it now.

She's had one kid, added another 60 pounds and has another Little Leo in the oven. New York summers are very HOT and humid,especially if you live in a hot tin box. Leo never comes home from the bar where he hangs with his mates because the big cow beats him up for not working to give her the rich life she almost had. Unfortunately there are no phones, so she can't call up Billy N.Zane and beg him to let her come back, but Billy's into appearances and doesn't want a fat broad on his arm who has un-natural orange hair and is breast-feeding!  But I think Billy mercifully drowned before he had to endure to the end of this dreadful flick. I don't know, don't remember, don't care.

So to make ends meet, Rose must scrounge aluminum cans so she and the little King Of The World won't starve. So much for Happily Ever After.

This is reality girls, so make this movie a lesson in life! Go for the money!

Now as for the title of this review, if I'd had a dollar for each time Rose was screaming Jack, I'd have paid this month's mortgage! And why was she, with the generous body fat, floating on the raft/door when the skinny meatless squirt was in the ice water? You'd think she'd have taken turns. I was hoping someone would just shove Leo into the water so she'd stop yelling ""Jack, Jack, Jack.....!""like yelling your name in your face will keep you from freezing.

And dropping the big jewell into the ocean??! WHAT? ARE YOU CRA-ZEEEEEE??!! Absolutely no way! You think Jack is down there alive thanking you?? No, put that baby in the bank for nine decades, draw interest, if you don't want the money, give it to the victims of Hurricane Katrina for God's sake! Sheesh, this movie just got dumber as it went along.

Anyway, my 2 cents and this could have been good if it had only stuck to what really happened. Maybe someday someone will make this story correctly.",1129161600,14,3816,4.451289398280802

130151,1,0792151712,"Scan down and read the review that starts with emailing Paramount.  That one is the most accurate.  This film is embarrassing to watch.  The script makes ""Valley of the Dolls"" look like "" All About Eve."" DeCaprio is doomed to disaster in his performance mainly because of the horrid writing. Winslet fares no better.  They are both fine actors but in an impossible situation here.  This tragic event that took place in 1912 deserved better treatment.  The success of the film clearly demonstrates the mentalitiy of the supporters of the movies today; empty headed morans!  Compare this film with the ""Titanic"" of 1951 starring Barbara Stanwyck and Clifton Webb, the days of great actors and intelligent script writing.  Also, the even more superior ""A Night to Remember"" is much more satisfying than this piece of JUNK! PS.  And to add insult to injury it tied with ""Ben-Hur in the record number of Oscars.  It was alot more difficult to win 11 academy awards in 1959.  There were much fewer categories.",1128556800,13,1003,4.841176470588235

I have listened to both sound formats along with lot of other people and I believe that almost everybody will say that DTS sound is the way to go. Dolby 5.1 is good but DTS is outstanding. I wish they re-release Titanic in ""Superbit"" version which is the ultimate crystal clear video with DTS sound.

130155,3,0792151712,"...but shallow and embarrassing as a love story.

In the book, ""Titanic and the Making of James Cameron"" by Paula Parisi, James Cameron pitches his massive Titanic project to superstar Leonardo DiCaprio and allows him to read his script.  DiCaprio expresses reservations about the story and ""bad"" dialogue, and Cameron assures him that they can work out those problems in rehearsal.  DiCaprio signs on...and then is disillusioned when Cameron rejects any developing of the script.

""I wrote it--there's nothing wrong with it!"" Cameron snaps.

Cameron is so certain that there's nothing wrong with his love story that, after the film is released, he demands that the L.A. Times fire its movie critic when he pans the lame love story.

But the love story is lame.  The characters are thin and brushed with very broad strokes.  In my memory of the movie, Billy Zane's dastardly character wears a long moustache and stovepipe hat like Snidely Whiplash.  And I prefered Cherie Oteri playing the old lady in the Saturday Night Live parody instead of Gloria Stuart--but, again, it had more to do with the script than the actor.

The whole class thing is beat to death (and handled better and much more succinctly in A NIGHT TO REMEMBER).

The chase through the sinking ship with gunplay is silly and detracts from the epic tragedy going on above deck.

But TITANIC is without a doubt a triumph of filmmaking and production design.  The wreck and sinking of the ship are sensational, and I will buy this new special edition just for those reasons.

And it took a forceful, dynamic filmmaker like James Cameron to pull this off.  He deserved the Oscar.

I just wish he would've collaborated with someone on the romantic parts of the story.",1127952000,5,1730,4.853242320819112

I only wish we were given the option to watch the full movie and the alternate ending like they did with ""Stigmata"".....We've all seen the documentaries of how the film was made so why double up?

I am only getting the 2 disc version only for the fact that it has DTS sound and now that I have my movie entertainment projector I can watch it on my wall in the living room large as life and not on a small TV screen which makes viewing this film intolerable",1127779200,2,676,4.24031007751938
130157,5,0792151712,"The directing and visual effects were superb!

As always, Leo was an ACE performer!  Was this just a romance drama or was there more to it?

I think this movie has a very real social economic factor that needs to be examined.  Out of 2200 passengers, over 1500 died of hypo-thermia when the Titanic sank.  The 700 saved were of high society.  The ""average Joe's"" were locked below deck if they weren't already on deck being held back at gun point by the ship security.

Not enough life boats for all because the Titanic wasn't supposed to sink?!  Was this a security over-sight?  Then, why any life boats?

If something like this happened today, would the outcome be any different?  Has America finally grown up in the 21st century or stayed the same with different players?

Two thumbs up if I may say so!!! Rock on Hollywood!",1127692800,,827,4.551020408163265

Excuse me, but YOU do not work for Paramount or Fox, and you have NO say into telling the people that work for both companies what they should and shouldn't do. Honestly, it's funny how so many people late their hate for this movie blind them by writing crap like this guy has! I do not care if people don't like the movie, we all have differing opinions and sure a lot of non-fans can justify what they dislike the film but just posting the crap this guy has is again, hilarous.

I would like to say to the person who said that the DVD will be the exact same thing as the standard edition is wrong. The 1998/1999 DVD does not contain a anamorphic enchancement and does not have very *high* quality audio, although it's quite good. In this DVD you will get an anamorphic enchancement and very high-quality audio with a lot extras as well. However if you have a region-free DVD player or a hacked one that can play a certain region or all and has the ability to change from NTSC and PAL or vice versa, buy the deluxe set.

Having ""suffered"" a mediocre vanilla (single) DVD release in 1999, the title has finally been given better treatment (better film-to-video transfer and extensive bonus materials) by Paramount Home Entertainment for Region 1 or regions using the NTSC video system and Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment (Other regions or regions using the PAL video system) before 2005 ends.

Paramount Home Entertainment will be releasing a single 3-disc Special Collector's Edition (SCE) for Region 1 (US) whilst Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment will be releasing 2 editions: 2-disc Special Edition (SE) and 4-disc Deluxe/Definitive Collector's Edition (DCE) for the international markets.

On Disc 1 & 2 of 2-disc SE (R2/R4), 3-disc SCE (R1) and 4-disc DCE (R2/R4)

The feature film Titanic (1997) will be split onto first 2 discs (as per LOTR Special Extended Edition sets) when the enhanced DVD edition is release during the months of Oct - Dec 05 worldwide due to the limitation of the DVD format.

For all editions of all regions, the feature film (HD transfer) is presented in 16 x 9 Anamorphic Widescreen (2.35 : 1) with the usual Dolby Digital Surround EX 5.1 soundtrack, there is also the DTS-ES 6.1 soundtrack included. Hopefully, the part of the feature film on the first disc ends on the appropriate scene for a short toilet/snack break.

The bonus materials included in the first 2 discs of the DVD set (Applicable for all regions) are listed as follows:

However, after all three hours is said and done, and the ship has finally sunk, I have never seen a love story's couple more committed and devoted to each other through absolute turmoil and tragedy.  I can remember seeing TITANIC (twice) when it was released in 1997, sighing, and thinking, ""Nobody will ever love me that much.""

Happy to say, when I met my wife, I proved myself wrong.

Hooray for me...I mean us.",1126137600,,623,4.6880733944954125

Now don't get me wrong, I am going to enjoy see what had to be cut, but to be able to watch the film as it was filmed would have been nicer, no??

130194,3,0792151712,"James Cameron's Titanic is a beautiful story with commendable acting and etraordinary special effects. I will not waste any time on the premise, since everyone is familiar with it, but let it suffice to say that Cameron's vision of the doomed voyage of the White Star Liner is accurate in every way, shape, and form.

  The sheer scale of this movie is absolutely breathtaking, and the story, if predictable, is beautiful. But beneath the superficial grandeur of the film is an underlying ugliness that, though subtle, takes so much away from an otherwise wonderful movie.

  So what are the problems with Titanic? First off is Rose. The story begins with her engaged to the arrogant Cal. She does not love him, and is marrying him only for his money. She is unfulfilled by life, and is a self absorbed spoiled aristocrat.

  After she attempts to commit suicide, she meets Jack, who stops her from jumping off the side of the boat. They go off together, and have a wondrous time. Rose, an engaged woman, is deceiving her fiance and goes off with another man. The following morning, Cal has the audacity to be angry with Rose! Who wouldn't be?

  Rose decides not to go on with the marriage. But to inform Cal, she has Jack, a man she has just met, to draw her naked with the diamond around her neck. She then leaves the picture along with a cruel note in Cal's safe.

  When the ship is sinking, Rose gets into a lifeboat coveted by hundreds of passangers, with Jack still on the ship. Then at the last moment, she jumps out of the boat onto the ship to find her true love. How romantic! In truth, she is responsible for one other passenger's death.

  There are so many other flaws in this movie that the film's positives cannot overcome them. A beautiful story, yes, but a movie ruined by immorality and deceit, all by the movie's heroes.",1125792000,,1841,4.544072948328267

130237,5,0792151712,"Titanic has always been one of my hidden favorit films, meaning, a film that i love very much, but being a 22 year old male, would never amit to my friends. Its because i studied the ship extensively as a child, and the film managed to capture historical fact and romance and blend them into a realistic story. Its always been one of those films id love to see a directors cut or extened version of, and because of that i outright refused to purchase the standard version dvd, because for such a huge epic film, with such a great director, there were no extra features what so ever. Im finally happy cameron and paramount got there act together and is putting out a 3 disc set. It should have been a 4 disc set like rumored, but, 3 discs is still 2 discs full of extra features (granted they don't cut the film in half like they had to do for the VHS version)

Im also glad we will have the branching option of the deleted scenes and making of included with the film. Its always nice to see deleted or extended scenes, but to see them were in the film they were cut from is always better, because one gets a better understanding of why it was cut,  be it for pacing, redundancy, or shere length. If it were up to me, all films put out on dvd would be required to have this feature, because like me, alot of film students can learn greatly from it

overall, this, and revenge of the sith are the two films i will do almost anything to have by the end of the year.",1125446400,10,1462,4.159010600706714

BEVERLY HILLS, CA (March 15, 2005) - The sweeping romance and

human drama of James Cameron's OSCAR-winning epic film TITANIC will be released worldwide as two new DVD editions this October, it was

announced today by Cameron together with Paramount Home Entertainment and Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment International. The TITANIC DVD will be available as both a 2-disc special edition and 4-disc collector's

edition, each filled with new bonus materials.

Beloved by film fans around the world, the new TITANIC DVD is a

must-have for every home movie collection. The two-disc special edition

will include a branching feature, enabling fans to view a wide

selection of never-before-seen footage. The four-disc collector's edition will

be the ultimate for film and DVD enthusiasts - containing numerous

deleted scenes, new in-depth documentaries that explore the odyssey of the making of the film and much more. TITANIC will be presented in a brand new high definition transfer, 16x9 anamorphic edition, with 6.1 Dolby Digital Audio offering the highest level of picture and sound quality on DVD.

James Cameron commented: ""The three year process of making

TITANIC seemed at times as arduous as the building of the original ship

itself. Until recently, I wasn't really ready to dive back into it all and

re-live the conflicts, disappointments, tough choices and, ultimately,

the film's crazy, unexpected success. This special edition is more

than just the hour or so of unseen footage we're including...we're taking

fans on an untold journey, one which could have ended just as

disastrously as Titanic's maiden voyage, and often seemed as if it would.""

""We're very excited about the definitive TITANIC DVD that is

certain to fulfill fans insatiable desire for the film,"" said Rob

Friedman, COO of Paramount Pictures and Vice Chairman of the Paramount Motion Picture Group. ""The wealth of material that the collector's edition

will have available is truly representative of the scope and depth of this

movie phenomenon and we believe it will drive audiences everywhere to

return to TITANIC.""

""When TITANIC debuted in theaters, the film captured the

attention of the world and has since become an unforgettable part of popular

culture,"" Jim Gianopulos, Chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, said.

""It is a privilege to once again be working with James Cameron and our

partners at Paramount to launch the next course of TITANIC'S journey.""

Honored at the 70th ANNUAL ACADEMY AWARDS in March 1998 with 11

OSCARS, including Best Picture and Best Director, the ever popular

TITANIC remains the top grossing film at the worldwide box office.

Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, TITANIC struck an

emotional chord with audiences worldwide who were drawn to the epic

romance as well as its exquisite craftsmanship and grand scope. The film's

now legendary box office - having spent more than 38 weeks in release,

including 15 consecutive weekends at the top of the US box office -

charted a course into industry record books with total receipts of more

than $1.8 billion - ($600.8 million US/$1.2 billion internationally).

TITANIC was also the best-selling VHS and the very first DVD ever to ship

over a million units upon its release in 1999.",1124236800,3,3502,5.105820105820106

Whether you love the film, or hate it, no one can deny that it is a well-made movie and was a definite benchmark in movie history. The scope and magnitude of this picture was unprecedented and to this day, there are very few films with such a high calibre as TITANIC.

This DVD is definitely worthy to carry the name TITANIC, with over 29 delted scences, 3 separate commentaries, an alternate ending, a documentary on making the visual effects, and an anamorphic video transfer with 5.1 Dolby Digital Audio.

130344,1,0792151712,"To this day, I will never understand why this film is what it is. It perplexes me to this day why this film is the most successful film in history, and boggles the mind even more that it did win Best Picture. That was hype at its worst. If ""Titanic"" hasn't been so successful at the box office, the award surely would have gone to either ""As Good As It Gets"" or ""Good Will Hunting"".

I'm not going to bore you with the details of the plot. I will say that ""Titanic"" is the most overrated movie in history. It's hard to believe that James Cameron, who directed such excellent movies as ""The Terminator"", ""The Abyss"", ""T2"" and ""True Lies"", made this film. Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't that great as an actor and was still a full blown teen idol. He has since improved (he was excellent as Howard Hughes in ""The Aviator""), but he isn't great here, nor is Kate Winslet. Kathy Bates was wasted in her role, a sad thing for such a fine actress. Bill Paxton could do better, and Billy Zane isn't too great, either. The film's heart and soul is Gloria Stuart, who deserved an award for brilliant performance.

I really cannot think of anything elese to say about this mess, but I'll just say that this film isn't as great as box office and awards all say.",1122422400,9,1243,4.353448275862069
130345,2,0792151712,"This movie is fairly descent but is definitely not worth best picture or the other millions of awards that it won. Oh, and the fact that a movie this lousy is the one that won the most money ever (over 1 billion dollars) is pathetic. If you look at the top grossing movies of all time and see stuff like this and home alone, well. Everyone loves this movie so much and thanks to girls who went to see it 10 times at the movie theathers, there you have it, over 1 billion dollars. Oh, and by the way, I had trouble sitting through one viewing, and I haven't seen it since 1997 at the theathers. Leonardo DeCaprio is a terrible actor, let's face it and Kate Winslet is nothing special. So, the wish that I had would have been that they would have rated it R for nudity, but no, they rated it PG-13 so everyone can see it. The movie isn't that bad, but it's so overated. Braveheart, the green mile, the shawnshank redemption, the hurricane, and movies like that should have won this amount of movie, and not a movie like this. On top of it, it's totally holywood and all the girls are like: ""Leonardo Decaprio's so hot!"" And then when he dies, they cry. And they're crying because h dies but they don't care about the other hundreds of people that died. Just him. And the portrait thing was stupid. On top of it, if you read a book about the actual event, you'll note how over 800 men died while slightly over 100 women and children died. Why? Becausr the men gave up the lifeboats for the women and children. But to make it holywood, the man have to be total a**** and try to steal the lifeboats from the women. Which rarely happen. So James Cameron doesn't care, he just wants to make money. And everyone in this movie is sad for Leonardo Decprio and no one else probably. It's pathetic that a movie like this won best picture.

The ship hits the iceberg, then magically sprouts wings and flies away? Of course it sinks...of course DiCaprio dies. In fact, that and Kate Winslet's artistic nudity are the only two things that make this drivel even remotely watchable.

Sure, everyone is entitled to their opinion but the folks criticizing this movie so vehemently usually have the attention span of a flea.  And if they did sit down long enough to watch the entire movie, they just don't get the history of it.

If Cameron had decided to make the movie strictly as a documentary, it would have been called ""boring.""  Since he attempted to make it interesting by centering the history of the disaster around a fictional love story, it's called ""trashy.""  No, you can't win any which way you look at it so you make the movie in a way that's going to make money - and Cameron's formula worked...and then some.

I liked this movie not because of the love story (and, yes, I'm one of those saps who can't help but cry as Rose lets Jack go after the ship has sunk and he disappears into the freezing darkness of the Atlantic) but because of the attention that was paid to the actual sinking.  It makes you think if some of what was shown did happen on that frosty night in April of 1912.  Had the action been cut off and the ship sunk in less than five minutes, the movie would have lost all credibility.

Two thumbs up for the historical accuracy.  The only bad things about this movie were that Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet were not nominated for Oscars for their performances.",1120003200,24,1436,4.40530303030303
130400,3,0792151712,"""Titanic"" belongs in that very special, very baffling category: bad movies you like anyway (some others are ""Dirty Dancing,"" ""Field of Dreams,"" ""Gone With the Wind""...you get the idea).

Trash, trash, trash: Cameron manages to render an historical event completely unbelievable - but absolutely fun.  Visually, the movie (NOT ""film""!) is gorgeous, the actors are gorgeous, the costumes are gorgeous, the sets are gorgeous - getting tired of my saying ""gorgeous""?  That's what ""Titanic"" is like: trite and unimaginative at its core, but a great rollicking ride all the same.

The danger of this kind of movie, I think, is that it PURPORTS to be a ""great"" work of cinema; it's HERALDED as such; it wins Academy Awards, for heaven's sake, as such - and so the audience is roped into believing the lie.  And, heartbreakingly, maybe forgets - or, worse, never realizes - what great cinema truly IS.

But grab the popcorn, never forget that this is fluff, accept it on that basis, set your brain to ""chill,"" surrender to a delicious soap-opera-cum-epic, and enjoy without guilt, because there really is plenty to enjoy - which is why ""Titanic"" is in my DVD cabinet next to the likes of ""Goodfellas,"" ""Jaws,"" ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""In America,"" ""The Wizard of Oz,"" and ""Taxi Driver.""**

And then go watch a GREAT film, just for balance (or to kick-start your brain again, if needed!).

130401,4,0792151712,"Titanic is a great movie, don't get me wrong. And there's nothing I wouldn't show to any kid above 12. There is a sex scene, but no nudity whatsoever and no gore. I think that, besides the aforementioned scene, the other thing that gave this movie a PG-13 rating was the intenseness of the movie. I definitely wouldn't let a 6-yr-old see this movie, because so many people die.
  But if you're older, you won't be freaked out so much as sad. I was sobbing when they showed the old couple and the little kids with their mom, examples of how many people (mostly third- and second-class) were trapped in the bottom decks. The adults gave up trying to find a way out and tucked their kids in to bed for the last time. It was really sad for me, although my mom didn't cry. That's just her.

Titanic has its pros and cons-let me show you:

PROS:
1. A GREAT story, phenomal premise, the whole grandmother/young Rose thing. Whoever came up with that deserves serious recognition. The beginning, in the present, is my third favorite part. (see #5 and #6)

2. The music was superb. I'd give the overall way the music ties in and works with the story 4-4 1/2 stars. Just great. I have to get that Celine Dion song.

3. Just two words which automatically give this movie at least 4 stars: Leonardo DiCaprio. :) He may not be the very best actor ever, but he's one of the cute ones!

4. The love story between Jack and Rose was well done. 3 out of four stars.

5. My second favorite part was the flying scene with Jack and Rose. And the music was, as I said, great.

6. And now, for the best scene in the movie: my very favorite scene was one of the last when old Rose is sleeping on the ship and suddenly she's young Rose again, ascending the grand staircase while everyone who died on the ship comes back to welcome her. She reaches the top and there's Jack, waiting to kiss her. I bawled my eyes out.
  ...Although, does that mean she died? Like when Jack said, ""You're going to die an old lady warm in your bed, Rose,""?
Whatever. Decide for yourself. The scene was still great.

7. The unsinkable Molly Brown-she was really cool.

CONS:

1. This movie is three hours long, I warn you. And there are some parts that just drag on and on. But the rest of the movie pretty much makes up for it.
  But other than that, I can't think of anything else that I disliked enough to deem it worthy of this review.

  So there you have it. I strongly suggest you watch this movie. It's usually on at least once a month on broadcast channels.

  I'm flying, Jack! I'm flying!",1119139200,,2552,4.2839248434238

Ugh.  It makes me ill just thinking about it.

Why would anyone even care what happens in this movie?  Its got a lame cast, a lame story, and you pretty much know how its going to end.

a.  People are complaining about how this movie did not have as much historical basis as it should have, how it was just a love story, etc.

Well, People must remeber that this is a MOVIE, not a DOCUMENTARY.  It's motive is to entertain, which is were the love story comes in.  One cannot look to it for fact alone.  This is just a movie, so stop over analizying it for goodness sake!

b.  People are complaining about the length.

Hello!!! This movie is so CAPTIVATING that lenght is not a promblem whatsoever!  If you sit down and really enjoy this film, the 3 hours will seem more like 3 min.

c.  People (okay, my parents) are complaining about the neverending Celion Deon (SP please?) song.

She has such a gorgeous voice-and the song was breath-taking.  I loved it.  It really adds an uplifting  feeling to the film.

d.  People are complaining about the actors in this film(mainly Leonardo DiCapreo)

I thought he was brilliant.  He played a funny, mischevious, handsome artist that opened Rose up and gave her a thing that her butthead fiancee couldn't-Hope.  He was perfect for this role.  I loved him in it and I was very proud of him in it-He really was Jack.

e.  It was full of cliches.

WARNING

1.  Bring tissues-this is such a sad movie.

2.  Don't take young kids.  A lot of my friends were 5 and 6 when they first saw this.  I don't think this movie is appropriate for small children.  It's not even the sex scene or Jack drawing Rose-it's just the whole concept of the movie-small kids won't understand it, and might lose a bit of their innocence from being shown such subjets at such an early age.(I do have to agree with a reader who wanted to known how it did get a PG-13 rating-repeatively I checked to make sure it wasn't really rated R-I've seen R movies with my parents that have much less in them then the Titanic!)",1117843200,3,2031,4.370967741935484

I thought that the romance between Rose (Kate Winslet)

and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) was a true story.

Because when the old lady was telling about the story that happened on the Titanic it looked like she was telling the truth. But now I'm 14 and I know that it's not true. I have seen the movie 10 times and I don't get bored. I liked how James Cameron made up the story. I really enjoyed it.  I really sob. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet did a good job too. One thing that makes me cry too is that to many people died in real life.

My favorite part was almost at the end. When Jack and Rose went to the front of the Titanic because they didn't want to fall to the water. This story was so romantic. I recommend this movie to teenagers because I liked the movie and I think that they are going to liked it too.",1117584000,2,930,4.082417582417582

It was very much undeserving of the numerous awards it won, and all the money that it made. If anyone is stupid enought to sweat a movie like it is the best thing that ever touched this earth when it is simply okay then that means there is something wrong with this world. (I was so happy when reading some editor's view in Parade Magazine that he thought it was embarrassing that it won 11 academy awards and that there are so many other movies out there that were good and better than this piece of garbage, but failed to get the attention that this nonsense got.)That DiCaprio guy is so overrated! That idiot is nothing. I don't know why I am the only one that thinks this. The movie was not all that touching, heart-breaking, and awesome like the media make it out to be. Please!

130408,3,0792151712,"There are a plethora of reviews here which concur with my sentiments, so I will refrain from expressing them in this review. I will say one thing, though: James Cameron's Oscar acceptance speech was the most ridiculous acceptance speech I have ever heard. Never mind the ""I'm the king of the world!"" nonsense. How about his moment of silence for those who perished on the Titanic? Perhaps Cameron felt obligated to acknowledge the dead since he was dramatizing their tragedy. Perhaps he was being sincere in his sympathies. I don't know. What I do know is that it was one of the most cringe-worthy moments in Academy history. But Cameron doesn't stop there. He simply cannot leave good-enough alone, so he continues to babble on incessantly as his already bulbous head continues to expand. Whereas most actors and filmmakers at least make an attempt to conceal their egotism, Cameron is unabashedly vainglorious, boldly forsaking the humility smokescreen that so many others in show business rely upon for refuge.",1115251200,8,1013,5.035714285714286
130463,5,0792151712,"I think this is an absolutely beautiful film, the cast are all fantastic, down to the smallest parts, the set is breathtaking, and the whole story is just brilliant. There are definitely a few alterations I would make, but I'll come to that later.

Storyline's quite simple, big ship, everyone boards it, poor people, middling people, sparkling rich, socialite people. Rich girl Rose falls for poor boy Jack, and vice versa even more so, BUT.... problem - Rose is engaged to mean and slimey Caledon Hockley. Everything is just getting steamy and romantic when, BIGO problemo, there are ice warnings.

This is, in my opinion, the beginning of the most exciting part. The acting of Jack and Rose is very good, but it is cheesy and not particularly believable. It's the REAL heroes who really make it, all the crew, captain, Mr Andrews etc. I mean, they were the proper heroes, weren't they? I was TOTALLY AND UTTERLY moved by 1st officer and 5th officers, their beautiful performances have me sobbing every single time. You actually feel like you are ON the boat in this movie.

There is nudity in this, Rose is drawn by Jack naked and they have sex in her fiancee's Renault. The emotional intensity of it is what makes it unsuitable for young children though. I first watched it when it first came out  here in England in late '97 when I was 6 and a half, and the people falling and the boat snapping and the officer shooting himself in the head were too much for me, and to be honest I think you really have to be at least 12 or 13 to appreciate this film fully.

Alterations - as I have said yeah I would include more of the crew, and perhaps make it even MORE emotional (if that's possible!), but then I'm a perfectionist sort of girl.

Once again, this is a beautiful movie. EVERYONE has to see it, it's just one of those films, like Mary Poppins or Ben Hur, that we ALL have to see, and if you're over 12 or so it is just the perfect film if you want a giggle, a good old howl, or a terrorised grip at the sofa.

 (Fare thee well Titanic goin' down)
 They said, boy get back to your hole, dis ship she don't haul no coal
 (Down to the bottom of the sea)""

The feminist power of this movie is that its greatness cannot be acknowledged and the *bien-pensant* dismisses it as Hollywood: but it is great Hollywood.

Much less than Sep 11,we haven't dealt with Titanic and the way the lower clawsses were trapped like rats. In fact, upon the release of Titanic, Chicago radio station WFMT, the last hope of the bien pensant, refused a number of phone in requests to play the above song about Jack Johnson's inability to get a ride on the doomed ship.

Because the song was by a white boy naming and narrating what was being done to his brother, it transgressed the unwritten rule as does the very thought that we might maintain social class boundaries up to the gates of hell.

The best films are always chick flicks.

UPDATE 5-17-2005

Wow, another Nolan Ryan: another perfect game: 0 of 4. The Jack Johnson and Titanic nexus still hath power to offend I see.

I am sure that the type of reader who like the reviewer above who ""predicted"" that old canoe was goin' down an hour into the film, and concluded from his lack of moron suspense that the scriptwriters were the morons: the type of reader who jest loved it when Leornard diCaprio died (bearing within himself that destructiveness which is constitutive of society): the type of reader whose critique of Cameron's acceptance speech was informed by the sour resentment of the born loser PUNCHED OUT at my phrase ""the feminist power"".

""The feminist power"" is lame. Nonetheless, Jim Cameron laughed his way to the bank because so many chicks dragged their boyfriends to this thing, and after the film, on Grand Avenue in Chicago, a lady sung to me the song she'd learned in Bible school about how it were a shame how that ship went down to de bottom of the sea.

Yeah, I wondered too why Kate Winslet didn't get hypothermia in the bowels of the sinking ship but I figure her extra layer of Rubeneque avoirdupois and love's heat made he oblivious to the water temperature. That, and the fact that the water in the ship was heated by the dying boilers and electrical cables.

The film offends because it was popular without being a shootemup and Billy Zane (who first emerged as Sam Neill's and Nicole Kidman's dark American foil in Dead Calm, an enjoyable example of an anti-American Australian film) may have been uncomfortable for the Yuppie a-hole segment of the audience. It offends because it teaches us what a waste it is to live a life in First Class.",1114560000,2,2644,4.6

130468,5,0792151712,"The 1997 Blockbuster Titanic went on to gross roughly 600 million in the U.S. and a totoal of 1.8 billion including worldwide. No film has ever rivaled the sheer greatness to this epic that also won 11 Oscars including Best Director and Best Picture. That is tied for the most all time with the 1959 film Ben Hur and 2003's Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.

As for the film, I personally feel it is one of the most enticing, emotional, and thrilling pictures of all time. The story immediatly begins with a ""treasure hunt"" down to the real Titanic, to which James Cameron actually filmed there and ended spending more time with the ship than the actual passengers. They find no diamond but a picture drawn the night the ship sank. a 101 year old Rose sees the picture and heads to the vessel to talk with the capitan. She ends up re-living the entire experince on Titanic form the day the ship sailed to the night it sank. The story of the real ship mixed with the modern day telling is very effective in the way in which it gives the viewer something to follow rather than just the sinking.

I saw the film twice in theaters and over 20 times at home and still never get sick of seeing the film. The DVD was released in 1999 and to my surprise came out in a letterbox format with only a trailer as the bonus feature. I have to admit I was very dis pleased with the way the DVD was handled. Titanic is a movie that took 3 years in the process and thre are no special features? The truth is , that is what makes Titanic such a great film. It breks genres from a mystery, to a drama, to a love story, and finally to a thrilling race for survival.

I've heard many comments that come up in conversation and on numerous web sites including this, that Titanic was a poor script. Most people who say this have never even attempted much less wrote a script. They simply don't understand how hard it is to write. I will be the first to admit that Cameron is not the best writer in Hollywood,but he is surely better than half. When first hearing of this film being released I was sort of surprised Cameron was going to write/direct/produce with previous film like ""The Terminator"", ""Aliens"", ""The Abyss"", and ""T2"". He simply pulled it off with flying colors and the true spectacle that is Titanic is that it is a collaberative process. It simply has the best visual effects ever in an epic. The shots of the ship sailing into the sunset, and when it's sinking/ snapping in half are pure technological achievments. The sets off the coast of Baja and the tank that sat in for the drowning people are all amazing.

The film was originally budgeted at 135 million dollars but went over 200 million. Paramount had to bring the extra 65 million because Fox could simply not afford it. It's amazing the movie ever got released. It went from July 1997 to December 19, 1997. The post-production went too long. To end the film on a high note the movies, sound, costumes, editing, effects, and the best musical score of all time make Titanic a movie for the ages. It will forever carry on as one of the best movies of all time.

FANS OF TITANIC. SPECIAL COLLECTORS EDITION DVD TO BE RELEASED IN OCTOBER 2005!

Cameron made the press conference quite some time ago in March. There will be two editions: A 2-Disc version with a new digital transfer of the film in anamorphic widescreen and a branching feature, this means an icon will pop up in the movie whenever a deleted scene will pop up and you can view it from there, but Cameron considers the theatrical release to be his Director's Cut. There will be 58 minutes of unseen footage, and all will be brought up to date. The deleted scens can also be viewed seperatly on the DVD. The scenes will be polished. There will also be commentary by Cameron and possibly Leo and Kate.

THE OTHER EDITION WILL BE A 4-DISC SET.

The first 2 discs wil be the same as the other edition but there will be 2-discs of bonus material. There won't just be a making of featurette but tons of them to deal with ALL aspects of the process from when the idea was first pitched to it's crazy success. There is going to be a Titanic load of Bonus features on EVERYTHING, with the making of to interviwe and everything. I get excited thinking about how Titanic is finally getting the treatment it deserves.

Let's face it, we all knew the ship was going to sink, right? Frankly, the only reason I paid good money to see the film in theaters (saw it 4 times plus dvd viewing) is because I have the utmost respect for director James Cameron, who brought us True Lies, Aliens, and The Terminator.

The film opens in modern day, with some scientists going down to the Titanic wreckage to find some treasure. They show the foul-mouthed scientists finding a drawing down there, then bringing in an ancient woman who the picture is of. The woman, of course, is Rose, a survivor of the legendary shipwreck. Then Rose proceeds to tell them of how the picture was drawn, and we are transported to the 1912 world of the greatest epic ever. Now, if the movie had opened where the flashback had opened, this would easily be the greatest film ever. However, the first thirty minutes showing modern day are spoiling, and it takes away a lot of the epic grandeur. If the film had closed with Rose arriving in new York in the pouring rain, then that would be perfect. But then, after the flashback is over, Cameron shows us the old woman dreaming and throwing jewels into the ocean..what?

I am glued once again to the smaller screen with James Cameron's ""Titanic.""  8 years later, and I kind of thought this then - The script is the weakest link in what is otherwise his greatest achievement.  The script in many places is too juvenile and too ""modern 1997.""  I doubt a young man in 1912 would be stating lines like ""You're stupid Rose. You're stupid!""

This was a major blockbuster; it received umpteen Oscars and bushels of accolades from the viewing public and some critics.  There's probably an equal number of negative reviews.  Either way the film was very much hyped.  I can't believe that extras wouldn't be included on the dvd.  The theatrical trailer and subtitles hardly count.  Where are the bloopers?  Where are the behind-the-scenes documentaries?  Where are the interviews with the cast and crew?  Where is a mini-documentary about the real Titanic - giving us a run down of the comparative dinner menus for first,second and third class passengers?  Okay, maybe that's asking too much.  After all, I did see just that at the Titanic exhibit at one of our city museums yesterday and I know there are lots of books and films about the real thing.

As for the film itself, I'll add my two cents to the thousand dollar bill.  Amazing special affects and great attention to period piece details.  Affecting portrayals by the actors who played the captain, the ship designer and Rose's mom.  And what's not to love about Kathy Bates? The extras and the stunt folks were good too.  Leo and Kate - well, it was the script that sank them.  I kinda liked their interaction in the beginning, but I could have done without Jack and Rose calling each others' names a thousand times within certain scenes, Jack and Rose spitting and the repulsive ""hand slap on the sweaty window"" scene.  This story could have been more of an ensemble piece.  After all, with 2200 souls on the real Titanic there were lots of interesting characterizations to be had.  And even sticking to the ever popular love triangle theme, the three could have been more than just types.  Why not flesh out the characters a bit, if only by making the fiance less mean, the princess less suicidal, and the orphaned poor artist less confident.

130670,4,0792151712,"I do like this movie and when it came out, I saw it 4 times in the theater.  I recently watched in on DVD and though still good, I liked it better on the big screen.  The shots of the ship: leaving port and sailing straight toward the camera, the 3 screws lifting out of the water when it was sinking, sailing towards the setting sun, standing near vertical, etc. just looked much better on the big screen.

As I see it, the movie was about ""Titanic"" itself.  Yes, there is a fictional love story between Jack and Rose and the all too familiar love triangle, but really the human characters are there to ""show off the ship"".  Bare with me a moment, and I'll try to make this statement clear.  Watch the movie without really focusing on the actual human characters (especially the ""fictional"" ones)...look past them and you will notice that the scenes occur all over the ship.  The main staircase, the dining hall, various locations of the deck, the bridge, numerous hallways, steerage, engine rooms, crow's deck, exercise room, baggage compartment, first class staterooms --- the ""fictional"" love-story exists to reveal the ship in all it's Grandness.  Also note, the fictional characters encounter many real characters -- Molly Brown, the Captain, Shipbuilder etc.  The viewers are given glimpses of these people and those are the ones we truly connect with -- atleast I did. Watching the captain's face the moment he KNOWS most of the people on board are going to die -- or the shipbuilder's face, then and when he's watching the clock .... you almost ache for their sorrow.  Or stop for a moment and try to imagine that YOU are one of the crewmembers on deck choosing who is to go and who is to stay behind and die -- how difficult would that be?  Could you do it?  The scene with the father telling the daughters to stay with their mother, that ""he"" would be getting onto another boat, the elderly couple holding each other in their beds while the water fills their stateroom, the woman trying to get her children to relax and sleep....the captain standing alone at the helm just before the water rushes in --- THOSE are the moments of real emotional connections.  The ""fictional"" characters move through the ship and past the real characters to reveal ""their"" story (if you look for it), and that is why I really like this movie.

Now, the primary reason I think this is ""flawed"" is let us consider the ""narrator"" for a moment.  The Narrator is a 101 year old Rose retelling ""her"" story about being on Titanic.  It is supposed to be her ""Point of View"" (POV)  If that is true -- she would ONLY know what happens in her immediate area.  She would not ""know"" about Mr. Lovejoy hitting Jack in the stomach while handcuffed, she would not ""know"" of the owner speaking to the captain about increasing the speed, she would not ""know"" her mother, the countess and the third woman did not want to sit with Molly Brown, the entire Jack playing cards and winning his ticket and running / jumping onto the ship, finding his room, the dialogue between the captain and the radio operator --- etc --- any scene that Rose is not ""actually in"", she could not truly be telling to the present day men.  It is a ""flawed"" POV and once you notice that, they story itself does seem a bit flawed too (and I do apologize to anyone that now views the movie and notices ""this"" flaw) which is why I rated it only 4 stars.

Watch this movie.  Watch it, and look for the little stories that happen behind the ""romance"" and I think you'll ""get it"".  Yes, the line that Paxton says at the end is ""corny"", but in a way, it is true.

That doesn't take away from the fact that it's a good story and a good effects movie. Movies aren't based on truth all the time, so why is telling a story that is likely to not happen a farce? We all see movies that couldn't possbily be true, what we like to call ""Movie Magic"". One thing is completely wrong, you can fall in love at first sight. I know it's true because it has happened to me. An undying love that will last for as long as we are both alive. There's some great story to tell, they might as well make a movie out of it.

But Rose in 1912 is supposed to be only 17 and Jack is supposed to be 20.  For that reason they don't look good together.

I also liked the love story.  I thought it was totally convincing that a girl would meet a guy on a two day cruise and love him forever.

The end was also very satisfying dramatic tension.  I really was afraid Kate Winslet's character would die in the sinking of the boat despite the fact that an older version of herself is narrating the movie.",1104451200,14,529,4.634408602150538

130716,3,0792151712,"Although the last forty minutes of this film are a spectical of early CGI, minatures and blue-screen, the first two hours are salvaged only by the actors.

What set Cameron's earlier films, Abyss, Terminator i & 2 from standard popcorn fair was the brilliant realism of story telling and emphisis on characters and empathy, here he didn't even bother.

With a small towns worth of people on board the Titanic and a thousand true stories Cameron concocts a standard, tepid tale of rich-ass, poor lass and smart-ass love triangle which leads to peasent parting and borrowed-parked-car sex climaxing in a silly gun point chase.

So little of the true stories of these long dead souls are told here that the blatent specticle of boat sinking is like a slap in the face of those who died. As living beings you didn't matter, but as dying victims you deserve $200 million in special effects to rivet audiences.

Cameron fails miserably to bring us any closer to those who lost life needlessly, but instead tells us a borihly tripe tale revolving around three stereo-typed characters.

The sinking ship, nearly 3 hours on it's own, is reserved and condensed into the last hour of the film. Why? A rivitying story could have begun with the ship striking the iceberg and taken us through the last hours of the ship in horrifing real time.

Why reduce this to a soap opera with great special effects?",1103241600,3,1390,4.746887966804979

130718,2,0792151712,"Whether or not you choose to board this Titanic sinker, it's hard to feel that one more of 1750 Amazon reviews would make any conceivable difference.  Aficionados of Titanic would continue loving the film no matter what, while detractors would count it one of life's cardinal sins to catch the movie again.  A modern-day cultural phenomenon, perhaps only matched by Gone with the Wind in its appeal, this gigantic blockbuster has now earned over US$1 billion in box office worldwide.  And it's not difficult to see why, it has a bit of everything: disaster movie, romantic tearjerker, heart-quickening action and a bit of period flavor.

The story is simple and simplistic: rich girl meets poor boy (an artist) on a liner, who promises to liberate her from her evil and scheming fiance, while Titanic hits an iceberg and threatens to sink all.  With them are a motley crew of really smug upper-classers, some stoic fellows (including ensemble musicians) and Cameron's roving, know-it-all camera.

What irritates most about Titanic is the greed with which James Cameron confronts his materials: here is a director who wants a bit of every thing in his pie so the result is an overbloated long drawn-out romance/disaster movie/action epic which is exceptional in some departments but irritatingly infantile in others.  Never mind the cheesy script, with a cringingly moralistic message tacked out at the end (""life is worth living; someone loves you"").  If the mark of a true director is the perspicuity with which he deals with his material, I'm sorry Cameron fails this test.

What then, is left to say for this movie?  For the record, the sets are pleasantly authentic and so too are the costumes, so at least 2 of its Oscar statuettes are deserved, but it's difficult still not to see its US$200 million as extravagant overspending.  For acting, neither Kate Winslet nor Leonardo DiCapprio sets the world alight, but really it doesn't matter as they are relegated to types rather than psychologically intriguing personnels.  It's endurable as a piece of narrative.  The best parts of the film ironically are the action sequences which hark back to Cameron's progeny as an action director and the sinking of the ship, which is tantalisingly real.  But *someone* must have known Cameron stole a lot from the superior ""Night to Remember""? In the end, Jack's death will polarise audience, and I suspect I may not be the only one finding Celine Dion's never-ending theme ad naseum at the end.

130719,2,0792151712,"Set against the backdrop of the world's most famous sinking ship, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio take us on a voyage through possibly the most boring and predictable love triangle ever thought of outside of ""Pearl Harbor"". Billy Zane plays the other corner of this triangle as a total jerk (but he looks good!), and for a good portion of the movie, we see the development of this romance between Winslet the society girl and DiCaprio the street urchin with perfect teeth.  'Nuff said, we all know how these things go.

I keep wondering what the DiCaprio mystique is, because I am a woman, and a petite one at that, but when I look at this guy, I feel like a behemoth.  That is not a turn on. I am not into guys that look like they have yet to hit puberty, so I fail to understand his appeal, and were I a society girl that was out slummin', I couldn't imagine hooking up with DiCaprio. C'mon folks, weren't there any hot Irish guys on this doomed ship?

The best character in this movie was played by Kathy Bates, who can do no wrong, as ""The Unsinkable"" Molly Brown.

I fail to understand the appeal of this love story, but perhaps this is why I never watch the Lifetime Channel. This chick is not into chick flicks, and can count only a few among my favorite movies. This isn't one of them.

The best part of this movie is probably the last hour. The special effects are amazing as we watch the Titanic sink in perfect recreation of the real, horrifying event.  The third class passengers' horror at being left to die was disturbing in a good way, and the band playing on as the ship sank was haunting. Mercifully, and where I cheered, was when DiCaprio's face disappeared beneath the cold, Atlantic waters. Is it bad of me to say that? If it is, I don't care.

I would have given this movie three stars if I were rating cinematography, costume design, and special effects, but those three things do not make a good movie. They only make it pretty. And it was pretty. Winslet's gowns were stunning. As a history buff, seeing the disaster recreated so beautifully and accurately was a treat.

Truth be told, the acting is good, so that earned it one star at least. It's not the cast's fault that this movie is a yawner of a sap-fest when stripped of its pretties. The other star is an automatic because I sat through it, so it was at least compelling enough to watch once.

Why does Billy Zane's character shoot at our hero and heroine?  Hello, the ship is going down doofus.  And if she didn't jump back on the ship, her lover would have been able to climb up on the wood and survive...just an observation.

I think it speaks volumes when you see the impressive shot of all those frozen bodies in the Atlantic and not shed a tear.  I just thought, ""Cool VFX.""  A movie about this disaster should have brought out true emotions, not forced ones (see the much superior ""A Night to Remember.""

The love story has zero chemistry to boot.  I know that this is a popular flick, but I just did not get it.

130848,3,0792151712,"Is ""Titanic"" a marvelously crafted film?  You bet your life preserver it is.  It is hard to argue that the film did not deserve the Oscars it won for Visual Effects, Film Editing and Cinematography.  However, does the fact that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences went insane in 1997 (awarding 11 Oscars out of 14 nominations) make it a great film, or is it simply a bunch of eye candy wrapped around an unbelieveably cheesy love story?

Rich girl meets poor (but plucky) boy from the wrong side of the tracks and starts a romance doomed to failure.  My goodness, we surely have never seen this story before, now have we?  No amount of special effects, as magnificent as they may be, can conceal the cringe-worthy dialogue between Leo & Kate that the viewer is forced to endure.  The dialogue makes me think at times of those wretched, teen-angst-riddled WB dramas that currently infest the airwaves.  There are whole scenes that are almost unbearable to watch, the dialogue gets to be so poor.

Even the spectacular nature of the movie has waned a little bit in the intervening years.  Like many summer blockbuster flicks tht are largely propelled by their special effects, ""Titanic"" is one of those movies best seen on the big screen.  Once it is transferred to the more confined medium of a television screen --- even a big one --- the impact of the images on the screen tends to be lessened, and one is forced (sadly) to rely on the skill of the actors to maintain the interest of the viewers.  I don't think anyone is going to remember ""Titanic"" for its riveting performances.  Kate Winslet does an adequete job, but I think the Academy was being pretty generous in giving her a nomination for Best Actress.  Nothing against the old crone who played the billion-years-old Rose, but what in her performance really merited a nomination anyway?  As to the performances of the rest of the cast --- well, I think it says volumes that the Academy, while it was handing out nominations left and right, elected not to honor most of the principals with acting nominations.

This isn't a totally horrible film by any means --- at points it can be quite moving & touching.  There are times when the ship was near sinking, as one sees the various passengers coping with a death that is rapidly approaching, that one wishes the whole movie could be like this.  Unfortunately, James Cameron preferred to go the route of cheesy romance, and that results in an average movie at best.",1098403200,4,2482,4.6536697247706424
130849,4,0792151712,"This is much better than word of mouth led me to believe.  Of course the script is corny and full of simplistic sentiment and it panders shamelessly to mid-brow sensitivities, and there's no question that the main intent is to jerk mass tears (but we could have guessed that from the subject).  Still the cinematography is wonderful, Kate Winslet is captivating, and the plot clever.  This is an old time Hollywood movie made not only to seduce the audience, but the Academy as well.  And it succeeds.

Billy Zane is perfectly one-dimensional and completely familiar as the conceited and selfish, immoral heir to a Gilded Age fortune.  Kate Winslet as his intended is a ravishing beauty with oomph and a mind of her own.  Leonardo DiCaprio as the wily and clever sketch artist who seduces her while twice saving her life comes across curiously as part Huck Finn and part John Boy.  His romantic bravado in the freezing water, saying he was so lucky to have won the steamship ticket because it allowed him to meet her, was enough to embarrass even the most hardened Harlequin novelist.

Most of the action before the bow scene was almost painful because just about every line was written so that a ten-year-old could understand what he was supposed to feel about whom.  Evil, decadent rich people.  Good, clever, hard working poor people. (They even party better.)  Clich followed clich.  But the romantic bow scene was artfully staged, and after that Kate came to life.  It was strange to see her in the early scenes.  She seemed almost a bad actress, as though the mediocrity of the direction had reduced her.  But her part was so big and she had so much to do that her natural talent overcame the early junior high school text and the later schmaltz.

Since the audience knows the ending, Director James Cameron knew he had a fine opportunity for dramatic irony, but his touch was a bit heavy handed, e.g., as they're boarding, a guy says, ""We're the luckiest sons of b...s in the world.""  (Yeah, right.)  And since the audience knows eighty-five years of history unknown to the Titanic passengers, we get these further heavy bits of irony: On Picasso: ""He won't amount to a thing.  Trust me.""  And, ""Freud, who is he?  Is he a passenger?""  (Check the heads of the midbrow audience nodding knowingly.)

My sensitivities were most offended, however, when Cameron has the salvage crew smugly celebrate their good fortune before the safe they have hauled up is actually opened. That was the tip off for everybody in the audience to wisely know there would be little of value in the safe.  Duh.  In real life those guys don't celebrate until the gold is in the hand.  Cameron's style is to flatter the audience, make them think they're smart, the usual pandering of a mediocre talent.  Cameron even tries his hand at some cheap symbolism, i.e., mommie tells Rose that she must marry this suffocating and insufferable man because they need the money (as she vigorously tightens Rose's confining corset).

All right.  Why did the Academy vote this best picture?  Simply because it was a popular lavish production squarely in the Hollywood tradition, employing a whole bunch of movie folk, and it was a financial success, just what the industry craves.  I should add that everything technical in the film was excellent, and Cameron's dramatic direction was a lot better than his dialogue.  Also, because of the exquisite detail, watching the big ship sink was a whole lot of fun.",1098316800,2,3474,4.775167785234899

There were a lot of things that happened in this ship's short ""life"" which were omitted from the 2 and a half hour film. I won't say what, but that'll be enough explanation as to why I didn't give the movie 5 stars. The love story was very weak and could've been improved (which is why I'm writing a novel about it, with a more complex and involving story, combining everything-yes, every single detail about the ship into the novel). Leonardo DiCaprio, fresh off his role as Romeo in Baz Luhrman's f***ing piece of sh-- adaptation of ""Romeo And Juliet"" was just pathetic as Jack. Kate Winslet, fresh off playing Ophelia in Kenneth Branagh's masterful 3 and a half hour restoration of ""Hamlet"" (see the 1948 version starring, produced, text-edited [though uncredited] and directed by Sir Laurence Olivier, considered the finest Shakepearean actor of his time, first), was a little better as Rose. Billy Zane, fresh from playing the title role in ""The Phantom"", was very good as the ""villainous"" Caledon Hockley, Rose's fiance. He, Kathy Bates (as Margaret ""The Unsinkable Molly"" Brown, Jonathan Hyde (as J. Bruce Ismay), Victor Garber (as Thomas Andrews) and Bernard Hill (as Captain Edward John [E.J.] Smith) were the only actors who I thought were throughly convincing in this movie. The haunting love theme by Celine Dion, written in memory of her niece, ""My Heart Will Go On"" is very good and earned the Oscar for Best Song.

130853,5,0792151712,"This movie is a very wonderful and is a piece of movie with much intense and suspense scenes. The background scene of this movie especially on the Titanic(the scenery) is truly admirable. It is so beautiful and it's perfect to symbolize romance that this movie is focusing on.

Besides, it is an unbelievably touching story. The story line moves slowly and I could really understand the entire movie(the message and overall meaning that it brings) well. Generally, the messages that this movie brings are FREEDOM, HAPPIENESS and HOLD ON! The performence by the great actors such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are very amazing and they capture my attention to this movie. I can feel the presence of real feelings and romance in their characters throughout the movie. I mean it is not just falsely made. I would be happier if Jack Dawson(DiCaprio) didn't die in the movie. It could end with a better ending instead of the really sad one.

Other that that, I also like the soundtracks of this movie. The songs in this movie are so soothing and sweet(especially 'My Heart Will Go On'). So, in overall this movie is well-acted, got a beautiful story line(touching as well) and sweet soundtracks. It is PERFECT!. With all the great aspects in it, I have no idea who can reject this movie. Those who hasn't watch this movie should really go and watch it. It is a movie that not to be missed.

HE TRIED TO SHOOT HER!!! and although at certein times the affects did look fake, the whole movie was, scary, sad, thought provoking, moving and very well done! i particularly loved kates work in all this!

130868,5,0792151712,"There are few movies that in my opinion rival the emotional power of 1997's epic ""Titanic"" which is still one of the greatest movies ever made to this very day.

 In 1997 when a team of ocean divers send down a couple of deep-sea probes to scour the ocean floor, they recover a safe where they uncover a set of drawings of a young woman named Rose that was drawn back on April 14, 1912 but then they receive a call from a centenarian named Rose Dawson Calvert and she tells them that the drawing of the woman was herself done 84 years ago (At the time of the movie) Set on April 14, 1912 on the Titanic's maiden (and only) voyage, it is the tale of two young lovers one is an extremely wealthy young woman named Rose Bukater and a poor lower class young man named Jack Dawson.

 There are few movies that in my opinion rival the emotional impact that titanic had on me back when it was released in movie theatres on that cold December day in 1997. The sets on this movie are among the greatest I've ever seen. The titanic scenes, most of them at least, were in fact shot on a real replica of the ship.

 This movie could really have turned out to be another ""Heaven's Gate"" as feared, a movie that cost huge amounts to make and ultimately flopped, but instead and deservedly so ""Titanic"" ultimately went on to become the most successful box-office film in history with over 1.8 Billion dollars made from it's release and when it was retired from theatres. It's not hard to see why it was so. ""Titanic"" is arguably one of the greatest masterpieces ever made and only James Cameron's extremely powerful directing could've made it such a powerful, riveting, and emotional experience.

 Cameron is one of my all time favorite directors and his movies are among the greatest I've ever seen but I've got to give my hats off as ""Titanic"" is without a doubt his greatest achievement of all time and I highly recommend this today!",1095638400,5,1921,4.422096317280453

But this is also a movie about survival and in that guys will find it to be a very good movie.  The visuals of the ship and it going down are incredible, INCREDIBLE, some of the best visuals ever are in this movie, it is only surpassed by LOTR in that area.  Its quite long and could have been about a half an hour shorter, they could have taken out some of the scenes when people first get on the boat and some of the love scenes.

130925,3,0792151712,"Technically, the scene where they show the engine room, the giant gears, crankshafts, pistons, the precision of all these parts like the inside of an old antique watch. These were the money scenes to me. The way the CGI water rippled in the ship's wake, the mindboggling attention to every microscopic detail, all the way down to the period costumes, chairs, hairstyles, even the spoons was mesmerising indeed. Cameron has a way of milking every single shot to make sure it has that ""Cameron-look"" and that's what I like about his movies, they all have his fingerprints.

 That said, a lot of the dialogue was cliche and downright corny. Cameron's a perfectionist, sometimes to a fault which probably explains why he hasn't made anything new since then, save for the overhyped, and very stupid, GHOSTS OF THE ABYSS. The things that made Titanic attractive and eye candy, Cameron's precision and dedication to the little things, is what makes the weaknesses of the movie stand out. Some of DiCaprio's lines sound, well, mechanical, a little too rehearsed. And Kate Winslet's character seems a little too unrealistic. How could a society girl fall for a rat with slicked hair because he can draw good? And what would they have done if the boat hadn't sank? In the real world you have to have green to get a woman like that to even fart in your direction. I wouldn't have went through all that to ""tap"" some rich white booty, to take all those insults. What would any female find cute about seeing slob drooling out a guy's mouth? And lastly, why would Cal stay on a sinking boat to shoot a fat white girl taken by what most would today consider ""poor white trash?""

Here we got a Romeo and Juliet-story on-board the Titanic with a cliche-ridden dialogue-(""I can fly....."") prologue and epilogue... What Cameron really should have done - STORYWISE - was to let the ship and its passangers speak for themselves...
We are not unbeknownst 2 her story, so why mock us Mr Cameron??? As a fiction however; it is great - if on the trashy side. The authency  of the Titanic and production values are first rate.

130930,3,0792151712,"Three stars is the average of 1 star and 5 stars: 1 for the love story, 5 for the ship and its fate.
Like many reviewers I found the romance between Jack and Rose extremely unconvincing. DiCaprio is simply too young, too wimpy, and too uneducated for me to accept him as someone whom Rose would fall for so completely. I could see him as being a shipboard fling for the sophisticated Rose--and it would have been a good plot device if Hockley had complacently let his fiancee have a few days to toy with Jack and get him out of her system--but had the Titanic docked, my impression is that Rose would have tired of Jack pretty fast. The whole thing was cloying and silly.
But the Titanic was a good actor. The re-creation of the tragedy was very well done, and stuck very close to history as far as I can tell. Many of the secondary characters were interesting, especially poor Mr. Andrews, the ship designer. I think that a viewer would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by the scene where the musicians return and accompany their leader in ""Nearer My God to Thee"" while Captain Smith walks forlornly onto his flooded bridge to await the end. (And isn't it interesting how the music provided by I Salonisti, such as the Offenbach piece, is far superior to the sound-track music written for the film?) This was a moving and dramatic account of a great tragedy (interspersed by nonsense like Hockley's attempt to assassinate Jack with Lovejoy's pistol.)
So 3 stars for Titanic, a movie whose story shows that Truth is not only stranger than fiction, but often more interesting, too.",1088899200,6,1593,4.534722222222222
130971,4,0792151712,"First of all, this movie is an absolute masterpiece. I have no idea why there's been such a sudden backlash against it, people are just stupid. This is a glorious film, incredible production values, first class acting, dynamic special effects, breathtaking cinematography, wonderful story, outstanding music, everything about the film is just perfect. I can't find one fault in it. The way it depicts the human struggles of the characters, the arrogance of the ship's owners and passengers, the sheer proportions of the sinking, is nothing short of brilliance. You're involved with the characters and their struggles from beginning to end, it's incredible. One of the best movies ever made, period. Don't listen to those morons who call this film trash, they wouldn't know art if it came up and spat in their face. I'd give the film a very solid 10 out of 10.
Now for the DVD, dissapointing to say the least. You have all the regular DVD goodies (scene selection, language settings, flashy menu screens, etc.), but all you get by means of special features is the original theatrical trailer.

130972,2,0792151712,"The historical story of RMS Titanic is both tragic and fascinating; a testament of man's arrogance and of the consuming power of natural forces when juxtaposed with man's puny scientific achievements. Primarily the history of the Titanic is a tragedy. Not only from the standpoint that so many died but that the majority of those who died were poor.

Taken at face value, the history is so replete with human interest, with character and with raw story that a simple and accurate telling of the events that culminated in the Titanic tragedy would have made a more compelling, more interesting and more appropriate movie than what James Cameron brought to the screen as TITANIC.

Yes, this is definitely a disaster movie.  It might be more accurate to say that it is a disastrous movie.  And that's just the movie itself.  Never mind the disgusting insult to those that died.  They deserved something far more accurate and far better than this. Cameron irresponsibly and insultingly takes this marvelous and disturbing history, guts it and distills it down to nothing more than a pathetic, nudity-riddled chick flick complete with an unnecessary romance story and all of what goes with it. In the end this movie is so shallow that you couldn't sink a teacup in it, let alone the greatest ship ever built.

130978,4,0792151712,"James Cameron's ""Titanic"" became the first film in nearly 50 years to tie the record of 11 Oscars once held exclusively by Ben-Hur (1959); an irony not wasted upon the fact that most of ""Titanic's"" wins came from the technical categories - not the acting categories. There's good reason for that - the plot, such as it is, is contrived and poorly acted. In a nutshell, penniless artist, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) wins a third class ticket on the ill-fated liner. He meets Rose (Kate Winslet), a spoiled rich girl engaged to Cal (Billy Zane) but who is about to commit suicide by jumping off the ship's stern because she feels trapped in her pampered existence - oh, please! Jack and Rose become lovers. Then the ship hits an iceberg and its every man for himself.
No one has more admiration for Cameron's attention to detail in sets and costumes and his epic staging of the climactic sinking of the great leviathan into the icy Atlantic, than I do. But it's all for not when the primary diversion during the first two hours of this truncated melodrama is the childish bump and grind of two misfits inside the cargo hold. Truly, ""Titanic"" had more fascinating real life passengers on board, whose lives could have been more fully explored. Kathy Bates is wasted as Molly Brown, Victor Garber too, as Matthew Andrews.
The DVD transfer is a disappointing effort from Paramount. The letterbox picture has not been enhanced for widescreen televisions. Though colors are fairly represented and clarity and sharpness are amply present, there's a considerable amount of edge enhancement in the vertical paneling of the smoking room, the railing that surrounds the ship and many of the long shots of the ship sailing off into the sunset. Contrast levels are nicely balanced. Blacks are generally solid. Some film grain and digital grain make certain scenes break apart when viewed on a larger format. The audio is 5.1 stereo and provides a very strong and visceral listening experience. There are no extras on this disc except for the film's theatrical trailer.",1086739200,2,2058,4.882857142857143

131042,1,0792151712,"While this movie will never replace ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" or ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" as the worst Hollywood
movie of all times, it certainly ranks as one of the most BORING.
Director James Cameron's target audience is obviously 11-16 year old American girls.  If you have anything more sophisticated than they do going on in your head, there is not much for you here besides dazzling special effects.  I say this because the love story which forms the sole raison d'etre for this movie is as hackneyed and cliched as can be.  Hollywood has done variations on this theme of ""doomed love"" dozens of times throughout the 30's, 40's and 50's, and done it better.  Everything about this movie, the size of the cast, the special effects and wardrobe budgets, is HUGE, but, ultimately, empty.
Cameron should have cut the size of his cast in half and invested the money in a better script.
There is only one fully-developed character in the whole film, and that is the character of Rose, played by Kate Winslett.  Rose is an anachronism, a 1990's American feminist in Edwardian
times, trapped in an arranged engagement for money.  Anyone who
has read their Henry James is familiar with this scenario.  They are also aware of the subtle and obvious differences in attitudes between the women actually in these circumstances at that time and the attitudes of Rose.  By making all the other characters in the drama, even Leo DiCaprio's Jack Dawson, two-dimensional at best, whatever conflict that could develop in the plot lapses into a morass of cliches that you've seen a dozen or more times before.  When the self-centered fiance and his evil, toady butler meet their fates, your reaction is not: ""Good!"" but
""So what?!""
The problem with a one character-driven plotline, is that the audience doesn't care one way or the other about any of the other characters, so what happens to them is unimportant.  If you find the central character to be totally implausible or ridiculous, there's nothing to hold your interest in the story.  This flaw is compounded by the fact that we know in the first 10 minutes of the movie that Rose survives the Titanic and Jack does not.  Therefore, the only real suspense generated by the film is: ""When will it be over?""
Just as annoying is the way Cameron treats all the really interesting themes which could have made this story interesting,
the arrogance of wealth, the hubris of technology, the corruption and greed of vain ambition, as mere peripheral ornaments.  Everytime Cameron's camera finds something of interest to focus on, it cuts away.  ""Okay, we've shown you that,
now back to our love story!""  The conflicts between White Star Line heir Ismay and Captain Smith, which could have formed an
interesting secondary plot, are given 10 minutes of cursory,
obligatory attention, like mere factoids.  ""Oh yeah.  This was going on, too.""
See the 1953 version with Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck.  It's got a love story, too.  It also has 3-dimensional characters you can care about and a storyline which involves you!",1085961600,40,3069,4.867307692307692

131047,1,0792151712,"People have favorite movies.  I can honestly say this is the least favorite movie I have ever seen.  It's overblown, sappy, much too long and emotionally empty.

When the movie first came out and garnered rave reviews, a friend of mine and I waited two months to see it hoping the crowds would have died down.  We managed to grab the last two seats.  I hated it as much then as I hate it now and couldn't believe I wasted my money. People who'd seen the film said it didn't feel like three hours.  THEY LIED! I could not wait for that boat to sink and just seemed to take forever.

It would have been somewhat decent had Cameron stuck to the emotional suspense of the sinking boat and left out the sappy love story completely!  Or redirected the love story in such a manner that DiCaprio and Winslet meet for a brief moment at the start of the journey and go about their business since the two are from different classes and cannot be seen associating with one another.  Then boom: iceberg hits.  People begin to wonder what's wrong and slowly as the disaster worsens throughout the ship, Winslet and DiCaprio by necessity and circumstance end up having to depend on each other for survival. Slowly their relationship develops, not romantically, but as a result of two people from different classes who come to respect one another because of the trouble they went through together. Then as Dicaprio's character dies, it would really be a heart-wrenching loss.  When he sank into the ocean in that film, I was overjoyed. James Cameron had all the right opportunities to make this a poignant film, but he took the cheaters way out.

What got me the most was that this film actually beat out genuine talent to win 11 oscars.  It was deserving of maybe three or four technical awards, to include a noteworthy best score.  At it's best, this is nothing more than another of Cameron's action films.

Other annoyances:  Celine Dion's music video with her standing on the bow of the ship loftily singing  ""My Heart Will Go On"" with scenes of passengers dying and falling into icy waters.  Completely incongruent and somewhat nightmarish.  And to think that people paid money to watch this film seven times in a row!

Complete waste of a movie and thankfully not part of my DVD collection.",1084752000,20,2280,4.610421836228288

131089,1,0792151712,"As you watch Leonardo Di Caprio drown, frozen in the cruel arctic waters, it is hard not to experience a tremendous feeling of satisfaction.  The catharsis is overwhelming.  For more than two hours you have been wishing that Leonardo, along with most of the cast and crew, were dead, and then there they are, breathing their last.  It is enough to make you want to shake James Cameron's hand.
*
The film begins brilliantly with some lively and vulgar wordplay from an underwater salvage team.  You could be forgiven for thinking that you have inserted the wrong film (say, a made-for-video teen action exploitation flick)into your DVD player, but no, Mr. Cameron is masterfully toying with your expectations.
*
Quickly we meet Jack (Leonardo) and, my, what a snivelling little weasel he is; within minutes a deep enmity is established between him and the gentle viewer.  From then on Jack is placed in perilous situations where one might quite reasonably expect his imminent demise; thus, Kate Winslett (Rose) could have easily pushed him overboard on any number of occasions, and smothered him bodily on at least one other; Billy Zane could, by simply replacing a blank with a live bullet, have shot him - in fact, rumour has it that this in fact occurred, and consequently most of the budget of the film was dedicated to the CGI recreation of Leonardo in the last ninety minutes of screentime, and in the subsequent Oscar ceremonies, as well as in his so-called 'real life' ever since.
*

In any case, the appearance of the iceberg is truly cause for celebration.  What a good iceberg it is, searching out and destroying this disgraceful cast and scuppering the film good and proper.  As the water itself, the very stuff of life, hunts Leonardo down through the murky corridors one feels sure that justice is about to be dispensed.  The denouement is delicious.
*
A lovely postscript shows Rose throwing her priceless jewel into the depths of the Atlantic.  Rather than selling her treasure, and using the proceeds to feed the hungry or to heal the sick, she chooses to throw perhaps the equivalent of two hundred million dollars into the ocean, down the proverbial drain, as it were - surely a wonderful symbol for the movie as a whole.",1084320000,56,2239,4.792207792207792
131090,1,0792151712,The Titanic movie should never have been made. Because no one should remember the Titanic. 1912 (the year the overrated ship sank) was a bored year for America. Nothing much was happening so the papers spent time covering this shipwreck. Six years later the world plummetted into the worst pandemic ever seen---Spanish Influenza. 40 Million people died of influenza in that outbreak.

131092,5,0792151712,"Titanic is an excellent example of grand movie-making at its finest! James Cameron perfectly balanced historical accuracy (many historians have stated that the sinking is shown accurately here for the first time) with a wonderful love story to bring in modern audiences and make them really relate to this oft told tale. Cameron rigthly aimed for a classic hollywood, epic feel to his tale of doomed love aboard the most famous ship in history. His success is obvious from the films incredible world-wide success, and amazing and much deserved 11 Oscar wins!
Much of the films success lies in intelligent casting - Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are excellent and have wonderful chemestry as the star-crossed lovers. The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent, especially the ever reliable Kathy Bates as Molly Brown.
The sinking is an edge-of-your seat experience so effectively done that you will feel like you are on the ship! Of course the special effects are great and the music is appropriately wistful and heart-breakingly poignant.
I always get a kick out of reading the bad reviews the silly little critics of the movie write on this site. Who are they? Always nerds. Usually teenage or twenty something pimply  boys, although occassionaly a sad-sack older nerd, and sometimes a pathetic, female desperately needing attention. Have you ever met one of these people in real life? They are always obnoxious and unlikeable. They uaually have an excess of body hair (even the females)  are usually paunchy, always have rancid breath, and have usually never been in love in their sad little lives, hence their impatience with the love story in Titanic. They really should go floss and shut up.
It kills them that Titanic is number one, and baffles them how their favorite films, usually some Star Wars opus, can't seem to measure up.
We'll have some real fun listening to their impotent ranting when Titanic is re-released in theaters soon and makes another mint! (Hee Hee)!

131145,5,0792151712,"I can't get enough of the whole Titanic thing. I have 4 DVDs (soon to be 5, with a DVD on the Britannic too!), 3 videos, about 12 books, the script signed by James Cameron... I'm a scary lady! I just can't get enough of it! And I'm even sad enough to have an animated DVD of the Titanic, made for kids. Hey, it's fun!
What is most depressing about this DVD is the severe lack of extras. You get a pretty average trailer, and that's it! James Cameron is normally well known for his great extras on DVD (the first two Terminators come to mind). There have been rumours about a special edition coming out hopefully in time for Christmas (someone I know has to keep reassuring me that it will come out!) So I'm hoping and praying for that, as the extras are pretty lousy, for a James Cameron DVD.
I absolutely adore this movie. It still gets me every time I watch it, and although I've never actually cried, I do get a bit teary, but I have to watch, cos everytime I watch it, I've normally got all my makeup on! The whole relationship between Jack & Rose (a relationship which has been copied in many other movies about the Titanic) is so sweet, although they may seem in love, Rose only says it to Jack once and that's when they're both in the water. He never responds - which makes him seem like a bit of a jerk to be honest. But that's the only low point that Jack's character has. Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio are perfect as Jack & Rose, although they could have been any of these actors/actresses: Matthew McConaughey, Gwyneth Paltrow, Michael Biehn (as Cal Hockley, which could have been cool), Christian Bale and Macaulay Culkin. Kate has to appear completely naked in front of Leo (very embarrassing), but she flashed him when they first met to break the ice! When Jack draws Kate, it's actually James Cameron's hands. In post-production, Cameron, who is left-handed, mirror-imaged the sketching shots so the artist would be appear to be right-handed, like Leonardo DiCaprio.
James Cameron got the idea for his own Titanic movie after watching A Night To Remember (a pretty average Titanic movie if you ask me, I mainly don't like it, cos it's in black & white!), and spent 5 years researching Titanic. There are many similarities between A Night To Remember & Titanic. A number of scenes are arranged and in some cases scripted almost identical. This is particularly true of these scenes: Thomas Andrews telling Capt. Smith the sinking is ""a mathematical certainty""; the Titanic's band preparing to depart at the end, only to turn around and regroup as Hartley begins playing 'Nearer My God to Thee' by himself (though a different version of the song is used in the 1958 film); a shot of Ismay in a lifeboat as the Titanic sinks behind him; Thomas Andrews looking at a painting as Titanic prepares to sink; and Andrews encountering a man by the Grand Staircase and telling him the ship is doomed (in Cameron's film, he tells Rose).
A very creepy fact: there actually IS a J. Dawson (Joseph), who was on the Titanic and died. Cameron only discovered this after the script was finished that there had been a real ""J. Dawson"" who died aboard the Titanic. This ""J. Dawson"" was trimmer Joseph Dawson, who had been born September 1888 in Dublin, Ireland. His body was salvaged and buried at Fairview Lawn cemetery in Nova Scotia with many other Titanic victims. Today, his grave stone (#227) is the most widely visited in the cemetery, all thanks to the movie!
Something else which is quite disappointing about this movie is that the Californian,which had stopped for the night due to the ice hazard and was within sight of the Titanic throughout the sinking, is not featured at all. (Californian's ice warning had been received and sent to the bridge but was not placed in the chartroom.) Many other Titanic movies, most notably the TV version, starring Catherine Zeta Jones & Peter Gallagher, rely heavily on the Californian scenes when the Titanic is sinking.
Gloria Stuart also stars, as the 'Old Rose'. Really, she's only 86, but she had to be aged to 101, which can't have been a pleasant experience - what a scary thought!
This is a terrific movie. Most people love it, although you get the occasional review, especially on here, saying that it's not good. But it's the whole romance about it, and the whole history of it.

The tragic story of the sinking of the Titanic is told in this movie through the memory of an elderly lady named Rose who, when she was seventeen, was a passenger on Titanic.  Rose was a first class passenger who met Jack, an artist and a steerage class passenger.  Rose and Jack fell in love.  Up to that point in the movie, my biggest complaint was profanity, including repeated taking of the Lord's name in vain.  However, then Rose asks Jack to draw her picture while she wears nothing more than a 52 carat diamond broach.  It is this drawing that is found in modern times on the sunken Titanic and is seen as a clue to treasure hunters who are looking for the 52 carat diamond.  The reason I give the movie only two stars is that this drawing and the search for the diamond is nothing more than a device used to show Kate Winslet, the actress who plays Rose, in the nude.  I do not understand why the producers and director of Titanic didn't understand that they hurt their movie by employing this silly device as an excuse to show Kate's naked body to eager teenage boys.  The love story was a good way to personalize the tragedy of the Titanic and the special effects were really spectacular.  Hollywood should learn when they trash an otherwise good movie with nudity and profanity that their work suffers.

Based after the historical Titanic ship and story line, this film portrays the tragedy of the night that the deemed to be unsinkable Titanic sunk.  I enjoyed this epic film because of the history behind the movie and the infiltration of a love story.  Leonardo Dicaprio played as Jack Dawson, a low society member and Kate Winslet played as Rose Dewitt Bukater, a high society figure.  Their hidden romance portrayed through out the film was enduring and captured the hearts of the audience.  I felt that this disaster epic was well written and produced and the footage that the producer was able to create and capture is remarkable.  It left one feeling as if you were really there, on the Titanic and it was easy to feel as if you were part of the time and event.  This is a wondering film that can be enjoyed by many different age groups except for young children.",1076716800,2,918,4.560975609756097
131302,5,0792151712,"If this incredible films winning of eleven Academy awards including Best Picture and Best director and being the highest grossing film of all time doesn't speak for itself I don't know what else would.  ""Titanic"" is quite simply one of the best tales of a true life tragedy interspersed with a fictional love story ever made, all of which combines to make director James Cameron appear a true genius which in terms of being a film director he is.  Only one note of caution need be applied to watching this film on DVD and that is to know where the pause button is on your DVD player when considering the three hour length of the film.
I will freely admit that I'm not a big Leonardo DiCaprio fan but when it comes to this film he did an exceptional job in the role of Jack.  Instrumental in the success of this film, beyond the exceptional script, is the performance given by the ever beautiful Kate Winslet in the role of Rose.  Noteworthy are the performances given by the supporting cast to include the likes of David Warner, Kathy Bates and Billy Zane and of course a couple of James Cameron's staple actors who crop up in almost all of his films in Bill Paxton and Jenette Goldstein.
As testimony to the brilliance of director James Cameron one only needs to take a look at his list of directorial and script credits which includes; ""The Terminator,"" ""Aliens,"" ""The Abyss,"" ""T2:  Judgment Day,"" ""True Lies"" and ""Titanic.""  With a list such as this one James Cameron has most certainly gone down in history as one of the most successful directors/screen writers in history and deservedly so.  It would be nice to see him take a break from television and take up the film directing mantle once again as one can almost call it a sure bet film when he's in the director's chair.
The Premise:
On April 14th, 1912 one of western civilization's most tragic events occurred when a ship thought to be unsinkable did exactly that, struck an iceberg and sank killing hundreds of passengers in the process as the ships builders seemed to have made one mistake after another in the construction of this ""magnificent"" vessel.
Director/screen writer James Cameron concocts a glorious love story around this true life tragedy and quite poignantly portrays the disparity of classes aboard the vessel as the first class passengers live in the lap of luxury even during the ""abandonment"" of the vessel while the poor are treated with palpable disdain to include being locked below decks after the ship begins to sink.
While the true story of this movie is the sinking of the ship told through Cameron's brilliant writing and direction there is whole myriad of other things going on that are not noticeable but would've been had they been done incorrectly, chief among these are the costumes and the sets of the Titanic.
The truly fictitious portion of this tragedy is told through Rose Dawson Calvert (Gloria Stuart) as she regales present day treasure hunters of her time on the Titanic and the gloriously passionate but brief love affair between her and Jack Dawson who was a free spirited artist who taught her how to live despite his destiny...
I highly recommend this film to any and all who are fans of what movie making is all about!  {ssintrepid}

We begin with an elederly lady relaying her experience on the Titanic to a diving crew that are in search of it and in particular a necklace that was on her.

As the lady relates her story we find out about an incredible experience she had aboard and how she is directly related to that necklace. The incredible acting, costumes, and music make us feel we are there. The romance and trajedy draw us into a bittersweet tragedy. As the story draws to a close we find out she still possesses the necklace. And here is when I think the story writer had drain bamage.

She tosses it overboard in remembrance of her lost love. Sorry but if I was that lad she loved and that had died saving her, her tossing me the trinket all those years later would not make it romantic. She should have given it to the people that were searching for it and spent so much to find it, the ones that took her back to the Titanic, the ones that intently listened to her story, the ones that helped her move on. So maybe I'm the only one that thinks there should have been an alternate ending but that's my humble opinion.",1075939200,,1256,4.317796610169491
131305,4,0792151712,"Before I begin my review of ""Titanic,"" I feel the need to speak to those who have given this film one star reviews. First and foremost, I am both a film critic and an actor, so yes, I DO know better than you. Second, it makes you look stupid to hate any movie just because it wins Oscars and makes a lot of money. Third, 1998 is over, teenage girls aren't mindlessly obsessed with Leonardo Di Caprio anymore, and it is therefore no longer necessary to pretend to hate this movie. And finally (and most importantly), you have little to no understanding of what makes a great historical epic (which ""Titanic"" most certainly is). Strict adherence to the actual facts is not a priority; telling a great, compelling story is. (Imagine how incredibly boring ""Lawrence of Arabia"" would have been if it had told the story of T.E. Lawrence's actual life, instead of being based on an autobiography full of self-aggrandizing inaccuracies.) And in that regard, ""Titanic"" certainly succeeds.
The basic plot of ""Titanic"" is a fairly standard (yet no less entertaining) love story. Rose De Witt (Kate Winslet) is a wealthy Pennsylvania heiress returning from Europe with her mother (Frances Fisher) and fiance (Billy Zane) on the Titanic. There she meets Jack Dawson (Leonardo Di Caprio), a poor American who won his ticket in a card game moments before the ship set sail. After Jack saves Rose's life, the two quickly fall in love, and embark on a brief but passionate affair. Of course, their romance is destined for tragedy.
The storytelling of this movie is top-notch. The movie manages to take a plot which is inherently full of melodrama and make it very watchable. It's a fairly cliche rich-girl-meets-poor-boy romance, but because the two leads have such great chemistry, it seems new and fresh. The dialogue is, admittedly, fairly poor. But dialogue is the least important aspect of a film (a great screenplay can elevate a film, but a poor one is rarely the sole, or even primary, factor behind a bad movie).
Much has been made of the poor acting in this film. The fact is, there are no acting coups in ""Titanic."" But this is not an actor's movie. This one is all about the story and the spectacle, both of which it has in spades. Leonardo Di Caprio doesn't do a BAD job as Jack; he just isn't especially believable. Kate Winslet, one of the best actresses working in films today, does some of the weakest work of her career but is always watchable, and the rest of the cast acquits themselves well. (How Winslet earned a Best Actress Oscar nomination is beyond me; Gloria Stuart's Best Supporting Actress nod undoubtedly came about because the Academy loves elderly veterans who make ""comebacks."")
The main reason to watch this movie is for the special effects. But the people who have called this movie ""all effects and no plot"" (aside from demonstrating a complete lack of understanding as to what ""plot"" is) speak as though they're watching the run-of-the-mill explosions of a Bruckheimer action film. The visual effects in action films are not impressive; those in ""Titanic"" are. It's as though James Cameron (who I normally despise, but deserves every bit of acclaim he got for this film) built an entirely new Titanic just to sink it. A lot of movies have special effects that are impressive in theory, but don't excite anyone. In this film, the Titanic looks REAL. (The scenes of the sinking ship, particularly the harrowing sequence where it splits in half, are worth more than all three ""Matrix"" films put together.) These effects don't dazzle us with over-the-top demonstrations of what computers are capable of; they do what great effects should and bring the spectacle to life. And they don't show a hint of artifice.
In short, ""Titanic"" is a grand, sweeping epic where the melodrama is never overdone and the epic length is never boring. But the fact is, even if that weren't the case, it would be worth watching just to SEE it. This is not on the same plateau as a timeless masterpiece like ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane,"" but it is a very good film. One of the best of 1997 -- not quite as good as ""L.A. Confidential,"" its main rival for that year's Best Picture Oscar, but not so distant in quality that its victory can be considered a travesty (kind of like when ""Dances with Wolves"" beat the superior ""Goodfellas"" in 1990 -- yes, the runner-up was better, but by so little that the winner was every bit as deserving). And, as with any movie review on this site, mine is the only one worth paying attention to. It doesn't claim that the film is boring just because it won Best Picture and had a romance; it doesn't heap praise upon the movie just because it had good-looking leads. It acknowledges the superior quality of a good film, which is what a QUALIFIED reviewer, and not a malcontent who feels the need to trash anything coming out of present-day Hollywood, is supposed to do.",1074729600,2,4898,4.716452742123687

Accordingly, Jack and Rose join Mrs. O'Leary's cow as the heretofore anonymous precipitators of terrible tragedy, and we should all be grateful to James Cameron's detective work for digging up the truth.",1072742400,4,798,4.984962406015038

131450,4,0792151712,"The last time I reviewed the film, I gave the first half pretty dismal comments while overtly praising the last half. After re-watching the film, the first half is rather slow although does have it's good points while the last half is probably some of the most thrilling and goosebump-inducing moments captured on celluloid.

The massive ship Titanic set sail on the week of April 10th, 1912. It left Southampton and made it's way to New York. It was the maiden voyage for the ocean liner and the press was marvelling at her size, so to give them something new to print, the owner ordered it to go faster so they can marvel her speed. Unfortunately, that left little time to dodge an iceberg that sideswiped the ship below the waterline causing the ship to flood from the inside. It plunged head first into the water and started to sink for 2 hours and 40 minutes until the ship split in 2 and sank to the ocean floor.

The story centers on Jack, a free travelling artist, who ends up falling in love with Rose, a woman who's marrying the son of a steel tycoon, only she doesn't really love him and he's quite the controlling type. They enjoy the time together but they can't be together can't cause she's engaged and he's a poor guy. So they get caught up in the collision and have to survive long enough.

The first half is noteworthy to me for it's set design. It looks remarkable with a lot of attention to detail as well as the aerial shots of the ship which James Cameron said to CG artists to act like you were advertising the Titanic for commercials. The costumes are quite great also.

Almost an hour and 40 minutes passes until the lockouts notices the iceberg and the crew scramble to go around it. They were too late as the ship ends up scraping the iceberg in a nice action scene and then pretty much not a lot of action only neat effects. The film, thanks to great sound, as a lot of goosebump moments like their run away from the water in the corridor or when the ceiling gives way to the water.

Then the big moment itself: when the ship can't handle the pressure and it splits in half and eventually sinks. It's a great use of effects, minatures and live action and certainly looks impressive even on repeated viewings. One odd thing though is that sometimes the scenes look really odd, like when the ship is floating vertical, look at the hairlines and faces, they look weird against the backdrop, or they look obvious blue screen.

Another compliment is James Horner's score. It has that right amount of energy and action with more character and soft overtones. The main theme that you hear during the opening is quite nice too although my favorite is at the end when the camera travels underwater back to the ship. Vocalist Sissel has a nice ethereal quality to her voice that makes it almost haunting. And of course we've all heard the song, yes the SONG THE SONG! UGH! But anyways.

It's funny that James Cameron had a big run in the 1980's and early 1990's with Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, Terminator 2, True Lies and this, then there's practically no new film. Known for being quite the perfectionist on set, he can make a good thrilling film and blend of comedy and character development. Love this film or hate it, it's still quite a marvel to look at.",1072224000,,3281,4.476588628762542
131451,3,0792151712,"The special effects were quite good as the ship went down, but the unlikely love story was contrived and unconvincing. Leo is miscast big time as Jack. With the sappy love story between him and Kate Winslet, I anxiously awaited the sinking of the boat.

He convinces her to not commit suicide when she thought that she'd never break free from her rich and meaningless society. He makes that journey the best three days of her life, and gives her a reason to go on living once he dies in the icey waters; to keep his memory alive. In the end, when she dies as an old lady, warm in her bed, it shows pictures sitting on the table by her bed. They are pictures of Rose going on to live the dream that she and Jack hoped to live together once the ship docked. Then you follow her spirit once she passes.

131454,4,0792151712,"Right now we're still too close to ""Titanic"" to say whether or not, flaws and all (especially its screenplay, which wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award), will be considered a classic.
""Ben Hur,"" the other film that won 11 Oscars, made the American Film Institute's top 100 list, but beyond the great chariot race, few people have great affection for it because of its aloof and emotionally distant tone.
But my best guess is in about 20 years, people will come to better appreciate this film as being deserving to be placed in the ""classic"" category, flaws and all, primarily because of its global impact at the time it was released and its INTENTIONAL use of maudlin themes and a romantic narrative that truly borrows from the glory days of romantic American cinema of the 1930s and 1940s.
This is perhaps why Janet Maslin of the New York Times declared that ""Titanic"" was the first film in decades that earned the right to be debated and compared to ""Gone with the Wind"" (now let's be honest, that was a corny movie too, wasn't it?).
""Titanic"" may not be ""Gone With the Wind,"" but the comparison is good.  Gable was well known, but who knew Vivien Leigh?  DiCaprio and Winslet, before ""Titanic,"" were accomplished young film actors, both with previous Oscar nominations, but not in the upper box office tier of stars.  And this is ""Titanic's"" overriding strength. What if more well-known stars had been cast in the lead roles? It would've cast a completely different light and tone.
The fact that ""Titanic"" became a pop culture phenomenon has diminished it in many ways to elitist critics and others who have parodied everything about it, from its over-played Celine Dion theme song to its stick-figure characters (e.g., it reminds me of what happened to ""Rocky"" after winning Best Picture in 1976, only to have its accomplishments diluted by its bad sequels).
My recollection is that NO ONE, least of all the critics, expected ""Titanic"" to become a hit.  In fact, there was initial fondness that the film still ""held together,"" despite well-known and horrific delays associated with bringing this ""summer release"" to the screen in December 1997.  As the film's gross returns got bigger each week, ""Titanic,"" despite high production costs, became regarded as the three-hour ""underdog"" that prevailed.  In my mind, the voices of dissent became noticeably louder only after the film was nominated for a record-tying 14 Academy Awards.
Historical inaccuracies abound, but like ""Gone With the Wind,"" romantic considerations were paramount to avoid a ""flat"" telling of what everyone knows will happen to the ship.  Hence upon seeing ""Titanic"" the first time, I was amazed the story was engaging at all, albeit in an idealized 1940s style, cliches and all.  It's equally amazing that any film can become a box-office champ without a single computer-generated alien, dinosaur or space ship.  The ""romance"" is what made ""Titanic"" popular, especially with young people.  It's not the ""romance"" of great literature, it's the romance of the type we saw in ""Gone With the Wind.""  It's simple and uncomplicated, and again, it's executed in a style borrowed from the golden age of cinema.
In sum, the intellectual snobbery against ""Titanic"" will never threaten its universal popularity.  The money put into this film is all on the screen, and the lack of an ""intelligent"" script -- is overwhelmed by the momentum of the film's idealized romance and impending destruction -- lifted even higher by its perfect ending (always the most important factor determining whether a film has a chance of entering the pantheon of greats.)
If you take the historian's view, ""Titanic's"" accomplishments are too large to dismiss.  And if it had been released in 1947 instead of 1997, I'm convinced even MORE people would be in its corner today.  But this will never change the minds of people who hate it.  So just don't listen.",1070064000,6,3907,4.9525993883792045
131495,4,0792151712,"Directed by James Cameron, this 1997 film takes the viewer back to April of 1912 aboard the maiden voyage of the Titantic.  Known for its size, the ship was believed by many to be unsinkable.  The movie starts off with a search crew, led by ""Brock Lovett"" (Bill Paxton) who is exploring the remains buried at sea, particularly a 56-carat blue diamond necklace named ""The Heart of the Ocean"".  Upon discovery of a safe, ""Brock"" reveals a sketch of a young woman wearing the necklace. The picture is dated April 14, 1912.  Upon hearing of the search for the diamond on a news station, a 101- year-old lady ""Rose Dawson Clavert"" (Gloria Stuart) contacts ""Brock"" to inform him of information that may help him in his search.
Upon arrival to the ""Brocks"" vessel, ""Rose"" identifies herself as the woman in the sketch and beings to reveal her accounts and secrets of the voyage.
This film takes us back and forth from 1912 to present day. ""Rose's"" story begins when she, as a young woman accompanies her wealthy obnoxious fianc,  ""Cal Hockley"" (Billy Zane) and her socialite mother ""Ruth De Witt Bukater"" (Frances Fisher) aboard the Titantic on it's maiden voyage from Ireland to America.
The death of ""Rose's"" father has left her family in extreme debt and her engagement to wealthy ""Mr. Hockley"" has been forced upon her by her mother ""Ruth"" to help them from losing their social status within the community. Although ""Rose"" has captured the love of her fianc ""Cal"", she doesn't love him and longs for a life that offers her more.
""Jack Dawson"" (Leonardo DiCapario), an aspiring young artist who has won his 3rd class ticket from a poker game is also boarding the ship unknowing that the love of his life is also boarding the same ship.
Having been pushed to her limits ""Rose"" rushes to the bow to jump over board.  ""Jack"" sees what is about to happen and rescues ""Rose"" from ending her life.  The two find an attraction to one another and steal time away to be together.  ""Jack"" talks about living live to it's fullest and ""making it count"".  The two are captivated by one another and fall madly in love. As the ship smashes into an iceberg and begins to sink, the two rush to find safety only to confirm that the ship is not equipped with enough life- boats to save everyone aboard.
After the ship has sunk, together they find a single piece of wood that is only big enough to hold one of them.  ""Rose"" climbs on the board while holding onto ""Jack's"" hand as he floats in the icy water. As they float waiting for the rescue team, ""Jack"" forces ""Rose"" to promise that she will fight to stay alive and to never let go.
This epic offers a love story and drama along with the excitement of exploration.

I'm sorry but love does not happen overnight. This movie is about two immature, selfish teens infatuated with each other. They hurt others and even risk their own well-being just to satisfy their lust.
Jack Dawson, makes for a peculiar and utterly selfish character. He is a poor but well-travelled man of his time???(A strange combination in those days.) Anyhow, he was extremely inconsiderate of his little rich girl Rose. What was he planning to do when they got off the ship? Sweep her off her feet, and introduce her to the wonderful life of 18 hr. sweat shops, diseased slums, and stillborn babies?  For a more experienced and more exposed man, he sure had some good intentions for his little princess! I'm sure that when the misery and reality set in, she would've realized just how much happier life was going to be with her new love! Definitely the new and better life that she so deserved.
I also didn't find it too amusing that he blatantly forced his way into an engaged couple's relationship and basically stole another man's woman. He then proceeded to take an inexperienced and naive girl's virginity in the backseat of a car!???? Yeah, he really treated her like a lady there. He sure showed her some dignity and respect.
It's good riddance that he froze to death in the end. Some things do work out for the best, don't they?

I like this movie because it accurately portrays the evnts of the sinking, and, also, it shows what the human race is like when disaster strikes. I'm very into the Titanic itself, learning about the history and events of that time. However, even saying all this.... this was not an extraordinary movie on the whole, and certainly not the best movie ever made. If you don't know anything about the time in which this movie takes place, or even interested in it, you probably won't like it or understand it. And the acting certainly wasn't great. The dialog at times was cliched and predictable. The special effects, at the time, were the one thing the movie had that was great, to even die-hard haters. I, myself, was partial to automatically give this movie a great rating, simply because I am so interested in the subject. But after reading the reviews of other people, I can see why not everyone will like it. But so what? If you don't like it, you don't like it. But do we need to argue like children? I understand why the people that liked it did, and I also understand why the people that didn't like it, didn't like it. But give it a rest already. If you really didn't like the movie, then why are you wasting your ""supposed"" intelligence to keep complaining about it? Titanic was made over 6 years ago, so just move on. And if you DO like the movie.... then just keep liking it and stop wasting your time arguing over something pointless.

131583,4,0792151712,"I think there is a reason why this movie is getting trashed so much.  People who have low self esteem and haven't really accomplished a lot in life make themselves feel better by tearing down something that is extremely popular such as the movie Titanic.  This movie made $600 Million in the United States, has sold millions of videos and DVDs, and it averages three and a half stars?  Most likely a lot of those who hate this movie don't get out much and write a lot of negative reviews in this forum.
First of all, the movie is not perfect.  Some of the dialogue in this movie is written so poorly it's hard to watch at times.  James Cameron can direct amazing action sequences but he has trouble directing two people in a room talking to each other.  And of course, there is the love story which is far from original.  Girl in the arranged marriage and she falls in love with another man who happens to come from the wrong side of the tracks.  Then there is the fact that wealthy people are stuck up snobs and they are shown in bad light.  Don't you love it when an industry as rich as Hollywood makes movies making wealthy people look bad?
With so much wrong why four stars? With all that is wrong with it the movie has a sense of elegance.  The story moves along at a good pace.  With the obvious distractions I was never bored in this three hour plus flick.  Yeah, the first hour or so was a little slow but once the Titanic hits that ice berg the film picks up pace.  There is a sense of awe watching this great ship begin to sink.  However, it loses a lot of it's grandeur on the small screen.  The score by James Horner is really nice although I am one of those grouches who hated the Celine Dion song the first time I heard it.  Then there is Billy Zane.  He had a small role but I hated him.  I was supposed to hate his character and he pulled that job off.  I didn't care a whole lot for Jack Dawson one way or another but I really hated that Calvin Hockley.  This is not a perfect movie by any means, nor is it a terrible movie.  There are those who hate the fact that this one the Best Picture award but hey, so did Shakespeare in Love and Gladiator.  Enjoy.
The only thing missing on this DVD is a documentary.  A lot went wrong while making this movie including a poisoned crew, a bloated budget, and a shot that run longer than expected.  Maybe a special two set DVD will be released someday.",1068249600,,2409,4.1869565217391305

131587,1,0792151712,"I was impressed at the special effects when I saw Titanic in theaters, but the movie has not held up well over the years.  The effects, which now pale in comparison to the work done in The Lord of the Rings and Matrix trilogies, are not enough to sustain a souless, plotless, poorly written melodrama.  What did anyone expect, though?  It was directed by James Cameron, a man who's made a career out of filming big budget pulp.  He doesn't direct people, he directs explosives, car chases, machines, so it's no surprises that his attempt at injecting a human element into Titanic falls flat.
How could audiences, even young ones, not see through this formulaic tripe?  The poor starving artist, the opressed rich girl, her despicable wealthy fiance...it all sounds like material for a Lifetime or Hallmark channel made for television movie.  Everything from Leonardo DiCaprio's cliched portrayal of the free spirited artist to Kate Winslet's outspoken society girl schtick is recycled from countless movies.  These aren't people, they're caricatures of people.  The sequence where Billy Zane (in an embarrassingly bad performance) goes bezerk and chases Winslet and DiCaprio through the ship with a gun, shooting wildly WHILE THE SHIP IS SINKING, is the sort of thing only a megalomaniac like James Cameron would even think of filming, let alone leave in the final cut of the movie.
I strongly disagree with the Amazon review that calls this a movie for the ages.  It already looks stupid only five or so years after its release, in another ten people might begin to mistake it for a comedy.",1067126400,7,1591,4.928838951310861
131588,1,0792151712,"Titanic is, quite possibly, the single most disappointing moment in motion picture history. And I've sat through most of Leslie Nielsen's pictures, so I know what I'm talking about.
Jack is a penniless artist who wins his passage home to the States in a poker game. Rose is a spoilt upper-class socialite, who is being forced into a loveless marriage in order to avoid financial bankruptcy. The Titanic is a magnificent ocean liner, more opulent than many palaces, more diverse than many cities. Thus the scene is set for the greatest romantic epic of all time.
Except, somewhere between Rose and her Hat stepping out of the taxi at the dock, and Jack getting made over in Kathy Bates's husbands' old Tuxedo, it all goes horribly, horribly wrong, and what we are left with is over three hours of terrible acting, overstated sentimentality, and really, really cringeworthy melodrama.
The problem with Titanic is that the Boat is the true star of the picture, and to this end, the movie works well, with some beautifully realised shots of a very convincing ocean liner. Strange, then, that the idiot writers decided to tack on a mawkish and simplistic poor-boy-meets-rich-girl 'human interest' story, the mundanity of which unfortunately eclipses the majesty of Cameron's direction and colours the entire mood of the film. Leonardo diCaprio and Kate Winslet are very fine actors (see 'What's eating Gilbert Grape?' and 'Sense and Sensibility' for proof of that) but their capibilities are lost in a terrible script that mixes contemporary dialogue with unrealistic period situations and the whole performance never quite manages to be realistic or believable.
A doomed love story in a historically epic situation could have been a masterpiece, but instead, thanks to the Hollywood Machine's endless underestimation of the intelligence levels of their moviegoing public, 'Titanic' descends into something embarrassing and over-long. It could have been so good, but it's not. Simple as that. For blockbuster romantic epics, check out 'Gone With The Wind', 'Moulin Rouge' and 'Chinatown'. For an exercise in how to jazz up a half-baked script with some lovely special effects, get 'Titanic'.

Aside from turning this tragic event (which is depicted well in the foolishness of the captain) into the backdrop for his stupid romance, James Cameron has taken all the focus off of what it should be on.  The sinking of the Titanic was a tragedy, and the memory of it should not be so infamously defaced as it was by this horrible movie.

Yes, I was a hopeless romantic 18 year old when it came out and I admit to seeing it in the theater 6 times (I kept going back with friends who hadn't seen it yet) but, aside from that, the movie is well-written, well-acted and incredibly filmed.  I appreciate James Cameron's dedication to detail and that the sinking sequence in the movie is almost in real time.  I think that if you are not affected in some way by this movie, then you didn't really watch it.
I bought the movie when it first came out on tape and only upgraded to the DVD because I received it as a Christmas present the same year I received a DVD player.  Right now, the only thing the DVD has going for it is the fact that you don't need to change discs in the middle of the movie like you do with the tapes.  Special features are non-existent on this DVD, which is a real shame when one considers all the scenes that were filmed and cut from the final film.  There are probably about an hour of cut scenes locked away in a vault somewhere, which saddens me greatly.  Add to that all the historical information that could have been included and this could have been an outstanding DVD experience.  This is why I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars.

Kate Winslet, brilliant actress and when i saw her name i imediatly thought that this would be a blockbuster, WRONG!
She was so irritating as Rose De whats it and yet the way in which she acted made her seem smarmy and showing of as though she was to be the greatest actress ever in this, and when she was constantly screetching Jack i was praying that the iceburg would come and knock her overboard and kick her of the screen as she was constantly pouting in front of it!
Kathy Bates, a smashing actress with a brilliant sence of humour and whatever shes in you can expect a cracking performance, except this. As Molly Brown she was so wooden and saught of retained from giving a convincing performance.
Frances Fisher was always whispering and always seemed to be angry and fussing over Winslet that i got bored of her, though she did give a good cold impression on the lifeboat!
Leonardo DiCaprio was rubish as Jack and that stupid french idiot who was always either smiling or going overboard (forgive the pun)on crying who travelled with him. As Jack he was always trying to get a good close up on the camra of himself and i think his best performance when he really got into the part and looked and acted just as if he was Jack was when.......he was frozen solid in the Atlantic.

131646,5,0792151712,"James Cameron's vision of a dramatic love story running parallel with the greatest maritime tragedy of our time is all at once grand, terrifying and very emotional. With a running time of over three hours not many directors could have kept the pace so brisk, but Cameron is well known for his skill at story telling and making sure you know where and what is happening at all times.

First and foremost, if you watch this movie with your emotional guard up you are not likely to get the full affect. You have to let yourself truly feel what these two characters are going through to let this movie get a grip on you.  Leo and Kate perform well with a casual script that lays down the ground work of two young people who obviously have immediate chemistry. Leo plays Jack Dawson, a young (poor) traveling artist who inadvertently saves Rose (Kate Winslet), a young Pennsylvanian girl betrothed to a rich snob (played with sneering egocentric guile by Billy Zane) as he finds her ready to jump from the back of the ship. This rescue is a symbolism for the entire movie.  Rose feels trapped in her life and as she witnesses Jack's carefree existence it starts to bring out her spirited side as well.  She wants more than just to marry into a rich family as her mother has forced her to do for her own purposes.

Cameron's underlying message of breaking free of that which is holding you back and to live the way you should could very well be misunderstood as liberal but could also be seen as a revelation to those who can relate.  Cameron does not set out to bash rich people either though.  The other wealthy characters are flawed but overall good people, treating Jack with polite curiosity during a meal in the first class dining room.

As Rose finally defies the marriage arrangement and two start to realize their love, the real tragedy starts.  The iceberg strikes and the ship starts it's long death scene. Thankfully, suspension of disbelief is not needed.  The visuals of the sinking ship are strikingly realistic, especially when the ship splits.  The special effects are incredible and the stark reality of the way some of these people died could be disturbing to watch as bodies fall off the ship, striking things on the way to the icy water.

There is a subplot that gets the whole movie started; The Heart of the Ocean, a huge blue diamond pendant.  It is the focus of a search expedition that brings Rose, and her story out to the site where Titanic sunk.  It brings the movie together, but is forgettable at the same time, which is what I think Cameron wanted.  His stamp of detail is intertwined throughout the movie.

The historical accuracy is pinpoint as well.  Many things that happen around Rose and Jack actually did happen.  From the rich first class passengers characterizations to the discussion between the captain and the President of the Starlight company about speeding up the ship in order to arrive early.  From the gymnasium to the dining room to the suites.  From the officers who helped load people into the boats and allegedly shot some passengers to keep order, to the cook who was seen standing on the back of the ship in it's last seconds before it submerged.  All of it was documented as actually history by at least more than one account.  Cameron did extensive research on the events and only recreated that which was consistent in multiple testimony and/or historical documentation.

Titanic won best picture and best director as well as many other awards, all well deserved. The pre-release bashing due to delays in production made it sour to some who may have expected something different, but it made it sweet to those who are Cameron fans and watched it's gross income rise every week.  In no way was this movie meant to be as popular as it was but it is a credit to Cameron to make something that is not only so obviously personal but to also make it so appealing, engrossing and emotional.

Update: 11/28/2005
I just recently purchased the 3-Disc collectors edition and I have to say this DVD is even more spectactular.  The digital transfer is awesome, great picture and sound.  The deleted scenes even look complete.  There is great one with Jack actually beating the crud out of Lovejoy; for those as observationally astue as I am the scene was in the trailer, but not in the movie.  I for one thought Lovejoy deserved to get pummeled and was glad to be able to see this scene.  The special edition discs are loaded, and I do mean LOADED.  With missing scenes, documetaries on the making of the movie, the trips down to the actual wreckage, time lapsed film of the set construction and a fantastic alternate ending where Bill Paxton's character has an epiphany when he discovers that Rose had the diamond the whole time.  I can't say enough to recommend this Special Edition DVD.",1060819200,2,4829,4.644705882352941
131647,1,0792151712,"""The Unsinkable""
 Titanic is an epic drama that is untouchable in comparison, winning 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture.  Paramount Pictures and Twentieth Century Fox joined James Cameron to bring the 1997 film running for 194 minutes to anxious viewers.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet take the starring roles as Jack and Rose.
 Rose had no idea when she boarded the ""unsinkable"" R.M.S. Titanic for it's maiden voyage what was in store.  Titanic was a luxury ocean liner like no one had ever seen before, it was bigger, faster, and fancier than any ship of it's time.  When Rose set sail with her mother and wealthy fianc, she did not expect to find her true love.  Jack (DiCaprio) was a misfit who had won his third class ticket in a lucky hand at poker just minutes before the ship sets sail.  Jack catches Roses attention and she can't help but keep seeing him against her fianc's orders.  Rose finds true love with this scoundrel, as the rest of her ""society friends"" view him.
 Jack and Roses love is pushed to limit as Titanic hits an iceberg and the invincible ship begins to go down.  As the ship begins to sink Rose and Jack must choose between their love and life.  Fifteen hundred people go into the cold Atlantic ocean and only six will survive leaving those six and the lucky ones who made in into a life boat to by haunted by that cold night at sea.
 The award-winning soundtrack ( Best Original Song) adds to the drama.  This film shows us how a handful of people and a couple bad decisions can end the lives of so many.  I like this movie for the fact it has what seems like such a depressing outcome but at the same time, you want to watch it again and again to see the wonderful love story.  I give film 5 stars.",1060732800,2,1742,4.413793103448276
131648,4,0792151712,"Titanic was released in 1997 with a running time of 194 minutes. It was released by Paramount Pictures and directed by James Cameron.  The cast included Leonardo DiCaprio (Jack Dawson), Kate Winslet (Rose Dewitt Bukater), Billy Zane (Cal Hockley), Frances Fisher(Ruth Dewitt Bukater) and Bill Paxton (Brock Lovett)
Titanic is a romance, an adventure and a thriller all in one.  As the movies opens, it is seen in the present day setting with Brock Lovett a member of a salvage team, who are investigating the remainders of the wrecked Titanic at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.  Brock and his team are in search of the ""Heart of the Ocean"", which is a 56 carat diamond lost when the ship went down.  Brock found a picture of a young girl wearing the diamond necklace and thought that this could aide in finding out what happened to the diamond.
Rose Dewitt Bukater a 101 year old woman calls Brock and identifies the girl in the picture. Together they return to the salvage site.  The movie then switches back to 1912 when Rose was 17 years old and she tells Brock how she came to be on the Titanic.
Rose tells how she was to marry a rich, obnoxious snob, Cal Hockley,that was arranged by her mother Ruth Dewitt Bukater in order to save her from becoming penniless.  Also boarding the ship was Jack Dawson a young man that won a third class ticket minutes before the ship was to sail during a poker game.
Jack notices Rose while she was standing on the first class deck and later comes to her rescue when she was attempting to end her life. From that moment on, Rose and Jack began a love affair.  They continued to sneak around secretly to meet.  From all the time that they spent together, Cal  became very upset and decided to seek revenge on Jack.  Cal falsely accused Jack of stealing a diamond from him that led to Jack being arrested.
As the movies continues the Titanic hits an iceberg, which causes the ship to sink.  As the passengers are evacuating, Rose is desperately searches for the man that she has fallen in love with ""Jack"".  Together they go into the ocean on a piece of wood, waiting to be rescued.  But as faith has it, the wood is only big enough for one of them and Jack sacrifices his life in order to save the life of the women he loves ""Rose"".

131714,4,0792151712,"Should a film be faulted for being the all-time most commercially successful production ever? Should we begrudge the fact that millions of teenagers watch it to see Leonardo DiCaprio, and perhaps Kate Winslett? Or that the movie's theme is a sappy love song sung by pop diva Celine Dion?
From where I'm sitting, no. Titanic just happens to be immensely popular, and those who have difficulty swallowing that and consistently bash this film are likely the same snobs who hate DiCaprio and refuse to be identified with the swooning teenagers and all others who comprise the unsophisticated ""pop"" crowd.
I wouldn't want to be either (ok, I'm a snob too), but the sheer spectacle of this movie simply cannot be ignored. Consider: James Cameron virtually recreated the Titanic, constructing sets that duplicated the ill-fated ship's interiors down to the last detail. In the early part of the film, he actually takes us to the site of the disaster and explores the innermost chambers of the real Titanic. The costuming, too, was flawless, and as if that weren't enough, Cameron picked actors who actually looked like the real people who went on that maiden voyage. How can anybody deny Cameron the credit he deserves, with all the hard work he put into this film?
But beyond production design and casting, and even beyond being a disaster flick and a love story, this film is a very insightful social commentary. The arrogance, snobbishness, and frivolity of the upper class are so effectively put into perspective here, never more so than when Ruth Dewitt Bukater asks, even as the ship is sinking, ""Will the lifeboats be seated according to class?"" After her rebellious daughter Rose berates her, saying ""Half the people on this ship are going to die,"" Cal Hockley retorts, ""Not the better half.""
Particularly noteworthy is the noveau riche Molly Brown, who proves to be the kindhearted member of the upper class. Not surprisingly, she is the one who, in the eyes of her fellow-first class passengers, does not belong.
Those who regard this social commentary aspect as a mere footnote to the entire film have missed a very important point. Without this element, the love story that takes place between Jack Dawson and Rose would be ultimately meaningless. The role that social class played in determining who would be saved and who would not would likewise go unnoticed.
And that would have been the real disaster.
If Titanic is popular for all the wrong reasons, there is really nothing we can do about that. But please, let's give credit where credit is due. It may not be a great film, but it is a very good film. For all the right reasons.",1057190400,3,2640,4.842920353982301
131715,3,0792151712,"I, too, like a much earlier poster read the book A Night To Remember.  This was a truly touching book.  It broke down the entire tragedy.  I found it particularly sad that the band kept playing, trying to keep the people calm.  I think what did it was the ship being ""unsinkable even by God.""  Don't test the Master!!
I also saw a movie w/Clifton Webb from the 50s.  Far superior to Titanic.  I think Titanic's biggest problem was that the love story dominated the ENTIRE THREE HOURS!!  That is just too long.  My first time seeing it was at a sleepover and I fell asleep. I just didn't feel up to watching the second tape.  We all went to sleep and woke up the next morning and finished it.
I am not down for overly sappy stories.  Especially when it's fiction added to tragedy.  I don't think the actual tragedy was held high enough in this flick.
My fellow reviewers have done a good job of getting the point across already.  If you want to see a real Titanic story, see teh Clifton Webb version.  You won't be disappointed.",1056412800,2,1027,4.336842105263158
131716,5,0792151712,"Okay, the DVD is a bit dissapointing for a film of this magnitude (it is the highest grossing film nation-wide and WORLD-wide to date!!), however, the movie itself is simply stunning!!  Titanic is STILL (after all these years) one of my favorite movies.  From the moment I first saw it in the theaters I knew that this film was ""special"".  Very few movies have been able to leave me in *awe* minutes, and even HOURS after watching them.  However Titanic takes the cake.  It touched so many people of many different ages, backgrounds, races, genders, etc...that it's completely a phenomenon.  I don't know many people who have NOT seen this movie, or who have not at least HEARD of the movie ""Titanic"". This movie was able to capture the horrific incident of what actually happened on April (15th was it??) 1912.  The attention to historical detail, and accuracy is where I really give James Cameron two thumbs up!  If only you KNEW how much hard work and effort went into making this film as accurate as possible, I don't think that half of the negative comments would be on this board today. Even the actors in the film actually LOOKED like some of the REAL historical figures on that ship!  The resemblance is uncanny!  They went out of their way to find GOOD actors who actually resembled those historical people.
I think those that criticize this movie to no end have really REALLY missed the point of this film.  Before this film came out, I had only read about the Titanic disaster in books in elementary school!  After that, I didn't pay a single bit of attention to it,neither did I fully grasp just how AWFUL this tragedy was.  I couldn't really put myself in an event that had happened way before even my grandmother was born!  hahah..  HOWEVER, after seeing Titanic...I now have a deeper appreciation for the lives that were lost and for the ship itself. I literally cried during some of the end parts of this movie.  It really made me think.  ""What would I have done if I were in this similar situation??""  LEt's face it, this movie touched lives...many people.
I think that the people who incessantly bash this movie are just doing so because it was so huge.",1056067200,2,2171,4.609375
131717,5,0792151712,"James Cameron's 1997 Titanic is, of course, the biggest box office hit of all time, edging out such blockbuster films as E.T., Star Wars, and Jurassic Park for that title. This film, with its tale of star-crossed lovers Rose and Jack intertwined with the real-life tragedy of the Royal Mail Steamer Titanic, won 11 Academy Awards and the loyalty of its millions of fans.
In 1997, though, no one involved in its making (except maybe the determined Cameron himself) believed this movie would float to box office glory. It was so ambitious and so expensive that not one but two studios (Paramount and 20th Century Fox) financed it, splitting the distribution rights and spending over $200,000,000 to recreate the fatal maiden voyage of the 1912 world's largest ocean liner. Yet Cameron, who had previously directed the first two Terminator movies, The Abyss, and True Lies, was proven correct when world-wide audiences embraced this touching and technically brilliant movie.
Yes, this first movie to reap $1 billion in box office gross did capture the hearts of millions of teenage girls who repeated screenings to see Leonardo DiCaprio's Jack Dawson woo Kate Winslet's feisty socialite (and soon-to-be-wed) Rose. And while many detractors scoff at this admittedly clichd poor-boy-meets-rich-girl love story, it is exactly through this pairing that we get a feel for what it was like to travel at sea in those Gilded Era days before the First World War destroyed the old Europe forever.
This film has much going for it. It has, in addition to actual location shots of the real Titanic wreck (the minisub sequence is NOT special effects), a winsome couple, a classic mustache-twirling villain (Billy Zane) with the usual henchman (a menacing David Warner), a great supporting cast which includes Danny Nuccio, Bernard Fox (who used to guest star in TV series such as Hogan's Heroes and Bewitched), Kathy Bates, Bill Paxton (who has appeared in most of Cameron's movies) and Gloria Stuart (who plays the older Rose Dawson). Titanic also has a great musical score and incredible visuals: the sinking of the great liner is certainly realistic - even if the CGI effects are a bit artificial-looking. This picture certainly was difficult to make .... Thankfully, in spite of the media hype and negative publicity, Titanic proved to be a good and entertaining film. I recommend it to anyone who likes love stories or epic disaster films. This movie mixes both genres very well.",1055635200,,2467,5.049019607843137
131758,5,0792151712,"Titanic, James Cameron's 1997 hit starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, is one of my favorite romantic movies of all time. This film, set aboard the doomed ocean liner Titanic in April of 1912, is both sad and moving.
The media pundits speculated Cameron's $200 million epic would cause his downfall; signaling the end of blockbusters films and sink Paramount Studios just as fast as the Titanic sunk on April 14, 1912! How wrong they were in that conclusion! Not only were the media pundits  proven wrong, but Titanic made over $1 billion in the global box-office receipts (due to some viewing the movie more than once at the movies). Titanic surpassed all the previous box-office hits to become the number 1 box-office hit of all time.
The movie is a disaster and love story in one, in my opinion. Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), two star-crossed lovers that met on board ship, fell in love and crossed what then were vast class differences. The other actors in the move where great in the parts they played ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown (Kathy Bates),  Cal Hockley, Rose's cold and rude fianc (Billy Zane) and the many others. When you see them going through what they went through you won't come away from watching it dry eyed.
 The cinematography was superb, with each scene it was as you were there on board the ship looking and being a part of what was going on from the grand ballroom and dining area in First Class to the crowded and squalid  Third Class steerage where many Irish and other foreign immigrants were going to America hoping for a better life for themselves and their families.
Not only did Titanic win 11 Academy Awards (including Best Picture, Director and Dramatic Score by James Horner), but Titanic's best selling musical score was the first soundtrack to reach the No. 1 slot on the Billboard charts in two decades. Celine Dion's ""My Heart Will Go On"" will bring tears to your eyes, making you think of what Rose and Jack were going through as the tragedy unfolds on the ill-fated voyage. This finely honed piece craftsmanship by James Horner who has tackled musically adventuresome projects in his career including scores for Apollo 13, Clear and Present Danger, Patriot Games and Star Trek II: the Wrath of Khan.
For me, this movie will be an enduring and classic love story for years to come.",1055116800,5,2344,4.7518427518427515

131760,4,0792151712,"Of course everyone knows the story of the world's biggest cruise liner that sunk on April 14, 1912 after hitting an iceberg. In 1997, James Cameron had spent over $200 Million dollars into creating one of the greatest disaster movies of all time. This movie is the best out of the many other films about Titanic that captured the scare, the disaster and the special effects like no other. The movie provided an excellent cast and crew.
The movie starts out in the present day when some explorers are 12,000 deep in the Atlantic Ocean looking at the famous ship's grave. Then they find a drawing of a woman that they show on TV and the actual woman, Rose Calvert calls them and she goes out to their ship and tells her story of Titanic.
Now we travel back to 1912 and it is half and hour before Titanic's departure from Southampton, England. Inside a bar are four men playing poker with Titanic tickets as the bet. The main guy, Jack Dawson (DiCapprio) wins and aboards the ship in third class. In first class is Rose (Winslet) and her rude and rich fiance Cal (Billy Zane). The two meet and start to fall in love. Now they become extremely attached to one another and here is where the events start to hit the fan.
At about 11:15 PM the two are kissing on the front deck of the ship when the Titanic hits the Iceberg. Now the ship is going to sink. PANIC EVERYWHERE! Even worse. THERE AREN'T ENOUGH LIFE BOATS FOR EVERYONE! Half the people on the ship are going to die. Now the two are stuck on the boat without any lifeboats left along with the other 1,500 people.
The effects of the ship sinking are utterly amazing. From the boats near by the people witness half the ship sticking out of the water at a 60 degree angle in total distress, shock and tears. Then finally the lights go out. Total darkness with a ship sinking. Imagine that. Then the SHIP SPLITS IN HALF!!! The back half of the ship falls hundreds on feet back down onto the water. We see the people on the stern holding on as they fall backwards. Then the boat finally breaks apart and the back half is on a complete vertical angle. Oh, my God!
See what'll happens next. Who survives out of the 1,500 that were left in the freezing water after Titanic was finally gone? Will Jack and Rose survive (Remember, they're in that water too)? Purchase the movie that made everyone travel back to 1912 and experience that horrifying night. The shipwreck of the world's greatest ship...TITANIC.",1052697600,2,2451,4.461024498886414
131761,4,0792151712,"Dicappio and Winslet may not have the depth necessary for their parts. The director's treatment in these respects may not carry too much weight and as such the movie may not be as convincing as some would have expected. But as a commercial film this is a big success.
The story itself may well be a true reflection of what had actually transpired. The director started the film with a recent exploration of the sunken Titanic leading the viewers deep into the ocean to be followed by an interview with the 102 years old survivor, Rose, the heroine of the movie, to make it ring as true as a documentary.
The grandeur of Titanic was particularly well captured. The life of the upper class life on board was convincingly conveyed. Even the life of the lower class was well portrayed, and when things are not quite unrealistic, they have good purposes to serve, touching up the general atmostphere making it more juicy... etc.
The two contrasting scenes, the dinner party of the upper class and the party of the poor were well handled. These are one of the mosting exciting part of the movie. The Captain, who was so convinced and so proud of the unsinkability of the ship and then the musicians who hung on till the last minute... they are so telling and touching. The rhythm of the movie is quite fast and never boring.

131763,5,0792151712,"1997: We remember Titanic. The ""ship of dreams"" set sail from England to New York in 1912. It sank after striking an iceberg. Although many lost their lives, there were some survivors who recall with nostalgia, with sorrow, with a plethora of feelings and images the terrible disaster. One such woman is Gloria Stuart's character, Rose DeWitt Bucator. James Cameron directed a blockbuster, which earned him Best Picture and became the most popular film of the late 90's. And it all revolves around the elderly 100 plus Rose, remembering her lost love, Jack Dawson (Leonardo Dicaprio in his greatest and most memorable role). She says, ""He saved me, in every way a woman can be saved."" Although it is Jack who loses his life, he has made it possible for the ill-at-ease Rose to break away from the gilded cage of her loveless engagement with Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) and the pretentious society he is part of.
This film on DVD is the theatrical experience all over again. We genuinely root for the perfect couple that Jack and Rose are, we dislike the villainous, self-centered Cal Hockley. The romance takes up most of the first half of the film, embellished with the luxury of the ship's upper class dinner halls and ballroom. Authentic period costumes of the Edwardian era enhance the characters and their way of life. For example, Rose is trapped in a world built solely on appearances, on subjugation of women to be ornaments on their husband's arm. The wealthy elitists on the ship are pretentious and hypocritical (one of the aristocrats is even flaunting his mistress while his wife is at home with the children). The exception is the newly rich Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) who came from a humble Ozark life to newly acquired fortune made by the discovery of oil-  these events are pretty much told in the musical ""Molly Brown"", herself based on a true survivor of the ship. She was a pleasant, unpretentious, caring, humorous noble woman whose spirit was as they said ""unsinkable."" Kathy Bates' portrayal of Molly Brown is quite enjoyable, as she seems to be the only noble and heroic and less hypocritical of the upper class people. Below deck, the lower classes are an earthy bunch, drinking beer, playing fiddles and trying to make the best of things.
We know what happens in the last half of the movie. Enhanced with striking, visceral effects and lots of water, the ship sinks in the middle of the Atlantic. Rose lives to tell her tale. The movie is a beautiful tale of survival, heartache and passion. Few films come that way. Nowadays, the love story between Jack and Rose may seem to sentimental and too unrealistic for some. But we know better.",1052092800,10,2659,4.7678958785249455
131764,2,0792151712,"Titanic is the cinematic equivalent of a pop-up fairy tale book for children, complete with cardboard characters and a plot that would be laughed out of Junior High. Its story and cast of Ogres and Heroes could be described as cartoon-like but somehow manages to be more two-dimensional and is so drawn-out that it seems the voyage is filmed in real time. It's astonishing popularity I can only credit to a world wide stupidity epidemic, perhaps passed on by ship's rats.
We start shipping water right from the start with the introduction of `Jack', the main protagonist. He is dressed in period garb but may as well have stepped out of a rap video for all the sense of 1912 he conveys. He sleeps rough every night yet manages to wash his blond hair daily. Funny about that. The rest of the crew and guests resemble nothing more than ones and zeros in the shimmering computer simulation we know the ship to be.
But hark! A lookout has spied something huge heaving into view - the iceberg, the real star of the movie, appearing at last? Alas no, it's James Cameron's ego steaming toward us, bent on wreaking havoc below the waterline. Armed with his deathly dialogue and with no way to pump out the bilge water of his drama fast enough, there is no escape and we are doomed to slide beneath the cold dark waves.",1051833600,8,1310,4.531645569620253
131765,5,0792151712,"Alright, I can't help it.  I have to say something.  I have read a bunch of these reviews and I am disgusted.  This is a movie that honors the sinking of the Titanic.  1500+ lost their lives and all some of these people can say is ""I just wanted the ship to sink so that it would be over"" or ""What a waste of money"".  These people are ignorant and unsympathetic.  ""Titanic"" allows the moviegoers of today to see the horrors that people went through on that night.  This is a movie that I can't watch often because it is so emotional and tragic.  It is a movie that puts the values of life, love, heroism, loss, and death into perspective. I can remember leaving the theater and just forgetting about all the nonsense of everyday life and looking at everything from a different point of view.
My other problem with some of these reviews is that they say that the love story is horrible.  I personally thought that it was very well crafted and I think that some people forget that the romance gives us the characters to become emotionally attached to through the film.  We can then appreciate the tragedy because the people on the titanic are no longer strangers.  They are real people who we care about.  The professional critics, by the way, are so funny to me.  Some call the public ""dumb"" and ""easily manipulated"" for liking this film.  Get over yourselves.  I've never seen a critic that has written, directed, or starred in a film.  I know i'ts their job, but why can't people just like something?  Why are we stupid for liking a movie?  Give me a break.
Now, my own review of this movie is that it is very well-made and extremely emotional.  The movie is fantastic.  The music is phenomenal and could tell the story by itself.  This is a film that touched me emotionally and made me feel as though I was there on that sinking ship.  James Cameron put a lot of heart into this movie and it shows.
For those people with the ""Titanic [stinks]"" reviews, I think you missed the whole point and definitely missed out on a powerful film.",1051660800,12,2035,4.413978494623656
131766,5,0792151712,"The other day I was thinking that, if I would put together all the times I have watched Titanic, I would spend almost three consecutive days in front of the TV. Some may think I'm crazy, some may think I'm a fool, but I want to explain the reasons for watching Titanic over 20 times.
In fact, Titanic is more than a simple story. It's three stories sewn together in the same fabric: the story of the gigantic ship and its tragedy, the love story between a poor american boy trying to return to his home and the newly-impovered, high-class, bold british girl, and finally the story of the forgotten treasure hidden under four kilometers of ocean in Titanic's remains.
Of course, ""Titanic"" should concentrate more on the ship's story. But then we would have a documentary. In my opinion, James Cameron was very intelligent, focusing the attention of the viewers on the water-and-sugar love story between Leonardo diCaprio and Kate Winslet, and the overworked ""struggle between classes"" theme, just to mesmerize them with the fantastic technical and historical production related to the sinking-process scenes.
Of course, the movie has its flaws, mainly the partly obvious and cliche-plenty script, and the slightly below average acting by the main trio diCaprio, Winslet and Billy Zane. But think about it: Titanic's true story was nothing new. Titanic foundered in 1912. The movie was made in 1997. So, when it was released, the true story of  ""Titanic"" was 85 years old. I.E., ""Titanic"" raised almost US$ 2 BILLION with a story in which EVERYBODY knew what would happen at the end. This must mean something.
What I'm trying to say is that there are stories that must be told. I know that some people hate Hollywood's millionaire movie industry, and give all their cheers to independent, low budget, scoreless danish movies. But some stories, some movies, have to be told using a Hundreds-million dollar budget, and ""Titanic"" was one of those stories.  I'm not ""against"" Hollywood, I'm not ""against"" independent low-budget movies. I'm against, fervorously against, for example, a Sylvester Stallone terrible movie that has cost over 50 million dollars (say, ""Get Carter""). I'm against  boring, meaningless independent movies, made famous by Hollywood-hating people that in fact have fun just ""being against"" something or other.
Movies are meant to be entertainment. To me, each time I watched ""Titanic"" I got over 150 minutes of entertainment. That's what I wanted, period.

I am so thankful I responded to that sudden urge because this is truly the most moving motion picture I have ever seen.  I immediately fell in love with every single thing about it, even the love story of Jack and Rose.  I know this film cost a fortune and took forever to make, but every cent James Cameron spent was worth it.  Titanic is incredible.  There were really no Jack and Rose onboard the ship on the night it went down, but their story opens our hearts to the real story of that great tragedy, the fact that hundreds and hundreds of very real people from all walks of life suffered and died in the frigid waters of the North Atlantic.  When we think of some of the lives that were lost, we too often see them not as people but as myths-the unsinkable Molly Brown, Captain Smith, the scoundrel Ismay, John Jacob Astor, the Guggenheims, the musicians on deck, etc.  In this epic, we see the humanity of everyone on board, from the first class passengers to the third class folks below deck to the hard-working men in the pits of the ship who bravely kept the lights on for so long in the face of certain death.  This motion picture reinforces the humanity of every soul lost, for that is where the real tragedy lies.
Some people don't like the love story in the film, but I found it magical.  DiCaprio, as much as I hate to admit it, is an incredibly talented actor, but it is really Kate Winslet who shines the brightest in my eyes.  The complexity of Rose, engaged to wealth and status but yearning for something real that cannot be bought, calls out to the humanity in all of us, and we delight in her forbidden romance with the poor and socially inferior Jack Dawson, ready to take up arms ourselves against her rogue of a fianc&eacute; and his dastardly henchman.  Some of the purity of this love was lost for me inside the car in the storage room, but no one can deny the power of Rose's love for Jack when she sacrifices her own survival to stay by his side.  This is the kind of all-encompassing love we all seek but a rare few of us ever find.
Equally powerful is the extraordinary presentation of the Titanic's final hour.  One feels as if he is actually there feeling the shudders as the iceberg rips through the great ship's hull, detecting the list of the decks as the front section begins to settle under water, watching with fascinating unbelief the water as it begins its climb from the lower to upper decks, getting a sense of the complete and utter panic that ensues once Titanic's fate becomes clear to all onboard, and watching numbly from afar as the smokestacks break off, the hull splits, and the fractured ship dives beneath the waves en route to its eternal resting place.  The surreal aspect of it all, with the music playing in the background while brave men say a final goodbye to their wives and children in the lifeboats and less fortunate men, women, and children stop to embrace death in whatever way they can, is truly magical and tugs at the heart-strings of anyone professing to be human.
The incredible music accompanying this film is also intensely moving, whether it is reinforcing the passion of true love newly found or lamenting the tragedy of souls lost.  If the love story and tragedy do not bring tears to your eyes, the extraordinary music will.  I wonder how many men in particular sat through all of the closing credits in the theatre hoping their tears would dry before the lights came back on.  The ending is to my eyes absolutely perfect and truly beautiful.  This movie affects me greatly no matter how many times I have already watched it.  I hope that some of those individuals vowing never to watch Titanic will reconsider their decision; I feel sure that many unbelievers would find themselves as captivated and completely in love with this motion picture as I am upon experiencing it.",1043452800,7,4070,4.489159891598916
131839,4,0792151712,"The special effects were really touted as being top-notch. I beg to differ. I think they were just okay. They were better on a large screen in the theater, but still not great.
The story, although fairly well known, is still pretty captivating. The romance factor is not overdone, so it is tolerable for even most hardened viewers. Still, it may be a tear-jerker for some, making it a good ""date"" movie.",1042761600,,403,4.611111111111111
131840,2,0792151712,"This was a fairly good disaster movie but a TERRIBLE romance movie, and did not deserve most of the Oscars that it received.  Giving the movie its due, it is an ambitious attempt to portray the historical events upon which it is based in a comprehensive and realistic way.  This is the SECOND half of the movie.  The first half is a sub-standard, over-hyped, insubstantial, unoriginal and utterly predictable romance that drags the movie out about an hour longer than it ought to be.  It takes the tired old theme of the little rich girl being swept off of her feet by the working-class hero, adds NOTHING, casts a fairly talented actress (Kate Winslet) in the role of the ing&eacute;nue and an over-hyped hack (Leonardo DiCaprio) in the role of the working-class hero, and overlays it into the historical context.  If you're interested in a romance, there are far better and far more original romance movies available (Captain Correlli's Mandolin, The English Patient, and A Walk In The Clouds to name a few) that you should consider.  If you are interested in the movie for its depiction of the sinking of the Titanic, it is admittedly the best portrayal of the event.  However, do yourself a BIG favor and skip everything between the point when the captain orders the ship to full speed ahead and the point just before the ship strikes the iceberg.  I guarantee that you can easily guess everything that happens in between, and it actually makes it a much better movie.",1042675200,2,1472,4.745098039215686

The love story added in was pretty good, but that's not the reason I liked the movie so much. I am just obsessed with the Titanic! This movie tells the story of not only the two young lovers but also of the ship and what really happened. The 5 Stars that I gave were for the movie, but I have to say that the DVD itself was really really bad! There were no special features except for a theatrical trailer for this movie. They should have made this a 2 DVD set with behind the scenes footage, the specials run on various television channels and a walk through of the Titanic tour with all of the props and stuff. I saw that in Great America and thought it was very cool. Why didn't they do a mini tour of it and show it in the DVD? Besides those complaints about the DVD, the movie is awesome and a 5 Star flick. I watched it again this morning for a total of 4 times, 2 in the theater, 1 on the VHS edition, and 1 on the DVD edition. This is pretty much the VHS edition but with a trailer and only 1 disk.

I've seen it repeatedly, but only on video and DVD, not theatrically, where I would imagine it would be even more spectacular. But more than that, as a novelist and screenwriter myself, I ADMIRE James Cameron's script. Using footage of the ACTUAL wreck itself is emotional enough, when, with Gloria Stuart's narration, he dissolves into the past when the ship was new and mighty. The personal story of the girl who's looking for meaning in her life and the guy who helps her find it before they're both caught in unimaginable tragedy is something we all can relate to... The sequence of the ship's collision with the iceberg -- the frantic calls to the bridge, the shutting of the watertight doors and the men rushing to escape, everything -- is one of the finest and most exciting sequences I've ever seen. The special effects? I've never seen better in ANYTHING ...My only quibble is with the lack of extras on the DVD. While I'm glad to see the trailer, this is one DVD that SCREAMS for a making-of documentary -- who wouldn't want to know how it was done? Wish they'd added it! My quibble with the film? Nothing.

He also depicted with terrible reality the horror of being in the middle of a freezing ocean, no way of escape & knowing your fate of doom. The poor children dying. It was so very sad.

131940,1,0792151712,"Though I can understand why this film appealed to so many and I can even applaud its technical merits, I am still bewildered at those who claim it is ""one of the greatest films of all time."" Just as bewildering is the fact that it won so many Academy Awards and even beat out ""L.A. Confidential,"" quite possibly the best film on the '90's, for the Best Picture award.
What you have hear is a film that capitalizes on a tragic disaster, with a script that caters to lovesick teenagers.  Put Leonardo di Caprio in the lead role and you've got more than your fairshare of lovesick girls stomping over one another to see this film over and over.  And guys get to see Kate Winslet's bare breasts....(one of the few parts of the film I enjoyed).
Artistically and technically, it is a spectacle..I'll give it that! And Billy Zane, as the ""evil"" side of the love triangle is excellent.  But the script is so by the numbers and routine!
It's simple- poor but handsome and talented boy meets wealthy, rebellious, sexy socialite girl.  PRoblem is, she's engaged. And, of course, she doesn't want to be!  One thing leads to another, they get to know eachother, and she loses her virginity in the backseat of a car (how many times have we seen this?).  Fiancee gets wind of it, gets angry, tries to kill the young man. An iceberg beats him to it. Boy saves girl, sacrifices his own life. She lives to a ripe old age and never forgets him.
See what I mean? THIS won dozens of awards and the praise of critics worldwide? I can't help but scratch my head at this.  Have moviegoing audiences become so conditioned to accept rubbish and think its amazing?
If you are in the mood for a 3 hour, mindless, overly-sentimental spectacle, then this is the film for you....If not, do yourself a favor and pass!",1040083200,15,1785,4.473846153846154

NEVER SHOULD HAVE WON BEST PICTURE. I saw many movies from that year that deserved best picture, and this wasn't one of them. This movie was horrible. I wasted 3 hours of my life watching this movie. I laughed when Leo died.
  What the hell was James Cameron thinking? Stick to action, that is what you are good at. I must agree with T.V. guide:
  ""This DVD proves that James Cameron kicked ( it ) pre-TITANIC.""

132002,1,0792151712,"Sitting in the dark theater, surrounded by sniffles and cries, I had to bury my face in my hands to control my laughter.  Sure, the effects were great, but that is not enough to carry a story, no matter how emotional the actual occurences were.  From the beginning I could not ""suspend my disbelief"" enough to buy that our heroine, Rose, was cutting edge enough to mesmorize everyone with her knowledge of Picasso and Freud, let alone be able to freely run around the ship with hero Jack, escaping from the lower decks when other were forced to die.
I was supposed to buy that these two people found some incredible and enduring love, yet they experienced little more than a one night stand.  I think this assessment is justified when Rose shoves Jack's dead body off a raft at the end.  That's when the uncontrollable laughter started.  I was so aware that this was an act of fiction I couldn't find any symbolism in the act or further acts conducted by the aged Rose.
For this movie to be truly ""epic"" or great, why not focus on one of the real stories?  Why not learn more about the mother who tucks her children into bed, knowing they will die, while the two fools somehow escape the locked deck?  Why not star the older couple who lay on the bed together, holding hands, fearfully awaiting death?  These people had real relationships longer than a few days.
What burns me is that this movie won Oscars when LA Confidential came out the same year.
If you want to see something romantic and heartbreaking, I would recommend The Lover over this.  At least in The Lover the vast majority of the movie is dedicated to the development of the relationship, and character and relationship development is all that matters in heart wrenching material.

People say that they don't want to watch a film whose outcome is well known.  (The sinking.)  But Cameron has taken a tragic situation, and shown it to us, so we can learn, and grieve.
The characters are wonderful, and the acting extraordinary.  Of course, there is no proof the actual characters existed, but they certainly could have, or something similar, and it was a brilliant showcase to the other real stories on the ship.

This film won best picture but I can guarantee you it was mostly due to the graphics that were, at the time, way beyond anything we'd seen before.
Leo is depressing. That's right, he's flat out depressing. I felt bad for him and the overacting job he does in this snooze fest. To think that Babwa Walwa's(also known as Barbara Walters) considered Leo one of ""Hollywood's most powerful men!""  HA. The only thing powerful about Leo's perfomance in this film was his triumphant ability to make me fall asleep.  I tell you the truth, most of my incoherant, sleeping pill induced dreams possess more imagination than Titanic.
You want plot? Okay, in case you skipped Fourth Grade History or missed out on Common Knowledge 101, we have a big ship. It sinks, a bunch of people fall off like ping pong balls, and most of them die. Of course, we get to see a love triangle in the meantime and eventually witness poor Leo sacrificing everything - including his common sense - in order to save the one he loves. End of film. Sound nice? Well it is, if you like Chick Flicks and Leo. The only thing I liked about the fabricated portions of this film was the end where Leo meets the cold, harsh Atlantic Ocean and....well, I don't want to spoil it for you.
Buyer beware: this film is a complete and total chick flick. It spends over 80% of itself focusing on the love triangle and please note: it's perhaps the most nightmarish love triangle ever, excluding the one in Pearl Harbor of course. If that's not enough, you will hear Celine Deon(spelling) sing the song that made her what she is today! Oh, the humanity!!

When I bought Titanic, the movie sailed away into my heart, I even burst into tears at the end and that does not happen often when I watch a movie. Titanic is truly ""the ship of dreams"".
 I floated away into the era of pure granduer and magic as Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio lit up the screen as Jack and Rose, two young lovers who are absolutely crazy for each other. However, love is hard sometimes. Rose's spirit, compared to that of a wild horse roaming the plains, is what draws herself towards Jack, who really thinks she is the greatest girl in the the world.
 The sunset is my favorite scene where Rose cries out ""I'm flying"" before she and Jack engage in the most endearing kiss.
 The Titanic then hits a lone iceburg one night.  The scenes are emotional, filled with pure terror, bitterness, and the ever-lasting screams of the dying.  Fifteen hundred will die.  Along with the sinking comes thrilling chases and hardness of envy.  When the ship sinks, Rose and Jack fight for survial, but in the end their love is star-crossed and Jack dies, but at least they are together again after death.

Jack and Rose protray two mismatched lovers that break the rules according to class. There are several aspects that one can look at this movie:  The cast of the show are diverse and some seem to believe that Jack was to young for Rose, however, I liked their chemistry on the screen. Secondly, the issues that were playing out in regards to the snobbery of the people that were on board especially when the collison occurred, and how there were many things go wrong resulting in a greater number of loss of life due to this aspect. Such as not filling the boats to their capacity because the people were selecting just the upper class, then Rose's mother even being so bold as to say that out loud saying that the boat should be seated according to class. The main idea of the boasting was that the ship absolutely could not sink. Then there was the speeding up of the boat just to show off by the one man that eventually jumped into the life boat ahead of women and children to be saved. There there was the tragedy itself of losing so many people in the water that night.
Now to pull all three of these aspects and have it play so smoothly, was wonderful. Having all that water to deal with was spectacular.
Of course, my own opinion was that the likeness to the Edwardian period was so perfect even down to the last detail. I really enjoyed that.
Lastly, to have such a long movie, it was separated porportionately as to keep the audience interested in the love story, the action, and the tragedy all at the same time, I do give it four stars. Well done.",1035244800,,1706,4.43312101910828

Eventually a treasure chest is found which leads to a 101 year old woman, who tells an interesting story.
Gloria Stuart (Rose DeWitt), was aboard the Titanic 84 years ago.  Rose, a rich and beautiful woman, falls in love with Leonardo DiCaprio (Jack Dawson), a poor but attractive yound man.

James Cameron built an exact replica of the original Titanic using all the exquist iron laced work, priceless artwork, exact costumes of the 1912 era, and many other realistic details that helps to draw a person into the story making you feel as if you were on the Titanic at the time it hit the iceberg.",1035244800,11,1333,4.646808510638298
132045,4,0792151712,"Granted, teenage girls went nuts over this film due to a sappy love story, but give TITANIC its due.  Utilizing state-of-the-art CGI and a relentless attention to detail, James Cameron successfully captures the human tragedy of April 15, 1912, when over fifteen hundred people perished in the icy waters of the North Atlantic.
Look beyond the contrived ""poor-boy-meets-rich-girl"" love story (wow, like that's never been done before), and even the annoying class warfare pitting the noble, hardworking poor against the arrogant, greedy rich (standard staple from the Hollywood left).  Focus instead on the numbing pathos of this disaster, which really happened.  Cameron brings the sheer terror of the event to the screen in all of its tragic dimensions, from husbands and wives being separated to countless bodies floating face down in frigid waters.  The magnitude of the tragedy, of the largest luxury liner in the world sinking on its maiden voyage, is vividly conveyed.
Incidentally, Billy Zane stands out wonderfully from an otherwise mediocre cast, but the strength of this film is not in its characters, but in the actual disaster itself.",1034812800,3,1145,5.274725274725275
132046,2,0792151712,"There are so many reviews already, I need not go into much here. I am 40 yrs. old, mom to a 19, 10, and 4 yr. old. For 12 years we did not own a TV. It was a blessing in many ways, to be sure. Last year, we decided to get a video player (still no TV, still a blessing!), the main reason being I wanted to see some documentary videos on Elvis, whom I was studying at the time(I am not an Elvis fan; my mother was).Anyway, we then went through the Alfred Hitchcock classics, studying those, and recently I have discovered Fredric March (a GREAT actor, most popular in the 30's and 40's)and so now I have been studying Fredric films, and have seen over 35 to date. We love the old classics best, and waste little time on modern cinema offerings...so why did we watch the Titanic video?
Well, my mom, the Elvis fan, died 2 yrs. ago and my 19 yr. old brought home her Titanic video, even though at the time  we had no way to watch it. Finally, last night, I felt like seeing it, to see what the hype was all about (also I am out of Fredric March movies right now!)back in 1997.
Overall: my opinion is that while it wasn't HORRIBLE or AWFUL or anything similar as other reviewers have called it, it wasn't really good either. It was just ""okay"".  I don't think modern movies can even come close to the old classics that Hollywood gave us back in the 30's, 40's, and 50's. Why?  It's hard to describe...there was more decency, more class, something. Sure, there were bad films and acting jobs back then too, but I don't think modern actors and actresses have what it takes anymore. In saying this, I go to Leo and Kate...I felt they were very shallow in their acting, I felt they were miscast. They were too modern, even in period clothes. Leo is not the romantic, manly, leading man the film needed. Kate was not the woman to portray the inner beauty, the inner turmoil, that I think the Rose character needed. Her hair color was VERY awful to me...honestly, it distracted me a lot during the movie! It was just too weird. Because these 2 were miscast, and because their acting abilities were lacking in depth and sincerity, I could not feel for them in the film, hope for them, or anything. And a good film is supposed to get you into the heart of the characters, and get you caring for them. None of this happened for me with Leo and Kate. I felt the characters on the whole were not developed...I think it would have helped to know more about Cal, and why he was as he was, and why he and Kate had gone this far in a relationship. I felt the supporting cast were not very good actors either...Molly Brown could have had a lot of potential, but it seemed the actress was not into the heart and skin of her character...like she was just parroting lines. I am not trying to be unkind here...I just feel disapointed when the characters appear as actors and do not become the characters. The only supporting actor who I felt ""became"" his character was Victor Garbor, who played Thomas Andrews. You could feel his feelings along with him. And along with this, I say that the dialog seemed too modern for the most part...the people spoke 90's lingo a lot. Better writing would have helped here.
I was mildly offended at the crude language throughout this film...believe me, you CAN enjoy a film without everyone speaking gutter language. I couldn't believe even old Rose had a bad mouth! The bad language was a negative to this film. I also did not feel the nudity was necessary...Kate was beautiful, but noone but her husband and doctor need to see it! I did not appreciate the sex scene either...was totally not needed and anyway it was not like their love was beautiful and pure...it seemed just a lust thing, a heat of the moment thing, a ""let's do this because it's exciting"" thing. A man who really loves will wait to be married before becoming physically one with her. I felt their kissing was even lustful...not truly loving and meaningful like you see in the old movies. The language and the nudity/sex would keep me from letting my young children see this film, and also the scene where the one officer puts a gun to his head and kills himself.
I think the filming was pretty good...there were some good visual moments. I think it was an awsome task to film some of the scenes in this film, and the Oscars won I am sure are very well deserved.
I have read much about the Titanic, and while this film is okay, I must say I got more out of my reading, and felt more of the tragegy in my heart for the disaster through books than through this film.",1034380800,5,4545,4.351001177856301
132047,3,0792151712,"When this movie came out I was sixteen. I didn't see the movie because I didn't go to theatres and we didn't have a TV. But that didn't stop my friend and I (especially I, because I had a crush on the Leo guy) from finding pictures on the Internet, reading books about the movie, so forth and so on. Later on we found the movie in my grandma's stuff after she died and brought it home.
I've seen it now two times all the way through - once last year, once just last night.
No longer being sixteen and swayed by baby-faced leading men, I look at this movie with more mature and calm eyes and my honest opinion is, it just isn't that great. For one thing, there is too much bad language/swearing, which I don't want to hear. Everyone knows about the nude scene and the car scene. One of the officers shoots himself in the head near the end. And this movie is rated PG? Some Shirley Temple movies are rated PG and there's not a thing wrong with them! I mean get a grip - this should be R!
As for the characters - Rose's hair (something my mother pointed out and which really bugged me this time) is far too red. I know that's not her natural colour because it did not look like that in Sense and Sensibility. She also wore far too much makeup. A more natural look, with her hair neatly up, would have given me a much more ""period"" feeling about her. Also she didn't have much power to me as a character because she's such a tramp. She's disrespectful, can't make up her mind what she wants. I couldn't feel much sympathy at all for her.
I couldn't really feel anything for Leo's character either. It's funny the things that appeal to you as a young weird teenager, because I see nothing now in Leo that's particularly wonderful, in looks or in acting. He didn't have what it took to make it worth Rose's running after him.
The dialogue between Rose and Jack seemed particularly strange to me as well. Except for Molly Brown, the other characters in general seemed to have a quieter, more refined way of speaking, while Jack and Rose just talked like 90's Americans. Totally wrecked the feeling.
Cal had a lot of potential as a character, but like most of the others, was sadly undeveloped. Interesting how his voice sounds a lot like James Mason's (Mason played in ""North by Northwest"", ""A Star Is Born"" with Judy Garland), something I did not notice before.
The only one of the set of main characters that evoked any feeling in me was the Thomas Andrews guy. He talked like a decent, respectable Irishman and outshone everyone else in the cast for the simple reason that he, obviously, knows how to ACT. I remember the first time I saw the movie particularly, I cried for him - not for any of the other leading characters.
Let's see what else should I say... Oh, yes, the special effects. At times I thought the moving water was no better than the old method of rear projection - it looked incredibly fake. But the sinking scenes I felt were done as well as could be done. I would agree that it was a great achievement on James Cameron's part, but it did seem like the movie was built around special effects, and everything else took second fiddle, really. Perhaps that's why the actors were so bad and the script so poor.
The music is very nice too. I still enjoy listening to my soundtrack CD sometimes, and I fell in love with I Salonisti - the group who played the first class music. (They did an excellent recording called ""And the Band Played On"" which you should listen to if you want some good music that is Titanic-related.)
I give this three stars because it isn't utterly AWFUL. I just think there is so much that this movie had the potential to be and wasn't.",1034380800,,3669,4.357664233576642
132048,1,0792151712,"""Titanic"" won so many Academy Awards, but why? Everything about it makes me sick. The direction, script, acting and music! Sirens to my ears! I was disappointed that James Cameron directed this overblown 'epic' about two lovers whose love survived the sinking of the great ship. You know what? It would've been great if Arnold Schwarzenegger was in this because he would've defeated the iceberg. Forget the two hundred year-old woman and her necklace. That's obscenity. An insanely disappointing movie!",1033776000,2,502,5.2875
132049,1,0792151712,"I have said it before, and I'll say it again, Titanic, along with Gone With The Wind are two of the most OVERATED films in history, with no plot, stupid characters, and irritating dialoge!
 Think Romeo and Juliet aboard the Titanic and that best sums up this three hour plus film.
Titanic continues to be one of the biggest movies of all time, (why on Earth did moviegoers pick this mess to be a hit?) It involves a very spoiled and irritating girl known as Rose, played by Kate Winslet, who goes aboard a state of the art ship known as the Titanic with her snotty finacee, played by Billy Zane. She doesn't care for him so she hooks up with a drifter/artist named Jack played by Leonardo DiCaprio. The majority of the film is about Jack and Rose trying to avoid her fiancee while the ship itself hits an iceberg and sinks, killing many of the passengers aboard. The reason why so many teenage girls went crazy for this film is because it has a story that only a teenage girl could love with it's simplistic dialoge and cliched characters. I was hoping by the end that Rose herself would be hit by an iceberg as her character was really becoming annoying fast!
Now, what bothers many moviegoers is that instead of being about the ship itself and the people who died, the film focuses on another silly 90210 teen romance. We have seen this type of romantic film hundreds of times before, and the romance in Titanic is about as interesting as a can of flat soda.
While there are some nice costumes, and effects work done on the sinking of the ship, audiences must endure over two and a half hours of some of the most irritating and cliched dialoge ever written (""I'm just a tumbleweed blowing through the wind?!"") as well as a lot of boredom waiting for the ship to sink. I had to be woken up by my wife when the ship sank while seeing it on DVD (I never saw it in theaters, because no film could live up to that amount of hype and after finally seeing it on DVD, I was right) Everyone I have talked to says that seeing the movie on the big screen makes a bigger difference in the special effects, well I have a HDTV big screen and that's about as close to a motion picture screen you can get watching a home video DVD.
All in all, Rose isn't a woman searching for herself, but rather a spoiled brat looking for attention, and I never related to Jack one bit. I guess the only characters who I felt any real sympathy for were the captain and the ship's designer, as the film doesn't really focus on any of the real victims of the event other than the ficticious Jack and Rose.
I enjoy some of James Cameron's films, (True Lies and Strange Days, which he wrote, are two of the best action films of the 1990's!) But, Titanic wasn't the ""classic"" many have hailed it to be!
A 1 on a scale of 1-5. If you want to see a real film about the Titanic rent the original, not this awful mess!
Sure, most teenage girls will go crazy over this, but, I'll take Good Will Hunting anyday over this mess!
The Titanic DVD has no commentaries or any other ""goodies"" found in other premium DVDs, just the standard film in widescreen format, a couple of trailers and THAT'S IT! Thank goodness me and my wife rented rather than bought this film. If you absolutely must own this film, then, wait for a deluxe version DVD with a commentary and other features first!",1033516800,3,3340,4.32695374800638

Its difficult to believe that in an age of such movie diversity, this title could be so highly recommended and praised. I must say that even my fiance, who enjoys romance films, thought Titanic was a monumental disappiontment. With all the great romances available, leave this one on the shelf and spend your money on somethign worhtwhile.

132102,1,0792151712,"In my personal opinion, this was the greatest cinemactic bastardization of an historical event ever made.
Sure it's special effects and accurate ship set were touted forever in a day when it came out, and implications were aplenty that-despite the fictional love story and all that kind of jazz-, it somehow evoked the real-life events of that fateful first-and only-voyage of the Royal Mail Steamship Titanic...but in reality the makers-historical advisers and all-didn't even come within hailing distance of the real story.  Instead they sliced open the real Titanic story, removed alot of good history that would have been excellent material for historical drama-and instead inserted an aggravatingly contrived and poorly done love story with equally aggravatingly contrived (and cliched) fictional characters.  And the real-life Titanic people that were included in the script as characters played second-fiddle to the fictional characters and were just one of the many, many misleading histoical facets of this drama.
For example: there is an outrageoulsy contrived bit of dialogue uttered in a scene more fit for a bad comic book by Second Officer Lightoller whgen he threatens passengers crowding some port side lifeboats (IIRC) with his revolver and says something like: ""Get back, or I'll shoot you down like dogs.""
It is true that Lightoller did wave his revolver at passengers that seemed about to rush the last port side lifeboat successfuly launched that night, Collapsible D, (and may have even fired it in the air once or twice), but it is extremely doubtful that he said suche cliched, tired words when he did.  Just one of the many, many misinterpreations of character that plagued the depiction of the real-life Titanic passengers & crew depicted in the movie.
""Titanic"" not only was incredibly inaccurate and absurd in some of it's vignettes (i.e. First Class passengers in the forward grand staircase as it floods, passengers foundering about in the water covering C-Deck right below the bridge like geese with their heads lopped off by sabres, plus all the horrid sequences in which Mr. DiCaprio and Miss Winslet founder about deep down inside the ship as it floods.  A stund that only would have ensured you a ticket across the Jordan in real life), it also lacked the saving storytelling graces that made films like ""The Great Escape"", ""A Night To Remember"", and ""The Longest Day (for example) such classics of historical drama.
The characters of Jack Dawson, Rose DeWitt Buktor, Calvin Hokeyhooey...er, Hockely (pardon the sarcasam), etc. completely lack the factual basis characters like, say, Hilts (""Cooler King""), Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett, and Danny (""Tunnel King"") had in ""The Great Escape.""  They also weren't very well-drawn characters in any case, as opposed to the above mentioned ""Great Escape"" characters.  Dawson, Buktor, & co. were more like one-dimensonal wind-up toy sort of characters that do all the predictable stuff a bad drama posesses.
In essance, the success of this movie was a fluke.  No more, no less...and the cultural excesses of it's success coated the memory of the real-life Titanic story with so much cultural junk that it will take a good-quality, stricly factual historial drama to burn it all off.
""Titanic"" was a long way short of being the great movie it was hailed as, and will forever remain the greatest misinterpreation of an historial event on film ever made.  Lets hope Hollywood has the guts to GET IT RIGHT the next time!",1029888000,4,3495,5.140845070422535
132103,5,0792151712,"April 10, 1912. Technology had been delivering a steady stream of miracles for the better part of two decades and people were beginning to take this never-ending spiral of progress for granted. What better demonstration of humanity's mastery over nature than the launch of Titanic, the largest and most luxurious moving object ever built by the hand of man? But four-and-a-half days later, the world had changed. The maiden voyage of the ""ship of dreams"" ended in a nightmare beyond comprehension and mankind's faith in its own indomitable power was forever destroyed by uniquely human shortcomings: arrogance, complacency and greed.
The goal in making this film was to show not only the dramatic death of this infamous ship, but her brief and glorious life as well. To capture the beauty, exuberance, optimism and hope of Titanic, her passengers and crew and, in the process of baring the dark side of humanity underlying this tragedy, celebrate the limitless potential of the human spirit. For Titanic is not just a cautionary tale - a myth, a parable, a metaphor for the ills of mankind. It is also a story of faith, courage, sacrifice and, above all else, love.
James Cameron's ""Titanic"" is an epic, action-packed romance set against the ill-fated maiden voyage of the R.M.S. Titanic, the pride and joy of the White Star Line and, at the time, the largest moving object ever built. She was the most luxurious liner of her era -- the ""ship of dreams"" -- which ultimately carried over 1,500 people to their death in the ice cold waters of the North Atlantic in the early hours of April 15, 1912.
The journey of ""Titanic"" begins in the present, at the site of the ship's watery grave, two-and-a-half miles under the ocean surface. An ambitious fortune hunter (Bill Paxton) is determined to plumb the treasures of this once-stately ship, only to bring to the surface a story left untold. The tragic ruins melt away to reveal the glittering palace that was Titanic as it prepares to launch on its maiden voyage from England. Amidst the thousands of well-wishers bidding a fond bon voyage, destiny has called two young souls, daring them to nurture a passion that would change their lives forever.
Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) is a 17-year-old, upper-class American suffocating under the rigid confines and expectations of Edwardian society who falls for a free-spirited young steerage passenger named Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). Once he opens her eyes to the world that lies outside her gilded cage, Rose and Jack's forbidden love begins a powerful mystery that ultimately echoes across the years into the present. Nothing on earth is going to come between them -- not even something as unimaginable as the sinking of Titanic.
Also inhabiting this floating microcosm are Cal Hockley, played by Billy Zane, heir to a huge fortune and Rose's fianc, and Ruth DeWitt Bukater, Rose's socially driven mother, played by Frances Fisher. Oscar winner Kathy Bates is featured as the ship's most colorful real-life passenger, Molly Brown. Other historic figures include Captain E.J. Smith (Bernard Hill), White Star Line's managing director J. Bruce Ismay (Jonathan Hyde), and master shipbuilder and primary architect of Titanic, Thomas Andrews (Victor Garber). Also participating in this devastating hand of fate dealt to the passengers of Titanic are an Italian emigrant named Fabrizio De Rossi (Danny Nucci), Jack's poor but determined best friend; and Spicer Lovejoy (David Warner), Cal Hockley's ruthlessly loyal valet.
Paramount Pictures and Twentieth Century Fox present a Lightstorm Entertainment Production, a James Cameron film, ""Titanic,"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Danny Nucci, David Warner and Bill Paxton. Written and directed by James Cameron, the film is produced by Cameron and Jon Landau. Rae Sanchini is executive producer.",1027555200,4,3926,5.184251968503937

I must say that I didn't care too much for the romance between Rose and Jack, but I thought Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio gave good performances.  I enjoyed the actual collision with the iceberg and the sinking itself.  The special effects in this movie are first-rate, from the near full size replica of the Titanic herself down to the grand staircase.  Director James Cameron paid great attention to authenticity throughout the movie, including the sinking itself. This attention to detail led to 11 Oscar nominations for the film, as well as a world-wide gross of over 1 billion dollars.  Perhaps the best part of the film was where the Titanic raises up, splits in half, and sinks.  The struggle for survival in the water is accuratley portrayed as well.  I am a history buff, so as I said, I liked the movie for its historical content and accuracy, but the overall plot was only lukewarm.  I felt Rose's character may have been overdone a little.  I got tired of her high society, holier than thou attitude.  I also felt Jack went a little out of his way to impress Rose.  I also enjoyed the beginning scenes where the submarines come upon the wreck itself.

132155,5,0792151712,"This movie strikes me with awe everytime I see it. When I think about all the money and all the work that went into that whole movie, it is just amazing. Many people say that this movie is very sad, and I guess you could say that it is, if you are into the romance aspects. I personally am not, and although I have seen this movie probably more than 10 times, I have not yet cried once during the very romantic seen with Jack and Rose. The thing that hits me the most, really, about the whole movie, is that the Titanic WAS real! People actually had to go through that. None of us can really say exactly what it was like to be on the ship as it sank, but I can't really imagine it being much much different then as it was portrayed in the film. The women and children who were on the Titanic actually had to say good bye to their husbands and fathers knowing full-well that they were going to die and that it would be very painful and harsh. People actually did jump off the boat, and it really gave me the idea of what the actual chaos was really like. I can't begin to imagine what I would do if I were ever in a situation like those poor people. So, I thought this movie was very real. I am not much of the romance type of girl, so I didn't really care about the romance in the story.
 ... My favorite part of the movie was most definitely: BILLY ZANE!! ...I thought he played an incredible role in the movie... he somehow ALWAYS pulls off that villain role perfectly! Everyone who watches the movie learns to hate him...The things he says and the way he acts is perfect, and I don't think anyone could've pulled off that role better than my Billy. ... You will not be disappointed with this one!! ...
  So anyway, I do have to agree though that some of the acting wasn't that great. Some people were just better than others. I thought Kate Winslet was alright... Leo was pretty good... Kathy Bates was good... the guy who played Lovejoy was good... the guy who played Mr. Andrews was good... The Captain Smith guy was really good. I didn't really think that Gloria Stuart was that great. There was just something in the way she said ""I would like to see my drawing!"" that just seemed fake. But I really did think that the best performance out of the whole movie was from Billy Zane, ...I think he did a great job of getting people to hate him and he always seemed real.
  ...I think that every aspect of it was great. I forgot to add something else... the music was incredible! James Horner is a total genius and I think that the music was the perfect exclamation point to the entire movie!
  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is in for a movie that is excited, romantic, and fun all at the same time. I think that it can be appealing to both men and women. It is like a ""chick flick"" with the romantic story... but it can also appeal to men with its reality and excitement. You get attached to characters during the story and you watch to see if they make it in the end...buy it, rent it, whatever you want to do. I don't think you will be disappointed unless you are very picky about movies...",1025568000,,3108,4.204697986577181

DeCaprio nicely captures the youth, romance, and energy of Jack. Winslett's performance just didn't ring true to me.  Zane was wonderful as the villian you love to hate. But the real star of the show is director James Cameron, who created jaw-dropping special effects on such a grand scale.  The sinking of the Titanic is unforgettable.

Every other aspect is either good or excellent, from the movie score to the direction, the acting, and the special effects. What makes this movie good is the recreation of that particular historical atmosphere and tragedy. Unfortunately, the movie is weak in its main theme, the very relationship between the two main characters. Their story is clichd; ok, what romantic story isn't? But a clichd story has to be well developed in all of its aspects, otherwise it allows the viewers to see the framework on which it is based, and that bombs the movie. For example, here we have rich unbearable guy engaged with beautiful but poor girl, who will marry him only to please her insensitive and money-grubbing mother. But girl meets good and poor guy who opens her eyes on the beauty of life and changes her forever. He's obviously perfect, while the bad boyfriend is incapable of doing or saying anything right (which is at least strange, I mean, statistically speaking, everybody says or does something right sooner or later, especially if the movie drags for three hours).

132215,1,0792151712,"My son (aged 14) and I went to see the special effects on the big screen, as he had been a fan of the actual historical event since early childhood. I asked him afterwards if he would like eventually to own a tape of the movie for our ""Titanic"" collection. ""Are you kidding?"" he said, ""This movie isn't about the 'Titanic'.""  And so it isn't. It's about a couple of 90's kids (and I mean 1990's, not 1890's) in a cinematic playground that reminds us vaguely of the ""Titanic"" disaster. (That anybody should complain of the predictability of the ending is a sure sign that this film has suckered us into a wrong purpose for our tale. A film about the sinking is about what it was like to be there on that ghastly night, not about ""whether or not it's going to sink."")
""A Night to Remember"" remains hands-down the best film about the disaster. (If you really must have soap opera added, there's always the 1953 ""Titanic"" with Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck.)
For all the money spent on this production, it has practically no sense of time and place (of the sort delivered by a film such as ""Black Robe"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia"", or even , God help us, ""Gladiator""), as the writing of dialogue in a thoroughly modern idiom - with acting style to match, except for Billy Zane - completely torpedoes any such sense.
This film is about taking money out of the pockets of goofy teenagers or out of the pockets of those who artistic life is indistiguishable from that of goofy teenagers. It is a profoundly cynical and dishonest piece of work.
The so-called ""Academy"" lost all credibility with me that year, picking this piece of tinsel over ""The Full Monty"", a film with real cinematic craft about real people in a real place and time.",1019520000,4,1729,4.506369426751593
132216,5,0792151712,"Well, everyone here must know by now what the film is about, so I'm not even gonna go into the plot. The film was directed by James Cameron (Terminator 1 & 2, Aliens) and was a commercial hit upon it's release in December 1997. When you see the film, you can see why. It has all the makings of a major blockbuster: passion, romance, action, suspense, and big budget special effects...the effects do not seem to over take the film. Instead, the movie contains some of the best scenes ever on film. My favorites being the ""flying"" scene, and the final shots of the Titanic before it sinks into the sea.
The acting in the film is above average. Leonardo Dicaprio is so-so as Jack Dawson the steerage passenger who sweeps first class passenger Rose Dewitt Bukator (Kate Winslet) off her feet. Kate Winslet is excellent as Rose. She is 100% believable as the rich girl who finally finds true love. She is able to draw inner emotion that in the hands of any other actress, would go unnoticed. Billy Zane as Rose's fiancee Cal also gives a great performance. He is able to convey evil at times in the film, but deep inside, you feel that he actually does love Rose, he just doesn't know how to show it.
The direction of the film is excellent. Parts of the screenplay leave a little something to be desired, but overall the screenplay is good. The best shot scenes in the film of course involve the Titanic. Instead of just getting standard shots of the ship, the camera sweeps around the entire ship. The music used in the film is extraordinary. It sets the tone for scenes of romance, passion and for scenes of danger. At times the score can be quite haunting.
Many have criticized the film for being overlong, boring and just plain bad. People who say these things just don't seem to understand the passion behind making an epic film such as this. And no, I didn't find the nudity distasteful. I think this is a film men & women can both like. The women can drool over Dicaprio, and they get a love story. But, the men can drool over Winslet, and they get an action film. Titanic is a great film. It would go up on my list along with Gone With The Wind as one of the greatest movies of all time.

Then again, it takes a lot of people to make the world go round. If you're normal...that is, if you know how to go grocery shopping, if you buy popcorn or hot tamales at the theater, if you eat cereal for breakfast, if you enjoy picnics with your family, and if sports aren't a barbaric waste of your precious time, then you'll enjoy this movie.
Just watch the movie and don't try to be superior to the movie. Nobody will like you.
When you allow yourself to enjoy the movie (instead of watching it for the sole purpose of picking it apart to impress your acquaintances who really don't like you if you're a person who would do such a thing), you'll be convinced the characters are on the ship. You'll be symphathetic to Rose's problems, which are particularly interesting considering she's so gorgeous and so loaded. Peasants from my tax bracket long to be in the shoes of someone so wealthy, but apparently it ain't so easy. No chance of me finding out, anyway.
Jack is our hero, because he's carefree without being a flake. He's also friendly, generous, and open, which makes it easy to admire the guy.
3.5 hours for this movie to begin and finish, and there shouldn't be a single moment's worth of boredom to you, with the possible exception of the beginning of the movie, which shows modern day Bill Paxton looking for sunken Titanic treasure (I bet he was the first to ever think of that idea! Hey Bill, while you're down there, see if you can find Atlantis for us. I hear that place had lots of gold). The characters, as I said, are very likable, except for the villains, which are dislikable...and very convincing.
The action is excellent, and the unbelievable stuff (Rose cutting through cuffs with an axe while her eyes are closed) doesn't leave you shaking your head. Your adreneline is pumping too much. Rising water makes nobody comfy.
The last hour or so was very touching, as the passengers and crew realize that the boat is sinking, and some are about to die. Their behaviour in these scenes is remarkable and real...and I had alligator tears streaming down while I watched it in the theatre.
This is just an awesome movie. I own it on Laserdisc, but I won't buy it on DVD. Not until they come out with more features. One reviewer I read suggested the DVD had enough features to make the cine-phile happy. I have No idea what he was talking about, and neither does he. He's never even seen the DVD, and apparently didn't read the details about it. This DVD has a trailer, widescreen, and chapter selection. Big deal. That's nothing. For a movie this great, you need a LOT more. I'll wait for a Criterian release, and you should to. It's a shame that one of the best movies of all time gets released on DVD without any special features. This movie needs at least as many as Seven or Shrek.",1019088000,,3171,4.506944444444445

Cameron actually stole a lot of ideas from earlier films about the Titanic. For example, the scene where the violin guys stay on the ship together was a total reinactment from A Night To Remember. There are a lot more scenes other than that which he stole too; you just have to see for yourself. Check out A Night To Remember and you'll see this.

When I first saw this movie on its opening day I thought it was wonderful.  As its popularity grew though I found myself having a strange reaction to it success.  I started to dislike the movie more and more.  And when it swept the Academy awards I was possitive that I hated the film, probably because I'm such a huge fan of LA Confidential.  Last night I watched Titanic again for the first time in two or three years and I must say that I was surprised at how much I found myself getting involved.  I must say that I now feel that Titanic is a great movie once again.
All of the things that I mentioned above, the ""flaws"" as some may consider them to be, don't diminish the enjoyment of the film at all.  I don't care how unoriginal the love story was.  It was kept simple.  THe film is so brilliantly executed, both thematically and technically, that I can dismiss these ""flaws"" with the wave of a hand.  When a film is done this well who really care about how ridiculous the love triange is.
I will not waste time discussing the plot and all that nonsense.  I see so many reviews talking about the lack of originality in films.  How come when a truely daring and original film does come along (ex: Crash, Dancer in the Dark, Moulin Rouge), films that try to break conventions and give the audience something new for a change, so many people complain about them because they don't follow conventional Hollywood formulas?  A catch-22?",1017532800,3,1586,4.480836236933798
132261,3,0792151712,"James Cameron is best known for directing such action slash science fiction classics as The Terminator (1984) and Aliens (1986). As a result a love story between an
upper class women Rose (Kate Winslet) and a lower class free spirit Jake (Leonardo DiCaprio) constructed around the sinking of a the supposedly ""unsinkable"" ship in
1912 could be seen as a change of pace. It is a change of pace which works, albeit it not completely.
 The story of the Titanic is a very familiar one and has developed its own mythology.
Cameron allows one character to helpfully outline what happened on that fateful night and thus allows the viewer to concentrate upon the love story between the star
crossed lovers  instead of worrying about the sinking of the ship. There is also asubplot about the fiancee of Rose Cal (Billy Zane) and henchman Lovejoy (David Warner) trying to prevent the lovers from being together.
 Titanic really is a return to the old fashioned epics that Hollywood used to make. The film is at it best when it is concentrating upon the recreation of the microcosm of
Edwardian society that Titanic was and the actual sinking of the boat. Unfortunately Cameron is not as good a writter as a director and the dialogue is often risible. Saying that though Cameron manages, like Neil Jordan in Interview with a Vampire (1994), to create some memorable set pieces, for example, when Jake and Rose descend in tothe engine room of the ship it resembles hell with the red of the flames or seeing the
bodies of dead people in the first class accommodation and of course of sinking of the ship. He also manages to convey the sheer terror the people must have felt as the ship
sank.
 The performances are merely adequate though Warner as Cal's villainous henchmen gives an enjoyable performance. Saying that though the actors and actresses are merely there to show case the special effects. They are mostly excellent though some
have aged badly. As an amalgam of a love story and a disaster movie it is not bad. When Cameron moves on to politics it flounders badly and he is on much more shaky ground.
 The film was hyped a lot and it possibly did not deserve the shed loads of Oscars it got. It is not one of the best films of the 90s or even the year it was made, but it is not
bad. The scale of the film making which Cameron has made is similar to the films which Cecil De Mille was making and for that he is to be applauded. Titanic is not innovative, but it is not meant to be new and within the narrow parameters it sets for
itself it works.",1016928000,2,2543,4.507592190889371

To be sure, Leonardo and Kate shine, the story involves one of the world's foremost tragedies, and the visual splendor of the film remains unchallenged.  Perhaps the best endorsement I can make however, is that it speaks a universal language - I took my Cuban born mother to see it when it opened.  She doesn't speak English, but was immediately wrapped up in the film, so much so that she was one of the first to cheer it at the end.  That speaks volumes - despite the language obstacle, here was a 65 year old woman who enjoyed the film from its opening scene right through the end.  To me, that alone makes ""Titanic"" a triumph.",1016928000,2,778,4.375

It is dreadful and I don't care how much money it pulled in at the box office or how many Oscars were showered on it. The plot is corny beyond belief. You will find stories of more sophistication and credibility in a Barbara Cartland novel. The portrayal of the Irish (below decks, of course) is patronising beyond belief. The special effects are not particularly special. (The computer generated Titanic looks like a badly drawn cartoon.) The acting is okay but everyone is miscast. DiCaprio, who looks as if he has come straight out of choir practice, does not convince as the Jack London figure he is obviously suppose to represent. Kate Winslet is not quite young enough to be the innocent abroad. However, they tackle their miscast roles with greater skill and artistry than James Cameron tackles his.

132267,2,0792151712,"Titanic may have been a movie that garnered a record number of academy nominations and awards.  But that doesn't make it a great movie, and here's why.  Basically the movie consists of two separate halves.  In the first half, the Titanic is merely the setting of events, because the story revolves around a forbidden romance between a poor young man called Jack, and an upper class lady Rose who is engaged to be married, her fiance also on the ship.  But this classic love triangle is more representative of 1997 than 1912.  Rose is introduced as a dignified upper class lady, but is soon spouting off profanities and makes obscene ... jokes with allusions to Freud.  And surprisingly, one moment she hates Jack, but the next moment she is posing nude for him, and romping around naked with him in a steamy scene in the back of a vehicle.  Not only is she applauded for being unfaithful to her fiance, but she tops it off by walking off with his diamond although his insurance company makes a heavy loss on it.  This kind of language and behaviour may be normal for 1997, but it certainly was not in 1912.
The second half of the movie is much better, picturing the actual sinking of the Titanic, and Jack and Rose's mad struggle for survival.  Hollywood has outdone itself in recreating the sinking, with epic scenes of struggle and survival.  This is probably the only thing the movie has going for it, but even this is rather overdone and overly dramatic.  And the historicity of many events that occurred during the actual sinking seriously needs to be questioned. The movie presents a small Christian group praying for help in an escapist manner that is rather outlandish and out of touch with reality; while in reality the majority of people of the Titanic were Christians and sang hymns and prayers as the boat sank.  The movie presents the captain as a suicidal selfish and incompetent..., while in reality he was speaking encouraging words from the ship until the very end.  The movie presents the upper class as selfish survivors who lock the oppressed lower class in the lower decks of the ship for a watery grave; while in reality it was an equal number of upper and lower class that perished. Incidentally the movie relies here on a horribly inaccurate clich: the wealthy are selfish, greedy and dishonest (Cal), while the poor are selfless, generous and loving (Jack).
Pointing these historical inaccuracies out won't make me popular, but it doesn't make them untrue.  The truth is that portraying a historically accurate version of the Titanic sinking would not be popular to today's masses.  Today's masses want Hollywood, not history, they want the immoral, not the moral.  It's little wonder this movie was more Hollywood than historical.  And it's little wonder it was so popular for the people of 1997.  That, to me, says it all.  The people of 1912 would have been horrified.  Too bad, because it's precisely the 1997 aspects of this movie that turned this movie into another sinking ship.",1015372800,8,3010,4.763005780346821

132269,5,0792151712,"A girl madly in love desperately struggling to save the life of the man whom she loves (which implies: a person struggling to preserve a sacred value, i.e. the person you love)....an old captain walking to his death with a guilty conscience (which implies: a man of honor punishing himself for having betrayed his own, independent judgment)...an engineer who is going down with his greatest achievement, now doomed to destruction, unable to abandon it at any cost (which implies: a man's love for & pain at the loss of the highest symbol of his capacity to think and create)...a mother putting her children(oblivious of their fate)to sleep with a bed time story, fully conscious of the fact that they shall all drown and die in a few minutes (which implies: a mother courageously protecting the magnificent, innocent spirit of (her) children, which has a great confidence in life, which knows no fear or ugliness)....
This is what I call emotional intensity - which is nothing but an expression of a value-oriented view of life. Emotions proceed from values-and greater the emotional intensity, greater the role & importance of values in the lives of the people involved.
""Titanic"" is not just a passionate love story (though within a somewhat clichd setup of a rich girl and poor boy). It is about the opening up of the soul of a young, spirited girl disgusted with convention & conformity -desperate to be happy and live her life on her own terms-to the full. And Jack does not become a great lover just because he died for the woman he loved, but because he gave her a more precious gift: the vision of a life filled with joy, laughter and beauty - a life which Rose never knew existed - which gave her the incentive to live to be 101. To live life happily one must love life, to love it one must have a particular view of life - it is this view which Jack gave Rose.
""Titanic"" portrays a wide spectrum of human emotions with an amazing force, vividness & effectiveness...passionate love & obsessive jealousy, frustration & depression, youthful exuberance & a sense of flight, fear & courage, yearning & despair, cruelty & horror. Whether it be a 100-year old woman recounting the most romantic moments of her life to a group of youngsters of the age of her grandchildren or an old couple who chose to die together rather than chose one's own life & the other's death - each emotion has a depth, intensity and sense of drama which radiates a warmth that has touched millions of hearts around the world and makes the viewer one with the characters in their feelings. In this depiction of human joy and suffering against the backdrop of one of the most heartrending tragedies of our times, combined with an overpowering suspense & adventure, lies the universal appeal of ""Titanic""
Apart from the visual effects & background score which are marvelous, I loved the artistry & execution of various scenes. About the ""lewd"", `painting' scene (which I think was poetic), I'd say: I'm thankful to Kate Winslet - it was like getting a glimpse of paradise. As for the `car' scene: it was presented in a manner which conveyed sensuality, passion & tenderness - without the crudeness of the usual love-making scenes. The ""finger"" simply expresses free-spiritedness & a childish mischievousness properly directed towards an undeniably obnoxious man. (Rose never shows irreverence towards those who really deserve respect).The comedy is subtle, delightful & witty - never vulgar or offensive. In addition, the performances were very good - I particularly liked that of Kate Winslet.
My favorite scenes are-the ""flying"" scene; the one in which the half-broken ship stands perpendicular on the waters for a few moments & then slowly starts sinking- I've yet to see anything to match them in all cinema (in terms of the emotions they evoke, their dramatic effect, grandeur & artistry) and the scene in which Rose leaves her lifeboat & returns to Jack (dramatizing the intensity of her passion).
In short, ""Titanic"" is one of the best films I've ever seen and hope to see. I'd undoubtedly call it one of my favorite films.",1014422400,3,4107,4.826950354609929
132340,3,0792151712,"First off, I would like to caterwaul I am tired of all of humanity revealing their knowledge of what happened and what did not happen in 1912.
Wait, wait, wait. Before you begin to detest my opinions, I'm not saying that you are all unknowing dolts--you probably are right.
Sure, thinking about it, it seems like 1912 was a time when most people obeyed properly and went along with strict protocals of all sorts. But there had to some who did not, right? It would be impossible history is that unalloyed. That's what makes recreating it fun.
People spat back then, I assume. They rebeled, like Rose. (Haven't we all spent enjoyable hours reading up on revolutions and such?)
That leads us to another point: If Rose was a rebel, I'm sure the romp she and Jack took place in in the car could have went on.
Dismay! People do not realize the middle finger gesture went on since the 1800's. In fact it was present in acient times.
Especially for the rich. If Rose was as jaunty as she seemed sometimes, hey, why not? (Whether she would have or not, it's
hilarious it's in there because of the controversy.)
And after all, aren't movies movies for the variant people they protray? So there, I give one star to it's diversity of characters.
Besides all that, the paper of Rose's charol drawing, as useless as it may have been could have survived 84 years, many documents on Titanic did. One man's bus ticket was retrieved from his wallet. !
My second star falls into place because of the cinematography, admirable costume design, the music, ect., ect.
The third star is for the second half of the film, the depition of the Titanic immersing. But oddly enough, the second half is
stoned down much by the first.
Why, oh, why is there the need for that extensive first (half hour is it?) of deep-sea diving? I'm sure you thought it was amusing, Cameron, but why put us through it, seeing it on screen?
Alrighty, after that we are introduced to Rose, 101. Why?
Why not began the movie with young Rose boarding the ship? We'll learn about Jack and Cal as it progresses! This fragment also allows the rest to be screwed up, because how does Rose know what's going about the ship when's she's not present?
The film advances into an effusive chick-flick, girl can't stand society, falls for thrid class boy after he ""saves"" her, they discover ""true love"" and yadda, yadda, yadda. (I know I said the rebellion part in characters is agreeable, but over too much gushy luv it looses it's touch, if you know what I mean.)
Not to disreguard: The script. No body speaks like that, 1912 or not.
Think, if this movie was nothing but the first half, not even one star would be in it's favor. It wouldn't even get produced.
So as a consummation, the ending with the ocean liner dying--that's what made it. It relied on speical and visual effects.
But in a way we loose a sense of completion.
Such a naive beginning does not go hand in hand with the imposing end. This was not a homage to Titanic. It was soely about Rose and Jack. Should have been named something more along the lines of a sappy V.C. Andrews novel, such as ""The Heart of the Ocean.""
A story about Titanic would be a story about someone related to the Titanic, maybe? We'd see more of the ship, and possible get more of a story, I wager.
As another result, what made this movie again was the last hour or so, which is the most lavish, exessive, documentary of the Titanic, or anything for that matter, ever made, since it did not really connect with the first half. I mean, Rose and Jack, two ordinary fools aboard? That's it.
The acting was adequate. Gloria Stuart was my personal favorite, even though her character was almost out of place. I get often tired of Leonardo's drollery, though. Billy Zane's eye-makeup is enough to drive you mad. Kate Winslet was as well enough to impel you to go insane with some card board acting, but over all I suppose she earned her nomination. (?)
Also, I must remark: This DVD. Where's the features? The deep-dive behind-the-scenes peek? (Hehe) Well, and I say quite prudishly, you think the biggest movie of all time would have more than just the trailer.",1014163200,2,4136,4.5233644859813085
132341,2,0792151712,"You may be confused with my rating. No--I am NOT anti-TITANIC. In fact, I think this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It is just that Amazon.com had asked for the rating of the DVD, and this DVD is absolutely horrible. Sure, the picture and sound quality is okay, but there are no special features! For the highest grossing film of all time, this is a pretty poor excuse for a DVD. And not only are there no special features, but this DVD is only available in widescreen format. And just how many people these days have widescreen TVs? Certainly not me! So why are all these DVDs only coming out in widescreen formats? Where are all the full frame formats?
But now onto the movie. The movie itself is really wonderful. I have the double video tape version and I have rented this DVD so I could compare the two. I have to say that the video tape version is better and much more worth the price. TITANIC takes place in the year 1912. Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) is a young lovely first class woman who is forced into marrying the money-made Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) by her money-hungry, overprotective mother (Francis Fisher). But on the Grand R.M.S. TITANIC, Rose meets her true love--the handsome young starving artist third class passenger, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), who won his tickets on TITANIC in a game of Poker. When the ship sinks, it is up to Rose and Jack to make sure they both survive.
I do not know one person who had not seen TITANIC in theaters. I only got to see it once in the theaters, but know it by heart now because of all the times I've watched the video. Some people think the love story is cheesy, but it is not. It shows the power of true love...and just how strong it can be. DiCaprio and Winslet are convincing and charming in their roles, and the supporting cast is wonderful, too. The special effects are just incredibly stunning--and this is one of the few films which I believe deserved the 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture.
James Cameron has created a masterpiece--a film that will not ever be forgotten, no matter how many people hated it. The screenplay and diolauge isn't even all that bad. The acting is absolutely superb...no one could have done a better job than these actors in their roles.
I just wish Paramount would have come out with a better DVD. In fact, here are some suggestions and ideas I'd like to make for a future collector's edition and/or special edition DVD (Paramount--are you taking notes?): behind-the-scenes, cast & crew biographies, cast & crew interviews, photo gallery, Celine Dion's ""My Heart Will Go On"" music video, Oscar night footage of the film winning each award--including the performance Celine Dion did, documentaries, real-life stories from real-life passengers on the real-life TITANIC, the making of the sets and special effects, the original screenplay by James Cameron, production notes, interactive CD-Rom games and extras for your computer, TITANIC's original theatrical trailer, picture-perfect quality and sound, widescreen and full frame formats, and perhaps even more! Now THAT would be the perfect DVD. I refuse to buy TITANIC on DVD until Paramount comes out with a special edition or collector's edition DVD!
Besides, doesn't the greatest film of all time need the greatest DVD of all time?",1012867200,9,3307,4.773123909249564

Titanic was one I couldn't wait to have on DVD. I must say I was never so disappointed in a single DVD purchase as I was with Titanic.
The single DVD contains one trailer and the movie...that's it!! No bonus material at all! But my biggest complaint was the video transfer. For a DVD, it is no better than the VHS tapes, in both video and sound quality. And if you put any zoom on it at all, it goes grainy even with a minimum amount. One would think that for the exorbant price of this DVD it would have been of top-shelf quality. Nothing could be further from the truth!

132343,4,0792151712,"I suppose every person who has ever seen this movie has their own opinion, and their own view of what is good and what is bad about the film,which I suppose that it was these reviews are all about. I enjoyed it mostly from the standpoint of the special effects such as the bridge and engine room scenes (before, during and after the collision with the iceberg.) Some people don't like the music, but I do: in particular the ""Southampton"" and ""Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch"" sequences . To really appreciate this film, I think you need to have a copy of ""A Night To Remember"" and ""Titanic"" (1953). I first saw the 1953 version while in the Navy during the Korean Conflict......the film was alright, but not all that outstanding....its only redeeming factor being that  am a fan of Clifton Webb. I would rate the three films in the order listed below. Another interesting sidelight to appreciation of the films is the CD-ROM Game ""Titanic-Adventure Out Of Time"". I finally muddled through the game and got off safely, having everything with me on th lifeboat to prevent the Russian Revolution, World War I and World War II, et cetera, et cetera and so forth. However, I find the ""Tour"" option the most interesting. You can watch the
film(s) and then take your own personal cruise on RMS Titanic at your leisure.(You won't need to worry about the iceberg on the ""Tour"".)

132346,5,0792151712,"When you think of real blockbusters, a few come to mind such as 'Ben Hur' or 'Gone With The Wind'.  'Titanic' brought the blockbuster into the 90's.  After the rush of sci-fi and horror flicks, it was nice to see a really traditional movie.  And that's all that there is to 'Titanic' really - stunning special effects, an involving love story, a sorrowful (and now infamous) ending mixed with fact.  It's this combination that makes the movie so irresistable, something that if you saw at the cinemas, you couldn't fail to be impressed by.  It completely blows you away, and if you feel a bit manipulated it's probably because you were.  Cameron mixed the elements for an old-fashioned blockbuster weepie that would gradually become a complete phenomenon.
There are obviously those that will slate this movie for its sheer commericialism, but 'Titanic' revels in it.  This is a movie aimed at pleasing everyone and it shows.  However, such critics may pay attention to the fact that many of the actors come from low-budget or intelligent movies - Kate Winslet (Heavenly Creatures), Leonardo diCaprio (What's Eating Gilbert Grape?) and Kathy Bates (Misery).  Although none of them are quite as good as the roles they played in the aforementioned films, they still make good value for money.

""Titanic"" is essentially two interconnected movies.  The first, or course, follows the historic accounts of the maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic and its tragic sinking due to the combination of neglectful overconfidence from her crew and a well-placed iceberg.  The second film concerns the events surrounding a pair of fictional star-crossed lovers who meet aboard the doomed ship.
The historical aspects of the movie are unparalleled.  Cameron did his homework on this part of the film, even going so far as to dive and film on the actual wreck in the North Atlantic.  All of the well-known figures are shown - The proud Captain Smith, the self-centered Bruce Ismay, head of the White Star Line, the tragic Thomas Andrews, the ship's designer aboard for the maiden voyage, the fiery Molly Brown, played wonderfully by Kathy Bates, John Astor, richest man aboard the ship, the tragic First Officer Murdoch (did he really shoot himself?  An unsolved historical mystery) plus a host of other minor characters.  Cameron makes use of examinations of the wreck to recreate the impact with the berg and the sinking itself in precise detail.  Anyone who says that this film is not historcially accurate does not know what they are talking about.
The romance between star-crossed lovers Jack Dawson and Rose Dewitt-Bukater is the standard doomed romance that filmmakers always seem to feel they have to insert into history-based films in order to get more people in the door.  I thought that both DiCaprio and Winslet turned in decent performances, if not worthy of best-actor/actress nominations.  People have taken James Cameron to task becuase he did not write them a bunch of super-deep, Bogart-Bacall dialogue.  Well, how much deep dialogue are you supposed to expect from a vagabond teenage punk kid and a spoiled-brat rich girl marrying a guy she doesn't love?  Anyone expecting deep dialogue from a pair of teenagers has clearly never been around REAL teens.  People say that DiCaprio and Winslet turned in stereotypical, shallow performances, but I think they captured the behavior of 95% of real teens perfectly.  Jack Dawson acted like any other teen would who suddenly captured the eye of a good-looking rich girl, and Rose acted like any spoiled, pampered little rich girl just waiting for an excuse to rebel against her overbearing mother.  I cheered for her when she told her mother off just before she boarded the lifeboat.  Both of them acted like typcial teens experiencing their first love affair.  If both of them had survived, the relationship probably would not have lasted more than six months, tops.
There were several other minor characters involved in the film, and I enjoyed them all.  I thought Billy Zane had a good time chewing the scenery as the typical love-to-hate-him bad guy.  David Warner was also excellent as the sinister assistant/accomplice to Zane's scheming.
Overall, this is a magnificent movie.  Anyone who can sit through the sequence where the band plays ""Nearer my God to Thee"" just before the sinking without being moved emotionally has something missing inside.  The mother reading her two kids to sleep, knowing they will soon be dead, and the two old people embracing on their bed as the water flows into their room, are two images that will stay with me forever, even if I never see this film again.  Cameron does an excellent job of creating a snapshot of life in 1912, and makes us truly care about the characters, most of whom will meet tragic ends in the frigid waters of the North Atlantic.  This movie is one for the ages.  No question about it.",1006128000,13,3851,4.869631901840491

What really bothered me about this film was the overwhelming hype over a film that had a  terrible gym teacher style performance by Leonardo D' Caprio, a cheesy, annoying performance by Kate Winslet (who's highlight of the film was a mildly non-sexual nude scene), and an ignored, great performance by Billy Zane who played Winslet""s violent tempered fiance. The plot: a romantic affair on the Titanic between a 3rd class boy Jack (Leonardo D' Caprio) and an engaged 1st class girl Rose(Kate Winslet).
The film (mostly in the opening scenes and the sinking of the ship.) is entertaining. The scenes in which Jack and Rose are in really hurt the film. The old Rose telling the story of the Titanic uses a bit of rather stupid dialouge (""The china had never been used, the beds never slept in."") When I saw it I yelled ""Yea right!"".

The movie has its loud and obnoxious detractors, but they are mainly tasteless, insecure teenage  boys with a silly jealousy thing going on over Leonardo DiCaprio's popularity  with women. Ignore those idiots and enjoy this grand spectacle in the style of classic Hollywood epics.
This film is brilliant in EVERY way. Acting, music, technically, just in every way. It richly deserved its 11 oscars.
Historians have emphasized over and over the fact that the Titanic sinking has never been told as accurately as here. The fictional love story does not detract from the tragedy, but serves to bring in modern-day audiences with a story they can relate to and helps them appreciate the scope of the tragedy as never before.
Anyone who is not moved by this film (other than some silly teenage boys) could be a sociopath and I would be afraid to sleep in the same house with them.
Seriously, buy this DVD, forget the hype and just sit back and enjoy brilliant film making at its best.

The story about impossible love as Jack Dawson(DiCaprio) falls in love with the socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater (Winslet) and the impossible love between the poor Jack and the rich and soon to be married Rose, and how they try to defy the will of Rose's family and her (villainous) husband-to-be. As for the ship we all know the ending, as for the main characters it is not my job to tell here. This is really a movie aimed at romance loving, female, moviegoers. As for the rest of us the movie is like candyfloss it is great at first but soon it becomes sickening sweet. As for the movie as whole, it is well construced, the special effects are good(with a few exeptions) and it hits right where it was intended. I personaly don't know what was worst. The movie or Camerons speech when he got an Oscar.",1004486400,3,1015,4.491891891891892
132398,2,0792151712,"I managed to see this film after it wasn't on the big screen anymore. Even on a television, the special effects are finely detailed and convincing, specifically in reference to the end of the film where the ship breaks apart. Of course this covers perhaps 30 minutes of this 3 hour pop culture pleaser. Why , oh why does every hollywood film have to involve some trite b.s. love story that reflects the shallowness of modern relationships? I already know about stereotypically good-looking guys and stereotypically good-looking girls ""falling in love"" with each other for no apparent reason, I saw plenty of that in highschool. If real life is any indication, its a good thing Mr. DiCaprio kicked the bucket, otherwise the two main characters would have been married within a week of the crash, had 40 children, then decided that their marriage ""wasn't working for some reason"", divorced, and traumatized their kids by fighting over rights to see them. Ho hum.
It probably wouldn't be so bad if the film focused more on the tragedy of the sinking than the lust afair. Sadly, 30 minutes is all you get. One should probably be happy they at least get that. If you want to find out about the the Titanic, go watch one of the fantastic documentaries available. If you want to watch another tacky pop love film, go watch any of the other hundreds that are available. I hate to think of all the trendy boys and girls leaving the theater thinking they actually learned anything about the Titanic.

  the plot is pretty simple: a rich girl falling in love with a poor guy.  their torrid affair has only one obsticle: the ship they're in love on is sinking.
  while being a bit too long, ""Titanic"" is historically accurate and truly a winner.  it's a box office giant, andf let me say that i was very impressed when i saw it in the theaters.  i own the DVD, and my girlfriend and i watch it often, although i am tired of it.  it's one of those movies that you see once, like it, but never want to see it again.
  here's the bottom line: ""Titanic"" is a very good movie, but it is flawed.  once, it's a bit mushy and too focused around the lovers.  two, it can be boring at times and is a littel too long.  but if you're looking for a good love story, look no further than ""Titanic""  director James Cameron does it again.  the special effects are superb, and James Horner's music is fabulous.  rent ""Titanic"" and see it for yourself!",1003363200,2,1072,4.116504854368932
132401,1,0792151712,"Where to begin?  Its often said that a great film gives you something new to love with each viewing.  Titanic is the exact opposite.  Everytime I have seen this film (or even just clips of this film) I've found something new to despise.  Upon first viewing, it was the laughable script.  Then, it was Leonardo DiCaprio's shrill, look-ma-I-got-talent performance.  Next, it was how the film wasted a quirky actor like Bill Paxton.  Kathy Bates followed and then Gloria Stuart came along and -- well, the list just goes on and on.  It is, afterall, a forty-eight hour film...
Anyway, Titanic is a love story set upon the doomed ocean liner Titanic in which director Cameron explores issues of class and wealth with a niave fervor that reminds one of a college freshman who had just read Marx for the first time and is convinced that he's the first person in the history of the world to ever realize that the rich are different.  Kate Winslet is engaged to Billy Zane who is so evil that, even when the ship is sinking, he still feels the need to chase his fiancee and her lover with a gun while shouting stuff like, ""I hope you'll be very happy together!""  One wonders if Cameron actually wrote that line or if Zane (whose performance suggests that he, at least, realized how ludicrous the film was) simply improvised it out of a desire to give the audience a good laugh.  Kate's lover is played by Leonardo DiCaprio who, in this film, looks and sounds like he's about twelve.  He's a poor artist named Jack.  His poverty is not hard to understand as the sketches seen in his sketchbook suggest that he's not a very good artist.  As well, lines about being a tumbleweed in the wind suggest that he's decided to disguise his lack of talent by being as pretentiously annoying and smug as possible.  Anyway, DiCaprio reveals to the sheltered Winslet what its like to be poor.  Apparently, poverty means you dance a lot, carry your own fiddles, and of course die when the ship goes down.
Kate Winslet is one of the few things in this film that I have yet to find a reason to hate, except for the fact that she's far too talented to be stuck in such a nothing role.  For all the talk of Winslet playing a strong, independent woman, her function in the script seems to be 1) to get naked, 2) to be saved by DiCaprio, and 3) to continually look up at DiCaprio and say, ""If only I could be like you, Jack!""  In short, she is a male fantasy and luckily, Winslet is a good enough actress to be able to bring some wit and verve to a seriously underwritten role.  Perhaps the only real problem with her casting is that its hard to believe someone with her natural intelligence would require a suitor as dim and childish as DiCaprio to open up the world for her.  When the two of them do finally consumate their affair, several reviewers -- at the time -- mentioned that the loss of virginity was meant to parrallell the world's loss of innocence.  It took me a while before I realized that Winslet, and not DiCaprio, was supposed to be the virgin.
Anyway, the film also comes with a second story -- a framing story that takes place in the present in which it is tragically revealed that Winslet has grown up to become Gloria Stuart who then proceeds to tell her story to Bill Paxton.  Stuart plays a typical movie version of an old woman -- the opinionated, crusty old biddy that everyone on screen adores but in real life you'd go out of your way to avoid.
Of course, some might say that this film isn't about complex characters or a thought-provoking script.  Its about Cameron showing what he can do with a camera!  Its a ""director's film.""  Well, its a really long director's film that reveals that the director has absolutely no clue how to make anything resembling human interaction in any way compelling.  The story drags, especially when that awful old woman is on screen, and the sinking ship isn't really all that spectacular unless its looming above you on a big movie screen.  Cameron reveals that he has a good feel for special effects with this film.  Well, good for him.  The men who designed and built the original Titanic had a good feel for technology too.  In the case of both film and ship, a lot of otherwise sensible people paid far too much money for the experience and both passengers and viewers were repaid for their faith by being drowned in a sea of mediocrity.",1003017600,43,4375,4.473551637279597
132402,1,0792151712,"The only thing that could have made this movie watchable is if Leonardo DiCaprio's character had died before the ship left the harbor.  It's a good thing that women find him attractive, because he will not be able to support himself on his acting ability alone.
The movie was a melodramatic mess.  The characters were just cutouts, two dimentional and without depth.  I felt no sympathy for any of them when the boat went down, just a sense of relief that this long winded tear jerker was almost over.
Lowest common denominator story-telling at its finest.
I'm really saddened that Cameron would unleash this ""disaster"" on us.  He's done some really entertaining work, Aliens and True Lies come to mind.  Maybe now that he's gotten obscenely wealthy off of this flick, he'll go back to writing and directing deeper films.",1002758400,22,821,4.835714285714285
132403,5,0792151712,"We all know the hype Titanic received when it was released before and even more so after it was first released on December 19th, 1997. But given the facts that this film is the most expensive ever created, at a cost of $200 million, and later becoming the most successful movie ever released, making over $2.5 billion worldwide in ticket sales. As well as having an entire new studio, Fox Studios Baja, built for the sole purpose of creating this mammoth film.
Obviously, the filmmakers of Titanic, spearheaded by Director/ Writer/ Editor/ etc James Cameron, where very dedicated to the creation of this film, having spent over five years of his life working tirelessly on the creation of what he hoped would be a masterpiece. Justifiably, he was not to be disappointed, and neither was the world public. While it seems there are two groups of people when it comes to Titanic, those who thought it was just the best thing to ever happen to moviemaking (As I do) and others who thought it was just another movie, in retrospect, we can all appreciate it to one degree or another.
The film opens in sweeping shots of the departure of the ship shown in sepia-tone, and transfers almost immediately to the depths of the ocean, and the ghostly hulking remains of the once grand ship, which to a large degree still retains it's grandeur, standing proud and upright as it decays away so far down in the sea.
Soon after, with the introduction of the treasure hunter Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton), we learn he is not at this peaceful place for research, but rather he is hear in search of a dazzling blue diamond, and nothing less. Despite his discovery of the suite's safe, once he lifts it to the research vessel's deck, he finds the safe is empty of the elusive diamond, but he does find a charcoal drawing of nude woman, nearly nude actually, she is wearing the dazzling diamond on a white diamond chain around her neck. This discovery leads Old Rose (Gloria Stuart) to call the expedition with the news that she is the ""woman in the picture.""
This leads her to come out to the research ship, and begin her tale. We are then transported to sailing day, April 10th, 1912, and almost immediately introduced to a young woman (Kate Winslet) in a white and blue pinstriped suit, with deep beautiful red locks, in an oversized purple wicker hat, adorned by an ever more oversized light purple bow. Soon after, we are shown a nearby pub, where a handsome shaggy haired blonde (Leonardo DiCaprio) is engaged in a poker game, attempting to win a trip aboard the nearby Titanic.
Soon after, it is discovered this young woman is being forced into a loveless marriage, all for the sake of maintaining her mother's and her own way of living. We soon see young Rose is desperate to escape her life, even at the expense of ending it. To do so, she escapes to the stern of the ship, where she stands, contemplating jumping. Jack cautiously approaches her, they both immediately drawn out of their elements, she existing in these moments as nothing more than a desperate young girl, and he as a caring young man trying to understand her desperation and help her overcome it.
From this point, their relationship slowly develops, as she is gradually drawn out of her high society all-rules world, and into his world of carefree life, and uninhibited expressionism. This exposure begins slowly the morning after the suicide incident, after Rose's fianc has presented her with the massive Heart of the Ocean necklace as a token of his affection, showing the only way he knows to express love is through physical possessions, which is how he views Rose herself, as nothing more than a possession. The next morning Rose and Jack Walk along the decks, gradually getting to know one another, as well, here Rose is first drawn into Jack's world when he shows her his sketches, and later teaches her to spit overboard. Later Rose is further exposed to his world when he takes control of the conversation in the First Class Dining Saloon, and then takes her for a ""real party"" in steerage class, furter exposing her to his world.
The next morning, Rose's fianc, Cal (Billy Zane), explodes at Rose at breakfast, which perhaps is her first turning point in wanting to leave her world and enter Jack's.
Soon after, she is confronted by Jack, and dismisses him, and then goes looking for him, and his willing affections again. She goes flying with him on the bow, and shares what is perhaps the most affectionate moment of her life, from this moment, she is completely within Jack's world. She soon invites Jack to her suite, for him to commission the later discovered sketch of Rose wearing the diamond. Afterward, she escapes with him and they consummate the relationship in the backseat of a car in the cargo hold. Just afterward, Rose expresses her desire to change her life, just as a huge piece of ice changes the fates of all aboard the ship!
Rose, showing concern for her mother, urges Jack to return with her to tell her mother about the accident. While doing so, Cal has Jack arrested for stealing the necklace, which he had planted in his pocket. Minutes later, when the ship's builder Thomas Andrews (Victor Garber) informs Rose the ship will in fact sink, she rushes to find Jack below, trudging through the bowls of the ship in her multilayered dress and heavy pink overcoat, in search of her love. When she finally finds him, she is forced to search frantically for an axe to free him, the couple eventually escaping the ever flooding areas of the ship. The doomed couple eventually find themselves on the tip of the stern, at the same place where they first met. In a stunning display of special effects, the ship slowly slips below the waves, the couple suddenly separated, and rejoined moments later. Jack then finds Rose a piece of wood to stay out of the water on, he meanwhile rests on the edge of it. They both eventually fall asleep, Jack slipping gracefully into death, and Rose seeing an approaching lifeboat, tries to wake him, but finding him passed away, lets him slip away, while she is eventually is able to gain access into a lifeboat.
Once Rose portrays her story to the treasure hunters she slips to the end of the research ship and drops the necklace, which she has had the entire time, back into the ocean, allowing her to finally have peace with the past. That night she dreams or dies (you decide) and goes back to the Titanic in a beautiful white gown and back into the arms of her beloved. The film then ends with the haunting balled sang perfectly by Celine Dion.
While the screenplay may have it's weak points, these are more than rectified by the immense attention to detail, making every detail of the film as historically accurate as is possible, by the detail obsessed James Cameron. Amplifying the historical details even further are the amazing gowns worn by Rose, as well as all the supporting player's costuming. The detail was such with this film, that the costuming budget alone was a light $7 million.
With the massive amounts of time, effort, obsession, financial backing, and ultimately international unprecedented financial and award winning success, how could anyone pass this movie off as just an over hyped film! I say, give the film a shot, even if you don't think you'll like it. Honestly, I originally disregarded the film myself, but once I heard of how nearly everyone who were seeing it were loving it, I went to see it the day after Christmas of 1997, and I have never looked back! I recommend this film above any other I have ever seen in my life! If you haven't allowed yourself the pleasure of this film, run, don't walk, to the nearest store and rent it! And get yourself ready for the next three and a half hours to just sail away!",1002585600,,7760,4.652585579024035
132404,2,0792151712,"And so, we come to the most successful film of all time. I'm sure you know the story by now, so i won't bore you with that. One thing i will make clear though is that when i originally saw Titanic i had a higher opinion of it. Not much higher, mind. No, i just thought it was an okay film - a 3/5 as opposed to a 2/5. However, on repaeted viewings i have begun to see what a charlatan i was for giving it such a high rating. And lovers of the film can't say that watching it on video or DVD, ""diminishes the impact"" because the second time i saw it was again at the cinema. I have watched it since on the small screen, and it's even worse.
 Stripped of the impact that the undoubtedly wonderful special effects had on the big screen, you can really see the film for what it is. And it's not a pretty sight. Not that i hadn't noticed that on my second cinematic trip. But in the comfort of your home it's decidedly discomforting.
 James Cameron's film is about as vacuous as space, but less interesting. The priniciple lovers, (DiCaprio and Winslet) don't put in bad performances, it's just they have to deliver lines of dialogue of the lowest order.
 I always respected Cameron, but clearly his way with plot and dialogue does not match his mastery of special effects. Gripping though the Terminator films were, they weren't exactly stretched on the script front. But in Titanic, Cameron clearly has had a fair stab at keeping the audience for 3 hours, but has failed. The charcters are two dimensional, and at the worst horribly cliched (Evil suitor, cold prospective mother in law, sinister British sidekick, proud Captain, spunky Southern gal!) And as for characters who don't hale from America, they're given some awful lines to chew on. The British say things like ""Bleeding Christ"" (I am British and have never heard anyone of any generation use this phrase). Of course all the Brits are evil, as they always are, and all the Irish are fun loving, as usual, and the Latin American character is, naturally, ""hot tempered."" Even Rose and Jack are hardly the most well rounded characters.
 Billy Zane seems to have the most fun in his role, but that is little more than a pantomime performance. And sadly, that it was Titanic basically is, an overblown big budget pantomime, asking the audience to care about characters they don't even find believeable.
 I know, i will be in the minority with this view, and that there are those, less cynical than me, who will marvel in a tale of romance and intrigue, and i can understand that. It just seems a shame that Cameron had in his hands one of the greatest stories ever told, full of disaster, pain, passion and honour, and he turned it into a soap opera. Missed opportunity, i feel.
 Titanic is not totally unappealing, and if you haven't seen it it's worth checking out once. But with so much brilliant cinema out there i wouldn't waste anymore of your life than is neccessary. Read a book!",1002585600,21,2941,4.518796992481203

Perhaps the plot of the young lovers is well-worn, but Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet bring such charm and sincerity to their roles, we fall in love with them as do with each other. The TRUE star of the film, however, is the gigantic ship herself. The story unfolds from one end of the ship to the other, showing off all the detail work put into this feature. The love story aside, the events depicted really happened, and perhaps no film could or should depict the true horror of that fateful night in the north atlantic. However, this film gives an inkling of the terror those poor peole faced, and the courage they exhibited in surviving.

132406,4,0792151712,"A three-hour-and-fifteen-minute movie does not speak well to director James Cameron's intelligence. Not only did he spend two hundred million dollars on a film with a predictable ending (though you know that some producer suggested Arnold Schwarzenegger beat the crap out of the iceberg and save the day), but he made it so long that theaters can only show it three times a day instead of four. This significantly increases the chances Cameron will succumb to the ""curse of the water picture,"" lose money and have people call him an idiot.
If they don't call him an idiot for his expenditure, they'll surely call him one for his writing. Obviously, Cameron was going to sink or swim with this project, but couldn't he have subsumed his world-class ego for one second and given the writing assignment to somebody with an imagination? His clever story features a poor boy, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), sneaking onto the Titanic, then falling in love with the aristocratic, soon-to-be-wed, Rose (Kate Winslet). Naturally, none of Rose's family or friends wants that to happen, so the clandestine couple spends the entire trip avoiding people. Pardon me, but was that plagiarized from ""Wings of the Dove"" or ""Out to Sea?""
Cameron had a titanium camera housing designed so he could film inside the actual wreckage of the Titanic, thereby necessitating an extraneous storyline involving a treasure hunter (Bill Paxton) poking around the wreckage. Cameron flashes back to the main story when Paxton finds the elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart), who has survived the disaster. If suspense were nickels, Cameron's epic would earn him little more than a hot, steaming cup of 1912 coffee.
This movie is long. I mean long like the Nile, long like a Bill Clinton speech, long like a trek across the Outback, long like John Holmes.",1001808000,,1815,5.013245033112582

The first few scenes in the movie are thoroughly enjoyable, and I found myself thinking that this had the potential to be one of the greatest movies EVER.  These first scenes get one and a half of the stars I gave.
Then, the flashback began...
The cinematography (sp?) here is beautiful.  I would recommend this movie just for that (the other half-star).  Then, someone opened his mouth.
From the beginning of the flashback to the time when I walked out in righteous indignation, both the plot and the characters were totally and unforgivably flat (a DiCaprio characteristic from the time he found out he didn't have to act to draw box-office -and since then he hasn't been able to act his way out of a wet paper bag, so he's almost forgivable, but for the others...).
This movie is not worthy of Cameron.  I will say it did deserve some of the Oscars it received, but not the Best Picture.  I will draw kudos to the Oscar Nominating Committee for leaving DiCaprio out.  Shows they haven't sold out completely.
I did borrow a copy of the video at one point to watch the rest (sometimes I swear I'm a masochist!).  The flashbacks only got a little better, but the last couple of scenes (including the last couple scenes of the flashback) were wonderful.

Ever have that experience? How come it seemed so great in the movies, but at home, no? Now don't get me wrong: the special effects still worked fine, but what really hit me was how shallow the two main actors were. I hadn't realized it in the theatre, but now it was plain as day that their characters were selfish and self-seeking at all times. This version of the Titanic story was the only one that left out any of the real-life human interest stories about self-sacrifice on the part of the passengers. All we saw was Jack and Rose trying to get themselves off the ship, period. No help to anyone else. Are we supposed to infer that director Cameron disbelieved that the real-life people were truly capable of nobility, and that's why he totally ignored that aspect of the history? Too bad if so, because that's really what always captures our interest about this disaster, that people in such dire circumstances retained their humanity to such an extent and in many cases laid down their lives for another's. The Titanic story is the story of many individuals, not just one big mob or indiscriminant group of people killed in an air crash. That's why it's so compelling all these years later, because ideals are timeless.
Back to the movie. By the way, I hated that Gloria Stuart. So she was old, so what? That didn't make her a good actress. I think Cameron ought to have gotten an old actress who actually looks something like Winslet, such as Olivia de Havilland. Kate and Leonardo were a very young couple, but I didn't mind that. I was gladdest of all to see that one of the upper crust British gents was played by Bernard Fox, Dr. Bombay from ""Bewitched"".

From the opening sequence until the end credits this I was riveted to the screen.  Never have I seen a movie where noone got up to leave to goto the bathroom or get a snack.  The entire audience never made a peep-noone talked or made a sound.  About halfway thru thu the movie I forced my eyes off the screen and looked around the theatre and everyone was sitting there with their eyes and jaws wide open at the screen.  I never looked at my watch to see how much time had gone.  Even near the end it felt that I was sitting there for only a few minutes.  Never did the movie seem to drag. I saw the movie five times in the theater and each time almost the entire audience sat thru the end credits.  I never have seen that happen before or after.
As far as the naysayers go and the very negative reviews they give, I believe they are mostly guys who don't feel comfortable expressing their emotions and hate the film because it made them cry and they don't want to admit it or have a hard time dealing with that.  I have friends who saw the movie with their buddies and have the same opinion as me.
The non believers like to justify their negativity by saying that all 3 hour epics or overhyped movies win academy awards.  That is far from the truth-can you say Wyatt Erp or Waterworld?  Or they say that the move was so overhyped it forced people to go see it.  Well I never saw a Titanic commercial on TV until after I saw the movie.  Lastly, there is the argument that teenage girls made the movie such as success because they wanted to see Leonardo and went repeatedly to see the movie. Definitely that is true, but if that is the only reason Titanic was a success then you must ask yourself ""Why aren't any of Leonardos' movies following Titanic super-sucessful?""
Anyways, I'm glad I got that off my chest.  Regarding the DVD, get it!  Much better picture quality than VHS, but I feel it should have a few more extra goodies.  Watching Titanic (or any movie) at home just isn't the same as seeing it in a theater (going from a 40 foot screen to a 36 inch screen alot is lost) no matter how good of a home theater you have.  And you don't feel the emotions of the other few hundred people in the theatre.  But you know you can't go back, and until Titanic is rereleased in theatres, the DVD is the best you can get.",998524800,3,2700,4.165703275529865
132466,5,0792151712,"James Cameron has reached the zenith of his career and now has nowhere to go but down.  Once an epic of this proportion hits the billion-dollar mark, it announces the apex of its creator and it will never see its equal.  ""Titanic"" couldn't have asked for a better cast, the beautiful russet-tressed Winslet and the king of heartthrob's DiCaprio both actors from a generation that is known to spend a good chunk of their hard-earned capital each month on their local cineplexes.  It also couldn't have gone wrong with its December release date, people overly stressed by the financial and emotional crush of holiday shopping.  Kids are out of school for a week, their parents are trying to find ways to relax and a retreat into a good movie theater is the ideal recreation.
What won the majority of Titanic's audience was a base ripped directly from the pages of a dozen cheesy romance novels: a story of true love.  Cameron said it first: ""Titanic is not just a cautionary tale - a myth, a parable, a metaphor for the ills of mankind.  It is also a story of faith, courage, sacrifice and, above all else, love.""  There's a romantic schmuck lurking inside us all and this film's theme of undying devotion sucked us in by the thousands, nary a dry eye in the house after each of its glorified 3-hour screenings.  It was the big kahuna at 1998's Academy Awards and raked in 11 of its 14 trophies, tying with 1959's Roman tour de force ""Ben-Hur"".  With a multi-million dollar budget paying for its hundreds of visual spectacles, a life-size model of the doomed vessel and the cost of filming equipment, it grossed nearly ten times the cost and was screened nationwide in theaters for almost four months.
Kate Winslet was nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal of Rose Dewitt-Bukater, an American aristocrat engaged to greedy rogue Cal Hockley (Zane).  She realizes from the moment she is betrothed that she will marry into a life of tea times, cotillions and the superficial banter of Philadelphia's high society.  Beneath her poised exterior, Rose is a fiery and emancipated soul but the obligation of her marriage and the reassurance of financial security is enforced upon her by her rigid and self-regarding mother Ruth (Fisher).  She assumes that her life as she knows it is over and decides to end it all by somersaulting into an icy sepulcher, dangling over Titanic's rail and facing the wrath of the arctic waves below.  Little does she know, a man named Jack Dawson stands nearby, hearing her despondent sobs. Not one to overlook a possible tragedy, he dissuades her from surrendering to the bitter cold of the North Atlantic and pulls her from the bow.  It isn't love at first sight as one would think, but Rose comes to acknowledge that Jack is a compassionate and chivalrous soul that not only will steal in her heart but will change her life forever.
Cameron had several historians on hand for an accurate recreation of the fated vessel and a meticulous team of marine explorers who performed twelve dives to gather footage.  Cameron accompanied his team in a submersible complete with a special camera that withstood the staggering PSI of the Atlantic's opaque depths.  His crack team also recruited several of the companies that had originally furnished the Titanic (carpets, chandeliers) when it began construction in 1908 - quite a few of the original patterns and designs were still on record. Kudos to James Horner's haunting and touching score with Norwegian vocalist Sissel Kyrkjebo voicing the lingering and heartrending vocals.
A majority of the key players give admirable performances, Fisher perfectly icy and Zane perfectly snide.  Cameron chose other actors according to their physical countenance, a good deal of them bearing an eerie resemblance to their real-life counterparts such as Captain Edward J. Smith (Bernard Hill), The ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) and J. Bruce Ismay (Jonathan Hyde).  I didn't think much of Leonardo DiCaprio as an actor but I thought that his Oscar nomination for ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" had to count for something. Then I saw ""The Basketball Diaries"" - every Tiger Beat vision I had of him pretty much petered out after that.  I was thus able to watch him in ""Titanic"" without prejudice and left the theater convinced that he would be more than just a pretty face in the next few years - he would be a megastar.  Since then, DiCaprio has appeared in ""The Man In The Iron Mask"",  ""Celebrity"" and the box-office bummer ""The Beach"" (the inevitable rotten apple; had to happen sometime).  He is currently on location for the filming of Martin Scorsese's ""Gangs Of New York"" and will repeat the challenge of portraying twin brothers in Randall Wallace's factual-based film bio ""Johnny Eck"".  Let's hope those two projects put him back on track and back in the limelight where he rightfully belongs.
""Titanic"" may have finally exhausted the general populace's patience but certainly these people have to give it its due for the monstrous appeal it gained and the painstaking effort that Cameron poured into the film.  Some may scoff at the movie's saccharin premise but ""Titanic"" will remain a well-regarded classic for years, finding its place among other Hollywood epics like ""Cleopatra"", ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Spartacus"".",998438400,,5294,4.915824915824916
132507,2,0792151712,"Okay, some serious comments now.  It seems an injustice that James Cameron did not suffer the same fate that Michael Cimino endured when his epic film, Heaven's Gate, ended up with massive critical damage.  Titanic was a bad movie that won out by pushing people's visceral buttons rather than by telling the truth about history.  Whether the director's version of that other epic was good or bad will never truly be known since there will never be a definitive DVD or other hommage.
Some tired, hackened examples of Cameron's inaccuracies include the cookie-cutter characterizations of his bad guy, the rich snob that would part the heroine from her One True Love.  I mean, when does this really happen?  In reality, the rich girl played by Winslet never would have fallen for the wharf rat played by DiCaprio.  The only character worthy to mention by name is Molly Brown, and she should have had a lot more time on screen.  I would have thought better of a film that spent more time and money on historical research than pyrotechnical special effects.
James Cameron, you are most definitely not worthy!",997747200,4,1103,4.835106382978723
132508,4,0792151712,"I intentionally avoided seeing this when it first came out beause of all the hype. And I doubly avoided seeing it when it won all those academy awards. As a Titanic fanatic for more than thirty years, reading and whatever I could about the great ship, even teaching it in high school, I was sure it would disappoint me. Then, one night, on a whim, I decided to rent it with my wife.
I have to admit I was blown away.
It gripped me from the first moment... and never let me go. I was disturbed I reacted so emotionally to the movie. I dislike Leo (something about him just irks me) and didn't want to admit I was sentimental about something he was in that was so hyped and popular. But I couldn't deny the way I reacted.
About a year later I rewatched Titanic for the first time since that original experience and it got me again. Damn. I must be a sentimental fool. But what can I say? Shoot me. That's the way I reacted.
Now, in the retrospect of time, I think I can identify, for myself at least, some of the movie's strengths and weaknesses. The strengths of the movie are:
1) special effects,
2) musical score (I purchased the sountrack and played it in my car regularly for a year till I became pretty much sick of it),
3) fascinating historical setting extremely well recreated
4) epic feel
5) some really good supporting performances
6) and, yes, the love story (I know this is where I'll lose some people)
The weaknesses are:
1) Some stilted dialogue
2) some stilted acting of stilted dialogue
3) Leo's arrogance (sometimes appropriate, admittedly, but sometimes nauseating)
4) hype surrounding the movie
It is my opinion now, given the perspective of time, that if viewed in a vacuum without the hype and expectation (if that's possible) it's a good movie, even a darn good movie, that can be moving. Heck, seeing the Titanic in computer graphic flesh alone would have been enough for me. And the music is literally out of this world. But even the love story, if you let your guard down, can work. And, believe me, I'm no Leo fan. Still, when he sinks away into oblivion, or when he and Rose are reunited in her dream/afterlife vision at the very end, something touches me and gets my emotional juices going.
Call me a fool. An idiot. Love -- lost and otherwise -- tends to make idiots of people. Here's to having more such idiocy in our lives!",996969600,,2353,4.449074074074074
132509,5,0792151712,"As I write this brief review, it is four years since ""Titanic"" came out, and there have been many Big Movies since then.  Now that the hype has died down, it's time for a calm assessment of James Cameron's film.
It really is a classic, comparable--as the Amazon reviewer Jeff Shannon said--to ""Gone With the Wind.""  Indeed, there are significant parallels between the two.  The most visually emotional scene in ""Gone With the Wind"" was the receding wide-angle camera shot of the dead and wounded soldiers.  In ""Titanic,"" it is the unforgettable shot, not much above eye-level, of the dead victims of hyperthermia, their heads bobbing in the cold Atlantic.  Images like these become icons in one's personal memory--that with the beauty and grandeur of this world there are stark images of mass death to remind us of human follies like civil wars or ships that cut back on safety features or lifeboats.  To his great credit, Director Cameron did not play ""Can you top this?"" with ""Gone With the Wind,"" he played ""Can I match this and do it in a different way?""  But he shows that he is a student of many other movies.  Reviewers have cited the ""Romeo and Juliet"" aspects of the romantic story, but I don't know if anyone has mentioned Cameron's considerable borrowing from that great Charles Boyer-Jean Arthur film of 1937, ""History is Made at Night.""  No matter; you can see and enjoy both films without feeling that either detracts from the other.  A true ""homage"" can be like that.
  Many viewers might say that ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Titanic"" are epic love stories, and they of course are right, but I see the films as epics with love stories attached. Even within the love stories themselves, they are less about romance than they are about turning points in the lives of the heroines.  It was not Clark Gable that shaked Janet Leigh out of her Southern complacency; it was the civil war.  Similarly, it was the peril of a sinking ship that sent Kate Winslet back to try to save Leonardo DiCaprio in the hold even though, at that moment, he appeared to her to be an opportunist and a jewel thief.  Perhaps the most important factor in the success of both ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Titanic"" is that the epic story is intrinsic to the love story, and the love story is intrinsic to the epic.  This is not easy to do, as ""Pearl Harbor""-despite its great special effects--amply confirms.
  For all its borrowings, ""Titanic"" has a moment, at the very end, that has never been tried before in the history of the movies and probably will never be repeated.  Just when you think the picture is over, and you see the remains of the Titanic as it appears today at the bottom of the ocean, the camera takes you back into the ship and back in time and you proceed into the grand ballroom where all the characters in the fictional part of the movie are assembled.  And then you find that it is not you who is walking up the grand stairway, but rather it is Kate Winslet, and at the top is Leonardo DiCaprio in his street clothes as we remember him.  They kiss and everyone applauds. What James Cameron has given us in this final moment is nothing other than a Curtain Call.  It gives us the feeling, for once in the movies, akin to seeing the end of great play in the theatre.  It tells us of reality on two levels: the historical reality of the drama we have just seen, and the present reality of actors who have done some good work for us in telling us the story of that drama.",996537600,,3472,4.48489666136725

132511,5,0792151712,"Titanic. The ultimate movie. Winner of a lot of Academy Awards and who knows what else. I'm one of those people who thinks that the movie, the cast, and the crew got deserved all that it got.
 Everyone knows the plot, so I'm going to skip that. The acting is astounding. All of the performances are worthy, and are given with heart. Kate Winslet could not have, in any way, played her character any better. She was astounding, and so is her beauty. Leonardo DiCaprio was also good, but some of his dialogue seemed dull. But that didn't slow down any of the movie, nor did it really damage his performance. Billy Zane did well as the over-possessive poor excuse for a man. You really hated this man from the first shot of him in the movie. Gloria Stuart was awesome, and gave a little bit of humor to the movie. The rest of the supporting cast were wonderful, and I can't go without mentioning Kathy Bates. Her character, Molly, was the most lovable woman ever to grace the big screen, but that's just my opinion on that.
 Since I really don't know much about the directing elements of a film, I can't really comment on it, but I do know that scenes were well organized and the moods were set just right. The characters were introduced very approachingly, and never really focused on one character while the introductions were occurring. We were set up perfectly to know who we were going to be watching. When the sinking began, the movie took a faster pace, and did it well. All the while, focusing on Rose and Jack's love for each other.
 Titanic has gone down as classic, and certainly does live up to that standard.",996019200,,1618,4.477966101694915

132513,1,0792151712,"So this is the movie that garnered so much praise and worship.  Obviously this was not for the dialogue, as most of that is hackneyed phraseology suitable to be placed inside fortune cookies.  The plot is just as trite (for those of you not historically inclined, the boat DOES sink in the end).  The actors are interesting, especially Leonardo DiCaprio's uncanny and disturbing resemblance to a pre-pubescent girl.  Amidst all the clouds, there are only two moments that can possibly qualify as some silver lining.  First is when Kate Winslet is gratuitously naked.  However the brief respite brought by such hardcore nudity is lost in the rest of the miasma when one realizes that she disrobes so Leo can draw her.  A college-age male who sees a naked woman and thinks ""I have got to draw this""?  Obviously the writers passed their childhood in a hormone-free state, for while the pencil IS a phallic symbol, there is nothing like the real thing for most young males.  The second positive scene is when a man leaps from the top of the ship as it is sinking and caroms off the propeller.  He makes a comical noise, and it is funny to watch him spin into the water.  However, such brief levity cannot counterbalance the rest of the movie, which is an overlong, overindulgent, sappy excuse for cinema.  However, all is not lost.  If you want to cleanse yourself with a great movie, check out the VHS title WELCOME TO SPRING BREAK which will set your Titanic-darkened world afire.  A hero named Skip Banacheck, a psycho killer who appears to be the ghost of a recently executed biker gang leader, mountains of hair held in place by oceans of hairspray, and the immortal pickup line ""You want to get naked?"" followed by its sole competitor ""You want to get sloppy.""  All this takes place against the nonstop debauchery of spring break in South Florida.  This cinema gem is waiting for those numbed by such cliched collages of crud as Titanic.

132514,3,0792151712,"I enjoyed this movie very much. And I think it have fantastic cinematography and special effect. But, as far as the story goes, I am a little dissapointed. I am a history fan of the Titanic, and when this movie first came out, I was all excited and knew that I have to see this movie. Living in Asia, the informations and media about the Titanic is rather limited...thus I was hoping that this movie will be of a special visual feature on the actual event.
In that sense, I am grateful. The design, the cast, crew, sets..were authentic...top notch.( expt for Leonardo & Winslet's role). The dissapointing part of the movie is that it basically concentrated on the 2 young lovers.
I was hoping to see ,more of the roles of JJ Astor, Molly Brown, Guggenheim and all those important famous figures...but they are only basically background. The actual character of Molly Brown is a very fascinating character, and I was hoping Kathy Bates ( I love her ) would make a fantastic recreation of that remarkable woman. Instead, I found kathy Bates rather restrained in her role this time.
I must admit I was captivated by the finale...the final sinking of the Titanic. I was speechless.
Now, as for visual & effect.....this movie is gorgeous. But in term of story & characterization, I prefer the ""original"" Titanic starring David Janssen, Susan St. George, Gloria Leachman, Helen Mirren and Ian Holm.",995241600,2,1392,4.756198347107438

132556,5,0792151712,"Ah yes, the controversy and hype surrounding ""Titanic"" is nothing short of legendary.  Look back to ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Anthony and Cleopatra"" for a quick lesson in ""the-vehicle-is-bigger-than-the-film-itself.""
The special effects are impeccable, as is Cameron's historical detail.  One ""for-instance,"" when Jack is on the deck talking with Rose, he says, ""We've talked about how great the weather's been...""  This may seem to be a throw-away line, but it is, in fact, an important historical detail.  A warmer than average winter had caused icebergs to calve sooner and thus be further south--in the shipping lanes!  This may seem to be a small detail to those of you who love to hate Leonardo Decaprio, or love to malign films simply because they are so hugely successful, but James Cameron has created a movie masterpiece.
Sure, the acting could be better, as could the script.  But in terms of sheer movie making, the production aspects, ""Titanic"" ranks among the best films ever made.  The cultural phenomenon is an extra bonus to keep the ""event"" of the film alive in our consciousness.
Teenage girls repeatedly flocked to the theaters to see this 3 1/2 hour movie--why?  To fawn over Leo?  Some commentators have pointed to the cathartic experience of witnessing Jack give his life for Rose.  Very few films that appeal to as broad an audience as ""Titanic"" feature a self-sacrificial death as centrally as this one.  No happy ending here, and many young people found this fact intriguing enough to sit through it again and again.
The DVD has plenty of extra-features to keep the cino-philes happy, though I'm sure there will be a future release of another version (perhaps including the 1/2 hour of footage Cameron cut from the theatrical release).
Love it or hate it, ""Titanic"" will remain a milestone in cinematic history.  This is not a franchise like ""Star Wars,"" but is a single film that has ensured Cameron's place among Hollywood's greatest directors.",994896000,4,1972,4.996941896024465

Unfortunately, he has a screenplay that makes the Jacqueline Suzan books seem like exceptional writings by comparison.  His screenplay, and the actors that act out the scenes are so inept, and bring this epic down so far, that you have to stand in awe of how bad it is near the end.  So while there is that, at least some of the visuals are far out and EXTREME fans of Cameron might find some interest.  Otherwise, beware",994809600,9,695,4.3565891472868215
132558,4,0792151712,"Overrated by its admirers, underrated by its critics, ""Titanic"" is neither a masterpiece nor an abomination, as some have been won't to label it.  What it is, in fact, is one of the greatest anomalies in cinema history--a genuinely stirring, wrenchingly powerful drama, saddled with a screenplay so banal and unconvincing you can't help but marvel at its stupidity.  Never before has so much been wrought from so little.
The plot by now is well-known, and far be it from me to waste Amazon.com's valuable space by subjecting you to a recap.  What should be mentioned, however, is that amidst the clichs stands a love story that, against all odds, succeeds.  Certainly, Leonardo diCaprio and Kate Winslet are given some of the script's worst lines, but the sheer strength and likeability of their performances elevates them above the paper-thin stereotypes they have to work with.  It may very well be the acting coup of the century.
The same can hardly be said of anyone else.  Side characters, such as Rose's materialistic snob of a mother and her scowling snot of a fianc, are so wooden that their very presence becomes painful.  Even Kathy Bates, as the ""unsinkable"" Molly Brown, can't do much to enliven the proceedings.  And as the now-ancient, modern-day Rose, poor Gloria Stuart is forced to say things like ""A woman's heart is an ocean of secrets,"" while Bill Paxton and his crew have nothing to do but look on and pretend that they're actually taking her seriously.
But once ship and iceberg collide, ""Titanic"" finally kicks into gear, and what follows is both thrilling and utterly devastating--a disaster flick of the highest order.  Director James Cameron is nothing if not a technical and visual wizard, and the way he presents the ship's sinking, documenting a tragedy of unspeakably massive proportions while still managing to tighten the screws on Jack and Rose's situation, is quite brilliant.  Indeed, ""Titanic's"" second half is filled
with individual moments that grip and resonate, and Cameron even manages a few instances of heart-stopping lyricism.
In the end, ""Titanic"" is a big, dumb, unwieldy mess of a movie that by some undeserved miracle finds a way to soar on the wings of its own excesses.  The script is enough to make even the most incompetent of wordsmiths cringe, but the fact that the film still moves and engages--almost in spite of itself--suggests that it has moved into a realm where words no longer matter.  That's not necessarily a good thing, and it certainly doesn't bode well for the future of screenwriting, but it's an achievement nonetheless.  I suggest that when watching the film again--and it holds up remarkably well under repeat viewings--you try to remember ""Titanic"" as it was before the hype blew it to smithereens, before it won James Cameron a pair of Oscars to match his cojones, before Celine Dion's unmitigated screeching drove radio listeners to mass suicide.

As an amateur history buff, I enjoyed seeing the recreation of the Titanic's sinking, as well as the boat itself. However, the story line was disappointing.  I get frustrated when directors try to encorporate modern characters into historical settings.  Rose's behavior in the movie was completely unrealistic when historical context is taken into consideration.  The chances of a turn-of-the-century socialite being willing to pose naked, much less do it with a guy in the back seat of a car after having known him for only a few days are not good.  Nor would she likely be delighted to go downstairs to the steerage section and dance the night away among the rats, no matter how good the company. Also, I was annoyed by the attempt to show that women were treated like slaves in this time period.  Seems to me like they were the ones who got off the boat first... However, when I just accepted the fact that this would be another Hollywood version of history, I enjoyed the rest of the film.",993686400,,1177,4.576190476190476
132564,5,0792151712,"Before writing this review i sat to read some of the other reviewer's opinions and after half hour or so , i've come to the following conclusion : people these days are not able to let themselfs free and enjoy a movie . Instead they are desperately trying to find it's weaknesses , faults and bad points . Titanic's massive advertise campain and hype made many people for many reasons angry . Many of them decided not to go because "" ...it's stupid , it's all corny and romantic . I'm a more serious viewer . I won't go and see this mumbo-jumbo crap because it's been advertised so much "" . Talking about a film withought seeing it is , in my opinion , stupid . Others went to see it but where determent not to like it anyway .Others stucked to weird details . Read some of the following reviews and you'll see what I'm talking about : "" ...those people running around would have suffer from hypothermia "" or "" those Picasso paintings still exist in museums . What are they doing on that ship? "" are some of the lines you will read.  The fact is that Titanic made a lot of people who never went to cinema to start going to the movies . It touched and made many of them cry . But for some ,this prooves a lack of high I.Q . The fact that Cameron chose to tell a love story at the same time the ship-tragedy takes place is logical. Should he just have focused at the sinking part ? No in my opinion because this would have make the film seem like a cold documentary. Could the script and the dialogues have been more mature and deep ? I don't think so . I don't believe that all those people had the time to analyze the purpose of life and the vanity of human existance at that point . Panic is the only feeling they must have experienced during that tragic night. I understand it when people tell me that they  had a good time but weren't that thrilled with it . What i don't understand is how could someone detest Titanic so much to not like even one line ,  one image ( the frozen victims on the water for example ) , one perfomance .",993427200,4,2035,4.120906801007557
132585,1,0792151712,"OK, although I'm not a movie expert, I do consider myself somewhat versed in this field.  One of the things I look for in a movie is originality (YES, EVEN IN A TRUE STORY).  James Cameron knew this, and put in a love story on top of the historic event, which was the movie's downfall.  Love stories are fine.  Star Wars has a love story.  It's the type of love story that brought it down;  it took the soap opera route.  Girl fools around with guy when engaged to another guy.  The guy she's engaged, in a jealous rage, flips breakfast tables and slaps her in the face.  Originality?  Bah.  We've seen this stuff before.  Next thing, the screenplay.  The dialogue and plot movement are incredibly shakey.  They call this picture an epic, but we can't forget that scene when Leo teaches Kate to hock loogies off the deck.  When Leo and Kate are being chased, she flips one of the chasers the bird, which didn't enter pop culture until several decades later. The dialogue is stereotypical, with lines like ""never let go"" and ""I'm king of the world"" are so laughable in this, the most expensive disaster of the 1990s.
P.S.  You'll notice that I didn't even call Leo and Kate by their ""character names"" because there is no character development whatsoever.  They play themselves, not unlike their good friend, Ben Affleck.",993340800,11,1319,4.592274678111588
132586,1,0792151712,"As you watch Leonardo Di Caprio drown, frozen in the cruel arctic waters, it is hard not to experience a tremendous feeling of satisfaction; such is the art of James Cameron, the catharsis is overwhelming.  For more than two hours you have been wishing that Leonardo, along with most of the cast and crew, were dead, and then, there they are, breathing their last.  The film begins brilliantly with some lively and vulgar wordplay from an underwater salvage team - you could be forgiven for thinking you've put the wrong film in your player and are about to witness some made-for-video action and adventure flick - but no, there's been no mistake, you are about to see two hundred million dollars worth of the best that Hollywood has to offer: James Cameron has masterfully toyed with your expectations. Quickly we meet Jack (Leonardo) and, my, what a snivelling little weasel he is; within minutes a deep enmity is established between him and the gentle viewer.  From then on, Jack is placed in situations where the viewer might reasonably expect his imminent demise.  Thus Kate Winslett (Rose) could quite easily have pushed him overboard on several occasions, and smothered him on at least one other; Billy Zane could have shot him (rumour has it that in real life Billy actually did shoot Leonardo, and most of the budget of film was actually dedicated to the CGI recreation of Leonardo in the last 90 minutes of the film, and in the subsequent Oscar ceremonies, as well as in his so-called 'real life' ever after); he could have easily died during the Irish dancing and revelry; the possibilities are endless. The appearance of the iceberg is truly cause for celebration.  What a good iceberg it is, searching out and destroying this disgraceful cast and scruppering the film good and proper.  As the water itself, the very stuff of life, attempts to kill Leonardo, one feels sure that justice is about to be dispensed.  The denoument is delicious. A lovely postscript shows Rose thowing her priceless jewel into the depths of the Atlantic.  Rather than selling this, and using the proceeds to feed the hungry or heal the sick, she chooses to throw perhaps the equivalent of two hundred milliion dollars into the ocean, down the proverbial drain, as it were  - surely a wonderful symbol for the movie as a whole.",992476800,20,2317,4.801507537688442
132587,3,0792151712,"I was really looking forward to this movie. The story of the Titanic had always fascinated me, so when I heard that James Cameron was making a movie about it, I expected a real treat. Now this was not a horrible movie, I enjoyed it, but the first half is a complete crock of pure fantasy. The love story is idiotic, because a first class woman and a third class man would never be allowed to meet, and she would not allow herself to see him again if for some reason they accidentally met. The first half was a waste of my precious time and I was bored stiff. All I could think was how could anybody think that this would be remotely possible. But that aside, the last hour and a half are fantastic. When the ship begins sinking, the brilliant effects kick in, and we are treated to a horrifying sight as the ship slowly sinks into the icy waters of the Atlantic.

132590,5,0792151712,"Titanic.  The name itself means disastor, romance, heroism and tragety all in one.  But it also applies to the biggest, most succesful film of all time.  Describing the story is pointless seince almost everybody alive has herd of it.  The special effects for this film are breathtaking.  To call them phenominal is obviously an understatement.  Every rivit, every piece of wood, every piece of furniture is remade in increddible detail.  James Cameron obviously did his homework when he was making this film.  Almost everything about it is historically accurate, with 3 minor exceptions(Mr. Andrews did not notice the shaking in his cabin, there was no suction when the ship went down, and Mr Ismay was crushed by a funnel) Everything else is perfect in every way.  The sinking sequences are the best part and are worth watching, in fact, in my opinion, the final 10 minutes of the sinking sequence are the best shots ever to be made in a movie.  Ever.  When Jack and Rose are running around inside the ship, outrunning water your heart will jump.  Although you know they will make it it is still terrifying, the dim lights,green water and ever submerging corridors will make your heart jump.  The acting is superb and is well done.  The soundtrack is outstanding and perfectly captures the mood of the story and feeling.  I think it is the second best soundtrack ever made (Next to Independence Day)  Overall this is a fantastic movie that should not be missed.  Highly reccomended.",991785600,,1483,4.844621513944223

132592,4,0792151712,"When I first saw Titanic, I thought it was one of the best movies I'd ever seen. Upon a second viewing, however, I noticed things I hadn't before. Like to overdone romance that borders on Hollywood-cheesy.
The film itself is a marvel of modern technology. While some of the computer effects look artificial, there are some spectacular scenes, especially the whole sinking sequence, which takes up nearly a quarter of the movie. I will say that this is the best part of the movie (much like in Pearl Harbor, where the attack is the best).
The love story that is so central to this movie is well done and never really feels contrived. The meeting between Jack (diCaprio) and Rose (Winslet) is clever and believable, and their feelings grow toward one another naturally and at a good pace. The length of the movie helps you develop feelings for the main characters, and you want their love to continue uninterrupted. However, you cannot help shaking your head at some of the scenes, such as the completely contrived ""I'm flying Jack, I'm flying"" scene at the bow of the ship. Please.
Acting is superb, and it is through their roles in this film that diCaprio and Winslet became famous (diCaprio furthering his Hollywood stardom, and Winslet gaining recognition worldwide). Zane plays the part of the selfishly arrogant fiancee very convincingly, and you find yourself rooting against him throughout the film. The costumes and set decorations are very authentic, and through these the fated ship and its passengers come to life on the screen.
There are a lot of people out there that look at this film as a chick flick and refuse to see it because it gushes romantic. I understand why this would be so; this film is intended to be a love story based around a tragic, historical event, and it does a good job. A word of warning, however. The movie tends to border on the melodramatic a good deal of the time, and there is a fair amount of absurdly over-romantic scenes. Jack and Rose can't seem to love each other outside of a soap-opera, yet you find yourself wanting them to succeed despite this.
In short, this is an entertaining movie, worth watching if you have an interest in history as it brings the past alive. If you don't like romance, just skip to the last third of the movie, when the boat bites the bullet, and you shouldn't be too disappointed.",991267200,,2353,4.672289156626506
132593,3,0792151712,"I'll put in about 5 cents worth of advice here.
This isn't a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination.  If you want bad, see Battlefield Earth or Hackers and THEN tell me that Titanic is worse...and I won't believe you.
However, I give the movie 3 stars solely based on the shameful showering of awards at the Oscars.  Okay, it was a good--if improbable, to say the least--love story, but Academy Award material?  Come on!  Finer films like Brazil, Saving Private Ryan, or Dancers In The Dark delved far deeper into the human soul than Titanic did!  And let's not get into the social inaccuracies of this film...let's face it, it's about a modern-day woman trapped in a not-so-modern world and it was almost unheard of for classes to mix, much less for the upper class to so much as acknowledge the EXISTENCE of the lower.  The moment that Billy Zane's character was to hear of this, it would have almost immediately broken off the engagement as well as to render Kate Winslet a social pariah.
I inadvertently laughed at the theater as Billy Zane sulks like a child as Leonardo and Kate run off:  ""I hope you're happy together!""  Oh, waaaaah.
Still, with all its faults and undeserved acclaim at the Oscars, it's an entertaining yarn.  Just don't expect too much from it.  Yes, it's a love story, but if your heart is easily manipulated by those particular springs, then beware that you may never appreciate any other genre of film.",990748800,4,1435,4.6141732283464565
132634,5,0792151712,"Titanic was a great hit movie when it first came out. The movie made millions of dollars. Titanic was one of my favorite movies because it is based on a true story. The sinking of the Titanic was one of the worst tradiges of this century. Hundreds of people lost their lives in a very terrible way. The people that did survive are in their 90's or have already passed away.  In the movie, they focus on a certain family. Jack is a very poor teenage boy that falls in love with one of the richest girls at this time. Her name is Rose. Rose tells her fiance that she would rather be with Jack then to be with him. Her fiance was ferious and tried to kill Jack and Rose. During all of this, the ship had hit an iceberg and was beginning to sink. The people that work on the ship were trying to get the women and children in the lifeboats first. The problem was that there were not enough boats. That is the biggest mistake that the ship builder did. Mr. Andrews told Rose that ""it was thought by some that the deck would look too cluttered"". So because of this, people lost their lives and families were split up and crushed.  I give this movie 5 stars. It is really intense movie and a very sad movie.",990662400,,1199,4.163793103448276
132635,4,0792151712,"Against the backdrop of the oceanliner disaster we have one of the most incredible motion picture love stories of all time.  TITANIC is a breathtaking work of labor for it's director.  The notorious budget is at least evident on the screen in spades!  Every frame is a work of art - often a terrible picture of the reality of such a disaster.  Now you can almost feel like you are there.
The story is also quite good.  The social and moral issues addressed will leave you thinking about human nature.  Chances are you'll walk away from TITANIC wondering what you would do.
DiCaprio and Winslet are unforgetable!  I'm glad to see a full-figured woman in the lead of a major motion picture.  Hollywood has painted a picture of beauty in the form of the Kate Moss type for too long.  Also, Kathy Bates' Molly Brown is terrific when she declares:  ""Grab the oars ladies, we're going back!""  And Rose's mother wanting to be sure the seating on the lifeboat was separated by class.  There's just so much to like about TITANIC I can't see the faults that other people mention.  During the last moments of the ship going down I don't think I took a breath.  Anything less than 5 stars for the movie itself is inaccurate.
As for the DVD the sound was excellent 5.1 surround.  The picture is a different story.  I expected a standard super sharp picture thoughtout; but got one that is often faded, hazy or overly grainy.  At times the color was brilliant; other times lacking.  It should be better since this picture is only a few years old (1997).  On a scale of 1 to 5 I'd give the picture a 4 overall.  Still, it's better than my VHS tape copy.  But I can't give the DVD presentation a perfect 5 as I'd like to.

The acting was the way society behaved in the post-Victorian era.  It would have looked mighty strange for Jack to say something like ""Cool!"", now, wouldn't it?  I like the juxposition of modern time to 1912, because, then, you can see the difference and the contrasts of behavior and mannerisms.  I think that Leonardo DiCaprio was just fine as Jack.  It would have been totally out of character to try a method technique or a classic Shakesperean approach.  Remember, the character was only in his late teens-early twenties,tops.  If you look at pictures of some of the real passengers of that general age-group, some even looked younger, so I have no problem with it, myself.  It's just that people nowadays seem to perceive life through their own narrow-mindedness and shallow feelings.

132639,4,0792151712,"Generally speaking, I'm not a big romance fan. But this movie was one of the greatest movies of the 90s. For those of you who follow my writing, you know that I abhor (for the most part) Action movies. I am not against violence that has a purpose or is required to tell the story. But I have nothing but contempt for violence when it is used for entertainment. One action movie in particular (which is the object of my soul's hate) turned killing into a joke, took punch shots at people who were a little different, totally distorted history, and pretty much turned a conscience free mass of killing into a big joke. Well, ""The Titanic"" was a nice dose of reality. Not only does it have historical value, but it allows us to meet several people, and it shows us the true horror of people dying. People getting killed should not be a joke, and it should not be used for entertainment. And certainly the ridicule of different people should not be used for entertainment. (MG would do better to keep his bigotries to himself.) Well, that said, Jack could probably have acted a little better. But he performs his role at least moderately well. Rose is touching in the sorrows she is burdened with, and we may be able to feel her anxieties, and struggle along with her as she makes decisions that will permanently affect her. Molly Brown is really likable in her rough but compassionate role. Calvin may be close to psychotic, but he does carry charm now and then. We certainly won't route for Lovejoy, but there is something to be said for his loyalty to his employer. Thomas Andrews is especially well done. He is a very likable character who carries a voice of reason, and shows a memorable sense of honor and integrity. I could go on and on about the wonderful acting, but there is no need for that. The costumes are beautiful; the scenery is beautiful; the historical characters march along nicely with the fictional characters. I know some people question if the romance plot was required. In my opinion it was. You are free to disagree with me, but the way I see it is that anytime you have a great story, you need some central focus. Moving on, the music is also very well done. Overall, this movie has great scenery, wonderful acting, nice music, a strong story, touching characters, historical value, and a high sense of morality.

132640,3,0792151712,"It's funny in a way- Titanic became the most popular movie of all time (so far) according to grosses and that's only because teenage girls across the country saw it fourteen and fifteen times apiece!  But what a marvelous and equitable exchange.  Thanks to James Cameron, girls that weren't around in 1977 now have their own ""Star Wars"".  (Great bit, John, thanks for letting me borrow it.)  I won't bore anyone reading this with plot summary or the complete details of the story.  Come on.  We've all seen it.  We all know it.  I'll just give you my own personal take on it, okay?  Okay. First and foremost, I feel James Cameron o.d.'ed on himself.  I realize he's a talented filmmaker and a big mover and shaker in ""the biz"" (and he couldn't care less that I'm writing this) but the fact that he wrote it, directed it, and produced it, and everything else he had a hand in gives the whole production a kind of one dimensional feel.  I read that even the sketches that L. D.'s character ""Jack"" is supposed to have drawn were done by Cameron himself.  And those are his hands doing the picture of ""Rose"" on the couch.  I should have guessed whenever someone in the movie complimented Jack on his work.  ""These are good, Jack.  Very good!""  One can smell the self-appraisal all the way to steerage.  The rest of the dialogue isn't much better.  Don't get me wrong, I like his films ""Terminator 1 & 2,"" ""Aliens"" and ""the Abyss.""  But these are mainly science-fiction stories with messages about ourselves and each other with regard to the future which give the audience something to think about besides ""oh, what a great line!""  (I get the impression, J.C. is very anti-nuclear power but loves hydrolic machinery- look for it.  End of aside.)  However, in ""Titanic"" I felt like the dialogue was only interested in being clever or obvious and not at all realistic.  Such as: ""Of course it's unfair- we're women."" and not to mention: ""Mr. Andrews, I saw the iceberg and I can see it in your eyes...tell me the truth.""  And lest we forget: ""Trust me...you wanna take this call!"" followed shortly by, ""Told you you wanted to take the call.""  Ugh!  (By the way, how many times did they repeat the line: ""This is absurd!"")  Also, I started to notice the way Cameron ""slipped"" facts about the ship into the dialogue to show us how much research he had done.  The size of the ship, its weight, how many people it took to build, what the lifeboats were capable of, etc.  And as far as who spouted off these random statements of trivia... except for the ship's designer/engineer I had no idea the passengers were already so knowledgeable about Titanic on its maiden voyage. At first I thought that this was the first love story that Cameron had ever directed.  Until someone pointed out to me that all his films are actually love stories if looked at the right way.  ""That's true,"" I said, ""but this time it is the main plot instead of a subplot and creates a strange warped twist to the  movie.""  I'm so used to James Cameron being an action film director first and foremost.  But there not being much action until the iceberg strikes, I guess the love theme had to bubble to the surface of the story a little earlier than usual.  Which brings me to the actual sinking.  I'll be the first to admit, the special effects were impressive.  And like most of the people who wrote reviews before and after me, I agree that they preceeded the acting and stories on board the ship.  Almost paving the way for ""Phantom Menace"" a few years later.  But that's another review. My point is, everyone came to the movie to see the ship sink.  That's the whole idea!  There wouldn't have been a movie made or anyone who cared about a ship that had a successful humdrum voyage across the sea.  Quick lesson: Drama equals conflict.  You start a story with everything fine.  You create a problem.  Now, if you solve the problem, it's a comedy.  If you don't, it's a tragedy.  Of course I'm vastly overstating.  Forgive the generalization, but you people writing reviews about being upset with the film ending so sadly or for sinking the ship at all...  And those who wanted the Titanic to arrive in New York and have a Disney-ish happily ever after ending, I'm sorry..., but GET A CLUE!!!  Where are you from?  Where did you go to school?  That's what really happened!  The ship hit an iceberg and sank to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean!  Hundreds of lives were lost!  Deal with it!  Did you also write reviews on ""Gone With the Wind"" saying that you wish the South had won the Civil War so poor Scarlett O'Hara would not have had to suffer such hardship?!  Please.  (Okay, deep breath.  I apologize for that.  At least I didn't write it in all caps.) Anyway, to sum up:  I went with my then girlfriend to see this thing in the theatre and she cried while I analyzed.  (Not the most romantic guy that night, I know.)  But I helped her fall asleep in my arms later that evening by explaining to her why the movie had to end the way it did.  (I won't spoil the ending for the two people left in the western hemisphere who are reading this that haven't seen the flick.)  I said: ""If it ended happily, that would have been predictable.

First, the characters seemed very simple and empty.  Most of the characters in the film were introduced in the first 10 minutes and then disappeared for the next two hours until they died, yet the film was acting as though we should care.  I think the film would have been much better as 3-4 different character stories rather than as one love story.
The other thing that ruined this film was the hype.  I, fortunately, saw it opening night.  I enjoyed it.  The next several months it was painful to see how people obsessed on this film.  I'm sorry, but the love story wasn't THAT good.  It was contrived from 19th century British literature.  The rich woman is supposed to marry the jerk, but is in love with the poor free spirit.  Puh-lease.  It's a friggin' Gilbert and Sullivan opera.  I was waiting for Leo to say, ""Ha Ha!  But I am rich after all!""  It was almost that bad.

But it would be highly desirable to know what you're talking about before you make a fool of yourself. For instance, one reviewer said that the movie would have been better if the Titanic actually reached NY. Well, it would have been DIFFERENT, except that the really Titanic sank more or less exactly as depicted in the film. Cameron made some gnarly mistakes with the script, but he wasn't stupid (or brilliant) enough to change history for his little blockbuster.  Another reviewer commented that what happened in the movie wasn't possible. Cameron's characters are all strong, if somewhat cliched, but everything they did was possible. Love is LOVE, no matter where you throw it in what era. Of course, social opinion has differed over the ages, and it always affects people, but if no one before now ever thought to go against public opinion, or choose happiness over wealth, we'd be nowhere. There is such a thing as human feeling... and doesn't the film make it perfectly obvious why Jack went to dinner with Rose? He'd saved her life! And anyway, nobody but Rose approved--at least, nobody but those people who were actually fooled into thinking Jack was first class, and those (like Andrews and Kathy Bates) who were too down-to-earth and reasonable to whine about Rose's dinner guest. And it's quite obvious that both Ruth and Cal went out of their way to embarrass Jack.  I suppose what I mean is that, while this movie has its faults (and some of them are pretty big) it's JUST a movie--a few people's idea of a good love story. It was historically accurated, entertaining, emotionally elavating and stimulating, etc. I agree that DiCaprio wasn't the best choice for Jack by far, but Winslet was incredible enough to make up for it, and anyway, he pulled it off OK.

All right- I hated the movie.  The special effects were incredible, but the rest was dumb.  Reason: too predictable.
Now, I don't mean, ""Oh, the ship is going to sink.  It is too predictable.""
What I mean is, I saw the movie and could, at every single scene, predict what was going to happen in the next three scenes.  And, I was right all along!  It was like every other romance movie.  It doesn't deserve those awards it got.  It was just another pointless movie.

I predicted at once that the movie was a sappy love story playing off of the teenage generations then-obsession with girly Leonardo Dicaprio, and when I finally saw it, I was not surprised.  Line after line of vapid dialogue assaulted me from all sides; I was pounded unconscious by the lack of plot or charcacter development.  Kate Winslet's being the exception, every character in the movie was as one-dimensional and cliched as could be.  The only thing that saved this film from total turkeydom in my opinion is the amazing special effects during the sinking scene, a Cameron trademark, and the enjoyment of seeing a few Cameron regulars (Bill Paxton and Jeanette Goldstein, to name a few).  Overall, unless you still have something for Leo, or Kate, for that matter, avoid this cliched monster of a mishap.

The look of the film is amazing; its period detail and grand ocean vistas make this a widescreen must.  Still, the main reason for the picture's success is the adept handling of its love story; this really is as close to a big-screen homage of THE LOVE BOAT as we are likely to get.  (I kept looking for Gopher or Isaac, the bartender, to show up in cameos, but they never do).  While the overall excellence of the film is beyond question, I feel it was a mistake to sink the ship.

Except for a couple of minor inaccuracies for the sake of the drama, Cameron changed very little from the true story of the Titanic, and had little touches that a Titanic buff could appreciate like the Head Baker hanging onto the railing as the ship went down. It actually happened. So what if he invented Jack and Rose, he gave us a film that let us see and feel the hopes, dreams, and heartbreaks of 1500 people who died in the North Atlantic in a way that we could grasp it.

Score: 98/100
It's a commonly asked question around the world these days, ""How many times have you seen Titanic?"" Well, it just so happens that I would rank up there with the people who have seen it over 10 times, as I have seen it 13 times. It's an instant classic of a movie that ranks up along the movie it's pays dedication to, A Night to Remember. In fact, it's better.
Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) is a treasure hunter looking for a famous diamond among the debris of the Titanic. He finds a sketch in a safebox in which a young woman is wearing the diamond on a necklace. After showing the drawing on a TV program, Rose Dawson (Gloria Stuart), an old lady comes forward claiming to be the woman in the drawing. She is brought to the explorer's vessel to help them determine the location of the diamond, but instead she tells everyone the ""real"" story of Titanic's sinking. She was a 17 year-old rich girl (played by Kate Winslet) sailing to the USA to get married with Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). Her mother Ruth (Frances Fisher) was forcing her to get married so she felt trapped inside her own world. During the trip she tries to commit suicide and she is saved by Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), a third-class passenger who travels around making pencil drawings. They get to know each other better until eventually they fall in love which causes trouble for Hockley and Ruth who try unsuccessfully to keep them from seeing each other. Amidst all this confusion the Titanic hits an iceberg and starts to sink...
There is no question about it, Titanic is a landmark. It not only won 11 Academy Awards, but it left a space in my and other critics heart's which is not often fulfilled. It is hard for me to go to sleep at night without thinking about the disaster of the R.M.S Titanic, and I have the crew of this movie to thank for that. The film's technical department is remarkable, they actually built a ""new"" Titanic to make this movie, and it was well worth it. The sound and effects are truly breathtaking, while the editing and cinematography are beautiful and add a spark to the film. James Cameron's direction effort is brilliant, he may be a show-off about this movie now, but why shouldn't he? It's a masterpiece and it deserves to be praised highly by it's director and everyone else in the world.
Add to that a sizzling romance between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, some amazing set decoration, a heartpounding and heartbreaking score & an end sequence that is truly unforgettable and you have what is the closest the world will ever get to the best romance film of all time.",986688000,2,2606,4.55863539445629

By watching this movie, you can easily tell it's from the man who brought us FX-heavy offerings like ""Aliens"" and ""Terminator 2,"" and the reason those movies succeeded is because the characterizations were up to snuff with the eye candy.  With ""Titanic,"" Cameron (who wrote some...or all? of the script) nurses along a chemistry-free romance between Tiger Beat pinup Leonardo DiCaprio (who would've been wise to redeem himself by playing Patrick Bateman in ""American Psycho,"" but what do I care), and the abominably Victorian Kate Winslet (who fared slightly better in this year's ""Quills,"" but not by much); where audiences and critics saw a romance for all generations to cherish, blah blah blah, I saw two woefully beautiful people choked by a script that gave them the usual ""rich-girl-falls-for-poor-boy"" cliches, all while CGI special effects and expensive set design ran them over like cockroaches.

132680,2,0792151712,"The effects ARE good, but that is nothing special these days, is it? What annoys me most about the film is that they have taken a historical event which is, by its very nature, set at an historical period. However this doesn't stop the film makers who are supposedly trying to make everything as authentic and detailed as possible from giving us a story that simply defies the social behavior of people of the time. To what am I referring? Well, there is NO WAY that the lower class would have even seen each other during the voyage, let alone allowing one of them to walk around on the upper decks or invite them to soirees. NO WAY!  The upper class treated the lower class like scum in those days. It is a social fact that has been deliberately misrepresented. Hollywood!  And she is supposed to give up on her whole social class and go off with a poor man whom she loves. We are supposed to believe that she is willing to give up her life of luxury for such thing. Love has no bounds I hear you saying, but come on, face it! Love doesn't go that far, especially in those days.  This is an overrated film, and would someone mind telling me just what women see in Mr De Caprio! Do you know how short the guy is?

132681,3,0792151712,"This film is an equally divided story between the Titanic and the Romance between the main charecters.  I'm sick of hearing people say this movie was 'original'...The Titanic was real and sunk(obviously) and the love story has been SO overdone that it hurts me!  There are only 6 ways to tell a love story and the formula here is one of the most popular and overdone.  If you ever saw 'Tarzan', heck, or even 'George of the Jungle' then you seen the love story in Titanic.  Girl from right side of tracks in discontent, meets boy from wrong side of tracks, girl's rich, storng and handsome boyfriend gets jealous, boy does 'fish outta water' when he....yada yada yada...blah blah blah.  Predictable.
Another thing i don't understand was Leo's charecter.  Why do people love him so much? is it only cause Leo was playing it?...The charecter had NO faults whatsoever...I'm sorry, but even the best 'good guys' in the best stories have faults.  thats what make them so good and believable.  Leo's charecters was obviously *just* a charecter.  there was no sense of realism about him.
Just because this is the all time best money making movie doesn't mean much.  The *only* reason this is number 1 box office money maker is cuz most of the female audience went and saw it again, and again and again...I bet we all know someone, or at least know someone who knows someone who has seen this in the theatre anywhere from 5-15 times.  I know of three girls.  And yes, one of them saw it in the theatre 15 times.  I swear there must be something subliminal here that called them all back.......isn't that illegal now?
The real good thing about this movie is the story of the Titanic itself.  Now we all know it sinks, but the story is *how* it gets there.  This film does a good job of making you feel you are a passenger of Titanic and are really there when the stuff hits the fan(or the ice berg) You may even weep for all the ill fated people.  I did...that shot of the old couple spooning and as sure as tears are rushing down their cheeks, the cold ocean water is rushin under their bed....that shot gets me every time.
The authenticity of the sets to what the Real Titanic was and had was remarkable.  Definately a A+ for effort for Cameron there.
Overall, yes, this is a good movie, don't be scared away from the predictable love story...to me, this movie is truly about Titanic...of course it is, even the title says so :-)",985996800,2,2422,4.505720823798627
132682,5,0792151712,"The Titanic is a symbol of fascination for millions of people, its tragic story weaving a web of enchantment in our minds. Many films have tried to capture the events of the great ship's demise, but none of them can compare to James Cameron's ""Titanic,"" an epic of grand proportions. The sweeping grandeur and large scale used for the film bring the Titanic to breathtaking life, and Cameron's attention to meticulous detail makes this recreation superior to all others. His insertion of a fictional love story does not bog the movie down, but gives it an emotional terminal with which the audience can connect.
The opening sequences begin the story of one man's dive down to the great hulking wreck of the Titanic, sitting in total darkness, its metal giving way to strands of rust and decay. Some of the footage used for this section is reality-based, which gives the film a more authentic as well as emotional feel to it. Here we are, watching the Titanic as it is today on the big screen, something the people who lived during the time of its sinking never even dreamed of. This is one of the many contributions to the scale factor of the movie, and seeing it in its decrepit yet intact form on the ocean floor is guaranteed to provide a chill or two.
This man combing the wreck is Brock Lovett, who is hunting down a diamond rumored to have gone down with the ship in 1912. His expedition brings back a small safe from one of the many staterooms aboard the ship, but when they pry it open, the only thing they find it piles of decayed money and a single portfolio with a drawing in it. The drawing is of a woman, naked on a divan, wearing that same diamond he is hunting. Now as luck would have it, his interview with a news crew provides a glimpse of that rare work of art, drawing the attention of Rose Calvert, who immediately calls Lovett and heads out to the ship's location.
This is the point at which the tragedy of the ship's maiden voyage begins, as Rose begins to recount her experiences from the time of departure to being picked up by the Carpathia in the morning hours of April 15th. She boards the ship with an overly selfish mother and a dashing yet arrogant husband, both of whom wish she would conduct herself in a more civilized manner. From the introduction of this relationship, we immediately get the feeling that Rose feels weighed down by her situation, wanting nothing more than to break free and be the person she wants to be, without all the wealth and fancy accommodations of high class society.
She finds an outlet, of course, in Jack Dawson, with whom she develops a friendship as the ship makes its first voyage across the ocean. Their chance meeting takes place at the stern of the ship, where she is about to throw herself into the sea, only to be talked out of it by Dawson. From that point on, they spend much time together, giving Cameron a chance to build their bonds while surrounding them with all the glorious detail and spectacle that is the mighty ship. Decks, rooms, dining areas and saloons are all faithfully recreated here with a style and flair that clearly looks back to the Gilded Age, where nothing was considered too fancy or over-the-top if it looked expensive enough. Cameron's attention to detail keeps us from haggling over historical accuracy and allows us to follow the human story he embodies in Jack and Rose.
Rose continues to see Jack, but feels threatened when Cal voices his commanding opposition to her escapades onboard. Her mother also gives her a stern lecture, ripping into her with past events that have left them in a situation they cannot break free of. At least her mother can't, but Rose does not care; he knows what she feels for Jack, and in the last hours before the ship's collision with an iceberg, they do everything together. Jack draws Rose's portrait, the same one from the beginning of the movie, they make love in the backseat of a car in the storage deck, and cause all sorts of little mayhems all aboard ship. This sets up the second half of the movie in such a way that we wish it would never happen. We have come to love and care for these characters as much as they do for each other, so that when things begin to get harried, all we want is to see them survive.
This aspect of the movie is worked quite nicely; the love relationship between Jack and Rose needs no more time to be further developed because we already believe in their love for one another, and it is this relationship that connects us with the real story behind the Titanic's sinking, and that is the human drama. People actually died on this ship; it sometimes is a forgotten piece of information, but Cameron, along with his cast of thousands, is able to evoke emotion and feeling for these people as the final moments come to a close.
As the ship sinks, the movie settles into certain questions: What would you do in those situations? Who's going to survive? Will Cal try to win Rose over again, or will his arrogance and pride get the better of him? And how will it all end? The answers unfold, pretty much one right after another, allowing us to pay more attention to the technical details of the sinking as well as those involved in key scenes. Cameron places his fictional characters into places that lead to historical shots, from the lowering of certain lifeboats to the actions of the passengers. We are also witness to the somewhat hostile treatment of the third class below decks, who are not allowed up onto the top deck to evacuate the ship until first class has finish loading, adding to the emotional buildup while keeping the story moving and authentic.
This movie gives us unique perspectives of the grand ship, before, during and after its intense demise. The use of computerized effects in addition to scale models and life-size sets all contribute to making the audience wonder what is computer and what is reality. But what's even better is that the effects are so good that we barely spend any time pondering that question, and watching them will leave you awestruck and breathless. Everything is perfectly placed, seamless and true to life, and vividly recreates every nuance of the Titanic's life with austerity and grandeur. I felt that the special effects, while being plentiful, did not weigh the story down; they tell the story.
The cast for this movie is superb, with our star-crossed lovers Jack and Rose being played by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio. This is probably the only movie I'll ever be able to sit through that has him in its cast, but he does quite well, and he and Winslet have an intense chemistry that is believable and never questioned. Yes, it's possible Cameron cast him for the sake of bringing in a larger audience, but he is able to play the part, so there's no reason to complain. Winslet is the most complex character, experiencing emotions from both sides, and her decisions and thought processes are conveyed beautifully by the actress. Billy Zane is the pompous Cal Hockley, and Zane practically resurrects the social attitudes and circles of aristocracy through his performance, embodying manipulation and evil while also possessing a minute amount of fear when things call for desperate measures. Rounding out the cast are veteran actress Gloria Stuart, playing Old Rose with wit and emotion, Bill Paxton in the role of Lovett, Bernard Hill, Francis Fisher, Jonathan Hyde and Victor Garber, among others, and all of whom bring added life and angles to the storytelling.
""Titanic"" is universal in that it offers something for everyone: visuals for the FX aficionados, a romantic love story for those with soft spots, and a historical accuracy unparalleled by any other film. This film brings Titanic back to life, puts you on those decks with our characters, and then pulls them out from under you as its story's intensity heightens. The success of this film is as colossal as its subject matter, which makes it one of the best motion pictures of 1997 as well as of all time.",985305600,2,7998,4.6450247000705716
132723,4,0792151712,"Notice how I didn't say inaccurate.  I am certainly willing to concede alot to Mr. Cameron for his dramatic license.  However, having viewed 'Titanic: Death of a Dream' which I believe was done by A&E I have to take issue with the fact that some very glaring deficiencies were nowhere to be found in this somewhat fanciful drama.  Although I certainly feel that the shipboard events were sufficiently dramatized if not necessarily perfectly.  I personally would have liked for the film to have emphasized to a greater extent the fact that the majority of the third class passengers couldn't read or speak english and the effect that had in the evacuation.  Or the fact that the radio men were too busy sending personal messages of wealthy passengers even after they had initially been advised of the situation.  The list goes on and on.
And despite my better judgement and initial expectations I have returned to the film over and over again with great enjoyment.  And on the positive side I learned something that other films be they documentaries or dramas never really emphasized, the fact that the majority of passengers who were left in the water froze to death.  Even though that's perfectly logical I just had never thought about that.
Nonetheless the film is epic and Mr. Cameron has created a marvelous film.  Grandiose in its spectacle and true to the spirit of the overall event.
And I just have to mention that Celine Dion's My Heart Goes On is for the first time in many years, in my opinion, a song and a performance truly worthy of the academy award.  Powerful and heartfelt.
All criticism aside it is a film truly worthy of the Best Picture designation.",984614400,,1669,4.743944636678201
132724,4,0792151712,"Well, James Cameron surely viewed the movie Somewhere In Time to help him for the storylines!! But Somewhere In Time with low budget in 1980, is a more better TRUE LOVE and ROMANCE story than this movie and also to me a better movie. In Somewhere In Time, the love between Christopher Reeves and Jane Seymour (What a beautiful women in this movie!!!!!) is credible and the story focus on their love. Surely, the Titanic story would help any average scipt to be a success. To me, Kate Winslet is beautilful and delivered good acting but it is not her best performance.

132725,5,0792151712,"There's a lot that can be said about Titanic. From a cold, objective viewpoint, it is not the best made film of all time. James Cameron's blue lightbulb returns with a vengeance, lighting up every night-shoot as it did throughout Aliens, The Abyss and Terminator 2. The acting is not the greatest ever, Leonardo Di Caprio emulating a Hollywood pretty boy and not the great character actor that I firmly believe he is. The music is syrupy and over-emotional. The script falls flat in far too many places to make a coherent whole. The computer graphics are just that: computer graphics. The cross-barrier love story is pass. The incredible historical accuracy is blown by a poorly-timed middle-finger `birdy' gesture (not invented until years after the Titanic sailed). Cameron's stubby fingers that draw a gratuitously nude Kate Winslet are clearly not Di Caprio's. The final hour and a half's over dependence on special effects divorces you from the love story, so the ending does not move you. And, worst of all, it spawned an annoyingly gushy song. From a cold, objective viewpoint, Titanic is appalling.
From a warm, subjective viewpoint, Titanic is great. It is one of those few films that completely sucks you into its world and smothers you in every nuance of the story. In hindsight, you can slag it off all you want, but whilst you're watching it you forget you're watching a film, and you forget you're you. Your own life be damned, you care about Jack and Rose as if they are parts of yourself. It's as if you're wearing blinkers; you're so absorbed, you're on the Titanic and sailing onwards towards a fateful rendezvous with destiny. You want to be Jack Dawson, and you fall in love with Rose just as he does (unless you're a girl, in which case I'm assuming it's the other way around). It sounds cheesy, but there are so many people I know who claim that Titanic changed their life, and I'm one of them. Jack Dawson's `make each moment count' philosophy meant that I followed my dreams rather than doing a stuffy university degree course (English Lit and Psychology). It works as a painkiller too - any time you want to escape your own life, just watch Titanic, and for three hours nothing matters to you more than the poignant intrigues of two characters onboard the tragically-fated liner. There is no tangible reason as to why this film is so absorbing, given the objective viewpoint, but there is something there that prevents it ever getting boring and keeps drawing you back into its soporific world. Titanic is truly a monumental moment in film history, and a treasured classic you'll keep returning too.
Obviously, it depends on your viewpoint as to whether you'll like this film. I heard plenty of people saying it was an hour and a half too long, that the opening half of the film is nothing more than a chick flick and could have been ditched in favour of the last half. To those people I'd say: try and switch off your objectivity. If you open yourself to this movie, turn off all the lights, unplug the phone and watch it with a genuine sensitivity, it cannot fail to seduce you and charm itself into your favour. Unlike other films, it has that ability to convince you it's entirely real. It's an escapist's dream. So not only do you get a video, you get a whole other world.

One day, though, I don't know how, I got sucked into watching this film. It was too long. The dialogue was completely stilted and forced. And of course there were ridiculous parts, like Billy Zane chasing people with a gun on a ship that was already doomed. The love story I could have done without. The story of the Titanic and its doomed maiden voyage... classic, well told and duly dramatic enough to convey the sheer magnitude of this tragedy. The set and costumes were lovely.

132803,3,0792151712,"'Titanic' was quite the phenomenon when it came out.  There is no movie that I can think of, at least in my lifetime, that became the cultural event that it did.  There were many concerns within the film community that the film was going to be a disaster.  James Cameron had spent a long time finishing the film and it was the most costly film ever made.  Many people thought it was bring an end to his career.  All these concerns and predictions were shattered when 'Titanic' came out; it became the highest grossing movie ever and it won more Academy awards than any other movie.  It skyrocketed the careers of both Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio.  I went to the theatres to see it with family and friends.  It was an incredible experience and several people around me were crying.  There were very few movie I had ever seen before that had mesmerized me as much as this movie did.

I watched this movie in its entirety for the first time in years.  The reaction is much different now and the film seems much less impressive.  First of all, the graphics in 'Titanic' have not aged well.  When the ship is sinking, the CGIs look really fake and dated.  Also, the model ship they used doesn't look very good either.  It looks cheap and like it was made out of plastic!  This does not surprise me because most film do not age well; a new generation of film lovers will not find certain films as impressive as the last generation.  Putting that aside, the story of 'Titanic' is not that bad.  I think most people know what the story is about so I do not need to explain it.  The acting is slighly above average, but the screenplay is so cliched and corny, I can understand the acting did not need to be that impressive.  The last forty minutes of the film consists of the two main characters shouting, ""Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack!  Rose, Rose, Rose, Rose!""  They must love each other so much that they can't think of anything else to say.

I don't think 'Titanic' is destined to become a classic.  Even though it made so much money and won so many awards, I think most people now see the movie as an embarassment.  Now that I am older and wiser, 'Titanic' just seems like a medicore film.  Pretty disappointing considering how much the movie was loved when it first came out.",982368000,,2268,4.404819277108434
132804,1,0792151712,"Titanic is the classic ""style over substance"" film. Sure, the special effects are eye-candy to say the least but I believe Cameron (who's supposed to be a ""perfectionist"") should have cut down on the FX and used some of the money to hire a decent script-writer. The Rose-Jack love story (if one can call it ""love"") is one of those ""trite and true"" sappy love stories you've seen ten times over in other Hollywood romance films and novels - you know, poor little rich girl falls in love with poor little boy (who in this case looks like a girl) against her mother's (and fianc&eacute;'s) better judgment. Each of the other characters was a cardboard cut-out stereotype - the Victorian villain of melodrama (Cal, Rose's fianc&eacute;), the diamond-in-the-rough poor folk (almost every character with an Irish accent) and the snooty upper-class twit (every single first class passenger, with the possible exception of the ""unsinkable"" Molly Brown). The dialogue is laughably bad, with Jack and Rose talking and behaving like two sexed up teens from the 1990's. Leo, as most people would have guessed, was hired for the sole purpose of enticing teenage girls into going to see the film, and then going to see it again, and again, and again etc. The Freud/Picasso in-jokes were also horribly stupid and invalid - Freud had not been translated into English yet, and none of Picasso's works were on the Titanic! I could write a ten-page essay on the various other goofs and aphorisms I spotted (e.g. filtered cigarettes in 1912? a world map with present-day international boundaries?). How this film ever got past the editing room remains a mystery.
The worst aspect of this film is that it isn't even about the Titanic itself. The disaster is merely the setting for the aforementioned ""love"" story. The sinking of the Titanic was the worst tragedy in maritime history, and involved REAL people, not two time-warped nineties mall rats and a couple thousand cardboard cut-outs! Come to think of it, Cameron could've based his film around any major disaster in history, added the characters of Jack and Rose and he would've had more or less the same result. Maybe Cameron thought that watching Jack and Rose wading through raging waters in the bowels of Titanic was more ""romantic"" than seeing them skip hand in hand over burning planks of wood during the Great Chicago Fire.
My favourite scene in the film: while the ship is slowly sinking, and while people are either screaming their lungs out, freezing to death or being sucked in to rotating propellers, all that Rose can think of saying is ""Jack, this is where we first met!"". How romantic! Please, for the sake of good art, don't buy this travesty! If you already own it, bury it....no, even better - burn it this instant!",982195200,17,2769,4.843881856540085

132808,5,0792151712,"What I can't understand is why so many people had to diss TITANIC. I mean, sure, it was a love story (but don't all Hollywood films have some kind of romance in them - even when it's a horror or an action movie?) and TITANIC is definitely one of the best love stories ever told through a Hollywood film.
First of all, I don't understand what was so wrong with Leonardo DiCaprio's acting in this film as he portrayed the character of Jack Dawson; I personally thought he was excellent in the film and TITANIC was one of his best and smartest moves in his entire acting career. Kate Winslet was also at her best as she portrayed the character of the young Rose DuWitt Bukater, Jack's love interest. The best thing about her is that Kate is British, just like Rose was, so she had the perfect British accent and talent for the character of Rose. Billy Zane was also excellent as Cal. Francis Fisher, Kathy Bates, Victor Gerber, Gloria Stuart, and Bill Paxton were also amazingly talented.
James Cameron once again proved to be one of the greatest directors of all time, and everybody thought that this film would sink in the box office just like the ship itself did in the ocean...but the world was dead wrong! TITANIC became the biggest gross-selling movie of all time - it even beat George Lucas's STAR WARS, as the top movie of all time. Not only was the acting First Class, but the special effects and James Horner's score were fabulous, which brought helped to bring the past back to life. And James Cameron also did an amazing job bringing accurate historical events into the film.
All in all, TITANIC is definitely the best movie of all. I really enjoyed it when I saw it in the theater (and I even own the video, although I haven't watched it in a while) and I still love it. The movie is just amazing (there is no other way to describe it) and it definitely deserved all the Oscars and Golden Globes it won. The film is the most moving, heartwarming and heartwrenching movie I've ever seen and the epic tale of the film is unforgettable.

Theaters were packed to the gills on all screening and the movie ceased being just a movie and became a phenomenon.  Titanic mania was everywhere, from books to the soundtrack which spent an amazing 18 weeks at number and you couldn't turn on a radio and not hear Celine Dion's omnipresent ""My Heart Will Go On"".

Known for his use of special effects, Titanic boasts some stunning visuals.  The detailed recreation of the doomed ship is stunning.  The sinking of the ship is terrifying and breathtaking.  Amid all these effects is a classic Hollywood love story.  Mr. DiCaprio's Jack is a rogue who wins his way into the third class steerage section in a card game while Ms. Winslet's Rose is from a family of means and travels in the first class section with her money hungry mother (played by Francis Fisher) and her loathsome fianc&eacute;e Cal (played with an evil sneer by Billy Zane).  Jack and Rose meet on deck and quickly fall in love.  They are meant for another, but their love is doomed from the start.  The tragic ending to their relationship will leave you misty-eyed.

News for those who don't know: this movie is based on the story of a (poorly designed and built) real ship which sank on its only voyage. Given that basic fact, the makers of this movie built a compelling story which I like to watch on occasion.

132833,3,0792151712,"Being of a rather sensitive nature, I steered clear of ""Titanic"", mostly because I did not want to witness the deaths of the 1500-plus people who perished in the icy Atlantic waters in 1912. Thus I only recently saw the film on video, months after all the hype, the awards, and subsequent hoopla had played itself out. ""Titanic"" is certainly a lush, beautifully photographed and well-mounted film, although it is almost a bit too ""slick"" for my tastes. I thought Leo and Kate were blandly likeable, but I was not very much interested in their characters or their performances. The supporting cast, however, was top-notch, in particular Frances Fisher's remarkably restrained performance as Rose's mother. Ms. Fisher did more acting with a 3-second, tight-lipped glance of disapproval then Leo did with 3 hours worth of stilted charm. And Billy Zane managed to twist his classically handsome features into an oily--and sometimes frightening--visage of callow shallowness. The wonderful Kathy Bates always lends a touch of class to whatever role she undertakes, and as Molly Brown she doesn't disappoint. I would have been much more interested in the plot if the story had been told from Molly's perspective rather than Rose's. But the real point of the film is the tragedy itself, which is depicted with harrowing, overwhelming clarity during the sinking sequence. On this level, I think the film was fully realized; however, the fictitious story line is seriously flawed, and I have a difficult time believing Leo as a romantic leading man.

132834,5,0792151712,"How best to describe this astonishingly epic film of love, loss, and heartbreak?  I truly can't understand why people have so much trouble with the romance aspect of the film.  James Cameron chose to tell the story of Titanic through the eyes of Jack and Rose to give us some sort of connection--to make us, the audience, feel for and care about these characters.  And because we cared about the characters, are hearts broke for the people on the ship as we suddenly could understand the pain every single passenger must have felt, becasue we experinced it through the eyes of Jack and Rose.  That's what Mr. Cameron was trying to get us to see.  If it hadn't been for the romance story, it would've just been another movie about the Titanic.  The romance aspect was to make us want the ship to not sink, and I applaud Mr. Cameron for his effort.
No, I don't think the movie is simply a ""teeny-bop"" or chick flick.  James Cameron is a master at conveying the human condition and telling a good story, and this is his best work to date.  Even people who don't like ""chick flicks"" should appreciate the bite-your-nails suspense, and the historical accuracy of the film.  Every one involved worked their butts off to produce an extraordinary film, and they succeeded.
As a Titanic buff, I know and appreciate how accurate the movie is.  Go read the transcripts of the American Inquiry--the investigation into the sinking--and you'll discover that in Cameron's film, everyone is where he or she claimed to be at almost every moment.  Of course there are minor inaccuracies, but those pale in comparison to all the stuff they fot right.
Not only that, but I feel the characters are strongly written and well-acted.  I think that Rose DeWitt Bukater is one of the strongest and complicated female characters in any recent film, and Kate Winslet brough her extraordinary passion and talent to the film.  Even DiCaprio was right as Jack--I dan't care what all you jealous males out there think.
Yes, I cringe at lines like,""A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets,"" but give the film the credit it deserves.  How can anyone who considers themselves to be remotely human not be touched in some way by this film?  Who does not crave for a love like that?
The special effects are spectacular, and James Horner's score is amazing.  This movie is absolutely magnificent.  It will always be one of my favorite films, and once again, James Cameron proves himself a master.
My only problem is with the DVD itself, which is why I'm giving it four stars instead of five.  It has a nice presentation, but there are almost no special features at all.

At over three hours long, it is a very long film, but I never once lost interest whilst watching. With a powerful supporting cast including Kathy Bates and Billy Zane, this really is a film that you shouldn't miss out on. OK, so the ending was never going to be much of a suprise, but that only heightens the drama previous to the actual sinking - which is in itself a spectacular affair, showing the stern of the ship splitting in half and crashing into the ocean before rising vertically in the water.

132837,4,0792151712,"I continue to enjoy ""Titanic"".  I continue to rewatch the video.  Now that the theme song no longer ""goes on"" (and on and on...!) I continue to enjoy the soaring, powerful soundtrack on CD. To me, Cameron's epic film is not about the syrupy love story.  And the ship is certainly not simply the vessel which conveyed Winslett and DeCaprio to teenybopper godhood.  I'm not saying the love story is superfluous -- the improbable romance between a society girl and a commoner allows a view of both First-Class and Steerage-Class, and showcases the social class distinctions of the period.  This very interesting contrast had not previously been depicted in earlier films, which had focused mainly on the famous upper class passengers.  Therefore I'll refrain from criticizing the romantic plotline overmuch.  Anyway, for me, the star of the movie is the Titanic itself.  Cameron paid amazing attention to detail, recreating every set to look exactly like photos of the real ship.  The engine room is a masterpiece.  Filmed on a living, restored Liberty Ship (whose powerplant is a fraction of the size of Titanic's), CGI was employed to create miniature catwalks and tiny blackgang crew, and the impression of coal-stoked operation.  Costumes and accessories, even the meals served, were faithfully replicated.  Actors were chosen who actually resemble the historical figures in the supporting cast.  The special effects involved in the sinking, utilizing a full scale model, are spectacular.  Likewise the remarkable authentic footage taken from the real Russian research ship and minisubs. By brilliantly framing the past story in the present, Cameron shares with his audience his own wondrous experience of visiting the Titanic in her North Atlantic grave.  His personal infatuation with the ill-fated ship shows in other subtle detail.  For example, Jack's exultant cry ""We're the luckiest guys in the world!"" is an ironic echo of the real-life lamentation of the crewmen who spent too much time in the pub and missed the boat, ""We must be the unluckiest blokes in the world!""  And that much-parodied ""king of the world"" pose (also tagged the ""Rose Pose"") is intentionally the personification of a monument commissioned by the wealthy Society widows who survived the disaster.  This sculpture of a sleek woman, torso arched and arms outstretched, still honors the husbands who gallantly remained behind while their wives took to the lifeboats.  No such sculpture commemorated the Steerage passengers, many of whom were confined below while the ship foundered.  But Cameron pays them tribute by giving human faces to that faceless mass of humanity.  A porcelain doll discovered in the strewn wreckage on the ocean floor was reproduced for the film and is seen in the arms of a third-class child who presumably drowned.  Particularly poignant is the sight of a doomed mother in a life vest, desperately holding her infant above the freezing water.  Yes, Jack's fictional sacrifice tugs shamelessly at the heartstrings, but real people died in the disaster.  Many behaved heroically, others demonstrated dispicable cowardice.  So the fictional characters may be cliche'ed, but they are a pretty fair composite of the historical reality.  For its grand scope and spare-no-expense attention to detail, Titanic deserves its multiple awards.

The fact that I could also relate to the story of the fictional couple only made the movie doubly as good, or in this case, dobly as sad.  This is an epic movie which people will enjoy for decades to come, just like Gone with the Wind.",978393600,2,873,4.136094674556213
132896,5,0792151712,"I think all the people bashing this movie are simply reacting to all the hype. Yes, hype can be a bad thing for a movie. It can raise expectations to ridiculous levels. Fact is, this is the greatest movie ever made. It can't be denied. If it wasn't, it wouldn't have made over 2 billion dollars world wide. Nobody can argue that the hype made the movie that much money. That is BS. Other movies were hyped much more, and didn't make anywhere near that much. In fact, most ""successful"" movies gross around 200 million, this grossed 10 times that amount! People around the world were captivated by it. People in Europe and in Japan waited hours in line to see it! A bad movie, even an average movie, does not make this happen! Everyone who hates Titanic and gives it 1 star simply is doing so because they don't want to be ""jumping the bandwagon"". Well let me tell you, I am NOT the type of person who goes with the crowd. Many successful movies like ""Independence Day"" and ""Forrest Gump"" I thought were crap. I went into Titanic expecting to see something ""decent"". I left the theater quite literally sweating in my clothes, amazed that a movie, ANY movie, could make me feel the way Titanic did.  I was quite literally disturbed for weeks. Nevermind the acting and the dialogue and the SFX. James Cameron has done something incredible. He has gone far BEYOND the conventions of story-telling to create a piece of art, a universal expression of human nature. It has nothing to do with the ship, or the love story, or the history. Titanic is about life and death itself and all its complexity. Notice how as the ship is sinking, how some people react with dignity and courage, some helping people get into the boats, sacrificing themselves, while others cheat and lie and push to save their own hides. Notice how the people cling to the priest reading the Bible as if he could save them. Notice how death comes to everybody in a big, black, silent ocean. It's awfully creepy and terrifying. And yet, through the story of love, people survive. And in death, Rose finds that the afterlife is a reflection of ""this life"". Titanic is a much deeper and complex tale then most viewers realize. Those who don't get it need to see it again and really THINK about it. Of course the music and the cinematography really serve to drive this home. Why did people round the world flock to see Titanic? Because Titanic is a microcosm, a ""little Earth"" expressing all our fears, hopes, dreams, reasserting what Shakespeare long argued in his sonnets, that LOVE CONQUERS DEATH.",978048000,6,2558,4.597374179431072
132897,4,0792151712,"Well, this is a great movie. Adding romance to this sinking catastrophe sure adds life to this movie. ""You see people...""said Rose. YES! You really see people in this movie. The rich, the poor, kind hearted, the cruel, etc... While some of them didn't deserve their destiny, some nasty guys sure did. You need to see this movie to find out yourself.
Now for the ratings on this DVD production. The picture quality earns 4 stars while the sound effect steals away 5. But these are not my main concerns when rating DVDs. Seriously, when DVD's selling price hits across the $20 bench mark, I expects the DVD to complement to the movie itself. If there were ""the makings"" or some extras bundled, it would surely deserve the asking price. Without all those, this DVD should be selling for less.",978048000,2,789,4.642857142857143

When Jack Dawson (DiCaprio) is first told the ship has struck an iceberg, all he can say is, 'Hey, that's not good....' Jack and Rose speak like two mall rats of the 1990s, and their oil and water chemistry was not convincing. Jack, for one, is so chipper that he needs to be doused with cold water -- and is.  Most of the other characters are stereotypes, with the only heartfelt performance turned in by Gloria Stuart as the elderly Rose.  In short, Jack and Rose's romance just didn't seem authentic. My expectations sank before the ship did.",977443200,,718,4.6015625
132909,5,0792151712,"I saw this movie during its original 1997 release and I vowed never to see it again- not because it was a bad movie, but because it was the most incredibly moving film I had ever seen.  I couldn't bring myself to cry at the theater for fear that I wouldn't stop.  So, I went home and cried for two hours- after the late show.
I found this film riveting, not just for the story itself, but for the brutally honest imagery James Cameron used to depict the tragedy and torture of death and dying.  Granted, most of it was special effects- AMAZING special effects!- but I couldn't say that the trauma of the sinking could have stayed with me had they spent less money and used a cheaper outlet of film making.  In the end, I wasn't thinking about the money, the commercialization, or the pretty face of Leonardo...I was aching inside for the 1500 needless deaths, cast out to freeze in the icy water of the Atlantic.
One last thing.  About a year after I saw this film, I attended the Titanic Exhibit in Minneapolis, and my eye happened to catch something on open display in what appeared to be a large sand box.  I walked over to it and there was a sign on the front which said, ""Please Touch.""  So, I reached out and put my hand on the large, spatula shaped object, rusted from years of decay.  It was then that I realized I was touching a boat davit recovered from the wreckage of the Titanic, and, in unison with this realization, a man came over to the display and put his hand on the davit next to mine.  Then, he looked at me, and in a very small voice, said, ""May God have been with them.""

132910,5,0792151712,"How could anyone take one of the greatest tragedies the world has ever known, superimpose a fictional love story over it, and turn it into a movie?  VERY WELL, that's how.
The ship portrayed in the film is incredibly realistic... the viewer can really believe these sets were the ones that have been resting at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean for so long.  It was quite a feat for the Hollywood set designers to create something that so convincingly portrays the interior compartments of the most luxurious ocean liner in history.
Many would complain that a fictional romance was featured so strongly in a movie based on actual historical events.  I have no such complaints.
The purpose of the love story between Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack Dawson (Leonardo Di Caprio) was to give the viewer a human perspective... To make the viewer FEEL how tragic the Titanic disaster really was.  Director James Cameron was wildly successful in this area.  I saw it in a theater (the first time) and many people around me seemed to be crying... I suppose everyone knew the ship was going to sink before we entered the theater, but weren't prepared to see the human aspect of the tragedy... the fictional love story.  Wonderful writing!
Here is a story for everyone.  It is fairly accurate, historically, so it appeals to the history buffs.  It's also a romantic love story, and a tear jerker.  A tragedy.. and it even has its share of action scenes.  And, all of it is done respectfully to those very real people who lost their lives on board the R.M.S. Titanic.  It is a wonderful tribute.",977097600,,1579,4.684782608695652
132911,2,0792151712,"A tragedy as monumental and as riveting as the sinking of RMS Titanic could have stood very well on its own without being buried in a cloying soap opera.  I thought I was watching ""The Perils of Jack and Rose.""  This movie is an embarrassment -- to me for watching it (I couldn't watch it all the way through), to the director, to the actors and to the unfortunate real-life passengers, who are sunk all over again.  What's next, Mr. Cameron:  ""Leo and Kate in the San Francisco Earthquake?""  ""Leo and Kate in the Great Chicago Fire?""
So much of this film is downright laughable:  the blue plastic diamond; the charcoal nudie drawing that somehow survived 84 years underwater; the steamed-up car windows and the heavy breathing; the wildly-swinging axe that miraculously severed Leo's handcuffs; the silent-movie-quality acting and dialogue.
There were so many compelling true stories in the actual sinking that it was entirely unnecessary to concoct a fictional one.
The worst thing is that the real-life passengers we see here were so greatly diminished.  Benjamin Guggenheim (""We are prepared to go down like gentlemen"") was portrayed as a drunk.  The Unsinkable Molly Brown was told to ""shut that hole in your face,"" and we don't see why it is that she is considered a heroine today.  Everyone in the cast looked like puppets, like stock characters.  Kate Winslet had only one facial expression throughout the whole movie (and her clown-white makeup didn't help).

I think perhaps, some people who do not enjoy this movie don't let it in entirely.  You have to let your imagination go and realize what it must have been like to leave the people you loved behind and know full well that you may never see them again.

And I used to call Cameron (The King of the World) one of my favorite directors!  Director of Aliens (the second of the series, and arguably, the best out of the series), the classic epic-The Abyss (absolutely beautiful, and excellently written and played), and both Terminator and Terminator 2 -- I expected much more depth, magic, and REALISM from Titanic.  All it turned out to be was a shallow and cheezy romance that Cameron held above all the characters that were NONfictional.  How does that do history justice?  If you're going to make a movie based on a true story, you should NOT throw in a fictional romance and ignore all of the real stories that should have been respectfully represented.

I don't think that the scenes follwed history well either. Lets just say it should have been rated R. It wasn't up to all the hype either. Leonardo DiCaprio definitely wasn't the right actor for the role either. He was mainly just there to attract to under 20 girls. I would rather have a good movie with a good cast and have a lower gross than to know the movie wasn't that great with these characters but know it made $600 million. Definitely didn't deserve an Academy Award. Maybe for effects. Send this movie back to the ocean. the best thing about it was Celine Dion's song...which got on a lot of nerves after a while too.

The F/X are good, but not on the level of Independence Day or Twister.  Some things that happened to the Titanic herself before she sank (including a severe coal fire and nearly colliding with a ship before she even left Belfast harbor) were left out entirely, and would have made for some nifty special effects sequences.

Leonardo Dicaprio(Jack) was a not so rich man that fell in  love with a rich beautiful girl named Rose(Kate Winslet).

133014,5,0792151712,"At over $1.8 Billion worldwide (excluding rentals), ""Titanic"" is the most commercially successful film of all time.  That is double the next highest  grossing film (Star Wars: The Phantom Menace).  Nominated for 14 Academy  Awards, it won 11 including best picture in 1998.  Everything about this  film was big.  It ran over 3 hours and had a budget of $200 million which  is larger than the U.S. box office for all but 30 movies in the history of  filmmaking.  This was a TITANIC film in every sense of the word.  But, was  it any good?  Well, actually it was!
The film was written and directed by  James Cameron, who before this was most renowned for writing and directing  ""Terminator"" films.  The story was a combination love story, period piece  and disaster movie.  As a love story was good.  As a period piece, it was  wonderfully precise in its myriad details, both generally and as to  specifics about the Titanic and her passengers.  As an epic disaster movie,  it was utterly colossal.
From a directorial perspective, this film is  unparalleled; a feat of gargantuan proportions.  In addition to the normal  directorial duties, Cameron had to coordinate mammoth model-building  projects, deep sea filming of the original ship, thousands of hours of  painstaking research, elaborate visual effects, and hundreds of special  sets.  To be able to pull all those elements together at all is a  superhuman task.  The result was truly remarkable entertainment.
Cameron  took a chance on Leonardo DiCaprio.  The studios wanted Matthew McConaughey  but Cameron insisted on DiCaprio.  It was a gamble that paid off.  DiCaprio  gave a career performance and his enthusiasm and charm lit up the screen.  Kate Winslet was also a fresh talent with only five minor films to her  credit before `Titanic'.  Her performance was sparkling and her chemistry  with DiCaprio made the love story urgent and magical.  Oddly, she hasn't  worked much since, and is fast slipping back into the obscurity from whence  she came.
This was not as much a film as it was a fluctuation in the  space-time continuum.  Forces and emotions from the original event were  transported to 1997, and they clutched us with a power that left us  spellbound.  It was neither the best story ever told, nor the best film  ever made, but it was certainly the greatest filmmaking achievement to date  in its sheer size and scope.  As a motion picture, I rated it a 9/10.  As  an epic, there is no scale large enough to rate it.  The box office speaks  for itself.",967680000,9,2526,4.8254716981132075

Well as for my problem with this  movie, is that it focused on the two non-exisentent characters of Rose  (played by the redhaired ... herself) and Jack, and their two-day  lustful romp (no not love, lust).  We're talking about a shipping disaster  where thousands of people lost their lives, whole families were torn apart,  and James Cameron focuses on two sexed up ""teens.""  The dialogue  was inane and pointless, the plot totally non-existant. Most of the  characters are so poorly developed and so stereotypical that they are not  merely one-dimensional but non-dimensional.  Cal Hockley comes to mind; his  character is so trite, all he's missing is a pencil thin moustache to rub  between his thumb and index finger while going ""mwa-hahahaha,""  like some villain from a morality play.
The length of the film was also  annoying.  By the time the ship actually sinks I was saying ""Can't  Jack just go ahead and die.""

I think  this movie really captures was a horrible tragedy the Titanic really was.  Of course, this movie is not for everyone.  There aren't gruesome deaths or  anything along those lines.  There are few to none *very* comedic lines.  This is just your basic drama but it's taken to the next level.  It was a  great movie, check it out if you haven't already.",967593600,,948,4.401162790697675

How can  people say that Jack and Rose were in love. They had a fling. It only  appeared to be love because they were willing to sacrifice their lives for  each other. Romeo and Juliet!!!

133098,5,0792151712,"Walter Lord titled his book about the Titanic sinking ""A Night To Remember"" and this film is one that will ALWAYS be remembered, for it  is perfect, absolutely perfect. The costumes are wonderful, the acting is  wonderful, the special effects are wonderful, and the props, which were  exact replicas of the items which were found on the real Titanic, are  wonderful. The maiden voyage of the doomed Titanic is the setting for the  touching love story about Rose DeWitt Bukator, an unhappily engaged society  girl (Winslet) and Jack Dawson, a poor as a church mouse artistically  gifted drifter (DiCaprio).  It is a story that will touch your heart,  inspire you, move you to tears, and make you ponder over one thought in  particular - the thought that perhaps there was a real life Jack and Rose  aboard the real Titanic.  Perhaps romance blossomed between 2 passengers  during the 4 days prior to the sinking of the vessel, a romance that was  destined never to come to fruitition.  It's a sad thought, isn't it?  And  it is wonderful to see that in such a cynical age, a glorious and beautiful  movie such as this can emerge from the cash for trash rota of Hollywood,  depicting the sinking itself and the loss of so many lives in such a  sensitive, non exploitive way.  For that is really what the story of  Titanic is about - the death of over 1500 passengers and crew, but through  the many books and movies which have documented this tragedy so well for  the past 88 years, they, and the ship itself, have achieved the status of  immortality and will never and should never be forgotten.",966297600,,1594,4.627240143369176
133099,5,0792151712,"I anxiously awaited this movie's opening in the theaters because since I was in high school I have had a great interest in the horrible tragedy that  took place in the North Atlantic in April 1912.  Being very familiar with  the true story, I was afraid that when this movie came out I would be  seeing a 1997 version of the Poseidon Adventure.  I couldn't have been more  wrong.  First of all, I would like to thank the makers of this film for  going to the actual wreck of the Titanic and filming scenes of areas within  the wreck that hadn't been seen before.  The scenes early in the movie of  this great ship lying on the bottom of the ocean were heart wrenching.  Gloria Stuart was just beautiful as a survivor of the wreck who returned 85  years later to take care of some unfinished business.  The romance, which I  believe was included to basically hold the story together, was pretty much  according to formula and predictable, but you still grow to care about  these people and what happens to them.  But it is more important to  remember this--Jack and Rose were fictional characters who may or may not  have had experiences like those portrayed in the movie.  There were more  than 1500 real people who died when the Titanic sank.  This is especially  poignant in the scene in the movie where we look across the ocean and see  all of the dead, frozen in the icy cold water.  Only one lifeboat went back  to try to help anyone.  And they were too late.  The ending, when Rose  drops the necklace into the ocean, sending it back to the Titanic is a nice  finish.  And I think the treasure hunters/grave robbers in this movie have  learned something in the end.  Maybe more people will learn some day.  Lets  hope.",966124800,,1724,4.448387096774193
133100,4,0792151712,"Some critics have been complaining about James Cameron's script, and every complaint I've read or heard seems to miss the point.  What movie-goers did  NOT see/hear is the entire script: a polished, literate and thoroughly  professional piece of writing.  This includes stage directions, scene and  character descriptions, etc.  I think this is why so many who participated  in the making of the movie vigorously defended the script.  They'd read  what the audience never heard.  What viewers DID hear, unhappily, was  dialog that was often inane, anachronistic and unreal.  The distinction I  want to draw is between a great script as a whole and mediocre dialog.  Cameron showed poor taste in some of his choices of literary devices in  speech: a mild joke to relieve tension, for example, came across as a  preposterous line that wrecked the mood entirely.  As for the anachronisms,  I'm willing to overlook words and expressions of the 1990s put into a story  set in 1912.  If authentic dialog sounds fake to the audience,  communication is lost.  And this point brings me to the one thing that  really set me off:  Cameron's dropping ""the"" before the name of  the ship.  ""On Titanic's main deck ...""  ""We're sailing on  Titanic.""  No one, absolutely no one, ever talked this way, in 1912 or  any other time.  Dropping ""the"" before a ship's name is an  artificial convention invented in the 1930s by the famed historian Samuel  Eliot Morison.  He liked it, apparently.  His name carried great weight  (with justice) and he dictated that the phony usage should be adopted.  Some historians followed his lead, but fortunately the the practice seems  to be fading from history currently being written.  Not, however, from  James Cameron's script....  My only real question is this: How could  Cameron have researched the Titanic and her period so thoroughly and missed  the fact that the splendid liner was ""the Titanic"" to everyone  who ever mentioned her name at that time? ...  But he turned out one hell  of an entertaining movie.",966038400,,2035,4.958083832335329

133104,1,0792151712,"Well, Well, Well, where do I begin.  Lets start with James Cameron.  I admired the guy until now.  What can I say, he did some great work, TRUE LIES, THE TERMINATOR SERIES, THE ABYSS, not bad films at all.  But there is little good to be said about his latest pile of trash, ""TITANIC"".  (what an original title by the way).  Its not exactly the most original  concept either, I mean come on, they've been making movies about her for  eighty years!  Most of which are several times better than this...  Leonardo DeCraprio was brought into the picture simply for teen chic  appeal...not a very professional descision on Cameron's part.  I felt  absolutely no simpethy when Leo bit the big one...infact, I was even a bit  releived.  What upsets me most about this picture is the fact that Cameron  simply ignores the many other types of people who lost their lives in the  disaster...sure, a few snid bits here and there, but unfortunetly, he fails  to go in depth...and do you know why?  Because if he doesn't show you how  horrific it was, he might even con you into seeing this film again as a  repeat audience; anyone who has seen this film more than once should be  dragged out into the street and...the makers of this film seem even  colder than the waters Titanic sailed in herself.  Not one screening was  issued for charity, unlike EPISODE ONE, which would remain the number one  box office hit, had they not engaged in doing so.  The most convincing  character was BILLY ZANE, although I liked him much better as a punk in  BACK TO THE FUTURE.  Kate Winslet's bra size is larger than her I.Q., and  is the only reason she was picked for this role, I'm sure.  Notice how I  refer to the characters as the actors who played them; this is only to  prove how unconvincing they were, and that i never once believed they were  the characters they played.  Titanic should not have garnered the  impressive amount of academy awards that it did.  Best picture, film  editing, director, and screenplay should have gone directly to AS GOOD AS  IT GETS, and I'm not just saying that because I happen to be an Opsessive  compulsive.  It clearly was the better picture.  It may not of had the  impressive sets or production design, but it had something TITANIC could  never have, the ability to convince an audience.  What I'm trying to say is  simple.  Why it appealed to so many  people is simply astounishing, and just go's to show you how shallow are  society really is.  I've had bowl movements more meaningful than this  movie!  Come on, folks!  Anyone mature enough nows this movie is a pile of  trash.  Titanic got it right on two accounts; one, hiring James Horner  (THE MASK OF ZORRO) to compose the score; (even though the award still  should of gone to JOHN WILLIAMS for his score to THE LOST WORLD) and for  the production design.  The only thing convincing in TITANIC was the boat  itself!  I especially love the fact that the entire plot of the movie  revolves around two teenagers jumping and running thru the ship just to  make out...simply astounishing...now that is oscar material!

This  was all very cliche, but nothing too terrible.  Then the narrative stopped.  It didn't just shift to some other action, it just stopped in the middle  of the movie so that the boat could sink.  The scenes while the boat sank  were wonderful and touching (the bit with the band was beatiful) but they  had nothing to do with the rest of the movie.  90% of the scenes in the 1  hour period in which the boat was sinking had absolutely nothing to do with  the plot.  They could have easily been put together before the studio got  the script in the mail.  The makers of this movie just couldn't decide  whether they wanted to make a movie about a sinking boat ( which they would  have done well at) or about a poor little rich girl (which they also would  have done well at) but in the agony of indecision, they worte a love story  in the middle of which a boat happened to sink. it was disastrous.",963878400,5,1187,4.3136363636363635

The fist is the bold exploration into the  world of the past.  Along with a great love story we see the history of a  wonderful ship. The people on board with but one dream, America. One scene  I really enjoy is when jack wins the poker match and screems ""We're  going to America"".
The second is the script.  I have never heard  dialogue between two characters so beautiful. One dialogue that always  stuck out in my mind is when rose declares ""You have a gift Jack you  see people."" and Jack romanitcally replys ""I see you."" what  a wonderful peice of dialogue.

133110,5,0792151712,"What has been said about this glorious film that has not been remarked already? Probably nothing. However, in the last year or so, I have noticed a sharp and ignorant dissension toward TITANIC that is not one bit appropriate. Ever since James Cameron became an overnight sensation after  shouting he was ""the king of the world"" during the Oscar telecast  of March 1998, many seemed to falter from the Titanic band wagon, losing  touch with the magic that enraptured the film when it was first released.  I, for one, have not forgotten and am still amazed by what Cameron has left  us with: an amazing voyage into our hearts and souls.  During the  production of Titanic, the media had a field day in bashing Cameron for  grabbing up hordes of Paramount's and 20th Century Fox's money to create  his epic based on the luxury liner. On many occasions, it seemed as though  he would never follow through. Lest we forget, Spielberg has many of the  same woes while filming Jaws, only he was not enhanced by computer imaging  like Cameron was. However, once the Canadian-born director completed the  project with flying colors and the money started to roll in, he was  laughing all the way to the bank. In my humble opinion, I believe he has  every right to feel like a king, especially after so many of his fellow  media groupies harped that he would never climb out of debt. Cameron was  able to swim to the surface, and is still valiantly kicking up a storm.
  I had never really appreciated the talent of Cameron's direction until I  went to see Titanic in January of '98. I even admit I was late to take in  what the world had already embraced, but once I joined this huge  international swarm of moviegoers, I was blown away. Since then, I went to  see Titanic twice more in the theatres (a meagre amount compared to some  avid viewers) and purchased it on video the day it was released. Unlike  many of Cameron's earlier ventures, including Aliens, The Terminator I and  II, and True Lies, Titanic finds a deeper human quality in its story that  is not obscured by visual effects. It took me by surprise that Cameron  would bother to take the time to broaden the romance of the story, extend  the characters and how they related to each other, and sympathize with  their causes. There is no one person who viewed the picture who could not  relate to or feel for someone on that ship. Even if the romance was not as  appealing to some, the tragedy of the unfortunate lower-class individuals  left to die on the sunken vessel could not fail to touch even the worst  curmudgeon. When I continue to watch Titanic, I always cry for two reasons:  for Jack and Rose, and also for the many who drowned or froze to death in  the aftermath. Only a film like Schindler's List could pack such a wallop,  but Titanic is able to match such an emotional intensity.
 Some have  stated that the beginning and ending portions of the films, namely the two  bookends with Brock Lovett searching for the long-lost ""Heart of the  Ocean"" and the older Rose telling her tale, are unnecessarily added to  the epic. I believe the story would not have come off as well if the  history of Titanic was not put into perspective. Rose Calvert (Gloria  Stuart) adds structure and experience to the story, where her survival is  proof of one's heart continuing to go on. Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) is  evidence that others like him are starstruck by the majesty of the Titanic  legend, and that we often forget what actually did occur on board. The  events leading up to the sinking are more greatly felt and understood when  told by someone who was in fact there and whose life was changed because of  it.
 Roger Ebert, in his review on the film, made an interesting point  that it is perfectly fine to 'Hollywoodize' this story because the Titanic  itself was also advertised during its time with glamour and hype. Why is it  a sin to commercialize such a film if, in reality, this is exactly how it  was presented to the world in the first place? I know quite a few of my  fellow movie critics refuse to rave films like this because they are filled  with nothing but sap. When we shut our hearts off to these movies, we  become too analytical and rigid. I guarantee that if we watch films, even  Titanic, with an open mind and an open heart, we will receive a much more  wholesome experience. I'm not talking about being sentimental or idealized  here, but if you watch movies with the soul purpose of remaining unmoved  and sustained, you came for all the wrong reasons.
 Why is the story of  Jack and Rose different in cinema history? I think it especially works for  audiences because it takes on a spiritual quality that few romances dare to  traverse. Their love is not scarred by lust or complete immaturity. They  are each fascinated by each other, unable to go on without the other, and  willing to sacrifice their lives for each other. If this is sap, then let  my cup runneth over.
 You not only have a great romantic couple, you  also have a great cluster of villains. I think Billy Zane was gipped for an  Oscar in his role of Calvin Hockley. He is pure elitist trash, but also has  to think twice before letting Rose go. He has slight traces of sympathy,  but his desire for money and position mar his heart.
 Titanic is  entertainment on a grand visual and emotional scale, a film which we have  not seen the likes of in almost thirty years...END",962496000,4,5432,4.52734778121775
133111,3,0792151712,"When Titanic was released, it became one of the largest grossing movies of  all time. The reason? No, it wasn't great acting- nor was it good plot or  accurate historical portrayal. In the end, this movie succeeded for two  major reasons: great computer graphics, and hype.
I'm not trying to bash  this movie, nor am I saying that it is completely without its merits. All I  am saying is that it is definitely NOT one of the best movies of all time.  It was an alright movie, that deserved some credit. I mean, a lot of effort  was put into it, and it did have its moments. The portrayal of the ship  itself, along with its infamous sinking was great. However, this movie just  doesn't live up to its publicity.
I believe that when James Cameron set  out to make this movie he wanted to create a film of epic proportions. He,  at least partially, did achieve this goal. However, it did not become an  epic because of phenomonal moviemaking, original plot, or great acting. It  became an epic because of the wonderfully contrived plot, together with the  infamous Titanic story and some famous actors. I mean, come on- boy from a  poor background meets high society girl who is dissatisfied- romance  ensues, despite previous engagements, and later comes to a tragic end.  We've seen this kind of story before- yet we accept it as great. This  appears to be one of the best historical examples of people ""jumping  on the bandwagon"".
The movie also had many flaws- much of the  historical information is innacurate, and the character's decisions are  often not believable. And, for the record: there is absolutely no chemistry  between Leonardo and Kate- they look like what they really are; actors. The  entire plot is much too predictable, and doesn't convey much sense of  realism.

The technical aspects of this film were GREAT!  Watching the ship sink, the people go flipping off into  space...chilling.

Leonardo DiCaprio  was a good fit for this movie, but Winslett's talents were wasted, and I'm  relieved to see that she has forsaken the big bucks for unique and  interesting movies (like Jude, Holy Smoke, Hideous Kinky--excellent movies,  all).
This movie presents shallow stereotype after stereotype, offering  DiCaprio as the noble, Poor-But-Proud Youth (an artist, of course), Billy  Zane as the Evil Rich Guy who is engaged to Winslett, the Naive Ingenue.  Gack! You've seen this story many times before, and much better than it is  presented here. Most people with any sense of fairness will detest the  stereotyping of The Rich in this movie...it is nothing short of bigotry,  but, alas, culturally acceptable bigotry.
The sad thing is, all the  actors, really, are good actors...clearly, they wanted to be in a James  Cameron blockbuster, because, unless they had a coma-like lapse of taste,  the script certainly couldn't have been what attracted them to this  project.

133159,4,0792151712,"If nothing else, Titanic is an excellent example of James Cameron filmmaking in action. In ""The Abyss"", he films much of the action in a giant underwater tank (almost drowning one of his actors). In  ""Terminator II"", he blows up a whole perfectly good office  building. And in ""Titanic"", he creates a multi-million-dollar  replica of the ship...only to sink it.
What's not to love about this  style of filmmaking? Absolutely nothing...as long as the resulting film is  as good as ""Titanic"".
This film has a great story to tell, and  tells it spectacularly, with a suprisingly human center. It would have been  easy for Cameron to just focus on the sinking of the ship (and blow up  things real good), but instead his focus is on how the ship's sinking  impacts the people on board.
And the sinking itself is harrowing,  spectacular and beautifully done, as it should be with a $200 million  budget.

133160,2,0792151712,"Two studios's spent 200 million bucks for this? Overrated, and at 3 hours,overlong,a blockbuster mainly because Leonardo Di Caprio was a teenybopper heart throb and the adolescent girls paid to see it over and over,many of them numerous times. Hollywood's first version in 1953 starring Clifton Webb and  Barbara  Stanwyck in glorious black&white was simpler and a not nearly as long  and in this man's  humble opinion,a much better movie. Even better was  1958's ""A Night To Remember"",an excellent British docu-drama. I have both  these films in my video library,and would not want James Cameron's 1997  version.

  Seeing it once on the big screen was enough. Cameron's  screenplay was sappy and trite and there were many mediocre computer  generated special effects. Kate Winslet and Kathy Bates were two of the few highlights. Ms. Winslet was nominated for the ""Oscar"" for Best Actress,unfortunately Helen Hunt won. I think Ms. Winslet is a much better actress. Di Caprio wasn't even nominated. The final scenes were indeed memorable and at times impressive.(By the way,the experts say a human can  only survive about 5 minutes before succumming to hypothermia,unlike the  way Cameron has it depicted.)James Cameron,one of Hollywood's top egomaniacs,should know less is more.",960940800,5,1279,5.33

This movie is a love story, first and  foremost, and on that level it excels. It doesn't ultimatley succeed  (simply because of some either poorly written or poorly delivered  dialogue), but the characters are people that you care about. I think that  all of us identify on one level or another with Jack and Rose. All of us  want to find that special someone that was meant for only us. As Jack and  Rose develop their relationship we can identify with them, and we become  involved in their relationship and eventually begin to care for them as  people. That is what makes the sinking of the ship so intense and  emotionally dramatic. Sure, this is a  manipulation  on James Cameron's  part, but who cares? It is hits us on an emotional level that you cannot  deny.
Visually the movie is stunning. The effects are seamless and add to  the story without taking away from it.
One can argue if it really  deserved all the Oscars it received, (the technical ones were certainly  deserved), but it really is a stunning movie. The acting has been widely  critisized(especially that of Billy Zane) but I would point the finger at  the writing as being subpar. Billy Zane did the best he could with a truly  one dimensional character.
If there is one thing wrong with this movie  it is the writing. If it wasn't so filled with cliches, this movie would  truly be timeless. As it is, it is still an incredible movie. I thouroughly  enjoyed it, and continue to enjoy it each time that I view it.",960854400,2,1654,4.47986577181208

133223,4,0792151712,"I wish the Oscars had a category for ""Best Ship"". Then, Titanic could have justifiably cleaned up on all the technical awards and the ""Best Ship"" award. But barring the existence of such a category,  it justifiably netted Best Picture.
I was first drawn to see  ""Titanic"" for two reasons. First and foremost, I have been a  Titanic nut since childhood and was thrilled by what I had heard about this  film. Second, I saw one of the teasers in which Billy Zane was chasing  Leonardo De Caprio and Kate Winslet through a water filled room on this  sinking ship and shooting at them. The premise of being chased and running  for one's life on board one of the greatest maritime disasters of all times  struck me as highly original.
The story was a bit shallow and in some  cases poorly executed. For example, when Kate Winslet described the Titanic  as a sort of gilded cage, I simply did not believe her. Even if she hated  her oppressive marital engagement, I doubt she would have had such a view  of the ship.
Despite the mediocre plot, the actors did perform well. Leo  and Kate were charming, and Billy Zane--a very underrated actor--was  marvelous. The most impressive performance, however, was that of the ship.  The reproduction and special effects were simply astounding. Usually I  don't give a damn about such things, but in this case I was truly  impressed. Days later, I poured over Titanic books and photos and could  identify specific photos based on how precisely the film had reproduced  them. The ship was also splendid in her live performance before the cameras  of the Russian submersible. She was a haunting and beautiful sight in her  watery grave.
Although I dismissed the plot as being rather meaningless,  I was surprised to find that many people in Mainland China loved it. I went  to China in 1998 and was frequently asked about two things: Bill Clinton,  and ""Titanic"". When I told one woman that the plot had not  impressed me that much, she replied that I had to understand how incredible  it was to an audience in mainland China that two lovers could defy their  social class in order to be together. I guess the post-structuarlist  theorists are right: no matter what a creator's intention, individuals  reinterpret (and essentially recreate) a work of art from their own unique  perspectives.",958608000,2,2322,4.761306532663316

The characters in Titanic are way too stereotypical and the people  portrayed have too much of a 2 dimensional as compared to 3 dimensional  feel about them. I will use Rose, Cal, and Jack as examples. Rose serves as  a kind of simplistic bridge between the rich and poor. She seems all too  ready to drop the rich lifestyle with not much more foundation for that  behavior than a bit of pre-wedding jitters. She is extremely ego-centric.  Cal is not evil enough. He is in the worlds of the zany Dr. Evil from  Austin Powers, quasi Evil. Sure he is only interested in showering Rose  with material possessions and has a distaste for those who don't make their  own luck. I stress there are worser fates than that. Jack is a very  unrealisticly optimistic guy who is no more than a drifting artist with no  home and no future. Rose is attracted to the fact that Jack offers her an  undetermined future as well as a chance for a way out of her family  responsibility. By marrying Cal her family stays rich and her mother  doesn't have to work-yet another ego-centric character is Rose's mother.  This movie seems to promote that looking out for numero uno is the correct  way to approach life even if it costs you a great deal of money. That is  just implausibly unrealistic. Sometimes that just gets you into more of a  hassle than you tried to avoid. It's almost welcome when the boat sinks and  foils the plans of Jack and Rose. The real untold story of this Hollywood  Titanic is how Rose survived on her own after the ships sinking. I'm sure  that would be a real box office smash as well. Titanic is such a promising  movie with an awfully poorly written plot. This is an exploitation of the  true victims of the sinking of the Titanic.",957830400,2,1956,4.46045197740113
133292,2,0792151712,"I shall resist the temptation to let my strong emotions (hatred) influence what I say and review this film objectively, showing how I came to a two star review.
I will not rank on the framing of this tale, which could  have been interesting.  It sets up a modern day crew that is after the  glory and fortune associated with being able to excavate Titanic, a sunken  luxury liner.  An old woman says she was on the ship (is disbelieved) and  eventually adds humanity to this tragedy of long ago.  These characters are  interesting.  They have needs and goals and, eventually, change.  But how  this happens gets buried in an unoriginal plot and over-done cinematic  spectacle.
After two and half hours of love story and tragedy, Bill  Paxton, the head of the excavation team, says meekly ""...all these  years I thought about Titanic and I never let it get to me.""  Paxton's  character is supposed to be our 'in' - he is modern man.  When he says  that, the audience should feel a similar since that this old tale has  stirred their emotion.  Yet, that doesn't happen.  Why?
The  stroyline of the back-story (most of the film) is dreadful with very little  character drive.  Jack and Rose are flawless youngsters who stand in  defiance of old world fogies.  Convenient, huh.  Their convictions of early  on are only enforced by the circumstances around them - never challenged.  Is this drama?  A disaster flick, if is not purely commercial and for the  sake of spectacle, can only do one thing - show the stuff the characters  are made of in the face of doom: in this film, this is no different than  what they are in the beginning (brash youths).  Do they grow up?  Did Rose  ever?  Does she realize that more often than not they would grow to hate  each other, realizing how shallow they are?
Now, all of you Titanic  fans will say, ""Surely you must admit this film is a technical marvel  of moviemaking and visually captivating""  Again, I raise my fist in  defiance and issue a bold: NO!  Titanic's computer animated effects look  exactly like what they are - computer animated.  Early on, in overhead  shots, little simulated humans move about the digital luxury liner and I  sat frozen in my seat, thinking: are they kidding me?  All the while I was  expecting the camera to zoom out and see that this is all recreation on a  screen that the excavation team was watching.  How disappointed I was that  this never happened.  Pay close attention to these details in your next  viewing of Cameron's unfortunate blockbuster: the cartoon dolphins in the  water, the long shots of the sinking ship (more importantly the never  changing computerized horizon in the background) and most disgusting was  the iceberg itself (which suspiciously resembles the computerized berg  that's shown earlier).  The computer generated imagery was a huge hack  job.
In conclusion, a period piece often features lavish costumes and  music and makeup and more often than not it is in an effort to create a  distinct time and place - one that matches the way the characters feel and  think and act.  Two recent movies that succeed in recreating there time and  place are the severely wronged L.A. Confidential and Elizabeth.  The  actions and thoughts of the characters and background were so in step with  there period and location that you actually become a brief tenant of 1950's  Hollywood and Elizabethan England.  But something is amiss in Titanic - the  costuming and music and makeup may be nice but it's all for naught - the  motion picture around it is deliberately forgetful to the time and place.  The characters are simply disembodied voices moving about some timeless  netheregion with occasional stupid barbs such as Hartley saying nothing  will come of Picasso when he had already made a splash on the Paris art  scene at that time.  This is a bad story people... very bad.  The only  reason I give it two stars is because the massiveness of the production of  this meaningless corporate product has contributed to the surrounding  economy.",957398400,18,4036,4.758369723435226
133323,5,0792151712,"Right at the start of this intriguing movie, we see a robot probe going through the innards of the actual Titanic, lying deep in the ocean off Canada's Grand Banks.

But the diamonds and other jewels they are hoping to lay their hands  on are not there, and they have to be contented with a drawing and other  knick-knacks, instead.
That drawing turns into an old lady who, as if  slowly awakening from a long night's dreaming, begins to recall the events  leading up to its creation by a young artist. And that leads to the movie  ""Titanic."" It's very artfully done and the only question we might still  have, near the end, as that old lady returns those much sought after  diamonds to the depths where they were supposed to have lain for so long,  is: what are we searching for? What is down there, in that icy immovable  hulk? James Cameron has asked the question. Maybe it's the film's real  strength.

133324,3,0792151712,"The brilliance of the subtext of the mise-en-scene that can only be described as ""Cameronian"" contains magical attempts at recreating the atmospheric retro-diegetic which naturally creates an impending  dialogue between the film and Welles' ""The Magnificent Ambersons""  for obvious reasons that are too miniscule to discuss here.  The delicate  inbalance between tension in form and looseness in style can best be  described as octavian in its mirror-like function as both the signifier and  the signified, representing a subtext that relies on not only a working  knowledge of frame of reference in terms of the working axis of  familiarization in visual poetics but also along the same lines as a  chrystalis from unison of sound and substance (as defined in terms of moral  vs. mere action), which is best seen in the scene when the girl gets naked  in front of leo. i must be weary of course because the logical compulsion  is to label the film in terms of a kind of kafkaesque melodramatic  pseudocomedic tendencies of either a Kubrick or a Wenders, but the real  truth is that Titanic, despite its obvious references to depth of focal  objectification in the Bazanian sense of the phrase with its constant  attempts at redefining what the frame of reference should be for the  moviegoer (an effect that can only be called perhaps neo-confucian  bolshevism in terms of its political and philosophical subtext), should be  called a film about the consideration of the very word ""pathos""  in the context of post-modernistic visual collage.  The temporal symbiosis  of both young and old best represents the duality within Cameron's work in  general (think of the dual terminators, or perhaps the duality between the  regular and the mutated pirahnas in Pirahna part 2: THE SPAWNING).  thus,  Titanic must be seen in this context.  otherwise, don't even bother to  watch it because you won't understand it at all.",956966400,3,1915,5.070739549839228

At the time of its release, and even to this day, it was the most expensive, biggest grossing movie of all time.  On top of that, it tied the record for  most academy award wins.  Now this should guarantee that EVERYBODY should  have been blown away by it.  And I must admit that I enjoyed the normally  barf-worthy romance of the story, even though there were some idiotic  scenes (the spitting? ).  Of course, the romance isn't REALLY what the  movie is about.  It was just meant to develop a classically tragic  storyline, just showing how impactful the event really was.  Without the  first half, the second half could not have worked, because without it, the  audience wouldn't care about a sinking boat.

This  was a love story to end ALL love stories,for the many of you who think that  it is childish love, first class women had a 9/10 chance of surviving, and  Rose gave that up to be with the one she loved. And, the most touching part  of the whole movie was at the end right before he dies, when he says  ""Winning that ticket rose, was the best thing that ever happened to  me, it brought me to you and I'm thankful for that rose, i'm thankful""  you would not feel that kind of love adn passion if it were just childish  ""puppy love.""

Hollywood decided to do something different  with the Titanic in the 90's.

Tony said it was impossible to get even into  contact with her.  Jack managed more then that.

Imagine steerage on a boat in 1912, an era when card playing on Sunday was frowned on in a liner and men and women were  housed apart, consisting of ""free spirits"" from an end of the  century frat house!  Picture every rich person a snob or a prop!  Imagine  two leads, one over ripe for the part, the other unable to deliver a line,  stumbling through a plot straight from high school theater.  If you imagine  all of this, then this is the movie for you.
This is a water logged  hellish little movie.  If people in 1912 had been as loutish as portrayed  in this film, men like Bob Dole would not have fought to allow people to  make such tripe.  If people in 1912 had been as silly as portrayed in this  film, then more first class men would have been saved.  The movie lies  about events with such abandon that one quickly loses count.  The sets are  realistic, the people are drawn straight from Days of Our Lives.  The most  dramatic sea disaster of all time is framed by an absurd ""love""  story.  It is fortunate that Jack dies, since in real life such quickie ill  conceived relationships end when the middle age Rose wakes up next to her  balding, over weight spouse in a flat in the Village and wonders where his  impulsive libido led him this week.  This movie is worse than a waste of  time, it is a cultural wasteland.  So starved is our romance deprived  culture for beauty, that even this wicked little confection seemed like the  real thing.

Like many people, I have seen the theatrical trailers and read about the disaster and had my opinions of how good (or bad) this movie would be  before I actually saw it.
Leonardo gives a very spirited performance as  Jack. He was in my opinion, the ""soul"" of the movie. He made it  fun, exciting, and uplifting.
Kate Winslet was also very good. I thought  her best performances were in the beginning of the movie when she was  fighting against herself, but she was very good in the rest as well.
What  really surprised me about this movie was the performance of the supporting  cast. They were very polished. Rose's Mom, the portly looking woman, Rose's  fiancee and sidekick (Killjoy?), all played their roles awesome. They  didn't just play roles to fill up dialog and time, when they spoke, or did  something, it was for a purpose.
The only qualms I have with this movie  is that there was too much infatuation with technology. There was too much  reliance on computer generated images which lead to some artifial looking  scenes. In my opinion, there's no excuse for even one scene to look  artificial. Great movies were made before computers, it's not that hard to  make a great scene without computers.
Scenes that I found  incredulous:
In the beginning of the movie after Titanic had just taken  off Jack and friends are roaming around the top deck exploring the ship.  There are a few people walking along the top deck with them. Now, I've been  on one cruise ship in my life. There were several hundred people on board.  The Titanic in it's day was the most hyped, and the biggest ship in  existence, and if I may add: was on it's maiden voyage. Some of the most  richest and most powerful people in society were on her. Don't you think  the top deck would be crowded with people? After all, there were 2,200+  people on board. You could practically count the number of people on deck  on your hands. I thought this was a major oversight. There should have been  an image of deck that was almost totally filled with people to give the  true impression of the vast number of people who were sailing. I'd be  willing to wager that in real life, it probably was filled up with people.
Please bear in mind that I'm being nitpicky. The scene(s) that I am  complaining about is only depicted 2 or 3 times, but it was enough to stand  out in my mind.
Lastly, I thought, as a DVD, this movie was a  disappointment. Most DVD's nowadays (especially recent ones) contain a ton  of additional material such as actor bios, production notes, ""The  Making Of..."" and even little trivia games. The only additional  material they added was the Theatrical Trailer which I never watch. But the  movie itself is definitely worth watching.",951696000,,2792,4.582995951417004

Also, although Cameron took some liberties for dramatic effect, the film is pretty accurate from a historical standpoint.  However, I thought the rest  of the movie wasn't that great, and I didn't think any of the characters  were particularly likeable.  Yes, Leo's character is amusing at times, but  I found his whole prepubescent look a little at odds with my perception of  a romantic male lead.

I would have had more  respect for the character if she had the guts to break it off with her  intended instead of being with Leo.  So, I think the movie is worth watching - there are  some heart-tugging moments during the sinking and wow, are the sounds and  visuals impressive! - but it just isn't that great.  It's hard for me to  get emotionally involved in a love story when I don't like the characters  falling in love.  Yes, Kate's character finally gets some gumption towards  the end, but frankly, I liked Rose a lot better as an elderly woman.  So  Jack and Rose, like the rest of this movie, are nice to look at, but they  don't move me.  If you've been living in a cave for the last couple years  and haven't seen this movie, it's decent entertainment.

This is for all you people who don't like the movie. (I don't see how)If  you are wondering why the sinking was so long-that was very accurate! It  took almost three hours to sink-that's why most of the movie is  sinking.(duh.)

133518,4,0792151712,"There are two ways to look at Titanic- as an ""event"" movie (which it was) or as a typical run-of-the-mill movie that just happened to make about a billion dollars.
Like it or not ""Titanic"" was a  brilliant movie visually, and it had a story about risk and making your own  way in the world which people could actually relate to. How many Bruce  Willis films have that? James Horner deserves kudos for an outstanding  musical score as well.
Fine . . . but is there anyone who deserves their  success less than ego-maniac Director James Cameron? Also, I have some big  quarrels with the acting- Kate Winslett and Gloria Stuart were both  deserving of their Oscar nominations. But Leonardo DiCaprio's performance  as Jack Dawson left something to be desired. Leo actually *is* a very  talented actor (""This Boy's Life"", ""What's Eating Gilbert  Grape""), so I don't find the pop mania around his persona distasteful  . . . but he just didn't feel right at all here. As for Billy Zane's  performance as Cal . . . . Yeeshk. Villians are at their most interesting  when they are complex characters all to themselves. Zane's smirk made Cal  seem like a bad guy from a Saturday morning cartoon. Rose's choice between  a safe life with Cal and a risky one with Jack is no choice at all- who in  their right mind would choose a dope like Cal?

People who say that are correct but they miss the point of  ""Titanic"". James Cameron intended to bring back the great epic  cinema. He wanted to make a film of such scope, that it would make other  filmmakers say: ""This cannot be done anymore."" In many ways James  Cameron succeeded brilliantly. ""Titanic"" is a film of truly  titanic proportions with striking images worthy of David Lean. Especially  the second half delivers one memorable scene after another. Leonardo  DiCaprio and Kate Winslet do a good job and all the technical aspects of  the film are unbelievably well realized. If Cameron had managed to write an  at least slightly more subtle screenplay without the unnecessary  demonization of the Billy Zane character, the film's impact would be  definitive.
The reason for the hatred of many viewers is maybe its  unparalleled commercial success. Of course it is not the best film ever and  one can argue wether it desreved 11 Academy Awards but ultimately none of  these things should be taken into account when you evaluate a film.

The first time was from a comparative approach to Jean Negulesco's version which I saw at the movies in 1953.  My  summary was that Cameron's Titanic was to a degree far fetched, whereas  Negulesco's version was more realistic because of the time Mr. Negulesco  directed this particular film.  In 1953, it was 41 years after the sinking  of the Titanic occurred, and some of the survivors, their family, relatives  or friends might have been alive, and available to be interviewed for  research that went into the making of this great film.  Cameron might have  directed the 1997 film to accommodate the needs of a present day  audience;  young people seeking to be entertained with lots of adventure, romance,  sex, crass, and the present day god, materialism.
The second time I went  to see Titanic was from an impartial perspective.  Taking into  consideration the story line, special effects, and acting performances of  DiCaprio and Winslet, there were shades of Hollywoodism, and even brighter  shades of Sci-Fi.
By the time that I saw Cameron's film for the third  time, I was able to flesh out that there was something for the young as  well as the old, and something for the past as well as the present.  For  the young, they were able to enjoy Titanic because the history was only  secondary, as adventure, romance, sex and materialism were primary.  For  the older generation like myself, oh yes, I could fully cherish the special  effects.  At the opening scene of the ocean, it had the same impact as it  did when I saw the 1953 movie, fear, trembling, and a tremendous respect  for the ocean.  I feel as though I can identify with the Titanic, having  sailed on the Cunard ships,the M.V.Georgic, and the RMS Queen Mary. Oh yes,  I was a young girl when I sailed on the Queen Mary, and I so recall with  fondness and love the romance that I had with one of the officers on the  return to New York on the Queen Mary.  Take it from one who has been there,  there is nothing more romantic than having romance on board a ship, there  is you, that other special person and that powerful ocean. I feel somewhat  connected to the Titanic also, because I knew two survivors myself.  One  was my great uncle, a successful businessman who tried to get on board the  Titanic only to be turned away at the gangplank in Southampton, and the  other person, a neighbor of mine who might have sailed on the Titanic if  the girl he loved had turned down his marriage proposal in London only two  weeks earlier.  These late gentleman were survivors of the Titanic, not  direct, but indirect, but survivors.  There was one survivor, Mary Glynn  from the same village my mother came from in Ireland, and the other lady  did not survive, Irene Corbett, an acquaintance of my late father's family.  Both those names can be found on the list of passengers.
The end scene  was extremely well handled.  It was powerful.  For the old lady Rose, the  end scene  might have been a dream or reality, but an allegory that the  most valuable gem was meaningless next to everlasting feelings. And then we  see the old lady Rose sleeping happily and peacefully dreaming of the young  Rose being joined by those from the Titanic who had gone before her, and  Jack in a beaufitul and joyful reunion.  That scene was very special for  the older generation because there was something in for all of us, and  especially as we are more accepting of the inevitable, which Mr. Cameron's  handling of it made us all believe that it can be happy.
In summation, I  preferred Negulesco's Titanic than Cameron's, but, yes, the present version  of Titanic was worthwhile, and oh yes, I would see it again and again.",945043200,8,3858,4.619259259259259

Cameron's screenplay is utter cornball, but Kate Winslet, the cinematography and the sweeping beauty of the score all pull  you in. Using a simple love story as a framing device pays off in spades,  because it makes the entire awesome tragedy real and urgent -- we are on  that doomed ship and it is sinking NOW.  The finale is one of the most  perfectly sentimental endings ever made.  It transports you into a  melancholy euphoria.  I think the widescreen version, on a big TV, is best  -- the standard version cuts off too much of the screen.  The fact that  this is essentially a ghost story is never ignored, even punctuated  throughout, which increases the doom and terror.  It really is a worthy  competitor to GONE WITH THE WIND as a spectacular canvas of history,  populated with winning, if somewhat cardboard characters.

I know a lot of people diss the romance  as ""corny"", but if you can't enjoy the romance in Titanic, then I  feel sorry for you; you are way too cynical.

133644,5,0792151712,"This is one of the few movies that was so hyped up and so run into the ground that actually lived up to the hype--even though it's only natural to be sick of hearing about it.
This was definitely a classic.  Set  against one of the most terrible and most documented disasters in recent  history (which was probably the biggest thing it had going for it), this  film took the viewer on an emotional cruise of their own.  The setting  alone put so much power into this movie that is was ahead of the game  before the title appeared on screen.
Wonderfully scored, wonderfully  acted--with the best performance, by the way, coming from Zane and not  either of the Oscar nomianted actresses--this film has as much power as the  title vessel did in its day as compared to the rest of the fleet.  The 197  minutes float by as the viewer becomes acquainted and attached to each of  the characters.
I was a little disappointed that with such an  incredible movie, the DVD that it produced was so uncreatively simple.  Yes, it's long, and I'm sure that takes up alot of disc space, but after  the time and care and detail that went into the picture?  Seems like a  cop-out.  No special features really except the overplayed trailer that  revealed too many crucial plot moments anyway.
Don't get me wrong,  having just this movie alone in your personal library is a must, but that's  all you'll be getting--nothing more.
But as far as the film goes, there  aren't many films that are more powerful.
One thing to note, though.  The most important character in this film--if this even needs to be  stated--is the ship.  This love story, this drama, these characters--none  of it is even close to as memorable without the HMS Titanic herself.

I mean, maybe a  little, but the nudity, the sex scene, come on!  This is supposed to be  about the Titanic, not about teenagers.  They should have been a little  more realistic about the puppy love. Two teenage kids, not over 17 or 18,  having sex.  If you want a great movie that is truthful that leaves out  fiction to try to make it better, get Schindler's List.  It has to do with  real tragedy and horror.  Don't get me wrong, the Titanic was a big  tragedy, but the love scene and nudity and language could have been taken  out, and it would have been so much better.

At the films heart though, it is a dramatic piece,  and judging by the standard by which you judge them, it isn't great.

133680,5,0792151712,"The Venerable James Cameron's epic tale of love in the direst of circumstances proves one essential thing: great moviemaking is not lost in American Cinema. Winslet, the prodigy stirred by Emma Thompson's consummate  tutelage, is more breathtaking than the revelry of Cameron's fascination  with the enormous SFX. Many have derided the film as not  ""realistic"", but fail to mention the film was a love story  against the backdrop of a tragic antiquity. In fact, shades of epicurean  brilliance lance the film throughout--with Winslet as the centerpiece.  Kate's nude scene was perhaps the most artistically driven, rather than  purient, in cinematic history. Backed by James Horner's mystical (Irish  here and so was the operatic music he composed and the delectable Celine  fable) music create an emporium of tooled majesty and passionate desires  while capturing the very heart of love: Innocence. 11 Academy Awards should  prove Cameron is supreme to most and a $1.5 billion box office proves class  is immeasurable even in Hollywood. Of course, Cameron did violate some  Victorian prominences by being too ""modern"". I really could have  done without the SFX at the beginning since the torrent of emotion between  DiCaprio and Winslet was as masterful as it gets. Otherwise, the film,  without their love, would have been another ""waterworld"" with a  $230 million pricetag. Billy Zane, always in his vicious element, was also  consummate. My hat is tipped, much like Winslet's, to Cameron for having  the austere courage to forego his salary to finish a film that will be  loved or hated...but admired, publicy and privately by all that saw it. The  love scene, again shades of magic, was just Amore. If I was Cameron, I  would try to cull some long forgotten novel from antiquity and try  diligently to follow-up this masterpiece. ...with Horner as Maestro, a  Celine performance, and an effulgent love story that would bring more Art  to an Industry in desprate need of it.

The  movies keeps you wanting more.  As far as the DVD goes the video is  amazing, for a non-anamorphic transfer of the film anyway. The film is  presented in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio and as I stated above the  movie has never looked better. As far as the sound on the DVD, the Dobly  Digital 5.1 Surround soundtrack truly rocks the house, and when the Titanic  sinks you will feel like your house is sinking along with it. It is truly a  soundtrack that has to be hear to be believed.  As far as the Special  Features go there is only the original theatrical trailer, which is in  widescreen and very entertaining, along with some very nice animated menus.  It should be noted that Paramount has started work on the big Special  Edition of TITANIC for DVD, and that version should be out either sometime  next year or in 2001.

I figure Cameron uses these things as devices to bring modern audiences into a story they normaly wouldn't be too concerned with (we all knew how it ended before we even went in to see it). Truthfully, the  broader these characters are drawn the easier it is to relate to them, to  slip into their shoes and experience the real story. The real story being  the sinking of the ship. How many people can't relate to the story: Men  know what it's like to long for the unatainable woman, women know the  desire to leave a stiffleing relationship, and everyone knows the rush of  new love (I'll go out on a limb and theorize that the latter, more so then  just Leonardo DiCaprio is what attracted such a strong young female  audience). You've got action, spectacle, drama, tragedy, romance,  historical resonance. Just considering how well his screenplay keeps the  viewer involved is an impressive accomplishment. Just a look at the number  of positive reviews submitted from other countries gives an idea of how  universal this story is. For some to suggest that the fact this movie made  so much money is a sign of how low our standards have slipt is egotistical  at best. For some to state that it is a standard Hollywood movie is just  plain wrong, Hollywood hasn't made a big budget period peice in thirty  years, nevermind a three hour long one where nothing realy happens 'til the  middle. Yes it was a tearjerker, but a tearjerker in the midst of an actual  tragedy.

James Cameron cast aside the fascinating,  true story of the Titanic, to tell a fictional tale about a young woman in  love with a freespirited bohemian artist (oh brother).  He doesn't try to  evoke the time period.  The main character doesn't act like a woman of that  time period, and nearly all the supporting characters seem unlike real people  of any time period.  Winslet and Stuart are dreadful, charmless and the script  defeats all the other performers with the exception of two of my old favorites,  David Warner and Bernard Fox.  James Horner, who did the marvelous score for  Braveheart, offers negligible help, and the huge budget can't make the sinking  as exciting as it was in the infinitely superior A Night To Remember.

Look  behind those lovers and see the sometimes nasty division of the working  class and bourgeosie, those slaving in the  steam engines, those partying  below the decks, and the upper crust discussing their property in the East  Coast.  I don't want to overrate the movie, but Titanic is really one of  the slyest pieces of class commentary I've ever seen.

 Then, notice  how the camera swoons over these two people, capturing those feelings as  one might imagine being two teens on the grandest boat of all must feel  like.  Sure, the love story itself is standard stock stuff.  But, let me  ask you -- were the so-called Hollywood classics any more original?  The  trick with those movies and with this one is that a Hollywood love story is  about the swoon, the pageantry of emotions, the romance of circumstances,  and all that other good stuff.  With such a powerful subject as the  Titanic, Cameron trumps it up in a fashion befitting the golden age of  Hollywood.

 Which sets up the tragic climax, and Cameron never  flinches at depicting the moments of horror and dignity that must have  been.  By deftly switching between personal and vast scenes of people  facing death, we are constantly in touch of the scope of this tragedy.  You  couldn't do this without setting up a convincing love story, and that's  what Cameron did for 2 hours.

 Is it the greatest love story of all  time?  Of course not.  But, it's easily one of the best large-scale  Hollywood romances of all time, which if you realize by now isn't about  love at all, but the circumstances around it.",937353600,,2050,4.693181818181818

Especially Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio who kept the story (pardon the pun) afloat during this 3 hour epic. I usually  become bored with long romance movies, but this had me rivetted throughout.  3 hours? Seemed like 45 minutes. It passed so quickly! James Cameron you  are a genius! You deserve every penny that falls into your pocket for  having the balls to defy the Hollywood moguls' penny pinching and make  ""Titanic"" how YOU wanted it to be made. My only criticism with  the DVD is that there is no behind-the-scenes footage, doco or deleted  scenes....and we know there are many that hit the cutting room floor.

Forget about the hype, forget about Leonardo Di Caprio  (he is good, but he is not, as a lot of yahoo Hollywood goers want to  believe, who carries the film) and for those of you who unfortunately saw  Cameron yell "" I am king of the world"" like a showoff at the  Academy Awards, try to forget that, too. Yes, what took place historically  with the Titanic was tragic, and who wants to make light of that? But what  better way to bring you to that time in history than a love story so  brilliantly carried by Kate Winslet, one of the better more true actresses  of our time and such incredible direction from many talented people. Even  my father, who HATES epic long films, was shocked at how much he enjoyed  watching it at least once. And I recently heard spooky author Stephen King  cried...so it can reach some favorite film until this once came along, but  I have to admit, if Kate had not been Rose, it would not have been near as  good. Tragic? Yes. But so was a film like ""Braveheart"" which I  found to be violence for violence sake. This movie being so popular sends a  message to Hollywood; more romance, more history, good actors.

Why did people sit through 3 1/2 hours of oh my gosh suspense (just kidding) while  waiting for that moment when the boat splits apart and slowly starts to  sink?  Maybe they thought the boat wouldn't sink if they just watched it  enough times.  Although I have to agree it was those silly teeny bopper  girls lusting after that leo guy.  (His last good movie was The Quick and  The Dead, and guess what he dies in that one too) Maybe it's just me,  although I hope sincerely that others feel the same way, but shouldn't  tragedies be viewed as such and not profitted from?  I wouldn't have so  many complaints about this movie if it had focused on more than just the  budding romance of a young couple.  Only when the boat sinks is the  audience really aware that the boat isn't just full of rich people, only  when people start to die does the camera zoom in on their tortured faces.  But sadly, as they are not built up as real characters in the preceding 2  hours before the boat starts to go down the audience just doesn't care  about the people falling to their deaths.  (Even the woman with the baby  floating by hardly registered since I was getting impatient and waiting for  the movie to end)  So there you have it, 3 1/2 hrs, minus character  development just doesn't make for entertainment to me.

133781,5,0792151712,"The first mistake that James Cameron made when he set out to make a film of the ""Titanic"" disaster was deciding to write the script himself. He churned out a hideous piece of tripe that no amount of anything  could save--stiff-as-a-board dialogue (lines such as ""I'm just rolling  along like a tumbleweed in the wind"" indicate a startling Bob Dylan  fixation), contrived and unmoving plotting, and a nearly infinite length.  ""Gone With the Wind"" got away with it because it was poetically  written and magnificently acted, especially by Vivien Leigh.  ""Titanic"" is butt-numbingly long. The reason? A wretched script,  and thespians who act as if they're to be shot with the plague at the end  of the film-- they're obviously not very excited about finishing. What  Cameron is not, is a screenwriter, or much good with actors. What he is, is  a brilliant action director, and when the ship begins to collapse  (finally), there are long, thrilling set pieces that will probably be  analyzed in film classes for years to come. Unfortunately, the rest of the  film is tiresome and shockingly stupid--it might be intellectually  stimulating to the 13-year-old girls that made up its core audience, but  not to anyone who likes to have an abstract thought now and then.

133804,4,0792151712,"Yes, ""Titanic"" is just a movie.  Just like any other big-budgeted, over-rated, popular film, ""Titanic"" lacks many of the characteristics of a truly timeless classic.  The sad thing about  ""Titanic"" has nothing to do with the tragedy of the relationship  between Rose & Jack.  For such a grand, beautifully pieced together and  filmed movie, ""Titanic"" lacks a decent script and only goes  surface-deep.  Compared to such excellent films as ""L.A.  Confidential"" and ""Saving Private Ryan,"" once you've seen  ""Titanic,"" you've seen all there is to see.  Great movies offer  something different every time you watch them.  I feel, however, that not  having more than a surface value is ""Titanic's"" only flaw.  James  Cameron paid so much attention to detail in his epic love story, that you  could even see the porthole frames fly off the boat as it broke in two.  The genius that saves the movie is the set design, art direction, James  Horner's astonishing score and Kate Winslet.

Every aspect of this movie is truly amazing: the sets, the costumes, the special effects, the  historical accuracy, but most of all, the acting!  Kate Winlset was  stupendous as Rose and deserved the Oscar for best actress, and Leonardo  DiCaprio did a superb job as Jack Dawson.  The rest of the cast was also  outstanding in more ways than one.  Many people bash the movie by  saying that it is a ""chick-flick"" that focuses only on the love  story of Jack and Rose.  That is completely untrue! The tragic story of  Jack and Rose is a way the audience can understand the true loss and  heartbreak the tragedy caused. James Cameron did a fantastic job recreating  the disaster and telling the stories of the real passengers and crew. I  would recommend this thrilling epic to everybody!

Did they even need  the Titanic to tell this weak romantic story: poor artist boy meets girl,  boy saves girl, boy and girl fall in love, Mother doesn't approve of poor  boy and says: 'Girl, marry rich boy,' girl 'just says no,' boy and girl  have sex, boy sacrifices himself for girl, girl lives a good life with  memory of boy always. And some boat sinks. You might say that such  plot-holes (as so many anti-Titanic sites point out) can be figured into  every movie under the sun. But not every movie under the sun is considered  by a large population to be the Greatest Movie Ever Made. ""A woman's  heart is a great ocean,"" for gods sake?

133855,5,0792151712,"I was amazed that I liked Titanic as much as I did.  Being a Titanic buff long before James Cameron even had the idea of making the movie, I had very low expectations of the movie when I went to see it for the first time.  I  also was extremly disappointed that Cameron was planning on using fictional  characters (i.e. Jack and Rose) in a non fictional setting, fearing that it  would take away from the actual accounts of the sinking.  My fears were  dashed away with the first appearance of the computer generated and  recreated Titanic.  Cameron went to great lengths to have the Titanic  appear as real as possible to the audience and his effort did not go  unnoticed.  When the scene of Titanic's magnificent prow cutting  majestically as it glides across the ocean waves, one feels that the  Titanic is reborn, that she is waiting somewhere to once again ferry  passengers across the Atlantic.  The scene of one of the powerful steam  engines as work in the Titanic sent chills down my spine.  And the  attention to detail in Cameron's neverending effort to replicate the  Titanic above as well below water was tremendous.  The storyline admittedly  was a bit on the weak side, almost too plauged by the ideal romanticism of  poor boy meets rich girl, rich girl falls in love with poor boy, disaster  ends any chances for both of them.  What made the storyline a bit more  plausible, was the tremendous acting of both Kate Winslet and Leonardo  DiCaprio.  Winslet breathes life into Rose DeWitt Bukater, making us  believe that she is the tortured and troublesome soul that she is.  DiCaprio is comfortable as the easygoing, ""tumbleweed in the  wind"" Jack Dawson.  The only flaw in DiCaprio's acting is that often  at times, I felt that Jack was more of a time traveler on board the  Titanic, rather than an exisiting character.  Billy Zane, as Rose's  self-centered, pompous fiancee, did an excellent job in protraying his  character , as did Frances Fisher, as Rose's unrealisitc mother.  Kathy  Bates as Margaret, ""Molly"" Brown provided some comic relief and  both Jonathan Hyde-Pierce and Victor Garber as J. Bruce Isamy and Thomas  Andrews, respectively, showed perfect reinditions of these real life people  who we have often read about and have never met.  The ordeal of the Titanic  sinking are haunting.  The images of the third class people being trapped  by overzealous crew members, the heoric effort of Titanic's band playing  on, the struggle to convince people that the boat is actually sinking, and  the painful process of loading and lowering the lifeboats are images that  are brought to life for those who weren't there when the sinking actually  took place.  The unforgettable scene of dead, frozen people in the ocean  after the mighty ship has gone down is one that stays with you, well after  the movie is over.  Cameron does well at the end of the movie to insure  that the audience will better understand the motivations of Bill Paxton's  modern day pirate character and that of ""Old Rose"" played very  well by Gloria Stuart.  I also enjoyed how Cameron leaves one guessing at  the end of the movie-does Rose pass away in her sleep and meets Jack in  heaven or is she just dreaming?  I think that overall what Titanic offers  for us through Rose and Jack is a way to time travel back through time to  see what life on the Titanic was actually like, being able to catch a  glimpse into the lives of people long ago lost.  James Cameron truly  recreates this lost ship, the ""Ship of Dreams.""",932774400,,3521,4.712396694214876

Not some love  story between two little insignificant people that no one cared about in  the first place.  The only good part was when DiCraprio froze like a  popsicle.

This was an actual event.  1,500 people died in the North  Atlantic in April of 1912.  I sat with girls at the movie who cried when  Jack died, not when frozen bodies were floating in the water.  If you could  sit through this movie more than once, I'm amazed.  I came out of the  theater thinking about all the ones that died, not the stupid love story  involved in the flawed plot.

To have such a visceral rejection of this movie's basic plot is in itself a symptom of your own emotional shortcomings. - And no, I'm not a  teenage girl.

There are even  gaps of justification of the story line.  But a BILLION dollars at the box  office!  And they were ""mostly"" teenage girls?

133986,4,0792151712,"Wow. What a lot of anger against Titanic! I thought I'd add my two pennies worth (such as it is) to the entire broiling pot!!!
Titanic is not the best movie of all time. I do like it though, and I think it is best watched  in the cinema. I think most of us have seen it by now, so this review  serves little more than the opportunity for me to post my opinion amongst  the others.
A lot of criticism went onto the lead actors of this movie.  Okay, Leonardo was hired for his looks, Kate for her 'classic English rose'  (if only you all knew how much that term is abused) and the supporting cast  for their ability to drown well.
It doesn't detract from the entire feel.  It is always tricky filming a work of fiction based on reality, especially  so recent an event. For me, it really brought home what it must have been  like on that ship, how much anguish there must have been. I (macho male  that I am) shed a tear at the final moments; the old couple in bed, the  musicians, the mother tucking her children in with a prayer.
The rest of  the plot tries to add all the common elements from all other films to make  this the business. It does work (though not all the time). I did get a bit  fed up with the Billy Zane thing - how obvious is it she won't touch you?  Typical villain...
Anywho...I'll stop now before I go off on one.  Enjoyable movie, buy it if you love it, borrow it to see it, don't watch if  you're feeling a bit anti Hollywood...",926380800,,1451,4.106761565836299
133987,5,0792151712,"Titanic was the most amazing movie I have ever seen, granted Leonardo Dicaprio's acting could have used a little more.  Kate Winslet was the star that shone the brightest.  I tend to be drawn towards movies based on  actual events.  (Braveheart, Schindler's List) I would change nothing in  this movie.  For those of you criticizing the movie for the fictional love  story between Jack and Rose, that was an ingenious maneuver to draw the  entire world into the story and begin to experience it...not just watch it.  That is what movies are for.  If you wanted nothing but facts, watch the  Titanic stories on the Learning Channel.  I highly recommend this to  everyone young and old and in between.  You will be in another world for  the next 3 hours of your life.  James Cameron did an outstanding job.  He  took the story of Titanic and sunk it right to the bottom of our hearts.",925862400,,882,4.580645161290323
133988,2,0792151712,"I admit I saw this movie because of Leo.  I have enjoyed his work since I first saw him on Growing Pains, though I always thought he'd be better suited for the stage.  He did not disapoint me...he was stellar as usual,  it was an emotional, and believable preformance even if the script fell  short.  However, his co-star Kate Winslet left much to be desired...here is  a tip Kate, try shivering when you are cold.  As far as the script goes, it  was full of holes...the biggest being a mistake of many greater movie  makers than James Cameron.  Rose was telling the story...yet how did she  know about the things that happened when she was not present?  Many of the  characters died before they would have had a chance to explain.  It would  have been more effective/believable if she only told stories about events  she was actually present for.  It's funny how with a 200 million dollar  budget, there were still sound and editing errors through the whole thing.  Perhaps the editors should have come to postproduction class with me before  hand to learn a little about fading the sound before switching to a quiter  scene.  There is no need to make the audience jump out of their seats in a  drama.  Overall, I was disapointed with this film, yet still oddly  entertained.",925776000,,1276,4.614349775784754
133989,5,0792151712,"In part, it is the romance that unfolds in the first half of the film that makes the second half so emotionally moving.  But clearly some of the best moments in the film come not from Jack or Rose, but from others around  them.  Two of them are particularly striking: (1) When an embittered Cal  Hockley realizes that Rose would rather die with Jack than live with him,  Cal grabs his valet's pistol and chases them down the grand staircase,  shooting until the gun is empty [A magnificiently villainous moment]; and  (2) The ""Nearer My God to Thee"" scene, where the string quartet  plays one last song, realizing that they are doomed to die.  Director James  Cameron uses this time to show you how several passengers choose to spend  their last moments, from the elderly couple embracing each other on top of  their bed, to the mother telling her children one last bedtime story, to  the frantic chaos on deck as male passengers scramble to board the last  lifeboat (including both Hockley and Jack's Italian friend Fabrizio, who  scrambles to remove the lifejacket from another DEAD passenger).

The accuracy and detail was great, but the characters and the  story could happen on any ship any writer can create without an iceberg.  It was great when it came out, but after a while it got to be dull and  boring. We were waiting for ""Saving Private Ryan"" and  ""Godzilla"" to come out.",924825600,,595,4.267857142857143

134094,2,0792151712,"Despite incredible special effects, intricate art/set decoration, lush cinematography, gorgeous costumes, and tense commotion scenes (despite the interlude of the lovers's fate) during the sinking of the ship, Titanic  (the movie/boat) sinks, as suggested by the film, as a result of its  pretention.  James Cameron may have done overexhaustive research on the  launching and sinking of the ship, but forgot another important topic:  the  mannerisms and dialogue of people in the early 20th century.  Hawking  loogies, the middle finger, sex in the back seat (an early reference to  cars being initially dubbed as ""brothels on wheels""), along with  various cliched phrases are more associated with the nineties  ""culture"".  A certain song/poem Jack recites was not even written  prior to 1912!  As a result, along with the retrospective viewpoint, the  movie conveys an anachronistic nineties period and is therefore too  immature to deal with such a mature topic.  This accounts for the vast  appeal of the film (especially among teeny-boppers) along with its  top-billed stars, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.
Leo, along with  Ben Affleck, should never act in period films because they are not willing  to ignore their personal upbringing and bring characters with extremely  different lifestyles to life.  As a result, Jack remains flat and  uninspiring, despite the fact that he stands for the good ol' U.S.A. and  consequently liberation/freedom.  He does well in such films as Basketball  Diaries with which he appears to identify with.  Kate Winselt's acting was  rather disappointing despite giving wonderful perfomances in other period  pieces, namely Jude and Sense & Sensibility.  However this should be  attributed to Rose's lack of character despite her wanting to be a  ""rebel""; she is remembered sorely for her wetness, nudity, and  continual wideopen horror stricken glance at anonymous people.  Billy Zane  manages to snivel every line like the villain he attempts to be.  Only  Victor Garber, the Captain, and the extras (the musicians in particular)  display a truer sense of dignity and courage during the sinking of the ship  unlike Jack and Rose who fear above all that their sexual relationsihip  (embodied in the phallic ship) might also sink.
Most noticeable,  however, are the various stereotypes aboard the Titanic, mainly the  romanticizing of the poor versus the unfeeling monstrous upper-class.  Recalling A Fish Called Wanda, Titanic appears to propagate that America  and what it stands for is what one should embrace in order to liberate  oneself from demons and society's demons!
James Horner's soundtrack is a  complete derivative of the theme song (which has illogical lyrics) and  therefore repetitive.
I believe that if more consideration was given to  the script, especially the deletion of the ""male fantasy"" i.e.  Kate Winslet's posing nude for a portrait (thus removing our shameless  voyeurism), and the relationship between English society and people were  further explored and devoid of stereotypes and cliches,  the acting  would/might follow through and might have actually made a very good  movie.
  For all of you who believe that 11 Oscars (recalling Ben Hur!)  is ""nuff said,"" I recommend that you read Danny Peary's book,  Alternate Oscars, where he correctly identifies that the Academy Awards are  very rarely a good indicator of the merit of a film.",921110400,3,3408,5.34280303030303

The dialogue was banal, the love story was implausible, the villian (Cal  Hockley) wasn't very villianous, the old lady was just plain annoying,  Leonardo DiCaprio makes me sick no matter what he plays, and people  obsessed over the movie long afterwards.  GET OVER IT!!  THE SHIP SANK!  I  admit, the special effects during the ssinking were chillingly real, that  doesn't make up for the rest of this monstrocity of a movie.

And then, you turn back and see it again, and instead of thinking it was great, you could  picture it on the next episode of Mystery-Science Theater?
That's how I  felt about this movie. Seriously. I just have to say, I was seriously  hooked into this film and hypnotized by the freakin' Enya-like music that  droned on and on, letting up only when there was an action scene, when the  music was then replaced by pieces of Horner's ALIENS that must have been  left on the cutting room floor of that film. And I must have seriously been  on something when I thought that Kate and Leo were really, really good. It  took Siskel and Ebert's annual movie-trashing right before the Oscars to  wake me up.
Yes, this movie is haunting and yes, for a moment, everyone  DID enjoy that stupid song by Celine Dion. Now, she can proudly hoist that  film up in the air and join the ranks of the other stupid ""diva""  singers like Houston and Streisand who think that they're so great when, in  all reality, they're nothing but over-rated, over-blown lounge acts.
And  I DID pick TITANIC accurately in the Oscars. Not because I liked the film  that much, it's because I knew that it couldn't possibly lose due to the  budget of a small country and the wanna-be epic-like production, reminscent  of Forrest Gump(another piece of overrated junk that gave Tom Hanks the  ultimate complex and somehow convinced himself that he could be a great  serious actor).
All I have to say now is that I am sorry for EVER  thinking this movie was great. It was basically the Wizard hiding behind  the curtain instead. James, all I have to say is suck it up. Open up the  last of your champagne, get drunk, try and call your ex-wife who thankfully  left you(perhaps because she escaped the hypnotism?) and apologize to her  for being such a moron to her.
Why, you ask? Because STAR WARS is coming.  Everyone took their eyes off it because of TITANIC. It ain't happening  again. And all you little young, teenage girls who weep and sigh when Leo  shows his pre-pubescent chest to you can go ahead and tell me that nothing  will ever beat TITANIC. I have news for you, ladies. When people sell-out  theaters for THE WATERBOY and MEET JOE BLACK just to see the new STAR WARS  trailer, I think that means that Lucas is about to repeat history.  Especially when critics and box-office analysts predict that it will make  $200 Million in the first week, I think that means that TITANIC will sink  again.
And all the doubters will sink with them.

134235,1,0792151712,"Titanic is a hideous movie, a splendidly produced and widely acclaimed glorification of the ugliest of twisted sexual politics.
Rose endangers Jack with a kinky and dangerous game, most notably enticing him into her  chambers to sketch her with her fiance's rock around her neck, insisting  that Jack sign it. Then she leaves the sketch with a note in the safe:  ""Just wanted you to see that I was sharing it with Jack""! or  something to that effect.
What sick motivation would cause a woman to  write such a thing and endanger someone in this way? Romantic? Rose is a  corrupt and nasty female.
Once Rose has set up this incredibly dangerous  situtation, she leads Jack through the hold of the boat, knowing that her  fiance's thugs could easily throw him into the drink and noone would ever  be the wiser.
""Touch me, Jack,"" she sighs. Could she endanger  him more?
And when the rock is found in his pocket, she doesn't defend  him, not even for a second: ""Jack, how could you?!"" is all she  says as he is led away.
What a hideous woman! With a friend like Rose,  all Jack needed was for the boat to sink!
Everyone is lauding this film  and praising the romance of it. I am astounded. Rose is the most femme  fatale of all and Jack dies saving the precious, useless wench. Why would  you call any of this Love?
Titanic is an ugly story about a woman with  nasty motivations endangering one of our competent, sweet Wisconsin farm  boys to his deadly peril.
The way I look at this movie, Rose is a  hideous, selfish witch, clear to the end, when she throws away a priceless  gem. How many great-grandchildren does she have who could stand to go to  college? She's a potter, right? And she throws the rock away!? Dah.
What  is romantic about any of this?
This story about the romantic memories of  a sweet little old lady which everyone is talking about is, when I look at  it, one of the most hideously embarassing tales of a woman setting a man up  for her own vindictive jollys without any concern about endangering him  that I have ever seen on film and it is only in the telling of that story  that it has any value at all.",917654400,12,2126,4.3984575835475574

134253,3,0792151712,"If you are looking for a love story that have a pop culture story (like some sort of 90210 Beverly Hills in the old fashion), this is for you.  If you plan to make a gift for a teenager or a Leo's fan, go on.  If you are  looking for an award quality love story for mature audiences, get Madison  Bridge by Clint Eastwood or Casablanca.
In my opinion (and this is  exactly my opinion) Cameron knew how to manipulate people emotions and  despite of the not overwhelming performance of DiCaprio and Winslet it  became a hit.  Watching this movie is like having some sort of catarsis.  I  noticed that those people who have had a heartbreak just liked this movie,  enjoyed and cried much more than other people.
James Horner made a good  soundtrack (I have it).  As George Lucas said once, this is half of the  experience.  Star Wars is also part of the pop culture but it is also  different.  Star Wars made a special contribution in visual aspects and  caused a revolution in the Sci-fi genre.  Titanic is a single movie that  has not contributed in such a way, however it showed me that marketing  people and writers can make hits if they got to manipulate emotions.
When  no emotions are involved (from the beginning of the story to ship  departure) it becomes slow and plain (boring if you have seen this  already).  However, as simple and common emotions start to rise people  start to get involved.  It ressembles some sort of ""Pretty Woman""  or latin ""telenovelas"" which have got good TV ratings in  Latinamerica and China.
I wouldn't call Cameron a genius, but I must  recognize his work (Aliens and Terminator) has a certain level of quality  as well as Michael Bay (The Rock and Armageddon).  If you want a genius,  look for Spielberg best movies or read Franz Kafka.
There is nothing bad  with that movie.  This is not a masterpiece, not a crap, but a hit (like a  pop music hit) that teens are going to keep as a symbol of their young  years (like we did with songs like ""We are the world""or ""It  is now or never"").  Just put it in the right place.  If you like pop  culture movies or you have had a heartbreak or you like someone from the  casting (I like Winslet) you may buy this one.

There is always going to be the handful that have a need to go  against the grain--and it just serves us right to take their opinions with  a grain of salt.
  As movie critic for a major newspaper, I attended  many pre-release film screenings in 1997, most of which seemed to take the  world back to the classics of the early century.  After the screening of  ""Titanic"" I was approached by several colleagues and asked  whether or not I enjoyed this film; my reply was for them to simply pay  attention to the television screen come Oscar night.
  ""Good  Will Hunting"" was great!
  ""L.A. Confidential"" was  beautiful and chilling!
  ""As Good As it Gets"" was  hilariously brilliant!
  ""The Full Monty"" was, eh, good.

134320,1,0792151712,"Although it is easy to see how this brainless saga  could appeal to an equally brainless segment of the public, it is much harder to understand the honors that have been bestowed on this mediocre (albeit expensive)  production. The special effects were pretty good, and the details of  reconstruction of some of the inanimate objects was remarkable. The problem  was in the animate entities.
The main characters are anachronistic:  essentially 90's teenagers dressed in funny turn-of-the-century clothes. If  you are thrilled by the fact that Rose decided to follow her heart instead  of the social conventions of the time, you should consider having your  fiancee/wife/daughter run away with a gang member she only met two days  ago. It is easy to laugh at the social conventions of 90 years ago. A good  film should let us look critically at contemporary costumes.
Some of the  scenes are obviously emotionally charged (e.g. the two lovers looking from  the bow of the ship to the horizon) but one cannot escape the impression  that the number, intensity, and sequencing of these scenes come from some  ""How to make a movie"" manual that you can probably buy for $10.95  on this very site. All in all, I would say that the film reveals a decent  craftsmanship, but not a single shread of art (a situation not uncommon in  Hollywood).
The moral standings of the film are simplistic and  misleading. We don't really need to encourage teenagers to choose their  life partner based on a cute face, a couple of days on a boat, and an  uncomfortable one night stand. Blaming the survivors in the boats for not  rescuing the people in the water is equally simplistic. Having the boat  broken into pieces by a desperate mob would not have done much good to  anybody. Equally difficult for me to understand is the hard stand on the  character of Cal Hockley. I can see how, with a couple of minor corrections  to the script, this could become the heroic fiancee who fights to save his  loved one from the advances of the ruthless social climber. Cal Hockley  could have been a much more complex and interesting character. But I guess  that one of the golden rules of Hollywood movies is that you need a  carboard-cut villain to oppose the equally cardboard-cut good guy.
I saw  this film in a theatre, and I don't feel any need to see it again at home.  I have better things to do with my time.

134335,5,0792151712,"Titanic is the best movie I have ever seen. There are a few drawbacks, however:
Rose spends way too much time running around looking for a key for the handcuffs. Cal Hockley was a total jerk...did he know he was  getting married to Rose's mother for money?? Rose's mother was drawn very  cliche. (""Of course, we're women. Our choices are never easy."")  Molly Brown was too hearty-hearty. Some of the best parts were chopped  before the movie was even released. However...
This movie was the most  emotional movie I have ever seen. It is the best just to look at. The  costumes are fantastic. The hair is great. The visuals are wonderful. The  love story and music make you care about what's going on, draw you in to  the sinking as if you are there.
It's true that Leonardo DiCaprio's  acting isn't quite up to par, but you only notice that if you've seen the  movie more than three times.
This is the best movie of all time. One  might as well buy it, since everyone else has or will.

134347,5,0792151712,"I will admit right from the start that Titanic is not an entirely perfect film; the dialogue, particularly in the first half, is rather crude and the modern day sequences seemingly lack energy (but perhaps for a reason--see  below).
All reservations are thrown to the wind, however, when the viewer  gets wrapped up in the romance of Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate  Winslet) and the majesty and grandeur of the most famous ship in history.  It is a historical epic in the tradition of Gone With the Wind and Doctor  Zhivago (both of which feature similar flaws as well).  Nevertheless, the  film that seems to have been most influential to director James Cameron in  the making of Titanic is The Wizard of Oz: just as Dorothy is transported  from her humdrum existance to the colorful land of Oz, so is the viewer in  Titanic taken from the bleak, monochromatic modern world back to the  vibrant Technicolor of April 1912.
Possibly the finest aspect of Titanic  is the performance of Kate Winslet.  The film is basically about her  transformation from depressed teenager to brave womanhood, and Winslet  emodies the role with beauty and panache.  She runs the gamut, literally  and physically, in Titanic, and emerges with a radiance I've not seen since  Julia Roberts charmed audiences in Pretty Woman.  Winslet should've won the  Oscar, but that's a whole other column.",912470400,,1380,4.917391304347826
134348,3,0792151712,"There's certainly been a lot of hype and a lot of backlash when it comes to this latest rendition of the famous disaster. As you'll see in other reviews, most either loved it or hated it, but felt strongly about it  either way. My feelings are, rather, on the moderate. First, let me say  that I saw this film three times in the cinema, and would have no problem  seeing it there again. This is because the visuals are absolutely  extrordinary. The scope and glory of the cinematography, combined with  Cameron's impeccable sense of visual ""moments"", make this film a  sheer delight for the eyes. In fact, the best moments are just visual: the  transitions from present to past and back, Rose and Jack kissing on the bow  at sunset, Jack drawing Rose (a nude scene overwhelmingly aesthetic, rather  than sexual), harrowing bits in the sinking sequence, dead Jack slowly  descending into the dark of the ocean. In the cinema, though not on video,  this is enough to carry ""Titanic"" over its deficiencies. The same  is not true on video, however. On video, you have either the choice of  ""standard"" format - in which you a good third of the picture - or  ""widescreen"", which gives you the whole movie, only smaller.  While the latter is certainly the way to go, the diminishment of the visual  element brings to focus the drawback of the movie. First, the screenplay  itself is one of Cameron's weakest. It is cliched, melodramatic, and  overreaching, not to say anachronistic (more on that anon). Second,  Leonardo DiCaprio is a terrible actor. Not even talents like Kate Winslet  and Kathy Bates can get him to work with them. He has no concept of  ensemble acting. The excellent supporting cast, in particular Gloria Stuart  and Victor Garber, just don't have enough to do to make up for him. Third,  in trying to make Rose a girl for the ninties, Cameron makes her  unbelievable for her day. She would not have smoked at the table, she would  not have punched strangers, and she certainly would not have had sex with  Jack. (Their relationship would have been better if that scene had been  omitted anyway.) As far as the ""finger"" dispute goes, she should  have used the English equivalent (like our ""V for Victory""  gesture, only with the back of the hand facing the recipient.) In  conclusion, if you haven't seen this in the cinema, rent the widescreen  edition to get the feel. If you have seen it in the cinema, best to be  content with that.",912211200,,2449,4.662763466042154

Titanic is an outstanding movie, bar none.  People are not idiots.  They will not pay their money to see it that many times if it isn't good.  James Cameron mixes a real-life tragedy with a fictional love story that is  very believable.  Yes, I have read what others have said, how they  criticize the acting, and the poor plot.

It  was about people going back to America, some for the first time, and this  over zealous headline chaser that goads the Captain into making mistakes  that cost 1,500 people their lives.  One of the depressing parts, and there  are many, is when the Captain is asked by a lady where her and her baby  should go.  He can do nothing but stare at her.

What  Selznick did in that film when he recorded the events of the Civil War-ah,  that is pure and simply-untouchable, paramount splendor.

134393,5,0792151712,"O.k., there has been quite alot of hubbub about Titanic.  We all know  that.  With it's massive budget, huge scale sets, and costume and prop  budget that could supply all of Chicago for a year, I found it to be the  most detailed and beautifully filmed movie I have ever seen.  Barring the  fact that the story is fiction (hey, who knows?......), the drama and  intensity are mirrored by the technical and digital effects that are just  as beautiful.  How 'bout the shots with the ship in the open ocean? - all  computer generated.  New software had to be written just to accomodate that  effect.  Or how 'bout the shot where the actual ship, 12,500 feet down,  blends smoothly with the recreated set?  James Cameron and his Digital  Domain team have outdone themselves; even surpassing the fabulous effects  in ""True Lies"".  People like Titanic specialist Ken Marschal was  on hand during filming to be sure that accuracy was in top form.  After  seeing the movie twice, those details, in my opinion, are perfect.
There are those who say the movie is 'cheesy' or even 'plastic'.  That's  always a matter of opinion.  Remember that James Cameron wrote the  screenplay himself and took out about 2 hours worth of extra footage in the  final print.  The movie is set to be re-released in December at its full 5  and a half hour running time.  That's where the $200 million budget comes  from.
Anyway, I think the experience of seeing this movie will be even  greater by viewing it in the widescreen format.  Shot in 70mm format, the  only way to view Titanic IS in widescreen.  Pan and Scan (or Standard  Format) will only diminish what James Cameron invisioned when he began  plans in 1996 for a movie about the sinking of the Titanic.  I loved it in  the theatre and I will surely love it on video.  A definite 5 star movie.  END",903744000,,1830,4.576323987538941
134394,5,0792151712,"Myself and my wife saw TITANIC on the big screen and both left feeling as  though we were actually transported back to 1912 and the disaster  itself. The underwater photography is superb and never before did I vere  expect to see the real wreck on screen like that! When the flashbacks came,  the period costume, sets of the ship's interior and the computer-generated  effects could not be faulted. Kate Winslett(and in a wet white dress) gave  the best performance, Leo diCaprio is OK, but Kate's my preference! The  special effects during the sinking sequence are out of this world. James  Cameron has directed many of my favourite movies, i.e. T2(special edition),  The Abyss(special edition) and Aliens(also the director's cut), but this  one ranks as his best by far as it takes him away from the much-plundered  sci-fi genre and into something totally different.  With the possible  exception of DEEP IMPACT, this is the best film of 1998, if not of all  time.  END",903657600,,971,4.871165644171779
134395,3,0792151712,"Normally I would be willing to declare any movie  with Kate Winslet the  greatest movie of all time, simply by virtue of her stunning acting  ability. However, even with Kate aboard, ""Titanic"" still doesn't  deserve, I'm afraid, all its critical and public praise.  Its positive  points: the movie is beautifully filmed, and the special effects are on a  scale of realism and scope I've never seen before. The music is pleasing,  in that epic-sweeping sort of way, and Kate Winslet does her usual  marvelous job of acting.  However, the film has some glaring flaws as  well. Now, ""Titanic"" is an epic, and the idea with these types of  movies is to sit back and become absorbed in the sweep of things, not  thinking too much about the finer points. Nonetheless, there are problems.  At the risk of disappointing legions of preteen and teenage girls  everywhere, I must report that Leonardo Dicaprio is NOT the greatest actor  in the world, and this movie proves it. Billy Zane's role as Rose's evil  fiance is far, far too one-dimensional: all he needed was a diabolical  laugh and a mustache to twirl. James Cameron's ideas about 1912 society are  also laughably black and white (rich people always bad, poor people always  happy and good), and I don't think even he could plausibly explain to me  how, after establishing that the Atlantic Ocean is at near-freezing  temperatures, Rose and Jack can splash around in that water inside the ship  for nearly 20 minutes of screen time without suffering  ill effects.  Only  a short list of flaws, but they ARE there, and ought to be borne in mind  when considering ""Titanic""s plce in cinematic history.  END",903657600,,1654,4.810714285714286
134396,5,0792151712,"I think this movie will stand as the closest virtual way of being there  onboard the doomed Titanic, unless they close the theatre doors and start  filling the theatre with ice water...
The tragedy is that the Academy  Awards people did not give Gloria Stuart an award. How many more times in  her career is she going to get another chance at one? It would have been a  no doubt brilliant way to end a career.
Speaking of her, though now in  her character as the older Rose, WHY does she throw the necklace over the  side? A great loss, not only to her family's future inheritance, but such  an object should be in the Smitsonian or similar where it could be enjoyed  by the public. I thought this one of the weaker parts of the movie. One  other aside, I think Whitney Houston would have been a better choice to do  the soundtrack.
But overall, it was well done, and Mr. Cameron deserves  the accolades he's received. Follow up your viewing with the transcripts of  the Titanic Disaster Hearings - adds the real-life dimension to the  cinematic experience.  END",903484800,,1062,4.515789473684211

7791802,5,0792151712,"Make every day counts is the heart of the movie, just like Roses diamond necklace, the Heart of the Ocean. Titanic is an extraordinary picture of human society, from lifestyles to manners. You will see the classic from first-class passengers in Titanic., such as all the fine dining tables for parties, the silverwares, dresses and suits, etc. You will have the chance to picture how the rich lives and spends money, how they show the world what they want the world to see. And then how the working class parties, how their smiles and dances are. Rose in Titanic was the one who captured it all. She was an indoor girl until she met Jack Dawson, the love of her life. His carefree spirit waked her soul up. Love sparked when their souls find each sympathetically significant other. Rose was also a carefree girl at heart but she was locked up with all the rules from first class society to act for her role to be a part of the rich. She knew she doesnt fit in. But she almost decided to marry her fianc because he was rich enough to save her good name familys debt. She intended to do that just for her mother as she was so used to living the life of a first class person. Then Jack came and shined her heart like the diamond she was wearing that day. He gave her the courage to be herself, to break through, and more than that, he showed us how a man should be. He treated people fairly. He did the best he can for people he loves. He showed us how he respects the woman he loves even when she got naked for him to draw her. This presents his class as a fine man. Rose listened to Jacks persuasion when she decided to go away from the hole of money, shady business, and power for a free life. This means leaving her mother and the rich life behinds, which is not easy. That makes me remember my dance teacher once asked, When you are dancing, you notice that your mans dance doesnt follow the music correctly. What will you follow? The music, or your man? I automatically said the music, however, the correct answer from my dance teacher was the man. I didn't understand the answer at the time until I watched the movie Titanic. Love does show the way!

Rose Dewitt Bukater: When the ship docksIm getting off with you.
Jack Dawson: This is crazy.
Rose Dewitt Bukater: I know. This doesnt make any sense! Thats why I trust it.

Beside the love story, I remember the scene when all the musicians played violins and bass to keep the crowd calm. Music is the medicine in the time of frightening and heart breaking. Wedding pieces were played when first-class passengers boarded to life saving boats. Then Orpheus by Salonisti for chaos from everyone no matter what classes they are. And finally, it was My God to Thee for the ones left behind, the lower class. Money can buy you insurance to back you up in hardships. But if you don't have a lot of money, don't worry. Music will buy you calmness. Love will buy you hope. And hope brings the best out of hardships. Insurance is not the only way.

The final scene was the moment Rose Dewitt Bukater coming back to Titanic to marry Jack Dawson, just like how she claimed him her husband when the officer asked her name to add to the survivals list: Rose Dawson

She changed her last name to his last name: Dawson

What shocked me the most was the statistic: Fifteen hundred people went into the sea[] There were twenty boats floating nearby and only one came back. Six were saved from the water out of fifteen hundred.

This is how the world works, and people like Jack Dawson added one life to the six luckiest people out of the fifteen hundred. He gave hope. Hope brings out the best in hardships.
