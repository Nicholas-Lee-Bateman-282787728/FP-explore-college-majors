This movie is TERRRIBLE don't waste your time or money, just go to water world and surf the wave pool with no plot or problem and you will have a way better time. This movie has no intention on this earth. If you cant fall asleep, then turn on this movie and your problem is solved!",1295740800,,376,4.164383561643835
8248059,1,B000QFAFQI,"Filmed mostly in a waterpark, this low budget turd has a cast of no-name actors trying too hard to create a movie that didn't need to be made.  If this style of move is your bag, you would be better off turning to the disney channel or nick for your thrills.",1199232000,2,258,4.0588235294117645
