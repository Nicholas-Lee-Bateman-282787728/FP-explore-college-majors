The video is a great way to review writing. As a third grade teacher, my students gained meaningful information and skills. They all have their own ""tool box,"" now. I recommend this video.",1360368000,5,203,4.828571428571428
3049822,2,B0010T3HPK,"This video says it is for middle school and high school. When I get it home and watched it, it is clearly not for high school students. This is not age appropriate for my students and I regret this purchase. This is not the sellers fault. The video has the grade levels printed on it. This is more for 5th - 8th grade in my opinion.",1349913600,4,332,4.045454545454546

3049824,5,B0010T3HPK,"My daughter who is about to enter 4th grade was assessed with a learning disability.  I was told that she needs to work on her writing and spelling. Specifically, she needed to work on adding more detail, grammar, and spelling accurately.  Unfortunately, many of the Spelling lists my daughter had to learn were too easy (she's not that far behind her peers) and she wasn't challenged enough to improve her writing and spelling.  I was at the end of my rope when I ordered this video.  In addition to the spelling drills that I've given my daughter on my own I showed her this video.  This video did hold my daughter's attention. Within three weeks she's watched it five times without any prompting from me.  Right after watching the video, she's always motivated to put the skills she's learned from the DVD to use and write!  I can see measurable improvement in her writing samples and sentences.  She now uses more description, more detail, less repetitive phrases, and better grammar.  She's not where she should be yet but an improvement is an improvement and I expect that this DVD will help her tremendously in school.",1343865600,20,1125,4.728205128205128
3049825,3,B0010T3HPK,The video is for 4th grade and up but seems a little low budget to hold their attention.  It has  a girl and a talking pencil who helps her improve her writing.  The strategies are great and is done in a teacher-student conference set up!  We'll see if it holds their attention...,1281398400,2,280,4.326923076923077
3049826,5,B0010T3HPK,"This DVD is divided into two main sections of just over thirty minutes each. The first section covers the basics of story-writing, and although it is geared towards grade four and up, it is useful for anyone with a composition or report to write, or a story to tell.

Presented in cartoon format, the story-writer is a young girl, and her instructor an Italian pencil named Marko.  We follow along as the girl writes a composition about her first camping trip, with Marko providing running advice and commentary.

As she writes, Marko pulls ""tools"" out of his toolbox to make the story better, and these are:

1. Arranger: putting your thoughts in order so as to capture the whole story in a logical and organized manner.  Extraneous material that doesn't belong in the story is also edited out.
2. Hook: every story needs something to catch the reader's attention, and this includes specific actions, word pictures, interesting facts, conversations or questions.
3. Transitions: used to fill gaps in the storyline.
4. Colorful words: words used to emphasize the way things look, feel, smell, taste or sound.
5. Personification: giving human qualities to objects.
6. Dialogue: developing characters by having them speak to each other.
7. Simile: using words to say how different things may be similar.
8. Onomatopoeia: words pronounced like the sound they are describing.
9. Alliteration: words that begin with the same letter.
10.  Lasting impressions: ways to end your story that will be remembered by your readers.

(Marko also discusses unclear pronouns and making sure that clear antecedents are used)

The second section deals with proofreading for capitalization, spelling, punctuation and double negatives, among others.

Also available on the DVD are printable posters covering the topics, and these are also available for downloading from markothepencil dot com in pdf or gif format.

I think that this is a very useful tool for helping children to improve their writing skills, and even my seven year old is now familiar with the terms ""simile"", ""onomatopoeia"" and ""alliteration"".  Get this for a young, aspiring writer in your family, and leave a lasting impression.

8238424,4,B0010T3HPK,"This 40-minute video is a great addition to your education library, though its content is geared primarily toward middle school. Its an animated video in which Marco the Pencil describes to a student (who has been given a writing prompt) how to brainstorm, the importance of knowing audience, and determining the purpose for writing. When the young student shows Marco her work, he improves it by teaching her how to use a variety of tools including: arranging, using a hook, transitional phrases, colorful words, personification, similes, dialogue, onomatopoeia, alliteration, and leaving a lasting impression. There is also a section on the DVD that teaches proofreading. With each new toolbox topic there is a symbol to anchor it to memory. Overall this is a decent intro to writing video for middle school; it is probably too old for elementary (conceptually) and too young for high school students in terms of juvenile (animation).",1512950400,2,936,5.2052980132450335
