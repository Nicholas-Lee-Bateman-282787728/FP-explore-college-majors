5295055,5,B0099XTOAG,"Lovely film about an awesome spot.  Appreciate the information on the many factors that threaten this iconic place, as well as the folks that live along its banks.",1372809600,,163,4.821428571428571
5295056,5,B0099XTOAG,They showed a screening of this for project healing waters here in knoxville and I truly enjoyed the film! I thought it was a great documentary about why we fish as well.,1372809600,,170,4.34375
5295057,5,B0099XTOAG,"If you love camping, fishing, and small-town America, you will love this film. The beauty of the Yellowstone is brilliantly captured, as is the stark reality of how our environment is changing. The folks that the travelers meet along the way stole every scene they were featured in - a fascinating group of everyday Americans (and their dogs!). This is a film I will watch over and over.",1372809600,,387,4.705882352941177
5295058,5,B0099XTOAG,Another one of Hunter Week's great movies.  A great documentary in a great style.  Not the most awesome footage but a good story combined with an interesting topic make for a good show.,1370822400,,185,4.575757575757576
5295059,3,B0099XTOAG,"Inspiring yes, and entertaining, but I was left feeling a bit underwhelmed. Lots of fishing, not much on the challenges of the adventure itself. Enjoyed the social aspects of the trip the most.",1365811200,,193,4.878787878787879
5295060,2,B0099XTOAG,"I am from Montana, along the Yellowstone.  I think I was more than ready to like this film BUT found it lame and disappointing.  I tried turning the sound off because the commentary was so bad.",1355961600,5,193,4.333333333333333
5295061,1,B0099XTOAG,"If you want a lecture on the environment, then you'll like the video.  If you are expecting to watch a fly fishing video or a video with beautiful scenery then this is not one you'll want to spend time on.  The adventurers do fish, but the joy and beauty of fly fishing the Yellowstone is not captured. The cinematography leaves a lot to be desired.  The beauty of the river is not displayed. You never come to know the cast of characters or the river.  This video is not much more than a sequence of days of some people floating some river.  You do not know the people or the river.  I found this DVD a waste of time and money.",1355702400,4,628,4.148760330578512
5295062,5,B0099XTOAG,I like this documentry film. It is also beautiful. Sad to see how much destruction and coruption in the oil industry. One reason I don't want the Keystone Pipeline.,1353456000,3,164,4.689655172413793
5295063,5,B0099XTOAG,"Having lived in Bozeman for a few years myself (still trying to find a way back), this film made me yearn for the open spaces, clear rivers, and big sky country that Montana is.  It was beautifully filmed.  The group is on a journey to shed light in the importance of the Yellowstone within the larger ecosystem and environment.  Definitely a must see for those impacted or even those who simply enjoy the scenery that the Yellowstone creates.",1352764800,3,443,4.653846153846154
5295064,5,B0099XTOAG,"This is a fantastic, inspirational film.  We absolutely loved it.  The people, the relationships, the scenery, the message.  Beautiful.  Don't miss this one!",1349308800,,157,5.695652173913044
5295065,5,B0099XTOAG,"Awesome, I would love to make this trip someday. The interviews with people along the river were fascinating as well. I am also saddened to see the changes occurring there.",1397088000,,172,4.766666666666667
5295066,4,B0099XTOAG,"This film was great! I bought it for inspiration for my upcoming trip to Bozeman and Yellowstone, and want to float the river. Awesome and peaceful visual review of the river, kinds of fish and fishing, river bank geography, and the people and towns and lifestyle along the way downstream to the Missouri.
I have 2 great great uncles that died at the hands of the Sioux in September 1868 on the Yellowstone River 60 miles before the confluence. I wanted to see the area, in general, and won't have a month of time on my visit. This movie provided exactly what I sought, mile by mile, high plateau and evergreen trees to open ground and wide views, in the amazing choice by explorer William Clark to return via the Yellowstone in 1806.
I plan to watch it many times!",1389916800,,765,4.4714285714285715
5295067,5,B0099XTOAG,It was better than we expected! Different from other fishing movies but still very beautiful we enjoyed many of the different people in it.,1380672000,,139,4.833333333333333
5295068,5,B0099XTOAG,"Wonderful to go day by day with the group and their dog, meeting special local people along the way. One gets a sense of history too through mention of the Lewis and Clark expedition in the early 1800's and throug the changes and the Exon oil spill that's still being cleaned up.
I could have used captions, missed some of the dialogue. One becomes fond of each member of the group, Shannon is a beautiful woman.",1375142400,,412,4.434210526315789
5295069,5,B0099XTOAG,"This is another great movie from Hunter Weeks. I absolutely loved his earlier work - 10 MPH and Ride the Divide - and WTYG is another beautiful movie IMO. I really like the way that the movie has a down-to-earth feel, what with all the locals and the dog (you have to love the dog!) and the family aspects. I can't think of a better introduction to the Yellowstone river and to the dangers facing the river. On a side note, the soundtrack is amazing!",1372896000,,450,4.305882352941176
5295070,5,B0099XTOAG,Coming from Australia this movie ignited in me a passion to float and flyfishing on the Yellowstone. it brought me right back to foundation of what life is all about - interfacing with nature. Where the Yellowstone Goes had my wife and I booking a float trip flyfishing in the USA in 2012 and again for 7 weeks in Sept 2013. This time we WILL float the Yellowstone..Watch this movie it WILL change your life.,1372809600,,408,4.453333333333333
5295071,5,B0099XTOAG,"""Where the Yellowstone Goes"" is one of those rare movies that combines awesome scenery with a practical, educational narration.  There is a bit of history, and a lot of pertinent info on what is happening to the Yellowstone today.  The movie is full of wonderful interesting characters and the scenery just can't be beat!",1372809600,,321,4.925925925925926
5295072,5,B0099XTOAG,"Not because I'm related to anyone or anything... but the movie was a good family watch and I enjoyed the scenery and the fishing and the people... but most of all was ""Robert the animal rescuer""  And the fact that Robert built the boat they drifted in... and my daughter liked that Charlie was in the movie at the beginning.

Well worth an hour and a half!",1372809600,,356,4.298507462686567
5295073,5,B0099XTOAG,It's is by far the best documentary I've seen in YEARS! I've watched it on Netflix 6 times mad bought the sound track on iTunes. I recommended numerous people to watch and thy have all loved it!,1372809600,,194,4.27027027027027
5295074,5,B0099XTOAG,"Hunter Weeks (and company) have done it again! I'm a big fan of his work, and have enjoyed watching him develop his career in film making. Beautiful scenery, an amazing journey, and of course inspirational stories and encounters along their journey with real, everyday people, makes for a fascinating movie. I was lucky enough to see it in the theater here in Minneapolis, and now own the movie myself.",1372809600,,402,4.840579710144928
8538227,5,B0099XTOAG,"As a big fan of Hunter Weeks' and Mike Dion's work, I am a bit biased, but this really is a great film to share with your family and friends about the importance and beauty of one of the West's treasures. This movie is what a warm, fuzzy feeling would look like if it was sent on a river. Outstanding.",1458518400,,301,4.033333333333333
8538228,5,B0099XTOAG,A great film on fly fishing and the importance of nature to our lives.  I highly recommend this film.,1454976000,,101,4.315789473684211
8538229,3,B0099XTOAG,It's ok  I was hoping for more white water and less on the fish.,1444176000,,64,3.5714285714285716
8538230,5,B0099XTOAG,This is a great movie and made me want to jump in a raft and float down the Yellowstone.,1433808000,,88,3.6842105263157894
8538231,3,B0099XTOAG,"The fly fisherman (not the filmmaker) who headlines this ""documentary"" seems to have a sincere, if naive, concern about the Yellowstone River and its surrounding ecosystems.  The filmmaker, in my estimation, really doesn't care that much.  The cinematography is reasonably well-done, and there are some interesting snapshots of local 'flavor' along the journey.

It seems that perhaps the intended message regarding environmental preservation may have gotten undermined by some of the ""product placement"" and whatnot that was required for adequate funding.  It does seem that these folks spend a LOT of time fishing with particular fishing rods, wearing a particular brand of sunglasses, etc.  The fairly skewed presentation of the oil-spill cleanup efforts may  be driven by a sponsor's concerns for encouraging positive public perception of alternative energy sources and negative perceptions of fossil fuels.",1428969600,,911,5.711111111111111
8538232,5,B0099XTOAG,"The one River Lewis and Clark explored which is still UNDAMMED and one can float along freely upon.  The ONLY river in the continental U.S. left to do so.  Since the Missouri River is no more (a series of lakes due to irrigation and hydroelectric dams) enjoy this video while the Yellowstone is still freely flowing!  Are we stewards of nature or is urge to dominate and ""profit"" our ugly destiny?",1421280000,,397,4.563380281690141
8538233,5,B0099XTOAG,Great movie  Spectacular scenery,1420588800,,32,7.0
8538234,1,B0099XTOAG,"I went in expecting a beautiful, educational film about Yellowstone and the river. Instead, I was subjected to ""Fishing on the Yellowstone River"", complete with pseduo-philosophical ramblings. Horrible, boring, bad cinematography. Don't waste your time.",1413763200,,253,6.257142857142857
8538235,5,B0099XTOAG,We continue to view the DVD.,1405036800,,28,3.8333333333333335
8538236,2,B0099XTOAG,"I wanted to like this movie.  There is no adventure here...they are floating down the river.  They have no challenges.  And it's pretty but not the best footage of the river.  What is so compelling and inspiring about people floating down a river and fishing?  Talking to some locals and going to local businesses, and discussing the river and environment without any real knowledge - just a generalized, oh-how-great-nature-is refrain? For all their preachiness, they don't really acknowledge that this river system is actually still incredibly healthy, despite the fact that landowners have lots of river-frontage, and ranchers have ""rip-rock"" on the riverfront, etc.  This kind of ""oh gosh development is bad, and we're dependent on oil, and nature is great""  commentary is pointless.  It doesn't really educate people.  They are not environmental heroes - they are themselves using a hundred products on the trip made via petroleum as the energy source, and products with toxic by-products.  We all love nature and wild beauty and having a nice easy float down a river with some fly-fishing and a campfire at night.  But when I take this kind of vacation (because that's what it is) I bring along funnier, more erudite, more interesting companions.  The movie is extremely tame,and in fact, pretty inane.",1404432000,4,1308,5.117924528301887
