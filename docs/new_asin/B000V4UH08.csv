2929240,4,B000V4UH08,"I'm not a zombie fan, really, and I'm not sure what made me rent this film, but I'm glad I did. I suspect the hardcore zombie fans whom this is being marketed towards (including with all the trailers on the DVD) won't necessarily be happy with this film.

Fido is a zombie movie, but it's sort of Night of the Living Dead Invade Pleasantville, a social commentary and satire of post-9/11 life set in a post-World War Z world that resembles the sunny and optimistic 1950s, where any questioning of the compromises made for peace -- or that the security measures in place are more feel-good than actually effective -- leads to ostracism or worse.

Billy Connolly trades his loud and brash manner for a nearly silent role, and the comedian shows that he's actually a pretty subtle actor. Carrie-Anne Moss turns in a very un-Matrix-like softer role and K'Sun Ray, on whose narrow shoulders much of this film rests, carries it with ease.

Take a chance of this particular flesh-eating monster. You'll be glad that you did.",1193875200,14,1017,4.702247191011236
2929241,2,B000V4UH08,"The fifties are a favorite target of the film industry.  Understandably, a time when conformity was king, a comedy that satirizes sterility and a WASPy dominance of others has a laudable satiric message--even if the same saccharine speech is hammered throughout.

2929243,4,B000V4UH08,"I fear the man who gave this item a 1 star probably is pretty grumpy.

I liked this film. It seems to ask some certain questions (are zombies really dead?), and offers a possible insight impact on people who don't want to be undead--by being buried with your head removed.

I found the film perpetually strange. I grew up in the 50's and watched the shows of the times, and the goofy allusions to this time frame are used very well. All the cliche's from the fifties television shows (and ""Lassie"") are highlighted and given a run through.

Odd to think that the ""vast wasteland"" once spoken of, is now considered the role model the Right Wing holds so dear.

One real annoyance: how come Billy Connolly didn't make any commentary?  And why would a master verbal comic decide to do a role where he has no speaking parts (growling doesn't count as dialog)? He does use his face to an amazing  degree, and makes you realize what an actor he could be if only given that one good role.",1193443200,3,981,4.4222222222222225
2929244,1,B000V4UH08,"There's nothing I love more than a zombie (zombi) film. Whether it is the needed social-commentary of a work like Halperin's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Zombie/dp/B000853QN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Zombie</a>&nbsp;(1932), the thought-provoking existentialism of Soavi's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cemetery-Man/dp/B000F3UA8E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cemetery Man</a>&nbsp;(1994), or the playful relateability of Pegg/Wright's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-of-the-Dead/dp/B0006A9FKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun of the Dead</a>&nbsp;(2004), I enjoy it all. In fact, I (like Danny Boyle, mind you) insist that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later)</a>&nbsp;(2002) IS a zombie film, JUST so I can show it in my horror-film classes! Equally as revealing, I (INDEED!) went to every ""Resident Evil"" film on OPENING-NIGHT just to show my support for the undead. Bottomline: I'm not a zombie-snob. So, take my words to heart ... this film is shockingly sub-par.

This work had everything in its favor! Foremost, it has top-notch actors like Carrie-Anne Moss (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B00000K19E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Memento/dp/B00003CXZ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Memento</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chocolat/dp/B00005K3OT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chocolat</a>), Dylan Baker (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Requiem-for-a-Dream/dp/B00005Q4CS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Requiem for a Dream</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-2/dp/B00005JMQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man 2</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kinsey/dp/B0007PALGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kinsey</a>), and Billy Connolly (""Boondock Saints,"" ""White Oleander,"" and countless television shows). Most horror-film directors are not that luckily. And, understand, these actors ""brought their 'A' game."" Their devotion to their roles is painfully clear ... and that only contributes to the uncomfortablenesses of the work (one begins to feel embarrassed for these committed actors). Secondly, Currie had a sizable budget: eight-million! (and has thus far only grossed about $300,000 since June). Pegg and Wright had EXACTLY half that budget for their zed-word ""comedy"" and quadrupled it as of November 2004. In essence, Currie had the gift of gorgeous sets, fantastic film-stock, luxurious props (like the cars!) ... amenities only this type of budget could permit. And for all its ""beauty"" ... for all its effort ... it fails ... epically.

Undoubtedly, its fatal-flaw resides in its soundtrack. The ""light-instrumentals"" (practically lifted from 1950's sitcoms) undermines the film at every turn. It is not ironic ... it is not ""kitchy"" ... it is not creating an ""atmosphere"" ... it nearly, single-handedly destroys the film. Its literalness is exhausting. Moreover, watching the film is like trudging through molasses: it is excruciatingly slow and unrewarding (or, at least, I imagine this is what ""trudging through molasses"" might be like). Envision a rewrite of ""Lassie"" ... now replace Lassie with a ""pet-zombie."" The end. The first nod toward Beaudine Jr.'s work was amusing ... but the joke wears thin FAST! ""Is it Timmy? Is he in trouble? Show me boy!"" Et al. Uggggg.

One point of frustration is Tim Blake Nelson's character of Mr. Theopolis. His contribution was the ONLY redeemable aspect of this entire film. It is a genuine shame that the director failed to focus on Nelson's demented-yet-likable character. To relegate such a respected actor (one beloved by the Coen Brothers) to a ""bit-part"" is a pity. The real film was with him and his zombie girlfriend (think of what could have been!) ... how did no one realize that?!

Many viewers will be dazzled by the ""pretty colors,"" the wonderful sets, and the familiar actors ... most will find it completely transparent. Many will think they are ""supposed to like it"" ... most will realize it is reasonable NOT to like it. There is nothing innovative here ... nothing that hasn't been addressed elsewhere. I assure you, this is not the next zombie-classic ... in fact, I will be shocked if the film is in-print a year from now.

Peter Travers of ""Rolling Stone"" magazine says it best: ""Director Andrew Currie is better at laughs than scares, but he can't sustain either as Fido runs out of steam in the final stretch."" And the other critics (who are remarkably amenable to horror in general) agree (like Richard Roeper).

Need a final word? Here it is: this film commits the two cardinal sins of the horror/comedy genre: it is not scary (ever) and it just isn't funny.",1193443200,11,5109,6.900928792569659
2929245,4,B000V4UH08,"Billy Connolly is ""Fido"" a pale-faced, flesh-eating undead. Like ""Lassie"" a little boy named Timmy unexpectedly finds a best friend in this zombie. Against the background of the 1950-ish melodrama with Carrie-Anne Moss as beautiful mom and Dylan Baker as nervous dad, Canadian film ""Fido"" is an interesting mixture of two genres - comedy and horror, leaning more towards the former than the latter though there are some gores to be seen.

Basically this is a comedy based on one joke, but the joke is pretty funny, poking fun at American pop culture and zombie films. After the devastating war against zombies, humans found a device to ""tame"" zombies with a special collar that can curb their desire to eat humans, thanks to the brilliant people at Zomcom Company. In this way surviving people decided to use them as kind of general handyman, having them do a variety of chores for humans.

But things go wrong when Timmy finds his best friend eating something in the nearby park. Timmy unwisely tries to cover up the incident only to find the whole situation out of control. Yes, the film's setting about a bullied boy and flesh-munching zombie looks like a slightly drawn-out sketch from SNL, but it is amusing nonetheless.

""Fido"" makes fun of zombie films, but it can be viewed as satire on American lifestyle. It also makes us laugh with delightfully silly lines (some uttered by Carrie-Ann Moss herself) and campy ideas like 'Trinity' dancing with a zombie. Tim Blake Nelson is also funny as Timmy's neighbor who lives with a cheerleader-turned-zombie Tammy.

To call ""Fido"" a zombie movie is misleading as this is essentially a comedy. This is not ""Shaun of the Dead"" either, another great satire; the humor of ""Fido"" is something akin to that of ""Far From Heaven"" with George A. Romero's wit. Sit back and enjoy watching it as such.",1193443200,4,1840,4.8317460317460315
2929246,5,B000V4UH08,"i saw this at the film festival in portland, it was great! everyone in the theatre laughed out loud the whole way thru. such a great spoof on not only zombie movies, but 50's culture as well. definitely worth buying if you have any sense of humor at all.",1189468800,9,254,4.204081632653061
2929247,5,B000V4UH08,"Those looking for the next great Zombie film look no further!!  This is one of the best movies I've seen in a looooooooong time!!  ""Fido"" kinda takes the idea at from the end of ""Shaun Of The Dead""(another Zombie great, and for those of you who haven't seen it.. SHAME ON YOU) about domesticating Zombies.  All the remaining Zombies after an outbreak are fitted with collars created by ""Zomcon"" that prevents their hunger for human flesh & are then sold & kept as house pets & laborers.  Sometimes though the collars malfunction & carnage ensues.  ""Fido"" has a great wit & sense of humor, I laughed almost the whole way through.  It's really more of a satirical comedy than a horror film.  I love what the movie says about ""the elderly"".  There are scenes from the movie that feel like they've been ripped straight from ""Lassie"".  A young boy running through an open field followed by his staggering pet Zombie, classic stuff.  Billy Connely perfectly plays his undead character, I couldn't believe it was actually him under the make-up.  Carrie Anne Moss also does a great job playing a typical 1950's era house wife in a not so typical world.  As not to spoil anything plot wise, I've really already described all that you'll need to know going in.  Why didn't this get a wide release theatrically, I'll never know.  This is definately one you'll wanna own, pre-orderer it, or race to your local DVD store on release date.  This'll definately go down in Zombie history as one of the greats!!!",1188864000,27,1494,4.670498084291188
2929248,5,B000V4UH08,"This is one of the funniest and best made films I've seen in a long time.  There are just a handful of movies that I've loved enough to see more than once in the theatre; and I saw this one twice in two days.  The attention to detail makes this wonderful to look at while the script and acting make it delightful to experience.  Director Andrew Currie is flexible enough to combine satire, comedic timing, and even stylistic acting in this movie without slowing the pace or compromising the material.  He gets flawless performances out of every actor, even his child star (K'Sun Ray).  The Lassie references are loaded with critical humor.  This movie is a perfect departure from the Matrix movies for Carry-Anne Moss, who gets to flex her comedy muscles, here.  Whether you love or hate classic horror thrillers, you'll love laughing all the way through this one.",1186704000,6,864,4.72

Think humorous like Zombieland but on a shoestring budget. It was campy, predictable with atomic retro flair everywhere which I always enjoy. This movie also had heart with a tongue in cheek nod to 50's horror flicks. For me it was a movie I could enjoy without much thought. Also enjoyable was the eye rolling disdain my wife had for this particular movie. In short, watch it. It's good stuff!",1445558400,2,523,4.515789473684211

I can't say I hate it, because it was a well done movie, but I think the idea was stupid to begin with.

2929336,4,B000V4UH08,"Fido (2006)
 I like to see the take on the Zombie experience by foreign film makers.  Fido comes from Canada which is technically a foreign country and it is a hum-dinger.  How they managed to come up with $9 million of some body's money to make the film I don't know but I we in the fan community give our gratitude in big buckets.  We fans live for a chance to see Zombie films made with style, imagination and naturally, with excellent production values.
 The production in all respects comes right up to real movie standards.  In fact among the 13 awards garnered from around the world we have the coveted Leo awards in the categories of Best Overall Sound, Best visual Effects, Best Make-Up for a Drama and Best Cinematography.  The Vancouver film Critics Circle gave it the award for Best Actress in a Canadian film (to Carrie-Anne Moss) and also Best British Colombian Film.  We have the real deal here, not just some slap dash pile of junk.
 We enter into the story some years after the Great Zombie War.  The Great Zombie War seems to have taken up the historical space used in our universe for WWII.  Our heroic veterans fought the great and catastrophic war which engulfed the entire world in a titanic struggle to a successful conclusion.  Now we are in the equivalent of the mid 1950's in a kind of Leave it to Beaver world of hard working dads and moms that stay at home and greet their returning husbands wearing printed frocks and bearing cold Martinis.  We have a good return on the price of admission just seeing the classic 1950s cars lumbering about.  This utopian, of a sort, life style exists only in the fenced communities, guarded night and day from the wild Zombies outside the fence line.
 Oh, and new technology in the form of an elaborate electric collar allows common citizens to command the obedience of the undead.  They serve the public as cheep if inept servants and laborers.  Little Timmy (played by then 13 year old Canadian actor K'Sun Ray), a grade school kid with no friends and a loveless home life, names the family Zombie Fido and adopts him like any kid would to with a large, clumsy dog.  Billy Connolly played Fido, a part that he managed to make not just real but endearing without using any dialog.
 I found this whole idea delightful.
 Famous actress Carrie-Ann Moss (the Matrix trilogy, Memento) plays the mom.  She never slips from her brittle role as a social conscious suburbanite wife.  Dylan Baker (Requiem for a Dream and many other roles) perfectly plays the haunted, distant and probably cowardly father.  Both mom and dad try their best to maintain proper appearances in the midst of the world wide Zombie infestation.
 Naturally, having Zombies around all the time is just about as bad an idea as we would think it would be.
 Director Andrew Currie also had a hand in the writing along with Dennis Heaton and Robert Chomiak.  All of these men are professional film people.  But I take my hat off to Set Director James Wollcock.  He also comes from a professional film making background.  I credit him with the cool 1950s style of the community which helped make the movie so much fun.  He won the Genie award for Best Set Direction, so I am not alone in appreciating his work.
 Star Carrie-Anne Moss moved far enough along in her pregnancy during filming that a pregnancy had to be written in for her character.
 I am devastated to tell you that this really quite nice film did horribly at the box office.  It brought in a paltry $426,000 at the box office which did not dent the 'around nine million dollars' the producers plunked down to make the film.
 I liked this one so much that I give it four brains, right up there with the best Zombie films ever made.  It runs one hour and 31 minutes and carries a typical R rating for some limited gore and Zombie shooting.

When I came back to the tv and noticed the 50's setting I decided to watch for awhile. Well now after watching approximately 15 times in the last month and a half I am pretty much addicted to Fido. The movie cast is phenomenal. It is right up there as being one of my all time favorite movies. I am 53 years old which means I have seen quite a few movies.

It was really pithy, and underneath the zombie motif was a very interesting critique of the fifties way of life in Amurica. The style of the film is very accurate, and harks back to any movie warning about 'creeping Communism'. Not really laugh out loud funny, but very entertaining.

It's entertaining enough; not much acting going on here, but the script doesn't require it. It's interesting to see where Carrie Ann-Moss landed post Matrix (bummer for her, I guess), but nobody stands out as bad. The characters are all pretty one-dimensional; the bad guy ends up a zombie (spoiler!) and the mean bullies get zombied (is that a verb?) and then killed. Happily ever after.

It's also going for this weird Pleasantville theme; I guess all people in the fifties were zombies? Or being a zombie was thought of as positive? Not brilliant social commentary, but we watch Moss go from someone worried about what the neighbors will think to actually doing something to take care of her family.

I'm not sure what I think about referring to the zombie as ""boy."" The finale of the movie is showing how ""Fido"" is actually a better father than the little boy's real dad. So why is he referred to as ""boy"" like a dog and kept on a leash? It's a little weird, conceptually. At least at the end he's allowed to smoke.

I like weird; weird is good. With all the tent pole crap coming out of Hollywood now; it's entertaining, at least, to see a film that tried to do something different.",1400544000,,1441,4.385767790262173

2929425,4,B000V4UH08,"Zombies are everywhere, and although I love a good zombie story just as much as the next guy (in my top three horror movies of all time is the remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD), they do tend to blur together, with the only real distinction being whether this flick has fast zombies or slow zombies.

FIDO is certainly unique. It takes place in an idyllic 50's universe where zombies have been reigned in by a corporation named ZomCom. Using special electronic collars, zombies are made into docile workers and do everything from deliver milk and newspapers to washing cars and gardening. When the Robinson family finally gets their first zombie (Fido), however, it threatens to tear the family and neighborhood apart. Literally! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

Okay. That's the only zombie pun I'll do. I promise.

Combining classic sci-fi elements with the aw-shucks mentality of the Andy Griffith show, the film is a straight-faced satire that actually develops a pretty complicated subtext under its goofy analogies comparing Fido with a Lassie-type boy's-best-friend. Fido ends up becoming close friends with the son of the family, a fresh-faced boy named Timmy (what else!) who is estranged from his golfing, emotionally distant father and is picked on at school by a bully duet straight out of Central Casting. Through Fido, Timmy begins to learn complex lessons about human nature, God, love, honesty, and mass murder.

I'd say the only real problem with the film is that the story is built so sloppily that it becomes hard to figure out what position, ultimately, it's trying to take. Some of what seem like throwaway jokes (Tim Blake Nelson plays a pervvy neighbor with a super hot zombie chick that he's probably using for more than just chores), end up becoming larger, more uncertain set pieces (let's just say the pervvy neighbor may or may not be so pervvy...? It's unclear). Anyway, the biggest problem is that the film can't decide if it should have some kind of moral -- and even then -- what that moral should be. It ends up taking a kind of kitchen sink approach to its symbolism and satire, and so the ultimate result feels weirdly nihilistic, in spite of what is obviously supposed to be a happy ending (as far as such a thing is possible in a zombie film).

In spite of this chaotic plotting, the movie is a lot of fun, beautifully filmed, and has a super strong cast doing excellent work, including an unrecognizable Billy Connelly as our titular character and Carrie-Ann Moss as the internally conflicted Mrs. Robinson. Definitely a movie you should check out if you have a sense of humor about undead cannibalism or are just looking for a technicolor twist on the same old zombie tropes.",1385251200,3,2694,4.772532188841201

2929430,4,B000V4UH08,"Pros:
- 1950s atmosphere done right! From the traditional family values and attire, school, work, vehicles, even appliances and interior design, this movie has it all! Its like a zombie Pleasantville!
- The opening is like an ode to those silly black and white educational films from back in the day
- Fun twist in controlling the zombie epidemic with collars that would turn the zombies into pets and helping hands
- Good delivery of jokes and humour throughout the movie
- The zombie makeup is done tastefully and doesnt get lost during dark filming
- The cast and acting are perfect for this genre of film, you won't be disappointed
Cons:
- I wish they would have gone more into the neighbour with zombie girlfriend
- I think they could have made the soundtrack so much better, but I can understand keeping the film light and simple
- The writers or perhaps directory of this film could have worked on timing, perhaps instead of 1.32 Hrs kept it closer to say 1.05 Hrs?
Altogether I still found this film comical and endearing and I would recommend it with an open mind! I will note this, many reviewers continue to reference Shaun of the Dead perhaps with lack of the understanding that pretty much any movie paired with British humour is good. This unlike Shaun of the Dead has a completely different sense of humour.",1384473600,3,1322,4.629787234042553

This film has some of those amusingly cheesy but character enhacing qualities which made NOTLD so enjoyable. Fido's story has surprising debth and more than a few interesting plot and character details. Granted this won't be everyone's idea of a ""good"" zombie movie, but for me it was refreshingly different and unexpectedly entertaining.

This is visually one of the best looking DVD's I've ever seen. The black levels, sharpness and color saturation are quite amazing for a DVD. I would be really curious if the PQ would be noticeably improved on a blu-ray when comparing on a 50"" or smaller high quality display.

The sound quality is quite good. The fact that this is an atomic-era story, and there are few scenes that use more than simple effects and dialog, an uncompressed soundtrack would add little benefit. Voices are extremely clear, surround effects are effectively and judiciously used so as to add to the story and humor, and never detract from it.

The fact that the movie is rated R for ""Zombie related violence"" is laughable. I've seen many comedy-horror movies rated PG-13 where the violence and gore are much higher and frequent than this movie. This is an attestation to how the MPAA is a fickle group, whose conservative views go out the window when one of the big studios is involved (See&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Film-Is-Not-Yet-Rated/dp/B002SAMMME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">This Film Is Not Yet Rated</a>&nbsp;for an eye-opener to what the MPAA really is).

It looks suspiciously like 1950's America, with everyone in snazzy clothes, full skirts (and the young girls are probably wearing crinolines underneath them) and every family is a happy family. Enter the zombies. A control collar has been invented which allows the zombies which are all over town to be handled, and used to do simple tasks. You may have a zombie gardener, or a zombie dog walker. The collars prevent the from doing violence against the living around them. Many families keep an undead family member around to help with the chores.

You're seeing where this is going, right? What if a control collar fails?

A control collar does fail, but instead of the zombie who wears it going berserk and eating all the neighbors, we find he has a heart of gold. A rotting, stinking, heart of gold.

That's all I'll say about the story. This movie is a feel-good zombie flick like you wouldn't imagine. Next to Dead Snow, its definitely one of my favorites in the zombie genre.",1361836800,2,1062,4.698924731182796

Little Timmy and his mother quickly become attached to their new pet, but a hiccup in the collar's wiring leads to an urban outbreak after Fido attacks one of the neighbors! FIDO is the funniest play on 50's consumer culture since EDWARD SCISSORHANDS. The Robinsons, like each of the other families on their block, are more concerned with status and appearance than even their own safety, especially when your worth is measured in zombies. The script, written by Robert Chomiak, Dennis Heaton, and director Andrew Currie, is filled with dry wit and satire, which is played out perfectly by the all-star cast. Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker are exceptionally hilarious as Timmy's two out-of-touch parents, and they are backed by Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, and many others in excellent supporting roles. Kesun Loder fully embraces the role of the 1950's youth in another winning performance. One character stands out above all others, however, and that is the aptly named Fido, played by Billy Connolly. Connolly creates the most lovable zombie in the genre, and takes turns playing the mindless flesh-eater as well as the playful pet. Currie brilliantly contrasts the bright, sunny streets of suburbia against the unbridled gore of a Fulci flick, while upholding the incredible production values that bring the 50's back to life. FIDO is one of the best of 2006, and a wonderful Horror comedy that will uphold its cult status for years to come.

2929470,5,B000V4UH08,"Fido is a Canadian zombie comedy movie starring Dylan Baker, Carrie-Anne Moss and Scotland's very own Billy Connolly in the titular role.

Fido is set in what appears to be a 1950s era, alternate universe USA where space radiation has resurrected the dead and turned them into flesh-eating zombies. So far, nothing unusual for a horror flick, right? Well, let me continue...

Fido is set after the ""Zombie Wars"" where mankind defeated the impending zombie apocalypse but the aforementioned space radiation still zombifies the dead, unless they are decapitated or cremated. Still, seems like your run of the mill zombie flick, right? Read on...
Enter Zomcon, the all-powerful corporation that has developed the technology to enslave zombies, sells them off as employees and domestic assistants and keeps every good American safe in their beds at night.

Fido focuses on the All-American Robinson family in the town of Willard (a knowing nod to Romero's 1968 Night of the Living Dead) and how each member of the family have differing attitudes towards zombies and their new house-zombie, Fido...
Naturally, things take a turn for the worse and the story evolves but I wouldn't dare ruin the movie for you!

For me, the star turns really do come from Moss and Connolly. Moss gets to shine in a role that allows her to demonstrate that she's more than just Neo's fancypiece and Connolly gets to zombie up and display his comedic skills without uttering a word.
This zomcom feels familiar yet fresh. Fido feels like the plot of an extended episode of The Twilight Zone crossed with Pleasantville.

It would be fair to say that Fido had a mixed reception and took less than $500,000 at the box office; particularly disappointing when you consider that the budget ran to $8 million. I would submit to you that this is not a true reflection of the quality of the movie. This isn't an adrenaline fuelled gorefest but it's not simply a 91 minute way to kill time either. Like Romero's Dead movies, Fido offers up some cutting social commentary and at times, is more satire than true horror. However, many of the best Twilight Zone episodes were similarly skewed and I don't see why Fido ought to be excluded from the genre for not being classically ""horror"".

Fido might be a little too quirky for many of you fiends out there but I believe that if you give it a chance, accept it for what it is (zomcom) and you'll enjoy it.",1352505600,,2415,4.76555023923445

2929486,3,B000V4UH08,"I really wasn't expecting much from this movie, but I wound up really enjoying it. The plot's been described by plenty of reviewers-in the town of Willard, following the ""Zombie Wars,"" citizens own zombies as domestic servants and pets. There is a large fence around the town, protecting the citizens from the ""Wild Zone,"" where zombies run free. ZomCom, a gigantic corporation that provides everything from milk to cars also has developed a collar which, once on a zombie, renders him harmless and obedient.  If anything goes wrong with the collar, the zombie returns to his natural, wild state. There are several different themes going on in this movie-a parody of 1950s society, a satire of animal shows like ""Lassie,"" and conventional zombie movies. It carries most of them off pretty well. The film also includes some wonderful characters. For example, one of Timmy's neighbors has a young, nubile zombie (""They got the collar on her before she hit the ground!"") who is misusing his zombie shamefully. In one scene, their figures are seen through his curtains-evidently he's removed her collar and, chained to the wall, she lunges at him as he dances just out of reach. There's also a satire of the family dynamics involved. The prime figure, Timmy, has a father who's terrified of zombies, and an overbearing wife who wants to fit in with the neighbors. But there's a downside to this paradise-you're responsible for your zombie and if he gets lose and eats someone, off to the wild zone you go!

2929488,4,B000V4UH08,"""Fido"" drags on a bit, to an end that isn't so bad. The use of pastels and overall color saturation, which is by now a long-worn device to indicate the 1950s, I could have done without. ""Pleasantville,"" as example, depicted the '50s with less hyperbole and to greater effect, its b&w-into-color template notwithstanding. This 90-minute movie might have clicked better as a 60-minute episode on a cable network.

Still, there are interesting facets, not the least being seminal moments of individualism, feminism and diversity from the POV of way back when. The characters are well delineated and well acted, especially by Billy Connolly,of course, who conveys his character with only grunts and groans and YAHHHS!

I thought it was interesting that the zombies were heavily involved in lawn care and park maintenance (Mexican Zombies?). There were subtle touches throughout the movie - in one scene the Dad is in bed flipping through a magazine. Instead of reading ""LIFE"" which was the scribe of the 50's-60's - he's reading ""DEATH.""

2929496,3,B000V4UH08,"Fido, directed by Andrew Currie, is a watered-down zombie film set in the 50's after ""space dust"" resurrected the dead.  Previous to this setting, an apocalyptic war was waged against the reanimated wherein the living were able to safely gate themselves off from the zombies and go about some semblance of their former lives.  A scientist for Zomcom, the government agency assisting with the epidemic, invented a collar that has allowed a reintegration of the undead as public servants.  The film follows a suburbanite family in the town of Willard, (ring a bell?), that purchases their very own zombie.

I was immediately impressed with the design for this film.  It's a period piece housed in a beautifully crafted landscape.  The interior of the family's home popped wonderfully as did the surrounding neighborhood, complete with vibrant cars cascading lazily down the spotless avenues.  This aspect of the movie is tight and entertaining.

The ensemble is also impressive.  Carrie-Anne Moss and Billy Connolly steal the show, but notable performances by Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, and Tim Blake Nelson are also turned in, here.  There was clearly a dry, conservative style of comedy designed for this film which most of the cast delivered flawlessly.  The child actor playing the main protagonist, however, to me, just fell flat.  I quickly became bored with him, which is unfortunate as his role is crucial to the success of this project.

Oddly enough, though, my favorite characteristic of this film is the soundtrack.  I absolutely loved every song chosen for this movie and found them brilliantly placed.  (I mean, ""Put a Lid on It"" by the Squirrel Nut Zippers?  Come on, now...that's a win.)  Adoring the music blaring from a zombie movie is an odd feeling.  I'm dedicating one rate-star to this alone.

Now, these are three ingredients that SHOULD propel this effort to the head of its genre, but in the end, they don't quite pull it off.  This is by no means a bad movie, but it's definitely not great.  I realize that the cheese is intentional, but it dragged like a dead leg behind this intended comedy.  Some lines garnered a chuckle, (like the infomercial with an alarmed child saying, ""Grandpa's fallen and he's getting up!""), but a lot of it is fairly bland, (the Lassie reference made me groan.).  One thing I didn't tire of was the driving scenes.  The old-school scrolling backdrop was a nice touch.

In the end the film is endearing and tastefully executed, but peaks out like a soft-rock song.  I've seen funnier zombie movies.

  They actually went out of their way to create a `C' movie, the kind that all of us old movie buffs adored as kids, and they actually remained faithful to it while accomplishing something quite extraordinary. They added in some `B' moments that set up certain plot undercurrents, and then hit you with some `A' moments in key scenes.
  The movie starts out patently `C' .. totally shallow and superficial.
  Carrie-Anne Moss, a superb actress who starred in Red Planet, hands you that first `B' moment that is going to elevate this thing into a cult classic, followed by key `A' scenes.
  However, it would be wrong to imply that one actress carried the whole movie. Frankly, the entire cast was superb, and Carrie-Anne shines in that setting. And, yes, FIDO (Billy Connolly) took those scenes with Carrie-Anne right over the edge without ever once being vulgar. He even manages to demonstrate why zombies retain certain compulsions even after death, and did it without uttering a coherent word .. and that scene is absolutely hilarious.
  One of the pivotal `A' scenes was delivered by a young actress who played a zombie. She never once spoke. Yet that scene, as brief as it was, crystallizes many of the curious things that happened before, and that will soon happen by the end of the movie. It was a superb set up, and you don't realize what happened to your perceptions until it's too late.

The story takes the basic idea of ""Night of the Living Dead"" and carries it to its logical (?) conclusion, with a ""suppression collar"" that keeps the zombies from eating humans, thus making them desirable as cheap servants. And because they are, technically, dead, they don't need to eat.

All of this is set in a Sirk-ish '50s America, where wealth and status are more important than simplicity and friendship.

Perfect acting and direction, my only quibble being that I'd like a slightly faster pace at times. Highly recommened, especially for those who like the thigh-slappingly twisted.

*Spoilers*

I wasn't sure what to think going into ""Fido"", but I'm a fan of dry humor and I love zombie movies, so I figured I might like it. I wasn't expecting, however, to absolutely *love* the movie.

""Fido"" is a hilarious deconstruction of the zombie movie genre and is the perfect thing for getting into the viewer's head. When Mrs. Robinson brings home a zombie servant to help around the house (just like all the other smart, stylish families in the neighborhood!), Mr. Robinson is initially horrified, as is the viewer. The initial reaction is that this is a suicidally stupid idea - how is it even remotely worth it to risk death (and undeath) all for someone who will ineptly help around the house? What if the control collar breaks or malfunctions? And when we learn that *all* dead bodies become zombies in this world, even ones who die from natural deaths, the viewer can't help but agree with the sentiment that the very old and terminally ill should be preemptively locked up for everyone's safety.

It's a testament to the writing in ""Fido"" that the viewer slowly, eventually, and unexpectedly comes around to the prevailing blase opinion of the day - zombies are everywhere and there's no point in dwelling on it. It's no accident that the house-zombie's name is 'Fido' - zombies in this world are something akin to dogs. Most of them are placid and docile (thanks to modern technology!), but, yeah, occasionally accidents happen and someone loses an ear (or worse). But that doesn't mean that you don't still own dogs - just that you have to be careful, and isn't that true in any society? And, of course, the local elementary school teaches precision gun firing, possibly the most hilariously morbid scene I've seen in a movie, ever. And, sure, you can stress over your undeath, and pay massive amounts of money for a ""head burial"", ensuring you don't come back, but strip away all your presumptions and you come around to Mrs. Robinson's point of view: Is that really such a bad thing?

The writing and acting in ""Fido"" is absolutely superb, and this is easily one of the best dark comedies I've ever had the pleasure to watch. If you like zombie movies and have a sense of humor, you're almost sure to like ""Fido"". Do yourself a favor, check it out, and enjoy having your presumptions turned upside down.

The story is almost Disney-esque: an emotionally stunted family, a lonely boy, and the dog (or in this case, the zombie) who shakes things up. Don't get me wrong, it's not a family movie. Where there are zombies, there's walking, decaying corpses feasting on the flesh of the living. Fun for everyone!

2929519,4,B000V4UH08,"Fido (Andrew Currie, 2006)

Now, think about this with me: Billy Collins (The Boondock Saints) as a big, somewhat docile zombie. Mull that over for a few moments. With that information alone, how can you possibly go wrong? All Currie (Mile Zero) had to do with his second feature film was sit back and not screw it up. It may sound like damning with faint praise to say he does it wonderfully here, but I don't mean to; Fido is a bona fide hit.

Collins plays the title character, a six-foot-tall zombie in an alternate America where zombies have been domesticated with electrified collars. They do menial jobs and the like, working in factories or providing the average middle-class fifties American family with cheap help around the house. Fido is one of the latter zombies, having been hired by Helen Robinson (The Matrix's Carrie-Anne Moss) in a keep-up-with-the-Joneses move over the objections of her husband Bill (The Stone Angel's Dylan Baker), a mom-and-apple-pie traditionalist who thinks zombies would be better off in the ground where they belong. Helen and Bill have a son, Timmy (TV actor K'Sun Ray in his only feature appearance). Timmy doesn't cotton to Fido initially, but the two of them gradually bond. Unfortunately, not long after that happens, Fido eats a nasty neighbor. Will Timmy go as far as covering up a murder to keep his new friend part of the family?

I'm starting to notice something about Canadian flicks, at least those I've been exposed to recently. It's probably not something that should surprise me, since this is how most of the world's film industries work, but the Canadian films I've watched recently place a lot more emphasis on characters, especially quirky ones, than American films do. Think here about Guy Maddin, say, or Daniel Roby (La Peau Blanche). Johnny Kalangis (The Mad)? Yeah, him too. Currie fits the profile as well, not only giving us a sharp, funny analysis of the fifties American family stereotype, but filling the neighborhood with a lot of fun characters, many of them played by actors you know from other places (Tim Blake Nelson, Rob LaBelle, Sonya Bennett, Henry Czerny, and more). Needless to say, in a film of this quality the quirkiness isn't the only reason for the existence of these characters in this neighborhood, but it's a nice touch. Witty, intelligent, with fantastic acting and solid direction, Fido is definitely worth your time. ****",1248739200,,2415,4.9287469287469285
2929520,4,B000V4UH08,"Fido takes place in an alternate 1950's where the idyllic nuclear family exists. Except now they own Zombie slaves (as a sign of social status, ha!). This is able to occur because some scientist developed a special collar that curbs a Zombie's innate desire to nibble on flesh of the living. Now Zombies are as harmless as a pit-bull (wink, wink).

The story follows, The Robinson Family, and the acquisition of their first Zombie, Fido. The Robinson's awkward son Timmy (K'Sun Ray) is initially hesitant of the man-beast, but it doesn't take long before Zombie becomes Boy's best friend. Horrifying comedic situations begin to arise after Fido's collar temporarily malfunctions and he once again craves flesh.

This film works because it absolutely nails the 1950's vibe. In the beginning of the film there is a memorable scene where Timmy's school-teacher takes the class outside to practice headshots on cardboard Zombie targets! It's hilarious because it seems perfectly normal to see children handling rifles in this twisted version of the 1950s. Another reason this movie succeeds is because Billy Connolly plays Fido so perfectly. He is able to convey tons of emotions with his sympathetic puppy-dog eyes. Not many people could pull off the role quite so well, but Connolly is sublime as the loveable Zombie lead.

The amount of actual gore is pretty tame for a Zombie flick. However, nobody is sacred in this film... women, children and old people are all destined to become Zombie fodder. The movie is certainly comical and I found myself chuckling almost the entire time. I really dug the quirky characters like Mr. Theopolis and his undead concubine, Tammy. Carrie-Anne Moss plays the feisty, protective mother of Timmy. Ms. Moss (if you're nasty) is still smoking hot and plays the role with much aplomb and vigor. She brings woman empowerment to this Zombie filled 50s and she perfectly plays the free spirited ""Ying"" to her Zombie fearing husband's (Dylan Baker) worrisome ""Yang"".

Overall, Fido is a satisfying Zombie Comedy. The tale feels like a morbidly perverse episode of Lassie, except instead of Collie we have a Zombie. It's unique, has plenty of laughs and even has time to toss in some social commentary. Even with the influx of Zombie Comedies in recent years, Fido still smells fresh. To me Fido is the Sandlot (1993) of Zombie Films...it's fun to watch, lighthearted and people of all ages will enjoy watching it.

The story is original, yet, some familiar elements from the Day of the Dead horror movie in which scientist learn how to ""enslave"" the living dead and keep them as servants.

Who says zombies can't be converted into useful members of the community?  Certainly not the makers of ""Fido,"" who take us to a never-never-land version of the 1950's where the undead have been turned into butlers and servants for the burgeoning middle class.  Timmy Robinson is the all-American boy who becomes emotionally attached to the family`s new full-time domestic - a recently resurrected zombie whom Timmy has affectionately dubbed Fido.  All of this has been made possible by Zomcom, a big-brother-type organization that has found a way to render the zombies (who were originally brought to ""life"" by radiation from outer space) manageable and docile - at least most of the time.

This twisted, modern-day spin on the TV series ""Lassie"" - it might easily have been entitled ""A Boy and His Zombie"" - takes slyly satirical swipes at such pre-`60s concerns as obsessive social conformity (here keeping-up-with-the-Joneses means having more zombie servants than the folks next door), the sterility of suburban life, the corporate control of civic affairs, small town corruption and nuclear family values - all played out in a beautifully designed setting of parti-colored houses and immaculately manicured lawns.  The movie doesn't hit the audience over the head with its message nor does it engage in endless hyperbole to generate laughs.  Instead, this is a low-keyed, subtle little satire that elicits appreciative chuckles rather than full-bellied guffaws.  Much of the humor derives from the incongruity between the placidness of the setting and the cavalier attitude towards death demonstrated by the fine citizens of the community (Life Magazine has been replaced with a periodical entitled Death Magazine).  Despite some playfully graphic violence, the movie stays true to the spirit of innocence we generally associate with both the 1950's itself and the cheesy, low-budget horror movies that were so much a part of the pop culture scene of that decade.

K`Sun Ray, Carrie-Ann Moss and Dylan Baker are amiable and appealing as the wide-eyed Timmy and his Cleaver-esque parents (with slightly sinister undertones), while Billy Connolly accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of bringing a great deal of humanity and depth to the role of a resurrected corpse.

2929532,5,B000V4UH08,"Every so often a movie comes along in a particular genre and does things ""outside the norm.""

Fido is such a movie.

Yes, it's about zombies. Yes, it's about gut-munching. Yes, it's about survival in a post-apocalyptic world.

But that's where the similarities end compared to other end-of-the-world zombie flicks.

This movie is more like a cross between Pleasantville and Night of the Living Dead, with a little bit of humor thrown in there as well.

After a zombie epidemic took over most of the world, a lone scientist invented a collar to control the undead and, through the ventures of the company Zomcom, was able to transform these mindless and hungry monsters into humanity's slaves, turning them into butlers, house aids and gardeners.

Enter the Robinson family, the only family in the '50s without a zombie. However, things change when the people-pleasing mom, Helen Robinson (Carrie-Anne Moss), gets Fido, a lovable zombie with life and warmth.

Fido quickly becomes best friends with Timmy, Helen's son, but one day when the collar goes on the fritz and Fido eats the neighbor, everything changes, a cover-up ensues and it's up to the Robinson family to hide Fido from those who would want to take him away and kill him (which is something that Daddy Robinson would love to see).

This isn't your standard zombie movie. Far from it. It has heart, and though a comedy, it's not slapstick or silly. Just regular funny moments. Billy Connolly as Fido is charming, lovable, fun. You genuinely care for the poor dead guy. You smile with joy when he's happy. Your heart goes out to him when he's sad. You even side with him when he gets mad and takes out his uncontrollable hunger on unsuspecting victims.

The story is original. The dialogue is great. The cast couldn't be better.

New spins on genres are something I've always been into. Though classic takes on things have their place, every time something new comes along it's like a breath of fresh air and Fido is definitely that.

Even hardcore zombie lovers who need a dose of shambling, rotting corpses and loads of blood will enjoy this film as there are ""classic zombie moments"" in it as well.

This DVD also contains director Andrew Currie's extremely poignant short film, Night of the Living, about the cause-and-effect of alcohol in the family but with a zombie twist.

Very recommended.

2929533,4,B000V4UH08,"I have to say, before picking this movie up, I saw all of the praise reveiwers were throwing it's way, but still wasn't sold. I finally caved in when I saw some pretty reliable reviews posted by folks I've met through the horror forum here on Amazon, and broke down and bought it. I finally got around to watching it this past weekend, and was surprised. ""Fido"" is not only original, it's truly funny. The basic premise is that in the 1950's after a zombie outbreak, a scientist has figured out how to tame them, or at least mute their hunger for human flesh. Zombies are then put to work as bag-boys, paperboys, milkmen, as well as personal servants. The zombie business becomes big business, and one family gets caught in the middle. The line that sold me was when the little boy was watching television and a commercial comes on with a young girl running in terror from her grandpa. The announcer walks onscreen and says ""The Elderly, sure they seem nice. But can you really trust them."" That was just too funny. ""Fido"" is chock full of offbeat humor, and being the odd parent that I am, I showed this film to my 10 year old son, who loved it as well. And while there is some gore, ""Fido"" really does follow a kid's movie pattern, similar to ""The Iron Giant"" or ""E.T."" (kind of like ""E.T., you know if E.T. included scenes where the titular alien chewed off the annoying neighbor's arm??!), but the fairly tame gore presented is outdone weekly on TV's ""CSI"". As for a B-movie, this film sported a pretty impressive cast, as well as setting. If you are a classic car buff, make sure you watch this flick with a tissue in hand to wipe up the drool. The vintage vehicles are eye-poppingly beautiful, and further enhance the surreal tone of the film.

2929534,2,B000V4UH08,"The idea to make a zombie movie where they are under control and a boy owns a zombie as a pet seemed like it has possibilities. Quite frankly, over the last few years, I have become absolutely sick and tired of Zombie and Vampire movies being unleashed on DVD by the truck load. but when a comedy that sounds like something along the lines of ""Shaun Of The Dead"" comes along, I figured this would be good for a laugh.

Unfortunately, by the time this movie finished, I thought it could have been so much funnier then it was. I mean, thinking of it now after seeing it, I cant recall anything that sticks out on my mind. No funny scene, no classic quotes. And it just makes me wonder what people are seeing in this that I missed?

On the cover it has written, ""Instant Classic"" & ""Madly Funny"" by whoever gave it those reviews. I disagree with that... so a zombie who is brought by a family becomes the sons pet, and eats a few people, while caring for the family and hinting at a romantic relationship between zombie and the boys mother is classic and funny? ... ok, on a PG scale maybe.

I dunno, I just fail to get a laugh out of a zombie the family treats like a dog. As a Mad TV/SNL Skit it would be ok at most, but as a whole movie?

Those who said this movie is better then ""Shaun Of The Dead"" need there heads examined. And the other thing that was weird to me, why is it set in the 1950's or so? It's not that it bothered me, it just left me wondering why did they do that?

Being someone who hated ""Napoleon Dynamite"", this may be that type of humor that I can not grasp. Maybe my sense of humor is too morbid for this kind of comedy approach, I dunno.. I just did not get what was classic or so funny about it. Seemed pretty average to me.

I give it two and a half stars, it was watchable from start to finish without being boring, the lighting and editing is nice blah blah blah... there's no problem with the movie production itself.. I just did not find it to be funny. Or maybe I expected it to be more funnier then it was judging by the praise in reviews it gets, i dunno... i cant recommend you avoid it or anything, it seems the reviews for this movie are completely random.. so you will have to see it to decide for yourself I guess.",1214956800,,2252,4.1068181818181815

Humans have been killing off these flesh-eating creatures until a brilliant group of scientists whom form a company called ""ZomCom"" create special devices that can control the living dead and make them nice especially as slaves to human beings as they provide services like delivering mail, cooking, and even as butlers. Average neighborhood boy Timmy (K'Sun Ray) seemed kind of lonely even without a pet, his mother (Carrie-Ann Moss) purchases a friendly and lovable ghoul named Fido (Billy Connelly) until one day in the park, as they play together the Collar malfunctions as he starts to attack and eat some innocent people. ZomCom's top specialist Mr. Bottoms moves across the street as he must try to find a way to control these raging creatures especially their relationships with humans.

Hilarious and exciting Sci-fi horror comedy from Canada is an instant cult classic! This gem is a brilliant satire on 50's culture and zombie movies alike, not since ""Shaun of the Dead"" or ""Dead Alive"" has there been a zombie comedy like this before. The acting is great including Connelly's performance as the title creature whom is a very ""Frankenstein""-like beast that anyone can relate to, there is some gory zombie violence shown in the movie but not too graphic as most and there's over the top humor that will make you laugh.

This DVD contains good extras like audio commentary, deleted scenes with optional commentary, trailer, The Making of ""Fido"" featurette, storyboard with make-up and concept art galleries, and Zombie-Me creator DVD-Rom extra.

2929536,4,B000V4UH08,"I really enjoyed this movie - especially the sarcasm regarding how a single company can monopolize an industry just because it is needed by the country in order to survive.
The story takes place in what appears to be 1950's USA after a devistating war against humans that have risen from the grave. A company invented a collar that can control the aggressive urges of the zombies and thus saved the day so that now people can ""own"" the undead as slaves (basically).
Young children are taught at an early age to shoot guns and aim for the head to kill, because you never know when your grandparents will kick the bucket and try to eat you.
The little boy in the story finds out that there is more to these zombies than just mindless brain eating - when his mother purchases a zombie to be their maid (just to impress the neighbors) - he finds out that the undead have kept part of their mortal spirit when thier zombie tries to help him instead of eat him when the collar malfunctions.

2929538,4,B000V4UH08,"I saw this at the rental store the other day and I am always a sucker for Zombie flicks. But alas I decided not to and left it up to my wife to choose the movie (Fool's Gold).

  Later that night while checking out the Free Horror movies On-Demand I saw it was there on FEAR.net. So I was like sweet I am going to watch it. This was one of the funniest zombie movies I have ever seen. Very unique in it's story and it is shot like ""Leave it To Beaver"" episode which just adds to the comedy.

  I have since gone out and purchased it. Most B-Movie zombie flicks are just tolerable at best. This movie is actually really good and actually makes me want to see more of this alternate universe. I do not understand anyone who would bash this movie....all I can think of is that they were upset at the new ""Day of The Dead"" movie which is horrible. That or they want ""Dead and Breakfast"" to not be the worst zombie movie ever.",1214352000,,921,4.088888888888889
2929539,4,B000V4UH08,"First of all, this is not a comedy.  Sure, it has some funny moments, but it is much closer to movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Where-the-Red-Fern-Grows-A-Bantam-Starfire-Book/dp/0553274295/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Where the Red Fern Grows (A Bantam Starfire Book)</a>, except with zombies.  The comedy is more of a subtle satire, with only a few big laugh moments, and the actual story is quite touching.

I found Fido really interesting. It is set in a post-zombie world, what looks to be nearly 30 years after humankind defeated a zombie plague. The movie never indicates when the plague occurred, but the technology & aesthetic of the film are very 1950s, so perhaps the zombie war was supposed to be analogous to the 1920s(?). Zombies are still very much a part of the world, both in the 'wild zones' outside cities and within the cities whenever someone dies. Funerals are the most expensive luxury in the world, since they require extensive precautions, including a separate head coffin. A monolithic corporation, Zom-Con, has super-ceded the government, and it developed a method of controlling zombies, effectively creating a docile slave-race, as long as their control collars keep their flesh-eating habits in check. Thus opens the film.

The film is beautifully done, with the detailed world fleshed out through very natural story bits and small details that don't detach from the narrative. I loved the subtle detail of every man carrying a handgun in a shoulder-holster, and the zombie killing scouts were especially fun. The main story is about a young boy who is unpopular in school, who befriends his family's new house-zombie. The more the boy interacts with the zombie the more the zombie shows signs of some kind of intelligence, eventually defending the boy from bullies and looking over the mother with a not unwelcome but leering eye. The father character in the film is by far the most interesting. He was about 10 when the zombie plague broke out, and there are lots of photos of him and his father in the den, with the father holding up zombie heads to the horrified 10-year-old. It is eventually revealed that his father turned zombie, and he had to kill his own zombie father, which, naturally, haunts him for life. In turn, he seems to hate his own son, being petty, spiteful and even mean for almost no reason. Over the course of the film it becomes clear that he acts this way so that his own son won't have the emotional trauma of having to kill a beloved father, but it still strikes a very strange tone for the entire film. The father is eventually removed from the movie in a bit of a strange and abrupt scene, and it is never clear how the son really feels about his family relationship.

The other really interesting bit of the film was the extremely causal attitude about death. At several points zombies erupt into the peaceful community, and dozens of people are killed, only to turn zombie themselves. At no point does anyone express any regret that these people are killed, even though several times it is the direct fault of the main character's actions.

Not to analyze too much, but it really is a great movie. Lots of fun moments, a good story, and just a beautiful juxtaposition of 1950s uber-color with zombie decay. The world that was created for this story is very compelling, and I'd love to see other stories set in the same milieu.",1213574400,,3440,4.953206239168111
2929540,1,B000V4UH08,"What was the point of this movie? I doubt anyone can tell me because there wasn't one.
Fido takes place in an alternate universe where cosmic dust bombards the earth in the 1940's causing the dead to reanimate spurring a world war of humans versus zombies. Sound interesting? Don't get your hopes up, all of that interesting stuff happens in the first 5 minutes of the film during a mock newsreel informing the film's watchers of what's happened since the dead have risen and how humans won the ""zombie war,"" creating collars that keep the flesheaters in check and how they are now used as slaves.
The entire rest of the movie takes place during the 50's in an idyllic patriarchy where we get to see all the funny things that happen when we turn zombies into day laborers and house servants.
I'm guessing that the makers of Fido were trying to say something about slavery, women's lib, racism, etc. But none of that comes across as the storyline for Fido makes absolutely no sense whatsoever and in the end doesn't seem to have anything at all to say other than ""zombies are people too"" I guess. Sure, they're dead, probably stink to high-heaven and will eat you if their control collars malfunction, but other than that, we should learn to accept them and appreciate their cultural difference and diversity.
Fido is an exercise in insanity, borrowing from Romero's original intended satire from his first two dead flicks which spoke of the red scare of communism and the idea of a new generation eating the previous one.
I guess Fido is meant to be a comedy, but in order to be funny, a comedy has to have some form of satire that comments on our own daily lives and causes us to question the way we are and why we do the things we do while making us laugh at the same time.
Fido doesn't do that, so it's not a comedy. It's not scary, so it's not a horror either. What is it? It's a nonstop fanboy homage to older, and meaningful zombie flicks.
All that said, I do have some nice things to say about Fido. The cinematography, set design, colors and actors are all great. So in that respect it's much like a turd dipped in gold, but scratch the surface and I think you'll be able to smell what I'm talking about - Fido is stinko.",1213228800,,2229,4.439024390243903
2929541,4,B000V4UH08,"After passing this film in the video store numerous times I had assumed it was just another zombie flick until I read up on it a little. The story sounded much different then any zombie film I've seen thus encouraging me to pick it up. I couldn't have been more pleased with the film. It was stepping back in time to an old Leave it to Beaver episode only from a zombie fan's perspective.

The film takes place in a friendly suburban town after a zombie war took place. A company called ZomCom has taken control of the walking dead situation in 2 ways. Either they take a zombie that is trainable, slap a collar around his neck and make him a household servant or the zombie is sent into a sectioned off area where they can't get to any other human. Now you have the robinsons who are the only family on the block without a zombie of their own. Mr. Robinson has quite the phobia of zombies but is persuaded into keeping their own zombie by the lovely Mrs. Robinson, played by Carrie-Anne Moss. As the days go one the Robinson's son Timmy takes quite a shine to his new zombie eventually giving him the name Fido. Going on walks and playing catch/fetch brings a strong unity between the two. The story gets quite good but I don't want to give too much away.

I think you will be very happy with this one if you go into it knowing what to expect. There is zero in the scare department but that is not the intended purpose of the film. It is best sumed up as a dark comedy. So if you are a fan of these type films I would absolutely recomend this one.",1212883200,2,1548,4.2087542087542085

The zombies are domesticated somewhat but there are rogue zombies as well.  The end of the movie is pretty depressing when you see just how crappy the humans have it.

All in all it is a worth zombie movie.  Not as good as shaun of the dead but worthy never the less.",1212451200,,452,4.079545454545454
2929543,4,B000V4UH08,"This Canadian production is one of the best horror comedies and period films available for fans hungry for bizarre and madcap entertainment. The current exploitation of the Zombie genre gives place to many different styles and moods, and a good tense and goofy  comedy about the legend of the undead and the apocalypse on earth, with all the violence and gore implied, mixed with all-american family values and ""pet"" ownership responsability in a dystopic society that domesticated zombies for labor work, is always welcome.

Weird as it sounds, this movie is pure fun, with no major ambitions that showing a hilarious vision of a 50's era alternate universe, where domesticated zombies play a functional role in society: They deliver the milk and the mail, and even help in household chores. When the earth passed throught a cloud of space dust and the dead arose from their graves to devour living human flesh, it seemed than all hope for humanity was lost.  After the mayhem and chaos unleashed by the living dead, the scientist of the Zom Com company created a special collar that turned the vicious animated corpses into docile beasts, willing to obey some basic commands. This concept of  ""protection"" is, as you can imagine, very fragile and it test one's imagination over terrible things to come, creating a funny tension about this extravagant new society.

Now, little Timmy Robinson (Ksun Ray) isn't quite convinced of this menacing urban panorama. This quiet but skeptical young boy spends too much time alone in his bedroom, developping an anti-social behaviour that worries her beautiful mother (Carrie Ann Moss), who just purchased a zombie nicknamed Fido (Bill Conolly) to help with the housework, not knowing that the creature will soon forge a friendship with the boy at the point of becoming a member of the family. Things go out of control when Fido's collar starts to malfunction and some neighbors begin to die, but the most interesting twist is when the top specialist in zombie control of Zom Com, Mr Bottoms (Henry Czerny) , moves across the street, increasing the complications of the situation and threatening to ""block"" the human and zombie relations.

Speaking only for myself, this movie enchanted me for its simplicity in the vision of a colorful dystopic society living side to side with flesh-eating ghouls, and the melodramatic macabre vision over human-pet relationships, creating a bizarre paralel universe where the very concept of normality is the basis for entertainment. There's no abuse of the zombie imagery, the focus of the film rests in the freaky and abnormal 50's atmosphere created, and the performances are superb for this kind of film, destined to become a cult reference in the zombie sub-genre. The opening scene of the educational black & white video for kids in school, is an early highlight for this outrageously funny horror comedy. Higly recommended.",1212105600,41,2907,5.071129707112971

I didn't really know what I was getting myself into at first (just looking for something to have on tv while I worked on something else) but I found myself baffled by the nonchalant attitude of this zombie film. It's like a mix of Shaun of the Dead and Starship Troopers. Absolutely fantastic!

2929547,4,B000V4UH08,"In the aftermath of a war which pit humans against zombies, surprisingly there seems to be a way for both sides to co-exist in the small town of Willard: a corporation has trained the zombies to act as servants to the human race, allowing some to reside within the gates of the town.  Despite the fact that the land outside the town is rank with unruly undead, and the fact that she has a young son (Timmy, portrayed by K'Sun Ray), Helen (Carrie Anne Moss) still thinks it is a good idea to impress her neighbors by bringing a zombie into her home.  Initially the zombie (Billy Connolly) is treated like the family pet-- hence the title, Fido-- but Timmy very quickly learns where there was once a person there still resides some very human emotions.

Directed by Andrew Currie with Cinematography by Jan Kiesser, Fido features excessively bright colors to exaggerate the bubblegum simplicity of the 1950s-era in which the film takes place, evoking memories of Gary Ross' Pleasantville.  Such a surreal backdrop serves to perfectly depict the conflict within the characters over their hypocritical behavior.  Helen struggles with her new feelings for Fido amidst a souring relationship with her own rude and ignorant husband (Dylan Baker); he almost serves to be her adulterous temptation--in a strictly emotional way.  While the individuals of Willard seem to advocate repression as a way to ""live morally,"" they keep the zombies an arm's length away, perhaps representing that living solely to feed your desires is just out of reach.

Fido is in no way a typical creature horror film; yes there are moments when blood spatter or a severed arm will fly across the screen, but those are strategically placed to break up moments when characters are sharing something particularly touching.  Much like John Gulager's Feast before it, Fido mixes humor and gore to carry Currie's point across in a lighthearted manner, but it is never campy.  And Currie seems to have a lot to say about people, their relationships, and the way they deal with each other-- or the way they don't-- and he chooses to do so through sharp and sardonic metaphors in a tired genre.  While at times the conclusions he wants the audience to draw feel a little forced and slightly reaching, it is a welcome surprise to have something to think about during a horror film for a change.

Fido was only granted a blink-and-you-missed-it limited release in early 2007, playing on a few screens across the country but mostly at special engagements during film festivals.  Also like Feast before it, Fido's real audience will come from its DVD release, on which viewers will be pleasantly surprised to find quite a few ""extras,"" such as a behind-the-scenes featurette, which gives glimpses at the phenomenal work that went into the make-up FX.  There are also three photo galleries on the DVD, one of which is devoted to showcasing that make-up.  In any horror film, the detail that goes into transforming ordinary actors into anything non-human is always exceptionally detailed, so it is an added bonus to see how it all comes to life in a film like this where the zombies are in various stages of rotting and decomposition, and therefore each one has a slightly different look.  The Conceptual Art gallery is similar in that it allows viewers to take a closer look at just what design went into Fido as a piece of art.

Along the same lines, Currie's storyboards are digitized as another extra, but without the Script-to-Screen commentary, they resemble just an unnecessary flipbook.  Perhaps if you want to get into this industry on the camera or directing side and have never heard of this tool before, this feature is worth taking a look at, but if not, just skip it.  Then of course there is the obvious audio commentary track with Currie, one producer and one actor (Carrie Anne Moss), which is beneficial if the movie leaves you with conflicting thoughts about Currie's intention for the story.  Watching it again with this feature turned on will grant you new insight.  The few deleted scenes prove Currie made strong choices in leaving these bits on the cutting room floor, however, and the interactive Zombie Creator DVD-Rom game allows you to turn yourself into a creature... if you take the time to pop the disc into your computer, but that requires more effort than the feature is really worth.  Unfortunately, noticeably absent is a gag reel-- an extra that is always welcome, as it allows viewers to see actors getting punchy, taking liberties with dialogue, and playing jokes on each other.  For a film that relies on comedy to break up serious moments, it would only be fitting that the DVD do the same.

Fido is a strong, intelligent film on its own; it doesn't need a lot of flashy extras to make the DVD worth checking out, but it offers a few of them nonetheless.  Even if you're not a diehard horror fan, Fido focuses on the human condition and is therefore a must-see.",1210982400,,4955,4.802352941176471

2929550,4,B000V4UH08,"It's all the more rare these days that you'll come across a zombie movie that has some originality to it.  Fido is one of those rarities, as it presents a world stuck in the wholesome 1950's that is also recovering from a zombie epidemic, and the major corporation called Zomcom that has discovered a way of domesticating them.  Young Timmy (K'Sun Ray) is bullied at school and basically ignored by his zombie-phobic, funeral obsessed father (Dylan Baker), who also has a habit of ignoring his wife (Carrie-Anne Moss).  Things change however when all are introduced to their new zombie pet Fido (Billy Connolly) who soon befriends Timmy and develops a crush on Timmy's mother.  Naturally, things don't go too well from this point forward.  What makes Fido so good is how deliriously dead-pan director Andrew Currie has managed to satire the 1950's, creating one big joke and visual gag that plays out throughout the film's running time.  Billy Connolly is so good as the title character, even though he never speaks a real word, while everyone else (including a very funny Tim Blake Nelson) are quite good in keeping straight faces throughout the proceedings.  While the premise does start to wear a little thin as the end of the film approaches, Fido is a wonderfully original and morbid take on the idea of a boy and his dog and the zombie genre alike.

Scottish-born comedian Billy Connolly (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Boondock-Saints/dp/B00005PJ8R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Boondock Saints</a>) stars as Fido. Normally a pretty loud and brash actor/comedian, here Connolly has zero lines (unless you consider occasional moans and groans lines) as the newly installed zombie in the Robinson household. Installed? you ask. Yes, installed. Post-zombie wars, the world now uses the undead staggerers for menial tasks thanks to a new control collar placed around each zombie that makes them docile and family friendly.

Not surprisingly, since we're talking Lassie, the young son of the Robinson house is named, yep, Timmy. Timmy is played by relative newcomer K'Sun Ray who is more familiar to television audiences as Jason in the series SMITH. But here the young actor shows his comedic muscle by taking `Lil' Timmy' and making him Fido's best friend. Fido, in turn, becomes Timmy's best friend also. The two form a boy-and-his-dog relationship that transcends the Lassie version and takes it to a hysterically funny level (""What's wrong, boy? Is someone in trouble?"")

More surprising than young K'Sun Ray, though, was Carrie-Ann Moss (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B0002Y69NG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>&nbsp;trilogy) as Timmy's mother Helen Robinson. Stuck in an emotionless relationship with husband Bill (Dylan Baker,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Across-the-Universe/dp/B000ZLFALS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Across the Universe</a>), Helen finds solace with her son and a strange awakening to her feminine needs with Fido. It's creepy, sappy, nostalgic and terribly funny all at once.

There is so much going on in the film that it's tough to cover all of it with one simple review, so I'm not even gonna try. But I will say that sex, sexual repression, death and funerals, zombie-paranoia, big business, big government, and plays on morality are all interspersed throughout Fido.

If you're a fan of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-of-the-Dead/dp/B0006A9FKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun of the Dead</a>, you owe it to yourself to see this.

2929557,4,B000V4UH08,"FIDO takes place in a world where thanks to a mechanical collar, zombies (like those from NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD) have been captured and tamed.  People live in fortified and relatively secluded 1950s suburban utopias.  Outside of these protected communities is ""the wild"": natural land where zombies roam free.  Thanks to the collar, people use zombies as servants and they are a status symbol; anyone who is anyone has a zombie and the more zombies you have the higher your position in society.

Timmy Robinson (K'Sun Ray) gets beaten up and made fun of quite often because he asks a lot of questions and can't shoot a gun very well.  Timmy's dad, Bill (Dylan Baker), is saving enough money so that everyone in the family can have a ""proper"" funeral and not return after death as a zombie.  Bill has also forbidden the family to get a zombie; the creatures freak him out ever since he had to kill his own father when he turned into one at the beginning of the Zombie Wars. But, Timmy's mom, Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss) is tired of being an outcast and gets a zombie unbeknownst to Bill.  Timmy bonds with the zombie, names him Fido (Billy Connolly), and becomes best friends with him.  However, when Fido's collar malfunctions and he bites a next door neighbor, the town goes into crisis mode and Timmy has to decide between his own feelings for Fido and what's best for his zombie.

FIDO is a delightful movie.  It's a lot of fun to watch and lovingly parodies many classic movie elements, e.g. boy and his dog films, buddy films, zombie films, etc.  The bright cheerful colors of the set are in such contrast to what is normally a very dark subject matter, zombies.  Besides, I really liked the steam-punk setting of a modern day citizens trapped in a 1950s world for safety.

The actors are charming.  Billy Connolly does a top-notch job as Fido. He doesn't speak any lines, but does a better job of acting in a simple look, gesture, or grunt than many top-billed Hollywood favorites.  Carrie-Anne Moss is best known for her role as Trinity in THE MATRIX movies, but illustrates in FIDO that she has a depth of talent and there's more to her than her pretty face and gorgeous body. K'Sun Ray has a great feature film debut as Timmy.  I also really liked Tim Blake Nelson as Mr. Theopolis, another next door neighbor of Timmy's that has a female zombie that's also his companion.

FIDO isn't a typical zombie movie, but it is a great comedy.  It's very off-beat and funny.  Highly recommended if you're looking for something a little different.",1203206400,,2546,4.6177777777777775

Zombies are used for labor and as servants. The Robinsons get a zombie and he is named Fido by Timmy, their son. All hell breaks loose when the collar stops working.

The film is very funny describing an post-zombie war era. Children's ""outside activities"" in school are target shooting, 12 year olds are allowed to carry guns and zombies are everywhere. They are the help!

Fido is actually a pretty nice zombie and very soon the entire family (minus the dad) grow to love him. The acting, makeup, story and just about everything is great in this film.

Carrie Ann Moss is great at flirting with the zombie, Billy Connolly at playing Fido, the zombie. He expresses so much even though he is, well, a zombie. The movie is just great and everyone should watch it.",1202774400,,1084,5.597560975609756

I loved the movie.  Set in the 1950's, where Zombies are captured and turned into domestic servants via a dog collar type device.
A lonely boy, often beat up-Well his family gets a zombie.  The Zombie becomes only one of two friends the boy has.  The boy names him FIDO-Like a pet dog.

And what a wonderful, warm hearted (if cold-fleshed) zombie Billy Connelly gives us!  Truly a zombie you could settle down with and call your own.

Not really violent at all, except for a couple of scenes, and those are so obviously cartoony that it really didn't impact me as being a violent movie at all.

2929562,4,B000V4UH08,"I really liked this film. I had been waiting for it to come out on dvd for about a year. I thought it sounded good and planned to see it at the Sundance Film Festival near where I live, but didn't get the chance. I finally got to see it and I wasn't disappointed. True, it's not Shaun of the Dead, Night of the Living Dead or anything like that. It's a little different take on zombies and what it would be like to ""domesticate"" them. The story has a 1950's look to it and starts out with a father that hates zombies and won't buy one to help around the house and a mother that really wants to get one, so she does. Meanwhile, the little boy is desperately seaking attention from his father and once the zombie arrives, he finally finds a friend and ""father figure"" aka someone who will play ball with him, etc. Of course, things go well for a little while, but then disaster strikes. I'm not going to give anything else away as I think this is a worthwhile film to see. If you have ever seen Dead Alive, it's kinda in that vein of funny. Yes, it's kinda cheezy in some parts, but it's still better than a lot of the crap that's copied, reformated and cranked out nowadays. It's original.",1201219200,,1188,4.214912280701754

2929564,5,B000V4UH08,"I had been hearing about Fido now for a year, the theatre in our town didn't carry this movie, so I have had to wait. Just hearing the premise: Stardust makes the dead walk and a zombie war happens, a scientist (who is rumored to have had his wife turn zombie) invents a collar that enslaves the undead and the world is right again, years later the Robinson family buys its very own zombie (Fido) and it kills the mean next door neighbor, can the boy save Fido from true death? I mean how can a zombie lover resist that?

First of all it's a beautifully shot film, Gorgeous in Technicolor, you can really tell that the producers, directors, make up artists and especially set decorators thought every single detail out. The child, Timmy, even has a ""zombie"" war themed room complete with sheets and curtains. The zombies aren't too gross, because what family wants a rotting slimy zombie serving them martini's and washing their cars? They are scary enough though, to invoke that inner feeling of ""any minute they are going to bite someone."" Zomcom is the company that makes the collars, and they patrol the towns to make sure no ""rogue"" zombie infiltrates the nice 50's style neighborhoods. I guess that there isn't many rules as to what you can do with or to your zombie, because Timmy's neighbor and his ""Tammy"" are really, really, close. I love how he explains that he was in the grocery store when she had a brain aneurism and they had a collar on her ""before she hit the floor"" so she is ""barely decomposed"".

Fido is played by Billy Connelly, who I have known from White Oleander and Lemony Snickets, and although he has NO speaking parts the man steals this whole movie with just his facial expressions. No zombie has enraptured and endeared me like this since Bub in Day of the Dead. The story is a classic one, a boy and his ""dog"", growing up in a society where you don't understand why some people have more advantages than other. It's also a story of how a dead man has more emotional depth and becomes more of a father and husband, than a real live one. It's about society's obsession with death, and how you can lose your family if you hang on to the ghosts of the past.

This movie is the best I have seen in awhile, it won so many awards (in Canada) and got barely an article here in the states and that is a shame. Yes it's a zombie movie, but it's a beautiful, well written, superbly acted film that I could not recommend enough.",1199664000,9,2447,4.421286031042128

2929566,5,B000V4UH08,"This is headed to the rare ranks of cult classic in the quirky film about an event that causes people to turn into zombies upon death, unless you remove the head and bury it separate from the body, provided you can afford it. So anyway the world is overrun with zombies and one company call Zomcom has developed a collar of zombies that domesticates them and allows them to perform the boring day to day chores of life. Well Mrs Robinson doesn't have a zombie and she wants one as everyone else on the block has one, set in cliche stylized 1950's subdivision Mrs Robinson (Carrie-Anne Moss) is smokin' hot. Well she goes and gets one, however Mr Robinson who doesn't like zombies is none to impressed but who can refuse Carrie-Anne Moss in a little red dress holding a 3 olive martini? The zombies stays, but at night only out back on a chain like a dog. The family grows fond, well mom and little Timmy do, of the zombie played by Billy Connoley and the Robinsons son decides to name him 'Fido'. Well as fate would have it the collar malfunctions and Fido eats the nasty neighbor Mrs Henderson. Well Timmy to the rescue and the cover up begins. Will Fido get away? Will he escape the zombie hunters? Will they live happily ever after? You'll just have to watch this campy, quirky film to find out this and oh so much more! A great film for those that like cult films and twisted zombie flicks. There is no nudity of foul language I recall, just zombie violence and little suggested zombie love from the neighbor Mr. Theopolis with his zombie Tammy.

2929567,4,B000V4UH08,"Just when you thought you had seen all of the zombie comedies worth seeing, along comes ""Fido"" from writer-director Andrew Currie.  This 2007 film begins with a black & white film from the friendly folks at ZomCom explaining all about the cloud of space dust that brought the dead out of their graves to feast on the living, the Zombie War that humanity won, and the nifty collar that ZomCom has invented that allows you to turn one of the living dead into your own personal servant.  In other words, just think of your favorite 1950s domestic comedy and add zombies into the mix.  Helen Robinson (Carrie-Anne Moss) wants to keep up with her neighbors and so she brings home a zombie (Billy Connolly) over the objections of her husband, Bill (Dylan Baker).  Their son Timmy (K'Sun Ray) is not impressed by the new zombie until it saves him from the neighborhood bullies, at which point he names their zombie Fido and the pivotal bond of this story is formed.  Unfortunately, as zombies are want to do, Fido gets into trouble forcing boy and zombie to protect each other.

As I watched ""Fido"" the movie that came to mind was not any of the recent zombie comedies (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undead-Or-Alive/dp/B000W8OMAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undead Or Alive</a>"" being the most recent one that I have watched in that crowing sub-genre), but rather ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Balls-of-Fury/dp/B000XPU66U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Balls of Fury</a>.""  My reasoning was that both take a particular genre and replace the key element with something else: ""Balls"" is a kung-fu movie when they play ping pong when they should be doing kung-fu fighting and ""Fido"" is your standard movie about a boy and his dog only instead of a dog the titular character is a zombie.  The 1950s-era setting is pitch perfect as the backdrop for the tale (there will never be a decade funnier than the 1950s, at least as far as the movies are concerned), and it should not take much for anybody to see parallels between living during the Cold War and living during the War on Terrorism.  This is not to suggest that there is an overt or even a covert political message here, but rather a sense that ""normal"" is a ridiculous relative term.

As a zombie comedy ""Fido is not on the level of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-of-the-Dead/dp/B0006A9FKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun of the Dead</a>"" and I retain my personal preference for ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-and-Breakfast/dp/B000A3DGEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead and Breakfast</a>,"" but it is certainly work a look.  The cast features Henry Czerny as Mr. Bottoms, the next-door neighbor who works for ZomCom and embodies its corporate ideals, and Tim Blake Nelson as Mr. Theopolis, another neighbor will a penchant for female zombies half his age.  I am not sure which one is creepier, but both are certainly creepier than Fido.  The extra features include deleted scenes that have an extended sequences where Timmy and Fido make a run for it and (for once) no alternative ending.  The funniest blooper is the first where Moss loses it during one of the funerals (they just bury the head and make a point of promising that the dearly departed is not coming back).  The ""making of"" featurette is the only chance to hear Connolly's Scottish burr and really get a close enough look at him in makeup to agree that it really is him, and there is a nice storyboard version of the film.",1199059200,2,3601,5.337455830388692

It is not jumping-out-at-you scary, as one might expect of a zombie movie; it's about living, and who your family is, and where your loyalties lie. It is not especially kind to the rock-hard well-intentioned fathers of the families. Nor is it so profound as to keep one awake, but it makes a good presentation of its thesis and it is, as I said, both visually lovely and very funny.",1198368000,3,505,4.804597701149425
2929571,4,B000V4UH08,"Let's face it.  Zombies are never going to threaten us in any way.  They are never going to eat anything or anybody.  Despite this fact, that premise has been behind many horror films for more than 30 years now.  Some of them have been downright shocking - especially for the first time viewer.  These dead monsters wreak holy hell on the living and then cause their victims to join in the merriment.  They have never been the subject of any particular affection.  There may only have been the sudden shock of seeing a former friend or family member who now, as one of the undead, must be dispatched with the minimum of a bullet to the brain - and as quickly as possible.

Enter Fido.  This is a zombie movie with a human story to tell.  Getting past the ridiculous premise is the most difficult part - but if you can - the rest is worth it.  As others have put it before me, this movie is a little like Pleasantville meets Night Of The Living Dead.  But the overall effect is one that comes down squarely on the Pleasantville side of the confrontation.

In a 1950s post zombie war setting, zombies fill a large void within the human community where containment and control work to neutralize any nasty natural zombie impulse - such as devouring human flesh. Without containment, human life cannot exist for long in the wild zone - where zombies run wild.

Within the protected communities zombies provide labor for daily deliveries of milk and newspapers.  They mow lawns, walk dogs, do yard work, community cleanup and provide human companionship and possible sexual favors for those either unable or unwilling to foster a relationship with another normal human possessing free will.  They could easily be compared to this country's pre-twentieth century slaves or present day illegal alien underpaid laborers.  Nevertheless, this movie is not really about them.

When a family's newly acquired zombie is introduced to Timmy's Dad, he freaks.  Later we learn that he was traumatized by having to dispatch his dead father's zombie.  This apparently scars him for life and fosters his seemingly irrational fear of zombies even when they are under control.  Though Dad doesn't want the zombie, he caves to his wife and son's desire to keep him so that they as a family can ""keep up with the Joneses"".

Meanwhile, Timmy is happy to have the companionship of the new zombie.  Almost immediately he starts to develop a boy-dog relationship with him, and to prove it, names him Fido.  The similarities between Fido and Lassie abound.  The director makes sure we get it when in one scene Fido has to go for help as Timmy is tied to a tree and may fall victim to a yet-to-rise-from-the-dead zombie.  Fido convinces Timmy's Mom by whining when asked whether Timmy is in trouble thus enticing her to ""follow"" his lead.

The movie itself is gorgeous.  All of the color is vibrant and pronounced.  The scenery and period props - especially the cars - are all beautifully immaculate.  Therein lies the telltale problem.  Society is more about appearance rather than any underlying substance.  The substrate is dark because the entire society is based on fear - fear that ineffective containment or control of the zombies will lead to being attacked by and being killed by zombies, and fear that any person's death will not be followed by an appropriate funeral to prevent the last and greatest fear - that without it, a person could return as one of the living dead.

Many of the humans have apparently developed into unfeeling creatures themselves.  Timmy's father is all consumed with the chore of funding funerals to ensure that neither he nor his family will join the ranks of the undead once they die.  He also believes that being alive is the only thing that counts.

The new neighbor and head of Zomcon security also mentions that people shouldn't get to close to zombies or even other humans, since one day they may also have to blow their brains blown out.  Feelings of emotion could only get in the way of this gruesome but necessary chore.

All of the underlying and perhaps semi-serious sermons aside, this movie is a hoot.  There is a good deal of humor in this film which is precisely the result of all of the fear.  Some of best examples of this are uttered by Timmy's Dad.  When confronted by the fact his wife is pregnant, he blurts out.  ""On my salary, I don't think I can afford another funeral.""  When trying to convince his wife that he is a good father, he exclaims, ""My father tried to eat me.  I've never tried to eat Timmy.""  Zombies also have some inherently funny advantages.  Fido, for instance, who smoked in life, can now enjoy a smoke without fear of the negative health effects.

During the movie Fido develops a sense of propriety by choosing not to eat his owner, Timmy, or his mother - even when his control collar is inactive.  In short, by the end of the movie you are definitely rooting for the good guys (zombies) as they battle the bad guys (zombie hating humans).  By now the reason should be apparent.  The zombies have become human and the humans have become zombies.

The movie presents us with a simple choice to ponder.  When you die, do you want a funeral for protection against returning as a zombie?  Or do you want to return as a zombie (and possibly to a useful position in society?).  It's easy to rationalize like Timmy and his Mom do half way through the movie.

The acting was brilliant in that 1950's way, the color, the scenery; everything was exactly what it needed to be to re-make the 50's with a few zombies added in.  The zombies were easy to spot, shambling about in a lovely shade of blue gray doing the menial tasks in life that no one wants to do, like... mowing the lawn, or picking up garbage.  Enter Fido, the lovable zombie who the Robinson's bring home.  The Robinsons are a disturbing mess of a dysfunctional family, with a neurotic zombie-phobic dad who has little time or attention for his family, The pistol packing mother (Carrie Ann Moss) who does her best to hold the family together and gain her husband's attention, the son ""Timmy"" who is bullied at school, and friendless until Fido enters their lives.  Throw in a few neurotic neighbors and a faulty zombie collar and you have an entertaining evening.  The most peculiar thing about this film is that (apart from the zombies munching on people when off their leashes) there is nothing in this film to keep it from being rated PG.  Not a profanity, no nudity... just wholesome Zombie Goodness.",1194912000,34,1923,4.617647058823529
2929583,1,B000V4UH08,"Remember R.L. Stine's book and TV series Goosebumps (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/see-Goosebumps-The-Haunted-Mask-II/dp/B0002IQLE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">see Goosebumps - The Haunted Mask II</a>) from the 90s? That's pretty much what you're expectations should be set for with the 2007 direct to DVD release of Fido...albeit with enough gore to gain it an R-rating in the US.

The thing is, as an adult intended film Fido fails. RL Stine's Goosebumps episodes were funny and a lot more scary than Fido. Goosebumps succeeded by properly setting expectations for an age 8 and up fright fest with some silliness to tame it down. Fido fails by setting expectations for an adult comedy/fright fest, but what Fido delivers is age 8 and up humor with adult gore.

Look...I like to think that I've got a pretty good sense of humor. But, man, halfway through this film after not even a forced chuckle, I have to admit that I started scanning through Fido just to get it over with faster.

Fido has that bright 1950s-era look, and indeed it's set in that time period. The beginning of the movie is a kind-of 50s newsreel narration that explains how the Earth passed through a cloud of space dust that started bringing the dead back to life in the form of George Romero-like zombies (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-of-the-Living-Dead/dp/B00005Y6Y2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night of the Living Dead</a>). But because of a collar developed by ZomCon, zombies can be pets, milkmen, maids and even mistresses (ew!). Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix-Collection/dp/B0002Y69NG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix Collection</a>) purchases a ZomCon zombie for her husband (popular character actor Dylan Baker) and son. The son names his zombie...you guessed it!...and on a crusade they go to show that zombies really can be shiny happy members of society...as long as that darn collar keeps working correctly.

Unfortunately, my experience was like the torture of getting stuck in the room when my pre-teen kids are watching one of those horridly unfunny Nick kid series like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Naked-Brothers-Band/dp/B000W8OM6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Naked Brothers Band</a>...with gore. Oh. Hey. Wait a minute. That's it! Oh please Nickelodeon...please make a movie where The Naked Brothers get offed by zombies. Now that I'd laugh at!",1194739200,,2573,6.259887005649717

2929586,4,B000V4UH08,"Fido is yet another sterling example of horror comedy done right.  With the rise in popularity of blood-spattered comedies over the past few years, given a rallying cry by the near-flawless ""Shaun of the Dead"", true horror fans have learned that it is okay to have fun with your horror, something that seems lost in the recent outbreak of ""torture porn"" films.  Fido brings a simple but very unique spin on the zombie subgenre that offers up plenty of laughs, and just enough blood to keep everyone from the casual moviegoer to the rabid horror aficionado giddy.

Over the past decade, the zombie subgenre of horror has exploded in popularity and quantity of releases.  Max Brooks' hilariously tongue in cheek ""Zombie Survival Guide"" and post-zombie war account, ""World War Z"", along with Simon Pegg's brilliant ""Shaun of the Dead"", George Romero's ""Land of the Dead"" and ""Diary of the Dead"", Zack Snyder's thrilling re-imagining of ""Dawn of the Dead"", Stephen King's ""Cell"", and Brian Keene's ""The Rising"", ""City of the Dead"", and ""Dead Sea"", Robert Kirkman's ""Walking Dead"" series, and so many more have captivated lurker-loving audiences of books and movies alike like never before, and given new undeath to a section of horror that was starting to get a bit ripe.  With ""Fido"", director Andrew Currie has opened a brand new, wet and fresh artery of zombie horror, and earned his place among the ranks of the ever-growing undead army.

""Fido"", simply as a film, is wonderfully shot, acted, and directed, capturing the mid-century suburban style with an almost Burtonesque flair, but with even more subtle nuances, even if less originality.  Carrie-Ann Moss turns in a deceptively deep performance, with gradual, excellent character fluctuation and growth throughout the film.  Her performance alone lends a level of credibility to the movie that, otherwise, would be missing in a similar production without such acting chops.  Other props must be thrown out to Dylan Baker's obnoxious, paranoid, offbeat role as the only guy on the block who is really, really freaked out by zombies.  It doesn't sound particularly engaging, I know, but believe me, it's a blast to watch.  Also, K'Sun Ray's turn as Little Timmy Robinson shows incredible promise for a new, up-and-coming child actor, and Billy Connoly's performance as the title character is alternatingly heartrending (literally) and hilarious.

My only real gripe with ""Fido"" is its understated gore level.  In a film so feel-good and sweet, its relative lack of blood and guts often relegates it to a simple darkly comedic adaptation of any other ""Boy and His Dog"" movie.  Although blood is spilled and limbs are severed, it is often off camera, and never particularly visceral, or even over-the-top to the point of hilarity.  It is just plainly there.  the only thing lending the gore any backing for its place in the film is the nonchalant, comical way it is treated by the ""normal"" suburban characters of the film.  Still, more often than not, ""Fido"" is more ""Old Yeller"" and less ""Shaun of the Dead"".

""Fido"" is a well-worthy entry into the realms of horror, zombies, comedies, and film as a whole.  For what the film offers, it excels in almost every way, never overextending itself, but never quite spilling its guts, either.  This film is a very entertaining, funny, and warm, if a bit tame piece of cinema that will almost certainly sink its teeth in the hearts of even the most jaded horror fan.",1194134400,4,3460,4.963604852686308
2929587,1,B000V4UH08,"""Fido"" might not have been so disappointing for me if I hadn't gone into it with such high hopes. I'm not convinced I'll dissuade anyone from seeing the film (though I really think it's not worth your time, let alone money), but if you give it a try do yourself a favor and try not to expect too much.

Of course, in a sense ""too much"" describes perfectly this genre-crunching monstrosity. It is as if the filmmakers couldn't decide if they wanted a joke or an allegory, absurdity or realism, drama or gore... so rather than accomplish anything well they constructed a tortured amalgamation that does almost everything poorly.

The film plods along painfully as it attempts simultaneously to convince us that little Timmy Robinson believes that society categorically mistreats zombies... and also that he wants to become one; we are expected to sympathize with characters who routinely engage in murder or elaborate cover-ups to protect sickeningly one-dimensional relationships with each other and with the zombie that brings them together in a tired realization of far too many Hollywood clichs. Attempting so many layers of irony at once that it loses touch with its own symbolism, perhaps I shouldn't be surprised that it seems to garner an overwhelmingly positive response: too many viewers, desperate to convince themselves that they haven't missed the joke in this stupidly heavy-handed live-action imitation of a New Yorker cartoon, may mistake its self-indulgent cult-wannabe elitism for actual philosophical or artistic depth.

To them I say, go watch ""Shaun of the Dead."" You'll get all the delicious irony without a whiff of the obnoxious pretense.",1194048000,8,1660,5.163568773234201
2929588,5,B000V4UH08,"If Disney made a zombie movie, this would be it! Imagine a family film like ""Benji"" or ""Lassie"" and replace the dog with a zombie!

First and foremost, this is not your typical zombie movie. While the zombies in this movie are typical of zombies movies, this movie is not.

1) ACTING: The acting was great! There were no problems here. Everyone seemed to be very comfortable in their roles. No one seemed to be miscast.

2) PRODUCTION: This is a quality movie done right. I have no complaints. This movie was set in the decade of the 1950's and great steps were taken to faithfully recreate that era. From the cars to the homes to even the soundtrack, the viewer feels like they are in the 1950's. While there was not an incredible amount of blood & gore for a zombie film, it was there, along with an occasional arm or leg being chewed on, and was handled well. The zombie make up varied with different color faces and minimal face appliances.

3) ZOMBIES: The zombies in this one are your typical flesh eating Romero shamblers that do show signs that they remember when they were alive and also are capable of showing emotion. (Like Bub from DOTD)

4) THE CAUSE: Mysterious particles from outer space raise the dead.

This a wonderful (almost family friendly) zombie film. I enjoyed it completely, and was not disappointed at all. I would higly recommend this movie to everyone. However, if you are looking for a blood & gore, zombies on the rampage, death and destruction, action movie, then you may want to pass on this one. This is a wonderful satire, but not a full fledged ""zombie movie.""
