2616252,5,B000GRUQLK,"The title tells the truth.  Even by 1930's golden age of Hollywood standards, these five movies are literary masterpieces and true film classics.  I remember all five fondly as a teenager in the late 1960's and early 1970's in long-gone San Francisco art theaters, and cut to threads on morning prize movie TV shows.  It is an honor to watch them now in a comfortable bedroom, uncut and non-commercial.  They are, of course, MGM studio print editions that in one instance, MARIE ANTOINETTE, even contains roadshow music and an intermission never seen on television.

TREASURE ISLAND (1934) stars Wallace Beery and Jackie Cooper, was directed by Victor Fleming (CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS, GONE WITH THE WIND), and is based on a Robert Louis Stevenson novel about pirates and buried treasure.  In gorgeous B&W, it reunites Beery and Cooper from THE CHAMP (1931) and also features Lionel Barrymore and Lewis Stone.  Come to think about it, this is a reunion for half the cast of GRAND HOTEL (1932).

DAVID COPPERFIELD and A TALE OF TWO CITIES (both 1935) are towering masterpieces based on Charles Dickens novels; both are impeccably produced by David O. Selznick.  Painstakingly faithful to very long books, they both have gorgeous art direction and are cast to perfection down to the bit roles:  W.C. Fields as Micawber, Freddie Bartholomew and Frank Lawton as David, Basil Rathbone as Mr. Murdstone, and Edna May Oliver as Aunt Betsey in DAVID; and Ronald Colman in maybe his greatest performance in TALE, which also features Oliver and Rathbone.  At about 130 minutes each, they are long enough to do justice to the Dickens novels; I am sure he would have loved both immensely.

MARIE ANTOINETTE (1938), presented in a never-seen 157 minute roadshow edition, has an Oscar-nominated Norma Shearer in a wonderful role.  If someone wanted to know who Shearer was, I would show this incredibly opulent and literate costume romance to them.  It is the underrated masterpiece of this box set and also stars Tyrone Power and an Oscar-nominated Robert Morley as a shy, child-like King Louis XVI.  The magnificent art direction and regal music were also Oscar-nominated.  W.S. Van Dyke (THE THIN MAN, SAN FRANCISCO) directed.

Finally, we have a splendidly cast and written adaptation of Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (1940), starring Greer Garson as Elizabeth Bennet and Laurence Oliver as Mr. Darcy.  Aldous Huxley and Jane Murfin scripted this lovely and witty romantic comedy of manners that won an Oscar for B&W Interior Set Decoration.

But you don't just get five great movies in this Warner Home Video boxed set.  TREASURE ISLAND also comes with two shorts, a cartoon, and a theatrical trailer.  DAVID COPPERFIELD has the marvelous Technicolor short PIRATE PARTY AT CATALINA ISLE, along with a second Technicolor short, a cartoon, and a theatrical trailer.  A TALE OF TWO CITIES has a memorable 60 minute Lux Radio Theater adaptation of TALE from 1942, starring Ronald Colman, along with two vintage cartoons and the theatrical trailer.  MARIE ANTOINETTE has two shorts and a theatrical trailer, all tied in to the 1938 movie.  And PRIDE AND PREJUDICE has an Oscar-nominated patriotic short on Navy training during World War Two, plus a color cartoon and theatrical trailer.  It is one hell of a DVD boxed set, a labor of love and an absolute must-see on a slow TV week.",1174089600,45,3368,4.992831541218638
2616253,5,B000GRUQLK,"We acquired this collection because we wanted to own the 1935 version of A Tale of Two Cities. We just watched it and had a wonderful experience. The movie is very close to the plot, the performances are superb. Charles Dickens' book will forever be a testament to the struggle of humanity between the have and have nots.

The performance of Blanche Yurka, as Madame DeFarge is outstanding. The citizens of France, seeking to put an end to the tyranny they experience from the oppressing aristrocracy, presents the never ending example that when rights are stepped on, it always ends in revolution and change. The Marquis St. Evremonde, played by Basil Rathbone, provides a view to the horror it represents for anyone to show they do not care about those who suffer. Especially when it comes to children; for the horror committed against this family, sparks the fire that leads to events that put an end to the ruling society.

Dr. Manette's performance as the innocent man who was a prisoner at the Bastille for over 18 years is superb. His daughter, played by Elizabeth Allen, represents the person that inspires great love in two men, one Charles Darnay, and Sydney Carton, superbly played by Ronald Colman.

The character of Miss Pross, played by Edna May Oliver, is awesome. We go from disliking her, to admiring and then loving her for her sacrifice that saves the life of Ms. Manette. In the end, the sacrifice made by Sydney for the love of Lucie is one of the most sensitive and touching of all love stories. He finds purpose for his life, knowing full well that his actions shall forever live in the hearts of those he sacrifices for. Would highly recommend owning this DVD. The other movies shall be reviewed as we see them.",1168819200,12,1735,4.7006578947368425
2616254,5,B000GRUQLK,"A set of classic movies.

The collection includes several of my favourite movies - now in excellent video and sound quality.

I particularly enjoyed Prode and Prejudice - this is the version that all following copies are judged against. The acting is superb, and the cast is amazing!

This is a collection worthy of keeping ( and enjoying) for years to come.

An excellent example of Hollywoos at it's prime.",1168646400,2,408,4.785714285714286
2616255,5,B000GRUQLK,"This DVD set is a great example of the golden age of the movie studios.  There is a little something for everyone in this set.  The length of each of the DVD's hovers around 90 minutes and the time really zips by.  For my money, this is the best version of David Copperfield with a top rate cast including WC Fields as Macawber and little Freddie Bartholomew as David.  Marie Antoinette with Norma Shearer is heads and tails above that awful recent Marie misfire.  This Pride and Prejudice is quick, to the point and completely enjoyable with Lawrence Olivier as Darcy and Greer Garson as Elizabeth (not to mention the amazing Mary Boland as Mrs. Bennett).  A Tale of Two Cities is the best adaptation of Dickens ever on the screen.  Ronald Coleman is perfect as the doomed hero.  And finally the original pirate movie Treasure Island with the fantastic Wallace Beery as Long John Silver.  Force your kids (and yourself) to watch all or at least some of these great classics.  You won't be sorry.",1168473600,7,996,4.607954545454546
2616256,5,B000GRUQLK,"Each of these movies are treasures.  Yes they are old and sometimes slow.  Yes, the sound is not excellent.  We have all seen them at one time or another.  Still, they are filled with some of the greatest movie quotes of all time.  When Ronald Coleman says the famous line in ""A Tale of Two Cities"",  ""It is a far, far, better rest I go to than I have ever known"", you can't imagine anyone saying it better. When Laurence Oliver, speaking about his pursuit of ""Lizzy"" tells Greer Garson in ""Pride and Prejudice"" that ""..that chapeter is definitely closed"", you are seeing the best Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennet that have ever been filmed.  Yes even better than Kiera Knightly.  But as a total surprise, you get to see W.C. Fields in ""David Copperfield"".  Who would have known how great an actor he was.  I still have to check out if this is a direct quote from the book or something that Fields made up when he says...""Copperfield, I have nothing to bestowe but advice, still, that advice is so important that I have never taken it myself.....""  Enjoy these movies.",1168387200,7,1061,4.473958333333333
2616257,5,B000GRUQLK,"With the exception of ""Pride and Prejudice"" I've seen all the other films and, indeed, this is a masterpiece collection!  My favorites are ""A Tale of Two Cities"" and ""Marie Antoinette"".  They've been given top notch treatment here and I'd advise anyone wanting this collection to order from Amazon instead of paying thirteen extra bucks by buying it at any retailer.  This is a must collection for the classic film buff!  Put one in late at night (if you're a night owl) or on a rainy afternoon and enjoy because they sure don't make them like this anymore!!",1161648000,10,558,4.663265306122449
2616258,5,B000GRUQLK,"If you like classic movies, this collection is a must have.  These are some of the best performances you'll ever see.  Marie Antoinette (though at times can be a bit melodramatic) really moved me and the end of A Tale of Two Cities starring Ronald Colman is extremely moving as well.  Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson shine in the Jane Austin classic Pride and Prejudice.  I'm not as familiar with the other two movies but with Wallace Berry and Jackie Cooper in Treasure Island and W.C. Fields in David Copperfield, how can you go wrong?  Great viewing for the whole family and great viewing for a lazy Sunday afternoon!",1161302400,10,622,4.669724770642202
2616259,5,B000GRUQLK,"I read that they were releasing these on DVD a few weeks ago. I already sold my VHS tapes of these movies on Amazon Marketplace, got more than I originally paid for them years ago, and can purchase this set, when it comes out, with lots of change to spare!",1154044800,15,256,4.14
2616260,5,B000GRUQLK,"Hang on to your seats, folks, here's what we get:

David Copperfield (1938) W.C. Fields & Freddie Bartholomew

Pride & Prejudice (1940) Greer Garson

Treasure Island (1934) Wallace Beery & Jackie Cooper

A Tale of Two Cities (1935) Ronald Coleman & Basil Rathbone

Marie Antoinette (1938) Norma Shearer & John Barrymore

8134058,5,B000GRUQLK,"This set contains three movies that are among the greatest movies ever made, one movie that is very very good, and one loser.  The loser is Marie Antoinette which has some very big-name stars in it, but the overlong script puts the viewer to sleep.  Treasure Island is one of the most fun movies the viewer will ever see.  Wallace Berry plays Long John Silver-I believe no one can watch this film and not love the character he plays.  David Copperfield, A Tale Of Two Cities, and  Pride and Prejudice are the other three movies in this set.  They are amoung the best movies ever made-they will totally enchant the viewer with characters he wishes he could have as friends, and in villians that are truly evil.  Not to watch any one of these three movies is to deprive yourself of an experiance you will never forget.",1380067200,3,816,4.510204081632653
8134059,5,B000GRUQLK,"I am giving this boxed set 5 stars for one simple reason: the last half of ""A Tale Of Two Cities"".  Ronald Coleman, yet another actor who didn't survive the shift that the war brought about in Hollywood, is devastating in this one.  He absolutely transcends the inherent melodrama.  You have to see it.

""Treasure Island"" is a faithful rendition of the original Stevenson story.

""Pride and Prejudice"" is a very good adaptation of the original as well.  It is a tough story to shoe horn into 120 minutes.  Greer Garson is a bit too old, the sleeves are all a bit too big, the music is a bit to complicated.  But Olivier delivers the goods as usual.

""David Copperfield"" is not my cup of tea.

The transfers range from decent to very good.  There are no big flubs or errors in the prints.  All are watchable.",1364256000,,807,4.414965986394558

8134062,5,B000GRUQLK,"This is a must-have for fans of classic b&w movies.
Marie Antoinette is a startling work and the other incusions here are great.

8134063,5,B000GRUQLK,"These movies are some of the masterpieces of the 30s and for Pride and Prejudice, 1940.  While Hayes led his objection to the immorality of the movies, the studios tried to fend him off with upstanding works of art.  MGM didn't fall down on the job.  The films here begin in 1934 with Treasure Island.  This film looks better than I've ever seen it and it was wonderful to see Wallace Beery and Jackie Cooper together as they were in The Champ.  The films from 1935 were both Christmas releases with David O. Selznick's stamp on it, David Copperfield and A Tale of Two Cities.  We get to see Freddie Bartholomew as the young David Copperfield and W.C. Fields as his great friend.  It is a very nice movie.  A Tale Of Two Cities is even better with Ronald Coleman as Sydney, the man who changes places for Lucy, the woman he loves so she can have her husband saved from the guillotine.  Marie Antoinette is a moving, huge Norma Shearer drama which I liked very much.  My favorite is the Pride and Prejudice which is fun and I love the performances of Greer Garson and Lawrence Olivier.  It is a truly a wonderful picture.  All pictures allow the viewer to witness the acting talent MGM had under its tent.  Edna Mae Oliver must be in every picture!  John Barrymore has a field day in many and it's fun to see them in the next picture.  There was a great opportunity to develop great pictures under the studio system and we shouldn't forget that.",1216252800,,1444,4.416666666666667
8134064,5,B000GRUQLK,These are delightful.  Note especially that this version of Pride and Prejudice is a much better version than the import.  A treat for everyone!,1214524800,,144,4.958333333333333
8134065,5,B000GRUQLK,I wish I had waited for DVD before I taped these classics.  On DVD they are truly beautiful the way the original film makers intended them. Too bad they are not here to see their masterpieces restored and treasured.,1207785600,3,215,4.512820512820513
8134066,5,B000GRUQLK,"Excellent movies and the extra's ( trailers, cartoons etc) are an added bonus. Worth every penny.",1202515200,,97,5.125
8134067,5,B000GRUQLK,"Although the content of some of the movies in this box has a very tragic ending there are qualities that are common to all the dvds of the box.

First of all, the ability and amazing acting skills of the actors, whether leading roles or supporting ones, it is really a pleasure to see the superb performances they can give to a large variety of characters.

The witty dialogues, the scenery and the good restoration of the film are more than added values.

You can enjoy a journey through history with Marie Antoinette or amuse yourself with the intricated plots from Jane Austen and the classic literature from Dickens and Stevenson.

You really get your money's worth with this collection.",1178496000,3,691,4.733333333333333
