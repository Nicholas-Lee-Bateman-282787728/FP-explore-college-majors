3065299,5,B0011FLGZ6,"I am surprised at the other (bad) reviews of this set, so I have to chime in.  Of course these are not flying boats - they are airplanes, which are called 'clippers' because of the parallel to the old way of traveling around the world (clipper ships).  Pan Am had a fleet of large luxurious airplanes that flew the world in style, and this is their story.  No, there is not much hard info on the planes - this is not a documentary on Pan Am or on the airplanes, it is a collection of travelogs.

Each episode starts off on the airplane, and describes why they are special.  Sure it is promoting Pan Am, so it's a little cheesy and some of the footage is the same from segment to segment.  But you really get the feeling that Pan Am was doing something different, something a step above and beyond what the other airlines were about.  And that is the truth - Pan Am was a special airline, and its demise is a sad chapter in aviation history.  The films follow a person or couple who are traveling, and although the travelers are not very interesting, they are at least reasonably good looking and adventurous.

The travel segments are wonderful.  A slice of life from the late forties and fifties, not from the thirties like one reviewer thought.  The cars, the clothes, everything is just as it was, because the films were made then.  These are not documentaries and not travel guides, they are just fun travel and culture films.  Each one is about a different place, and there is usually more than just the main location (Norway also includes Sweden and Denmark, Mexico City includes Guatemala, etc.)  I really liked the cinematography and the pace of the films too - nothing like what you see on tv today.  I wanted to go back in time and travel the world when it was a simpler planet.

The quality is decent.  Not great, but definitely watchable.  Sometimes the sound skips or the picture is less than perfect, but overall I was actually surprised and impressed by how good the audio and video are.  The aspect ratio is the old 'full screen' 4x3, not widescreen.  So set your tv for full screen or everyone will look short and fat.

I am very happy with this purchase, and especially for $ 10 !  I recommend this 2 dvd set for anyone who loves vintage airplanes, the airlines, travel, nostalgia, and all that a time capsule like this can show you.  Enjoy !",1257552000,37,2359,4.434883720930233

3065312,2,B0011FLGZ6,"Although this attractively packaged two DVD set is listed as a ""documentary"" it is not. Rather, it is a collection of old promotional short films produced by Pan American World Airways in the 1950s, highlighting popular Pan Am destinations of the time. There is only one very brief ""documentary"" on the history of the airline, it is very incomplete, and it is the last segment on Disc 2.

I'm not sure where these extended commercials for the airline were shown, but for their time they highlighted exotic destinations with a kind of ""Oh, look, aren't these natives quaint?"" kind of feel. Having been to some of the places shown in these films, it was interesting to see how things have changed (London was still rebuilding from The Blitz) or not changed (the grand old buildings of Mexico City are still there, standing among more modern architecture).

The color quality and the sound quality of all the films (except the documentary) are muddy, and even the stern-voiced narrator keeps apologizing: ""Color film just isn't up to showing the grandeur of . . .""  At least these old travelogues are preserved here, and that's something.

There's also very little footage of Pan Am's planes themselves (the old turboprop Clippers, mostly) and nothing on the classic flying boats.

All in all, this DVD set is a curiosity, and it's definitely worth a viewing. But it isn't what anyone would expect from looking at the slipcase (which is a history of the airline)  and it's definitely something anybody could live without --- unless they're an airline historian or an armchair traveler with a taste for the really rare.

It is not really a historical documentary but more of the travel films shown to travel clubs and travel agents in the 1940s and 1950s. If you are looking for strictly a film documentary with interviews and descriptions of the planes, it is not here in depth although you will see interior configurations, a flight deck or two, Connies, DC-4s, and DC-6 or two and some of the sea planes. The seating was more comfortable in those days and meals were as you could expect from a decent restaurant, not a microwave dinner.",1414022400,,606,4.568807339449541

3065328,1,B0011FLGZ6,"This has almost NOTHING to do with the Golden Age of Aviation, e.g., airplane designs, interior, history, etc. I expected a great documentary about the history of Pan Am airplanes, while this is a just a set of 'tourist videos' with minor displays of the beautiful aircraft. If you seek vintage 'vacation reels' about a few countries and their 'retro beauty', then this DVD is for you.

3065333,1,B0011FLGZ6,"Judging by the title, ""Pan Am:  The Golden Age of Aviation,"" I expected a documentary on the historical development of the airline. However, only 5-10% of the footage covers Pan-Am operations, the rest consists of rather kitschy and dated travelogues from the 1940s and 50s, which are pretty boring, although they are filmed in color and do capture some of the culture of those decades. Not recommended unless you like dated travelogues.",1387411200,,437,5.069444444444445

You travel with different couples on different stops.

I was expecting more of this to center around Pan Am and aviation, but it's all really about the destinations. Still, it's very entertaining and I've had a lot of fun going back in time to see world travel from the pre-jet age.

Bottom line: This isn't about Pan Am - if you're looking for a Pan Am- or aviation-centric documentary, this doesn't fit the bill. Still worth it, though! Great footage.",1347840000,,483,4.551724137931035

Black & white , color it didn't matter how one looks at the video, it was captivating seeing things that were here before I was born.

3065351,3,B0011FLGZ6,"Based on the cover with a pic of a flying clipper, I had hoped for lots of footage of the early flying boats, but most is post WWII DC-7s and 8s.

If you want to see DVDs with information on the China Clipper airplane, don't waste your time.  Why they can't be honest in their advertising is beyond me.  Also, while the tin box packaging is nice, such packaging is rather overblown for what is on the DVDs.  I would recommend that if you are interested in old promotional films, first check on line at web sites offering non copy righted films or films whose copy rights have expired, to view on line or free down load.

3299821,1,B0011FLGZ6,Don't buy this if you are looking for video of the early days of Pan American Airways and their aircraft and routes across the Pacific and elsewhere.  This is nothing more than a promotional piece for vacation destinations served in the past by Pan Am.,1422144000,3,252,4.6

3299823,5,B0011FLGZ6,"As a former Pan Am brat and Pan Am employee, I really enjoyed watching this travelogue. It is not really a historical documentary but more of the travel films shown to travel clubs and travel agents in the 1940s and 1950s. If you are looking for strictly a film documentary with interviews and descriptions of the planes, it is not here in depth although you will see interior configurations, a flight deck or two, Connies, DC-4s, and DC-6 or two and some of the sea planes. The seating was more comfortable in those days and meals were as you could expect from a decent restaurant, not a microwave dinner.",1414022400,,606,4.568807339449541

3299825,1,B0011FLGZ6,"This has almost NOTHING to do with the Golden Age of Aviation, e.g., airplane designs, interior, history, etc. I expected a great documentary about the history of Pan Am airplanes, while this is a just a set of 'tourist videos' with minor displays of the beautiful aircraft. If you seek vintage 'vacation reels' about a few countries and their 'retro beauty', then this DVD is for you. In my opinion, it is misnamed and mislabeled ;-) You will get much more about Pan Am Aviation if you buy their movie:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pan-Am-The-Complete-Series/dp/B00A4Y624U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pan Am: The Complete Series</a>.",1408406400,4,679,6.010309278350515

3299828,5,B0011FLGZ6,My husband loved this book. Has great info and photos. A must for aviation lovers. Great book for a coffee table to get people talking about Pan Am.,1391990400,,148,4.321428571428571
3299829,3,B0011FLGZ6,I bought this as my husband worked for PanAm.  I thought it would have their history etc.  It was a little about the planes in the early days and old footage advertisements of locations to fly to.,1389571200,,196,4.27027027027027
3299830,1,B0011FLGZ6,"Judging by the title, ""Pan Am:  The Golden Age of Aviation,"" I expected a documentary on the historical development of the airline. However, only 5-10% of the footage covers Pan-Am operations, the rest consists of rather kitschy and dated travelogues from the 1940s and 50s, which are pretty boring, although they are filmed in color and do capture some of the culture of those decades. Not recommended unless you like dated travelogues.",1387411200,,437,5.069444444444445
3299831,3,B0011FLGZ6,"It really had very little to do with PAN AM and it's aviation (it's aircraft) . It is mostly a travel log  on some of the places PAN AM went. You travel with different couples on different stops. If your lookinmg for the old time travel logs this is a great DVD but if your looking for an indepth history of PAN AM and the aircraft that they flew.. you won't find it here.
I did like the old travel logs though..it does come in a great metal case though.",1386633600,2,454,4.044444444444444

3299842,5,B0011FLGZ6,It was bringing back memories of my own flying days with Pan am as a Flight Attendant from the 50th to the 80th. Great rendition! Highly recommended!,1375574400,,149,4.555555555555555
3299843,3,B0011FLGZ6,"This is more about seeing the place the planes flew to than about the planes, the air crews or the aviation business, but it is still fairly interesting.",1373241600,,153,4.5
3299844,2,B0011FLGZ6,"It was delivered to the wrong address. Also it is very dificult to get in touch with you.
The movie does not have that much to do with PanAm and aviation. Is more like showing different places to visit.",1367107200,,202,4.205128205128205
3299845,3,B0011FLGZ6,"Charming, fun travelogues done by Pan Am for various ports of call around the world. I was expecting more of this to center around Pan Am and aviation, but it's all really about the destinations. Still, it's very entertaining and I've had a lot of fun going back in time to see world travel from the pre-jet age.

Bottom line: This isn't about Pan Am - if you're looking for a Pan Am- or aviation-centric documentary, this doesn't fit the bill. Still worth it, though! Great footage.",1347840000,,483,4.551724137931035

Black & white , color it didn't matter how one looks at the video, it was captivating seeing things that were here before I was born. I have yet to finish watching it but it is a very enjoyable video of aviation before the era of commonality and the lifestyles of people around the world. One of these days I will watch it from start to finish.",1332201600,5,476,4.074468085106383

3299848,3,B0011FLGZ6,"Based on the cover with a pic of a flying clipper, I had hoped for lots of footage of the early flying boats, but most is post WWII DC-7s and 8s. And most are promo-type videos, rather than the history of Pam-Am, which I had also hoped for (there is a very brief history of the airline, but it left me wanting more detail). If you want footage of the later planes, this is the video for you, otherwise, not.",1297641600,,407,4.1
3299849,1,B0011FLGZ6,"If you want to see pseudo 1930s/1040s travel documentary/advertising films for various destinations.  Go for it, classic cheesy travel promotional film.

If you want to see DVDs with information on the China Clipper airplane, don't waste your time.  Why they can't be honest in their advertising is beyond me.  Also, while the tin box packaging is nice, such packaging is rather overblown for what is on the DVDs.  I would recommend that if you are interested in old promotional films, first check on line at web sites offering non copy righted films or films whose copy rights have expired, to view on line or free down load.  There are a number of resources for free (or very nominal charge) and legal viewing or downloading of similar films.  And they are generally accurately described.",1293840000,7,790,4.894736842105263

8241730,5,B0011FLGZ6,"This is a fascinating look at the past.  Most of the 2 CD's do not show airplanes the majority of the time but at the end of the European one there is a fantastic collection of visuals about Pan AM Planes.  It was wonderful to see.  As to the many other 'movies'  commercials created by Pan AM in the day, it is fun to see and compare what the past and what today looks like.  Seeing the planes interiors was fascinating as they showed one how to attach a footrest and how they closed a curtain for one to sleep.  Wow!!

If you find history fascinating, this is a DVD worth owning.  My husband who has flown for about 63 years found it very interesting and agreed it was one of the better DVDs out there of the Pan Am world of old.  I am so glad I purchased it for his birthday.",1518739200,3,778,4.032679738562091
