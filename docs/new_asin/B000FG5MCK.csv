8122044,5,B000FG5MCK,"Yes, I am a producer of this fabulous project and also an owner of the DVD. I use the product frequently in my personal life, to entertain and relax, and felt the need to clear up any questions about this DVD.

The ""Masters of Impressionism"" DVD is designed to fill that blank screen in the center of your living room with beautiful artwork from the world's most renowned Impressionist artists. It also features the classical works of Bach and Chopin to set the aural mood for each piece.

Each painting is transfered to the DVD from a high resolution scan which reproduces the artist's work, in stunning fashion, on any widescreen TV.

Plasma Window has been a pioneer in the art of using the television set as a virtual canvas to display beautiful paintings. So much so, that Plasma Window has been featured in dozens of the nation's foremost publications and the ""Masters of Impressionism"" DVD was just featured as one of HGTV's hottest new products on their hit show ""I Want That!"".

Some potential buyers may not understand the concept of using a standard movie length DVD as a virtual art screensaver for your TV.

This DVD is not a documentary on Impressionist art, the period, or the artists.

It is simply a unique product that lets you display the world's finest art on your TV with a classical music soundtrack. Nothing more, nothing less.

Enjoy the art!

8122045,2,B000FG5MCK,"It has been a few years since I last wrote any product review on Amazon, but this product has compelled me to write a negative review.

First, if you expect an abundance of great modernist paintings that would fully exploit the HD grandness that is PDP or LCD TV, FORGET IT. There is ONLY 30 shots.

Next, utilizing a DVD with 4.7gb worth of storage for 30 photos and respective music, which comes to 30 songs, WITHOUT any manual function that you can control the photo/song setup is pretty devasting for a product of this price (currently at twenty five USD). Even DVD movies costing this much has far more entertaining functions such as director's cuts etc.

Where was all that money invested into? Getting the rights to store those arts in to a DVD? And without any manual control possible for the user, all possibly using far less space available on a DVD. Kinda maks you wonder if this money was better spent elsewhere.

All in all, not worth the money I paid. Better leave my LCD TV blank, until a better solution to use that space.

May be photos of your family burned on a DVD may be a better choice that this.",1158969600,20,1118,4.434146341463415
