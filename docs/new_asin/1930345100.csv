7801391,4,1930345100,"This video is well done from a details point-of-view, from the clean accurate moves to the way each kata is registered by VCR counter for fast random access.  This is a great instructional/aide-memoire video.
The timing of the kata themselves is unrealistic; it seems each move is done to a metronome -- great for learning, but unrealistic for later training where many of these kata are practiced.  I've never done Kosokun Dai so much like a robot.  The beauty of some kata is sacrificed for the benefit of the newer student to the kata.
This must have been the intention of Sensei McGuinness in performing these kata.
I will refer back to the 18 kata on this video, lookng for details that I have missed in my own practice, until it no longer plays in my VCR.",1016236800,2,761,4.54014598540146
