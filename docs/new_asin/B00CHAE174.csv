5722193,4,B00CHAE174,This was worth the purchase.  I can't begin to express how good this movie was.  I can't wait to purchase more in the future.,1388793600,,125,4.166666666666667
5722194,5,B00CHAE174,"It charming with a subtle sense of humor and very likable characters. The character of William is a great representation of many peoples' first nervous moments experimenting with their sexuality and exploring their feelings, and the tension that nervousness builds is very realistic and relatable. It's also nice to see a short film of this nature take a more uncommon yet more realistic route than other films in this category. Very enjoyable with great characters just a pinch of humor to round everything out. I think every LGBT person will really enjoy it! And for the straight side of the fence, it's a great insight into how awkward and nervous and scary it can be for a guy in William's position to be opening up like this without going the violent or emotionally damaging route that a lot of these films tend to go for. It's got a very feel-good vibe and I highly recommend it.",1386374400,2,885,4.67948717948718
5722195,1,B00CHAE174,"This was not good, for a very short film, seemed accurate as an adolescent's first encounter, but the characters were not likeable.",1384214400,,131,5.0
5722196,3,B00CHAE174,I guess I just don't understand such a film short.  It's over before it even gets started.  It was just okay for me.,1376006400,,116,4.0
5722197,4,B00CHAE174,"I don't know if this was meant to be comedic, but this I thought this movie was very funny. I saw it at a film festival with 5 other short films for like $7. so the amazon price seems high",1374451200,2,188,3.725
5722198,3,B00CHAE174,"The gay life effects every culture, religion and creed.  I would have liked to see what happened after.  Did they reconnect?  Did they become friends?  It was obvious the father walked in on something.  What happened?  The movies leaves you wondering.",1373932800,,251,5.0
5722199,3,B00CHAE174,"I got duped...AGAIN...I must always remember to look at the film's length. But this little short is good. It could indeed become a little more, because there is much to explore between not only the coming-of-age teenage boys, but the tension between modern Jewish thinking within the religious context and the more traditional Jewish thinking (e.g., strict observance and adherence to Jewish religious laws) and the reconciliation between the two. The tension in the film is exemplified in the conservative, lawyer dad of the seeming 'straight' kid, and the liberal Rabbi and dad to the kid who has just 'come-out' to his folks. I don't think we fully appreciate that within the Jewish community, there are various divergent streams of traditions and culture. These traditions may stem from one root, but they branch-out into various versions of conservative or liberal thinking and human behavior and can result in great anxiety on the individuals caught-up in one or the other as they try to navigate and build a bridge between what they feel and what and who they think they are; and what they have been taught and what is morally, religiously, culturally acceptable. The film ""Trembling Before God,"" is a documentary that looks at this theme in a very serious manner and there is an excellent Israeli film ""Eyes Wide Open,"" (a must-see film)that also explores the religious and moral implications of homosexuality and the Jewish religious and secular tradition(s).",1373068800,5,1468,5.120833333333334
5722200,5,B00CHAE174,"I truly enjoyed Shabbat Dinner! It made me feel strongly. It reminded me how incredibly vulnerable I once felt about my own same-sex attraction! I also felt the same need to hide such an important part of myself from others!

There is also plenty of humor in this powerful short film, which given the intensity of the subject matter is much appreciated!

I also had the good fortune to meet the director, Michael Morgenstern. He mentioned Shabbat Dinner was his first film! I was amazed! If his first film is this good, I can't wait to see what else he comes up with in the future!",1370736000,3,581,4.471698113207547

8581707,1,B00CHAE174,I can't believe I paid $1.99 to rent this movie!!!  I would rather have a endoscopy procedure than even think about watching this movie again.  What a miserable experience and approximately 30 minutes of my life I would have rather spent sleeping.,1430265600,,247,4.857142857142857
8581708,4,B00CHAE174,"I think this short has a lot of potential for a movie, too bad that is only a short.
The idea is excellent.",1426464000,,107,3.6956521739130435

8581711,5,B00CHAE174,"Shabbat, I wish this happen on any of the Shabbats I attended, two young Jewish boy's coming out together, how fun.",1394409600,,115,4.523809523809524
8581712,1,B00CHAE174,I missed the fact that this one is a short 15 Minutes. This one should have been included in prime. Not worth $1.99. Great story and good acting but too much crammed into a short.,1393632000,,179,4.142857142857143
8581713,3,B00CHAE174,"The ideas and characters needed more room to develop, particularly the two boys.  Something important is missing.  And the ending makes no sense.  At least one of the fathers apparently knows what might have happened between the two boys, but we get little to no sense of how he handles it.  The film is simply too short to deal properly with all of the implications of far too sketchy character and plot developments.",1392854400,,418,4.684931506849315
8581714,5,B00CHAE174,Story moves along quickly with great acting for a short film.  Better than a lot of films twice this length.,1391126400,2,108,4.4
8581715,4,B00CHAE174,"This film is too short and I believe it should go the way of the shorts Fairies and Dare.  This should be made into a much longer film in which two Jewish families of varying degrees of sticking to Mosaic law come to deal with the realities of daily life when it comes to their gay teenagers.  I want to at least see a series of sequels in which the boy who has just confirmed his being gay to himself visits the other guy, who is  younger and more out.",1389398400,,453,4.011111111111111
