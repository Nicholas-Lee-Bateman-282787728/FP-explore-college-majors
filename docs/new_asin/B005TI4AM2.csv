8486195,2,B005TI4AM2,The product is confusing and makes no sense. It does not teach anything specific and it is waste of time and money as far as I am concern. I am very disappointed.,1360454400,,162,4.09375
8486196,5,B005TI4AM2,"The DVD is very helpful.  However, I am dis-satisfied that I had to pay over 12 in customs and clearance charges on top of the price of the DVD.",1346716800,,144,3.9655172413793105
8486197,4,B005TI4AM2,"This review is almost more about me than product. I am the type of guy who jumps in and just does something. With PPC advertising this is not a wise thing to do I have found. I wasted hundreds of $$$$ with little to show for it and I am a small operator. I am no Walmart so even a wasted expense of $50 a week can hurt. After results were lets say not so good I bought a Dummies book and this disk. Spending less than $40 saved me probably $1,000's. For $19 you can not really lose. This is something you do not want to learn on your own. Guy on disk actually said he did same thing as me and he learned. It felt good that I was not alone but I wish I educated myself sooner.",1321056000,5,675,3.8285714285714287
