8653345,1,B00JQPX868,"As a senior with low bone density, I have enjoyed a strength and resistance class and other dvds targeting bones.  IMHO, this long, drawn out dvd (over two hours) was repetitive and slow moving, thereby not offering nearly what it could have given the amount of time spent.  Many of the exercises just seemed like warm-up stretches.  The beginning and some other parts of the dvd came across to me almost like a Saturday Night Live spoof, which would be funny if people were not paying for it.",1448323200,3,493,4.579545454545454
8653346,1,B00JQPX868,"Not for healthy people. Maybe for an 80 year old. Explanations take up more tape time than the ""routines"" themselves. Teresa is knowledgeable regarding bone health but not regarding exercise videography. I have a collection of exercise tapes; this is by far the worst. Explanation portions were in between each exercise set. Bypassing the explanations took the fast forward button. Amateur video with little ""meat."" I want to workout with a video, not told to do more of ""this"" if so inclined. This video was too expensive to be this poorly produced.",1431043200,4,550,4.989130434782608
