8448276,2,B000V6U6R0,The editorial description on this product are totally wrong. I thought I was getting total start to finish fabrication DVD. Instead I received a DVD using pre-cut and pre-sized pieces of granite. VERY DISAPPOINTED with DVD.,1445644800,,223,5.222222222222222
8448277,3,B000V6U6R0,Product met my expectations. However I saw all episodes of this video on YouTube. It is unfair to sell products accessible for free.,1438646400,,132,4.782608695652174
8448278,2,B000V6U6R0,"I bought this because I wanted to put granite in my home.  This movie is not for me.  They show you how they fabricate granite with tools that cost tens of thousands of dollars or more.  For example, they show you how to cut the granite with a bridge saw that costs over $25,000.  It did have some good tips that I will use when I figure out how to fabricate with cheaper tools.",1246233600,2,378,4.0675675675675675
