1655028,4,B00005RFHF,"For a guy who's favorite films run in this genre (Blue Velevet, still ranks #1), this film was refreshingly different. At times difficult to watch...much like the gothic room in ""The Image"". While I am no expert in choreography or photography, I found the film to be well made. The story line, while a little hard to fathom being of a much different culture, was well written and kept my interest. More importantly, where this film is concerned both leading actors did an exemplary job of portraying the mental anguish as well as the physical. Well done.",1057795200,4,554,4.721649484536083
1655029,1,B00005RFHF,"""Lies"" is simply a boring movie which lacks any finesse. To compare it to Mr. Oshimas ""Realm of the Senses"" is a grave injustice to Mr. Oshima"".
The plausibility of ""Lies"" is also rather low and the cinematography dull. Where ""Realm of the senses"" is a sensual feast for the eyes ""lies"" is stark and trite. The sexual scenes seem to want to do little more than put us off sex. Furthermore they are badly acted and directed.
Lies may be important for korean freedom of expression but for the world of film-art it is of no relevance.",1056326400,3,531,4.428571428571429
1655030,4,B00005RFHF,"This, to me, felt like somewhat of a cross between ""Lolita"" and ""In the Realm of the Senses"".  The sex and SM scenes are hot, mostly: there were a few technical details that broke the illusion.  To see the descent of the couple into an alternate reality of their own making was chilling.",1055203200,6,287,4.39622641509434
1655031,3,B00005RFHF,"The film is an exploration of sexual behaviour. A couple explores its sexuality through S/M games becoming more and more intense. Is human , honest and convincing. And here is the miracle of the Corean censorship, or better the fear of it! The 3/4 of the film is involving sexual acts. In a miraculous way the director succeeds to show the less possible of the actors having sex! The position of the camera, the blured focus ect are the techniques used to avoid the prohibition of the film. The talented director tries to make an omellete without braking the eggs! He almost did it! I wouldn't like though to put myself in his position!",1036972800,5,636,4.587719298245614
1655032,4,B00005RFHF,"This movie was filmed in numerous locations throughout Korea.  I recognized parts of Seoul and Taegu in the movie.  There is not much plot to go along with the S&M Light scenes in the film but it was never intended to really have one.  This film was more of a rebellion against the Korean film industry which tends to censor films not meeting the government's moral or political dogma.  I believe the film maker based his movie around the subject of S&M simply because the Korean Film Industry said he could not.
Many of its scenes (if not all) were filmed on one take ala El Mariachi. The film was actually banned in Korea for a short period of time.  This film should be celebrated and supported for it's originality, spirit and stand against censorship rather than dismissed because of it's risqu subject matter.  This is a milestone film for Korean cinema.  If the subject matter is too hot for you then move to Utah and become a milkman.",1027382400,9,942,4.538461538461538
1655033,4,B00005RFHF,"Those who are prudish, have only a taste for vanilla sex or sexually naive should find your entertainment elsewhere.
The story line has that unresolved, vague emotional conclusion akin to ""A Death in Venice"" or ""Lolita."" The early part of the movie breaks the fourth wall which may be the director's attempt to cushion the audience to the subject matter. The more I think about it the more this seems like a lack of conviction. The movie would have been under your skin more if this trick was done away with. For those in The Scene, there is some hot impact play, switching, and one scat scene, done with mostly dialog. ""The cutest SM movie ever"" is not a far-fetch tagline.",1020038400,3,674,4.578512396694215
1655034,3,B00005RFHF,"Lies is a film about a sexual relationship between a final year  high school girl and a grown up artist. A Teenager girl wants to loose her virginity to a married grown up artist . Their relationship gets stranger with the artists lust for pain and sado mazo actions. Later girl develops a liking towards this acts and becomes the fountain of life for him. The sex, passion and sado actions are portrayed as real as a  responsible camera gets thus coming closer to the soft porn cliches with beating each other with sticks that are collected from the parks by the couple.
It is an interesting movie with the 2 characters lust in Korea a modern but a traditional country where morality and respect is appreciated. Film is not about real love but passion, lust and phantasies, so be warned.
Interesting fact is that film is based on a book which caused writer to end up in jail. But film is all around the world and especially screened in festivals.
It is not an easy film to watch sometimes so you have to make up your mind.",1017360000,43,1023,4.4361702127659575
1655035,5,B00005RFHF,"I think people seem to be missing the point a bit - misinterpreting themes of the book as themes of this film.  I actually left the theater saying ""That must be the cutest SM film ever made.""  The director does quite a few things to keep the audience aware that this is a movie we're watching.  The sex is all obviously simulated, there are interviews with the actors, etc. etc. etc.  All this makes this wind up seeming to be a movie about making a movie of a book rather than a movie of a book.  I had the distinct feeling that the choice of subject matter was more of a wakeup call to Korean cinema/censors than anything else.  What gives the movie its charm is the kind of freewheeling, almost naive ""let's make a movie"" tone of the thing.  Not a masterpiece, but intelligent and a lot of fun.",1017273600,15,797,4.273333333333333

1655048,4,B00005RFHF,"I understand that there was some controversy with this film due to the age difference between the characters, the extramarital activity and their unorthodox sexual tastes, but when it comes down to it, this film is about two consenting adults (argue exact age of consent with me if you want, [she was 18, he 33] but she clearly consented) enjoying each others company. I agree with the other reviewers that the censorship/cuts did a disservice to film. The cutting was jarring and disjointed.  The official run time was 111 minutes, while this version only comes to 55 including creditsand it shows. This was especially true in one scene where the couple was arguing and in the next they had completely made up with nothing shown in between in terms of reconciliation and growth for the characters. Is this because they worked out their emotions through some less-than-vanilla sex? It would have only enriched the film to have seen that scene. I understand that some viewers are uncomfortable with spanking and other fetishes depicted on screen but they do not have to watch it. As a consenting adult myself I could do without the abrupt fades to black, that frustrate and obfuscate the story.  I am not offended at all by the content, but I am outraged and flummoxed by the audacity of censors.  50 Shades of Gray shows a not-so-consenting (read: coerced) young woman being whipped with a belt while crying real tears of regret and pain.  Lies on the other hand depicts a couple in the throes of adventurous, joyfuland fully consentinglovemaking.  Because when it comes down to it, thats what this film is, a love story.  The main point of Lies and what makes it so wonderful is the irony of the title. Lies is about the need to be true to yourselfeven if you have to lie to everyone else.",1463702400,11,1790,4.702875399361022

1655054,1,B00005RFHF,"I watched this on Prime and found it extremely dull. A little research revealed that it has been HEAVILY censored--even the movie trailer has far more risqu material. I saw nothing on Prime to indicate that this was the censored version, which really infuriates me--I'm not a child, and I don't need to be protected from adult content! Cutting the S&M out of an S&M movie is like cutting the wizardry out of a Harry Potter film--it's just ridiculous, and the result is a bunch of characters getting all worked up over nothing. I'm really quite disappointed in Prime--if you're going to bowdlerize films, at least tell me so I don't waste my time watching the dull and nonsensical result of your disrespectful prudery.

I'd like to say they damage themselves in the long run with this lack of integrity. It has me wonder who's calling the shots on this type behavior??

I gave it two stars because of what did survive the hatchet job done to it. The two stars are billed as first time actors, or non-actors, as you got the sense there wasn't much stretching for this role.

Having watched a string of Korean-made movies of blood-thirsty characters fighting, shooting, killing, kissing, copulating and ejecting on-a-run is pleasurably surprised with this 1999 year production of sadomasochist lovers.

1655162,2,B00005RFHF,"I was at first disgusted with director Sun-Woo Jang because I had felt that he cheated me.  Jang had the potential to create a strong, deeply emotional film about sex and its effects on people, but instead chose to focus his strength on the pornography element more than the actual human element.  I couldn't see the characters at first and his sloppy introduction which blended both realism and cinema together was amateurish at best ... yet this film remained in my mind for days after I viewed it.  What stayed with me wasn't the story, it wasn't the characters, nor was it the apparent pornographic nature of the film, but the transition that Jang demonstrated between Y and J.  If you watch this film carefully, you will see that both begin in an exploration phase of their relationship, eager to jump into the unknown, but not quite certain the next step.  As they continue to meet, exploring new avenues of pleasure, they continually jump between the aggressor and the aggressed.  Jang initially explores the idea that J is the one that in control of the situation, then hauntingly, the reversal happens when J becomes obsessed with Y.  It is a very small change, and due to the graphic content of this film, it can easily be missed, but it is there.  It becomes apparently clear near the end when J cannot live with Y, as their meetings become less frequent, and J attempts to become a part of normal society.  This was a huge and very exciting element to this film to see right before your eyes, but alas, it was the only element of this film worth viewing.

I will ignore those that speak of this film as nothing more than pornographic, because there are human elements at the core of this film, as underdeveloped as they are, they are there.  It is a film about a facet of our lives that is very rarely explored in cinema or talked about in the papers.  What happens behind closed doors is never known ... or so we should believe.  While the act itself does becomes repetitive after a bit, director Jang tries to change it up a bit with some constantly changing scenery.  Our characters are continually moving from hotel room to hotel room to best quench their thirst for each other's flesh.  This is fun at first, but again, Jang's repetitive streak seems to make it feel boring than exciting.  This leads me to the biggest issue that I had with this film.  Jang had a great story with Gojitmal, but where he failed (outside of the obvious choice to focus directly on the pornographic side) was that he took scenes, repeated them time and again, without changing in front of us to allow us to get to know the characters.  Where was Jang going with this movie?  Did he want the sex to tell the stories, or did he believe the characters would?  He failed in this sense because by the end of the film we know so little about Y and J that we could care less how they resolve themselves.  The ending seems almost random at best as Jang attempts to create a final resolution for our two, absolute unknowns, of this film.  I have to give Jang some credit for trying, but not much.  He attempted to create some sub-stories that would create the personal element that we were lacking, but they just couldn't congeal well together.  Y's brother and J's wife were those plot points, but again, due to him focusing so strongly on the sexual element, these stronger sub-stories became un-rememberable and down-right dull.  Maybe it was just how I viewed this film, but outside of the sexual scenes, nothing else worked together.  We knew nothing about J and Y and that is why Gojitmal failed.

Finally, I would like to say that this film could have benefited from having a strong score or a daftly remote music genre element to it to bring us, the viewers, closer to the emotions being felt by J and Y.  From what I can remember, and I am trying to push this film far from my mind, I don't remember any musical undertones.  Gojitmal may have been a stronger film if Jang either stylized it with music or done something to allude towards our character's beings.  While I understand that he wanted the sex to speak for itself, there was just a technical element missing from this film that may have quenched a stronger desire for more.  Technically, this was a poor film.  Obviously an independent film in nature, it felt more like director Jang was trying to make symbolic references out of nothing instead of your typical independent of this nature.  I didn't see as much of a social message or human element like mentioned above, I just felt like he threw this film together over the course of two weeks and understood that the sex would sell it enough.  This was no Larry Clark production; this was sub-par and definitely needed some further technical clicks to develop it stronger than the final release!

Overall, I think I could have liked this film and there were smaller elements that I did enjoy, but I felt this film was rushed, repetitive, and played too much towards the taboos instead of breaking them.  The obvious pitfalls of this film can be seen by the last scene of this film when we are privy to how the title of this film was conceived.  Our characters were uneventful, our story was underdeveloped, and we could have used something memorable to make what was happening between Y and J into something more symbolic than sex.  To me, Jang was trying too much to capture art house meets pornographic ... and it failed miserably.  This was not a film worth the time and effort that it took to make.

1655163,5,B00005RFHF,"This Korean production left me somewhat suprised.  That is, it was a love story.  Yes, a slightly twisted love story.  My view is that interaction between our main characters was love indeed.  In any relationship, there must be a willingness to give and take, to stand firm, to compromise.  The attention that they pay to each other during their 'sessions.'  Remember, the beatings was only part of the retinue, it functioned as their appetizer, their main course, their dessert.

Another point that I'd like to make.  A reviewer commented that the man wasn't really masculine at all (skinny, wimpy...).  This is exactly the point of this 'man.'  Because of his size, it shows that while he is a man, he is also small enough to be 'handled' by the girl (in the movie, you'll see what 'handled' means!).  So, pay attention!

If you choose to buy/view this film, look for the 'lies' behind the relationships in this film (and maybe we'll all learn something!).  Five stars!",1128038400,6,971,4.77710843373494
1655164,2,B00005RFHF,"I watched this in the hope of an erotic tale. Needless to say that is not what I got. The movie does start out in that direction, but soon spirals out of control into whipping and beating. (Not to mention the low point of the film: A scat kiss.) The character J at first seems to be a sadist, as he begins whipping Y prior to having sex with her. Later in the film the whip is turned on him and his true colors begin to emerge. As this relationship progresses it seems more and more like J is just taking advantage of Y's desperate circumstances to satisfy his own obsession with the whip. I found that there was no real connection between them as the whipping becomes so pathetic you just have to laugh at him. Pass on this film.",1121990400,2,730,4.184397163120567
1655165,3,B00005RFHF,"Capt. Freaky usually loves any kind of S&M sex stuff....however, this movie falls short of being a 5 star film because it lacks the quality of people we want to watch screwing!  The girl is pretty enough (I suppose) but the man is ""girly"", skinny and not impressive as a ""dominant"" who can control any woman and whip her into submission...

Its appropriate that later in the film, he starts getting beaten and whipped by her....she cuts her hair very short (butch looking) and begins to take over as the man in this film. There are alot of ""simulated"" sex scenes... and a lot of nudity, so I gave it 3 stars for a few sexually tense moments, that are quite suggestive.  Its always a turn on for most of us when an older man or couple becomes involved with a dumb, horny,teen....

I suppose considering its now 2005...this film goes places no film dares to go these days....its not full blown ""porn"" however...there are no ""money shots"" in this film.

To sum up my review...its a weak, ""Asian"" version of some of the old Euro-trash, soft porn stuff from the 1970's.  Except most of those films are more interesting to watch and better to use as ""foreplay"" to poke your significant other, than this film would be....I imagine this film would be a serious turn on for a 45 yr old Asian housewife, who dreams all day about whipping the crap out of a naked, 18 yr old high school girl, who may be sleeping with her husband.  Yeah for those women...this would be an exceptional foreplay film!  Si-o-nara!",1106265600,6,1498,4.522222222222222
1655166,3,B00005RFHF,The story is basically about a school girl(Y) losing virginity to a married man(J). They met very often practising the same religion and there was once that Y's brother gets to know her sister's relationship with this married man and burnt his house. Y later retaliated by asking her friends to pass message around top reach his brother's ears which made him confused that he got into a bike accident(which killed him). Y learnt of his brother's death and went back to the family where she later met J the last time in Paris before she flew off to Brazil to meet her kins there. There is a hardcore scene after viewing the DVD for a few minutes. They are two sex scenes on bed and a handful of oral sex scenes and the beating scenes(almost similar to Japanese style of love 'torture') switched between the Y and J where they are beating marks on the Ass.

1655167,3,B00005RFHF,"This Korean film was the focus of SPCS moaning (unfounded, as usual), so naturally it immediately went on my list of must-see movies. The only positive thing about this morals society/ community watchdog group/ lobby group/ national menace is the free publicity they give movies- never mind they seldom bother to WATCH the movies that wind them up. David Lane had to watch BAISE MOI twice for it to fully sink in- which remains the only movie I've seen they've ""publicized"" where their complaints actually lived up to all the controversy hype. Proof that he's isn't half as clever as he thinks he is.
In actuality, LIES is a movie that will offend only the most wet-behind-the-ears conservatives, & could be described as 9 1/2 WEEKS meets THE GRADUATE.
Based on Jang Jung Il's novel ""Tell Me A Lie"", LIES tells of a torrid S&M based relationship between J (Lee Sang Hyun), a 38 year old sculptor whose wife is in Paris on business & Y (Kim Tae Yeon), a 17 year old student whose main goal is to lose her virginity before she graduates. We later learn that this is an emotional response to the suicide of her sister, a victim of brutal sexual abuse- Y would prefer to lose her virginity at a young age to a stranger than to lose it later through potential rape. Heavy stuff.
On a (slightly) lighter note, LIES features shots of the actors talking direct to the camera during the sex scenes & ECU's of nipple chomping, as well as lots of full frontal nudity. This softcore art outing soon takes a different turn when J & Y introduce BDSM practices into their relationship... and this of course marks the beginning of the end. It's probably safe to presume the movie's foley artist had a great time.
LIES is similar to the later British movie INTIMACY (which almost put me to sleep) except it's a bit more interesting.
Continuing the lighter contrast, the film is split into chapter segments which are titled to make the whole affair seem like a round of golf (this will make sense when you watch the movie).
The dialogue is often hilarious- in one scene the narrator says ""J whips her 35 times to match her hip size"". And more I can't write here so it will be a nice surprise when you see it for yourself.
Another interesting angle is that director Jang Sun-Woo has incorporated behind the scenes material into the actual film with the actors explaining why they chose to take on such controversial roles. Unfortuately, good intentions aside; this ploy comes off as simply intrusive & ruins the overall impact of the movie. It's still worth a look for all the (unnecessary) controversy it stirred up. I was a bit disappointed in that sense. LIES is far from being a masterpiece but its still worth watching for curiosity's sake.",1064793600,12,2726,4.611111111111111
