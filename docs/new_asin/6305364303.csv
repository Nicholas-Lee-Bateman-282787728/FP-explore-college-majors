7888444,4,6305364303,"Last year's big-screen version of ""The Wild Wild West"" was a misguided (and miscast) revival of a classic TV series. The early ""WWW"" episodes only enhance the film's weaknesses. ""The  Night the Wizard Shook the Earth"" marks the debut of Michael Dunn's  inimitable Dr. Loveless - the most enduring adversary of James West  (Robert Conrad). All the action-espionage elements are evident in this 1965  episode, along with the sardonic, childlike charm of Dunn's  characterization. One only wishes that Artemus Gordon had an opportunity to  display a few of his famous disguises (Ross Martin's talents are wasted in  this particular episode). Nevertheless, ""Wizard"" remains a fine  example of what ""The Wild Wild West"" was all about.",947030400,5,729,5.278260869565218
7888445,5,6305364303,"This is the first episode with ""strange little sensitive  man"" Dr. Miguelito Loveless,  produced by Fred Freiberger. It is a very important episode because you learn a lot of Dr. Loveless' aristocratic  background and motivations and you'll see his colourful assistants :  ""Moonraker"" Richard Kiel as mute giant Voltaire and Phoebe Dorin  as female singer and harpsichord player Antoinette. This is James West at  his best with the gagdets (watch closely the weapon filled carriage),  the  beautiful women (Leslie Parrish and many others) and the action. There is  an excellent score composed and conducted by Robert Drasnin; listen  carefully Dr. Loveless' theme music. Like in James Bond's films, you have a  Miss Moneypenny type of character  whose name is Miss Piecemeal. She is  Governor of California's secretary and a natural-born traitress. She will  reappear in ""The Night of the Torture Chamber"". My advice is not  to miss this great episode. This is a real reference in terms of stylish  entertainment.",940550400,9,1013,5.2375
