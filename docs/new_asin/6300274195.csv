When we were able to watch it with her it would not work in our region on our DVD player.  Since it had been 60 days, MovieMars would not replace the product.  I had never dealt with a DVD that would not play on a DVD player for this reason or a seller that would not replace a product after explaining the story.  Our DVD player is not old.

Circuses are long gone and this movie helps to show why, but once upon a time they existed long before the internet and before tv so being able to see exotic animals was a thrill for most children. It also gives one a little glimpse into times long gone. The good and the bad.

Even though i personally don't want to watch Dumbo again anytime soon I will say that if you haven't already seen it than your missing out. Dumbo is a sweet movie about a little elephant believing in himself and rising above all the haters. It has some really sad moments but for the most part it's a cute classic childrens movie. Even though Disney is a little messed up cause there is definitely a scene where Dumbo gets drunk and randomly starts hallucinating...",1514505600,,535,4.469387755102041

294479,3,6300274195,"One of Disney's classics, though after seventy-five years its reputation may have outpaced the film itself. After the financial disappointments of Pinocchio and Fantasia a year earlier, the studio tightened its belt on Dumbo in an attempt to make up for the losses. It worked in one sense, giving Disney the box office victory it needed, but that penny-pinching and corner-cutting hurt the finished product. It's astonishingly short, barely weighing in at an hour including credits, which forces a sudden, jarring climax. The story's pace is quite smooth until then, taking its time to build characters and back-story, so by contrast the immediate rush to wrap everything up in a frenzied flash is disruptive. While it's cruising along in the first half, though, things are good enough. Speckled with colorful characters and a fresh circus setting, it bottles that classic, emotive Disney magic while still taking a few risks. The infamous pink elephant scene, in particular, is an unexpectedly surreal animator's playground that's several decades ahead of the curve. I was shocked to find offbeat similarities Danny Elfman's work in the film's score, too, which may suggest an even broader influence. Playful and heartfelt, though deeply under-cooked, Dumbo feels like a breezy short story when compared to the richer, more complete films elsewhere in the studio's early catalog.",1514246400,,1380,5.334862385321101

Dumbo is a true classic, beautiful animation, touching storyline and great comic performances by all voice actors.  It's classic Disney at its best.  Timeless, its a film for the whole family, that'll leave you cheering for the under dog... er, elephant, that you'll fall in love with from the first moment you see him.  Walt Disney was truly an American Icon, and its films like this that reflect what a great man he truly was.  If you don't already own it, buy it now.  You'll be glad you did, especially if you have kids.  Show them what real animation looks like, and what real touching stories are.",1503532800,,744,4.426470588235294

The kids love it and my husband can quote parts of it (if not all). Good family movie. Theres nothing to worry about your children seeing something you don't want them to see. There is a short scene where Dumbo gets drunk. Great buy!
The story of Dumbo starts off really sad because everyone makes fun of him because of his big ears. His mother stands up for him no matter what. That gets her locked up. Dumbo is left alone until a mouse helps him out. Together they try to make Dumbo a star. Will they succeed? Watch and find out!",1483574400,,701,4.124087591240876

Who cares about the Disney business routine? They are about making a profit and entertaining their customers. For gentle, innocent stories w/a moral (remember those?) Disney is one of the few reliable film companies that will still offer fun stories w/great animation and beautiful songs.

295403,4,6300274195,"I watched Dumbo as a little child, yet it wasn't until I received a copy of the Monopoly Disney edition that I found out that Dumbo hit theaters in October 1941, shortly before Japan thrust the US into WW2 by attacking Pearl Harbor. One of the my favorite scenes from the movie was the part where the circus showman orders his animal trainers to send Mrs. Jumbo to jail for acting arrogantly toward Skinny and other kids visiting the Big Top, and Mrs. Jumbo unsuccessfully attempts to resist the ringmaster by throwing him into a bucket of water. I was also captivated by the believe-it-or-not sequence in the movie where Dumbo dreams of pink elephants on parade after drinking moonshine (which is basically vodka mixed with water), and the part where the circus ringmaster erects a house in a mock fire, and Dumbo jumps into a vat of pie filling because the clown dressed as an elephant is scared.

For kids who are baffled by big-eared elephants like Dumbo, this movie is still a breathtaking Disney classic three-quarters of a century after its release.",1469404800,,1056,4.739130434782608
295404,5,6300274195,"I can't believe this Disney came out in 1941. There are some aspects that could be criticized as not being ""politically correct"" by today's standards, however. I saw this as a child and then watched it a few days ago as a mother, and I must admit, I cried my eyes out! I cannot recall any other Disney film of any vintage that has made me cry, but this story of a mother's unconditional love for her ""imperfect"" baby boy and society's ignorance and lack of compassion, and Dumbo's struggle with ""bullies"" in a cruel world without his mother's protection, are all as relevant today as they ever were, and apply to humans as well as elephants or any other sentient being, which elephants surely are. Dumbo's painful struggles throughout the story and his well-deserved success in the end make Dumbo a much ""deeper"" film than any other Disney and put it in a class of its own.",1468886400,,873,4.531645569620253

295472,4,6300274195,"My 2.5 year old is obsessed with Dumbo. I think it has a great amount of humor, love, friendship, overcoming obstacles and magic. We like that there is no specific ""villain"" and no mushy romance. We love the songs. We love sweet little Dumbo, who doesn't say a word the entire movie, but exudes emotion and bravery. The only reason I drop it from 5 stars (my son would give it 5!), is because A) This movie was made in 1941. There are a few representations of African-Americans that are outdated. To a child, these things are not the slightest bit noticeable. They are some singing workmen building a circus tent at night, and they are some fun, singing crows that encourage Dumbo's great flight.. As an adult, I can't help but feel a little conflicted. I tend to think they, like many movies of the time, are representations that attempt to keep the movie hip and current with a younger culture. B) This movie is sad! Dumbo is mocked and bullied and loses his mother, who only tried to defend him. But their love never wanes and they are reunited, triumphantly, at the end. C). Some might not like the trippy pink elephants scene. I happen to like this drunken hallucination, and so does my son.",1463961600,2,1196,4.516129032258065

295591,4,6300274195,"The 70th anniversary edition is the one buy. The DVD and Bluray ones for this edition have the same content, just different packaging. However, I do find that Disney tends to lack special features even in their special editions and tend to sell them at a higher price than other production companies such as Warner Bros. Since Dumbo came out such a long time ago, this one in particular is quite lacking in content. The digital restoration is quite nice though for those of you who have seen the non-restored version before. If you can secure a good price (<$15) I'd say go for it.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Walt Disney's animated motion picture DUMBO is 64 wonderful minutes of a baby elephant with gigantic ears that discovers his place in the world. It is a small, intimate, emotionally powerful mother-son tale with terrific songs and characters and outstanding animation, in other words, perfect family entertainment.

Released in New York in October, 1941 in Los Angeles, it premiered days after Japan attacked America. The brightly coloured circus picture is irrepressibly happy, even as it depicts an abnormal child's tale of woe. Opening with storks delivering new-borns in sacks to their circus animal mothers, expectant elephant Mrs. Jumbo looks up in anticipation of her special delivery. When the little fella finally arrives, the other elephants confer the cruel nickname.

Along comes Timothy, a sprightly, city mouse who'd rather pal around with Dumbo than with a bunch of catty old show hacks. With a good sense of justice and showmanship, Timothy sets about convincing Dumbo that his handicap doesn't have to ruin his life and that what can't be changed can be cast to Dumbo's own personal interest. Watching his plans unfold is a pleasure.

Dumbo, whose mother is branded mad when she comes to his defence, is assigned to perform with the clowns and a nasty, cynical lot they are to and, like most early Disney pictures, Dumbo is embedded with clearly drawn, multi-layered characters. The clowns are oppressive, not funny; a bully with big ears acts out against sweet Dumbo; black crows are hip but they are also kind.

It's a wonderful stunning timeless, seamless delightful story about being totally different. Highlights include Casey Junior's musical choo-choo train chugging the circus out of winter hibernation in Florida, Dumbo visiting his mother in solitary confinement, as Mrs. Jumbo sings ""Baby Mine"" and, of course, the hallucinatory ""Pink Elephants on Parade,"" which remains one of the best animated sequences in history.

Dumbo works primarily as a bonding fable, though he conquers his fears and eventually stops letting pain dominate his childhood and he does so by choice. Only then does Dumbo, deeply loved by his mother, encouraged by his friend, glide to his highest potential and he hits back at his tormentors before it's over. Cleverly mocking Hollywood especially with Timothy the capitalist rightly cashing in. Dumbo showers his mother with kisses in an ending that brilliantly integrates the story's theme that one's happiness is made not predetermined.

Although it was directed by Ben Sharpsteen, every frame of this Walt Disney tale about the outcast elephant with huge ears was personally approved by Uncle Walt himself. On the animation side, the highlight is the parade of pink elephants after Dumbo and Timothy Mouse get tipsy. Made for a fraction of the cost of previous Disney animations, this may be one of the studio's shortest features, but it's also among the best. So don't miss this beautiful magical festive family Walt Disney Animation film treasure.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The films original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.33:1 is preserved, as is the RKO title card for those who are interested, in this stunning 1080p encoded image transfer. Comparing this to the first DVD release is like a night and day difference. Contrast is much more solid, and it doesnt cause a hazy coloured mist to fall over the image as before, colours are truer and more richly delivered without ever going too bright, and sharpness is much better overall. Though there is no obvious banding in those blue skies, there seemed to be just a trace of it late in the film, and some anomalies in the water colouring can occasionally be glimpsed showing how truly sharp and clear the image is.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The Blu-ray disc offers an awesome 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound mix and from original elements along with a Restored 2.0 Original Audio Soundtrack Mono mix for those who wish a historical audio track experience, plus 5.1 Disney Enhanced High Definition Theatre Mix Sound. The 7.1 mix has not been tricked out with extraneous obviousness. Music occasionally finds its way into the fronts and rears, and the several thunderstorms that happen during the movie provide the most obvious use of the rear channels for the rain and thunder effects. Overall, the audio track has a monaural presence despite the reworked sound, and it fits the unpretentious film just fine that way. No age-related artefacts like hiss or crackle are anywhere to be heard.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

DVD Feature Film + Bonus

All-New Digital Restoration

Special Feature: DisneyView Presentation [Expanded Viewing Experience]: DisneyView allows users to expand their viewing experience beyond the 1.33:1 original aspect ratio of the film by filling the otherwise dark edges of the screen with beautiful custom paintings by James Coleman, so you get the full 1.77:1 aspect ratio presentation.

Special Feature: About DisneyView Presentation with James Coleman [2011] [1080p] [1.77:1] [00:53] The special brand of Disney magic has inspired the lives of many who have fallen under its spell. For artist James Coleman, it began when he started working in the Studios mailroom in the summer of 1969. His big break came when he entered one of his paintings in a studio art show. Several of the Disney Artists saw his potential and encouraged him to go into animation background painting. As the Background Department Supervisor, James Coleman was a strong creative influence in developing the look of over thirty shorts and twelve animated feature films. But with this delightful presentation, you actually see James Coleman in a small rectangle video screen at the top right of your TV screen, where he gives a very insightful talk about his time at the Walt Disney Studio. He also tells us that he worked on DUMBO and it is one of his most favourite Disney Animation film. This is a must view extra.

Special Feature: Cine-Explore Experience [2011] [1080p] [1.77:1] Here you get to view the whole of DUMBO again, what you get to view while the animation film is in progress, is lots of rectangle images dotted about the screen, where you get lots of extra information about the animation film DUMBO and the workings of the Walt Disney Studio in producing all of their animation work. But what is most interesting and fascinating aspect of this presentation is what you get to see with the main rectangle panel at the top right of your TV screen, is that you get to see and hear in a special viewing room Pete Docter [Director], Paula Sigman [ Disney Historian] and Andreas Deja [Animator]. We also get to see lots of rare image drawings relating to DUMBO as well as Ward Kimball talk about his work on the animation film and also informs us that they were also working on BAMBI at the same time. Another interesting aspect of this presentation, is that we get to see and hear Woolie Reithermann and his hard work and dedication on DUMBO, plus we also get to see and hear other rare fascinating characters who helped to make DUMBO the success it became. But we finally get to hear how DUMBO came about and it was through Helen Aberson and Harold Pearls delightful little book entitled DUMBO: The Flying Elephant that Walt Disney really loved and brought the rights to the novel. But this is definitely a MUST view, as it is a fascinating introduction into the beautiful magical experience of the classic animation film DUMBO and how it all evolved. But one word of warning, if you can only view this particular extra via the DVD disc, you do not get to view all the extra rectangle images popping up on your TV screen, but all you get is the audio commentary in the background.

Special Feature: Never-Before-Seen Deleted Scene: The Mouses Tale [1080p] [1.77:1] [5:35] Here we get an introduction by Don Haan, at the Disney Animation research Library, where Don Haan goes into great detail on why this sequence was never used in DUMBO. But what you get to view, with the help of the original script, very detailed rare drawings and the original audio voice recording, which gives you a sort animation feature of this lost deleted sequence and especially how it would of looked if it had been included in DUMBO. Dan Haan at the end of the sequence informs us he is very puzzled why there is no information why Walt Disney decided not to include it is DUMBO.

Special Feature: Never-Before-Heard Deleted Song: Are You A Man Or A Mouse [480i] [1.33:1] [3:53] Here also you get to see part of  the animation sequence, like if it was included in the animation film DUMBO, where the baby elephant is at the top of the burning building in the circus tent. But the rest of the sequence is provided by rare beautiful drawings and the voice of Timothy the mouse, telling Dumbo not to give up hope and always smile in the face of adversity. But can see why Walt Disney felt it would hinder the flow of the animation film.

Backstage Disney Features:

Special Feature Documentary: Taking Flight: The Making of Dumbo [1080p] [1.77:1] [28:08] This is a totally fascinating documentary into the history of DUMBO and how it became the classic animation it is today. We get to see and hear from people like Eric Goldberg [Walt Disney Supervising Animator]; Jim Capobianco [PIXAR Animation Studios]; Jonas Rivera [Producer for UP PIXAR Animation Studios]; John Canemaker [Animation Historian]; Paul F. Anderson [Author and Disney Historian]; Didier Ghez [Disney Historian]; Carol Grubb [Daughter of Joe Grant]; Richard P. Huemer [Son of Dick Huemer] and Michael Sporn [Animation Director]. With all of these contributors for this fascinating documentary, you get to hear all about the talented artists and musical directors who poured so much energy and talent into producing DUMBO and making it such a financial success. This is also a must view extra and not to be missed.

Special Feature: The Magic Of DUMBO: A Ride Of Passage [A Heartfelt Look At Disneyland's Most Popular Ride] [1080p] [1.77:1] [3:08] This is definite Disney Promotion on how people love the Dumbo Ride and how its appearance has changed over the years in operation notes from the likes of Imagineering Senior VP Tony Baxter. To me it is a bit too over the top in your face promotion and seeing all the ghastly over the top spoilt children, who are equally over the top gushing about the ride. Not one of my most favourite parts included in the extras.

Classic DVD Bonus Features:

Special Feature: Sound Design Excerpt from The Reluctant Dragon [1941] [480i] [1.33:1] [5:56] A five-minute and 56 second clip that actually comes from a minor 1941 feature called The Reluctant Dragon. The premise of the film showed writer Robert Benchley as he toured the Disney studios. With this very rare insight into how they go about making all the sound effects for a Walt Disney Animation Cartoon. It is a fascinating rare archive film, with such amazing use of different items to make the sound effects and also the orchestration. This is a very unusual picture quality, as the print is totally in sepia, and is a totally MUST view.

Special Feature: Celebrating DUMBO [480i] [1.33:1] [1:04] Here we get a collection of contributors that includes Leonard Malting; Andreas Deja; Don Haan; Ron Clements; Roy E. Disney; Rudy Behlmer; Lisa Keene; John Canemaker; Mike Gabrial; John Musker and Christy Maltese. But the outcome from all these people is how they love the DUMBO animation film and give intimate detail of why it is top of their list.

Special Feature: Original Walt Disney TV Introduction [1950] [480i] [black-and-white] [1.33:1] [1:04] This is a Walt Disneys Disneyland Special on the promotion of the animation film DUMBO. Here we get to see and hear Walt Disney giving great praise about their all-time favourite animation film. But what is a total shame, is why they couldn't have allowed us to see the whole of this TV Special, very strange.

Theatrical Trailers: Original Theatrical Trailer [1941] [480i] [1.33:1] [2:10]. Theatrical Re-Release Trailer [1949] [480i] [1.33:1] [1:16]

Bonus Shorts Feature:

Special Feature: Walt Disneys Silly Symphony Cartoon: Elmer Elephant [1936] [1080p] [1.33:1] [8:30] This Silly Symphony Cartoon short tells the story of a timid elephant named Elmer. In this story, he is invited to Tillie Tiger's birthday party, bringing her a bouquet of flowers. Tillie loves Elmer, but the other animal kids make fun of his nose (trunk) and cruelly mock him when Tillie isn't around to defend him. Broken-hearted by their teasing, Elmer leaves the party and cries in front of the nearby pond. Elmer is reassured by a nearby elderly giraffe named Joe who admits to him that he used to suffer the same teasing about his neck. Just then, a fire breaks out at Tillie's tree-house with Tillie still in it. The rescue efforts by the other children as well as a monkey fire brigade prove futile. With the help of Joe Giraffe and some pelicans that resemble Jimmy Durante, Elmer successfully puts out the fire and rescues Tillie. Voices by Bernice Hansen and Directed by Wilfred Jackson.

Special Feature: Walt Disneys Silly Symphony Cartoon: The Flying Mouse [1934] [1080p] [1.33:1] [9:19] This Silly Symphony Cartoon short tells the story of a young mouse fashions wings from a pair of leaves, to the tune ""I Would Like to Be a Bird."" To the great amusement of his brothers. When his attempts to use them fail, he falls into the tub and shrinks his sister's dress and gets spanked by his  mother. When a butterfly calls for help, he rescues it from a spider. When the butterfly proves to be a fairy, the mouse wishes for wings. But his bat-like appearance doesn't fit in with either the birds or the other mice, and he finds himself friendless; even the bats make fun of him, making a point that he is ""Nothin' But A Nothin'"" and the butterfly fairy reappears and removes the mouse's wings, telling him that it is best for him to be himself. Directed by David Hand and Music by Bert Lewis and Frank Churchill.

Finally, with the Blu-ray release of DUMBO, Disney's animated feature is at long last available in gorgeous high definition. And while the film is only 64 minutes long, it has just as much heart and spirit that we have come to expect with this truly magic Walt Disney animation film extravaganza. The Blu-ray disc itself functions, looks, and sounds exactly the same, with only the tiniest of differences in the language options. Fans of this animation film shouldn't hesitate to make a purchase, especially at the price with this. I can still earnestly recommend this Title, as it is a brilliant solid job, and is definitely one of Disney's most amazing Blu-ray discs. Very Highly Recommended!

295979,5,6300274195,"Disney's 4th Animated film gets a really nice treatment for its 70th Anniversary Blu Ray and it's the first BLU RAY release that enabled me to sell my previous DVD edition.

One of Disney's sweetest films, Dumbo looks and sounds better than ever here on Blu Ray. Dumbo has a simple story, but it's also one of Disney's more unique animated films. It's filled with eye poping animation, the circus scenes are loud, colorful and make you feel like your under the Big top, scenes of Dumbo and his mother are handled touchingly and thank you Disney for not deeming it necessary to edit this film. A drunken mouse and baby elephant have a trippy dream, it's one of my favorite scenes in any Dinsey film.

Disney's first 5 films all hold a place in the best animated films of all time, not that I'm saying that their later films such as Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Beauty and the Beast don't hold spots there too, but the first 5 films have a certain quality to them that has never been surpassed by the studio.

This is a short film running a little over an hour, so a wealth of extras would have been appreciated. The bonus features that are here a very good and for once nothing worth mentioning has been left out from previous editions.(THANK YOU AGAIN!!)

Dumbo, may not have the complexity of the other four cornerstone films of Disney, but it still a beautifully animated classic. If you must own Dumbo, the 70th Anniversary edition Blu Ray is by far and away the best release to date.",1423699200,,1490,4.507407407407407

The ""funny"" crows I remembered as a child are caricatures of blacks and I found it racist.  My granddaughter is bi-racial and what seemed innocent enough to me as a child was not funny at all as a grownup who has become much more aware of the terrible treatment our country has given blacks in its history.  In addition to that, I found the drinking scene completely inappropriate for a child's movie.  I've seen far too much alcohol abuse and the break-up of homes and domestic and child abuse related to being drunk (which happens in this case) to think it's amusing to have such a scene portrayed in a child's animated movie.  This one did not get passed on and I learned a valuable lesson: what we remember from our childhood as pleasant and acceptable may not be so at all in light of later maturity.  I will have to stick with my very old golden book of the Dumbo story, which bypasses the offensive content.",1423267200,,1067,4.469072164948454

296041,5,6300274195,"First things first. I have seen the 2001 60th Anniversary Edition and the 2011 70th Anniversary edition. I can say with all honesty that the 2011 version is so much crisper and clearer, and it's the same amount of minutes as the 2001 edition, which is grainy and dull in parts. The person who gave a bad review is referring to the ""Big Top Edition"", not the 2011 edition, and should not have posted their critical review here.

As for the movie: This tale is about the baby elephant Dumbo, who was born with oversized ears and is an outcast at the circus because of them. After his mother is shipped off unfairly for defending him against some cruel human kids, he goes through some tough times, but fortunately he is befriended by a mouse who, with the help of a few crows, helps him to learn to use his ears to great advantage. He even has a happy reunion with his mother at the end.

Song sequences such as ""Song of the Roustabouts"" and ""When I See An Elephant Fly"" are perceived by some to be ""racist"" when in fact they are not. Listen to the lyrics and pay careful attention to the characters before believing such nonsense. This is a great film and Dumbo is a very lovable character; I have so much love for elephants and much sympathy for circus elephants now that I've seen this. I must say, this film is a very sad one, but the happy ending more than makes up for it. Worth seeing again and again.",1421625600,,1406,4.321969696969697

296170,5,6300274195,"This film was made solely to help recoup the financial losses incurred with Fantasia.  It is one of the shortest animated features the Disney studio ever made (brief at 64 minutes).  During the making of this film the Disney staff went on strike when Disney refused to sign with a union led by Herbert Sorrell (Disney had already signed with a union, the IATSE, and felt that signing with another union dealing with the same thing was redundant).  Some of the strikers are depicted as clowns in this film during the ""hit the big boss for a raise"" sequence.  The strike lasted five weeks and ended the family atmosphere and camaraderie normally in play at the studio.  Dumbo became the studios' biggest financial success during the 1940s and was subsequently released in theaters four more times.  The film won one Oscar for best scoring of a Musical Picture.  For reasons that make absolutely no sense whatsoever, Dumbo is supposedly being remade as a live-action film.

This is one of my favorite Disney films (cartoon or otherwise).  It's also one of the few films ever to deal with bullies to a positive conclusion.  I rarely make it through ""Baby Mine"" without bawling.  The amount of sentiment this film engenders is overwhelming.",1417132800,3,1235,4.833333333333333

296237,3,6300274195,"I didn't remember this from youth, but in re-watching it with my kids I recalled the bizarre parts of the story.  There is a strange, hallucinogenic sequence in the middle that is just weird.  Dumbo drinks some beer and the film goes into a dancing elephants bit that is just .... odd.  Then the plot returns with Dumbo up in a tree, with no idea how he got there.  The moral of the story, ""just get drunk and you will uncover your magical flying powers"".  Yeah, not a great message.  In general, I felt the themes were dated and there wasn't a very cohesive and touching story line.  Don't buy this.  Spend your money on other, great movies that are available out there.  If you want ideas for girls, in particular, try ""Mighty Girl"" as a great resource.  Its a website and a Facebook thing.",1414281600,,792,4.4

296337,5,6300274195,"This timeless, animated, Walt Disney, DVD Classic - DUMBO, is an 'absolute must' for any cartoon film collector. Mr. & Mrs. DUMBO are first-time expectant parents of their darling, soon-to-be-born, baby elephant, son. Little DUMBO as he will be called, will be the newest addition to the elephants that perform within the travelling circus that they star in. When born, he will be trained and seen as their newest, little star within the herd. Oh, look! How wonderful! That's Mr. Stork and he's got several baby bundles to deliver and he's coming our way. All the expectant animal mama's-to-be who were also within the circus, eagerly await to receive their extra-special delivery ""bundles of joy!"" And, after Mr. Stork delivered all of his packages and having received their much anticipated, respective newborns, Mrs. DUMBO realized that she was the only one left, without hers. But wait..., here comes Mr. Stork yet again, this time with a rather large package, a big, special-delivery to be sure, especially for the Queen of the Elephant Herd: Mrs. DUMBO, herself! It's heavy but here you go! Ahhh..., at last!! Precious, darling DUMBO has finally arrived. And oh, look how cute he is! Darling DUMBO to be sure. But wait..., what's this?! Look at his ears. Their long and droopy and almost bigger than he is. Oh, no, no, no..., NO! We cannot have an elephant in our heard that looks like, that! And, out on the stage, too? Absolutely out of the question regardless of who his parents are or who he belongs, too. Upon hearing this, Mrs. DUMBO while trying to protect her newborn baby, was thought incorrectly to be mad. And was promptly placed and chained into isolation. DUMBO was left all alone and Mrs. DUMBO was beside herself with loneliness, grief and loss. This endearing Walt Disney initial tear-jerker turned to joy, is a wonderful family movie depicting faulty, perceived appearances, unwarranted incarceration, improper labels of another's (even an animal's mental and emotional status), restitution, restoration and all around, healing. And a family reunion between a mother and her true, rightful baby. Regardless of what the ears, look like. This big-screen, colorful, cartoon classic is a true delight in animated story-telling. It brings back warm and fond memories of seeing it when I too, was a child. It's a Disney animation, triumph! You'll love it..., as will your children. A definite keeper :) !!

296387,5,6300274195,"Classic Disney animation.  This was made in an era where the message about the treatment of those who are different was a part of the plot rather than a bludgeon driven by the socially aware crowd.  The movie is entertaining for young and old alike and is an example of the best of classic Disney animation.  The fun of introducing this classic to our grandchildren turned to magic when they jumped up and cheered the first flight of Dumbo.  Entertainment was the primary reason for producing this piece and it shows.
An interesting debate seems to have developed over the musical number involving the crows.  Those who object to this probably never heard Cab Calloway and others of that era.  That Disney chose to use crows reflects the moment in history rather than some insidious plot.  Interestingly, the crows provide some  of the important wisdom that helps Dumbo triumph in the end.  This seems to point out the notion that sometimes the most intelligent response comes from your fellow disenfranchised.
It is important to remember, however, that the strength of Dumbo lies in it's entertainment value, and on that basis, it is recommended (as some like to say) for children of all ages.",1405382400,2,1194,4.842364532019705

296419,5,6300274195,"Have you ever seen an elephant fly?
Dumbo has been around for a while and it's most likely you have watched it through different stages in your life.
The theme & story unquestionably transcends time.
This film came out in 1941 & remains an animated classic.
Dumbo set the tone for successful disney features.
It goes way back and was the the fourth animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series.

The story of Dumbo is awesome and inspiring.
The film teaches a valuable lesson about life in a creative way.
The lesson is charming and valuable.

Dumbo opens with a troop of storks dropping off fresh babies to the proud circus animal parents.
One of the babies is an elephant. This particular baby has huge and unusually shaped ears.
At first, this baby is completely misunderstood because of his unique features.
Luckily, Dumbo befriends a positive circus mouse that helps him form a newfound perspective.
With help from his friend and a cast of unique characters, Dumbo is able to turn his setbacks into
talents. He discovers that his huge ears enable him to fly and he becomes the great flying elephant.
Ultimately, Dumbo becomes a star.

This is a nice old fashion family movie for everyone.
Its holds up and will make you feel good.
The entertainment and moral value is strong.

One is Dumbo because he's a cute baby elephant, Timothy q. Mouse because he is a mouse AND a caring character, always there for Dumbo.  The third is the Casey Junior song. I loved that song, especially on the Zip a dee doo da sing a long video. And fourth is the Pink Elephant scene.

296642,5,6300274195,"Disney's 4th Animated film gets a really nice treatment for its 70th Anniversary Blu Ray and it's the first release that enabled me to sell the previous edition.

One of Disney's sweetest films, Dumbo looks and sounds better than ever here on Blu Ray. Dumbo has a simple story, but it's also one of Disney's more unique animated films. It's filled with eye poping animation, the circus scenes are loud and proud, scenes of Dumbo and his mother are handled touchingly and thank you Disney for not deeming it necessary to edit this film. A drunken mouse and baby elephant have a trippy dream, it's one of my favorite scenes in any Dinsey film.

Disney's first 5 films all hold a place in the best animated films of all time, not that I'm saying that later releases such as Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Beauty and the Beast don't hold spots there too, but the first 5 have a certain quality to them that has never been surpassed by the studio.

It is indeed a very sad movie, it was so sad to see Dumbo being teased by basically every character in this movie. He is just too cute. The movie being too depressing is definitely not a reason to not watch it though! It's one of Disney's shortest films, being only a little more than an hour, but it packs so much heart into it.

It's so mean! and such classic racism and prejudice. The story... for disney... is sort of lackluster. Very short running time very little going on, and lots of elaboration and length on scenes that don't really have a purpose. Got very uninterested in all the odd/unfunny circus performances. I was like ""ok... moving along now. we get it... he's a cheap circus act... now let's get back to the story.make this more dramatic or cut it shorter..."" It had the potential to be a great film that tugs at your heartstrings and has a little historical background... but instead it sort of makes you mad and bitter that they depict black ppl as scrappy birds and faceless, characterless workers, and that ppl are so cruel. I don't want some sappy sweet film, but it could have been done better. Maybe this was how it was at the time, didn't really check the year it was made... but I was a little peeved. Anyways.. good seller. It's in good conditioner and came on time.

On a nerdier note... I didn't really understand the relevance or the significance of him having big ears being an issue... or a possibility. The adults were indian elephants... clearly he was an african elephant, which are more notorious and prestigious due to ears in the first place. I digress.

Above all else, it is the story of a young child (elephant) who overcomes being bullied by using his ""flaw"" to catapult himself to success.  The other issue covered in this movie is alcohol use. **SPOILER**  Dumbo finds out he can fly after getting drunk and waking up in a tree.  If you want a movie to just press play and leave your child alone for a while, this is probably not the best choice, but then again, most Disney classics are not good choices for this purpose.  This is, however, a movie that the entire family can enjoy together in an atmosphere where discussion of what happens in the movie flows freely.

When each of my children were little babies I would sing the baby mine song from the movie and now my two year old is very enchated with Dumbo and LOVES the baby mine scene when ever it plays she gets me to hold her like Dumbo's mommy does for dumbo and sing right along with it.

297191,3,6300274195,"The classic Dumbo is a short movie about a cute little elephant who has self-image issues because of his big ears.  It's a good lesson for kids everywhere - take what other people see as something bad about you and turn it into something positive.

There's lots of animals in the animated movie, and we are introduced to most of them at the beginning of the movie.  Storks are seen delivering babies everywhere - keeping with the old time explanation of ""where do babies come from?""  Other animals seen are bears, kangaroos, fish, tigers, giraffes, elephants, birds, monkeys, foxes, ostriches, snakes, horses, camels, zebras, hippos, gorillas, and even a mouse.

Objects are person-fied in this movie.  such as the train that talks.  Animals are more like people then animals.  The cut mouse who gives Dumbo his confidence, Mrs. Jumbo and her annoyingly rude companions, Mr. Stork.

Commedy is written in a way that is funny for the adults as well as the children.  I love when the stork is sitting on the cloud (every child imagines sitting on a cloud) and looking down on the earth at a map of the United States.  The stork is constantly having to retrieve Dumbo as he sinks through the cloud.

My favorite song is ""When I See an Elephant Fly.""

Some negative elements:  there is alcohol in this movie.  We can see men drinking it, then later water is tainted with alcohol and the mouse and Dumbo are drunk.  They have a wild vision...",1351036800,,1437,4.665338645418327
297192,3,6300274195,"I loved Dumbo as a child. I saw ""over-coming"" handicaps, dealing with teasing, motherly support, all positive things. My DIL is African American and she and my son have watched every movie I've given to their daughters before the girls can watch them. They are not allowed to watch Dumbo because it is blatantly racist, something someone with my white skin would not even notice. I've now watched it for my own education and still think the message is worth it. The kids agree, despite it also being ""fat-ist"" and a few other ""isms"" we didn't even notice when I was a child (60 years ago), and they will watch it with their girls when they are older and talk to them about what concerns them.

I understand the concerns of my bi-racial family, but I'm glad they are open-minded enough to share this story with their children when they are older and can understand why they held back on this one (all the black men pounding in the stakes and the white men and women being stars, for example), as I feel the message of over-coming difficulties is an important one.",1348272000,,1062,4.53125

297199,5,6300274195,"""Dumbo"" is one of the great old Disney animation classics about a woeful little circus elephant born with abnormally big ears, who initially becomes the butt of many cruel jokes and treatment by the other circus animals.  Great animation, simple story, minimum of dialogue to bring the plot forward, and some really well crafted sequences with songs like: ""Elephants On Parade"" (a very surreal seq. for a Disney film), and  ""When I See's An Elephant Fly"" (wonderful song and seq. where wisecracking crows become father figures for the fatherless little elephant, and push Dumbo to finally discover that his big ears are actually a prime asset, allowing him to fly like a bird).  These and other choice sequences make this little film (only 64 mins. long) a memorable cinema treasure for children and adults alike.

Also containing some DVD extras, included is a historically interesting and nicely delivered separate audio track on the whole film, talking about the various artists who made it, as well as the actors (all uncredited) who supplied the dialogue voicing.

297200,5,6300274195,"Here is a review about the Dumbo 1991 VHS. A Key to spot this is the 1991 VHS and not the 1989 VHS is to look at the ISBN Codes at the back. If one has the ISBN Code on the back in the Bottom-Left corner, your getting the 1989 VHS. If one has the ISBN Code at the Top-Right, you are getting the 1991 VHS.

This tape does have it's Pluses, and does have it's Downfalls.

Starting with the good stuff, is that what you get, is amazing quality. For the time period being, A Few Disney films were released with the ""Buena Vista"" logo at the beginning of the film. Before Buena Vista stamped their logo on lots of Disney films, they were under the RKO Logo. Starting from Which i believe is 1994 or somewhere in the late 90's, Walt Disney Home Video started to release the films with their original RKO Bumper at the beginning, making the Buena Vista versions a bit rare. From 1981-1991, Dumbo was released on VHS, BETA, CED Disc, and Laserdisc all with the Buena Vista logo at the beginning. So the 1991 VHS (IS) one of those Buena Vista Releases. This is the last time the Dumbo Buena Vista fanfare was ever seen on VHS. Considering this is the last release with the fanfare, the quality on this version is FANTASTIC. It has been restored (which i would say is not the best restoration like on the Blu Ray and 60th Anniversary DVD,) but it is still very good restoration for it's time period, considering the early ""Neon Mickey 1981-1985"" releases would have some part of the original 16mm or 35mm (cant really tell or know) film spots and grains from back when it was on the big screen. I would highly recommend converting this to DVD, so you might as well have 2 copies of the film.

Now going on to the Negatives.

This is a bit dumb that this is a complaint, but it's true. This tape opens with:

1. 1984 FBI Warnings
2. 1989 Walt Disney Classics logo
3. Buena Vista logo
4. Film

I think they could have placed a commercial or some sort of trailer on this release for upcoming releases (or just like on the Peter Pan 1990 VHS, they have one Theatrical Trailer for ""The Rescuers Down Under""). I think they could have squeezed the Beauty & The Beast Trailer (as seen on The Jungle Book 1991 VHS) somewhere, whether it was before or after the movie.

Overall, i'd give this release a 9.5/10 . The Restoration on this was fantastic, especially for the time period it was done. The Cover artwork looks amazing as well. The only thing that just didn't make it to 10/10 for me is the lack of previews. And i think Dumbo is a wonderful film i'd suggest anybody to check out. But this Particular VHS Release deserves in it's own respect a 9.5/10 .",1339804800,,2640,4.310483870967742

The picture was so crystal-clear, I literally noticed the grainy texture on the backgrounds and cels in various shots. Also, the new 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix had literally blown me away. For instance, between the opening narration and the song ""Look Out for Mr. Stork,"" the airplane sound effect had literally caused the floor to vibrate, as it came from the rear speakers and the subwoofer. The Blu-ray also comes with the restored original mono mix, so I can watch the film on my Blu-ray player in my bedroom, and the mono mix is also for those who are purists. I also enjoyed the DisneyView presentation of Dumbo, because of the beautiful artwork replacing the black bars. I remember watching the 1950's Buena Vista reissue of Dumbo on VHS when I was a kid, and now I noticed that the original RKO Radio Pictures title sequences have been restored for the new Blu-ray release.

It's hardly better than the original. They did what they could and it looks great, but it has the same quality as DVD. Still, the price is the same for both Bluray and DVD.",1331424000,,472,4.5
297302,5,6300274195,"I had loved Dumbo as a child and had not seen it for many years, so I got the special edition DVD. The special features on this edition are marvelous, with so many people expressing their sentiments about the movie and what it was meant to be and how much Walt loved it and what an important movie it was for the studio. There's also some deleted scenes including Timothy the mouse singing. The commentary is by 3 people who currently work for the Disney studios and they had a lot of things to say. Apparently Dumbo is a very special movie to many people. The movie is an extraordinarily simple story about the imbecilic reasons snobby people invent to hate someone or disregard someone or look down on someone--a guy has big ears that nobody else around him has and that makes them think he's worthless. His ears are not hurting anybody, they just look unusual. The reason they hate him is nothing but the fact that he's DIFFERENT from them in that one little way, in one aspect of his physical appearance. He has a physical trait that noone else around him has and that makes them act like he's a disgrace to them. I am really appalled at the little reasons that people use to hate others. And Dumbo's mother is punished for defending her son, for punishing a mean bully who was hurting her son, and she's classed as dangerous and chained as if she's evil. I too have been punished for violence when I was defending innocent ones against bully's meanness.  Noone in the movie cared that she had a reason for what she did.
Dumbo is about judgement and intolerance and oppression and unfair discrimination. From what I've seen, most of the time in real life victims of unfair societal views do not end up triumphing over the oppression the way Dumbo does in the movie. But I guess the movie is a message of hope that maybe we can hope to change some of the unfair things about the way society works, so that innocent people like Dumbo and his mother can have freedom. I don't know if the movie Dumbo can make the world a better place--there are a lot of hypocrites who love the movie Dumbo, they love the movie and spend money on it to buy it but they themselves are treating people and animals in rude unfair ways, so they love the movie but they themselves are cruel and bitter and judgemental and so they obviously have no regard for the messages of love and understanding in the movie--but I agree with the people on the DVD that it is one of the most beautiful movies ever made. I wish the movie Dumbo could have an effect on the way people are treated in society. There are so many people living in imposed situations that are not fair, but I guess when life is not fair they have to just go on living while the unfair situation is going on, and that's another message in the movie--Timothy tells Dumbo to go on living even before they learn that there's a way Dumbo can have victory over the situation. Before they ever knew that Dumbo could fly, they were already going to just continue living. I wish this movie could help spread goodness in the world.

I was in Chicago, and Dumbo hits their jive talk perfectly. I can not see why this would be a racial slur. If you're going to censor this, you might as well censor the drunk clowns as well, because it means that all white people drink and wear clown make-up. Then we're left with a perfectly sanitized 10 min PC cartoon that makes no sense. This censoring of actual cultural behavior is going too far.

The movie is short and sweet.  I really thought the dream sequence went on too long - or maybe just dated - due to color animation being in its infancy.

Many stereotypical characters that in today's society would never fly, does very little IMHO to detract from this Disney classic.  I watched it with my 5 year old and she is too young to pick up on them.

297379,5,6300274195,"It was 1941 and with Disney having its first successful animated film with ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" back in 1938, unfortunately its next two films ""Pinocchio"" and ""Fantasia"" would not be the big box office hits that Disney had wanted.  And partly that was because of World War II, as Disney would not be able to recoup through international screenings.

In fact, the two films hurt Disney financially and now with the studio hurting, their fourth feature ""Dumbo"" was created with the idea of keep things economical with a tight budget and because of that, they had to focus on simplicity.  And that meant creating an animated film that is just a little over one-hour long.

The animated film is based on a children's story by Helen Aberson and was illustrated by Harold Pearl and was featured as a ""Roll-A-Book"".  In 1939, Disney's head of merchandise licensing brought the Roll-A-Book to Walt Disney's attention and sure enough, Disney gave the greenlight for an animated short.  But because they were hurting financially, ""Dumbo"" was selected to help generate income and Disney relied on his storytellers, Dick Huemer and Joe Grant to being working on the plot of the film.

So, following the rules of a strict budget and simplistic features, ""Dumbo"" was not a film that would feature the same production level as the first three films. No emphasis on character design, backgrounds were not as detailed  and utilized water colors and the film would feature less cells.  It's also one of the first Disney animated films where there is no cast list for its voice talent.

""Dumbo"" was released by distributor RKO Radio Pictures in 1941 and at first because of its short length, it did cause a brief riff between both Disney and RKO Productions but in the end, Disney won and the film was released during World War II and it was a financial success.  The film which cost around $813,000 to make (much cheaper than the previous three films) grossed $1.6 million in the box office and  would win an Academy Award for Original Musical Score and would receive re-releases in 1949, 1959, 1972 and 1976.  ""Dumbo"" was also well-received by film critics.

Since its release, ""Dumbo"" has been considered a timeless Disney classic and will now be released in a 70th Anniversary Edition via Blu-ray and DVD release on Sept. 20th and will feature more special features compared to its 50th Anniversary and 60th Anniversary counterparts and also will feature restoration to bring the film to an audience wanting to watch this film in HD.

VIDEO:

With the success of ""Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs"", ""Pinocchio"" and ""Fantasia"" on Blu-ray and seeing how Disney went all out in the restoration and look of the film, needless to say, I had the highest expectations for ""Dumbo"".

Presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1), let's just say that Disney once again, has done fans a great service by giving us one awesome restoration.

And I know... many of us own multiple copies of ""Dumbo"" on DVD but this is Blu-ray, it's intro. to Blu-ray and as a 70th Anniversary release, it blows away any of the previous ""Dumbo"" releases on video.

OK, sure...""Dumbo"" was created simplistic and with a lower budget than the previous three films but the overall character designs are crisp and the background still look beautiful and well-balanced.  Colors are vibrant and there are no signs of artifacts, banding, edge enhancement or DNR.  This was a straight-up restoration in which Disney restored each cel and are giving us the best presentation of the film yet!

""Dumbo"" looks absolutely fantastic on Blu-ray and yes, even the drunken Dumbo scene looks vibrant than ever before.  I don't want to use the word ""pristine"" but for Disney fans, ""Dumbo: 70th Anniversary"" looks fantastic!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

When I saw that Disney gave fans an all new English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio lossless soundtrack, I couldn't help but be happy about it!  The Blu-ray release also features the 2.0 English restored featured audio, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Enhanced Home Theater Mix (DEHT).

But the 7.1 lossless soundtrack is fantastic.  From the opening scene with the thunder cracking, the rain and wind...you hear the sounds all around you. Dialogue for the film is crystal clear, as with the original musical soundtrack, it sounds awesome via lossless.  Granted, the film as I mentioned in the picture quality, this was a film created on a budget, kept simplistic on purpose but still, it was great to see how the music utilized the surround channels and for the most part, this is the best soundtrack for ""Dumbo"" yet!

As for subtitles, ""Dumbo: 70th Anniversary"" is presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Dumbo"" is a Disney animated classic which my wife and I have purchased countless versions on VHS and DVD and it has been a favorite of ours.  Especially now that we have a son, it's a film that we can share with our child and now enjoy especially with this beautiful restoration that Disney had given to this film.

Beautiful and vibrant, when I first watched this film on Blu-ray, I couldn't help but see how clear everything looked.  But so far, Disney has not disappointed me because with the release of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Fantasia"", ""Bambi"" and several other films, Disney has really gone all out with these Blu-ray releases and also giving fans the best looking and sounding versions of these Disney animated classics yet.

""Dumbo"" is a touching story and I can remember as a child wondering if the fate of Dumbo's mother would be similar to Bambi's situation.  And then watching it again as a college student and wondering what was the motivation towards the drunken dream sequence.  But having watched this film for countless times during my near 30+ years, this animated film is timeless.  I never get bored of it and as mentioned, I have purchased nearly every video release of this film since it's 50th Anniversary and I can only wonder how Disney will outdo themselves when this film reaches its 100th Anniversary.

But still, this is the definitive version of ""Dumbo"" to own at this time.  And if I was asked if there was any faults of this release, it's not more of faults but for one, ""Dumbo"" is not as detailed as the previous three films because Disney was hurting financially at the time and the film was made on a budget and was made to be simplistic.  Not that it's a bad thing but for those who admire the first three films for its beautiful artwork, one has to understand that Disney had to make cost-cutting decisions for ""Dumbo"".

The other thing is that with the other three releases, Disney really went all out in special features.  Not to say that there aren't many in the 70th Anniversary release for ""Dumbo"" because there are a good number of special features including the really cool ""Cine-Explore Experience"" but in terms of what is featured in the first three releases on Blu-ray compared to what is included in ""Dumbo"", the other three definitely offered much more bonus content.

But of course, that is me being spoiled by the first three releases on Blu-ray and if I haven't watched those Blu-ray's, I would still feel the sheer number of new and older special features included in this release would be nothing short of  magnificent.

With that being said, ""Dumbo: 70th Anniversary"" is a fantastic, timeless Disney animated classic and because Disney really went all out in terms of look and sound, this Blu-ray release deserves to be watched and owned by fans of the film!

Highly recommended!",1323993600,2,10393,4.955491329479769
297440,5,6300274195,"***This review may contain spoilers**

The best creations of book, cinema, play, in my opinion, realistically and painstakingly portray the indomitablity and ultimate triumph of hope.  Disney's emotional classic ""Dumbo"" certainly qualifies.  It follows the progress of the ultimate underdog, an abandoned, ostracized baby elephant, as he gradually finds his lofty place in the world.  Yes, he has guidance and inspiration from an unlikely ally, Timothy J. Mouse, but at the climax, Dumbo must find it within himself to overcome his sadness and fear to literally soar.

Your heart aches for this cute pachyderm and the adversity he faces - pompous, sneering fellow circus elephants, cruel children, a bombastic ringmaster, callous circus clowns.  It seems that everybody in the world is against him, except his mother of course.  But then she is imprisoned for going on a rampage against the children taunting her baby, and Dumbo figuratively but practically becomes an orphan.  His last sliver of hope vanishes.  But the movie reassures us that even outcasts can take hope and comfort, usually from other outcasts.  Timothy J. Mouse, though the movie only implies this, is just such an outcast.  Who wants a mouse at a circus, or anywhere else?  Even elephants are allegedly afraid of them (is that actually true?)  But Dumbo and Tim hit it off.  Together, they even devise a plan to rocket Dumbo to the top - an elephant pyramid show Tim subliminally suggests to the snoring ringmaster.  Hope rises, but then plummets as Dumbo's ears cause the pyramid and circus to literally collapse.

As punishment, Dumbo is forced to be a clown in a humiliating and dangerous high-dive act.  The act is successful, but Dumbo is naturally despondent, for he knows he has hit bottom.  It takes Tim's arrangement of a visit to his chained mother, and one of the most poignant songs on Earth, ""Baby Mine"", to restore Dumbo's spirits a little.  Some spilled champagne from the celebrating clowns sends Dumbo's spirits really high and crush his inhibitions, so the next day he finds himself up a tree with some cackling crows.  But how?

Even natural crows are outcasts in a way.  They are noisy and eat carrion.  But these cartoon crows are caricatures of African-Americans.  But I don't think they are disparaging portrayals.  Instead, I think they are meant to portray the alienation many African-Americans still felt during the '40s.  Even so, they make fun of Dumbo as he topples from the tree.  Only when Tim tells the crows of Dumbo's hard knock life do the birds stop making fun of him, a fellow outcast.  How did Dumbo get up that tree?  The only explanation, bizarre as it is, is that he FLEW! Can he fly again? The crows offer a solution with a ""magic feather"".  Dumbo grasps the magic feather and grandly flies.  The high-diving act is gonna be different this time.

At the act's climax, Dumbo dives but loses the feather.  Hope plummets again.  But Tim yells at him that it isn't within the feather, it's witnin HIM to fly, all along.  Dumbo listens, and soars for real, and gets some relatively gentle but satisfying payback at his tormentors.  The circus has a new star, Tim hits the big time, and mother and son are reunited.  All within an hour.

""Dumbo"" is a fantasy that nevertheless grittingly earns its happy ending, and reassures that, whoever we are, and whatever our circumstances, with courage and hope, we can go up, too!

P.S.: Very minor error - Dumbo is shown drinking the alcohol-flavored water by sucking it through his trunk like a straw.  Actually, in real life, elephants suck up water through their trunk and spray it into their mouths.  As I said, a very minor error in this wonderful film.",1323907200,,3708,4.850079744816587

That said, outside of the Jumbos & Timothy Mouse, they're the *only* sympathetic characters in the piece. And they're damn witty to boot.

What struck me most this viewing in this age of bullying-awareness: Dumbo's salvation-via-flying takes up, at the very most, the last 10 minutes of the story. The rest is dark, dark, suicide-inviting despair & humiliation, with the nightmarish & brilliant ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" the only respite. Even that is a bad trip. Disney's effort to cut costs after the financial failures of PINOCCHIO and FANTASIA results in a clean, lean yet stylized look. I love the simple watercolor backgrounds & the silhouette renditions of the (expensive-to-animate) humans. Having Dumbo be mute also saved $$$ and was a correct artistic decision to boot: his silent cuteness works far better than the frequently cloying kids' voices in BAMBI. 8/10",1320364800,,1073,5.166666666666667

""Dumbo"" really looks magnificent in this 70th Anniversary restored version, especially with Blu-ray, but what really delights me is the presence of an excellent new audio commentary. The commentators is historian Paula Sigman, master animator Andreas Deja and Pixar director Pete Docter. There's even a little video about Dumbo in the Disney Parks.

The DVD is not missing the key bonus features, which is a nice thing for those who do not have Blu-ray, but there are a few extra games, galleries and cartoons exclusively on the Blu-ray.

297566,3,6300274195,"The quality of the restoration is excellent. Dumbo focuses around an African elephant baby mis-delivered by stork to an Indian elephant in a circus. Amazing that the ""politically correct"" Disney Studios, which refuses to re-release Song of the South because of Uncle Remus (who is portrayed as a happy black slave), released Dumbo with the ""black"" soulful crows. Obviously Dumbo represented q whole lot more money. Most of the background artists left things pretty much bland. Timothy Q. Mouse comes off repeatedly as larger than the elephants. As an animated feature, it has its place in the annals of cartoondom, but nothing that other works drew from. Neither are the two unrestored early Disney cartoons anything special, which lack the polish of the later Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse cartoons of the 1950's.

Also, for some reason, Disney animation writers have always had a misogynous hatred of mothers.

One of the reasons I wanted to explore Dumbo on Blu-ray was because I couldn't even remember the last time I saw it. I want to say it's been at least 17 years. To tell the truth, Dumbo may be even better now as an adult than it was growing up.

Our story begins with a traveling circus that is visited by a massive horde of storks. Nearly everybody around Mrs. Jumbo, an elephant, receives a bundle of joy except for her. That is until the following day where she gets her wish and Jumbo Jr becomes a part of her life, but nobody can look past his gigantic ears. The small elephant is mocked, laughed at, and given the nickname Dumbo. Dumbo becomes an outcast who is constantly picked on by everyone around him; human or animal. When his mother tries to stand up for him, she's put in solitary confinement and Dumbo is left to fend for himself. With Timothy Q. Mouse, his only friend, by his side, Dumbo learns that his giant ears are good for something other than being laughed at while taking on the likes of becoming a clown, facing off against pink elephants, and merely surviving the verbal onslaught of a group of smooth talking crows.

As a complete side note, I can't help but think the entire stork concept is a lot more believable when nothing in the animated world has anything close to resembling genitalia. For being 70 years old, Dumbo looks really fantastic. Dumbo wastes little time tapping into nostalgia that comes crashing over you as soon as you hear the first few notes of the soundtrack, which is a lot better than I remember it being. Every song is pretty flawless; the obvious favorites being Pink Elephants on Parade and When I See an Elephant Fly. The music seems to capture the essence of the 40s so well, which is probably mostly due to its harmony and barber shop-type sound it has.

As I was browsing Netflix to rate Dumbo, I noticed it was filed under ""Feel-Good,"" which I found kind of interesting. Dumbo does pretty much the exact opposite of making you feel good nearly its entire 63-minute duration. Dumbo gets separated from his mother, he gets made fun of, he messes up, he gets made fun of again, he gets drunk, he gets made fun of some more.  Even the other clowns make fun of him without even trying to. The scene with his mother rocking him with her trunk makes you want to bawl your eyes out. Dumbo has a happy ending, but you'll probably be a complete mess by the time you get to that point. It's also intriguing that Dumbo is the only male elephant in the picture. I guess having a bunch of male elephants sitting around gossiping and being afraid of mice wouldn't have worked so well. But it also made it that much easier to sympathize with the little guy.

Dream sequences are another thing that have always piqued my interest. Bending reality in any way, shape, or form is just a fascinating concept. So the entire pink elephant sequence has only gotten better with age. It walks this fine line of being both goofy and terrifying. Also, does it really matter if the crows are possibly racist or not? They're enjoyable characters that deliver one of the best songs in the film. That's all that matters. I have this thing about admiring cartoon birds and Jim Crow is right up there with Daffy Duck and Donald Duck as far as I'm concerned.

Dumbo is sweet at times, gentle at others, and incredibly depressing in between, which is probably the reason why I like it so much. Its animation is still crisp, colorful, and impressive to this day and its music is spectacular. For being 70 years old, Dumbo has stood the test of time better than anyone could have ever hoped. Despite being the shortest Disney major motion picture, Dumbo is still one of the best.

The Blu-ray is loaded with special features. There are three different versions of the film you can watch; there's the original aspect ratio presentation (4:3) that leaves two vertical black lines on each side of your screen if you own a widescreen television, there's Cine-Explore which is the film with running commentary by director Pete Docter, a Disney historian, and an animator, and then there's Disney View that has paintings where the black vertical lines should be during the presentation of the film. I recommend watching the film in Disney View since it's a little less distracting than the vertical black bars and the paintings usually have a theme to go along with whatever scene is currently playing; wood during the Casey Junior scenes, clouds when the stork is searching for Mrs. Jumbo, etc.

One deleted scene is featured, but it isn't finished animation. The scene got as far as being sketched out, so you get a lot of still frame shots of the sketches. It's called ""The Mouse's Tale"" and has Timothy telling Dumbo a story of how giant mice existed in prehistoric times. Somewhere down the line mice became small and elephants remained big, but they're still afraid of mice to this day because of how things used to be. It's a pretty fantastic sequence and would've been a welcome addition to the film to at least make its duration slightly longer. ""Are You a Man or a Mouse?"" is a deleted song. It's difficult to enjoy this since it's performed by a different voice actor and just isn't the same. There's a nearly thirty minute documentary-type feature called Taking Flight: The Making of Dumbo that is fairly informative of what things were like behind the scenes. The Magic of Dumbo: A Ride of Passage is just a short feature on the Dumbo ride at Disneyland. Sound Design Excerpt from ""The Reluctant Dragon"" is really cool. You get to see how sound effects are made in a cartoon and get to see Casey Junior's first appearance. Celebrating Dumbo is a fifteen minute feature of various individuals (a movie critic, an animator, film historian, etc) explaining why they love the film. Original Walt Disney Introduction is exactly what it sounds like it is while Art Galleries features seven different galleries of art. ""Elmer Elephant"" and ""The Flying Mouse"" are the two Bonus Shorts included with the film. Two games round out the special features. ""What Do You See?"" is a scrambled image game while ""What Do You Know?"" is a trivia game. Both are a race against the clock and can be played by one person or the entire family. A DVD version of the film is also included on a separate disc and features some of the bonus materials found on the Blu-ray, but not all of them.

Dumbo is rated G and is suitable for all ages. There's an all-new English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track, a 2.0 English Restored Feature Audio track, a French and Spanish 5.1 Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix (DEHT), and the film also has English, French, and Spanish Subtitles available. The box says the film is presented in 1080p High Definition with a 1.33:1 ratio, but I believe it's actually only available in the 4:3 ratio unless Disney View counts. The film is approximately 64 minutes long. The Dumbo Blu-ray/DVD combo set is available in retail stores and most online retailers now.",1316995200,4,7217,4.592707525213344
297569,2,6300274195,"I have Dumbo ""Big Top"" edition which is wonderful. I got this edition because of the extra features. On the back it says there's a feature about the making of Dumbo and also a video about the ride at Disneyland. I was hopeing that the ""making of"" feature would have the existing video interviews with some of the original animators but no such luck. I've seen video of Disney animator Ward Kimball talking about Dumbo but was that footage included here? NO. It's the current animators talking about the making of the picture so it's all second hand information. They did include some footage of the original live action reference footage of the dance team for the crows which is the reason why I gave this review two stars. (They did include the audio portions of Ward Kimball's interview in the commentary as well as audio from other people. Why not include the original videos in the ""making of"" section?

Then the bit about the ride at Disneyland has Imagineer Tony Baxter. He talks very briefly about the ride and they do show one concept painting from 1954-1955 which I've already seen elsewhere. I was hopeing for a bit of history like how the original was designed by Arrow Development and what led to the decision to install the current ride in 1983 and how the current ride at Disneyland had been intended for Disneyland Paris. But nope, nothing of the sort. Tony Baxter talks, like I said, very briefly, but then the segment dissolves into Disney advertisement dribble about how ""magical"" riding Dumbo is.

Just when you think it can't get any worse, it does. The actual film itself.
What I mean is, the video transfer. Did the restorer fall asleep at the video panel!?
On the previous DVD of ""Dumbo"" Big Top Edition the video transfer is beautiful.
Crisp beautiful colors. Not so on this version. The color on this version looks dark.
I would even say that the color looks dead. It doesn't ""pop"" off the screen at all.

So forget this version of Dumbo. Get the 60th anniversary edition or the Big Top edition, both of which are available on Amazon.",1316995200,5,2059,4.635616438356164

297621,5,6300274195,"""Dumbo"" is, quite simply, one of the greatest films of all time; animated or live-action. The movie is a masterpiece of animated, economical and, above all, emotional storytelling. On the surface, the story may seem simple, but the movie has more emotional impact than any other Disney film. Was there any other Disney character who suffered more abuse and mistreatment than Dumbo? Well, maybe Cinderella. And, like Cinderella, Dumbo rises (Dumbo literally flies) above his miserable circumstances and achieves a heartwarming triumph.
  Anyone who has felt like a misfit or an outcast from society will relate to the plight of poor elephant Dumbo; who is labeled a literal ""circus freak"" just because of his oversized ears. When his mother. Mrs. Jumbo, protects him from a bratty circus patron, she is jailed. Dumbo's only friend is Timothy, an enterprising little mouse who plans to make Dumbo a circus star. When the first plan goes disasterously awry, causing the Big Top to topple, Dumbo is furthur humilated by being turned into a clown. After Dumbo and Timothy accidentally drink from a water bucket filled with whiskey  , they find themselves up in the treetops the next morning. A group of wisecracking crows suggest that Dumbo got up into the trees by flying up. Lacking confidence, Dumbo is told that a ""magic feather"" held in his trunk will make him fly. Back at the circus, the feather is dropped and Timothy reveals it was just a psychological device. Timothy tells him he could fly all the time, if he will just open up his ears and BELIEVE in himself. Thus, Dumbo becomes a star at last when his big ears, once considered to be his greatest liability, become his greatest asset. Dumbo's triumph is especially sweet, because the audience has suffered along with Dumbo. Our tears are honestly shed, and our smiles at his victory are joyous.
  ""Dumbo"" is  Disney's most unpretentious classic; The animation style of ""Dumbo"" recalls the happy, vibrant spirit and colors of Disney's earlier ""Silly Symphonies"" short cartoons; before the ""feature-length"" sensation of ""Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs."" ""Dumbo"" is a perfectly emotionally balanced film; alternately heartbreaking and heartwarming. The music is another great aspect of the film. ""Casey Jr."" establishes the perfect circus mood. Three other moments, each very different in tone and mood, are memorable moments in music and animation. If you don't cry during the gentle lullabye ""Baby Mine"", your heart must be made of stone. ""Pink Elephants On Parade""  is a wild, surreal sequence. Finally, the crows big number ""When I See An Elephant Fly"" provides a pivitol turning point in the film.
  The 70th Anniversary Edition improves over previous DVD releases of the film, with better animated menus and more vibrant colors. A short segment on the popular ""Dumbo Ride"" at Disneyland and Disneyworld is included. Best of all is a 28 Minute ""Making Of Dumbo"" documentary, detailing how Walt Disney found ""Dumbo"" at a time of great financial crisis. Disney's  first animated feature ""Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs"" (1937) was instantly acclaimed as one of the most groundbreaking films in cinema history and quickly broke box-office records.  Disney spent all the money made from ""Snow White"" on ""Pinocchio"" and ""Fantasia"", neither of which returned a profit. To survive, Disney needed a shorter, smarter story and ""Dumbo"" was absolutely perfect. Lacking the ""high art"" pretentiousness of ""Fantasia,"" ""Dumbo"" is, converesly emotional art, and the public took ""Dumbo"", released just before Pearl Harbor and America's involvement in World War II, to heart immediately. ""Dumbo"" was in production while an animators' strike was looming at Disney Studios. The animators must have felt a special emotional connection to ""Dumbo""; because they completed it just before going on strike.
  ""Dumbo"" is always in my heart. I think every person should have ""Dumbo"" in their DVD collection, but you won't be able to watch it without a big box of Kleenex.",1316908800,,4006,5.107033639143731
297622,5,6300274195,"When I was little I loved the movie ""Dumbo,"" and thinking about it now I probably haven't seen the movie since.  Now though that I have kids I love that I can re-live the Disney Classics with them, as well as the new movies that come out!  First I will admit I had no clue ""Dumbo"" was 70 years old!  I cannot believe it came out in 1941!
Now since I haven't seen ""Dumbo"" for quite some years, I was super impressed with the quality remake on the Blu-ray edition.  The colors are so vibrant and you would not think it is a 70-year old cartoon!

If you have never seen Dumbo before, it is a movie about an elephant who is ""different.""  Jumbo Jr. (Dumbo is a mean name he is called) has big ears and is teased terribly amongst the circus animals, even kids.  His mother defends him and is punished for that by being chained up.  A small mouse ends up being Jumbo Jr.'s only friend.  I think ""Dumbo"" is a great movie for kids to see how awful it makes people (or animals in this case) feel when they are teased and how it is okay to be different.

With great animation, characters, and songs, ""Dumbo"" is a classic not to miss.  With my boys being 3 and 4, having the 70th Anniversary Edition came at a great time!  We have watched this Blu-ray a few times already, I still can't believe the movie is only about an hour long.  The Blu-ray + DVD combo is great because we now keep the Blu-ray inside and the DVD in the car!  Seeing a circus via Blu-ray quality is pretty awesome!",1316908800,3,1473,4.159010600706714
297623,5,6300274195,"""Dumbo"" is available in a Blu-ray 70th Anniversary Edition.  The shortest of the Disney animated classics at a mere 64 minutes, ""Dumbo"" has a simple story, told well.  The stork pays a visit to the circus, blessing most of the animals with new arrivals, including the elephant Mrs. Jumbo.  When the new baby sneezes, his ears unfold and they are enormous.  The other female elephants express horror and sarcasm.

Dumbo is relegated to the lowly clown act until he discovers that he can fly.  This turns him into the star attraction, and he and Mrs. Jumbo are rewarded with their own private car on the circus train.

The art work in ""Dumbo"" ranks with that of ""Pinocchio"" and ""Bambi"" and contains wonderful touches, highlighted by the ""Pink Elephants"" musical number, a hallucinatory dream sequence set to march tempo that occurs when Dumbo unknowingly drinks whiskey-laced water.  This surreal sequence contrasts with the otherwise realistic circus setting, with sight gags abounding.  The music also includes the Oscar-nominated ""Baby Mine,"" a touching lullaby sung by Mrs. Jumbo after she has been chained and locked away for causing a disturbance to protect Dumbo from being mistreated by some of the roustabouts.

""Dumbo"" was in production for eighteen months from the time Walt Disney read the galleys of a story by Helen Alberson.  Critics were effusive in their praise, especially after the experimental, ambitious feature ""Fantasia"" failed to entrance either critics or the public.  In ""Dumbo,"" Disney returned to a traditional story line, and his artists were able to exercise their imagination, sense of fun, and ingenuity to create a tale with heart.

The two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack's bonus extras include a deleted scene, deleted song, two animated shorts, making-of featurette, audio commentary, two games, and the original Walt Disney television introduction. This restored print marks the first time ""Dumbo"" has been released in high definition.",1316822400,,1966,5.262820512820513
297624,5,6300274195,"That Dumbo was and remains a masterpiece in the 21st Century is a bit of an oddity. After the exhausting, high pressure work put into Fantasia and its predecessor Pinnocio, the Disney studio was faced with two problems- global war and faltering  morale. With this in mind, Dumbo proved to be a veritable vacation for Disney's animators. In a word, it was ""fun"". For the first time in years, the feature animators were able to go back to the sensibilities of ""cartooning"".  The film abounds with sight gags that defy the laws of gravity and physics. It is sentimental and wacky at the same time. Keeping costs and complexity down, Dumbo did not rely on breathtaking ""special effects"", but finds its strength in solid character animation and a truly lovable story.

This is not your typical gooey sweetness. Dumbo's friend Timothy the mouse, is a street smart tough guy with a heart of gold--complete with a Bronx accent.  An innocent drunk scene (the water trough is accidentally spiked with booze) told through vivid neon hallucinations and such creative wackiness (as opposed to silliness) that the puns and imagery still play well today.

 Then there are the ""crows"". Even in a world of political correctness, there is nothing embarassing or hurtful here (OK, so the mouse refers to the crows as ""you boys"" Your kids won't notice through the playfulness and you'd do best not to point it out). Remember, this is a film of caricatures as opposed to realism. It simply works.

So here we have a low budget piece of fluffery that truly deserves the status of ""a classic"". It is fun, sweet and sassy all at once. There is nothing riveting or frightening- no demonic villains or death scenes- just an hour+ of animated joy.

And now the real kicker-- through tasteful digital remastering, the films colors and rich nuances literally leap from your video screen. This digital release looks and sounds so good that Uncle Walt himself would be dumbstruck!

If you have kids, love animation, or just want an evening of sheer delight, you owe it to yourself to spend an evening with this adorable film. Two thumbs way up.",1316822400,,2113,4.782967032967033

297627,5,6300274195,"Dizney's 'Dumbo' is super kool. especially the part where Dumbo gets his revenge on all the circus community that made his life miserable and made him a neglected outcast. the best part was when he trumped those good for nuthin clowns. nobody likes clowns anyway and it was fun to see em get what was comin to em.
  people can be mean. clowns more than most like to make fun of people and can have a callous sense of humour. Dizney's 'Dumbo' the elephunk is every nerds revenge fantasy and vindication that you should never underestimate a person (or elephunk's) differences. they often have something to offer. but when people are being mean and indifferent they don't always get it. but sometimes they get theirs in the end. just like the mean elephunks and those nasty, vicious clowns.
  the crows were bad news too, but they at least helped Dumbo to get tough and stop being a victim. something all the Dumbo's of the world should do. Dumbo is kool. he's my hero and mentor in life. i too want to get revenge in life and have the satifaction of getting back at all the mean circus clowns who have ignored and neglected and ridiculed my life.
  which one are you? a nerdy Dumbo or a mean clownie? have you been nice or helpful to anyone who needed it lately? or do you just say mean things about people's mothers? who knows? maybe one day all that meaness will come back to you.",1315526400,,1381,4.438735177865612

297690,5,6300274195,"Disney has a very specific formula that they've stuck to. They would release a film and then years later rerelease it in theaters to a new audience of children that hadn't been around for the previous release to rake in additional revenue. Now they continue this release pattern, and have been doing so, on the home video market. There were the VHS, then came the DVD, the special edition DVD's and now we move on to Blu-ray. So most of us already own this film, and unlike the switch from VHS to DVD there is no major benefit or format difference between DVD and Blu-ray as far as playing the film for children goes. That means that currently the Disney releases are being, or at least should be, aimed at the older Disney fans. The ones who appreciate the story and animation enough to shell out cash to buy a film we already have because it means HD quality, hopefully new special features to sweeten the deal and to be honest for the desire of having it in our collections.

So many parents won't see the point in rebuying this film for the kids while others probably will who didn't have children upon the last release and some new age parents actually like the digital copy for their kids to watch during travel, etc. I think everyone has a grasp on the story of Dumbo, even those who haven't seen it yet have heard enough about it. So then, the real question is whether or not older Disney fans are getting anything new from this purchase if they already own the last release (either the 60th anniversary or the Big Top Edition). Here are the contents of this release for those not in the know to possibly help them better decide:

First and foremost, Dumbo here recieves an HD transfer. From online reviews, and having seen the Mexican import clips, I can say that the upgrade is noticeable. In comparison Bambi for example looked like brand new animation despite its age, Alice in Wonderland also looked better than ever, all the transfers of the older classics so far have had simply magnificent image quality, Dumbo on Blu is no different than these earler releases. There are some video issues but all seem to be from the original animation, those aside, it looks great, much, much nicer than the DVD versions.

Special Features: These are how I justify my new format purchases, I like there to be some new behind the scenes content to help me justify buying a title I can already watch at my leisure. For example I found it difficult to buy Fox and the Hound on Blu because there were no new special features of any kind, I did buy it but it left a bitter aftertaste.

On a side note, I enjoy how Disney has been labelling its special features on Blu-ray. Classic DVD bonus features are clearly labelled so that I know what I've already seen and can easily find what's new. I'll attempt to do the same here (correct me if I'm wrong).

CLASSIC/HOLD OVER CONTENT

- Celebrating 'Dumbo'
- Original Walt Disney TV Introduction
- Sound Design Excerpt from 'The Reluctant Dragon'
- Trailers for the original release and the later rerelease
- Bonus Shorts (Now in HD) - Bonus cartoons, The Flying Mouse and Elmer Elephant
- Art Gallery

NEW CONTENT
- The Magic of 'Dumbo': A Ride of Passage - a short featurette exploring the theme park ride
- Deleted Scenes (HD) - Two deleted scenes with introductions explaining them and why they were removed
- Taking Flight: The Making of 'Dumbo' (HD) a 28 minute documentary about the Disney studio and Dumbo
- Cine-Explore - Similarly found on the Bambi and Alice in Wonderland Blu releases. This picture-in-picture audio commentary features Pete Docter, Paula Sigman, and Andreas Deja. Meanwhile concept art, clips from other Disney films, vintage photos, interviews with surviving contributors and more are shown or played.
- DisneyView Presentation - gives the viewer the option of replacing the black space on each side of the screen with colorful designs
- About James Coleman (HD, 1 min) - A short featurette about the artist who designed the Disneyview panels for this release

So I hope all that info helps buyers make a more informed decision on whether or not the upgrade to HD is worth it. I will certainly be upgrading, I enjoy the improved image quality but the cine-explore feature and new documentary alone help me justify this purchase. Cine-explore, as I said, is the same feature found on Alice in Wonderland and Bambi that creates a new more interactive form of audio commentary.

On another note I wish Amazon would only include reviews of the actual release being sold on the product page. Too many of these reviews are carried over from the DVD releases and the page will become further cluttered upon release of the blu-ray. Oh well, at least this September I'll finally be able to own Dumbo on Blu after it being delayed months and months. Now lets hope Disney speeds up their releases, so far I've only heard of Lion King and Lady and the Tramp being planned for release in the near future.

**Just to confirm, having now watched it and working on the special features I am very happy with this release and my purchase. This is how all Disney films should be released, new informative special features, beautiful transfer. Magical.

297696,5,6300274195,"Dumbo is one hour and four minutes and was released in theaters on October 23, 1941. Dumbo was the shortest film to date until Saludos Amigos came out in August of 1942. Dumbo basically the movie tells the story of a baby elephant born with birth defect, big ears. He is seen as an outcast from his fellow elephants; the children make fun of him, and the circus clown make fun of him. His mother is put in cage for protecting him. Dumbo's only friend is a mouse; real name is Timothy Q. Mouse. It is only with the help of Timothy and the crows (and the magic feather) that they convince Dumbo that he can fly. In the end Dumbo has the last laugh on the people who hurt him.

Dumbo won the Academy Award in 1942 for Original Music Score. Because Fantasia and Pinocchio were financial flops, the movie was made using watercolor backgrounds and paint. The movie cost around $800,000 and made almost twice as during its release. One other thing to note, on the DVD disc in the Casey Jr. sing-along song, it is a combination of the Dumbo movie and the short call The Brave Engineer. Dumbo is one of Disney's finest movies ever made and gets an AAAAA+++++.

My great grandaughter, age 2, will be seeing it for the first time and i am so excited. I am 68 years old and remember Dumbo and most  scenes since I seen it and that was the  first time it came out.

297743,5,6300274195,"(The title is my favorite line in the movie, spoken by Timothy Mouse to Dumbo.)

I rented ""Dumbo"" so that I could preview it before buying it for my 5-year-old, who saw a preview for it on another Disney DVD and wants to see it.  This animated movie about a sweet-faced, sad-eyed baby elephant got a strong emotional reaction from me.....and I tend to have a somewhat jaded view of the world.

Regarding the quality of the movie itself:  I thought the movie was visually pretty; not as gorgeous as, say, ""The Lion King,"" but since this movie is 70 years old, that's to be expected.  The story flowed well, though I wish the ending had been a bit more complete as it felt rushed to me.  The songs were memorable, especially ""Baby Mine."" (I don't see how anyone can watch that scene and not get a lump in their throat, at the very least.)

Many people have commented on two scenes in the movie that many consider to be controversial.  I agree that the ""roustabout"" number has some cringe-inducing lyrics.  It was a reflection of the times, and that ugly aspect of history can't be hidden from the art of that time period.  Regarding the highly discussed ""pink elephants"" number:  I think it was merely a diversion meant to lighten up the mood of the movie since that number takes place after a couple of very sad scenes, plus it led Timothy Mouse to determine that Dumbo can fly.

Parents should know that this story is a variation of ""The Ugly Duckling,"" and some children, particularly those who are very sensitive to the feelings of others, may be disturbed by Dumbo's treatment.  That aspect of the movie is what got to me.  The artists clearly convey the love that Dumbo and his mother have for each other, as well as the sadness they feel over the events that transpire.  Dumbo triumphs in the end, but as I wrote earlier, the ending is very quick, and in my opinion, doesn't really allow the audience to share in his glory. Instead, the ending just assures us that he is going to be okay, then the credits roll.

My final decision on whether or not to buy this movie for my child is that while I do want her to watch it, I plan to wait a year or two. Dumbo is a wonderful movie, and there are many topics to be discussed after watching it, important topics that should be discussed in families.  I just want to be sure that she has the emotional maturity to express what she's feeling and discuss it with me. If I were to give an age range that I think would be appropriate for this movie, I'd say age 7 and up.",1298073600,5,2516,4.353319057815845
297744,5,6300274195,Bought this DVD for my 2 and 3 y/o and it brings back the best memories for me as a kid.  I hope this movie does the same for my children when they watch it years later.,1297209600,,169,3.5675675675675675
297745,4,6300274195,"So, I was the DUMBO and didn't pay close enough attention. I typed in ""Dumbo Blu Ray"" in the Amazon search...found DUMBO in big letters on a blu-ray and proceeded quickly with my purchase.  I assumed that I missed the original DUMBO blu-ray release and that only third party sellers had it left.  This title really should be listed more clearly that it has Spanish packaging.  The ""Aniversario"" is the only clue anywhere in the listing that it has Spanish packaging (besides the reviews -- which I didn't read because I knew we wanted it).  I can't find a date for when an English packaged Dumbo will be released, so as long as this will play in English, I will still give it as a gift for my husband. Particularly since we only own Dumbo on VHS, the Spanish on the outside won't be a big deal.  People who don't use English as a first language put up with English plastered everywhere.  Not sure why they'd release only the Spanish labeling, if the discs play automatically in English...are they improving/adding something before they do a regular release????

UPDATE:
The Blu-ray was loose in the case, but plays well...in ENGLISH.  In fact, the disc label itself is in English.  The screen menus don't look as polished as other Disney blu-rays, but the disc seems to play just fine, the picture is of good quality, and thankfully, (did I mention?) it is in English with the options of Spanish, and Portuguese.

297747,4,6300274195,"Dumbo is one of the greatest Disney classics in Disney history! Throughout the story there is ridicule of a baby elephant ,named Dumbo, because of his enormous ears. When his mother tries to protect him from the nasty name calling she is taken away from her baby and locked up. The ridicule continues until one day Timothy J. Mouse offers Dumbo a peanut and a grand friendship is formed. Timothy J. Mouse and Dumbo learn that there are struggles in life but if one works hard enough, one can overcome any obstacle and achieve greatness. Dumbo, with his friend and the help of a few crows learns to soar to new heights and become the world's greatest flying elephant.",1295222400,,666,4.605042016806722
297748,4,6300274195,"`Dumbo' is one of those Disney films I grew up on and I still have fond memories of putting this on on VHS and enjoying every minute of the story. I was obviously looking forward to this Blu-Ray reissue and although it lives up to my expectations in some respects, it also misses the mark in others. The re-mastering is pretty decent and the sound quality is much improved, but I feel the animal rendering is too polished now. The nuance and style of the classic animation is lost and you can obviously tell this has been retouched. Re-mastering should be unobtrusive and add to the end product and sadly here it detracts from the original animation. Thankfully the scenery is still beautiful and many small touches that make this film remain. This film has great music that brought many memories flooding back and the now famous psychedelic pink elephant scene is just as impressive as ever. This has a nice mix of cute, funny and sad scenes and the sad ones made me choke up as a kid and still had the power to put a lump in my throat as an adult. This package features an array of extras, most of which are of more interest to a child audience, but there area also some bits of interest to adults too. Overall this is a fine example of classic Disney animation and although I feel the re-mastering may have taken a step too far this time, this is still a film that should be owned by all fans of animation. This is heart warming film making at it's best.

297749,5,6300274195,"Dumbo (60th Anniversary Edition) is one Disney's true classic animated movies. The story is about a small elephant who is born with big ears and then shunned by the rest of the circus for being different. The scene ""Baby Mine"" is one that brings a tear to ones eye and yes I admit I cried during that scene. The animation is amazing and the storyline is just as good as other classics such as Pinocchio, Cinderella and Snow white and the seven dwarfs. This movie will be enjoyed by generations of children for come as the message is ever green. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.",1294185600,,576,4.548076923076923
297800,4,6300274195,"The cd said ""70 aniversario"", so I feared it might have a Spanish track.  Even though it was a gift for a grandson, I opened it and checked it out.  It was in English all right.  I had not seen it for sixty years, but it is as touching as ever.  Now that we have retired to Sarasota, FL, I was fascinated by the circus background which is so much part of the history here,  The station where the train leaves from is the former Sarasota station.  The Circus Museum at the Ringling Museum of Art has a miniature circus and lots of posters and costumes. Circus Sarasota is a one-ringed circus under a Big Top.
I was looking at the movie from a 4 year old's perspective and think that the story will be very powerful for him, but that the Parade of the Elephants sequence will go on too long.  His artist father will appreciate the graphics though.",1292371200,,845,4.24375

297867,5,6300274195,"Like many Disney animated films, this one has a moral--actually two.  First, no matter how ""weird"" or ""different"" you may be, you have something that makes you valuable; all you have to do is find it.  Second, when you find it, have faith in it--and yourself--and you will triumph.  Thus Dumbo, officially named Jumbo Jr., a baby circus elephant who arrives with ears bigger than he is.  Since, like most circus elephants, he's supposed to be an *Indian* elephant, and therefore have nice small ears, all the other pachyderms (except his loving mother) treat him as a freak, and when human visitors to the menagerie make fun of him and she bursts out in fury, she's chained and imprisoned as a ""mad elephant,"" depriving him of her company.  Only Timothy Mouse, a rodent with a band jacket and a Brooklyn accent, is willing to be his friend and to encourage him to hope.  It isn't till they both accidentally get drunk on a tub of watered wine (or wined water!) that Dumbo finds his ""value"": his big ears can be used as wings!

You couldn't make this movie today: somebody would be sure to complain that the slightly surreal ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" (which looks as if it wandered in out of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantasia-Special-60th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B00003CX9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantasia (Special 60th Anniversary Edition)</a>&nbsp;by mistake) was disrespectful to alcoholics, or that the Boss Crow and his ""brothas"" were racist.  Yet both segments are vital to the development of the story, and the crows are in fact instrumental to helping Dumbo discover that he doesn't have to be under the influence in order to take off.  There are also several myths upheld by the story--that the stork delivers babies, that ostriches hide their heads in the sand, that elephants are afraid of mice.  But of course, in the end, Timothy's faith, Dumbo's courage, and Mrs. Jumbo's love prevail, and they roll off into the sunset to the happy strains of the crows' song.

297912,3,6300274195,"The Bottom Line:

A very short (~60 minutes) animated film by Disney that lacks the scope and ambition of the studio's more accomplished efforts, Dumbo isn't bad per se but it's a rather unimpressive story that will appeal more to children than their more-discerning parents.

Some folks say Dumbo is a sad movie because the other elephants were not nice to Dumbo. When his mother got seperated from the other animals in the circus, his only friend was Timothy Mouse.
I know that you folks say Dumbo is sad movie, but This movie is GREAT!!!  Only the part when the other elephants spread roomers about his ears, and his mother was seperated from the other circus animals. Don't forget there are some happy parts in this movie such as when Dumbo meets Timothy Mouse, the hilarious pink elephants singing ""Pink Elephants On Parade"", when the crows teach Dumbo to fly and they sand ""When I See An Elephant Fly"", and when the audience saw Dumbo fly in the circus.

Dumbo is a great movie!!!

297915,5,6300274195,"Dumbo is the story of a baby elephant born with enormous ears.  When the other circus elephants reject him, and his mother is locked away as a ""mad elephant"" for trying to protect her baby, Dumbo's only friend turns out to be Timothy, the circus mouse.  Together, they learn that huge ears can be an asset.

This movie has much to recommend it. It's only an hour long, which means it won't bore kids beyond their attention span.  Its message of treating those with differences or handicaps fairly and kindly is important for everyone to hear.

Best of all, it has some wonderful musical numbers.  ""Baby Mine"" still brings tears to my eyes all these years later, and ""When I See an Elephant Fly"" is hysterically funny to those old enough to understand the word play.  But ""Pink Elephants"" has got to be one of the most inventive and clever numbers ever devised.  The constantly morphing elephants of this sequence were all hand-drawn -- no computers used at all!

Caution:  This movie was made in the 1950's, and there is some ethnic stereotyping that can be offensive.  For instance, the ringmaster, who has a thick Italian accent, is somewhat of a buffoon.  Also, the musical number ""When I See an Elephant Fly"" is sung by crows that are clearly meant to be African Americans.  They use some poor grammar and in other ways conform to common stereotypes of the times.  However, I believe that little children won't understand the stereotype, or it can be dealt with by explaining that the crows don't go to school, so they don't talk correctly.  Adults will know better and will be able to enjoy the clever word play in the song.

Another caution is that the stork delivers the circus animal babies.  That might take some explaining!",1259020800,,1733,4.666666666666667

And the cruelty to animals and the big ears... the only thing that mattered here & that stands out in any child's mind is a) how degrading we are to those who are less fortunate, which teaches children to be more loving and understanding; and also opens their eyes to how fortunate and blessed many are, b) to keep on going and never give up & to believe in yourself... and that things do not always come out the way one intends, but nonetheless it is crucial to make something of it, and c) the relationship that Dumbo has with his beautiful mother elephant is UNBEATABLE in the eyes of any child!!! how can anyone say this is a bad and discriminating film!!!!

297934,5,6300274195,"Despite what I've said about previous films I've reviewed (""Mamma Mia!"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" etc.), this is my all time favorite movie. This is Walt Disney at his best. The story is simple and it is short at 64 minutes, but it delivers the story quickly so it doesn't plod along like some other Disney films. The characters are entertaining, especially Timothy Mouse for helping our young, speechless hero. Dumbo is one of the cutest animated characters and struggles throughout the movie because of his ""deformity"". The animation is outstanding, especially the Pink Elephants sequence and the sequence when the elephants stand on the ball and then the circus is destroyed. The songs fit well into the plot of the film and aren't shoehorned in. The most tearful/touching scenes are when Dumbo is with his mother, the ""Baby Mine"" sequence imparticular. Now, I'm going to go on a little rant here and it especially goes out all of the NARROW-MINDED and IGNORANT people who have given this gem of a movie a bad review. This movie and its portrayal of the crows are not racist, I mean, I'm sorry if crows are black, but you need to talk to the Big Guy Upstairs about that one. And even if they unintentionally were and you don't want your kid exposed to it, then you are raising them to be oblivious to a human condition that, unfortunately, will exist until the end of days. Its unfortunate that this and ""Song of the South"" are labled as racist films along with the great ""Looney Tunes"" and ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoons. They shouldn't have to address to people that these are products of the time and apologize that some people may be offended. We shouldn't have to be so PC all the time. It restricts creativity. Look at the Steve Martin remake of ""The Pink Panther"" and then look at the originals with Sellers (yes even the three made after his death). The Clouseau character had a greater dynamic and foil with Chinese manservant Cato than with Ponton (it was good but not like what he had with Cato). The character was supposed to be in the remake but the producers changed their mind because it might offend some people, despite the character being associated with the films. Even the ""Super Friends"" of the '70s/'80s. They try to put their best foot foward by including different races and all people do now is criticize them for being racist. When the Darkseid character was introduced in the '80s cartoons, the heads at ABC tried to change the name to ""DarkSIDE"" because the original spelling might offend their German viewers despite that's how the character's name is spelled in the comics and in the more PC era of the '90s with the Bruce Timm Superman animated series. If these remarks are going to garner a lot of negative comments for me, then so be it because these are my views.",1244246400,,2819,4.662650602409639

297937,5,6300274195,"The wait is over, after more than a year of being delayed, Dumbo is finally available in all HD glory and what a release it is!!

Dumbo was Walt's fourth film but is also one of the most remembered, well-known and loved movies that has come from the studio. It's simple short story about a little elephant with big ears that overcome all the obstacles to become a success is still as poignat, cheerful and delightful as it was 70 years ago. The film is Disney's shortest and yet is more powerful than many other films that run more time than this one. The relationship between Dumbo and his mother is both happy and heartbreaking and you can't help but being deeply moved in the ""Baby Mine"" sequence even if you've seen it several times. Also, this movie showcases one of the best surreal sequences ever put into film: ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" is wacky, beautiful and nonsensical in a wonderful way. Values like friendship, love, courage and more are all over the film and makes it even stronger and better.

Dumbo is simply a classic.

Video & Audio
Dumbo arrives on BD looking absolutely spectacular. The restoration given to this film is up there with other Disney films like Fantasia, Snow White and Bambi; it's simply amazing. Colors are well reproduced and pop out the screen, clarity and detail is sharp and contrast is strong. Even better, there are no signs of damage or compression artifacts. The transfer is breathtaking.

In the audio department Dumbo sports a robust 7.1 DTS-HD MA which won't rock your living room but has not tampered with the original mono. Clarity again is striking and directionality is well reproduced. For purists, the restored monoaural soundtrack is also included.

Bonus Features:
There is plenty of bonus features bothe new and old that you will enjoy:

First you have Cinema-Explore mode in which you can see the movie with a visual PIP commentary by Pete Docter, Paula Sigman and Andreas Deja. The PIP presentation is very well done, engaging and should not be missed. In here, the trio discusses the production of Dumbo, its style, release and success. Very interesting.
Then you have a making of documentary ""Taking Flight: The Making of Dumbo"" which is essentially an extension of the PIP comentary but it's also very interesting to watch.
Then you have a newly discovered deleted scene ""The Mouse's Tale"" and a newly discovered deleted song ""Are you man or mouse?"" You also have a short featurette called ""The Making of Dumbo: A Ride of Passage"" which discusses the legacy and endurance on one of the most popular rides at Disneyland.

Carried over from previous releases are the featurette ""Celebrating Dumbo"", ""Walt Disney TV Introduction"", ""Sound Design Excerpt from The Reluctant Dragon"", an Art Gallery and trailers.

Closing Thoughts
Dumbo is one of Disney's most beloved classics and its impact hadn't diminished in its 70 years of existence. It's simply a masterpiece. This BD set is awesome with spectacular picture and sound and a great quantity of quality bonus features, is a must own title and comes VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",1240012800,2,3087,4.877862595419847

The pink Elephants on parade sequence highlights masterful animation skills. Everything about this movie is a winner and I  easily think this is about as good as the remastered Sleeping Beauty. What the heck happened to Disney in the last 20 or so years, they used to be great.

And so the tearfest begins.

I loved this movie as a child and recently rediscovered it while visiting with my two year-old niece. As is typical for kids that age, we watched the movie everyday (sometimes twice) for a week.

Every time I cried.

I can't really think of another Disney movie that depicts such a wonderfully loving and sweet relationship between parent and child (no Bambi didn't do it for me).

Plus Dumbo is the self-doubting underdog throughout, which simply makes me love him even more.

Oh, and my niece, she squealed with delight for Dumbo's triumphs each time and paid serious attention to the sad parts where mother and child are separated.  Never underestimate a two year-old.

The only reason I stop short of giving it a 5-star is the dated depictions of excessive alcohol use, smoking and the stereotyping of the crows...yeah I know you can't stereotype crows as such, but we can easily figure out to whom those stereotypes apply.  Can't go back in time and undo the social circumstances that made this acceptable childrens entertainment.

298085,5,6300274195,"""When I See An Elephant Fly"" is just one of a number of classic songs performed in the short and sweet Walt Disney classic, ""Dumbo.""  This wonderfully touching film about a young elephant who doesn't fit in speaks volumes to viewers both young and old.  More than just a simple cartoon, this story shows how someone who's different deserves just as much respect as any other person.  Jumbo, Jr. (Dumbo's real name) is protected by his mother from bullies until she's punished for defending him in a chaotic tangle with other elephants.  He's befriended by the loyal Timothy Q. Mouse (Edward Brophy), who teaches him to keep his head up and be happy just as he is.

This DVD features a number of extras including the obligatory passable music video, a cartoon short of ""Elmer Elephant"" and ""The Flying Mouse,"" sing along songs and an excellent read along storybook.

Some have stated that this film is racist and/or unsuitable due to the crow characters.  To be honest, these characters are some of the most endearing in my opinion.  Their song, ""When Elephants Fly,"" is one of my personal Disney favorites.  Some even go so far as to say the the ""drunk"" scene goes too far for small children.  Guess what, folks, I'd much rather my child see a drunk mouse in a Disney feature than a drunk uncle on Christmas day!  This story teaches tolerance, forgiveness, and that bullies are the only ugly ones around.

Seeing this version carefully applied to DVD is a delight all over again. Sometimes analog to digital suffers in transition: not so in this case.

It is amazing that this film was made 65 years ago.  This bright, crisp, colorful film with it's excellent soundtrack and music is just captivating.  My 3-year old is currently fixated with ""Gumbo""-- meaning that this is the DVD that will be in the single disc rotation for the next couple weeks or so.

Yes the crows are incredibly non-PC, and that is the one place where the film shows it's age-- but that just adds to the film now.  It isn't like a child would ever pick up on the racial overtones of the crows without a frame of reference.

One sequence that is still freaking me out is the Pink Elephants on parade sequence.  I guess I am a little surprised this is from 1940; some of the things like the reference to Technicolor I would never have thought would be from the 40s.  And the morphing and dancing elephants sequence seemed like it would have belonged more in a 60s acid movie than in a 40s kids cartoon.  If the hippies had DVD they would have loved tripping out to that.

But all in all this is a nearly perfect movie, but one that might get overlooked my many parents who are picking up Nemo, Cars, or Aladdin.  Don't overlook this movie.",1194307200,3,1276,4.337552742616034

That particular song sets the mood for the rest of the movie, and who Dumbo, the elephant . . . is. A somewhat orphan who lost his mother to not death, but punishment, banishment, and also captivity.

This is Dumbo's time to shine, and find the talents he knows not that he has.

Jumbo Jr. The little elefant with big ears and outcast of the paciderms becomes the hero of the circus. Does it get any better than that. Overcoming triumph. This film never gets old. And, it shows the values of the past, stokes delivering babies, and the ideal mother protecting their children.  Also, Pink elephants as a representation of Drinking.  Back then, nobody really talked about drinking, so they use terms such as ""seeing pink elephants"" to say that they were drunk.  That part use to actually scare me as a kid.

298233,4,6300274195,"As a kid I loved Dumbo; my kids loved Dumbo; my two tiny grandkids love Dumbo (I bought this edition for them). My adult eyes now see aspects of the flick that both awe and disappoint.

First, the awe. The circus is presented entirely from the animals' point of view. Humans are seen as exploiters using the ""dumb"" animals for gain and assuming they have no feelings because they are ""made of rubber."" These attitudes suffuse every human from the barker to the lowly clowns, who'd gladly kill little Dumbo for a bit of fame and fortune.

The circus is mainly a sad affair, with constant and dreary movement from town to town often in driving rain. Even the train engine is caught in the unpleasantness as he pulls the overloaded cars up impossible hills gasping, ""I think I can...""

The supreme joy for these captives is the appearance of their babies. The new life brings smiles and warmth to an otherwise cold, confined existence.

It is Dumbo's triumph to literally and miraculously rise above the caged horror of circus life, most poignantly epitomized by his mother's being called mad and mercilessly chained for the crime of being a mother. Dumbo, by employing his handicap, those big ears, to fly, breaks clear of his physical and psychological prison, exacts revenge on all who tormented him and his mother, and, by making more money than the circus ever dreamed of, gets to call his own shots.

Now the disappointments. The movie is short. Disney wanted it to exceed 60 minutes, so he inserted a boring fantasy sequence about pink elephants. This is not an avante garde piece of impressionistic animation: it's filler that gets the movie to 63 minutes, breaks the brisk timing of the rest of the film, and put three generations of my family to sleep when it showed.

The crows represent African American stereotypes that are demeaning and embarrassing and quite unfortunate when kids see them. There is a bit of redemption in the fact that Dumbo chooses them as his entourage when he could have chosen anybody, but that doesn't make up for the insulting portrayal, especially since the movie also features nameless black men as menial circus workers. Blacks are otherwise absent from audiences, townsfolk, and performers.

Should you buy Dumbo and screen it for your kids, anyway? Yep. It's a true classic. It is a shame, though, that the producers felt the need to accept fully the shameful dictates of an apartheid era.",1157760000,6,2430,4.7990430622009566

The story of the elephant who can fly, imortalized in the Disneyland attraction is a great film.

Although it does have some truly heartbreaking moments, this is a great family film that teaches children that we should all accept each other for our differences unlike the way some characters in the film behave.

Originally released in 1941, Dumbo is a short 63 minutes in duration. The special features on the Big Top Edition more than outweigh the feature itself. There is a game that teaches children about circus animals, a storybook, two sing a longs, a music video, several Disney shorts. Outside of the commentary track and the shorts, little here is of value or interest to the adult. The real issue with this new ""Big Top"" Edition is that it is not significantly different than the ""60th Anniversary Edition"". There is a different music video, the addition of a feature and the loss of others. The film quality itself is not dramatically different than the previous version.

The new transfer IMO is WORSE then the ""60th Anniversary Edition"" It has no life to it, it is darker and very dull. Also you are losing 30% of the film do to an overscan! This movie was already filmed in fullscreen why do a pan and scan job to a fullscreen DVD? Come on Disney, you get enough money!

However, with the Big Top Edition, I expected better remastering of the movie. The majority of the picture and sound are crisp and clean and very brilliant in color, however there are moments when it's not. For example, in the beginning of the ""Pink Elephants on Parade"", you can see some faded color with scratches on the film clearly seen over Dumbo's face. The sound in the song sung by the black ravens, ""When I See An Elephant Fly"" is a bit underdone in the remastering as well as it becomes harder to hear in this portion of the movie--almost as if the film had aged so bad that the soundtrack is beyond repair.

Other than these difficulities, I believe the release deserves four stars. If you have kids, the bonus features are specifically geared towards them. They'll enjoy it.",1149811200,18,1043,4.427083333333333

I always loved this film, but I always assumed it was taken for granted by most people and, like it's title character, considered the runt of the illustrious library of Disney classic feature cartoons. Many of these customer reviews prove me wrong. ""Dumbo"" is elegant in its simplicity, honesty, humor, and positive message of hope. As for the ""Baby Mine"" number....it's the reason I'll only watch ""Dumbo"" alone. No matter what your age, give ""Dumbo"" a chance. It may just become something very personal for you as it did for me.",1149465600,10,814,4.397350993377484
298282,5,6300274195,"Walt Disney's beloved, modest classic ""Dumbo"" carries a different history than most in the studio's library. It lacked ""Fantasia's"" groundbreaking animation/music choreography. Its story wasn't as familiar as timeless tales of Snow White, Cinderella, or Alice in Wonderland Disney stamped as its own. Its dialogue was sparse, its main character silent. Even its home video history is unique, being  Disney's first ""classic"" title released to the format and consistently in print while Disney withdrew and re-released others.

But 1941's ""Dumbo,"" deservedly updated in this deluxe ""Big Top"" edition, was Walt Disney's favorite films (he says so in one of the DVD's bonus features.)  It's no surprise; this simple story of a long-eared, baby elephant, cherished by his mother, mistreated by nearly everyone else and eventually victorious, addressed themes of maternal love, perseverance, and self-esteem covered in Disney and other children's films to this day.

The movie is still a speedy 64 minutes (which cynics would say is about your wait for Dumbo's Disney World ride). Yet young Dumbo and his mother's story are fully and economically told around them through characters like Timothy Mouse, jazz-jiving crows (singing the musical highlight ""When I See An Elephant Fly"") and elephants cruel and catty (at the circus) or pink and near psychedelic (in the film's fantasy sequence). ""Baby Mine,"" where Dumbo's mother cuddles and rocks him through circus prison bars, is among animation's most moving scenes.

Besides the TV ""Disneyland"" intro, the ""Big Top"" edition also holds two Disney ""Silly Symphonies"" (""Elmer Elephant"" the better of the two), a newly sung ""Baby Mine,"" a Dumbo DVD storybook, matching cards and an appreciation led by film critic Leonard Maltin. Overall, this ""Big Top"" edition gives ""Dumbo"" the well-deserved treatment its hero received at the end of the film. It's indispensable for Disney fans, an essential  diamond among children's films.",1148947200,4,1967,5.432786885245902
298283,5,6300274195,"Before the modern-era of Disney animation began with THE LITTLE MERMAID, the best animated Disney movies were the more original ones that they basically came up with themselves, e.g. BAMBI or THE FOX AND THE HOUND.  DUMBO is another one of those.  The movie is basically a story about believing in yourself and accepting the things in your life that make you different from others.

The story is quite simple. A circus elephant, Mrs. Jumbo longs for a baby.  The stork comes a little late, but delivers her bundle of joy. She names the boy elephant Jumbo Junior, but as soon as the other elephants see his humungous ears they christen him Dumbo and the name sticks.  Dumbo's ears cause all sorts of problems.  Mrs. Jumbo is imprisoned after defending Dumbo from some teasing, reckless youths and Dumbo is made into a clown after he causes the big top to literally come down. Dumbo is one sad baby elephant, but then he meets Timothy Mouse and Timothy quickly becomes Dumbo's aid, confidant, and mentor. In the end, everything turns out okay.

There's quite a bit that's appealing about DUMBO. To begin with, the movie (at around 63 minutes) is one of the shortest feature films ever released.  The story says all it needs to say and there really isn't any fluff (even the pink elephants have their place).  The animation is quite spectacular, especially considering that the film was released in 1941. The music and songs are top notch, with everything from catchy tunes to tear-jerking lullabies. The movie has a great message and it appeals to both children and adults. It truly is a Disney classic (and I don't use that term lightly).

This edition of the film includes more extras that the length of the film.  There are a couple of games, some sing-along-songs, a ""music video"", and a featurette. My favorite part of the extras were the two Silly Symphonies that are included, ""Elmer Elephant"" and ""The Mouse That Could Fly"". Both go along with the theme of DUMBO and compliment the film nicely (and the Mouse short includes an appearance by the Blue Fairy from Pinocchio).",1148947200,5,2078,4.7444444444444445
298284,5,6300274195,"For some reason, I never saw most of the Disney classic movies when I was growing up - but I'm certainly having a good time watching them all these years later.  Dumbo, of course, may be the most beloved Disney film of them all - despite the fact that it is relatively short (64 minutes), sports a pretty simplistic style of animation, and features a main character that never speaks a single word.  The film's popularity is due in large part to the story itself, as there is a little bit of Dumbo in all of us.  At some time, we've all been embarrassed by our appearance, laughed at and snubbed by those around us, and been made to feel like a complete loser.

Everyone knows the story already.  Poor little Dumbo, with his big ears, is ridiculed and called a freak by the other elephants, harassed by kids going in to see the circus, separated from his mother, and eventually made into a clown, the very embodiment of his unhappy life.  Only little Timothy Mouse befriends him, and his spirit of optimism and commitment to help Dumbo prove himself are needed more than ever when things go from bad to worse.  In the end, the very thing that makes Dumbo different turns out to be the source of his greatest strength.  The message of the film is pretty simple: believe in yourself, even when others put you down and, for heaven's sake, don't make fun of someone just because he looks different.  Dumbo is also a story about love, particularly the love between a mother and child, and the importance of friendship.

Classic Disney films such as this are both wonderful and remarkable - yet so many of them are also sad.  I imagine that children, while they will certainly understand the themes of this story, don't connect to the film on the same emotional level as I do as an adult.  I really got emotional watching this - right from the start, with the sadness exuded by Mrs. Jumbo as she watches children being delivered to seemingly every one but her.  It's tough watching Dumbo suffer ridicule and embarrass himself further by tripping over his big ears, suffer a cruel separation from his mother, and mope around with those tears spilling out of his big blue eyes, but I made it through all of that OK.  Then came the scene where he visits his mother in her solitary confinement.  If Leonard Maltin can admit that this film makes him cry every time he watches it, so can I.  I don't know how anyone can get through that visitation scene without shedding at least one tear.

I said the animation was relatively simplistic, but that does not mean it isn't spellbinding, nor does it mean you won't encounter any scenes that are rather stunning in detail.  Some of the professionals interviewed in a 15-minute featurette included on the DVD do a great job of pointing out the most remarkable scenes (and everyone has something to say about the Pink Elephant sequence, which is just bizarre and certainly memorable).  Other special features include an audio commentary by film historian John Canemaker, a short, one-minute introduction to the film by Walt Disney himself, a photo gallery of conception art and storyboards, a video of the song ""Baby Mine"" performed by Jim Brickman with Kassie DePalva, and two short cartoons, Elmer Elephant and The Flying Mouse.  Additional bonus materials aimed more specifically at young viewers are Sing Along Songs for Look Out for Mr. Stork and Casey Junior, a DVD storybook which children can read along with, and a ""My First Circus"" game that teaches children about the different kinds of animals normally found in a circus.

In a perfect world, Disney would just send a free copy of Dumbo to every set of parents in the country.  Since that isn't economically feasible, I hope that as many parents as possible do make Dumbo a part of their children's young lives.  This classic animated film is everything you would expect from Walt Disney - and more.",1148860800,,3893,4.659356725146199
298285,5,6300274195,"Dumbo has no big ambitions in story or art and was made with a mediocre budget.  Still, it's a timeless classic with a story that resonates just as effectively today as when first released in 1941.  Its charming characters will still bring audiences to tears and the music will stay with you long after the lights come back up.  This film is simply bursting with heart and soul.

Is there anyone who doesn't cry when Mrs. Jumbo, locked in her cell, cuddles and swings her Jumbo Jr.?  The sequence is a masterpiece.  Combining the psychological pain we feel at the separation of parent and child, a beautifully touching song and warm, subtle character animation.  But the truly amazing thing is that tucked into this unassuming little story is the highly imaginative pink elephant sequence, the greatly comic ""When I See An Elephant Fly"" and a few nods to German expressionism.  Quite a combination, and proof that Dumbo is much more than just a distraction for the kiddies.

Dumbo was not given the extensive restoration that Snow White was given a few years ago and a bit of dust and scratches are seen throughout the film.  But this is still the best the film has looked on home video.  In fact, it appears to be the same transfer from the 60th Anniversary DVD of 2002.  Even the menu screens are the same.  All that's been added are a few games for the younger set and a music video for ""Baby Mine""performed by Jim Brickman and Kassie DePriva.  Not included from the 60th Anniversary release are a music video for ""Baby Mine""  performed by Michael Crawford, two trailers and a segment from ""The Reluctant Dragon"" that explains how the Casey Junior voice was achieved.  Thankfully, the highly informative commentary by John Canemaker is included on this new release as well.

Also on this DVD are two animated shorts that pre-date Dumbo yet mirror some of its themes, and a 15 minute ""documentary"" that's really just myriad Disney alumni heaping praise on Dumbo.  It's always good to hear great things about Dumbo but something a bit more in-depth and behind the scenes would have been better.

All in all this is a very solid release of Dumbo that should not be passed up by anyone who missed out on the 60th anniversary release.  Its a film that the entire family will enjoy for many years to come.  For those that already have the 60th Anniversary edition, this Big Top edition doesn't add enough to justify the purchase.",1148860800,7,2426,4.6745283018867925
298286,5,6300274195,"For the first generation of Disney animated films the most emotional moment has been and will always be when Bambi's mother is shot.  Chandler Bing is correct, that all they did was ""stop drawing the deer,"" but that is why we talk about the magic of animation and movie making.  But the second most emotional film experience is the classic Disney collection has to be ""Dumbo,"" which also deals with the fear of being separated from your mother (albeit with a decidedly happier ending), but which deals as well with the pain of facing discrimination because of the way you look.  Consequently, this 1941 film has a couple of compelling universal themes.  Then you throw in some solid songs (including Disney does Dali with ""Pink Elephants on Parade"") and a colorful animated train to along with the cute title character and you have a real winner.  I assume I am preaching to the choir here, because it strikes me as silly to tell anybody what the story of ""Dumbo"" is about.  The question is whether you want to pick up this ""Big Top Edition"" DVD, which despite the price is only a single disc.

""Dumbo"" is only 64-minutes long, which RKO Radio Pictures thought was too short to release as an A picture, but then originally it was going to be a 30-minute featurette before it was expanded.  Along with ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,""  ""Dumbo"" is the only classic Disney film to use water colored backgrounds, which were less expensive than the gouache and oils used for both ""Pinocchio"" and ""Bambi.""  Since both ""Pinocchio"" and ""Fantasia"" were, believe it or not, failures at the box office initially and did not turn a profit until they were re-released.  ""Dumbo"" only cost $812,000 and by grossing over $2.5 million in its original release actually earned more than both ""Pinocchio"" and ""Fantasia"" combined in terms of their original grosses.  Ultimately the simplicity of both the story and the animation style contributed largely to the success of the film because it proved that a story is more important than creative animation (""Fantasia"" did not have an overriding narrative) and that that the characters matter more than the backdrop (the rainstorm in ""Bambi"" might be the crowning achievement of the studio in terms of drawing, but it is not as meaningful as the looks on the faces of Mrs. Jumbo and her baby in this movie).  So this might be the shortest of the Disney animated features, but in its own way it remains one of the most important.

There is almost a sense that the DVD extras threaten to overwhelm the simple little movie (notice you usually have to light up the magic feather to make selections).  There are a pair of Silly Symphonies that actually relate to the main feature, with 1936's ""Elmer Elephant,"" where we learn how you kiss if you have a trunk and what else big ears can be used besides flying, and 1934's ""The Flying Mouse,"" in which the original blue fairy grants a young mouse his wish about being able to fly (""I would like to be a bird, and go sailing through the sky"").  There are a pair of sing alongs with ""Look Out for Mr. Stork"" and ""Casey Junior"" (but not ""When I See an Elephant Fly""?).  There is a music video of Jim Brickman on piano and Kassie De Palva singing ""Baby Mine"" (replacing Michael Crawford from the 60th Anniversary Edition DVD of the film).  Adults can enjoy the audio commentary with animation historian John Canemaker, who details the history of the film and explains why it works.  After countless commentary tracks where actors are trying to remember what happened in the movie they are watching, it is great to hear somebody as well prepared as Canemaker, and if you want to know where you get your money's worth with this DVD, then I would say right here with what Canemaker provides.

But that does not matter, because of the scene where Dumbo goes to visit his mother when she is locked up as a ""Mad Elephant,"" and their trunks touch, and she cradles her baby in her trunk, you simply have to cry.  They did not need ""Baby Mine"" being sung in the background.  You can make the argument that Dumbo is the triumph of the underdog, which does for little boys what the story of the Ugly Duckling does for little girls (we are talking culturally, going back centuries and not about contemporary gender issues).  Cinderella just has to become a princess to live happily ever after, but Dumbo has to win the respect of the other elephants by doing something and the important lesson is that he does not change his appearance.  The fact that Dumbo does not have to change makes it a valuable lesson for all youngsters.  The only educational downside here is that the magic flower is revealed to be a placebo, which is not exactly a card in the parental deck that you necessarily want the kiddies to understand at too young of an age.",1148774400,,4799,4.624263839811543
298287,4,6300274195,"I had to scratch my head when I saw that Disney was re-releasing ""Dumbo"" at the end of this month. The 60th anniversary edition pretty much covered the gamut of bonus features and improved animation. What could possibly be done on this new version? Not much.

The story of a baby elephant named Dumbo with big ears who is treated as if he was freak by the other elephants remains timeless as ever. With the help of his mouse friend Timothy, Dumbo comes to terms with his unique physical appearance and eventually comes to appreciate his rather large ears. After all these years, I still enjoy ""Dumbo"" as much as I did the first time I saw it in elementary school. I still get all choked up when Dumbo goes to visit his mother which is very sweet yet sad. ""Baby Mine"" still gets to me after all these years.

This version of ""Dumbo"" is definitely geared more towards the younger generation with the games & activities, music, and bonus shorts. Is this worth $29.99? Not really but if you get it a cheaper cost, then it is worth it for your kids. The 60th anniversary edition is much better for adults who want to own this classic animated film.",1148774400,4,1143,4.438095238095238
298288,5,6300274195,"I, like many, grew up watching ""Dumbo"" over and over again. It was one of those movies that you never could enough of and, at a little over an hour in running time -making it Disney's shortest full length feature- time truly flew while you were enjoying it. Today, it's been 65 years since the movie's release and the emotions it stirs remain intact.

As for the extras included in the DVD, I found the audio commentary just as useful and enlightening (in terms of information about the people making the movie) as the 14-minute long featurette ""Celebrating Dumbo"", which was more like a promotional piece than an in-depth look at the making of the film. There is also a couple of fun pre-Dumbo shorts, ""Elmer Elephant"" and ""Flying Mouse"". Most of the bonus features are designed for children, including sing-along songs from the movie, a read-along storybook titled ""Dumbo's Big Discovery"" and a fun Disneypedia game called ""My First Circus"".

In all honesty it doesn't seem to offer much more than the 60th Anniversary Edition released five years ago. I can't see enough justification for this release. However, a classic is a classic, so those who didn't get the previous edition, get this one. You will be delighted.

Hilarious, tender and exhilirating, this tale of a young elephant made an outcast because of the enormous size of his ears - and the legendary turn of events that puts Dumbo's persecutors firmly in their place - is one of the greatest Disneys, with superb classic animation and great, offbeat music.  The scenes of Dumbo's gentle mother trying to soothe her befuddled offspring and shelter him from the world's mocking, ostracizing ways are a wonderfully moving touch, and the ending is glorious.

The storyline is simple: a baby elefant (Dumbo) gets separated from his mother, and he works his way through obstacles with the help of his mouse-friend (Timothy), to get his mom back.

The animation from 1941 couldn't be more basic: simple figures, pastel backgrounds most of the time -nothing fancy. Yet the combination of it all, with some classic music tracks and unforgettable lines, make out of ""Dumbo"" a movie for the ages, one that has survived time, and that will continue to appeal to everyone no matter how old, no matter when.

It's Disney's shortest animated movie.  However, it is also the most beautiful and tear jerking, bar none. Even a heart of stone would melt upon viewing Dumbo with his mother, especially the ""Baby Mine"" sequence.

The art is breathtaking, soft, and for the most part, simple. However, it does have it's terrifying and scary moments, especially the ""Pink Elephants On Parade"" sequence.  Beautifully drawn, and yet, very Daliesque and scary.

The story also contains some very politically incorrect images, but removing or re editing them would completely destroy the film.  Thank God Disney has not even tried.

Besides, I look at it this way. The crows eventually befriended Dumbo, and give him encouragement instead of hate and negativity. Social outcasts embracing a social outcast.

In any case, the movie, as short as it is, is still a classic and is worth owning if you are into Disney films and have kids.  Even though it lacks the adult humor and sophistication of today's modern animation and certainly isn't as polished the modern computer aided visuals are, the writing, especially in the movies songs, is well done and allows the movie to stand as solid entertainment.

The sequence Pink Elephants on Parade is perhaps one of animations greatest ever, and its dated art, while placing it the period it was done, is still outstanding and worth the price of admission by itself.  The crows singing about never seeing an elephant fly is another great musical sequence.

I know the graphical Disney movies today are much brighter and colorful , but something about those old water painted cells is more appealing to me.

Anyway, Dumbo is a wonderful tale of dealing with the grief of being ostracized. Dumbo is a classic protagonist who deals with so much that it is very hard for even an adult to hold back their tears at the end of the movie. People keep complaining about the Pink Elephant scene and the Crowes. Well, it is a fact of life that people drink and this could be used to educate a child. The Crowes are stereotyped of course, but yes most black people did talk that way back then. The point of the whole Crowes scene is too show that African Americans can relate to Dumbo better than anyone because they too had also been mistreated in society.

(OR ANYOTHER SCENE because I remember crying when I was a little kid when Dumbo goes in a different cage than his mom on the circuis train and they get separated).
Anyways, about that scene. why does it last so long? was it like an inside joke to all the older viewers? i think this movie was the origin of the timeless hallucination of pink elephants. it is so trippy like when the elephants combine and they shoot into the sky or something like that and everything turns into fire works.

Yea, a member of the PC police wrote a review saying they'd ban there kid from watching this cruel, insensitive, irresponsible cartoon.  Here's a list of why this film is a great opportunity to entertain AND educate your kids;

EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES
-You can use this film to discuss how cruel teasing can affect others.  The teasers are THE BAD GUYS!!
-Point out how hurtful behaving in an exclusive manner can be.
-Discuss how ""Dumbo"" perseveres despite the opinions of others.
-IF they ask, point out how bad things CAN happen when you use drugs or alcohol.
-Talk about how cultural sensitivities have changed since the 1940s. (The crows stereotyped as ""blacks"" are actually pretty shameful.  I don't point this out because my kids don't get it.)

ENTERTAIN
-extremely pure and simple story.  Kids love this film.
-""Casey Junior"" song stick in your brain.  My 20 month old is enthralled by the train.
-""Elephants on Parade"" is a real ""Trip"".  It is more remarkable when you consider the lack of computer technology at the time.
-The faceless ""roust-abouts"" are a little creepy, but my kids survived.
-The ending is as sugar-coated as you would ever want, which is why people love this film.

DVD
-Totally re-mastered.  Flawless.
-2 shorts related to flying and elephants are ok.
-Black and White Sound stage clip from ""The Reluctant Dragon"" is pretty cool.
-Enough extras for a couple of hours.

I think the main take-away from this review is that;
-you can choose to protect your kids from everything
 or
-you can teach them how to cope with salutations that they will inevitably encounter.

I certainly would not ban my kids from seeing an imaginative art piece like ""Dumbo"".  In the famous words of Dori in ""Finding Nemo""...  ""If you don't let anything happen to him, then nothing will happen to him.  Not much fun for little Elmo"".",1076371200,4,1940,4.795180722891566
298501,5,6300274195,"For me, the most interesting thing about ""Dumbo"" is it's history. It was made during the war and Walt needed something that was inexpensive to make, so he bought the rights to the children's book of the same name. The film is only 64 minuites long, but if it where any longer,it would get boring. What's trueley remarkable about ""Dumbo"" is that the main character never talks, but is able to express so much emotion. The scene where Mrs. Jumbo is cradeling Dumbo with her trunk from inside her jail cell is one of the most touching moments in Disney history. The picture and sound is restored and the special features are pretty good. I wish it would have gotten a 2-disc release because I know Disney has more content in there vaults that they could have filled up another disc with. And the work in progress trailor for ""Dumbo 2"" disturbes me. I wish Disney wouldn't make sequels to films Walt made.",1074729600,,901,4.533742331288344

Oh, for those new to the film, for the scene in which Dumbo's mother is imprisoned...bring Kleenex. Coupled with the song, 'Baby Mine', it's truly heart-breaking.
TRANSFER: Outstanding. A rich and vibrant animated picture that completely captures the spirit and vitality of the subject. There is a bit of film grain present and some minor age related artifacts. Also, some edge enhancement does crop up now and then - but these do not detract from the visual presentation. Colors are solid and vibrant. Contrast levels are bang on. The audio has been remastered and remixed and is very nicely spread out over all your speakers.
EXTRAS: A making-of, some short subjects and a theatrical trailer. All-in-all, great good fun.
BOTTOM LINE: ""Dumbo"" is a family classic. It sparkles with the kind of innocence and mastery of the craft of animation that is sadly lacking in Disney's current crop of feature films.",1072915200,,1218,4.946341463414634

I can understand why parents of younger children(7 and under) would not want them to watch Dumbo, although the movie is a classic and it is an amazing experience to go back and look at the old animation and compare it to today's standards. I actually wrote an english paper on this movie this year- comparing my views on it from when I was little to my current age. NOTE TO CONCERNED PARENTS- I owned Dumbo when I was little (I'm 19..so...) and I only remembered the vaguest parts of it- I knew his mom tried to protect him and got taken away, he learned to fly with a feather, he made friends with a mouse, and I remembered the creep pink elephants he sees. Other than that- nothing. As long as you watch it with them and say, ""Thats not very nice of them is it? What would you say?""

  At the 1947 Cannes Film Festival DUMBO won the Palm D'Or.  Not too shabby.  Even though the animated classic was 5 years old at that time it was still honored.  I believe that the French judges wanted to catch up on all of the films they would have recognized had not a little thing called WWII begun on the eve of the first scheduled Cannes Film Festival, causing it to be sort of postponed (yet another decent thing those wretched goose-steppers messed up!).

298557,5,6300274195,"'Dumbo' is one of my all-time favorite Disney classics. It's timeless! Everytime I watch it the story never gets old. There isn't another sweeter movie to match it. It's a darling story of how a little elephant with unusally big ears finds that no matter how unique you are you're always have a purpose in life.  Who says that a character gotta speak in an animated film or any film for that matter? It's the emotion and facial expressions that speak louder than words. The innocence and sentiment surpasses it peers to a priceless treasure. You'll fall in love with the characters Dumbo and his circus companion, Timothy Q. Mouse. Other highlights of the movie is the scenes with the Crows and the music score (won an Academy Award in 1942 for Best Music Score), ""When I see an Elephant Fly"" sung by the Hall Johnson Choir, the pink elephant (could this be an 1941 anti-alcohol message?). You'll find yourself shedding a tear to ""Baby Mine"" (nominated for an Academy Award in 1942 for best song). If not, I pronounce you clinically brain dead. I always feel lulled into a calm state-of-mind every time I hear it. Try it sometime! In my honest opinion, the Top 10 all-time greatest Disney classics would be: 1. Dumbo, 2. Mary Poppins, 3. The Jungle Book, 4. Winnie the Pooh, 5. Pochantas, 6. Tarzan, 7. The Lion King, 8. Lady and the Tramp, 9. The Love Bug, 10. Fantasia.",1062115200,4,1371,4.595918367346939
298558,5,6300274195,"I am really not sure where to begin writing a decent sophisticated review with proper transitions, etc. ya da ya da- but I got to open up and say I LOVE this movie! It is quite possibly my favorite movie period. I am 17 and I have loved this movie for as long as I can remember; it's even better now, because I am old enough to appreciate its wonderful messages and morals. It's an anti-animal cruelty flick seen from the animals' point of view and pointing out the ignorance of the humans, and a realistic depiction of how cruel and unjust the world can be, and what can be done to overcome despite it all. Anyway, for those of you who aren't familiar with the plot (get your heads out of your rears and watch this, PLEASE) it's the story of a baby elephant delivered to Jumbo on a circus train from a stork. He is immediately derided by the fellow elephants and human audience because of his oversized ears. The only ones who who show any compassion are his mother Jumbo, and his friends-a mouse named Timothy and a flock of crows who give him support and encouragement.
I love the cleverness and depth of this movie- the mother and friends that stick up for him even if it results in sacrifices for themselves (Jumbo being confined from the other elephants for ""disorderly conduct""), the loving bond between mother and son, and the anti-discrimination messages. By the way, this movie isn't racist, I know for a fact that it's ANTI-racist (uncountable reasons why that would require an entire separate review) and the crow scene was not intended to demean black culture but embrace it, (with a black cast); many people misread the content and took it the wrong way, seeing as most things at the time were condemnable and ignominious. Pretty outstanding for 1941 when there was still so much bigotry in the US. The same thing happened with the 1942 cartoon ""Coal Black the Seven Dwarfs"". And the ""Roustabouts"" scene wasn't bigoted, either. It's just a fact that in those days it was common for brothers to be willing to take the [bad] jobs if better ones weren't available, am I right? I am black myself telling you all of this, so does that make any of this more convincing? I'm not nave and I discern racism when I see it. The completely different selection of writers and blackless cast for the monkey scene in the Jungle Book, however, is an entirely different situation, but lets not get into that. If you are one of the neurotically oversensitive people who DO thing this movie's racist, your kids won't know anyway unless you rub it in their faces; you're only aggravating things.
Anyway, the parts of the movie that will delight people of all ages are the quaint and adorable animation of the animals and the classic catchy songs. My faves are the cute ""Look Out For Mr. Stork"", the clever pun-filled soul song ""When I See An Elephant Fly"", the hypnotic ""Elephants On Parade"", the catchy tunes ""Casey Junior"" and ""Roustabouts""... they're all so good. The few good characters are lovable- benevolent Jumbo, cute little Dumbo/Jumbo Jr., the witty and hilarious (and cute may I add-I love cartoon birds) crows, the charismatic Timothy, and ""good ol'"" Mr. Stork. I detest the rest of the characters. The heartless elephants, that awful red-haired kid teasing Jumbo Jr., the selfish Mussoliniesque circus trainer who had disregard for the well-being and proper husbandry of the animals, and the *cough* clowns. Those are the most hideous clowns I have ever seen and have lurked in my nightmares as a child. What I also don't like about this film are the alcohol/drug references, anti or not. Although it may not do too much harm being that to the younger naive audience it will have no significance and to the older audience simply amusing and humorous, I still find the idea of an infant elephant getting drunk in a children's movie a little disturbing. And that psychedelic pink elephant scene- try and tell me that there weren't stoners involved in the writing and production of that part of the movie. As a little kid I thought it was entertaining on the eyes, now it makes me laugh, but I still can't help but wonder why that didn't frighten me as a small child. And how the neglecting elephants all of sudden started respecting Dumbo just because he was famous? That always made me outraged.
Despite of the film's few blunders, there are many times more good qualities that could make me care less. This movie literally is a classic.",1062028800,2,4444,4.662420382165605
298559,5,6300274195,"Ok I grew up with this movie, meaning I can't remember a time when I did NOT know this movie. The people who talk about racism, I had to stop and read to even know what they were talking about!
For one thing, the song Roustabouts? The people were all black? I for one couldn't tell, it was nighttime and everything was dark! I never thought they were all black. And the lyrics in the song are racist and demeaning? I don't know about you but to this day I can barely tell what they're saying! The lyrics always seemed quite garbled and unintelligible to me. I always just thought it was a cool-sounding song that went along to the beat of them hammering in the tent stakes. I hardly think any child is going to hear this song and pick up a racist attitude. I certainly didn't, and I was not an unintelligent child.
And as for the crows, I NEVER connected them with black people when I was a child. They were CROWS. I remember thinking that they were musicians, but I never stared at the screen and thought, ""Oh, those crows are supposed to be like black people! Black people all smoke cigars and wear striped shirts!"" I think people are reading too far into it and assuming too much about the connections their children will make. Children will not view cartoons with a racist attitude, especially if it is animals and not people that are being depicted.
Dumbo has some wonderful lessons in it. The film is certainly not PRO animal cruelty, it is most obviously against it. Children viewing it will learn to treat animals kindly because it shows them with feelings and emotions. Poor little Dumbo crying after his mother is taken away never fails to choke me up. The scenes of Dumbo's mother being whipped and locked up are heart-wrenching, but I think children need to be exposed to things like that. Life is hard and without a concept of how difficult life can be, how will they ever grow up with any sense of reality?
The sequence where Timothy brings Dumbo to visit his mother in her cage is so touching, I cannot watch it without getting tears in my eyes, and movies rarely make me cry. Just thinking about it makes me misty. It would make anyone appreciate having a loving mother.
Dumbo is a great movie for children, it is loaded with morals and important life lessons and I can't imagine why anyone would not want to let their child view it.",1061424000,2,2349,4.439814814814815
298560,2,6300274195,We ranked this 32 out of the 41 Disney animated movies that we own.  The best moment was the crows.  The writers just piled to much misery onto poor dumbo.,1060646400,3,155,4.133333333333334
298561,5,6300274195,"Lets cover some basics-
As per the whole drunken scene- its SUPPOSED to be scarey- that teaches children the negative aspects of alcohol and alcoholism *the mean and stupid drunk clowns*, and the predicament that accidentally getting drunk that landed dumbo in a TREE... the elephants were meant to scare children, just as much as a description of a bad acid trip or how any drug ruins the body used by programs such as DARE is meant to scare children- so it stays in their mind and they understand the consequences of irresponsibility.
So the crows are racist because... they talked with a slight southern accent, had an ""black"" voice, and were not the most fluent in proper English|American speach?  Have you- I don't know, visited the south ever? Do  you have any clue how People in GENERAL talked in the late 1800's and early 1900's? Understand slang, or colloquialisms, or dialect differences of those times? Apparently NOT. It seems to me that you have made the assumption all on your own that the crows MUST be Negro because- they are unlearned and crows are- black. Your association is ""Black""- your childs association is- Crow, of course you could push your own odd mentality on your kid by telling them that the crows ARE black and they ARE making fun of or belittling people of darker skin tones... but more than likely your three year old doesn't even notice colour, and won't until you start throwing it in his face. For what it's worth, I live in Mobile Alabama, I was born and raised in Boston *My husband is serving in the USCG*, if anything I'd say ""yep the crows are southern""- because guess what, people here- still talk like that, and this state is by far primarily ""White"". I notice no one mentioned the men working in the rain- but those voices were of a ""coloured"" choir too- so I guess then that says that ""Blacks""- ahh- get the job done? The crows are some of the nicest most friendly charachters in the film. In many ways, the crows are Dumbo's saving grace, giving him the ""magic feather"" and thus the confidence to fly, and he doesn't forget them in the end. The crows wouldn't be at all half the awesome charachters they are if it weren't for the ""Black"" voices behind them. They were full of soul and really uplifting- perhaps that's why Jim Charmicheal and the Hall choir were chosen- because they brought the charachters to life and could make people sing and smile.
Now lets talk about the potential for reverse racism, the crows ONE ""negative"" quality is their speach (personally I think they speak better English than President Bush does!), yet the cruel men in the film, the ringmaster, the clowns, the little boys who torment baby dumbo- they are all White. They are the depictions of negative human qualities. The ringleader is a power hungry, abusive, calculating, cold hearted animal abuser and neglecter... and also abusive in his treatment of his workers. The clowns are lazy drunks who lack complete regard for the lives of animals- shoving dumbo out a window. And what about the other elephants, those female- uppercrust meanies- there's some nice ""white"" voices for you. They were realll sweethearts. When you look at the facts more like that it starts to look more like those poor poor Negros who are regarded as dumb- aren't really the focus of this movie at all. *Gasp shock* what a novel notion- a Disney movie that isn't racist and it isn't a movie that is going to scar all children. You can use this movie like many other Disney films to teach children many many important life lessons- but that would mean  you'd have to do more with the tv set than use it as a babysitting device for your kid.",1060300800,25,3647,4.642414860681114

Also so what if the Black Crows sounded like Black People that does not make Disney a racist lol , I mean did not the Black Crows turn out to be good and help Dumbo ? hmmmmmm ? Well then so if they where supposed to be like Black People then Disney was making these certain Black People out to be good and helpful, so if anything Disney was saying that there are a lot of good Black People > Anyways, I have always liked this movie as a Child but never owned it until it this Special Dvd came out > I like the message about this baby Elephant with a so called birth defect being good and coming out a winner , just because he was different other did not like him, even though he was so innocent , to me this movie has wonderful messages and I don't see that this movie gives Glory to racism or cruel animal treatment at all >",1055980800,,2577,3.994186046511628

298631,5,6300274195,"Dumbo, the fourth movie of the Disney Canon, is one of the Disney classics that everyone should watch and own.
The story is timeless.  A baby elephant with unusually large ears is born in a circus.  Everyone thinks his ears are funny, except the baby, Jumbo Jr, who is cruelly nicknamed ""Dumbo"", his mother, and a mouse.  The mouse tries to make him popular, with very unfortunate results.  The mouse and the baby elephant crawl away from that disaster and into another one - they get slightly intoxicated!  But whatever Jumbo Jr dreamt turns into his triumph - it is thru his dream that he finds out he can use his ears to fly!  He returns to the circus determined to use his newfound ability to show everyone that he can be a valuable member of the elephant herd.  And, of course, he succeeds.
This movie takes you back to the days when circuses really did travel mostly by rail from town to town and created huge sensations when they arrived.  The tenderness between Dumbo and his mother are priceless.  The scenes of Mrs. Jumbo rioting in the circus when her baby seems threatened are fairly true to life.  The unlikely friendship between Timothy and Dumbo teaches us to work together no matter who or what we are.  One of the more interesting facts about this movie is that the main character, Dumbo, never speaks.  He gets all of his emotions across with a look or a gesture.  That makes his character stronger.
This tale teaches courage in the face of failure, loyalty in the face of adversity, and a triumph of a handicap over the troubles of life.  In just 64 minutes, the shortest Disney feature length animated movie, the Disney animators give us a story that will stand up to any that has been made then or since.
The animation is simplistic, but fun.  This movie had to be made on a shoestring budget due to the upcoming war.  And the fact that the Disney studios had yet to get out of the red, despite the critical success of Snow White and Pinocchio made it even harder to get this movie to the theaters.  Fantasia did not make money for the studio by itself until the 1969 re-release!
The colors are very vibrant and eye-catching.  It looks a lot more like a cartoon, but with the famous Disney eye for detail.  The ""Pink Elephant"" sequence will have you wondering what the Disney animators were thinking of - it is probably the most memorable animated sequence of all time, and also serves as a great anti-alcohol message.  Watch this sequence carefully - it switches from almost surrealistic to realistic to three dimensional to almost psychedelic and back again in just a few minutes.
The 60th anniversary DVD contains some cool extras - including concept art that has never been released before, the origin and history of Dumbo, a couple sing along songs, an animated short or two, and other goodies.  It also includes a sneak peek at the upcoming ""Dumbo II"".
This movie should be on everyone's DVD shelf, even if you don't have children of your own.  Great for grandkids and the whole family.",1047081600,13,3013,4.582089552238806
298632,5,6300274195,"Why am I not surprised that there is someone reviewing this classic who trashes it as if they had never seen it and were offended by the cultural sensitivity issues that are part of the film.  (See the Tallahassee reviewer titled ""Do not purchase this video for children"" January 21, 2003)  For crying out loud, this script reflects what was normal at the time the film was first released.  It's full of classic pieces that of course include a white dominated societal commentary on what was perceived as appropriate black cultural roots at that time.  Is it outdated?  Sure, so is nearly every other film from that era.  Does this make it less of a classic?  Absolutely not.  In fact, this is the *real* Disney, long before it was sanitized for the Anaheim-Orlando crowd.  Is the film inappropriate for a 21st century kid?  That's a parental decision, but if you plan to shelter your child from the real history of the U.S., they will have a rude awakening (with all the accompanying psychoses) that you *won't* be able to control.  My kids loved this film when they were very young.....we talked about the cultural issues by the time they were in school.....in fact, I distinctly remember them coming home to ask why some kids treated others so badly because of the color of their skin, their accents, etc.  We used Dumbo to show them what used to be, was is today, and how to deal with it.  And there was never a place where the original empathy of the film was lost on them.  They have repeatedly made personal decisions and stood up against improper cultural slurs their entire lives (they are all either in college or their final years of high school now).  I've been pleased with how they can see a cultural slur coming and are not willing to put up with any of the culturally ""acceptable"" ways of trashing others' ethnicity.
Now, what about the film?  This is a great Disney classic from the days when there was a full bodied, earthy smell to what they did.  It's release in this format provides a historical window on American culture from the 1950s that is true and clear.  It loses nothing in the 21st century translation and in fact, gains considerably from it's historical context.

As a side note, the much-maligned Jim Crow sequence, while no doubt perpetuating stereotypes, casts the crows in a sympathetic light, for despite their initial playfulness, they're the only characters besides Timothy Mouse to believe in little Dumbo.

There are many distressing scenes as other reviewers have said, but what really bothers my husband more so than me, is that for e.g. in the roustabouts song where they set up the circus, and in the scene where they tie up Dumbo's mommy, the African American roustabouts are not considered worthwhile of being depicted with facial features.  I guess it reflects the times when the movie was made.  You would watch this with the same advisorys as reading Mark Twain.  Its a lovely song, and
overall the movie has the opposite message, of being tolerant to differences in features/characteristics because everyone is special.
I love this movie and always watch with my son, and in the fire scene I explain that they are clowns and pretending, though Dumbo doesn't want to be a clown.  Luckily, from the Baby Newton DVD, he already had a much more positive image of clowns. So he seems to be able to understand that its supposed to be funny, though we empathize with Dumbo and rather want to cry.  As for the elephants crashing scene etc. well, I can only say that building and breaking up tall towers, crashing cars, etc is a favorite toddler activity :-)  And Mommy here always gets a snuggle kiss for the Baby Mine song.

The Disney animators were brilliant in storyboarding and animating all these characters in the setting of a traveling circus. Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo (Dumbo's mother) were persecuted because he was different. Being different was scorned and teased and tortured at this circus. What was different about Dumbo? He had overly large ears.
Thanks to one friend, a small mouse, with the spirit and attitude of a major general, Dumbo learns his value, his importance to his mother and what it means to have a true friend. This movie was very special. It has heart and feeling and the most emotive Disney animated character ever that actually never says a word.
The DVD extras on this release are one of the best of the Disney series; it includes a retrospective history of the making and the design of the film with some of the original artists and Roy Disney himself.

And I definitely agree that adults, esp. parents or those with a maternal streak will cry at ""Baby Mine"" and also when Dumbo first arrives and his mom wants to protect him from the jeering of the other elephants.

  Dumbo is Walt Disney's third film.  This sweet and sugary tale of a baby elephant with awfully big ears who could fly was a sensational hit.  It was also the very first animated feature to have the background painted in watercolor.  So, sweet this movie is, it drifts off into a childish whimsy the young can truly enjoy. There is not much plot, but adults will shed a tear when Dumbo's caged mother takes out her trunk through the window, to rock her sweet baby. A very tender moment in Disney history that has been and will be appreciated in years to come.",1023840000,,621,4.473214285714286

Mrs. Jumbo, a circus elephant, has been hoping for a baby to love for a long time; finally, the stork arrives with the little bundle of joy - who is adorable, but has very big ears.  He becomes the laughing stock of all the other elephants, but his mother sees only her beautiful baby.  The time comes when she must protect Dumbo, is misjudged, and put in the jail-wagon.  As she reaches her trunk through the window bars to console and rock her sobbing infant, and sings a heartwrenching lullaby, you'll undersand why Disney was such a great movie maker (bring your hankie!)

298709,5,6300274195,"This is without doubt one of the finest films to come out of Disney ever. Short(only 64 minutes long), but very to the point, and always pulling those heart strings. This is one of those rare films that makes me cry every time I watch it, and if you don't get all misty during the visit at the train car scene with Mrs. Jumbo, you need to seek professional help.
What moves me the most are two things: the special bond between mother and child, and Dumbo being an outcast because of his appearance. Being a tall person, I always stand out in a crowd, and that's not always been pleasant. I have tremendous love and respect for my mother, and it would hurt me terribly to have her removed from me, so I'm deeply moved by the whole film, even thought I know it's all just fantasy. But, isn't that what all film is? Fantasy?
This is just a short, sweet film with a whole lot of heart that proves that all is needed is a story, and believable charactors to fall in love with, and care for, and cheer for.

It's a beautifully animated film, with a message that speaks to us all--just because some folks may consider you ""different"" doesn't mean that you are worthless.
Baby elephant Dumbo's big ears, along with his ruining a circus act, relegate him to the lowest rung of the totem pole--he's now a clown, and the other elephants won't even consider Dumbo one of ""them.""  When Dumbo's mother tries to stick up for her baby, she is labled ""wild,"" and chained up, isolated from everyone.
Dumbo makes one friend, Timothy the Mouse, who helps Dumbo realize that he can make a contribution--those big ears, the cause of so much scorn and derision, allow Dumbo to fly.  None of the other elephants can do that, and in the end, Dumbo triumphs, showing everyone that he really isn't ""different"" after all.  He is reunited with his mother, and is the star of the show.

This is a must for Disney collector's and even if you aren't, this movie is excellent for children.  My 6 year old neice loved it.

He starts to shead tears, and the audience uproars with laughter.  When I rented the 50th anniversary edition, I knew why the general cried.  I did the same, and then I started laughing, too.
Here is a movie for all ages.  It hasn't dated over the years, which makes it perfect.  The message is clear - inner strength, friendship, and love conquers all.  The ""Pink Elephants"" and ""Baby Mine"" scenes are still classics.  The most touching scene in movie history, of course, is when Jumbo Jr. sees his mother in jail, and the song, ""Baby Mine"", is played.
Although FANTASIA, SNOW WHITE, PINOCCHIO, and LION KING are much better animated films from Disney, DUMBO tugs more at the heart.

The jacket promises a preview of Dumbo II. There is no preview on the DVD we received. We are bitterly disappointed, since this was the reason we bought a redundant copy.
Furthermore, the ""Celebrating Dumbo"" featurette is just a bunch of young Disney employees making vapid comments about what a great movie Dumbo is. None of them have any connection to the original production, so they were incapable of showing any insight into the making of Dumbo. Now, I admit that we had just viewed the featurette for Snow White, which is undeniably awesome. By comparison, the Dumbo featurette is a content-free failure.
Dumbo on DVD supports 5.1 surround sound, but--compared to the masterful remastering of, say, Snow White--there's not much advantage over the remastering of the VHS version.
Too bad Disney couldn't give Dumbo the attention it gave Snow White. If you have Dumbo on VHS, don't bother with the DVD. [...]

298764,5,6300274195,"It is the shortest film, and cheapest made, by Disney; and yet, ""Dumbo"", released in 1941, was then, and remains now, among the best of the best to come out of Walt Disney.  It was made for under one million dollars, and with very little of the film  to reshoot, it did not take long to produce.
Dumbo is the proud baby elephant of Mrs. Jumbo, a circus elephant.  He is given the name Jumbo Jr., but later, as a cruel joke, by the other elephants in the circus, acquires the name Dumbo.  By the end of the film, he wears this name with pride.  Before then, however, the name of Dumbo haunts him, and causes him no end of grief and trouble.
The cause for Dumbo's misfortune becomes clear when he sneezes, the force of which causes his ears to pop open.  Immediately we see these ears are abnormally large.  As the other elephants start to laugh, Mrs. Jumbo shelters her baby in her arms.  When some children pass by Dumbo and begin making thoughtless remarks about his ears, and begin to tug on them, quite violently, Mrs. Jumbo's anger errupts.  She assults one of the children.  The circus people rush to the scene and quickly remove her.  She is placed in a cage, seperated from Dumbo.  Alone, and scared, Dumbo befriends an unlikely character - a mouse named Timothy.
When the circus people discover how large Dumbo's ears are, they decide to make him into a clown.  They drink to their success, during which a bottle of champaign is knocked into a water bucket.  This is unknown to Dumbo and Timothy when they drink from the bucket.  Dumbo suffers a bizarre nightmare, and awakes to find himself, and Timothy, high atop a tree.
In trying to figure out how they got up there, Timothy strikes upon the idea that Dumbo flew.  Some crows nearby take an interest in these two, and break out into song, singing a delightful tune ""When I see an elephant fly"".
Of course this is too much for Dumbo, and he can't bring himself to believe he can actually fly.  However, Timothy coaxes him to trying to fly.  Timothy also gives Dumbo a ""magic"" feather, which he says will allow him to fly as long as he holds on to it.  Low and behold, the feather seems to work; for Dumbo is flying!
Now that Dumbo can fly, apparently through the power of the feather, what are the circus people to do with him?  What are they to make of him?  And will the other elephants begin to show him more respect, and stop taunting him?
""Dumbo"" is a story many of us can relate to, especially for those of us who have been taunted and teased during some dark time in our lives for a particular ""flaw"" we might have upon our person; something which others find to be worth attacking and critizing.  Dumbo perseveres, and he shows us we can too.  He also shows us that we need not hide our flaws, but wear them openly, with pride.",1005955200,5,2796,4.375968992248062
298765,4,6300274195,"This sweet animated film (only 64 minutes long) is truly a Disney treasure. The simple story is about a little elephant that just doesn't fit in because of his freakishly large ears. Timothy, a little circus mouse, befriends Dumbo and sees only beauty in his new friend. Dumbo entertains us, as well as teaches us a timeless lesson about love and tolerance in a world that is often times unkind and cruel. The animation is rather simple as compared to the detail found in Snow White or Pinocchio, but it somehow works because of the film's other strengths. In Dumbo your emotions run the full spectrum from laughter to tears. The musical numbers are memorable, especially ""Baby Mine"". Baby Mine is a tearjerker if ever there was one. The crows add great comic relief toward the end of the film. The Special Bonus Features on the DVD are a real nice touch and generous. Among the extras are a ""Celebrating Dumbo"" featurette, two animated shorts, and a Music Video of ""Baby Mine"" sung by Michael Crawford that will have you sobbing all over again, guaranteed! The only complaint I have was mentioned by other reviewers, that being the grainy quality of the film. This flaw simply does not make any sense. I would have expected that Disney, promoting Dumbo as the ""60th Anniversary Edition"", would have bothered to restore the picture and audio elements. The DVD back cover makes claims to Dumbo being digitally restored and remastered with a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, but it certainly is not evident to me.

The film transfer is fantastic considering this movie is 60 years old. The digital remastering was very well done and is up to par with Snow White and Fantasia. The 5.1 Dolby track really shines and the audio has a spacious feel and is very clean. The sub-woofer and rears are used a few times as well. The additional content is nice and is above the Gold Edition standard. Since it is a single disc it does not have the wealth of material that Snow White has but does contain a great deal.

Both my husband and I recall being frightened by the ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" as young children---you must admit the worms and skeletal elephants are a little weird.  The rest of the movie is wonderful--the characters, songs, moral and story---but THAT part just doesn't seem to fit in with the rest, and unfortunately, causes us to shy away from adding Dumbo to our Disney collection.",1004400000,4,619,4.669724770642202
298829,5,6300274195,"The simple, straightforward story of Dumbo (or more accurately, Jumbo Jr.) still has the power to move audiences even after 60 years.  All of us have felt like Jumbo Jr. at some point (if not all through) our lives.  We are also hard wired to protect and care for our young so when Mrs. Jumbo fights for her son, we automatically empathise for her as well.  This film works on all levels from art direction, color, mood, animation, character design score and song to the bizzare set piece ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" that dazzilingly displays the artists talents (in my opinion, one of the greatest segments ever animated).  Truly a Disney treasure and one that everyone from 3 to 103 can enjoy over and over again.
Thankfully this DVD presentation gives you many reasons to do just that.  The film has been lovingly restored and looks more bright and colorful than ever!  There are 2 very entertaining Silly Symphonies included (Elmer the Elephant / the Flying Mouse) that show Walt's early attempts at animating elephants and the themes that would eventually make their way into Dumbo.  The video of Michael Crawford singing 'Baby Mine' is painful however and should be skipped (both Barbara Cook and Bonnie Rait have done much better work with this song).  The 'Celebrating Dumbo' Featurette is very quick and light hearted with no real information on the making of the film, just peoples ideas and feelings about it.  If you want a more detailed and comprehensive look at it's creation check out the commentary which gives you plenty of new information and insight.  Also the conceptual drawings are fun to scroll through.
This is what I expect from a special edition DVD.  The film has been beautifully restored and there are many worthwhile extras all packed onto one disc.  And I haven't even mentioned the Casey Jr. train!  Each DVD comes with a cardboard pop out that can be folded in to the train for display.  It's touches like these that put this DVD over the top.  The film itself more than justifies the purchase, but the (mosttly terrific) bonus material certainly sweetens the deal.

298830,5,6300274195,"What's amazing about Disney's 4th feature, ""Dumbo"", is that it is probably one of the most simple looking animated features of all time, yet it is one of the best. Proving that even the most detailed art is not required to carry a movie, most of the films backgrounds and characters are not as intricate and detailed as ""Snow White"" or ""Pinocchio"", they are VERY simple. ""Dumbo"" instead relys on a good story, that I'm sure you are fimiliar with. A simple, but rich 64 minutes telling the story of a baby elephant with big ears, that is an outcast. The reason that this movie has lasted for so long, aside from being Disney, is that everyone can relate to it, as said throughout the disc's extras and commentary.
The DVD has a good Dolby Digital 5.1 mix, but I was rather disappointed with the picture quality. It claims to have a remastered picture, but there is so much grain, and dirt throughout the feature. After what Disney DVD did for ""Snow White"", I was expecting a little more for this release. The extras are great: the commentary is very informative, the concept arts are interesting, and ""Celebrating Dumbo"" is a good enough featurette. The only negative is that Disney Co. is continuing to ruin the classics, by attaching unnecessary sequels. Inferior by existing Disney video sequel reputation, ""Dumbo II"" is on it's way.
""Dumbo"", costing only $800,000, saved Disney from the WWII-caused financial failures of ""Pinocchio"" and ""Fantasia"". So it is one of the important stepping blocks of Disney's history and one of the most enjoyable animated features of all time.",1004140800,10,1578,4.805147058823529

It has 'heart'. It has great characters, great voices, and is completely unpretentious. This last feature is, sadly, rarely found in animated films today.
Are there actually people who consider this film 'unsuitable' for children since it contains scenes of drunkenness? Like the Shakespearian bowdlerizers of earlier times, they miss the point of this movie: a baby is taken from his mother and exploited by a 'bunch of clowns', and called a 'freak' by his fellow elephants
DUMBO is a story about self-image and respect.  This is something that is very important for younger children to learn, since they are forming their own self-images and are woefully susceptible to the comments of their peers.

Perhaps there are objections to the crows? They are from another time, but are handled with humor and restraint. Take a look at live action films from this period to see how some things were simply 'taken for granted'. Racist sentiment plays a part in this film, but it is directed at Dumbo by his fellow elephants, who consider him 'no longer an elephant' when he ruins a circus act.  Crows, mice, and elephants are all equally horrified to hear that Dumbo has been made a clown--the lowest form of circus life, in their estimation.  Only his mother does not mind.
This is another important message for children to learn: that true love doesn't care if you aren't perfect. All of this is stated simply and in less than one hour's time.
Get this disc for your children instead of the POKEMON that they may still be asking you for. You will enjoy it as well.
My one complaint about this DVD is that they did not identify the artists in photos in the Backstage section. Some of these wonderful people are still around, and some are actually still working. They deserve the credit.",1004140800,3,1839,4.719626168224299

When Dumbo and Timothy get drunk (unintentionally), they hillucinate Pink Elephants on Parade (One of Disney's most creative scenes in animation history!).

The DVD also does well on account of the inclusion of two animated shorts and the sound process used on animated features. I also like the art gallery which is extensive.
The sneak peak at Dumbo II is more a sneak peak BEHIND THE SCENES of Dumbo II (no actual animated footage). Interestingly the DVD also has a trailer for Peter Pan 2: Return to Nether Land where you DO see animation. A lot of it (nice too!).
Whilst I love this Anniversary Edition DVD I must admit that I think the animated menu is the most grotesque/naive attempt to animate Dumbo flying over the menu options imaginable! It looks so cheap and nasty compared with CGI circus tent! Taste Disney, taste!

On a personal note, I was watching this movie with my nephew several years ago, and the importance of the movie's message was demonstrated for me in a very moving fashion.

The storyline and characters are well rounded enough (just) to entertain adults and older children and the quality of the animation both holds children's attention and enables them to empathise with the principle characters.  In addition, the moral of the story is well presented without being clumsily overstated as in much modern animation.
Both my children have frequently watched this DVD (which first came out (without extras) in Europe in 1999) since they were one and both enjoy it imensely.
I'm both astonished and disturbed that anyone could deem this movie unsuitable for children but can only assume they come from the same group of people who banned Robin Hood books from schools for being 'pro communist' and Shakespeare for being 'too explicit'!
The 'drunken scene' is funny, brief and discrete (all you see is the shadows of characters through canvas).  As to fast forwarding through the dream sequence for the kids' benefit because it is 'too long' that is verging on irresponsible.  All doing so teaches a child is that it's OK to have a short attention span and to zoom through films to the 'interesting bits'.  Perhaps I was wrong though and the moral of the story has been hidden too deeply ""Persevere - Don't Give Up"" is lost on some people.",993600000,168,1335,4.941964285714286
298860,5,6300274195,Dumbo is the story of an apparent freak who becomes a beloved superstar and it is one of my favorite Disney films ever (second only to Pinocchio).

298861,5,6300274195,"This film offers a parent an opportunity to discuss the ""bully"" words and actions that can hurt anyone, even Dumbo. His Mother's anger is addressed; showing ""everyone"" no matter what their station in life, must pay the consequences and in this case Ms Dumbo is given a ""time-out"". As a Grandma of 3yr old Emily, I have the time to research the media and address solutions to how our children are dealing with situations like ""Columbine"".  We must start with Pre-Schoolers NOW so they do not tease, laugh at, or bully ANYONE.  We can make a difference and DUMBO has made that task easier for me. This animated film is fun; Walt Disney was far ahead of his time!  surfgranny",989020800,2,672,4.583333333333333
298862,3,6300274195,"Dumbo, the fourth movie of the Disney Canon, is one of the Disney classics that everyone should watch and own.
The story is timeless. A baby elephant with unusually large ears is born in a circus. Everyone thinks his ears are funny, except the baby, Jumbo Jr, who is cruelly nicknamed ""Dumbo"", his mother, and a mouse. The mouse tries to make him popular, with very unfortunate results. The mouse and the baby elephant crawl away from that disaster and into another one - they get slightly intoxicated! But whatever Jumbo Jr dreamt turns into his triumph - it is thru his dream that he finds out he can use his ears to fly! He returns to the circus determined to use his newfound ability to show everyone that he can be a valuable member of the elephant herd. And, of course, he succeeds.
This movie takes you back to the days when circuses really did travel mostly by rail from town to town and created huge sensations when they arrived. The tenderness between Dumbo and his mother are priceless. The scenes of Mrs. Jumbo rioting in the circus when her baby seems threatened are fairly true to life. The unlikely friendship between Timothy and Dumbo teaches us to work together no matter who or what we are. One of the more interesting facts about this movie is that the main character, Dumbo, never speaks. He gets all of his emotions across with a look or a gesture. That makes his character stronger.
This tale teaches courage in the face of failure, loyalty in the face of adversity, and a triumph of a handicap over the troubles of life. In just 64 minutes, the shortest Disney feature length animated movie, the Disney animators give us a story that will stand up to any that has been made then or since.
The animation is simplistic, but fun. This movie had to be made on a shoestring budget due to the upcoming war. And the fact that the Disney studios had yet to get out of the red, despite the critical success of Snow White and Pinocchio made it even harder to get this movie to the theaters. Fantasia did not make money for the studio by itself until the 1969 re-release!
The colors are very vibrant and eye-catching. It looks a lot more like a cartoon, but with the famous Disney eye for detail. The ""Pink Elephant"" sequence will have you wondering what the Disney animators were thinking of - it is probably the most memorable animated sequence of all time, and also serves as a great anti-alcohol message. Watch this sequence carefully - it switches from almost surrealistic to realistic to three dimensional to almost psychedelic and back again in just a few minutes.
This movie should be on everyone's DVD shelf, even if you don't have children of your own. Great for grandkids and the whole family.",985478400,2,2716,4.567622950819672
298863,2,6300274195,"While this movie is entertaining for older children and adults, it is not for my sensitive two-year-old. For a young child, the older elephants are too cruel, scenes too dark, music scary, drunkeness inappropriate, pink elephant sequence too long... Thankfully, we rented from the library before I bought it. My two-year-old loves to watch the storks, Casey the Train and watch Dumbo fly but he asks me to fast-forward through the other parts that make him cry.
I'm not trying to discount the other reviewers' feelings and wonderful memories of Dumbo, but just trying to warn those with very young children.",983664000,4,607,5.01980198019802

Because they can't touch, she extends her trunk and he sits in it with his tiny trunk wrapped lovingly around hers as she swings him and ""Baby Mine"" starts...later he and Timothy inadvertently get drunk and ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" begins which is one of the best animated sequences in any of the Disney classics. At the time this was made some of the animators were having a wage dispute with Walt Disney and when the clowns sing ""We're Gonna Hit the Big Boss for a Raise"" they were sending him a message. Dumbo was supposed to be on the cover of Time magazine but it got bounced because of the breakout of World War II. The Crows are another one of the many high points of this remarkable feature.

298906,5,6300274195,"Despite all its merits, the fine plot, cute characters and beautiful animation, Dumbo has always been regarded as the quintessential ""baby movie"". Kids start regecting it at around the age of seven, saying ""I'm too old for THAT."" But the very beauty of the film is its enduring quality. The way you can come back to it after so many years and realize, hey, this is good stuff. It's a nice secure movie, with none of the scary undertones that colored its predecessors Pinnochio and Snow White. The songs, including ""Baby Mine"" and ""When I See an Elephant Fly"" are just timeless. It is eloquent, innocent,and truly a masterpice. Everyone, from the most insecure child, to the boldest adult can gain somthing from this sweet little film. It is classic, untarnished Disney.",970963200,2,769,4.833333333333333

One song in particular, ""Baby  Mine,"" just brings tears to my eyes. Two sequences in this movie stand  out: the pink elephants dancing and the scene where Dumbo goes to visit his  mother in jail at night. My favorite character is Timothy Q. Mouse. He is  the only friend that Dumbo has. This movie is another one of Uncle Walt's  great classics.",967161600,,517,4.446808510638298
298908,5,6300274195,"Everybody loves Dumbo for all the right reasons - great story with humor and pathos, wonderful music, and delightful animation.  However, no one  seems to have noticed the underlying racial themes that fuel the plot.  Dumbo's mom, and the other female elephants she lives and works with, are  all Indian elephants (small ears).  Dumbo's dad (Jumbo), from whom he must  have inherited his big ears, must have been African.  Dumbo (and his  mother) were mocked and ultimately ostracized from decent elephant society  because he was the product of a mixed marriage.  Only after he learns  (with the help of those zoot-suited, jive-talkin' crows)  to use his  physical ""defect"" to excel at something (flying) is he accepted  back into the circus.  While ""Dumbo"" teaches us that we're all  ""special,"" it also paints a rather darker picture of society  being intolerant of differences unless or until those differences can  benefit that society.",967161600,3,939,5.1466666666666665
298909,5,6300274195,"Dumbo is absolutely the most watchable cartoon ever made! My six year old  watches it over and over and loves the animals, the clowns and the visuals.  The music and look of the film facinates her and captures her  attention.
What facinates me is how both my wife and I cannot help being  caught up in the story every time we pass by our kids watching it. We never  seem to be able to walk out of the room until the story ends again.
This  story is full of genuine emotion from beginning to end. The sadness of Mrs.  Jumbo as she sees other animals enjoying their new children. The joy of  Mrs. Jumbo as she finally has a child of her own. Her fierce protective  instincts kicking in as her child is jeered. The loneliness of Dumbo as his  mother is taken away. The friendship of Timothy Mouse. The crows trying to  make up for their jeering of Dumbo and the really satisfying climax. The  story is tight and every scene fits perfectly.
I have heard that Walt  Disney was always made fun of as a child because of his unusually protuding  ears and that he made Dumbo as a lesson for children not to make fun of  other children who don't fit in or who had what kids could translate as  defects. Whatever the truth is, one thing is clear. Dumbo is a spectacular  film with a message about considering the feelings of others. It is at the  same time a classic, funny and very emotional film with a great story that  can be watched over and over. It can be enjoyed immensely on an adult level  as well as by childen on their level. I consider it one of my top ten  favorites of all time.

298912,2,6300274195,"Dumbo really is an animated film for adults. It contains many adult themes surrounding the innocent story line of baby elephant learns to believe in himself and takes to the air. Dumbo is ostracized from his elephant  community purely because of the size of his ears. Dumbo's mother is  shackled, locked up as a ""Mad Elephant"" and separated from her  baby because she became angry at those poking fun at Dumbo. Crass and  insensitive clowns ridicule Dumbo and use him as the laughing stock for  their show. Dumbo and his mouse friend accidentally gets drunk and spends  15 minutes hallucinating pink elephants. If these themes seem out of line  with recent Disney animations for children, it is because Dumbo depicts a  cruel and intolerant world that once existed to a much greater degree than  today.
There is a touching part of the film. A sad and depressed Dumbo  approaches his locked up Mother but is not able to see her through the  small window. She reaches out with her trunk and cradles her baby elephant  for a few short moments. It is a bittersweet moment, one that is sure to  bring tears to those of us who have babies.
Eventually, Dumbo flies and  becomes a star and his Mother is freed and they ride off happily in the  train.
This is a long dark movie with two brief spots of lightness.  Perhaps it is an interesting film for its historical representation of how  the world used to be in the unenlightened times only a few decades ago. For  those people who actually enjoyed it for its emotional value and for their  children, I can only conjecture that there must be an empathetic nerve  missing.",955929600,12,1614,4.616197183098592
