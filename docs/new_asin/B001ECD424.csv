8297665,1,B001ECD424,"If you're buying this early film because it is the original version of FRANTZ, save your time and money. The newer film is superior on every level. The young leading actor in particular is excruciatingly bad. (I don't mean Lionel Barrymore, of course, but the young Frenchman.) Also, if you're assuming that Ernst Lubitsch directed this film, he didn't. Lubitsch produced it. A young Otto Preminger directed it. It really is almost unwatchable.",1515888000,,444,5.095890410958904

8297667,5,B001ECD424,"This is one of the best anti-war films I've seen. Phillips Holmes plays a young French soldier who kills a German soldier during WW I. He's filled with anguish and guilt and, after the war, goes to the German boy's parents to seek their forgiveness.

I've seen Phillips Holmes in another film, An American Tragedy, and he's excellent in that one as well. He knows how to play a person who is conflicted. Lionel Barrymore plays the father of the German soldier and delivers a scathing indictment of war.

The ending is moving and this film is filled with lots of scenes that brought tears to my eyes.  As the director, Ernst Lubitsch puts in a few comedic touches that prevent the film from becoming a ponderous dirge.",1496448000,3,717,4.5859375
8297668,5,B001ECD424,"Made in between the two world wars, this is a rare gem of an antiwar movie. Excellent, nothing else in his class.",1485734400,3,113,4.181818181818182
8297669,5,B001ECD424,Nancy Carroll was a great actress who made a seamless transition from Silents to talkies. Phillip Holmes is a bit overwrought in his performance but acceptable. It would have been interesting to see how he developed had he not met an untimely  death in World War 2. Lionel Barrymore as usual gives an interesting performance. A forgotten movie to remember.,1459382400,8,356,4.933333333333334
8297670,5,B001ECD424,"This film is a legend, partly because its difficult to see.  Directed by Ernst Lubitsch, this is the story of French soldier who killed a German soldier in WW I, and is tormented with remorse.  Nancy Carroll is the dead man's fiancee.  The French soldier falls in love with her.  This is a very sophisticated film.  Lubitsch is at the height  of his powers here and this is quite different from his sparkling comedies, proving that a great director could handle both magnificently.  The Spanish DVD is excellent if you have an all-region player.",1343606400,2,545,4.73404255319149
