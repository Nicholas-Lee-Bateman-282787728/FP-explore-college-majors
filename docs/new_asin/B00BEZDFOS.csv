8567383,3,B00BEZDFOS,It's good exposure to Canadian French and the fever over ice hockey. The character development is not there.,1483401600,,108,5.055555555555555
8567384,5,B00BEZDFOS,"My son absolutely loves this movie!!  Has watched it over and over again...don't hesitate if your child only speaks English, you forget you are even reading subtitles! It's funny and cute...will be a hockey classic!!",1436572800,,216,5.171428571428572
8567385,4,B00BEZDFOS,"I think it is good for French classes too, but teachers looking for the totally G-rated experience, be aware that one hears the F- word 3 times in this film.",1417910400,,157,4.266666666666667
8567386,4,B00BEZDFOS,"This is a great sports movie for kids.  I have shown this film to my French classes and they have all enjoyed it.  The character development is quite effective and although the story is quite simple and predicable, it does do a great job of entertaining the audience.  It's also worth mentioning that this film gives a great shot of life into the French-Canadian culture.",1416096000,2,371,4.676923076923077
8567387,4,B00BEZDFOS,"Amendment: DVD has English sous-titre (sub-titles) Also, my son's friends also enjoyed it. Great for teenagers.

Saw it on the plane and enjoyed it. The protagonist kid has the charisma of a door knob, but the girl lead is terrific and overall the movie is worthwhile. The annual pee wee tournament  in Quebec City is a huge deal in kids hockey, and the film does a pretty good job in showing the stress and drama of kids travel hockey. Don't have DVD yet (ordered, will amend review) so don't know if it has English sub-titles. worth it if you have kids in travel hockey. Age appropriate. This isn't Goon or Slapshot, but better than Mighty Dorks.",1385251200,2,648,4.577586206896552
