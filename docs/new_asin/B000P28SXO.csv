8188352,4,B000P28SXO,"This is a pretty good prenatal yoga routine. Especially calm and relaxing before sleep, but it also combines good strengthening and flexing poses. I think it helped a lot with my hip and back pain, and sleep problems. My only complain is that somewhere in the middle of the practice, during a lunge type of pose, the dvd is edited so that half of the move is missing: while you're extending your right side, the lady in the dvd shifts to her left side. It is hard to describe... When I realized the problem (you realize it because you find herself in a different pose  than her), I started to pause the dvd and repeat the pose for both sides, but it is still a little bit annoying.",1366588800,2,681,4.3203125
8188353,5,B000P28SXO,Loved the video. It really helped me with my back pain. I ordered another video at the same time as this one & did not like it.,1347321600,,127,3.740740740740741
8188354,5,B000P28SXO,"I had a lot of personal success with the other titles in the ""Living Room Yoga"" series, so I thought I would purchase this one for a friend of mine who is pregnant.  She told me she really enjoys it, and that she feels as though it helps her bond with her baby.  Highly recommended!",1291075200,,282,4.109090909090909
8188355,1,B000P28SXO,Have been doing yoga for a few years now. Love when sets are warm and cozy and the music is not overpowering or mind numbingly repetitive. Would not recommend. I love Yoga Mama with Crunch Gym. Great teacher and wonderful workout for entire pregnancy!,1253318400,,251,4.7272727272727275
8188356,5,B000P28SXO,"I Recently purchased this for my wife. We love it! Eva is caring, calming, and gentle in her approach, voice, and instruction. The bonus meditation cd is so good we listen to it together. As a new dad I feel like it helps me to bond with my wife and the baby. It is a wonderful shared experience!

The Perfect gift for a new mom as well as dad!!",1241654400,2,345,4.0
8188357,5,B000P28SXO,"During the last 4 months of my pregnancy, I watched and worked out psychocologically and physically with the Prenatal Yoga by Eva Barash and it felt really good for me, my spirit and my baby. 'Zenitude' as we say in French would be the word for this DVD lessons made with care and strong knowledge of the nice postures and breathing sessions to make the Mother and the Baby feel good together. I strongly recommend all the future Mums to do a bit of gentle exercice every day or twice per day to get into this prenatal method and get ready for the big day as well as to welcome the newborn in our world.",1239235200,3,603,4.252173913043478
