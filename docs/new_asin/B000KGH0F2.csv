8156546,5,B000KGH0F2,"What can you say about Girls Behaving Badly that hasn't already been said?  It's hilariously funny, but sophomoric as heck.  It's story lines are flimsy as a wet kleenex, but the actresses are superb.  All in all, if you like slap stick, situational humour a la Candid Camera, then you'll love this.  I've seen every episode a hundred times, but still laugh my butt off!  5 stars from me.",1233705600,3,388,4.565217391304348
