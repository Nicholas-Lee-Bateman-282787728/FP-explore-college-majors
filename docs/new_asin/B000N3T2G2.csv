Plus, The Graham Bond Organization with Ginger Baker, Jack Bruce, Dick Heckstall-Smith, and Graham Bond have a cameo performance in it.",1479772800,,264,5.162790697674419
8174548,4,B000N3T2G2,"Hi,

Do not pay the rip-off prices($69.00) listed on US Amazon. Its the same PAL Reg. 2 disc from Britain. Go to Amazon. UK-there is a link at the bottom of this page (United Kingdom) and order it there for about $13.00. (5.98 pounds plus 1.81 pounds for shipping ) All the countries that Amazon has websites in, you can order from those sights and Amazon will ship them to you in the US. I order from the U.K./German/and Japanese sites all the time. You will need to have a multi-region coded DVD player too. Don't let anyone tell you, you need a PAL TV set to watch the discs. The multi-region DVD players convert the picture to play on US televsions.
Amazons US site does sell low cost multi region DVD players. I've picked several up for between $25.00 to $60.00. The $25.00 machine I bought 5 years ago and use it everyday and its still going strong. Look up DVD players on Amazon, and read the customer reviews.  Someone will mention if its a multi standard machine and where to find the code to make it multi-standard.
I just can't believe what US Market Place Sellers are charging for the wild ""Gonks GO Beat"". Again, Its the same exact DVD from Amazon U.K. at 6 times the price.",1270857600,,1187,4.390909090909091
