8088937,3,B000BMCXYS,It's good instruction but for the price there should be more areas covered.,1435881600,,75,4.846153846153846
8088938,5,B000BMCXYS,What a great DVD. This was just what I've been looking for. As a beautician waxing is not the easiest thing to do but this DVD has given me more  confidence. Even though I have been trained at college they only went through the basics of waxing but this shows you how to wax difficult areas of brazilian waxing and hair removal. It shows very clear and close up views of the techniques so you can actually see what the tutor is doing. This is the best waxing video I've seen in a long time.,1419120000,,490,4.157894736842105
8088939,5,B000BMCXYS,"I'm an esthetician and this intrigued me. I get many female clients that like to switch it up, and we're only taught so much in school.

It offered great tips and insights on so many different techniques! It ranges from full body waxing, Brazilian waxing, to soft and hard waxing plus so much more! This was a great refresher and also taught me many new techniques.

I feel comfy lacing this into my practice and I would recommend it to any esthetician. c:",1418947200,,456,4.481927710843373
8088940,4,B000BMCXYS,"I would have liked to have seen this one while in school with other students to share opinions. But I consider it a good investment. I learned a lot from it but like others not everyone is going to be as ""cleaned up"" as the models here. But after watching it a few times I feel rather confident I can deal with the hairy ones anyway. good lessons.",1217116800,,347,4.117647058823529
8088941,5,B000BMCXYS,"This was the second video I bought made by Aesthetic VideoSource and it was really great! This videos goes through the process of Brazilian bikini waxing slowly showing all each step. The instructions are so easy to follow. After I watched the video just one time, I felt so much more confortable and confident offering this service to my clients. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn how to do Brazilian bikini waxing. You won't be dissapointed!",1207180800,6,468,4.790123456790123
8088942,1,B000BMCXYS,"This dvd had some good tips but the models they used were not the typical average client and they did not have alot of hair to wax, I was pretty disappointed.",1204070400,3,158,4.129032258064516
