3914763,2,B002DYYGOM,"There were so many flaws in Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas, I don't know where to start ...

TV Movie of the Week quality.

Numerous gaffes.

Twice, one of the actors looked at the camera.  In any real movie, the editor/director would have re-shot the scene.

When the dead hitchhiker is getting raped on the couch, you can see the camerman's shadow.

Henry's scar on his eye keeps changing between scenes.

When the doctor is preparing to give Henry shock treatment, he has the nurse take out Henry's glass eye.  While he's shocking Henry and questioning him afterward, it is obvious that the eye is still in place, the actor is just looking upward to make it more ominous.

The actors' ""accents"" were too funny.  I'm guessing the director told them to ""talk real slow, cuz that's how dumb people talk.""

Overall, fairly laughable.  Unfortunately, not funny enough to be a cult classic.",1252281600,4,881,4.723684210526316
3914764,1,B002DYYGOM,"I've seen almost all the movies about serial killers including the very disturbing Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. Drifter is pure fluff, made for TV crap! Just look at the cast of pretty people including and starring ex-soap opera star Antonio Sabato, Jr. This movie is not scary, gorey or dark like most serial killer movies should be; it's just plain cheesy and lame. I would give it zero stars but I don't think that's possible. Be warned.",1252195200,9,447,4.670886075949367

3914769,2,B002DYYGOM,"It's was less than ok. I still don't know, from this movie, how many people he killed. The acting was sub-par and some scenes were ridiculous - like taking a serial killer to get a milk shake because he's been so cooperative. IF that really happened, then that sheriff should have been fired! The back story of his life as a child was compelling - but the quality of the movie and the acting make you wonder how much o that is true.  ""A Portrait of a Serial Killer..."" is better. I think I will read a non-fiction book about Lucas to get ALL of the REAL story",1444521600,,559,4.175925925925926
3914770,1,B002DYYGOM,"Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas, 2009 film

It starts in the dusty southwest, a man drives a car to a deserted place with a young woman. Its not what you expect! Its back to 1981, two men and a woman drive in the dark to see a movie. People watch the screen and not other people. [Believable?] They return with another woman. Her screams are futile. Next its San Antonio Texas, the police have a prisoner. Henry doesnt like live ones, they talk too much! Henry likes milk shakes. He talks about past murders to the Sheriff and a news reporter. It began back in West Virginia. His mother entertains a male visitor. [Absent father.] His mother humiliated him with school clothes. The family is poor. The parents argue, his father lost a leg in a railroad accident. [Do they know what creates serial murderers?]

Henry talks about his past murders. [This seems like sensationalism. Was this possible in a small rural village?] He serves his first sentence digging ditches. [Hard labor.] When he returns home he confronts his mother. Its ten years for second degree murder. He tries suicide in prison. He is given electroshock therapy. [Does this work?] He is not compliant [a form of torture?]. He will go back to prison and then be paroled. He met a man in a soup kitchen. The travel together and commit murders. They didn't get caught - there were no policemen around. They pick up a female hitchhiker who pays for her ride. More than she expected? A District Attorney arrives to straighten out Henrys confessions. Was he elsewhere?

The DA is escorted out of the jail (a non-believer in guilt). There is a flashback to an earlier time. He argues with his girlfriend and takes her for a ride. Henry keeps a hunting knife in his glovebox. What did he do with her body? He chopped her up into small pieces and buried them all over Texas. [Is he insane or just faking it?] In 1996 Henry was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. His sentence was commuted to life in prison by Governor George W. Bush. Henry died in 2001 from heart failure.

After the end credits they say this story is fictional and any similarity to any real person or event is coincidental! That is a legal way to avoid any civil suits for any reason. If there is a book on Henry Lee Lucas and his crimes it will have more information. What if it depends on Henrys self-serving statements? How accurate will it be? I wonder about all those young women being hitchhikers. Overall, this movie lacks any redeeming social value. You can compare it to other movies about serial murderers, such as Citizen X. Or you could read a book about Dr. H. H. Holmes in Chicago. Their lesson is to beware of any stranger who wants to help you. But some will choose to be fooled with promises.",1441756800,,2740,4.52929292929293

A waste of time to watch.",1403308800,2,272,4.6875
3914780,1,B002DYYGOM,This is one of the worst movies ever made.  The acting is not up to the average high school play.  Henry Lee Lucas and Otis Toole were terrible people and their story would be of interest but this is just total crap.,1387152000,3,216,4.119047619047619
3914781,5,B002DYYGOM,I love this movie. Henry Lee Lucas was my great great great uncle. Many of the reviewers facts above are not true. This movie is great!!,1386892800,,136,4.269230769230769
3914782,3,B002DYYGOM,"This movie is an interesting character study of Henry Lee Lucas, but nothing more.  If you are looking for sex, blood and violence - look somewhere else.",1384041600,,153,4.666666666666667
3914783,5,B002DYYGOM,"this movie is crazy awesome with a suprise ending. Its sickening and sad and just messed up. cool ass movie, not for kids.",1378771200,,122,4.3478260869565215
3914784,4,B002DYYGOM,"""'Cause I loved her.""  That was Henry Lee Lucas' answer to a question from the district attorney at the beginning, and the end, of the film.  That question was:  ""Why'd you kill her?""  And the ""her"" in question was Lucas' teenage girlfriend whom he called ""Becky.""  Geez; I'd hate to see what Mr. Lucas did to somebody that he hated.

But we do get to see what he did to quite a few people, some that he hated, some that he thought nothing of.  Like a lady that he killed while barging into her house and asking her for a glass of water.  She said something like, ""There's a hose out front.  You can drink out of that.""  Wrong answer.  And if you watch, you'll find out why.  Mr. Lucas did kill his mom, whom he surely learned to hate, but after watching the film, I thought to myself, ""Well, perhaps she was the only person that deserved to die by his hands.""  Just sayin'.

And overall, this film seems to take a pretty sympathetic view of Mr. Lucas, even bringing into question murders in which he confessed.  The film also shows his early childhood:  how he was terribly abused by his mother, how his father lost his legs, and how the then little Henry put his own eye out accidently with a stick.  Any one of these things could have caused Mr. Lucas to become a murderer, at least according to ""Drifter:  Henry Lee Lucas.""

Let's look at the facts though.  1.  Many children have been abused but have not become serial killers.  2.  Daddy lost his legs.  That didn't much directly influence the youngster, minus having to watch his mommy ""earn"" money to put food on the table.  3.  Sammy Davis Junior lost an eye, but he didn't kill anybody, at least that I know of.  However, Henry's mom didn't take him to the doctor early enough; if she had they might have saved his eye.  That might have done it.  I wouldn't wish this on, well, even Henry Lee Lucas.

But this film does seem to show that Mr. Lucas' partner in crime -- Otis Toole -- was maybe the bad guy, or at least the worst guy.  Mr. Toole appeared to be, well, a ""Tool,"" that's for sure; it seemed that anyone that came within arm's length of him would be dead.  And soon.  I watched a show recently -- perhaps ""Cold Cases"" -- where John Walsh, the gentleman who started the show ""America's Most Wanted,"" hired a private detective (PI) to determine who killed Mr. Walsh's son, Adam.  Supposedly, Mr. Toole had originally confessed to the crime a long time ago but later recanted.  But this PI built a very strong case that Mr. Toole was the original killer; that case was strong enough that the police in Florida then considered it solved.  At any rate, I'm sure that John Walsh doesn't much like either one of these ""scumbags,"" as most likely he would call them based upon the salty language from his show.  Can't say that I would blame Mr. Walsh if it would be so.

But even though this film seems to be about a couple of tools, it is a film that I recommend.  I don't know how accurate it is, but it does give a pretty good background on these guys and gives a glimpse of perhaps why they went down such dark paths.",1372118400,,3083,4.31413612565445
3914785,3,B002DYYGOM,"He admitted to tall the killing but by the time the film is over, you still don't know his exact vicitims, save his mother.",1371686400,,123,4.166666666666667
3914786,1,B002DYYGOM,Didn't watch it all!  This movie was really really bad.  Poorly done. Made me sick to my tummy to actually watch it.,1370908800,,116,4.2272727272727275
3914787,4,B002DYYGOM,"Henry ( Antonio Sabato Jr.) is in custody of the Texas Rangers and is treated like royalty as he confesses to many crimes seen as flashbacks. Raised by an abusive mother and living dirt poor all his life, Henry embarks on a killing spree unlike anything in history. Henry teams up with Ottis (Kostas Sommer) as they are a natural pair. Henry is a necrophilia, because women talk too much. Ottis is a cannibal. He has sex with the women while they are alive. They kill the girl, then it is Henry's turn. Ottis then eats her...""She ain't a girl, she's just juicy white meat.""

I enjoyed the 50's style soundtrack and theme song. The movie is not extremely graphic. The acting was fairly decent with Becky (Kelly Curran) having an accent and lines bordering on camp. The plot moves slow so as to develop Henry's character. Think of this slasher film as ""Natural Born Killers"" light.

F-bomb, sex, rape-like scenes, necrophilia, no nudity.",1334534400,5,935,4.695121951219512
3914788,5,B002DYYGOM,"While nowhere near as good as the fictionalized Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, this film is much, much more based on fact than the other film. Sobato playing Lucas is excellent, i originally thought he would not be up to it, boy was i wrong, this guy really committed to the role, even mimicking Henry's backwoods speech pattern & he even looks just like Henry after his capture, Kostas playing Otis Toole was great also, Otis was a real sick-o & Kostas does him justice. The film is really low budget, which is it's main downfall, though director Mike Fiefer has done a few of these killer flicks & he more than makes up for it. The kills are not that graphic or gory. Overall, fairly good killer film, really nice to finally see a ""true"" re-telling of the Henry and Otis story.",1323820800,2,784,4.451388888888889
3914789,4,B002DYYGOM,I purchased this movie after having researched these two killers and was impressed at the accuracy in which Henry Lee Lucas at least was portrayed. The movie itself was not gory but does get the point across as to how vicious and sadistic these two psycos were. Totally callous to their victims and very brutal in their rapes. These men were definetely better off dead which they both are now. Ottis Toole died in prison in 1998 and Lucas in 2001. This movie will show you how the mind of a true psycopath works.,1299369600,,512,4.457446808510638
3914790,1,B002DYYGOM,"I will openly admit I watch too many of both the cheesy fake horror movies (Friday the 13th, etc) and these ""based on real life"" horror movies.  But on occasion you can find a decent small film amongst them (""THE GRAY MAN"" about Albert Fish was pretty decent) and it isn't as if the glut of high profile, big budget films have had much to offer recently.  I guess from the cover and the casting of Antonio Sabato Jr as Henry I should've realized right away how bad this would be, but sometimes that can be funny.  Might have been funny had they not been so studiously serious about it.

So Sabato Jr is not only too good looking (despite sad attempts to make him deformed), he's just not convincing as a liar/killer etc.  But then again nobody else is either.  Everyone is bad in this movie and the dialogue is so poorly written.  The accents are laughable.  Some of the footage looks like it was shot on someone's personal video and not in a deliberate ""BLAIR WITCH"" kind of way, more in a look at my family's attempt to be funny home video way.

Anyway, as I had already paid for the rental I went ahead and sat through it, but it required a Chimay Belgium Beer for me to do so.  Anyway, beer was good.  Movie was bad.  Save yourself some time and rent/buy something else, anything else.

But if you really want to see a real life serial killer movie these would be my suggestions:
THE GRAY MAN - about Albert Fish was disturbing, though not gory from slasher movie perspective, it was well performed and written. and the guy that plays Albert Fish looks like him (a bit better looking and taller, but the resemblance is there).

Of the Bundy film library, for me, it will always be Mark Harmon who best portrayed him in ""THE DELIBERATE STRANGER"" but Ann Rule's ""The STRANGER BESIDE ME"" and Billy Campbell are pretty good (the book is better).

And the grand daddy of real life murder movies (though not serial killer), ""HELTER SKELTER"" (1976) - The original is my personal choice (the remake is okay).  The book is dryer, but a great book.  The film is good and the actor that plays him really is disturbingly like Manson in his portrayal.

There are also some larger scale productions that are pretty good: THE ZODIAC, PSYCHO (1960 - very loosely based on Ed Gein), and MONSTER(Aileen Wuornos).

But this movie is badly made and honestly pretty boring.  I understand HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A KILLER is better.",1281484800,4,2409,4.481651376146789
3914791,1,B002DYYGOM,"This truncated look at infamous serial killer suffers on many levels.  Casting underwear hunk Antonio Sabato as the titular character is one of filmdom's most ridiculous miscastings ever, as is German actor Kostas Sommeras his psycho sidekick Ottis.  In actuality, they were both un-handsome males.
The movie moves too slowly and its production values unremarkable.  Michael Rooker's PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER did it much better years before.  While it has some disturbing moments, DRIFTER is ultimately a dud.",1279238400,2,512,5.443037974683544

8366513,4,B002DYYGOM,"This movie was decent, and better than I expected after reading some to the other reviewers comments. It's slow from the very beginning, but interesting. Antonio Sabato Jr. stars as Henry Lee Lucas, who was a real life, murderous low life drifter. Born in Blacksburg Virginia, he travelled across country through Florida and Michigan before ending up in a Texas prison.

The story begins when Lucas was a boy growing up in a dirt poor family. His father is portrayed as an alcoholic amputee who reportedly lost his legs after getting drunk and walking in front of a train. The mother, an alcoholic prostitute who occasionally forced Lucas watch her have sex with strange men. Its unknown how closely the story actually aligns with Lucas's real life, but his actions as an adult are clearly correlated to the fact that he grew up in less than desirable conditions. It was his parents fault that he indiscriminately murdered multiple people.

Kostas Sommer plays the role of Ottis Toole. The two linked up at a Florida soup kitchen and then embarked on a killing spree. Hundreds of murders were attributed to Lucas but he was actually convicted of only two. Originally sentenced to death, it was later commuted to life in prison when it was determined that he had falsely confessed to many of the murders for publicity. He died in prison of heart failure in 2001.",1471564800,,1361,4.787234042553192
