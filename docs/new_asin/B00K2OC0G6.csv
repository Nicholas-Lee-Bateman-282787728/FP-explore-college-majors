6401627,5,B00K2OC0G6,Movies like this make me so gitty. Carl Payne was hilarious. These are the kinds of movies that make me hope all over again. I love the plot as well as Christian Keyes. Jason Weaver and Vanessa Simmons are such a cute couple. These are the kinds of movies that should be on Bounce!,1441238400,,281,4.222222222222222

6401634,5,B00K2OC0G6,It was good. It seemed more of a sitcom than a movie.,1428710400,,53,3.5
6401635,4,B00K2OC0G6,"This was a funny film. I really enjoy Christian Keyes as an actor and I enjoy any film that he stars in. This is a film about dating and the choices that one has to make when dating and trying to find ones soul mate. I recommend this film for anyone looking for a funny romantic comedy. The script makes sense and the acting is fine. The entire cast is funny and the women are beautiful. This is not a stage play. This film would be rated PG. There is no sex, nudity or profanity.",1422316800,,480,4.063157894736842

I really liked Paula her expression were hilarious and Piper, I'm so glad to see that Vanessa Simmons got her acting career and she's really good at it. The guys these three never let me down.

6401647,5,B00K2OC0G6,"Great production, I thought it was very slow; and I was ready to give it up.  But then what I liked about it the most was that it was real.  The story line, and the acting made it ""real"".  I was able to relate to the movie, and this made it comfortable, and able to just sit and watch it without giving up on it.  I love the actors, a lot of them I am very familiar with from the tv show ""The Game"".  So that really drew me into the movie, now I curious to see the other half.  Thanks good show.",1414886400,,495,3.7572815533980584

6401654,1,B00K2OC0G6,"I rented this movie, if you can even call it a movie. After five minutes, I had to turn it off. The sitcom laughter in the background is the most annoying thing I have ever heard. Worst ""movie"" I have ever tried to watch.",1407456000,2,221,4.045454545454546
6401655,5,B00K2OC0G6,"Love this movie,and christian keyes",1406851200,,35,6.2

6401659,5,B00K2OC0G6,"This was a great and heartwarming stage play.  It does have a part 2 that is, per Amazon, scheduled to be ready for DVD on 9/2/14.  It is called ""Love Will Find a Way"" and they are taking pre orders now.  I'm not sure why they didn't release them both at the same time but must say part 2, in my opinion, is as good as part 1.",1405641600,4,326,3.764705882352941
6401660,3,B00K2OC0G6,"I purchased this dvd from a retailer other than Amazon. It was to be ""weekend entertainment"". The storyline is good and the actors are all great. I would give this 4 stars but I have one huge problem with this...... There is a part 2!. You won't know it until you actually watch the disc through. It cuts off just as the plot thickens with a line: ""To be continued"". What company does this without disclosing it on the disc cover?! Now I have to wait and keep checking Amazon or my local store for the arrival of part 2. I am so disappointed. Otherwise, a great teleplay......so far.",1405468800,5,583,4.3577981651376145
