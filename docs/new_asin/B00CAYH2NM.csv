5710026,5,B00CAYH2NM,"It took two matches to make me believe that this would have the makings of a great event. But with those came a night of spectacular surprises. First off, the return of Rob Van Dam was confirmed to pump up the WWE Universe. The card delivered more than was expected.

1) Triple Threat Match for the Intercontinental Championship
Wade Barrett(c) vs. The Miz vs. Curtis Axel
I'm glad the WWE is reviving this title in some way. The Barrett-Miz rivalry took an unexpected turn and was untouched for two months. Curtis Axel, formerly known as Michael Mcgillicutty, is Paul Heyman's new apprentice which seems to be big to WWE. But he was able to wrestle quite well at a lower level in WWE. A suspenseful opener with Axel being the main source of attention, but the Miz made his presence known with some nice spots. I wouldn't skip it. 7.5/10

2) Diva's Championship Match
Kaitlyn vs. AJ
This match should have taken place at Extreme Rules, but the rivalry lasted longer and got more heated. Yes I'm talking about a Diva rivalry. Both competitors have the ability to go crazy, and acted a high desire towards the title. This match did have some good spots, Kaitlyn the most, making it highly watchable. For a divas match, I rank 8/10

3) United States Championship Match
Dean Ambrose(c) vs. Kane
I saw Ambrose's ability to perform last month at Extreme Rules in a match against Kofi Kingston. That match was short and fast paced between Kofi's speed and Ambrose's power. I thought Dean would use his powerful skills to use against Kane in an intense giant vs. giant fight. In the end this match was long, dragged-out, nothing special. Only really about 4 or 5 highlights that are special but I would skip it. 6/10

4) World Heavyweight Championship Match
Dolph Ziggler(c) vs. Alberto Del Rio
This match, like others, took an unexpected turn. This one more noticeably. The rivalry had good chemistry, which was shown in the first 8 or 9 minutes of the match. But towards the end, pure brutality won the race. The double turn after was pretty big. Didn't seem like a Heavyweight title match, but WWE has not cared for this title for a long time. 7.5/10

5) CM Punk vs. Chris Jericho
Thank god. WWE was saved by the return of CM Punk. What better way to do it in Chicago, against a fan favorite in Chris Jericho. This is the third time these two will face in the city, which pumped up the crowd. This match got real good real fast. Both were fan  favorites which is making Punk back into a babyface. Overall, this can be ranked 2nd of 3rd in their 3 PPV encounters or 4 with their 2008 King of the Ring match on RAW. This mach was the best on the card. 9/10

6) World Tag Team Championship Match
The Shield(c) vs. Daniel Bryan and Randy Orton
Another great match with the Shield. Bryan and Orton each had their chance to shine, and their moves actually varied as oppose to their recent performances. Always fun to watch Bryan. 8/10

7) Three Stages of Hell Match for the WWE Championship
Never would I have thought that I would see another 3 Stages of Hell Match. I expected one for HHH and Lesnar at WM 29, but it never happened. I had my doubts, especially with the Lumberjack Stipulation put in, but this was a great main event. The lumberjacks went after both wrestlers, and Cena even put on an awesome dive into the crowd. The tables was a somewhat humorous portion with Ryback's steel step rampage. As you guessed it went to three falls, but in a different order than expected. The Ambulance portion was worthy while it lasted. I give the main event and 8.5/10.

Overall, I give this event an 8.25/10",1371859200,3,3598,4.514592933947773
5710027,5,B00CAYH2NM,Great PPV! Each match had a purpose and there was a great amount of storytelling. There were some great surprises and excellent title changes. Well worth the money. Loved it!,1371859200,,174,4.833333333333333
5710028,5,B00CAYH2NM,"I don't watch too many PPVs a year. Lately, I've gotten my hopes up for the previous shows like Wrestlemania and Extreme Rules, feeling like they didn't live up to my standards. But I was with my friends who wanted to see this show, and I figured we were all in for something special, and we were right.

Intercontinental Champion Wade Barrett vs. Miz vs. Curtis Axel

Fandango had a concussion, so Axel replaced him and made this match better than it would have been. Barrett and Miz had a great fight while Axel played up the classic heel part by having them wear each other down before going in for the attack.

It was fast paced action, that went all over the place, and the ending to the match was like an old-school heel moment.

Diva's Champion Kaitlyn vs AJ Lee

I guess no one told them this was supposed to be a meaningless filler match, because this was one of the best WWE women's matches in a long time.

I suspect that they were told to go at a slower pace, which worried me because that would make the crowd boo, but Kaitlyn and AJ made it work. It seemed to become a theme of the night for wrestlers to use a slower old-school style of wrestling, and the ladies did a great job building up to a great exchange of slams and submissions. Kind of surprised that the crowd seemed to turn on Kaitlyn, and even booed her friends trying to comfort her.

US Champion Dean Ambrose vs Kane

They again stuck to the formula, and worked a deliberately slow but not boring pace. Both men were evenly matched with Ambrose continuing to shine with his slick attitude and Kane being as good here as he has in the other Shield matches. The ending was lame, but the match was solid enough.

World Heavyweight Champion Dolph Ziggler vs Alberto Del Rio

This was scary. After suffering a concussion, it wasn't easy to see Dolph take so much abuse to the head through the whole match.

Del Rio seemed to be breaking away from his face persona while Ziggler was the ""face in peril."" (Although the adults chanted ""Let's go Ziggler"" while the kids responded ""Ziggler sucks!"" I guess it's a reverse John Cena deal)

I wish Ziggler wasn't being dominated so much, but I think this match was done so WWE could get the title off him while he recovers. (And hopefully build to him getting his rematch as an official face)

CM Punk vs Chris Jericho

As far as I'm concerned, this should've been the main event. Despite being a face, Jericho completely played up his heel persona while Punk looked like he hasn't been away. This was classic wrestling, with both guys using simple but effective moves on each other before getting to the bigger stuff all while keeping the aforementioned slow pace that never got boring. The build-up to the end was very well done, and showed that Punk is truly the face of WWE.

Tag Team Champions Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns vs Daniel Bryan and Randy Orton

It's obvious WWE management didn't think Cena and Ryback could follow Punk and Jericho, so they shoved this match in between thinking it would cool the crowd off. Nope, they lit the crowd up.

This match was all Bryan as he acted like a wild animal with his fast paced, vicious attacks on The Shield while Orton played as his polar opposite. Seth Rollins of course wasn't going to be shown up, and made sure people took notice of his crazy bumps and kicks.

This match did a great job of being full of action while still telling the story of Bryan and Orton's issues with one another.

WWE champion John Cena vs Ryback- Three Stages of Hell

I didn't think these guys could follow the great matches before it, but I'm happy to say I was wrong. Their rhythm and timing were on point, and it was obvious that they cared about meeting the standards set in the other matches.

The lumberjacks didn't take away from the action as I was afraid they would, and they weren't portrayed as weaklings either. The close calls with the table match were great as Cena and Ryback were great with their counters.

The ambulance portion of the math was fun and unintentionally hilarious at the same time as the emergency vehicle broke so easily like a toy truck. It was like a guilty pleasure.

In he end, this was definitely a great show from top to bottom with every match being treated like it was important. I hope Payback remains as June's Pay Per View and keeps the high quality standard set by this show.",1371600000,3,4372,4.451127819548872
5710029,4,B00CAYH2NM,"The Triple Threat for thr Intercontinental title(Wade Barrett vs The Miz vs Curtis Axel) was fun enough and probably the best choice for a opener with lots of near falls and false finishes to boot. The Divas title match between Kaitlyn & AJ Lee was one of the best Divas matches in recent memory. The United States title match between Dean Ambrose & Kane was boring & plodding. The Worlds title match between Doplh Ziggler & Alberto Del Rio was a amazing back-and-forth bout. The Chris Jericho-CM Punk match was great and just as good as thier past bouts. The Tag Team title match between The Shield(Rollins & Reigns) against Team RK-NO(Randy Orton & Daniel Bryan) was also great. The Three Stages of Hell match for the WWE title between John Cena & Ryback while predictable,still had it's good highspots and moments. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.",1371513600,7,848,4.622516556291391

PAYBACK 2013

1.[I-C TITLE]WADE BARRETT VS THE MIZ VS CURTIS AXEL-this was a great opening match that showcased three great talents in the WWE. Of course with any triple threat match the action is fast paced and all three men get time to shine. There are many near falls and break ups with each man almost pulling it out. The Miz in particular looked real good here and in fact looked as if he had the win in the bag. But once he put that figure four on Barrett Axel comes in and gets the pin in a very creative finish. Axel wins the belt on Fathers Day, making daddy proud I am sure.

2.[DIVAS TITLE]KAITLYN VS AJ LEE-this like others have said was one of the best Divas matches in a  while. Both women did a great job bringing this rivalry to a new level with Kaitlyn looking really good here. She had the match won but she got in her own way which leads to AJ taking the title. The match itself had a lot of really good moments and was quick paced.

3.[US TITLE]DEAN AMBROSE VS KANE-this was a good match that the crowd was really into especially at the beginning. Ambrose was the crowd favorite here and did a good job against the monster. Kane of course used his size and power to overwhelm Dean at times but the defending champ was game. The match was a back and forth affair that lead to Dean hitting Kane with a DDT on the outside getting the count out win and being the first of the night to retain a title.

4.[WORLD TITLE]DOLPH ZIGGLER VS ALBERTO DEL RIO-one of the matches I was looking forward to the most since I know what these guys can do. Del Rio controlled most of the match taking to the man who took the belt from him. Ziggler showed signs of taking over from time to time but Del Rio mostly dominated this match. In the end he was too much for the new champ on this night and took the strap back. The crowd was really behind Dolph even chanting for him after the match.

5. CM PUNK VS CHRIS JERICHO-one of the best matches from the night and possibly the best indeed. It is a back and forth affair that sees both men trade momentum. The reversals and counters here are great to watch from these two with all the near finishes. This is the type of match that you know you will get when two performers like this get together. This was Punks first match back after Mania and he comes away with the victory.

6.[TAG TITLES]ROMAN REIGNS & SETH ROLLINS VS DANIEL BRYAN & RANDY ORTON-every time The Shield defends the tag belts I am excited to see the match. They have been excellent for the tag division and this match was a great example of that. Here we have and actual team versus two singles guys that are just put together. Naturally that shows as Reigns and Rollins control most of the match working as a unit. Orton and Bryan don't seem to ever truly get moving as the champs pick them apart. There are some great moments that happen here that lead to the champs keeping the titles as the challengers cant work together.

7.[3 STAGES OF HELL WWE TITLE MATCH]JOHN CENA VS RYBACK-this match was three in one with first being a lumberjack match. This first fall was actually a very fun fight between the two with Cena actually taking flight in this one onto the outside. Ryback gets the first fall but it was a good battle back and forth. The second fall was to be determined in a tables match. This one would see Ryback try to use various weapons breaking a table nearly every time. Cena would end up getting the win in this round to move it onto the next and final match, an ambulance match. The final round is an entertaining one even though it is their typical type match. It was cool to see the ambulance be torn apart. Also the ending was pretty cool with Ryback being put into the ambulance from the top. Cena retains in an entertaining bout.

Over all this was an enjoyable event that had some good matches on it. I would recommend this event to any wrestling fan out there",1392854400,,3904,4.279132791327913

Payback replaced the pay-per-view ""No Way Out"" this year. I think we can all agree that last year's No Way Out return was awful.

Now, Payback took place in Chicago, Illinois, one of the best WWE cities and they did not disappoint again.

1. Intercontinental Championship:
  Wade Barrett (c) vs. Curtis Axel (W/ Paul Heyman) vs. The Miz
  Curtis Axel replaced Fandango for the match as Fandango suffered a concussion weeks before the event. This was a good opener as all three men got to showcase their talent and had their moments. The Miz took a beating from both men and came back strong against Axel & Barrett. The match, going to 10 1/2 minutes was a good start to the event. The crowd was hot and actually going for Curtis Axel. The ending was pretty unique in a way, as I've never seen something like that.
  Winner: Curtis Axel
  Match Rating: 7/10

2. Diva's Championship:
  Kaitlyn (c) vs. AJ Lee (W/ Big E. Langston)
  One word describes this match, AWESOME!!
  This is how a diva's match is supposed to be, WRESTLING, not hair-pulling and screaming every 5 seconds. These two divas put on a great match and was actually given a good amount of time, not the usual 3-4 minute matches we're used to seeing for the divas. AJ Lee was inside Kaitlyn's head and it clearly shows. Kaitlyn got to show her power and strength while AJ got to show her in-ring knowledge and the amazing Widow's Peak submission. A great back and forth match and all the divas in WWE need to watch this match and learn something.
  Winner: AJ Lee
  Match Rating: 9/10

3. U.S Championship:
  Dean Ambrose (c) vs. Kane
  With two straight title changes so far, could Dean change the bad luck and be the first to successfully defend his championship against the 7-foot monster Kane? This was your average big man vs. little man match, but was something worth watching with Dean Ambrose. He's so entertaining to watch and I laughed when he was stuck in the corner and begging Kane to hit him. There was a cool part where Ambrose attempts Old School, but was unsuccessful. The match was short, and the way the match ended was pretty mediocre.
  Winner: Dean Ambrose
  Match Rating: 7/10 (For Dean's entertaining performance)

We then a get a great video promoting Rob Van Dam's return to the WWE at Money in the Bank.

4. World Heavyweight Championship:
  Dolph Ziggler (c) (W/ AJ Lee & Big E. Langston) vs. Alberto Del Rio (W/Ricardo Rodriguez)
  This was a great match as it showcased how demented and sadistic Del Rio would get in order to become the World Champion once again. The match itself was good and it revolved around Dolph's concussion and Del Rio exposing the injury and taking advantage over it. It was a match that showed Dolph Ziggler never giving up and fighting back when he had the chance. Simply put, both men leave with their careers altered.
  Winner: Alberto Del Rio
  Match Rating: 9/10

5. Chris Jericho vs. CM Punk (W/ Paul Heyman)
  The crowd and everyone watching at home was eagerly anticipating the return of the hometown hero, The Best in the World CM Punk.
  Clearly just by how the match went and CM Punk's actions during the match and to Heyman, we can see that he's becoming a face again.
  The match is just a wrestling classic, as both men delivered 21 minutes of wrestling at it's finest. Both men have perfect chemistry together and the crowd was just hot for CM Punk. CM Punk shows signs of ring rust at first, but then looks like he never left. There was a part where Heyman actually almost costing his ""client"" the match. Great wrestling match and highly recommend it to pure wrestling fans.
  Winner: CM Punk
  Match Rating: 10/10

6. Tag Team Championship:
The Shield (Roman Reigns & Seth Rollins)(c) vs. Randy Orton & Daniel Bryan (Rated RK-NO!)
  Coming off a great wrestling match by Jericho and Punk, these 4 men did the best they can to follow up. It was a good tag team match with The Shield showing off their ability to take control over a match and Orton and Bryan actually working as a team at first. The match is nice and from the part where Orton tags Bryan in till the end of the match was fast-paced and great.
  Winner: The Shield
  Match Rating: 8/10

7. WWE Championship:
John Cena (c) vs. Ryback
-Three Stages of Hell (1st round: Lumberjack Match, 2nd round: Table Match, 3rd round: Ambulance match
  This is a rematch from the previous ppv, Extreme Rules. They put on a entertaining match at Extreme Rules and the same is to be said here. The lumberjack stipulation was stupid in my opinion as it's not really a great match. Can you name a lumberjack match that was actually memorable or considered classic? It was short, but we see a nice dive to Ryback and the lumberjacks by John Cena. The second round was a tables match and Ryback immediately went for the tables. It was an average match, but a bone-crushing finish to the table segment. The third round was the ambulance match. This was the longest and best out of the 3 stages and it was brutal (to PG standards) and there were moments where it seemed over for both men. A nice, but over the top finish to the match that makes you think that the ambulance van wasn't real.
  Winner: John Cena (2-1)
  Match Rating: 9.5/10

Overall, great Payback and expect to see this event again next year.

For the blu-ray quality, it's as perfect as you can get.
  It's presented in widescreen format and the pq was crystal clear and perfect. It's nice to see a WWE PPV on bluray, then a dvd. They still need to work on perfecting the audio, but other than that, it was great.
Some nice blu ray exclusive bonus features as well from the Raw and Smackdown before Payback.

Blu-Ray Quality: 9/10
Special Features: 10/10
Overall: Highly Recommended.",1375488000,3,5877,4.541030534351145

Chicago, IL

#1 Intercontiental championship match: Wade Barrett(c) vs. The Miz vs. Curtis Axel
Here we go, first match up on this Pay-Per-View.
Good way to start the show. Good work here, all men had a chance to shine. It is a shame that Wade Barrett isn't in the main event. But anyways. The ending was great! Curtis Axel covering Barrett while he was in the figure four. Was a great heel way for Axel to win, and Chicago ate it up. Winner and new Intercontiental champion, Curtis Axel. 3/5 stars

#2 Divas championship match: Kaitlyn(c) vs. AJ Lee
Wow. An entertaining divas match, I sure am liking this rivalry with AJ and Kaitlyn. Her spears are beautiful. Good match up here. Love AJ's submission move. Winner by submission and new Divas champion, AJ Lee. 2.5/5 stars

#3 United States championship match: Dean Ambrose(c) vs. Kane
A decent match up here. Really not much to say here, favorite spot was when Ambrose went for the Undertaker's old school.
Winner and still the United States champion, Dean Ambrose. 2/5 stars.

#4 World Heavyweight championship match: Dolph Ziggler(c) vs. Alberto Del Rio
I really, really enjoyed this one. They pulled a ""Double Turn"" here. Ziggler is coming off of a concussion and Del Rio went right after Ziggler's head. Aggressively. The commentators would talk it up too. Loved it. Ziggler sold it well. He's definately the future and he may bring out the best of Del Rio. After a number of brutal kicks, winner and new World Heavyweight champion, Alberto Del Rio. 3.5/5 stars.

#5 Punk's return: CM Punk vs. Chris Jericho
I don't know why am I still amazed by the reaction that CM Punk gets in Chi-town, but its awesome. Hometown hero for sure.
These two guys are argubly two of the best, in the world. Right now. Always putting on great shows and matches. They stole the show, and who thought they wouldn't? Its Punk's hometown. Jericho and Punk bring out the best in each other. Great back and forth action here. Near fall after near fall. Winner after two consecutives GTS', CM Punk. 4.5/5

#6 WWE Tag Team championships match: The Shield's Reigns & Rollins vs. Daniel Bryan & Randy Orton
The crowd was drained a bit from the previous match, and who can blame them? But they still delivered. Bryan is amazing in the ring. Orton was, and still is, one of my favorites.  The Shield is great as well. They put on a real good match here! The ednign was great. What a move Rollins has. Looks sick and painful. Winner and still Tag Team champions, The Shield. 4/5 stars

MAIN EVENT #7 WWE championship, Three Stages of Hell match: John Cena(c) vs. Ryback
First Fall- Lumberjack match.
We got 30 lumberjacks here, and its a decent match up here. Good spot when Cena dives onto the Ryback and the lumberjacks. Ryback wins after a Shellshock. Ryback-1  Cena-0
Second Fall- Tables match.
The way Ryback was trying to put Cena through a table in a unique way. Liked that. Cena wins this fall after a AA through the table. Ryback-1  Cena-1
Third Fall- Ambulance match.
Starts off with Ryback putting Cena through the announcer table. Lots of spots in this one. Cena wins with putting Ryback through the top of the Ambulance with an AA. Ryback-1  Cena-2
Winner and still the WWE champion, John Cena. 3.5/5 stars

5710046,3,B00CAYH2NM,"Intercontinental Champion Wade Barrett vs. The Miz vs. Curtis Axel - This was originally scheduled for a triple threat with Fandango but was replaced by Axel due to the concussion he suffered.  Heyman played a important part right from the start advising Axel to stay to the outside & pick his moments which we did see from time to time along with other action such as moments where one man hit an offensive move on his opponent only for the third man to deliver another maneuver right after, everyone in the match having a one on one face off at some point in the match, everyone breaking up pin attempts, and plenty of back & forth sequences with an ending that I've never seen before in this type of match.  This was a non-stop action opening match that showcased each man well at moments but will mostly be remembered for the history this result made on the day of this event.

Divas Champion Kaitlyn vs. A.J. Lee - Kaitlyn was out for revenge for her entire ""secret admirer"" being nothing more than a setup for months & she showcased that when he went after A.J. right away pounding on her & even tossing her over the announce table before A.J. was able to recover & target Kaitlyn's neck with neckbreakers & the sleeperhold while Kaitlyn used power moves like clotheslines & spears as both women traded momentum countering each others holds like Kaitlyn powering out of A.J.'s crucifix & Kaitlyn catching A.J. during a crossbody attempt only to reverse that into the Black Widow before one woman made a mistake of being more concentrated on beating her at her own game than winning the match.  This was hands down the best Divas' match in recent history as both girls came into this match & played it out as if this was a fight.

United States Champion Dean Ambrose vs. Kane - The crowd was heavily behind Ambrose with his past history on the independent scene in that area as Kane started out overpowering him with punches & suplex & side slam however Dean worked over the knee to the point where Kane was starting to show effects of it but still resorted to power moves like various slams & clotheslines including his trademark one from the top rope with Dean still bring a fight with holds like the sleeper & even slapping Kane who responded with an uppercut before Dean off advantage of his environment with an offensive move.  This match was just average at best.

World Champion Dolph Ziggler vs. Alberto Del Rio - Dolph came out to a heavy amount of crowd support & kept stalling early while still showing signs of his recent concussion causing Del Rio to target his head with kicks & knees along with a back suplex that bounced his head off the mat before going to the outside with his head bouncing off the mat & announce table to the point where Big E. Langston tried to step in only for Del Rio to continue to be ruthless with headbutts & more kicks but Dolph was able to keep kicking out & mount some offense but easily showing effects such as nothing getting most of the Fameasser & a Zig Zag that landed him on his head as Del Rio just continued to kick in the skull of Dolph to the point where the crowd completely turned on Alberto.  This wasn't a competitive match that we know they're capable of doing in favor of telling the story of Dolph fighting against the odds & Del Rio being completely ruthless causing the fans to favor one man over the other (similar to another match that was held on a Chicago PPV around 16 years earlier) & did an excellent job at what this match was designed to do.

C.M. Punk vs. Chris Jericho - Punk's first appearance since RAW two weeks after WrestleMania as both men stated grounding each other early with Jericho starting to gain an advantage before Punk was able counter his springboard dropkick to gain the advantage working over Jericho's arm with a keylock as Jericho picked up the pace with a double axe handle & bulldog.  Both men from here started to trade momentum with countering each other's offense such a lionsault into a swinging neckbreaker only for the lionsault to be executed after countering a bulldog, the Walls Of Jericho reversed into the Anaconda Vice but Jericho eventually applying the hold after countering the GTS while both men just went back & forth with their offense like Punk's Savage elbow & GTS along with Jericho catching Punk in mid-air while Paul Heyman made his presence known at one point only for it to distract both men.  This match was the high quality that's expected & deliver from both men against each other.

Tag Team Champions The Shield vs. Randy Orton & Daniel Bryan - The Shield used the strategy of ""divide & conquer"" as they worked over each man individually by double teaming in the corner & keeping them grounded while taunting their partner allowing them to distract the referee before Orton started to fight back suplexing one into the other in the corner while Bryan attacked both men over with dropkicks & a suicide dive that hit Orton as well while later Orton went for the RKO only to collide into Bryan & later shove him into a spear from Reigns.  This tag match wasn't much past continuing the build the issues for weeks between Orton & Bryan while also still playing off the fact that The Shield wrestle as a team while their opponents wrestle as individuals.

3 Stages Of Hell Match: WWE Champion John Cena vs. Ryback - For those who haven't seen a ""3 Stages Of Hell"" match before, it's a traditional 2 Out Of 3 Falls match with the twist being that each different fall would be contested under a different stipulation which in this case was the falls being a lumberjack match, table, and a Ambulance Match if the third fall was necessary (and lets be honest, they wouldn't tease all 3 falls & not do them).  Ryback was easily overpowering Cena with various slams & headbutts while also taking advantage of the lumberjacks on the outside by tossing Cena to the lumberjacks on the outside who kept beating on him eventually causing a brawl between everyone on the outside causing Cena to take action in a way that brings back memories of Kid Kash in ECW.  Ryback continued to work over Cena in the Tables Match using the steel steps to both throw Cena into & throw at him which ended up breaking a table on it's own with both men used it to ram each other while also avoiding going through the table in different ways from flipping it over to just escaping when another was going for their signature move.  The brawl continued in the third fall to the outside with the announce table getting destroyed & making it's way to the back to the ambulance with various parts of the vehicle getting destroyed from a punch through the window to being whipped into the door tearing it off while various parts were used as weapons such as the broken door & fender & siren lights as they tore apart the ambulance from the bottom to the top...literally.  Both Cena & Ryback are limited in what they could do so these ""no rules"" environments work best for them as this was an entertaining brawl.

This PPV was a mixed bag as you had some matches that ranged from very good to strong performances, some matches that just seemed to be there, and some that were just there to push along a storyline but I'll give it credit in that this was the best WWE PPV in the month of June for the last 3 years so it's not something I would rush out to get but it's worth a rental or a couple of bucks you won't miss.",1374710400,4,7411,4.484421364985163

All this PPV offered was another boring episode of Raw or Smackdown.  Every match was boring, scripted, and predictable.  Now that is out of the way, lets talk about the 3 stages of hell match.  First up was WWE trying to 1 up ECW on their Extreme rules PPV this year, because if they were they made a foul of themselves.  I mean since when did the WWE have their last Ambulance match, let alone a 3 stages of hell match.  1 stage a lumberjack match, In a 3 stages of hell match c-mon I could have made a better first stage than this.  1 fall goes to Rhyback. 2 stage A tables match.  The match was to short, predictable, and the tables were fake. 2 fall goes to Cena.  3 fall the Ambulance match.  FAKE AND SCRIPTED, FAKE AND SCRIPTED.  The fact that the entire door of the ambulance came off and easy might I add and was used as a weapon, also the trap door on top of the ambulance that rhyback goes through that lets cena win the match which was shown clear as day I give props to WWE for covering that secret up, looked so real, not, it was simply laughable and as predicted guess who won the match 3 fall of course goes to Cena.  Anyone who gave this PPV more than 1 star are the wrestling fans I truly hate, absolutely no respect for the superstars, or the ,legacy of the wwe.  Leave this PPV for the kids.  Being a life long WWE fan and watching magic on other current WWE PPV's all I can say is what a disappointment.",1374451200,,1668,4.20440251572327
5710048,4,B00CAYH2NM,"The Miz VS IC Champion Wade Barrett VS Curtis Axel: I hate the Miz & the IC title is a joke just like Barrett's reign. The match was alright & I did like the ending. A nice tribute to Axel's father, Mr. Perfect, on Father's Day.

Diva's Champion Katiliyn VS AJ: I usually don't watch diva's matches but AJ has made it watchhable. AJ wins the diva in another could have been on Raw match.

US Champion Dean Ambrose VS Kane: One of the reasons to watch WWE these days is the Shield. This is another good match but the feud is running out of fumes.

World Champion Dolph Ziggler VS Alberto Del Rio: Poor Ziggler. Won Money in the Bank 2012, held the briefcase for months while on a losing streak, & finally cashes it in. What happens? He gets ""injuried"" & loses the belt in his first PPV defense. This could be a good feud when Ziggler is healthy.

CM Punk VS Chris Jericho: Punk returned to WWE in his hometown. I loved his wrestling gear for tonight, paying tribute to the Stanley Cup champions. Very good match, probably best of the night.

Tag Team Champions The Shield (Rollins & Reigns) VS Orton & Bryan: 2 of the many reasons to watch WWE these days-Shield & Bryan. Just like the match with leader Ambrose vs Kane, it's good wrestling but the feud is losing steam.

Three Stages of Hell: Ryback VS WWE Champion Superman...I mean John Cena: This was a decent match with Ryback going 0-3 in PPV title chances. I might hate Cena but he can rise to the occassion on PPV's & this is no different.

There is also promos for the Wyatt Family & the returning RVD.

Wrestling wise this PPV is solid & delivers. However, with a 3 hour Raw each week the PPV loses it's meaning. Both Raw & Smackdown put PPV quailty matches on television so why pay $45 to watch it on PPV?",1374192000,2,1764,4.292168674698795

8579393,3,B00CAYH2NM,"Wwe's first Payback event, held in 2013, was a solid but comparatively underwhelming offering during time where the promotion seemed to be struggling during the usually strong post-Wrestlemania fallout. Although the card featured the return of CM Punk and the blow-off to the Cena/Ryback feud, nothing seemed to have the spark that elevated any performances or created a memorable moment.

Not Worth Watching: There wasn't anything on Payback that I considered unwatchable, but, in retrospect, the opening triple threat for the Intercontinental Title was an average match that led to a forgettable title reign for Curtis Axel. About the only thing worth remembering was the ending, which was quite surprising. Also, Kane and Dean Ambrose had an average match for the United States Title, and the main event Three Stages of Hell match for the WWE Championship lacked any really memorable spot or story.

Worth Watching: AJ Lee captured the Divas Championship from Kaitlyn in a very good match, right up there with Trish Stratus's battles with Lita and Victoria. Dolph Ziggler lost his newly won World Heavyweight Championship to former champ Alberto Del Rio in a match thay wasn't great action but told a very good story with Dolph's head trauma. There's a reason he's an IWC favorite. Randy Orton and Daniel Bryan teamed up in a decent tag match against The Shield's Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns.

Match of the Night: CM Punk returned to his home town and fought Chris Jericho in a great one-on-one match that featured no gimmicks little outside distractions. Good stuff, though I'd probably put it outside their 2012 series. I'd call this a low match of the year candidate.

All in all, a middle of the road event that was quickly forgotten and for good reason.",1405555200,,1763,4.98639455782313
