8171474,1,B000MRNWMO,"Even though he get's top billing on the dvd case and is listed as "" special guest appearance by..."" in the opening credits, Cameron Mitchell does not appear in this horrible movie, except mabbe as a ""voice over the phone"" appearance as Mr. Big, the crime boss we never see.
Now I know that if you're looking for a Cameron Mitchell 1980's action movie you really don't expect much in terms of cinematic art, but you at least expect him to be in the movie!!
And this film is truly wretched. The print used is washed out and jumpy. It's hard to see anything happening at night,though you're probably better off for that.
Leo Fong, muscular, but somewhat out of shape and dumpy plays a wrongly accused death row convict who gets sprung by W.O.P. (World Organization of Peace) to eliminate a group of evil terrorist types that want to unleash a deadly virus on countries that won't meet their insane demands. They employ slow moving (not slow motion) ninjas that are also somewhat dumpy and very inept. Fong beats them up rather easily.
There's a pretty bad helicopter/car rescue scene, some brief nudity, a rat eating out a guy's stomach, bad checkered and stripped threads, several beat-up old cars without hubcaps that get blown up and lots of ninjas running around in costume in motel parking lots in broad daylight! No cops are to be found anywhere. Mabbe they were with Cameron Mitchell in some other movie.
Fong and Mitchell did appear together in the equally inept but pretty enjoyable KILLPOINT. Mitchell chews up the scenery pretty good in that one which features a remarkable scene where the bad-guy gun dealers bust in and machine-gun and kill every shopper in a supermarket!!! Lots of exploding shelf items.
However, avoid ENFORCER at all costs. It's just a very bad print of a really lame movie. And did I mention that Cameron Mitchell is not in it (or at least not this version). One star is being generous.",1229212800,,1917,4.691394658753709
