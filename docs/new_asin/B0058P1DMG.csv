Your pup will be eager to progress, at his level of learning, or with a little push from you. I have read or watched literally dozens and dozens of training materials, looking to improve or learn what I don't know, each time we get a new pup.  German Shepherds and Golden Retrievers, all have been hunting/tracking companions and part of the family. Yes you can teach a Shepherd to hunt/retrieve. This DvD relies on the use of choke chain pops.  I do not use a choke chain, but tailor their idea to me and our dog. Top tier training, I would buy it again.",1397260800,,696,4.387596899224806
