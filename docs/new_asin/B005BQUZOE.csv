8464171,5,B005BQUZOE,This was made by 8 different directors... Much better than the Bud Greenspan era of formulas. Marred by the murder of the Israeli athletes.h,1402531200,,140,4.875
8464172,4,B005BQUZOE,"I first saw this impressive documentary in 1974 shortly after having been made at the Munich Olympics in 1972 and it was fabulous for its sports photography and concept.  I have been trying to find it for years and when I saw it on Amazon, I purchased it immediately.  Still enjoyable for a lot of its slow-mo (Olga Korbet on the bars; 100 meter dash in 30 seconds) the excitement of the moment was gone,  Yet I still liked the way the famous massacre  of the Israeli wrestling team was handled in this film - tragic and sad interjection of politics with the recognition that the Olympics had already lost its virginity.",1393891200,,620,4.508928571428571
8464173,5,B005BQUZOE,"This 1974 Golden Globe-winner (for Best Documentary) is a beautiful film, made in a very artistic way by a group of world-renowned movie directors. It may be the best of all such Olympic documentaries, and is my favorite for sure, esp. since the outstanding 1972 Munich Olympic Games were my favorite Games--the horrible murder of the Israeli athletes by Palestinians, and the highly political officiating, notwithstanding.

From a technical perspective, this DVD is NOT 1.33:1 aspect ratio as advertised on Amazon; in fact, it's a WONDERFUL 16:9 widescreen-enhanced version, filling up a 16x9 screen without any black bars.  The picture quality is SO superb that it looks darned close to high-definition on my HD screen, instead of looking soft-focus and poor on an HD TV (since it is only a DVD after all, and not a blu ray). No, the picture quality of this obviously remastered DVD is just outstanding when compared with the commercially-made VHS tape of years ago, which I own as well.

I highly recommend this DVD on every basis!",1373760000,2,1034,4.965317919075145
8464174,5,B005BQUZOE,"The film allows 8 directors to take a single Olympic event and make a short film.  The best sequences are the weight lifters and the high jump.  This is first class, old school documentary filmmaking and comes from the David Wolper school of elegant documentary cinema.",1347408000,2,269,4.826086956521739
8464175,5,B005BQUZOE,"Visions of Eight is a documentary about the Munich Olympics from 1972 that started out as a unique idea--let 8 well known movie directors each make a short film, 10-12 minutes on any aspect of the Munich games they wish. And that's what you get here, 8 short little films each covering some piece of the Games and the result is a rather uneven film entertainment wise with events like the 100 meter dash and weight lifting being covered. But the 8 different and rather forgetable stories aren't what makes this DVD so compelling; its the overarching and tragic events that occurred AT the games themselves, the Israeli athletes being murdered, that dwarfs anything these directors produced. As a 16 yr old high school kid involved with Track & Field at the time the games were going on, I remember the shock & confusion of reading what was happening in Munich in the newspapers. The murder of the Israeli's just didn't 'make sense' in the context of the ""world coming together every 4 years for spirited competition"" as the Olympics describes itself.

So what you get here is a movie that's pretty forgetable as a stand alone piece of entertainment, (their are much better documentaries of other Olympic Games available), BUT as a film made at the time and place of what is probably the most unforgetable Olympics of all time, this DVD is priceless. It is a 'time capsule' of the vision we had of the Olympic Games prior to 1972, of potential peace & harmony, before the shocking events at Munich changed everything. Its for that reason, this film is worth watching and keeping in my view. One of the 8 segments attempts to cover the Israeli murder as its happening, certainly not what the Director had planned to cover I'm sure. But that piece of the film is rather 'simple' & 'limited' because it was created so close to the actual events. A brilliant documentary that DOES cover the killing of the Israeli's at Munich and the huge ramifications of it is ""One Day in September"" and that is a superb film that is the...accomplished and thoughtful counterpart to ""Visions of Eight"". Watched together these two films give one an amazing picture of an event that took place almost 40 years ago and is still effecting the world today. I highly recommend this DVD if for no other reason than it documents a time, and provides a 'vision' of the Olympic Games we will never see again.",1327536000,2,2378,4.661904761904762
