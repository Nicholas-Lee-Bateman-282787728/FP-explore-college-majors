8546069,2,B00A1AU6E4,"Madison Avenue is a 1961 B-drama about the influence of advertising, based on a 1951 novel called The Build Up Boys.

Handsome Dana Andrews (1909-92) stars as an amoral ad exec on the rise. Andrews appeared in over 100 films, including memorable roles in The Westerner (1941), Ox Bow Incident (1943), Laura (1944), A Walk in the Sun (1945), and The Best Years of Our Lives (1946).

Pretty Jeanne Crain (1925-2003) was nominated for an Oscar for Pinky (1949) and was popular in the 40s and 50s and then transitioned to TV in the 60s. Crain plays a reporter who helps Andrews as he romances her.

Eleanor Parker (1922- 2013) plays Andrews boss. She is probably best known for her role as the Baroness in The Sound of Music (1965). She was nominated 3 times for an Oscar (Caged, Detective Story, and Interrupted Melody) and once for an Emmy (The Eleventh Hour) and a Golden Globe (Brackens World).

Eddie Albert (1906-2005) plays an exec in the milk business. Albert was twice nominated for an Oscar (Roman Holiday in 1954 and The Heartbreak Kid in 1973) as well as a Golden Globe (Teahouse of the August Moon in 1957 and The Longest Yard in 1974) Hes best known for his role in the TV series Green Acres (1956  1971), but my personal favorite is his role as the cowardly captain in Attack (1956).

Look for Kathleen Freeman (1919-2001) as Parkers secretary. She was a staple on TV in hundreds of roles in the 60s (I Love Lucy, The Beverly Hillbillies) and 70s (Hogans Heroes).

Henry Daniell (1894-1963) appears. He made nearly 100 films between 1929 and 1964, often as a villain. He played Prof. Moriarty, Joseph Goebbels, and countless evil Englishmen in films like The Sea Hawk and Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex.

This was the final film of director H. Bruce Humberstone (1901-1984), known mostly for his Charlie Chan films, and as a founder of the Directors Guild.

The film has good acting and snappy dialogue, but its a little hard to get attached to the characters, none of whom have any redeeming qualities. The plot seems a little crazy and there are all sorts of questionable scenes (e.g., Andrews and Parker have scrambled eggs and bacon in a nightclub). Based on the 1951 novel, it seems a bit dated by 1961.",1448150400,,2225,4.641221374045801

I am not spending money - no matter if it is $5.00 or $20.00 on a DVD that's quality is less than the VHS release.",1403481600,7,460,4.168539325842697
