7932974,4,B000057FL4,"The film is oddly complex, and features the iconic Ingrid Pitt, and a very young Leslie-Anne Down.

The title is a simple vehicle to get easy marketing and distribution off the ""Dracula"" association, but has nothing to do with either Vlad Tsepes III or Bram Stoker's vision.

The tale follows the a widowed Countess, her long-time secret lover and aide-de-camp of her late husband, her sycophantic nursemaid, and pet scholar of the late Count's in a tale of cat-and-mouse to satisfy the Countesses's unholy desires to restored to youth and libido. In an accidental injury she is splattered with the blood of her young virgin serving girl, and finds her youthful good looks restored in her face. Quickly putting two-and-two together she enlists her nursemaid to bring the girl to her, slays her (off camera) and baths in her blood.

Young Captain Toth, he-of-the-fullly-loaded-trousers, is the son of the late Count's best friend, and has inherited his horses and stables and a cottage on the Count's extensive grounds and estate, making him a man of some relative means over his previous life as a mere soldier.

The Countess in her rejuvenated state tosses aside her old lover and peruses the young stud, but her beauty periodically fades, and she is uglier each time in the cycle of blood-beauty-crone.

Promising to keep her old lover on the side and keep him in her favors in her young state, the Countess quickly ensnares her old lover into procuring local virgins for her baths.

Meanwhile, her daughter has returned from Vienna, but is kidnapped and held prisoner by a mute peasant who wishes to ravish her but is constrained by unknown forces, devotions, loyalty and fears. But his tensions between his duty and his desires are all too evident as the daughter Countess Elena (Downs) stays in his humble hut for weeks on end.

To say more would give away too much, but the sets are very lavish, the acting of even the minor characters is well executed, and the motivations to damnation for all the characters (except oddly, the nursemaid...her motives are never really explained) are believable. It isn't Nabakov, and Pitt has a few scenes where she chews up the scenery, but by and large this is among the better Hammer offerings.

One caution for the scrupulous and pious though: a la Joe Bob Briggs at the movies, there are a lot of flashes of female breasts in this film. I mean lots. I lost count, but it is A cups to double DDs throughout. Girl on camera = 50% chance you are going to see her bazooms. Odd, but there it is, so it is bordering on a ""tittieflick.""",1359676800,3,2575,4.719376391982182
