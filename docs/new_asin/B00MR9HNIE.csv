8674165,5,B00MR9HNIE,Great Bruce DVD! (not that there's a bad one) Lots of very interesting footage and a must-have for a Bruce fan.,1465603200,3,111,4.333333333333333
8674166,5,B00MR9HNIE,"I am a Springsteen fan who was lucky, lucky, lucky to grow up in NJ... (just a few years younger than Bruce).  I've seen every tour since the Darkness album.  Maybe seen him 50 times but ""when will I see him next?""  is the only thing that matters.  I buy everything that Bruce releases, of course, and lots of other DVDs not authorized by him.  Most of the latter I watch once and then recycle.  ""Down the tracks"" is surprisingly good/great!  I get the sense that the people behind ""Down the tracks"" DVDs are real Springsteen fans and they include real, honest, knowledgeable Springsteen historians. Highly recommended for serious Springsteen fans.  Immediately bought one to share with my sister.",1448150400,5,697,4.798319327731092

8674168,5,B00MR9HNIE,"This is an amazing set.  The first DVD traces Springsteen's influences, by showing rare concert footage of the artists, and then playing clips from Springsteen's concerts to show exactly how they influenced him with specific song examples.  The several participating musicologists are experts on Springsteen's history and do a really good job of explaining.  Among the artists that are highlighted are Orbison, Dylan, Haley, Holly and Bonds.  I enjoyed the first DVD so much, that I was sure the second DVD would be filler; but it wasn't.  The second DVD called ""In His Own Words"", were excerpts of interviews and speeches, none of which I'd seen, and all very entertaining.",1424995200,7,674,5.090909090909091
