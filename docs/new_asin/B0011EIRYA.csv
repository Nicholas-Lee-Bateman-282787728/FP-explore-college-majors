8241525,5,B0011EIRYA,"This is a great program that integrates a bunch of different techniques from Qigong, Yoga, and Energy balancing.  This is not an aerobic workout, but it will make you more flexible and will balance your energy.  This is just what I need after a typical crazy day and is a great start to a lazy weekend.  It's a great counterpoint to my more vigorous workouts and the stretches and balance and coordination drills are nicely challenging.
There are several exercises that can stand alone that I try to remember to use to manage stress through my day.
All in all, I'm quite pleased with this program.",1199318400,10,597,4.613207547169812
