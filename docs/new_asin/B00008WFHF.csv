1864539,5,B00008WFHF,My mother bought it for my 13 month old daughter who has trouble sitting still for 5 minutes let alone 30.  We sat together and watched the whole DVD with her on my lap.  She couldn't take her eyes off the screen.  I highly recommend it to any parent who wants to help their children learn about what goes on in the skys above us.,1060905600,2,330,4.046153846153846
1864540,2,B00008WFHF,"We own all of the Baby Einstein DVD's and the one's made before the Disney buy out were far better than those made after.  This one was the worst so far, my 18 mo. old doesn't even like it.  They do talk about the planets and name them.  But what do bubbles have to do with planets?  The music was good (even though their were a few Disney songs thrown in) but overall the movie was dull and pointless.",1060819200,,402,4.050632911392405
1864541,2,B00008WFHF,"We have the Baby Einstein - World Animals DVD and my 14-month old absolutely LOVES that one.  I ran out and bought this one thinking it would have more ""action"" and puppet skits.  Instead, it just shows pictures of the sky.  My son was bored after the first 10 minutes of this and started playing elsewhere.  Nothing about this video captured his attention, except for the occasional baby and puppet.
I would not recommend this edition for active babies.",1060732800,,454,4.708860759493671
1864542,5,B00008WFHF,"For all of us baby Einstein fans that where so worried when Disney took over, and the release of the creepy baby Newton video.  Have no fear.  Not only did Disney not ruin this video, I just might be there best one yet! a sweet mix of great music and nursery rhymes.  With some of the best visuals of any baby Einstein video. An instant favorite with my 2.5 year old and 10 month old.  I cant say enough about how great I think this video is.",1060732800,5,442,4.045977011494253
1864543,2,B00008WFHF,"This new entry into the ""Baby Einstein"" family was a dissapointment. It was very clear from the moment the title came up (with the new font change, and intro screen)this was no Julie-Aigner Clark production.
The entire look and feel of the DVD was well in a word ""Disneyized"". Now excuse me,  as I am a Director of Marketing, so I do understand the value of a ""brand"".  Disney has taken the ""Baby Einstein brand"" and messed with it.  What made the Baby Einstein series so rare, (and established it's brand) was the mix of home spun/child touches (ie hand drawings, fun characters with great music that drew my child and many of my friends children in for 30 glorious minutes- laughing and pointing to each character and scene)
The Baby Galileo DVD didn't follow the format, look or feel of any of the others in the series- as I shared in a word it was Disneyized- panned/commerical touches which left my daughter (and me) flat.
While I know it is important to expand and grow the series Disney should have never lost sight of the real value to the mix- Julie Aigner Clark. This was the first Baby Einstein where my daughter (24 months) got up out of her chair and went to play with her toys.
Disney- Listen up! I don't know where she is- but BRING JULIE BACK!",1060214400,,1259,4.441558441558442
1864544,2,B00008WFHF,"I was rather disappointed with this DVD. I'm a mother of a two year old, and we have a number of the Baby Einstein products (DVDs & videos, puppets, books). (Favorite DVDs are Baby Van Gogh, Speakspeare, and Newton.) While the earlier videos were made with a great deal of artistic and creative flair, this seems like a pale imitation. (To me, it feels like this video was conceived of and designed by a bunch of executive-types in suits, sitting around a board room table and borrowing bits and pieces of earlier videos.) Specifically:
(1) Baby Galileo is NOT cute. He's small and sort of creepy, and always looks surprised - whereas in past videos, the hand puppets could show a range of emotion. The sunglass-wearing duck in Baby Newton, for instance, was cool and suave; whereas the other duck was excitable and frustrated. Same actual puppets, yet detectably different personalities/ emotions. They were fun to watch; Baby Galileo kangaroo is not.
(2) Past puppet hosts of the videos had a logical link - a goat as the host of Baby Van Gogh, who is named Vincent Van Goat. (Ha, ha, inside joke for parents.) But - a kangaroo (and his mommy) as an astronomer?... Yeah, the connection is SO obvious. (Not.) Also, my daughter keeps calling him ""cat"" (i.e., doesn't really look like a kangaroo).
(3) Whoever was the puppeteer this time isn't very good. This puppeteer tries to imitate past videos' puppets' movements - such as Bard the Dragon's funny mouth movements in Baby Mozart (I think). Lousy job. The puppets move too fast, lack nuanced expressions. Also, they're not always completely fitted to the puppeteer's hand - in particular, in the 'Evening Stroll' sequence.
(4) The last 10 minutes or so of the video focus on the 9 planets, and galaxies. Since these videos are aimed at children under three years old, I would question the wisdom of including things that pre- and newly verbal children can't see, touch, or really comprehend at this point. Fine for a five year old. But for my daughter, Mars, Venus, and Pluto are really just different colored circles.
I plan on returning this to the bookstore this weekend.",1060214400,5,2127,4.782608695652174
1864545,5,B00008WFHF,"I first came to know the Baby Einstein series while being a nanny for my now niece and nephew. I not being a mommy then thought they were corny and strange. But I still enjoied listening to the classical music. When I had my first child in 2002. I said what the heck and gave the Baby Einstein collection a try with my lil man. Lets just put it this way THANK YOU MRS CLARK and BABY EINSTEIN CREW. You are all genius'!! I highly reccommend the entire Baby Einstein Series to any parents-to-be, new parents, veteran parents, and grandparents.

1864567,5,B00008WFHF,"A lot of disgruntled reviews here, but my baby loves this. I think the suggested age rating might be off though. It's intended for 9 months + but mine has been watching it since she was a newborn and absolutely loves it. We only have 2 othe BE videos from hand me down, so we didn't notice any repetition in the music used in other videos. The puppets are cute and all of the toys and scenes used are meant to hint at the shapes of celestial bodies, which she finds captivating. I can see how older kids might be bored with it. Also it's 30+ minutes long which is more than I can say for other BE videos. Love this one.",1436054400,,619,4.081967213114754

The others have been very well used. However this one has so many basic mistakes it makes me cringe to even watch it. The one that really gets under my nerves the most is the pronunciation of Uranus, they actually pronounce it Ur Anus which just about everyone knows is the joke way of pronouncing it. It makes me wonder how many editors and listeners this production went through. So disappointed in this one.",1425600000,5,585,4.528301886792453

1864636,5,B00008WFHF,"This is an introduction to the world of space exploration and the sky.  This is Baby Einstein, hence the word, BABY.  Since I can speak from experience as a former Early Interventionist, I would venture guess that THE OTHER REVIEWER'S child is probably developing rapidly, and needs something more developmentally appropriate to engage him/herself.  Babies can become overwhelmed with too much information, so this is perfect for babies.  My 7 month old LOVES this, and he cries when it's over.  For me, it's a MIRACLE, since I am now a stay-at-home mom by choice.  If you look at the credits at the end, they get a lot of their illustrations from NASA.  This was a great way for me to introduce my baby to my husband's job and the world of space.  ALSO RECOMMENDED: THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE SPACE! (A DR. SEUSS BOARD BOOK that's for preschoolers but is engaging b/c of the rhyming and colors for my little one)",1267488000,4,908,4.63125
1864637,2,B00008WFHF,"I live in a french speaking country, and I bought this DVD because usually Baby Einstein DVDs have langagues options.  In Baby Galileo, on the pocket, it's written ""Language tracsks (Spanish,French and English)""  But when you play the DVD, on the menu, you don't even have the section ""languages"" in order to chose the language you want... I was disapointed... But the DVD doesn't seem that bad... There's a lot of things to learn about the sky... It's sad that my son cannot understand it...",1253145600,,492,4.776470588235294
1864638,5,B00008WFHF,"The format is pretty typical for the Baby Einstein series:  lots of classical music, lots of toys, lots of planets, stars, etc., though unlike others, there are few children in this one.  The star of the show is Baby Galileo (who interestingly was a kangaroo in his childhood), and my daughter cannot get enough of him, crying out ""Roo!  Roo!""

1864640,5,B00008WFHF,"I have watched this DVD several times with my four month old niece.  She loves it, and so do I!  My niece is a little young for it, but she loves the parts with the puppets and the repeated sections between chapters.  And she enjoys the music and the scenes of clouds or stars.  I have found it to be quite interesting myself.  I love the beautiful scenes of the sun rising and setting, the clouds going by, the moon rising, the stars filling the sky, the planets, and especially the gorgeous scenes of different galaxies.

I don't see a problem with having vocabulary that young kids aren't likely to get.  It is still good to expose them to new words and ideas, even if they don't understand it yet.  I love the mix of real nature scenes and the toys and children playing with them.  It is exposing my baby niece to new faces and scenes of the world that she won't otherwise be exposed to.  And the classical music is beautiful too!",1215302400,,934,4.316091954022989

It's right at her level and will probably continue to teach her as she gets older. Other videos often bore her after about 5 minutes or so. I'm impressed!",1205366400,,327,4.466666666666667
1864642,4,B00008WFHF,"If you're going to buy a children's video, by all means buy this video for your two year old and older child.  I highly recommend it compared to other kids' videos because it is engaging, fun, educational and not cartoon animated or fast-paced.

Having said that, I have a beef with the title ""Baby Einstein"" and marketing this to BABIES.  It seems to imply that watching these videos is good for babies, which they are NOT!  These videos may be great for older kids, but definitely NOT for babies' brains!

After some research I found out that: 1) brain wave activity in babies is slower when watching television than when sleeping. 2) for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of acquiring an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%,  3) for every hour of television viewed daily at 4 yrs old, there is a significant odds increase for being a bully later on, and 4)consistent, heavy television viewing (more than 2 hrs daily) throughout early childhood can cause behavior, sleep and attention problems.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under 2, and no more than two hours of media (tv, videos, video games & computers) daily after age 2!  I think it's important for parents and caregivers to be aware of this so they can make better informed choices. I hope it encourages some people to limit television usage for babies and look for other outlets when possible.

For those looking to calm babies and build better brains, I recommend baby carriers because studies show that infants who are carried an extra 3 hours per day cry 40% less, and this effect is lasting over time!  Frequently held babies pick up verbal skills faster and develop better core muscle strength and balance.  Also, learning to communicate in sign language can reduce frustration and tantrums, accelerate language development and promote parent-child bonding in infants and toddlers.",1200355200,,1925,4.928792569659443

I noticed that it hadn't really kept my child's attention as well as some of the other B.E. videos but the parts that he did pay particular attention were the hubble telescope images. I personally *love* images of space so I'll probably buy this video anyways for later when my son is older (he's only 7 mos now) but not just becuase of the great imagery but because it introduces words like, galaxy, constellation, names of planets, etc... and I believe he'll appreciate that more when he's a bit older.",1167350400,,737,4.548872180451128

When he watches he looks back and forth from the video to me with a huge smile and look of wonder, giving us a great opportunity to bond and learn.  The little kangaroo kid is so funny and makes little noises rather than words to express himself and his mommy is so loving, always there for a hug or reassurance! The 'plot' is well played out, moving through different areas of sky explorations.  The photography is absolutely stunning and the music is perfect for a young child.  I can't recommend this video enough.  To this day, my grandson is thrilled when he hears ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" (making a star twinkle with his hands) and can even pick this song out when it is revised or used with different words.",1146096000,,851,4.464516129032258

However, if you read the credits, Julie Clark had nothing to do with making this one.  There are certain, subtle things that Disney does and does not do that make this lack the charm of the older BE videos.  For example, transitions from image to image are not phrased to the music and are random.  And in the video shots of mobiles, the camera is also rotating, which ruins the simplicity and pleasant effect of watching the mobile.  That being said, we still really like the video.  It has great shots of stars and planets, and is relaxing to watch in the evening.",1143072000,2,743,4.466666666666667

Instead of hearing the generally obnoxious children's show sounds pouring from our TV, the classical music provides a nice contrast.  My daughter, who is usually very very active, even sits still to enjoy the Baby Einstein videos.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because this DVD just can't top Baby Mozart, our very favorite!

These dvds are the only thing that will actually keep her still when eating or when it's time to calm down before nap and bed. I was excited to introduce her to a new concept and this movie is just horrible. It is very cheaply made and it keeps showing the same garden twirling star toy over and over again. You would really think they would find more creative toys to put into the video.

So why 2 stars and not 1? I do like that the planets are named and footage of the real planets are shown as well as the stars. But other than that, it is just terrible and not a learning experience nor a tool for me to begin her quiet time.",1139011200,,797,4.209150326797386

Baby Einstein dvd's have planted such wonderful seeds of knowledge in my child's life.  He loves learning and has taken an interest in the planets.  Quite by accident we were at a hobby and craft store and he points to a poster and says ""Hey, Mummy...it's Saturn!""

And he was correct.  He'd learned that from Baby Galileo.  And then began our independent study of planets.

The earlier videos (Bach, Beethoven, Mozart) were for music/color stimulation and the later videos (Van Gogh, Shakespeare) have planted these little knowledge seeds that I can expound upon.

My son has grown up with the Baby Einstein family (Bach was our first) and now I'm glad to see there is a Little Einsteins in development.  For slightly older children (my son turns 4 in 2 weeks) that will take them on adventures around the world.  We can't wait!

Before it would pause for much longer periods to let the child see and absorb what is being shown.  With Galileo, you don't get as much chance to see before it goes on to the next scene.

This DVD not only grabbed the interest of my baby, but my four year old and seven year old cannot get enough.  In this DVD, the planets are characters with faces which really helps my kids identify them.  Baby Galileo shows planets that to a baby are hard to focus on.  That's why the faces on the planets in ""MY FANTASTIC FIELD TRIP TO THE PLANETS"" was a great idea.  After watching only once, they knew all nine planets!  The songs are terrific and have fun, fact-ladden lyrics that my older children now sing all the time.  I am very impressed.  My baby enjoys the planet faces, while my older children are really learning from the DVD.  So, Baby Galileo is just okay for very young babies, but the favorite in our house and one that will not be quickly outgrown is ""MY FANTASTIC FIELD TRIP TO THE PLANETS.""",1122076800,3,1125,4.386473429951691

He loves the puppet sequences and they always make him laugh.  This definitely keep his attention through the whole 30 min or so so that I can get some stuff done around the house.  I love that it teaches about the sky and planets and the photos they run across the screen are beautiful and eye catching - there aren't just random things going across the screen that have nothing to do with what's being talked about like some of the other videos.  I like that this one doesn't have any kids in it either - the kids in this series look like they have no clue what's going on and detract from the movies in my opinion.

This one focuses on the sun, clouds, stars, moon, planets (it will name and show each of the planets), galaxies and then finally space.  It shows great pictures of these things.  Of course, it does have the usual spinning toy things and puppets but the great video footage of things in the sky make this one a keeper.

Some of the footage they picked to go along with the ""planets"" sequence could be considered a stretch...  what do bubbles have to do with Pluto?  My kid thinks the part where the mouse eats the moon-made-of-cheese is hilarious.  The scene for one of the planets where the little ball rolls down the long back-and-forth ramp and out the hole at the bottom, while the boy giggles and points, seems to have been put in there as a joke for the parents--we suspect the Baby Einstein people are trying to say that food goes through your intestines and then out Uranus!",1113523200,2,820,4.582191780821918

1864733,5,B00008WFHF,"First a brief note on the Baby Einstein series, and then my specific opinions about Baby Galileo.  My wife and I are very careful about both the amount and the content of any television that my 17-month-old son views.  Our Baby Einstein videos (we have around 8) are among only six or seven shows or videos that play on our TV sets when our son is awake.  Other parents have already mentioned one benefit of the Baby Einstein videos: That they can give you 30 minutes of worry-free time to prepare meals or get dressed while your children remain glued to the set.  However, I'd like to mention my own favorite benefit of the series: Quality time with my son.  When I put on one of these videos, my son crawls up into my lap and remains there for the whole show.  (Any of you with 17-month-old boys probably know how rare it is for your son to spend 30 whole minutes sitting in the same place.)  During the program, he points to objects he recognizes (gesturing the signs for words he knows), laughs out loud during the puppet shows, and mimics the children he sees in the videos.  Throughout the video he looks to me for acknowledgement and confirmation, and I try to teach him the signs and words for things he hasn't learned yet.  These videos have proven to me that when used sparingly and wisely, television can be a powerful learning and family-building tool.

As for Baby Galileo, this one is clearly my son's favorite.  Baby MacDonald and Neighborhood Animals are probably tied for second place, where Language Nursery and Baby Bach appear to appeal to him the least.  The actual puppets of Baby Galileo and his mom are probably the best and most detailed puppets I have yet seen in the series.  They both have moving limbs and are very expressive- and they're definitely my son's favorite part of the video.  He also enjoys the little clips of other babies and the many images of the sun and moon.  I must admit, this is MY favorite of the bunch too, not just because of the music selection, but yeah, I also dig the puppets.  I have a single criticism of this particular video: The segment about the moon features a very odd rendition of Debussy's Claire De Lune.  It was so different from the Claire De Lune that I know and love that I actually thought it was just a sound-a-like, perhaps for licensing reasons.  Basically, the main melody of the piece is almost completely absent.  However, the liner notes for the disc do in fact list Debussy as the composer.  My wife believes it was an intentional adjustment, because the music in Baby Einstein videos is supposedly ""designed for little ears.""  I don't buy it, but overall I think this is a great video.",1101686400,51,2667,4.526096033402923

She, as always, loves the cute puppets and their antics. And she simply adores all of the segments: moon, sun, clouds, stars, galaxies, planets - she's actually learning the names of the planets!

But I started watching this with her at 3 months, pointing out the images, talking to her about space and the objects, and humming the music.  She has already become a lover of classical music and I think some credit is due to Baby Einstein for that.

We use Baby Galileo as part of our nightly bedtime ritual.  My daughter and I sit together and watch this each evening, while she has a snack, just before her bath.  It's so soothing and it really helps her wind down from the excitement of the day.  Then she has a bath, we read a few books, and she is set for the night.

As with all of the Baby Einstein videos they are fun for the babies and toddlers to watch but as a parent it is important to keep TV educational. It is hard to find educational toys that keep their interest and teach them something at the same time- this video does just that.

1864758,3,B00008WFHF,"Being an avid astronomer, I wanted to impart my love of the sky on my son. I thought this DVD would be a perfect beginning. The result: yes and no. The images are cute and do give children some sense of wonder, and the usually psychological comparative methodologies (top juxtaposed with a galaxy)are at work in the DVD as in the others.

However, there are a serious downsides to this DVD. First, most of the music that accompanies the images are recycled versions of the music from Baby Mozart, Baby Beethoven, and others. Second, the child narrarator embarassingly mispronounces the planet Uranus as ""your ANUS"" instead of the correct ""YOUR-ah-nus"". Lastly, some of the images are incorrectly grouped. For example, in the section on ""Galaxies"" a photo of a nebula is shown. A nebula is a cloud of gases within our own galaxy and NOT a galaxy itself (no more than a chair in a house is a house).

My recommendation: it's an okay DVD that will entertain your child for a while but, personally, I would first take your child outside at night to appreciate the grandeur of the real thing (my son even saw a real meteor streaking across the sky the other night and squealed with delight. You don't get that on DVD).",1073001600,,1213,4.611111111111111

So we put it away and watched her other faves. I could only take so much of the others before I decided to try this one again. My daughter sat through half of it. Next time she watched it completely. I haven't had a problem since. This one now captivates her. We've had problems getting her to sleep on her own. We always have to rock her to sleep which is much harder now that she's older. Now we give her a bath, tuck her favorite doll under her arm and we watch this video. It calms her completely and when it's over we put her to bed and she'll go to sleep on her own.

The music is beautiful and it truly reflects the mood of what it's being described. I gave this review 4 stars instead of 5 because the last two segments of the video about ""galaxies"" and ""space"" are not to attractive and a little bit dizzy. Also, I wish there were more parts with the puppets. But overall this video is great and I can't wait to explore other baby einstein videos.",1069977600,,647,4.2682926829268295
1864784,5,B00008WFHF,"I will admit up front that this is the only BE video we own.  However, our 1 year old loves it.  I read many of the 1 star reviews before and after getting the video.  I really wonder if some of them were watching the same video that I was...since there were lots of puppets, not animation and other statements that just don't match.
My little girl squeals with delight when baby Galileo comes on the screen.  She is mezmerized the entire length of the video.  It is not a ""get up and dance"" kind of attention but rather a pointing and clapping kind.
My husband, who is a high end amateur astronomer, really likes that he is able to start her interest in astronomy early.  They go over clouds, moon, sun and stars with some nice imagery.  But they also do all of the planets with actual images of the planets with all of the names and galaxies as well with actual images of different kinds of galaxies.  The segment on space is is a little strange, but it is a natural progression where they show space as a cluster of galaxies.",1068422400,4,1028,4.290155440414508

First of all, one of my child's favorite part is the little caterpillar that comes out at the beginning of the video-missing from the new Galileo!  They used different puppets rather than hand held and it just wasn't the same quality.  Whereas my baby sits virtually hypnotized by the other videos, he is not impressed with this one at all, he's bored after about 15 minutes.  I was planning on picking up Newton but I think I'm going to wait and see what other parents comment first.",1067731200,2,566,4.519607843137255

She watches them three times a day (during mealtimes) and they keep her interest even after the many, many times she has seen them (she is twelve months old and has been watching them since she was three months old). Baby Galileo is very slow paced and my daughter will sit through it, but she does not enjoy it like she does the others. You should try other Baby Einstein DVDs first, especially Baby Mozart. But if you really want to buy a DVD your baby will love, get some Bear in the Big Blue House DVDs. How educational!",1067558400,5,600,4.226086956521739

I've watched them watch this and other DVDs and I must say, there's definitely something about this one that mesmerizes them...maybe it's the music, or the colors, or the stars, I don't know, but it holds their attention fully.
I just saw my baby girl smiling up at the stuffed animal puppets and ""scooted"" towards the television to get a closer look.  My baby boy just stares at the whole thing seriously.

My son (12 months) actually started crying and was frightened in some of the fast-moving, flying saucering scenes. The flow was terrible and the puppets weren't even that entertaining. He absolutely loves the Baby Einstein series, but this latest attempt was a flop! It seemed entirely too contrived and forced and didn't feel the same as the previous ones.

The music is all classical music that has a moon, planet, or space theme (e.g. Clair de Lune by Debussy).

We have the whole series for our 15 month old son, who especially loves Baby Newton and Shakespeare. However, when we watched this video, I was really disappointed. It just wasn't as interesting and engaging as the other videos. My son usually will dance, clap, talk and point to the images on the TV and sing along with the children, but Baby Galileo didn't hold his attention at all. It didn't seem to have the imagination and creative oomph that the other videos in the series have. Something was definitely missing in this video and though I think Disney is ok, they seriously messed up the originality of Julie Aigner-Clark's vision.",1064016000,9,718,4.7063492063492065
1864828,5,B00008WFHF,"I don't quite understand what is so horrible about Baby Galileo.  Reviewers are saying how aweful it was, but are giving no explanation as to why, so I'm going to explain why it worked for me and my child.
I was extremely pleased with the Baby Galileo video.  My daughter is three and a half years old and soaks in anything she sees. Although she is on the older end of the suggested ages for these videos, she still is learning from them and enjoying them.  This video was a great way for her to learn the general ideas about the sky.  The video opens with puppets, which are a trademark in Julie Clark's videos. There are narrations by children, and 15 different pieces of classical music ranging from Claire De Lune to Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.  There are several chapters in the video introducing a new concept- those being the sky, the sun, the clouds, the stars, the moon, the planets, the galaxy and space. There are real pictures and video of the sun, moon and others while they are supplemented with toys, graphics and music that go along with the sky/space theme.
I am an early childhood educator, and I see these videos as being some of the most developmentally appropriate videos out there for children to watch.  The video expresses many subjects, textures, colors and most of all, beautiful classical music to soothe your child and spark their interest and attention.  I'm not quite sure why these videos haven't worked for other parents, but they've been successful in my family and many others that I know.  I highly recommend the Baby Einstein collection- at least try them, especially Baby Galileo.",1063497600,61,1619,4.696113074204947
1864829,3,B00008WFHF,"Unlike the other Baby Einstein videos in the series, this one lacks the ""pizzaz"" that the previous ones did.  The images weren't as captivating and my 1 1/2 year old actually made me turn it off the first time we watched it.  We've tried to watch it a few more times but she just does not like it as much as the others from the series.

1864831,2,B00008WFHF,"Although when you compare this video to the vast video selection out there, I would rate it higher, we've come to expect more from Einstein videos.  It is unfortunate that Disney decided to change formats and puppets.  Some of the footage of clouds and space are visually stimulating, but the video doesn't flow and lacks the personality that the other Einstein videos have in spades.  I hope for the next production, they will go back to the old format, but if they do not, we will stop buying them.",1062633600,,500,4.595505617977528
1864832,5,B00008WFHF,"Ever since Disney's takeover, the old original Baby Einstein style is now just the skeleton of this latest addition to the series. The puppetry is completely different, kind of like ""Johnny Quest"" meets claymation. It's sort of odd to watch at first, but you will eventually get the hang of it (hey, it's for our kids, right?) It's the kind of jerky motion that you'd see in the old claymation cartoons. Well, I think I remember someone complaining about the bad puppetry in the previous Baby Neptune, they have definitely addressed this issue, for now they are moving with less of a sock-puppet feel and more of a marionette. (I kind of miss those sock-puppets!)
It's disappointing to hear them use the same classical music as in the other DVDs, there are *some* new songs, but LOTS of recycled music. With all the beautiful classical music available, it's surprising that they didn't care to find different songs to fit the Galileo theme.
You will also notice the backdrop to be dark. I think they are trying to hone in on the ""night sky"" feel / Galileo theme compared to the stark white backgrounds from before. It's as if it's been planned by some slick sophisticated advertising executive, it really has a different feel to it.
With the puppet interludes in between various scenes, they use the same (if not completely identical) scene with Baby Galileo (who is a baby kangaroo) holding a balloon and letting it go. Over and over, at least 4 times! It was kind of neat in Baby Beethoven how they had varying scenes with the duck and the dog. If you have Baby Beethoven, you'll see what I mean.
Well, all my criticisms are just MY criticisms. I think the real indicator of whether or not this is a hit is my 14 month old daughter! As with any new DVD, she's a little apprehensive and sometimes scared at first, but with multiple playings, this particular Baby Einstein has been as captivating as the rest of them. This also keeps her engaged, and I guess that's the opinion that really counts! If your child has enjoyed previous Baby Einstein videos, add this one on, they will be sure to enjoy it as well.",1062460800,8,2110,4.599469496021221

There are beautiful and mezmerizing images of the sky, planets and stars and soothing music to watch it by.  I recommend this for evening viewing when your little go-bots need to slow down for bedtime.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is somehow different from the earlier movies in the Baby Einstein series, and not in a way that we liked.",1062460800,4,557,4.285714285714286

I was excited when Baby Galileo came out but we both were bored by it.  There are not enough puppets, they keep repeating the same toys (maybe because they couldn't find enough in the categories)and perhaps for his age, he's just not interested in
looking at real white speckled stars in the nite sky. Maybe when he's a bit older, we'll try it again.
Although, he did get to see images of the sun, stars, moon, clouds, planets and galaxies. The space segment was the best with robots and rocket ships. I noticed in the credits that there are so many people involved now yet Baby Galileo seemed very thin.",1060905600,,777,4.471830985915493

I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  You wouldn't think this video even came from the same collection!  It's unoriginal, over-produced, canned, and downright boring.  The entire DVD was produced on film instead of video (instead of short portions), so you lose the ""real"" look and effect found in the other videos.  And the puppets?  The puppets are HORRIBLE!  Disney has done away with the hand puppets, replacing them with these very mechanical-looking puppets controlled by sticks. Even the music used is almost identical to one of the scores used in a previous video.  There are also no cute, colorful toys buzzing across the screen in-between scenes.
This video totally lacks the charm, beauty, simplicity and imagination that you find in the other videos.  Disney has taken Julie Clark's originality and has butchered it.  But don't just take my word for it!  Let me tell you my 18-month old son's reaction...
With this DVD, he did something I have never seen him do with any of the Baby Einstein videos.  Within five minutes of it starting, he was already losing interest and started playing with some of his toys.  Within 10 minutes, he had moved away from the TV altogether and was playing under the dinner table.  When I tried to play it for him later, he lost again lost interest after a short time.  I have yet to see him sit through the entire video.
This is one DVD that I would definitely recommend leaving out of the collection.  On the other hand, my son was totally captivated by Baby Neptune, Baby Mozart and Baby Van Gogh.  He never seems to get bored with them, even after watching them 100 times.",1060905600,6,1777,4.575949367088608
