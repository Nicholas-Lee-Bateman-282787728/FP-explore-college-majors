1962614,5,B0000Z6N7E,"for once a movie that is not all violence, sex, etc. It is a good story. I being a dog lover enjoy the relationship between dog and master portrayed in this movie. I question whipping a dog. I learned the lesson myself to never spank my dog and if i must to make sure i do it promptly and the dog thoroughly understands why he is being disciplined. When my dog ran off i used to scold and spank him but a friend advised me to praise him for coming back. If i caught him then i should scold him severely but never raise my hand on him. When i learned that, he was a good dog and so has every dog i have had since then. Being an old Army sergeant my dog knows when he has done wrong. He also knows when i am proud of him. We as humans need to realize a dogs mind is simpler and different than ours. Animals discipline their young with violence. it is the only way they can communicate to them when they need to be corrected. That is what they are used to. I am not sure about feeding my dog before i eat. When i lead others i have learned to make sure everybody gets fed before i do. As a master of a dog he needs to know i am the alpha wolf I am the leader. In wolf packs the alpha wolf eats first. It is the way the natural world is.

I like the setting for this movie, in the snowy wilderness. Being out there with my dog is very special. I love snow and the outdoors and long to be back in the north where there is enough snow to have fun and the summers are not overbearing heat and humidity.",1466812800,2,1495,3.8856209150326797

1962743,2,B0000Z6N7E,We started watching this because we like northern Canada and had gotten hooked on Yannick Bisson in the Candian t.v. series Murdoch Mysteries.  But he is just a kid in this movie and we got bored 20 minutes into it.,1398038400,,215,4.375

1962747,5,B0000Z6N7E,"I much enjoyed the family friendly story, based on family values and the triumphs of a young man growing up. I liked the inclusion of the Indian spirituality and friendship with The Chief. The setting is breathtakingly rugged and beautiful.",1364083200,,240,5.025
1962748,4,B0000Z6N7E,"First of all, let me address the person concerned for the dogs.  The reviewer said that the father says to ""beat the dogs"" to the son.  That isn't quite accurate.  The father tells the son to ""whip the dog"" referring to giving one disobedient sled dog a correction.  Is that a big difference?  Two things. First, these are sled dogs being trained for racing, not dogs who are pets who just tipped over a vase.  Second, this was in reference to one dog.  The father, in fact, will not sell his dogs to the antagonist in the story because he uses a whip on his dog to motivate them to run faster. The father wants nothing to do with beating dogs to make them run faster. Rather, the scene in question is regarding one dog that will not work like the others.  The line may still be offensive to some, but it does carry a different tone in the entirety of the show.

The emphasis in the show is being good to the animals, always caring for them, feeding them before the master gets fed, loving the animals.  True, the line still may be too much if you think that the idea of a sled dog being trained to run is offensive.  And I  understand that. It bothered me a bit, even with the context.  But in context (the son (about 18 years) cries with the thought of correcting this dog in this wa)y... and that is part of the point of growing up for the son.  And that correcting laziness and disobedience, curbing our own desires for the good of others (and the like), are important steps to manhood.  You may still disagree, but there is some context for it.

This show is dated.  Most may stumble across this movie because of the popularity of the lead actor (Toby) who is also in the somewhat popular Murdoch Mysteries (6 season thus far). It looks like a made for TV movie of the 80's complete with Avacado (or is it Harvest Gold) appliances, panelled dens, Ski Doos, and 80's attire... and all shot with a video camera, not film.  Some of the acceptable movie subjects of the era show up in the lines.  There is a focus on individuals ""finding themselves"" and romantic connects.... all with the younger brother going ""ewwww!"" with every kiss and romantic interlude. One teen girl hopes the ""new teacher"" being flown in will ""crash"" so as not to have a teacher.  That is a worse line that the one about the dog, in my opinion.  It was meant to be funny, it isn't.  The other problem with kid friendliness is that the romantic connection between Toby and the ""city girlfriend"" is the focal point of the romance in the show (true the father connects with the school teacher, but the kids have more touching, fondling, and the like than the father and teacher.

It may also be off-putting that the teen (who is playing a good teen who makes a few bad choices) continues to make incredibly bad choices even later in the show when everyone around him warns him sternly that he is doing wrong. Yes, he suffers for this misdeed, including his father, but then saves an Native American as well as his father, and the bad decision gets lost in the story line. In general (and probably true of 80's made for TV fare) there is very little focus on making wise decisions...it is mostly self-discovery.  Even the father (who is going to lose the family farm) has no plans to keep things financially stable after he wins $6,000 for the race.  But perhaps I am being too picky now for the time of the movie.

I give it 4 stars instead of three because I took into account the era it was being made.  It is enjoyable and keeps you guessing about what will happen next.  It is a good movie about a boy growing up, learning to be responsible, and the hard work that it takes to get there. Yes, I wish the father would direct the son a bit better in the process...for instance, not let his 18 year old son have his girlfriend on his bed. But I may be asking too much of Hollywood in the 80's to be this considerate.  After all, even the Partridge family had scenes like this one. Still, if you love dogs and races and growing up to be responsible and family overcoming the odds, this is a great example of that set in the 80's in Canada.",1363910400,15,4112,4.331592689295039
