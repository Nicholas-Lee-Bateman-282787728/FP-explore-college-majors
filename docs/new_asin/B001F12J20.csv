3559827,5,B001F12J20,Wonderful.  Great mix of landscape and science I have every viewed.  A must for the whole family.  You will watch it over and over again.,1232323200,6,137,4.4
3559828,5,B001F12J20,"I purchased this multi-disc set because I love the quality and experience of viewing an IMAX film. I was skeptical that I would enjoy the Blu-ray versions as much as the theater versions, but I was in for a surprise! The quality of the film and audio were equal to the theater version, if not, somewhat better. There is nothing like watching theater quality entertainment in the comfort of your living room or bedroom. I watch a lot of Discovery Channel and Animal Planet and I have seen Planet Earth and Blue Planet, but I really preferred the audio and visual experience of these IMAX films.

The individual Blu-ray discs included in this box set are-
Africa, The Serengeti - 40 minutes
Australia, Land Beyond Time - 75 minutes
Antarctica, Adventure of a Different Nature - 40 minutes
Alaska, Spirit of the Wild - 40 minutes
Ocean Oasis - 40 minutes

The packaging includes 3 regular size Blu-ray disc cases. Africa, The Serengeti and Australia, Land Beyond Time as well as Alaska, Spirit of the Wild and Antarctica, An Adventure of a Different Nature are in a Blu-ray case that utilizes both sides for holding a disc. Ocean Oasis is in a Blu-ray case that holds one disc. It is the first time I have seen a Blu-ray case for multiple discs. It is really convenient because it uses less space on my forever-expanding storage shelves.

All in all, I would highly recommend this set to anyone who loves the IMAX experience and anyone that appreciates the beauty in nature.",1226966400,54,1471,4.65
8300451,5,B001F12J20,"This is perhaps the must stunning video photography I have ever seen.  When you play it with a blue-ray on a large screen, you feel like you could fall right through the screen.  Even if you have watched this on public television, this is 1080p, and the broadcast 1080i is close, but you have to see it to believe it.  I'm looking forward to more from this group.  This is to video what National Geographic is to photography.",1353628800,,425,4.410256410256411
8300452,5,B001F12J20,"This may not be Planet Earth (PE) (BBC) or Life (BBC), but is probably the next best thing to it.  If you've tasted PE and want an encore, then Mother Earth set is the way to go.  Not in the mood for 9hrs of PE, this is a quickie flavor, each program at 40min.  For Africa Serengeti, the classic IMAX, James Earl Jones' characteristic method is perfect for this.  Too bad BBC didn't steal him.  You may recognize his deep powerful monologue voice from Darth Vader of Star Wars.  Made decades before PE, it is obvious that PE emulated from these IMAX programs in terms of camera angles, convexing wide aerial shots, production, and style, etc.  Exclusively, one outstanding feature is that these blu ray audio tracks contain 8-9 different languages, all in 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Not that you'd need anything other than English, but I believe this is quite fantastic, and perhaps the only release I've seen to feature this many.  The BD picture is 1080p, average HD quality, but a big improvement from SD DVD.  Saving space, 5 discs are packaged in 3 standard BD cases covered by a light outer box.  Enjoy.  Add this to your nature collection.  You won't be disappointed if you desire more beyond BBC.

Other collections I own, and highly recommend include:

8300453,3,B001F12J20,"This is worth buying and watching.  Doesnt compare to Planet Earth but is still a must have for the nature buff.  The video quality is pretty good along with the sound.  Not long enough if you ask me, needs more material.",1289779200,,221,4.341463414634147
8300454,2,B001F12J20,"I was very disappointed at this pack.  I'm an avid nature video watcher and this pack is very disappointing.  The images are not great and the sound effects are downright annoying (narration is too soft and ""music"" is too loud).  I do not recommend this pack.",1269302400,4,259,4.586956521739131
8300455,2,B001F12J20,"I would look elsewhere for a good documentary.  The imagery is great but the narration is horrible, I think even small children would find the narration simplistic and sometimes awkward or goofy.  There are much better films available that capture better imagery and have a narrator that doesn't sound like she's talking to a 2nd grade class.",1262908800,8,342,4.982456140350878
8300456,5,B001F12J20,"Hi there !
 I think it was a fantastic way to start on Blu Ray World . This "" Mother Earth Pack "" ( 5 Discs ) are amazing and I hardly recommend to all Nature Friends . I am a diver and there's a disc about Baja California in Mexico ( Called "" Ocean Oasis "" ), where I was last year and it was so good to see in High Def that wonderful place again .
 ( * A little bit in portuguese : Esse pack  excelente para quem gosta de imagens sensacionais da Natureza e o BD Ocean Oasis includo  simplesmente fantstico para quem mergulha )
 Best regards from Brazil !

8300457,5,B001F12J20,"Mother Earth in Blu-Ray is the only way to go. Unless you live under a rock, you'll really enjoy this DVD set. The scenes are fantastic, along with the sound quality. Hours of complete enjoyment.",1242864000,3,195,4.6
8300458,2,B001F12J20,"The sound quality was extremely poor and I have a professional designed Media room with a 136"" screen and the IMAX scenes were not very good at all.  My family & I were extremely disappointed with the purchase and will not ever purchase IMAX Blu-Ray DVD's from amazon ever again.",1241654400,9,279,4.58
8300459,5,B001F12J20,I was surprised for the superb quality of pictures on all of the Mother Earth Blu Ray. I do recommend this 5-Pack if you like exuberant nature.,1239148800,4,143,4.333333333333333
8300460,3,B001F12J20,"First let me mention that the three stars are for persons who have seen BBC's Planet earth. I would give five stars to the picture quality of this current package. BUT, on the other hand, it has nothing new, the narration is detached from the nature experience. It is more about spot events and snap shots and less about a whole organic subject. The animal kill is spectacularly filmed in close-ups where in planet earth they try to avoid that.",1233446400,32,444,4.5625
