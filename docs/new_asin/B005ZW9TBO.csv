8545231,1,B005ZW9TBO,"Since this Randolph Scott title has yet to be released in the states, I took a chance on ordering the only version I found on the web.  It was a mistake.  Knowing the version available was from France I had hoped there was a secondary audio track in English - there wasn't.  And the print used was so dark and unwatchable, I should have just set fire to the money paid for this piece of junk.  This is, by far, the worst transfer of a movie I have ever seen.  If I could give this no stars, I would. STAY AWAY!",1439078400,,510,4.00990099009901
