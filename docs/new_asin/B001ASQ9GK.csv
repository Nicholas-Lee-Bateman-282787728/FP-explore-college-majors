8279487,5,B001ASQ9GK,one of the best anime ever,1422576000,,26,3.5
8279488,4,B001ASQ9GK,"Like many, I remember watching Sailor Moon growing up and dreaming about moon princesses and exciting adventures. My niece and I start watching SM together but it was just too outdated for her - made in early 90's I believe. I started looking for an anime series that would be similar to SM but also be appropriated for her to watch. I came across this little jewel and am beyond please with the series.

It is wonderfully imaginative and exciting to watch. Himeno, the heroine, was lovable without being over annoying or whinny (SM overall was a weaker personality). I'm a sucker for a fully developed bad guy and Pretear did well at giving you insight to the bad guy's (Princess of Disaster)actions and fall for grace. Himeno goes from being a school girl dealing with settling in with her new step family to being chosen as the new Pretear, defender of our world. She is aided in her duties by a band of knights that combined their individual power with her to create different Pretear's abilities. I absolutely love the knights and, as an adult, appreciated that, given the length of the series (13 episodes), there was a good amount of time spent flushing out the knight's characters.

The real evil in the series is fear and doubt. Himeno must struggle with her fear and doubt knowing the last Pretear that was 'called' gave into her fear and anger and became the Princess of Disaster - the very evil Himeno is tasked with destroying.

What really  made the series are the side character's development. I felt such empathy for Sasame, a knight that was in love with the Princess of Disaster, yet had to imprison her with his fellow knights. Now she is free, he is torn between his loyalty to his people and his love for the girl the princess once was.  And then there is Mawata, one of Himeno's stepsister, who is still grieving for her father and feels isolated and alone. Everybody is too caught up in their own lives to notice her despair.

There are many ups and downs in this series and my niece and I felt everyone of them. I truly recommend this series to anyone looking for a fairy tale that will make you laugh, make you cry, and leave you completely satisfied at the end.",1363996800,,2187,4.538071065989848
8279489,5,B001ASQ9GK,"If you love romance and magical elements, you'll adore Pretear c:

Dialogue: Dialogue was pretty good, aside from the fact that I sometimes found Himeno's little sermons a bit annoying (""Isolation is what we all feared!"", via aggravating voice), and frankly sometimes her speeches were a bit cheesy, but overall I found this 12-episode anime to be really good! Some people seemed to have not liked it, but I consider it one of my favorites.

Scenery: (10/10) The fairytale and magical elements were amazing, as well as the animation. ""Costume design"" and backgrounds were top notch.

Plot: The structure of the plot consists of a ""Pretear"" fusing her ""soul"" with that of a Leafa Knight's, which embarrasses Himeno at first for obvious reasons (""becoming one"" with the male Knight) =P Once ""Preted"" the power of the Pretear is born and Himeno is able to fight with incredible powers, her elemental abilities differing with each Knight (Fire with Go, Wind with Hiyata, ect). Himeno must defeat the Princess of Disaster, along with the Demon Larva--but who is the Princess, and how is she connected to the Leafa Knights? O.o that's the fun part xD

Characters: The characters were amazing c: (A lot of hotties lololololol) Himeno, the protagonist, annoyed me sometimes, but her backup ""actors"" were all lovable and unforgettable. Himeno, our starlit heroine, is a determined and fun lead in my opinion, though she is by no means my favorite. This anime is amazing (aside from the fact that the sound fluxgates far too much).

Don't look this one over, especially if you're a fan of Wedding Peach or Sailor Moon--because Pretear is a more serious, realist version of those two =3 (Wayyyy better)",1360368000,,1691,4.940140845070423
8279490,3,B001ASQ9GK,"Pretear is an anime about a girl that has the power to save the world. Himeno is a regular chick whose Dad lucks out and marries a beautiful and wealthy woman with 2 daughters that are about the same age as Himeno. Her step sisters are always causing her problems b/c they think she's an inferior peasant. She learns that she has the power to save the world from the Princess of Disaster, who is bent on making the world suffer for the heartbreak she experienced. Himeno fights her battle along side the Knights of Leafe, who teach her to discover her true ability. There's a good mix of comedy and drama in this series. The first half isn't nearly as good as the ending. I was getting a little bored with it until the final conflict began. I was pretty surprised at the good drama toward the ending. It made up for the lack of interesting stuff in the first half. Some of the Knights were kind of lame and embarrassing, and the guy Himeno has a thing for is a tool and treats her like dirt. Despite the lack of interesting characters this series is pretty good, but not great. If you want to watch a fantastic anime with a similar story line watch NOEIN, or This Ugly Yet Beautiful World. They are both very good and have a much more interesting set of characters and plot.",1349568000,3,1274,4.334728033472803
8279491,5,B001ASQ9GK,It is all of the episodes in great quality. There are 13 episodes in total. It doesn't have an OVA that I have found. The collection is well worth the price. I highly recommend it. I'm not going to give a review on the anime itself I'm just going to tell you that it is one of the best anime out there with no cliff hanger at the end :) ! You will not be disappointed in the purchase!,1348790400,,384,3.8734177215189876
8279492,5,B001ASQ9GK,"Started out a little slow but had me hooked by episode 4. The characters are great and the english dub voice is spot on. Unlike most 12 episode animes this one actually resolves everything. No plot threads are left hanging. And yes like any good fairy tale, it has a happy ending. Highly recommended.",1331251200,2,300,4.574074074074074
8279493,5,B001ASQ9GK,The entire 13-episode OVA is included at this unbelievable bargain price.  This show is what Sailor Moon would have been if Serena was smarter and had more attitude.  That's what the director of this TV series said.  And he was the director of Sailor Moon,1314230400,3,255,4.622222222222222
8279494,2,B001ASQ9GK,"My daughter was very excited to see a volume 2 of this series and I purchased it for her for Christmas. When we got it, we discovered the packaging had been changed but the episodes were the same as in Volume 1.

The series itself is good, but not so good that I wanted 2 copies of everything.",1233619200,7,293,4.051724137931035
