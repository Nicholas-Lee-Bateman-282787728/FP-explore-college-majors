8636988,5,B00HWVMT1I,"Glorious collection!  54 DVDs, all three series complete and unedited, and the prints are beautiful!  I've been watching them on a 60 inch TV, and they are sharp and gorgeous!  Now, you have to have a region-free DVD player because this set is Region 2 (UK), but they are easy to get and inexpensive.  As a matter of fact, you can get them right here on Amazon!  VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, THE TIME TUNNEL and LAND OF THE GIANTS, all in one box!  The DVD cases are plastic, and the hubs keep the discs firmly in place.  Each series has loads of special features, and the discs are all clearly and colorfully labelled (none of that silver on grey that seems to be the norm these days).  I can't recommend this collection any higher!  You may think it's a bit pricey, but TIME TUNNEL and GIANTS are now way out of print in the USA, commanding very high collector's prices.  VOYAGE looks to be going the same way, so, unless a BLU release is in the future, this is the only way you can get these great series.  Take the plunge!  I did, and I couldn't be happier!  Lee, take 'er down to ninety feet!",1519603200,,1101,4.235576923076923
