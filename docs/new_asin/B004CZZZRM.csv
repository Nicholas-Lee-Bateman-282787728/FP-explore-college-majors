8424279,4,B004CZZZRM,"An old classic that was very different at the time to watch, the way the movies are made to-day are make better. The cast and storylines are great with plenty going for it. A rapist on parole with a lot of problems mounting up that he goes on the rampage rapes five air hostess and murders his wife plus losing his job what more could go wrong. The cops and parole officers are at each others throats one trying to help him and the other to convict him. I rated this an B grade plus as being entertaining being different that makes you sit up and take notice this can really happen in our world of to-day. So when nothing better grab this and relax to a violent movie that makes you shutter when alone by yourself. Don't forget the popcorn so you can put your feet up to an oldie for a change. Enjoy!",1396828800,,800,4.167741935483871
8424280,3,B004CZZZRM,"it is an old friend if you want to call it that. it was not any thing worthy of high praise, but it came out at a time of my first house and brought back many memories. the movie itself had had some good parts, but there was the acting so prevalent in that time frame namely the eighties. i enjoyed it , but would not recommend it to people more attuned to the movie viewing thrill. but it was easy viewing, and hard to find. as i said it was special to me at that time.",1379635200,,470,3.8556701030927836
8424281,1,B004CZZZRM,I can not watch it on my PC. I have to have a Kindle device to watch it. This was not advertised when I bought it. Shame on Amazon. I will not buy another movie from Amazon!!,1372204800,,174,3.72972972972973
8424282,2,B004CZZZRM,"I really only watched this because a good friend, Jennifer Salt is in it. Otherwise I wouldn't have given much of an interest in it at all. It's fun to see these old TV movies of yesteryear though. Sad we have to call the 70's and early 80's TV 'yesteryear', I remember when only stuff made in the 50's and early 60's qualified for that. Man I feel old. This one is typical of the usual cheesy story. Reporter and a hard nose cop team up to solve a series of rapes on airline stewardesses. At least I think he was raping them. LOL, just saw it recently and can't remember. The movie is wooden as a 600 year old corpse swaddled and mummified, even my pal Jennifer is following suite with a typical wooden character and making the best she can with it. So bad it's good kind of movie, but nothing much else to say about it.",1366761600,,821,4.169811320754717
8424283,5,B004CZZZRM,Awesome movie!!! If you like hot stewardesses and a great crime story you will love this movie. I saw it way back when I was a kid when it first aired on tv and I liked it then too. I'm so glad that it was released on dvd!!,1305158400,3,223,3.6666666666666665
