I saw other reviews that expressed this at thought maybe they updated the item to match the description. This was something both my kids and I looked forward to. Due to the bonus features and price, I still think it's a good deal.

Uncle Si I think might be playing up his dumb part and has everyone fooled. ;)",1405382400,,226,3.9347826086956523

5903463,5,B00ECJGB44,"If you like to laugh you will like the ""Duck Boys."" Some of their antics are so crazy you just have to laugh, Si is so funny at times he's unbelievable, but he turns around and surprises you. They are a bunch of nuts that make you smile one minute and make you slap you knee the next and say ""no way!"" It's almost hard to believe these are mostly college educated folks, but you will see it pop out here and there. Their books are really good too to find out how they grew up and some of the family background.",1403136000,,510,4.009803921568627

5903466,5,B00ECJGB44,Purchased this Trilogy as a gift for family members; they love having their own Duck Dynasty to watch when it is convenient for them. Duck Dynasty is a welcome and refreshing program. This Family reflects the values on which our great nation was founded and give glory to God. I love the fact that they pray in the Name of Jesus.,1401840000,,329,4.409836065573771
5903467,5,B00ECJGB44,"Hilarious tv series Uncle Si is the coolest.  Although you could tell once the show went on you could tell that the stars were changing how they acted, the only two that didn't really change were Uncle SI and Phil, everyone else seemed to change and it became more like an act.",1401667200,,277,4.326923076923077
5903468,5,B00ECJGB44,"We'd never heard of Duck Dynasty until all the controversy about Phil Robertson's opinions.  Then a relative of ours said he thought he'd sit down and watch an episode to see what all the fuss was about.  And then he watched another, and another, and another.  We gave it a try and had exactly the same experience.  It's all pretty silly, but they are charming and clever people, with an ethos which is not only fascinating but, in the present time, courageous.  I probably won't buy any more DVD's (since there are all night marathons of the recent shows on all the time) but it was fun to go back to the beginning and see how they started.  Gotta love 'em.",1401408000,,658,4.396694214876033

5903472,4,B00ECJGB44,I bought this for my boyfriend and was excited because the description said a camo Duck Dynasty bandana was enclosed.  I received it but no bandana...  Great show though!,1399939200,,170,4.827586206896552
5903473,5,B00ECJGB44,"I just love this show anyway! I just had to own the seasons, and the collectors bandana is awesome! I'm a redneck that spent too long in the city! This show just takes me back to a simpler way of living!",1399680000,,203,3.975609756097561

5903479,5,B00ECJGB44,Awesome T.V. show. Love that it brings back the old American views because we sure are missing that in today's world. We have rewatched these Dvd's a few times since we bought them and they never get old.,1394409600,,204,4.394736842105263

5903540,5,B00ECJGB44,"A lot has been written about the series DUCK DYNASTY lately. Most of that has revolved around the head of the family, Phil Robertson, and remarks he made in during an interview for GQ magazine. But what about where it all began? What about the series that put him in a position where a magazine like GQ would even consider talking to him? If you've never been exposed to the Robertson family and why they've become so popular now is the chance. All of the first four seasons are now on DVD.

While the first three seasons have been available for a while now, a boxed edition has come out that includes a camouflage bandana. If you watch these discs you'll see what the hubbub us all about. The Robertson family and the series itself can be summed up in one word: family. That's something you rarely hear about these days unless it's about the downfall of the family or an extended family or a family that has some sort of extenuating circumstances. Here you have a traditional family that lives together, works together and plays together. That's something rare on TV today.

It's not one particular episode that stands out among the first three seasons that made this show a hit. It's all of them. It's the chance to meet this family and know that somewhere in the mix you recognize them as your own. There're the brothers, Willie and Jase, who have a friendly rivalry going on to the point where they play pranks on one another. Or baby brother Jep that the two gang up on to tease. Then there's crazy uncle Silas, or Si, who spouts off enough witticisms to garner a book release of his own (SI-COLOGY). Their wives and children are also in the mix from episode to episode. And at the head of the family is the man who started the company himself, Phil Robertson, and his wife Miss Kay.

The story behind the family has Phil starting his own company making duck calls called Duck Commander. Son Willie and his wife bought the company and made it the leader in the field, no pun intended, making it a million dollar business. Through the series and the product placements to follow the entire family has become rich but they don't let it go to their heads. They continue to live like they always did, although in better homes it seems.

Episodes range from the family sneaking onto a golf course in the black of night to snag some huge frogs that Jase saw there that afternoon with the intent of Miss Kay cooking a mess of frog legs to Willie trying to teach his daughter Sadie how to drive. Okay so the first one might not be something we all would do but the second surely is. Each episode is filled with some of the funniest situations and dialogue found on TV today. It's those off hand comments and moments that fill all of our lives where we laugh at one another and tell each other how ""you should write for television"". This group has taken those moments, put them together and actually done so.

At the end of each show has come the moment that has caused controversy around the country and in the board rooms of A & E, the network that airs the series. The family always ends up sitting down to dinner around the table and doing what seems to offend so many: they pray! You would think this would amount to nothing more than what people always used to do but in fact at one time was a point of contention with the network. They wanted them to stop using the name Jesus for fear of offending someone. The family didn't back down on that one and why should they? Apparently the network wasn't afraid that they might offend those who found something good in it.

This week you can also lay claim to the fourth season of the series and it contains just as many fun moments as the first three. Here again, it's not one episode that stands out, it's the entire season. As you watch this group you find yourself thinking they'd be fun to be around, to hang out with or to have a meal with, prayer included. They're not the simple folk that some would like to portray them as (all of the sons have college degrees and one friend/co-worker Martin is almost finished with his masters degree) and that may be why some folks don't like them. They're not the Beverly Hillbillies. Then again maybe they are. That was a family that didn't care what others thought of them either. They just loved one another and enjoyed themselves. It would seem to me we could use more of that rather than less on TV these days.

So if you find families that bicker non-stop, that hate one another more than love each other, that try to include each diverse culture they can find or that come off more like the Bundy's than the Cleavers this may not be the series for you. But if you like this family, like the values they believe in, like the fact that they're not afraid to stand up for what they believe in, then you should pick up both DUCK DYNASTY SEASONS 1-3 COLLECTOR'S SET and DUCK DYNASTY SEASON 4. They'll be DVDs that won't collect dust as you go back and watch and laugh at each and every episode.",1388448000,,4989,4.392857142857143
