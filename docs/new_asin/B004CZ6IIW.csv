4330795,4,B004CZ6IIW,"Bought to view seasons 3/4, that were never released in the US.  The region code was a pain, but if you can get access to an unlocked player, the series is equally good throughout.",1432166400,,180,4.294117647058823

4330804,5,B004CZ6IIW,Am amazing show for men and woman!! I loved it and my fianc&eacute; loved it! It didn't discourage a little more excitement in the bedroom!! Just make sure you don't buy the region two if you don't live in region two!!' I made that mistake. It isn't the end of the world but it's a little bit of an issue!!,1401235200,,306,4.116666666666666
4330805,5,B004CZ6IIW,It is region 2 so you will need a player that can do the job and you can buy one here on amazon for around $30.  I bought one by Phillips and it plays all of region 2 and more perfectly.  I have every DVD that David Tennant ever played in with no problems using this machine.  Oh and this show is (Diary of a Call Girl) is pretty good too!!,1396310400,,340,3.76056338028169
4330806,4,B004CZ6IIW,"My wife wanted the DVD set, as she always watched the series on Showtime.  She was very disappointed when Showtime did not renew the series---so she rates the set 4 stars because it includes all the episodes of the series in one package.",1395532800,,237,4.511627906976744

4330809,5,B004CZ6IIW,"I noticed that several people in the US have commented that they were unable to play this because it is Region 2.  I am a fan of Brit flicks and I used to be frustrated that a number of DVDs I wanted were only available in Region 2.  Then a couple of years ago it occurred to me to check on what a Region 2 DVD player would cost.  I discovered that all region DVD players were available here on Amazon starting under $30.  I immediately ordered the least expensive one and have been very happy with it.  Since it plays any region, I just use it for all my DVDs.  If you are a connoisseur of high quality electronics, you would probably prefer to shell out more for a better one.  I am not, so this one suits my needs just fine.  Since that time I have been able to order a number of my British favorites, both here and from Amazon UK.  All in all, I am a very happy anglophile.",1391904000,20,877,4.023121387283237
4330810,3,B004CZ6IIW,I probably should have known this but the show was manufactured in the UK so it does not work in the US. I was really looking forward to watching this. It arrived in a timely manner and good condition but I have to return it because I have no way to watch it.,1381017600,3,259,3.9056603773584904

4330812,1,B004CZ6IIW,"I live in North America. This DVD can't be viewed in North America.
Region 2 PAL discs are intended for use Japan, Europe, South Africa,  and the Middle East, including Egypt. Why did they sell it to me in North America?
Now I have to send it back at my shipping cost.

8424092,5,B004CZ6IIW,Humourous and lighthearted look at a very deep subject. Billie piper was good as were the other main characters. I would recommend this to others as light entertainment.

8424095,1,B004CZ6IIW,Do not buy this if you're in the United States. These DVDs will not work on American DVD players. The seller simply doesnt mention this in the product descriptions.
