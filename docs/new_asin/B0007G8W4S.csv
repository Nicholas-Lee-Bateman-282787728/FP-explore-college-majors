8047117,4,B0007G8W4S,"I was in doubt initially to spend that much money or not, but it is worth the investment, i must have seen the DVD at least 5-6 times so far..",1380153600,,142,3.7666666666666666
8047118,5,B0007G8W4S,"This is exactly what I was looking for in a beginner instructional dvd. As a beginner, I look for rules, proper form, drills to learn and develop skills, proper placement within the court and technique. Winterton covers it all in this dvd; concisely, methodically and clearly. Of course, there is no substitute for real-time instruction but if you're not looking to compete in the olympics, don't have access to a good instructor or players, and just want to learn proper game skills and techinique - this dvd is a great way to do it. Additionally, Winterton teaches you body alignment so as to get a powerful swing and protect yourself from injury. Really glad I got it!",1335744000,,671,4.743589743589744
8047119,5,B0007G8W4S,"a well kept secret that helps me to win more often. One part of me wanted to give this product a bad review just by the chance that one of the guys I play might read my review and then wouldn't buy it, but that would be stupid.",1323129600,,227,3.75

8047121,3,B0007G8W4S,"This needs more microphones and more camera angles.  If the angles were better and showed shots from different angles and the back wall you could see where you are supposed to place your shots.  Other than that, it's not a bad Dvd.  Good drills and skills to practice.",1213920000,,268,4.541666666666667
8047122,4,B0007G8W4S,"I have been playing racquetball for the last couple of years, intermittently. Maybe 1-2 times a month. So I still consider myself a beginner. I found this DVD very useful. It starts off with the very fundamentals, such as stance and grip, and moves on to some advanced strokes and serves. The coach has an easy relaxed style, the quality of filmmaking is decent. I just wish they showed the shots from different views and angles.",1194134400,2,429,4.657894736842105
8047123,5,B0007G8W4S,"I've been playing Raquetball solo for a few weeks now.  I'm coming at it with virtually no knowledge except seeing some other people play as I pass by the courts.  I bought a book and this video.  While the book is very well written and illustrated, it wasn't much help beyond selecting equipement.  This video, on the other had, is an excellent introduction for the beginner.  I can recommend it highly.  It would be easier to list my few small complaints: it would have been helpful to see some of the drills from more than one angle or closer in some cases.  The video moves very quickly from one drill to another.  You'll have to watch it a few times to digest it.  Winterton seems to be addressing an off-camera audience of instructors rather than the video audience, so sometimes the commentary drifts from instruction on the game to instruction on teaching the game.  The model being trained should have had a microphone on him to provide more natural interaction.  Finally, the menu isn't as user-friendly as it might be.  I would also like to have seen the lessons outlined on the cover art or an insert card.  Those are minor compalints, to be sure.  I will probably invest in the advanced DVD in a few weeks.",1164672000,8,1219,4.557603686635945
8047124,4,B0007G8W4S,"I purchased this after watching Winterton's advanced DVD. In it, he recommends watching this beginner's DVD as well, no matter what skill level. I'm not going to say this is a bad idea, but much of the information in here is contained in the advanced DVD. If you're a non-beginner, there is not much material here that you don't know already.

As with Winterton's other DVD, the video quality is excellent and it's easy to see why Winterton was so successful as the coach for the U.S. team. Skills are explained in detail and easy to understand. Winterton does a great job of not only showing technique, but also the potential for what may happen to one's game should they work on a few technical skills.

If you're new to racquetball, this is a great way to be introduced to the sport.",1153785600,12,786,4.528169014084507
