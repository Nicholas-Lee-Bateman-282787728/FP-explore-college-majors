5510413,5,B00AUJJ8IG,"Not all independent films are created equal.  Nor are all independent films worth watching.  The film, ""23 Minutes to Sunrise"", is worth watching because along a story that keeps you guessing, it has a heart that keeps you asking questions.  Great character acting by Eric Roberts and outstanding work by lesser known Dingani Beza and Jilanne Klaus.  A fun ride on this film.",1363651200,5,375,4.904761904761905

5510436,3,B00AUJJ8IG,"an interesting; if not obvious take on ""Booth at The End"" (a far superior script) with a dash of Rod Serling.

it works up to a point and although its' predictability is not to be faulted, there are a few all too convenient loose ends that destroy any possibility of a well thought out conclusion; which (by the way) is reminiscent of the the Naomi Watts solution in the 2002 ""The Ring"".

5510438,3,B00AUJJ8IG,"I am usually not compelled to write a review about an Amazon Prime movie, but this one had such a mix of absolutely horrendous acting and people working their craft to a fine level.

Please note, I am in the process of watching this movie while writing this review. I had to. The two good performances compell me to continue.

The narrator, and short order cook, is phenomenal. I hope he goes on to many great things. He provides a stunning and honest performance. Tha woman who plays the waitress is just as good. I am finding myself spacing out when others are on screen and only tuning in when these two weave their craft.

Eric Roberts is awful. The girl he is dating is awful. The older couple dealing with their marriage is comprised of two awful actors.

The only other decent set of actors is the criminal and his girlfriend. They are not as experienced as the narrator and the waitress, but they have real talent.

I wish I knew the names of the four good actors, so that it would help their Google rating, but I don't .

Suffice it to say, the three stars are for the actors that play the sort order cook and the waitress. They deserve five stars, but the rest of the actors bring them down. If you watch every cheesy horror movie on Amazon, watch this one,but take it with a grain of salt.",1455494400,,1300,4.329218106995885

I felt an emptiness in them and a deep desire to fill it, somehow. Scary, as I am getting the same feeling from family, friends and neighbors. And yet,Eddy kisses the waitress and a possibility opens up. The husband with the texting wife finally got her attention.

5510458,4,B00AUJJ8IG,"I will borrow a phrase from the Maker's Mark people and say this movie IS, what it ISN'T.  It's not a blockbuster, not star laden, not wall to wall action and not full of special effects.  That is precisely what I liked about it.  I stumbled upon the movie trailer when I went to Bob Zany's website to download one of his podcasts, and it intrigued the heck out of me.  I watched it several times and finally decided to purchase the movie just to see what the clues I was given were all about.  This is not the type of movie that I normally watch, and if I had just saw the box and not the trailer, I would have never been interested in it, but I went into it with an open mind and was pleased with what I saw.  The movie IS very slow paced, but I found myself drawn into the stories of Eddie and Sheila, and the mystery surrounding Daniel and Hannah caught my attention.  I thought Dingani Beza and Jilanne Klaus both knocked it out of the park as Eddie and Sheila, and I thought Eric Roberts was great in a role of a guy you instantly dislike, and Haley Busch did a credible job as Hannah.  Kristen Doute was very good, even though her character was not developed very much, and I thought that was a missed opportunity.  Tom Sandoval's character Donald was so dislikable, way more than even Daniel, that it was hard for me to find ANY sympathy for him.  I thought Nia Peeples was somewhat wasted, without much to do, and Bob Zany's performance was a little off, but it didn't detract from the plot for me.  The ending was a little odd to me, because while we get a pretty good indication of the fates of Hannah, Ted and Rachel, we are left to fill in the blanks for Eddie and Sheila, and we get no clue at all about Donald and Grace.  I would have added about five more minutes to the movie and wrapped up the plot a little better, but I LIKE the movie.  I could give you ten good reasons to NOT like it, but I still like it.  I have watched it three times in the last week, and my opinion hasn't changed.  Is it academy award material?  Not even close, but I thought they were on the right track, and did do a LOT of things right.  I am so intrigued by the movie, that I found out where the real diner is, and the next time I travel through that area, Im going to stop and eat.  As a side note, the convenience store where Donald buys the scratch off tickets is across the street.  It MAY have also been used as the one he robbed and shot the clerk, but I haven't been able to confirm that.  Spend a couple of bucks and try the movie.  You may find you like it despite its flaws.",1396396800,,2582,4.083333333333333
5510459,2,B00AUJJ8IG,this movie could have been good but the acting was weak and character development just was not their you never get to care for any of the characters also you can see the end coming a little obvious,1391990400,,197,4.2105263157894735
5510460,5,B00AUJJ8IG,"Great indie. It is not a big budget Hollywood production, thank goodness. Eric Roberts made the movie work.

5510461,5,B00AUJJ8IG,"This movie is not a ""horror"" movie as the cover might indicate (although it is dark). The characters are interesting and well-developed. It has an interesting premise and offered polar opposite views on the value of life. Great movie!",1375228800,,234,5.0256410256410255
5510462,1,B00AUJJ8IG,This movie was a waste of time. No action really involve until the end. The genre was horror and action but there was no horror or real action this was complete si-fi. The blood went back into the man at the end what a waste,1372377600,,224,4.0

5510466,5,B00AUJJ8IG,Not a horror movie at all.  It's more of a thriller. Characters are well developed and it looks really cool.,1368057600,,108,4.4
5510467,3,B00AUJJ8IG,"One would think that a movie set mainly in a diner would be slow and dull. But that is not the case in this competent story of several people who work at or eat in the diner, with one of them being capable of granting a supernatural gift to anyone who will accept it.

Interesting plot twist.",1367625600,,292,4.12280701754386
5510468,3,B00AUJJ8IG,"23 MINUTES TO SUNRISE plays like an episode of ""Twilight Zone""--I half expected Rod Serling to suddenly emerge, cigarette in hand, and say ""These poor souls think they're in a diner but they're really new travelers in the Twilight Zone!""  Unfortunately, 23 Minutes doesn't have the sharp writing as TZ.  It's pretty clear from the get-go who Eric Roberts' character is and how the movie will resolve. The diner patrons are stock characters---the disillusioned veteran; the sympathetic abused girlfriend; the older couple facing a midlife crisis; Roberts' mysterious companion; and the thieving couple.
The script is snail-paced, so its up to the cast to keep the audience involved but they just don't have the chutzpah to reach out and grab you by the throat pleading you to ""Care about me, dammit!""  Logic is ignored throughout the fikm---the patrons don't eat; the cook never cooks; who is the arsonist that appears early on and then disappears and what purpose does he serve?
The film's finale feels rushed and unfinished.
Not a horrible movie but missing it won't make you feel deprived.",1366761600,6,1091,5.05
5510469,4,B00AUJJ8IG,"I enjoyed this movie.

There were several interesting subplots. Many of the characters kept your interest up. The story was good. The filming was good.

5510470,2,B00AUJJ8IG,"This low budget yarn would suit movie goers just fine back in the 1940s, 50s, or even the 60s.  The age of film noir!  Eric Roberts gives some credibility to the over drawn out script.  The rest of the cast and production team seem to have ties to the local St. Louis, MO area.  Their acting is plausable but I really didn't care about the characters that they portrayed.  Most of the film is shot claustrophobically in a diner setting.  I kept checking the time for the big payoff.  The plot becomes evident through Roberts less than midway through, but you hope for an unexpected twist that never comes.  The whole premise has been done more profound in 30min. ""Twilight Zone"" episodes.  This yawner surely won't please viewers accustomed to FX laden blockbusters.  A reworking for live theatre would be most welcome.",1364688000,4,819,4.704225352112676
5510471,1,B00AUJJ8IG,Most worthless waste of time of any movie since the stupid remake of True Grit. 23 minutes has zero redeeming factors and every character is totally annoying. The story is just a poor Nan's ripoff of a Twilight Zone episode. The movie would've been better if they just blew up the restaurant in the first five minutes do no one waster their time watching more than they had to.,1364515200,3,377,4.478260869565218
5510472,4,B00AUJJ8IG,"This film is a character driven mystery. There are four couples in a late night restaurant, all have life issues. Ted (Bob Zany) is a mousey husband who complains he doesn't have a life. His wife Rachel (Nia Peeples) would rather text someone than have a conversation with him. Donald (Tom Sandoval) is a punk criminal killer/robber with serious anger management issues. He can't handle life. Grace (Kristen Doute) is his co-dependent girlfriend. Shelia (Jilanne Klaus) is a 30 year old waitress with an abusive boyfriend. She likes Eddie (Dingani Beza) the cook at the Sunrise Diner who is a war veteran searching for a life. The mystery couple is the ever unlikeable Eric Roberts as Daniel and the young Hannah (Haley Busch). Their conversation is shrouded in mystery and is the pivotal point of the movie.

Eddie supplies some first person narration in order to develop some simple philosophy and theme to this production. He is ""searching for God"" and now believes life is ""just one big lottery.""

The interactions of these four couples within the confines of a diner is the bulk of the film. If you need action, heavy plot, or an explanation of events, then I suggest you look elsewhere. This is an indie style film that allows the viewer to make their own conclusions. The film is clever at times and slow at others. It was good enough to draw me in.

5510473,4,B00AUJJ8IG,"""23 Minutes to Sunrise"" starts off strong, the opening credits introducing the players of the film one at a time with some great cinematography by DP Chris Benson.

We jump into things with Eddie (Dingani Beza), a veteran of the war in Iraq who naturally has seen some terrible things - and one horrible ""person"" in particular.  He's gone back to school after his tour, not looking for a job (the man already has one, he points out quite clearly) but looking for life - and boy does he find it at work, the Sunrise Diner, with its share of weirdoes and a pretty, sweet waitress named Sheila (Jilanne Klaus) to even it all out.

Daniel (Eric Roberts, ""The Dark Night,"" ""The Expendables"") and Hannah (Haley Busch), who we'll call a couple ""old souls,"" grab a booth in the diner.  Ted (comedian Bob Zany, ""The Informant"") and his wife Rachel (Nia Peeples, ""Half Past Dead,"" ""Pretty Little Liars"") are already there going on about their marital problems, while star-crossed but all-hope-lost armed robbers Donald (Tom Sandoval) and Grace (Kristen Doute) enter a bit after.

We learn that Hannah literally has a life-long dilemma, and Daniel makes her a proposition, an offer for her to, let's say, trade her problem with someone else.  It's 4:37AM and she has 23 minutes to find that person.  Interestingly, she's in the perfect place (but doesn't realize it at first), where the broken hearts sharing their midnight miseries have gathered.

Donald and Grace eventually hold the diner up, Daniel watches everything unfold in disciplined pleasure (we know he's done this kind of thing for a long time now), Eddie gets in the middle, and Sheila gets a gun held to her head.  All hell breaks loose in these few minutes before sunrise.

The script, written by Jay Kanzler (who also directed) and Patrick Pinkston, is solid, its biggest problems being some bad dialogue here and there and the execution between the characters of Eddie and Sheila.  The two had chemistry as friends, but in trying to go beyond that at one point, they lost some believability.

The majority of the movie takes place in the diner, and Kanzler and his team deserve a great deal of credit for writing, shooting, and pacing the film properly to keep things interesting. It's certainly worth your time - it was worth mine - and I would be on the look-out for anything the crew puts together in the future.",1363737600,6,2372,4.744525547445256
