6014386,5,B00FM4S8IU,"Even with the cast change, I still enjoy SHIRLEY BOOTH as HAZEL!  What a great series and the quality is pretty good too!  I especially like Ann Jillian in this early role as Millie!",1391817600,2,182,4.323529411764706
6014387,5,B00FM4S8IU,"Its an excellent season!  I love it.  Shirley Booth looks tired and seems to lack the energy of the earlier seasons but she's still ""Hazel"", who knows everything about everything.  Ray Fulmer and Lynn Borden as Steve and Barbara Baxter are a cute couple and endearing and their little girl, Suzie, played by Julia Benjamin is a doll.  Bobby Buntrock is growing up and its kind of eerie watching this last season knowing that in six years, he would meet a tragic death in a car accident.  He would have been a great man.  Anyhow, the episodes are pure delight and just as good as the earlier seasons.  This season has a bad reputation because of George and Dorothy (Don DeFore and Whitney Blake) being written out of the series.  It is not a fair assessment.  SUre, they are missed, but all the rest of the ingredients are here to love and enjoy.  A whole lot better than any of today's wasteland of television.",1390780800,7,910,4.4939024390243905
6014388,5,B00FM4S8IU,"After enjoying the first four seasons of 'Hazel' starring the original 'Baxters' (Don Defore and Whitney Blake) alongside Shirley Booth, I was prepared to be disappointed by the revamped lineup of the sitcom's final season. Instead, I found the change to be a refreshing one which gave the show an inherently lighter tone. Not that the previous seasons were dark or anything--but the component of George's confrontational tone with Hazel had gradually become more of a focal point, which I think took something away from the feel-good quality for which 'Hazel' is most prevalently known. With the arrival of Lynn Borden and Ray Fulmer as the new 'Baxter' family for which Shirley Booth plays the maid, there is a less volatile feel--not to mention a slightly more believable component to the character portrayals.

No doubt about it, Defore and Blake were both fine actors. But Borden and Fulmer seemed to portray more everyday personality traits which lent themselves well to the fun, often zany, story lines. There are 29 episodes in total. Some focus on Hazel's tendency to stir up trouble inadvertently; others zoom in on various aspects of Steve Baxter's work as a real estate agent; and one even places the spotlight on Harold (the late Bobby Buntrock, who remained from the original cast) and his friends as they start a kids' rock band of sorts.

There are other familiar faces from earlier seasons of ""Hazel"" here, too: Cathy Lewis (playing George's sister, Deirdre) and Maudie Prickett (as Hazel's fellow maid and friend, Rosie). Through it all, Shirley Booth maintains her remarkably believable acting style which truly makes you forget she's acting. I read an interview with Ray Fulmer from not long after the series was canceled stating that he found the show's writing to be very shoddy, but Booth's abilities to be nothing short of miraculous. I do agree that some of the episodes suffer from loopholes in the plots (and on occasion, abrupt endings). But between the chemistry of the actors, the interesting guest players, Booth's one-of-a-kind talent, and even the background music in the shows, those shortcomings are easy to overlook.

I won't hesitate to recommend this final season of ""Hazel"" to anyone who relishes in the joys of a simpler time in TV during which one could feel like they were getting an inside view of a good-natured, upbeat family which seems to solve problems with humor and persistence.",1390262400,35,2428,5.0049504950495045
6014389,3,B00FM4S8IU,"I love Hazel, at least the first four seasons.  I loved all the actors and miss them in season five.  If the writers were wise they would have at least had it set in the same neighborhood.  I miss the Johnson's, Barney the mailman and Mr. Griffin as well as other regulars.  If they absolutely had to remove Don DeFore and Whitney Blake who were absolutely perfect in their roles, at least they could have kept Rosy and the Johnson's, Mr. Griffin and Smiley.

I do love the little girl in season five, she helped to make it bearable.  George's sister Deidre and her husband Harry Thompson did appear in several episodes of the final season.  I'm happy to own all five seasons and want to thank Shout Factory for making them available to us.",1390089600,14,740,4.437037037037037
6014390,5,B00FM4S8IU,"In this final season of Hazel the series moves to CBS with some cast changes. It is a pleasurable mix of old and new. The only two regular cast members who returned were Shirley Booth (Hazel) and Bobby Buntrock (Harold). News reports at the time stated that when NBC canceled the series Whitney Blake went onto other projects, and so was unavailable to return to the role as Dorothy ""Missy"" Baxter, when CBS later assumed the show. Therefore she and both her TV husband Don DeFore (George Baxter, Esq.) were passed-over for the fifth (and consequently) the final season. It had been later revealed that Blake and DeFore were deemed too old, as demographics were now being heralded to measure audience ratings/ revenue. This season Hazel and Harold move in with George Baxter's younger brother Steve (Ray Fulmer), his wife and daughter Susie. George and Dorothy Baxter are in the Middle-East due to business obligations. This brings a fresh overhaul with Steve Baxter's real estate business as a new challenge for the meddling maid. Also returning on occasion is George and Steve's haughty sister, who finds Hazel a constant irritant. Veteran actress Ann Jillian, here as Steve Baxter's youthful secretary, brings in some high school awkwardness. A good season- better than some of the earlier years!",1389744000,10,1299,5.018518518518518
6014391,4,B00FM4S8IU,"I really hated the fact that they got rid of Missy and Mr. B and gave Hazel a new family. They did keep Harold and the new family was George's younger brother, but the show looses a lot of laughs since most of the fun was watching her antagonize MR. B about everything his weight especially. She would deny him desert and constantly rag on his weight and really interfere with his business partners. I have seen season five on the antenna channel and just found the show not as funny as with her first family. Still Hazel  trys to right the wrongs of the world but looses quite a bit punch since she is not as close to the new Mrs. Baxter and their Daughter as she was to Harold and Missy. However it nice to still see more episodes of Hazel which switched networks too thus making new episodes with this new format. It was quickly cancelled after this season.",1381622400,37,860,4.308641975308642
6014392,5,B00FM4S8IU,"A friend got me hooked on ""Hazel"" in 2006 when the first season was released by Sony.  He's one of the biggest Hazel fans around and could easily pass as Hazel Burke's nephew.  He's just like her in real life.  I hadn't seen the show since reruns last aired in 1975 on local television.  I so enjoyed watching the show again after thirty-one years, that together we waited, and waited, for subsequent seasons to be released on DVD, celebrating each season's announcement.  Today we both fainted in delight over the news that Shout Factory will be releasing the fifth and final season of this classic sitcom on 1-14-14, which will complete the series on DVD.

Since rediscovering ""Hazel"" I have done some recruiting of my own, getting several others hooked on the show.  The storylines are good, Hazel means well, Harold is a cute kid, the Baxters are decent, and I don't have to worry about being offended by some idiot one line jokes like today's television.  I can seek comfort watching Hazel taking care of her family, while getting into some sticky situations.

Thank you, Shout Factory, for giving us the final season of ""Hazel.""",1380844800,57,1134,4.744897959183674

6014397,4,B00FM4S8IU,"Unfortunately, the final season with George's brother is not nearly as good as the first four seasons.  I mean, Hazel and Harold only moved one hour away, and the wealthy yet helpless and hilarious next door neighbors, the Johnsons are off the show.  And the bombastic yet sweet and also hilarious Mr. Griffin is off the show... (Without him the show really plummets to less interesting episodes with less laughs).

Plus, I kind of like the new dad and his daughter, but my partner doesn't like the new mom.  All three are just sort of bland and not very interesting.

I tell you though, what they could have done was move Hazel and Harold into the other house next door.  Or stay in their own house, and take care of both households while opening a boarding house or something.  Now that would have been interesting and funny.

The other house next door to which I am referring had a man and two kids who recently lost their mother. They were really interesting people portrayed by some great actors (and attractive too).  But incredibly, they were only on one or two episodes.  Can't even find their names now on the IMDB.

Yup.  As great as the first four seasons of Hazel was, the fifth was just not up to their usual.",1467676800,,1222,4.504545454545455

Hazel's character in the final season does not reflect the Hazel in previous seasons. This Hazel comes off as more submissive and nonconfrontational.

6014412,5,B00FM4S8IU,"While not quite as good as the previous seasons, the final season has its moments. I am a completeist, I wanted the entire collection, so I had to purchase this remaining set. While original core characters George & Dorothy (Don Defore & Whitney Blake, respectively) Baxter are missed, I can't say Ray Fulmer & Lynn Borden were unlikeable. I liked them both very much. Mr. Steve (George's brother) exuded some of George's temperament, so it was keeping within the traditional essence of Hazel's butting head's with Mr. B. A teenage Ann Jillian is also featured as Steve's secretary. I agree with what another reviewer said regarding this season seeming more like a spin-off, than the actual series. It gave me that vibe as well. However, as it is the final season of this great series, I would advise others to complete their collections. Just don't expect it to be the same feel as the previous seasons. It's different. For one thing, the lighting seems a bit darker. At least to me. Still, Shirley Booth was a tough act to follow & shines her way through all five seasons. I suggest getting this as a finish. For more years than I can count, Hazel hasn't been shown exclusively in syndication. Cable channels would occasionally pick up the series, then, before you know it, it would be gone again within months & it wouldn't get picked up for years by another channel. To buy each season is to be assured it's readily available anytime at our fingertips. They don't make good old fashioned shows like this anymore. However, they can be preserved through our DVD purchases. This also let's distributors know there is indeed a market for classic tv & that there are many of us who appreciate vintage shows & their legendary stars",1442707200,,1729,4.728476821192053

6014445,4,B00FM4S8IU,"These 29 half-hour episodes of the situation comedy ""Hazel's"" final season were originally broadcast on CBS (the first four seasons had been on NBC) from 1965-1966.

Until this final season the series had featured George Baxter (Don Defoe who already had a following from his years as Thorny on ""Ozzie and Harriet"") a successful and wrapped a little too tight attorney who had married a woman (Whitney Blake) with her own lifelong nanny/housekeeper (Shirley Booth in the title role). They had a young son Harold (Bobby Buntrock). George is a klutz around the house and most of the conflict revolves around his frustration when he is routinely shown-up by the much more competent Hazel.

Hazel pretty much runs the family, sorting out the Baxter's weekly problems and keeping the frustrated blustering George in line. Living with Hazel was a lot worse than living with Amos McCoy because she was rarely (if ever) wrong or repentant as she incessantly meddled in everyone's life.

In its last season the producers shake things up and ship George and Dorothy off to Saudi Arabia. Hazel and Harold move in with George's younger brother Steve (Ray Fulmer), his wife Barbara (Lynn Borden), and his daughter Susie (Julia Benjamin); 1960's television was notorious for finding creative ways to back fill with younger children when the original ones grew too old to appeal to their intended demographic.

Steve, Barbara, and Susie constitute the most physically attractive family in television history, but Hazel soon took over their household as well; although Steve and Barbara do stand up to her better than their predecessors. The popular theory at the time was than George and Dorothy just made up the Saudi story so they could escape Hazel's domination and live out their lives somewhere else with some degree of independence.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1440720000,,1870,5.019354838709678

So, out of desperation because we have the whole set of ""Mr. B's"" DVDs we decided to take a chance because we like the values and old time feel of this show.  We actually enjoyed it!!!  It was interesting to see the difference betweent the two famlies.  Of course Mr. B and Dorothy are the best, but this one after awhile began to grow on us!

There is a lot of people from the other household making appearances.  Rosie pops by, and we get to see Deidre the snobby sister in quite a few shows.  Also, we see various people who were ""different characters"" join this show and do a phenomenal job.

All in all...I'd recommend it.  If you can get by the first couple of shows and the initial ""shock"" of seeing Hazel with a different family you'll enjoy it.  Mr. Steve is not ""as nice"" as Mr. B, he can be a little selfish and tempermental, but the wife and Hazel soften him up.

6014472,4,B00FM4S8IU,"This season of Hazel left me feeling like I had eaten twenty-nine delicious Chinese Dinners. Soon after they had been eaten, I was hungry for more. George (Don Defore) and Dorothy (Whitney Blake) were no where in sight. The season starts with Hazel interacting with Harold. Then after the introduction some of Hazel's friends are gathered around: Mert, Barney, Rosie and Harry? I don't remember Harry, as one of her friends, but he was from the ""Fire Department"" and was there to present her with an ""Honorary Fire Department Helmet"". Everybody were upset that Hazel and Harold were leaving to work for George's Brother: Steve and his wife: Barbara, and their daughter: Susie.
As the first episode goes on we learn that George and Dorothy have gone to ""Saudi Arabia"" on a business trip for Mr. Griffin, to assist in closing an oil deal. Hazel tells Rosie that they're only going to be gone about two months, and Harold stayed behind because of school. What I don't understand is, why ""Saudi Arabia""? Why not ""Alaska""? There's oil there too. Mr. Griffin could have had George going around and around in business deals for months, causing friction for George, which could be why Dorothy would have gone with him.
There are so many changes to the show this season, noticeable changes. First: ""Hazel"" is switched from ""NBC"" to ""CBS"". Second: George and Dorothy are not on the show. Neither are The Johnsons, ""Smiley, The Dog"", ""Mr. Griffin"", or most of ""The Sunshine Girls"" (except for Mert: ""Queenie Leonard"", who is only on the first episode, and Rosie: ""Maudie Prickett"", who appeared on the first episode and two others.) Barney Hatfield: ""Robert B. Williams"", only appears on the first episode. And Harry, The Fireman: ""Don Kennedy"", too, was only on the first episode. He had appeared one other time in the first season, in the Episode: Harold's Dog Days, as The Trainer.
Hazel and Harold moves in with Steve and Barbara and their daughter, who live in another town. They were never mentioned during the other seasons. There was a ""mentioned Barbara"" who was a ""sister"" of ""Dorothy"", in season three, but she never materialized. Steve and Barbara has young neighbors for friends, ""Fred and Mona"", and their son: Jeff, ""Charles Bateman"", ""Mala Powers"",and ""Pat Cardi""  George and Dorothy's neighbors and friends were The Johnsons, a wonderful older couple. Another noticeable change is the Introduction for the Fifth Season. On television, Hazel is standing outside with an armful of rain gear. As each of The Baxters exits the house, Hazel offers them an umbrella. Each one looks up at the sky and declines the offer. Then in the next clip it is pouring rain, and Hazel runs out of the house with an umbrella up and that same arm full of rain gear. On the Disc, Hazel is on the telephone which she then passes to Steve, ""Ray Fulmer"", who then passes it to Barbara, ""Lynn Borden"". Then Susie, ""Julia Benjamin"" and Harold, ""Bobby Buntrock"". Even the Theme Song is different. It has changed over and over during the series. I really liked the Theme in the beginning of the First  Season. Someone put together a ""Hazel's Theme Compilation"", which can be viewed on ""Youtube"".
Whoever decided on Steve's Career must have gotten the idea to make him a ""Real Estate Broker"" from the First Season's Episode:  ""George's Niece"". And Barbara, unlike Dorothy, haven't a career or job of any kind, other than Housewife and Mom, and occasionally a Volunteer. She did work with Steve, at his office, before they were married, or was it before Susie was born?! Unlike George, who had a dependable, mature secretary: Miss Scott, ""Molly Dodd"", who also disappeared after the Season 4 Episode 25: George's Man Friday, Steve's Secretary: Millie Ballard, ""Ann Jillian"", was very young and immature. She was sillier than she was funny. Ann Jillian also appeared on Season 3, Episode 12: ""Call Me Harve"", as Laurie - Rosie's niece.
If Fred and Mona were supposed to try to draw a younger audience, I'm wondering younger than who? At this point Hazel already had fans watching the show in all age groups. I saw some episodes when I was a kid. Then I saw some in my twenties. And then again much later. Now I own a copy of each season.
I read somewhere that Ray Fulmer was dissatisfied with the scripts and were bad mouthing them. If he was so dissatisfied, why did he agree to do the show?! Surely he must have seen scripts before he took the job! Maybe he needed a paycheck, the way Carol Hines did. (She played ""Carol Post, the wife of Wilbur Post, on Mr. Ed) He must have shown his dissatisfaction after the show was cancelled. Since Shirley Booth handpicked Lynn Borden to play Barbara, surely she could have fired or had Ray Fulmer fired if he had been castigating the show or scripts then. She owned the show by the Fifth Season.
I wish this show had ended differently. Instead of creating a ""Steve and Barbara"", why not use ""Bob and Phyllis Burkett""? They were in the First Season, Episode 9: ""Everyone's Thankful But Us Turkeys"". ""Phyllis"", Beverly Tyler, was the younger sister of George, who was married to ""Bob"", Charles Cooper. Phyllis and Bob, loved and enjoyed Hazel. The show could have kept the other episodes, but still used Susie, making her the daughter of Bob and Phyllis. Unfortunately Beverly Tyler mostly retired from Acting, leaving the Profession in ""1962"", soon after the Episode: ""Everyone's Thankful But Us Turkeys"". She got married and soon had a child. Then in 1972 she left Hollywood and moved to Reno, Nevada, where over the years she only accepted a few local Acting Projects. I can't help but to wonder if she could have been enticed back, with a third place billing, behind Charles Cooper, ""Bob"" and of course Shirley Booth ,""Hazel"", The Star. And since it was said that Shirley was in declining health, if she was choosing not to come back for another season before the Fifth Season was over, perhaps she could have finished up her character. I think it would have been fantastic for her character to have married Barney Hatfield. They could have met up again, gone out on a date or two and then discovered that they were actually mad for each other. Hazel had been spoiling Barney's intentions before by dating others. Barney proposes, which surprises Hazel, but she accepts. This of course would momentarily bring everyone back together: The Johnsons, The Blakes, The Thompsons, including Nancy, who has married Hazel's Nephew: Eddie,  Mr. Griffin, Hazel's Nephews, and other relatives. Plus the surprise of all surprises, George and Dorothy show up unexpectedly along with some of Hazel's and Barney's mutual friends. Then after the Wedding Reception, Hazel and Barney leaves on their Honeymoon and Harold goes off with George and Dorothy. Now this would have been a fantastic ending to a really good show.

  Here Are My Interpretations Of The Episodes In This Season:

1  Episode: ""Who's In Charge Here?"" - George and Dorothy has left on a Business Trip for Mr. Griffin, sending
  Hazel and Harold to stay with George's Brother: Steve and his family.
2  Episode: ""Hazel's Second Week"" - Hazel's efficiency has left Barbara feeling displaced in her own home.
3  Episode: ""How To Lose 30 Pounds In 30 Minutes"" - Hazel has to figure out how to earn the money for a
  Weight-Loss Program she signed up for.
4  Episode: ""Do Not Disturb Occupants"" - Steve regrets selling his house to his client and wants to get out of the

I absolutely dislike the way this show ended, but there isn't anyway to fix it now. As a fan I can only use my
my imagination on how I would have liked for it to have ended. All In All, Hazel was and still is a good show. Recently, I saw some sort of a poll taken about favorite old shows from worse to best. According to the poll,
there were many shows mentioned, but for some reason eleven shows seemed to have been mentioned the most. Unfortunately Hazel was on that poll at number ten. Many fans of old shows just didn't seem to like her. She was simply ahead of her time. And though it is really subtle, Hazel was very liberal and independent. She was never short of dates and it wasn't beyond her to be a bit flirty. Remember the ""Spanish Chauffeur"" and the ""Motorcycle Officer"". There was a Milkman who was begging her for a date too. Yep, Hazel was quite a Gal, she was gutsy, opinionated, outspoken, very clever and wise. Gee, I wish there was more HAZEL!!!!!!!",1424390400,4,12601,4.7056947608200455

Tony, in an earlier review, wondered if anyone else noticed the different opening credits sequence.  I did, immediately, as I had never seen it before.  Was looking for the umbrella skit that I remembered so well as a kid. After a little investigation turns out Shout Factory used the original broadcast opening.  The ""umbrella"" opening was used as a replacement during the subsequent syndicated broadcasts. So while I was a little disappointed at first it turns out that Shout was just being true to original broadcast.

My favorite episode of the final season is ""My Son the Sheepdog"". I'm glad Shout Factory picked up the rights to release these last four seasons after Sony left us hanging after releasing only season one. Once again though, we are left with episodes which are not digitally remastered. Perhaps the original negatives are lost or simply not available, who knows. While most of the episodes look pretty good there are a few episodes which to my eyes appeared to be somewhat dark. I can overlook that. At least now I can watch any episode of Hazel that I want to see. One other thing I noticed...the final season featured two opening title sequences. The only one presented on this release is the more rare opening with the family talking on the phone, not the opening where Hazel offers an umbrella to the family as they leave the house. Oh well.

Little Harold and Hazel have moved in with them while George and Dorothy (""Missy"") are in the middle east for 2 months.  It's strange to me to see Harold without his parents.

6014517,5,B00FM4S8IU,"The final season of Hazel is different from the previous seasons. Hazel is now working in a different town (unnamed) for the younger brother of George Baxter, ""Mr. Steve,"" played by Ray Fulmer, and his wife Barbara, played by Lynn Borden. Bobby Buntrock is still along for the ride as Harold, nephew of Steve, while George and Dorothy (unseen in this series) are on an extended visit to the middle east.  Hazel remains Hazel in this fresh setting, which provides her with new challenges and new scope for meddling in the lives of those she loves. If you're a fan of Hazel, don't be put off by this change of venue, because the stories are as charming and delightful as ever, and a new supporting cast gives Shirley Booth plenty of opportunities for her hilarious shenanigans. Unfortunately, taking Hazel in a new direction didn't lead to a renewal of the series, so this is the final outing for ""the gal who's everybody's pal."" But with five seasons in the can, Shirley Booth as Hazel will live in our hearts forever.",1392422400,7,1017,4.65
6014518,4,B00FM4S8IU,"TV's beloved version of Ted Key's newspaper gag cartoon, Hazel was one of those cozy shows that was just there for comfort, like a carton of ice cream or mom's leftover soup. It wasn't groundbreaking or earth-shaking, but is was better than it gets credit for, largely due to its gifted star, Shirley Booth.

Booth was an unlikely movie and Broadway superstar, winner of Oscars and Emmys (for Hazel) and the narrator of one of the all-time most loved Rankin/Bass holiday specials, The Year Without a Santa Claus. Short and plump with a voice like Betty Boop's, Booth was ideal in the lead role of her series. She reveled in its nuances (yes, Hazel had nuances).

For the first four years of the series, which was also a long-running hit in syndication, Hazel was the live-in maid to the affluent Baxter family. The dad was played by Don DeFore (who also starred in the wonderful Christmas B-movie It Happened on Fifth Avenue and also an owner of one of Disneyland's first restaurants). Mom was played by lovely Whitney Blake (mother of actress Meredith Baxter and co-creator of One Day at a Time). Bobby Buntrock played little Harold with the skill to tear your heart out when he cries about losing his dog or some such--the hallmark of a great child actor.

Season Five was bizarre-O because suddenly mom and dad moved to Saudi Arabia because dad had a business deal...? Harold was left behind to continue in school, to be cared for by dad's younger brother and his young wife. They also had a daughter, giving the lad someone with which to get into wacky adventures.

Hazel was still there for Harold (which seemed to suit him fine, since he always seemed most partial to her). She moved in to a somewhat fancier house with young Steve and Barbara. If you think this sounds convoluted, watch the first episode of season five and set your timer for how long it takes it all to be explained!

Anyway, Steve is sort of like a pre-perm Mike Brady, if he fell asleep at his drafting table and his face stayed pushed in. Barbara (Lynn Borden) is like Samantha's little sister with a sing-song voice but without magic powers. Adorable Susie is adorable (visit stusshow.com to download an exclusive interview with grown up Julia Benjamin, who played Susie). Also appearing regularly was Ann Jillian as Steve's teen secretary.

Hazel lost none of her crusty-but-benign common-sense nor her fresh-baked gumption. She was constantly butting into people's business and coming up with wacky schemes to help others or herself, always in a loving and sensible way. She was the mom we never had -- or the mom we did have minus all the baggage.

There are some great episodes in season five, including one in which she mistakes a great painter for the house painter; Hazel tries to overhaul a roadster; Hazel markets her homemade chili (a surefire sitcom staple); Steve tries to win a perfect boss contest; and my favorite of the season, in which the adults aim to get the boys to give up that surely-to-go-away ""rock and roll fad"" by dressing and acting like hippies and groovers (it's always fun to see how '60s sitcoms treated the youth movement).

By the time that episode was made, Ray Fulmer, who at first had lacked the charm and warmth of Don DeFore, had become more comfortable and loose in his role as Steve. The chemistry between Steve and Hazel was different; Hazel couldn't chide this thinner, younger man about his weight or his age. Film veteran DeFore never lost his charm, even when he was furious. Stage actor Fulmer, who later derided the Hazel show's writing, became a soap actor, for which his dour demeanor was better suited.

Steve and Barbara are like a sitcom version of Don and Betty Draper, a couple that looks like the top of a wedding cake, trying to ascend the ladder of what was defined as success in the Wonder Bread world of early sitcom suburbia.

The later shows in Season Five of Hazel are the strongest. The cast begins to connect and storylines are less about real estate and more about the people in and around the Baxter home, particularly sister-in-law Deirdre, a social shark played masterfully by TV and radio veteran Cathy Lewis (the original Jane on My Friend Irma). She's the perfect Margaret Dumont to Hazel's Groucho. Once familiar faces return, the season swings into gear.

There would have been a sixth season, since the series was still getting great ratings (this year it had moved to CBS's strong Monday night lineup), but Booth's ill health prevented it. Too bad, the world always needs its Hazels -- especially in the late '60s.

How would Hazel Burke have dealt with protestors? She'd probably pick up a sign, march with them, totally embarrass Mr. Steve, enrage Mr. Steve's stuffy business associates, then whip up some hot, juicy roast beef sandwiches and home-fried donuts (all the while claiming that ""they ain't up to my usual"") -- which would soften everyone's heart so much that all the troubles would go away.

It's painful enough that two of the three big stars on the show are gone, and the replacements seem wooden a lot of times, but that's mostly because I wasn't used to them much. However, once the season got some steam behind it, I didn't find them all that much worse. Why? Because while the battles were going on between the three main stars in previous seasons, this season took a much more cooperative feel to everybody involved. And while it wasn't a good sitcom in the final season compared to other sitcoms, somehow it worked quite well within the Hazel universe, almost a breath of fresh air.

 I never would have believed it, and I always hated this season previously, because I was all so turned off against the new Baxters and the old crew given the air, so naturally I just saw it in clips and didn't really invest in it like buying it on dvd can do. If you hated it like me, and therefore hardly watched it, I think you'll be surprised that it's quite a bit better than you always thought. I would put it as a pretty close match to the other seasons for just the enjoyment aspect.

It's different from before, but compared to all the years of skullduggery on previous years, it is quite nice. It does have the convenience of color too. Finally, I would imagine that the early years were more true to the Hazel comic strip, so from that aspect this may seem almost an abomination, but the change in tone does show you what it could be like without all the fussing going on, sans the early Baxters.",1505433600,,1598,4.428571428571429
8616815,1,B00FM4S8IU,Just don't care for the last season.  The interaction between Mr. B and Hazel was priceless.  As a whole Hazel and the first family were unforgettable.  The original characters were wonderful and then you have Mr. Griffin sprinkled in and what a blast.  It is a show that puts a smile on my face.  Will definitely purchase the first four seasons.,1503619200,,346,4.60655737704918

She was always so optimistic and loving. I did read that the first choice to play Hazel was Thelma Ritter. Always a great actress, I just wondered how different the show would have been. Miss Ritter had to withdraw for health reasons and Shirley stepped on board. It was not until years later that I discovered that Miss Booth was a serious dramatic actress, winning the best actress Oscar for Come Back Little Sheba. I own the DVD of that film and also ordered the entire five seasons of Hazel. She is simply one of the greats !!",1498435200,,707,4.323308270676692
