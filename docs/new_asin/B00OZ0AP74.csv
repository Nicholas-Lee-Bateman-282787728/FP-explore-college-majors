6777288,5,B00OZ0AP74,"Brilliant. As a fan so glad I had a chance to see this. Was a special thrill to see so many people doing so well and looking so great. Other than Nan Woods they had *everyone*, including the underrated Chloe Web, Michael Boatman, Nancy Giles. A wonderful revisiting to a very special show.

Now-when are we going to get CB on Amazon Instant?!",1418774400,2,342,4.428571428571429
6777289,3,B00OZ0AP74,"very good.....but....you only get 67mins and apparently this gathering covered probably 90 mins and just stops in the middle of director talking ending abrutly with everyone seated on stage, leaving one wanting more",1418428800,15,215,5.545454545454546

6777292,3,B00OZ0AP74,The Paley Center does a lot of these tv show cast reunions.  I though this one had too many of the original cast to make it really valuable.,1478995200,,140,4.0

6777295,5,B00OZ0AP74,Loved the series China Beach! Watched it regularly when I was in college for nursing. Colleen Mcmurphy was my hero!! It was great to see the cast together again and to heat so many touching stories...never knew sarg was in Vietnam himself,1457568000,,238,4.690476190476191

6777302,5,B00OZ0AP74,"I stumbled across this when I was looking up the DVDS that came out last year and couldn't believe that it's been 25 years AND that they had a reunion AND that they didn't invite me to it! The Nerve of those people to forget me, how dare they....why I never! (smile)

However, it was amazing and yet too brief. I had a ton of other questions I needed answered until the movie abruptly ended when they could of done this for two hours and had a meet and greet with the fans, afterwards. No such luck. Jodie got my money and is gone! Maybe they'll have another reunion with the red-headed male medic they forgot on the panel at least they mentioned Cherry, though she too was absent. I won't hold my breath on another reunion....well, on second though...(gulp).",1440720000,3,759,4.421428571428572
6777303,5,B00OZ0AP74,I haven't viewed the product - it is a gift for my daughter and we are both China Beach fans.  I'm giving it to her for her birthday and can't wait until she watches it so she lends it to her Mother.  Such a good show.,1439596800,,218,3.717391304347826
6777304,5,B00OZ0AP74,"The wife waited years for this show to come out on dvd, she was so very thrilled when this special reunion was also made available to the public on dvd!",1438387200,,152,4.1
6777305,5,B00OZ0AP74,Loved seeing the cast reminisce about the show. It would be nice to have a CHINA BEACH movie to catch up on all the characters.,1437004800,,127,4.12
6777306,5,B00OZ0AP74,"I was so excited that the China Beach videos are now available. I love therm! The series is like a trip back to the 60's and a whole new series, some 25 years after its production",1435881600,,179,4.0
6777307,3,B00OZ0AP74,"A nice little retrospective reunion for this classic show. It's worth it for the price, but recommended pretty much for the die hard fans and collectors.",1435190400,,153,4.923076923076923
6777308,5,B00OZ0AP74,"Fun to see them 20 years later.  Everyone still looks great, and continue to provide a wonderful memory of a horrendous Viet Nam conflict.  So we can honor and remember those that gave their lives and the veterans who fought for our freedom.",1433721600,2,241,4.5813953488372094

6777312,2,B00OZ0AP74,It was ok but nothing special. I would have liked it better if they had clips and talked about them. It was not worth the money to be honest.,1427241600,,141,3.896551724137931
6777313,5,B00OZ0AP74,"I was so happy to find this series on Amazin as I loved the show. The music chosen is perfect for each scene and it's well written. I love how real veterans are interviewed during various seasons, you can see where the story lines came from. I bought the 25th reunion episode as well but it turns out that it was already part of the boxed set, also the dog tag that is supposed to be included wasn't but that's not Amazon's error.  This is a worthwhile purchase!",1424390400,5,462,4.25
6777314,3,B00OZ0AP74,"It's nice to see the cast again, to hear the stories - some new, some well-known. It's entertaining, it's fun, it sends you back to China Beach. Definitely worth watching if you are a fan of the show.

I watched this via livestream back then and was looking forward to this DVD as I wanted to share this entertaining Q&A with a friend. I had raved over the end, wanted to hear the haunting harmonica tune again that had caused me - and everybody there - to cry. Imagine my disappointment when I found the panel cut off before that happened.

I'm happy to have this, but I would have loved to have it all.",1422921600,,604,4.243478260869566
6777315,5,B00OZ0AP74,It's so hard to believe that it's been 25 years. I still LOVE this show and I enjoy every one of the actors & actresses who were a part of it.,1422144000,,142,3.6129032258064515
6777316,2,B00OZ0AP74,"After viewing, it seems that part of the interview was cut off and they did not show the entire interview",1421366400,3,105,4.3
6777317,5,B00OZ0AP74,"Just amazing!  however in the end it seems that the video was cut before finishing, do not know if it was just my DVD, but it ends very strange. I remember watching live and online, the DVD seems to be shorter and incomplete.",1419984000,6,225,4.232558139534884
6777318,4,B00OZ0AP74,"Just like any reunion, you have ever attended, they are
fun and they are sad.
You look forward to seeing how people have changed,
and hearing about what they have done through the
years.
But they are also sad, when you hear about the ones,
that are no longer with us.
The China Beach Reunion, gives you that same feeling,
just as it should.
And when it ends, it will leave you wanting to stay, with these
old friends, a while longer.",1419724800,4,433,4.2926829268292686

8685639,5,B00OZ0AP74,"I loved the series and watched it weekly, when it was televised.  It's so well done.
The reunion was something I was drawn to watch. I usually don't engage in such.  But this was different.  It was my time and a war that marred my generation.  We live it every day of our lives.  This was well worth seeing at any price.  It's been available a long time.  It was finally my right time to see the performers in a five years ago time frame.",1528329600,,438,4.08235294117647
8685640,5,B00OZ0AP74,"If you are a China Beach fan, this is a must have. Paley Live has done a similar high quality reunion for Person of Interest.",1525651200,,125,4.04
8685641,3,B00OZ0AP74,I long for China Beach to be a digital own but this was a little weak on the substance for my liking.,1524528000,,101,3.6363636363636362

8685645,3,B00OZ0AP74,"I thought it was the reunion movie, but it's a reunion of the cast of the show. Interesting since I never missed a show or the reunion movie. Still waiting for the 'movie.'  It was a great show but heart wrenching most of the time. It gave you the real side of life during the Viet Nam conflict.",1492646400,,295,4.086206896551724
