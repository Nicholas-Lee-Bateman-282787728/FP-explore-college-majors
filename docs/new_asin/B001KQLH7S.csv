3668273,5,B001KQLH7S,"Hory Shit this is a Very Good Video !!! Wasn't expecting is, But was Very Surprised by the Quality of production taken into this video. Highly Recommend it !!!",1352505600,,159,4.517241379310345
3668274,4,B001KQLH7S,"I just recently purchased this video DVD. It is another amazing performance by Robert & Jimmy! The video is pretty good quality for a DVD....I prefer Bluray...the sound is only DOLBY DIGITAL 2.0.
I have an amazing surround sound system and a Led HD TV......so I'm very pleased with this concert DVD.I got to see JIMMY PAGE and ROBERT PLANT perform this same concert in St. Louis, MO.
They totally know how to play kick-ass ROCK and ROLL!!!",1347753600,,439,4.641025641025641
3668275,4,B001KQLH7S,"Great performance. Almost the same lineup as ""No Quarter"" released a few years later. What makes this a great concert is the ""raw"" factor. The songs are the same you have heard before, yet they are performed just differently enough to make them a great experience. The drummer just rocks! The entire band is the same as in ""No Quarter"" and it rocks!
Complaints? The actual quality of the video is poor. Not even DVD quality and leaves a lot to be desired from the visual perspective. The sound is only available in stereo. So no 5.1.
Why 4 stars? The musical performance is that good. If you enjoy these two legends plus an awesome band performing with them, then you will love this DVD.",1344902400,28,687,4.504
3668276,5,B001KQLH7S,"I was very pleased and supprised how good this DVD is. I cannot believe this is out there it is the best kept secret for a Zeppelin fan, Robert is about 50 and Pagey is 53 and man did they still have it right from the beggining of the concert when they rip out the (want on song)with a quick (imigrant song intro)untill the end they kicked it the whole concert. The quality is 2nd rate but you still will love this.",1344816000,15,415,4.073170731707317
3668277,4,B001KQLH7S,"I love this DVD!! It made me smile as soon as I put it on. The backing band here is great. They rock through the Zeppelin catolog with great skill. Jimmy Page is playing the custard out of his guitar as usual, and Robert Plant has no problem matching his prowess on vocals. A VERY GOOD DEAL!",1342742400,5,291,4.12280701754386
3668278,4,B001KQLH7S,"Great to see Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, it has an acceptable sound. The selection of songs are pretty good. Recommended!",1333929600,2,122,4.857142857142857
3668279,5,B001KQLH7S,"this DVD of Jimmy Page & Robert Plant was filmed during the same tour that brought us the ""No Quarter"" DVD performances but in Irvine, California...
from the opening of the Wonton Song thru the end of Kasmir, this performance is AWESOME ! more rockin' vibe to the show !!!
the drummer, Michael Lee, is on fire thru out & Page is in rare form- leading the band with some of his best live playing
that i've ever seen thru an even more spirited performance of much of the material on ""NQ"" !!!
Plant is inspired by the energy of the band & is master-full thru out this show...
HIGHLY recommend to any 'Zeppelin fan - get while you can find one !",1288483200,54,641,4.219512195121951
3668280,5,B001KQLH7S,"I was there and I've waited years for this to finally be released, but never thought it would be. A true show of shows. I can see my girlfriend (later my wide) and myself in the second row on Jimmy's side! I'm from Glendale, Ca. and the Glendale Symphony Orchestra was helping to back up the band. I remember us thinking it was one of those karmic moments during a night of epic music I never thought I'd see at that time. The version of ""Thank You"" played that night was simply incredible. The whole huge ensemble of musicians was so tight that night. It was an amazing evening of music, eating & drinking and love. You could feel the energy of the audience beaming at the band. It was a very powerful experience. We still look back on that show as one of the greatest concert's we'd ever been to. And I've seen a lot of bands. The DVD quality itself is good enough. The sound is good. Basically this is a bootleg DVD from what I can tell. I'm surprised the video quality isn't better because the technology was there and Irvine was known to film shows there all the time. I can get by every complaint every reviewer may have simply because I've wanted to own this footage for almost 20 years. If you were there, you'd want it too. Lol.
In 1998, when the Walking Into Clarksdale Tour came to Irvine, we had the exact same seeats as before, but that is a different story altogether. Live At Irvine Meadows is well worth your time and money.",1401580800,,1440,4.317343173431734
3668281,1,B001KQLH7S,"This DVD has no chapters, you can't go to different parts of the DVD, you have to watch it from start to finish. It is not HD so if you are not watching it on an old tube TV, it looks like cr@p. Then who ever made this DVD added their own computer generated psychedelic artwork over the concert footage. Don't waste your money.",1381968000,,327,4.125
3668282,4,B001KQLH7S,"I put off ordering this for several months because I thought it was going to be some lousy bootleg that was shot from some guys cheap camera. Well, clearly this was a professional video (there's even on-stage footage). My guess is that they were planning on releasing a recording of this concert and for whatever reason it never happened. So the end result is it never got all the final mixing & editing done and someone just put it out there as is. Unfortunately, someone had already added some cheesy effects to it, but only during a couple songs. Very pleased with it and glad I got it. Any Zep/Page-Plant fan should have it.",1381536000,2,628,4.517543859649122
3668283,5,B001KQLH7S,"These guys  are never outta style, they always play a powerful show and never seem to get boring. No Quarter",1379116800,,108,4.4
3668284,5,B001KQLH7S,I was a few years too young to get to see Led Zeppelin in their prime. The next best thing is to be able to see these wonderful videos.,1378512000,2,135,3.689655172413793
3668285,5,B001KQLH7S,HERE AGAIN I WISH I HAD KNOWN ABOUT THIS CONCERT AS I WAS LIVING HERE BY THEN. OH WELL MY ERROR IN NOT KEEPING UP AT THE TIME. LOVED THIS CONCERT AS IT SHOWS THAT EVEN AFTER LED ZEPPELIN WAS OVER WITH THESE TWO REALLY LIKE PLAYING TOGETHER AND IT SHOWS.,1377475200,,253,3.980392156862745
3668286,5,B001KQLH7S,Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. Great show by two rock legends that includes a nice mix of material.  What more needs to be said?,1377302400,3,126,4.25
3668287,5,B001KQLH7S,"This appears seems to be a practice session for the Unledded tour of the mid-90's. Recording and performance could be better, however the energy and passion shown by the duo is quite startling - this ain't just playing by numbers. Almost a heavenly, spiritual experience and should not be shunned by any Led Zeppelin follower!",1376956800,,326,4.945454545454545
3668288,4,B001KQLH7S,"wish I was there..

4 stars?  Hey no Stairway (a couple notes thrown in at the end of Babe-Im Gonna Leave You at least.
16 great Zeppelin tunes plus a few more sprinkled in during Whole Lotta Love and the closer - Kashmir makes for a great closer.

Really liked how when the song called for it the drummer was using Four Sticks

Jimmy and Robert are on - the film is high bootleg quality - a couple minor sound hiccups - no biggie there

Enjoyed it and will again.",1375660800,,464,4.111111111111111
3668289,2,B001KQLH7S,"It looks like it was copied in a garage. It has WT on the screen and a blurry spot on the bottom right. I learned something with this.
Read the reviews before you order anything. It sure looks like bad bootleg DVD",1375488000,,213,4.095238095238095
3668290,5,B001KQLH7S,"I was at this concert, brought back memories of a lifetime. Hope they continue putting out anything they have left. Loved the show.",1374710400,,131,4.739130434782608
3668291,5,B001KQLH7S,I was amazed at this dvd. As a very loyal zep fan I can say I was transported back to the best of times. Great for any collector.,1374019200,,129,3.642857142857143
3668292,4,B001KQLH7S,"Very good concert.  Plant and Page carry it naturally, but the other musicians are darn good in their own right.  They wouldn't be on stage with these two if they weren't. Picture quality was...OK, but sound is up to par.  Depending on who you buy this DVD from, it can be a really great bargain.  Shop the prices, and buy the disc. Life is too short to not see all the Zep (or near Zep) you can. I saw them live in Atlanta in 1969 just after their first album came out and I knew then this was something special. Little did I know how much so.",1373673600,,544,4.05607476635514
3668293,2,B001KQLH7S,"Just awful quality in audio and video, for harcore fans only. Decent price, but not woth it. I loved Celebration Day obviously more expensive than this, but really good :)",1372809600,,171,4.733333333333333
3668294,5,B001KQLH7S,"Great show, pro shot, well worth $10 but it sure looks like a bootleg.
If it is it's a very good one & well worth the money",1369267200,,123,3.5925925925925926
3668295,4,B001KQLH7S,"I've been an enthusiastic Zep fan and collector for many years, and I'll be the first to acknowledge that Page and Plant haven't always lived up to their fans' enormous expectations.  ""How weak the mortal frame"" indeed.  More often than not in this post-Zep age, these giants of rock have outright disappointed; Page unable to make meaningful new music and for the most part fumbling his way through the Zep catalog (his collaboration with the Black Crowes being a notable exception), and Plant inspiring winces and shudders with each false note and vocal blowout.

These shortcomings are on full display in this show.  How the mighty have fallen!  And yet, in spite of all that, I would definitely recommend this show to all serious fans.  Unreservedly.

For one thing, there's just not that much post-Zep Zep available.  What makes this particular offering so attractive though, is the set list.  Several songs that were either never or rarely performed by the band in their heyday or had long since dropped off the actively performed list are featured: The Wonton Song, Bring It On Home, That's the Way, Friends, Four Sticks, Gallows Pole...  Irresistible to any more-than-casual fan.

Kudos also to the lads for rearranging songs in novel ways to give them new life as well.  This set includes an acoustic No Quarter unlike any other version.

Do these revisionings always work?  No, not in my opinion.  Is it sad to hear Plant strain and fail to hit the high notes?  Of course.  Or to hear Page reduced to stock runs rather than imaginative, original improvisation?  Ditto.  But backed by an able rhythm section and the wonderful Egyptian Pharaohs, P & P were out there again, trying.  That alone was and is cause for celebration.  And when they actually manage to sound pretty good in places, in spite of the terrible ravages of time, they shrug off the long years on the trusty steed of their immortal music, and rise up once more--taking us with them.",1367452800,,1959,4.8053892215568865
3668296,4,B001KQLH7S,"no overdubs here, mistakes, poor choice and awhole lot of real good live music, plant cracks, Jimmy slips and the rest just keep going until the ebb and flow resumes. Bad choices- probably ""Ya ya"" but that's it, may tracks just take you away.",1364515200,,242,4.5227272727272725
3668297,4,B001KQLH7S,"I gave it a four star because the audio could have been a little bit better. I saw this tour and I am glad woodstock tapes released this dvd. If you are a Page/Plant fan, you need this in your dvd collection.",1363478400,,208,3.9761904761904763
3668298,1,B001KQLH7S,"This DVD has very poor video quality, No in Wide Screen but in 4:3
Sound also terrible not what I expected
Price ok, shipping was fast..",1358467200,,136,4.269230769230769
3668299,4,B001KQLH7S,an xmas stocking filler went down very well for an ex headbanging son; now almost in his 50s a bit slower these days,1357862400,,116,4.086956521739131
3668300,5,B001KQLH7S,"What an excellent concert, I don't believe that this is a bootleg, it looks Proshot to me for television or a video that never got released, its a VHS quality recording that's a little over 2 hours long, Robert Plant has his solo band as a backing band, Charlie Jones on Bass, Michael Lee on Drums and Porl Thompson on Guitar the only thing that would have made this better if John Paul Jones would have been on Bass and Keyboards, the orchestra consisted of The Egyptian Pharaohs and the Southern California Orchestra.

3668301,4,B001KQLH7S,"This concert video seems to be a practice session for the 'Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, No Quarter UnLedded' of the mid-90's.  Recording and performance of concerned item could be better.  However, energy emitted by Page and Plant is what was placed forth during lifes original phase Zeppelins machine.  Watching and listening to 'Jimmy Page & Robert Plant Live at Irvine Meadows' is a heavenly, spiritual experience allowing a healing and turning about of a wrong.  This item should not be shunned by any Led Zeppelin follower!
