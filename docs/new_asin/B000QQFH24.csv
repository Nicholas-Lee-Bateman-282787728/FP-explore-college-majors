8196772,5,B000QQFH24,You're not a legit wrestling fan if you haven't watched this.. ALONE! One of the best superstars of all time!,1453161600,,109,4.5
8196773,3,B000QQFH24,"I chose the 3 star rating, only because I felt like it lacked interviews and professional photos of The Monster. It was mostly some generic TNA story of The Monster Abyss in his current storyline (back in the early stages of TNA 2003-4) that left a lot to the imagination by throwing in some footage that was already aired on TNA television and dubbing it with words on the bottom. AND that the ""photo gallery"" was just some lucky shots of the wrestler in action, not really any professional shots at all. However, the DVD is a must for any fan because you simply cannot beat the price and if you love Abyss, like myself, then buy it. I did like how they included the debut match he did that supposedly never aired on television and the private childhood photos that he, himself, must've provided to the fans a rare glimpse of him as a young boy. You still don't see his face at all in this DVD, but it's got some decent matches and some pretty awesome moments that chronicle the beginning era of this TNA veteran's early career. Of course he has a lot of memorable matches much better and more hardcore then these selected, but it must've been before this movie came out. I hope TNA continues or picks up at least another opportunity to do DVDs like these in the future. I would love another one of The Monster Abyss because he is my favorite.

I bought this used for $5, you can't beat that price at all. Shipping was fast and reliable through UPS, came right to my door and didn't need to sign.",1395187200,,1497,4.365591397849462
8196774,5,B000QQFH24,i will always love Abyss. i think sometimes he is the best thing for TNA wrestling.,1282608000,,83,4.25
8196775,4,B000QQFH24,how can you have a dvd where the title character loses all but 2 matches on it. great matches though.,1257379200,,101,4.1
8196776,4,B000QQFH24,"I was always a fan of Abyss, many considered him the Kane or Mankind of TNA which I whole-heartedly agreed with. He has had some matches that Cactus Jack and Sabu would have cringed at, including matches with Sabu himself that are completely unforgettable. This is one DVD that deserves your attention. Matches include:

Destination X 2005
Full Metal Mayhem Match:
This was against Jeff Hardy and it was a wild brawl all over the building. Jeff Hardy at one point climbs a metal structure outside of the building and gives a Swanton Bomb to Abyss through two tables. They fight back in the ring and continue to beat each other up with chairs, ladders, chains, and more tables. Abyss at one point powerbombs Jeff through a table from the top rope! At the end of the match Abyss throws Jeff onto a pile of tacks after the match was over! 8/10

Lockdown 2005
Six Sides of Steel Cage Match:
This was against Aj Styles and this was another wild brawl. Abyss at one point slams the cage door against Aj's head in a horrific spot! They continue to fight and AJ gives a sunset flip off the cage wall to Abyss right onto a pile of tacks! They continue to fight and Aj gets the win. 10/10

Bound for Glory 2005
Monsters Ball Match #2:
This is one of the best matches on the disk set. This included sabu, rhino, Abyss, and Jeff Hardy. Highlights include Jeff Hardy giving a massive swanton bomb to Abyss through two tables off the top of the titantron in a fantastic moment. Many tables and weapons were used, rhino even gored Abyss through a table in an impressive spot. Sabut gets put through a table and rhino gets the win after giving a sort of piledriver move to jeff hardy off the top rope. 10/10

Turning Point 2005
Barbed Wire Massacre:
Ok, let me just say this, this was an AWESOME match! Sabu and Abyss fought in a ring with barbed wire as ring ropes and anything you could think of was wrapped in barbed wire surrounding the ring. Highlights include Abyss throwing Sabu into the wire and then missing a charge and diving right into the wire himself! Too many sick spots to name but Sabu gets the win after putting abyss in the middle of two boards of barbed wire and jumping right on top of abyss to win the match! 10/10

Against All Odds 06
Falls Count Anywhere Match:
This was against Rhino and they indeed take it all over the building. Highlights include Abyss throwing Rhino through a couple of tables in the ring and then Rhino managed to fight back and they take it into the stands. The end comes when Rhino gores Abyss of the stands and Abyss falls through a set of tables he himself set up. great ending. 8.5/10

Lockdown 2006
Six sides of steel match:
This was against Christian Cage. A back and forth match and Christian at one point gives a frog splash to Abyss off the top of the cage! Two bags of tacks were used and Abyss slams christian in the tacks and then uses his chain to choke Christian out. However christian gets the win and retains his World Heavyweight title. 9/10

Bound for Glory 2006
Monster's Ball #3:
This included Abyss, Spike Dudley, Raven, and Samoa Joe. They brawled all over the ring and yes a lot of weapons were used in this match. Jake ""the snake"" Roberts was the ring enforcer/ref guy and he included a lot of moments himself. At one point Spike Dudley fell off a edge of the titantron and fell over 10 feet to the floor itself! pretty good match. 8.5/10

Genesis 2006
This was for the World Heavyweight Championship and it was against Sting. They included some nasty bumps, including Sting getting slammed onto thumbtacks almost like Ric Flair did a few months previous, not as impressive as flairs but still will make you cringe. Sting then goes crazy and beats up Abyss and throws him off the stage onto two boards that were set up wrapped in barbed wire! Abyss wins the title in a disqualification. 9/10

Extras include:

footage of Abyss' invasion of Christian Cage's home where he almost drowned christian in his swimming pool.

a photo gallery including pictures of ""Chris...the person behind the character Abyss""

Abyss' TNA debut in a handicap match

and his story of the history with James Mitchel

this is worth it if you want to see no holds barred wrestling with some death defying moments, this is recommended...",1183075200,6,4266,4.501940491591203
8196777,4,B000QQFH24,"Abyss is the TNA's resident hardcore character like how previous federations has Cactus Jack, Sabu, and Abdullah The Butcher in which whenever he's in the ring, you can expect hardcore violence & putting his body on the line more than anything else.  Viewer Discretion Is Advised on this DVD since it contains various bloody brawls featuring the use of thumbtacks & barbed wire amongst other weapons.

Destination X 2005: Full Metal Mayhem vs. ""The Charismatic Enigma"" Jeff Hardy - They went all over the building & outside using tables, ladders, and (of course) thumbtacks. Hardy is great at these weapons matches and Abyss is TNA's hardcore expert.  Great hardcore match.
(Also available on ""Best Of The Bloodiest Brawls"" & ""Best Of Jeff Hardy"")

Lockdown 2005: Six Sides of Steel Cage Match vs. ""The Phenomenal"" AJ Styles - This match is just awesome. It's not really a bloody massacre but a great storytelling of ""the big unstoppable monster vs. the little guy who never gives up.""
(Also available on ""Best Of The Bloodiest Brawls"" & ""Best Of A.J. Styles 2"")

Bound For Glory 2005: Monster's Ball 2 vs. ""The Homicidal, Genocidal, Suicidal"" Sabu vs. ""The Charismatic Enigma"" Jeff Hardy vs. ""The War Machine"" Rhino - This match goes all over the place, weapons galore, and tons of spots.  Look out for Jeff Hardy's dive off the top of the stage onto the floor thought a table.
(Also available on ""Best Of The Bloodiest Brawls"")

Turning Point 2005: Barbed Wire Massacre vs. ""The Homicidal, Genocidal, Suicidal"" Sabu - This match was just sick as you see moments like Sabu getting dropped on his neck into the barbed wire and Abyss squished inbetween two barbed wire boards. It's not as distubring as Sabu's last two barbed wire matches (Hardcore Homecoming & vs. Terry Funk) but it still leaves an impression.
(Also available on ""Best Of The Bloodiest Brawls"")

Against All Odds 2006: Falls Count Anywhere vs. Rhino - They took it back to the old ECW hardcore days in this match as it was non-stop brawling in the ring & through the area with even a gore that Abyss took from the top of the bleachers through tables that is something to see.

Lockdown 2006: Six Sides Of Steel Cage Match vs. NWA Champion Christian Cage - This was a brutal match very similiar to the match last year Abyss had with Styles but Christian dished out the punishment as much as he took it. This wasn't the typical Abyss match with the thumbtack spots so that made this even more special. Again, just another great match.

Bound For Glory 2006: Monster's Ball vs. Samoa Joe vs. Brother Runt (Spike Dudley) vs. Raven - This was a step below last years match but that doesn't mean it wasn't good as it was a good four way brawl with even Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts getting involved from time to time, however if your looking for the Samoa Joe ""wrestling clinic"" that he has a reputation for, you won't find it in this match.

Genesis 2006: vs. NWA Champion Sting - I was expecting to see Sting to do his usual stops throughout this match but Sting stepped it up in this match the way he should have at Bound For Glory.  There was a mix of brawling & in the ring action before it went hardcore with Sting even landing shirtless on tacks harder & stiffer than than Ric Flair got it in ECW months earlier.  However, when Sting absolutely loses his mind is when the match goes downhill.  He beats Abyss down, hangs him & beats him with his bat before putting him through barbed-wire boards...all of which took a while to set up each spot.  Sting ended up getting disqualified & Abyss wins the NWA Title due to a rule that has been around since TNA started up but people forgot about it because alot of the TNA title matches in recent years don't end with the champions getting disqualified or counted out.  It's something that ""traditional"" wrestling fans don't like & don't agree with.

Also on here would be a look at the story behind the Abyss' past from Christian Cage and Tomko revealing their ""secret"", the wars between Sting and James Mitchell, all the way to Abyss' return from being beaten down by Christian Cage & others.

DVD extras will be footage of Abyss' invasion of Christian Cage's home, photo gallery including pictures of Chris...the person behind the character Abyss, and Abyss TNA debut in a handicap match.

The main problem with this DVD set is the same exact problem that TNA has been having with their previous non-PPV DVD releases...they keep reusing the same matches.  The first two matches are on at 2 other non-PPV DVD sets and four of these matches were on the ""Best Of The Bloodiest Brawls"" DVD from a year ago.  Besides that little flaw, this is going to be a great set for those who were fans of hardcore ""weapons"" wrestling.  I recommend if you aren't a heavy collector of TNA DVD's.",1182816000,6,4788,4.621462264150943
