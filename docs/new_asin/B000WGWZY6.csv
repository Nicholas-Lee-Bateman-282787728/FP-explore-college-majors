2968783,5,B000WGWZY6,"I bought several dvds from this company as a present for my mom and she loved them. They arrived very quickly and in excellent condition. She couldn't say enough about how she enjoyed watching her favorite country music stars back in the day. The only complaint I have is that I didn't realize the company I ordered from charged shipping per dvd, regardless of how they were packaged. (Believe it or not I've never run across this practice before.) I ended up paying over seventeen dollars in shipping for one package. Needless to say, I won't be ordering from this company again. If you're not planning on ordering much from them, then they would be good to order from. My mom loved her dvds. I just didn't like the shipping.",1350864000,7,726,4.592307692307692
2968784,5,B000WGWZY6,"Another excellent volume in the 8-DVD Time-Life collection of classic country music performances from Grand Ole Opry. This disc focuses on duet singing, with some wonderful performances by teams such as Goldie Hille & Justin Tubb, George Jones & Tammy Wynette (two songs), Bill Anderson & Jan Howard, Porter Wagner & Dolly Parton and -- of course -- Loretta Lynn & Conway Twitty, the most popular country duet partnership ever. There are several special gems, such as Skeeter Davis and (a very young) Bobby Bare covering the Everly Brothers oldie, ""Let It Be Me"", Patsy Cline singing a rare duet (with TV host Bobby Lord) and the tragically underrated Melba Montgomery in a sterling performance with the great George Jones.

This disc includes fifteen live performances (and no lip-syncing, as far as I can tell...) along with bonus features such as interviews with various Opry veterans. The material is drawn from old Opry TV broadcasts and other venues such as ""The Bobby Lord Show"" and other, long-forgotten shows that were the country equivalents of ""Soul Train"" and ""American Bandstand."" The video quality is very good and the sound quality is excellent -- it's a chance to see many of the biggest stars in Nashville playing real, honest country music, the way it used to be. This collection is a true gift -- highly recommended! (DJ Joe Sixpack / Slipcue music reviews)",1197244800,17,1376,4.956709956709957

8223250,5,B000WGWZY6,"Though this video contains 15 performances, it seemed way too short.  Many of the sets are by important performers.  The two with Dolly Parton were particularly enjoyable.
