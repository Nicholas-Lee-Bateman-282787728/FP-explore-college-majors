7599589,4,B01AEOM79S,It was entertaining but could have spent more time on his on field baseball time.,1461542400,,81,4.466666666666667
7599590,5,B01AEOM79S,"Back in 1994 when Ken Burn's did his documentary on PBS about baseball it was a complete look at the game and the players who made the game great. Of course no story about the history of the sport would be complete without looking at Jackie Robinson and he roll in helping to bring an end to the segregation of the sport. It also looks at his career in baseball as well and how he did more to the game of baseball then just break the color line. He changed the way baseball was played bringing with him when he joined the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947 the style of baseball that was commonly played in the old Negro Baseball league. It was one of the best parts of an outstanding documentary that Ken Burns is well known for making. If you want to see that particular segment of the film it is during Inning 6 which covers baseball during the 1940's.

But while the segment on Jackie is well told during the documentary it just covers Jackie's life during his time with baseball with a slight touch looking at his life after his retirement in 1957 before the start of that years baseball season. It doesn't look at the whole life of Jackie Robinson and what he did before and after his time playing for the Dodgers. Ken Burns 2016 documentary ""Jackie Robinson"" does just that. This is a much more detailed work on the life of Robinson. Yes it does look at his career in baseball and the hardships he went through trying to integrate the sport. There are a few scenes and interviews in this film that originally appeared in the 1994 Baseball documentary. But with the story here just about Jackie they could go more into details on what took place during his ten years career in the majors.

But where the film shines is looking at and telling about his life before baseball and after. Starting with his life as a young boy growing up in Georgia to going to collage at UCLA where he would letter in four sports while there, baseball, football, basketball and track. You even get to see some newsreels of Jackie playing football while at UCLA. It then covers his time serving in the Army during the second world war. It includes how he was court-martialed for refusing to give up his seat on a bus to a white person only to later be honorably discharged from the service. From there it tells about his time with baseball with the last part of the four hour film looking at his later life outside of baseball and his part in the civil rights movement and up to his death at the age of 53.

There is one more part to the story about Robinson and that is his wife Rachel. She appears throughout this talking about these important moments in Jackie's life and her part in helping him and supporting him. You soon realize that the story about Jackie Robinson is incomplete without including Rachel in it. The things that Jackie faced in his life whether it was inside or outside of baseball he could not have done without Rachel by his side. They were more then a married couple, they were a team. So this documentary is as much her story as it is her late husbands.

This is an important documentary to watch. You don't have to be a baseball fan or even like sports to be able to watch this. This is a celebration of the life of an important American who helped to make the American Dream come true for all Americans. Not just a select few. Long before the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950's Jackie was standing up to racial inequality. As a result Robinson is an important figure in American history and not just as an athlete. And Ken Burns documentary on the life of Jackie Robinson does an outstanding job of telling about the man and his legacy.",1460937600,4,3640,4.396142433234421
7599591,4,B01AEOM79S,"I loved that he started out as an angry young man with a very strong personality and with the help of his wife and manager learn to channel all that into baseball and helping the world be a better place. I wish they could have gotten more  old interviews from more of the players , instead of some of the talking heads they had on there talking about statistics. Some of his fans talking about how he inspired them to do better were cool. His feisty  93 year old widow was very much apart of this and is a delight whenever she speaks or is just sitting there with her mischievous sparkly eyes and smile. The jazz that plays all through this special is also  a plus.",1460592000,4,665,4.2204724409448815

Though the four hour documentary on baseball legend Jackie Robinson co-produced and directed by Ken Burns, along with his daughter Sarah and son-in-law David McMahon aired on PBS, this is a review of the Bluray home video version, which was sent to me in advance for an objective review. Because so much is crammed into the four hours  shown as two two-hour programs over two consecutive nights, I think its easier to watch the BD or DVD since it can give you a break. And there are some nice bonus features. I see - as I post this - that Amazon only lists a DVD version as  playable in the US - the BD they list will NOT play on US players and says :""Playback Region B/2 :This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications here -, but there is BD one too!)

Yes, Robinson was part of every chapter in Burns 1994, nine-part, 18-hour, PBS documentary Baseball,  Robinsons widow Rachel knew there was more tell and hounded Burns to make a film about her late husband that went beyond baseball. After all, Robinson left the playing field in 1956 but lived until 1972, when he died of a heart attack at age 53. When Burns and his daughter and son-in-law finished their much-shorter film  The Central Park Five, he reached back to Rachel  now 93-years old and looking youthful in this film  who provided the filmmakers with personal photos and film clips to use.  Though they got new interviews with baseball greats Don Newcomb, Carl Erskine and Willie Mays, they used some interview clips from the Baseball documentary. There are a bunch of new interviews by writers and historians and folks you wouldnt expect, like singer Carly Simon. (Yes, there is a connection with the Robinsons but I won't reveal it here.). Throughout the four hours, we see that Rachel was as much a part of Robinsons career as baseball was. They were a team of two. This is brought to light even more with brief interview clips with President Barack Obama and the First Lady, Michelle, showing the parallel of a strong partnership in marriage with the Robinsons. We hear from two of Robinsons three children. (Youll learn about why Jackie Jr. is not in the film when you watch it.)

The film can be divided into three parts. The first hour is about Robinsons life until he joined the major leagues, going back to his grandfather who was a slave and his father who was a sharecropper. The next two hours focus on his life in baseball. The last hour takes us in to the corporate world (when Robinson was an executive for Chock Full o Nuts coffee and co-founder of Freedom National Bank) and his involvement in the Civil Rights movement and desegregation in the late 1960s. (Years before Rosa Parks refused to move to the back of the bus, Robinson did the same thing while in the U.S. Army!).

The narration is by actor Keith David (who does many of the Burns films) and the words of Robinson himself are read by actor Jamie Foxx. The music throughout nearly all of the four hours is jazz (from the 1920s through the early 1950s. Some are recordings (though 40s jazz accompanies the scenes in the late 1950s and early 60s) and there is an original score by Wynton Marsalis. (Note that a separate soundtrack recording was not made so there is no CD soundtrack release of Marsalis compositions).

The BD (and Im fairly certain) the DVd have numerous bonuses. First is a four-minute featurette on the Anderson Monarchs  the all-black Little League team from Southwest Philadelphia (led by female pitcher Mone Davis) who won the Little League Championship in 2014. Next are 3 sets of interview outtakes focusing on when Erskine, Newcomb and others first met Robinson, comments from his competing players (Willie Mays for one) and on his relationship with Rachel.

Lastly is a 15 minute Conversation with the Filmmakers which provides dome background on the project and is filled with scenes from the film.
If you are a baseball fan, you definitely want to see this (some really rare footage is included) and if you want to see how one man stood firm to make a dent in racial equality in America, youll find that here. And would also learn the true facts about some myths that, until now, surrounded the story of Jackie Robinson

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7599611,5,B01AEOM79S,"This is an absolutely tremendous work by Ken Burns on one of the greatest and most important persons in American history...led off by President Barack Obama himself, a prime beneficiary of Jackie Robinson's life, it tells the story of a man whose impact was felt on and off the baseball field.

The simple truth about Jackie Robinson is that if there had been no Jackie Robinson, there would have been no civil rights movement. At the same time, it is ironic that he is remembered more as a pioneer than as a ballplayer -- he even commented on how he ""never had it made"" and was not remembered for that. I can tell the reader that at least one baseball fan remembered Jackie as a ballplayer...my grandfather.

I asked Grandpa in 1973 what he thought about Jackie Robinson, being a New York/San Francisco Giants and New York Yankees fan, and a Jewish guy from Upper Manhattan. Grandpa replied that he knew that because of World War II, blacks would be making it into major league baseball soon, and the question was ""which player."" Grandpa watched the Negro Leagues, and figured it would be the talented Monte Irvin, hopefully with the Giants. But Irvin lost some of his best years to World War II, and Grandpa only heard of Jackie Robinson as a UCLA football star, not a baseball player.

Grandpa was pleased that Jackie was signed, but puzzled by who he was. Grandpa was, however, enraged, that he went to the hated Brooklyn Dodgers, and then became one of the most annoying such players the Dodgers had, constantly beating up on the Giants, and then hammering the Yankees in the World Series. Grandpa agreed with Yogi Berra -- Jackie was out. So to Grandpa, summing up, Jackie Robinson was less of a pioneer than an extremely talented (and therefore annoying) opposing ballplayer, and that was that. Interesting take.

However, back to matters at hand: Ken Burns is a master historian, documentarian, and filmmaker on American life and society, and this simple two-part film on Jackie Robinson combines this brilliant story with his unique talents. Every American should watch this to gain understanding of Jackie's life, how far we have come, and how far we still have to go. We must reach a time when a white person can look at a black person coming down the street and not quail in fear...where a successful black executive does not face a ""black tax"" at work...and a white person does not have to feel that he or she somehow ""paying"" the price of affirmative action...where we are all equal. I hope we can achieve it. Being a pessimist, I don't think we will.",1480118400,,2565,4.680709534368071

7599613,5,B01AEOM79S,"Jackie Robinson was the moral leader of my generation in addition to being one hell of a ball player. Ken Burns captures the entire Jackie and, thank heavens, his wonderful Rachel. Everyone, young or old, baseball fan or not, will find this fascinating and hear himself/herself saying, "" My God, this was a truly great baseball player, but much more than that, a very great man whose life and example changed society not just much for the better, but forever.",1477008000,2,459,4.75

We read ""Promises to Keep,"" (please excuse the quotation marks rather than an italicizes title; I'm typing on my iPhone and it doesn't offer that as an option as I type in this box) and the movie was a great supplement to the book.

Jack Roosevelt Robinson has his life Ken Burns-ed to perfection.
A documentary that is both fierce and sentimental, and hopefully told exactly the way Rachel Robinson (and Jackie) wanted.
The portion that truly choked me up the most concerned the deaf man in Brooklyn who became not a baseball fan, but a Robinson fan.

Like so many stories of successful men, the story of his wife Rachel is almost larger than Jackie himself.  The woman behind the man is the strength, wisdom, and solid charachter that insures the story ends successfully.  I loved the way Ken Burns built and played this part of the story.  It was equal in size, if not more so, than the baseball, racial and historical aspects of the film.  I couldn't help thinkinking of the famous McCullough John Adams bigraphy about the building of America and the role of Mr. Adams' wife, Abigail, behind her man, guiding him, managing him and insuring his success.  Certainly, Jackie Robinson brings his strength, comittment, prowess, athleticism and love of the game to the story,  Without Rachel, this colossal story would have had a different ending.
