8084610,5,B000BBOUO0,"this is the best supersross dvd to date . it has everything from interviews to race highlights . there is a really cool segment about a young unknown entitled the privateer who try's to make the main event with the big boy's . this may be the last chance to see carmichael and mcgrath on the same track so we should savor it . this is the first volume , i hope the other volumes are as good as this one .",1135728000,2,404,3.9390243902439024
