7874730,3,6304609280,"I was hoping that this DVD was something new on ""Killer Storms."" Unfortunately, I was wrong. This DVD is a double feature. One on Tornadoes and the other on Lightning. The Tornado feature is an old early to mid 80's Nova program that aired on TV many times. Howard Bluestien and other stormchasers try to guess were the next tornado will form so they can deploy the first ""TOTO"". The footage is not bad, but it is old and alot of the information is outdated. The Lightning feature is just about as good (or bad) as the Tornado feature. This is why only 3 stars. If you don't mind old footage or you collect Nova Programs, this DVD is for you. Otherwise, checkout National Geographic's Nature's Fury. It is much better!",1017792000,5,718,4.488549618320611
