1740302,5,B00006AVRK,"The only annoying thing about these DVD's is the fact that several key characters are portrayed by different actors in subsequent seasons.  Fortunately, Jeeves and wooster remain constant, and they of course are the selling point.  You just have to get used to the aunts, cousins and wacky friends changing actors and it is manageable once you get used to the idea and roll with it.  Every episode is hilarious and the setting and ambiance are fantastic.  I like the music too.  You will definitely get your moneys worth, even if you are new to Jeeves and Wooster.  The P.G Wodehouse books about the same pair are fantastic and should be read to more fully enjoy the shows.  If you are into Brit comedy ""Fawlty Towers"" with John Cleese is great too.  But I digress.  This DVD set is great, with no useless and annoying frills, just a heaping helping of hilarity.",1055548800,25,862,4.618421052631579
1740303,5,B00006AVRK,"There are not a lot of glowing words I say about this DVD collection that haven't already been said, but I will try.  Having read numerous books about the characters of Jeeves and Wooster, and listened to BBC radio collection performances, I have to say all the characters seem to hit the mark in bringing P G Wodehouse's creations to the screen.  I have laughed a lot watching the amazing Bertie Wooster botch well-meant attempts to help(?) his friends.  Mr Laurie and Mr Fry really do all they can to bring out the humor and wisdom of the stories.  The other characters, both the recurring ones and the infrequently appearing ones, are also spot on with their roles.  The twins, Claude and Eustace, had me rolling on the floor with their relentless pursuit of the singer.  If you enjoy P.G. Wodehouse's stories, you will truly enjoy these DVD's.  I know I will watch them over and over, as I have listened to BBC tapes I bought in the 1980's.  Two very good comedic actors put their marks on some excellent Jeeves and Wooster stories.  I only wish there were more of them in the series to watch.",1052611200,19,1097,4.527918781725888
1740304,5,B00006AVRK,"My husband is British and we both loved these guys in Blackadder, so when we saw this set available he recommended I get it (he'd seen the original broadcasts of it).  Well, between the time I ordered and the time we watched the first one, he hyped it so much as ""hysterical"" and so on, that I was rather disappointed in the first show.  It was ""interesting"" and ""amusing"" but I would not have called it ""hysterical.""  There were a few funny jokes but otherwise just an interesting show to watch.
However, as we went on watching them, I got more in tune with it, and by Episode 5 I was loving it.  Bertie and Jeeves both use such wonderful hat words and Bertie does use the most alarmingly British phrases!  So, I'm looking forward to the rest of it.  Perhaps they were merely getting into stride in the first few shows.
The one drawback to this is that the actors changed every once in a while.  There was a character named Madeleine Basset and she was played by three different actresses over the course of this series.  There are other characters who were treated similarly; Gussie Fink-Nottle is played by 2 different guys (sadly) and J. Washburn Stoker was played by a couple of different guys too.  But the stories are worth it, as long as you don't get too caught up in this.  I spent a lot of time when they introduced new actors or actresses trying to figure out who they were playing, and then when I found out it was an actor change, spent a lot of time griping about it.  But since I had it on DVD I was able to go back and watch it from the beginning after this was all clear in my head.",1048377600,,1600,4.264900662251655
1740305,5,B00006AVRK,"P.G. Wodehouse wrote funny stories. Obscenely hilarious comedy stories about dim young aristocrats, overbearing aunts and very clever servants.

And of all his creations, the most memorable is the ill-fated and blue-blooded Bertie Wooster and his megabrained valet Jeeves, immortalized by Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry. ""The Complete Jeeves & Wooster"" brings together all their madcap, bizarre little adventures in England's upper echelongs, with many a disastrous engagement and stint in prison.

Bertie Wooster (Laurie) is in need of a valet, and after a wild night out, the low-key, brainy manservant Jeeves (Fry) is sent by an agency to deal with Bertie's everyday needs.

But Jeeves doesn't just fold Bertie's hankies and give him hangover tonics -- he keeps Bertie out of all kinds of trouble. Predatory young beauties, ditzy idiot pals of Bertie's, and domineering aunts trying to marry him off, Bertie is always in hot water -- and Jeeves always is on hand, with a plot cooking in his impressive brain, to haul his hapless employer out.

""The Complete Jeeves and Wooster"" is quite faithful to Wodehouse's original stories -- some stories are combined and others are separated, but they draw heavily on his kooky, bizarro prose. Lots of overbearing old aunts, exploding safes, Neo-Nazis, a constant merry-go-round of oft-broken engagements, eccentric hobbies (newts!), and young women ranging from horribly hearty to airy-fairy.

The only problem is that the stories set in New York just don't have that delicious British flavour that the rest of the series does, although they're still quite funny (Bertie being chased by a berserk cop dressed in a harem outfit). That, and the cast changes continuously.

But those small flaws don't keep the series from being hilarious, from start to finish. Every plot is a hopeless tangle of infatuations, mixups, blackmail, little books of mockery, and stolen policemen's helmets -- and yet somehow Jeeves manages to untangle it by the end. And Wodehouse's dialogue is handled in a brilliant manner (""Because he is a butterfly, who toys with women's hearts and throws them away like soiled gloves!"" ""Do butterflies do that?"").

Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are perfectly cast as the endearing bumbler Bertie Woosterand the dryly witty Jeeves. Though Bertie's lack of clothing sense (and a trombone) often annoys Jeeves, the brainy valet clearly does have affection for Bertie, and Bertie appreciates Jeeves' ability to save him from fates worse than death (such as marriage to the horribly hearty Honoria or the wispy, fairy-loving dimbulb Madeleine).

""The Complete Jeeves and Wooster"" is a simply brilliant stretch of what-ho-what-ho comedy (""You can't be a successful dictator AND design women's underclothing"") and deliciously twisting storylines. Not to be missed. Ever.",1042588800,298,2818,5.302690582959642
1740306,5,B00006AVRK,"These discs are worth the price. You 'll get the full flavor of  P.G. Wodehouse's great books by watching these wonderful stories again and again. With the bumbling dim witted Wooster and his quick witted valet Jeeves they go from one pratfall to another.
Each story is full of great characters and fun from beginning to end. So join Barmey, Stinker Pinker, and Tuppy as they, along with Balmey and Stiffy, help poor Berty with the problems of life. Pip Pip and Cherrio.",1038960000,6,470,4.662650602409639
1740307,4,B00006AVRK,"The first two seasons are the truest to Wodehouse's style.  The plots and dialogue come directly from the Wodehouse stories.
The following seasons take quite a bit of poetic license but are still fun to watch.
There's some substituting of  supporting characters (for instance, Stiffy Byng instead of Catsmeat's sister Corky) so folks won't get confused trying to keep up with all the names (it doesn't detract from the story).  Many minor and some major characters are left out to simplify the plots; and for some reason Sir Roderick Glossop is given a wife, which he never had in the books.
Still, taken all in all, not a bad way to spend an evening.  Oh, and the music is terrific :-).",1029110400,19,687,4.652892561983471
1740308,5,B00006AVRK,"On the surface this is a series of stories about a bumbling upper class British bachelor who is rescued from social predicaments by his valet.  The story is set in the inner war years.  There are frequently seemingly unrelated subplots that come together at the last minute to effect the rescue.
 Underneath is a satire of the foibles of human nature.  The characters are exaggerated archetypes.  They are played by people who are cast to match the character and give the impression that they are snickering under their breath as the play the part to the hilt.  I suspect that rehearsals were a riot.
The only problem is that the series was filmed over four years and the players for some parts changed. In general, I prefer the first person to play each part and I get the ""Who is that imposter pretending to be person X?"" reaction to the new players.",1028937600,14,852,4.572368421052632

1740326,1,B00006AVRK,"You would have to be the product of an English boarding school to appreciate these silly stories. It would be acceptable to say they are very English and true to that peculiar paradigm they are, predictably in my opinion at least, complete nonsense. Bertie is a spineless wimp, most of his friends parasites and his female relations clearly illustrative of a peculiar form of gender metamorphosis. In fact, for me , the women in these stories are my biggest gripe, I simply cannot tolerate overbearing women, not at any price. I don't think Wodehouse comes up with a single example of the pretty, feminine, gentle type of woman in all his writing, but then there probably aren't that many examples of the type, to fire the imagination in the UK.

The whole things well enough acted I suppose if you rate acting as a life skill, the sets are good and the musical soundtrack bang on, but that's not enough to carry it through for me. In fact the music does more to set the mood of the the twenties than the acting. Silly stories about boy scouts and errant uncles, bossy girl friends who offer marriage as a form of negotiating point, and aunts who should be given up for rendering, are just not funny, well not for me anyway.

Buy this if you really must but don't say I didn't warn you .",1485820800,,1287,4.472340425531915

I grew up with Jeeves and Wooster (watching many live stage productions) and Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are stellar in this series.  We watch episodes again and again.  Wooster is a wealthy upper crust and privileged individual who has no need to work. He also prefers to stay a bachelor.  He has the means to employ his own valet.  Enter the magnificent Jeeves!  Jeeves is extraordinarily bright, highly educated and clearly enjoys making the most of the (often times) sheer stupidity of his employer.  Jeeves also has a good time creating situations  for the pure entertainment value of it all.  High jinx abound and this series is huge fun and down right very clever.  100% all around!!!

1740401,5,B00006AVRK,"This is one of those productions that takes on quite a bit and brings it off rather well. I remember watching these years ago, some of the later seasons I think, and thoroughly enjoying them week by week. There are always some differences from the books, but nothing terminally detracting with these.  One notices they do have Jeeves taking a great deal more latitude here, thus juicing up the action, may have been the thought.  But, again, they took on a lot in bringing the tone, timing, personalities, happenings, locations and so forth together. Many have been introduced to the characters through these broadcasts and have discovered Wodehouse in printed form as a result.

The title characters are good, Aunt Agatha more ladylike than I pictured, but effective. I saw more of a shrill, less attractive creature. Aunt Dahlia pleased.  The hapless coves who served as friends did their bits well enough. Mr. & Mrs. Glossop were, again, more attractive than pictured, but the indignation gratified well enough. Dear Honoria was also more tame and attractive than pictured in reading, that being a larger, more raw-boned, less refined termagant. But, while individual mind's eyes may vary, I think most would agree that they were overall right ho.  Bottom line, these were a lot of fun.",1428364800,,1289,4.976744186046512

1740515,3,B00006AVRK,"P G Wodehouse is considered one of the great comic writers of the 20th century. Watching these adaptations of his Jeeves novels makes you wonder on what his popularity is based. They just aren't that funny.

I browsed several of the original stories. The scripts are well-adapted by Clive Exton, and often borrow large chunks of dialog. The direction and production values are first-rate, close to theatrical quality. But what's amusing on paper seems rather tedious on the screen. The problem might be that Wooster narrates the stories, giving them some immediacy and vitality, whereas the video Wooster is a largely reactive character who rarely initiates any action. Stephen Fry -- another fine comic actor -- is similarly saddled with a character whose raison d'etre is to react, rather than act. It doesn't help that neither the stories nor the TV show takes a hard jab at the empty lives of the wealthy idiots it chronicles. The satire seems to be implied, rather than explicit.

The one thing worth seeing is Hugh Laurie's performance. Wooster's face is in constant motion, and Laurie shifts from expression to expression as rapidly as an electron jumps quantum levels.

The complaint that the video transfer isn't so good seems plausible. The first two disks look as if everything was shot through a light fog filter. I assumed this was intended to suggest a bygone era, but it later disappeared.

It appears I've been spoiled by ""Frasier"" and ""The Black Adder"". ""Jeeves and Wooster"" just isn't my cuppa tea.",1399680000,3,1516,4.956692913385827

1740530,2,B00006AVRK,"If you live in Australia, and regional countries, I advise
everyone NOT TO BUY THIS PRODUCT. The DVD has a regional code
restriction placed on it; which means that DVD players in the
above regions will not be able to play the DVD; any attempt to
do so will generate a Region error quiery, and ejects the DVD.

What is most frustrating is that Amazon.com does not indicate
anywhere this limitation; nor is it indicated on the DVD box
nor on the DVD's themselves. What is interesting is that Amazon.co.uk
does inform one of the regional limitation of the product even though
one has to search through the 'more info' link on the page. Moreover,
the product at the UK branch of Amazon has a different package to
that for sale in the US Branch of Amazon, therefore it is not unresonable for
a consumer to assume that the US version was not region restricted by
virtue of its lack of information regarding such.

Finally, Amazon's return policy states that the package may be returned
if it is unopened. Sadly, one has to open the package in order to view
details on the DVD and even to play the DVD. Therefore, one is stuck
with the product.

All is not lost, however. If your Computer has a DVD player and you
run a late version of Windows with a late version of VLC Media Player
installed, then you can watch the DVD without problem; I don't know
about Apple Computers. It is also possible to link the computer output

1740610,4,B00006AVRK,"Lets get this out in front. These stories, as written by Wodehouse, and as realized by these actors, is caricature. If you want a somewhat more realistic picture of English upper classes before WW II, see Brideshead Revisited (the 10 hour series, not the movie).

As caricature, even if stretched over four different plots, can become just a bit tedious. That is why I deduct one star. You do not get the kind of freshness we see in the best films from The Marx Brothers, where they are intent on breaking conventions, rather than suffering from them.

Having gotten that out of the way, there is no question that Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie are masters of parody. They push Wodehouse's characterizations to the hilt. Our only disappointment is that the sword is rather short. Of the two lead actors, Hugh Laurie gets by far the more flexible role. There are far more ways to be stupid than there are to be smart, and Jeeves is very smart, far brighter than his master, to whom he is a valet. Both actors get some chances to do cross gender roles, which were so common in their ""A Bit of Fry and Wooster."" But once you see Jeeves' demeanor in one episode, you basically have him down pat. If you delight in a freer interaction between these two comedy geniuses, check out the complete set of ""A Bit of Fry and Laurie"", where, oddly, they look older than their roles in the later ""Jeeves and Wooster.""

I have never read any of Wodehouse's Jeeves novels, so I am not sure how thoroughly they have captured his humor. My last thought of any substance is that I find drama, especially detective stories far more re-watchable than comedy (except perhaps for the Marx Brothers), maybe because plots have more substance and there is usually some danger involved. Shakespeare knew all about that. All his best comedies had an element of threat or danger to one or more characters. There is none of that here. All is sweetness and light except for some artificial crises, which mean very little in the grand scheme of things.

A good practice when you have bought this set is to watch one disk, then let the set lay fallow for a few weeks before you go on to the second disk. There is very little carry over from one to the other. It seems as if the three or four episodes on each disk were based on one of Wodehouse's novels, since the setting and characters run through all the episodes on the disk.",1381104000,,2393,4.494252873563219

1740627,5,B00006AVRK,"From Monty Python to Fawlty Towers, the list of great British Comedy series has to include Jeeves and Wooster.  I happen to favor it over the other two because it relies less on slapstick and more on dry wit.  It keeps me laughing even as I re visit it for the umpteenth time.  Maybe it's the period displayed and the mores of the time, the upper class pretentions of the British aristocracy of the twenties and thirties and the comeuppance delivered by the valet that makes it so delightfully amusing.  There is a similar piece of comedy in the series ""The Irish RM"" with the ""simple"" Irish folk leading around the British Resident Magistrate unaware of how he's being played.

That said this series is fabulous and ranks among my favorites because it is so  well acted and wonderfully written and it captures a time period and a social milieu that is skewered to great effect in the PG Wodehouse novels on which it is based perfectly. Basically for the uninitiated, Jeeves is a remarkably clever and understated Gentlemen's gentlemen in the employ of Bertie Wooster who embodies the young leisured class. A young man with money  and endless time on his hands played brilliantly by Laurie.

1740693,4,B00006AVRK,"All you need to enjoy this is a love of wordplay and a taste for involuted plots stitched around the dull opulence of Britain's idle rich.

Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are perfectly cast. Laurie's Bertie Wooster is dim but vigorous and good-hearted, while Fry's real-life erudition reflects well in the knowing and subtle mastermind valet. Writer Clive Exton's adaptations of Wodehouse make a winning formula out of Bertie's inadvertent betrothals, scheming amongst family and colleagues, and endlessly plumbable nonsense from the upper-class twits filling Bertie's beloved Drones Club bachelor's retreat in London. High points include a banjo orchestra run afoul of a local holiday, England's would-be Duce, and a surprisingly moving pastoral homage to Ralph Vaughan Williams.

As these things go, Jeeves & Wooster suffers a gradual loss of focus on repartee and narrative in the third season, then a sharp dropoff from the start of its fourth and last. In spite of the same writer and actors, and carryover director from Season 3, it's as if they simply ran out of Wodehouse.

1740709,5,B00006AVRK,"I have not read any P.G. Wodehouse novels/stories yet, but I can safely say that this series is superb by itself. Hugh Laurie is great as the pleasant but flawed and bumbling Bertie Wooster and Stephen Fry is downright genius as Jeeves. Both use facial expressions with as much tact and timing as the spoken words (you'll soon grow fond of Bertie's hopelessly clueless ""bug eyes"" and Jeeves' silent expressions that say a million things). The supporting cast is also very excellent - pay particular attention to Brenda Bruce as the brazenly fussy but hearty Aunt Dahlia and John Turner as the quick-tempered (and absurdly proto-Hitler) Roderick Spode, who is hilarious in every single scene they squeezed him into.

Interesting point to quickly mention here: I believe these show would qualify as family-friendly viewing (assuming your family has the attention span for this brand of humor...my 5-year-old niece just liked Hugh Laurie banging away on the piano!). There is occasional comical swearing, but no violence for the sake of violence, nudity or sexuality (and so there shouldn't be since these stories were originally meant to be just that: entertaining stories!). Those who were turned off by Stephen Fry's extroverted, leave-nothing-to-the-imagination portrayal of Oscar Wilde several years ago will find this show pleasantly clean and Fry's acting turn here subtle and gentle.

There is a good mixture here of satire, political humor, physical comedy, farce, and just general silliness. Each element is in equal balance, so it won't ever feel like you're just watching a ""Three Stooges"" marathon. The costumes, sets, and scenery are all gorgeous and meticulous. Architecture fans will have a lot to peruse since episodes are frequently set inside lovely old manors or castles. I personally enjoy a good historical fiction for the visuals but dislike idle melodrama, so this series is a natural fit. Some reviewers here don't like the music and think it is repetitive. I don't argue with the repetition claim, but I think it suits the nature of the series. A fun bonus of this show is Hugh Laurie's frequent on-camera piano playing and singing, generally of very silly songs of the 1920s-1930s. Laurie has been noted for his musical ability before, but it looks like he was genuinely enjoying himself here.

As to the accuracy to Wodehouse's novels, I cannot vouch for them. I have been told that many of the original stories were altered or combined and certain details changed or left out in this series. Unless you're a strict purist, I wouldn't worry too much about all that. The fact is that these have a good spirit about them and they are strong enough as their own separate entities rather than supplemental ""visual aids"" to the written stories. Every episode is entertaining in some way and stands up to multiple viewings (great for aimless weekends, as stress relievers, or just a way to unwind). Those of you who know a bit about early 20th-century history and culture will find that knowledge helpful in appreciating the humor, but you don't absolutely have to be a history buff to enjoy it.

I do not have this specific DVD set, but I will say that the DVD versions I've seen out there are not that much better quality than the VHS version. If you have a VCR and do not have this set on DVD yet, you may want to pick up gently-used tape versions first if it's cheaper.

This show is both refreshing and heartwarming. It's true that these would be more helpful if they had subtitles, but since I watch a fair amount of British TV, the accents don't bother me personally most of the time (want a REALLY cryptic show? Try ""Killinaskully""!!).",1357603200,,3662,4.890499194847021

Teamed with Stephen Fry's stoic Jeeves you have a comedy duo never bested. Wodehouse was ahead of his time, parodying the upper classes in the way that the Monty Python crew picked up on 50 years later. The script is so funny that you will want to watch these over and over. I have owned this set since they came out on VHS and have just upgraded to DVD. These tales never get old and would seem fresh to new viewers if shown on TV today.

1740779,5,B00006AVRK,"Whenever I'm down in the dumps, one of the things I can usually rely on to put me in a better mood is ""Jeeves and Wooster"".  I don't know what it is, but there's something about this show that gives me a warm, cheerful, navely optimistic outlook on life -- the sort of outlook that Bertie Wooster seems to have, at least in those rare moments when, with a little help from Jeeves, he manages to escape being bullied, blackmailed, or betrothed.

In case you're not already familiar with ""Jeeves and Wooster"", it is a British TV show that originally ran from 1990-93 on ITV, and also aired in the U.S. as part of the PBS series ""Masterpiece Theatre"".  The show is based on the Jeeves stories of author P.G. Wodehouse; and it stars the fabulous comedy duo of Fry and Laurie in the title roles.

Set in England (and a few episodes in New York) in the 1920s, the show recounts the misadventures of Bertram Wilberforce ""Bertie"" Wooster (Hugh Laurie) and his devoted manservant Reginald Jeeves (Stephen Fry).  Bertie and his friends and relatives seem to have a knack for getting themselves into trouble; and they usually have to rely on Jeeves to get them out of it.  Bertie Wooster is a hapless, yet loveable, upper-class twit, who just wants to enjoy a carefree life.  Unfortunately, his kind heart, dim wit, and total lack of backbone make it impossible for him to avoid getting caught up in other people's drama, which he usually ends up making worse.  Fortunately for him, he has Jeeves.  With his stoical unflappability, his erudite wisdom, and his encyclopedic knowledge of even the most obscure bits of factual information, Jeeves is the man you want by your side in any crisis.  And, since Wooster's life seems to be one crisis after another, he is very lucky to have Jeeves as his ""gentleman's personal gentleman"".  The always-proper, always-dignified, always-faithful Jeeves can be counted on to do what's best for his master, even in the most absurd of situations.

Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse (1881-1975) wrote nearly 100 books -- including full-length novels and collections of short stories -- many of which recounted humorous tales about members of the British aristocracy and gentry during the early 20th century, with many of his characters appearing in multiple stories.  His most famous stories were the ones about a clever valet named Jeeves who was constantly having to find ways to get his master, a wealthy loafer named Bertie Wooster, out of trouble.  But characters from the Jeeves stories also appeared in many of Wodehouse's other books.  He basically created an entire fictional universe of wacky characters, all of whom seemed to be connected to each other in some way, allowing him to write stories that could feature just about any combination of those characters.  But his most popular characters, by far, were Jeeves and Wooster.  This series is a pretty faithful adaptation of several of Wodehouse's Jeeves stories for television.  The stories were dramatized for television by the late Clive Exton (1930-2007), the same brilliant screenwriter who was responsible for dramatizing 31 of Agatha Christie's stories for the wonderful ITV television series ""Poirot"".

The humor in ""Jeeves and Wooster"" is a cross between a comedy of manners and a farce.  It caricatures the members of the British upper classes (especially the younger members) as eccentric, not very bright, out of touch with the real world, self-absorbed, spoiled, lazy, petulant, scheming, amoral, uncultured, bumbling, foolish, and almost totally dependant on their servants -- who are invariably portrayed as smarter, wiser, and classier than their masters -- to insure that they maintain the proper standards of decorum for people of their social standing.  But most of the humor comes from the wacky schemes that these upper-class halfwits come up with in order to accomplish their selfish goals, which invariably get them into trouble.  And, try as he might to avoid it, Bertie Wooster always seems to get caught right in the middle of all this trouble, and has to rely on Jeeves to get him out.  Fortunately, Jeeves is so clever that he can almost always figure out a way to resolve the problem; though the resolution often comes at the expense of Bertie's pride and dignity.

Anyway, this is a great show; and I highly recommend it.  Fry and Laurie are brilliant in it, as they are in everything they are in, especially when they work together.  There are 23 episodes in all, over four seasons (5 episodes in the first season, 6 episodes in each of the remaining seasons).  The only complaint I have is that most of the secondary characters who appear in more than one season are not played by the same actor throughout all four seasons.  You get used to seeing one actor in a particular role, and then in the next season a different actor might be playing that role.  It can be quite jarring.  But that's my only complaint.  It's a wonderful show, with lots of clever humor and witty dialogue, fun characters, and even some really good music (if you like the music of the Jazz Age as much as I do).  Get it and watch it.  You won't regret it.

I don't want to give away any spoilers -- it's better for new viewers to discover all the fun things about this show first hand by actually watching for themselves rather than reading about them in a review -- but I do want to pass along one little tidbit of knowledge that might enhance your appreciation of certain aspects of the show.  It has to do with money.  Because many of the characters in this show are quite wealthy, money is mentioned a lot throughout the series.  But, since these stories are set in Britain in the 1920s, American viewers today might not have a clue what sort of sums are being discussed.  For example, when a judge fines Bertie 5, or when someone asks to borrow 10 from Bertie to pay for drinks at a bar, these sound to us like fairly trivial amounts.  But, actually, that was quite a lot of money back then.  Five pounds sterling in 1925 would be roughly equivalent to $300 in today's money; and 10 then would be worth about $600 now.  So, whenever you hear characters talking about sums of money in British pounds (""quid""), multiply that amount by 60 and you'll get a rough approximation of how much they're talking about in today's American dollars.  For amounts less than 1, which are measured in shillings (""bob"") and pence (where 1 shilling = 12 pence, and 1 pound = 20 shillings = 240 pence) just keep in mind that one shilling in 1925 would be roughly equivalent to $3 today, and one British penny back then would have about the same value as an American quarter does today.  When they are talking about American currency (e.g. in the episodes set in New York), just multiply everything by 13 to get a very rough estimate of what it would be worth in today's dollars (e.g. $1 then = about $13 now).  Understanding this will help you better appreciate the obscene amounts of money that are routinely tossed around by the wealthy characters in these stories, such as when Bertie bets 100 on a race.

So, now that you have this little bit of knowledge to aid in your enjoyment, you're ready to begin your fun adventure with ""Jeeves and Wooster"".  Trust me, you'll love every minute of it.  And, if you're in a bad mood, it just might cheer you up.",1333411200,20,7331,4.713725490196079

1740783,5,B00006AVRK,"One long, dark, ill Winter of Discontent, I spent months reading leather-bound, gilded old volumes of English lit classics, unearthed from a practically private, peculiar library. While snow fell in subzero cold, accumulating in indomitable drifts along the walls of my cottage in the crags, I huddled indoors, delving into Thackeray, George Elliot, Austin, Galsworthy's voluminous Forsythe Saga, lost Bronts, and a lone American: dark Edith Wharton's and her granite winter of Ethan Frome. Several, newish collections stood out from this dolorous lot. They turned out to be the jolly works of P.G. Wodehouse, his chuckle-out-loud romps. Wodehouse's corpulent country pigs were creatures to be admired, they remain vast and mired in my memory.

But for the unnecessary focus on plumping in the last episode, and an unfortunate change in the casting of his Aunt Dahlia, this DVD set is pure delight, better than I remembered when it first played on PBS. Oh, that all men could have A Man to organize their messy lives with the suave effectiveness of Stephen Fry's Jeeves. If only I cold maintain such an unflusterable countenance.

Don't worry about British Pounds and Dollars, they will take care of all of that for you and delivery works just fine. Why do this?

Hugh Laurie is superb as the eccentric (if he weren't rich they'd call him mad) Bertie Wooster, a rich layabout from a wealthy family full of maiden aunts who seem to be determined to marry him off. Stephen Fry is of course the unflappable and ingenious valet Jeeves, who can always be counted on to come up with a plan to save the day, even if he doesn't always tell Bertie about it until its all over.

Well, as has been said repeatedly in past reviews Hugh Laurie is the perfect Bertie and Stephen Fry is wonderful as Jeeves. About the only minor niggling I can think of is that Fry doesn't quite have the ability to ""glide"" into the room like Wodehouse's Jeeves but that, however, is such a tiny critisizm I retract it immediately.

1740821,5,B00006AVRK,"After reading all the Wodehouse tales when I was younger I was sure any film version of Jeeves would be pale in comparison. Stephen Fry proves me wrong, again and again. The comic genius of Fry and Laurie actually makes the TV episodes better than the printed word.  The sets are lavishly convincing and seem very BBC rather than A&E (which I think made the series). Anyhow, each episode is a complete story in itself but the entire series definitely tells a larger tale. There are 3 or 4 episodes on each disk and it's hard to watch just one at a sitting.

The shows are not exactly like the books in many ways. The Jeeves in the the books keeps control over Bertie so that nothing shakes up his orderly existence. In the TV shows he seems to have a more altruistic reason for keeping Bertie out of random trouble and marriages-- for Bertie's own happiness. Also, characters like Aunt Agatha (the ""Nephew Crusher"") trust Jeeves' influence in the shows which was definitely not the case in the books.

Anyhow, these are great stories and very well made. If you're in the mood for some good laughs and some architectural eye-candy give these a shows a look.",1300752000,,1156,4.548076923076923

I really can't say anything others haven't said earlier (and better!) so I'll stick with saying that this boxed set made a wrenching time in my life a little more bearable.

I have only two caveats:

1) laughing that hard while recovering from surgery can be surprisingly painful.

2) watching the whole series in a long marathon can be a little confusing; many important characters are played one season by one actor, and the next by a completely different actor.

The acting chemistry between Laurie and Fry is very evident in this series but it's not surprising since they have had a comic partnership starting years before the J&W series (check out the series ""A Bit of Fry & Laurie"" on DVD as well as their appearances on other shows such as ""Blackadder"" and ""Alfresco""). Laurie's character of ""Bertie Wooster"" is the polar opposite of his current character, Dr. Gregory House, on ""House."" Whereas Gregory House is a overly-cynical, and jaded medical genius, ""Bertie Wooster"" is a semi-naive, upper class twit who is rescued from various misadventures by his always immaculate valet, Jeeves (played by Stephen Fry).

1740901,5,B00006AVRK,"I have tried a number of times to get into this author's work because my friends have recommended his work for years.  Wit, hilarity, irony are frequent words tossed about in reference to his work.  On every prior effort I've failed to ""get it"".  I finally got it in two formats to break this impasse, if indeed it was breakable.  First, I got the audio version of JEEVES & WOOSTER, narrated by Martin Jarvis.  Then I watched the Video version with Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry.  I am happy to report that I finally ""get"" the humor and fun which readers of Wodehouse have long enjoyed.  If you too have had trouble getting into the wit behind the work, I suggest you do the same.

The stories revolve around a well connected English gentleman, Bertie Wooster, who is as idle as can be. There are lords and ladies in his family.  He did go to Eton and Oxford and now belongs to all the right clubs.  However, the way he behaves, is the way most men of his class behaved in England back in his day, when automobiles were first coming out.  You do see Bertie tooling about in his roadster.  Bertie is played by Hugh Laurie. This character couldn't be any more different from Doctor Gregory House, especially since Bertie could not figure his way around his own breakfast, much less diagnose someone in dire distress. Bertie is funny but you are most definitely laughing at Bertie, not with him. Hugh Laurie is superb. His is the harder role as he has to come across as likable but not having much but air between his ears.

Jeeves is as opposite from Bertie as can be.  Jeeves is of the working class, Bertie's valet.  He is suave, intelligent, well read, shrewd and manipulative.  Also, he is always calm and collected, never losing his cool.  Stephen Fry plays him to perfection but it is a one note performance.  In each and every episode, it is Jeeves who rescues Bertie, his friends or his family members after they have gotten themselves (always) into some ferocious mess of their own making. Just with picking out potential marital partners, they are all utter disasters.

A big part of my problem with Wodehouse and J&W was simply being American.  In this same era in America, a well born, well educated man like Bertie would be considered a sluggard for accomplishing nothing. That he could go to (by comparison) Andover and Yale, after being born into a prominent American family, yet be such an idiot that his valet had to do his thinking for him, would not be the making of an American satire!  That Bertie and all his friends regard any form of work as beyond the pale is also about as un American a concept as there could be. This classic of wit and satire could only come from England since it revolves around the concept and conceit of the idle English gentleman in that era.

1740902,5,B00006AVRK,"This series is worth pure gold galore. It is British and that means the actors are absolutely excellent, the settings and the production are extremely fine and rich. The details are not neglected and that is a real pleasure. The best part is of course the work on the language, the speech patterns, and you can imagine the pleasure they take when the two characters move to New York. The contrast between the extreme aristocratic tone and intonation, the fascinating politeness of Jeeves, the Valet, and the American secular and even gross way of speaking with no affectation is a bag of diamonds on the screen. The action takes place in the 20s or 30s with some kind of fuzziness as for the time period. We seem to still be in the prohibition era, and at the same time not to be in the post 1929 depression. So we could be in the 1920s. That corresponds to the period Francis Scott Fitzgerald preferred for his rich idle young American men and women coming to Europe to enjoy their idleness in pure carelessness. But here these young aristocrats are constantly taken up in innumerable intrigues that have to do with their century old rivalries and jealousies, or their innumerable love affairs and hormonal capers. The main character is not so much Wooster, the aristocrat, but Jeeves, his valet, because he is the one who constantly builds the intrigues, thickens and even sickens the plots, in many ways manipulates his ""master"" into doing things he would like to do but can't do because he is a valet, a servant, and that would be too risky for him. He is also some kind of guardian angel for his ""master"" saving him quite often from total perdition at the very last minute. He is the champion of all escape makers and escape planners. But this series goes a lot further than that. We cannot say that the social content is that rich and that we could speak of social criticism. It is a comedy and does not intend to become a social drama or a social epic. That humor is English and only the British can produce it. It is both so elaborate and so extreme that it is hilarious from beginning to end. You thus have all the themes you need to really be humorous from a pure English point of view. You have them all, and even more. Old spinsters, old bachelors, plumbers, bobbies, Anglican priests, twins, old aunts and old uncles being fooled by young nieces and nephews, all kinds of grotesque characters, the fools and the crazies of this world, even some good Africans and judges. You cannot miss the all man's club and the impersonation of so many characters that we just wonder at times if we are not back in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. Disguises, transvestites, foolish capers, you name it you have it. The rhythm of these parades is so diabolical that you can hardly follow them, even if they are predictable at times to the very second. But they are too funny for you not to play the game. The only missing character is the desert island and the marooned person there under his coconut tree eating ladyfingers. That is a must for those who like British humor, slightly black, definitely grinding to a crazy downfall, certainly not to a halt. I just wonder if we could not say it is a classic.

1740905,5,B00006AVRK,"If you're either an Anglophile or just an immense fan of the hilarious writings of P.G. Wodehouse (pronounced WOOD'-house), then you should hardly consider passing up this little-known but terrific British television series.

For a long time I wondered how anyone could possibly produce the Jeeves and Wooster tales of Wodehouse (1881-1975) for film or television episodes and make them come off any way near like the great writer intended them. Incredibly, they've done it here! Much of the kudos must go directly to Stephen Fry (Inspector Thompson in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gosford-Park/dp/B00005JKNF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gosford Park</a>) and Hugh Laurie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-Season-One/dp/B001QE99AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House: Season One</a>.) It's almost as if the television series came out first and then Wodehouse expanded the books from the screenplay. These two brilliant characters are very, very good together. This is a British 1990-1993 television series which ended all too soon as far as I'm concerned.

So what's it all about? Well, I can give you the essential formula and assure you that each episode pretty much adapts to this theme (although somehow one never tires of it): Bertie Wooster, a youthful, energetic, and marriage eligible peer of the realm is endlessly the object of amorous (and usually harebrained) English maidens. Bertie himself has a penchant for generating convoluted imbroglios from these prospective affairs and he's always seeking a shrewd way out of his demise -- when he follows his own intuitions, or one put forth by one of his pals from The Drones' Club, the situation worsens every time. But Wooster's personal man, [Reginald] Jeeves, ultimately devises some intricate scheme which, while initially giving rise to chaos, always blossoms nicely in the end for the best of all parties concerned. Jeeves is clearly the most proper and efficient butler/valet/chauffer in England but he's perfectly willing to resort to the most dubious of improprieties and challenges to the local constabulary and/or the aristocracy in order to save the day for his erratic master and his eccentric pals.

Some folks love the subtle, sharp-edged ambiance of British wit and it equally often drives non-fans crazy. Well this is right up there with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monty-Python-and-the-Holy-Grail-Special-Edition/dp/B00005O3VC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monty Python and the Holy Grail (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;for the former group. This stuff is roll-on-the-floor-and-hold-yer-belly fare for those of us who savour such antics as are perpetrated by Wodehouse characters such as Augustus ""Gussie"" Fink-Nottle (Richard Braine) and the Hitler-ish Roderick Spode (John Turner.)

There are twenty-three color episodes in all and they run for 55 minutes each -- there's not a boring three-second span in any of them. They were directed by Ferdinand Fairfax (12 episodes), Simon Langton (6 episodes), and Robert Young. The series is a Granada production, an organization which always puts forth a first-class product.

1740931,5,B00006AVRK,"P.G. Wodehouse's chronicles of Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves have made millions laugh since the 1920s.  Far from being dated, they appeal to every generation that encounters them.  The Granada TV series from the early 1990s, starring Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry, are faithful adaptations which add new sparkle and delight.

Bertie Wooster is a hapless young aristocrat with a large income, no ambitions or formal education to speak of, and an unavoidable predilection for trouble.  Into his life steps Jeeves, a cool, calm, and collected gentleman's gentleman who brings order to chaos within minutes.

Each episode of Jeeves and Wooster has essentially the same plot:  Wooster finds himself in a tight spot, and Jeeves gets him out of it.  Many of these tight spots involve females: Bertie has two aunts, Agatha and Dahlia, both of whom are determined to rein him in and get him under control, while a succession of young women see in him ideal husband material and do their best to get him to the altar.  These putative brides include the absolutely hilarious Honoria Glossop.  Bertie is also beset with a distressingly large number of friends from the Drones Club, and when Jeeves isn't helping his master out of a mess he's often drafted to do so for Gussie Fink-Nottle or some other young wastrel.  But even though the plots repeat themselves, there are always new twists and kinks in the road, so every single episode is worth viewing and reviewing.

Those who know Hugh Laurie only from House are in for a delightful introduction to his silly side, while Stephen Fry is a master of the adroit eyebrow twitch or cautious ahem. You'll laugh all the way through them, and then want to turn around and watch them all over again.",1263686400,,1737,4.814814814814815

The producers have taken some liberties with the story-lines, for the sake of T.V. time constraints.  All the same, these productions satisfy completely.  I wish Hugh Laurie would learn to stop slurping when he talks; but, otherwise, he delivers a perfect Bertie Wooster.  (Maybe Bertie slurped when he talked, too?)  Of course, Stephen Fry was born to play Jeeves, and few living actors could have done so better.  All of the episodes in this set appear to take place in the 1920s, and it astonishes me how the producers re-created that time period on film.  They even dug up some old footage of Times Square in New York for those episodes set on this side of the pond.  (I noticed that some of the stories that Wodehouse set in England got transferred over here, but they still work fine.)  Buy this set if you love silliness.",1259798400,,982,4.591954022988506

1740984,5,B00006AVRK,"This collection of Fry & Laurie in ""Jeeves and Wooster"" is a real treasure. It features a young Stephen Fry (as Jeeves, the ""gentleman's gentleman"") and a positively boyish Hugh Laurie as the feckless Bertie Wooster. The plots retain their Wodehouse silliness, and the ensemble playing of the two stars is breathtakingly clever. This version of the book is regarded as the best ever made, and it is truly wonderful. A bonus is the many opportunities for Hugh Laurie to play the piano; he performs a very funny selection of contemporary songs (the stories take place in England and New York in the 1920s and 1930s).

Wooster is a well-to-do English gentleman. The intelligent and organized Jeeves smoothly arranges all the logistics of Bertie's life, frequently bailing him out of awkward situations. Bertie Wooster is well-meaning, but in many ways rather dim (though he smartens up a bit over the seasons with Jeeves's subtle tutelage). There are many witty moments, many charming moments, and never a dull moment. For me, though, the best gift of this collection is the opportunity to see these two fine actors in their early days work together seamlessly to pull off one of the great British comedies.

Jeeves uses his encyclopedic knowledge on nearly every subject to pull off the most complicated and convoluted plans possible to extricated Bertie from his jams; including Bertie's annoying habit of accidentally getting himself engaged.  All the while Jeeves manages to to set Bertie right in his sly and subtle way when he makes his most aggrievance mistakes, such as buying a white hat or monogrammed handkerchiefs.

Pros:

* Plenty of good performances by the numerous secondary characters.

* Amusing British accents and phrases, making fun of the idle rich, etc.
Cons:
* Color quality on these DVDs is not so good.

1741007,2,B00006AVRK,"The eight discs that clock in at a hefty 1150 minutes of wry British wit that stars Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry is a puzzling (re)release on a pair of critical areas: there is nothing new from the complete series that was issued in 2002 and the transfer to disc remains ""iffy,"" which plagued its initial appearance in the marketplace.

Laurie portrays Bertram Wilberforce ""Bertie"" Wooster - the bumbling, dimwitted aristocrat - and Fry is the witty valet, Reginald Jeeves, in the series that is based on Sir P.G. Wodehouse's ""Jeeves and Wooster"" stories. The 23 episodes appeared on the ITV network from April 1990 to June 1993 and feature bossy aunts, romantic scrapes and a number of friends who just can't stay out of mischief.

Hopefully there are plans for a definitive set and this repackaging of a prior release is a bridge to that end. Though the shows were outstanding, there needs to be a serious production makeover to make for a solid collectible for fans of all ages.",1243555200,189,980,4.7251461988304095
1741008,5,B00006AVRK,"P.G. Wodehouse wrote funny stories. Obscenely hilarious comedy stories about dim young aristocrats, overbearing aunts and very clever servants.

And of all his creations, the most memorable is the ill-fated and blue-blooded Bertie Wooster and his megabrained valet Jeeves, immortalized by Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry. ""The Complete Jeeves & Wooster"" brings together all their madcap, bizarre little adventures in England's upper echelongs, with many a disastrous engagement and stint in prison.

Bertie Wooster (Laurie) is in need of a valet, and after a wild night out, the low-key, brainy manservant Jeeves (Fry) is sent by an agency to deal with Bertie's everyday needs.

But Jeeves doesn't just fold Bertie's hankies and give him hangover tonics -- he keeps Bertie out of all kinds of trouble. Predatory young beauties, ditzy idiot pals of Bertie's, and domineering aunts trying to marry him off, Bertie is always in hot water -- and Jeeves always is on hand, with a plot cooking in his impressive brain, to haul his hapless employer out.

Among the many problems they have to tackle: a stolen cow creamer, a little book of insults directed at an amateur Hitler, a starvation tactic that ends in disaster, American millionaires, a flirtation with fatherhood, scandalous memoirs, Bingo Little's countless infatuations, the havoc wreaked by mustaches, pearl necklaces going missing, and many compromising situations that begin -- or end -- unwanted engagements.

""The Complete Jeeves and Wooster"" is quite faithful to Wodehouse's original stories -- some stories are combined and others are separated, but they draw heavily on his kooky, bizarro prose. Not to mention a sort of alternate between-wars England full of glamour and a merry-go-round of oft-broken engagements, with Jeeves as the calm in the storm's eye.

The only problem is that the stories set in New York just don't have that delicious British flavour that the rest of the series does, although they're still quite funny. That, and the cast changes continuously.

But those small flaws don't keep the series from being hilarious, from start to finish. Every episode is a hopeless tangle of infatuations, overbearing aunts, mixups, blackmail, newts, meddling aunts and young women ranging from devious to airy-fairy -- often all of the above. And yet somehow Jeeves manages to untangle it by the end. And Wodehouse's dialogue is handled in a brilliant manner (""Because he is a butterfly, who toys with women's hearts and throws them away like soiled gloves!"" ""Do butterflies do that?"").

Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are perfectly cast as the endearing bumbler Bertie Woosterand the dryly witty Jeeves. Though Bertie's lack of clothing sense (and a trombone) often annoys Jeeves, the brainy valet clearly does have affection for Bertie, and Bertie appreciates Jeeves' ability to save him from fates worse than death (such as marriage to the horribly hearty Honoria or the wispy, fairy-loving dimbulb Madeleine).

""The Complete Jeeves and Wooster"" is a simply brilliant stretch of what-ho-what-ho comedy (""You can't be a successful dictator AND design women's underclothing"") and deliciously twisting storylines. Not to be missed. Ever.",1237334400,38,3201,5.297830374753452

Admittedly some of the themes are similar.  And a few times the actors playing the secondary players changed which was slightly confusing. But overall excellent.

While the production quality and general feeling changed between seasons two and three, the first two seasons being excellent and the last two alright, the box set is worth the added price.  By the end of the 4th season there was a return to the old style, and brings nice closure to the series as a whole.

And here you can immerse yourself in his greatest creations--Wooster and Jeeves. My wife and I have regularly wended our ways through these delicious and droll comedies, ever since they first appeared on PBS 17 years ago. Been through the series six or eight times so far. The earlier episodes tend to be stronger. Because of these shows, we find ourselves unable to watch Hugh Laurie on House and take him seriously--because we know that somewhere inside that irascible, misanthropic M.D. is a sweet, inept, clumsy British twit.",1208736000,2,653,4.945454545454545

Absolutely entertaining and funny if you like Brit humour, have read the books and are willing to forgive some of the mannerisms.

First class!",1206489600,,297,4.9
1741029,5,B00006AVRK,"I absolutely love ""Jeeves and Wooster"". The stories of the happy-go-lucky, bumbling, slightly gormless, and chronically unlucky 'upper class twit', Bertie Wooster, and his witty, restrained, sagacious, and at all times effulgent gentleman's gentleman, Jeeves, are quite simply the stuff of legends. The humour and wit of P.G. Wodehouse is so brilliantly and seemingly effortlessly translated into film, and the portrayal of these undying comic characters lead by the inimitable comedy duo of Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry, are spot on.

One of the best things about these stories, be that in book form or as a television series, is the in-offensiveness of them. This is comedy as innocent as it gets and yet it is sidesplittingly funny. The subtleties and of the language, the delivery, the situations, the build up. Dreaming up inoffensive humour with an appeal transcending social status, educational level, cultural and historical background, and other prejudices is an amazing feat any day. People might of course have looked upon these stories with different eyes when they were written decades ago, and found them to be very much offensive, but that merely adds to the genius of the tales. They are still very funny today in 2008. And they will be very funny in another 60 years time.

The only regrettable thing about these adaptions of the Jeeves and Wooster novels is, that some of the parts were played by different actors in different series. A character might be played by A in series 1, but by B in series 3. It is but a minor inconvenience, but an inconvinience it is. Also it would have been nice with some extra material with these DVDs in these 'extra features' days in which we live. Interviews, commentaries, documentaries, and the like would have been a great addition to this excellent production, but at the same time it must be said, that the non-inclusion of bonus features dosen't detract from the overall quality and feel of the DVD package. You just want more, is all.

Highest possible recommendation.",1206057600,3,2027,4.9734513274336285
1741030,5,B00006AVRK,"In my opinion, this is the most consistently funny British comedy team since Monty Python!  Laurie and Fry could not have been cast more perfectly as Wooster and Jeeves respectively. Simon Langton (who also directed the superb BBC version of Pride & Prejudice) does a stunning job on the first season and he may be the best director that the series encountered. However, I highly recommend all of the DVDs - I always pull out Jeeves and Wooster when I need a pick-me-up. Family and friends have also caught the Wooster bug and are watching the episodes voraciously!  As a side note, fans of ""House"" (which also stars Hugh Laurie) will be impressed with the actor's range - Bertie Wooster is a total about face from Gregory House but equally as watchable!

We are quite happy with it and consider it to be in the same vain as the old ""Fawlty Towers"" series. Set in the 1920's, Bertie Wooster (Laurie) is an upper class gentleman who is continually getting himself in a predicament and Jeeves (Fry) his manservant works his magic to make sure his gentleman gets through the various situations unscathed and saves the day.

We love British comedies, and we decided to give Jeeves and Wooster a whirl, based on the high opinion of just about everyone who has watched the show.  What a treat.  From the first show, it is a riot.  Excellent scripting (which I guess we owe to the original author of the stories, Mr. Wodehouse), great casting, and just superb performances...one after the other.  If you appreciate that ""pithy"", snobby humor that the British seem to have an exclusive license for, this show is for you.  Goofy aristocrat (Wooster) hires, and is guided and sheltered through life by his valet (Jeeves); through one personal disaster after the other.  This one is worth every cent of the price.  Excellent sound and picture quality.  Nothing to complain about in any aspect.  We loved it - you will too !",1200960000,,878,4.642857142857143
1741054,1,B00006AVRK,"Hugh Laurie and Steven Fry are brilliant.  The problem is that the show's theme song is so catchy that if you are at all like me, it will stick in your head, repeat itself dozens if not hundreds of times a day, and even interfere with your sleep!

And the theme song is the BACKGROUND music for the show and keeps being played in most scenes!  NOT GOOD!

Alas, the DVDs, like the VCR tapes, do NOT have closed captioning, so there is no way of avoiding having the jingly, ear-fetching, tune bore into one's skull!

I'm an avid P.G. Wodehouse reader and love the humor, comedy, and wonderful timing of this duo, but the music overwhelms the pleasure!

Why, oh why, did they not put closed captioning on these?  Can the IDA apply here?  Can they be forced to to open this up to the hard of hearing?  And help the rest of us who'd rather not hear the music!",1200960000,30,854,4.254658385093168

Beyond their 3-dimensional acting abilities, their timing and chemistry are honed to perfection from their years as a comedy team (and as part of the Black Adder series among other projects).

While I absolutely love the series of four seasons, it is clear that cast and screenplay changes in the 2nd and especially 3rd seasons are somewhat weaker.  However, the overall series makes it well worth it.

Laurie is deliciously dense to Fry's splendidly sensible, ever resourseful Jeeves. These two actors make Wooster and Jeeves their own. My highest recomendations.

There seems to have been some sort of ill-advised pan-and-scan at work; some parts of the picture are cut off, which is most noticeable in the opening credits, where parts of the credits for the author and crew's names vanish outside the frame.

In addition, I am dismayed by the quality of the picture representation; these episodes badly need remastering.  The picture quality is blurry and indistinct, and there seems to have been some color loss or color shift.  The sound is rather less full than I would have liked, as well.

Perhaps this is a result of the quality of the original recordings, but I do not remember such poor picture quality on my initial televised viewing.",1199145600,26,814,4.827338129496403

Having watched a few of these, it is impossible to read the original stories without hearing Stephen Fry's voice as Jeeves. (For example, ""No, sir"" now acquires his unique intonation.) Separating Jeeves from Fry is like trying to imagine Rumpole as someone other than Leo McKern, that is, impossible.

1741094,5,B00006AVRK,"Honestly, it seems that Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie were born just to portray Jeeves and Wooster. Not only were their casting as the title characters spot-on, the crew is amazing in capturing the look and feel of Wodehouse's 1920s and -30s. Clive Exton's adaptation from the novels are incredibly well-done, Anne Dudley's music further sets the tone perfectly, and whoever chose the music for Wooster to play deserves an award. Costuming is excellent as well, and to a point, so is casting.

The most irritating thing about the programme is that actors frequently change. Sometimes scheduling cannot be helped, but it's all right. Once you figure out who is who, the farce continues. The only steady roles are Stephen Fry as Jeeves, Hugh Laurie as Wooster, and Robert Daws as Tuppy Glossop.

Unfortunately, because television networks can be fickle, it seems that Clive Exton used up the best bits in series one and two, and took many liberties in three and four. It wasn't so bad in three, but I cringed many times in four. Still, with a few selective omissions, the overall rating exceeds five stars.

On to my title: if you can, get the UK release. The first thing you should know, is that the UK is region 2, PAL format. Even if your player is region-free, if it does not recognise PAL, you will be extremely disappointed. Luckily, it's easier and cheaper than ever to find a machine that meets these requirements, and you can set a computer's DVD drive to UK (many drives allow you a set number of times you can change a region, so be very, very careful).

I was fortunate to find the first three series of A&E's version at the local library, and was disappointed in the bland menu, lack of a play-all button, and absence of subtitles. This is not the first A&E release that irritated me (Monty Python seems to be the only programme they did right), and when the opportunity to purchase the UK Granada Ventures release popped up, I pounced on it, figuring, ""There's no way it can be worse.""

I was not disappointed. Aside from the beautiful fold-out display, there is a very stylish interactive menu, a play-all button, and subtitles. Believe me, those subtitles rescued me more than once.

However, I'm not going to pretend the UK release did not have any shortcomings. The fold-out display is akin to that of ""Scrubs"" and the like, in that for each section there are two discs, one partly overlaid atop another. There is also an annoying anti-piracy message at the beginning of each disc (eight total), that cannot be skipped (this has been the standard with Granada Ventures, unfortunately). It's best to pop in the disc and wander off while the thing loads. Lastly, the only thing A&E did right was to name the episodes so you have some idea of what each episode is about. There are no synopses, and each episode is headed ""Series One, Episode One"", etc. You leap into each storyline cold, but if you write a little note or download the information and slip it into the case, it's not so bad.

Still, the Granada Ventures version is the one to have, and if the opportunity ever arises for you, I suggest you snap at it.",1179878400,5,3128,4.635379061371841

1741096,5,B00006AVRK,"The title for my review comes from one of the Roaring 20s songs, ""Nagasaki,"" that Wooster is so fond of.  You'll hear other songs from the multitalented Hugh Laurie, sometimes joined by friend and colleague Stephen Fry, as they play, respectively, the bumbling Bertie Wooster and his brilliant, patient valet Reginald Jeeves.

Nobody needs help getting through life more than Bertie!  He's been raised by overbearing aunts, he's got a goofy cousin and many foolish friends, he doesn't get along well with kids or dogs, and he can't keep house to save his life.  He has money but no sense.  Along comes Jeeves to rescue him from himself and many other tangles he gets himself into.

The third and fourth seasons' NYC-based stories tend to be weaker, overall, than most of the others, with too much farce and slapstick and not enough wordplay, but every episode is worth watching.  You never know what will happen next.  This series has made me curious to see the two leads' earlier work together, A Bit of Fry and Laurie.  You will, of course, also recognize Laurie as House, MD, the hit show on FOX; and Fry is still busily acting as well, even showing up recently on another FOX show, Bones.  I hope someone at the studio can figure out how to get House on Bones with Fry, or Fry on the set of House as a patient or fellow doctor.",1177632000,3,1331,4.554621848739496

1741105,5,B00006AVRK,"Hugh Laurie is, for my money, the finest actor now working.  His Greg House has made him a public reputation, but the Jeeves and Wooster series, in which he played P.G. Wodehouse's Bertie Wooster to Stephen Fry's Jeeves, was his first triumph.  Laurie was fresh out of Cambridge and evidently didn't realize that comedy is much harder to play than tragedy.  These stories are a stitch, and Laurie (and his friend Stephen Fry)display talent of the highest order.

This set is a must for the sophisticated viewer who spends far too much time vainly searching the channel listings for something worth watching.

But unfortunately the video to DVD transfer, in terms of picture and colour quality, leaves something to be desired. I have seen single series DVD versions of the Jeeves & Wooster and their video colour quality is superior to the reproduction in this complete set. Hopefully one of these days we will see a complete digital remastering of the series, but this box set is visually disappointing.

1741114,5,B00006AVRK,"Be warned: this is one of those semi-""literary"" reviews in which I'm going to talk about Wodehouse, the Jeeves and Wooster series, and the literary heirs of Wodehouse, for those who think there's no such thing as enough comedy in the world.

P. G. Wodehouse (""Plum"" to his friends) was the funniest man who ever set pen to paper. He lived to the ripe old age of ninety-three and wrote over ninety books, many featuring the amiable and well-meaning, if somewhat misguided, Bertie Wooster and his brainy manservant Jeeves. Although his work stretches from the late 1890s to the early 1970s, the rudeness of the outside world almost never intrudes and there are surprisingly few cultural references. Wodehouse's stories exist in a kind of eternal Eden of innocent lads and maids chasing each other around the garden and trying to avoid the various serpents trying to crash the party. His characters are almost exclusively from that most useless branch of society, the English moneyed class, and their problems are all silly ones: which witless man will win which brainless girl, and how Aunt Dahlia can steal a silver cow-creamer for her husband so that he'll give her the necessary funds to buoy up her ladies' journal ""Milady's Boudoir.""

And yet. . . And it's in the ""and yet"" that Wodehouse makes his mark as the most brilliant social satirist of all time. Unlike George Bernard Shaw, Wodehouse makes no grand stands, addresses no revolutionary agendas. Simply, quietly, and persistently, he takes aim at pretension, meanness, and cruelty by carrying it to its most absurd extent.

Wodehouse's humor is small, domestic, personal, and eternal. Of a man engaged to a bossy woman, he writes: ""He might take the view that when the little [woman] made him sit up and beg and snap lumps of sugar off his nose, it was a compliment, really, because it showed that she was taking an interest."" Of a particularly bad play: ""One of the critics said he had perhaps seen it at a disadvantage because when he saw it the curtain was up."" And of Jeeves's morning conversation with Bertie: ""The English poet Herrick expressed the same sentiment when he suggested that we should gather rosebuds while we may. Your elbow is in the butter, sir."" (All quotes here from ""Jeeves and The Tie That Binds."")

Now, as for Fry and Laurie's rendition of Jeeves and Wooster: it is perfect. And bear in mind that, appearances to the contrary (because Fry and Laurie make it look so effortless), Jeeves and Wooster may be the two most difficult roles in all literature. Bertie must come across as amiable and well-meaning, if a trifle dim, but not a blithering idiot. David Niven tried, and it was a disaster. Jeeves is only slightly less challenging; while he must come across as brilliant and accommodating, he must do so with dignity, with only a minimum of condescension, and with a real fondness for Bertie, something like a mother hen for a slightly addlepated chick.

Fry and Laurie are prefect, as is, by the way, the excellent dramatization and the rest of the ensemble cast. Be warned, however, once you pick up Wodehouse, you'll be hooked forever. Fortunately, his output was prodigious, so you'll have plenty to read and reread, over and over and over. The books never pall; I've read many of them several times and they are always, as Wodehouse titled one of his books, ""Something Fresh.""

By way of literary genealogy, Wodehouse's stylistic heirs are Douglas Adams (of ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" fame), Joss Whedon (creator of Buffy, Angel, and the Firefly/Serenity series and film), and Hugh Laurie himself, whose first book ""The Gun Seller"" continues in the Wodehouse tradition. For example: ""I hadn't actually planned on picking his brains, because, to be honest, they weren't properly ripe yet."" Or the extraordinary line: "". . . there's an undeniable pleasure in stepping into an open-top sports car driven by a beautiful woman. It feels like you're climbing into a metaphor."" And as for Joss Whedon, you can practically tell which Wodehouse books he was reading while writing Buffy. When Giles tells Xander: ""I suppose there's a certain Machiavellian ingenuity to your transgression,"" and Xander replies, ""I resent that. . . .Or possibly, thank you,"" they might have stepped right out of Wodehouse's ""Full Moon."" For his part, Douglas Adams wrote some of the most purely Wodehousian lines of all time, such as: ""How do you feel?"" ""Like a military academy; bits of me keep passing out.""

So if you want smart, talky, deliciously funny stuff, you can't do better than settling down with the Fry and Laurie's Jeeves and Wooster, apart, of course, from picking up any of Wodehouse's ninety-some books. Fry and Laurie, however, are a wonderful place to start.",1154131200,56,4751,4.894409937888199

1741116,5,B00006AVRK,"The T.V. transformation of P.G. Wodehouse's 'Jeeves & Wooster' novels, represents what was a much needed breath of fresh air into the situation comedy genre. Where many other shows will use crude, cheap sexual innuendos, 'Jeeves & Wooster' will use witty, urbane and sophisticated humour. This will prove endlessly enjoyable for many viewers.

The capers of Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves are hilarious. Bertie constantly gets himself into horrendous fixes involving assorted unwanted fiancees and angry aristocrats, only to be rescued by his erudite, intelligent and always loyal man-servant. Allied to Bertie's antics are those of his amusingly named friends in which Bertie is constantly entangled. Chums such as Tuppy Glossup, Gussy Finknottle and Cyril Bassington Bassington add their own confusion into an already amusing mix.

The complete 'Jeeves and Wooster' is a fantastic set for anyone who is sick of cheap toilet humour and would prefer their comedy to be a little more clever and witty.",1150761600,5,1005,5.3544303797468356

1741122,5,B00006AVRK,"Anyone who's seen this set or read the relevant Wodehouse books will recognize my title as the recurring ""Yeoman's Wedding Song"" as muddled through on various occasions by Bertie Wooster. Such recurring motifs render the books timelessly enjoyable, and they have their delightful counterparts as visualized in this series.

It's always a question what characters in a book ought to look like, as well as the tone of their delivery. Everyone has some idea of what Jeeves must be like. Fortunately, so has Stephen Fry who plays him in this stellar series, perfectly matched to Laurie's Bertie Wooster.

These four seasons were filmed by three different directors, and only the fourth season seems to get the tone wrong, and even then it's above most viewing. Many of the episodes closely follow the books and short stories. Where they deviate, they usually don't improve on PG's version, but neither do they come out a lot worse. A&E changed the episode titles from the Masterpiece Theater versions on VHS, causing some confusion, but in this box set, you know you've got them all. Those who find current television viewing perfectly beastly might be delighted (as I was) to find this series.

Their shrieks of laughter could be heard 1,500 miles away.  Aside from that peculiar similarity, the second in the series, with its various renditions of ""Sonny Boy"" stands out as one of the funniest, if not the funniest, things I have ever seen.  The way it builds is priceless.  Of course, Jeeves, is there to counsel and protect his master; indeed, he is Machiavellian in his instigations and Wooster is so gullible.

1741124,4,B00006AVRK,"Or is it Bingo who wants to be engaged? Or Bertie who doesn't? Or Gussie who does, but Madeline doesn't? Oh my, marital near-misses are the order of the day for these tales, as Bertie and his assortment of nitwits and numbskulls careen dangerously close to matrimonial bliss, only to escape at the last moment.

There are innumerable pleasures to be had in these gorgeous dramatizations of Wodehouse's greatest duo. As a long time reader of the books, I know a bit of Bertie and his gentleman's gentleman. Though Stephen Fry is too young, he makes a sensational Jeeves. And Hugh Laurie inhabits Bertie in way that makes the viewer admire the very bally balliness of it all. The aged aunts, the cousins, girlfriends, and Spodes all shimmer and glisten. Pow-spot on!

But these tales focus a bit too much on the madcap, the loony, the wacky. A book, with many pages of skillful narrative between the plot devices to set up the next one, does not generally degenerate into the cartoons these sometimes do. That being said, these DVDs are indeed fun. Not side-splitting riots. You'll not often laugh out loud, but you will be uplifted and cheered repeatedly. Continuously clever, they are generally a joy to watch. The Fry/Laurie interaction is a continual delight. The sets are astonishing, the clothes breathtaking. The ocean liner is positively amazing. The music is so well-chosen you wish a special recognition for it. The look, the sound, the feel is so right so many times one is forced to sit back in raw humble admiration.

So why only four stars? Well, the starch went out of the writing as the show progressed; the later episodes are generally beneath the wit of the earlier ones. The Americans are almost uniformly awful, and since the writer chose to spend so much time in America (to cultivate an audience for the show?...I cannot understand why) we are forced to watch bad actors and actresses in long, tedious sequences. I cannot help but wonder what Fry and Laurie were thinking as these American doofuses dropped their lines as if they were hammering anvils. So-hours of fun, stuff that is worth owning as you will want to share them and re-watch. But missing the last ounce of energy and perfection that makes five star heaven.

Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are unbelievably hilarious as the pleasant, rather thick Bertie Wooster and the unflappable Jeeves. They will forever be Jeeves and Wooster in my imagination as I read the books. The things Hugh Laurie can do with his face are amazing, and Stephen Fry completely perfects the concept of the expressionless expression.

The supporting cast is good as well, even though the actors portraying various characters change throughout. I especially love Bertie's aunts, who persist in treating their grown nephew as if he's perpetually ten years old.

It's a pity American television so rarely rises to anywhere near the excellence of a series like this. It's well worth purchasing the set and savoring every bit of Jeeves and Wooster one possibly can.",1131580800,6,883,5.160839160839161
1741129,5,B00006AVRK,"I have been enjoying ""Jeeves and Wooster"" for the past 8 years on the advice of a friend, who knew I enjoy British situation comedies and dramas.  ""Jeeves and Wooster"" based on the novels of the famous British/American author P.G. Woodhouse, is both comedy and drama.  There are serious elements, but the comic is always at the front, in a very refined, subtle way.  This whole series operates on the basic story of a wealthy young man in the late 1920s, Bertram (Bertie) Wooster, played by Hugh Laurie, who has as his butler/valet/chauffer/cook Jeeves, played by Stephen Fry.  Wooster is frequently involved in marital and business entanglements which he finds impossible to got out of, without the help of Jeeves, his brilliant, behind the scenes butler.  Jeeves often manages to play one party against another:individuals who are antagonists to Wooster in the story - to solve a given situation, or crisis.

I bought these on VHS in 1997 and 1998, after seeing 3 episodes from the 1991 season (the 2nd season) on PBS.  I was so impressed not only with the acting, but also the scenery, sets, and the beautiful, huge stately houses they were filmed in, I was immediately hooked.  I wish I could have foreseen the advent of DVD, and would have waited;  buying these on VHS, I spent about 3 times - for 21 different VHS tapes - the price this Megaset sells for today.

The supporting actors and characters are also excellent, which vary from episode to episode.  The chemistry between them shows a real glimpse into life of the English upper middle and upper classes in the 1920s, and how out of touch with reality they appear to us in the first decade of the 2000s.  There are always 3 plots going on in each episode which shift back and forth, and all are resolved at the end of each 50 minute episode.

I cannot say enough good about this series, and it's very high quality.  Also, the lack of sexual themes, extreme violence, and foul language makes it a good series for family entertainment, although some children and teens may miss the subtle humor of Wooster's and Jeeves' lines.  But I recommend it wholeheartedly.",1128297600,11,2123,4.7

1741131,5,B00006AVRK,"There are some very detailed reviews here, so I won't repeat what's on offer and who's who.

Let me just say that P.G. Wodehouse's books are super funny. I have read almost every single one of his scores of novels, short stories and plays, and have not found one bad apple - they are either good, brilliant or extraordinary. And of all his books, those dealing with the immortal Jeeves and his amiably idiotic employer Bertie Wooster are arguably the best.

This TV series has captured the essence of those books. The acting, the direction, the locations, the dresses of the actors, the situations are perfect. It's comedy at its unpretentious best.

Buy it, you will love it.

Here's an addition to this review after watching over 3/4ths of the titles in this set:

I would probably give this set 4.5 out of 5 stars, only for one reason: the many changes to the actors who play the supporting roles to Jeeves and Wooster in the various episodes. (Thank God they did not change Jeeves and Wooster, they are BRILLIANT.) It's a little disconcerting to watch, like and get used to Bingo Little in season 1, only to discover a new actor playing him in season 2. Or the celebrated aunts. Or a few others.

Overall, though, I would reiterate that this is a very funny series worth buying.",1116633600,31,1282,4.576419213973799
1741132,5,B00006AVRK,"Started reading Wodehouse for the first time this year, and became an addict.  This series perfectly captures the wit and feel of the novels, even if details get tweaked to make the stories work visually.

I was a little disappointed when they swapped out actors for Gussie in the 3rd season since the actor who played him in the first two seasons was superb.  (I must have replayed the scene where Gussie mimics the male newt's courting dance 50 times and brayed like a donkey every time.)

Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are perfection as Bertie and Jeeves; their expressions and timing - well, everything they do - are a delight. By the way, this set is worth the price just for the side-splitting cow creamer episodes, which Wodehouse wrote in ""The Code of the Woosters.""",1110758400,12,772,4.654411764705882

The only drawback I can find is that the minor characters have different actors playing them from series to series. You just get used to one Aunt Dahlia or Madeline Bassett when another one with a different face and voice crops up next series. A shame, but it still doesn't spoil a 10 star series.",1095984000,8,521,4.663043478260869
1741136,5,B00006AVRK,"Well, Its like this. Not to long ago an old chump of mine decided to lay on me these televised versions of a previously unheard of cluster of books.  With serious hindsight I should have just dismissed the dratted things, but you should know that the future happened to elude me just then, and I launched myself into them with all the gusto of an alley cat onto a fishbone. In fact the whole bally idea of it rather struck me.
  To be perfectly honest, I must say that it was hard to say no to after the pitch I was given. My sword swingin comrade said in no uncertain terms, and with a polite slowness that keeps me on the right level, that I would like them, that they were good, and that he would stand behind me with said sword and make sure I laughed. At first I gathered that he was laying it on a bit thick, but when I saw the fevered intensity that  broke out into a sweat across his face, I knew that he was sure of himself.
  They were dashed nonsense really, but I couldn't help but take a liking to them. Seeing an English gent trying to fix situational problems when he seems to be missing a bit of grey matter is all well and good, but I felt nothing but relief each time his valet was brought onto the scene to take matters into his own hands.
  Wooster (the grey matter missing chap), is a likable fellow. Always willing to help out a friend in need, which usually lands him into a tight spot, while Jeeves (the aforementioned valet), has a mind that can tackle the toughest issues, and is willing to do so as long as Wooster can stay within Jeeves's fashion limits.
  Along the way I encountered an odd, but strangely refreshing cast. From jolly old fish-face, to the newt toting Finknottle. From a multitude of Brittish gals who have the wrong idea that Wooster is madly in love with them, to an array of aunts who can't wait to find something wrong with the poor chap. (...) And I can't forget to mention the mob of friends who flit from one romance to the next.
  After sitting through all four seasons in a short 3 or 4 week time, I realized that Wooster was a part of me and I couldn't very well give up the poor fellow.
  I have of late found myself reading a dashed good novel called ""Life With Jeeves"", also provided by my previous mentioned chum. Supposedly it was written by P.G. Woodhouse, but I know it was really Wooster himself just using a pen name, after getting the idea from his friend Bingo who once gave him the false name of Rosie M. Banks, a popular novelist of her time. I know this because he wrote it in first person, and someone calls him by his real name at least once every page.

  I am so infatuated that I have taken to prowling on Amazon, watching all the Jeeves and Wooster pages (and there are a lot of them), waiting for any fresh reviews to satisfy my new needs.

That which makes one man laugh will make another weep (or sneer), and vice-versa; the polarities of `funny' tend to fall into the time-honored wit-slots of lowbrow (Adam Sandler pleb-fests), middlebrow (mainstream sitcoms), and highbrow (satire, tongue-in-cheek obscurest in-joshing). Alas, the boundaries between `brows are vast, virulently defended, and rarely surmounted by either artist or audience... and as to which is truly `better,' well, that is (I repeat) a subjective preference: for each represents a facet of humanity - from the all-encompassing exit-point of the gutter to the slick exclusivity of the Ivory Tower - and should be respected as such.  The language and technique may differ, yet under the surface the similarities cannot be denied - for as any Buddhist will happily tell you, comedy thrives on *suffering*: the pain and folly of humanity exposed, ridiculed, and reduced in turn by the cathartic chuckle; our redundancies, egocentricies, idiocies and plain tomfoolery encapsulated for exorcism and/or easy digestion.
Rare is it for one to find a comedy that deftly blends the best elements of all three `brow aesthetics' into a humor-vehicle that is at once escapist and illuminating.  *Wooster and Jeeves*, an A&E adaptation of the P.G. Wodehouse serial-novels of the same name, achieves this exceptional distinction.  With its natural dialogue (culled directly from the source material), impeccable comic timing and excellent acting, along with an extremely refreshing variation on the standard development-of-conflict/culmination-of-tension sitcom-structure, *Wooster and Jeeves* towers over the dross and diminished returns of mainstream H-wood offerings, exposing the implicit poverty of ultra-recycled miscommunication-muddling, senseless slapstick, lowest-common-denominator joke-dialogue and imbecilic `shock' theatrics.  This is one for the archives.
*Wooster and Jeeves* centers around one Bertram Wooster (Hugh Laurie), an archetypical English wealth-scion of the flapper `20s (i.e. a playboy and all-around fop), and Jeeves (Stephen Fry), his sophisticated valet.  Bertie has devoted his existence to simple pleasures: afternoon excursions to the local gentleman's club for drinks and nine-ball; the occasional golf-game in the countryside; learning all the newest tunes on his piano (and, distressingly, a trombone).  But this peaceful existence is constantly threatened by his relatives and school-chum companions, who endeavor often-as-not to involve him in their half-witted shenanigans (often via blackmail), or seek to marry him off so as to be `molded' into an upstanding citizen.  Luckily Bertie has Jeeves, his upper-crust manservant of philosophical bent, photographic memory and astonishing reliability, to help him wriggle free from these various entanglements/entrapments: ""you're a rare bird, Jeeves!"" Bertie invariably exclaims upon hearing the elegant, simple solutions his valet conjures.  Indeed, compared to the lassitude and loathsome irresponsibility run rampant in Bertie's circle of the privileged (...peacocks, puff-adders and/or prunes), Jeeves is a pillar and a paragon, far more cultivated in his education and moral fortitude than any of the noble-rank he so impeccably serves.  This could be considered a clich, and with good reason - but we must remember that clichs often have a strong basis in reality, and such is the case here.  Wooster & co., born with the silver spoon firmly placed in mouth, have never had to struggle for anything: thus, stressful occasion is usually invented or invited, for excitement, a `lark', a means to obtain the suffering so key in delineating character and defining pleasure, whereas Jeeve's fortitude is all self-made, stamped upon soul and sinew through years of willing trial.
But I digress.  The one thing I like most about *Wooster and Jeeves,* aside from the top-notch writing, acting, set-design and dramatic construction, is the fact that it sidesteps the typical tension-build of very nearly all comedy.  In the usual spate of sitcom and other `brow-aesthetics,' a situation is introduced, complications ensue, and with an unhealthy over-reliance of miscommunication, the tension is milked and milked until `release' - long after the outcome has been thoroughly predicted by the jaded audience.  In each episode of *Wooster and Jeeves*, however, the writers have combined several of Wodehouse's short stories, therein threading events, character-arcs and complications into a sinuous storm of tension/release.  Rare is it for an uncomfortable situation to wear out its premise: not only are conflicts dispatched in a speedy and sometimes surprising manner, they often mutate into different, contrasting developments...an incredibly refreshing twist.  This show is *not* milked, and there is (almost) always enough material to fill a 45-minute episode.
Until, that is, the fourth season.  All that makes this series extraordinary is astonishingly reputed in the disastrous return-to-America episodes, which stretch credibility well past the breaking point and simply are _not_ up to snuff with the prior three seasons.  The Empire State Building climax of `The Once and Future Ex' borders on disgusting parody; the castaway epilogue to `Bridegroom Wanted' is humorous only in a surreal `what were they thinking?' sort of way.  Everything returns to normal (more or less) once Bertie and Jeeves reach England, though the spark of the show is discernable weakened afterward and even the return of powerhouse personality-clashes like that of Finknottle and Spode come of more like copycat comedy when compared to their predecessors.
Regardless, this box set is well worth the lucre.  Five stars.",1080691200,60,5858,5.688430698739977
