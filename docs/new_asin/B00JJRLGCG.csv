6363751,5,B00JJRLGCG,"This is a great DVD, with four wonderful stories, a must for young people. Caution is that not all stories end happy but that is lives lesson.",1414281600,,142,4.296296296296297
6363752,5,B00JJRLGCG,"Arrived in a timely fashion, and new, in excellent condition, at a good price.  I bought it for ""The Elephant That Found A Mom"" and delighted there are 3 additional hour long episodes as well, featuring Andre the Seal, and Ape who went to College, and one about a Rhino.  Very heartwarming stories!  Young and old alike will enjoy these shows.  AND if it originally aired on PBS, you know they're top notch!",1412553600,,407,4.534246575342466

And they thoroughly enjoy 'anthropomorphic' stories.",1409875200,,197,4.5

6363757,5,B00JJRLGCG,"Two DVDs covering four stories, sixty minutes each where every single relationship is as touching as the other one. The producers of this documentary should have provided links so others could follow the work of dedicated individuals like Daphne or could have even offered help if possible. I hope that the producers will post links in the comment section if possible.

If you thought you have experienced love with your domesticated pet, then imagine having a pet like rhino, a black rhino, a wild beast as your pet, inside your home, in your kitchen, in your bedrooms, in your refrigerator, as your fifth youngest kid among your other four biological kids. In the late 1960, there were 70,000 black rhinos in Africa, today there are fewer than 5,000. Losing 65,000 rhinos in fifty years is a shocking statistic. Probably if every single Chinese who believes in destroying any specie on this planet from rhinos to tigers to elephants, for their stupid medical or moral reasons which is certainly not understandable to other souls, got the chance to see the documentary, then probably, I mean probably that could give some hope, some recovery time to this magnificent creatures to recover in the wild so not only this generation but the future generations as well, could actually see these creatures in the wild and appreciate their existence.

What Dr. John Condy, his loving wife and his four kids did for Rupert is truly humanity at its best. Wish Condy families much health and happiness. Watching the cry, the tears of Daphne Sheldrick for Aisha, is truly the most painful part of the whole documentary. No one should cry like that although her cry is a cry of a mother who has lost a child, a very caring mother who made me cry as well. Thank you Daphne for all that you have done. Wish you love, peace and happiness. This is a very touching documentary, a very emotional movie that will bring tears to your eyes and I hope it will bring humanity or compassion to any soul especially those destructive Chinese who need to change for better. But wait, the biggest market is not China, it is New York and California, the same two states especially CA with all its arrogant Hollywood crowd who will do anything to promote themselves at the cost of life, any life on this planet earth while making and promoting documentaries about how businesses are killing planet earth but not their audience. CA sells more ivory than anyone else, meaning more dead elephants... Only if one could get it through the heads of those careless Californians. An absolute shame.",1406851200,14,2560,4.776523702031603

8651526,5,B00JJRLGCG,"The reason that I ordered My Wild Affair is that I saw it on public TV.  I was smitten with the love that Daphne Sheldrick had for elephants and how she cared for them and the sanctuary she set up.  I am a real animal lover ..If you love animals too you must see this video.
