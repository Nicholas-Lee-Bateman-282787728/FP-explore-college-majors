3802844,5,B001ULCY48,"Press release from Warner Home Video says that Everwood Season 4 will be available June 14, 2011! Now we can complete our collection! I can't wait - just waiting for Amazon to catch up to this news.",1297728000,20,198,4.378378378378378
3802845,5,B001ULCY48,"Everwood was one of the best series ever to be shown on TV. I truly hope season 4 gets released soon. I watch the first 3 seasons at least once a year. The cast on Everwood is the best I've seen in years. As was written by other ppl, it's a shame Everwood lasted only 4 seasons. Had it been known at the time, it was going to be Everwood or 7th Heaven to be axed, I would have voted to keep Everwood. Everwood had lots more to offer with great storylines, ones that would draw the viewer in. Here's hoping the 4th season gets released soon.",1291852800,2,540,4.05607476635514
3802846,5,B001ULCY48,Everwood is the favorite TV series of my entire family.  We are anxiously awaiting the 4th season on DVD.  Great story and great acting make this series the greatest ever!!,1283040000,8,172,4.7
3802847,5,B001ULCY48,"The third season of Everwood has finally being released, with music changes of course, but oh well. I guess enough people eventually got out there and bought that set because we will soon be able to buy this fourth and final season of the classic WB drama, Everwood. This season contains the final 22 episodes of Everwood:

A Kiss to Build a Dream On
The Next Step
Put On a Happy Face
Pieces of Me
Connect Four
Free Fall
Pro Choice
So Long, Farewell...
Getting to Know You
Ghosts
Lost and Found
You're a Good Man, Andy Brown
An Ounce of Prevention
Across the Lines
The Land of Confusion
Truth...
All the Lonely People
Enjoy the Ride
Reckoning
Goodbye, Love
Foreverwood Part 1
Foreverwood Part 2

The final season stuck true to the tone that the show had established in previous seasons. Each season had it's own themes though and each can be classified with an overall theme. Season 1 was a year of hope and innocence, season 2 and the aftermath of the season one finale found a year of growth while coping with depressing realities, season 3 brought us realistic hope and season four brought us a maturity and understanding. Personally I prefer season's one and three of the show the best but this entire series was as fantastic as a network family/small town drama can get. So get out there and buy the third season set so that we can eventually get the option of owning the fourth.

And for anyone who loves this show and is looking for another small town/family drama I suggest NBC's fan loved but little known show, Friday Night Lights. The first season of which is fantastic and one of the best seasons of a television series ever. The show isn't just about high school football but about life, the Texas town of Dillon and the lives of the people in it. The show uses football like Everwood uses Andy being a doctor, it's not the story but merely a means to open up the story. While the second season became overdramatized for a short while it's third, fourth and fifth seasons have been fantastic. We've now lost another great show as the fifth season was the final one but I highly recommend the series on DVD. Thanks.",1266796800,61,2127,4.505181347150259
3802848,5,B001ULCY48,"This is really a wonderful ending to a wonderful series.  Too bad it only lasted four seasons.  I thought though for the last season, they stuck true to what had worked for Everwood the whole time.  The characters are fulfilled and you don't end the show with a huh? How could they end like that?  If you have enjoyed the first three seasons I recommend getting this to complete your collection!",1249516800,45,395,4.52112676056338

3802877,5,B001ULCY48,"I almost didn't buy the first season of Everwood because I've never been a fan of Treat Williams. I'm glad I did. It's perhaps the best TV show of its kind I've ever watched and I'm not exactly a youngster. In fact, I'm a grandfather and yet I've enjoyed the entire series immensely. I find Everwood to be extremely well done with interesting and believable characters set in a small town somewhere in Colorado.",1426896000,,411,4.5675675675675675

3802902,4,B001ULCY48,"I was a fan of the theme music before I was a fan of the show.  The adventures of Andy Brown and his tedious son, Ephraim, were interesting.  The show was always well written and always dealt responsibly with difficult issues.  I loved the character of Hanna best of all.  She was honest about everything and you don't see that often.  I liked the way they ended the series.  It had class.  These discs have extras including alternate endings.  They are reasonably priced and well worth the time you would spend on them.",1401235200,,520,4.516129032258065

3802907,5,B001ULCY48,"So very impressed with the drama & emotion of this show. Treat Williams is so fantastic & you almost feel his pain through the show. It's similar to Gilmore Girls in my opinion.

3802933,1,B001ULCY48,"The product showed up very quickly, which is great!

The dvd quality is shockingly bad:  I have to think it may be a bootleg copy somehow:  The first four episodes were ok but each one after is very dark - making it difficult to make out images much of the time; the picture is also very grainy; and the motion is almost never normal and is very choppy at times.

If the product wasn't so inexpensive I'd sent it back.  But knowing what I know I would not waste my time with ordering this product OR perhaps it was the vendor who produced a terrible product.  It was especially creepy to see what I knew were white teeth look like they were rotted out teeth.

No other show on tv in delievered such a realistic portrayal of the father-son dynamic. Its a beautiful four years. I am honored by its creation each day of my life. I was part of the Save Everwood Campaign, it was an amazing experience that will stay with me for the rest of my life. Letter writing, pinecone mailing, sending music sheets, candies, bombarding execs networks with emails, ad in variety, raising $10,000 for schools in ogden, utah, girl scout troop, and a beautiful ferris wheel that both honored a show that had changed our lives and the wonderful finale we recieved.

Today's actors don't speak loudly like the old stage actors used to, which makes the programming much more realistic without everyone speaking loudly. However, those of us with hearing problems can't always get the key words and some of the actors are natural mumblers, which bewilders me, since they're in the business of speaking words! Anyway, I could not enjoy the episode and will not pay for another if there are no captions. Too bad the industry is taking so long to respond to this common problem for so many of us. On a light note, we have developed the technology to go to the moon decades ago, but today's thinkers seem to be getting lazier. We have braille numbers on the ATMs at drive throughs and if we don't swipe our cards real fast at the gas pump, the machine won't read it.",1346976000,3,893,4.552795031055901

The color was off (kind of deep red) and i got very upset that i couldn't fix it. the 4th season also disappointed me in terms of scenario. it's like they wanted to just film something so they get done. there were many gaps in the plot. i watched the whole thing eventually but it really brought down my overal rating for Everwood.

HOWEVER, Warner Bros did a terrible job with the production of these DVD's.  The picture quality is shockingly bad given Warner Bros' past history of producing quality products.  For example, all the Smallville seasons look BEAUTIFUL.  I am shocked that they would put out such poor quality with Everwood Season Four. The worst part is how the picture quality in many episodes has continuous digital flaws including slow motion, blurred images, and ""digital jumps"".  It looks as if I was streaming the episodes online and didn't have a fast enough internet connection.  The picture is also frequently fuzzy/grainy and the widescreen bars are gray. As you can see from other reviews here on Amazon, I am not the only one who experienced this.  It is not a problem with every episode, but overall it is pretty sad. So it is definitely a problem with the DVD's. Warner Bros really does need to recall them and correct it. Us fans had to accept the changes in all the original music (except the score), but now we have to accept bad picture quality? We might be better off watching our recorded episodes from the television. At least then we would have all the original songs. BOO Warner Bros!",1316304000,5,1296,4.682819383259912

3802966,5,B001ULCY48,"Thankful they finally released Season 4 of this amazing show! I wasn't lucky enough to have seen the last two seasons when they aired on the WB, so it's all new to me. Just finished the first disc, and it's Everwood at its best. I would love to have a Season 5 to look forward to, but I'll take my time with this set and enjoy it. I do happen to know how it ends for at least a few of the characters, but I'll be excited to see what's in store for the rest. It's always hard when a show ends without a proper resolution, but I'm glad the producers of Everwood sensed they wouldn't get another year and did their best to tie things up for the beloved characters of Everwood. This is an amazing series for families, kids, teenagers, young adults... everyone really! I think we can all identify with one or more of the characters, and the small town setting makes Everwood feel like home. Definitely a great series to invest in. ETA: After doing my review, I was surprised some people were giving this only one star! When I looked closer, it was the poor production quality of the DVDs themselves that they were upset about. I was hoping I didn't have the same issue but after putting in disc 2 yesterday, my mom immediately said ""Why's it so dark?"" It's watchable, but once you notice how dark it is, it tends to distract you from the great story.

Its not unwatchable in my opinion,  but definately see how it could bother others.
Ok had to add an update,  2nd disc is starting to have pausing video every 2-3 minutes.  Now it is almost unwatchable.  The pause last for a few seconds then stars playing again.  If the 3rd disc does this I'm returning it. I dropping it down to 1 star.  Never have I been so dissapointed with something I bought from amazon.",1313798400,2,750,4.309352517985611

3802975,1,B001ULCY48,"I am as big a fan of EVERWOOD as the next guy, and since I only discovered this series after it's cancellation on DVD, I have been waiting impatiently for the release of Season 4. I am only half way through it on disc #3 and my disappointment with the shoddy production values of this final season has already caused me to return to the customer reviews to see if anyone else had the same experience. Yes, seasoned fans have discussed in length the copyrighted music substitutions, but am I the only one who experienced the appallingly horrendous episode transfers to disc? I have a bluray player which is designed to enhance  DVDs, and it usually does. Disc #1 played beautifully, but right from the start of disc #2, the color took on a dominant deep red bleed that remained unnaturally distracting throughout all of the five episodes. And the contrast of the disc was so severe that most exterior and interior scenes had backgrounds that were consistently near total dark blackness. Disc # 3 had all of the same problems, but so far the second episode had the additional distraction of scenes where the image broke down into pixal-like bits, went sluggish and lost sync with the soundtrack. The overall effect was not unlike a bootleg transferred from a poorly video taped copy rather than a professional distribution of a studio season release. I am grateful to finally complete my library's EVERWOOD collection, but it pains me to end it with something of this amateurishly poor level of disrespect and neglect. Am I the only one who feels this way?",1313280000,10,1554,4.734317343173432

3802979,3,B001ULCY48,"I have been a fan of ""Everwood"" literally since the day it premiered on The WB in September 2002, and thusly, have been waiting long until I could have the complete series on DVD.  I was overjoyed that the series was continued on DVD beginning in 2009 with ""The Complete Second Season"" and have waited patiently to have ""The Complete Fourth Season"".  I really didn't mind the music replacement too much for most of the episodes...although nearly every song was replaced except for all of Blake Neely's beautiful compositions.  However, I have always said that there is ONE EPISODE that definitely should go uncut and unaltered, and that is the series finale.  Although I personally pleaded with Warner Home Video in a chat as well as in numerous forums where it would be read, they butchered it in the worst ways possible!  While many of the songs used in other episodes really were ""sound alike"" replacements for the originals (they did a good job at choosing replacement songs overall), the songs chosen for the finale were not even close!  What's funny, one of the key songs--used on the montage of clips from past episodes featuring Amy and Ephram--isn't all that popular, so is presumably not all that expensive!  I also couldn't believe they made another TOTALLY UNNECESSARY change...the original broadcast of the double length finale was presented as a single two hour program...not as two separate episodes!  Although most won't probably care much about this, it does effect the authenticity, and also ruins some of the early scenes of ""part 2"", since they didn't have the credits rolling over them originally.

I will say that I was glad to finally get to see the ""Alternate Ending"" with Madison.  However, the box indicates that the previous unseen footage was a full 10 minutes long, while, in reality, its only about 4 minutes.  They simply attached the new scenes to the end of the final act (the other unchanged scenes from the final act are counted in the ""10 minutes"" mentioned on the package.).",1312243200,9,2011,4.850877192982456

3802985,5,B001ULCY48,"I watched this series when it first aired. The DVDs are alright but really compromised by the music alterations. 'Tis a pity that a series of this quality gets marred in this way. Fortunately, I made recordings of the original shows when they were first released and can watch the originals. If you haven't seen the series it is well worth a look. Very well written and scripted for a TV series which must cater to commercial interests and work within a prescribed and conventional format. I particularly liked and appreciated the Norman Rockwell motif which was woven into the first season - very subtle at first and then in one of the final episodes taking front and center. Also liked how the writers ""bookended"" season one with two crucial scenes - both taking place in Andy's BMW - of a conversation between father and son. The entire arc of the show was contained in those two powerful scenes. Nice work by the writers. I hope the ""suits"" will give us a bit more extras in the season 4 set, but, given the way they have treated the show over the years, I don't hold out a lot of hope.",1302307200,2,1090,4.455
3802986,5,B001ULCY48,"For those of us that watched Everwood through 4 great seasons, the CW creation was a very painful moment. Until the official release of the new network's complete schedule there was the hope that Everwood would make it to the station and would have a 5th season. This was such a strong possibility that the producers actually shot a cliffhanger that would work as a season finale.
However, when 7th Heaven's series finale was aired on the WB the ratings were excellent and the series took Everwood's spot on the CW.
Very stupid decision if you ask me. It was obvious that 7th Heaven would have good ratings because it was publicized as the FINAL episode of a series that has been around for decades. Even people who didn't really follow the show tuned in to see how things would wrap up. The very intelligente executives at CW decided to renew 7th Heaven and Everwood was cut off.
The good thing for us fans was that Everwood had a decent ending and all loose ends were tied.
Now, 5 years after the series finale, Warner gives us the dvd set with that cliffhanger that was never aired. Though way too late, we have to recognize that Warner showed a minimum of respect for us fans.
This 4th season dvd set is a must-have for everyone who loved Everwood.",1302307200,5,1252,4.495614035087719
3802987,5,B001ULCY48,"Everwood is more than worth your money as one of the finest written and produced family dramas ever to make it to television.  I am almost reluctant to use that tag, ""family drama,"" as I fear that for a lot of people, that means a sort of watered-down, saccharine approach to story-telling.  Not so for Everwood, creator Greg Berlanti's four-year labour of love.  While like any television drama, Everwood has to accelerate the speed at which drama enters the lives of ordinary people, the writers of the show have given viewers a testament to the wonder of human living and loving, in all its successes and failures.  Chief among Everwood's great charms is that it treats every generation as having stories worth telling, from grandparents to pre-teens, and not just the ""sexy teens"" so characteristic of the bulk of the programming on the now-defunct network, The WB (since 2006 merged with UPN to form ""The CW"").

Truth be told, there is a little bit of slipping toward toward the WB's teen focus in Everwood's last season.  Two of the show's most gifted writers, Michael Green (""Kings,"" ""Smallville,"" ""Green Lantern"") and John E. Pogue (who had also helped hold the previous seasons together as Executive Story Editor) are absent for this final set of episodes, and it shows.  Everwood could frequently hit notes in its writing that were more literary in their depth than one usually sees on a regular television series, and Green and Pogue were frequently episode-writers who delivered that quality.  Their absence could be seen in the greater emphasis on the teen characters in this last season, or, for example, the drift of some of the dialogue between characters like Amy and Hannah to a ""cuteness"" more characteristic of a show like Gilmore Girls.  But this is still a minor shift, not an utter break in continuity or style: Everwood remained a show with far more heart than one can normally find on television.

The fourth season DVD set suffered from some of the flaws I detailed in my review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Everwood-The-Complete-Second-Season/dp/B000LXH3SI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Everwood: The Complete Second Season</a>: Warner Brothers' abominable treatment of their product in gutting the musical score in order to save some money means that DVD viewers generally get unreleased (and therefore inexpensive for the network) songs that ""sound like"" the sort of music they replace, but which of course cannot have the same resonance that current or classic popular music could have in the score.  When the change in song or lyrical content actually changes the overall meaning of a scene, that's a particularly offensive savaging of the artistic efforts of the music and scoring crew, all of whom can significantly contribute to the whole mood of a scene.  The episodes in their original form may still circulate in the depths of the internet, but I regret anyone new being introduced to this treasure of a story who is not able to get the full effect of the original, and to appreciate the efforts of the crew in this way.  Likewise, Seasons 2 and 3 suffered enormously in not having the sorts of DVD extras one typically can enjoy, which are also sacrificed to Warner Brother's putting out the cheapest possible product.  Season 3's few paltry outtakes turned out to actually be from season 2, which was not only embarrassing, but effectively left season 3 with no extras at all.  The Season 4 set does a little better.  Before Everwood was inexplicably canceled in favor of alternatives like the already-canceled 7th Heaven or the doomed Runaways with their lesser ratings, there was season finale material with Madison that was shot, looking ahead to the never-produced Season 5.  (Huge props have to be given to the entire cast and crew for managing to provide a real ending to the show at the last minute.)  There was also a subplot with a relationship between Andy and Amy's professor that was dropped, and these are both present in outtakes.  No episode commentaries have been included since the Season 1 set, which was a normal, un-delayed and un-mangled release by Warner.  This is particularly a tragedy in a show where the writers are so much more obviously the ""stars"" of the show: the people that the actors love working with and are enthusing over.  In the Season 1 commentaries the cast are almost giddy with delight in the quality of what the writers are giving them.  Not being able to hear the writers, directors and producers comment on their intentions for their characters and stories is especially painful in a show like this one, which could fairly be described as TV's ""Great American Novel.""

Nevertheless, despite Warner Brothers' apparent desire to chip away at their own masterpiece, what is still available in the Season 2-4 DVD sets is still a fabulous experience for any new viewer about to watch them for the first time.  That, too, is a testimony to how well this show was made: that even in a slightly watered-down form, Everwood will be as strong for its genre as other recent classics like Lost or Battlestar Galactica were in theirs.  Beautifully written, honestly acted, and soulfully executed, Everwood is that rare gem of a show that you could watch with your peers, your grandparents or your (reasonably mature) kids, depending on your age.  There's beauty here for every kind of eye to behold.",1302307200,18,5416,5.003340757238307
3802988,5,B001ULCY48,"I absolutely love Everwood, and I strongly recommend it to pretty much anyone. My friends and I and basically the whole high school/my town talk about this show like it's 2004. My older sister, and our siblings/ family grew up with Everwood, and now we are. I live in Colorado, in a town really similar to 'Everwood', so maybe that's why we love it so much, because some of my family on the east coast has never even heard of the show. But it is definitely well known even 5 years after it ended where I am. I hate the CW to this day for cancelling it (they probably thought it wasn't enough like gossip girl or whatever the heck is on that channel these days....) I really like One Tree Hill (which was started by the WB--at least CW kept that), so for any fans who like that, I recommend Everwood too. I love every season ( I was able to watch them all on thewb.com, and then bought the dvds as they were released). The 4th season is terrific, btw! and it's being released on June 14th 2011!
