8460659,5,B0057G0X04,"The movie ""The Magic of Ordinary Days"" is a beautiful movie.  I can watch it over and over.  I love the story and anyone else who loves a good old fashioned love story will love it too.  Skeet Ulrich's character is the sweetest most patient man I have every seen.  Keri Russell is just lovely and finally realizes what love is all about.  This move is like a breath of fresh air  -  no violence, sex, filthy language.  It is a good movie that most people (especially women) would love.",1428451200,2,485,4.311111111111111
