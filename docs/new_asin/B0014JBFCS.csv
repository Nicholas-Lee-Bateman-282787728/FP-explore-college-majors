8255889,5,B0014JBFCS,"I have all of Steve's DVDs and this is one of his best. Too many people get side-tracked by ""street"" and gymnastic workouts that most people can never actually do. They fail to notice that no one even slightly overweight is doing any of that nor are they over 30 years of age on average.

This DVD is totally misnamed because it's so much more than just pullups! It's an entire upper body training system that takes rings and pullup bars and gives you moves that most anyone can do in order to build your strength and physique. He also scales the moves so that you can build up to them, making the system accessible to nearly everyone.

Don't be misled by ""stupid human tricks"" being show to you by other gymnastic fitness instructors. Showing off is not building people up. On this DVD, it's very clear that Steve is more interested in building you up rather than just showing off.",1383264000,2,882,4.472049689440993
8255890,5,B0014JBFCS,The best what you can get for your training with rings and pullup bars. Steve Maxwell shows all Special exercises you can do.,1383177600,2,125,4.478260869565218
8255891,5,B0014JBFCS,"This is a good basic video covering various bodyweight exercises for the upper body. Not only does it cover numerous variations of the pull-up, it also covers other  exercise variations to include push-ups, dips, and even core exercises. Most of the exercises are pretty basic but there were a couple that I hadn't seen elsewhere. The only catch is that you will need a pull-up bar and some rings to perform the exercises.

The DVD concludes with a very brief mention of programming. I was disappointed with this section because it was only a couple of minutes long and didn't go into much detail. I also would have liked to see a few sample routines that Steve might recommend.

Overall it's a good video and may be of interest to anyone using bodyweight exercises in their routines.",1282780800,5,784,4.708029197080292
8255892,5,B0014JBFCS,"Steve Maxwell does a great job of describing and showing how to do the difficult exercises in this dvd.  He emphasizes impressive relative body strength that is very un-common.  In today's world, being able to bench press 300 lbs is much more common than being able to do a one-arm chin-up or even to do most of the exercises that Maxwell shows.  However, he does a great job at showing ways to work up to the more difficult exercises.  In this dvd, upper-body bodyweight exercises are implemented and they are all performed on gymnastic rings or a pull-up bar.  As a US Marine Corps Officer in training, these are very important skills to possess. But I recommend this dvd to anyone that wants to possess strength of their own body-weight and wants to improve thier lifts. Because ""mastery of one's self is mastery of one's soul (some zen warrior quote a wise man once said).""",1275609600,4,877,4.632258064516129
