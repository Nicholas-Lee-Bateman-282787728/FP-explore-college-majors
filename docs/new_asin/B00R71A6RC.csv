The effortless singing, the stage presence, the video production quality, the humor, it's all here!

We saw her live in Sacramento a few years ago and this is the next best thing.  What an amazing opportunity for her to perform in her home town with family and friends and the moment is captured on this special DVD.",1424131200,,349,4.596774193548387

6901459,5,B00R71A6RC,Saw this show in Las Vegas in 2013 New Years Eve!!  EXCELLENT,1423267200,2,61,4.083333333333333
6901460,5,B00R71A6RC,"From my previous review of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coming-Home/dp/B00O50QY24/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coming Home</a>&nbsp;CD:

""This concert was also filmed for a PBS special that initially aired on Friday, November 28, 2014 (check local listings). UPDATE: The special was terrific, though two songs on the album, Dolly Parton's ""Little Sparrow"" and Stephen Foster's ""Hard Times Come Again No More"" (a sound clip of the latter was briefly played during the show's introduction) were left out of the special. The three Target bonus tracks were also omitted. Conversely, a song-and-dance number from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Let-Yourself-Go/dp/B000059T4T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Let Yourself Go</a>, ""Going To The Dance With You,"" was featured on the special, but was not on the CD. The concert DVD is currently available as a PBS pledge-drive thank-you-for-your donation gift; according to Kristin's Web site, Concord will release the DVD in February 2015.""

The DVD is here, and it is a delight. It has magnificent sound and picture quality. It features all of the songs from the PBS special, and about 30 minutes of bonus features, including some behind-the-scenes footage, which also appeared on the PBS special; the aforementioned performances of Dolly Parton's ""Little Sparrow"" and Stephen Foster's ""Hard Times Come Again No More"" that were left out of the PBS special; and filmed performances of the three bonus tracks that were included on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Target-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B00PRUOIZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Target Deluxe Edition</a>&nbsp;of the CD: ""I Will Always Love You,"" ""Heart Of The Matter,"" and ""I'll Be Home For Christmas."" There is also a touching Father's Day video that Kristin made for her dad when she had laryngitis while on tour last summer and couldn't talk or sing, so she ""sang"" her Happy Father's Day message using homemade signs. The only thing that the audio CD has that the DVD does not are Kristin's spoken intros to some of the songs.

As I wrote in my earlier review: ""It's a shame that TV variety shows don't exist anymore. But if anyone could bring variety back, it's Kristin. With her singing, dancing (which I wish she would do more of), comedic, and acting talents, she would be a natural for the variety show format. Of course, I have no way of knowing if she would want to do that type of show, or whether the networks would accept it. Maybe she could make a pilot variety special and shop it around.""

If the NFL was smart, they would have hired Kristin to do the halftime show at last year's Super Bowl 50 in San Francisco. I know Kristin is a big college football fan; being from Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, her favorite pro team is probably the Dallas Cowboys. But no matter, a halftime show headlined by Kristin would be one that everyone could enjoy, and would be far more entertaining for most people than Katy Perry ""singing"" about kissing girls and liking it, or having Miley Cyrus or Ariana Grande in various stages of undress. Unfortunately, the No Fun League hired Bruno Mars of ""Uptown Funk"" fame (I'm sick of ""Don't believe me, just watch!""), the execrable Coldplay, featuring Chris Martin (formerly Mr. Gwyneth Paltrow), and added Big-Butt Beyonc to the lineup, where she dropped frequent F-bombs, lambasted police officers, and ""sang"" about hot sauce. Another Super Bowl halftime show that I detested, and I only watched some of the game between the Carolina Panthers and the eventual champion Denver Broncos. The halftime show for Super Bowl LI (won by the New England Patriots in overtime, 34-28, after overcoming a 28-3 deficit against the Atlanta Falcons) was performed by Lady Gaga, and while it was a big improvement over the Big-Butt Beyonc and Katy Perry shows, it still wasn't that great. As her mentor Tony Bennett says, Gaga should stick to singing jazz. I didn't even watch Super Bowl LII, because of my year-long boycott of all things NFL (the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the New England Patriots, 41-33, to win their first Super Bowl and their first NFL title since 1960). For the halftime show, they recycled the forgettable Justin Timberlake, who did a forgettable tribute to Prince. No Janet Jackson sightings, and no wardrobe malfunction. Who's next? Miley ([sobbing] ""Hillary, can I give you a hug?"") Virus? Puh-leeeze. We want Kristin!

Touchdown, Kristin! The hay's in the barn! Five stars all the way! I love you!

I saw Kristin in person at Wolf Trap Farm Park in Vienna, Virginia on August 28, 2015. She was superb, as always. This is the third time that I have seen Kristin live; the other two concerts were at Wolf Trap in 2003 and at Washington D.C.'s DAR Constitution Hall in 2012.",1423008000,13,4846,5.319843342036553

6901485,5,B00R71A6RC,Simply stunning. Kristin is nothing short  of a Broadway Sweetheart. I really enjoyed this live recording of the concert in her hometown of Broken Arrow I only wish that the additional songs (which thankfully are available in the extras section on the DVD) could have been included in the actual concert. She does a truly heartbreaking rendition of Dolly Parton's 'Little Sparrow.' Kristin really knows how to deliver and interpret a song.,1440806400,,439,5.097222222222222

6901494,5,B00R71A6RC,"I took a chance by buying this DVD because I was looking for something different from what I would normally watch and I'm so glad that I bought it.  I've watch parts of it at least twice a week because it's just so refreshing to see a performer who doesn't do or say anything offensive in their show.  I'm a fan of great singers like Garland, Sinatra and more modern ones like Celine Dion, Michael Bublle and Josh Groban and others and I've heard of Kristin Chenoweth, but I hadn't really followed here career.  I heard the soundtrack to this DVD and decided that I wanted to see the concert and seeing it is better than just hearing the soundtrack for sure.  Some of the highlights include her song Popular sung in several languages in her fun, quirky way. Another shining moment is when she has a young girl come on stage and they sing a duet of For Good and the girl delivers her part like a seasoned pro and then Kristin invites choir students from her old high school to perform her rendition of Upon This Rock and that was really uplifting.  I would love to see more of her live musical performances if someone would just release more of them on DVD, especially the Broadway performances.  Surely, some of them were filmed.  They really need to be released, please!",1436832000,,1271,4.452586206896552

6901498,5,B00R71A6RC,This is Kristin Chenoweth's best work ever in my opinion. I purchased the first one off of a PBS pledge for a lot of money and then found this one on Amazon a month or so later.  It features her in her own home town singing with some of the high school choir and it is so heart wrenching. Wonderful song choices and you never want it to end.,1434499200,,341,3.9420289855072466

I wanted to see the school choir, Ms. Birdwell & the young lady that Kristin discovered as well as Kristin & her backup singers.  I wanted to see everything.  I was not disappointed.  It was everything I had hoped  for and more.  I am so happy that I bought this DVD.  5 stars are definitely  not enough.",1431907200,,462,4.112359550561798

Her soprano, while in tune, hit my ear just one bubble shy of plumb.  It is my taste I am sharing.  Her talent is adequate, but there is just something a little too shrill and screechy in her delivery.  I was disappointed. I was looking forward to a more enjoyable performance.  Instead, I turned off the DVD and played a Bernadette Peter's CD. She is brilliant!",1428019200,,519,4.354166666666667

Kristin's voice is stunning, and this is such a warm and intimate concert being that she recorded it in her hometown of Broken Arrow, OK.

6901529,5,B00R71A6RC,"The lovely, pint-sized yet infinitely-talented Kristin Chenoweth returns to her hometown of Broken Arrow, OK (a Tulsa suburb) to perform before a capacity audience at the performing arts center bearing her name in this program originally televised on PBS during last Thanksgiving weekend.  She applies her glorious soprano voice to a vast repertoire encompassing Broadway, Hollywood, gospel, folk, country and saluting her idols (including Julie Andrews, Dolly Parton, Judy Garland, Liza Minnelli, Sarah Brightman, Barbra Streisand, and even Donna Summer), accompanied on several numbers by the Broken Arrow High School Choir, of which Kristin is perhaps the most distinguished alumna.  A song-and-dance trio consisting of Chelsea Packard, Will Taylor, and Tyler Hanes (who also supplied choreography) also provides superlative backup.  Kristin's Broadway colleague Mary-Mitchell Campbell is the most able musical director, and High School Musical's Kenny Ortega has directed the entire production.  Of course Kristin re-creates two of her features from Broadway's Wicked:  ""Popular"", which she sings in German, Japanese, Chinese, and Italian; and the duet ""For Good"", in which the part originally sung by Idina Menzel is adeptly covered by a local music student (whom Kristin requests to remove her shoes!).  The DVD also contains bonus features, including Kristin's backstage tribute to Whitney Houston with Parton's ""I Will Always Love You"".  This spring, Kristin returns to the Great White Way for the first time in five years with the 1978 Cy Coleman/Betty Comden/Adolph Green musical On the Twentieth Century, in which she will be playing the role created by another of her idols, the late Madeline Kahn, for whom she named her dog.",1425081600,4,1738,5.5606060606060606

8694370,4,B00R71A6RC,A big talent and a great concert but once again  PBS has culled out some of the content and shoved in as extras. As a souvenir of a concert that I had seen this made it less of an event. People do have longer attention spans than an hour or so. Should have been marked as edited version,1510790400,,286,3.9310344827586206
