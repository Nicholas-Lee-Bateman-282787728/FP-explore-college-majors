8561456,2,B00022AIG2,"I have done a lot of reading about the Everglades and southern Florida; I find the material fascinating.  But I have never seen the area and probably won't.  I had hoped I was purchasing a DVD of scenery, traveling through the area by boat, a little history, etc. I also hoped to see a few of the homes and people living inside the Big Swamp, but that is not the intent of this DVD.  It focuses on the animal life of the area with up-close pictures of their daily life, including mating and feeding habits.  The animal photography is excellent,very suitable for using in a teaching setting.  But not the travelog I had hoped for.  The product description should have been more accurate.  The cost is high.",1255132800,6,705,4.503937007874016
