7799812,5,1596684720,"Although short, this DVD has a good deal of useful information. Maggie Casey is warm and friendly, and very knowledgeable on the subject, and it comes across here. This would be the perfect video for someone completely new to handspinning; for someone with a little more experience, there are moments where it seems slow, but that is to be expected.

Sometimes I put this on *while* I'm spinning, to listen and watch ""in the background,"" and I still sometimes pick up on things I didn't remember, or didn't notice before, so I'm still learning from it. I'm very pleased with my purchase.",1370995200,13,587,4.754901960784314
