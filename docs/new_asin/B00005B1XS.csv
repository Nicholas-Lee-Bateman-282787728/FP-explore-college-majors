1419569,3,B00005B1XS,"I bought this dvd because I believed it to be the original documentary directed by John Ford.  Instead it was a program I had seen earlier, I think on the History Channel that used footage from Ford's movie.  The interviews and additional footage was interesting and helpful I suppose but it was not what I thought I ordered.  Still trying to find a copy of Torpedo Squadron 8 also directed by Ford for my collection.",1127520000,18,417,4.533333333333333

1419571,5,B00005B1XS,"Unfortunately, there seems to be some confusion about this video tape. This is not the classic film made during the war about the Battle of Midway, but rather this is one of the films
about famous battles of World War II from the ""Battlefield"" series.  This series gives a comprehensive view of the battle from the point of view of the upper echelons conducting the war.  The battle is explained within its context as part the wider stragtegic issues of the war.  A considerable part of the film deals with the lead-up to the battle including discussion of the political and military leadership of the opposing sides, the weapons involved and the military action preceding the battle.  In this film, the Battle of the Coral Sea is discussed in detail as a prelude to Midway.  The Battle of Midway was an extremely complex engagement that is hard to follow even when reading detailed descriptions of the battle in books.  This film makes the battle and its various components clear to the viewer.  This film certainly made me appreciate the genius of naval air power commanders such as Halsey, Spruance, and Fletcher who had to move around large numbers of ships and aircraft in both attack and defense at the same time.  This series is highly recommended for someone who has more than just a passing interest in the Second World War.",1087257600,53,1333,4.740259740259741
1419572,4,B00005B1XS,"I feel that ""Battle of Midway"" is unique amongst films of this genre, in that it shows how even the smallest decisions made by admirals or captains on either sides of the battlelines can have such a devestating impact on the overall outcome. To give a perfect example, how one commanders decision to equip their fighters with bombs as opposed to torpedoes (or vice-a-versa) could be the hingpin that holds their battleplan together, or the mistake that tears it apart. Take it from an ex-sailor, the depictions of naval combat in this film are as close to real as a filmaker could probably get, especially considering the era the film was made in. Add to all this the all star cast that reads like a whos who of hollywood, you won't find a better film in this genre. To sum it up, this was the ""Pearl Harbor"" of the 70's!",992995200,7,821,4.48

1419620,5,B00005B1XS,"The film footage is so amazing. The photographers were in the thick of battle, some were wounded, some did not come back. But the footage was used. It is raw. No special effects here. It is the real deal. In some cases, the explosions were so near and so violent, the film in the camera comes off the reel and the images become jittery and distorted. In other cases it appears the cameraman is knocked unconscious and the camera just dangles around from their neck over a bomb crater. John Ford has done an amazing job of putting this footage together with a sound track that at times reflects the action on the screen and at other times leads the viewer to the next scene. The combination of gritty visceral real footage along with such artistic presentation makes this one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. Highly recommended.",1394064000,4,838,4.593333333333334

1419642,2,B00005B1XS,"The ""movies"", especially The Battle of Midway, are uninteresting.  Midway shows none of the important naval & naval air action.  You can't blame the photographers for not being right in the thick of the action; but whoever made this film deserves blame for making a movie so dull, peripheral, and disjointed.
Global War was just OK.  In thirty minutes it displays glimpses of military actions all over the world.
I was hoping to learn something from these movies.  No such luck.
To learn about WWII, one does better to see a regular movie.  Some which come to mind are Pearl Harbor, Midway, Sands of Iwo Jima, Clint Eastwood's two films, A Bridge too Far, The Longest Day, Saving Private Ryan, Windtalkers, etc., etc., etc.  All of these are informative, very interesting.  Some, because the topic is a huge war, get bloody, and of course there's more violence than some persons care to see.
p.s.  Some of the reviews shown below do not apply to this DVD, but to other versions of the battle of Midway.",1361836800,,1002,4.685714285714286
1419653,3,B00005B1XS,This movie is a good / bad story line that sort of makes you glad when it's over.  The basic story line ---the battle of Midway--is done fairly well although somewhat stilted while the secondary story line--the aviator son and his Japanese girl friend --is so corny that it ruins the the story line.  Also the outtakes from Tora Tora Tora are not too bad.,1361491200,,355,4.446153846153846
1419654,4,B00005B1XS,"This Discovery Channel account of the Battle of Midway largely focusses on the battle and deals only superficially with the strategic context in which the most important battle of the Pacific War took place. The battle coverage is excellent and much of it is in colour. This documentary also includes excellent computer graphics and interviews with men who flew the American warplanes at Midway, including the famous Lieutenant Commander Richard Halsey Best who participated in the sinking of two Japanese carriers at Midway - the Japanese flagship Akagi and the Hiryu.

The producers have done an excellent job of examining and explaining the course of an historic and very complex naval battle; but the documentary fails to explain adequately the reasons for the defeat that turned the tide against the previously victorious Japanese Navy.

The producers mention that the carrier-launched Doolittle Raid on Japan on 18 April 1942 did more than boost American morale. Although the damage to Japan was slight, the Doolittle Raid stunned Japan and the Japanese high command. The admirals of Japan's Imperial Navy had assured Emperor Hirohito that Japan's home islands would never be touched by American retaliation for Pearl Harbor. The red-faced admirals had failed to keep that pledge to their emperor. Japan's Navy General Staff and the Army General Staff had previously not supported Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's plan to destroy the carriers of the US Pacific Fleet at far distant Midway Atoll in the central Pacific. The Japanese high command suspected that Yamamoto intended his Midway operation to be the first step in an ambitious operation to capture Hawaii. These suspicions were well founded. The Japanese Imperial Navy had long planned for the decisive conflict between the Japanese and American navies to take place close to Japanese occupied territory so that land-based bombers could support the Japanese fleet. After the Doolittle Raid, the Japanese high command threw its weight fully behind Yamamoto's plan and gave it top priority.

The decision to support Yamamoto's Midway operation threw Japan's Pacific strategy completely off balance. Prior to Doolittle, Japan's highest priority in the Pacific had been to secure Australia's isolation and surrender by blockade and bombing. Now that priority would be shared with an all out effort to destroy the carriers of the US Pacific Fleet at Midway. Although giving their backing to Yamamoto's Midway operation, Navy General Staff was not prepared to defer action to isolate Australia from the United States. Navy General Staff saddled Yamamoto's Combined Fleet with three major naval operations to be set in train simultaneously: (1) the capture of Australia's Port Moresby; (2) the Midway operation to destroy the US Pacific Fleet carriers; and (3) capture of islands in the Alaskan Aleutian chain. This documentary mistakenly suggests that the Aleutian operation was part of Yamamoto's initial planning for his Midway operation as a diversion to distract American attention from Midway. In fact, the Alaskan operation originated from Navy General Staff, and it was intended to prevent the United States obtaining access to Russian bases from which American heavy bombers could strike Japan. Although the Alaskan operation was not his own plan, Yamamoto accepted it as being a useful diversion of attention from Midway.

The strategic importance of the Doolittle Raid lies in the fact that it caused the Japanese to set in train simultaneously three widely separated major naval offensives, and breach the fundamental military principle of concentrating force to win battles.

This documentary does not acknowledge three critical blunders by the Japanese: (1) the Japanese Midway/Alaska plan was overly complex; (2) the Japanese assumed that the Americans would respond to the simultaneous Japanese offensives at Midway and Alaska as the Japanese wanted them to respond; and (3) the dispersal of the massive Japanese naval armada into five separate formations scattered over thousands of miles of ocean denied any one formation support from another formation when it ran into difficulty as happened to Japan's First Carrier Striking Force on 4 June 1942.

The documentary mentions the Coral Sea and the damage to the fleet carrier USS Yorktown that had to be repaired quickly to enable Yorktown to participate in the Battle of Midway; but its fails to mention that Coral Sea almost certainly played an important role in the Japanese defeat at Midway. Admiral Yamamoto had intended to attack Midway Atoll and the US Pacific Fleet with the same six powerful fleet carriers that attacked Pearl Harbor. He foolishly allowed the fleet carriers Shokaku and Zuikaku to be diverted in early May 1942 to cover the capture of Port Moresby. The timing of the Port Moresby operation was not crucial, and it should have been postponed to a date after the Midway operation in June 1942. This blunder cost the Japanese dearly. Bomb damage and aircraft losses suffered at Coral Sea deprived Admiral Yamamoto of Shokaku and Zuikaku for his attack on Midway Atoll which had to be undertaken with only four fleet carriers, and consequently, the margin of superiority over the American carriers at Midway (three) was significantly reduced by Coral Sea.

The documentary pursues a factually incorrect view that the flight decks of the four Japanese carriers were packed with bombers preparing to attack the American carriers when American SBD dive-bombers struck and destroyed the fleet carriers Akagi, Kaga, and Soryu. In fact, the flight decks of all four Japanese carriers had been cleared for the combat air patrol Zeros to land, refuel, rearm, and relaunch to combat low level American torpedo bomber attacks. There were no bombers on the decks of the three carriers when they received fatal American bomb strikes. The false picture of activity on the Japanese carrier flight decks appears to have arisen from an account of the battle by Commander Mitsuo Fuchida who appears to have been motivated by a desire to avoid an appearance that the Japanese carrier fleet had been thrown completely off balance by repeated American air attacks, as indeed it had been. See Fuchida and Okumiya:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midway-The-Battle-That-Doomed-Japan/dp/B000W4K0VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midway: The Battle That Doomed Japan</a>. Fuchida's claim that the Japanese carrier flight decks were packed with bombers is not supported by the official Japanese history of the Pacific War Senshi Sosho. Even if Fuchida had given a true account of activity on the Japanese flight decks it would not have altered the outcome of the American dive-bomber attacks. The Japanese flight decks contained Zeros fighters and open fuel lines. Bombs and torpedoes were littered about and had not been returned to the carrier's magazines. The Japanese carriers still resembled highly combustible powder kegs.

I recommend this documentary to those who are primarily interested in an excellent and very clear coverage of the battle itself.",1356739200,8,7113,5.390287769784172
