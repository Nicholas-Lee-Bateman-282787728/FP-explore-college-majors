8165277,1,B000LXSALW,"I teach research methods for behavioral sciences and was looking for an ethics video for the class. Unfortunately after watching this I realized it was completely unusable. It looks as if a novice filmmaker put together this film with a cardboard background behind the actors and poorly scripted information. I know I'm not the most entertaining person in the world, but lecturing this information is far more effective and entertaining than the video. Don't waste your money.",1307232000,,476,5.194805194805195
