831503,5,6304291701,"This movie starts out wonderfully as the swiss family Robinson are trapped in a room on a ship in a huge ship. The captain abandons the ship in fear it might sink but the boat merely crashes into some rocks. When the family gets out of the room, they notice that land is not to far away. They quickly build a tropical paradise. This movie is fun for children and families. It deserves the five stars I gave it.
I recommend this film to fans of 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, Treasure Island, Kidnapped, and Escape To Witch Mountain.",993081600,3,531,4.373737373737374
831504,4,6304291701,"Though as an adult you may find yourself twitching a bit during this  slightly overlong adventure tale, children from any era will find it  mesmerizing.  The Disney-ification of this classic Verne adventure tale is  filled with innocent thrills, and features sets and adventures that make  children drool -- they are, quite simply, fantasy adventures come to life.  You will easily understand why the Swiss Family Robinson Treehouse remains  a fixture at the Magic Kingdom -- is it possible to conceive and imagine  and create a more perfectly fabulous place for castaways to live? Dorothy  Maguire and John Mills transcend some of the corn with their sturdy and  oh-so-appealing portrayals of upright parents suddenly thrust into a  terrifying -- and challenging -- new place to raise their children.  How  about that watering hole???",968198400,6,835,5.234848484848484

831714,5,6304291701,"Great movie that I remember watching as a kid. When you can't stand watching the ridiculous computer generated cartoons kids get addicted to these days, try this. A real movie with real humans, plants and animals that is in my opinion more appropriate for kids to watch than most ""family friendly"" movies. Not 100% politically correct if you are a social justice warrior snowflake but my 4 year old loves it and has gotten him away from the ultra childish kids movies and TV shows that rot brains regardless of age. Adults can watch this too without feeling like it is just a kids movie so it will keep you interested and off of your phone etc. Even after watching it several times. Way less violent/scary than Harry Pooper",1515024000,,723,4.612403100775194

831819,5,6304291701,"I am on a classic Disney rag right now as I've DVR'd a bunch of Disney movies that TCM had aired the other day. I hadn't seen Swiss Family Robinson in such a long time, it became a whole new viewing experience for me. Disney's 1960 adaptation is a very loose one of Johann Wyss' classic adventure novel. After all these years, it's still very much an absorbing watch.

It's a sanitized tale of survival, very much catered towards a younger audience. Set in the early 1800s, the Swiss family, the Robinsons, fretful of Napoleon Bonaparte's increasingly ambitious reach, leave their home in Bern to seek a new life in a colony in New Guinea. But their ship is chased by pirates straight into a raging storm. The ship's crew abandon the capsizing ship, leaving the Robinsons to fend for themselves.

Johann Wyss wrote this book to impart to his sons certain lessons on family, good husbandry, hard work, and self-reliance, virtues with which he imbues his characters. Father and Mother Robinson (John Mills, Dorothy McGuire) are blessed with three strapping sons. We're made privy to the family's resourcefulness and teamwork as they cobble together a raft from the detritus of the ship's wreckage. From jump we're alerted to the high level of excitement the movie means to deliver as pater and sons guide the raft thru turbulent waters and safely on to shore.

The movie is stunningly photographed in the West Indies, on the tropical island of Tobago. For the Robinsons, it's a whole new world what's festooned with a colorful explosion of flora and teeming with a diversity of wildlife. There's huge, huge fun in watching the family quickly adapt to life on a deserted isle, the menfolk treating it as a lark, genteel Mother understandably not as enthused.

I tell you, this movie fulfills every little boy's fantasy. There's no magic, no science-fiction elements. No ""You're a wizard, Harry!"" No ""You're a video gamer what's needed to save an alien race by playing video games."" Swiss Family Robinson deals in more practical scenarios, never mind that its imagination soars high above the clouds. The deeds performed in this movie - the scavenging, the salvaging, the homebuilding, the day-to-day surviving - are achievable by any nervy, industrious, able-bodied child. I know because I loved this movie as a child. It triggered my imagination and sense of play. I actually prayed to be stranded on a desert island just so I could apply the things I'd learned from the movie. The movie's centerpiece is easily the epic family treehouse of which reveal constitutes the best tour ever of a domicile. I remember being amazed at how running water was achieved by cunningly fashioned culverts, and that makeshift skylight in the master bedroom, and the sink made out of tortoise shell.

What to say about the cast, other than that I effortlessly bought into their characters. Oh, there are points of trivia. John Mills is Hayley Mills' father. The younger actors were, at the time, familiar faces on Disney television shows and motion pictures: James MacArthur (Kidnapped) as the brawny oldest son Fritz; Tommy Kirk (The Shaggy Dog, Old Yeller) as the brainy middle offspring; Kevin Corcoran (The Shaggy Dog, Pollyanna) as the adventurous youngest son Francis; and Janet Munro (Darby O'Gill and the Little People) as ""Bertie"" the unconvincing cabin boy. In other news, Sessue Hayakawa, who made some noise some years before in The Bridge on the River Kwai, plays the big bad pirate chief Kuala. He alarmed me so much when I was a kid watching this.

Breathe in that piquant bouquet of nostalgia. Be transported to your childhood, when all things were possible and the world was opened up. Thrill with the Robinsons at play as they swing on vines over lakes and revel in ostrich races. Hold your breath as they tangle with tigers and sharks and giant swamp snakes, and as they bravely repel pirate attacks with muskets and coconut bombs and clever traps and, once, with a quarantine flag (a very nice trick). For the young girls, there is a teen romantic triangle that the boys in the audience may hoot at and chafe against, grown restless until the next action beat. Thankfully, there's plenty of action beats. If nothing else, that kid Francis seems to get into a scrape every thirty seconds, hell bent as he is to collect his own personal menagerie of exotic beasts, never mind that elephants and tigers and ostriches can step on him like he was so much Bubblicious.",1505260800,,4463,4.850393700787402

This movie has a great family feel to it and I really liked the animal races; it is a classic Disney. Do not dwell on where all the animals came from. The pirate attack scene was suspenseful and gives new meaning to log off. You are kept wondering if, and how they will get out of the precarious situation.

Be sure to watch John Mills play a more serious role with his real daughter Hayley Mills in ""The Chalk Garden"" (1964).",1502496000,,640,4.556521739130435

We watch it several times a year and love it every time.  I still remember going to Disney as a kid and again when I was 16 and waited in line to see their tree house. I would love to live the way they did! What could be better than simple, wholesome living?  A time where people were polite and it was okay to have gender roles.
It has just enough scary, suspenseful parts to keep my kids very entertained.  The tree house they build is amazing.  Mother is beautiful and full of class.  Father is strong and so good natured.  The three sons are just boys, love to have fun but find mischief.  They have a great family unit and love each other and are willing to do anything to protect one another.  The scenery is beautiful too.  I can honestly say this may be Disney's best movie! I can see why Mother, Father and Francis stay on the island.

Still, it's nice to see it looking better than before. Some scenes really pop, others not so much.  As you must already know, bare bones disk, just the movie, and that's it. Hard to justify the cost unless you are a big fan of the film, as I am. I just resent the second class treatment, this great film deserves better.",1456272000,8,553,4.421568627450981

However, since this was my first movie I ordered from Prime, I didn't realize the hassle of getting it on my TV to watch. Long story short, I figured it out via laptop and HDMI cord. You can't just zap it from your phone app to the TV as I had thought it to be.
The movie itself was just as I had remembered. Beautiful, funny, and a great family movie. I forgot how sexist it was but it was made in the 60's based on a book written a long time ago. Other than that, great! Must see Disney movie for the family.",1445990400,,599,3.958677685950413

Would they not sell more movies if the price was reasonable and there were more ""extras"" for all that money? I saw a friends Blu-ray version and it is stunning. I also just watched a restored HD version of Old Yeller on the INSP channel. A lot of grandparents would buy these to share with their grandchildren if the price gouging was not such a factor. When we can buy these movies at a reasonable price I'll give it 5 stars but until then 3 stars because greed is a sin.

Is she getting married or committed at age 14?  Did I hear that right?  The son didn't even ask her to stay, she just starts kissing him and that is that... Hmm...

It does strike me now how they were able to get the animals to cooperate/behave for the film...it was made in the early 60s but a lot of the scenes I re-watched were a bit rough to view as an adult...Like Francis riding on the Elephant and hitting his bum with the stick...just seems wrong now.",1438300800,,409,4.049382716049383

Why Disney Inc. persists in NOT releasing any of its live action back catalog  via legitimate mainstream hi-def discs is a mystery.

I was surprised that the movie depicted pirates being shot & dying - but in true Disney style, they died tidily & their bodies didn't seem to hang around afterwards!  This is also not a movie to show your daughters about strong pioneer women.  We were all dying laughing about the prissy, incompetent women in the movie.  However, the kids have been out in the trees in our backyard ever since - making their own island community.  Good fun!",1397433600,,576,4.663366336633663

It wasn't so much the lack of $10 that hurt so much, it was the laughter. And the fact that she chaperoned us on the first date of my life. Seriously mom.

So now that my boy is 7yo, I told him that if he ever needs, y'know, $80 to take some little hottie to a movie and dinner, just let me know. And since this classic hasn't been in the theaters for 40 years, take a load off and let's watch it. And we did. And he loved it.

The animals? Makes no sense, but hilarious.

The child actors working so physically? Adults too? Not thinking that would fly without CGI these days. Distracted from the actual movie wondering how they did those stunts, or if the actors were seriously the toughest actors EVER. Those were the days! Lets go outside and play!!!

Ever drop a small log on your foot on the way to a campfire? Seriously, truck-loads of giant timber or boulders rolling over pirates who get up and run away, or come back for more?

Despite a little overacting here and there, I would say that this has got to be one of the most charming family-ish* films ever made.
* - I say family-ish simply because there may be some legitimately scary parts for younger children.

** I do have to give a bit of warning to people who are sensitive to any kind of animal cruelty. If you think that you may have a problem watching two dogs attacking a tiger, seeing an baby elephant being trapped by it's leg, or geese being lifted by their necks then you may want to pass on this film -though I still feel like this is a fine film-. **

A film that has enough action and humor (sometimes not intentionally) that it nearly stands with other great action films such as Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.  Almost everyone will find something that they will like about this film such as the variety of animals represented, the goofiness of the youngest son, watching the family working together for each other, or even the epic pirate battle.",1385510400,8,1024,4.489247311827957

837387,5,6304291701,"The Robinson family (consisting of father, mother, two teen sons, and a boy about 7) suffers ship wreck on the doorstep of a tropical island paradise.  Without much hope of immediate rescue, they set up housekeeping using the remains of ship fittings and furniture which fortunately include, among other things, an organ (that the mother can play), a beautiful tea set, other fine dishes, and apparently even a pretty 19th century-style salvaged wardrobe for the mother! (But some inventive leaf and straw clothing turns up later in the story, as well.)  The males cleverly build a nice tri-partite tree house, which any kid and most adults would really LOVE to have for their own!

(Is better than any ""Peter Pan"" tree house that I've seen.)

The tale abounds with animals, both domestic and wild.  The youngest boy is an unsinkable adventurer who brings home charming animals as family pets.  There are rollicking races in which even wild ostriches serve as steeds for the children.  (These are fascinating scenes, unique--I haven't seen anything like them before.)

Paradise is not without its evil-serpentish element, though, and some terrifying pirates come onto the scene.  There is a romantic sub-plot in which a teen-age boy turns out to be a teen-age girl.

I'm not sure if this story is still considered a Classic of Children's Literature--so much has come along in recent times to push out the classic stories (and traditional fairy tales) that children used to learn.  This movie, so charmingly created by Disney Studios, is rather old now but I think it would still probably appeal to young children from about ages 7-11, especially because of the tree house and the many fascinating domestic and wild animals.  (After seeing it, some kids may beg their parents for  baby elephants and monkeys.  I know I would have done.)  Adults may find the story a bit slow or boring, but would probably enjoy viewing it if doing so along with their children.

This is a MUCH better story and movie than ""Treasure Island,"" which has some similar elements (mainly pirates) and was made roughly around the same time.

All things considered, it's a delightful movie with lots of innocent fun, well worth seeing.  Over-all enforces non-materialistic values--the ""simple"" happy life close to nature.

Might be able to pick up some practical hints to aid in wilderness survival, but not much.",1344556800,,2386,4.97979797979798

They manage to get themselves and all their belongings and animals ashore, intact and none the worse for wear.

The mother, played by the lovely Dorothy McGuire, is always clean, perfectly groomed and coiffed. The father, played by the wonderful English actor, John Mills, is positively cheerful the entire film. Talk about optimism.

Somehow, they manage to get a pipe organ off the wrecked ship, ashore, and up into their multi-level tree house, so that they can sing Christmas Carols at the appropriate time. Kevin Corcoran even has a baby elephant for a pet, and they parade around their sculpted lawn which is surrounded by what appears to be a manicured, English country garden.

837532,5,6304291701,"This is a review of the VHS version. No one ever made such a fun experience out of getting shipwrecked on a deserted island. What a movie, and Disney has done a great job of remastering the original movie for the DVD release. It looks new again.

Originally released in 1960, the film returned to theaters 4 times in later years due it's popularity with the public. This is absolutely one of the most fun family films the Walt Disney Studios ever made. There is truly something for everyone... comedy, action, adventure, drama, romance, and suspense. Even at 126 minutes in length, it neve feels too long. The story is - Starting in the aftermath of a shipwreck, the Swiss family rebuilds their life on an uncharted tropical island. They use the wealth of ships salvage in livestock, tools, guns, furniture, wood, and more to build a safe home in the trees, complete with running water and other conveniences. The mother and father begin an ideal existence with their 3 boys aged 9, 16, and 18. They capture and train wild animals and learn to harvest local food. The youngest boy is a wonder with animals, and this brave little rascal even captures a baby elephant. The menagerie leads to a famous scene where a zebra, ostrich, dog, and elephant carry riders in a race. But one day the older boys decide to take a canoe and survey the rest of the huge island. They stumble across pirates that are attacking the crew of a ship, and rescue the captain's daughter, bringing the wrath of the pirates on them since they are discovered. Returning to their home on the other side of the island, the family tries to hide their location. Eventually they are found out but trick the pirates into leaving with a few bluffs. They know the pirates will return again so the castaways build fortifications, weapons, and traps to help them to oppose the large numbers of pirates they expect soon in a final climactic battle.

Directed by Ken Annakin, the movie was filmed on location on the Caribbean island of Tobago. Mr. Disney had high hopes for this movie and had done extensive planning and design in advance of filming. While the production went way over budget for a total cost of $4 million, Walt did not get upset with his production team at the time since the film was looking to be success when he reviewed clips from the set.  As it turned out, with subsequent theatre releases, television, and video airing, the film has turned out to be one of the top-grossing films from Disney.

The tropical scenery is spectacular as they filmed all over the island; waterfalls, forests, grass plains, flowers, beaches, cliffs, mountains, oceans, streams, and much more. Contributing a tremendous amount to the exotic locale of the movie are animals, pirates, ships, and a tree house to beat all tree houses ever made. Similar to the role the submarine ""Nautilus"" filled in the earlier film ""20,000 Leagues Below the Sea"", the tree house becomes a star in it's own right. The wonderful and inventive home designed by the castaways and from the ships salvage is incredible to behold.

Featuring a wonderful cast and crew assembled by Walt himself, Mr. Disney liked to stick with actors he knew could relate to a broad audience. Most of the actors in this film appeared in other Disney movies over the years, many times with other actors from this film. The principles are Hayley Mills (Pollyana, Parent Trap, That Darn Cat, Summer Magic, In Search of the Castaways, The Moon-Spinners), Dorothy McGuire (Old Yeller, Summer Magic), John Mills (did not appear in other Disney movies, but was Hayley's real life father), James MacArthur (Light in the Forest, Third Man on the Mountain, Kidnapped), Kevin Corcoran (A Tiger Walks, Savage Sam, Old Yeller, The Shaggy Dog, Bon Voyage, Babes in Toyland, Toby Tyler, Pollyanna), Tommy Kirk (Probably the most active of all with Savage Sam, Old Yeller, The Shaggy Dog, Moon Pilot, Bon Voayage, Son of Flubber, The Absent-Minded Professor, Misadventures of Merlin Jones, The Monkeys Uncle, Babes in Toyland), and Janet Munroe (Darby O'Gill and the Little People, Third Man on the Mountain). Most of these actors also appeared in movies for the Disney television series as well.

I highly recommend, but make sure you also consider at the ""Vault Disney"" version of this film on DVD, it is loaded with hours of extras!",1111536000,5,4338,4.785046728971962
