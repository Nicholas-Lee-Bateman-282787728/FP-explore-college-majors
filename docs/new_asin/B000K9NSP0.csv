8155172,3,B000K9NSP0,"mediocre, low budget Iraq war movie.

4 marines on patrol are ambushed. one marine is killed and another is missing, presumed captive. the remaining two marines decide to try to walk back to base.

at the beginning of the movie the same few names were repeatedly in the credits which can often tell you a lot about a movie.

not much to be learned here.",1416873600,,353,4.4

8155174,2,B000K9NSP0,"JUST A TERRIBLE MOVIE. POOR ACTING, VIDEO QUALITY AND AUDIO NOT GOOD EITHER.

8155175,5,B000K9NSP0,"This is a basic but well-produced documentary that reveals problems that many US citizens are forced to deal with while living near the US-Mexico border and shows that these problems eventually affect all US citizens. I recommend this without hesitation to those who want to convince others of the dangers of allowing a massive, demographically very dissimilar flow of migrants. I really want this to be shown to American university students.

This documentary stands out because it addresses two important issues that are ignored in mainstream immigration discussions. These issues are 1) a relatively concise explanation of a certain group's disproportionate support of lax immigration policies that disadvantage the majority and 2) the far-reaching demographic consequences that will permanently alter the character of the USA.

This film provides an outlet for the thoughts of Americans who have to deal with the reality of a massive influx of foreign migrants into their communities. It is relatively unbiased, but people who don't see the value of preserving the USAs demographic, environmental, and economic integrity will be disappointed by the lack of focus on the migrants and their enablers. This will suit most level-headed folks just fine, as there is already an extremely disproportionate focus given to these  perspectives by the mainstream media system.

Highly recommended and many thanks to its creators for getting to the meat of the argument and giving a voice to average folk who really have no voice in either major political party.

PS: regarding the two previous negative reviews, there is nothing racist about this documentary, although one can't prove that, because that term is meaningless anyway.",1220054400,3,1724,5.394052044609666
8155176,1,B000K9NSP0,"I expected to gain some objective insight into how people on the border are living with illegal immigration. But it didn't take long to understand that this film is white nationalist propaganda. Don't waste your time, unless you're a neo-nazi.",1192492800,,243,5.1
8155177,1,B000K9NSP0,"These documentaries are only reinforcing economic imperialists' perspectives and stereotypes. From the beginnings of our nation, immigrants have been used and abused for the economic gains of the Man. Why? This country's self-acclaimed emperors have sucked out the physical and cultural riches of developing countries. We have built this country and we are the first to step to the plate when defending the ideals of this country. Why? We have spent over 87 billion on this war--when the UN has proclaimed we could cover the expenses to provide the entire WORLD w/clean water, good diets, K-12 education and even child immunization for less than half of that cost! 24,000 people worldwide die EVERYDAY due to hunger. About 3,000 died on 9/11. AND we wonder why this country becomes a target for so-called terrorism. People who are unaware of what Economic Hit Men do are ignorant, and that's not to put anybody down. When you are relying on the biased media, anything on the news or papers is just misinformation. Know your history/HERSTORY and then proclaim. BTW, we are not immigrants in this country. This is my ancestors' land and we certainly are not no ""aliens."" Must we forget, who were the ones in search of ""religious freedom"" and then taking out the Natives of this country only to falsely proclaim these lands as theirs. Treat people as humans with dignity and respect. To pay people who are willing to work menial wages and abuse their human rights is to laugh in their face. When will racism and discrimination come to an end. Will we ever achieve peace, freedom and justice?",1192233600,,1588,4.885185185185185
8155178,5,B000K9NSP0,"""The line in the sand"" is the best documentary about illegal immigration I have seen yet. In my opinion, every American should have to watch it in order to know what is really going on. Lot of people only care about short-term benefits such as cheap labor but totally forget or ignore the problems and long-term effects associated with illegal immigration. I highly recommend this DVD.",1171843200,5,385,4.848484848484849
