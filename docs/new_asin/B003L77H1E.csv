4138509,5,B003L77H1E,"We've enjoyed Psych since the first episode. I'm sure you know the backstory. A policeman's son who was trained to be observant during his youth notices a few clues on TV coverage of a crime scene. When he phones in his tips, he makes himself a person of interest in the case. To dodge becoming a full-fledged suspect, he makes up a story about being psychic, and the show is born.

For five years we've followed the merry adventures of Shawn and Gus as they catch murderers, taunt ""Lassie"", ogle girls, and drop pop culture references that at times go well beyond their ages. LOL

I thought that seasons three and four arguably had become a little stale. Not so stale that we didn't still enjoy and laugh at the shows, but they at least weren't as surprising in the mysteries and clever dialogue as when the show was brand new. Perhaps Shawn's antics when he went into a fake psychic episode had begun to wear thin. I think the creative forces behind the show also came to that conclusion, as in season five Shawn is more disposed to calmly putting his fingers to his temple to report a ""psychic clue"", rather than launch into hysterical dialogue and action.

Whatever the case, the show came roaring back in season five with some of the very best episodes of the entire series. Highlights:

""Extradition II"", with Cary Elwes as the suave and super skilled thief Pierre Despereaux, was inspired.

""In Plain Fright"" puts Shawn and Gus at odds with virtually everyone when Shawn sees a murder on a Halloween ride at the local amusement park, but the absence of the body hinders his desire to investigate and to call in backup.

""Viagra Falls"", where Shawn and Gus alternately team up with and contend with two retired detectives when a closed case regains life, is a hilarious take on what happens when a set of active ""buddy cops"" get along in years.

""Shawn 2.0"" introduces a brilliant criminal profiler with skills that rival, and possibly exceed, Shawn's own.

""Dual Spires"" has a mysterious message drawing Shawn and Gus to a small town decidedly off the beaten path. The parallel to Twin Peaks will leave you laughing for most of the episode.

""We'd Like to Thank the Academy"" has Shawn and Gus being sent to the Police Academy to learn correct police procedures. They immediately get their instructor (a older and nice looking Ralph Macchio) put on suspension, and dredge up an amusing Top Gun moment when Juliet is then put in charge of the class.

""Yin 3 in 2D"", while funny in the normal Psych way, is also chilling as they once again are faced with a battle of wits with the brilliant clue leaving serial killer, Yin.

In this season, we are also treated to a couple of the periodic alternate theme song variations, each of which is clever and funny. The closing credit outtakes also seem to be a cut above in season five, cracking us up every week.

All seasons of this series are highly recommended.",1293148800,42,2911,4.609284332688588
4138510,5,B003L77H1E,"We've been with fake psychic Shawn Spencer and his long-suffering buddy Burton Guster for five years, but this hilarious mystery-comedy shows no signs of slowing down. ""Psych Season 5"" has some new additions to the plot -- mainly in Shawn's love life -- but most of the time it's the usual whirl of bizarre crimes and quirky solutions.

Ever since Henry was put in charge of police consultants, work has been scarce. So Shawn (James Roday) elbows his way into the case of a Chinese diplomat's missing daughter... and ends up mired in the Triads, martial-arts, and a very unusual romance. And that was actually the NORMAL case.

As the season goes on, Shawn and Gus must deal with alien abductions, a professional profiler, a gang of prison escapees, partner-swapping, gigolo deaths, a pair of retired cops, a spy who's been framed, a dead body in a haunted house, an art thief determined to do one last job, a framed polar bear, and a stint at the police academy. Finally, Shawn and Gus do battle with Mr. Yin one last time, over the life of a college student -- and see his true face.

Best parts of the season: the boys take a trip to ""Dual Spires"" (Twin Peaks in all but name); and after Shawn botches an important case, he has a ""It's a Wonderful Life"" experience where a grouchy Tony Cox shows him what Santa Barbara would be like if he hadn't returned.

It's entirely possibly that ""Psych Season 5"" is, if not the best season so far, then certainly one of the best. Fortunately creator Steve Franks is sticking to the old adage: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it,"" and this season doesn't deviate from what works -- there's still lots of comedy, spoofery, silly dialogue (""That would mean we're at war with the machines!"") and enjoyable mysteries.

The writers deftly juggle the funny-sounding plot twists (nunchuk-wielding nerd! Cinnamon festival!), and cram it with endless pop culture references, from Michael Jackson to Percy Jackson, Twin Peaks to ""Disaster Movie."" But the best aspect of ""Psych"" continues to be its kooky dialogue (""What are you guys, UFO chasers?"" ""Nothing as ridiculous as that. We're psychic detectives"").

But this season has a startling development in Shawn's love life. After four-and-a-half seasons of dancing around Shawn and Juliet's mutual attraction, they finally quit messing around. Don't worry -- the romance takes a backseat to the mysteries. The focus is still on Shawn and Gus's strong friendship, and Hill and Roday are still brilliant at depicting the weird, wacky and wild.

And the supporting cast still does brilliant work -- Maggie Lawson's Juliet struggles with the aftermath of her near-death experience, and Timothy Ormundson's Lassiter acquires a new hobby. Corbin Bernson's Henry is still a fun, hard-nosed curmudgeon, but his workplace conflicts with Shawn are too rare. Step it up!

""Psych Season 5"" is just more of the stuff we know and love -- mystery/comedy with a quirky pop-culture streak, and hint of romance here and there.",1292976000,107,2988,4.879684418145956

4139390,5,B003L77H1E,"In some ways the show keeps the same formula that it has had throughout its run.  Case of the week episodes, with the occasional call backs to prior episodes and then the occasional spoof/homage episodes.  The stand out episode of season 5, in my opinion, was one of those homage episodes, Dual Spires which of course is a take off on Twin Peaks.  The episode had been planned for years, given that it was James Roday's favorite show of all time (as revealed in the commentary) and was loved by many of the show runners.  They were able to get many (but not all) of the cast members including Sheryl Lee, Sherilyn Fenn, Dana Ashbrook and even found a way to incorporate the character Ray Wise played in the previous season into the episode.  It is a great bit of nostalgia for those of us who were Twin Peaks fan, and I think especially those of us old enough to have seen its original run.

The other stand out episode of the season was the conclusion to the Yin/Yang episodes.  We finally get to see who Yin is, and what exactly his relationship to Yang (again played brilliantly by Ally Sheedy) is.  There is also a love triangle element thrown in to get in the way of Shawn and Juliet and great guest star cameos as has become the norm.

By now most people reading this will know what the show was and was not. While it did incorporate more drama into the show over the years, it never did take itself too seriously and pretty well remained lighthearted throughout its run.  Yes, it could get repetitive, but I think they did enough to come up with new and unique stories to keep it from becoming too much so.

For those who get the DVDs, like is the case with the prior seasons there are a ton of extras.  Probably not as many audio commentaries as in the previous season, but I think every episode had a short video commentary by the writers of the particular episode, then you got some psychouts, deleted scenes, and a gag reel.  Still a ton of material for those who like to go through all the bonus features.  If you are a fan of the show it is definitely worth picking up.",1457481600,,2082,4.332474226804123

4139604,5,B003L77H1E,"I never watched this for the first 6 years when it was out. My good friends would watch it whenever the newest episode came out and I finally started seeing it. Soon I was watching the episodes myself and now after the show is finished I have been seeing all the episodes as I'm buying the seasons year after year. I really don't know how I ever managed without it. I laugh so hard at the silliness of the 2 starts, ands the supporting two actors are good also. I'm not sure if I've ever seen such great chemistry before between two actors seemingly playing off of each other. Both guys really are so good at what they do. They always crack me up. They went for 8 seasons and I feel ripped off for that.

The one thing I noticed about this series that I can pass on to newcomers is.....the series starts out decent but really gets funnier and funnier as the seasons go on. By season 3 its all out hysterical. And it doesn't get bad. I recall the final 2 seasons seemed every bit as hilarious if not moreso than the earlier ones. And its great clean entertainment for the family. I've been getting these for my 11 year old niece and she enjoys them. Wish they wouldn't have stopped.",1441152000,2,1181,4.272321428571429

4139607,5,B003L77H1E,"Great cable TV series. Season five is outstanding and we get to see a new side to Detective Lassister, aka Lassie, aka binky. We also get a view of the softer side of Sean's Dad.

This is yet another great season of hilarity for the Psych cast, writers, producers, and the amazingly versatile creator, Steve Franks.

This series just seems to get funnier every season, every episode, and with every new guest star. James Roday is a brilliant actor and his ability to banter with each cast member is unbelievable. With Dul Hill and Corbin Bernsen to play off of it's no wonder that the producers are ecstatic with Roday's off-the-cuff, impromptu riffs.

Additionally, I really appreciate video commentary. We especially get insight into the multi-talented Andy Berman and Steve Franks. They each have an uncanny relationship with humor.

This DVD set is well worth the price - highly recommended!",1437004800,,895,4.946666666666666

4139612,5,B003L77H1E,"It's really hard to describe psych as a serious show.  True, it is a mystery show, and there is at least one murder every week.  However, the murders are just excuses for laughs as each episode features sight gags, physical humor, pop culture references, and witty dialog.  Season 5 is more of the same, and that's a great thing.

The show revolves around Shawn Spencer (James Roday).  As a kid, Shawn was trained by his father, Henry (Corbin Bernsen) to be hyper observant.  See, Henry was a cop and expected Shawn to follow in his footsteps.  Shawn has no desire to work for anyone, so he turns his skills into a consulting gig pretending to be a psychic getting visions that help the police find the bad buy.  He's aided by his best friend Gus (Dule Hill).  His solve rate annoys head detective Carlton Lassiter (Timothy Omundson).  Also on the Santa Barbara Police Department (and the regular cast list) are Detective Juliet O'Hara (Maggie Lawson) and police chief Karen Vick (Kirsten Nelson).

Season 5 opens with a big change.  Henry has been retired as long as the series has been going, but in this season he comes back to work for the police as the person in charge of their consultants.  That means that Shawn and Gus report to him, a development that Shawn finds revolting since his father has never quite approved of his psychic detective rouse.  Season 5 also finds Juliet dealing with the emotional aftermath of almost being killed at the end of season 4, a nice bit of continuity we rarely see on this show.

But soon we're back into familiar episodic territory.  This season finds Gus and Lassiter teaming up to take tap dance classes and clear a case before Shawn and Juliet do.  There's an alien abduction, street races, escaped inmates on a ferry, a US spy, and a disappearing body in a haunted house.  They do another Christmas episode, this one themed around It's a Wonderful Life.  Shawn and Gus get themselves into the police academy to attempt to get them to take their work somewhat seriously.  And in the much more serious season 5 finale, Shawn and Gus finally meet serial killer Mr. Yin face to face.  Will they survive?

Did I mention that along the way, a relationship in the series takes a very big turn?  (Honestly, I know I was supposed to care about it, but I never did.  I don't care one way or the other because I tune in to laugh at the wild antics of Shawn and Gus.)

The thing that makes this show work is the relationship between Shawn and Gus.  Despite the way Shawn acts, Gus is still his friend through thick and thin.  Their friendship and wacky banter provides the glue that keeps every grounded no matter how wacky and out there things get.

I can't imagine that this show is easy for the actors, yet the core cast does a great job of keeping their performances believable and just a hair under over the top.  The guest stars fit in well each week, too, allowing us to get lost in the fun of the story.

And each week seems to find us with special guest stars.  We get Freddy Prinze, Jr., Nestor Carbonell of Lost fame, and Ralph Macchio, for example.  One episode features much of the cast of Twin Peaks, although I must admit to feeling like I was missing something there since I had never seen that show.  Finally, Cary Elwes returns, although again there are no Princess Bride references.  The fact that a show that prides itself on 80's references missed a second opportunity like that is inconceivable!

The sixteen episodes are presented here in their wide screen and full surround sound origins on four discs.  Extras include 15 mini video commentaries as well as fully audio commentaries on 7 episodes.  There's a gag reel and deleted scenes as well as a behind the scenes featurette on ""Dual Spires"" and, in what I believe is a first, a featurette on the making of an audio commentary.

Really, all fans of psych need to know is that little has changed for season 5.  We've still got lots of laughs and wackiness held together by bizarre mysteries.  And if you aren't a fan, give yourself a few episodes.  Before you know it, you'll be hooked on this comedy with a mystery element.",1432252800,,4137,4.536486486486487

4140467,5,B003L77H1E,"I have now watched the first five seasons of Psych to completion, and this is a show that keeps getting better and better. It has quickly become one of my top three shows, if not my favorite. There is no better duo, in any medium, than Shawn and Gus (or ""Guy Buttersnaps"", as he is sometimes known). These guys have chemistry like nobody else, and their banter is absolutely hilarious. This is a show that just makes me LAUGH when I watch it... it's the definition of ""FEEL GOOD"". So well written is the show, and so finely executed, the Psych team has taken something that was boring, tired, and formulaic (the police procedural), and turned it into a marathon of comic genius. It's downright weird, because even when somebody is murdered on this show, it comes off as being humorous. It's like the polar opposite of ""The Shield"".

Also notable is the fact that in addition to being 45 minute episodes of comedy, each story is also a functional, self-contained mystery, with all the clues necessary for a sharp viewer to solve the case alongside Shawn and Gus. The show's enjoyment level is further fulfilled by the supporting cast. They do a fine job of continuing their excellent work, most notably Shawn's surly dad, Detective Lassie, and the ever-lovable Julia.

Highlights of this season included a return trip to Canada, in which Shawn and Gus confront the slippery-yet-noble criminal known as Despereaux, Lassie taking up tap dancing, and a polar bear who is accused of murder, while the psychic detectives fight to prove the toothed beast's innocence. You can't go wrong with Shawn and Gus... I'm now into Season Six, and loving every minute of my time spent in Santa Barbara!",1358812800,,1685,4.767123287671233

4140472,5,B003L77H1E,"Since we're baring our souls today, I admit it took me time to get into PSYCH. When it debuted, first impression suggested a flighty tone, and I reasoned: If Shawn Spenser was this half-ass about his claim to psychic prowess, I couldn't see how the Santa Barbara Police Department could take him seriously. So over the years I saw random episodes here and there, but it wasn't must-see television in my household. I didn't think it had staying power. Six years later, here's PSYCH still going strong, and here's egg on my face. When my girlfriend placed me in a devastating leg scissor lock I was forced to watch the entirety of Season 5. And now I'm hooked.

PSYCH is currently the longest running show on the USA network, and it's been renewed for a seventh and eighth season. If you're a fellow neophyte, the premise goes like so: Feckless and immature, Shawn Spencer (James Roday) parlays his photographic memory and his keen observational skills into posing as a psychic detective. With his best friend Gus (Dul Hill), he solves mysteries while acting as a consultant for the SBPD.

Here's the sitch as Season 5 opens: A traumatized Detective Juliet O'Hara (Maggie Lawson) is still recovering from her harrowing experience in the episode, ""Mr. Yin Presents..."" (the Season 4 finale). Shawn's exacting ex-cop dad, Henry Spencer (corbin Bernsen), is now in charge of SBPD's consultants. But if Shawn thought that meant a heftier caseload for him and Gus, no, nuh-uh. Still, there's no dearth of murder in sunny Santa Barbara.

Turns out, I grinned all day at the endless shenanigans Shawn and Gus get up to. Roday and Hill exhibit fantastic buddy chemistry and impeccable comic timing. Maybe the over-the-top antics go down smoother now - as opposed to when I saw earlier episodes years ago - because Shawn Spencer now has something that grounds him. And that's his relationship with Juliet. Even though his interactions with her are frequently marked with jokes and gags, it's obvious that, underneath all that, he cares for her deeply. And that lends depth and dimension to his character. Suddenly, to me, he's progressed beyond being only a caricature.

Season 5 is packed with terrific episodes, plenty of which are send-ups. PSYCH spoofs THE FAST & THE FURIOUS (""Shawn & Gus in Drag (Racing)""), the Bourne films (""One, Maybe Two Ways Out""), and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (""The Polarizing Express""). PSYCH also pokes fun - but mostly pays homage - to TWIN PEAKS in ""Dual Spires,"" an episode which reunites most of the cast of TWIN PEAKS. One of the joys of the show is that it occasionally tweaks the theme song to reflect the episode's theme. In ""Dual Spires,"" Julee Cruise, who originally sang the theme song to TWIN PEAKS, submits a haunting interpretation of ""I Know You Know,"" the PSYCH theme song. Still, me being a hopeless (but manly and hirsute) romantic, the best thing about this season is that there's serious and very gratifying headway made in the Shawn/Juliet dynamics. Accordingly, ""Extradition II: The Actual Extradition Part"" is my favorite Season 5 episode, with ""One, Maybe Two, Ways Out"" a close second. So I get it now. Shawn Spencer just isn't inclined to resign to maturity. It's okay. I'm a convert. I've embraced the deception and learned how to bend. This show got me psyched in the end.

My favorite season 5 episodes:

- Episode 501 - ""Romeo and Juliet and Juliet"" - in which Shawn thinks he knows kung fu (he doesn't).
- Episode 502 - ""Feet Don't Kill Me Now"" - Gus and Lassiter bond over tap-dancing.
- Episode 503 - ""Not Even Close... Encounters"" - In this UFO abduction-centric episode, Freddie Prinze, Jr. guest-stars as the jock adult version of Shawn and Gus's chubby childhood nerd pal.
- Episode 506 - ""Viagra Falls"" - Carl Weathers and William Devane are two geriatric ex-cops who keep one-upping Shawn and Gus during a murder case.
- Episodes 509 & 510 - ""One, Maybe Two, Ways Out"" and ""Extradition II: The Actual Extradition Part"" - Two game-changing episodes, the latter of which features the return of suave art thief Pierre Despereaux (Cary Elwes).
- Episode 512 - ""Dual Spires"" - The TWIN PEAKS homage.
- Episode 513 - ""We'd Like to Thank the Academy"" - To instill in Shawn and Gus a better grasp of SBPD's operating procedures, Chief Vick enrolls them to the police academy under Ralph Macchio's tutelage.
- Episode 516 - ""Yang 3 in 2D"" pits our guys one more time against the homicidal Yin (Peter Weller) and Yang (Ally Sheedy).

4140645,5,B003L77H1E,"I just wanted to post a review (more of an overview) in response to the few who gave this season (not the product itself) a poor review. For those who said this season is the season Psych began losing its luster I respond with an emphatic quote of ""NOT""!

For me this show has thus far (through to season six) only gotten better; each season outdoing its predecessor. I have said it before when reviewing Psych seasons and will say it again, if you don't like this show (or season) you must not enjoy laughter (or delicious flavor).

From the start with Romeo and Juliet and Juliet the hits keep coming. ""It's woo shoo. Woo shoo sounds more authentic...It's sounds delicious""; Gus's rant at the martial arts store remains priceless. ""You wanna know crazy? I sued 300 businesses last year alone. I sued a hot dog cart and got everything but the wheels and the buns, which I won in the civil case two months later"".
Then, to have Freddie Prinze Jr make a guest appearance (one I would not be mad to see him reprise) as the closet nerd friend of Shawn and Gus in what I believe may be the best acting role of his career, ""Not Even Close...Encounters"" is comedy gold!

To see see Carl Weathers and William Devane as the two aging detectives (or future Shawn and Gus) was priceless. I STILL use the phrase ""you disappointing me son"" every once in a while as needed.

And please, please do not overlook the non-stop comedy gold witnessed in Shawn 2.0. The pop culture references alone send this episode soaring not to mention we finally meet someone worthy of being a nemesis to Shawn in Declan. The cherry on top had to be the appearance of Kurt Smith of Tears For Fears (and Shawn's reaction to seeing him).

I could go on and on (much respect to the Dual Spires episode-even though prior to the episode I never watched Twin Peaks).

The only area I won't disagree with is the final episode of the season. It wasn't my favorite and I did find it lacking where the other two Yang tie ins were successful. Once Mary Lightly is removed from the equation, it just doesn't work quite as well.

All in all this was a FANtastic season and season six (spoiler alert).... was even better! I eagerly await season 7 and hope this show and its actors keep bringing their chemistry and comedy...I'm loving it.",1353888000,,2292,4.4688995215311005

In order to draw away suspicion from himself, he did the only logical thing: He claimed he was a psychic... Ok, maybe that wasn't the only logical thing to do.

That is the premise of the pilot episode of season 1 of this series, but since I got as a gift from my aunt the season 5, this is the one I'll do a review of.

By now, we've grown accustomed to these characters, we love Shawn and Gus' banter, we love the right-wing conservative nature of Lassiter's dialogues, we like the strange father figure that is Henry Spencer, and we hope that Juliet and Shawn end up together in the end (God, I'm sounding like my wife, now...). And the fifth season picks up quite a few loose threads and, as is the nature of the show, plays with them until we're on the floor laughing.

And that's the thing, this is the strongest writing in TV comedy nowadays (right alongside Community). It may not have that many heart-felt moments but if there's something I know is that it's easier to make people cry, and its really hard to make them laugh. Some of the banter between James Roday and Dul&eacute; Hill is some of the most fun I've had watching TV in the past few years. This show has me convinced that if Nathan Fillion isn't Nathan Drake in the Uncharted movie (please not Marky Mark) they should get Mr. Roday on the phone right away and offer him as much money as he asks. Quick witty dialogue seems to be Roday and Hill's expertise, and some of their exchanges made me laugh so hard my wife thought there was something wrong with me.

In fact my only gripe with this whole season of Psych is that the final episode, the conclusion to the Ying/Yang storyline wasn't as compelling as I thought it would be. The reveal of Yin's identity and the whole development from that point on was a bit undewhelming, but that is just a small complaint.

Psych`s fifth season is amazingly fun (9.5/10.0), that you should definately check it out. But unlike what I did, I recommend you start from the first season. You won't be let down.",1334448000,,2222,4.422982885085575

I did find the ""It's a Wonderful Life"" spoof a little weird and maybe started thinking that their creative genius had become insanity...but hey, everyone's allowed a stinker here and there...even Seinfeld had them.

The problem I have is that the first disk skipped and froze and drove me NUTS!!  I own all the other seasons and never had this problem.

If you can get past that, it's great fun, and its gratifying to see Shawn and Juliet finally together. Granted, she's just a broomstick with hair, so there's no accounting for taste, but to each his own. I do so wish that Anne Dudek had remained part of the cast....",1327017600,,713,4.503875968992248

4140854,4,B003L77H1E,"The fifth season of ""Psych"" continues to be creative and very funny. Although I've always felt that the mysteries are a bit predictable, it's the fun of hearing Shawn (James Roday) and Gus (Dule Hill) quip their way to their conclusion as to who and why the bad guys (or gals) did what they did.

With the fifth season Shawn's dad (Corbin Bernsen)is brought back to the force part time as a consultant and he isn't going to hire his son's detective agency at the drop of a hat like in the past. Shawn must earn the opportunity again. Shawn also has competition for Juliet (Maggie Lawson)the wealthy ""profiler"" Declan (Nestor Carbonell from ""Lost""). It's another witty, fun season.

The fifth season has a fun parody of ""Twin Peaks"" entitled ""Dual Spires"".

The DVD set has a nice looking transfer of the show (although I'm a bit perplexed as to why this show hasn't shown up on Blu-ray yet since it is shot in and transferred to DVD in high def). Colors are strong throughout and detail quite nice.

Special features We get deleted scenes, a gag reel, video/audio commentaries, behind-the-scenes feature commentary.

I think mainly due to them cutting back some on Shawsn fake psychic antics.  True, while sometimes was overboard, now he just puts his hands to his head.  I miss things like Magic Head (i.e. first season).  Also the stories seem less freash then before.

1. The CDs were scratched when I got them even though the package was unopened. This is probably a manufacturing problem, but it did stop me from watching a couple of episodes on my computer. But strangely enough they worked well on a DVD player.

2. This has nothing to do with the actual DVDs, it has to do with the season itself. Compared to the previous four seasons, this really isn't that good. The show is starting to take itself way too seriously especially with the final episode. But throughout the season, I didn't find as many moments where I was dying of laughter from what Shawn and Gus were doing. It was just a good viewing experience because of past season hype, but I didn't find a lot of the episodes that memorable. Now, some are incredibly good, but not as much as the percentage in former seasons, which was 100% Amazing!

Shawn and Gus in this season are more fun than ever. Shwan's dad working with the police which has given Shawn more challenge to be accepted in cases.
Juliet is in the picture and finally they do it, they kiss the longest and funniest kiss and not in the US, in Canada! Where the romance is everywhere.

Ep. 1 Starts with a Kung-Fu Chinese gangs theme, even the Opening credits you can find the names of the actors written in Chinese, which is funny.

The little detective work this season has tends to be bumbling with successes primarily coming from luck instead of a clever assembly of the miscellaneous facts.

Even worse, the characters seem uncomfortable with their lines like you might expect during the first year of a series. I don't know how that happened after they have been together for five years. Nearly all the personalities have shifted enough so they look and sound like actors instead of characters.

The 5th season definately did not disappoint. I love the new relationship with Sean and Jules and that it does not overshadow the show. I enjoyed that they brought in some of Lassiter's family to get more background on him. The episodes are laugh out loud funny and I am really enjoying the little Canadian promos they are dropping into the scenes that are subtle but being a Canadian I catch them and love it!

There is also a short behind the scenes video of a commentary.  I would definitely recommend this DVD set.",1308700800,,260,4.26530612244898
4141551,1,B003L77H1E,"This a a great series and I own the first four seasons. We ordered the fifth season popped it in and sadly enough the first disk was defective. The video became choppy and skipped around beginning with episode two. Tried it in a different player and the same results. No problem. I called costumer service and they sent a replacement. The replacement had the same problem on two different players as well. The conclusion I came to as well as customer service was that there must be a bad production run. They quickly issued a full refund. The series gets 5 stars, the quality control of the manufacturer gets one star.",1308528000,5,618,4.576576576576577
4141672,5,B003L77H1E,My family and I have thoroughly enjoyed watching the latest season of Psych. Its just as great as all the others have been and we loved the conclusion for the Yin/Yang episodes. Great purchase! What?!,1308528000,2,200,4.742857142857143
4141673,5,B003L77H1E,"With a great mixture of suspense mixed with just a lot of funny, Shawn and Gus are for the fifth time at it again. Psych season five whirls your mind around leaving you as to clueless,yet surprised. More of the ,awesome, yet wonderfully written cases will have you tied up into the drama, Romance, and sarcasm. I have not yet been even remotely disappointed. Such fun involves Shawn and Gus while trying to prove the innocence of a polar bear, or trying to uncover a secret murderer in a town with a population of about 200 people, and even better yet, while trying to solve a crime that keeps getting the better of them in Extradition 2 with the all known art thief. With added deleted scenes and super extended versions psych season five won't let you down. So don't delay and buy yourself the treat of enjoying such a fantastic show: Psych season five.",1308268800,,855,4.52258064516129
4141674,5,B003L77H1E,"No point in writing a detailed review, there are hundreds out there explaining why this may be the best show every produced.  Sure, it doesn't have extreme-budget production values, but I think that may be one of the things making the show so approachable.  It only takes a few episodes to appreciate the style and get hooked.",1308268800,,326,4.701754385964913
4141675,5,B003L77H1E,"My husband and I don't watch tv.  We don't have cable.  We found Psych during Season 4 on Sprint TV with our smart phone.  We're hooked!
Season 5 is a great one.  There are a lot of character developments.  There are also a million and one laughs!
I like that they have video commentary for a lot of the episodes.  It's fun to actually SEE the writer!  Also, of course, the deleted scenes are always fun.
This is definitely a great season from a fantastic series.  WATCH IT.",1308096000,,474,4.306818181818182
4141676,3,B003L77H1E,"This show is great, the writing is good, the actors are funny, and there has been some great character development this season.  The guest stars are spectacular, especially Cary Elwes reprising his role from last season as an international art thief and Nestor Carbonell from ""Lost.""  The show itself deserves 5 stars.
One complaint: disc three will not play properly in my Samsung Bluray player, although all the other discs play fine.  It plays in my laptop and my XBox 360, but not the Bluray.  I have no idea why and I have seen that other people have had the same complaint with other DVD players.  This is unfortunate.",1307059200,3,624,4.6880733944954125

This season is just Amazing funny, witty, and just all around perfect, The Twin Peeks epi was by far my favorite episode of all time. If your a psych fan and don't have this season in your collection do yourself a huge favor and pick it up.",1306886400,2,372,4.027027027027027
4141679,5,B003L77H1E,"A fascinating mix of pop-culture references, humor, and some fake psychic detective work. This is one of a handful of shows that I watch from season to season and support by buying the DVDs. James Roday and Dule hill play off of each other constantly, and the addition of the female detective police Juliet adds a welcome forbiden romance angle. Well worth watching if you enjoy a family friendly laugh.",1305936000,,403,4.771428571428571

The season closer Yin Yang...was absolutely amazing!  The last 5 minutes was my favorite, although the entire episode was great.  I can't wait to see season 6.

4141773,4,B003L77H1E,"I am a big fan of Psych. I love the characters; the physical comedy (fake psychic episodes); the witty banter. The problem is that over the last two seasons the writers have become more interested in theme episodes and guest stars than what made this series awesome. Watch this season and ask yourself ""When was the last time Shawn had one of those psychic episodes where he shakes all over the place and messes up someone's hair?"" The physical comedy is gone. So are the pineapple references and a lot of the psychic detective work that we have come to love. Now, a special guest star will come along and try to outwit Shawn, or Shawn and Gus will go to Twin Peaks for a theme episode with even more guest stars. Oh, and say good bye to the sexual tension between Shawn and Juliet. Did the writers learn nothing from Moonlighting?

I still love Psych, but this season (and part of Season 4) depart from what made the series great. I want to see less guest stars, less of Henry, and more of the case work, physical comedy and workplace tension that made the series great. Until then it is still good, but not as good as previously.",1299196800,15,1131,4.411483253588517

4141778,5,B003L77H1E,"I've enjoyed all the episodes I've seen of Psych, from all the seasons, but this season tops them all. The show is more polished, the comdey is even better, and the character development is really good. So many of the episodes really shined. For example, there is a parody of 'It's a wonderful life' (the polarizing express), a parody of 'Twin Peaks' (one of my personal favorites, it's call 'Dual Spires'), an episode with the delightful thief Despero (Extradition, the Actual Extradition Part), the conclusion to the Yin/Yang trilogy (Yin 3 in 2 D), and a hilarious episode where Lassie takes tap danceing classes (Feet don't fail me now).
Though Shawn is as hilarious as ever, we also see a more serious, gentle side of him. Lassie's character also seemed more developed. The relationships between the characters are well-developed as always, and there is a mid-season romance that will delight any fan of the series!
What are you waiting for???? Watch it!!!",1297555200,3,961,4.938271604938271

Of the 5 seasons, in my opinion, this is the best, with the funniest episodes yet.  Not only do I think they are the funniest, but the season is the most consistently funny and well written of all, with numerous celebrity guest stars.
