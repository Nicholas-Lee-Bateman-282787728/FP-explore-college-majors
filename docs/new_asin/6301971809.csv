391521,3,6301971809,"Occurs during WWII. During a shelling Dirty Harry is able to get out of a German officer that there is a significant amount of (conflict?) GOLD in a bank not too far away. For an hour Harry culls a group of renegade soldiers which include Kojak Hawk Eye Pierce, and CPO Sharkey to make a thirty mile trip into enemy held territory. Shootouts occur. Archie Bunker hears about the operation on the radio and wants to oversee the enterprise.

Concludes with a thirty minute shoot out in what appears to be the same town the cast of 'Saving Private Ryan' was attacked in. Why is the gold in the lobby rather than the vault? How are they going to get the gold home unnoticed? How many of them used the fund$ for a better life? Surreal. Many famous faces.

391660,5,6301971809,"A captured German was being brought back for intelligence purposes. A cursory investigation of his briefcase showed the he possessed a bar of gold. This turns out to be part of a horde that is in a bank behind German lines. Knowing this, what would you do?

Clint Eastwood, you remember him as the Jet Squadron Leader in (Tarantula (1955) is now on foot in the military during WWII. He upon learning that there is a considerable amount of German gold in a bank, 30 miles into enemy territory, he decides to assemble a taskforce of loyal...Oops, greedy soldiers that are capable of recovering the gold before the town is taken by the allies. In the processes they encourage the allies to push harder and further, regardless of the odds.

Some of the key people are:
Of course Kelly the organizer and instigator, who is Clint Eastwood who played a lab technician in ""Revenge of the Creature"".
Telly Savalas is Big Joe. Much different than his character in ""John Goldfarb, Please Come Home"" (1965), where he was a Harem procurer that procured Shirley MacLaine.

One person that did not change is Carroll O'Connor as General Colt who was listening to the progress on the radio and thought that the expedition was an enthusiastic spearhead. He plays General Bolt in ""What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?"" (1966), who looks at aerial photographs and thinks that the troops are in hand to hand combat. (Bolt, Colt, it is still Carroll 0'Connor)

Last for best is Donald Sutherland as Odd Ball the unorthodox tank Commander. See him on the other side or serious side as Faber in Eye of the Needle (1981). Keeping the Faith:

I have to admit I started watching this movie with a less than positive attitude. My previous encounters with Ben Stiller were either getting certain appendages stuck in zippers or having crocodilian's crispy heads removed geek style. I recognized Jenna Elfman from [Krippendorf's Tribe (1998) ASIN: 6304938748]. So I was ready for some wasted film.
After holding my breath and waiting for it to hit. I soon realized that this was a well put together movie with a good story plot and excellent execution. I was amazed at the people that were in this movie. Half the time I keep saying ""oh look there is"" Anne Bancroft, Eli Wallach, and many others.
Basic story of three childhood friends. One went away and the other two chose to become (now don't laugh) a priest and a rabbi. The one that went away (Anna Riley) returns as a business executive and has a magnetic personality with accoutrements to match.
The fun and the drama is when two and a half become more than friend. How will they and their world react to this? What makes the movie is not the story as much as how it is executed. And it seems that I need to re-evaluate Ben Stiller as he did a fine job with just the minimum of ""spectacles, testicles, watch, wallet"".",1504569600,,2841,4.6178217821782175

391723,3,6301971809,The thing about this movie is it is okay on it's  own.  I haven't heard anybody else say.  But it reminds me of The Dirty Dozen.  It isn't too realistic.  None of the cast especially Donald Sutherland look like they are in the Army.  Te story is Some G.I.s are stealing Nazi gold bars.  It's okay.

I still get laughs from it so I bought it. What can I say, the casting is the best along with the storyline.

391768,1,6301971809,"I liked this...once. (when I was 16). Upon repeated viewings, it gets old, real quick. The language is over the top crude, right down to the final shot of the movie. SPOILER- the final scene, with the words UP YOURS, written on a wall, seem to be directed at the viewer, for watching the whole mess. A few good scenes, like the railroad depot and the minefield, are outweighed by the general nasty, ""supposed to be funny"" tone of the movie. I blame the screenwriter. The song ""Burning Bridges"" is really annoying, and appears not once, but 3 times in the movie, and is as out of place in a WW II setting as is Donald Sutherland's ""Oddball"" character. Hard to believe this was directed by Brian G. Hutton, who gave us the classic WHERE EAGLES DARE! I think I'll end up tossing this DVD out in the trash.",1496880000,,802,4.389261744966443

391977,5,6301971809,"I'd have to say this is my all-time favorite movie.

It's not really a war movie, it's a bank heist that takes place during a war.

I won't go over what so many others already have (good points in the reviews I read), no, what made this movie for me was the realism and authentic gear. At the time this film was made, there were probably no working Tiger I tanks in existence (one that I know of has recently been restored to working condition). So, they made some mock-ups, excellent ones, using Russian T-34 tanks as the basis (I believe the same mock-ups were used in Saving Private Ryan). The giveaway is the suspension. There's also a line from Oddball, when they're lining up a shot on a tiger ""Mark VI, and we've got 'im by the ass!"". Anyway, I'm a geek in that regard.

But the characters also made this movie. Eastwood is pretty flat, however, but maybe that works, alongside the other outlandish personalities. Between Big Joe and Crap Game going at each other the whole time, and Oddball conniving his way to the rendezvous point, and his sudden soberness when he finds out he has to take on three Tigers with only one Sherman.

Great movie for military geeks and movie fans alike.",1485475200,,1192,4.47926267281106

(Donald Sutherland) who acts like a hippy, Clint Eastwood who thinks he is ""nuts"" that is on a ""mission"" to break behind the German lines in World War II to get into a bank to collect gold bars behind enemy lines!  Has an all star cast & I have watched it sooo many times because although their ""mission"" is serious, the characters add sooo much humor to the plot!  Remarkably Funny!",1483574400,,513,4.378947368421053
392045,4,6301971809,"Released in 1970 and directed by Brian G. Hutton, Kellys Heroes is a war dramedy starring Clint Eastwood as the title character who convinces Sgt. Big Joe (Telly Savalas) & his platoon and a free-spirited Sherman tank commander (Donald Sutherland) to spend their three-day leave on a gold heist at a French village. The events take place 12 weeks after the Normandy invasion.

Kellys Heroes was obviously inspired by What Did You Do in the War, Daddy? from four years earlier. Carroll O'Connor even plays the same basic role, a general who mistakes the misdeeds of Allied soldiers as brave, selfless combat; and arrives on the scene to commend them. The picture miraculously combines zany comedy with serious war action and is highlighted by the fun, eccentric theme song Burning Bridges by The Mike Curb Congregation. Of course the all-star cast is great with Sutherland standing out as Oddball. People complain that Oddball was anachronistic since he was a late-60s hippie type, but his crew resembled Gypsies and, besides, there are laid-back free-spirited types in every generation.

While the film is overall superior to What Did You Do in the War, Daddy? its inferior in that it lacks a female cast member in the form of the jaw-dropping Giovanna Ralli.  Actually, the film was slated to have a female role, but it was cut from the script prior to filming. The stunning Ingrid Pitt was cast, as she worked with Eastwood two years earlier in Where Eagles Dare. Ingrid was virtually climbing on board the plane bound for the set in Yugoslavia when word came that her part was cut. The fools.

The film is a little overlong at 144 minutes and shouldve been cut by about 15-20 minutes, but the exceptionally compelling last hour makes up for the flabbiness. The movie was shot in the Istrian village of Viinaa in Croatia (former Yugoslavia), substituting for France.

Several of the cast became major-league actors in later years (Telly Savalas, Clint Eastwood, Donald Sutherland) and every cast member turns in a great performance. This isn't the disturbing acerbic humor of Catch 22 or the ""wacky wildness"" of MASH; rather it is a sideways view at individual human aspiration in the midst of death and unfairness. And although the idea of a bunch of GIs deciding to become ""independent contractors"" in order to loot a stash of Nazi gold may not seem the most sound foundation for a moral tale, that's actually what this is. Life isn't fair, some people die when they should have lived, and you only get what you can take for yourself.

392892,5,6301971809,"Private Kelly' (Clint Eastwood) has gone behind enemy-lines to capture a German-Officer for interrogation
as knowing what the other side are about to do may determine the U.S unit's next move.
However back in camp 'Kelly' checks the contents of the Officers briefcase finding what appears to be a metal
bar which turns out to be 'gold' which certainly gets 'Kelly's' attention.
'Geneva-Convention' aside, 'Kelly' wants to know more, he plies the Officer with 'Brandy' eventually learning
the bar is just one of 14,000
The bank that it's held in is 30 miles behind enemy-lines, 'Kelly's' focus now is to assemble a team that are just
maybe more interested in a share of Sixteen-Million Dollars than the war in which they are supposed to be fighting
in.,
'Kelly' has to, on the strength of a share, persuade the field-gun battery to bombard a set crossroads behind enemy
lines at a set time, he also needs supplies, whilst negotiating with 'Staff Sergeant Crapgame' (Don Rickles) they are
overheard by 'Oddball' (Donald Sutherland) who wants in on the deal, he has a small group with him that currently
are without a unit to serve right now, he also happens to have 'Three Sherman Tanks' at his disposal.
'Kelly' wants to persuade 'M-Sergeant Big Joe' (Telly Savalas) on-board, at first he's somewhat reluctant seeing it as
a hairbrained scheme destined to fail, however realizing that several members of his team were up for it, he agree's
subject to checking out the plans 'Kelly' has made.
Well the Bank is behind enemy-lines, the exercise not without danger, the team now seemingly complete, plans in place,
they are ready to roll, but can they really rely upon the eccentric 'Oddball' and his tanks ?
Their unauthorized venture could actually rather by accident than design help the War-Effort by breaking enemy lines.
Well, the group could end up 'Heroes' and 'Dead' or 'Heroes' and seriously 'Rich'
The film does have much in the way of tongue-in-cheek humour along the way as well as some good action-packed
sequences.......it's exciting and hugely enjoyable coupled with a great cast-list.
The Blu-ray upgrade for this 1970 is pretty good in both Picture and Sound Quality.....

The plot of the film is centered around a stockpile of Nazi gold in an occupied French town and what a band of renegade, entrepreneurial GI's will do to ""liberate"" it. To coin a clich, they don't make 'em like this anymore. So make some popcorn, grab your favorite beverage, and settle in.

The list of ALL STARS that make up the cast is off the

It is indeed a Military WW II story, with a host of ""Oddball""

A ""Hippie"" in WW II........interesting concept.
It is part comedy, as you have noticed, and part Eastwood type
war movie, with a big chunk of larceny thrown in.
And a great theme song.
It is a must have for any movie collector, as it finally made it
to the public for purchase.
The movie was made in 1970, and was released for sale in 2000.

Clint Eastwood of course plays the tough serious guy but everyone else (for the most part) play great comical roles that keep the mood light and the action is virtually non stop. Unlike most war movies it has a great ending with the ""Heroes"" making a clean get away and, ostensibly, living happily ever after...rather than the MASH TV series with its tragic ending. It is not the same sort of goof ball, rapid fire comedy as in The MASH TV series but a more measured pace of comedy that steadily progresses and keeps one on the edge of laughter throughout the course of the movie.",1421712000,,745,4.405797101449275

393201,5,6301971809,"KELLY'S HEROES is more than just a WWII heist film. I believe its theme is anti war. There are a lot of smiles, goofiness and laughs throughout, but the film never losses sight that this is still a war film and it plays out in a background of stark realism. There are some very somber and reflective moments in the film. Its all about $16,000,000 in gold bars that the Nazis have and Kelly forms a team to steal before the Nazis can move it. It is interesting how Brian G. Hutton directed both KELLY'S HEROES and WHERE EAGLES DARE and essentially that is really those two films are his two greatest and almost only achievements in the cinema. The performances and the characters they portrayed of Clint Eastwood, Donald Sutherland, Telly Savalas, Don Rickles, Gavin MacLeod, Carroll O'Connor, Harry Dean Stanton, Richard Davalos, and Perry Lopez have essentially been immortalized by this film.

I often have fleeting thoughts of this film, happy ones, of the images, the words and the music from this movie. The examination of camaraderie, the morality of killing and not killing, bravery, survival, betrayal, forgiveness and getting the job done are all integrated into a logical and emotional cohesive film that is both entertaining, yet ever important in its representation of the extraordinary human qualities that can only be realized during war.",1413763200,,1352,4.955947136563877

I just love Donald Sutherland's character, ""Oddbell"" - ""To a New Yorker like you, a 'hero' is some kind of weird sandwich.""  The character interplay is great and the oblivious brass are a laugh riot.  In the end, Kelly's Heroes find out that they actually have something in common with the Germans.

Odd Ball (Donald Sutherland) is my favorite character his interactions between Kelly (Clint Eastwood) are hilarious.

Instead what you'll find is 1960's anti-war, anti-establishment, anti-military propaganda superimposed on a WWII film which is as disjointed as it gets in plot and believability. No one in that generation thought, acted or talked like that--it is all in the imagination of the writers and production staff of that movie, end of story. Populated with a number of popular tv & movie actors of that day, star-power is likely what producers hoped would lure movie-goers to the theater to see this distortion of history. A real waste of time, and a misrepresentation of the generation that fought the real threat of the evil Nazi regime, and fanaticism of the emperor-worshipping Japanese.",1399161600,,784,5.1328125

It has a good deal of comedy but the serious parts are appropriately serious. It's that separation.

The plot works well because I imagine something like must have happen somewhere to some degree. Indeed, part of the comedy is that no one in the Allied Army knows what's going on with any other part of the army.

My favorite character is Oddball. Between his colorful personality and his Sherman tank, he steals the show.

My only problem has to do with the climax. I don't want to go into details, but it stretches my Willing Suspension of Disbelief because it's a stupid move.

It's worth seeing for the very young Clint Eastwood, as well as Donald Sutherland still very much in his MASH days. Telly Savalas actually does a great job as the gruff but warmhearted sergeant brought into the scheme more to protect his men than anything else.  But the war-movie cliches are so thick even somebody (like me) who loves Hollywood corn can start to choke on them. The anti-establishment rhetoric is so cheap and cynical it's offensive.  And there's a wildly inappropriate theme song that keeps cropping up in the darnedest places.  All in all, the film (especially that song!) is such a vivid reminder of the era that produced it that it will make your hair stand on end.

KELLY'S HEROES was one of three war-related comedies released in 1970. This one is set in WWII, as is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CATCH-22/dp/B00005ASGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CATCH-22</a>, while&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/M-A-S-H/dp/B0002B15XI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">M*A*S*H</a>&nbsp;takes place at a med-evac center in Korea.

Its outstanding cast and story makes the nearly 2 hour ""Heroes"" seem to fly by. Here, Eastwood is Pvt. Kelly-- his get-rich-quick scheme involves going behind enemy lines to ""liberate"" millions in gold bars being held in a bank. The catch: three deadly Tiger tanks that guard the enemy's hoard.

To realize his plan Kelly enlists the aid of platoon MSgt. Big Joe (Savalas), conniving supply officer SSgt. Crapgame (Rickles) and hippie-ish tank commander Sgt. Oddball (Sutherland). Others in on the heist are Pvt. Little Joe (Margolin), Pvt. Willard (Stanton), diminutive Pvt. Babra (Collins) and Oddball's pessimistic tank mechanic, Moriarty (MacLeod).

Things are at a standstill all over the front, but when Kelly and crew make a headlong dash for the cash, Maj. Gen. Colt (O'Connor) takes it to be a lone unit assaulting the Germans, so he responds by sending all his men forward. Now Kelly's heroes have to reach an occupied French town, defeat three heavily-armed tanks, grab the loot and clear out before Gen. Colt arrives. To do so,  they call upon an unlikely ally.  (Watch closely for an unusual cameo from director John Landis-- as Sister Rosa Stigmata!)

There are a lot of smiles, goofiness and laughs throughout, but the film never losses sight that this is still a war film and it plays out in a background of stark realism. There are some very somber and reflective moments in the film. Its all about $16,000,000 in gold bars that the Nazis have and Kelly forms a team to steal before the Nazis can move it. It is interesting how Brian G. Hutton directed both KELLY'S HEROES and WHERE EAGLES DARE and essentially that is really those two films are his two greatest and almost only achievements in the cinema. The performances and the characters they portrayed of Clint Eastwood, Donald Sutherland, Telly Savalas, Don Rickles, Gavin MacLeod, Carroll O'Connor, Harry Dean Stanton, Richard Davalos, and Perry Lopez have essentially been immortalized by this film.",1381795200,,894,4.811688311688312

394161,4,6301971809,"First the negative, then the positive:

I know some people love this movie, probably because it has the same kind of loudmouth humor of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.  Coming only a few years later, but fully imbued with anti-government, anti-Vietnam War sentiment, it reverses It's a Mad World's satire on greed in a sardonic way, with all of the main characters being openly greedy and proud of it, their attitude being justified in the film by portraying the American commanders (the superiors of Clint Eastwood and his buddies) as out of touch with reality and unconcerned about their troops' welfare.  Though that was a minus for me, the bigger reason I didn't enjoy the script at all was because the screenwriter filled a huge chunk of the lines with cussing, and this cussing didn't even seem to fit the emotional tension.  It became downright annoying that the characters' masculinity seemed to be completely defined by their cussing.  That is, the script made the characters ""macho""/masculine almost entirely on the basis of their cussing (and of course, Clint Eastwood's deadpan expression, which I'm fine with).  That detracted a lot from the movie, as far as I'm concerned.  The unashamedly revisionist view of WWII might offend some people, but I did alright with it because I understood it to be a reflection of how America's entire history was reinterpreted cynically in the late 60s (the movie came out in 1970).

I watched this a little more than half a year ago, and there were two positive things that stuck with me about the movie, which made it mostly worthwhile for me to see.  One was the extensive climax, involving lots of suspenseful maneuvering to take over the bank they're trying to rob, guarded by Germans.  It is perhaps as suspenseful as Gary Cooper's highly acclaimed showdown at the end of High Noon, but functions on a more drawn-out timescale.  The other is Donald Sutherland's portrayal of WWII's only hippie, ""Oddball"", with a fascinating combination of weirdness, cool-headedness, ambition, and egocentrism.  I really feel the comedy would be totally lame if he weren't in the movie.  I know there are many fans of the movie who would not share my negative reaction to the script and theme, but we agree that Oddball is a character you have to see to believe.  His characterization should have gotten him a Best Supporting Actor nomination.  There's only one Oddball!  (If there were two, it'd be ""Evenball"" :-) .)",1380758400,,2455,4.879518072289157

My only issue is when I finally went to check out the features on it, it does not work and it was too late to send it back.  But none the less, this is one of my favorite movies.  It is almost on rotate sometimes on my DVD player.  I love these kind of movies and the great array of stars in this movie makes it a `must have and must see' movie .  Now don't get me wrong it is a `war movie' so of course it has it's sad moments, but like any great classic it is funny, sad, courageous, and so much more, for movies of this type.

Great stars like  -
Clint Eastwood - plays Kelly in my world he is like the dad - he is the mastermind behind the whole `caper'.  He is protective of the men in his own way.
Telly Savalas -  plays Big Joe the mother-hen like, nurturing - but in a hard-ass way character. His bottom line is get his men whatever is needed to keep them happy, looks out for his men, actually cares for them and is determined to make it back with them all alive and intact.

Donald Sutherland - plays the `beatnick' o f the bunch leading his own band of beatnicks, which includes a much younger Gavin McLeod who plays the pessimist of the group. Which has Donald `Oddball' saying things like `don't bring those negative waves to me this early in the morning'.

Don Rickles - he plays `Crapgame aka Hustler' the supply guy, he got them all the weapons, trucks, food supply and some dry humor laughs etc.
And all the other supporting characters, `Little Joe, Penn, Guthowski - the sniper, Babra, Grace, Petuko, Willard- the comic relief, Cowboy - the Texan, Fisher - their version of Einstein because he is simply a genius making their merry band of amazing men.
Carroll O'Connor - plays the 2 star general who goes charging to the `front' now that Kelly's Heroes have cleared the way for them. Says, `Come on now, and let's get this army of mine back in the war'.

Maitland - who is supposed to lead this band of `merry men' but is never there for them, is looking out for his bottom line and not his responsibilities to his men.
This is one of my favorite scenes to the point where I even gave the my version of what they were in my opinion actually saying.  This was when `Crapgame' get's his leg injured -
When Big Joe asked Crapgame how badly is he hurt and if that is all that is hurt.

This is my version of it subject to my interpretation -
Bigjoe says, `How do you feel Hustler?'
Crapgame says, pretty much, `since when do you care about me', to which
Big Joe basically says, `alright fine, I don't care' and turns to walk away.
Crapgame then says, ` hey Joe' which means `I'm sorry Joe'
Big Joes says, `yeah,' which means, `what is it Crapgame, I don't wanna fight'.  And Crapgame says, `come here,' which means `I'm sorry I really didn't mean that, I know you care'.
Then Crapgame asks `how is it going with the bank', which means `I can be a bitch sometimes, don't mind me, can we move on , thanks for caring'.  Big Joe says, `nothing' which means `I know, forget about it, any suggestions?'  To which Crapgame says `make a deal', to which Big Joe says, `what kind of a deal? To which Crapgame says, `a deal deal, maybe he is a Republican, business is business,' which means, `we are all human, Are we good? Why don't you try my suggestion, after all, wherever we go there are Republicans, right?'  and Big Joe says, `ok big mouth ` which means, ` yeah I will, we're good, ok'.  :-)
Maybe you will look at this part with a different eye next time.  :-)
At least that is my version of what really happened there.  Since men are different in how they express themselves to each other.

And of course I am cheering for them when they get their gold at the end. HOORAY.... There faces are so beatic when they finally see and get their hands on the gold bars knowing there are 14 thousands of them `priceless'.... Now I don't know about you, this is to be taken for what it is a great piece of entertainment with a fantastic cast.  I know I certainly appreciate them all.

Anyway, as you can tell I have really enjoyed watching this movie hope you will to.
Just wanted to say 'Thank you to all of this great cast'.
I'm loving it. :-)

A bank heist committed by a group of WWII soldiers behind German lines.

Clint Eastwood plays a defrocked LT who leads the heist. Telly Savalas as the SGT who reluctantly goes along with it feeling he needs to protect his men as best he can.

Donald Sutherland plays a tank commander who seems more like an early hippie than anything else, but somehow it works. Carroll O'Connor plays a bumbling general and does a fine job of it. Don Rickles is a slimy supply SGT.

""Up yours baby""

These are the words on a cartoon sign (featuring Kilroy) that appears at the end of this offbeat comedy/war movie about a group of WWII soldiers who go AWOL to rob a bank.  Its main stars are Clint Eastwood (who plays Kelly), Telly Savalas, and Donald Sutherland.  Others in this movie include Don Rickles, Carroll O'connor, and Gavin McLeod.

I mentioned the bank that`s to be robbed.  Specifically, it's a bank that contains 14,000 gold bars (total value 16 million dollars).  Oh, I forgot to mention that this bank is located thirty-miles behind enemy lines and is protected by three German Tiger tanks.  (Tiger tanks were feared because of their might and impressive design.)

This is one movie where all actors do good jobs in their roles.  But I have to give special kudos to Telly Savalas as the crusty but caring U.S. sergeant.  And then there's Donald Sutherland who plays a U.S. tank commander.  His character is, well, just--odd.

(Also, look for Telly's real-life brother, George and ""Uncle Leo"" of the sit-com ""Seinfeld,"" Len Lesser.)

All of the action scenes are quite realistic and the background music adds to each scene.  (The main theme music is entitled ""Burning Bridges."")

This movie was filmed in Yugoslavia.

There is a nod to Eastwood's ""spaghetti westerns"" in the scene where there's a stand-off with a Tiger tank--a tongue-in-cheek remake of the ending of ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" (1966) right down to a very similar musical score.

This movie was directed by the same person who directed the excellent WWII adventure film ""Where Eagles Dare"" (1968) which starred Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood.

Finally, the only real extra on this DVD (released in 2010) is a theatrical trailer.  (This is too bad because many who acted in this movie are still alive and I'd bet there are many ""behind-the-scenes"" stories.)

In conclusion, this movie has it all: a good story, good music, good acting, good action, it's funny, and it's dramatic.  It's just a good movie or as Donald Sutherland's character would say,

""Woof, Woof.""

394789,5,6301971809,"Although alot of Hollywood stars in this at the time of production I still think this is Eastwood's & Donald Sutherland's best roles to date.  An early role for Eastwood, he shines with his straight-forward leadership, even acting as a muse for Sutherland at times.  Sutherland, playing a hippies-inspired tank captain is wonderful in his lines.  Don't forget Telly Savalas and Gavin MacLeod, the Love Boat captain!  A great scene is where Don Rickles introduces Sutherland to Eastwood by his character name ""Oddball"" where he rolls his eyes at the same time - hilarious!  The best scenes in the movie originate from the tank's eye view and often thru binoculars, like a first-person shooter video game; it gives the movie a voyeristic feel at times. When Archie Bunker's Carroll O'Connor hits the screen you know the movie is going places as a general.  He hears the action of the team breaking thru enemy lines via short-wave radio and wants to get there, as in yesterday.  The best action is the tank scenes, which is really what the movie is about; they play the pivotal character roles.  When Sutherland and his three Shermans crawl out of a railway tunnel to blow up and shoot their way past a railroad post while playing ""Working on the Railroad"" is pretty cool. Here you see alot of those first-person shooter views.  When they enter Claremont behind enemy lines to get to their objective, $16.5 million in gold bars sitting in a bank protected by three German Tiger tanks, Sutherland is the only Sherman left running.  Eastwood and his boys take out the German support troops while Sutherland plays cat & mousde with the Tigers thru the city's narrow streets.  Toward the end when the Sherman finally breaks down they are forced to deal with the lone tank commander in the last remaining Tiger as well.  This scene is taken right from Eastwood's westerns, with Sutherland, Eastwood, & Salvalas walking down the street towards the Tiger tank while hearing strings of spaghetti western music in the background.  As the Tiger tank's long barrel focuses on them as they approach the tank commander appears and they inform the German what he was protecting and how it won't fall into the American army's hands, but theirs.  And all he has to do is turn the turret around and blow a hole in the door.  I'll let you guess what happens next but needless to say, it sums up the worst trait of us all, greed.

Also, as regards the German Mk VI Tiger tank: it was Not diesel powered - originallly it had a Maybach HL 210 twelve-cylinder gasoline engine. The HL 210 engine was regarded by British technical personnel as a scaled up version of the Maybach engines used in the Pz Mk III and IV medium tanks. The Germans felt the HL 210 was under powered for the Tiger I's weight, so they quickly switched to a larger version of the same basic engine known as the HL 230. My source is ""Tiger Tanks"" by Michael Green, 1995 Motorbooks International Publishers, page 91.

Its outstanding cast and story makes the nearly 2 hour ""Heroes"" seem to fly by. Here, Eastwood is Pvt. Kelly-- his get-rich-quick scheme involves going behind enemy lines to ""liberate"" millions in gold bars being held in a bank. The catch: three deadly Tiger tanks that guard the enemy's hoard.

To realize his plan Kelly enlists the aid of platoon MSgt. Big Joe (Savalas), conniving supply officer SSgt. Crapgame (Rickles) and hippie-ish tank commander Sgt. Oddball (Sutherland). Others in on the heist are Pvt. Little Joe (Margolin), Pvt. Willard (Stanton), diminutive Pvt. Babra (Collins) and Oddball's pessimistic tank mechanic, Moriarty (MacLeod).

Things are at a standstill all over the front, but when Kelly and crew make a headlong dash for the cash, Maj. Gen. Colt (O'Connor) takes it to be a lone unit assaulting the Germans, so he responds by sending all his men forward. Now Kelly's heroes have to reach an occupied French town, defeat three heavily-armed tanks, grab the loot and clear out before Gen. Colt arrives. To do so,  they call upon an unlikely ally.

Or, if they weren't exactly marquee at the time, they would eventually come to be.  It seems to be a formula that worked well in its time, though its debatable as to whether it would do so now.  The movie seems to be classified as a comedy.  While there are humorous characters and some humorous interplay between characters, I would not place it in that category.  This is not a movie that will make you laugh much.  Instead, if you like action, especially based around World War II, and if you like Clint Eastwood's unflappable demeanor,  you will like this as well.

The cast is outstanding, with a list of famous (and good) actors that goes on and on. Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalis, Don Rickles, Donald Sutherland, Gavin MacLeod, Harry Dean Stanton, Carrol O'Connor, to name the best known.

Another reviewer noted that he could watch this movie over and over, and that resonated with me. I don't think the film has ever appeared on my TV schedule that I didn't watch it again. I enjoy it just as much with every viewing.

Kelly's Heroes has comic elements, especially regarding Rickles' and Sutherland's characters, with some more thrown in from O'Conner, but it isn't just a lark. The very real danger of war on the front lines is fully displayed. You feel it when men in Kelly's squad are killed. You see the determination and desperation in the combat. Yet the film has a bit of an uplifting message too, as in the end survivors from both sides are able to work together towards a common goal ... the theft of the gold! LOL

I see that now Kelly's Heroes and Where Eagles Dare have been put out on a combo Blu-ray. The DVD presentation is solid, if bare of extras. I don't know if the Blu-ray is a high quality transfer or not. I'll probably check it out in the near future, and then I'll update this review to point you in that direction if I find it to be a superior presentation of this very fine movie.

394924,3,6301971809,"Kelly's Heroes was a very popular movie in it's day, so most of you probably know the story; if not, here's a very brief synopsis:

After kidnapping a German general during the waning days of WWII, Kelly (Clint Eastwood), I believe a demoted lieutenant, learns that there is 16 million dollars in gold bars stashed away up in a bank somewhere behind enemy lines. Kelly immediately sees nothing but dollar signs and decides to make a break for the gold. He convinces a group of well-worn--and some, very funny--soldiers to assist with the plan. No need to go on any further, for then I'd be giving it away, and that's completely unnecessary.

This movie plays like a well-worn tire...a bit outdated, clearly missing a lot of tread, and the comedy was obviously built for and directed toward another generation, case in point, Donald Sutherland's hippie character. Most people under thirty would not be able to relate to him one bit. I, on the other hand, having grown up with baby boomer parents, found the character to be genuinely hilarious. Overall, if you can get past the TERRIBLE overacting by Telly Savalas, and if you're not younger than about thirty to thirty-five, you'll have a great time watching Kelly's Heroes. Younger than that? You might as well just pass, because you'll be yawning like the entrance to a long, dark tunnel.",1289088000,,1339,4.817391304347826

394926,4,6301971809,"Last night I watched a Clint Eastwood movie titled ""Kelly's Heroes"" and set in the waning days of WWII.. It seems that Eastwood (Kelly) discovers, through some dubious intelligence, that a bank 30 miles behind the Allied/German line has a deposit of $16 million in gold bars. It's tempting. He then gets the idea of robbing that bank through the enlistment of like-minded soldiers who have good control over a couple tanks, armored cars and other military goods. All of this is strictly outside of the command plans, but the perpetrators feel that it might be a worthwhile risk and they could probably get away with it. It's a far fetched tale, but makes for an interesting wartime adventure story.

The cast is excellent and does a good job of acting. Personally, I get fatigued when almost all the dialog is shouted. A lot of the language is much more late 60s than mid 40s. Gold is a very dense metal and a gold bar would be very heavy, yet they toss them about as if they're painted pieces of wood, which they probably are. They should have made they out of painted lead for a more authentic appearance, Details, details. It's a light-hearted comedy so I should loosen up. In any case, it is a fun movie to watch but seems rather dated and stale. I just couldn't rank it with the best of Eastwood movies.

The location seemed more like the Italian Campaign (filmed in Yugoslavia) than France. The extras looked more like Pisanos than ""Frogs"". There was a certain Mediterranean feel to it almost Spaghetti Western. Maybe Southern France is like that but I did not feel it. The second thing that bothered me was the Era.

394965,5,6301971809,"While containing sobering reminders of the costs of war, overall this movie embraces the wistful hopefulness and free-love joy of the time in which it was made.  Kelly's Heroes is a war movie of which the most important messages are that anything is possible with enough buddies and friends and, in war, all you really have is those men and those loyalties.  Clint Eastwood, in one of his laconic, post-Spaghetti Western best, is the lead actor here, with capable support coming in the form of well-acted character turns from Telly Savalas (Kojak), comedian Don Rickles, and Carroll O'Connor (All In the Family).  But the star of this movie, in my humble opinion, is Donald Sutherland, as a tank commander and overall free-spirited adventurer, who steals the movie with irreverence and comedy timing.  The plot of the movie is fun and rebellious, a story of an over-used, under-appreciated group of soldiers with a fortune-making opportunity they just can't pass up.  All they have to do is accomplish it all behind German lines without anyone knowing it!  And while the action comes fast and furious, the cinematography is effective at both pleasing the eye and adding to the scope of the movie.  In conclusion, if you're someone looking for a different take on either the typical WW II or heist picture, pick this one up.  If over-the-top comedy and firefights are your game, place an order for this movie.

394967,5,6301971809,"This is probably my very favorite film of all times..

I remember this one when I was 16 years old or so, my parents just purchased a video recorder (VCR as it is called in the US), which was at the time a luxury thing in your house - this is the mid-80's.. This is one of the first films we recorded, that we kept on showing to people visiting us: look at this awesome film, this is what you can do with a video..

I saw this film dozens of times, and I can dream the dialogues, the swearing of Big Joe (Telly Savallas), the determined Kelly (Clint Eastwood) who is set to go for the gold, the nutty Oddball - played brilliantly by Donald Sutherland (Jack Bauer's - from 24 hours - dad), the greedy Crapgame (Don Rickles).

It's a story about heroes who go for their own sake regardless, of the 'rules of war', which I can imagine can become pointless anyway when you are out there naked at the front. This is WW-II, obviously for good reasons we were fighting, but I think can so much relate to the pointlessness you feel when you're out there. Then suddenly Kelly bumps into this enemy officer, he decided to get him drunk and hear him out that there is a bank full of gold 14000 bars of them, behind enemy lines, in a French village called Clermont.. Let's just go for gold, ""On a private little enterprise"". They don't go without loss, some guys from the gang don't make it, which makes it incredibly realistic.. In the end, they make a 'Deal-deal' with the enemy officer in the village after heavy fighting, have him take his share and leave the bank with a note 'Up yours'. They eventually leave with the general following their path received as the hero, who came to set the village free from the enemy. They don't even realise who actually brake through.. They were Kelly's Hero's.

An asset with big names Telly 'Kojak' Savallas, Clint 'The Good' Eastwood, Donald 'WrrrafWaf' Sutherland.

394970,5,6301971809,"This is one of my favorite WWII movies of all time. Normally, I really don't like to watch movies more than once or twice, but this one I can watch over and over again.  I read a critic review of this movie several years back and he said it was just a poor rehash of ""The Dirty Dozen"". Nothing could be further from the truth.

This is what you would consider a ""Black Comedy"". It has both sublime and hilarious comedic performances interwoven with pathos, suspense and hard-hitting WWII action. It has a great ensemble cast featuring Donald Sutherland (Oddball), Clint Eastwood (Kelly), Telly Savalas (Big Joe), Don Rickles (Crapgame), Carroll O'Conner (General Colt) and Gavin McLeod (Moriarity) among others like Harry Dean Stanton (Willard) and Jeff Morris (Cowboy).

Kelly stumbles upon a German officer not too long after D-Day with top secret information about a Nazi held bank with 16 million dollars worth of gold.  The only problem is, it's 30 miles behind enemy lines!  He assembles a renegade outfit to go get it, recruiting a crazy cast of  characters along the way.  Donald Sutherland gives one of his great performances as Oddball, the burnout tank commander to provide the heavy firepower.  He's the world's first hippie who encourages everyone they can accomplish anything they want as long as they think ""positive thoughts"".  Crapgame is the Brooklyn born hustler that can wrangle all the supplies as long as he gets his cut.  Big Joe is the barely willing hard bitten Sergeant who provides his men and keeps things down to earth.  Kelly is the no-nonsense disaffected lieutenant that orchestrates the whole plan and keeps them on track.
  Carroll O'Conner gives a great over the top performance as General Colt who is frustrated at the lack of progress on the front line.  When he hears over the radio the breakthrough the heroes are making, he thinks they are the real deal and wants to go give them all a medal!

I think this was one of the best ensemble casting jobs I have seen.  Every major character is fully realized and interacts with each other perfectly.  The writing was excellent and the pacing is great.  The plot is fairly straightforward but involving.  Plus it has a very good ending.  The music gives you a seventies feel but feels oddly appropriate. If you want some memorable one-liners, this movie is chock full of them. Asked why Oddball isn't helping his men fix the tank, ""Hey man, I just drive em, I don't what makes em work!"".

Along the way, you have short but memorable appearances such as Mulligan, the artillery officer who can't shoot straight.  I love Don Rickles in this movie, the role seems tailor made for him. I love the scene where he is talking to Big Joe's sidekick soldier Babra (who Joe keeps calling Barbara) about writing home to his mother.  It has some of the worst moments of war as well.  The hell of caring for a buddy who is there one moment and lost forever the next.  If you to want have the guys (and maybe gals) over for a ""guys night at the movies"", this is the one for you.",1229385600,,3047,4.650467289719626

395035,3,6301971809,"In KELLY'S HEROES, director Brian Hutton succeeds in reviving an earlier DIRTY DOZEN, and combines it with a Vietnam War style flair of left-wing anti-militarism that nevertheless carries the audience from start to finish.  Clint Eastwood is cast in a role well-suited to his earlier penchant for playing the bounty hunter.  Here he has learned of the existence of sixteen million dollars of gold in a German occupied French bank.  He allies himself with a motley horde of names well-known to credit readers of the late 1960s: Telly Savalas as the loudmouthed sergeant, Carrol O'Oconnor as the equally loudmouthed cartoonish general, Donald Southerland as the hippiesh bearded tank commander, and Gavin MacLeod as the fumbling mechanic.

Much of the film is an uneasy mixture of a standard shoot-em-up war film of tanks, screaming strafing aircraft, and bloody ambushes with a comedic subtext of mercenary soldiers who view the war as a source of profit.  Casualties on both sides are vastly different.  Germans get blown away by the hundreds yet only two GIs die.  This differential in mortality is needed to keep the film on track as a sometimes funny anti-war film that undoubtedly seemed hilarious in a Vietnam obsessed America of 1970 and only somewhat less humorous in an equally Iraq obsessed America of 2008.  One does not question the many logical gaps involved in Eastwood's leadership of his mercenaries without his superiors finding out.  Indeed, with the buffoonish Carrol O'Connor as the commanding general, one simply accepts that foolishness rather than professionalism is the only requisite for command. Donald Southerland is truly amusing in the same way that he later showed in MASH, but my thinking is that the real impact of KELLY'S HEROES lies not in amusing an audience with the antics of money grubbing soldiers but rather in convincing an already anti-war America that all wars in all times are no different from the one that Eastwood, Savalas, and their cohorts found so immensely profitable.",1211587200,,2018,5.128048780487805

395037,2,6301971809,"Even though I own this DVD, I would never say it's a great movie.  Most of the other reviews here must be from people in their 40s and beyond (I'm in my 30s).  I say that because they must have seen this movie when they were young and it affected them in a way that has colored their current point of view.  IMO, this is one of Clint's most forgettable movies, along with 'Where Eagles Dare', and later, 'Heartbreak Ridge', 'Pink Cadillac', and 'The Rookie'.

The biggest problem with this movie is that Clint isn't a 'group guy'-he's a loner and that's one of the key ingredients that makes so many of his other movies work.  Though his character is seen as an 'off by himself kind of guy', he's still part of the unit.  For him to be able to drive jeeps around and do his own thing (on apparently his own schedule) doesn't jibe.  When you're in the military, your a grunt, stuck with the rest of the grunts.  There are no allowances made just because you'd rather be alone.  You're thrown in with the rest, and you're your stuck with them.  Even though Kelly outranks a lot of the other guys, he is supposed to be part of that unit.  For him to have carte blanche to roam around as he does isn't believable.  Had the storyline had Kelly as someone (not necessarily a soldier) who was a lone entity, with no ties to any one group or side, it would have played out better imo.  With Clint forced to be a part of the group, he looks constipated trying to squeeze his words out.

Another thing that detracts from the film is all the bickering.  Some of it is amusing at times (gotta love Sutherland's Oddball), but the majority of it presents the characters as men who only know how to communicate through yelling, complaining, and berating each other.  I realize this IS a war movie (as in, none of the characters WANT to be there), but realize it is a MOVIE, and as such, a balance needs to be struck where the men's frustration with being stuck in the military (and overseas at war) should be mixed with other aspects of the human personality.  The humor here is all biting sarcasm-not surprising for a war movie, but a one trick pony nonetheless.

'Kelly's Heroes' is one of a long line of movies (and TV shows) that takes place during one war, but are aimed at commenting on another (the Vietnam War).  The fact that this is a caper movie inside a war movie is a not so subtle comment that war is for profit-nothing more.  I agree with this sentiment.  Wars aren't started (and prolonged esp) by men with big hearts out to save lives and extinguish tyrants.  They are to protect assets and/or forcibly take them.  The Iraq War is a very obvious example.  We have a long history of business with Iraq-including when Suddam was in power.  They were once an ally.  Time has a way of burying the truth (actually, men do...and do).

Anyway, unlike the others here, I don't think this movie has aged that well.  The war themes are indeed timeless, and the action scenes are well done, though the shooting of soldiers isn't that realistic imo.  But, the often one dimensional characters (particularly any of the non-Americans) make this a (mostly) mindless action movie without any real passion or guts (real emotion).  The movie doesn't take any chances, and suffers for it.

I own it because it's a time capsule of Clint in his 30s (I'm still a Clint fan despite my feelings about this movie and I don't mind owning 2 star movies).  Clint's acting (finding his on screen power/personality) didn't move to the next level until he did 'Dirty Harry'.  He was forever changed after that-and he knew it.  He showed more depth in 'The Beguiled', but found his power (non-western) in Harry Callahan.",1206921600,,3690,4.482758620689655

How he does this and the efforts he goes through are all kept in the movie, and that could not have been easy to do.

I try hard not to give away plots, but this movie is a mixture of edge on the seat drama as fine as the Dirty Dozen and is 100 times more amusing than the dark satire of MASH in it's theme of Suicide is Painless.

All the performers from Archie Bunker's Carroll O'Connor to Clint Eastwood to Don Rickles to the supporting cast often overlooked in the Germans each give Oscar type performances. Donald Sutherland actually as Oddball gives his best performance of his career.

Personally, I would recommend this mixed version of Kelly's Heroes over Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, because this movie provides more of the real drive of what the American and German war machines were really all about at their core.

Germany was disciplined and America was flying all over the place not doing what any Army should. This is not meant to reflect poorly on American soldiers as this was from Patton himself in his tactics and the fine American troops who could carry out any orders and thank God succeed.

That is the underlying message of Kelly's Heroes in the American soldier could accomplish great things once motivated. Patton and the 3rd Army did it for the motivation of American honor and Kelly does it for other reasons of equal success.

I know Hollywood leftists like to make fun of American heroes, but these characters were all real somewhere in the American Army and they won the war. That is what makes this movie special as it tells a story with drama and comedy of how special Americans are.",1172707200,,1830,4.496987951807229

Rational profiteering in the midst of the most irrational thing in existence, war.

I know in this day and age it might sound rather odd, but this is one war movie, that is not only suspenseful, but is also a whole lot of fun! Is it an accurate portrayle of WWII? Probably not. (I doubt there were too many hippie tank commanders during the ""Big One"") This 1970 release pretty much through its' hilarious, sharp script  has more of a Vietnam era mentality, which satiracally makes fun of both the army and it's attitudes about war. Unlike the John Wayne style war films of the past, these guys are hardly trying to be patriotic heroes, but they are just trying to make it through the war with their a**'s intact (and maby make a little profit on the side). The film features a large, talented cast, some of whom, were already stars and others, who later went on to become big names in both television and film. This includes Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland, Don Rickles, Caroll O'Connor, Gavin MacLeod, Stuart Margolin, Harry Dean Stanton and Len Lesser (Uncle Leo from TV's ""Seinfeld""). How can you go wrong with a cast like that? If your in the mood for a good action picture with some big laughs  mixed in, then I would highly recommend Kelly's Heroes"".",1156464000,,2127,4.639257294429708
395158,3,6301971809,"Many reviews are billing this as a funny World War II film. I'm not sure I agree, if only because 1) I don't remember laughing one time, and 2) its attempts at humor are interspersed with scenes of grave seriousness. Regardless, not a bad movie, but various devices leave you scratching your head and wondering why they bothered to put that in the film.

The film immediately opens with a cheesey chorus penned by Mike Curb, the Nasvhille record mogul. The music is so out of place I think the irony of it is completely lost. It doesn't fit at all - imagine watching Patton with the soundtrack to The Graduate, and you will know what I mean. The viewer will be tortured with the reprises of the opening music twice more.

The plot is a little goofy but believable and enjoyable. However, Sutherland's performance grates on the nerves after a little while (maybe because he does it so well). He portrays a hippy tank commander 25 years before his time. This is presented as social commentary from the perspective of 1970, but it seems just too out there to be accepted. His character is the most prominent comic foil. The other actors do stellar jobs, with maybe Savalas' portrayal of the gritty platoon sergeant the most enjoyable. Carroll O' Connor debuts an early version of Archie Bunker as the theater general. Despite the inclusion of this title in the Clint Eastwood collection, Clint is little more than a cardboard loner-hero type with a weak back story. Savalas, Sutherland, and Rickles have the better developed characters.

Cinematography is quite good. The movie was shot in Yugoslavia and makes full use of some stunning topography and burnt-out urban areas.

A silly Leone-style face-off at the end is another stab at ""humor"" that wasn't really all that funny and just seemed awkward and interrupted the flow of the rest of the movie. The highlight of the movie is a harrowing minefield scene.",1156118400,,1907,4.7696969696969695
395159,5,6301971809,"What? like you never thought of that joke...
I've always thought that this was a very underrated movie.
In all fairness, Its props and costumes are quite accurate. A lot of small details that are often overlooked in other war movies, are actual plot devices in this movie. A really clever movie that has done its home work.
The best part is the smooth performances of the stars in this movie. There isn't the over the top stuff that often happens in multi-star productions( towering inferno,earthquake, just about any of the multi-star epics of the 70's will work.).There isn't any of the typical,trying to out-perform the other guy stuff. All the characters have a reality to them that transcends the actor performing the character. When I watch Kellys Heros,I don't see Clint,Telly, Don and Donald or Harry Dean, I see the guys they are in the movie. Sort of a zen movie moment.  If you take a second and consider how chaoic the movie must have been to make,you realize what a real gem this movie is. It really is too bad they couldn't put some behind the scenes stuff on this. The back stage stories must have been great.
I have a buddy who descibes this movie as King Rat meets Patton.
But even that doesn't do it justice. I mean how many WW 2 comedies are there that take place on the front line? Most of the comedies that depict this time, take place in the rear, with the gear. Kellys Heros was such a good idea that they used it for the George Cloony vehicle,""Three kings"".Kellys Heros is still a better movie by a long shot.
I have always thought that this movie is underrated. Maybe because it didn't take itself completely serious that it wasn't taken seriously. But whatever,Kellys Heros is a movie that deserves a closer look.
They always say comedy is hard. The story and perfomances in Kellys Heros takes comedy,and blends it with gunfire and death,and still manages to work. Really pretty amazing.",1155686400,,1913,4.626470588235295

The guys they got to play the minor parts, like Mulligan the mortar man and Carroll O'Connor's staff, help stretch this movie into the great category.  The scale is great.  The Allied and German army extras make it feel like, well, there's a war going on.  The scenery is fabulous... it has that European flavor all over it.  The machinery... here's where the production team scores and the movie really makes it for me.  The equipment crew gave German soldiers GERMAN WW2 vehicles the U.S. soldiers had U.S. WW2 vehicles.  Remember Fonda's ""Battle of the Bulge""?  Well, the use of US Korean-era tanks for King Tigers really hurt the ""ambiance"" of that movie.  In this picture, you almost have REAL German Tiger Ones.  Why almost?  Take a look at the treads and wheels.  It looks like they took a Tiger body and turret (or modified one) and put Russian T-34 tracks/wheel assemblies on them.  By 1969, there probably weren't many Tiger Is around, but the movie's effort on this front is astounding.  There's just enough comedy to ""keep the movie real"" without turning it into another Fonda farse like ""My Name is Nobody"".  Downside?  Well, while Oddball's band is entertaining, they don't fit the era.  That said, the movie is enriched by them.  The movie really ""pushes the envelope"" of the era by sneaking in vulgar terms.

395226,5,6301971809,"The premise: A company of GIs which landed in France on D-Day now finds itself in Belgium, and captures a German officer who knows the whereabouts of a hidden  cache of Nazi gold. Just after discovering this information, they are pulled out of the front lines for some R&R and spend it on a mission of their own to capture the gold and keep it for themselves. Prior to leaving on their mission, they meet a very unusal tank commander and includes his 3 Sherman  crews in the mission, because, unknown to the tank commander as well as many of the men in the company, there are 3 massive Tiger tanks belonging to the SS guarding the bank where the gold is stored.

This movie stars a number of 60's and early  70's stars, and they are an unusual combination of comedians and action stars. Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Don Rickles, Carroll O'Conner and Donald Sutherland, plus other cast members who were frequently seen in many movies of those two decades.

It would be a shame to give away the events of the story, for this is a very unusual movie and the antics which go on would be ruined if many details were given in a review. There is one parody which younger-than-50-year-old viewers might miss because it is a parody of the Clint Eastwood ""Spagetti Westerns"" which he made in the late 1960s. The movies were popular  and the theme music was played frequently on pop radio stations. If one did not have an awareness of dominant popular culture of those times, the parody might well slip by without notice, but it is one of the very funny points in Kelly's Heros and should be explained. The Eastwood westerns were quite improbable and unrealistic and Eastwood plays a character who appeares to be a ghost come back for revenge, and to protect small western towns people from very bad gangs. The movies were known for their very strange music, especially when there was a gunfight in the making. In Kelly's Heroes, there is a parody of those westerns, including some pretty funky music which is similar to the music of the westerns. When you see Eastwood, Savalas and Sutherland step out into the street and music unlike any in the movie to this point starts playing, you know you are in a moment of high pop culture parody!

While this is primarily a comedy, it is also a war movie with fairly realistic (for the time) battle scenes including deaths. Also, and accuracy fans will appreciate this, the tanks used in this movie include both actual period Sherman tanks and three Russian built tanks which were made to look like Tiger I's.  This bit of makeup was similar to what was done in Saving Private Ryan, but somehow, in my opinion, the tanks in Kelly's heros appear more impressive, powerful, substantial and dangerous than those in Saving Private Ryan.

All in all, this is a good movie. I recently showed parts of it to my college age daughter who thought it was so funny that she took it to college and had her friends watch it with her. Keep in mind, she like Gilmore Girls and movies like Emma, Pride and Prejudice, and other ""girl"" movies, so Kelly's Heroes is not strictly a war buff's movie.

This is one of those motion pictures that you remember long after you forget which film won an academy award.  Politicians get involved in wars for whatever reason.  The men in the trenches have their own motivations.  Some years ago, an acquaintance who had served in World War II told me that men fought for billets, i.e., places to spend the night.  In this film they are planning to get a good hotel in Nancy when the Army reaches that city, but then they discover there is $16 million in gold bars in a bank located 30 miles behind the enemy lines.  That breaks a stalemate when they head for the bank and the entire Army follows after them.

Clint Eastwood plays Kelly, broken back to the ranks after being used as a scapegoat.  Telly Savalas is the platoon sergeant, Big Joe, that Kelly talks into the action.  Don Rickles is Crapgame, the supply sergeant with connections who can get them everything they need.  Donald Sutherland is Oddball, the commander of three Sherman tanks that have become detached from the Army.  Carroll O'Connor is the general commanding that section of the front, who suddenly discovers that the Army has moved forward with nobody telling him.

The film has its moments.  There are the usual SNAFUs as the men move forward, but they push on.  The general only knows what he is picking up on the radio and thinks they are all a bunch of heroes (""Go! Go! Go!""  ""Get me my jeep - get me my box of medals"").  Various individuals are dragged into the scheme as they are promised a share of the gold.  Some enemy in the way?  Make them a deal.

Unlike his westerns, Clint Eastwood does not leave the money behind when he rides off into the sunset.  The song ""Burning Bridges"" will stick in your mind.

I knew that if he was in this movie, it had to be good. But then throw in Archie Bunker, Kojak, and Dirty Harry. You've got a sure hit. It was. And some thirty odd years later, it still is. Set in WW II, Kelly (Clint Eastwood) finds out from a German officer, under intense interigation ( a bottle of bourbon!!!), that there is 16 million dollars in gold bars in a bank. Only thing is, it thrity miles behind enemy lines. Big Joe (Telly Savales) is only concerned with getting the troops under his command some R & R in a town with some action ( broads and booze). When Kelly tells Big Joe about the gold, Big Joe threatens to ""have kicked out of his unit so fast , his feet won't touch the ground"". Of course Kelly goes on with his plan anyway. Securing motar and armored support. Donald Sutherland is memorable as Oddball. A hippie styled leader of the armored support, namely 3 Shermans. Then add Don Rickles as Crapgame, called the Hustler by Big Joe. he's the one that supply Kelly and the crew with the things that they need, including the airial photographs that end up with Oddball. All that is left is to bring in Big Joe. Carroll O'Conner is the general that is trying to get into a town called Nancy. All of his advisers supply him with nothing but excuses. That is until he hears about a brake in the enemy lines thats thirty miles beyond where his advisors said. Other than Goerge C. Scott as ""Patton"", Carroll O'Conner nails this one. I don't want to give too much of this classic away. As a former Marine, this is the type of movie that would serve to entertain as well as motivate. This movie is more than worth the money.

The scenes in question are not that big a deal story wise but why have them in the VHS version, but not in the DVD. I mean that's the reason we all wait for DVD versions of our favorite movies.. right!?

The scenes are as follows, when Oddball's tank and crew members show up at the bridge they need to cross in order to help Kelly and his men, they look out on it feeling happy that it's still there,but the very next second an Allied plane flys by and bombs it out of commission. The next scene missing is where Oddball contacts Len Lesser's character and his bridging group to help repair the aforementioned bridge. A classic line includes Lesser's line ""That job will take at least a hundred guys to get it done, where am i going to find a hundred guys just sitting around doing nothin'?.""

It's a shame that these two small scenes, are missing especially when part of the Lesser scene is included in the final credits!.

Anyway,if these two missing parts are un-important to to you, then by all means pick the DVD up, if they ARE important to you as they are to me, then join me in a loud chorus of BOOOs instead!.

The situation involves an American unit that always gets the $hit details. Finally, they are supposed to get a little R&R but in an area where there is nothing to do. That's when Kelly finds out about $16 million in German gold just a few miles on the other side of the lines. The guys have something to do one their leave after all.

Kelly recruits an all star cast to help him bring off his heist of the German gold. They manage to break through the lines, the same ones that have the US Army stalled and make their way to the bank. This would seem like pretty serious business and they do take some casualties but it is not all seriousness.

Donald Sutherland plays the tank commander recruited to help in the heist. His name is ""Oddball"" and that pretty well sums up his character. He seems like a throwback to the beat generation or the 60's even though the movie takes place in the early part of the 40's. His performance alone is worth the priice of admission.

Clint Eastwood plays the title role and does so with his normal, no nonsense manner. He gets everybody on board and in effect leads the effort even though he does not exercise command. He takes a few fun shots at himself as well. At the climax, he walks down the street to confront the enemy complete with Spaghetti Western music to see him on his way.

395305,1,6301971809,"I have to register a dissenting opinion about this trivial  parody of horrific WWII experiences. When this movie was recently shown on TCM it was stated that Clint Eastwood was unhappy with the cuts made after shooting. I found myself wishing they had made more cuts or scrapped the movie entirely. Donald Sutherland's character, as a 60's type hippie complete with a 60's type (not WWII military) hairstyle who was seemingly sent back in time to command a renegade tank group, was particularly painful to endure. Other anachronisms could be cited but are less important than the generally juvenile script which one had to put up with. I know Hollywood has been successful in marketing war as a fun game for the good guys with the bad guys as stereotypical straight men but children should outgrow their action figure toys at some point in adulthood and begin to see the world in a slightly  more intelligent light than an impressionable juvenile. You could view the catastrophe of war as surreal or as a psychotic episode divorced from reality as in ""Castle Keep"" and some humor might work. This movie, I am sorry to say would inspire some to think that war is actually like a fun video game with tiger tanks being blasted in the ass with paint just for the hell of it before being finished  off for real.

I guess I also don't understand the Clint Eastwood mystique. His perpetual semi-catatonic expression I suppose is considered macho but to be fair I have never really watched one of his movies and perhaps there are better ones than this. I actually found Telly Savalas as the most believable character in the movie was he seemingly attempts to maintain some small degree of reality to this disjointed mess. Carroll O'Connor also manages to parody a stereotypical Army General without crossing the line into childish fantasy. The culmination of fantasy is when the three unarmed renegades casually confront a tiger tank and without being machined gunned to death, as would occur in real life, convince the German tank commander to join them in robbing the bank he is supposed to be guarding. Really believable right? I suppose if your taste in literature consists of action comic books, you might enjoy this creation. There is also the possibility one might become interested in if the renegades actually succeed in their bank robbing goal and you might follow that action. However, there is so much in this movie that masquerades as believable and is not, that the movie does not engage one who cannot accept contrived situations and shallow characters.",1107216000,,2560,4.851258581235698
395306,5,6301971809,"In 1968, director Brian G. Hutton came out with ""Where the Eagles Dare"", a cleverly written but ultimately stupid WWII war film featuring some of the absolutely worst and intellectually devoid ways in which German soldiers died. However, the film became a short-lived hit and gave Clint Eastwood some more exposure after the Spagetti Westerns era. Then two years later, Hutton came out with a follow-up piece: Kelly's Heroes.

The plot is simple, a bunch of GI's have three days R&R before they go back to the front lines, during which time they won't be bothered or inspected. But instead of playing cool, Kelly (Eastwood) decides to pull them together along with their commanding Sgt., a supply-man, and an oddball tank commander, appropriately named oddball. Combined with other memorable characters, they set out to go 30 miles beyond enemy lines. Though these guys aren't going to fight for glory or even the cause, they're going to rob a bank. A German bank, with 16 million dollars worth of gold in it.

This should be seen as a great companion piece to several other action movies made around the time. If you've seen ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"", you'll like Clint here. If you liked ""The Dirty Dozen"", you'll like Telly Savalas here too in the biggest of his movie roles. Don Rickles, well, is brought in as sort of the secondary comic relief. But Oddball, oh boy. The role of Oddball went to Donald Sutherland, otherwise seen in Robert Altman's ""MASH"". He's about as kooky, crazy, silly, and absolutely off-the-wall insane as you've ever seen anybody. Who knew a 1940's hippy could be straight off of Looney Tunes as well?

Despite the killing and drama associated with war epics, this is mainly a slap-stick comedy. Heck, Mel Brooks could've come up with this! From shooting tanks with paint-shells, to telling the Seregent outright that you've got the crabs, the jokes and one-liners in here are hilarious! The pantomimes, which are only just so subtle, clearly state out that Big Joe in particular is really not looking forward to this. This has to be Telly Savalas' best performance. There's a little joke near the end, mostly directed at Clint Eastwood, which makes a jab at his big western role. It's meant to be kind of a joke, but still makes for the coolest scene in the whole flim. Even the late Carroll O'Connor, aka Archie Bunker, has a pre-""All in the Family"" role as General Colt, who has supposedly broken through Axis lines without even knowing it (it was actually Kelly).

In conclusion, this is very much a guy's film. Hardcore war action, tough guy star power, screwball comedy. Even kids should be able to enjoy it, as I did when I first saw it. If you want a little bit of everything, this is the one to see. And always remember:

395378,4,6301971809,"This is one movie that has stuck with me for a number of years and for several reasons.
First is the outstanding cast. Two is the concept. Three is the good script. And four is its' attention to detail in recreating WW2.
First and foremost it is a WW2 movie and is the very foundation upon which it is based and if the production hadn't done such a good job in its' recreation then all the rest would have been for naught.
The casting was quite inspired and each one does an excellent job in making their characters their own,thus giving more credibilty  and believability to the movie.
Carrol O'Connor in one of his earlier roles gives a great over the top performance as General Colt.
As with Gavin McLeod who makes ""Moriarity"" quite the character to behold.
One criticism one may make of the film today is Donald Sutherlands' ""Oddball"" the tank commander. His portrayal is filled with all the 60s hippie lingo then extant. It was more relevant and understandable for audiences THEN than now but what still makes it able to go over today is that it is,as previously stated,a war movie and when all is said and done he does command a tank and can ably function in combat conditions(albeit not without his ""moments""!) and secondly the other characters act in as much disbelief and dismay as the audience at the sight and sound of him. So even though the ""edge"" may be off it still sells.
Clint Eastwood fresh from his Sergio Leone spahgetti westerns puts in a good turn as Kelly,Telly Savalas is a one hard-ass Sargeant ""Big Joe"",Don Rickles turns in a credible performance and adds in some ""schtick"" from his then current comedy routines as ""Crapgame"" and Telly Savalas' brother George does a short but sweet turn as ""Mulligan"" in artillery.
The 60s and 70s were especially replete with war themed TV shows(12 O'Clock High,Merrills' Merauders,Combat,etc.) and movies(The Bridge on the River Kwai,Tora,Tora,Tora,A Bridge too Far,etc).
This movie was one of the better ones. Even though it was fully grounded in the war and even showed the bitter ""reality"" that was that conflict it is remembered by many for its comedic side.
It deftly hit the mark on BOTH counts.
A highly recommended movie.",1093651200,,2192,4.738219895287958
395379,5,6301971809,"What an early Eastwood gem!  Eastwood as Rowdy Yates rode off into sunset of Spaghetti Westerns in the 60's, but came back to start is long career in Hollywood movies with several quirky, oddball movies Two Mules for Sister Sara and Kelly's Heroes.  This is a totally funny movie, with strong acting from an all star cast.  HOWEVER - I really wish since we have DVD and can add so much, that they would put out the FULL LENGTH version of this movie.  I have seen the longer version and it's so good.  So many of the funny stuff was whacked out for length!  WHY they did not do the longer version is beyond me!
The heroes are not Kelly's, they actually belong to Big Joe (Telly Savalas) - well actually to Maitland, their absentee Capt. - and they are not heroes.  You quickly learn from Oddball (Donald Sutherland in his pre-Hawkeye rebel role), that a hero is nothing but a sandwich to most of these guys.  Maitland is the general's nephew who is more interested in looting the countryside, so he leaves the weary misfits under Big Joe's capable care.  Only, Kelly (Eastwood) discovered there is a bank behind enemy lines with millions of dollars in gold bars.  Kelly quickly decides a bank job that isn't a bank job is much better than just getting shot by Germans.
Along for the ride is Sutherland's tank team - with Gavin Macleod as his second in command.  Some of Sutherland's and Macleod's ""making with them negative waves"" banter is just so perfect!  Then there is Cowboy (Jeff Morrsi and Willard (Harry Dean Statton, who actually gets to sing!) ""Damn right!"",  Gene Collins' Pvt. Babra  ""Stop calling me Barbara!"" and Don Rickles as Crapgame.
Toss in scenes that are witty, a parody of Eastwood Spaghetti showdown, this is just brilliantly directed, paced, acted and written from beginning to end.

This film is rich with humor, as well as suspense.  Kelly (Eastwood) learns about a bank full of gold bars, in Germany behind enemy lines.  He gets together a mixed bag of what can only be called losers and misfits, appropriates a tank, and heads for the gold.  The ensuing struggle to get rich provides the motivation which keeps the motley band together.

Donald Sutherland (""oddball""), the hippy tanker, is the source of much humor, as well as Don Rickles (""Crapgame""), and (believe it or not) Carroll O.Connor as the general.

This is a funny movie, with more than a little action.  Nothing offensive.

However, he had me laughing the whole way through! I can't imagine what this film would be like without his hysterical performance. One of my favorite scenes is when Sutherland's three Sherman tanks attack a Nazi railroad station while playing Hank Williams' music on a loud speaker! I realize that this ""WW2 movie"" has a definite 70's feel to it (especially with one of the hit songs of the decade, Burning Bridges), & some don't like this movie for that reason. I can't help but have fun everytime I see this! The tanks, even the German ones, look much more authentic than those in Patton or The Battle of the Bulge. This is a real treat for WW2 tank buffs like me who appreciate authenticity. I know the plot is hokey, but who cares?

395383,4,6301971809,"A silly but sometimes serious caper film set in WWII Europe. It features several major stars: Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland, Carroll O'Connor, Don Rickles and more.
Fanciful, though not completely impossible, tale of a US Army recon unit that stumbles onto the location of a supply of gold during the Allied liberation of Europe. Eastwood is the driving force behind the caper (stealing the gold), Savalas the tough sargent, O'Connor the commanding general, Rickles the deal maker, and Sutherland an outrageous hippie tank commander. The chemistry between the characters is great, and the story is well told.
The movie is well made, the dialog well written and well acted, and the DVD transfer seems quite good. The exteriors were shot in Yugoslavia, and most of the hardware seems accurate. The Sherman tanks, jeeps, and halftracks are real, and while I'm not an expert, the Tiger tanks appear to be the real thing also. While Hollywood can be quite good at illusion (that is their business, after all), the Tigers' drive and bogey wheels match the pix of Tigers I have seen much more closely than that of American APCs. I did find the sound of the machine guns off, however. German machine guns of that era had a higher rate of fire than American guns like the Thompson. If you listen to the firefights, it seems like the sounds are reversed, with the American machine guns firing faster than the German ones. A small nitpick.
All in all, a mostly fun film with some grim battle and death scenes. (It IS a war film) The thing that keeps bringing me back is Sutherland's portrayal of the completely anachronistic ""Oddball,"" which is great for showing his range when compared to his roles in films like The Dirty Dozen, MASH, JFK, Ordinary People, Eye of the Needle, Buffy, Backdraft, Outbreak, etc. (Check out his filmography, it's impressive.)",1074902400,,1864,4.883280757097792
395384,3,6301971809,"To be honest I can't understand why this movie is so popular.  To me it seems like another fantasy like ""Devil's Brigade"" or ""Dirty Dozen"". A guys movie with real tough, famous actors in it to make appealing.  I guess you look at this tongue and cheek epic because of the cast.  If you are a fan of Eastwood, Savalas, Sutherland et. al. then you will love this film.  The sad thing about it is that there is good equipment and sets.  These seem wasted by a slap-stick plot involving a bank heist behind German lines.  The Sherman's and Tiger Tanks are real enough, which gets points from me, but the way the movie uses them is wasteful.  One Sherman never could have taken on three Tigers!  Sutherland seems a little before his time with the 60s lingo in 1944!  Ridiculous. Telly Savalas plays his standard loud mouth tough guy, while Eastwood acts like he is in a Western!  I guess I should take this flick a bit more lightly, its typical for its time, but I have always been a realism fanatic when it comes to war movies, and this film is a fantasy!
I hate to see good sets and equipment wasted.  It sure is here!

395385,5,6301971809,"I've seen this movie dozens of time, both in theaters and on video.  A few observations about Kelly's Heroes:
My Dad was in the Sixth Armored Division (Oddball's parent command) from 1943 through the end of the war in Europe, during the time frame of the film.  When I asked him about whether or not Oddball's situation was feasable, he replied that Oddball's platoon might have been able to avoid higher authority for a few days, but not for weeks as Oddball stated to Kelly in the Division Trains.  My Dad reasoned that the tanks and the treadheads would need to be resupplied with Class 1, 3 and 5 (Food,Ammo and POL), in addition to any other sort of maintnenance that the vehicles would need.
This film was a favorite of my classmates when I attended the U.S.Army's IOAC.  It was a film that apparently got a lot of attention, judging from one discussion we had about it.
Anyone interested in the history behind this film should read ""48 Hours to Hammelburg: Patton's Secret Mission"" by Charles Whiting and a companion peice, ""Raid"" by Major Abe Baum.  Much of the background and events depicted in ""Kelly's Heroes"" were probably extracted from narratives of Patton's order and the subsequent raid on the Hammelburg POW camp.
I read in some promo material about the movie that the tanks in the film were not T-34's or M113's, but real Tiger Mark V's that were rented from the Spanish Army - they still had them in their inventory and were servicable.
Clint Eastwood said that the movie had all the potential to be one of the greatest war movies of all time, but fell a little short of the mark.  I agree, but mainly from the standpoint that the film could have borrowed more from the story of the Hammelburg Raid, which would have made for a better story.  That, and some of the tactics could have made a little more sense.
However, when you compare this film with dogs like ""The Battle of the Bulge"" or some of the laugable combat sequences in the film ""Patton"", it's still far and away a superior testament to World War II combat.",1068422400,,2037,4.549180327868853

What he doesn't know is that the German has a gold bar in his case, and there is alot more where that came from. After Kelly (Clint Eastwood) gets the German officer drunk and gets all the information he needs, Kelly is bent on getting some men from his unit to go with him, far behind enemy lines to steal the gold. The only problem is that Joe (Telly Savalas) is not so sure the plan will work. And it takes some smooth talking to get him to go in on the plan. Along with the help of Oddball (Donald Sutherland) and his tanks, the plan is a go. With all the supplies they need and intel thanks to Crapgame (Don Rickles) who will go along to protect his investment, the unit tries to get the job done. But the plan that was perfect doesn't go the way they had hoped, after several men are killed and, more have to be brought in from the rear to help build a bridge. Kelly still wants to keep the unit as small as possible, but they get a little spread out and have to fight hard to get to the town with the gold. The final is worth seeing after a long hard fight and the arrival of General Colt (Carroll O'Connor) to liberate the town. Good acting and a clever script make this worth the time. Not to mention the good action as well.

You have to understand that when it was made stoners were funny - come to think of it, they're always funny. Highly entertaining, it even pokes fun at Eastwood's spaghetti westerns as they face the Tiger tank, and the German dude in the tank has to be the most caricatured Nazi soldier a real human could possibly be. Great music, we used to just listen to the soundtrack in high school (OK, we were a bit strange, but we were drummers. OK, redundant).

395477,5,6301971809,"Kelly's Heroes is a classic WWII movie with a great cast that blends action and humor together seamlessly.  In the months following D-Day, a recon platoon is leading the charge toward Berlin.  One of the members, Pvt. Kelly, captures a German Intelligence colonel who reveals the whereabouts of some 14,000 gold bars.  The only problem; the gold is 30 miles behind German lines.  But undeterred, Kelly convinces the rest of his platoon to make a go for the gold, along with three Sherman tanks under the command of a hippie, Oddball.  Heading for the town of Claremont and the gold, Kelly and Co. must work their way through German patrols, minefields, bombed out bridges, and even their own Air Force attacking them!  This is one of those movies where everything comes together perfectly; the cast, the story, action, comedy, and the location shooting.  Parts of the movie are very funny, but some are equally moving, like the aftermath of the minefield firefight.  And it all builds up to the showdown in Claremont, with the tension building as the platoon moves into the town, ready to take on the garrison and three Tiger tanks.  But with all that said, Kelly's Heroes is just a good movie.  It's entertaining, and most definitely won't disappoint!

  Clint Eastwood leads a very capable cast as Kelly, a private who used to be a lieutenant but was busted after he had to take the fall for some botched orders from headquarters.  Now, he takes advantage of the opportunity with the gold and spearheads the operation.  Telly Savalas matches Eastwood in a great part as Big Joe, the sergeant of the platoon who is mostly concerned with keeping his men alive, but goes along when Kelly tells about the gold.  Don Rickles is very funny as Crapgame, the supply depot sergeant who tags along to ""keep an eye on his investment.""  Carroll O'Connor plays General Colt, a take on Gen. Patton, who is upset that his army has stalled all along the front.  And how can I forget Donald Sutherland as Oddball, the hippie tank commander, who absolutely steals every scene he is in.  WOOF WOOF, that's my other dog impression.  The supporting cast is equally as good, just some include Gavin MacLeod as Moriarty, Oddball's pessimistic mechanic, and Hal Buckley as Capt. Maitland, the platoon's clueless commander.  Also, Big Joe's platoon has to be mentioned, including Jeff Morris, Stuart Margolin, Harry Dean Stanton, Richard Davalos, Perry Lopez, Tom Troupe, Dick Balduzzi, and Gene Collins.  A great cast overall, one that really makes the movie special.

  The current DVD is pretty lousy overall, other than the movie that is.  It offers a great looking widescreen presentation, Yugoslavia, the film's shooting location, never looked better, a theatrical trailer, and some very brief cast and crew notes.  How about a 2-disc special edition offering interviews with Eastwood, Sutherland, Rickles, and other cast members? most of the platoon is still alive.  Hopefully, some kind of special edition is on the horizon, but for now, this DVD is only $9.99 so it's a safe buy.

How can you go wrong - See the movie alone just to watch each of these great actors.  The movie is hilarious.  It is not a silly type of comedy but it mixes WW2 comedy with a serious side to it. That mixture of comedy and seriousness makes the movie that much more enjoyable to watch!

395483,5,6301971809,"Because I live in Japan, whenever I see American movies on the television, I have the terrible disadvantage of having to see the movie with many scenes taken out! So when I taped ""Kelly's Heroes"", I was only able to watch 1 hour and 50 minutes of this 143 minutes movie! Finally I am able to watch the whole movie through, and in the wonderful picture quality, sound, and color of DVD! What a thrill it was to get this DVD for my birthday, and I sincerely thank my parents for it!
When a group of soldiers from World War II complain that, ""There's no action!"", Lieutenant Kelly (Clint Eastwood) gives them 'a proposition', even when his tough superior Sergeant Big Joe (Telly Savalas) threatens him not to. 25 miles away in Clermont is a bank with Germans guarding 14,000 bars of solid gold - which comes up to about 16 million bucks! And since it's behind enemy lines, Staff Sergeant Crapgame ""The Hustler"" (Don Rickles) is absolutely correct when he says that 'it could be the perfect crime'! Sharing in their adventure is also Oddball (Donald Sutherland), who is, as you've probably already guessed, a nut but an able tank commander. And of course there's the rest of 'Kelly's Heroes', Little Joe (Stuart Margolin), Cowboy (Jeff Morris), Moriarty (Gavin MacLeod), Gutowski (Richard Davalos), Fisher (Dick Balduzzi), Babra who is always called 'Barabara' (Gene Collins), and plenty of other guys, too. But of course they have a long way to go to reach their destination. They'll be hindered by a sixty foot river, German patrols, and even have to beware of their own planes! And even if they reach Clermont, will they be able to go up against - not one, or two - but three Tiger tanks? Also starring is Carroll O'Connor as Major General Colt who wants the American Army to 'get back into the war', his nephew Captain Maitland played by Hal Buckley, and of course there is Mulligan acted out by George Savalas, who is the brother of Telly Savalas (notice the similarities, although their roles are very different from each other's).
A 'no-doubt-about-it' five star movie, though if I could give it more, I would! ""Kelly's Heroes"" is in a genre of it's own, having a bit of everything; action, war, comedy, suspense, and drama. And please don't believe that this is only 'a guy's film'. Yes, the movie is mostly aimed for guys but still, I'm a girl and I LOVE this movie!
The movie is well-paced for it's 143 minutes of film time. Some movies seem to be drawn out and too long but ""Kelly's Heroes"" doesn't have that case. I cannot actually tell you which are my favorite scenes because, well, the whole movie is good! But if I had to answer that question, I would say that the last part where Kelly and his 'heroes' are going into Clermont is one of the best parts of the movie. And of course, the scene where Kelly, Big Joe, and Oddball confront the Tiger tank. That is most definitely a classic scene, imitating western movies like Clint Eastwood's, ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"". And if you listen closely, you can actually here the clink of spurs! :-) The music is terrific, too, especially the song, ""Burnin' Bridges"". I love the intro with the drums and trumpets! The music also really pumps you up with excitement and suspense at just the right times.
As for the DVD, I would only give it four stars out of five. I must admit that the front cover and back cover is really nice. The first thing I thought when I opened of the front flap was, ""WOW, that is a cool picture of Clint Eastwood!"" The movie is also divided into 37 chapters, the more the better for me, since I love it when DVD's have many chapters. But I was a mite disappointed at the lack of special features. The theatrical trailer was really fun to watch but as for the ""Cast and Crew"" part, though about nine people are mentioned, you only get to see Clint Eastwood's filmography! They could have at least put filmographies and a short biography on Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland, and Don Rickles.
Oh, well. But the movie itself certainly makes up for my little disappointment in the DVD. Great movie for anyone though I think the movie's better for kids 13 and up, rather than younger kids. If you have any 'negative waves' on this movie, maybe rent it out first although I'm sure anyone could love this movie!",1014336000,,4289,4.56420233463035
395484,5,6301971809,"For adventure, action and humor in a World War II setting, it's hard to top this classic.  Just forget about logic, and ""go for the gold"" on this zany caper with a terrific cast.
Clint Eastwood is perfect as Kelly, the low-key leader of an opportunistic group of American soldiers.  Here for the last time, we see Clint in his prime, sharing the spotlight, working with an ensemble cast.  After this film, he would soon go on to do ""Dirty Harry"", start directing films, and act mostly in his personal Malpaso projects.
Donald Sutherland gives a wonderful quirky performance as ""Oddball"".  Living up to his name, Sutherland plays a laid back tank commander, who definitely marches to a different beat.  Those who say the character doesn't belong in this time setting are missing the point.  ""Oddball"" is simply a free spirit, way ahead of his time.
Telly Savalas is rock solid as Sergeant Big Joe.  His practicality and instinct for survival is the glue that holds the squad together.  In an important scene, motivations are exposed when the group convinces Big Joe to agree join in Kelly's scheme.  When a reluctant Big Joe finally acquiesces, saying ""Okay...Show me what you got"", the whole squad erupts into cheers, and the mission is officially a ""go"".  Watch, as Telly has his helmet on for almost the entire movie.
As a ""serious"" actor, comedian Don Rickles has never been better, playing the greedy and self centered ""Crapgame"".  The friction between Rickles and Savalas is wonderfully entertaining.  ""The Hustler"" may seem like a wimp, but he proves himself an able fighter in battle.
Carol O'Connor is also terrific.  His role as the wild-eyed commanding General Colt is limited, but adds substantially to the madness and humor.
Gavin MacLeod is Moriarity, the ""mechanical genius"" who repairs tanks, and gets blamed for creating ""negative waves"" with his pessimistic thoughts.  The rest of the GI's are an eclectic group of battle tested troops, who put their military skills to good use in this quest for personal gain.  And on the other side, the actors playing the main Germans are all pretty good too.  They may not say much, but they have the right ""look"" about them.
As for the DVD itself, the transfer is one of the best for a film of this age.  Bonus features are limited to just a trailer.  Too bad.  This movie was shot in Yugoslavia, and it would have been nice to hear about some of the interesting behind the scenes adventures that must surely have taken place during the filming.
Well-paced, always entertaining, and filled with dozens of memorable lines, Kelly's Heroes is a wonderful WWII fantasy adventure, where the grunts come out ahead of the brass.

395586,5,6301971809,"Kelly's Heroes has been one of my favourite movies for a long time now, ever since I first saw it on WTBS.  I finally broke down and bought the video tape a few years ago, and then just last year, decided to buy the DVD.
Am I glad I did.  This movie, great before, got even better when I watched it on DVD.  It looks very crisp and clean, and having it letter-boxed is a definite plus.  I never realized how much of the movie I was missing before.  Also, while there isn't too much language, and no sex or nudity, it was still nice to see it uncut.  The DVD is rather bare-bones, only including the trailers and cast lists in addition to the movie, plus a French version.  You can also do scene selection, which is nice but I hardly ever use it.
The movie itself, though, is great.  I love all the characters, and even the minor ones are distinctive enough that you can tell them apart and they have their own personalities.  Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland and Don Rickles are the real stars, though.
Clint plays Kelly, who used to be a lieutenant until he was busted back because somebody had to take the blame for attacking the wrong hill.  He's been screwed up by officers enough, so he is willing to take things into his own hands and do his own thing.  When he gets wind of the gold that's behind German lines, you can almost see his eyes light up.  He's the leader of the mission, even if Savalas is the leader of the men.
Savalas has a great role as the crusty, war-weary sergeant.  His men give him the utmost respect, and all of them are very glad when Kelly finally convinces him to join in the raid.  He's hard-nosed, but you can tell he cares about his men.  He's affected when one of them dies, as he wants to get through the war with all of them intact.
Sutherland plays a great tanker named Oddball.  Some have complained he's too anachronistic, being a hippy in 1944.  If this were a serious war movie, I would agree.  However, this is a caper film, and thus I think his character works.  It fits in well with the humour in the rest of the movie.
Don Rickles plays the greediest of the bunch, Crapgame.  He's the logistics officer who can get anything Kelly needs.  He decides to go along to protect his investment, but he quickly regrets doing that.  He's sarcastic, a bit of a coward (but not too much), and a complainer.  He and Oddball are the main sources of laugh-out-loud humour, though the rest of them certainly have their moments.
This cast, along with Carroll O'Connor (who is wonderful as the General, though he does get a bit over the top sometimes) and Gavin McLeod (looking completely different from his Love Boat days a few years later), and many others, just add so much colour to the film.
If you like war movies at all, you have to get this film.  Even if you don't, I think you will still appreciate it.  My wife hates war movies, but she still enjoyed it.  You can't do wrong with buying this film.",1009238400,,2953,4.333333333333333

Needless to say, the lack of military discipline and the 'we're in this for ourselves' attitude was very popular when seen at the base theater by a house full of conscripts. Filmed in eastern Europe, it was the first or one of the first war movies to use authentic German hardware, the Tiger Tanks as portrayed in the movie. One major nit-pick: the German commanders complaint about the gas is bogus; the Tiger was a diesel-electric drive, and diesel fuel is not nearly as volatile as gasoline. This was a major issue in WWII, the german tanks were diesel (and more heavily armoured) and the sherman's were thin-skinned and gas powered, hence their nick-name 'Ronson's'.

Clint is still cool and calculated, but he fits in quite well as the leader of this crazy group of GI misfits who go after gold behind enemy lines.
I was a bit startled at the beginning with the music from some hippie choir and Donald Sutherland's hippie-like character (his tank crew looks more like a hippie commune than anything military).  The infusion of anything reminiscent of the 1970s, as contrasted with the 1940s, results in a funky temporal vortex.  However, the contrast actually kind of grew on me.  Besides, the movie is pretty authentic when it comes to equipment, gear, uniforms, etc.
By far, the funniest part of the movie is when Clint, Sutherland and Savalas confront a German tank commander . . . watch the German's eyes when Clint tells him what's in the bank.  Hilarious!!!

Director Brian G. Hutton (who directed Clint in the WWII thriller ""Where Eagles Dare"") is at the helm of this movie and again demonstrates his passion for fiery, loud battle scenes !!
Eastwood plays Kelly...just another war weary soldier slogging through the muddy battlefields of France until he comes across a German colonel and top secret information about a bank full of plundered Nazi bullion...now all he needs is a skilled team to carry out this most audacious of bank heists in the middle of a war !

I know some reviewers tend to be a bit critical of some of the humourous aspects of this movie....but what the heck...it's not trying to be ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" or ""Paths of Glory""...the movie is a fictional tale about an elaborate bank heist thrown in amongst a very noisy war, and peopled with some larger than life colorful characters. ""Kelly's Heroes"" is an enjoyable little cult film and is a fun way to spend a lazy evening watching a ""Boys Own"" action adventure.

395595,5,6301971809,"It's not for nothing that Kelly's Heroes has enjoyed a growing cult following over the past 30 years--it's that exceptional. The cast is a remarkable gathering of some of the biggest names in entertainment by 1970 and each actor fits perfectly into his role in a way that's practically unheard of these days. I can only imagine the fun the actors had making this film because their enthusiasm is obvious--it rubs off on the viewer. This is a playful historical fiction, delightfully revisionary at times, and as irreverent comedy, the film is classic; it features some well calculated anachronisms, such as Oddball (note to Leonard Maltin: why do you think they really called him Oddball?), played unforgettably by Donald Sutherland, a Vietnam-era soldier/poet/lover/flower child, whose chutzpah acts to counterbalance the uptight Big Joe (Sevalas) and the disaffected, self-motivated Kelly (Eastwood). ""Crap Game"" (Rickles) is the quintessential New York hustler and the film wouldn't be the same without his performance, the unforgettable lines like, ""make a deal, maybe the guy's a Republican."" (It helps to see the film in light of its own time).
The strength of the film is in it's characterization (many of the soldier characters coming straight out of a Bill Mauldin cartoon), the performances, and the story (itself a sort of classic, copied by the makers of ""Three Kings""). And yet Kelly's Heroe's was probably the most accurate WWII movie up to it's time (and then some) for military equipment and dress. For example, the dark and enigmatic German Mark VI ""Tiger"" tanks, with their black-suited SS crewmen, are wonderfully reproduced even down to the anti magnetic mine paste.
Kelly's Heroes is cool, confident, unassuming, irreverent, and early anti-war WWII movie (from a time when the war was seen very much as ""the good war"") and what better way to achieve this than as a comedy, even a black comedy (you probably won't see perhaps a more realistic and jarring depiction of a man stepping on an anti-personel mine than in this film). Kelly's Heroes flies in  the face of contemporary political correctness compulsions; today an anti-war film has to be heavy-handed, symbolic, and have some sort of social or political message (as did ""Three King's""). When ""Saving Private Ryan"" first ran, some reviewers compared it to Kelly's Heroes, citing that the latter was ""not serious and realistic enough."" Kelly's Heroes is growing in popularity as a cult film precisely because it's makers weren't so hung up on verisimilitude and social realism that they couldn't create a fun, interesting story with some good old-fashioned humor.

Yes and no. -Mostly no, if I have to be completely honest. I disagree with some of the other reviewers when they claim it's ""a brilliant transfer"", and that it's ""never looked better"". Yes, it has more picture information on the sides than the old letterboxed MGM Laserdisc had, but that old disc was much brighter and therefore more pleasing to look at. The DVD is darker and the colors are a little faded, but generally the picture is ok. Actually, what irritates me the most about it is its aspect ratio. Like I said, it's wider than the Laserdisc, but not as wide as the version shown on TCM (once TNT). -That version was the one I was hoping Warner would've used; it's brighter, the colors are more satisfying, it adds more picture to both sides and it's just as sharp.

With the help of an unlikely cast (Don Rickles, Donald Sutherland, Telley Savalas, and Gavin Macleod), he decides to try to take it away from the Germans. The rest is, by and large, pretty predictable if you haven't seen the movie, but also surprisingly fresh with more laughs then you could reasonably expect of a movie dealing with WWII.

395671,5,6301971809,"This has got to be one of my all-time favorite WW II movies. Not for any historical accuracy, not for realism, but just for all around fun.

Kelly is a busted out lieutenant (he attacked the wrong hill and wiped out half a company of GI's .. someone had to get the blame and he got picked) who fatefully stumbles across a secret Nazi gold shipment worth $16 million when he captures a German colonel. Problems? Well, the gold is locked in a bank in Claremont, France, thirty miles behind the German lines.

Enlisting the aid of a few hand-picked men (such as opportunist supply sergeant Don Rickles (Crap Game), Hippie tanker Donald Sutherland (Odd Ball) and his own platoon of unique GI's), Kelly embarks on a quest to make the Second Great War pay off by offering each man who reaches the gold an equal share.  The team is joined by highly unlikely units such as a bridging unit using a marching band for manpower, and the gravediggers. Later, even a German SS panzer crew takes part.

Divisional Commanding General, Carrol O'Conner hears snatches of conversation while the ragtag unit is engaging in a fight to cross a river. O'Conner has been chastising his staff on their lack of energy in pushing forward lately and rallies to the unknown leader of the unit that penetrated German lines (Listen to that guy! Attack! Attack! Attack! That's the kind of enthusiasm I'm talking about. If he was a Major, he's a Colonel now!)

The film, aside from the humorous angle of GI's seeking to pull off the perfect crime, is visually rewarding. Combat sequences (which there are several) are well thought out and realistic. A perfect marriage of humor and a good war story. What especially impresses me is that finally German Tiger tanks look like Tiger tanks instead of M-47's or M-48's with German markings (Patton, The Devil's Brigade, etc). What a refreshing change!!!

No blood and guts in this one. Though soldiers are killed in battle, there is no graphic representation - making this movie suitable for the whole family to enjoy together. Even the music is offbeat and up beat. And it stars Clint Eastwood. What more can we ask?

Heartily recommended for all.

A front-line US sergeant comes across German intelligence information describing a large shipment of German gold being  safeguarded in a bank behind enemy lines.  When his unit is pulled out of  the front lines for a few days of R&R the sergeant he puts a plan into  action to recruit the rest of his unit (minus their officer), as well as  some additional characters, to make a dash for the gold -- the perfect  crime?
The cast is great, with Clint Eastwood, Donald Sutherland, Telly  Sevalas, and Don Rickles in the most prominent roles.
Clint Eastwood is  ""Kelly,"" the sergeant who comes up with the plan to make the  heist.  Donald Sutherland is ""Oddball,"" another sergeant who  leads of a group of Sherman tanks and an assortment of men one would be  more at home in a commune or at a 1960-70s anti-war rally -- anywhere  except in the military during WWII.  Oddball and his men's main goal is to  avoid fighting, but they are willing to play the heroes for a share of the  loot.  Sevalas is ""Big Joe,"" a tough career sergeant who works  hard to keep his men alive.  He reluctantly agrees to lead the group once  it's clear that all his men will go with or without him. Rickles is  ""The Hustler,"" a street-wise wheeling and dealing behind the  lines supply sergeant who is always looking for an angle to make a buck.  These actors all turn in a good performance.  The supporting cast is also  wonderful.
One thing that I particularly appreciate about this movie is  the attention to technical detail.  At least the US forces use US military  equipment, and the Germans use German military equipment (including tanks).
This is not a ""war movie"" but a movie set in a front-lines  war setting.  There are battle scenes, but the real story includes an  aspect of comedy, a  disillusionment with the war and fighting in it, and  an obvious comedic element provided mostly by Sutherland.
This movie  includes solid performances all around, though the dialog, attitudes, and  actions of the men are more reminiscent of the 1960s or early 1970s than  anything one would expect to see in the 1940s.  That's the only reason I  gave this movie 4 intead of 5 stars.

It has a cast of  actors many of which were already well known and highly regarded, and others that became stars later in their careers.  The  combination of humor, drama, (characters did die during some of the action  scenes), and good old fashion ""shoot em up"" action, makes a good  mix for an extremely enjoyable movie.  The VHS version of this movie was  one of the first videos I ever purchased, (and videos were a lot more  expensive than they are today), and I was sorry that it wasn't in the  letter box format. The scene where three soldiers walk  ""Italian  Western"" style, down a narrow village street to confront a Tiger tank,  is not the same without full frame viewing.  In viewing this movie, one  must remember that it was a ""child"" of the 80's. So you have a  Hippie soldier, and perhaps some humor reflecting the period of time that  this movie was made. I don't believe however that the humor is at all  dated.  In regards to the Tiger tanks in the movie,  which someone in  another review suggested were actually modified T-34 tanks. I doubt  seriously that this is the case, since many countries around the world had  military equipment left over from World War II. I am a military hobbiest  with many reference books, and those tanks sure looked  real to me.  Finally, I have seen some of the actors that were in the cast of this  movie, refer to it in interviews on television. Years after working  together, they still seemed to have fond memories of making the movie, and  I got the feeling that they were a bunch of guys that had a great time. I  think their enjoyment of acting together, is reflected in the smooth  interaction that comes across in the film. They played off each other very  well.  So after you've ""had a little wine and caught a few  rays"", sit back and enjoy a really great movie. Maybe you'll agree  with ""Odd Ball"", and say ""Woof, Woof!"", in real  appreciation of this entertaining movie.",952473600,,2008,4.483333333333333
395746,5,6301971809,I rate this one of the best war films of all time.  The humour element makes it something special. I've lost count how many times I've seen this on TV. Clint Eastwood plays 'his typical' role is this epic film along side  Telly Savalis but what make this film so good is the presence of a  crazy  Donald Sutherland who's 'out of it' most of the time.  'wuff! wuff! That  was my other dog impression.  Full of positive waves man!' Buy this film at  all costs. You won't regret it.,952128000,,479,4.2444444444444445
395747,5,6301971809,Kelly's heros is a very good movie.  It is Clint Eastwood at his best.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes action and a few laughs.,946684800,,137,4.037037037037037
395748,5,6301971809,"I know people think of THE DIRTY DOZEN as the classic but the characters in KELLY'S HEROES are way more likable and the humor has transcended time better than that in the aforementioned. The story while somewhat  unbelievable allows your imagination to take over and think ""WHAT  IF""",946425600,,283,4.875
395749,5,6301971809,"Kelly's Heroes is probably the funniest World War Two movie ever. With a great cast including Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Carroll O'Connor, and Donald Sutherland. I've seen a lot of World War Two movies, and this is one  of the best. Sutherland is hilarious in one of his funniest and best  performances ever.",945216000,,312,4.867924528301887
395750,5,6301971809,"This was the first Clint Eastwood movie I ever saw and I've yet to forget it. Picture this: You are an American soldier in WWII Europe. You have just found out about a bank in a town 30 miles away which happens to contain  $16,000,000.00 worth of gold bars. You think, ""I could become a bank  robber for about 3 days."" What's that you say? It's crazy? To think I  could blow a bank and get away with it? What if that bank is in German  territory? Well, I think you get the picture now.",944438400,,485,4.073684210526316
395751,5,6301971809,"If you don't know the lines ""Don't hit me with no negative vibes, baby"", or ""I'm just having a little wine and cheese"", you are really missing an incredible movie.  I have seen this movie 10 times.  The only thing that would make it better is DVD.",942883200,,247,4.23404255319149
395752,5,6301971809,I have seen this movie several times and it still makes me feel good. Clint Eastwood leads a group of World War II soliders in search of 16 million in  gold. Also staring Telle Salvas and Donald Sutherland as Oldball.  It has so  many good actors that I can't name them all.  The showdown at the end with  the Tiger Tanks is great.,941241600,,331,4.190476190476191
395803,5,6301971809,What can you say? This movie is a classic in the sense that movies like this are not made anymore. The list of stars in this movie go on and on. And the soundtrack is priceless. Does anyone know where you can get the  soundtrack? I've been looking for years.,934156800,,258,4.16

395805,5,6301971809,"An all-time classic WWII movie.  Cast includes Eastwood, Savalas, Rickles, Sutherland Sr, O'Conner, and more!  Hillarious romp about soldiers who decide to invade German territory just to rob a bank without prosecution.  This movie is a must see!",919900800,,246,5.421052631578948
395836,5,6301971809,"I agree with most of the reviews--This is a ""guy flick"", and I agree with the Amazon commentator that Donald Sutherland's hippie tank commander seems a little out-of-place. But who cares, it's still great  stuff! Normally I don't care for Don Rickles, but he is cast perfectly in  this. The best scene of all (and the only one where the acting breaks down  a bit) is a spoof on the showdown scene from ""The Good, the Bad, and  the Ugly"" where it is clear Sutherland is desperately trying to keep a  straight face when he wants to crack up! But I will forgive him, I still  roll on the floor after watching the scene twenty times....I also agree  that this movie wins the award for best Tiger Tank mock-up (a modified T-34  tank).",919382400,,729,4.428571428571429
395837,4,6301971809,"Very entertaining (and very long)WWII flick with a slightly different motivation from the usual gung-ho stuff.  Clint Eastwood (Kelly) is his usual stoic self supported by half of Hollywood.  Some very funny scenes  with Don Rickles, Donald Sutherland (WOOF!), Telly Savalas and Carol  O'Connor--to mention just a few.  Lots of action--and some commentary on  the futility of war--but all in all a great flick.  Add it to your  collection--you won't be disappointed.",918691200,,466,5.375
395838,4,6301971809,"I was really shocked that film has been absolutely forgotten. It's definitely not a M*A*S*H (although it was made in the same year), but has really got its moments. Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland play together , which is unique. The story is about a private action during the WW2. It describes the army as a corrupt, meaningless thing but in a very funny way. Sutherland will definitely give you ""those positive rays""  END",894153600,,440,4.866666666666666
