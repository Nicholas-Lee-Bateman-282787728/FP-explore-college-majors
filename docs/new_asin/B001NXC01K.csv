Neurological researchers at Stanford University learned that when you watch images of movement your nervous system responds as if YOU WERE PHYSICALLY PERFORMING THE ACTION! Your brain then stores what you've seen and experienced in ""muscle memory"" for future recall and execution... Just like actual PRACTICE! The technique is called Neuromuscular Training.

Anyway, before I begin studying a new sport or hobby I like to watch tapes of it being performed at the top of the learning curve. I watch it the way other people listen to self-hypnosis tapes. Soon, I can feel my body trying to take on the posture of the athletes... and it grows from there.

I like the idea of being able to transfer the near-perfect skills of a world class athlete into my own body's repertoire of skills. The rehearsals at the Russian State Theatre are great for my purposes. I get to see the dancers perform up-close and repeat the same steps several times. I get to see them make minor adjustments towards the desired form. I get to see how their highly trained muscles exist in a relaxed and a working state. I find these tapes even better to watch than a performance, where I get less repetition and less up-close detail. BTW, I think Yulia Anufrieva is absolutely exquisite - ideal for motivation and imitation.

I hope CreateSpace calls SyberVision (who started Neuromuscular Training  in the '80s) and makes some REAL Neuromuscular Training DVD's for Ballet. No one else is doing it.",1331164800,2,1534,4.821292775665399
8328053,2,B001NXC01K,"If nothing else, this video helps one to appeciate the hard work and dedication that goes into good ballet. This is not good ballet at any point.
  This video was an exercise in frustration. The viewer has no idea as to the training level of the participants and, therefore, cannot make a fair assessment of the proficiency. It occurred to me that the dancers were not acting in concert or taking responsibility for mistakes individually. There was no energy or interest by either dancer. I got the impression that neither wanted to be there. Even the teacher seemed detached, leaving a desire to hear what corrections were being made.
  The technical aspects of this video were lacking: light, sound, and editing.
  May I suggest the intruction video titled Yvette Chauvire, France's Prima Ballerina Absoluta. Would-be dancers can see what the relationship of teacher and dancer should be. The respect for experience and fame is obvious.",1310342400,,938,5.019354838709678
8328054,4,B001NXC01K,"I loved this DVD. It shows how performers can go from the initial practice stage to final costume rehearsals. It is quite short though, and would have been better had it been longer. A more in-depth look would have made this 5 star.",1235001600,,232,4.4186046511627906
8328055,5,B001NXC01K,"Interesting and captivating to watch some of the world best professional ballet dancers rehearsing for this classic fairy tale.  I also enjoyed the instructional component.  As part of the experience, it was very interesting to find myself behind the closed doors right at the heart of one the Russian Ballet well kept secrets, witnessing the creation of ballet masters and of a classic masterpiece.  Overall, an outstanding performance at rehearsal level.  Delightful to watch.",1233532800,2,478,5.418918918918919
8328056,5,B001NXC01K,"This video is just a pleasure to watch. Gorgeous Russian ballet dancers, who perform every move so graceful and perfect, do not require any comments. We can see ballet dancers of such high level not so often, particularly during the rehearsal given by Valery Miklin.",1233360000,,266,4.933333333333334
8328057,1,B001NXC01K,"Awful.  Not worth watching. No explanations or corrections given for dancers stopping and starting.  Badly lit, amateurish in presentation.  But what can you expect if they can't even spell pas de deux properly?",1233360000,,211,5.333333333333333
