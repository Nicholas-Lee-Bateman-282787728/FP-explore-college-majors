7545399,4,B018ELUC5Y,"The Bear family head out to a cabin in the woods so dad (Dave Juehring ) can write his novel. Charles is dorky and uses phrases like ""dag-gone-it."" Mom (Trena Penson) is close to June Clever, while their asthmatic child Lonnie (Tristan Coppola) over uses his inhaler. The family is pestered by the ""Field Freak"" who actually hides in a cave in the woods and not any field. There are a couple of quirky characters added to satirize cabin in the woods style movies.

The film is campy by design, something you should be aware of when Charles first opens his mouth...otherwise it is really sad acting. The location is claimed to be Idaho, but the actual filming took place in Milan, Ill. Note the ""LEAF ILL"" carved into the rock wall behind the exterminator (Thomas Ely Sage) as he walks by late in the film.

The beast is supposed to be a giant beaver or something. It was a man in a modified gorilla suit with claws. At no time does the kid say ""red rum"" like that other film with writer's block.  While the film is funny in parts, it drags in others, i.e. loses entertainment value.

Perkins, the root beer manufacturer is hilarious and Charles is a delightful dunce, with a cheery attitude until bigfoot (the Field Freak) ticks him off. Kind of reminds me of Green Acres (Oliver and Lisa Douglas) meets Bigfoot. The creature is in a horribly cheesy costume which only makes it funnier. Very goofy.",1487289600,,456,5.0131578947368425

Weird over the top acting, dumb script, and just not funny or scary at all. Believe me, I'm no movie snob, I've definitely seen worse, but this movie is just a waste of time.

7545453,5,B018ELUC5Y,"A bit slow sometimes, but I actually really liked it. Here is the thing with these movies, they are low budget, so set your expectations people. Some people really need to get that through their thick skulls. Do not expect great special effects or a professional monster-get-up or acting. Remember low-budget. For low budget, big-foot-type, B-movie, it was done quite well and the story line was intentionally campy and funny and I really liked the ending. I might actually watch it again.",1465603200,7,489,4.975609756097561

7545455,4,B018ELUC5Y,"This movie is pretty much what the other reviewers say. But, it was a funny movie. It was funny, not hilarious. Not scary. Just funny.  Not a true horror movie. There was a Bigfoot-like creature involved, but the creature was played straight, not for laughs. The laughs came at the expense of the human characters. Just about all of the human characters were laughable at some point in the movie. I'm generously giving it 4 stars because I found it refreshingly entertaining. But remember, it was funny, not scary.",1465084800,5,514,4.775280898876405
7545456,4,B018ELUC5Y,"This is by no means a four star movie, but for all its hilarity, lame acting--especially the father--and pretty decent acting by the mother. But for a such a low-budget poor movie, it is fun. I wouldn't stack against better made movies in which I would give it 2 stars. If you're looking for a movie that is senselessly silly, this is a movie deserving an extra star or two. Ugh! Don't gag.",1464998400,4,390,4.3561643835616435

7545462,3,B018ELUC5Y,"Watched this movie on Amazon Prime. The characters are hilarious! The Bigfoot though looks absolutely horrible! It really ruins the rest of the movie! The actors did a good job; I especially like the guy that sold that nasty looking root beer. He was what kept this movie entertaining. Shame the Bigfoot looks so bad. Just a guy in a rubber monkey suit. Looks like one of the crappy ones you see at the store near Halloween. I would give this a 5/5 if the Bigfoot costume looked better. Id say worth a watch though, funny horror comedy. Its on Amazon Prime at the moment as well. I'd give it 3/5.",1464134400,,596,4.378378378378378
7545463,1,B018ELUC5Y,"This is one strange movie. The family's interactions are sugar-coated and markedly overacted. Everyone else's performances are comically over the top. It's hard to say whether this all was intentional or not, because it jives with the film's quirky feeling.

All these things make the film seem like a surreal comedy, except that it's not advertised as such. That is what most disappointed me about the film. The cover art (as of 5/19/2016) depicts a horrifying ape-man looking like some sort of murderous Bigfoot. It gives the impression that this is supposed to be a horror film, but no, there is hardly a good scare throughout much of the film. In fact, the film is neither funny or scary. It's just... odd, but not in a terribly entertaining way.",1463616000,6,750,4.813953488372093
7545464,4,B018ELUC5Y,"One of the best camp b-horror movies I've seen in a while. It doesn't take itself seriously, as evidenced by the over-the-top performances of Charles Bear (the main protagonist), the stereotypical author-isolating-himself-to-finish-writing-a-book, Ned Perkins, the stereotypical local-nutjob-who-believes-the-monster-actually-exists, and a hapless pest control man a suit short of a deck who has one explanation for everything: rabid beavers (death at your doorstep!). This is not an Oscar winner by any means, but as a low-budget, camp b-horror movie, it's fairly remarkable. Definitely the cream of the cr*p in Amazon Prime's extensive list of such flicks. Worth the view!",1463616000,10,674,5.958762886597938
7545465,2,B018ELUC5Y,"Very silly, low-budget horror comedy about a city family that moves to a house in the woods so the dad can finish his latest book without distractions.  What they don't know is that the previous family that lived there many years earlier were brutally murdered by the monster of the title--which looks like a man in the cheapest gorilla costume ever made.  This has mostly terrible acting, no suspense, no special effects or production values and very little in the way of actual laughs.  While I got the definite impression that writer/director Stephen Folker was trying to make the best of very limited resources, that doesn't really make Field Freak any more watchable.

Glenn Harston as Ned Perkins, the now adult survivor of the previous massacre (which occurred when he was 11 years old) gets very nearly every single laugh in the movie and seems to be head and shoulders above his costars in terms of performing talent.  Dave Juehring as Charles Bear, the writer, gives such an over the top performance it's hard to tell for sure whether he's a genuinely terrible actor or is going for some sort of stylized bad horror movie performance.  Trena Penson who plays his wife is shrill and about as funny as a bag of kittens being smashed with a baseball bat.

Field Freak is good-natured enough and does provide a few mild laughs, but it's pretty bottom of the barrel as far as entertainment value goes.",1463097600,,1406,4.737704918032787
