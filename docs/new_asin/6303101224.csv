568617,5,6303101224,"This is the best movie I have ever seen WHICH I would only wish to watch once.  I rate movies by how many times I can watch them enjoyably.  It provides new perspectives for many viewers about Vietnam.  Be prepared for an emotional roller coaster across a washboard.  After an hour I did not want it to end because it was so good.  About 3/4 of the way through I was becoming exhausted.  Stone really out did himslef, creating an epic which most of the world will not see.",976665600,,472,4.247191011235955
568618,4,6303101224,"They say that history of war is written by the winners, but in Vietnam the winners were too demolarised, hungry and poor to be writing history. Of all the anti-war films I've seen about Vietnam, all where about young Americans  losing their inoccense, Oliver Stone's moving and humane film is the first  (that I've seen) to consider the other side. The Vietnamese.
  The story  revolves around Le Ly Hayslip (Hiep Thi Le), she is her father's favourite  child and the centre of attention in her family. During the film's stunning  first hour, her village will be visited by members of the Viet-Cong and  representatives of the Southern government, both spreading propaganda and  both capable of unspeakable brutality. As Vietnamese the people of the  village are more sympathetic to Veit-Cong, and indeed Le Ly's two brothers  go to fight for the north. But Stone wisely avoids making heroes  of the  Veit-Cong, in one particularly harrowing scene they rape Le Ly because of  her detention by the southern forces. Heaven and Earth is more concerned  about the tragic effect of the war on Veitnam.
  As the war goes on Le  Ly is forced to be a street vendor in Saigon, where she meets a gentle  American man Steve (Tommy Lee Jones). His attraction to Le Ly however is  not so much love, as it is a desire to be forgiven by all  ""Orientals"" as he calls them. But Le Ly desperate and poor is  blinded by his kindness and togather they go to America to start a new life  as a married couple. It is here that film looses its footing, Steve's  behaviour is explained by the script, but his transformation from a gentle  man to a confused and angry one is so rushed, it is inexcplicable. The film  does recover in the powerful closing scenes set in Vietnam.
  The most  touching relationship in the film is between Le Ly and her father.  Heartbroken by what the war has done to his family he tells her ""Don't  ask what is right or wrong, these are dangerous questions, there's is only  the goodness in your heart."" He has been through too much suffering to  consider war as an idealogical matter, he only wishes for the safety of his  favourite child so that she can live on the land of her  ""ancestors"".
  Heaven and Earth is not as poetic as Terrance  Malick's The Thin Red Line, the narration is not as lyrical, and its  structure is not perfect. But there are individual passages in this film  that will linger with you for a long time. It is a worthy final installment  in Oliver Stone's Veitnam trilogy.",957484800,16,2502,4.570135746606335
568619,5,6303101224,"Heaven and Earth, starring Tommy Lee Jones and Joan Chen, was one of the best dramas of 1993.  Oliver Stone portrayed life in war-torn Vietnam with striking realism; so real, in fact, that it pulls the viewer into the movie  and makes them forget that they are watching it on a screen and are not  actually in the Vietnam War.  It was the most realistic Vietnam War movie  this movie buff has ever seen, and is not to be missed for anything.  Make  an appointment with your family shrink for 10:00 am on Monday because  you're probably going to have Post-traumatic Stress Disorder after watching  this one.",946598400,,606,4.588785046728972
568620,5,6303101224,"Oliver Stone said  that Heaven and Earth is his favorite film. It is one of mine as well. Beyond its ability to effectively convey the shock of extreme violence and its statement about the pre-war physical beauty of  Vietnam, it is an excellent portrayal of the essence of Buddhism. It is,  too me, an extraordinary film, poetic and concise, easily one of Stone's  best.  The cinematography was perfectly done. (So well done, i think  Scorcese borrowed  some of the techniques for ""Goodfellows"") It  is already in my collection and I think will be regarded  as one of Stone's  best by later film historians.",943401600,5,607,4.805825242718447
568621,2,6303101224,"I had thought that perhaps this movie, taking the original standpoint of a Vietnamese girl during the Vietnam war, could have had something very powerful to say.  Instead I found it to be an incoherent film with very  little organization.  I found myself constantly questioning the motives of  various groups, for example the Vietcong and their vicious attacks on the  village even though they were trying to gain support among the farmers.  I  found the movie to be overly dramatic and poorly directed.  All in all a  less then average movie, which may have gained good reviews from its  subject only.",933465600,2,602,4.871287128712871
568622,5,6303101224,"I was gasping for breath, reaching for tissues, laughing, & holding on to the edge of my seat.  It is very graphic, so be aware.  It is also a wonderful yardstick for self reflection.  This movie is a must for my video  collection.",921542400,3,231,4.3023255813953485
568623,5,6303101224,"""Heaven and Earth"" is the third in Stone's Vietnam Trilogy -- the first being ""Platoon,"" which was Nam from the American Infantryman's frontline point-of-view. The second is ""Born on the  Fourth of July,"" the point-of-view of an American Marine who leaves  one war -- paralyzed -- and only gets home to find a completely different  war going on - the war with ourselves.
The third, ""Heaven and  Earth,"" is a view of the war from the other side -- that of a  Vietnamese rice farmer family.
The main character is Lyn Lee, an  innocent Vietnamese girl, who respects her parents, her country and her  religion. Her life as a simple rice-patty worker changes when THE Vietnam  war begins. First, the cruel SVA Army, aided by the American Army, rapes  the simple village, and all that the farmers have worked so hard for. Then,  they are also bullied by the Viet Cong when the anti-communist forces  aren't there...and her brothers join their ranks.
From then on, her life  changes forever. She becomes a cheap peddler in the streets of Saigon, and  also a prostitute. Her life is in the pits, that is, until she meets a  United States Marine Gunnery Seargent, played by Tommy Lee Jones. He treats  her very well, almost making up for all the hardships she has dealt with  her whole life. The two finally fall in love, and he brings her back to  America.
When she reaches the U.S., she is amazed at everything --  including the amount of food that is practically there for the taking -- if  you have a nice big fridge, which she finds commonplace in America.
Her  problems aren't solved, however, because the Marine she fell in love with  (played wonderfully by the great Jones), suffers horribly from  post-traumatic stress syndrome.
While this movie emotionally drains you,  and gets a little boring at times, you sit back in your chair in awe; first  at how great the story is, second, what this poor Vietnamese girl went  through, and third, you are amazed at how much this film makes you thankful  for everything you take for granted.....and when you are done watching this  flick, you walk away feeling, of course, a little depressed, but you walk  away feeling that you have gained something.
An excellent -- yet  depressing -- close to Stone's Vietnam trilogy.
Reccomended.",918345600,5,2275,4.732142857142857

Finally an excellent and accurate depiction of the treatment of Vietnamese women and families  by American G.I.s.
Oliver Stone is a brave fellow coming out with this film showing the truth of War that many Americans will not want to watch or accept.

by American Storm Troopers.

568917,1,6303101224,"Make no mistake, this is an Oliver Stone movie about Oliver Stone. It has almost zero insight into the Vietnam War, but plenty into Stone's bad relationship with his father, which his psyche has turned into an almost Obama-esque hatred of America (film is dedicated to his mother).

How a writer/director of interest and talent could go from making Platoon and El Salvador to this pile of drivel is almost unimaginable. It is beautifully shot, and Tommy Lee Jones is heroic considering it is not his movie. The big problem is the actress playing the lead is a) not even Vietnamese, b) a horrific actress, her accent changes even within sentences, c) not pretty enough to be differentiated from all the other pretty young girls the way the story does. She is totally unsympathetic and a hypocrite. Refusing to be a prostitute when desperate, she nonetheless is willing to screw two soldiers once the price gets high enough, but still plays the innocent at every opportunity.

Oliver Stone hates America. This is no secret from his films and interviews. But his hypocrisy in making big expensive American movies is profound. Go hang out with your buddy Fidel. Maybe he has an old 16 mm camera you can borrow.

In Oliver Stone's Heaven and Earth it's the Americans and South Vietnamese who throw suspected Viet Cong out of helicopters and worse. The Viet Cong are humble, happy, helpful, wanting only to free the people from centuries of oppression under France and Japan. That the new masters will be Chinese no one mentions. That we betrayed our southern allies so profoundly is never mentioned. The fall of Saigon is set up, and then we cut to San Diego and it is never mentioned again.

If you really want to understand Mr. Stone, watch this and Joy Luck Club (which he produced and has some of the same actors). That will tell you everything about him, if you can bear these tedious films.

I would not bother to even watch this movie or comment, if it were not that I was an early fan of Mr. Stone. I saw El Salvador in the theatre on its initial release and was fascinated. Platoon obviously made him, and that worked because of its tight focus on the good and evil sergeants  battling for the soul of Charlie Sheen (how funny is that in retrospect?). His casting of James Woods, Jim Belushi, Willem Defoe, Tom Beringer and the supporting cast of Platoon verged on brilliant. Here, aside from Jones, he has completely gone off the rails.

Many reviewers write apologia for this film saying because it is based on two memoirs they had to leave a lot of stuff out. That's pretty lame, every film maker working from a book has to deal with that issue.

The definitive film about America in Vietnam will one day be found in a well made movie about Dien Bien Phu. (it is not Apocolypse Now either, thought that is the standard for now).

It may never be made, America has moved on to new Hells. It certainly won't be made by Oliver Stone.",1436140800,,2937,4.5896946564885495

Ngor in his final performance, and Hiep Thi Le in her acting debut. In this powerful drama, Le Ly(Le)is a innocent victim of the horrors of the Vietnam War. After being raped and molested and had her newborn child taken from her, Le Ly seemingly found happiness with U.S. Marine Dennis Hayslip(Jones), and the two got married and moved to Los Angeles to begin a better life, only for Le Ly to found herself being assaulted by Dennis and shunned by her in-laws. The DVD also has special features include a orchestra soundtrack by composer Kintaro, and a trailer for the film.

Scenery and sets whether in gorgeous rural Vietnam, bustling Saigon, or San Diego burbs create an appropriate sense of place and mood. Having not read the book which seems to be a spoiler for an otherwise great movie, I can comment that on its own merits ""Heaven and Earth"" is powerful, moving, and believable. Director Stone has successfully shifted from the battlefield heroism of American combatant grunts in ""Platoon"" to a disturbing view of American intervention and the collateral damage caused by war and warriors. No tedious blatant anti-war rant here tho, but rather a showcase for a heroine converting extreme suffering to an opportunity for self betterment.",1369699200,3,773,5.142857142857143
569177,5,6303101224,"This film is a bitterly heartbreaking story that is often incredibly painful to sit through. Sobering and realistic, This true story follows a young vietnamese girl and her family torn apart by the horrors of war and chaos. This is about the scars of war, the remnants of war, about those directly and indirectly effected by war. Forced to fight for the VC brigades for a time, then against them at another, this young girl was raped, tortured, despised by her own village and seen as a traitor. Her story is only one of many such stories. Young women caught in the middle of death and horror so unbelievable that it seems very hard to comprehend to those of us who have never experienced such agonies. She meets a soldier played by Tommy Lee Jones who merely wants to find someone to embrace and care for. He takes her and her one very young child to live with him in america. Jones by the way gives such a powerful, touching and painfully honest performance as a man filled with love who cant come to terms with the horrors he was forced to commit in the time of war. His performance left me breathless, utterly breathless. The pain and utter feelings of ruin his performance delivers is freightening and truly heartbreaking. It had me in bitter tears. Indeed I cried through most of the the last half of this film. Its a very sad and painful story but also truly touching at the same time. It takes a bit of time to get used to the rythem of the film and the feel for the acting. Particularly people who are supposed to be playing Vietnamese villagers all speaking in clear english. But after awhile it grows on you. It was also nice to see Haing S. Ngor in this film. He was brilliant in The Killing Fields, and it was sad that his life was cut short after he was gunned down in front of his home in Los Angeles in a drive by shooting in the early 90s, which ended his short but impressive acting career..",1367884800,2,1909,4.365168539325842
569178,5,6303101224,"Like most information rich Oliver Stone Movies - must be viewed three times. First, just watch the movie and its movie sound track. Second, watch the movie while listening to the commentary track. Third, watch the movie and its movie soundtrack a second time - now knowing the background information of the unexplained images that you now see - to understand in depth everything that transpired. Oliver Stone movies are generally very well researched and there is a lot of information in the images of the movies that you either already know about from your own knowledge, life experience, or you become informed about when listening to the move commentary. Like most of his movies, there is an issue cutting a movie to get close to the 1.5 hour attention span limit that Hollywood has determined. This one even goes a little longer than Hollywood might like.

This movie is a sleeper in that, as explained at the end of the commentary track, it was released in theaters roughly at the same time as the movie Schindler's List. Plus movie goers are not able to listen to a commentary track. It might also be difficult at that time, for some to view a real life Asian perspective to the Vietnamese conflict. Just as in Schindler's List, depending on your perspective, is another real life story and a compelling look at the ROI of warfare capitalism.

As Oliver Stone was a combat GI in Vietnam, his own story chronicled by Charlie Sheen's character in his movie Platoon, he has a deeper understanding of that conflict and that country as seen both through his own eyes as a young American GI. Later  through the eyes of a young Vietnamese girl - the main character of this film. This Vietnamese girl came up in a country in conflict. She first helped the Vietcong, then scratched out a living off the edges of the war business, then married an American GI (Tommy Lee's Character) and moved to the US. Complete culture shock.

This movie is fascinating on many levels. War plays a part, but is not the main conflict. The conflict in this movie is more on a personal and spiritual level. You will think about this one after viewing. I would call it Stones second best - first being JFK and second being Nixon.

We have had our ups and downs over the last 40 years so as I said it is very easy for me to understand what the Vietnamese felt the way they were used and treated by both sides even those that worked as Bar Girls those that had sex for money in a lot of cases they were mistreated by the Soldiers paying for this pleasure as to many they had come in from operations and these poor girls become the enemy they have just been fighting and all their aggression is taken out on the girls, also the girls in doing this bring dishonour on their families back in the villages.
At the end you see how during a war a brother can be on one side and the sisters are exploiting the Soldiers and they both end up in America also the mother wishes she had never sent her son  away to fight with the Communist army to me they were a family in the middle and not believed by either side.

Anyone who wants to call this War a conflict, or police action needs to go back in their rooms and stay there..
I am a Marine Viet Nam Veteran, wounded, and was in a deep penetration Reconnaissance unit as played by Tommy Lee Jones.
This takes place at the fall of South Vietnam, after Tommy Lee Jones has fallen in love with a young Vietnamese  woman, and as Saigon gates fall to Russian tanks and the city burns, Jones rescue's his girl friend/lover, and gets her on an aircraft out, they resettle in Camp Pendleton, Calif. while he continues his service in the Marine Corps.  Problems develop  between the two, leading to tragedy.
This movie was just recently viewed in it's entirety in Saigon/Ho Chi Minn City at the American Center of the American State Department at their Consulate.  This was the first time that this movie has ever been shown in Viet Nam, and was widely received.
As a Retired United States Marine disabled from Viet Nam service in 69-70, I thought this movie was tremendous the first time I ever viewed it.

It's when they have to speak English when they are talking to Americans, but speaking English in Vietnam with other Vietnamese irked me a lot while watching this film.

569292,4,6303101224,"""Heaven & Earth"" is a war-drama genre film which is based on Le Ly Hayslip's book ""When Heaven and Earth Changed Places"" and ""Child of War, Woman of Peace.""

The movie does have some variation to the books in terms of events and characters but notwithstanding this the film narrative captures many of the significant points of Hayslip's story.

It is the lesser acclaimed of Stone's Vietnam War film trilogy as it doesn't receive the same attention as ""Platoon"" and ""Born on the Fourth of July."" Yet Haylip's story provides a unique perspective as she finds herself thrust in the middle of a drive for a united Vietnam and two separate wars crash the stability of her life.

Haylip's journey to the U.S. is one that exposes her to a whole different culture and way of life, and it is the partnership of her Vietnamese heritage and new surroundings in America which presents her with personal challenges and new opportunities.

It is an inspiring story and Tommy Lee Jones (Steve Butler) and Hiep Thi Le (Le Ly Hayslip) provide a strong screen presence which complements a dynamic plot.

It shows a young girl's experience in war torn Vietnam, she one of the fortunate ones that did not perish but instead learns to deal with the loss of innocence, her family, her way of life and her home.  She adapts to each tragic event and becomes stronger along the way.  The genius of the film is that it shows the extreme beauty of the country and the people alongside the extreme brutal nature of invaders and those trying to survive their circumstances in war. It deals with a young girl's search for love, torture, senseless killing, loss of family members, unwanted pregnancy, fitting into a new culture of insensitive people, domestic violence, suicide and finally a trip back to her home. Where she finds out about the way the new regime affected its survivors.  Finally making peace out of all she experienced good and bad.  I have never seen a more beautiful Oliver Stone movie.

569296,4,6303101224,"... and shamefully true. Oliver Stone's 1993 film ""Heaven and Earth"" is based entirely on the published autobiography of Le Ly Hayslip. It's a rather different sort of film from Stone's other works, and a less successful drama than he usually creates. Much of the problem results from Stone's one major deviation from the facts of Hayslip's memoir; he chose to  amalgamate three men into one, the American who brings Le Ly to San Diego as his wife and who then turns abusive, the character named `Steve Butler' in the film. Actor Tommy Lee Jones strove valiantly to make Steve Butler convincing, but the effort was wasted. The guy in the film goes every which way at once, both too good and too bad to be believed.

Since this is Le Ly Hayslip's story and film far more than Stone's, I think we need some knowledge of her as a real person, well-known in the California Vietnamese community. Hayslip was the youngest of seven children born and raised in Ky La, now Xa Hao Qui, a village in central Vietnam, near Da Nang. American military advisors arrived in her village when she was 12 years old. At 14, she was tortured in a South Vietnamese government prison for ""revolutionary sympathies"". After being released, she fell under suspicion in her own village, which was in fact supportive of the  North Vietnamese, of being a government spy. She was sentenced to death by the Viet Cong, but instead of killing her, her executioners raped her. She fled to Saigon, where she and her mother worked as housekeepers for a wealthy Vietnamese family, the `man' of which family seduced her. When her pregnancy was discovered, the `wife' of the family forced Hayslip and her mother fto flee to Da Nang. By the age of 16, Hayslip was supporting both her mother and an infant son while working in the black market, as a drug courier, and once as a prostitute. She worked for a while as a nurse assistant in a Da Nang hospital and began dating Americans. She had several heartbreaking affairs before meeting and marrying an American civilian contractor named Ed Munro in 1969. Although he was more than twice her age, she had another son with him. Hayslip moved to California with Munro and briefly supported her family as a homemaker. In 1973, Munro died of emphysema, leaving Le Ly a widow at age 24. In 1974, she married Dennis Hayslip. Dennis was a heavy drinker, clinically depressed, and full of rage. Her third and youngest son, Alan, was fathered by Dennis and born on her 26th birthday. The couple filed for divorce in 1982. Shortly thereafter, he was found dead in a parked van outside a school building. He had established a trust fund, however, that left his wife with some money. With this money, she began a series of investments in real estate, the stock market, and small businesses that would eventually make her quite well off. She went on to found the East Meets West Foundation, a charitable group dedicated to improving the health and welfare of the Vietnamese, and the Global Village Foundation for humanitarian and emergency assistance to the needy in Vietnam and some other countries of Asia. Oliver Stone's film ends with Le Ly returning to visit her mother and other relatives in her village, roughly thirteen years after the fall of the South Vietnamese government.
The film begins with Le Ly's over-over description of her childhood prior to the battle of Dien Bien Phu and the partition of Vietname into North and South. Le Ly tells us that she was born in ""the most beautiful village in the world"" and simultaneously Oliver Stone's cinematography shows us exactly that, The Most Beautiful Village in the World! as an idyllic paradise in saturated colors, an Eden of Buddhist ""right living."" This is one of the awkwardnesses of the film; the scene is just too fairy-tale perfect not to alarm our skepticism; it does, however, set us up for the shock of seeing the village devastated by war, crushed under tank treads by day and ravaged by guerillas by night, as the South Vietnamese and Americans swap turns with the Viet Cong in brutalizing Le Ly's family and neighbors. The breathtaking beauty of the village also contrasts sharply with the ugliness and squalor of wartime Saigon, and the ugliness and prosperity of suburban San Diego.

Yes, the Viet Cong are portrayed less as noble independence fighters than as violent and vengeful oppressors. Likewise, when Le Ly returns to her now-Communist homeland, all is far from utopian. Oliver Stone would make no bones, I'm sure, about declaring that the French and American colonial wars in Vietnam were shameful episodes of brutality and corruption. Most of the world would agree. The Vietnam War brought suffering and loss upon the people of Vietnam for which there was, and is, no excuse or justification. But Stone is not blind to the savagery of the Viet Cong or to the truth that the aftermath of the North Vietnamese victory was not the restoration of paradise.

The portrayal in this film of the Americans in Vietnam during the War, however, is far more shocking. They are defilers of the Vietnamese culture as well as destroyers of the Vietnamese landscape. Unfortunately, that portrayal is entirely true, and the shame that it represents in American history needs to be admitted. No occupying army ever behaved more vilely than the Americans (no, of course, not ALL of them) in Vietnam. In this way, America is anything but ""exceptional.""

The portrayal of Americans at home -- the Americans of Steve Butler's family -- is more embarrassing than shocking. And Steve Butler, once he asserts his real nature, is the ugliest American-who-brings-home-an-Oriental-wife any critic of America could imagine. This is Le Ly's story, however, and it represents Le Ly's honest perception of America and American values. It's not a flattering perception. One can howl in outrage that Le Ly is ungrateful, that she's damned lucky to have made it to the Land of Opportunity, and such outrage is partially fair. Only the worst of America is depicted in Le Ly's memories. I can testify from experience, however, that Le Ly's caustic perceptions of American culture have been the common perceptions of millions of immigrants, many of whom have felt no need to be grateful for being treated like dirt. Anyway, director Oliver Stone has let Le Ly hae her say, has been faithful to her revelations of self.

Stone has alos been faithful to Le Ly's enunciation of Buddhist ethics. There's a lot of Buddhist ""wisdom"" expressed in this fil, both in Le Ly's words, in those of her father, and in the words of Buddhist priests whom Le Ly consults. One doesn't need to believe in reincarnation, or to have much understanding of Buddhist philosophy, to recognize that ""karma"" is a valid concept in judging Le Ly's life story, and even more valid when applied to the history of the Vietnam War. America acquired a copious stock of ""bad karma"" in that war; even the few people who still maintain the justice of it would ahve to agree. And that ""bad karma"" has been playing out in the violent, hate-raddled polarization of American politics and culture ever since.",1294963200,3,7110,4.81342062193126

569398,5,6303101224,"I love most Oliver Stone films, though some of them I would never want to watch again because of how gritty they are. ""Born on the Fourth of July"" and ""Platoon"" come to mind - spectacular films, but I got a good enough eyeful at my first viewings of them. ""Wall Street"" and ""Natural Born Killers"" I do not wish to view again either, but for entirely different reasons.

Then we have ""Heaven & Earth,"" the magnificent, very distressing, sweeping saga of Ley Ly Hayslip, a Vietnamese national who experiences the French occupation of her country, the atrocity of the Vietnam War, the immigration to America, the vicarious ramifications of post-traumatic stress syndrome, and the unanticipated return to her native village. This is Oliver Stone at his directorial zenith! This is Tommy Lee Jones at his frightening best! This is Hiep Thi Le's (Ley Ly), brilliant debut! And this is Kitaro with creative genius on the motion picture score!

Le's narration adds particular melancholy to the film. She sounds like she could have literally experienced the horrors of the woman she portrays. Ley Ly goes through hell on earth, folks! She is caught between the forces of the north and the south - neither of whom trust her; she and her family are forced to suffer the consequences for it. Men only seek to exploit her, and for a good while they succeed. However she meets Steve Butler (Jones) who does not want to manipulate her, but desires her for his wife. She mistrusts him initially, but Butler is persistent and kind. So she acquiesces. They marry and then leave Vietnam during the furious over-running of the south by the Viet Cong.

They happily arrive in America. Unfortunately, as time progresses Butler finds it much more difficult to adapt to life there than does his wife who is there for the first time. The demons of war that had been sleeping in his head come back to life, and wreak havoc for him and his family. The cataclysmic fallout eventually drives Ley Ly back home to her village in Vietnam, and she discovers her true worth and place in this world.

This film will stay with me forever; I will watch it again and again. Of all the narration Ley Ly speaks, I liked best when she said in the movie's final moments:

Also, she was not dramatically rescued by him in a helicopter after getting caught up in a tide of fleeing refugees. In real life, her departure from the country was rather uneventful and took place in 1970 after her husband had already returned to the States. Read the book first.",1264809600,,637,4.953271028037383
569401,5,6303101224,"I love , LOVE this movie.  It was so powerful and the rape scene was done
excellent I thought.  I also loved how Tommy Lee Jone's character was so tortured.
I had almost a similar experience.  When I was 14 I was on my own, ( long story)
and I rode freight trains with two Vietnam Vets .  The things I heard, the wails,
the sobs was scary .  They also sniffed gold spray paint and drank wine, and paint
makes you see things that aren't there, and whatever is in your mind is like
it comes to life .  One man died in a shootout with police, the other shot a policeman and then commited suicide a year after the first one.  Tommy Lee
Jones commiting suicide brought all those things back to me .  The way he did it
was so real .

The movie was also so inspiring to me . It amazes me how people from other countries come here and work hard and get ahead , as the woman did in the movie.

I was looking for presents for my Vietnamese friends and came across this movie.

I""ve watched it over and over , but haven't seen it for many years.  I think I""ll
buy it .  I could honestly say it was one of the best movies I've ever seen .",1261526400,,1126,3.907488986784141

569404,5,6303101224,"This was an exceptionally beautiful and thought provoking movie, which I shall always carry with me.  You are exposed to a difficult way of life with many hardships, which force you to have to make choices to survive which change the characters forever.  I decided this was a very worthwhile movie, after reading Roger Ebert's review.  The movie is true and based upon a book.  The acting was exceptional by the main characters.  You could feel Lei's pain and confusion in Viet Nam, and America.  Her expectations with her new husband, Tommy Lee' Jones, who I feel is always flawless, in his acting ability, was more shocking and disappointing,(to her) I think than usual, because she understandably expected so much.  She was also torn between Buddism and Christianity which was a huge factor in the movie.  The concepts of both religions are so opposite and she tried so hard to meet his expectations, which was impossible.  He sank into such a deep depression, he was beyond help and the consequences were tragic and heart moving.  The entire movie, gave you so much to think about and understand an entire different culture, if you are American.  I definitely have to watch this movie one or two more times as I only viewed it once and there is so much to absorb.  I never realized Viet Nam was such a beautiful country before all the wars.  I was totally ignorant of the history, which was overwhelming.  I think pain and helplessness was a part of the theme along with heartache and finally some sort of acceptance and peace.  She was a very strong, and determined woman.  She fought to find salvation.  This movie is a must see, and as I stated, I must watch it a couple more times.  Maybe, I should have reviewed later on.  I feel my  thought,  even after one viewing, will change one's understanding of war, loss,  culture ,terror, fear, love and acceptance.",1235779200,,1867,4.68

I liked the fact that Tommy Lee Jones was a tad off, it really fits him and i don't think anyone else with a weathered face and warm smile could have done a better job.

Kitaro and its music, the beautiful scenery are but a glimpse of what the East has to offer to the West... and the West and specially the American way of life, even though it seems to be the solution for the WOMAN, it is so poor at the end that love becomes a real tragedy.

saved her children and achieved freedom.

569464,5,6303101224,"This film was recommended to me by amazon.com because of my previous purchases of movies concerning the Vietnam War.  Every previous film that I have purchased gave the view of the war from the perspective of the American men who fought there.  This is the first film that I have seen that truly showed the side of the story from a Vietnamese viewpoint.

It is a gut wrenching saga of one young girl who grows into womenhood in a war torn country.  In the beginning of the film little is mentioned by how much harm the French caused in Vietnam.  Very little is said about the harm that the Chinese and Japanese caused either.  But both are mentioned in the film.

This young girl lives in a village that has stood for 1000's of years and has been victimized by so many wars.  Her village is then torn between supporting the Viet Cong and the South Vietnamese and American governments and their troops.  Her village is torn apart as well as her family.

Not to go to far into the plot or divulge to much information, I can only say that this movie touched my heart like no other.  I would have to rate it right up there with some of the best films I have ever seen.  It is well worth the effort to purchase and view.  I will see this film over and over.

Thank you, amazon.com, for recommending this film to me.",1136764800,3,1310,4.293877551020408
569465,5,6303101224,"This is a great story, a sad story, an uplifting story, etc.  The ride this film has given to the viewer is at least insightful and at most inspirational and soulful.  ""Child of Peace"" sums it all up.",1131321600,3,200,4.2368421052631575
569466,4,6303101224,"""Heaven and Earth"" is a difficult movie to tackle.  The almost-true story of Le Ly Hayslip,  it is a beautiful, compelling story of a peasant girl caught up in the madness of the American/Viet Nam war, not knowing which side to take and ultimately attempting just to stay alive and find some happiness.

Almost-true, because her amazing story needed to be condensed into a two and a half hour feature film.  Three men became one, years became weeks and vast sections of her life were neatly trimmed away.  This is understandable in any biographical film, but the result her is not so fluid as in other movies of this type.  Also, an odd decision was made to film the movie entirely in English, except when interacting with American soldiers when they slip into a sort of broken English.  Having the film be in Vietnamese, with subtitles, would have made for a more authentic experience.

Tommy Lee Jones' character, the three men condensed into one, jumps too quickly from Hero to Monster to Victim, and one seeks for the core of his character in the movie.  Who is he?  It is difficult to tell.  Hiep Thi Le as Le Ly is also confusing, at one minute the innocent, wide-eyed girl looking to be loved and the next a sophisticated businesswoman who is willing to sacrifice everything for success and money.  As seen in ""Evita,"" this kind of transformation isn't impossible to tell but here it doesn't seem honest.  One looks for the sophisticate in the peasant or the peasant in the sophisticate, and doesn't find them.

In spite of these criticisms, there is enough right about ""Heaven and Earth"" to make the film enjoying and captivating.  Telling the American/Viet Nam war from the point of view of the Vietnamese people is a jarring juxtaposition, and something I have never seen done before.  Such a daring feat would be almost impossible in today's political climate of the US.  Le Ly's story takes her through all walks of life and many aspects of the war, giving you something to think about at each stage.

The cinematography is beautiful, and the colors and textures of Viet Nam make it seem like a paradise.  The paradise is shattered by wars, with the green rice being overrun by the green tank and soldiers.  In such a situation, it is difficult to tell who is right and who is wrong, with each side putting guns to your head ordering you to believe their ideology.

I am glad to see this version of the DVD being released, with Hiep Thi Le on the cover instead of Tommy Lee Jones.  Good as he is, he is in only about 30 minutes of the film, and certainly doesn't deserve the cover.",1117756800,48,2593,4.579175704989154
569467,5,6303101224,This movie follows one girl's life before and after the Vietnam War. This movie is both beautiful and sad. You watch as this simple farm girl has many hardships and adversities she must overcome. You get drawn into this movie you start fighting for the character to survive. You want her to overcome all obstacles. I truly enjoyed watching this movie. It made me remember how lucky I am and how unlucky I could be.,1117324800,4,414,4.533333333333333
569468,5,6303101224,"A wonderful movie about how the war affected the Vietnamese people and their ideals. The movie starts with a sweeping panorama of the idyllic and simple countryside where we see hard working people, tilling the land and surviving as they had for thousands of years. Suddenly, their lives are transformed into a nightmare by the occupation of US and French troops, and later by the vicious and murderous Viet Cong. The brutality is a little too graphic for my tastes, especially the  torture scenes involving Lee Ly Hayslip (played by Hiep Thi Le), and her VC captors. She experiences rape and humiliation, and barely escapes death as her village is burned to the ground.
She escapes to Saigon, becomes pregnant by her employer, and is sent into the streets by his wife. She turns to prostitution, and finally marries GI Steve Butler (Tommy Lee Jones), who transports her to America, where she experiences a new kind of prejudice. She gets a job, and her husband slowly turns insane, carrying wartime nightmares into real life. Unable to stay with him, she leaves him, and he  commits suicide. She returns to her native village, introduces her son to his real father. Then, she reunites with her family who tell her the horrors they endured during her absence. She is now a rich entrepeneur and her parents accept her change. She sees how heaven and earth moved for her as she experiences two worlds that merge simultaneously.

569469,5,6303101224,"""Heaven and Earth"" is a lesser known sibling of other Vietnam-centric epics from Oliver Stone -- ""Platoon"" and ""Born on the 4th of July"". It is as brilliant a testament of Vietnam's devastatation as any of the others from Stone, but there is a reason why this film remains no more than a blip on international radars.
The movie begins with the same stunning cinematography that you expect from Richardson, and pulls you in immediately. We follow the simple lives of Vietnamese rural folk (surrounding by idyllic fields, mountains, and a deliciously ordinary every-day life between the ""Heaven & Earth""). But this song and dance is jerked 20 minutes into the movie by the Viet Cong (VC) and other ""bad bad"" people on either side of the war -- the rebels on one side, and the US-aided forces on the other.  Stone leaves no stone unturned, no gruesome detail uncaught on tape, no rape missed -- it's gruesome to watch, and more so for some viewers because it requires you to think.
But that's where the good stuff ends.
The movie is loooong. Nearly 2.5 hours of mindbending mayhem, with a whole barrage of twists and turns. Our simple village girl from Vietnam escapes with Tommy Lee Jones, but finds that  US has communist contours of its own, where her overweight sister in law forces her to eat a lot of meat and food, where her husband's friend gratuitously talks about his ""fetish"" for ""Oriental women"" too, her husband is an arms dealer and a wife-beater, etc etc.
The movie is full of platitudes. Sappy stuff like ""Different skin, same suffering."" The theme of war-time atrocities on the innocent,  the futility of war, are all very well but nothing new. This was supposedly the Vietnamese perspective, the ordinary person's perspective etc...but an hour into the movie it becomes difficult to care without much happening.
The movie has a whiny, annoying actress for a protagonist. She simply does not measure up to the rigor and depth of the role, and surely seems like a sour spouse for Lee Jones.
But the worst possible thing about the movie is it ending -- it beats you over the head with the point. For the most part fans of thrillers aren't dumb, although it seems the director doesnt realize that.
A worthy rental for sure, but not a movie I could watch more than once.",1077235200,11,2280,4.6807980049875315
569549,4,6303101224,"I thought the movie was highly enjoyable and overall entertaining. But, there were a lot of themes, and they were all mashed into one, so it wasn't quite clear what the movie was trying to get across. There was Le Ly against her own human nature, her religion, and her needs. And throughout the movie it would focus on one of those ideas, but it would never really be resolved and therefore it was left just floating around. For example, Le Ly against her religion. She couldn't leave her husband Steve to just be self destructive, and suicidal but if she helped him, shed be going against her Buddhist ideals because she volunteered to give up her religion for him. But, if she didn't her karma would be off balance and she would never reach any type of peace within herself. The movie never really resolved that conflict, even with Steves suicide. Was she really ready to give up her faith for him? After he died that theme was sort of just left out to dry.
Another thing I was confused about was why Tommy Lee Jones was made out to be the main character of the movie, and the entire thing was supposed to be him or something. In fact, the back of the movie box said he, lead the cast, but, there was no leading of the cast by Jones. He was good in the role he was supposed to play; he was creepy and dangerous yet somehow he had a redeeming quality to him that made you feel sorry for him. But he was in the movie for a total of maybe thirty minutes and then he died. Yes, he was a big character and was important to the story, but his acting didn't burn through the screen like white phosphorus.
I thought the movie was very realistic. It was based on a true story, so it was very factual and accurate in its representations of events.  I think that it tried to take the viewer from one part of history to the present, and to portray what life is like in Vietnam for the people living there. There was no holding back in the scenes, and there was no sugar coating of events. Le Ly was brutally raped by a fellow villager, her entire village was burned down, people she loved were tortured, even she was tortured, and her husband even held a loaded gun to head, ready to pull the trigger.
The visions of Vietnam that Stone presented the viewer were absolutely amazing. It is a more beautiful country than I ever thought, and the cinematography was excellent. One scene that stuck out to me was when Le Ly and her mother were working as servants and Le Ly fell in love with the house head. This scene stuck out to me especially because of the colors. The house itself was very white and beautiful, and the way that the cameras caught the angles of the sunlight was really dazzling.
The movie definitely held my interest. It never dragged and it was really interesting the way Stone took us, the viewers, into all the aspects of the life of Le Ly. I hate to use this clich, but it really was a roller coaster of emotions. I cried in some parts, laughed in other parts, was touched, was inspired, and was hurt right along with Le Ly. I really enjoyed watching the movie, beginning to end.",1055116800,6,3088,4.314974182444062
569550,4,6303101224,"Oliver Stone adapted this 1993 film from book written by Le Ly Hayslip, who is now a successful businesswoman in California.  She had an idyllic life in her Vietnamese village once.  But first there were the French, and then there were the Americans and the Viet Cong.  She was mistreated by both sides, winding up in Saigon with a baby.  Eventually, she married an American serviceman and moved to America.  But her troubles didn't end there.
Hiep Thi Le, cast as the woman, does an outstanding job.  And Tommy Lee Jones is wonderful in his role as the American serviceman.  The cinematography was excellent and all the actors seemed real and authentic.  I was fascinated by the story, which was indeed horrific.  There were some deeply moving moments too, especially as they applied to family relationships.  Most of all, though, it all rang true.
Even though it was a little overlong, I totally enjoyed it.  I found myself really identifying with the Vietnamese people and admiring the strength of Le Ly as she struggled to survive.  The film spans more than 30 years, and brings the viewer back to Vietnam where it all began.

As a Vietnam veteran, I was captivated by the cinematography and the sense of Vietnam that Stone captured so well.
I highly recommend the DVD, not just for the superiority over video, but also for Stone's commentary. I thought his comments on the DVD, Born on the Fourth of July, were excellent, but in Heaven and Earth we get even better. Not only does he talk about the process of filming the movie, but also he talks at length about the plight of the Vietnamese, the destruction of Vietnam's infrastructure and Buddhism.

569552,3,6303101224,"In my opinion the movie tried to include too much information into a two hour slot, and at times left out many of the more critical and interesting aspects that were detailed in the book.  Stone should have continued the story of Le Ly's experiences in America in a separate film and concentrated more fully and accurately on the effects of the war within Vietnam, including descriptions from each side of the enemy lines.
I also found the scenes where Le Ly returned to Vietnam after liberation a bit cheesey and sentimental and the film omitted the fact that this journey, in reality, was much more dangerous and unnerving.  In fact Le Ly did not even return to her village, Ky La, on this trip, nor did she return with her children!  There was so much more that Stone could have made of this storyline, the section of the book which I found the most remarkable and fascinating.
In addition, the film also left out details of the relationships within the family, for example, between Le Ly and her father and her brother, which incidently were forgotten about during the movie.  It didn't explain what happened to her family throughout the course of the war.  Other aspects of Le Ly's earlier experiences with the Viet Cong were also omitted and I feel that much more could have been made of these storylines.
However, apart from these critcisms, I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie and Stone, having fought in the war himself, portrayed the country from a moving and realsitic angle.  In fact the film portrayed Vietnam (although it was not filmed in Vietnam) as a beautiful and attractive place where I would love to visit.
My final point is that those who enjoyed the movie should read the book, as it is much more intense and is unreservedly compelling.",1014076800,27,1760,4.679611650485437

Oliver Stone is an excellent director, and features of the movie such as light and camera angles and the movement of the camera are excellent. The acting is good too. Tommy Lee Jones has an impossible role, but in each scene he is convincing. Hiep Thi Le's role is also impossible, and she is not bad. Those who have read the book will be happy to see Le Ly Hayslip herself playing the jewelry dealer in the middle of the movie. The soundtrack by Kitaro is fair, although my personal tastes disagree.
The problem is that Le Ly Hayslip's story, upon which this movie is based, is too complex for a two hour movie. Tommy Lee Jones' character is an amalgamation of three men, and the result is nothing if not schizophrenic.

569557,4,6303101224,"I saw this movie when I was twelve, and I was too young to understand its themes. I was like: This movie is all gore and no fun.
But I saw it just now, at age eighteen, and as a more mature person, I understand the theme of this movie: KARMA.
Le Ly speaks about her karma throughout the movie, she even gets advice from monks about it. I watched this film and just thought: This is what life is about, yes!
The past couple of years of my life, I have learned, like Le Ly, that you pay for your sins from this life--and even past lives. I have had to deal with great pain like Le Ly, and have questioned God's intent.
Le Ly's story is inspirational in that she teaches us not to question our fate, but simply to give it our all. She is not a flawless human being, she is a human being. She will pay for what she's done, and continue to learn about the laws of life.
This movie is somewhat long, but it's difficult to pick parts to delete, cuz it all works for the whole movie. The two lead performances were amazing, as well as the supporting cast. The score and the cinematography was gorgeous--the views of the cascades of Vietnam and village life.
I have learned a lot from this movie. I will treasure the story of Le Ly for years to come; it is one of strength, endurance, and resilience.",976838400,2,1291,4.147410358565737

Plus Stone's editorial comment deletes & inserts. Bottom line -does not capture the spirit of the story at all.  Tommy Lee Jones plays an unrealistic composite character with un-nuanced woodenness, probably the description of the entire film.",1519344000,,395,5.26984126984127

Images are mostly clear but the title and some scenes looks very pixelated. Not the typical HD quality of a BluRay.
Its worth adding to your collection but hope that theres another release to happen in the future,",1508803200,,353,4.619047619047619
