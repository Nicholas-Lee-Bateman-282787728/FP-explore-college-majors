8182559,5,B000O176YI,"My daughter found this episode on free-on-demand and her 4-month-old daughter would watch the whole thing every day when she got fussy - around 3 pm.  When it was removed from the free-on-demand my daughter panicked and I knew if anyone would have it, it would be Amazon.  I ordered it late on a Saturday and it arrived Monday!  Crisis averted.  She is now 7 months old and still enjoys it every afternoon.  It might be the parade music with the steady drum beat but she watches every part of it - the funniest part is the girl who loves her feet ""hello my name is girl and I love my feet"" but that's the opinion of an adult.",1398038400,,625,4.218487394957983
8182560,5,B000O176YI,"If your child loves Elmo they will love this DVD.  It is cute, funny, and educational. Your child will love marching to the song.",1338854400,,129,4.375
8182561,4,B000O176YI,This is a DVD of an episode. I did not realize that I guess I should have checked it out better before I bought. The episode was good but not what I was looking for.,1203984000,2,165,3.742857142857143
