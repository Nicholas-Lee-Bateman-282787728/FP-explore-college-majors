This collection has all the McLaren you ever wanted and more.

McLaren's art has integrity and vision. He is important to film history and world animation. Some films are less tan two minutes, other run to over twenty minutes. Some were drawn directly on 35mm film, some are puppet animation, cutout animation and some are pixilation. If you are interested in the art of animation, you should study this man.
