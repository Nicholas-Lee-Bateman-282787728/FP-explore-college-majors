7927347,5,B00004YKQF,"I have always loved Elizabeth Taylor, her movies are a classic.  I am into the old classic black and white.  Spencer Tracy sums it all up from the planning to the actual wedding.  This movie is so awesome. I loved the sequel from the baby announcement to the actual birth.",1524873600,,272,4.4
7927348,5,B00004YKQF,"Any movie with a young Elizabeth Taylor and Spencer Tracy in it cannot fail.  I could watch those two every day including this movie, Father's Little Dividend.",1399852800,,159,4.888888888888889
7927349,1,B00004YKQF,"Very disappointed.  While one of my favorite movies, it was almost

unwatchable due to the poor audio and video.  It was almost as if it were a tenth generation copy from a poor original.  I will not buy anything else produced by this company.",1114128000,33,243,4.454545454545454
