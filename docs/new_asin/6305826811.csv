1088167,5,6305826811,"I have to disagree with the negative comments regarding this movie. I love ""Coach."" I loved it when I first saw it on television when I was 15, and I love it today. Cathy Lee Crosby's character just breathes intelligence and decency. Her on-screen chemistry with the Michael Biehn character (in his first movie role) is nice to watch. Their relationship is based on a fair amount of sexual attraction (and shouldn't that be the case with a person with whom you're going to have a sexual relationship?) but it's also based on mutual admiration and respect. They LIKE each other. And they don't simply jump into bed together, they spend time over numerous dates getting to know each other before nature finally takes its course.

Perhaps many might argue that a 30ish female high school basketball coach shouldn't be having sex with one of her 18-year old players, no matter how perfect they are for each other, aside from the difference in their ages. In a typical movie, this would a morality tale, we'd see them both exposed, disgraced, Randy would lose her job, etc. Ah, the course of true love ne'er runs true. Downer! What I love, perhaps most of all, about this movie, is it doesn't do that. This is an anti-morality tale. (Not to be confused with an immorality tale - I consider both the main characters wonderfully principled folk.) In this movie, the two main characters defy convention, fall in love despite the fact many blue-noses might disapprove, they have a wonderful time, truly enjoy each other....and they GET AWAY WITH IT.",1061510400,11,1540,4.7677902621722845

She has rifts with Granger (Keenan Wynn) and agrees to quit if she wins. The film is a turn on as she had an affair with a student and enters the boys shower. The movie spends more time on her illicit relationship than basketball.

7897706,2,6305826811,"Coach (1978) combines a multitude of sports clichs, with some inappropriate conduct, as Cathy Lee Crosby (That's Incredible! (1980-84)), plays Randy Rawlings, a former gold medal winning Olympic athlete, who becomes the head coach of a boy's basketball team.  Some spoilers follow.

The basketball team at Granger High School needs a coach, and mistakenly believing that Rawlings is a male, the school offers the head coaching position to her.  Upon learning of the mistake, administrator Fenton Granger (Keenan Wynn) attempts to back out of the deal, but is forced to accept Rawlings, under the threat of legal action.

Much that happens appears formulaic and clichd, as the team initially rejects their new coach, and Granger instructs his grandson Bradley (Channing Clarkson), who is on the team, to give the new coach a rough time.  Rawlings doesn't seem to provide much instruction, but brings in former UCLA Bruin Sidney Wicks, to inspire the team.  She eventually wins them over, but must also overcome prejudice, and win games to keep her job.  Randy is also quite active off the court, becoming romantically involved with Jack Ripley (Michael Biehn,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminator/dp/B00AJER3SE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminator</a>&nbsp;(1984)), one of her players.

Back in 1978, the prime example of an ideal coach, would probably have been Ken Howard on the TV series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-White-Shadow/dp/B000AQ68SW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The White Shadow</a>, where an ex-NBA player attempts to mentor his players.  Coach Rawlings is a very different kind of role model, as it's apparently acceptable for a her to use whatever means are necessary, and sex with a male student is also kosher.  The athletic Cathy Lee Crosby does a pretty good job of acting, and comes across with some sensitivity, and not as a cheap slut.  Michael Biehn is quite charming in his feature film debut.

Finishing predictably with a furious rally and last second score, this breezy and cheesy B-grade comedy features few surprises on the court, but Rawlings' provocative behavior off the court does make for an interesting watch.  Coach is also included in the 12 movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Too-Cool-For-School-Collection/dp/B002DQSKMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Too Cool For School Collection</a>, a very low cost three disc set, featuring Crown International Pictures comedies released in the 70's and 80's.",1405814400,,2585,6.107734806629834
7897707,3,6305826811,"Seeing Cathy Lee Crosby as the original TV Wonder Woman sure got me interested in some of her other work. Yeah, I know, there's not much to choose from beyond her 4-year tenure as one of the three plasticine hosts of ABC's proto-reality show ""That's Incredible,"" but there is one golden nugget she did in 1978: a cheapie ""Drive-in"" flick called ""Coach."" Years before Craig T. Nelson would shamelessly usurp everyone's association with that titular character, Crosby starred as Randy Rawlings, hot blonde coach of a high-school basketball team, hired on a misunderstanding but soon able to whip the pack of pubescents into shape enough to win big, especially the big (spoiler alert) game at the end. Certainly a minor work, barely worthy of anyone's 96 minutes, but fitting in nicely to the inchoate teen-sex drama, which, in 1978, meant brief scenes of T&A, horny teens, a few of which engaging in (gasp) premarital sex, bad disco-funk on the soundtrack, and a few veteran character actors in supporting roles (Keenan Wynn, in this case).

Little of the plot I haven't already disclosed, except I should mention a then-unknown Michael Biehn plays a teen who gets romantically involved with Randy, and it actually does sustain until he end of the picture (we don't get the requisite breakup scene because she's ""too old"" for him). The sexist athletic department, of course, wants to be rid of the female coach ASAP, but she summons up the wherewithal, and knowledge of the then-new Equal Employment Act, to stay the course. Basketball scenes are fun, Crosby does an almost topless scene, 15-minute-famous artist Anthony Harris has some catchy soundtrack songs, and a subplot about hypnosis figures in to the film's payoff. What's not to love?

You can catch this for free on IMDB or buy it, like I did, as part of the 12-movie ""Too School For School"" DVD collection. The price is so low that your only real expenditure will be time. Two beers should get you through it, though.
