This is not good advertising, misleading to me because my expectation was the picture would be shown in color. If it was a bigger issue I would have returned this item same day.",1196812800,,259,4.531914893617022
7951559,3,B00005R25F,"The main thing I noticed about this set is that the image is DARK. I've got a few other Andy Griffith sets, and they all look better than this one. The sound is good, however, and in my opinion it's hard to call anything with Barney bad! It's inexplicable to me that they ditched the original theme music and replaced it with some lame synthesizer track. But I guess that doesn't ruin it entirely. I would recommend getting the complete 1st season from Paramount instead.

Also, I didn't realize when I ordered that this is the same as the Best of Barney and Best of Andy packaged together. Now I have duplicates of everything.

Here are the episodes:

Disc 1

* Class Reunion - Andy rekindles an old flame.

* Opie and the Spoiled Kid - Opie becomes friends with a rich kid.

* Aunt Bee's Medicine Man - Aunt Bee gets ""tipsy"" on Indian elixir.

* Rafe Hollister Sings - Andy discovers Rafe's talent.

* Andy Discovers America - Opie puts Andy's history knowledge to the test.

* The Darlings are Coming - Charelene sets her country cap for Andy.

* Mountain Wedding - Ernest T. Bass plots to stop Charlene's wedding.

 Disc 2

 * High Noon in Mayberry - An ex-convict returns to settle the score with Andy.

* The Great Filling Station Robbery - Barney tries modern criminal detection methods.

* The Rivals - Barney attempts to teach Opie the ways of women.

* Dogs, Dogs, Dogs - A pack of stray dogs make the courthouse home.

* The Loaded Goat - A farmer's goat makes a menacing mean of dynamite.

* Barney's First Car - A little old lady sells Barney a lemon.

* A wife for Andy - Barney goes fishing for a wife for Andy.
