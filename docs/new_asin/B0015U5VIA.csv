8260005,5,B0015U5VIA,"Would love to get an actual original but this copy is better than others I have seen.  One of the better low budget sword and sandal movies.  Not as long as the original movie and it has a red cast.  Otherwise, the quality is decent.",1524096000,,233,4.133333333333334
8260006,4,B0015U5VIA,"According Steve Reeves: "" I had much fun making this film. Both the cast and crew were great to work with and we shared many good times on the set"". Il terrore dei barbari is the best Chelo Alonso role. Usualy stunning, she's here better than ever, with the benefit of good dialogues and two amazing dance sequences, the first ones with swords, the second with torches. This italian edition is not the perfect ones (4:3 and not in 16:9) but the best and more complete print (91 mn) of this excellent peplum. American DVD (Wild East) is good but not complete (82 mn), and the French ones is the worst of the bag, a shortened version (78 mn) with an awful dark print. Can we expect one fine day a bluray  or at least a decent DVD in 16:9  ?<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Goliath-the-Barbarians-Goliath-the-Vampires/dp/B000X489HO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Goliath & the Barbarians, Goliath & the Vampires</a>",1347062400,,945,5.251655629139073
