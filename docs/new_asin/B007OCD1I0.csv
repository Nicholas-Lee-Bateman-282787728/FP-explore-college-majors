8519840,3,B007OCD1I0,"The collection is pretty good. But for me the only one that really value is the Prime 9. Exciting downcount for the best moments of baseball. 9 different countdowns with best hitting seasons, best pitching seasons, the -never-be-broken- records among others. The All century team is good but not superb video, the best 30 players in the 20th century and all of those players with 1 or 2 minutes of them history. But the really bust is the bloopers one. Chat, chat, chat, its like behind the scenes of baseball. how the players have fun, or something like that but the really good bloopers like fielders crash, or the colorful managers are out of the video. In one point the video is so boring.",1343692800,,693,4.596774193548387
