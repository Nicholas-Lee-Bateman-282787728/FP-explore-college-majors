1843085,4,B00008G6UM,"Like other reviewers, I found this to be good switch, but I've found a few limitations.  I discovered that when I attached my Sony Blu-ray player to my Sony Bravia KDL-V40 monitor through this switch, I could only get a picture on inputs 4 or 5 (the screen remained blank on inputs 1, 2 or 3, but the Blu-ray player did indicate that it had an HDMI link).  I had no problems getting a picture when attaching my Toshiba HD-A2 HD-DVD player on any input.  I then moved both players and the switch to my Panasonic PT-AE900U projector.  I had no problems getting a picture on all five inputs with either player.  I don't have a Sony Playstation, so I can't do any tests with one, but it may be somewhat finicky like my Blu-ray player.

In summary, some combinations of players and monitors may not work on all inputs through this switch.  In my case, this isn't a problem, I only had two devices to hook up.  Others may not find that limitation acceptable.",1176508800,17,952,4.4
1843086,5,B00008G6UM,"i was in need of a hdmi switcher so i could only run one cable to my projector.  i am very pleased with it. does exactly what its supposed to do. unlike the other reviewers my ps3 works on all inputs.  this is great product and alot cheaper than any other hdmi switch, with this many inputs, out there.  my one problem is the description says 5 port hdmi switch w/ remote control and cable. this led me to believe that an hdmi cable came with it. it doesnt. i thought this is why it was priced .$30 higher than monoprice.it should say and ""POWER"" cable. i still give it 5 stars bc its a great product.",1171584000,7,601,4.119658119658119
1843087,4,B00008G6UM,"I bought this switch so that I could specifically connect my cable box, dvd and PS3 to my Sony television that only has one HDMI input.  I was on the verge of returning it when I saw the review below that said that the PS3 will only work on Port 5.  Had I not seen that I would have returned it.

The performance of the unit plus the cost definitely puts it on a 5-star level but the lack of meaningful instructions I dropped it to a 4-star",1168473600,36,440,3.977272727272727
1843088,5,B00008G6UM,"First off it worked great and is very nice looking (small).  This is the cheapest HDMI switch with 5-port I found, but also the most expense video switch I ever bought also.  Component switch only run between 20-50 buck.  I use this to switch between the PS3 and DVD up-converter and it is very responsive.  Got quick delivery from lusopc.

The manufacture is Monoprice and HDMI Switcher is just the product name.  A couple of other manufactures use this same hardware, just slapping their own brand on it.  My TV is a 32"" Vizio displaying 1080i and see no image lost at all.  HDMI 1.3 cable and switch are compatible with older version.  Only the devices (PS3, stero reciever) that output that need to be 1.3 compatible.  This is not like the USB upgrade to USB2.  My PS3 output to 1 and DVD to 2.",1167955200,7,798,4.43448275862069
1843089,5,B00008G6UM,"Since this is my first experience with an HDMI switch I'm not exactly sure what the difference is between this unit and the more expensive units, other than the obvious price difference.

Pro's: The unit works great and does what it's supposed to do. It is currently serving as a switch for my HD Cable Box and my upconversion DVD Player and I haven't a problem with either. Very easy to install. For those who are interested, it is on the list of devices controllable by Harmony remotes and my 550 handles it with no problems.

Con's: Only one I've found so far is that you will need space for another wall wart plug in. But even that is small, compared to some other's I've  been stuck with.

Why pay the extra money? Get this one. I think you'll be very happy with it.",1167782400,16,771,4.333333333333333

1843126,4,B00008G6UM,"Santa Fe Trail, 1941 film

The film begins in 1854 at the West Point Military Academy. [The names of the cadets will be famous in the War Between the States.] There is political conflict between some cadets. Should the southern plutocrats continue to rule? The Commandant warns them against lying to benefit a friend, a danger even in peacetime. Rader is discharged for his abolitionist propaganda. Upon graduation some will be sent to Fort Leavenworth. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis tells them of the importance of defending the nation. Will Kansas join the nation as a free state? On the train some men try to abduct some passengers! The slavery conflict is the cause of ""Bleeding Kansas"".

Fort Leavenworth is the beginning of the trail to Santa Fe and its lucrative trade. The Army escorts wagon trains. The happy workers sing as they leave. John Brown organizes his supporters to abolish slavery. Will they attack a wagon train like robbers? Brown collects the boxes of ""bibles"" for his missionary work. There is a running chase with gunfire. The Army will search for John Brown's gang and attack them. A prisoner tells where the gang is located. A shipload of ""salt pork"" arrives in Palmyra. Rader provides military training to Brown's men for a price. Will Brown's gang attack another town? Will JEB Stuart scout the town of Palmyra, the terminal of the Underground Railroad? Will his horse tell on him? John Brown explains his strategy to abolish slavery through bloodshed.

Stuart escapes from Brown's gang while the barn catches fire. The Cavalry rides to the rescue. Brown and a few of his men escape. Are they finished? The Army officers are recalled to Washington. An Indian prophet predicts their future: they will become enemies in a war that has already begun. They laugh! John Brown has a new plan for a glorious end. He will attack the Arsenal at Harper's Ferry and use the arms to free the slaves. Will John Brown pay his debts to Rader? Historical figures are used in the story. Will somebody squeal? The last part of the film recreates John Brown's raid. [Did Brown have that many supporters?] Brown's promised support didn't show up, but US armed forces did. Guns neutralized the brick walls. The defenders are overwhelmed. JEB Stuart personally captures John Brown. Brown is tried and condemned for treason. Brown predicts a coming storm and the film ends.

Hollywood produces entertainment, not history. George Armstrong Custer is one of the most famous Americans, in the mid-1850s he was a school teacher in Ohio and didn't graduate from West Point until 1861.",1415664000,,2588,4.901826484018265

1843129,4,B00008G6UM,"This film is very good and I have seen it several times. The importent ting is to find a good and clear transfer of it. It is difficult to find, but this one is better than most. It is Blue-ray and because of that more sharp, the black is more black. These old films is best to use in ratio 4:3. There is not any subtitles as far as I can see, but I have another one that have. I have always been a fan of Errol and Olivia and hoping for more old films in blue-ray. This one is made in Germany and the names  on the cover is strange. It is an Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland film? Many says that the storyline in this film is wrong, but for me it is entertainment, be that as it may, I like it.",1402704000,,698,3.8137931034482757
1843130,5,B00008G6UM,"The real tragedy of this movie, mostly based on true incidents, is that the soldiers who are friends at the beginning this movie and through it become enemies during the Civil War.  There is a scene in the movie where an old Indian woman prophesies that the soldiers, Jeb Stuart (Errol Flynn), George Custer, (future President Ronald Regan), Phil Sheridan, James Longstreet, George Pickett, John Hood, will all become leader sin the military, but will fight against each other.  The Santa Fe trail has very little to do with this movie.  It should have been called The Fall of John Brown.  Raymond Massey is John Brown and portrays this man who fought against slavery, but was also a terrorist, very convincingly.  Errol Flynn is great as Jeb Stuart (He also plays George Custer in They Died with their Boots on) and is friendship with George Custer, Regan was a very good actor before he ran for President.  They are good friends and you believe they are good friends and care for each other. We as viewers know they will both end up Generals on opposite sides during the Civil War, this is the unspoken tragedy in the film.  The movie ends with the death of John Brown and the foreshadowing of what is to come, the Civil War.  The action and the story are very enjoyable, the actors preform fantastically.  This is a very good movie. There are some historical inaccuracies in the film, but over all it is a good movie.",1400803200,2,1420,4.603174603174603
1843151,3,B00008G6UM,"Misleading.  If you read the back of the cover it mentions that the movie is about the civil war, this is not true.  These stars were young and the acting was awful. Thank goodness they got a whole lot better as they got older.",1381276800,,227,4.136363636363637
1843152,3,B00008G6UM,"It's a great story starring Errol Flynn, Ronald Reagan, Olivia de Havilland, Raymond Massey, and Alan Hale. The subplot pitting Errol Flynn and Ronald Reagan competing for the affections of Olivia de Havilland is vintage Hollywood. However, even though it's a great movie, please be cautious that this movie is not historically accurate.  For example, Longstreet, JEB Stuart, George Armstrong Custer did not all graduate West Point together in the class of 1854. So if you are looking for history, please be aware that only the broad sweeping theme has any resemblance to reality.  The writers have taken quite a bit of creative license with history.  However, if you can get beyond this, it's a great movie. The scene with the old Indian woman, when she tells their fortunes, is priceless. It's directed by Michael Curtiz who did a number of Flynn-de Havilland movies (Sea Hawk, Captain Blood, Robin Hood). It's terrific vintage 1940 Hollywood.

The video quality is very poor, The Blu-ray is no better then the DVD.  It's about the same.  In fact, the DVD has an added feature with the biographies of Flynn, Reagan, and de Havilland. Somebody should fully restore this terrific film.  The blu-ray and DVD are both very grainny and overexposed. It's a shame. The sound is fine and it is in sync with the video.

I gave this blu-ray 3 stars because of the very poor video quality.  Otherwise, I would have rated this 5 stars.

PS: It is interesting to note that in the beginning of the movie, while they are in Kansas, Flynn & Reagan are using Remington Model 1861 Army Revolvers.  They did not exist yet.  Also, the rifles in the crates marked ""Bibles"" do not appear to be Sharps Model 1853 Carbines (Beecher's Bibles).  They should be.  Finally, in the scene where Lee and what should be his Marines, are retaking Harpers Ferry from John Brown, Flynn is using a Colt Single Action Army revolver (which was issued in 1873).  The John Brown incident at Harpers Ferry occurred in 1859.  The Colt SAA was not even invented yet. For both the Kansas and Harpers Ferry scenes, they shold be using the Colt Model 1851 Navy revolver or even the Colt Dragoon.

By the way, JEB Stuart (Flynn) was graduated from West Point in 1854. George Armstrong Custer (Reagan) was graduated in 1861 (a year early due to the outbreak of the Civil War). James Longstreet was graduated in 1842. Phil Sheridan was graduated in 1853. John Bell Hood was also graduated in 1853. In 1852, Lee was appointed Superintendent of West Point and served in that capacity for three years.",1370563200,2,2551,4.7482993197278915

1843156,4,B00008G6UM,"I was encouraged by another reviewer who gave the transfer his blessing and I want to concur. Its nowhere near the stunning work that Universal has done on its Monster collection nor some other transfers of its era on BR....but given that Warner Brothers let the project lapse from its control and what we've been dealing with for years has been very sub standard versions taken from Public Domain ....I was very pleased with the overall presentation and the sound is more robust than most BRs I have.

Now...lets place it in its proper context. This is such a gem of a movie in the classic Michael Curtiz/ Errol Flynn/ Olivia De Havilland series that to have it in even okay shape is a must for any film lover... to have it in at least very acceptable form a delight for me. Of course Van Heflin , Raymond Massey and the ever present Alan Hale Sr add greatly to the mix as does future President Ronald Reagan.

This isn't a cheap BR but if you are a fan of these actors as I am its well worth the 20 dollars... Of course I'd recommend these Errol Flynn sets first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Errol-Flynn-Signature-Collection-Vol-1-Captain-Blood-The-Private-Lives-of-Elizabeth-and-Essex-The-Sea-Hawk-They-Died-with-Their-Boots-On-Dodge-City-The-Adventures-of-Errol-Flynn/dp/B0007OY2PS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Errol Flynn Signature Collection, Vol. 1 (Captain Blood / The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex / The Sea Hawk / They Died with Their Boots On / Dodge City / The Adventures of Errol Flynn)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Errol-Flynn-Signature-Collection-Vol-2-The-Charge-of-the-Light-Brigade-Gentleman-Jim-The-Adventures-of-Don-Juan-The-Dawn-Patrol-Dive-Bomber/dp/B000M2E31I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Errol Flynn Signature Collection, Vol. 2 (The Charge of the Light Brigade / Gentleman Jim / The Adventures of Don Juan / The Dawn Patrol / Dive Bomber)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TCM-Spotlight-Errol-Flynn-Adventures-Desperate-Journey-Edge-of-Darkness-1943-Northern-Pursuit-Uncertain-Glory-Objective-Burma/dp/B00005JO4D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TCM Spotlight: Errol Flynn Adventures (Desperate Journey / Edge of Darkness 1943 / Northern Pursuit / Uncertain Glory / Objective Burma)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Errol-Flynn-Westerns-Collection-Montana-Rocky-Mountain-San-Antonio-Virginia-City/dp/B0018RU45U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Errol Flynn Westerns Collection (Montana / Rocky Mountain / San Antonio / Virginia City)</a>&nbsp;...if you collect all those then you will be greatly interested in this film.",1350000000,12,2720,7.470404984423676

It is in a Full frame mode, but when it's on a widescreen TV the bars are there and the have only two languages which are in English and German with no subtitles.

1843218,5,B00008G6UM,"Suddenly, I was all out of HDMI ports. OHNOES! How was my husband going to handle this? There was no way he was going to swap HDMI cables directly on the TV. Oh my fluffy nutters, he might have disappeared in the morass of cables, twist ties, surge protectors and dust bunnies, never to be seen again. The horror!

I found this product after searching the Internets for minutes! Minutes, I tell you! I found a review stating that it would indeed work with my shiny new PS3 (the cause of all this mess) as long as it was hooked to port 5. It has a remote, too - critical because if you get too close to the TV, you can hear the dust bunnies chanting softly, ""Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn"" and no one needs to hear that.

My magic box was delivered swiftly and I was pleasantly surprised at the small size of the device. It's about the size of an old non-wifi router (yeah, I know, I'm old). It has a nice weight to it, too, not like some of the cheap crap you get now days.

I had it hooked up and working in a matter of minutes. (It would have taken less time, but the dust bunnies had summoned a tiny demon who kept making me sneeze.) The PS3 does indeed work on port 5, as promised. The Xbox 360s happily work on any available port and I have no doubt that whatever infernal gaming console I purchase next will be proud to be plugged into the HM-501 5-PORT HDMI SWITCH w/ remote control, HDMI and power cable for HDMI input/output. There is no degradation to the picture or to the sound (this is important - loud noises drown out the drone of the dust bunnies).

(The switching is a little slow, but that's not a real issue since we aren't playing games on the fly. I'm a good multi-tasker, but not that good.)

Update - For some reason this review now looks like it's for the movie Santa Fe Trail. So, that happened. It was originally for a HM-501 5-PORT HDMI SWITCH w/ remote control, but it doesn't look like they sell that product any more. I'll leave this here just in case it comes back.",1265155200,4,2017,4.2558746736292425
1843219,4,B00008G6UM,"I bought this HDMI switcher to replace an old Pelican Component switcher.  Compared to the other HDMI switchers, this one is a great value.

PROS
1. Small. The box is only about 6""x""2.5""1"". Can easily be placed under your TV or entertainment center.
2. Automatic. While you can manually change the input, this box automatically switches to whichever input is activated. So most times you won't ever need the remote.
3. Price. Frankly, it's a lot cheaper than most switches out there. And with 5 inputs you get a lot of value for that price.

CONS
1. Documentation is pretty sparse. I read the Amazon reviews before buying and luckily saw other users comment that you can only use PS3 on port 5. It doesn't mention this in the manual anywhere. (FYI, PS3 works just fine on port 5).
2. The lights on the front are VERY bright. Too bright. I ended up covering them with about 5 layers of blue electrical tape to dim them. I can still see which port is active, but I'm not blinded anymore.

I was so excited to receive it.  Thankfully, I had no yet given away my Phillips brand, HDMI switch (which has only 3 ports, cost twice as much money, and did not come with a remote control).  I have been forced to continue using it.

Basically, this 5-port, HDMI Switch does NOT seem to be transmitting a clean signal.  About every 30 to 120 seconds, the signal to my Television gets interrupted with some type of a 'blackout' effect.  It lasts all of 5 to 10 seconds, then returns to normal.  This happens with any of my HDMI devices selected (Sony Blue Ray Player, Toshiba HDDVD Player, XBoX 360, and Comcast Cable DVR).  None of these devices (using the same exact HDMI Cables) do this using the Phillips HDMI Switch.  The only issue there is that i have to 'switch' out one of the cables in order to test all four (4) devices as the Phillips Switch only has 3 HDMI ports.

There does not seem to be any number for me to call for assistance in the documentation provided.  There does not seem to be any place for me to go to file a complaint in the documentation provided.  Basically, I'm stuck with something that doesn't work and right now is doing nothing more than collecting dust.

I though the problem could of been the cables, but when i plugged it directly into the dvd and ps3, it worked fine. Then I had bought this switcher which worked perfectly fine. The remote is better, not credit card style and has better ir signal. The component stand is on the side of the couch, away from a direct signal and I never had a problem. I have not noticed a glitch since I had bought this 3 weeks ago. Some say that the PS3 will only work in the 5th port, but I have it in the second and never had a problem. If you buy a switcher from a store, they can cost 150 for a switcher that only switches 2 hdmi cables. This does 5 for 50 bucks and works just as good, if not better.

The only cons I can say is that the button to switch on the front of the device does not stick out far enough, it's pushed in a little. Also, the first switcher switched between sources quickly without a pause.

The remote is chintzy and cheap but, c'mon, its 60 bucks and it works fine (at least they gave you a couple of cheapo batteries in the box).

The product is solid, the other products that I have seen looked plastic and only offered 3 HDMI inputs (which are right now all occupied).  At least I have 2 extra for any future purchases.

The only compliants that I have about this product (minor ones), is that it does not have a on/off power switch, it stays on eventhough your components are turned off and secondly, the description mentioned an HDMI cable, which did not come with this product (not a big deal for me because I already had an extra one).  Not sure if the price of this product reflects that, because if it does they need to make it clear to the consumer that this product will not be coming with an HDMI cable or change the pricing of this product to reflect minus the HDMI Cable.  Sometimes it does not automatically switch over to the new input (again no big deal for me, that's why you have the remote).  But that occurs more rarely then normally.

7982556,5,B00008G6UM,"Of all the films about the Civil War this prequel to that great tragedy has been lost to many viewers because the title used by the Warner Brothers was chosen to obscure the actual content of the film. The film timeline covers John Brown's anti-slavery Abolitionist activities from after his fighting in Kansas up to and including the attack on the United States Armory and Arsenal at Harpers Ferry, and his eventual execution by the federal government.

The film introduces many of the young military officers who would eventually become important leaders during the Civil War,  but the Santa Fe Trail itself has very little to do with the story except as a place where the interactions between the main characters begin. Ramond Massey should have received top billing for his remarkable portrayal of John Brown, but the action hero of the day Earl Flinn was chosen as the intended draw. The title was probably chose to entice the audiences of western movies and did include some very brief scenes  typical of cowboy western films,  but they do not detract from the story of John Brown and the Abolitionist movement's attempt to end slavery.",1514678400,,1142,4.871134020618556
