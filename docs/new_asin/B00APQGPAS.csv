5466092,5,B00APQGPAS,Classic Marine Corps OORah.  Wallace Beery is fun in this outsized tale of Marine Bravado.,1426377600,,90,5.0

5466094,2,B00APQGPAS,"I have seen the movie. This is a very rousing movie but one with a false premise. It salutes the Marines for their role in defending the Philippines. Marines did not defend the Philippines. The battle for the Philippines was the Battle of Bataan. The troops who fought the Battle of Bataan were Soldiers, not Marines. The main unit in the Philippines was the 4th Marine Regiment, which was transferred from Shanghai to the Philippines just prior to the outbreak of the War. The 4th Marine regiment remained on Corregidor during the Battle of Bataan. Excluding the tens of thousands of untrained Philippine conscripts, there were between 10,000 and 15,000 trained US troops on Bataan, only 105 of whom were Marines, and those Marines were in support units, not front line combat units.",1420243200,,784,4.902255639097745
5466095,5,B00APQGPAS,well done and it made you think about what went on wallace berry is a good actor and the end was a suprise,1418342400,,106,3.652173913043478
5466096,5,B00APQGPAS,"Great anti-Jap, anti-Nazi movie. As the Japs invade the Philippines, retired drill  sergeant Wallace Beery finally gets his chance in combat,  because he was too good of a DI, he was denied combat. Pacifists and appeasers  are pushed aside as he rallies the troops at a strategic bridge. It was almost mystical seeing a patriotic movie.",1418169600,,336,4.964285714285714
5466097,4,B00APQGPAS,"A very old but accurate movie.  Shows you what happens when the ""peaceniks"" refuse to see the dangers ahead.",1408752000,,108,4.684210526315789
5466098,5,B00APQGPAS,My uncles platoon was used in this movie. I never got to meet him but at least now I can see him,1378339200,4,96,3.409090909090909
5466099,4,B00APQGPAS,"I had my eye on this film for some time, and finally scored a copy. First off it stars Wallace Beery, playing Sgt Major William Bailey, a soon to retire Marine whos disgruntled that he's not seen actual combat despite his years in service. Set around 1941, we see Sgt Bailey training his men, offering advice and trying to get into a better situation, like that little party currently in China.

But no, he's denied and forced to retire after his years of service. but retires to the Philippines with his wife and daughter. There he tries to settle into retirement, but finds himself training the locals in village defense. Look for the young Robert Blake as one of the village kids. But no, the Japanese decided invade the Philippines (surely you recall that, it was in all the news!) Here Sgt Bailey finally gets his wish for combat and helps take on the invaders bravely.

I cannot give this film 5 stars due to serious errors, First, its 1941, and the troops are wearing later WW2 helmets, not the pattern 1927 Brodie style helmet in training and later in combat. Plus US troops are landing in force immediately  as the Japanese are invading, not really so..ask MacArthur about that! Lets not discuss the US made Renault style FT-17 tanks portraying Jap Type 95 tankettes. But hey, it was 1943 and Hollywood didn't have captured type 95s to use and CGI wasn't invented yet.

Plus, I could help myself listening to Beery speak, and not mentally MST3K Beery speaking ""Ole Long John Silver knows lad, and Long John is an honest man."" After his role with Jackie Cooper in Treasure Island.

But, its a fun film and worth owning.",1376092800,4,1627,4.615916955017301
5466100,5,B00APQGPAS,"Saw this movie when I was a kid. I looked it up on the internet about five years ago, but it was a sign-up when it became available. I looked it up last week on Amazon and sure enough they had it. It is an interesting movie, not very serious, but I only remember when the little kid brought Wallace Berry his 'dress blues Marine Jacket.' Fun to watch.",1368576000,2,351,4.101449275362318
5466101,5,B00APQGPAS,"I have been collecting WW2 movies for years. I had never seen or heard of this one till I saw it the other night and checked it out on Amazon. They had it and I bought it then and there. I have watched it 3 or 4 times already
and it is now part of my militaria WW2 dvd/VHS collection.",1356912000,8,284,3.75
