8207729,4,B000T4SX2Y,"This is a review of this entire series of four DVDs featuring Professor John Erickson.  First, these are not the typical ""War FileBattlefield"" documentaries that are so excellent.  The ""War FileBattlefield"" series was a set of two-hour in-depth documentaries typically treating major battles in considerable depth.  This series bears the ""War file"" logo but each episode is only an hour long, and it is a general overview, pretty much at the same level of analysis as the classic ""World at War"" series, but limited to the Eastern Front.  I cannot say that these are great, but they are good.  The interviews with Professor Erickson are some of the best parts, but the narration and footage are always decent.  If you like WWII documentaries in general, I think you will like this series.",1394496000,,787,4.924242424242424
8207730,3,B000T4SX2Y,"This documentary was made in 1998 (judging from the credits) not 2007 as indicated.
It covers operations Barbarossa I & II and Typhoon with some background on the doctrines of ""Lebensraum"" and ""Grossraum"" and the extermination policy.  It stops short of Moscow and does not cover the December 1941 Soviet counterattack.  It gives little detail on the diversion of 4th Army (Kluge) and 2nd Panzer Group (Guderian) from Army Group Center near Smolensk to the south for the completion of the massive Kiev encirclement (Barbarossa II).  The maps are a bit simplistic (compared to those of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battlefield-Russia-The-Eastern-Front-3-DVD-Set/dp/B003XQRZ56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battlefield Russia: The Eastern Front! 3 DVD Set!</a>) and not quite sufficient to follow the narration.

There are some serious errors in the narration and sometimes in the corresponding footage.
For example, the narration states that the Mark IV was the main stay of the Panzer forces in June 41 but the video shows a Mark III.  The narration goes on to specify the armor of the Panzer IV as 8 to 30 cm which is definitely wrong by an order of magnitude since it translates into 3 to 12 inches of armor versus an actual of 0.4 to 3.1 inches (with some variations depending on the ""Ausfuehrung"" or version, see for example&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Weapons-of-World-War-II-Infantry-Weapons-Unarmored-Vehicles-Armored-Vehicles-artillery-Specail-Weapons-Aircraft-Ships/dp/1405494891/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Weapons of World War II: Infantry Weapons - Unarmored Vehicles - Armored Vehicles -artillery - Specail - Weapons - Aircraft - Ships</a>).
Another blatant error is its designation of the Stuka dive bomber as the Ju 88: the two-men Stuka is the Ju 87, while the Ju 88, in its main A4 version, is a four men crew medium range bomber.
One further significant error is the narration ""in the Balkans...Novgorod, Leningrad"".  Those cities are in the Baltic in the north, not in the Balkans in the south (i.e. Greece, Yugoslavia).

All in all, this documentary is rather disappointing for somebody with prior knowledge of the Russian front as it offers only the most basic information and with errors at that.  I would not have rated it higher than 2 stars except for the interview with Professor Erickson (author of the reference&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road-to-Stalingrad-Cassell-Military-Paperbacks/dp/0304365416/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road to Stalingrad (Cassell Military Paperbacks)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road-to-Berlin-Stalin-s-War-with-Germany-Volume-II-Cassell-Military-Paperbacks/dp/0304365408/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road to Berlin (Stalin's War with Germany Volume II) (Cassell Military Paperbacks)</a>), one of the triad of Eastern Front experts with Ziemke and Glantz.",1328054400,5,3019,6.703324808184143
8207731,5,B000T4SX2Y,This is an excellent DVD in a series. I found the material to be interesting and informative. The original film clips have a good speaking voice behind it and the interviews with Ericsson are excellent. I recomment this to any interested in WWII ib the Eastern Front which most of us know little about.,1256688000,9,302,4.611111111111111
8207732,5,B000T4SX2Y,"Overall an excellent presentation.  The subtitle mirrors a book of the same title written by Paul Carell.  Excellent maps and commentary but again some of the film is repeated.  Another excellent source to learn more about this theater, which was not opened to the West until the last 10-15 years.  I have read some of Dr. Erickson's books which are well written providing good information and explanations.",1221350400,13,407,5.029850746268656
