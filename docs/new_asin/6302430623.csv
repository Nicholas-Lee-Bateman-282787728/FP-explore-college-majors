8202417,4,6302430623,I didn't realize how good was this concert. I hardly recoment this VHS tape for a real Moz fan.,1244246400,,95,4.052631578947368
8202418,5,6302430623,"I think this is the best concert footage available. The other Morrissey shows are good but to glossy, this is a lot more raw and sounds better.",1212364800,,143,4.333333333333333
8202419,5,6302430623,"This concert, shot on venue location's camera's, is as best bootleg quality.  Never the less, as Morrissey stated ""its more of a souvenir"" to his fans, get this video!!  This was Morrissey's rockabilly era, with some songs off of Kill Uncle given the uptempo treatment eg. ""There's a place in hell for me and my friends"".  This is a must have for you have a bequiffed Morrissey in all its glory and excellent covers of ""Trash"" by the New York Dolls and ""That's Entertainment"" by The Jam and Doll's ""Trash"" is the only live recording available. Strongly advise in getting a copy of this.",1150934400,,586,4.615384615384615
8202420,4,6302430623,This is definately a great movie and it's extremely hard to get by. The concert is taken from Moz's 91' Kill Uncle Tour. The performances are great and the camera shot is awesome. I hated the ending because the crowd trambles on to the stage which doesn't allow Moz to finish his song.,1071705600,2,285,4.39622641509434
