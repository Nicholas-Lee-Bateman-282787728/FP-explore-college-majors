7816939,4,6301925866,"This 1987 four-hour documentary was produced for Dutch television and provides a unique perspective on Nazi Germany, choosing to focus on the Bavarian mountaintop retreat to show the leaders of the Third Reich at play.  There is a fascinating irony to watching home movies of the Nazis at play, never forgetting for a moment the film we have seen all our lives of the concentration camps and world at war.  ""Eagle's Nest"" also incorporates interviews with survivors of that time and place, but neither distancing device totally detaches us from the horrors of what was happening.  Seeing the Nazis at their best, only adds another layer to their evil.  The strength of this documentary is that it shows how the evil extended well beyond Hitler (who really did not like to be at this mountain retreat).  There are four volumes in this series, each one approximately an hour long.  Volume 2, ""Europe Falls Before the Reich,"" traces the ascendancy of Nazi Germany in the early part of World War II.",994204800,4,995,4.823529411764706
