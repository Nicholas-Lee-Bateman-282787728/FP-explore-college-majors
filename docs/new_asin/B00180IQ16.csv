8268066,5,B00180IQ16,"if you are a buckeye fan, get this.  Woody hayes is the greatest Buckeye coach in history, and one of the greatest of all time.

He is misunderstood, and often only remembered for his outbursts.  I knew many buckeye players, and they all loved Woody.  Yes, he could lose his mind on the field, but it was passion for the game.

I enjoyed this very much.  I never got to meet Woody, but I knew a dozen guys who he recruited.  It is 100% true that he never talked about football when recruiting - he only talked about education.  He really really believed that - it was not hype.

Buckeye fan? buy this video.  Love football?  Buy this video.",1477612800,,640,4.294117647058823

8268071,5,B00180IQ16,"Wayne Woodrow Hayes was the epitome of an old school ball coach. He coached his kids hard, but was loyal to them til the end. As a college football fanatic, I found this DVD to be very informative. Woody was without question one of the best college football coaches in the history of the game. This video is a must for anyone who loves the game of college footbal and appreciates its rich history.
