3010488,1,B000Y0BJF6,This is the most boing dvd I have ever watched. I think more time was spent on the introduction than the actual dance time. The 30 seconds of music used in this dvd was so low you couldn't hear it and very boring also. I would not recommend this dvd to anyone and I feel it is the biggest waste of money I have ever spent. I was very excited to get started now I am just very disappointed.,1210809600,3,389,3.9367088607594938

8230535,4,B000Y0BJF6,Great instruction to the basics of stepping.  A Chicagoan would appreciate the history and attention to detail.,1418256000,,111,5.529411764705882
8230536,3,B000Y0BJF6,"As a beginning stepper, I wanted to see a more in depth description of the various dance steps. The video does a very good job of explaining the first basic steppin pattern that all beginners must learn. However, the subsequent dance steps presented after the basic pattern, are not explained in as much detail. For example the video goes on to show 15 consecutive patterns danced at normal speed. Watching this many uninterrupted patterns was beautiful to see but was impossible for me to learn anything at that speed. Afterwards, the same 15 dance patterns were presented in slow motion which was a little better to understand what was happening with the footwork, but that was as descriptive as it got. I would have preferred that the slow motion portion of the dance patterns incorporate a step-by-step explanations as was done when the beginning basic step was presented at the beginning of the video. That would have been cool, but instead I spent a lot of time rewinding and reviewing the same pattern numerous times to see how I could duplicate what I just saw, and eventually became too frustrated to continue. I concluded that this video, while it shows good dance moves, is not appropriate or recommended for the beginning stepper.",1416009600,5,1242,4.863207547169812

8230540,1,B000Y0BJF6,This was the worse tape ever.  The sound quality was bad and poor.  How can you learn to dance when there is no sound?  Not worth $1.00,1347235200,4,135,3.925925925925926
