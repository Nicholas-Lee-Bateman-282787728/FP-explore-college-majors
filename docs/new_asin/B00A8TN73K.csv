5401120,3,B00A8TN73K,"The Full Moon DVD authoring group have re-re-released this 'infamous' Italian 'naziploitation' flik as part of their emerging ""Grindhouse Collection' of marginal movies. As other reviewers have noted - this trashy bit of exploitation began its' life under the Euro-title ""The Beast In Heat"" and gained more notoriety than it likely deserved by virtue of being one of the earliest of the films 'banned' in Britain by its' Board of Censors. Perhaps because of this early 'bad reputation' many cult cinema fanatics (such as myself) have, of course!, sought it out to see just what was SO horrific about it?! The sad truth is that, particularly by modern standards, the answer is: 'not much' - except possibly the acting & production values. That said - personally, I actually didn't find the film to be as 'bad' as many other reviewers seemed to... tho I CAN see why fans of the sick & twisted cinema might feel a tad 'let-down' by this one.

When I was growing up back in the 60's - the magazine racks always had a bunch of 'Mens True Adventure' style mags that featured lurid cover art of various WWII 'war horror' type stories - most of which involved a semi-nekkid girl being terrorized in some fashion by the 'bad-guys'. Generally these stories were based around a plot that involved the 'good-guys' battling the bad guys and somewhere along the way there were some spicy scenes of torturous abuse of women to act as a story device to justify the vindictive retribution that usually formed the climax of the tale. ""SS Hell Camp"" is just like one of these magazine stories - 'brought to life' - on the screen. Thus it isn't really surprising that much of the plot is devoted to following the actions of the 'resistance fighters' as they confront the evil Nazi menace that is threatening their town. Maybe, back in the day, the scenes of the 'military' action would have been 'engaging' - but - now-a-days itz more the 'horror porn' factor that attracts. SO - what are the pros & cons of this seminal example of SS inspired nasti-ness?

On the (s)exploitational PLUS side: 'SS Hell Camp' has full female (and male) nudity during the (relatively few) scenes involving either 'sex' &/or 'torments'. There is essentially one fairly lengthy scene in the 'interrogation room'  wherein both men & women are made to endure such 'stock' torments as: finger nail pulling, electric shocks to the privates, & whipping - as well as the more unusual: ravaging by the titular GMO 'beast' man/creature, AND the famously cheesy scene of guinea pigs 'standing-in' for rats as they ostensibly are 'clawing their way through' a victim's abdomen. Pretty horrific stuff!  Also a general 'plus' is the visual quality of the Full Moon DVD transfer - it provides a nice clean/sharp widescreen picture.

On the less positive front: very little excitement is generated by any of the events pictured - not much empathy for any of the characters portrayed - laughable dubbing, and minimal productions values ALL work together to provide a remarkably 'flat' exploitation viewing experience... which IS sort of the antithesis of 'why' anyone watches these things in the first place. To top it all off - there's not even actually a concentration 'camp' in the film!

SO - all in all - a relatively lack-lustre showing - one's time might be better spent re-watching similar fare such as the classic:  ""Ilsa - She Wolf of the SS"" or ""Love Camp 7""- flix that more deliver what one looks for in this particular genre - BUT, for archival and/or complete-ist purposes, naziploitation fans may (still) wish to 'check in' to the SS Hell Camp for a brief visit - especially if the 'price is right'.",1402876800,7,3658,4.796825396825397
5401121,2,B00A8TN73K,"Let's make one thing explicitly clear. The subgenre ""Nazisploitation"" has no redeeming social value and no cerebral weight. Given that one simple idea, one would think its easy to make a movie that has three major hallmarks to succeed.
1) Semi-nude dominatrix figure in the lead; coupled with easily pantless victims
2) Gratuitous gore
3) Swastikas

This movie meets these requirements; yet commits the ultimate Cinematic Sin....IT'S BORING!
This movie is unbelievably boring. This is coming from a fan of exploitation cinema! For God's sake there's a monster in a cage (which I'm fairly certain is the town drunk looking for his Italian Oscar) and yes this movie is obviously a Spaghetti-trash flick cleverly disguised with cast names like phonetically-pleasing Jon Brawn among others. This movie makes torture and boobs boring!
The sole reason I give it two stars is due to Full Moon Entertainment's exceptionally polished DVD release. It's such a shame they can't obtain the rights to superior exploitation films rather than this swill....because you can obviously tell they're optimists because they stand by their products with great DVD box arts as well as bonus features.

I kid you not anybody who reads this - don't buy it unless you're an avid loyalist to the genre. I've watched this movie literally once and now do you know what it serves me? I use the DVD box to cover the light from my Blu-Ray player so I can go to sleep.",1395964800,13,1436,4.929752066115703

5401129,2,B00A8TN73K,"This is another film restored by Full Moon and part of their grindhouse series. The opening visual restoration looked good, but the audio sounded like it was under water. The audio improves as the visuals grow worse. During the closing days of WWII, a local facility (not really a camp) is experimenting to make a master race. Unfortunately all they managed to create was one lone ape-man, or rape-man. This part of the plot needed some help. Local villagers are rounded up and abused because there was no camp.

Most of the film was boring war scenes, interrupted by rape and torture porn. And by torture porn there was a scene that could have come from ""Blood Sucking Freaks.""  I would recommend Ilsa films instead, i.e. ones that haven't been edited to eliminate nudity below the waist. Good luck finding them. There is also ""Stalag 69"" an adult film starring Angelique Pettyjohn (One of Kirk's Star Trek women) which you will have trouble finding.

Guide: Sex, rape, FF nudity male and female. Also titled ""Horrifying Experiments of S.S. Last Days"" and ""The Beast in Heat.""",1441584000,8,1077,4.8108108108108105

What's to gain from it now? The market was saturated mostly by Media Blasters. Give it a rest. Come up with something that HAS NOT been released yet.
I've had these Nazisploitation films on VHS from Holland where they were all released UNCUT and IN ENGLISH and at a time in the 1990's when none of you releasing companies gave a crap about them.",1484438400,,503,4.6

8548485,1,B00A8TN73K,Full Moon messed up big time and put Deported Women of the SS Special Section in the case rather than SS Hellcamp. And if you want Deported Women... I suggest buying it from Intervision. Order at your own risk.,1476748800,4,210,4.410256410256411

8548488,1,B00A8TN73K,"I was expecting a T&A soft core show case. What is here is 1/3 historical documentary of how Non Jew Female Camps were run. The Hair removal scene and the health check up scene is identical to old historical films from the late 1930s.  After that, the rest was basically worthless crap.

There was suggested plots that were never followed up. Suggested that girls would be abused by throngs of Nazi soldiers that never appeared. The one sex scene was at the end with a prisoner murdering herself and the camp commander.  Just awful story line and never followed up on its own suggested build ups.",1467417600,7,596,4.60377358490566
