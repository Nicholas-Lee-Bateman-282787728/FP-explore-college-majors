8452975,1,B0051ONUUC,Lame video by a bunch of desperate college kids.  Not worth giving away cuz if you did your friend pool would quickly diminish!,1334534400,2,127,4.521739130434782
8452976,4,B0051ONUUC,I was surprised with this movie.  the acting was actually pretty good and the two villains / victims were believable.  Opening was a little slow but I understand why.  Also there was a death scene that was very questionable and had me actually laugh out loud during the movie.  I do recommend to go ahead and see this.  I do believe the Director of this movie put his full effort into making this movie.  I give him a lot of credit.,1312243200,2,432,4.271604938271605
8452977,1,B0051ONUUC,"This movie was so pathetic,badly produced, crappy actors and actress. A huge waste of money I do not recommend this movie to anyone this is not scary or gory what so ever a complete rip off.  All those postive reviews must of been from the actors themselves because i have no idea why anyone would say anything good about this movie. I am totally kicking myself in the ass right now. I was excited for this movie to come and when I finally got the chance to see it....it was by far the worst frickin horror movie i have ever SEEN and i have seen alot of crap horror movies....DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE YOU WILL BE DISAPOINTED AND RIPPED OFF!!!!!",1312243200,17,641,4.297520661157025

8452979,4,B0051ONUUC,Great video quality and some actual acting talent.  Much better than a lot of horror movies I've seen.  I recommend it to anyone who likes brutal revenge flicks.  No for the squeamish.,1283904000,10,184,4.6875
8452980,4,B0051ONUUC,"This was a odd kind of suspense, kinda of sci-fi kind of movie
