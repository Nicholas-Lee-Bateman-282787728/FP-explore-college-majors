1805722,4,B00007CVSH,"Admittedly Verdi's ""Il Trovatore"" is difficult to stage effectively. These dificulties result from the opera's somewhat insane plot coupled with the stature of the artists able to effectively cope with the score. Elijah Moshinsky' has overcome these difficluties with great success.  He's moved the story from 15th C. Spain to 1865 Italy whereby the political conflict becomes Imperial Austria vs. Garibaldi's revolutionary forces.( This is a nice choice considering Verdi's nationalist proclivities.) This device works well as a backdrop to the interactions of the opera's four main characters. The sets and costumes by fim designer Dante Ferretti and Anne Tilby respectively create a film-like atmosphere worthy of Zeferelli.
The choruses are marvelously integrated into the action, be they gypsies or Schlager dueling Austrian soldiers, and intensify the developing friction that fuels the opera. The principal singers are strong and well suited for their roles. Dimitri Hvorostovsky's Count  di Luna is an elegant controlled antithesis to Jose Cura's ""macho"" rogue Manrico. Yvonne Naef is downright scarey as Azucena. Both her voice and acting capture the gypsy's tortured obsessiveness. Unfortunately the lovely Veronica Villarroel's light lyric soprano is hard pressed to cope with Leonora's role, which definitely requires the power of a spinto soprano. Although her acting is heartfelt and powerful enough to make this Leonora believable, Verdi's score is too heavy for her instrument. Nonetheless, this ""Il Trovatore"" ensnares us in the passion and grandeur that is opera.",1058140800,8,1581,5.666666666666667
1805723,4,B00007CVSH,"This performance was filmed on May 3, 2002 at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. It was Mr. Hvorostovsky's first outing as Count di Luna. What a Count di Luna he was. His singing of di Luna made the usual baritone villain come alive with such passion.(Hint: the best sung cabaletta of the night was not ""Di quella pira"", but ""Per me ora fatale"". Masculinity personified.) Nowadays nobody can convey complicated emotions through singing more eloquently than Mr. Hvorostovsky. It was so evident in this performance. Just for this reason alone, this dvd is a must. But the dvd has much more to offer. There was a very well sung but rather restrained Azucena by Yvonne Naef. Her voice was strong and beautiful. Ms. Villarroel got points for her efforts. As for Mr. Cura, his vision for Manrico was ""Latino macho man"". Well, Mr. Cura succeeded just as that. He forgot that Manrico was also a poet. Even after countless viewings of the dvd, I still cannot control the urge to shake Leonora to her senses. Maestro Rizzi's tempi were on the fast side, so it made the opera sound more like a fast paced action ""movie"". Overall, the opera was very exciting to watch. (Expect some little surprises in the production.) I showed it to people who did not watch operas and the responses were very positive. The quality of the dvd is excellent. Both the sound and pictures are very clear. Of course, it comes with the extra features. Bravo to BBC-Opus Arte for an excellent job bringing this dvd to us. I hope someday someone will produce a dvd of ""Eugene Onegin"" with Mr. Hvorotovsky as the cad. Please do this soon before Mr. Hvorostovsky moves on to all those juicy Verdi roles.",1050883200,30,1668,4.638513513513513
1805724,4,B00007CVSH,"I bought this just to give Jose Cura a chance as Manrico. I am afraid he disappointed me. He was too much as a brute, in addition to the wobbly singing. Dmitri Hvorostovsky's Count on the other hand is wonderful from start to finish. His acting as well as his singing is exemplary. The only thing that was intrusive was the sword fighting with Cura. It intruded much too much on the singing.
Veronica Villaroel's Leonora too was very good. Her acting and singing were blended very nicely. Yvonne Naef's Azucena was also good, but I thought she lacked the bite of Simionato's or Cossotto's interpretation of the vengeful gypsy.
I would have to say that Dmitri Hvorostovsky was the star here. This seemed for me to be a Trovatore without the Trovatore. Cura's wobbly voice was too much of a instrution for me enjoy the opera fully. The fact that he acted and sang like a brute and not like a passionate poet, as I see Manrico, may be the fault of the director of the production. The production was OK, but I'd would much prefer a traditional setting for this opera. But on the other hand the sets and costumes were consistant and better than other production of opera nowadays.
Carlo Rizzi's conducting was crisp and exciting. Overall is this performance good, if you can accept Manrico to be a wobbly brute. The picture on this DVD is very good with it's 16:9 image. The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound too is good, but it would be even better if the producers of the DVD would do the same as DG and added a DTS track. But it is very good nonetheless.",1050019200,11,1542,4.4522968197879855
1805725,1,B00007CVSH,"First of all,don't waste your time and money on this one. Villarroel was aweful( no wonder the Met cancelled her run of Trovatore this season ),she always fell short of the high note and had such poor breath control. Cura and Hvorostovsky were totally miscast,neither of them could tackle the coloratura demands of the beautifully written opera. ( Though I am usually a fan of Hvorostovsky ).The only principal that could sing decently was Naef, though she was not believable for her role.
The best Il Trovatore DVD available is the one with Gencer,Barbieri, Del Monaco etc. ( However it's a dubbed version and sometimes can be annoying ).The second best is the one with Sutherland in the Australian production. Dame Joan was near the end of her career but still shines with her sound Bel Canto tecnique. The rest of the cast sing decently and is overall pleasant to watch. The Met production with Pavarotti and Marton is worth watching because of Pavarotti. Eva Marton was a great singer but was totally miscast in this role. The Met should have taped a year before with Pavarotti and Sutherland in 1988.( her operatic farewell to the Met )That would probably be the best possible cast. That production was boring though.",1045785600,10,1222,4.8238095238095235
1805726,4,B00007CVSH,"Il Trovatore is my favorite opera. To me, when Verdi composed Il Trovatore, he put the final touches on Bel Canto Operas; he splendidly used every Bel Canto ""trick of the trade"" putting his masterful ""Verdian Stamp""on all. Since there was nothing left to be developed or written in the aforesaid style of opera, the way was paved for the further development of the Verismo-school of opera, and, utimately, for the Wagnerian epic leit-motive driven style of writing opera. Il Trovatore has everything, to me, that an opera should have--beautiful arias, ferocious cabalettas, thrilling, sing your lungs out, ensembles, loud-thundering-call-to-battle choruses, humable melodies, an improbable story, a love-struck-willing-to-die-for-her-man-soprano role, a brave-swashbuckling-lovable-not-too-smart-tenor role, a sexy-militaristic-kind-of-dangerous-love-starved-baritone role, and MOST OF ALL, a crazed-scene-chewing-I'm-really-really-your mama-so DO kill-the-baritone-for-me, mezzo-soprano role.
Now days it is very difficult to vocally cast this opera. This new DVD has certainly assembled four singers that are up to their respective tasks; it is marvelous to hear and to watch. The singing is good and the action is believable--each singer looking and acting his/her part to the hilt (unlike the Met's video with Pavarotti sounding good but unable to move from one spot to the other). It's nice to hear the role of Manrico sung by a dramatic tenor again. I have great recordings with lyric Manrico(s) (i.e., Carreras, di Stefano, Algana) and I enjoy them; however, it's great to hear the full-throttled sound that Jose Cura can produce as Manrico. I know that there are opera critics that will, no doubt, rip his performnance apart comparing him to one of more dead tenors and perhaps to a few living ones. (The same thing that was done, in their day, to the recordings/ performances of Del Monaco and Correlli who sang full throttled virile Manrico(s). I don't care what the critics have to say; Jose Cura sings Manrico excitingly with gusto, tastefullness and also with plenty of tenderness, and at the same time, making Manrico as believable of a character, physically, as possible--he does not simply stand and deliver (as many a tenor has done as Manrico; just being glad to be able to get through it alive) but he does act and move about while singing some of the most beautiful music ever written for the tenor voice and singing it very well. (Be advised, he is not a tenor that holds on to the high notes for as long as possible popping blood vessels and running out of breath with arms out-stretched waiting for the audience to start applauding, but he sings them very musicially making them, as I feel they should be, a part of the muscial line not the main event).
I have always felt that Dmitri Hvorostovsky was born to sing Count di Luna with his beautiful, smooth, as butter, baritone voice. He brings everything that should be brought to the role--beautiful tone (throughout all registers) accurate singing, power and flexibility. Bravo!
Naef takes-on the mezzo role of the crazed Azucena, and, to me, she is up there with some of the great performers of the part--Bumbry, Cossoto, Simonato, Varrett and Zajick (Zajick being the best thing on the Met Video.)
In my ""dream-cast"" DVD of this opera, the role of Leonora would be taken by a soprano that has some of the qualities that Leontyne Price had (Aprile Millo comes to mind) Since, alas, the likes of Leontyne Price will never be seen again (thankfully Leontyne happened in my lifetime) Vilarroel, as Leonora is certainly an adequaate compromise--no trills (neither did Tabaldi) or floating of the tones or well-supported ravishing pianissimos; neverthless, very committed and enough voice to do Verdi's music justice! She is far superior to Eva Marton's ""Brunnhilde Version""--what the hell am I doing in Il Trovatore--ain't this Gotterdammerung?--of Leonora in the Met's video.
The production is enjoyable, watchable and believable being neither a stodgy traditional production nor one of those extreme avant-garde productions set in the year 2090 where every movement and object has a completely unintelligible hidden meaning.
If you love Verdi (as I do) buy this DVD for a full throttled performance of Il Trovatore. (The DVD has some very nice added features too!)",1045785600,10,4338,5.243165467625899
1805727,3,B00007CVSH,"Curious trend this, whereby italian operas in major centres are now commonly  cast without a single italian singer, at least in the main roles. Whether that obeys to an acute scarcity of competent, world-class Italian singers remains to be seen, maybe globalisation arrived to the arts with its full impact. Any way, this release is typical of its source, very well produced and with interesting and pertinent supplementary material, a feature other publishers ought to imitate.
The end result is uneven, though, in spite of the stunning Moshinsky production for The Royal Opera, a significant improvement over his previous Australian effort which has been variously broadcast over world television and seen in many countries. The main problem lies with Cura's Manrico, caught here in a problematic evening none the less the loud cheering and applause at the end courtain calls; visually he certainly looks the part. I can't say whether he's going through recurrent vocal problems or if this was an isolated incident, but what we have here is a very wobbly vocal production that to me marred an otherwise wonderful night at the opera (London, 3rd May 2002), where with  ""tricks of the trade"" Cura tried, sometimes more successfully than others, to conceal the fact that his vocal instrument was in substandard condition; alarm lights up for the listener from the very ""Deserto sulla terra"" moment. Top honours are shared by Hvorostovsky and Naef, in their respective roles of the Count and Azucena. The siberian's is one of the most effective impersonations of the Count I've ever seen, acted with utter conviction and bravado, sung with impeccable and effectively nuanced vocal production, velvety when it calls for, full voiced when pertinent; no wonder then that ""Il balen del tuo sorriso"" brings the house down -I'd add that young italian baritones aspiring to tackle the rle ought well study this portrayal-. Nor less can we say about the Azucena, the part chosen by Naef to show her proficiency at the ROH for the first time. Looking perhaps youngish for the part, especially in her scenes when she shares the stage with Cura, her powerful mezzo voice soars majestically over the Covent Garden stage, bringing memories of earlier, italian famous exponents of the part. Villarroel's voice is perhaps not strong enough for Leonora but she in the end acquits herself quite successfully, not a great Leonora but satisfactory all round none the less; her pianissimi are exquisite. The Ferrando equals Cura in wobbliness, the Ins seems cool and detached. The chorus and orchestra are in top form, Rizzi's tempi in the fast side, sometimes unnecessarily so, or maybe uncalled for (I went back to Carlo Maria Giulini's essay on the subject of this work's suggested tempi, originally marked by Verdi himself on his score, which the illustrious Italian conductor studied closely whilst preparing his excellent audio-only recording made in Rome some 20 years ago for DG; the essay is published in the booklet that accompanies it and is recommended reading for those who own the album).
In sum: peaks and valleys, but an all-round satisfactory experience, well directed for television by Brian Large and very well recorded, sound-wise, like most BBC Opus Arte releases I've come across. If you happen to live in a city which is a major opera centre, you may well experience the work live and in a similarly good -or even better- performance sometime or the other, with even perhaps at least some of these same singers and thereby doing without this album perfectly well. But if, like most of us, you don't, you won't go wrong by ordering this DVD, which for a fraction of the price of a decent seat at the Metropolitan Opera or the Chicago Lyric Opera -and certainly at Covent Garden, where the performance was recorded and good tickets go over the 100 barrier-, renders all round satisfaction, with the caveats referred to above.",1044489600,5,3924,5.016871165644171
1805728,5,B00007CVSH,"This was really great.  This OPERA is GREAT.  Cura and Hovorostovsky nailed it.  I cannot say enough about this Video/OPERA.  Done well, costumes were authentic enough and believable.  Great addition to my collections of OPERA",1415491200,,226,5.3428571428571425

1805730,5,B00007CVSH,"I love this version of Trovatore, its a very good production. I've seen the 2011 production of the Metropolitan Opera, and it doesn't quite add up to this.

Jose Cura is a great Manrico, his acting is great, it isn't too overdramatic (like the 2011 version) and his voice is loud and dramatic in all the right places.

Yvonne Naef is a fantastic Azucena, my favorite character in this opera, her ""Stride la Vampa"" gives me chills, she delivers this song amazingly (Azucena's 2011 counterpart, Dolora Zajick is just as good in this role, despite being older, she is stunning as well) her tragic story in ""Condotta ell'era in Ceppi"" is also amazing, Yvonne has these eyes that grow wide with fright when she tells of her visions, and she collapses in sorrow after realizing her son was in the flames, all of this to a booming orchestra.... chills...

Dmitri Hvorostovsky (who played the same character in 2011, and was amazing) is amazing here as well, his hatred for Manrico before the finale is amazing. He is quite the intimidating man, with a booming voice to match. His ""Qual Suono"" is amazing, his confession of love for Leonora is well sung, and acted as well, my favorite Di Luna (so far...)

Veronica Villarroel is the noblewoman Leonora, and this woman is not only a great singer, but a great actor which is good for this role, especially during the posion scene. All of her songs are amazing, and at the right moments, very touching, her ""Miserere"" was exactly that. Underneath the purplish/blue light of the moon she performed this. Her death was played well, she was perspiring, panting, and looked the part a woman dying in agony.  She sang and did all of this at the same time, which is rare for this role (at the Met, the actress just slinked to the ground and lied there singing, good singing mind you, but not this) and when the big moment came of her death it was heartbreaking.

I've never seen this finale pulled off so well, with a such a triumphant Azucena as Yvonne (and Dolora in 2011). She had the smile that just spoke of heartbreak but great triumph.

All in all I recomend this DVD to those who love Trovatore :D",1405468800,2,2139,4.569190600522194
1805731,5,B00007CVSH,"This is a traditionally costumed and period-appropriate Trovatore. Domingo (as Manrico), Kabaivanska (as Leonora), Cossotto (as Azucena), as well as Cappuccilli (as Count di Luna), are in excellent voice, without a strain or off-note to be heard. Von Karajan knows this opera and how to make the music work.

 This performances only shortcoming, if that word is even appropriate, is the video technology of the late 70s and early 80s, when it was recorded. The color is just a bit faded, in places and, in some of the darker secenes, some graininess is noticeable, when played on todays high-end equipment. Despite that, the audio is excellent, which is more important than crisp, clean video, in opera",1399248000,,702,5.043103448275862
1805732,5,B00007CVSH,"Domingo was not yet 40 in 1978 when this performance took place; his recorded ""Trovatore"" with Mehta (arguably still the best on CD) was almost ten years in the past.  One feels here that his voice has grown into the role -- I can't imagine it being better sung, both musically and expressively.  That's not to say that I can't imagine another great voice (say Corelli at his best) making an even more striking impression, but by any standard this is great singing, and within the limits of the production, fine acting.  The limits of the production are not really terribly disabling -- it's a bit static, and some of the stage business is awkward (the scene at the convent was particularly sticky, I thought), but the sets are nicely rendered in a painterly way, and if the singing were not as strong as it is, the static quality of the production would bother me more.  And the quality of the singing is excellent, not just from Domingo.  Kabaivanska's Leonora is not as rich and voluptuous as Price's but it is secure from top to bottom, well-focussed, and expressive.  It doesn't hurt that she looks good in the role.  Di Luna is not a role I associated with Cappuccilli, but he provides a great account of it here.  One can remember Bastianini's black baritone, but (as with Domingo vis-a-vis Corelli) one can't fault Cappuccilli's singing or expression.  Some reviewers complain that the pacing by Karajan is too slow;  the only place where it registered on me as slow was in ""Il balen,"" and the tempo proved no problem for Cappuccilli with his wonderful breath control, and he gave a lovely account of it.  Jose Van Dam was a superb Ferrando -- again not a dark voice, but beautifully projected.  Most of all, Fiorenza Cossotto was an unforgettable Azucena -- thinking of her performance, one can see why Verdi considered naming the opera for the gypsy.  The singing is stunning and intense, and the physically static quality of so much of the production does not in the least impair her communicative power.  This is a gypsy who can scare the hell out of you.  All in all, then, this is just wonderful.  I don't have any other Trovatores on DVD for comparison (yet), but I can't believe that I will ever think badly of this one.",1390780800,11,2236,4.622784810126582
1805733,1,B00007CVSH,"This is another re-release of an older recording (2003?). When I reviewed that version, I commented at length on horrible staging, an awful tenor, a barely adequate soprano and a splendid baritone. Plus there are substantial cuts to the score. I have not changed my mind.

Jose Cura is a good actor here, but his vocal technique is painful to experience: glottal attacks and forced head tones as low as E natural make for unpleasant listening.

I have heard Mme Villaroel when the music she was singing was in sync with the voice. Leonora is not a good vehicle for her. See her in Verdi's Jerusalem on TDK for a fine performance.

I cannot say enough bad things about the staging, so I won't, other than to reiterate that it is another horrible example of ""Eurotrash"", whch, based on some recent Met performances, has made it ""over the water, sad to say.

1805743,1,B00007CVSH,"STOP!  Thank goodness I caught you before you clicked on ""Proceed to Checkout.""  It pains me to give this such a bad review as I love opera on Blu-ray and would like to do everything I can to encourage their sales; but there is simply no reason to preserve such a dismal performance.

I think it was Caruso that said all this opera requires is the five best singers in the world.  Only Hvorostovsky comes close.  Though still somewhat light in timbre he seems to have developed into a true Verdian baritone.  Azucena is passable.  This is my first exposure to the Manrico, Jose Cura. He essentially has a baritonal timbre with no ""squillo"" in his high notes.  To me he lacked the finesse and the vocal splendor needed.  Villoreal as Leonora lacked the richness in tone and fluidity of line the part requires.  The conducting was slow and robbed the music of its drama.

In terms of staging, the concepts ranged from bizzare (the Count's soldiers doing a silly dance with swords while wearing aviator glasses) to offensive (the Count's soldiers raping Azucena).  The stage director seemed to want an intimate affair in which the principals get six inches from each other's face and whisper to each other.  Come on, guys--there's nothing subtle about Trovatore.  You want some great voices to plant their feet and give us some ""can belto"" singing.  This just doesn't deliver.  And someone needs to take Manrico out and give him a good scrubbing--would a lady like Leonora fall for a guy who is perpetually caked with mud?  The video was dark and the sound quality muffled.

I am not familiar with other DVD's of this opera to offer an alternative.  However, I will recommend three wonderful audio CD sets:
Bjoerling, Milanov, Warren on RCA
Domingo, Price, Milnes on RCA
Corelli, Price, Bastiannini on DGG.

For examples of how wonderful opera can be on Blu-ray, try Manon with Netrebko, Eugene Onegin with Hvorostovsky and Flemming, or Traviata with Gheorghiu.",1270944000,15,1958,4.8053892215568865
1805744,3,B00007CVSH,"Although the most impeccable singer in this production is Yvonne Naef, there is rarely a bad Azucena.  What really makes one pleasantly surprised is Hvorostovsky - his voice here has incredible squillo for a baritone, and the overall color is amazing.  He could be as great as Bastianini in Conte de Luna role if he could manage his everpresent problem - his loud breezing, which really ruins a lot of the effect of his unique voice.  I have seen Hvorostovsky in the Met live, as Don Giovanni, and in the theater the sound of his air intake is just as disturbing as here; it is only unfortunate that the owner of such a voice has such a technical problem.

Yvonne Naef is again excellent; yet Fiorenza Cossotto on Karajan's Trovatore, an older DVD, is even more thrilling.

Jose Cura sadly showed once more that he simply cannot sing - he does not have a voice, a divine gift, a talent, for singing; perhaps he could be an excellent musician playing some other kind of music; maybe an instrumentalist. If this man did not have his ravishing looks, he would probably never appeared in any important opera roles. In this particular production, he is too bestial, while the whole enigma of Manrico character is that he is a gentle man, not just a brutal brigand.  Perhaps Cura could learn from Domingo playing this role, although he could never ever reach the level of mastery that Domingo, Pavarotti and just about any other recorded tenor possess. This Cura's Trovatore is a shame vocally.

Veronica Villarroel sings pleasantly, while she looks and acts like a manequin; her acting here would be more fitting for Olympia, the mechanical doll from Offenbach's Tales of Hoffmann.  It is strange to see what a lively vivacious woman she is in the bonus track - somehow there, in real life, she looks younger than when she is in the role.  I also did not like her acting with the final scene with de Luna, when she behaves like a weak spineless beggar; how much more dignified Kabaivanska looks in Karajan's version of the same opera.

The production is nonetheless lavish; the scene of Schlager Duel at the beginning of Act III is very well staged. In any case, this performance overall is a fire caused by Hvorostovsky - bravo! - and could be bravissimo if he could fix his breezing issue.

Lastly, I wish they'd produce more Trovatores than Traviatas - the former is so much more superior musically to the latter, and even the story is exotic, away from Traviata's bourgeois banality.",1268352000,9,2482,4.682758620689655

1805746,5,B00007CVSH,"I've never been particularly enthused about this opera until now.  It justfiably has the reputation of having the silliest and most unreal plot of all operas but when the singing is as good as in this Covent Garden production then that can be overlooked.  The cast is uniformly great, the balance between the orchestra soloists and chorus fine which, combined with first class audio and video, make this a ""must have"" for opera lovers.  It is a gloomy opera and the scenes on stage are all appropriately gloomy, maybe a little too much at times, something which could be a challenge for some video systems.  I had a few reservations about Veronica Villarroel's singing in the role of Leonora in the first act but this was soon dispelled with the finale being hair raising stuff. Jose Cure, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, the brilliant Yvonne Naef and the rest of the cast are excellent and play and sing their roles with conviction and emotion. And that is about the best tribute which can ever be given to the supreme artistry of singers when relating such an unbelievable story. I have not looked at the extras yet so have no comment on them but expect they will add to the value of this release.  Highly recommended.",1249171200,5,1209,4.683962264150943

And I just listened yesterday to the Salsburg Trovatore with Corelli & Price, great as it gets.

Villaroel is tepid but very easy on the ears.....and eyes.

1805748,4,B00007CVSH,"This version of 'Il Travatore' reminds me of the Joan Sutherland/Opera Australia version of the 1970's in its tone, costume and setting. Despite not having Sutherland, I enjoyed this one immensely.

Jose Cura, Dmitri Hvorostovsky and Yvonne Naef are excellent in this version. The weakest link, unfortunately, is the Leonora played by Veronica Villarroel. She sings beautifully but not enough to quite sweep you away the rest of the singers do. Act IV, Scene I is just such an example. Manrico in the tower, Leonara singing against the steely white church window background. The music pulses, Manrico tugs at our heart strings but Leonora doesn't bring us up further.

Hvorostovsky is excellent in this production. As a baritone, he comes forward, he plays the Count with passion and rage and his performance is strong. Cura is great, strong but my favourite, Yvonne Naef is the real heart of this performance. Her Azucena is passionate, frightening, and sympathetic. The ending is a triumph, perhaps outdoing previous interpretations.

If you have seen the Joan Sutherland version I can highly recommend this. The costumes and the use of Schlager Dueling to add realism to the setting, lending depth and darkness to the Count's army gives this production further dimension. Superb, almost excellent but worthy of a purchase.",1241049600,3,1325,5.182242990654205
1805749,2,B00007CVSH,"Alas, I must dissent from the reviews already posted.  It is often said that Il Trovatore requires the four best singers in the world, and this performance does not rise to that level.  Clearly, this production is meant to showcase Hvorostovsky, whose burnished tone, silken legato, and sensitive singing is always a pleasure, but he is not really a Verdi Baritone (in short supply these days), and his voice is not really large enough for this part.  However, his big aria - Il Balen - is splendid.  Tenor Cura is a big guy with a big voice, but his voice is improperly placed (in the throat) and loses what little focus it has as it rises to the high notes.  Soprano Villarroel has several weaknesses:  She seems to be singing with a mouth full of Gummy Bears; she has no proper trill, and her pianissimo is oddly detached from the rest of the voice.

Opus Arte has a fine track record with their Blu-ray releases (I have several), but they have stumbled here.  The photography is grainy, and produces generous amounts of digital noise in many of the scenes.  This is perhaps exacerbated by the dimly lit production, not to mention the lavish amounts of fake fog which appears repeatedly for no apparent reason.  It often quite difficult to see what was going on, and several poor singers found themselves totally in the dark.  The sets were fine (what one could see of them), but the crowd scenes were a mess, with the choristers seeming to mill about at random.

If you want to see Hvorostovsky's ""Il Balen"", you can find it on YouTube, but I cannot recommend this very disappointing Blu-ray release.",1239062400,10,1604,4.628975265017668

The  sound is only that found on standard DVDs, not the master audios one can do with blu ray -- however the sound is good, with excellent imaging.  I do not have the background to comment on the vocal quality, except that I found it enjoyable; the audience did also.  The extra's are of high quality, interviews with the cast, a piece on set and costume design and a very nice piece on dueling and fight preparation,  the menu is arranged in an orderly way and it is easy to find one's way through the disk menus.",1237680000,5,743,4.340579710144928

A committed performance, dramatically perfect. I have seen this opera numerous times and have the Pavarotti version on DVD with the excellent Azucena but the end of the opera did not touch me dramatically like this one did. the soprano also gave a very good, involved performance.

1805755,3,B00007CVSH,"This production (the fourth I've seen) of Il Trovatore was a disappointment from the start with poor lighting throughout.  As for the sets and costumes, detail of which was obscured by the aforementioned lack of light, it was red for the gypsies and blue for the nobility. What a concept!  (This made it easy to spot the gypsy sympathizers in blue territory.)

I found it hard to believe that the pristine, blue-blooded Leonora would fall for the sweaty, greasy-hair, disheveled, gypsy-attired Manrico portrayed by Jose Cura.  Or that she would leave the church where she was about to become a nun and be found ""rolling in the hay"" with Manrico in the next scene.

Hvorostovsky's singing as Count di Luna was powerful and passionate and better than his acting.  The show stealer for me was Yvonne Naef as Azucena.  Her performance was emotionally gripping and believable, her singing top notch.  The other players were just adequate.  Except for Tomas Tomasson as Ferrando; I disliked his voice completely.

And yes, there were no anvils in the anvil scene and the gang rape of Azucena was really offensive.  And if you have pistols and rifles, why are you fighting with swords?  Is that a fair question?  And Hvorostovsky and Cura are complete opposites in appearance.  They are supposed to be brothers?  I know this is opera, but...",1198627200,3,1334,4.866666666666666
1805756,4,B00007CVSH,"Okay, simply stated:

Hvorostovsky: Highlight of the show. ""Il balen"" was stunning and his presentation was exquisite.

Cura: Not his best by any means, but a passable heroic tenor.

Villarroel: Not appropriate for this role. She skipped out on some of the high notes in the first aria. Not unheard of, but it should be expected of someone performing for a company as prestigious as Covent Garden. Not a bad voice, but she does not need to sing Verdi ever again. Also, she seemed sounded like she should've been Cura's mother, not lover. Highly disappointing. HIGHLY disappointing.

Naef: Wonderful. ""Stride la vampa"" was just wonderful. Very emotional and passionate. If it wasn't for Hvorostovsky, she would've been the entire show.

I can't remember their actual names, but the Ferrando and Inez were also very nice. Ferrando's aria made me hit ""back"" on my remote a few times and Inez had much more stage presence than Villarroel.

Overall, this is worth a watch.... if you can ignore freaky bondage fencers and their gang rape party.",1190073600,3,1038,4.936781609195402
1805757,4,B00007CVSH,"Jose Cura, simply not in his best vocally here.
In the 'bonus CD', Hvorostovsky and Cura commented on their portrayals in this production: they carried out real sword fights in Act I, as opposed to Pavarotti and Milnes' sham sword showing in the other set I've got. However, this highly dramatic scene has its cost - Cura was not attuned to this physical assertion. Dmitri actually gave an account of this scene in the commentary part - he gave credit to Cura, being a tenor, for making this scene dramatically effective. Judging from the performance, however, the credit actually goes to Dmitri, whose singing and acting (in duel) go on simultaneously in a high level without any sign of strain either way. A really great singing-actor. His di Luna is so adorable that really saved the production.
Cura's great duet with Yvonne Naef was also strained. Excuse me for comparing his Manrico with Pavarotti's. Naef isn't bad, but the other has got the great Zajick...",1170115200,,964,4.848484848484849
1805758,4,B00007CVSH,"Il Trovatore has a wild quality to it with its firelight nighttime settings, its revenge theme, its intense characters. I love how the opera often feels out of control even though, of course, the performers can't be. And that's why this is such a good production. The four leads attack their parts with passion, while exhibiting (for the most part) the control that Verdi requires of his singers.

The two stand-out performances are by Yvonne Naef and Dmitri Hvorostovsky. Naef is moving as Azucena, partly because she doesn't play her as crazed beyond belief. As a result, we can identify with her suffering. I love the clarity of her voice and the freshness of her acting. The audience's enthusiastic response to her is well-deserved. Hvorostovsky is charismatic as Count di Luna and possesses a truly great baritone voice -- rich and full and burnished.

Veronica Villaroel struggles at times with the vocal requirements of Leonora, particularly with the coloratura and the faster musical passages. But she's emotionally convincing as Leonora. As Manrico, Jose Cura's voice is rough around the edges (but then, Manrico is rough around the edges). Like Villaroel, Cura makes up for his vocal struggles by delivering a passionate acting performance, convincingly portraying the great range required for the role: loving son, warrior, spurned lover, grieving man.

The four leads put everything they've got into their roles and the high energy level that results keeps the viewer engaged from beginning to end. One example: While Villaroel's voice soars above them, Cura and Hvorostovsky engage in an intense sword fight as they sing ""Di geloso amor spezzato,"" the trio that closes Act I. Usually the players lock swords for a few seconds once they've finished singing and the applause has started. Not this group of players. They perform Il Trovatore with the wild abandon that befits this opera. I highly recommend it.",1147046400,8,1920,5.127795527156549
1805759,4,B00007CVSH,"I bought this  DVD on a complete whim last week, and I'm VERY glad I indulged. Trovatore has been one of my favorite operas for ages.  Visually (except in some cases noted below) this set has very high audio and visual production values. All the principal's performances work well on the dramatic level, and most of the time, on the vocal level, as well. And except for a few places, discussed below, the staging was excellent. In the last scene, it was a nice realistic touch that both Manrico and Azucena look as if they'd been roughed up.

  My ideal Manrico would have the looks and acting ability of Jose Cura and Pavarotti's voice and technique as it was in his prime. I found Cura's voice good and pleasant in the more melodic passages, but he does lack some of Pavarotti's technical finesse. There were rough patches in Cura's singing, notably in Di Quella Pira, but I enjoyed Ah Si Ben Mio.  On the positive side of the balance sheet, Jose Cura definitely looks the part, and you don't have to wonder what Leonora sees in him. He concentrates on and responds well to the other Principals, which I liked. Cura and Villaroel are believable as the lovers for the most part, they stay close together on stage, and their love scenes have real tenderness. I liked it that Manrico and the Count go at each other with swords as if they really mean it. In some operatic duels, the swordsmen give you the impression they might as well be waving tennis rackets.  But those two show their characters are real rivals in love and can barely be in the same room, together without fighting.

 Dmitri Hvorostovsky  as Count di Luna is a worthy rival for Leonora, and his singing is superb. He can sing Il Balen to me ANY time! Like Jose Cura, he really gets absorbed in his part, he looks at and sings to the other cast members, and when he fights, he doesn't hold back. His romantic frustration pushes him farther and farther beyond reason, but I couldn't help feeling sorry for him.  You could see him thinking ""What is WRONG with this girl, to go after a gypsy, and why can't I make her love me?"" Given all that he has to offer, one has to wonder if he made some terrible blunder with Leonora early that completely turned her off him. At the end after he shoots Manrico, it was a nice touch that he goes over to Manrico and holds his body in his arms-something that isn't possible with the more traditional staging of Manrico being beheaded offstage.

 Yvonne Naef makes a good Azucena, and she and Cura have good stage rapport. Manrico is a loving son in the prison scene at the end. The only real complaint I have is that Naef looks younger than the Count, and more like Manrico's sister than his mother. I would like a bit more power in her lower range, but it's still a good performance. I just confess I have a hard time taking Azucena's mistake of throwing her own child into the fire seriously. I really have to suspend my disbelief for that one.

Vocally, Veronica Villaroel is the weak link, but she certainly acts the part of Leonora with conviction, and looks the part, as well.  It's plausible that she could have two attractive young men fighting over her. She was better in the ensemble parts than in her solo moments, as her voice lacks the sheer beauty needed for this part, although it is not unpleasant. Tacea la Notte went better than D'Amor Sul allee rosee. Villaroel struggled with the high notes and coloratura, but did very well in the Miserere and Tu Vedrai. And she really digs into her fourth act duet with the Count with passion.  She interacted well with both her male leads.  I just wish she hadn't kept getting up and walking away from Manrico in Act III-it's one of the few happy moments they have together and it doesn't last long. Why did she keep getting up and moving away from him?

The reason for the 4 stars is because of the production. Placing the action in 19th century Italy doesn't ruin Trovatore, but it doesn't add much, either.  The few anachronisms of the different time setting such as Leonora singing of tournaments in the 19th century does not make the opera all that much sillier.  The Count and Manrico carrying pistols as WELL as swords is a bit more problematic. Why do they need the swords if they can just shoot each other?  But since sword-play is dramatically important to the plot, they should have left out the pistols.

  In an opera that has nothing to do with sailing or ships, why is Count di Luna dressed like an admiral?  Also, Hvorostovsky's gray hair made him look significantly older than the other principals. I just wish he had worn a dark wig instead to make him look nearer Manrico's  age.

  Most of the staging was effective, but I did not care for Azucena's near rape in Count di Luna's camp in Act 3.  Tasteless and unnecessary. Also did not like Manrico's cigar-what does a singer need with a cigar????? Ugh!

  Leonora's death scene is also awkward.  After his tenderness to her in Act III, couldn't Manrico get up and greet Leonora properly when she comes in? When he finally realizes she's dying, he does go and take her in his arms and give her some love, but they remain standing until the very last moment. He couldn't ease her gracefully to the floor, instead?",1132185600,12,5240,4.492616033755274
1805760,5,B00007CVSH,"I owned this dvd for year and a half, and, considering that this is a very ""popular"" opera, this version is, after all this time, giving me the same pleasure as when i just got it.
First, because of the cast: Cura and Villaroel were known to me because of Verdi's Otello (Turin, 1997). Hvorostovsky was unknown, as well as Ivonne Naef.

My biggest surprise and satisfaction was Hvorostovsky's Count Di Luna, one of my favorite roles among the verdian baritones (just after Macbeth, of course). He is such a great actor, getting into his roles with passion and discipline (coming from the russian school, no wonder he's like that...) His voice is a delight.

Then, Cura and Villaroel gave me the same impression i expected: Plenty knowledge about their roles and intentions, and giving great acting when the ""peaks"" of the drama need to be enforced to enrich the play. Not to mention the voices, dramatic and strong, just as i expect in this characters.

Moshinsky's point of view of this opera is very good. I just admire his work here, and in other works like Samson et Dalila or Nabucco (Productions i hope i'll see very soon).

Carlo Rizzi, after this Trovatore, and other operas i heard from him, is becoming my favorite verdian director. You can feel his compenetration with the music and the story. The Royal opera orchestra is splendid as always.

There is some bonus material here, a docummentary about the cast, some facts about the fighting sequence, and the synopsis. That's a plus in the BBC recordings: We can find supporting material for what we are about to see. For me is important to have some information about the direction and conception of the opera. Good for it.

That's why i recommend this dvd, the cast is first rate, the production is awesome and, by the way, is the latest from Covent Garden and Real de Madrid. The sound is great and the image very clear as well.

5 stars!",1101859200,11,1901,4.6398809523809526
1805761,3,B00007CVSH,"As a long time Verdi fan, I looked forward to this DVD with great hopes. I was looking for a version that did not have either Pavarotti or Domingo in the title role and that utilized digital technology to provide good home viewed opera. Obviously, from the title line, my hopes were not realized.

First of all, this is a cut version of Verdi's work; it is incomplete. After all these years of including every note that the maestro composed, I had hoped that the older, truncated versions of the score had been trashed.  Disappointment number one!

Second, Jose Cura in the title role of Manrico has trouble with vocal technique. He forces a ""covered"" or head tone far too low in the middle register, as low as e-flat in some instances. The tone produced is plain ugly. He can act, though.

Third, soprano Veronica Villarroel is just not a ""Verdi soprano"". Oh, she sings with some excellent sensitivity, once she gets warmed up, but she is no Leontyne Price by a long shot. Ms. Villarroel would do well enough in bel canto, but lacks the vocal depth to do justice to Verdi.

Fourth, the staging is horrible! The convent scene looks like an electrical power station; the firearms carried by Manrico's men include flintlock rifles and bolt action ones. The second scene contains the famous ""Anvil Chorus"", but there are no  anvils, and no fire where there is supposed to be one during Azucena's aria, ""Stride la vampa"".

The plusses are there, but not enough to outweigh the negatives.  Hvorostovsky is the best Count di Luna I have ever seen, and is vocally second only to the incomparable Leonard Warren. The conductor, chorus and orchestra all do very well, and the Digital technology is excellent throughout.

However, my advice is to save your money and wait for another version. At the rate that operas are being issued these days, it should not be long before someone like TDK gives us a Trovatore to rave about. Until then, enjoy some of the othere great operas that are available here.",1100995200,39,1992,4.684813753581662

1805764,4,B00007CVSH,"A truly wonderful rendition of Verdi's tragic opera.

This presentation is from the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden with conductor Carlo Rizzi and is performed before a live audience. The stars of this opera are Jose Cura (Manrico), Dmitri Hvorostovsky (Count di Luna), Yvonne Naef (Azucena) and Veronica Villarroel (Leonora).

The casting...superb; the acting is committed and as passionate as anyone could wish for in this dramatic work by Verdi. The voice qualities are superior for all the principals, with the characters of Hvorostovsky and Villarroel leading the way.

The loss of one star (really 1/2 star if it was available) in my rating was as a result of a few things that niggled me during the performance ...  for instance

-The sets, although well done, (and undoubtedly a lot of time and effort went into their construction) were cold and grim in their appearance: then add to this, the effect of the darkness of nighttime scenes and you had an opera where it seemed impossible to find a ray of brightness throughout the entire work.

-The only subtitled language on the DVD is English. It would have been nice to at least to have the option of following the opera in Italian.

-And finally (and a really picky point here) but one I feel obliged to mention because once I noticed this, I just could not get the idea out of my mind: that being, the officers costume worn by Count di Luna reminded me of something that would be seen on the doorman of a fancy New York hotel.  I'm sorry, but I just had to get that out.

All in all a solid Il Trovatore. To me, there were a few minor distractions, but the great acting and singing would allow me to highly recommend this work.",1086912000,6,1691,4.591362126245847
1805765,5,B00007CVSH,"After almost falling asleep with the Met's production of Il Trovatore (despite some great singing), I was very pleased with this production. The singing is very good, specially Hovorostovsky's Count di Luna. The only somewhat weak singing came in my opinion from Villaroel's Leonora, who is not the right type of soprano for the role, and cannot cope well with Verdi's difficult score. However, her singing is very emotional, as is the case with the rest of the cast. The sets, even though transported to the nineteenth century, are wonderful (specially compared to the Met's nonexistent and boring sets) as are the costumes. In fact I find the period change to be a welcome change to the traditional staging. As other reviewers have mentioned, it gives the production a film-like feel.
Rizzi's direction is very exciting and the 5.1 DD sound is very very good. Special praise to the chorus! Far more exciting than the Met's, this production is highly recommended!!",1081123200,17,965,5.0

Cura is unmatched in this interpretation. This looser character is real at last. I blead with him all the way down the maelstorm that was his life.
Hovorostovsky, singing like a God, he makes you wonder why Leonora would prefer an unkept  gypsy boy to him.  I'm usually bored with the gypsy Mama, but Naef made me watch every line like I'd never heard it before.  These singers were  totally into the story and they carried me along with them.
Watching this DVD made me wish I'd bought a ticket, flew to London and seen the real thing, live on the stage.",1069459200,11,713,4.371212121212121
1805767,4,B00007CVSH,"Indeed, the principals are ideally cast here. Dmitri Hvorostovsky's suave, evil, yet somehow still-human Count nearly steals the show. He's far superior to all the Counts recorded. Jose Cura gives a believable performance as Manrico, even though he pays more attention to acting than to music. For instance, ""Ah si, ben mio"" is a bit choppy in sound, but acted out very well.
I really enjoyed Veronica Villaroel's Leonora. Like Cura, she put more emphasis on acting, but she managed some of the most difficult music with excellent artistry and skill. Brava!
Yvonne Naef looked and sang an ideal Azucena.
What kept distracting me was the staging. First of all, it looks like late 19th century Italy (vs. Austria), making Leonora's Tale D'Amor (a knight with an unmarked shield came, etc) along with many other story details quite improbable. Ferrando has a shaved head and looks too young to remember the events of the old days passed. Now, for the ugly:
1. When Azucena is captured, the ""warriors"" nearly rape (!) her onstage. This is inappropriate for Verdi's delicate, highly melodious music. Neither works the scene when Leonora and Manrico are in some sort of hay stack (okay, call me a purist but I thought it was low brow theater).
2. The strange sabre (schlager) dueling (the producers made a big fuss about it) does not add any value. The ""fighters"" look like made-up ballet dancers of some sort, they're wearing leather trappings more appropriate for a cult dance club they way Hollywood depicts them). Either include some real sabre or foil fencing or don't bother with ""authentications"" of this sort.
3. During the famous Anvil chorus, I surely did not see any anvils. (And Manrico smoked a cigar!)
4. Finally, when telling her hounting tale, Azucena is supposed to be pointing at a fire, or a place where there once was a fire. Needless to say, nothing of the kind is at sight. She just has to point at an empty space. Hmm...
Throughout the whole performance, I kept wishing for a traditional (yes) staging, so that it would be more believable.
Dante Ferretti is a well-known set designer for the movies and theater, but while opera staging can be minimalist it should not take away from the story.
I suggest getting this DVD for the great singing, most notably the wonderfully done Miserere and Il Balen. Carlo Rizzi does a splendid job, although a bit too brisk at some moments.
The DVD itself has a pretty good quality, but the booklet does not list the supporting roles, which is a shame because the singers gave exciting performances.",1063756800,64,2551,4.813211845102506

7975013,5,B00007CVSH,"Il Trovatore is arguably the most melodic and the most tragic of Verdi's operas. Although the worst of the tragedies are described in the text and not depicted on stage. In this staging, while maybe unusual, it is certainly not so far fetched as many in recent years. One wonders why most operatic conductors try so hard to interpret the music following the instructions of the composer when at the same time so many stage directors and stage managers go far afield in their efforts in ignoring the composer's instructions for the staging. A larger question is why are they permitted to do so? Verdi, but probably Wagner more so, would be astonished if he were alive today to see some of the staging interpretations that have been used in the last twenty years or so, even at such respected houses as the Met and Bayreuth. This joint production of Teatro Real Madrid and the Royal Opera House is quite tame in comparison. Though there are a couple of oddities here they do not detract overall from the musical elements which on the whole are enhanced. The four principle singers are excellent with Hvorostovsky as di Luna and Naef as Azucena being outstanding. The Chorus is beautiful in their several numbers. The video production is very well done.",1455840000,,1250,4.738532110091743

7975017,4,B00007CVSH,"Domingo is in luscious voice, though he cuts Di Quella Pira short.  Raina Kabaivanska begins in poor voice, with a hard edge.  It does improve somewhat, but she is the weak link here, not Cappuccilli, who is adequate.  I have never been a Cossotto fan, but she does a fine job as Azucena, except for the toll the years have taken on her instrument.  The bass is mediocre, but his part is not large.  I have a recording of Kabaivanska just two years prior to this and she sounds fine.  Perhaps she was just getting over a cold, but she should have canceled because it ruins what would have been an excellent video.  Speaking of video, the picture quality looks like they just transferred a poor VHS tape to DVD.  Very bad.  The recently recorded Trovatore with Marcelo Alvarez is better all around, and with superb HD quality.  The soprano is its weak link as well, but she is better than Kabaivanska.",1434153600,2,900,4.5
