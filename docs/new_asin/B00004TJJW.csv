1350507,5,B00004TJJW,I FOUND DRAGON TALES VERY GOOD FOR THE KIDS IT HELPS THEM LEARN,1003536000,7,63,3.923076923076923
1350508,5,B00004TJJW,"I really enjoyed it and sooooo did my 3 year old, he would watch it every day if he had not lost the disc, at some point I would love to replace the disc and allow him to watch it as much as he would like, I had a similar response with older some at this age when I bought a Lion King on video.",988934400,2,294,3.5384615384615383
1350509,5,B00004TJJW,"Excellent PBS television series on DVD for anytime use!  The Illustrations by Ron Roedecker are enchanting and children adore them!  Thank you for  giving small children their childhood back! No scarey, blood and guts here,  just fun, caring entertainment with great messages!",966988800,9,276,5.5
1350510,4,B00004TJJW,"DRAGON TALES: THE ADVENTURES IN DRAGON LAND comes to us from the creators of ""Sesame Street"".  Featuring all of your favorate Dragon pals,  (Emmy, Max, Zak & Wheezie, Ord and Quetzal among others.) The disc  features five animated adventures: ""To Kingdome Come,"" ""Baby  Troubles,"" ""Bad Share Day,"" ""Zak Takes A Drive""  and ""The Forest Of Darkness.""
Needless to say, this is really  for the very young, I'd say about 2-4 yr olds.  Personally I can't say that  I'm a fan of the animation, but as a teaching video for small children, it  beats Barney any day of the week.  And the lessons taught are valuable and  easily presented for the age group.  This DVD also includes a full frame  transfer, English and Spanish 2.0 stereo tracks and 3 sing along with  Dragon Tales songs, sure to keeps your kids in song for days.",966038400,12,817,4.6223776223776225
1350511,3,B00004TJJW,"It's good animation for kids. You can see the pretty girl Emmy, her  borther Max, dragon Quetzal, Ord etc. They learn challenges through  adventure on the world.",961545600,,161,4.925925925925926
1350521,5,B00004TJJW,Replacing a 2-yr olds copy.  Much better experience than with the original purchase.  He's already excited to be getting it. Arrived in a timely fashion and all packaging was intact.,1445212800,,182,5.033333333333333

1350523,1,B00004TJJW,Is it just one episode?,1440115200,,23,3.8
1350524,1,B00004TJJW,Very disappointed! The movie skips so horribly  that you cant even watch it. Cant believe i wasted my money on this piece of garbage!,1439510400,,133,4.541666666666667
1350525,2,B00004TJJW,"Nothing great about this at all. Easily one of the weakest animated TV shows that PBS and the creators of Sesame Street have produced! There are so many things that this TV show does wrong. This whole show doesn't make since at all! The plot is weak, it's contrived at times, and it jumps around too much, and it can be too serious at times, too. The characters are really annoying, the number one thing that completely ruins this show is a two headed dragon character, they're way to silly and annoying, and they just don't fit into the show. Who comes up with making a two headed dragon character, anyway? No other kid show I've seen does this except Dragon tales! Emmy and Max are weak characters, they're not very interesting or cute, and they are not intelligent or attractive to humans in any kind of way. There are too many songs, and a lot of them aren't good at all, and they don't make a whole lot of sense, either. This show is really not teaching a good lesson to kids. This show is basically teaching kids how to leave home without telling they're parents first. That just not right! Something is just off on this show, the animation is nowhere near as wonderful as the other animated PBS Kids shows. For me, that was another problem with this whole show. The only thing I liked in this whole TV show is the music they play during the TV show episodes. If you're looking for a cuter and better animated TV show, try Chloe's Closet, or Lalaloopsy. Still, this show was a bore!",1429833600,,1488,4.414545454545454

1350544,4,B00004TJJW,"In the first episode, Zak and Wheezie separate, then make up and get back together.

The second episode is my favorite because after a busy day in Dragon Land, Emmy and Max come home and collapse from exhaustion because of all the rides they take to go to Wonder World.

The next episode is about Max feeling frustrated because he cannot reach items and a unicorn who lost her glasses and cannot see.  It's about overcoming things you cannot do.

""Dragon Sales"" is another good episode because Ord saves the day.

Zak is overly dramatic in the last episode. He is a lot like me with anxiety.",1330128000,,591,4.485981308411215
1350545,3,B00004TJJW,"These Dragon Tales are not nearly as good as the newer kids' videos like Dora, Diego and Backyardigans.  They have good messages but I found the voices a bit irritating.  The Spanish soundtrack has some translation errors--not that it isn't correct Spanish but that I think the original meaning of some phrases was misunderstood.  It wasn't as good as I had hoped.",1319673600,,364,4.838709677419355

The only thing I will say is that she was not concerned about 'the dark' until she saw the fifth episode (Forest of Darkness); I think the episode 'taught' her to be afraid of the dark. But love the dvd; it's definitely her favorite.",1261612800,,319,4.517241379310345
1350548,2,B00004TJJW,"I was really looking forward to getting the second Dragon Tales DVD for my daughter.  I picked up the first at a local discount retailer and was really pleased...especially for $3.00.  Unfortunately, I spent more than twice of what was spent at the discount retailer and the sound quality was EXTREMELY lacking. Nowhere near broadcast quality. Even after turning the volume up to the maximum level on the portable DVD in the car, you have to strain to hear what appears to be an excellent set of story lines.  Too bad we can't hear them.",1250467200,,537,4.631578947368421
