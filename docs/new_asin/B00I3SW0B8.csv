6248484,1,B00I3SW0B8,HORRIBLE! Nothing more than 3 hard-on-the-eyes VHS to DVD transfers. You can even see VHS tracking in numerous frames! This is NOT what was described on the catalog page when I purchased and I strongly advise others not to waste money on this particular item.,1408060800,11,259,4.777777777777778

6248487,2,B00I3SW0B8,"Very bad transfer from tape to DVD. Blank video in places. The documentary, great white death, spends more time on other sea life than they do on sharks.",1442188800,,153,4.5

8638851,1,B00I3SW0B8,VERY DISAPPOINTED IN EVERYTHING!!,1509926400,,33,7.5
8638852,1,B00I3SW0B8,I decided to give it a try because the cover looked interesting. The movies are so awful I couldn't even get past a few minutes of each and even tried fast forwarding to see if it got better. They all looked like they are made in the 60s. The first one I have no words for it was just boring.  The 2nd one at some spots the shark was swimming sideways. The 3rd movie looked a little better until I got past the shark attack. Unless your looking for something that looked like it was made before Jaws don't bother getting this DVD,1502409600,,529,4.135922330097087

8638855,1,B00I3SW0B8,"What I find comical is that 1981's ""Great White"" (aka ""The Last Shark"" was sued for ripping off ""Jaws"", and now this dvd's cover is ripping off ""Great White"". And the biggest ripoff is on the poor unsuspecting person that buys this dvd.",1464739200,,236,4.511627906976744
