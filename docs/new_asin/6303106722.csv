7837538,4,6303106722,"This film is in a small sub-genre of movies about Vikings in North America that includes ""The Norseman"" with Lee Majors and Cornel Wilde. This movie, though smaller and lower budgeted than ""The  Norseman,"" is far better in its historical authenticity,  believability, and accessability to a family audience.
The story follows  a young Irish Christian, a slave to a crew of Vikings, who escapes on the  shore of North America and becomes friends with a Native tribe. The  ""magic stone"" is a quartz stone through which a navigator can  find the sun in a hazy sky. There is one particular Viking, who doesn't  like the Irishman and wants the stone, who keeps on interfering with the  possibility of peaceful trading between the Vikings and Natives by killing  the Natives. The story does cover some documented details of the Norse  colonization, including the time a woman rallied a band of warriors who had  been trapped by the Natives (called ""Skraelings"" by the  Vikings).
It is pretty obvious by the understated style of acting, the  good-looking young actors, and other details of the production that this  film was intended to be family friendly, not too scary for young children  (in this instance, the film does not suffer for that). There are a few  battle scenes with swords, spears, and some blood, but they are handled  with restraint and tact.
The Natives speak in their own language  (subtitled) through the first half of the movie, until a plot point allows  the actors to speak in the Irisman's/Vikings language (English).",963360000,4,1535,4.92578125
