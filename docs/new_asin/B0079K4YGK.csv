5066869,5,B0079K4YGK,"Getbackers is a 49 episode anime series that came out in 2002.
The series is about gingi and Ban who run a ""lost and found"" sort of service. They claim they can return anything and have a 100% return rate! Though it wouldn't be a great anime if they didn't get caught up with the wrong gang when trying to return a simple cat toy or whatever they are assigned to do.
This series is a definite must have. When I originally watched the series back in 04' I loved it so much. The characters are original and really drag you into the show. Watching it now I still enjoy the show and can finally finish it after all these years of leaving it un-finished. To continue, the dub is fantastic they do a great job of filling in the role of their characters and the voices seemed to match each character perfectly.(This release does include the japanese language with English subtitles,however at the time of this review I have only had the time to be able to watch the English audio version of the show)

Now on to the product itself. The product contains 8 dvds. Each dvd contains 6 episodes , which the last one containing 7. The case is a spine case style , which may turn some people off, but none the less the packaging of the dvd's is great quality. Each DVD is easy to remove and art work on the disc looks great! The art on each disc appears to be from one of the original covers from the original DVD release of the series back in 04'-05'.

My only complaints about the packaging are the following:
1)Because the 1st and 8th disc are on the front and back of the case(instead of an individual spine like the other 6 disc) there is a little ring in the front/back of the case you can see when you hold the case.
2)The disc had a weird burnt smell too them. Maybe its just how Sentai Filmwork does things, but it was a very strange smell.

Both of these are very minor complaints. Overall Amazing release of an amazing series , don't pass up getting this. Sentai filmworks did an excellent job giving this series a second chance to shine and I am personally glad they did.

Also just a little math, for 37 dollars,at the time of this review, you get 49 episodes which total 1225 minutes (including the opening and ending theme songs in each episode). That is about 20 and a half hours of entertainment/ 75 cents an episode. The math alone can show you the amazing deal this is! Its rare to have a complete anime series to be released so cheaply and so well released like this.",1336780800,15,2473,4.3004291845493565
5066910,4,B0079K4YGK,"After reading the other notes on this, I was anticipating more comedic elements not so dependent on kooky or chibi character art. However, it is a better series overall than many, and it is hard to argue that this price for so many episodes is a true selling point. Personally, I much preferred the single or double episode stories in which they sought after a missing item for an average person to the battle-anime epics focused on the main characters fighting more powerful opponents one after another. And I never developed a true attachment to any character.",1372896000,,562,4.804123711340206
5066911,5,B0079K4YGK,"I just received the set and it was fantastic.  This set contains 8 DVDs (6 Episodes EACH).  The Disc #8 contains 7 Episodes.  More importantly, this set somehow includes all of the Extra Features from an old ADV's individual DVD editions with somewhat improved picture and audio quality.  I also love the packaging.  As a result,  I am glad that I have purchased this set.  I Highly recommend this set over an old ADV set.",1369094400,2,422,4.546666666666667
5066912,5,B0079K4YGK,"I had really liked the manga and the series is enjoyable as well.  Not disappointed at all.  Yes they use still shots in place of moving in some parts of action, but that didn't bother me.  The characters provide much entertainment and laughs.  I guess small children might not like it but there really isn't much adult themes (other then busty girls) but nothing to worry over.  The language must have been minimal at best because off hand, I can remember it being at all offensive or excessive in the least bit.",1367539200,,513,4.532608695652174
5066913,5,B0079K4YGK,"I used to watch this on the anime network, glad I found it and bought it.
This fits perfectly in my anime collection!!!!!",1366502400,,121,4.304347826086956
5066914,5,B0079K4YGK,"Funny, entertaining, adventurous and a very different story line that fascinates.
Only sad that it doesn't continue to the end.",1365897600,,127,5.4
5066915,5,B0079K4YGK,"This anime is super amazing.

If you like action, fighting and comedy this is the must see anime

Everybody should see it.",1361750400,,122,4.5
5066916,5,B0079K4YGK,"I love everything about this product. I only heard of this title once, but I bought the DVDs anyway. The packaging was great and the DVDs weren't damaged or scratched at all. I would recommend this title and company to my friends.",1356480000,,230,4.5
5066917,5,B0079K4YGK,I first watch this on youtube and it made me laugh every time i watch this anime and i just had to have it. Now i got it my brother enjoys it as well now whenever our internet goes out and we want to watch this anime we got the dvd now and we still laugh everytime we watch it. I recomend this one to any anime lover there are to give this one a try,1353542400,,349,3.6052631578947367
5066918,4,B0079K4YGK,"Really good animation, the fights are fully animated the characters were given adequate background story so you start to like them. It's a little long but I've learned in anime that's a good complaint the dialogue can get a little corny nothing that will surprise hardcore anime watchers the story was surprisingly good considering the slow start. It's defiantly worth a watch and I look forward to re-watching it but I'll let the rating speak for me.",1347580800,2,451,4.87012987012987
5066919,4,B0079K4YGK,"I'd give this anime a 7/10 but I'll round up to 4 stars because the story was fantastic. The price was acceptable. I don't wan't to reveal to much but the action is great if that is what you are looking for in an anime and the story is engaging but the animation at some points is rough. Also, I would have enjoyed it more if it was more serious but it falls prey to immaturity at times as many serious anime's do. But it is worth the watch and isn't excessively long. It is also a bargain. If you are looking for an action anime series and don't mind a few immature scenes then I highly recommend.",1339459200,2,598,4.076271186440678
8512835,1,B0079K4YGK,Brand new out of the box and I have 2 of the same disc. Missing episodes 37-42,1519516800,,78,3.6470588235294117

8512837,1,B0079K4YGK,"This is for the product only, not the story, I love Get Backers and can't find the copy I have had for years.

That is why this was so disappointing. The opening and closing songs sound like the singer has her head in a bucket. The third time I loaded the first disc, because I could not watch more than one at a time, the disk froze and would not play the fourth episode. After that the disc would not even load to the copyright screen. I'm so disappointed I had to return it but it's not possible to watch.

Edit
This product is so terrible it sucks monkey balls; I don't know if you can say that on Amazon but it's the truth. This is the second one I ordered that: the second time I tried to watch the first disc it will not load. I spent a hour before I went to bed trying to watch it and it will not even read.

And the first one when I returned it I was charged a processing fee to return defective product we will see what happens this time. But I will not buy or recommend that anyone does, this is crap. And it's a shame because this is a really good anime but whoever is make this dvd set needs to stop. Or not send me the same defective discs, I waited two weeks and ordered this second one but its unwatchable. I knew something was off when I woke up yesterday and my tv and DVD player both were powered off and that would only happen if a disc error happened during play back and the tv stopes receiving a signal. Such a shame",1495843200,,1439,4.006968641114983

8512842,3,B0079K4YGK,I love the story and the art. This is one anime I had been searching for a long time and I was not disappointed. I am just very angry that the container almost crumbled when it arrived.  It almost damaged the discs.  Fortunately the discs remained intact.  The delivery was ahead of schedule as usual And I appreciate it very much. Now I just had to search for a container to house 8 discs! Sigh!,1419379200,,396,4.253333333333333
8512843,5,B0079K4YGK,"Fantastic series, its very fast paced and always has someone fighting someone. Great storyline. You will love the main two Characters, but also love the ones that surround them. Perfect story, tho they could have ended it better, they leave you with a feeling of unfinished and lots of questions. I do recommend this series to have in you collection.",1413504000,,350,4.85
