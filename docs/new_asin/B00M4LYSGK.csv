8670291,5,B00M4LYSGK,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Mostly Japanese actors and Japanese director but produced with Taiwanese money and input. It greatly reminded me of the Hong Kong movies I used to go to see in the early 90s, having a lot of their look and feel. Very nostalgic for me. As for the plot, it involves interdimensional travel between 4 different worlds and the same charactors, with some differences, show up in all 4 worlds. So it is somewhat complicated to follow the plot. So most people apparently don't. I personally think many science fiction fans might appreciate that.",1502668800,,571,4.836734693877551

8670296,5,B00M4LYSGK,"This film is sci-fi action that has multiple versions of the characters due to having the story take place across four different Earths. Original World is the prime earth and has futuristic tech such as dimensional portals and weapons. Retro World seems to take place in a countryside setting but is really our earth. A world where magic exists and a post-nuclear world rounds out the settings.

The two dimension police shown on cover have uncovered a plot to take over all four worlds but will result in massive destruction across space/time. A film that needs to be paid attention to since it does cross four worlds with different versions of the characters. Note that the film is in Japanese only (with English subtitles).",1419897600,4,726,4.854838709677419
