8314490,5,B001K98M64,This series I first watched in Japanese with english subtitles. I think that is definitely the best way to veiw it. The storyline is very good and the charactors are easy to relate to. It is definitely one of my favorite Animes.,1318809600,,228,4.4523809523809526
8314491,4,B001K98M64,"First three episodes are ok, but after that its pretty funny. The books are WAY better tho. Theres things that the books explain better. And things that happen in the books that don't show up in the anime. But for the price its good for some laughs.",1308960000,,249,4.319148936170213
8314492,4,B001K98M64,"Four boys must turn a girl into a refined lady, except that she believes that she's ugly -- and I mean gargoyle ugly. Oh, and their rent is on the line. Yeah, ""Wallflower: The Complete Collection Part One"" sounds kind of generic at first. But while it takes a little while to get used to the characters, this hilarious, surreal anime takes off like a nosebleeding rocket after the first few episodes.

Four staggeringly beautiful teenage boys -- bookish Takanaga, childlike Yuki, brash Kyohei and flirtatious Ranmaru -- are living in a luxurious mansion. One day their landlady offers them a deal: if they can turn her niece Sunako into a refined lady, their living expenses will be completely free. Of course, they accept.

Then they actually MEET Sunako. She has bad hair/skin/clothes/social skills, and spends all her time alone in a dark bedroom, watching horror movies and talking to her biology models. And she's convinced that she'll melt if she sees the ""creatures of light,"" aka the boys.

But with their living expenses on the line, the boys valiantly try to turn Sunako into the perfect lady. Instead, they end up enmeshed with illegal clubs, haunted houses, arrogant photographers, Halloween, nabe and a kotatsu, math tutoring, magic mushrooms, bang-cutting, the explosive school festival, housecleaning, and murder at a hot spring!

The Pygmalion-esque plot of ""The Wallflower"" is something that's been done thousands of times before. But this anime spices up its story by being hilarious, frenetic and sometimes insane -- there's a squad of insane ""goth loli sisters,"" ""Road To Womanhood"" tutorials, and the EPIC ELEMENTAL PING-PONG GAME OF DEATH!

The first couple episodes are a little rough, and at first the characters are kind of flat. But then the writers settle into a comfortable rhythm -- the dialogue is weird (""Stupid Adam! Stupid Eve! Stupid DNA! Stupid Pithecanthropus!""), and there are a lot of funny pokes at anime conventions (how many nosebleeds can Sunako have?!). Some of the episodes are introduced by ""Hiroshi,"" an anatomical model missing his internal organs. The one problem is that a few of the jokes don't really translate for American viewers -- who are those tanned girls with the sharp nails?

And the characters start out a little two-dimensional (Bookworm, Flirt, Jerk, Doom'n'gloom Girl) but are gradually fleshed out over time -- Kyohei seems like a jerk at first, but has a good heart underneath it all; Takanaga is mature in all ways but romance; Ranmaru is flirty but rather naive; and Yuki is adorably childlike. And Sunako seems very weird and antisocial at first, but she turns out to be nice if sinister. And, of course, she can kick butt.

Small note on the English voice actors: at first I didn't think they fit the characters, especially Josh Grelle as Kyohei and Vic Mignogna as Takanaga. But after a few episodes the actors settle nicely into their roles, especially Hannah Alcorn and her scratchy, slightly wild voice.

""The Wallflower: Complete Collection Part One"" sounds like yet another glorified makeover show, but instead it's a hilarious, unabashedly weird little anime. A delight.",1303084800,,3147,5.05009633911368
8314493,4,B001K98M64,"I've not really been into much shoujo series lately. But ever since I first read this series online I've basically fallen in love with it! And not for the ""bishies"" or the sappy romances or whatever, but because of Sunako! She has got to be (in my opinion) one of the most unique shoujo heroines out there! And not to mention the hilarity that ensues as she constantly scares the living bajeebers out of the four ""radiant creatures"" who are currently living under the same roof as her in each episode! Sure, the four other guys are kinda cliche in some sense and ""unrealistic"", but in a series like this it's almost like those traits are used as a joke! (at least that's what I got from it.)

However, the production quality of this anime series didn't really live up to the kind of expectation I had set. The voice recording quality of the Japanese version is pretty poor, like it was recorded in a studio with bad acoustics. And in some cases the background music almost seems to over power the dialogue. The English dub really wasn't that bad, but really could have done with out the corny lines that sometimes come up. The animation quality wasn't as well done as I had hoped for. And the few scenes where the male characters had ""chibi"" bodies while their faces were normal really struck me as, well, how do I put this? It just didn't look pleasant. (or funny)

But in the end, the characters and laughs I get from each episode over shadowed my disappointment in the production quality and  really made it worth the money and time I spent on this DVD collection!",1247270400,,1567,4.491228070175438
8314494,5,B001K98M64,"I was on the fence about buying this - it was suggested to me because I really liked Ouran Host Club but since watching it haven't found anything as funny or entertaining.

Get off the fence and pick this up - unlike alot of animes i've seen that really aren't that 'funny' this one really is. Yeah so the guy's animation looks kinda....fruity...but don't let that deter you because it makes sense once you start watching it.

Pick this up, I bought it with REALLY low expectations, and would have to say this is now in my top 3 animes of all time - and i've seen alot of anime :)",1239580800,,580,4.216216216216216
8314495,5,B001K98M64,"What more can I say except that this demented show makes me laugh out loud every time I watch it. (Maybe they need to up my medication doseage again; I don't know...)
And, that I'm eagerly waiting to get the second half of this collection as soon as its availible. (They will definately have to up my meds after this....)",1234915200,,321,4.366666666666666
8314496,5,B001K98M64,"Shinichi Watanabe, the director of Excel Saga and Puni Puni Poemy is back with another insane anime, The Wallflower.
The basic story for this anime is that 4 beautiful men (Kyohei, Yuki, Ranmaru and Takenaga) who live in an elaborate mansion are given an offer they can't refuse by the owner of the mansion. If they can transform her niece Sunako into a respectful woman, then they can live rent free...however, if they fail their rent will triple. Sounds straight forward...well they haven't met Sunako yet. The boys agree to this challenge and the Aunt goes away to let them complete their task.
To the boys' utter horror, sunako; despite being the niece of a rich and elegant Aunt, is a scruffy, visually unflattering, goth who likes to banish herself away in her bedroom and watch splatter movies.

What results is a hilarious and insane anime. I was laughing all the way through these episodes. Like Watanabes previous comedy installments, this anime is totally nuts, with loud and hyperactive characters. I also particularly love the way this anime humours itself by including some serious moments, only to ruin them with something hilarious happening.
The wallflower stands out from other animes as it does not stick to the usual stereotypes. In fact, it goes in the complete opposite direction and what we get is an anti-harem comedy or bishounen anime, that is an extreme Japanese version of 'my fair lady' and 'queer eye'. Sound wierd? Well it is. Aside from being totally hysterical, this anime is often bizarre, creepy and just downright odd. All the women in this anime have the hots for the 4 boys, so expect nose bleeds a-plenty and lots of high pitched squealing. Just what you'd expect from the drector of Excel Saga

The animation is simply superb, and quite surreal at times, but if you are used to the style of Excel Saga and Puni Puni Poemy, you should feel right at home with this. Though I must admit that the wallflower is no where near as crazy and insane as them. This set contains both english dub and Japanese with subtitles. I have only watched the english dub and I must say that the voice acting is spot on, with some well known anime voice actors. ie Vic Mignogna (Full Metal Alchemist, Dragon ball Z Movies), Greg Ayres (Chrono Crusade Gantz), Chris Patton (Guyver bio boosted armour, Gantz). The music is pretty good as well with mixture of classical music and hard rock.

If you are a fan of Excel Saga, you will absolutely love this. And even newcomers will enjoy this. The Wallflower is pure nonsensical fun...and lots of it! ^^",1226880000,13,2565,4.733780760626399
