7793378,5,0901004456,"WOW what preaching on the glory fo God. This is the best Kenneth E. Hagin DVD sermon I have ever seen and boy oh boy does the Spirit get to moving. The sermon is wonderful, but what happens at the end is amazing. If you don't come up out of your chair you had better have somebody call the funeral home to come pick your body up because only a dead person would not be charged by this. After thinking about it I believe even a dead person might get up and shout. Folks its that good. It has been a long time since I have been in or seen a service like this one. How I would love to be in more of the same. We are in the last days and that makes me feel this type of preaching and moving of the Holy Spirit is coming back! What ever you do don't miss this message.",1414454400,,763,3.8354430379746836
