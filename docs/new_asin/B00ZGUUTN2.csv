7282940,5,B00ZGUUTN2,I always loved Lawman just hope the come out with the rest of the seasons.,1437436800,4,74,4.0
7282941,5,B00ZGUUTN2,Five stars for the show but 0 stars for the price. I absolutely love this show but they are asking too much money for it. What is it about these old westerns that they want to charge a fortune. It just doesn`t make sense. It`s a shame that such a wonderful show would be tarnished by such greed. They should hang they heads in shame and embarrassment.,1437264000,8,351,4.253731343283582
7282942,5,B00ZGUUTN2,"It has been a great time for the fans of classic tv westerns from the 1950s and early '60s the last few years.  It started with the release of the great 90 minute western ""Cimarron Strip"" starring Stuart Whitman about a year or two ago.  It continued with the release of ""The Dakotas,"" the sadly prematurely cancelled Warner Bros. western that was recently released and it will continue next month with the release of another of my favorites ""The Rebel"" starring the great Nick Adams.  ""Lawman"" released this week was a great Warner Bros. western from the 1959-1963.  Unlike most of the other Warner Bros. westerns it ran a half-hour and continued in the same time period during its entire four year run.
""Lawman"" which followed Warner. Bros. most famous tv western ""Maverick"" Sunday nights was different from the light-hearted ""Maverick"" in that it was played dead straight.  Similar in tone to ""Gunsmoke,"" it concerned the very serious Marshal Dan Troop played by John Russell and his young deputy Johnny McKay played by Peter Brown as they brought law and order to Laramie, Wyoming.  I had been hoping for the release of ""Lawman"" after the recent release of Warner Bros.  other terrific serious western ""The Dakotas"" and it seems like my hope was answered.  (Perhaps now Warner Bros. can start releasing some of their great detective shows from the late '50s and early '60s: ""77 Sunset Strip."" ""Hawaiian Eye,"" ""SurfSide 6,"" (my favorite) and ""Bourbon Street Beat."")
After ""Lawman"" John Russell guest-starred in various tv shows and was a fearsome villain in the Clint Eastwood western ""Pale Rider.""  Two years after ""Lawman"" Peter Brown was out west again as Texas Ranger Chad Cooper in the humorous western ""Laredo.""
As I stated previously, it has been a great period for fans of classic tv westerns being released on DVD.  But it has been a great period for fans of classic tv in general with the release of so many great tv shows on dvd in recent years, many of whom only lasted one year during their original release, shows like ""The Gallant Men,"" ""The Lieutenant,"" ""Search,"" ""Jericho,"" ""Stoney Burke,"" ""Wide Country,"" and the release of the first four years of ""Dr Kildare.""  The list of shows that I loved as a child and have been hoping to see on DVD is lessening and the release of the great ""Lawman"" continues that trend.",1436659200,22,2333,4.793017456359102
7282943,5,B00ZGUUTN2,"OF MANY TREMENDOUS WESTERN SERIES OF THE LATE FIFTIES AND EARLY SIXTIES, NONE WAS BETTER THAN ""LAWMAN.""

7282945,5,B00ZGUUTN2,"I have just received this today (it's actually been available for some weeks through an e-bay seller) and having watched the first few episodes it did not disappoint. Possibly my favourite of the Warner Bros Westerns when I was young, I'd forgotten it's only 25 minutes long but if anything this is a plus as some of the full length western episodes can occasionally drag a little. With a great lead actor in John Russell this is highly recommended. Roll on seasons 2-4.",1436140800,21,470,4.674698795180723

Crisp, clear vibrant B/W picture quality, grim tense gripping no-nonsense episodes, the pilot alone has 3 of my all time favorites as brothers, Edd Byrnes, Jack Elam and Lee Van Cleef, all ruggedly handsome in their own way.

7282952,2,B00ZGUUTN2,"I'm an avid movie western and western TV fan from back in the day. Lawman was never anywhere near the top of the TV Westerns of the 1950's. Not with Cheyenne, Gunsmoke, Wyatt Earp, Maverick, etc.

Two of the BIG problems is it is very poorly written, and so the stories suffer because of this main problem, and second, ""they never get off Warner's black lot"" whether in town or at the same ranch buildings seen over and over again. These two factors make it very boring even though John Russell more than fit the bill as Sheriff Dan Troop! The deputy does grow on you and come to hold his own in the series, but the stories just don't prop up the actors with any good writing or spoken lines!
So, Season 1 is enough for me, and it may be for you as well!  Good luck, and I hope someone else does enjoy this more than I did!",1475798400,,823,4.1375

7282975,5,B00ZGUUTN2,"I recently purchased the 2 DVD-R sets ""Lawman - Seasons 1 and 2"". As soon as I received them, I played them all the way through as I was concerned about the warning on the back of the packages that these DVD-Rs may not play on a DVD recorder, which happens to be the only device I have for playing DVDs: a Magnavox MDR161V DVD Recorder/VCR combo. I am happy to report that all the disks played without incident on my machine.

As a young teenager, I watched the Lawman TV series when it was first broadcast. I recalled its 2 main stars, John Russell and Peter Brown, and the theme song, but not much else. Perhaps that was because the series was never re-run on network TV. I wonder if it was thought to contain too much gun violence for the 1960s?

Recently, I've been interested in re-visiting a number of TV shows I vaguely recall seeing when I was a kid but haven't seen since, and Lawman was one of them. I was curious just how well the program would hold up, watching it 55 years after it first aired (the world and people's expectations have changed a lot since then) and through ""adult eyes and ears"".

All the episodes on DVD-R are in decent black-and-white video with excellent sound. And I can report that the series holds up very well indeed.

POSITIVE QUALITIES NOT EMPHASIZED IN OTHER CUSTOMER REVIEWS

(1) The effective use of background music. I'm not referring to the series' theme song, but to the music which is used tastefully, but sparingly, to express the emotions involved in a particular scene. This music is effective but never calls attention to itself.

(2) In some of the other customer reviews for this series, you'll find descriptions such as ""played dead straight"", ""no-nonsense"" and ""intense"", which hint at the most notable characteristic of this western: the program takes itself very seriously. If the episodes had been one hour long, this unrelieved intensity might have become almost unbearable. But in its half-hour format, the high tension works quite well in holding the viewer's attention. For those viewers looking for some comic relief in their westerns, you won't find much here. I would direct those viewers to ""Maverick"" or ""Laredo"". But if you prefer a high tension program with a serious tone, then you should enjoy ""Lawman"". The only TV western I can think of that is comparable to ""Lawman"" in this respect is ""The Texan"" starring Rory Calhoun which also maintained a serious tone. I suspect viewers who enjoy one of these programs will like the other one too.

I DO HAVE A FEW MINOR PET PEEVES REGARDING THE SHOW:

(1) Dan Troop's frequent addressing of his deputy, Johnny McKay, as ""Boy"". While that language might have been acceptable for Tarzan, I think it would have been considered derogatory even at the time ""Lawman"" was aired.

(2) Dan Troop's very distracting streak of white hair. According to a very informative wikipedia article on the Lawman TV series, ""Russell had white streaks added to his hair to make him appear older."" It doesn't look very natural to me.

(3) The much-too-frequent reliance on arguments between drunken saloon patrons as the main source of violence for the program, invariably ending in a fatal shooting.

(4)  Also, the over-reliance on the exaggerated and unconvincing macho egos of some characters, leading to the inevitable tragic consequences. The series' very first episode titled ""The Deputy"" is a good example of this. Edd (""Kookie"") Byrnes' performance as an egotistical young gunfighter trying to bait Marshall Troop into a gunfight is really ""over the top"".

(5) In the episode titled ""The Outsider"", there is a scene of ""unintended humor"" which I attribute to a thankfully-rare lapse by the screenwriter. Curiously, the opening teaser is the the only one I've noticed that is not repeated in the main body of the program. When the teaser begins, a shirtless man is being released from the ropes that were used to tie him up to an overhead beam inside a barn. The implication is that the man had just received a bullwhipping. His tormentors tell him he should have left town when he was first told to do so. The victim responds by arguing that he has wages coming to him. He's then told he'll be given a horse and 50 dollars when he leaves. Incredibly, the victim balks at the offer saying ""I like to earn my keep."" In that situation, I don't think I'd be argumentative and risk further application of the bullwhip!

(6) I noticed the episode titled ""The Press"" in Season 2 seems to be recorded at a much higher volume level than other episodes. I didn't check to see if any other episodes were also recorded at a higher-than-normal volume level.

(7) Only one episode, ""The Chef"", makes a (generally successful) attempt at comedy. In a few other episodes, the background music occasionally implies the spoken lines were intended to be funny, but generally those lines go over like a lead balloon. Comedy is, admittedly, not one of this series' strong points.

WARDROBE COMMENTS NOT MENTIONED BY OTHER REVIEWERS

(1) The frequent wearing of heavy jackets by the actors is quite realistic, considering the fact that Laramie was in the northern part of the country where the climate was often cold. I don't recall seeing jackets being worn all that frequently in other TV westerns from the 1950s and 1960s. (Perhaps they, understandably, didn't want to cover up the actors' masculine physiques!)

(2) Regarding John Russell's wardrobe, it seems virtually unchanged throughout the series, except for wearing a heavy jacket now and then. His light-colored outfit always seems to have just come from the cleaners without so much as a wrinkle in it, let alone a speck of dirt. And his hair never seems to get mussed up from wearing a hat.

(3) Regarding Peter Brown's wardrobe, he seems to wear the same corduroy shirt most of the time. (I guess most of his deputy's pay went toward financing those fancy haircuts!) However, there seems to have been some experimentation regarding the belt he wore. At the beginning of the series, he wore a 1 3/4"" wide black garrison belt. Starting with the episode titled ""The Posse"", he switched to a slightly narrower 1 3/8"" wide garrison belt. And beginning with the episode titled ""The Return"" (and thereafter), he wore his 1 3/8"" wide garrison belt with the buckle on his left hip. I recall the wearing of one's belt buckle to the side was a popular fad at the time this series aired. Apparently, that fad reached Laramie late in the first season.

SUMMATION

Although my negative remarks seem to have out-numbered the positive ones, they are all very minor flaws recalled with humor and much affection for a program I liked very much. None of those flaws should preclude one from enjoying the program.

Most of the series' many positive virtues have already been covered in sufficient detail by other reviewers, and I didn't want this review to be just a rehash of their reviews. The series managed to provide stories of some substance within the very restrictive confines of the half-hour format. I highly recommend this series.",1450915200,6,7061,4.784716516023007

7282978,5,B00ZGUUTN2,"I grew up watching LAWMAN and was glad they FINALLY decided to put it on DVD. (I stopped getting cable when they took Lawman reruns off the air in 2007 and haven't had cable since.)  Lawman was a half hour show, and one of the best Classic Westerns. John Russell plays Marshal Dan Troop and Peter Brown plays his deputy, Johnny McKay. (I was fortunate enough to meet Peter Brown several times at Western Legends Roundup - held every August in Kanab, Utah.) The stories are well written and the show still holds up very well today. The first season has LOTS of guest stars like Adam West, Jack Elam, Edd ""Kookie"" Byrnes, Lee Van Cleef, Deforest Kelley, James Drury, Robert Fuller, James Coburn and more. Definitely one of the BEST Classic Westerns. There are 5 discs in this set - 39 shows. Each disc lists the episodes (on that disc). There are NO subtitles and no extras.  Highly Recommend.",1449100800,8,891,4.5625
7282979,5,B00ZGUUTN2,"When I finally discovered this wonderful western series was being released to the public, I was overjoyed.  Truly.  I'm very pleased the purchase price was reduced to the current reasonable price which I found to difficult to avoid; happily.  In a past post I entreated Amazon to make this available, and when it was possible, they did.  Now I seek the price reductions for the subsequent seasons of this series, Cheyenne, and Have Gun Will Travel as well.  Make it so; and I'll share my appreciation monetarily.  Seriously, this series is an all time fave of mine and I'll be singing the theme song all weekend and beyond as I return to that wonderful time of right now from then as I view the episodes.",1448582400,2,704,4.592
7282980,4,B00ZGUUTN2,"I recall liking this series as a kid. I think it aired on Sunday nights following Maverick. Only a half hour show and the stories feel a little abrupt or compressed as result of that limitation. But the stories are interesting and acting and production values generally quite good though our main character comes off rather stiff, partly because of the way character is written, and I suspect, partly because of John Russell's limited acting range. I was a fan of Russell from his days with the earlier syndicated Soldiers of Fortune series.
Warner Brothers did a nice job with a number of western series back in late 50's and early 60's. I wouldn't count Lawman to be one of their best, which I would convey upon Cheyenne and Maverick, but it's a solid entry. I'm about half way through season one and I'd put it on a par with The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp and a notch above Bat Masterson, half hour TV westerns of about the same time frame. Some have said this was WB's answer to Gunsmoke, and indeed there are similarities, but in my view this was the superior entry as there was more action in this program. Gunsmoke, no doubt a quality entry, was always a bit too talky for my taste.  Quality of picture/sound I would judge to be first rate. Theme song was distinctive, as much spoken as sung. On balance a nice addition to my western collection and may well go for subsequent seasons.",1446163200,2,1394,4.488188976377953

7282983,5,B00ZGUUTN2,This TV western was a big winner for W.B.  All the stories were well written and filmed for TV audiences.  They had two great stars in John Russell and Peter Brown playing Dan Troop and Johnny McKay.  This was the best TV Western produced by W.B. only running for four seasons during TV westerns hay day.  This one begs to be owned by dedicated TV DVD collectors.,1444953600,3,363,4.373134328358209
7282984,4,B00ZGUUTN2,"Starring John Russell as Marshal Dan Troop and Peter Brown as his deputy Johnny MacKay, this half-hour western from the late 1950's was shot in black and white by Warner Brothers. The same studio that brought you ""Cheyenne"",""Maverick"",""Bronco"". So you know you are getting a quality production. It tells the stories of a marshal who keeps law and order in Laramie,Wyoming.
Guest stars  in the first season include, James Drury and Doug McClure from ""The Virginian"". Robert Fuller from""Laramie"" and Pernell Roberts from ""Bonanza"" to name a few stars before  they became famous in their own series.
This is a solid western series with a pretty good theme song.
As of this writing the first two seasons have been released on DVD.",1444521600,4,726,4.942622950819672

7282989,4,B00ZGUUTN2,I have not seen this series on TV since the early 1960's. The black and white quality is very good and the stories and acting is of a very high standard. The only negative if there is one is that the episodes are too short (only 30 minutes).,1442793600,,241,4.041666666666667

7282998,5,B00ZGUUTN2,"As good as I remember from watching on TV so many years ago (too many to think about). Well made and acted. John Russell made the perfect Lawman. Unbending, but sympathetic  when needed. Peter Brown as his eager Deputy. The list of supporting actors was great. All the expected bad guys of the day. A real treat for Western fans - and the saying is true - they do not make them like that any longer.

Well produced DVDs with just the occasional wobble here and there (found that the same on THE DAKOTAS), but considering how old the originals were a superb transfer. Sound perfect.

Warner  Bros is to be congratulated for deciding to release these fine Western series. Not before time. So good to welcome them back.",1441065600,3,716,4.5271317829457365

7283001,5,B00ZGUUTN2,"As kid, here in Australia my parents, made me and my siblings go to bed as the Lawman theme blared from the television.  However, I did manage on rare occasions to watch some episodes.  Well, as a grown up I can stay up well beyond 8.30 pm, and watch all the television I want when I want.  I think the Lawman, for its era, held its own against the plethora of western tv shows of the time as providing fresh stories.  John Russell's strong portrayal as a stern, no nonsense lawman and Peter Brown's apprentice deputy role, made the show different to most others, and probably explains why I still remember the show to this day.  Having watch the first season I highly recommend it to those who like this type of nostalgic television.",1439942400,4,734,4.447761194029851
