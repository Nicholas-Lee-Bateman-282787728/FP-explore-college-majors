Imagine a teen movie without the ""Blood & Guts"" and ""hormone sex scenes"" but a real light story that will keep your  attention and make you laugh.

307332,4,6301008944,"Is it just me or were comedies funnier in the 80s? Adventures In Babysitting was by no means raunchy, it doesn't even compare to the films of today in that respect, but in someways there just seem to be a lot more laughs in these classic 80s comedies. For those who don't know the story, Chris (Elizabeth Shue) passes up a night with her boyfriend to babysit for two kids. It was the right choice, but when her best friend is left stranded and in trouble, Chris is forced to take the kids into Chicago to go and rescue her. What awaits her there is an adventure she never saw coming, with everything from gangsters to car trouble and perhaps even a new romantic interest? This film was supposed to be the one that made Karate Kid alum, Elizabeth Shue, a big star, but despite the films success and eventual cult status, it never happened. It's hard to understand why that is. I think it has a lot to do with her virtually disappearing for three years after this film, only to re-appear for a bit part in Back To The Future. Had she ridden the wave of success from this performance, she would have been one of the late 80s biggest names. Shue was fantastic, tough when she needed to be, caring when she wanted to be, and of course she always had the right line on the tip of her tongue. Add to the mix two obnoxious young teens and a tough as nails young tomboy and you have a mixture for success. Lest we forget this was a Christopher Columbus film, so we also have all those oddballs and crazy dumb criminals we know and love thrown in there too. Adventures In Babysitting was almost like a trial run for Home Alone, three years later. While the film certainly had it's share of flaws, and would not be rated PG-13 by today's standards, it was a largely enjoyable family film and in many ways a distant cousin to Home Alone. I loved this film when I was a kid and I appreciate it even more now, Adventures In Babysitting is highly recommended fun for the whole family!",1517356800,,1969,4.324324324324325

307506,5,6301008944,"First watched this movie on ABC family I think, and I thought I would give it try. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. Such an adventure, comical, action-packed, and just a fun movie. Elisabeth Shue plays (Kris) the fun, sensible, and mature babysitter just trying to keep the kids alive in this action adventure while trying to pick up her friend. Each time, they run into strangers good and bad. I'm glad I bought it because it's a feel-good, adventure, comedy. Speaking of comical, is it just me or do the brother and sister and the friend Darrell remind you and look like Hermione Granger, Harry Potter w/o the glasses, and Ron Weasley from the books and movies. I noticed right away the looks, and the hair color I thought the resemblance was uncanny! Overall, the characters, story, and the different stars throughout the movie was great! What a adventure and the parents didn't even know!  Love this 80's babysitting movie, let's face it babysitting is an adventure.",1488672000,,973,4.757396449704142

They said no that can not be true our son said that he dared me to find the original one to watch.  Well I had a good idea that it was on Amazon so I did a search, and well it was.

308259,5,6301008944,"Adventures in Babysitting is a vintage 80s classic of a movie, directed by Chris Columbus and starring Elisabeth Shue as the titular Babysitter. This film feels very much a product of its time, with a strong female lead overcoming obstacles with only occasional material assistance from men (many of those obstacles ARE men, sometimes the very men who are purporting to help her), suburbanites venturing into the big city on a mission (the city is in this case Chicago), and a plot that turns in almost every case on the unexpected benevolence of strangers assumed to be threatening. Seeking 80s teenage nostalgia? Look no further.

This film includes appearances by Albert Collins, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Bradley Cooper.",1436745600,,721,5.162393162393163

This movie is a goofy 2 hours of fun. Elizabeth Shue is charming (and beautiful) as a babysitter who makes a very bad decision to take the kids she's watching to the train station to help a friend (Penelope Ann Miller). Lots of crazy and amusing things happen on the way, including karaoke at a blues bar, encounters with a car thief ring, and a knife fight in a subway car.

But for the rest of us it is a very funny and sometimes hilarious flick that is a lot of fun.  This was a real gem for Elisabeth Shue, a lot of actresses were considered for the role, but she really made the best of it and it really put her on the map.  A babysitter, whose boyfriend just pulled out of their date, agrees to babysit a young girl.  Her fifteen year old brother is madly in love with her.  When her best friend, Penelope Ann Miller, is stranded at a bus station in the city she reluctantly agrees to come and pick her up.  With the young girl, her brother and the brother's lewd friend, the four set out on a wild and crazy night that gets even wilder as the night moves on.  One adventure after another until they are fleeing from criminals out to kill them.  It is funny now with all the Thor and Avengers movies out, that the little girl is obsessed with her hero Thor.  This is a fun and entertaining movie and well worth the watch.",1429056000,3,1037,4.218274111675127

TEEN WOLF; THE LAST STARFIGHTER; and this one, popped up. I already have ' Starfighter, so, I
bought the other two.
Elisabeth Shue is a VERY capable actress, and helps to keep your interest start to finish.

308983,4,6301008944,"Way before she grabbed an Oscar nomination for her searing performance as a world-weary prostitute in Leaving Las Vegas, Elisabeth Shue was known as one of the squeaky-clean actresses of the '80s.

Having made a smash in ""The Karate Kid"" and the '60s-nostalgia TV series ""Call to Glory"", Shue cemented her good-girl reputation with the charming but badly titled Adventures in Babysitting.

Set in the John Hughes-style suburbs of Chicago, the titular adventures follow babysitter Chris (Elisabeth Shue), who agrees to watch the Anderson kids (Keith Coogan and Maia Brewton) when her boyfriend cancels their anniversary date.

All is quiet on the home front until Chris is called upon to rescue her best friend (Penelope Ann Miller, also doing good-girl duty) from the seedy downtown bus station. She can't leave the kids, and she can't leave her friend alone in the big bad city, so she packs everyone in the station wagon and heads into Chicago.

Screwball craziness begins as they encounter car thieves, knife-wielding gangs, gun-toting truck drivers, and, worst of all, Chris's duplicitous boyfriend. It's hardly mature entertainment, but Shue makes it work; when she wins over the audience at a blues club with her improv singing, you'll be won over, too.

In his directorial debut, Chris Columbus (who later went on to helm the sap-fests Mrs. Doubtfire and Home Alone) gently skewers the suburbia white-bread mindset of the main characters, and plays up the comedy over the schmaltz with a subtlety of which he now seems incapable; the near romance between Shue and Coogan is played lightly and adorably.

Look for brief appearances by art-house faves Lolita Davidovich as a college party girl and Vincent D'Onofrio as an unlikely savior.

The girl's friend runs away to downtown Chicago but gets has second thoughts when she's stuck in a bus station with some crazy people.

cover of Rolling Stone. This is her Times Square billboard.

There is no Machio here, stealing her thunder. She IS Machio, and Miyagi and blonde mullet guy. She
is everything to everyone in this film; this is her crowning achievement. Put away Crossfire, pop some
Jiffy-Pop on the stove, slip into your B.U.M. crewneck and let her enrich your life, one babed-out smile
at a time.

Her classic babliness plays second fiddle to no one here. Watch in awe as she manhandles a wood-paneled
station wagon and bosses around ""dishes are done man!"" guy from Don't Tell Mom the Babysitters Dead.
Everything about this movie feels like your best friends house during a sleepover in 1989, but instead of his
dorky mom checking in on you while you play Duck Hunt, it's Elisabeth Shue, and she is wearing an oversized
sweater and being fantastic.

It's a movie I can watch with them that doesn't get tedious like so many kids movies do. There is some language in it, but it's nothing overly bad. The movie has a well-thought out plot from beginning to end. Is it ingenious or deep? No, but they manage to connect things, bringing things full-circle. Good performances all around. Great music. My only complaint ... there's no official soundtrack.

I overlook its flaws, that the movie is dated in certain ways.  Not a ""great"" movie you'll be discussing in your history of American cinema course, just a really really fun one.

Yes there are ""pause button moments"" if you watch it with kids - one child insults another child's favorite superhero by calling him a ""homo"" and no one in the movie objects to that kind of insult. It's amazing to think that only back in 1987, not that long ago, people talked this way.  But the movie is rated PG-13 so with older kids, it's an opportunity to discuss how rapidly and in such a positive direction the world has changed.  And really that moment is not essential to the movie.

In the bigger picture, during the course of their adventures the characters let go of some prejudices they had at the beginning of the evening, and learn to see people as individuals rather than stereotypes.",1387152000,,1022,4.438502673796791

This film is one of those, good clean humour and it still manages to create that edge of excitement - and at times, fear. A young Elizabeth Shue really shines in this film; the plot is a little 'convenient', i.e. there is no real reason to leave the house, but a friend of the babysitter's is in real trouble! It's a great ride, lots of funny characters, and by the end you feel like you've been on the ride with them, rather than just watching it.

If you have young kids around 10, show them this one so they know what real humour is. It's also funny just to observe the differences in fashion and music etc. Great film",1375488000,,712,4.274074074074074
309260,1,6301008944,"First let me say that this review is NOT about the movie itself.  This review is about the ""25th Anniversary Edition"" Blu-ray of the movie.  The movie is a classic.  I've owned it on DVD for several years and have gotten much use out of it.  I was excited to see it was released on Blu-ray, and since I recently upgraded to an HDTV, I was excited to see how it looked on the ""big screen.""

I'll save you the time of having to read my entire review.  In a word, do NOT buy the Blu-ray of this movie.  You'll be better off getting the DVD version and having it upscaled by your player for your HDTV.

I don't know WHAT they did to it, but it is a HORRIBLE transfer.  The only one that is worse than this from what I have seen in my experience, is the original 1970's Gone in 60 Seconds movie.  On that one, I expected very little in the way of a remastered transfer due to it being an old movie produced by a self-funded studio, and that's exactly what I got.  I was happy with it, because I wasn't expecting much.

However, for this ""Anniversary Edition"" (and I lade that phrase with as much sarcasm and disappointment as this keyboard will allow me to slather over those words), I expected something that had been crafted with love and attention.  You know, something that would merit the phrase ""Anniversary Edition.""  But no.  Instead they decide to bilk us out of more money (see ""double-dipping""), and present us with this steaming pile of donkey dung pressed into disc form.  I am a fan of non-DNR'd transfers.  I don't think that the original film grain should be destroyed.  However, whatever they did to this tranfer, they not only kept the grain but ENHANCED it tenfold!  I couldn't even finish the movie.  I got about 5 minutes in and had to turn it off.  I guess their idea of a transfer is to update the fonts on the titles to make the vectors match HD standards.  That was about the only thing that I saw that benefitted from the upscaling.

Save your money and buy a DVD version instead.  You'll be better off, and will appreciate the movie more.",1375315200,8,2060,4.332460732984293

309294,3,6301008944,"I'm going to question this being a ""family"" movie.  I know with rating movies G,PG,PG-13,R, there are certain standards that cannot be crossed, for instance, PG-13 movies are allowed one use of the F word. Well, than this would have to fall into the ""R"" category.  I know, anyone who has watched this movie will say that this comment is stupid, but please hear me out.  Since becoming a father, I've become more conscious of words and actions of what I watch and what I do, personally, I like this movie, I thought it was a funny movie and good for a few laughs with enough suspense to keep kids entertained.  When this movie came out, I was 7 or 8 years old, I didn't find out about it until a friend of mine told me about it and my mom and I went out and rented it, I was probably 10 when this happened. I had much more leeway with show's and movies than I allow now for my child.  This movie has at least 2 things that I don't want my daughter asking or hearing or seeing.
First one:  The Playboy magazine.  I know they don't show much of anything but still, it isn't something that I want my 6 year old seeing and asking what is that, why is she dressed like that?
Second:  I can quote this, on the subway, the street gang ""Lords of Hell"" if I remember right, when they confronted Elizabeth Shue's character and the kids, and the love struck teenager tries to man up to them, a knife gets taken out and snapped into the kids foot.  Then followed up by, ""Don't F*** with the Lords of Hell!"" Elizabeth Shue pulls out the knife and holds it to the gang leaders face and says, ""Don't F*** with the babysitter!""  Now, 2 F words, and this is in the family movie category? I need to say I don't think this should be.  Whatever any parents decides, that's your prerogative, I myself, really want to keep my kid away from the f words as long as I can.  I started saying it in 4th grade, and it became a regular word for me in high school every where but home, once I graduated until I had my daughter, it was apart of most sentences when talking to friends or family.  Anyway, that's my two cents....",1372636800,20,2095,4.194513715710723

All the kids deserve kudos because even know I found myself cracking up and seeing what a great job they all did. Totally pleasurable and if I had kids I'd totally make them watch this film. Who cares if they cuss? They're gonna hear it somewhere. I watched this when I was just a kid and I grew up totally fine. (I think.....),1363564800,,590,4.184210526315789

309621,4,6301008944,"Adventures in Babysitting is one of those movies that all of the kids back in the day saw apart from me. No particular reason, I just never got around to it. With the new Blu-ray I figured now would be right time to catch up on what I missed.

It's not a John Hughes movie, but it does have a similar aesthetic and is set in a cold, snowy Chicago (a common Hughes theme), and it's the director debut of Chris Columbus who worked with Hughes on the first two Home Alone movies. Babysitting is quite similar in that is has a bunch of kids/teens getting into all kinds of hi-jinks while evading and outsmarting crooked grown-ups.

Elizabeth Shue plays Chris Parker (no relation to Jennifer Parker from BTTF) a girl who has been stood-up by her sleazeball boyfriend and ends up babysitting for a wealthy couple while they go hob-nobbing in the city. Though content to sit in the house all night she gets a frantic call from her friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) who is trapped in an inner city bus station and needs rescued. Multiple detours and deviations make the rescue no easy task. I guess in this sense the movie feels a little bit like Planes, Trains and Automobiles.

It's all inoffensive and good-natured, though I was surprised to hear a couple of F-bombs in there, and some of the dialogue is a little raunchy. Babysitting is no classic, but has lasting appeal and is a fun ride. Michael Kamen also provides a score which sounds like a Die Hard prototype, lending a little more weight to the adventure than would be typical. Stay watching until after the credits for an extra scene.

The Blu-ray presents the movie in 1.85:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound, both are pretty good considering the age and budget limitations of the $7 million production. Disney have some nerve calling this a '25th Anniversary Edition' though, it contains absolutely no extras whatsoever apart from a couple of brief, upfront clips of Paranorman and Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

309623,4,6301008944,"I watched this moving growing up and always enjoyed it. It is defiantly dated being from the late 80's but it is still a very enjoyable movie. The basic storyline is a girl (17 years old) gets called to baby-sit and has a friend who decided to runaway from home and now needs to be rescued. So she packs up the kids she is babysitting and off to the city they go. On the way they get a flat tire and it just goes on from there, from being in a car that is stolen, having to sing the blues as they run from the bad guys and so on until they have to race back home before the parents get there.

There are many other instances with four-letter words; I won't list them all.

I was disappointed in the video quality of this Blu-Ray.  It is just not sharp, and has some fine grain in many of the scenes.  It is not as bad as some Blu-Rays I've seen, and I don't see it as a rip-off, but I think they could have, and should have, put more effort in getting a higher quality video presentation of this movie.
There have been some Blu-Rays, like the first ""Total Recall"" edition, and ""First Blood"", that were so bad that I thought I should have been able to get my money back.  I did not feel that way about this Blu-Ray.  Granted, the video quality is not great with this Blu-Ray, but I would still call it good, and not unpleasant to watch.

The 5.1 audio was okay, but there just wasn't noticable surround sound. Almost all the sound came from the front and center speakers.  I don't remember hearing any sub-woofer bass.  But, I had no problems with the sound mix - I had no trouble hearing the voices, and didn't think the background music was too loud.  I didn't think they put much effort into the sound, but I thought it was satisfactory.",1345334400,10,1283,4.431623931623932

309719,5,6301008944,"I eagerly anticipated the Blu-ray release date of one of my all time favorite movies, Adventures in Babysitting.  I just finished watching it and felt compelled to see if others had left feedback on Amazon.  It turns out, they had and I couldn't agree more with what's being said.  My copy of the Blu-ray disc is really grainy (picture the vintage white noise on your screen) and the audio is sub-par at best.  I find myself turning it up to hear the dialog and turning it down because the music is too loud.  The rest of my Blu-ray and DVDs don't have this problem.

About the picture.  I don't speak geek but I can tell you that there a some spots that are definitely worse than others.  Some are just downright awful.  Not at all what I expected.  Yes, this movie is 25 years old, but I've seen movies this old, and even older, transfer to Blu-ray better than this.  I have both the DVD and Blu-ray and I think I will reach for the DVD version going forward.  This disc is just disappointing all the way around.  No extras, plain blue disc with no real graphics or anything on it-just writing.  And I agree with another reviewer that something labeled ""25th Anniversary Edition"" warrants SOME kind of special treatment.  Interviews, commentary, trailers, behind the scenes footage, SOMETHING.  This disc has NOTHING.

I guess I should have realized that with such a low price point (to start), I wasn't going to get much.  I did, however, expect a decent picture and great sound, of which I got neither.

5 stars for the movie, 0 stars for the Blu-ray",1344470400,5,1554,4.525179856115108
309720,5,6301008944,"Adventures in Babysitting is one of the best 80's comedies, no arguments there. Elisabeth Shue delivers a truly enjoyable & infectious performance while also looking gorgeous throughout. I honestly don't know if she's ever been prettier than she was in this film. Chris Columbus'  direction is very energetic and well done and the script by David Simkins is smart and just self aware enough at appropriate points. The rest of the cast is also a great deal of fun. If you for some reason haven't seen this particular film, what are you waiting for?

My main purpose for this review is the new so called ""25th Anniversary Edition"" blu ray that highly disappoints. First of all, THE BLU RAY IS BARE BONES! How can something be labled a special edition of some sort and then have no extras whatsoever?! The film is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 in hi-definition anamorphic widescreen. While it does look better than the ancient DVD, the movie has a really washed out look to it for the most part and detail doesn't seem to pop at all like it could and should. I would say that the visual improvement is marginal at best most of the time. There are some moments here and there where it does feel that you're watching high definition. The movie maintains a high bit rate throughout but it's very apparent that Disney took whatever hi-def master they had laying around and just slapped it on the disc. If you don't own the old DVD, then this is the best way to see the film. But the complete lack of extras is absolutely criminal. If they were going to go that route than they shouldn't have put ""25th anniversary edition"" on the front of the case. I would have loved a Chris Columbus & Elisabeth Shue commentary track at least. The audio is in lossless 5.1 surround.

So a resounding yay for this classic bit of 80's comedy and a big nay for the blu-ray!",1344384000,,1878,4.550295857988166

I'm sending it back, hoping that I received a bad copy.  If not, I'm surprised that Disney (Touchstone) would release such a inferior product.  Even the audio was not up to Blu-ray quality.  On my surround sound 5.1 system, the video only played in stereo.  In addition, there are no ""extras"" at all.

309722,5,6301008944,"One disaster follows another in ""Adventures in Babysitting"" when the eponymous heroine discovers that the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. This hilarious comedy about a babysitter who finds herself and her brood up to their collective necks in trouble as they try to flee from a gang of desperate Chicago criminals is worth watching more than once. Future ""Harry Potter"" director Chris Columbus made his directorial debut with this roller-coaster 99-minute opus that never wears out its welcome. Similarly, Shue has her first starring role as the babysitter, and the role fits her as snugly as a shoe. Not only is Shue sympathetic but she is also charismatic. Meanwhile, Columbus stages several exciting scenes in this Touchstone Films release that will have you perched on the edge of your seat. ""Adventures in Babysitting"" was one of the first major theatrical films to conclude its end credits with a scene related to the action.

Everything starts innocently enough as our heroine, 17-year old Chris Parker (Elizabeth Shue of ""Molly""), is waiting on her dream date and singing the song ""And Then He Kissed Me."" Chris worships the ground that her narcissistic boyfriend treads; the tag on the front of his Camaro reads: ""So Cool."" Nevertheless, she is crushed when Mike Todwell (Bradley Whitford) arrives and informs her that he has to cancel their date. According to Mike, he must stay at home with his sick sister. Reluctantly, Chris agrees to babysit a neighbor's children. Chris' best friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) decides to run away from home and winds up trapped in a bus stop where homeless people terrorize her. Somebody steals Brenda's glasses, and she is absolutely destitute. She calls Chris from a pay phone and pleads with Chris to rescue her. Naturally, the Anderson kids that Chris is sitting, 15-year-old Brad (Keith Coogan of ""Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead"") and 8-year-old Sara (Maia Brewton of ""Back to the Future""), are game for a road trip from their Oak Park suburbs into Chicago. Chris takes her mom's station wagon. Brad's best friend Daryl Coopersmith (Anthony Rapp), who has a crush on Chris, manages to persuade them to let him ride with them. No sooner do our heroes get into Chicago than they blow a tire. To make matters worse, Chris doesn't have a dime and they rely on the kindness of strangers, specifically ""Handsome"" John Pruitt (John Ford Noonan) who drives a wrecker with one hand. The kids freak out when they see his metal clipper of a fist. They also freak out when they look into the glove compartment and find a gun. Pruitt tells Chris that he will change her flat tire for free. On the way to Dawson's Garage, Pruitt receives a call on his CB about his wanton wife and cruises past his residence. Indeed, Pruitt discovers that his wife is cheating on him.

While Pruitt storms the house, Chris and company leap into another car. They catch an African-American thief, Joe Gipp (Calvin Levels), as he is boosting the Cadillac. The villains lock the kids up for safekeeping in an upstairs room while they continue to plot their future crimes. When Daryl joined our heroes originally, he had a Playboy magazine with a centerfold layout that is the spitting image of Chris. The Playboy belonged to Daryl's father and he lost it. Miraculously, Daryl finds the same magazine and takes it. The catch is that the Playboy magazine that Daryl takes contains secret information about a car-hijacking schedule. Before the rollicking evening concludes, Chris and her charges wind up in a skyscraper where--as it turns--Sara's parents are attending a party.

One of the funniest scenes shows Chris and the kids being pursued by bad guys after they escape from their garage. They get away by climbing into the rafters. Chris, Brad, Sarah, Daryl walk softly along I-beams as they pass over the villains as the bad guys have a heated discussion. Our heroes escape through a hole in the roof and the criminals spend the remainder of the film chasing them. This has got to be one of the most suspenseful scenes in the entire film. Later, our heroine and company duck into the nearest door, only to find themselves on stage at a blues music club called The Silver Dollar Room. According to the well-known blues musician Albert Collins, they must sing a blues song. The improvisation ranks as one of the highlights of the narrative.

309724,4,6301008944,"This is a little hidden gem of a movie.  It starts with a wonderful opening scene of Elisabeth Shue's character dancing  in her bedroom to the Crystals' ""Then He Kissed Me"" as she dresses for her date.  Very memorable, very romantic, and so well done that you almost feel guilty for peeping into a young girl's boudoir!  There is no nudity in this scene or at any other point in the movie, BTW.  Elisabeth is the ultimate Girl Next Door, winsome, funny, and very beautiful, and she carries the movie very well.  Without giving too much of the plot away, the ""adventures"" of the title are as a whole quite hilarious.  The situations that the cast finds themselves in are all over-the-top and often ridiculous, but in a very amusing way.  Along the way, look for a great turn by a young Vincent D'Onofrio, long before his 'Criminal Intent' role, and almost unrecognizable.  The supporting cast of child actors are all very well cast, and help to add to the general humorous, warm tone that the movie sets.  Penelope Ann Miller, a wonderful actress, is cast in a rather one-dimensional role as Elisabeth's friend in trouble, but she is VERY funny in it, and, in keeping with the general tone of the movie, hilariously over the top.  See her in 'Awakenings' for a much better showcase for her talents.  There are some memorable secondary characters along the way as well.  All in all, a very funny, warm flick, suitable for family night or even as a date movie, and one with good replay value, as the cast is so likable and funny, and the situations they find themselves in so outrageously funny.  The only real caveat is that for no good reason in a family movie, some bad language is used here and there, so if you are thinking of watching this with small children, you might want to screen it first.",1342656000,,1798,4.543478260869565

The children being babysat, the babysitter, the babysitter's lost and confused friend, the borderline criminal kid with the heart of gold, the grumpy auto mechanic, and everyone else in this adventure is treated with respect.

Yes, it is true we don't have to watch these letterboxed movies in postage stamp mode on our big screen by going into the DVD player setup, telling it we have a 4:3 screen and then using the resize button on the TV remote to scale it up to the screen. However, quality is lost. It's not a whole lot better than watching the VHS copy through our upscaling JVC VHS player. I suppose it will only be a short time now before Buena Vista releases a ""Collector's"" or ""Special"" edition DVD of this movie with a real widescreen version -- what we thought we were buying this go-around. Selling a letterboxed movie in a package that doesn't say so is unforgiveable. Fortunately for Amazon shoppers, the on-line product description now states ""letterboxed"".

310000,5,6301008944,"This crowd-pleasing little comedy almost came out of nowhere in the late 80's. With a title which leaves nothing to the imagination, we get to see Elizabeth Shue back when she was playing ""good girl"" characters..and before she got an Oscar nod for ""Leaving Las Vegas"". As the 17-year old Chris--who has her ""dream dinner date"" blown to smithereens (she gets even for that later on) & resigns herself to a ""dull"" evening of babysitting--Shue is completely credible & likable here as a white suburban teenager thrust through circumstance into the dangers of big city Chicago (a favorite locale of John Hughes'), complete with subway gangs, car thieves, and narrow escapes.
Chris' friend Brenda calls desperately from the downtown bus terminal as she has run away from home, but is stranded. Thus begins a crazy  adventure as Chris must take her three charges with her--lovelorn Brad, Thor-idolizing Sara, and Brad's annoying friend Darryl--and weave in & out of each ludricous moment, while trying to get home before the parents do.
Fledgling director Chris Columbus guides the film deftly through a harrowing comedy maze. There is a subtlety here--particularly in the delicate ""can-never-happen"" romance between Chris & Brad--that Columbus achieves that makes his bigger success of ""Home Alone"" seem syrupy in comparison. One of the highlights--when the kids stumble into a blues bar while trying to escape the bad guys & have to sing the blues--could have easily been far-fetched. Instead, it's charmingly fun to watch. Slightly over 90 minutes long, it's amazing how many twists & turns happen in this movie.

This is the only movie I've ever watched in my entire life that I actually loved.  I tried to watch movies and appreciate them, but I never could enjoy them.  I don't even try anymore to watch movies.  I've accepted the fact that I am not a movie watcher, but a book reader instead.  However, of all the movies I've tried to watch, this is the only movie I love.  I will not review any of the other movies I've watched (or tried to watch - I don't comprehend movies) because it wouldn't be fair to give those movies 1-star reviews just because I couldn't get into them.

This is a fun and cozy movie.  Because I love it so much, I've watched it several times.  I've also read the book, and I also have a review for that, also.  This is a movie I can actually enjoy, cuddled up on the couch on a Friday night.  (Most Friday nights I am reading a book.)

Just a quick trip to the bus station to get Brenda, and then back home with the kids. . .  Of course, the kids have to come, because they can't stay home alone.  Therefore, Chris and the kids come to the bus station. . .  or try to come to the bus station. . .

A tire blows on the freeway. . .  What a horrible time for a tire to blow when you have a carload full of kids. . .  How will Chris get another tire?

While trying to get another tire, she and the kids have one adventure after another.  I will not tell you what they are, but they are fun.  You never knew getting a tire was that adventurous. . .  I can't say more, because I don't want to ruin the movie.

But the main question is:  Will Chris get the tire, get Brenda picked up, and get home before the parents know that she was out on the town with the kids?

I enjoyed the French restaurant scene; Joe was an awesome character; I enjoyed the campus scene; the bus-riding scene was fun.  The hospital scene was really fun.  Gosh, the whole thing was fun, awesome, and cozy.  That's coming from someone who hates movies - from someone whose brain doesn't even comprehend movies!  (But I did enjoy the book even more.)

This movie is really awesome, and if you are like me and can't/don't watch movies, I think this movie is one you would enjoy; but thank goodness there is a book out and that would be even better for people like me.

Highly recommended (at least for people like me).  I get to have a ""cozy, adventurous night on the town"" without leaving my couch.",1242604800,,2790,4.109461966604823

310074,4,6301008944,"Chris (Elizabeth Shue) has a hot date with her boyfriend Mike and is dancing away to `And Then He Kissed Me' when Mike rings the doorbell. To her surprised, he cancels the date so he can stay home with his sick sister since his parents are not home. Of course Chris is upset, but there is always next week. After a little sulking with her friend Brenda, she gets a call to hopefully have her babysit someone she knows, Sara Anderson. Sara's brother, Brad, has a huge crush on her even though he's a couple years younger. So instead of going to his friend's house like planned he decides to stay over. This of course leads to the friend, Daryl, to come over also. And of course he's `that friend' that makes you just *sigh* cause of the some of the things he says or does.

Right after the parents leave, Chris gets a call from her friend Brenda pleading for her to come rescue her from the bus station, which apparently must be in hell due to the very strange people there. Chris decides to help her out and has to bring the kids along due to them ratting her out if she doesn't. And that is when the title of the movie begins to go into play. It all starts with one flat tire and a man with a hook.

I'll tell ya what, this movie is still pretty funny and still fun to watch after almost 22 years. It is still a charmingly fun movie, and a lot of fun to watch. I honestly thought after having not seen it for quite some time, that maybe it wasn't going to be as a good as I remembered. Wrong. It really was a lot of fun. Sure some parts weren't as great or funny as I remember, but they were still good and kind of funny or silly. Like the blues singing scene. I remember that being really cool when I first saw it (loooong time ago), but this time it was still funny and good, but just not all that like last time. I loved the beginning where Brad is all excited about Chris being at the house and then his mom or his sister totally embarrassing him by saying `Stop fawning over her' or `don't eat chocolate cause it doesn't help your acne'. Seriously my mom did that to me once in front of a girl I had a huge crush on and I felt that guys pain right on the spot...haha. And all the 80's stuff that's just genuine 80's stuff was so cool to see again. Like an older Burger King logo and Sara's backpack. Her backpack had Gizmo on it. Seriously... I want that backpack! And holy cow, the two gangs in the train were hilarious! It was like a bad `Beat It' video. Seriously Michael Jackson could have just popped out right there and started singing. They also reminded me of the `hot cops' from Arrested Development. Remember the episode where George Michael Jr. buys weed for his uncle? Hilarious.

In the end, great movie. If you love some 80's movies, then you'll want to own this. I guess I can only think of one bad thing and that's for the parents trying to show their kids some of the `older' movies from the 80s and that is that this movie does have a little bit of cussing. I believed they used the `f' bomb twice.

P.S. - A guy that looks like Thor in this movie is played by Vincent D'Onofrio. It was pretty funny to see him in pretty good shape considering what he usually looks like in his roles.",1236556800,2,3208,4.169354838709677

310076,4,6301008944,"I firmly believe that Elisabeth Shue needs more work.  I mean, really; this girl should have a huge career right now and yet I find that half the known world doesn't even know who she is.  Her film choices scatter from inspiring to forgettable to just plain bad and I wonder just what she has to do to recapture the brilliance she showed us in 1995 when she nabbed an Oscar nomination for her staggering portrayal of a kind hearted streetwalker in `Leaving Las Vegas'.  Well, for those of us who love Shue, this little 80's classic is a surefire hit you will want to watch again and again.

Cute, funny and sweet, `Adventures in Babysitting' is not mature fare, but it is nothing short of entertaining.

Shue plays Chris Parker, a teenage girl smitten with her rocking boyfriend Mike.  She's more than ready for her big date (and that big kiss) when Mike blows her off last minute with some lame excuse (yeah, I said lame).  With nothing to do she accepts a job babysitting the Anderson kids for the night.  Young Sara is obsessed with Thor and Brad is, well, he's obsessed with Chris.  When Chris's best friend Brenda calls up in desperate need of some help Chris finds herself packing the kids (as well as Brad's friend Daryl) into her station wagon and venturing deep into the heart of Chicago.

Like I said, the film isn't that smart, but it sure is a lot of fun.

There are some truly funny and memorable sequences; from a brawl on the subway to being carjacked and even an improv sing-song; that will have you laughing and keep you interested.

Elizabeth Shue has this genuine charm that reeks here, and even in her meatier and less `fluffy' films she still manages to draw us in with the purity of her spirit.  Here she has that in spades, and that is one reason why this movie works despite its flaws.  Both of the Anderson kids, played by Maia Brewton and Keith Coogan, are well represented; and the script nicely plays the budding (or is it) romance between Coogan and Shue.  There is nothing overly schmaltzy or saccharine about this movie.  It all has a very nonchalant character to it.  It never takes itself too seriously and so it never tries to hard to convert us or move us, and that plays to its benefit.

With nice little turns from a very young Vincent D'Onofrio and a very funny Penelope Ann Miller (""Chris I'm begging you, it's really scary here. I've just seen three people shoot up, a bald Chinese lady with no pants on, and there's this old guy outside who wants his bedroom slippers!""), this is a film that will make you laugh, make you smile and make you just plain happy you have a working DVD player.",1235520000,,2629,4.464435146443515

310079,4,6301008944,"Elizabeth Shue has been hanging out on my pedestal ever since this movie rocked the theaters way back in 1987. And with mad respect to her Oscar-nominated part in LEAVING LAS VEGAS, it's Chris Parker, the Chicagoan babysitter, who leaves me with the indelible impression. Dunno how many times I paid (*cough*snucked in) to see ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING in the theaters, but, just like Brad, that acne-harried Anderson kid, my high school crush on Elizabeth Shue was fierce and strong and kinda pathetic.

Things begin to veer towards suckville for suburban high school senior Chris Parker when her boyfriend cancels their anniversary date and then she gets saddled with a last-minute babysitting gig. Off she drives to the Andersons, where awaits a routine evening of minding smitten 15-year-old Brad and his younger Thor-worshipping sister Sara. But a frantic phone call from Chris's friend Brenda - stranded at a downtown bus station and in desperate need of a pick-up - has Chris reluctantly packing her charges in her mom's station wagon and, joined by Brad's randy, gate-crashing best bud Daryl, heading out to the City. But the weirdness doesn't really start until the car blows out a tire on the expressway, leaving Chris and the kids braving the seamy 'hoods of downtown Chicago, penniless and very worried. Especially when the creepy, hook-for-a-hand tow truck driver rolls up...

Admittedly, I'm biased. I hold ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING in rose-colored regard, having been weaned on this sort of teen cinema in the '80s. But I get that this is a dated movie nowadays. Thing is, when you park yourself somewheres to peep this flick, don't look too much for hard-hitting realism. ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING, more than anything else, is a comedy fable, and a gentle comedy fable at that, despite the inner-city escapades the kids stumble into. Although I'd like to think that some of the shady characters the kids encounter really would lend a helping hand (or hook) in real life.

There's a lot of zany popping up, but the ever appealing Elizabeth Shue is like the serene eye of the storm. She infuses her character with a certain calm and composure, as well as resourcefulness and cheek. Not to say that she doesn't get shaken up in spots, because she does faint in one scene. But girl isn't quite your shrinking violet. In fact, she unveils unexpected reserves. So, no, it's not only Shue's terrific looks which hooked me in back in the day. Chris earns her babysitting wages as she faces off against a car boosting ring, rival gangs on the El train, and *gulp* a mean-faced bluesman who insists that ""Nobody leaves this place without singing the blues."" Along the way, she gets a measure of getback at her weasely boyfriend and then lives out the title to the film's opening song.

There are several cute running gags here. One such has folks mistaking Chris for a nekkid magazine centerfold, and this actually ties into the film's McGuffin, a certain adult magazine containing incriminating notes for which the chop shop mobsters are chasing the children. Actually, one of the best lines happens when the head thug can't find the magazine, in which he'd jotted down details of a business deal, and a henchman shamefacedly owns up: ""I... uh... took the Playboy upstairs. There was this... article."" Another ongoing joke has a very cool payoff and deals with Sara's obsession with Thor. And, lest we forget the reason the kids are in the City, the camera finds time to occasionally cut back to Bus Station Brenda as she experiences her own misadventures, the lowlight of which features a kitten-petting scene. Heh. Poor Brenda.

But, hands down, the best and warmest moment of the film - and actually one of my favorite moments in all of cinema - has Chris and the children performing the ""Babysittin' Blues"" in that tough blues joint. It's hard to top that act.

Several well-known actors have cameos: Bradley Whitford as Mike, the scuzzball boyfriend; Vincent D'Onofrio as the garage mechanic to whom the Thor-obsessed little sister takes a shine; and a pre-sexy Penelope Ann Miller as Bus Station Brenda. But the standout supporting actor is this guy, Calvin Levels, who shines as Joe Gipp, the car thief who may (or may not) turn out to be a good dude after all.

This film is more fluff than grit, I get that. The two teens, Brad and Daryl, are borderline annoying, yes, and the film is soaked in that dated 1980s sensibility. But it's also got more feel-good moments than not, when you can't help but root for the babysitter as she goes above and beyond. And the film is funny. ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING is a must-see for two things. The quite awesome, high-spirited ""Babysittin' Blues"" number. And Elizabeth Shue. By the way, if you're wondering why Elizabeth Shue hasn't done more films in her career, it's because it's not often that I let her off my pedestal.

Dammit, Elizabeth Shue, you get back on that pedestal!",1233360000,,4934,4.8654761904761905

The person who titled their review Adventurers in Racism is a moron.  Obviously this person suffers from deep seeded issues that he should see a counselor for and he must not have watched the movie.  To correct a few things.....

1) the bad guys in the movie were both white and black - in fact the main guy who wanted to ""dispose"" of the kids for fear of them telling the cops about the stolen cars was a white man - not black.  And black car thief, even though he was a car thief he was still a nice guy and helped save them. The chop shop was VERY mixed with white, black, and Hispanic - in fact when the kids are nervously shaking the row of men's hands you see more white men then black men.  True the blues bar was all black but it was a fun place to be in my opinion so who cares!

2) the bus station was mixed with various races.  When the runaway friend called Chris (Elizabeth Shue) it was not a black person who was making her freak out but an old white man yelling at her to get out of his phone booth house.  And the man at the station with the gun - white.  Yes - there was the black lady who took her glasses but it was funny.

3) And by the way the gangs on the train were mixed as well with not one color skin standing out more than the other.

So to anyone thinking of getting this movie - it's a lot of fun.  I personally love this movie and think it's great!  This movie does not promote racism and it is not laced with racial stereotypes.

And to Victor - GET A LIFE!

Interesting how times have changed though since this film was shot.

Chris thinks she is too old to baby-sit but Brad doesn't mind - he has a huge crush on Chris. When Chris gets to the Anderson's, she has just settled in for what she thinks will be a very boring evening when she gets a phone call from her friend Brenda who is stuck at a bus station in ""The City"". Chris agrees to pick up Brenda and has to take Sara, Brad, and Brad's friend Daryl, with her for what she hopes will be a quick trip. Instead, a flat tire leads to all kinds of adventures including a crazed tow truck driver; a stolen car ring; a gang fight; a visit to a Blues Bar; a frat party; a meeting with ""Thor"" (Sara's hero); and a heart stopping chase down the side of an office building. Suddenly, what looked to be one of the most boring nights of Chris's life turns out to be one of the most exciting.

""Adventures in Baby Sitting"" is a good fun movie, the kind you can watch without thinking too much about it - the kind of movie that keeps you smiling the whole time you are watching it. Nothing in it is to be taken seriously (for one thing Brad is way too old to need a babysitter) and while there are bad guys, they are never too scary and the kids easily outsmart them. The film is non-stop action and there are a lot of fun scenes in the movie. The scene in the Blues Bar is an instant classic. This is a good family movie, but parents should be aware that there is some colorful swearing (but in a very funny scene). The acting is good. Elisabeth Shue shines as Chris; Keith Coogan is good as the love struck Brad; Maia Brewton is wonderful as Sara; and Anthony Rapp is sufficiently annoying as Darryl. Of the supporting cast, Calvin Levels is a standout as Joe Gipp, the not so bad car thief.

This is your only chance to see one of the greatest blues legends in a movie...namely Albert Collins.  If you love and live the blues, then the movie is about the scene with ""Babysitting Blues"".  Albert Collins (aka The Iceman, aka The Master of the Telecaster) is worth the price of the DVD.  Along with him you get the music of Koko Taylor's ""Evil"", Edwin Starr's ""Twenty-five Miles"", Muddy Waters, Southside Johnny, the Crystals and more.

Actually (for the Canadian reviewer) the movie is about overcoming racism.",1173398400,2,645,4.827272727272727

310363,1,6301008944,"With all due respect to the director of Adventures in Babysitting, Chris Colombus, he helped create one of the most racist films in American cinematic history.

Is it well crafted?  Yes.  Is the acting okay?  Yes.  Does it move along?  Heck, just like a windup toy.

But please consider the plot:

A white girl (Elizabeth Shue, lightyears from her work in Leaving Las Vegas) is baby-sitting several white kids, when she gets a desperate phone call from her white girl friend.  Why is her white girl friend desperate?  Because she is stuck in a downtown bus station, surrounded by (gasp) African Americans!

Naturally, Shue races off, baby-sitting kids in tow, to rescue her friend from this tragic situation.  Maybe she should have called Jesse Jackson first, eh?

When Shue gets downtown, various amusing adventures ensue.  But how can it be ignored that each of the adventures involves meeting someone who lives in the inner city who is African American.  And every single African American she meets is a criminal.  There is only one exception: (are you ready?  'spoiler' ahead!): the African Americans who sing and dance!

Colombus must have been very disappointed that Steppin Fetchit (who adopted that stage name as a joke) was not alive and could not appear in his film.

There is one African American who helps Shue and who does not sing and dance.  (Spoiler ahead) I kept hoping he would turn out to be an undercover cop.  But, no, he was a car thief.

It would appear that Mr. Colombus is not aware of any non-singing, non-dancing African Americans who are not thieves, thugs or crooks.

The film is a disgrace.  Really.  The fact that it is well produced makes it even worse--it can not be written off as a cheapy done by people who did not know better.

For anyone who has seen Mr. Colombus' other films, however, the racism of this film should come as no surprise.  ""Home Alone"" was set in a similarly all white world (there was a single African American with a speaking part of a few lines, and no other non-white cast members).

Even in J.R. Rowling's Harry Potter series, which devoted a great amount of time to racism issues (between 'muggles' and magic practitioners, a brilliant symbolic foray into racism by Rowling), Colombus managed to dilute her anti-racism message. Look at the first two Harry Potter films, which he directed: multi-cultural England in Colombus' hands becomes an almost entirely all white country.  Only after Colombus leaves the series do non-white actors get a chance.

This film should not be praised.  It should be held up as an example of cultural bias and racism.

I generally do not write negative reviews, but this film has been given a 'free ride' for way too long by American film critics.  But they are the same critics who praise 'Gone With the Wind', a four hour film about the civil war which does not once mention the word 'slave'.  The racism of 'Gone With The Wind' has been ignored by most reviewers.  It took a long time for me to realize how racist it was.  When I first saw it as a kid, I thought Scarlett O'Hara must have been a wonderful employer! I assumed that Scarlett must have had a wonderful dental plan for her African American employees, to keep them so loyal!",1163030400,19,3231,4.686832740213523

Still, if you are dying to watch a movie, and it's the only thing on TV, go for it, but don't waste your money buying it.

That's the whole point, so don't be afraid to indulge!!! It really takes you back to your teen years, especially if you ever babysat and wished for some excitement instead of boredom. Chris Parker (a marvellous Elisabeth Shue) is a beautiful high school senior who was anticipating celebrating with her boyfriend, Mike (Bradley Whitford) regarding their anniversary. However, the jerk (as the viewers know) stands her up with some really lame excuse and she ends up babysitting for the Andersons, who have a very curious and adorable daughter, Sara, (Maia Brewton) and a teenage son, Brad, (Keith Coogan, grandson of the great Jackie Coogan) who secretly makes puppy eyes at Chris. Brad's obnoxious best friend, Daryl (Anthony Rapp) shows up and wants in when Chris receives a frantic phone call from her best friend, Brenda (a wonderfully comedic Penelope Ann Miller), who has run away from home, only to be stranded at a downtown Chicago bus stations with some really pricelessly goofy characters. Our heroine dares to take the rugrats with her to rescue her pal, and they encounter one outrageous adventure after another. In the process, they blow a tire, meet up with an amputee truck driver, witness an assault, end up being dragged down to a automobile heisting operation, chased by the bad guys, singing in a blues club (one of the best sequences), come between a gang war on a subway, crash (almost literally) a frat party, and discover that Chris's guy has been two-timing her with an ""easy chick"", and end up at the Anderson's party downtown. And they do, finally accomplish their mission to rescue Brenda, while trying to beat the progenetors home!!! Whew!!! No wonder Chris decides that this is going to be her first and last job!!!! The 60s soundtrack does nothing to hurt the film, in fact, it enhances it, especially the opening track, ""He Kissed Me"" by the Crystals. (A moment that every girl dreams about). The situations are hilarious, with as always, the charmingly clueless yuppie parents, funny villains, and resourceful protagonists. I applauded when Daryl returned a long overdue favor to Mike in the French restaurant, and the facial expression on Daryl's face on the freeway when they are approached by ""Handsome"" John Pruitt just takes the cake!!!

When highschool senior Chris Parker (Elisabeth Shue) decides to spend Saturday night babysitting the Anderson kids Sara (Maia Brewton) and Brad (Keith Coogan) as well as Brad's best friend Daryl (Anthony Rapp), no one, not least Chris, will be prepared for the wild ride ahead, when Chris' best friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) phones and begs to be rescued from the Chicago bus depot after an aborted attempt to run away.  Chris bundles the kids in the car and heads for downtown Chicago, but after getting stranded thanks to a flat tyre, the gang end up in a mess of trouble!

This is such a fun film.  Elisabeth Shue glows as Chris and offers one of her funniest comedy performances.  Whilst she is best-remembered by most film critics for her role in ""Leaving Las Vegas"", to 80's kids like me, she'll forever be fondly regarded as Chris in AIB.

Anthony Rapp, Keith Coogan and Maia Brewton are hilarious in their roles, and Penelope Ann Miller is a scream in the film's clever subplot of Brenda's adventures in the bus depot.  The film also features early turns from Vincent d'Onofrio, Bradley Whitford and George Newbern.

The story of a babysitter who takes the kids along as she heads off to pick up her panic stricken friend from a seedy bus stop and is caught up in a series of unplanned adventures, is very much an adventure. On repeat viewings, it doesn't quite hold up as much as the first time, but for those watching the first time it is a wonderfully fun rollercoaster ride where you don't know where it will end up next. Looking back, I still remember the wonderful performance of the wholesome Elisabeth Shue, and developed quite a crush. Watching it again, I can still see why I had that crush. Her character is beautiful, romantic, and caring, and you not only wish you were kissing her yourself, but you genuinely hope that her character gets her kiss. The kids are fun too.

310587,4,6301008944,"There are certain movies in various stages of your life that stay with you no matter what. These movies might linger on and have a special place because of a certain time you saw them, or it just reminds you of something. It doesn't matter in any way if these movies were even any good at all. They were good to you for a special purpose, and that's what matters. This one is just one of those kinds of movies for me. While it's  far from being a classic piece of American cinema, it isn't that bad at all, and delivers 99 minutes of pure fun and silliness. I was 8 when I saw this movie, and I remember renting it many times over in the years after. I guess it just brings back fond memories of my childhood. Elisabeth Shue stars in this 1987 comedy as Chris Parker, a very popular high school student who seems to be living the teenage dream. She's pretty, popular, and is going out with a top of the line guy(West Wing's Bradley Whitford of all people). Chris' big night out with her boyfriends turns sour when he breaks their date and now her night is ruined. Or so she thinks. She accepts the job of babysitting the Anderson kids. Brad(Keith Coogan), is a dorky kinda kid with a bad 80's haircut who has a crush on Chris. Who wouldn't?. Little sister Sara(Maia Brewton) is a cute littly dynamo who's obsessed with fictional character Thor, complete with cape and viking helmet. The quiet evening at home turns into anything but when Chris' nutty best friend Brenda(Penelope Ann Miller), calls for help. Brenda is at the bus station and needs Chris to come pick her up. What seems like a simple little trek into downtown Chicago to pick up a friend turns into a nightmare. For starters, they are joined by Brad's annoying friend(played by Anthony Rapp, who went on to do ""Rent"" on Broadway), and to make matters worse, they get a flat tire on the freeway. From there on, it's a mad dash thru the mean streets of Chicago, coming into contact with one handed truckers, car thieves, gangs, doctors, Frat house keggers, blues singers, and a long, blonde haired Vincent D'Onofrio. I don't which is scarier. AIB is a perfect 80's movie. It fits right into the category that already includes the best of John Hughes' input(and what big 80's kid movie didn't he do?!)and a few others. One of the pluses is the cast. Shue is wonderful as Chris, a young girl who is trying desperatley to save her friend and keep her young charges out of harm's way. The kids themselves are good. They may have some typical young kid annoyances, but they are all pretty good and make it feel like they are real kids who you actually like. Penelope Ann Miller is one of the best parts here. With her big glasses, nerdy appearance, and comical misadventures of her own in the bus terminal, she delivers many of the funniest moments. There are some moments that just scream ""Hollywood"", like the car thief with a heart of gold, but this is just for fun. AIB is a fun and nostalgic trip back to 1987. I just heard that there are plans underway for a re-make. Hollywood, pleas leave a good thing alone.",1117497600,4,3074,4.450354609929078

Elisabeth Shue, while excellent in the dramas she's been doing lately, is magnetic in the comedic role of Chris Parker.  All three actors who play the kids she ends up babysitting are hilarious and not annoying in the least, which is a rarity.  Penelope Ann Miller as Chris's friend Brenda is hysterical, especially in a memorable phone booth scene.

The only disappointment comes from the fact that this DVD has so little to offer in the Extras department.

310595,5,6301008944,"Chris Parker is in for one hell of a night!
A babysitter, Chris Parker (Elisabeth Shue) was looking forward to a date with her boyfriend, but he decides to cancel, and she's left feeling disappointed, of course. But, more importantly, she decides to keep an eye on kids Brad (Keith Coogan) and Sara (Maia Brewton) while their parents attend a gathering. However, Chris is suddenly faced with a challenge when her friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) is scared to death, as she lands in a seedy downtown Chicago bus station, during her attempt to runaway from home. Chris has to make a choice: stay home with the kiddies, or go downtown to rescue her friend. Of course, she chooses the latter option, and takes the kids with her. Meanwhile, Brad's sex-obsessed best friend, Daryl (Anthony Rapp) happens to blackmail the gang into letting him come along for the ride. And from there, the action begins.
The kids bump into one misadventure after another in the mean streets of urban Chicago. From flat tire accidents, to auto theft, to gang fights, to secret criminal operation headquarter drop-ins, and then some -- somehow, no matter where they turn, these kids find themselves caught up in one catastrophe after another, so to speak. And, of course, their biggest challenge - other than making it through all the chaos in one piece - is to rescue Brenda, and make it back home before the parents arrive.
While the attributes of the film that were mentioned above sound pretty disturbing -- at least for a film aimed at the younger audience, there's very little that's dangerous in this film -- all of these elements are made to be kid - or rather - pre-adolescent-friendly. It's quite interesting and compelling how Chris Columbus made so many gritty elements appear fun and lighthearted, without sinking into sheer parody and silliness.
You can find guest appearances from many who would go onto more acclaimed projects. All in all, a lighthearted, fun, adventurous (pun excusable), charming and utterly poignant film. A guilty pleasure? Absolutely not - just a pleasure, as I have no shame in enjoying this film.",1066435200,,2113,4.888579387186629
310596,4,6301008944,"Chris Parker (Elisabeth Shue) is all set for an anniversary date with her boyfriend, when he cancels on her, citing a sick little sister. With nothing better to do for the evening, she accepts an offer to babysit for the Andersons. She settles in with Brad (Keith Coogan) and Sara (Maia Brewton), her charges, for a night of boredom, when her friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) calls from a downtown bus station, saying that she ran away from home and then chickened out. Bundling the kids and Brad's friend Daryl (Anthony Rapp) into the car, she goes to get Brenda. The mishaps start with a flat tire, and go downhill from there.
Subplots include a chop-shop, a Playmate who looks like Chris in the current issue of Playboy, and Brenda's waiting at the bus station; where she loses her glasses, mistakes a sewer rat for a kitty, and finds out that snack bars don't take checks when she tries to get a hot dog, with the classic line ""But I don't have cash!"" ""Then I don't have a wiener!""
The movie was a smash hit, and launched many a career. The main actors are great, with the secondary actors doing a fine job as well. The story seems like ""Vacation"" in the city, but that's its charm. Chris Columbus' directorial debut, and would later direct Home Alone, ""Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire"". The film is presented in anamorphic widescreen, and has some grain, but is good. The audio is a clear Dolby Surround 2.0. The extras are a huge disappointment, with the only extra being Touchstone's Film Reccomendations (One of those stupid screens where you get movies the distributor thinks you will like). Nice DVD, but it warrants a special edition.

310668,5,6301008944,"In the tradition of ""License To Drive"" and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" this movie delivers high laughs and pure entertainment that everyone can enjoy. Shue shines as Chris Parker who, after been stood up by her boyfriend, gets stuck babysitting a kid daughter and her 15 year old brother (who shouldn't be there but decides to tag along due to his infatuation for Chris). She gets a distress call from her best pal Brenda who is trapped in a bus station downtown and Chris needs to go pick her up - but she is supposed to be babysitting! She decides to take them with her and this is where the real fun starts. Before they know it they are being chased by gangsters, singing for their lives in a seedy blues club and trying their hardest not to bump into the parents on the town.
Crammed with laughs, action and superb blues music ""Adventures In Babysitting"" is everything a comedy should be!",1054598400,2,891,4.506172839506172

310670,4,6301008944,"1987 was one of the better years of my life. I was ten years old and the world was my oyster. I went to a couple of different camps that year and for the first time began to see how big the world really was.  1987 was also the year ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING came out.  The movie stars Elisabeth Shue, back when she still played good, clean, fun parts and was the directorial debut for Chris Colombus (the guy behind HOME ALONE, MRS. DOUBTFIRE, and those HARRY POTTER movies).
The movie is about a babysitter who gets an unexpected call to babysit right after her boyfriend postpones their anniversary dinner. She agrees, but just after the parents leave, her best friend calls from the bus station downtown in Chicago. The best friend has run away from home and is in a bit of trouble. So, unable to leave the kids alone and unable to abandon her best friend to the perverts she has encountered, she loads up the station wagon (station wagon, the classic 80s family vehicle) and heads to the city. But a tire goes flat on the expressway and chaos begins: jealous husbands, car thieves, gang wars, mob bosses, and rowdy college parties.  All in a night's work.
The film is charming because even though it pokes fun of the suburbanites of Chicagoland, it does so without being harsh, while at the same time uplifting the good and finer (though few) points about living in the suburbs. A friend of mine loves this movie solely because of that.
Overall, the movie is fun and is worth seeing because it jumpstarted Shue's career and was Colombus's first feature.",1040342400,5,1557,4.573476702508961
310671,5,6301008944,"It took me all of the opening 2 minutes of this film to remember why I had such an enormous crush on Elisabeth Shue while I was in high school.  Nowadays she is a serious actress with excellent honors and awards to her credit.  Back in her early Thespian days, however, she was just plain adorable.
As you might expect, the movie is about a routine babysitting job that goes awry.  Kris (Shue) reluctantly drives from the suburbs to the inner-city of Chicago with 3 kids she's supposed to be watching over.  On her way to pick up a flighty friend who wanted to run away, her mom's station-wagon gets a flat tire.  Let's just say that the rest of the evening is all downhill from there!
While the adventures are off-the wall, the plot does maintain a certain cohesion as all of the adventures are linked together nicely.  The film also serves as a funny satire of what happens to naive suburbanites when they end up on the ""wrong"" side of the inner-city.  Along the way, the kids even pass thru the university of Chicago which is, despite its reputation as an elite academic institution, most ASSUREDLY located on a rough side of Chicago.
This film is highly recommended for all persons who enjoy adolescent comedies.  If you look up ""fun movie"" in the dictionary, you just might find this movie listed as an example.",1038009600,3,1316,4.546610169491525
310672,3,6301008944,"If someone could tell me why some movies have two titles,that would be great......./Anyway//Liz Shue plays a 17 year old babysitter who is stuck babysitting 3 brats(2 are teens)after her conceited boyfriend stands her up for the school hussy. That's NOT where the hardships end. A trip into the city to rescue her best friend who has run away from home and is stuck at an airport with a mob of wackos(including a bald chinese lady with no pants on and a man waving a gun around and grinning)leads to one mishap and dangerous adventure after another. Will they ever make it home b4 the kids parents get home???It is pretty funny,especially Daryl,a smart-mouth who laughs like a deranged loony at everything. When I was 15,this movie actually made me WANT to get stuck in the city with those kinds of scary adventures,which means I'm sorta weird I guess.",1034553600,,852,4.724832214765101
310673,5,6301008944,"Elisabeth Shue is Chris Parker, a normal seventeen year old who begins the night with an ordinary babysitting job, sitting two normal suburban children, Sarah and Brad. After her friend - Brenda (Penelope Anne Miller) -- calls from a bus station in the city (Chicago), stating that she has runaway from home and needs Chris' support, Chris takes off to the city with Brad, Sarah, and Brad's friend, Daryl. What should have been a 30 minute ride to the bus station turns into a run through the city as the group of four encounter car thieves, weird mechanics, and a place where nobody leaves without singing the blues.
  Adventures in Babysitting is THE fun movie of the 80s. Well, THE fun movie that doesn't contain little monsters, goonies, or Tom Hanks. As we follow the quartet through Chicago, we are introduced to hilarious scenes and crazy antics as they get themselves in the middle of a car heist, a cheating wife and her enraged husband, and many more. I must say that one of the biggest highlights of the film is the Blues Bar scene where Elisabeth Shue and the kids absolutely have to sing before leaving the bar. It's great.
  The films is full of great characters. Elisabeth Shue is vibrant as Chris Parker, the babysitter gal. Her interaction with the kids was great, and she handled her leading status with ease. Maia Brewton is little Sarah who offers a lot of the laughs in the movie. She was awesome - I wonder where she is now? Keith Coogan and Anthony Rapp (Rent! Mark in Rent! I love Rent!) are Brad and Daryl, and both stay true to their roles and make them entertaining. But did anyone else want to occasionally strangle Anthony Rapp for that laugh?! We also see the likes of a young Penelope Anne Miller and Vincent D'Onofrio in cameo roles. Although Miller's role is a bit bigger, and very hilarious.
 Although the DVD release is bare, without even a nice trailer to suit a fan, we do get a nicely widescreen anamorphic presentation with nice picture (Although there are signs of an aged film) and good audio.

  Adventures In Babysitting is definitely one of my favorite 80s movies. For the fact that it's a great, fun, and crazily adventurous comedy.",1030752000,2,2177,4.636363636363637
310774,4,6301008944,"As a kid, I always wished I could have the coolest babysitter whenever my parents went out for the night. It never happened ... until I saw this movie, that is. Elisabeth Shue, in her first lead role, is the babysitter of every kid's dreams, and her enthusiasm helps carry the film through the lulls here and there. Director Chris Columbus, who would later establish himself in Hollywood with ""Home Alone,"" has a winning effort in his directorial debut. With a number of memorable scenes and an attractive and capable cast, this is an adventure worth taking.",1013385600,,558,4.762886597938144

Directed by Chris Columbis (Home Alone 1 & 2, Bicentennial Man, Harry Potter and the Philosopher`s Stone) and Produced by Debra Hill (Halloween, The Fog, Escape from New York).

310776,5,6301008944,The 1980's brought us a lot of wonderful teen movies.  Adventures in Babysitting is definitely one of the best ones to come out of that decade.  The cast is wonderful (even the younger stars are good actors).  The plot is full of fun twists and turns.  The entire package is wonderful.  I have no complaints about this movie.  I'm thrilled that it has been re-released on DVD.,1008374400,,376,4.537313432835821

310778,3,6301008944,"Despite the score I love this movie. But the truth is it is neither funny enough or clever enough to warrant a higher score. Elisabeth Shue is extremely winning in her first lead role, and really deserved to go onto better things.  Adventures follows Elisabeth on her journey with the three kids she's babysitting and her attempt to help a friend stuck in the city. They get into all sorts of theoretically wacky scrapes that never really hit the comedic peaks you'd hope. But the whole journey adds up to a satisfying experience and you'll probably find yourself with a stupid grin by the end. On a side the note, this DVD is quite poor, the picture is not anamorphic and the sound is not Dolby Digital.  If you look back at eighties movies with fondness this is probably a worthy purchase.",990316800,,791,4.563380281690141
310779,5,6301008944,"Adventures In Babysitting is a Blast. I first saw this movie when I was 10 years old, now I am 24 and after all these years I can still say I really love this movie. Elisabeth Shue gives a great performance in her first leading role, along with the rest of the cast who together seem to bring this movie to life. The movie starts off with Chris singing a classic oldie called ""And Than He Kissed Me"" and from the minute you hear the song you know your in for a treat with this movie. After getting the cold shoulder from her boyfriend, Chris decides to babysitt and have a quiet night, but when her best friend Brenda calls her to rescue her downtown, Chris decides to take the three kids along with her. Expecting a dull evening she soon finds that the night is anything but dull. The night soon turns in to an endless adventure that will have all of them hanging from the rafters. I will not give away any of the movie, but I will say this is one of those rare movies you can watch over and over and never get tired of it. I highly suggest you check out this great movie! This is one to own on DVD.",986688000,4,1100,4.097222222222222
310780,4,6301008944,"Beginning your movie with the right song can get you off to a good start and ""Adventures in Babysitting"" gives us that golden oldie ""And Then He Kissed Me"" as Chris Parker prepares for her big date with her boyfriend.  Unfortunately, this clown promptly proceeds to dump our heroine, which only proves he is a fool because Chris is played by Elisabeth Shue.  Those of us who remember ""Call to Glory"" already knew that Shue was a babe and so does Brad Anderson (Keith Coogan), the kid who is too old for the babysitter on whom he has a mondo crush.  Into the mix we add Sara Anderson (Maia Brewton), the adorable kid sister who has a thing for the Mighty Thor from Marvel Comics (she must have got the cool Thor helmet from Stan Lee, Jack Kirby or somebody in the ol' Bullpen), Daryl Coopersmith  (Anthony Rapp), Brad's best friend who has yet to learn when to shut up, and Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller), Chris' best friend who is stuck in downtown Chicago at a bus depot without her glasses, having decided that running away from home was a bad idea.  Unfortunately for our heroine, deciding to simply go down and pick up Brenda proves to be a bad idea.  With the three kids in tow, Chris takes off for the big city.  When the station wagon gets a flat tire that is only the first in a massive chain of misfortunes that befall our plucky lass.  There will be a tow truck man with a claw, street thugs with knives on the El, gangster in a chop shop, a college frat party, a close encounter with the parental units at a party high at top a skyscraper, and a delightful session of singing ""The Babysitter Blues.""
In its own way, ""Adventures in Baby Sitting is in the mold of the Indiana Jones films, where the cast of characters are stuck on a roller coaster of exciting encounters.  Our harried heroine puts up with all of this in order to save her friend and get the kids home before their parents find out they have spent the night narrowly escaping death instead of being safe at home watching the tube.  Even though there is a running gag that Chris looks exactly like the Playmate of the Month, this is a movie aimed for kids in the age range of her charges.  There is enough of a cartoonish element to the bad guys to take the edge off of the dangers involved and of course we know from the first note of the movie that everything will turn out okay in the end and Chris is going to top off the evening by getting kissed by someone who might actually deserve her.  Shue's natural performance holds the film together and although she has gone on to decidedly more dramatic roles in her more recent films, she evinces a natural flair for comedy in this one.  However, be warned: once your kidlets have seen this 1987 Disney film they are going to be grossly disappointed in whoever you pay to watch them the next time you go out for a night of fun.  Final note: Be sure to watch the entire credits at the end.",981417600,57,2910,4.325367647058823

Day Off"", ""Can't Buy Me Love"", ""Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead"", ""License To Drive"" and ""Goonies""........just a bunch of kids running around in trouble all the time.  When I first saw this film....it was in the late eighties.....I just fell in love with Elisabeth Shue and her performance in ""Adventures in Babysitting"".  Ever since the opening scene when she lip-synched to the song: ""AND THEN HE KISSED ME"".  She plays as a 17 year old (but 23 in real life at the time) getting stuck babysitting for 3 kids when her boyfriend cancels on their date.  Her night is filled with adventure facing one obsticle after another trying to get the kids back safe and sound.  Filmed on location in Chicago and in Toronto.  The famous scene where Elisabeth Shue sings the ""BLUES"" was in a bar in downtown Toronto called ""The Silver Dollar"".  I've been there myself when I attended the University of Toronto.......today it has closed down.

310872,3,6301008944,"Fun comedy that at best can be described as entertaining made memroable by an engaging performance from Elizabeth Shue as the babysitter and also Mai brewton, Keith Coogan, Anthony Rapp and Calvin Lewis. Theres a series of winning sequences with possibly the very best being where the gang find themselves on stage in a seedy, blues nightclub and the ending is quite amusing. The plot is pretty simple - Chris, the babysitter, receives a phone call from her friend Penny in a run down bus station in the heart of the city. So Chris and the kids all head for the bus station to ""rescue"" Penny and then unwittingly find themselves plunged into a series of adventures and becoming the target of gangsters. Take out the swear words you'd easily have a Disney style family movie. However the film holds many pleasing moment and on the whole its a god film with some obvious shortcomings.

I haven't seen it in quite a few years now, but I remember almost every word of it because I watched it so many times when I was younger.  It is one of the classics, in my humble opinion!
Every one is so spunky and loveable in this film, especially the red-haired kid whose favourite catchphrase is.  ""...Ya think?""
I really reccommend this to families, (with kids over twelve).  The small amount of swearing and suggestive behaviour isn't enough to deter parents from letting their kids watch such an entertaining movie.  Well, I don't think it should be anyhoo.
The story is a real roller coaster ride, and a bit of a nail-biter, if like me, you tend to get caught up in the midst of things and forget that it's just a movie!  There is never a dull moment with this little gem.  Watch it, enjoy it and feel good, is all I'm trying to say.",972000000,2,1002,4.437158469945355

310876,5,6301008944,"In the tradition of the ""Goonies,"" Elisabeth Shue shines in her first starring role as Chris, whose day starts out on a bad note. After her boyfriend cancels their date, Chris decided to babysit for a couple who are  in dire need for her services. In care of charges, Brad and Sarah, Chris  believes this will be an ordinary job, however trouble comes knocking,  first when Brad's pest of a friend, Daryl comes to stay over, and then when  Chris' best friend is stranded at the bus depot in downtown Chicago.
What  follows are a series of madcap adventures that take these suburban kids  into the heart of the city. After their car's tire goes flat, the Chris and  the kids must find a way to find their way back home and go help her friend  at the same time. However, when they run into a car-theft ring  headquarters, their night won't be the same again.
Featuring a wonderful  cast including many actors unknown back then (Penelope Ann Miller as Chris'  friend; Vincent D'Onofrio as the mechanic, etc.), ""Adventures in  Babysitting,"" marks the directorial debut for director Chris Columbus  (""Home Alone""; ""Stepmom""; the upcoming ""Harry  Potter"" film adaption) who does an excellent job of making this film  work. His ability to stretch character limits works well here, as he is  able to place the kids in nearly impossible scenarios. The most memorable  scene in this film that captures Columbus' imaginative directing features  Sarah scrawling the windows of the towering building in downtown Chicago  where her father works at night. As she scrawls the windows in fleeing from  a member of a car-theft ringleader, she sees her parents at their party  from the outside. Who could have thought of such a funny way of seeing your  parents at the wrong place and wrong time?
Similar to other amazing  average-day adventure films such as ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off,""  and the ""Goonies,"" - ""Adventures in Babysitting,"" is  still as entertaining today as it was over a decade ago.

It's rare these days to see a movie with any sort of involving  plot, and the innumerable twists and turns of this one are enough to make  the journey worthwhile. With an absolutely stellar soundtrack, heavy on the  blues, every moment has a meaning.
Adventures in Babysitting deserves a  rank among classics like Ferris Bueller's Day off and The Princess Bride.  This isn't just another 80's movie and it's less about the babysitting than  the adventure.

The acting, the music and  the appealing plot make the story enjoyable for everybody from kids to  parents. I popped the disk into the machine with no great expectations, and  could not stop watching until it finished.

7809180,4,6301008944,"Although the picture and sound are well above the DVD release, for an 'Anniversary Edition', it is sorely lacking in the supplemental department. It doesn't have anything. Nothing. The picture looks very nice with good clarity and color. The soundtrack, as simple as it is, has terrific clarity and nice bass during the action and music. Just wish we got more for the money. It's an 80's classic, and deserves better.",1522195200,,417,4.887323943661972

7809186,5,6301008944,"RELEASED IN 1987 and directed by Chris Columbus, Adventures in Babysitting (aka ""A Night on the Town"") is a teen dramedy about 17 year-old babysitter, Chris (Elisabeth Shue), from the suburbs of Chicago who has no choice but to take the siblings shes babysitting (Keith Coogan & Maia Brewton) and their friend (Anthony Rapp) into the big city whereupon they have many misadventures. Penelope Ann Miller plays Chris geeky friend (at the bus station), Calvin Levels a car thief, John Davis Chandler the main heavy and George Newbern a helpful college dude with eyes for Chris.

I was surprised at how entertaining this movie is. It has the tone of an Indiana Jones flick, but with teen protagonists and taking place in a modern USA city. The Thor element was a unique surprise and the little girl is cute and spry. The protagonists are likable and you can sense the warmth in their relationships, e.g. Brads infatuation with Chris.

Unfortunately, the movie fumbles the ball on the female front a little bit. There are quality women in the cast, for sure, but the director never milks these resources for their worth (and Im not tawkin bout nudity or sleaze). Take Shue, for example (who was 21 during filming); shes dressed in a looong sweater or jacket that covers her figure the entire film. Compare this with her role in The Karate Kid (1984) where her beauty is well displayed and tastefully so.

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 42 minutes and was shot in Toronto and the Chicago area. WRITER: David Simkins
