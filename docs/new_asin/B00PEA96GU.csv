8687668,5,B00PEA96GU,"Liselotte Pulver (celebrated her 87th birthday one week ago!) a swiss actress:
her most famous german movies in one Box (DVD area code: 2, german language!).

My very personal favorite of all her movies is ""Kohlhiesels Tchter"" (Kohlhiesels Daughters) where she Plays twin-sisters: Susi and Liesl. Her Co-Star is Helmut Schmid (who became her real-life husband)  and Dietmar Schnherr.

Her first movie appearance was in a US / Swiss-Coproduction ""Swiss Tour"" (1949) starring Cornel Wild. She made in 1954 a swiss movie called ""Uli der Knecht"" (Uli the tenant).
With ""Ich denke oft an Piroschka"" (1955) she became famous over-night in Germany where she played a hungarian Girl called ""Piroschka"". It's a beautiful love Story (with co-star Gunnar Moeller) but without an happy-end.

With co-star (and from Switzerland too): Paul Hubschmid (in the US better know as: Paul Christian) she made ""Die Zrcher Verlobung""  and with later Bond-Super-villain Curd Juergens she made ""Gustav Adolfs Page"".

DVD's/Language: German
DVD Code: 2 (so you must have a Region-free Player)

Fazit: love those movies",1476748800,,1092,5.350877192982456
