He was enthralled by the pictures and information provided. My daughter was mad at me for ""upsetting"" her son! I can't wait to buy another topic!",1455062400,,278,4.8125

8511958,5,B0077PBQ4A,"A SCUBA diver can go down about 165 feet (with proper training), deepest dive on SCUBA 1,089 feet, US Navy diver in a ADS suit 2,000 feet, the Alvin (a deep sea submersible) can take 3 people down to 13,000 feet (2.4 miles),  ROVs (stands for Remote Operated Vehicle, no people inside, remotely operated by people on land) about 35,000 feet, that is about 6.6 miles. James Cameron - the third person to ever reach the bottom of Mariana Trench in Pacific Ocean where Mt. Everest could easily fit with 7,000 feet to spare - went down 36,000 feet.

Sperm whales (SW) are known to dive as deep as 3,280 feet in search of squid to eat. These giant mammals must hold their breath for up to 90 minutes a dive, and cruise the oceans at around 23 miles per hour. SW needs a head which covers over one third of the body to do many tasks from freezing the three to four tons of oil in the head - which is the cleanest burning oil with no smoke - in sinking 60 ton of weight to the depths of oceans to making clicking vocalization, a form of echolocation and communication which is over 230 decibels. SWs have giant jawbones with giant teeth for biting and holding on to giant squids for food. Ribs that bend due to high ocean depth pressures unlike human's ribs. Ambergris an oily black membrane found in the rectum of SW which holds smell well and sought after by expensive perfume makers at a cost of seven million dollars each if they find any. Humans still hunt SW for the oil and hope of finding Ambergris but make animal feed with the rest of the body. SWs get all their water from their food since the salt water will kill SWs just like it would kill any mammal.

Very educational and informative DVD. Bravo.",1412985600,,1704,4.335423197492163
8511959,5,B0077PBQ4A,"This is a great documentary on the life and anatomy of the largest predator on planet earth,the massive Sperm whale. If you love whales at all you cannot go wrong with this program.",1393718400,,181,4.515151515151516
8511960,5,B0077PBQ4A,Inside Nature's Giants: Sperm Whale was awesome!!!  When else would you get the chance to get up close and personal with such a giant!!!  Seriously the best documentary. One night I was watching PBS and caught the end of the episode and wanted to know more!!  So glad I ordered the Dvd.,1370390400,,286,4.461538461538462
8511961,4,B0077PBQ4A,"Perhaps because the whale was so big, and they had a limited amount of time for the dissection, but I felt like this episode was not as thorough as other episodes of Inside natures Giants.  They spent much more time discussing and showing live whales in the wild than discussing the physiology of the actual dissected whale.  It was worth the $9 I spent, since my 9yr old son and I enjoyed watching it together, but I wish it had been a two hour episode.",1355616000,2,454,4.329411764705882
8511962,4,B0077PBQ4A,Awesum movie recommend to anyone who likes to know about sperm whales certainly gives me more of an insight how these great leviathians of the deep exist,1343433600,,153,4.703703703703703
