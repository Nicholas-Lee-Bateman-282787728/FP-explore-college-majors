What really sets 'Un Trio Inseparable' apart, however, is the way Roberto Borell adds value by taking the time to explain the spirit of the dance. The DVD isn't as mechanical is most other instructional DVDs that are only concerned with the technicalities of the turn patterns.

He starts with danzon. Having established the basic idea of dancing the danzon, he moves on to son cubano and cha-cha-cha. In doing so, he clearly illustrates the fascinating fact that they're all related to one another. The cha-cha-cha evolved from son cubano, which in turn evolved from danzon. To me, this puts them into perspective and it helped me understand why they are danced the way they're danced. Now, that's something that almost never happens in salsa DVDs!

The only drawback I can think of is that the lessons are brief. You'll learn the basic movement, the basic turns and... uhh... that's it.",1315267200,,1051,4.795580110497237
