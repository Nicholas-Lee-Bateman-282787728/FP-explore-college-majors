8344695,5,B001URA610,"While I agree  with the 1st customer who said Eric Shaeffer is an egotistical jerk ( he is).  The reason why every  single woman should see this series ( which I saw on SHOWTIME and SEASON 2 ( also on SHOWTIME) is to pay attention to the way Eric Shaeffer acts so you can AVOID men of his kind and not let someone like him jerk you around.  First off, Eric is not interested in the women he approaches. He is a total narcissist.  This is a red flag ladies.  If a guy is rushing the conversation or asking you sexual questions shortly after meeting him- walk away.  If you don't answer, the jerk will say you are closed minded or frigid.  E.S. acts this way in series 1. With every interaction with the women he encounters on his book tour, he reveals himself to be shallow and unable to relate to women.  I feel sorry for him.  He is not a man- he is a mental and  emotional stunted boy.  His mother talks about his astrology chart and we are told he is an Aquarius.  He seems only capable of mental and verbal masturbation when it comes to dealing with women.  His ""requirements"" for finding a suitable woman for marriage are ridiculous.  He thinks he is funny and cute with his witty banter, sadly it  just further reveals his lack of integrity and respect for women.  What is even sadder is the way some of the women  he meets in SEASON 1 ( and SEASON 2) are willing to rip off their clothes and engage instantly in kinky sex acts in an effort to date him ( with the hope he will want to marry them).  His rapid -fire questions towards any new woman he encounters just seals the deal that Eric Shaeffer is serious lacking the key ingredient to finding love- patience.  Interest, genuine caring and concern is the way to find someone to love.  Title of this series should be "" PLEASE DON'T DATE ME- I'M A JERK"".  Yes I can believe your still single.  Eric Shaeffer will probably end up buying a wife from some third world country- then he will criticize her for not speaking English  without an accent.  Eric calls him self ""sensitive""- No! he's just another narcissist.  Good luck Eric- you're gonna need it.",1246060800,11,2111,4.335038363171355

Don't waste you're money on this DVD unless you're entertained by men with the emotional maturity of children.",1242000000,5,194,5.258064516129032
