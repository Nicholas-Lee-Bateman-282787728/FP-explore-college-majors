1823910,4,B000083C6D,"Secret NASA Transmissions: The Smoking Gun is certainly an interesting video, purportedly showing two kinds of unexplained light anomalies above the earth.  These aren't just any old pictures and videos; these come right from NASA footage of space shuttle missions in the late 1990s.  The title is an obvious attempt to get people's attention, as, obviously, these aren't secret transmissions at all.  Martyn Stubbs, a cable access company manager in Vancouver, was able to tape earth-shuttle transmissions directly from a satellite feed.  As he poured over untold hours of the footage, he quickly noticed the appearance of spherical objects, sometimes in significant number, on a number of occasions.  These make for some rather striking images, as the objects are seen to perform some virtually impossible movements, including instantaneous 90 degree turns and incredibly fast movement in any given direction.  You may have seen some of this shuttle mission footage on television shows such as Sightings several years ago.  In one case, an object is seen to make a sudden turn in the opposite direction just before two beam-like images flash across the screen at its old position, leading to speculation that this remarkable video could perhaps show a UFO darting away from an earthbound laser beam attack of some sort.  Oddly enough, this particular footage, which I found truly memorable, is little more than mentioned over the course of this documentary's 90 minutes.  There's much more where that came from, though.

The video revolves around two different types of anomalies - the mysterious spheres that a number of astronauts have witnessed and a new type of anomaly that is all but invisible to the naked eye - unless you're an experienced video editor such as Martyn Stubbs.  He knew he was picking up on something, but he really didn't get a good idea of what it was until he began breaking the video down into individual frames.  There, on perhaps one of the sixty frames making up each second, he discovered what can only be described as streaks of light.  These things move so incredibly fast that it's impossible to even conjecture what they could be, but Stubbs found them all over the place - not only on his downloaded footage from different shuttle missions but even on a CNN broadcast of a live spacewalk.  I wouldn't go so far as to call these extraterrestrial life forms, but there is something there we definitely don't understand.  NASA experts will readily talk about the spherical objects (which have been seen by astronauts as far back as John Glenn), seemingly in love with their ice particles explanation despite the fact it's been readily disproved, but almost no one even wants to be in the room when the second type of phenomena are discussed (one of the Hubble big kahunas literally got up and left when the subject was raised).  They're really aren't any answers on this video, just questions of the most intriguing kind.

The Secret NASA Transmissions: The Smoking Gun is really quite impressive for what is basically a low-budget video.  The introductory material manages to take us from the start of man's fascination with the skies all the way to the space shuttle in mere minutes - and it does so quite effectively.  The overall format can be a little tiresome, however.  I wanted to go ahead and see the footage, but I had to be content with short samples coinciding with Stubbs' explanation of what he saw and what he has done in order to try and understand what the anomalous objects might be.  Finally, after an hour, the viewer is treated to the raw footage - not only of strange sightings from shuttle missions but several videos taken by Russian cosmonauts, as well.  Stubbs is an engaging fellow (he sort of reminds me of the long-haired guy on The Lone Gunmen), but it's the raw footage that really matters here - and it's definitely unusual enough to merit attention.",1152403200,,3917,4.8940998487140694
1823911,4,B000083C6D,"I watched the DVD with great interest. I had approached NASA to verify if the information contained in the DVD was authentic. I am waiting for a reply. Three points I will make with regards to the materials:

1. Official NASA explanations

According to the DVD the material which slowed down and shot back immediately after a glow was seen was described as ice crystals. This explanation cannot be tenable because:

a) Ice crystals do not slow down suddenly as there is little friction in space
b) If the glow is the Shuttle's engines firing, this would have melted the ice, not turn it back.

I am not a scientist, but the explanations I just gave above was from common sense. Furthermore when the tether experiment failed, moving circular objects were seen in the distance hovering over the broken tether. The explanation given by NASA was that they were debris. The rotating debris did not behave like normal debris floating in space.

2. The Explanation given by UFO buffs:

Martin Stubbs and Birdsall believe that the objects described above are intelligent beings. It is true that the behaviour of these objects in space were unusual...but to conclude that these are aliens or intelligent life-forms is far-fetched.

3. A more objective opinion?

I don't buy NASA's explanations nor the UFO buffs'. The truth lies somewhere in between. These objects could a be a result of phenomenon which Man has yet to identify and discover. Why do unusual objects have to imply alien life forms? Alternative explanations should be sought. My opinion is that the DVD highlights phenomenon which needs scientific research. Skeptics should not deny that these objects may display signs of intelligence and UFO buffs should not be quick to conclude that these are aliens! What both camps can agree on is that science needs to advance further and examine what these objects are. Maybe then both camps can converge.

Furthermore: I do not believe for one moment that NASA is covering up evidence of alien/intelligent life. See my rebiew of the book, 'The Sirius Mystery', by Robert Temple.

Finally: The DVD has uncovered interesting material and should be of interest to scientists and non-scientists alike.

I find it more than humurous how some folks can't take a couple of minutes to look at the other theory or theories relating to this so called Proof of an ""Un-Known"" lifeform floating around our planet. The 1st rule of the Gub-Ments policy on aliens- ala project Grudge and Blue-book=""If they really are ""alien"" life-forms or space-craft of some kind caught on NASA footage, do you really think for one minute, no make that one second that we/us-YOU would be watching it?...... in other words, if that footage was genuine in any way, the lid would have been slammed on it a long time ago, don't get me wrong this isn't feeding into some ""cover-up"" nonsense, it's just well.....perfect sense, don't let your emotions or belief systems get into the way of the obvious.

1823913,5,B000083C6D,"First off, do NOT purchase the DVD version of this show because the transfer absolutely sucks.  It is too dark and a green tint screws up the space footage.  I've spoken to the manufacturer of the disc a few years ago about fixing the problem, but they still have not gotten around to making the DVD as good as the video.

As for the two negative reviews posted, ignore them.  They do not know what they're talking about.  The phenomena in this video's footage is NOT ice crystals or dust or easily explainable things, this is true non-terrestrial life that exists both in the atmosphere of our planet and out in space around it.  I've known about these creatures for many, many years from passing remarks told to me from relatives and various friend's who had family working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.  Everything concerning them was very hush hush.  Gladly this video was released to support Space Phenomena 1 & 2's existence.  The best footage on the whole tape is the massive congregation of Space Phenomena 1 around the broken STS satellite tether.  After you view this tape, you'll have a new understanding of space itself.  That it has never been a void of life, but is actually a vast sea of life, full of creatures we know nothing about.  Now it is up to NASA to stop hiding from the truth and get a branch of xenobiology going to study these lifeforms.",1138492800,,1383,4.5772357723577235
1823914,5,B000083C6D,"It's a bit long winded and technically dull. It isn't an action packed UFO thriller designed to entertain you and it isn't a big budget film. It's not intended to be.

This is a documentary. Much of the footage consists of NASA's own video feed from various space flights, being transmitted back to earth in real time. Anyone carrying on that this video is a waste and/or contains no ""proof"" must fall into one of two catagories.

In the first catagory are those that were expecting to see some ""huge, UFO break-through"" like a space ship landing on the White House lawn with aliens stepping out saying ""Take me to your leader!"" and being dissappointed can't be bothered trying to understand the very dry facts being explained and so just blow it all off as a waste of thier time.

In the second catagory are those that as they began to understand what this video proves, had a fight or flight response to sudden fear and must dissmiss the evidence as ""space dust"" or ""whatever"", in order to maintain thier rationalized view of a reality in which all is well. (By the way... many in this catagory are unaware of this automatic response.)

This video proves the existance of an ""unknown and intelligent"" life form! Even I was unaware of them until I watched this video. It's not as glamorous as seeing proof that ""Gray"" aliens exist but does fully document and prove the existance of more than one type of E.T.!

Want icing on the cake? NASA doesn't deny it, nor can they explain it! The same goes for the Russian Space Agency.

You don't need to take my word for it......",1126483200,,1571,4.53356890459364
1823915,1,B000083C6D,"First off the title of this video is misleading, these transmissions are not secret, and as the guy who discovered the anomalies says, they can be picked up by anyone with a satellite dish.
Second, there is nothing in this video to hint at or suggest that the objects are alien or otherworldy, although the program might lead you to that conclusion. In fact, there is nothing to even suggest that these phenomenon are anything more than dust, debris, ice, rock, satellites, etc. floating around in earth's orbit. These objects do not deviate from a path, nor move in zig-zags. There is one scene where they erroneously claim an object moves, but they blatantly ignore the fact that the camera is moving not the object!
I give this video decent marks for some interesting NASA footage displaying some anomolous objects whizzing by. But I subtract points for them trying to make this into a conspiracy video displaying proof of a cover-up when in fact there is zero evidence that the objects in their footage are anything substantial.
I would pass on this one, as there are much better videos out there on UFO's, with much better footage.",1073865600,,1136,4.771573604060913

Considering it was made in 2000, you would think the transfer would be decent, obviously not. When Martin Stubbs is being interviewed, the colors don't look right and very grainy picture. Cheap cameras have been used to film this documentary. Some of the nasa clips downloaded by Martin to video via satellite who has recorded every mission since the early nineties is of low quality. Dont expect the original nasa footage, this is vhs quality that is 2nd or 3rd generation copy.

7978603,1,B000083C6D,"I don't consider myself a total skeptic, in fact there was an instance in my youth that I can't explain to this day so I might be better termed as cautiously optimistic that someday proof will emerge.  That day was not today for a variety of reasons.  Perhaps most of which could be called technicalities.
The first and most telling for occurred a few times but a good representation is at 14:45.  Here's the thing.  The gentlemen tells us he has 25+ years in video,  His qualifications as a video/film reviewer and editor would seem impeccable.  Call me nitpicking, but I do know from experience that when you store magnetic tape, video tape in the manner he has stored them, they degrade very rapidly.  And, a lot of that degradation comes in the form of little glitches and things that can look very much like the examples he wished to point out.
I know, you ask what my own experience and qualifications are.  Nothing compared to his, I am sure.  Just lot of years working around the video industry mainly as a warehouse man and ersatz technician for people in the wholesale and retail video tape industry.  People with a monetary interest in reserving videotape in the best condition possible.  One of the main things I regularly told clients was to never, ever store video tapes flat and atop or below another videotape.  As several of his are apparently placed.  Magnetic tape is simply very fragile and prone to distortion when in the presence of other magnetic media.
Even so, this is not a smoking gun.  Maybe he simply grabbed all the tapes he had collected and tossed them together quickly for the movie.  Call it strike one.

Strike two would be the lack of some pertinent information.  While it is good to know he has an extensive background in the video world, knowing a few things about his controls and methodology would have gone a lot further for me.  For instance, and again referring to the portion showing his tapes etc, how many video machines were being used to review these downloads?  Were transfers done at any point and how many machines were used for these transfers?
Again I know this comes across as picking at nits, but I am well aware as he should be well aware that any distortion created at any point in a duplication process will at least be repeated if not amplified the more duplications made.  Again a technicality, but without more information, I am left to assume he could have been using a single machine for all work done and even the tiniest glitch in the machine itself will repeat over and over until cleared by a good cleaning or other means.
There are a few other issues concerning what we were not told as well,but the above might be the main one for me.

Strike three is a combination of a couple of things I seem to come across often in these movies and something that would not exist in a real scientific study.  Like Bigfoot pictures, UFO pictures always seem to be at least slightly out of focus, grainy, of with something just not quite right.  Often perspective comes into play as well as background and lighting.  I saw nothing that didn't have at least one just as plausible explanation.  For me that is the beginning of the swing for that third strike.  Not that it might have another explanation, but that it does have at least one other...just...as...plausible....explanation.  A smoking gun means there can be no other  PLAUSIBLE explanation.  Merely saying you don't think ice crystals can do what the video shows is happening does not prove that ice crystals can not do that.  It leaves the ice crystals within the realm of plausibility.
And, that brings me to the second half a strike three where he goes around in a circle and the ump gives him the thumb.  Over and over he presents information that can have at least two and usually more plausible explanations and tries to present it as only having one possible explanation.  Good scientific method would have been to debunk any other explanation rather than merely saying this MUST be what was going on.  ""Glenn's Butterflys"" is maybe the best example from this movie.
What pertinence does a NASA spokesman stating that for a time they wondered if those might have been aliens have to proving they are aliens?  For a time I thought I was Mr. Awesome but with enough rejection by enough cute girls I realized there must be an alternate definition.  Does the fact I just stated that suddenly elevate me to Mr. Awesome?  Doubtful but I might give a flirt shortly to find out. If it does, I will come back and adjust this review.
Further, what is the point in the vocal quotes every time you say Glenn's Butterflies?  This is yet another common factor in these conspiracy theories.  Like a dog finding a good bone, latch on and wag your head to show the world THAT bone and how you dug it out when no one else seems to be noticing it.  It does nothing for investigatory integrity.  In fact, for anyone that can understand simple use of propaganda, it does the opposite.  A lie often repeated loudly enough will start to appear as truth to the masses.  In this case highlighting Glenn's Butterflies so often tells me you don't want anyone to doubt your explanation because you know there are other just as PLAUSIBLE explanations.  Or, quite possibly more plausible explanations.

All in all this movie is full of things that simply can't pass the litmus test of good science and effort to explain things well.  My own qualifications does not make me an expert in the handling of magnetic tape.  But, even if considered a layman, I know NOT to do things he did.  An experiment is only considered a success if it can be repeated with the same results and all results being clear and unambiguous.  Leaving highly plausible explanations out there is not clear and unambiguous.  Just like my uses of caps when and where I did, using basic propaganda techniques does not make something true or false.  It merely clouds the issue.  I did so to illustrate that point when you got to the above statement.  I have seen and scoffed at enough conspiracy theories to strongly believe that any time someone latches onto something that firmly, they are trying very hard to obscure things that might be close by.
All in all, sorry but this movie fails on all fronts at offering anything vaguely conclusive.  Except that I can positively conclude that these folks are charlatans at worst and perhaps deluded at best.",1494374400,,6413,4.629203539823009
7978604,2,B000083C6D,"At the end there is some interesting footage but for the most part, it just seemed long and repetitive throughout the presentation.",1488240000,,131,5.0
7978605,5,B000083C6D,"The NASA footage in this documentary was provided by Martyn Stubbs, who worked as a satellite television manager. Stubbs stumbled upon an unencrypted NASA broadcast and noticed that there was a lot of strange activity surrounding the NASA missions that was not being shown to the public. He started recording the transmissions to VHS and went on to archive and study over 2,500 hours of intercepted raw footage.

The documentary is aimed at a mature open-minded viewer and does not try to spoon feed its audience an opinion. It doesn't sensationalize the material and most of the time just lets the footage speak for itself (which it does in volumes). This is possibly the best video evidence of extraterrestrial activity ever captured thanks to the enormous amount of time and effort Martyn Stubbs has invested into making it public.

Some of the UFOs shown are immediately obvious such as the ""shooting stars"" often captured in the background making intelligent manoeuvres and travelling in formation. I think most viewers will grasp that shooting stars are incapable of making sharp 90 degree turns at a high velocity. It's fairly easy to establish that these objects involve highly advanced technology that we are currently incapable of. When one such craft appears near to the crew on a spacewalk an astronaut reports its presence in a concerned manner but NASA headquarters routinely tell the crew to ignore it and carry on with the operation. This indicates that they are not part of the NASA mission and even the astronauts are not at liberty to discuss their rather obvious presence.

The documentary also introduces us to another phenomenon that astronauts have described as ""space critters"" or ""fireflies"" and something even more bizarre which is described here as ""phenomena three"" or the ""second space phenomena"". This documentary presents a wealth of new and groundbreaking footage which would keep any intelligent viewer interested for the duration.",1405728000,,1964,5.150470219435737

7978607,5,B000083C6D,"I have watched this footage via you-tube many times and find it absolutely fascinating and addictive viewing. However, having just seen the cover for the first time (I had no idea this was available to buy on dvd) I am a little concerned that Martyn Stubbs is listed as an Actor ?!? So much hard work has gone into presenting this evidence as fact and then it tells me he's an actor ? what about all that '20 years running a public-access cable station - a highly priveledged position' ???

Anyways, I just want to say that despite this discrepancy the footage does speak for itself on more than one level. Even if you dismiss all of the orbs, the flashing lights, the coloured streaky 3rd phenomena, and the fact that NASA astronauts and controllers from Earth describe these phenomena and warn space-walkers when they are being approached by these objects (all visible and caught on camera), even if you dismiss all of these elements of the footage - it is still gives amazing insight into the kind of incompetence NASA are displaying during our travels in space. Had any of you heard that a 100 Billion dollar, twelve mile long 'Tether' was lost in space ? Even if you ignore all the phenomena that show such a keen interest in this object as it slowly drifts from NASA'a control into the abyss - it is good to know where all those tax dollars went, right ?

The one point that really keeps me thinking is that the orbs NEVER TOUCH ANYTHING. they never collide with each other OR the equipment they are in proximity to, and they change direction even when the camera is NOT zooming. This is one characteristic of this phenomena which I have not seen an explanation for. It's like a paradox - on the one hand these objects seem to be attracted to NASA equipment and even astronauts but on the other they do not make contact with anything. Surely, surely if these things are ice crystals or 'debris' we would see at least ONE collision ??",1329350400,,1939,4.505681818181818
7978608,1,B000083C6D,"1. INTRODUCTION

  Never before have I been so appalled at how deluded, degraded, deceived, and utterly embarrrassing, an analysis can be, except with those ""rods,"" and the pathetic balloons of Mexico, which also must someday become remembered as the lowest point in UFO history, and the mark of some kind of mass hysteria, or mass delusion, where people seem willing to believe anything.

  Never before have I agreed with the phrase, ""I want those 2 hours of my life back,"" someone says when he sees a bad movie.
  I truly knew the meaning of that phrase with this farce of all things intelligent.

2. F' ALL EVIDENCE.

  The fact he calls these phenomenon spheres is indicative of his thoroughness and discernment.
  Never is there a sphere.
  Even worse, there is never any clear flat circle. There are just countless out of focus, over-exposed (therefore apparently enlarged) blurs that at no time (but one) change course or speed. You can clearly see the unmistakable look of being out of focus some of them have, indicating how small and close these ice fragments or particles are, set aglow by the overexposure.
  This is how much definition this sad character has.
  More alarming, is this dude IS intelligent, and more thorough than 100 men put together, in his amassing of videos.
  Most alarming is that many scientists have seen it, he said, and not one thought it was natural!!?!?! Someone advised him: duplicate it. Find more evidence. And his aghast reaction to it: Yep, sure enough, it was always there.

3. THE SMOKING DUM

  These ""spheres"" clearly going in front of and behind the space shuttle tether clearly means he hasn't the first understanding of photography, as demonstrated in the moon landings conspiracy: as over exposure can erase a cross-hair, or brightness of the moon obsure the stars, the overwhelming brightness of the tether makes some blurs appear to go behind. Hither and thither, feather and tether - in the heather.

4. FLASHING COLOURED LIGHTS

 1) When a hatch to the spacecraft got stuck, this guys insists these flashes gather always when something is happening, as with the satellite tether breaking. This is just below the bottom of irrationality. They happen because that is when the camera is on! It is truly that simple.
  At the point of the hatch, they show 3 or so photos, each with a different light streak in a different place.
  At this point, does this give your instincts, or just intelligence, a creepy weird feeling that something is very wrong? Like you are talking to someone who is from a mental hospital?

5. THE NEXT MISTAKE

  He was surprised NASA gave no resistance to him downloading all their videos of this guff.
  What also killed me was he never took it to either a photography or optical expert, or a film expert. Obviously the first answer may lie there.
  But you haven't seen the video footage of the hatch, yet, when he is so convincinly explaining. Finally, at the end, you do. It dawned on me straight away. Of course, it's video. You can't mistake the scratches or flashes. This was the final evidence which committed this crazy. They don't even have to be particles. So the flashes may all be film scratches. Wow. Or, ironically, particiles on the video.
  I felt like I was watching Play School. It was one of the lowest points of Earth. Not the highest like he says.

  Along this solo journey where the only other person who speaks besides the invisible interviewer is some wild-looking Russian Australian in charge of a new telescope or something in the outback to back him up, he never indicates what these spheres and flashes logically can be in the real world, so carefully investigated, he has separated them into two separate phenomena.
  If I didn't know better, I'd say this is either one of those April Fool pranks, or a true farce to test how gullible people are. It is brilliant in one of those categories of phenomena.
  The use of this film becomes one other: to show how deceived or influenced a person can become, even with the most simple and obvious of things.
  What's so hard to understand about all the satellite debris, meterorites, or particles of ice?

  Even the title is crap: Secret NASA Transmissions. There is nothing secret. It's false as well.

  Lucky I spent just 5 box on this in the bargain Cheap as Chips store, which is an insult itself. The pic quality was excellent on that though - apart from the videos.

6. DISCREDITS

EBE Award Winner! Best Film - International UFO Congress Film Festival.
The favorite among astronauts. What clip, or idea, exactly was he referring to? Doesn't mean a thing either, except those as well makes my faith in humanity lessen a bit and my faith in apes increase.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Also, of course, as with most of the bogus UFO TV productions or whatever similar company it is, they have no idea how to put the DVD together in an ordered, logical (no surprises there) way.
  Instead of having the mild madman rave on about one particular video and THEN show that video, while he is quiet, hopefully, then go back to him for the next, they just have him raving for half an hour, now and again interspersing confused video bits in a messy way with no explanation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  By the way, those famous firelies of John Glen in space were just natural too, not mysterious or living things this guy believes are still an ongoing mystery. It was the first orbital flight in space and Glen didn't understand what was going on there.
  They were proved to be tiny white pieces of frost from the side of the spacecraft which had condensed, then released in the sun. Simple.",1311206400,,5837,4.9169230769230765
7978609,5,B000083C6D,"NASA owns footage exposed.. The way the astronauts talk in codes, and MIR astronauts coming out clean about how they have witnessed these objects.  Now if people after these footages and comments from the astrounauts themselves still not believe, I guess just an actual sighting will make them believe.
very intersting how these ice particles that NASA seems to insist on.. all of the sudden speed up and slow down, make turns appear and dissapear in an incredible speed... hmmm  NOT ALL OF THAT ARE ICE PARTICLES or dust in the lenses.. they need to come out clean.  It is very important for us to realize that the government will not come out anytime soon to tell us the Truth.  ""The truth is out there"" and the Nasa footage brings it straight to your tv screen.",1185235200,,764,4.595588235294118
7978610,5,B000083C6D,"First of all, the feeds are live from NASA but they are also being recorded by Martyn Stubbs, a cable access company manager in Vancouver, who uses his own vision mixer to enhance the broadcast at times. While some of the footage is being tweaked, a lot of it remains untouched, except for the fact that the transmission system and recording equipment is very different to the quality of feed NASA was getting and recording. This means that there is some interference present on the tapes that the NASA tapes will not have. Asking us to call video interference space anomalies is far-fetched. However it does show some obvious artefacts that are not part of the feed but are in space and moving. These lights all have the same characteristics. They reflect light and they move in a straight line. The only light not to move in a straight line is one sequence which shows a light suddenly change angle. However this light is entering the upper atmosphere of our planet which can create this skipping stone effect. Other than this, all of the lights are moving in a straight line. Some fast, some slow, but they all follow a straight line. Between space debris and just particles of ice in space this stuff does not seem impressive enough to warrant anything other than what NASA calls ice particles, space debris and meteorites. I would expect this stuff to be there and so, hey presto, here it is caught on camera when the sun is shining on them. And in every instance it is precisely the sun or moon-glow which illuminates these objects. Given that we currently monitor 150,000 pieces of space trash, some about 6cm wide, that meteorites do enter out atmosphere, that moon-glow and the sun causes reflection on ice particles, why do we need to explain these artefacts as signs of intelligent life? The scientific answer is that we do not have to do this to understand what they are. Nobody in NASA is phased by this stuff. There are many scientists who describe what these are and have always gone on the record saying they are ice crystals, debris or meteorites. Instead this DVD just asks some new SETI director to comment and he starts yaking about a conspiracy against planet Earth. I am sorry but the UFO explanation is not in the least bit scientific. Think of Sherlock Holmes.

Interesting footage of ice crystals, space debris and meteorites though.",1154217600,,2358,4.695652173913044
