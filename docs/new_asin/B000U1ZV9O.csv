Instead of Disc 2 being of episodes 8 through 13, they were again of episodes 1 through 7 (even though on the disc it said it was disc two with episodes 8-13). I was very disappointed. Like I said, I bought it twice from the same retailer and both had to be returned due to this defect. From what I saw of the first disc, I loved it! I just want a complete version!!",1200614400,16,519,4.098039215686274

8211905,4,B000U1ZV9O,"Really enjoyed this series, from what I can view. The only complaint, is that I seem to have purchased a defective disc, several of the episodes will not play. Next time I'll I pay the extra money and buy a new DVD set.",1475107200,,219,4.116279069767442
8211906,3,B000U1ZV9O,"I purchased this 2-DVD set used ""very good"" for about 5 bucks including shipping. It has mostly black/white photos and videos, but there are some in color as well. The narration is informative and pleasant to listen to.  The music is fine. The footage is good quality, and the narration matches the footage.  However, sometimes it is difficult to tell if the footage is really related to the narration. It is produced by the BBC, so it does have a British bias.

Unfortunately, some topics are repeated multiple times:

For example, the destruction of the heavy water facility in Norway (Vemork Hydroelectric Plant) was repeated 5 times: one time in the SOE episode, second time in Paras/Commandos episode, third time in Norwegian Resistance Fighters episode, and 2 more times (can't remember episode names).

Another example of repetition is the destruction of the German battleship Tirpitz.  It was repeated 3 times: one time in Norwegian Resistance Fighters episode, second time in The Royal Navy episode, and one more episode (can't remember its name).

Here is a listing of episodes:

DISC 1, side A
Waffen-SS
Special Operations Executive [SOE]
SAS [Special Air Service]
The Desert Rats

DISC 1, side B
The Free Polish Forces
RAF Fighter Command
The Paras and Commandos

DISC 2, side A
Norwegian Resistance Fighters
The Kamikaze
The Royal Navy

DISC 2, side B
The Chindits
The Free French Forces
The Anzacs

I wanted to rent this DVD set from Netflix first; they had it listed in their catalog, but it was not available to rent (probably lost/damaged).  I've rented DVDs from the same producer over time, but didn't realize that they were all related.  Related DVD sets include:

8211910,3,B000U1ZV9O,"Bottom line: from what I hear from my Moms - great series, but bad product QA and purchase experience.

I ordered this DVD set for my Polish migr mother whose father fought with the Free Polish Army while she, her sister, and her mother were stuck behind lines first by the German occupation and then by the Soviet ""liberation"". She had watched the series on BBC America, really enjoyed it, and wanted a copy for her grandkids to see. Unfortunately, her DVD set lacked a copy of the double-sided DVD #1, and instead it contained two copies of the double-sided DVD #2. Especially unfortunate, DVD #2 doesn't have the episode she especially wanted, the Free Polish Forces episode. She called the good folks at Amazon and her understanding was that she couldn't get a replacement because she wasn't the purchaser. Sigh - this had to be a communication fail, I can't believe Amazon's policy wouldn't let her get a replacement. So, my 82 year old, 20th-century mother waited until she saw me in the flesh and blood (once a year occasion) to give me the DVD and tell me this story. I called Amazon, but their policy wouldn't let them send Moms a replacement DVD set since more than a year had gone by. Policy would allow me to pack the DVD myself, pay to mail it to Amazon, and then maybe get a $6.00 refund. As an ex-accountant, I totally understand Amazon's business need to put a time limit on their returns exposure. Point of this story - if you order this package for a Greatest Generation member, then confirm with them early that they got all 4 DVD sides.",1320624000,,1556,4.537366548042705
