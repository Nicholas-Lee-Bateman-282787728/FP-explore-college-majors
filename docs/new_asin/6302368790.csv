456702,2,6302368790,"This is a movie for car guys.  There are two bitchin' cars in this movie and you must be a car guy to appreciate them.  The first is a very well built T-bucket (a T-bucket is a Ford Model T from the '20s which has been made into a hot rod) powered by a Buick nail head engine with 6 carburetors.  The other car is a beautiful '59 Buick convertible.  To most people these are just old or weird cars, but car guys would flip out when they see them.  I know I did.
The movie itself is nothing special.  It looks like it was shot in a week with a budget of $100.00.  The plot of this movie is very simplistic.  You have 5 teenagers, ages 16 to 18, who go around stripping cars and selling the parts to a low-life junk yard owner.  The police set up a sting and catch them in the act.  One of the kids has a gun and he kills a cop.  The movie ends with an exchange of gunfire and two dead kids and two dead junk yard men.  The rest of the kids are arrested and escorted to a jail.
To give you an idea how low the budget was for this movie the only car you see being stripped is an old Kaiser.  They smash the windows, take the radio and battery and torch off the exhaust system.  The car is pushed onto its side to better access the exhaust system.  The next car they're to strip is the beautiful '59 Buick mentioned earlier in this review.  Since the budget is so small they don't dare destroy this beautiful car.  They show the bottom of the already stripped Kaiser tilted onto its side and we are supposed to believe it's the expensive Buick convertible.  There are other things in this movie which make you break into laughter.  For cover, the kids ride around in a live poultry truck.  When they get to the next car to strip they unload some of the caged chickens to get their chop equipment.  Also, the kid in the T-bucket is a spotter who looks for trouble and warns the others with a giant bread sized walkie-talkie.
This movie is somewhat entertaining even though it was shot on a shoe string.  The DVD quality is not the best.  I don't think the quality of the film used to make the transfer to the DVD was very good to begin with.  Only car guys would like this movie.  Most people would consider it a piece of junk, although I just saw it on AMC.  This is an American classic?  It's a fun movie though, and entertaining.",1014076800,9,2327,4.113333333333333
456703,1,6302368790,"This movie is a Juvenile Delinquent classic, but  its such a poorly made DVD it's a cryin' shame. The print is the worst I've ever seen, looking like it was put through a Cuisinart. The Chapter Search doesn't even have titles, like the distributor was too busy  to bother working on this disc and getting it right. Get the Something Weird DVD instead.",1005004800,4,351,4.555555555555555

456758,3,6302368790,"A movie so bad it's good?  Well, this one almost makes it. But let's try to
be a bit positive. Arch Hall Sr. introduces the film in a voice-over
that expresses concern about juvenile delinquency. As a fictional broadcast
reporter, Hall had a fine voice, and deserves credit for at least starting the film on a higher plane. Lines like ""his brain hasn't caught up with his biceps""
are priceless, though.  And character actor Tom Brown makes what I think is his
final film appearance. Another character actor Bruno Vesota plays the junkyard
owner and does well with what he has to work with. Deserving much credit is the
jazz oriented score of the film, created by Al Pelagrini, who was associated with
Mel Torme for a time. Arch Hall Jr.'s songs sound incredibly amateurish compared
with the finely crafted score. The cast playing Junior Hall's gang aren't bad
with the blond one, nearly 30 but not looking it.  Wonder what they look like now?

Anybody know which DVD is the most complete ??",1371513600,,990,4.672413793103448

456760,4,6302368790,"A quick look at what the mainstream tried to portray hot rodders as.  I saw this at the drive in as a teenager, loved the cars, acting was so so, but the fun part was how Hollywood was trying to show America what us rodders were really like - a total joke, but that's Hollywood.  Nothing has changed, those that know nothing about anything telling us what it really is, regardless of the topic.",1305417600,3,394,4.3108108108108105
456761,3,6302368790,"Daddy Arch Hall provided junior with the dead presidents for this DOA jd disaster.  Showcasing sonny's nonexistent skills as an actor and singer/songwriter, this unintentional spoof sports a sixth-grade script and rum-dum direction.  The VHS sleeve promises trampy babes, biker gang rumbles, and major racketeering.  Instead, the flick has girl-next-door types, polo-shirted and even suit-clad teens in one hot rod and a chicken truck, and a fat slob and old geezer in a rundown car-parts lot.  Corny social commentary and clueless cops complete the mix, making for a (truly) cheap thrills fun fest.",1027468800,,599,5.408602150537634
456762,3,6302368790,This is a great cheesy movie (very much along the lines of Hot Rod Girl). Lots of unintentional bad acting and dialogue. Arch Hall Jr. and his buds are teenage car choppers - with guns! Who would have thought that the seats in cars would be worth so much money... Very enjoyable if you like this kind of stuff.,1015200000,2,310,4.271186440677966

7824989,5,6302368790,"Marianne Gaba is 110 in the shade.

Marianne Gaba is reason enough alone to buy and watch this movie.  She will definitely appeal to any normal, healthy, male. She was Miss Illinois USA 1957 and Playboy magazine's Playmate of the Month for its September 1959 issue.

Otherwise, this is still a good movie.  It's your basic criminal juvenile delinquent story that proves once again, as Sherlock Holmes taught us, ""The weed of crime bears a bitter fruit"".

My only criticism of this DVD is that it was not burned on M-DISC.  I understand that obscure movies like this may not justify pressing a disk.  I would have gladly paid $1.50 more to have a 1000 year lifetime M-DISC, instead the movie was burned on old-fashioned, obsolete, lasts only about 5-7 years, dye-type DVD-R.",1465257600,2,773,4.7669172932330826
