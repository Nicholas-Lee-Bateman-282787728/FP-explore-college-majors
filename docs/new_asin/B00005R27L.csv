7951540,4,B00005R27L,"I didn't expect this movie to be that good and only got the movie because Camilla belle was in it. To my surprise, this movie was actually pretty good. I've been wanting to watch it again but haven't had any time.",1363996800,,213,4.219512195121951
7951541,1,B00005R27L,"The gist of this story is that the ""good"" sorcerer defeats the ""bad sorcerer"".  If you can buy into the idea that the ""good"" sorcerer could unlock a jail cell by passing his hand over the lock and that the ""bad"" one could look into a well and then sort of melt into it, then this is your movie.  I wish I could say that these were the only ridiculous parts of the movie, but they were not.  I don't have a problem with sorcery in a fantasy world like the Lord of the Rings, but this movie was set in modern-day Bolivia and it was not a bit believable.",1344124800,,551,3.9909090909090907
7951542,1,B00005R27L,"If this story were not so off-the-wall and the main girl not so obnoxious, it might have worked. As it is, it's just weird and annoying. Don't get this movie.",1316131200,,158,4.3
7951543,5,B00005R27L,"This is a hauntingly enigmatic film set in the mystic culture and scenery of the andes and it's beautiful indiginous people. You can inhale the scent of south america, it's intricate society based on family love and wholesome values with a  deep spiritual underpinning. A beautifully woven tale of each person's value in society and their basic need to find and fullfill their own detsiny and the true power that lies within themselves as they realise their own life lessons. A quest for materialism, power and pride quickly dissolves as the children delve deeper into the true heart and soul of their quest which is eternal and true.",1229817600,,634,4.87037037037037
7951544,4,B00005R27L,"This movie is a fantasy about a supposed ancient relec that enables one to see into the future.  I think it is a good example of how the Church's priest tried to maintain his faith while at the same time understanding the ""primitive"" superstitions of many of the local people in Bolivia/Peru.  Diana learns some of the local folklore and finds the artifact and uses it to help her dad save his expedition from being shut down for lack of funding.  One would probably have to watch the movie several times to understand all the spiritual implications.  It is a kid's movie, so the story isn't that great, but it gives parents a good opportunity to discuss spiritual matters with their children.",1179878400,,693,4.655737704918033
7951545,2,B00005R27L,"It would be difficult to formulate a coherent film composed of the disparate elements that the director and others obviously felt obliged to include within this scenario, but a worthy attempt is made, only falling apart after the first half. A Pre-Columbian ceremonial disc, golden and bejewelled, has been split asunder, and while one half is displayed in a New York City museum's permanent collection, the other segment has become the subject of a search expedition to an Andean region, under the aegis of American archaeologist Brooks Willings (David Keith), who is obsessed with bringing about its recovery. His wife and daughter have remained in New York but when young Diana (Camilla Belle) has become a disciplinary problem in her school, the two join Brooks in the Andean village where his expedition is based, his wife hoping to correct Diana's behavioural distress, only to be burdened by additional plights originating from their new situation. Continuity falters at this point as Diana becomes enmeshed in village mystic rites, Brooks and his wife (played ably by Nancy Allen) fall into serious marital discord, a Catholic priest, portrayed with humour by John Rhys-Davies is tormented by local cultists, the expedition has developed personnel and funding shortages, et alia, - too many threads to be woven into an accomplished storyline. To solve its many self-imposed conundra, the work lapses into inane fantasy, including silly special effects, as a facile resolution. Keith is wooden, manifestly uninspired by his role, but Belle is effective and the timing of Rhys-Davies is deserving of study, while acting laurels go to the superb East Indian Roshan Seth, who easily dominates each of his scenes in the part of a shaman with extraordinary wisdom and magical powers. Shot in northern Argentina's scenic province of Salta, the picture benefits from both the cinematography of Maximo Munzi and the faithfully ethnic scoring of Luis Bacalov; if only a way had been seen to strengthen the stuttering scenario.",1096070400,,2024,5.230769230769231
