7914488,5,B00000K509,"This documentary still needs to see the light of day for DVD, It's the first documentary to be released after Jim's death and the only one other than Henson's Place that's commercially released. The CNN People Profiles Documentary I thought was the best so far but it's still not released on DVD which it should be. I remember seeing this documentary as a kid on PBS prime time and it's a classic to this day. But unfortunately the VHS release is the only official and legal way to get a copy of it. Some clips in the documentary are poorly edited and dubbed and adding laugh tracks like on the Poison to Posion sketch from Sam & Friends which wasn't including in the original footage. But other then that, the interviews are great. The interviews were longer but were included in other documentaries like ""Muppet Stuff"". It's a great introduction into the life of Jim Henson and I strongly recommended it to Jim Henson historians, Muppet fans, puppetry researchers and even to people who want to learn more about him.",1353974400,,1018,4.661111111111111
7914489,5,B00000K509,"There are two excellent documentaries produced about the life and works of Jim Henson. One is HENSON'S PLACE, a PBS documentary that was released on DVD last year. As great as that one was, it was produced in 1984, so it only goes as far as The Muppets Take Manhattan.

The second documentary is this one. Made a few years after Henson's death, it's more comprehensive, covering even his more offbeat and artistic projects and his earliest works, in addition to a great selection of clips from Sesame Street, The Muppet Show, Fraggle Rock, and the related Muppet movies. It also, of course, covers his passing away, and the events that led up to it.

It's funny, touching, and quite memorable. I hope this documentary also gets a DVD release eventually.",1313366400,,753,4.740458015267175
7914490,5,B00000K509,"What can be said about Jim Henson, that hasn't already been said? I first got hooked on the Muppets during the mid seventies, when as a young sailor in the U.S. Navy, people would gather around my thirteen inch black and white TV just to watch The Muppet Show. To watch a group of young men, laugh and forget their troubles for that half hour was impressive to say the least. That's when I found out there was something magical about him and his creations. Before I even saw this video, I used to tell people that each Muppet had their own idividual personality, and that they could show emotions. Of course, they thought I was nuts. But lo and behold there's Jim Henson in this video pointing out that that by moving his fingers ever so slightly, he could give Kermit a completely different expression. The only drawback was interviewing the Henson kids. I have no respect for Brian Henson, he does not carry the same dedication as his dad did. It's almost as if taking over the Muppets was something he HAD to do. So it was no longer a fun thing, it was more of a job. Over the years they have done nothing of any means to promote the characters. And Gonzo as an alien??? Give me a break. I liked it better when he was just a whatever. So I guess what I'm trying to say is that NOBODY could take Jims place. I hope that he found his Rainbow Connection, wherever he may be. I know that somewhere, somehow, someone is still playing with a Muppet.",1175126400,,1446,4.319852941176471
7914491,5,B00000K509,"How lucky the world was to be blessed with the beautiful, talented, intelligent, creative and innovative artist, Jim Henson.  How many lives did he touch with Sesame Street, the Muppet Show, Fraggle Rock, his films and his unforgettable puppets who live on, today, even though he passed away over ten years ago?  This wonderful documentary takes a warm, honorable and respectful look at Jim Henson, the puppeteer, as well as Jim Henson, the visionary.

We see footage from the early days of Kermit the Frog (on the Jack Paar Show in the 1950s), Jim Henson, himself, featured in sketches during the formative years of Sesame Street, his films, the Muppet Shows and movies, and interviews.  It makes all of us remember what a legacy he has left behind for children, their parents and anyone who grew up watching Sesame Street.  This man was comparable to none, and there will never be anyone like him!  Please see this film.  You will find it as entertaining as it is insightful.  Jim Henson was SO much more than ""the voice of Kermit the Frog.""",1107561600,4,1043,4.723756906077348
7914492,5,B00000K509,"Just owning the video before even watching it made me go crazy jumping up and down, i truly love this man's work. I always admired his creative and imaginitave mind. and watching this video just makes me appreciate his work even more. ONe Thing just made me cry, the memorial of his death, i couldn't help crying. He shall always be of our greatest performers in the world. Thanks always for showing us your world of imagination:)",1038009600,6,430,4.597402597402597
7914493,5,B00000K509,"I've always loved Henson's muppets, fraggles and feature films, but never realized how much else he'd been involved with.  This video has some amazing video clips from Henson's early TV days, his commercials from the 60's, and projects post-sesame that were stunningly creative and beautiful.  I'm a huge fan of Labrynth and Dark Crystal, but hadn't been aware of some of his other projects.
Also, the video is peppered with interviews with friends, family and colleagues that really allow us a view into Henson's world, mind, and heart.",972345600,15,537,5.090909090909091
7914494,5,B00000K509,"This video, first featured on PBS some years ago (1994?) is beautifully  made, and features a great description of Henson's impact on modern  entertainment, from his association with Sesame Street to his early career  to the Muppets and his later projects. It features some delightful musical  clips from his shows (""Moving Right Along"" from The Muppet Movie,  Cantus' song from Fraggle Rock, ""Visit the Moon"", from Sesame  Street, ""It's Not Easy Being Green"", and - of course - ""The  Rainbow Connection"") Most stories about artists tend to be about their  personalities, political views, and love affairs than about how their work  evolved. This is a welcome reversal of that tendency.
However, I have a  gut feeling that the producers could have made a much longer and more  in-depth documentary of his life and work, one which would be greater  inspiration to those who were/are/will be impressed by this amazing man's  life. But at 85 minutes it is the perfect length for children - not just  entertainment, but creative inspiration.",968025600,18,1037,5.059171597633136
7914495,4,B00000K509,This is a great video that showcases Jim and his amazing talent for top notch entertainment. Frank Oz was right in saying that Jim Henson's work would never be finished. Jim's death has left a void in the Henson  company.. this video is a super way to look back and remember the gentle  Genus... Great video...,962236800,4,310,4.517857142857143
7914496,5,B00000K509,"This video offers the audience a glimpse into the life of the late great Jim Henson. It traces his beginnings from his job as a puppeteer on Sam and Friends, through the dozens of commercials and guest spots his Muppets did,  all the way up to the now-recognizable Sesame Street and Muppet Show, with  a hint at his movie and TV-creating genius.  The only sad part about it is  the end. We all know about Henson's untimely death, and to hear his family  talk about it is saddening. Still though, if you are a Henson fan, this is  definitely a must-see.",946857600,6,552,4.415841584158416
