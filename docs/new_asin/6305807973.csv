7895199,5,6305807973,"Bardot in her day was BIGGER than Marliyn Monroe and co.  If the world was in black in white,  than Bardot would be in colour.  Come Dance with me is a who done it movie.  Brigitte plays Virginie.  Her husband is accuesd of murder.  At first when Virgine finds her husband, Herve holding a gun.  Brigitte's facail expressions are so cute.  Virginie later gets the job as a dance teacher at the same dance school where Anita Flores was killed.  Virgine wants to find out who really killed Anita.  I would say no more.  The viewer has to watch this cute French movie.",1305158400,4,565,4.388349514563107
