8264856,5,B00173EM9Y,"I am a small female that had absolutely zero natural golf talent. I had a wimpy-dippy swing. However, after years of lessons $$$$ I came across this method. It totally helped me immediately get my timing down.",1458950400,,209,4.675675675675675
8264857,1,B00173EM9Y,"I bought this video a few years ago and religiously followed the program. I wound up so messed up I could barely hit the ball! The setup and swing motion is so radical, be very wary before you attempt it! It took me a couple of years to get back to a normal swing, beware!",1367366400,,272,3.963636363636364
8264858,5,B00173EM9Y,"This is amazing, aswing that actually works. The wooosh at the bottom of the swing is something that I have never experienced before. Milt is probably not the best communicator but to mark it down for this would not be right. It is what is in the video that counts. I can't believe I haven't heard it shouted from the rooftops in the golf world. It is very easy to follow. I am saving up for the 3 set.",1241827200,,402,4.10126582278481
