7859109,5,6304032242,Shauna O'Brien is pure fire! I wish she would make more movies. She really has what it takes to be a Hollywood sex siren.,1377734400,2,121,4.083333333333333
7859110,3,6304032242,"The movie aside, which I caught one nite on Skin-emax and it's okay (a nice kinky bondage scene halfway thru was pretty cool, erotic, & raunchy if one is into that sorta thing), someone is asking $216.00 for a copy of this movie??????  How can that possibly be...well, possible?????

Someone should be ashamed.  The movie isn't THAT good or rare.",1206403200,4,346,4.733333333333333
7859111,5,6304032242,This is one of the best war movies going.  It's very close to the actual story and the actors chose where excellent.  It ranks up there with Midway and To the Shores of Tripoli.,1114905600,,177,4.176470588235294
7859112,1,6304032242,"Take the five lengthy full frontal sex love scenes out and you'd have about twenty minutes left of this foolishly inept ""thriller"".  David Christensen stars as Bruce, a telephone lineman (ex-cop) who overhears a woman talking to hit man.  His job:  for 30,000 dollars, kill her sister.  Christensen goes to his cop buddy, played with strong silence by Keith Lewis (one of the better ""actors"" in this film) and tells him he's going to check it out.  So Christensen goes off to the address and approaches beautiful Rachel (ineptly played by Shauna O'Brien), and then in steps sister Susan (likewise a boring performance by the equally lovely Landon Hall).  Christensen then tries to decide which sister is planning on killing the other.  T&A favorite Griffin Drew fills out the cast as Lewis' horny wife.  B movie action hero Tim Abell stars as the lusty boyfriend of both sisters.  In order to find out the bad sister, Christensen beds them both.  All the main actors get their own sex scenes, most of which consist of oral sex and sodomy, and a couple where the actors slap each other to demonstrate the kinkiness of the sex.

Not a prude by any means, I found these sex scenes laughable and completely unnecessary to advance the so called plot.  By the time the movie comes to its crashing crescendo, one can only hope they all get killed.

A real waste of film.",1097107200,5,1363,4.676470588235294
