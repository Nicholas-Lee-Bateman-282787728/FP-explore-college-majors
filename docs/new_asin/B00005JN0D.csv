1501946,1,B00005JN0D,"Near the end of this movie, I figured out what went wrong. This movie was originally written by an adult as a ""Oh, woe is me!"" Sunday movie of the week. The writer then left the script in the custody of his 11 year old daughter, who has seen ""Mission Impossible"" and ""The Italian Job"" way too many times. She wrote her own script, which she gave to the courier who came to retrieve it. No one caught the mistake until the last day of the shoot.
The skinny: A 12 year old climbing prodigy takes after her mountain climber father, who runs a go kart track. By coincidence, her mother (Jennifer Beals) is installing a state of the art security system in an old, prestigious, independent bank. A coincidence, because an old back injury paralyzes the father, who suddenly needs 250,000.00 for a risky experimental surgery. With the help of two 12 year old boys, and a bank vice president, who swoons in the presence in the girl, the girl figures out how to bypass security to steal the needed money. In the world of these 12 year olds, Police don't notice three kids driving go karts from the suburbs into downtown, the two security guards who work the day and night shift are clones of Needermyer from Animal House, and adults are so disconnected from reality that they seem to be unaware that three 12 year olds are going to penetrate a state of the art security system with only five days of planning.  If you are fond of middle school plays, this movie is for you.",1076198400,3,1463,4.438661710037175
1501947,3,B00005JN0D,"After a lackluster beginning of 2004, ""Catch That Kid"" is an ok movie for the time period. It's not a great movie like ""The Big Bounce,"" or ""The Last Samurai,"" but it is entertaining for an afternoon out. I have mixed feelings towards it, but in a way, I liked it. It stars Kristen Stewart who I could only recall from ""Panic Room,"" and the two movies are complety different from one another. This movie was close to the ""Spy Kids"" seris, which I liked the first two, and then lost it by the third one. Here's hoping this movie does not have a sequal that's worse, because then the entire charm of the seris could be gone.
This movie is about Maddy, who with her parents Molly, Tom, and her baby Max, are a normal family. Maddy wants to be a climber like her father was, and often clims a tower in her area, which her mother doesn't like her doing due to the danger, and the fact that Tom injured himself on a mountain climb years before. Her family also owns a go-cart track, where she likes to hang out with her two friends Gus and Austin, who are both smitten with her. All of a sudden, though, her father falls to the ground, and cannot movie anymore due to his accident. The only way that he could go back to normal is for his family to raise 250,000 dollars for the operation. Molly has problems getting a loan from her boss Mr. Brisbane, Maddy decides to figure out how to get the money. Her mother works in a bank, and she created sa safe suspended one hundred feet into the air. She convinces Gus and Austin to help her steal the money, with each of them using their own talents. With the unwitting help of the bank's manager Mr. Hartmann, the three get the plan to sneak into the bank, and pass the many motion cameras, and the two head sercurity officers, Ferrell, and Gus' older brother who is interning at the bank.
The best thing about ""Catch That Kid"" is that it is smart. It has methods of adventure that I wouldn't have expected. The best thing to do is to see it without hoping for a masterpiece. Don't hope for so much, and you'll walk out of the theatre satisfied. I knew that it couldn't be great, but I walked out without feeling that I wasted my money. It was an ok movie, but I recommend the first two ""Spy Kids"" movies instead of this. If you don't think that it will be great, this one could wait for the DVD. If you want to see it, watch it in the theatre. You won't feel you lost anything.
ENJOY!

I watched it with them--although it pales in comparison to adult bank heist type movies, it wasn't painful to watch as some kid flicks are.  The plot and dialogue wasn't horribly juvenile, and the acting was well done by the main characters.

1502919,5,B00005JN0D,"13-year-old Maddy (Kristen Stewart) is a devoted climber of anything high enough to pose a challenge--perhaps a normal hobby, considering that her father (Sam Robards) climbed Mount Everest some years ago.  Her two best friends are Gus (Max Thieriot), a mechanic who can make go-karts do things they're not intended for, and Austin (Corbin Bleu), a computer whiz and would-be filmmaker.  Gus's big brother Brad (Stark Sands) calls them all losers, but he has no idea how wrong he is.  When an old Everest injury flares up and leaves Maddy's father paralyzed, and her mother (Jennifer Beals) is unable to float a loan for experimental treatment in Europe, Maddy makes up her mind to steal the required $250,000 (""We'll pay it back,"" she insists) from the bank whose automated security system Molly has recently designed, and Gus and Austin promptly offer to help.  With the use of clever high-tech devices, go-karts, and addy's climbing gear, they mount their assault--and, possibly because they're too young to really know how impossible such a job is, they even succeed, after enough close calls to keep viewers of all ages on the edge of their seats.  There's also a delightful surprise ending that ties everything up perfectly (no, you'll have to watch the movie--I'm not telling!).  Michael des Barres as Brisbane, the president of the despoiled bank, will remind older watchers of Roddy McDowall in some of his slimier roles.

Come on, give the cops a break here.  Those kids would have been nailed in about five minutes.

The movie has it's own unique story and I didn't feel as though I had seen it before. The kids playing the key characters are engaging and don't have attitudes. That was what I found most refreshing. Sometimes attitude is needed to make a role convincing, but here it wasn't warranted, and they don't use any.

This movie has great kid actors/actresses in it and is a super movie to watch with your kids, I found it was highly emotional and inspiring.  The movie is developed for kids above 7-8 years old, who will more than over look the morality of the bank robbery which has taken so many harsh digs throughout it's critics.  If you can look beyond the robbery, the kids are learning the depths of their friendships, undeniable love for family, and also unconventional thinking that is sometimes called for in this sometimes red-taped, unsympathetic society.  And for those concerned about the morality demonstrated within this film, the Vice President of the bank himself legitimizes the robbery committed by the children as a security precaution to prevent future instances and commends the children for their bravery. The daughter is given a cash reward by the bank for finding flaws in their highly sophisticated security system, enough money to afford the much needed surgery for her father.

They pull dangerous stunts and run from police riding go-carts on city streets at night.  In the big wrap-up, they get caught.  Here I am waiting for the kids to learn that what they did was wrong.  The mom barely shames them and then lies to police to get them out of trouble.  In the end they are rewarded for their ""work"".  Dad is saved and all is well, but at what cost?

1503049,3,B00005JN0D,"Minor Spoilers Ahead-'Catch That Kid' is not a bad film for a younger (pre-13) audience. The three kids are all pleasant and competent-Kristen Stewart (a younger and shorter Portman/Knightley type), Corbin Bleu, and Max Thieriot are all talented kids.

However beware-the screenplay is VERY weak in the credibility department. But if you can accept the idea of three kids robbing a super-secure bank vault then you can probably overlook the obvious plot flaw-how they will explain where they got the $250,000 for her father's operation. The problem is that the kids are played as far too intelligent to overlook such an obvious issue. Then you get into the moral/ethical dilemma of stealing-the scriptwriters try (unconvincingly) to solve this by having Stewart's character say that she will pay it all back. Bottom line-be prepared to buy into a moronically contrived story (at least 'The Perfect Score' had a solid story foundation).

Director Bart Freundlich and Director of Photography Julio Macat should take a look at some 'Saddle Club' episodes before they make another film targeted toward this age group. Hey guys-it is all about kids in the audience bonding with the kids in the production. 'Saddle Club' does that with mega close-ups and extreme close-ups. Almost every shot in 'Catch That Kid' should have been tighter (wide shots should have been close-ups, close-ups should have been extreme close-ups, etc. etc.). Watch the DVD with the zoom switch activated and you will see how it should have been shot. Also turn on the actors' commentary which is quite unaffected and really adds to the charm of the film.

Finally be sure to watch the 'Gone Nutty' short on the DVD-great animation!!

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1115078400,10,1750,5.041522491349481

This movie was very funny and had a story line that viewers have seen a lot of but with a big twist like 12 year old kids robbing a bank and doing a great job doing it. The talent in this movie suprised me especially by actors Corbin Bleu/Austin and Max Thieriot/Gus but not to much by kristen stewart, after seeing her in panic room with jodie foster it was no secret she was good and has potential to be a big star sooner or later. These kids execute in every part of this movie. I hate giving away pieces of the movie but the only thing that should be said is this is a great movie for kids, teens, and any adult with a sense of humor don't let the low grades slapped on this movie stop you from watching it because you'll miss something good. I have seen the cody banks movies and the spy kids and so on those were ok but this movie is a lot better and they should make a second part.",1102291200,27,1137,3.9478260869565216
1503168,1,B00005JN0D,"*1/2 ""Catch That Kid"" is ""Ocean's Eleven"" for the pre-pubescent set.  It is also the second film this year to feature a group of youngsters masterminding a complex heist.  In the first, ""The Perfect Score,"" the prized goal was the answer sheet to the SAT test.  In ""Catch That Kid,"" the target is $250,000 ensconced in the spanking new vault of a bank where a young girl's mother works as head of security.  The girl, Maddy, has come up with the plan as a means of raising funds for her crippled father who needs an expensive operation in Denmark if he hopes ever to walk again.  Laudable as that goal may be, the premise is still an odd and dubious one for a film aimed at pre- and early-teen audiences.  What a comfort it is to learn that kids can make just as effective bank robbers as adults.

Actually, ""Catch That Kid"" might have been more offensive were it not so poorly and ineptly made.  As it is, it's so utterly innocuous that it barely registers a blip on our consciousness while we're watching it.  The movie provides virtually no imagination, no humor and no excitement even for its target audience who will find it rather slow-paced and chintzy compared with the kinds of high tech, high-powered action films they are more accustomed to watching.  Anyone old enough to watch this film is old enough to watch a real heist film like ""Rafifi"" or ""Topkapi.""",1096588800,7,1368,4.546938775510204
1503169,1,B00005JN0D,"There are some interesting lessons to be learned in this film. If you're father needs surgery so that he can walk again, it's okay to: 1) lie to your best friends and make them think that you're in love with them; and 2) rob a bank.

This is one of the most morally bankrupt films I've ever seen that isn't *trying* to slosh about in the ethical gutter (i.e., some ""adult"" films - this is a kids movie, after all). How in the world could a parent allow their child to rob a bank and not punish that child? Even more - how could a parent watch this movie with their child and then recommend it? The absurdity of that is mind boggling.

I'll admit that there are fine acting performances here. Kristen Stewart seems to be destined for greatness, as she continues a streak of steady performances begun in The Safety of Objects.

But no acting can get past the unconscionable messages this movie sends to kids.",1091836800,8,906,4.380952380952381
1503170,3,B00005JN0D,"I've read some very vicious reviews of this movie, mostly centered on 12 yr. olds robbing a bank and how terrible that was. I watched it recently and found it to be  a pretty good movie, 12 year old audience oriented to be sure.

The action wouldn't look too bad for a bunch of 32 year old actors out to steal for profit ( no doubt the critics would approve of this film if Mark Wahlberg and Charlieze Theron did it instead of children)but in this case we have three kids out to get the money just so that Maddy's father can have lifesaving surgery that insurance won't cover and her mother's bank won't help out on. There's no intent or effort to take a penny for profit (at one point the bank officials can't understand why someone would only take 250K out of a vault holding 25 million).

I found the bank vault design to be a little unlikely and some of the security measures too but you can do much worse than this for a bank heist movie. I actually found the fart jokes (not much of that) and Maddy lying to her friends to get them in on the job to be much more offensive than the robbery itself.",1090368000,10,1102,4.188679245283019
1503171,5,B00005JN0D,"There's no point in me reviewing this movie, because it's not a movie that was meant for me.  This is purely a kid's movie.

My daughter LOVES this movie.  For that past 2 days she's watched nothing else!  She finds it cute, exciting and sweet (her words).

From my point of view, this movie is good.  It's movie geared for kids that isn't painful for an adult to sit through.  I've only seen 20 minutes here, 20 minutes there... but I was entertained every time I sat down to watch a bit of it.

I'm not sure what the reveiwers who hated it were expecting.  It's not Lord Of The Rings or even Ocean's 11... but it doesn't claim to be and it's not trying to be.  It's a KID's movie.",1090281600,7,682,4.137404580152672

1503288,5,B00005JN0D,"This is a movie that delivers exactly what I expected - a kid's movie.  This is a movie the whole family can enjoy.  The plot: A young girl (Maddy) finds out her father is dying from an illness that only an experimental operation can cure.  When she discovers that the operation cost more than her parents can afford, she makes a bad decision to steal the money from one of her mother's clients.
Maddy makes bad decision after bad decision, but I think in the end she learns from her mistakes; and it is that fact that makes the message of the movie okay by me.
I think this movie had unique characters and a very interesting plot.  There were a few bad actors though; the head security guard at the bank building may have turned in the worst performance I have seen in quite a few years.
Kristen Stewart is an amazing actress, and I see her as a young Jodie Foster.  She is going to be a huge star!  Corbin Bleu and Max Thierot were flawless in their roles as Maddy's best friends.
The critics of this film need to realize that most Americans are sick of the ""Kill Bill"" and ""Lost in Translation"" type movies.  It seems the more gore or negative-thinking is thrown in to a movie, the more chances it has of being adored by the Hollywood elite.  I think it is time to make movies that can rely on substance and acting.  This movie is not in the same league as Tombstone or Lord of the Rings, but it definitely delivers everything it claims to deliver in the synopsis!
THAT'S WHY I GAVE IT A 5!
See ya next review!
