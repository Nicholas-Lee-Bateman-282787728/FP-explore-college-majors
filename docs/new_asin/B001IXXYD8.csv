I was really excited about the release of this DVD, but found a lot of the material I had already heard. It was still very funny, but I was expecting so much more from such a clever funny man!",1235952000,,273,3.892857142857143
3650037,4,B001IXXYD8,"It is so funny, russell came up with new jokes about Indians,Jews,Chinese and Arabs.
in many cases he connects the topics with each other in a fascinating way,
but sometimes he jumps to a new topic without any obvious connection.
He also, repeated some of his old jokes,
like him being hairy and proud of it,the haunted hotel etc.
but he puts some new favor to it.
Anyway, You should buy this one, it's so funny, you will not regret it.",1234915200,2,436,4.395061728395062
3650038,1,B001IXXYD8,"I have been a big fan of Russell Peters for past few years.  I was eagerly waiting for this DVD and bought it the day it came out.  I am completely disappointing with it.  Jokes are nothing but sick.  He said some terrible things even though there was a kid in the audience.  At one point, Russell even said that and his mother (I hope he was kidding on this) was also in the audience, which is even more terrible.  He said repeatedly that he has a lot of money.  I do not understand how that is funny or relevant to his comedy?  Complete waste of time.  Do check some snippets of the video to see if you like it before you buy it.  My recommendation:  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.  Just buy this one if you haven't seen it&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Comedy-Now-Starring-Russell-Peters/dp/B000CR8QRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Comedy Now!

3650039,5,B001IXXYD8,"Gut-bursting, pee-in-your pants comedy!  It's that hilarious, enjoyable and extremely funny!  Russell Peters is unleashed in `Red, White & Brown'.  One of the top comedians right now and he truly delivers with his latest DVD release!

The Canadian stand-up comic won people over with his Comedy Central special ""Russell Peters: Outsourced"" back in 2006 and now the guy is just red hot!

His latest DVD release ""Red, White and Brown"" was recorded live at a sold-out audience at the WaMu Theater at Madison Square Garden and features material from his ""HOMECOMING TOUR"" and features 20 additional minutes not shown on the Comedy Central broadcast and also includes a full-length CD of the performance.

Featured on the DVD are the following segments:

  1. Mele Mel Intro
  2. DDR
  3. Blame the Media
  4. Cheap Indians Pt. 2
  5. Louis Vuitton
  6. Race vs. Culture
  7. West Indians
  8. Body Hair
  9. World Cup
  10. Deaf People
  11. Credits

No one is spared in the audience.  People in the audience of different ethnicity will be picked and utilized into his comedy routine as well as anyone in the audience.  May it be the woman who gets up to go to the bathroom, to the man who brought his child to the performance, Russell Peters has a competent flow of comedy in which the pacing on the DVD is full of non-stop fun, one joke after the other and no pausing of laughter. Peter's comedy delivery, facial expressions of his comedy routine was done very well.

The accompany CD features the performance but where the DVD is about 1 hr. and 19 minutes, the CD is about 57 minutes long.  So, more or less, the Comedy Central edited performance is probably what is featured on the CD and I've already listened to it several times.  It's a very good comedy CD and even without the visuals of the DVD, the jokes are just as funny and hearing the audience laughing, gasping and cheering at each joke is heard clearly.

Overall, ""Red, White and Brown"" is an enjoyable,  fun and fantastic performance.  Russell Peters was on top of his game that night and it showed.  You can't help but laugh at his comedy!

VIDEO & AUDIO:

Part of what makes a comedy performance on DVD work effectively is to show the audience and ""Red, White and Brown"" definitely has a good number of cameras to get close ups of reactions to closeups of the people that Peters targets for his jokes and a good angles from different parts of the venue and of course close up of Peters.  Editing was done really well and thus you get good cuts of Peters and then various audience reaction.

The lighting was done really well inside the venue and overall a very good choice for venue for the performance.

As for the audio, the audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround and English Stereo.  You can clearly hear Peters and the audience laughing and gasping, clapping at the jokes.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are a good number of special features included on this release.  Included are:

  * Featurette: White Jacket Bootleg  - This segment features about 10 minutes of comedy focusing on ""Women are Thinkers"" and ""David and Vickey"".  Both have optional commentary featuring Russell Peters, Clayton Peters and Director Jigar Talati.  I have to say that the segment on ""David and Vickey"" was just hilarious.  Two co-workers come to watch the show and Peters was just relentless in using these two in his bit.  Well-done!
  * Featurette: Support the Troops - This features comedy on the ""USS Eisenhower"" and ""Saddam's Bitches in a Building"" (with optional commentary featuring Russell Peters, Clayton Peters and Director Jigar Talati).
  * Deleted Scenes: This feature scenes that were deleted from the extended play of ""Red, White and Brown"" but nevertheless, these additional scenes are equally as funny.

Additional Scenes: Filipino Mom
Additional Scenes: Indians and Filipinos
Additional Scenes: Ethnic Photos
Additional Scenes: Arab-A-Phobia

I was definitely pleased with Russell Peters ""Red, White and Brown"", his ability to continuously showcase joke after joke, incorporate the audience into his comedy routine quickly, no pausing just a smooth flow of comedy.

Again this comedy is no holds barred, Chinese, Indians, Jewish, African-American, Latino, Filipino, Italians, etc.  Peters goes all out and overall, manages to have one well-done performance on DVD and also on CD.

As mentioned, a good comedy DVD needs to have good editing, good lighting, audience participation and a various camera angles and everything else to work well.  In this case, the venue, editing, the various camera angles and audience participation was perfect.  Sound is clear on both the DVD and CD and you can't ask for anything more.  On the DVD, you get a good number of special features and the optional commentary for the featurettes as well.

I have no doubt in my mind that we will see more of Russell Peters in the near future.  The man is one of the top comedians in North America right now and watching this... joke after joke and the way he presented it, everything worked on this DVD.  Hilarious, no holds barred comedy at its best!

So, you're definitely going to get your money's worth for this DVD release.  Russell Peter's ""Red, White and Brown"" is highly recommended!",1232755200,17,5240,4.826381059751973
3650040,4,B001IXXYD8,Good stand up by Russell Peters.  Making fun of different races although his usual improv with the crowd seemed bit like he was just trying to fill time and seemed to drag.  Bit pricey but still good Russell Peters Stand up.,1362960000,,224,4.439024390243903
3650041,4,B001IXXYD8,"funny dvd.  Still, the jokes appear to be similar to his other material...Maybe give him another chance for new stuff in 2013",1356998400,,125,4.681818181818182
3650042,5,B001IXXYD8,"I was lucky to be in the audience when Peters came to New York and never laughed so hard at a comedian.  Viewing the video a couple of times did not diminish how funny this comic genius it!.  I guess my ""mind was blasted.""  Peters knows how to play the audience well and things that happen in the audience only seemed to add to the jokes without any letup in the pace.  Russell is a master of capturing different ethnic accents and no matter who he picked on, it seemed that those people laughed out loud.

Now I know that an Indian ghost is not scary and that there are different levels of cheapness among ethnicities.  There is about 40 minutes of bonus features including routines from different shows, Russell taking a military plane to an aircraft carrier and scenes from his upcoming documentary.  This is a must for anyone in need of a good laugh!",1293321600,,854,4.435897435897436
3650043,5,B001IXXYD8,"[...]

But it's hilarious however you obtain it. RP is not only a great comedian, but he mimics the Indian, Chinese, Hispanic, Middle Eastern accents perfectly. The ""sex"" humor is a bit puerile, but still kind of funny. Luckily most of his comedy is about culture and the general silliness of humans.

Too bad Amazon doesn't sell it at a reasonable price.",1262044800,,355,4.709677419354839
3650044,5,B001IXXYD8,"Russell Peters's Red, White, and Brown DVD is a great look at his take on the many nationalities in the world.  Nobody is safe from his wit and his insight to specific culture is dead-on.  You do have to know something about world culture in order to really understand his humor.  The length is just right on this DVD.",1261872000,,318,4.3559322033898304
3650045,3,B001IXXYD8,"If you are not familiar with Russell Peters, he is a Canadian of Indian ancestry. So much of the material in his stand up routines highlights traits and peculiarities about Indian people. He puts funny twists to everyday happenings in the life of an Indian. His jokes also attack other races, especially Chinese. During this routine he directs his comedy on an audience member who has to leave the auditorium for some reason, a funny bit which made you squirm at her plight.  Although I enjoyed Comedy Now starring Peter Russell more, this is not a bad effort. I never had a chance to see the extras but I will at a later date. I gave this show 3 stars 121509",1260835200,,659,4.446280991735537
3650046,2,B001IXXYD8,"Love, love love the humor of Russell Peters, but he used so much foul language in this DVD it was as if he was getting paid ""per swear.""  Not that I expect anyone who is talking about real life to not include the occasional four letter word, where they are appropriate...but this was unnatural! A good bit of sexual content as well.
Some folks don't object to this, but for me it detracted from his natural wit.",1253059200,,411,4.337662337662338
3650047,5,B001IXXYD8,"I first found Russell Peters by accident on youtube.  I can't imagine how I could have been unaware of him for so long.  This guy is the best new comedian (well, new to me anyway) that I've run across since I first saw Robin Williams on the Mork and Mindy show or Jim Carrey on In Living Color.  You can, of course, get bits and pieces of his act from the Internet, but, for the real experience, I heartily recommend that you shell out a few bucks for the DVD's (they're pretty reasonably priced) and enjoy them in your nice comfy living room on your big screen TV.  Of course, if you're offended by politically incorrect humor, then you probably don't have much of a sense of humor anyway, so you should probably just save your money.  If you belong to an ethnic group - white, black, asian, hispanic, indian, arabic, canadian, english, german, italian, portugese, french, extraterrestrial or whatever - he WILL make fun of them!  But none of it is mean spirited.",1252713600,2,964,4.511494252873563
3650048,2,B001IXXYD8,"Most of the stuff in Red White and Brown can be found in his previous shows. You can tell that much of the audience already heard a lot of the RWB material because the laughter was not split-belly hard like it was in his old shows. It was merely polite laughter with a tinge of hopefulness that something new would be coming up, which didn't usually happen. If you've never seen his previous stuff, then RWB might be all right, but even then I would rather watch the older shows first.

Disappointed fan of R. Peters",1251158400,3,516,4.375
