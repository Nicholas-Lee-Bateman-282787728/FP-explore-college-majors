7861503,3,6304102925,"I had seen this on TV in the late 90's and liked the story- Cyndi Lauper is charming and the support cast is appealing. I have been looking for it to reappear ever since, but no luck. Then I went on a search thru Amazon and found that a VHS version was the only thing available, so I bought it and enjoyed it all over again! Can't recommend this to anyone who isn't a Cyndi Lauper fan- this was never shown in theaters, but went directly to VHS when completed- for good reason.",1438992000,,477,4.139784946236559
7861504,4,6304102925,"Growing up, I've had a lot of long-lasting yet passing obsessions... My Little Pony age 2-5, The Addams Family age 7-8, Animaniacs age 9-10, Sailor Moon age 11-12, Blink-182 age 13-16, but only two that have lasted my entire lifetime - mermaids and Cyndi Lauper... and I have the tattoos to show it.  So finding a movie starring Cyndi as a mermaid... why, it was like a dream come true.  So perhaps I'm a bit biased?  Perhaps I wouldn't have enjoyed the movie so much if it weren't starring my life-long idol as the leading roll?  Who's to say?  Fact of the matter is that Cyndi *is* the leading female in this movie and she is absolutely magical and just as beautiful as ever.  The mermaid scenes are a work of art and even out of the costume (which is the majority of the movie), she looks absolutely stunning.

That said, much of the movie is very predictable.  You know from the first moment you see them that the ""family"" is going to become a family and you know that the murderer is going to be lurking around every corner... and that when he isn't going to them, they're coming right to him.  The ending was a bit unexpected... as well as a bit pointless, lame even... although it all wrapped up into a neat little package, go figure... a happy, pointless ending that leaves one feeling a bit empty.  I should also point out that the murderer's kung fu moves are his weapon of choice... I mean, is there anything lamer than some unlikely white guy who doesn't need a gun because he has a black belt?  What is this?... Walker Texas Ranger?  *rolls eyes*  The death scenes are very well-done, that is to say... they're very... well, *yucky*.  I don't know how else to put it.  They aren't particularly scary or suspenseful, though they don't skimp on the blood effects.

All in all, I have to agree with the other reviewers.  If you're a die-hard Cyndi fan, this movie is *without question* a must-have and worth every penny no matter how much you pay for it.  Casual fans would find a better investment in Vibes.",1121385600,,2018,4.452316076294278
7861505,4,6304102925,"All the previous reviews are true, except they don't emphasize enough on Cyndi Lauper. This movie wouldn't even exist without her. I mean, nobody would watch it. With Cyndi, it's well worth watching. Her performance is so awesome and she looks so great that you don't really have to follow the storyline. Watching Cyndi perform is a true delight.
All I can say is buy this movie if you're a fan of Cyndi Lauper. If not, then buy ""Twelve Deadly Cyns...And Then Some"" DVD and enjoy her great music videos.",1009497600,3,503,4.6
7861506,2,6304102925,"cyndi lauper is a great singer and actress so when i saw this film I wanted it to be better. I baught the film and it was just ok. The best part of the film is the beginnig the first 20minutes after that it just went down hill. The beginning scenes when shes was dressed as a mermaid were entertaining, the writer and director should of kept the film simple but added a terrible storyline that not even cyndis charm could save it. Cyndi sings acouple of songs that its worth buying this film the song are not entirely sung becauseof whats going in in the film. The two songs she sings beautifully are ""blue moon"" and ""crimson and clover"".It is to bad the script could of had more action and david keiths acting is awful in this film and so is the comedian who stays at his hotel-bad jokes. The only thing that saved this film is cyndi, but i do wish that this film would be put on dvd maybe it will be a little more entertaining and thier will be bonus material that will be a collectors dream of cyndi lauper.",998179200,,1010,4.211340206185567

7861508,2,6304102925,"If you are a fan of singer Cyndi Lauper, you can find outlets for your appreciation nearly anywhere; Amazon alone lists nearly two dozen entries,  from originals, to soundtracks to Club remixes.  That's not counting the  videos of her concerts and appearances at Wrestlemania events.
 If you  are a fan of actress Cyndi Lauper, then that's another kettle of fish  entirely.  You basically get your choice between 1989's wonderful  ""Vibes"" with Jeff Goldblum & Peter Falk, the lackluster  ""Life with Mikey"" and this ungodly mess, called ""Off &  Running"".
 The box asks us ""What do a wacky nightclub mermaid,  a failed ex-golfer, a wise-cracking kid and a killer all have in  common...?""  Answer: Each is trying to get this film erased from his  or her resume.  The story goes like this, Lauper, the wacky nightclub  mermaid, is approached by a former jockey who acts way too much like a  stalker to be taken seriously by any but the most desperate of women.  After a night of passion, both the jockey and his favorite horse are  murdered.  Before he dies, the jockey gives Lauper a key  to...something...and she feels it is her duty to find out what.  While  following her destiny, she runs into (literally) David Keith, who goes on  to kidnap a child he thinks is Laupers.  The three of them ride the Hijinx  Train to hilarity followed by a wacky hitman.
 Well, no, not really.  I  didn't find much about this film to be amusing, other than the fact that  Cyndi Lauper would fall for any lines as transparent as the jockey's.  In  fact, it was all pretty pathetic.  The dialog was wooden, the story  implausible, unbelievable and cruel in places.  On top of that, the sound  on the video I saw was muddy, making it nearly impossible to hear the bad  actors muff their lines.
 What did I like about this movie?  Well, a  couple of things.  Cyndi Lauper was a delight, as always, though her  haircut in this film, a flapper's bob, emphasized the squidginess of her  face.  This was more than compensated for by her costumes, from the  whimsical mermaid outfit to the knockout little black dress she dons later.  Richard Belzer, overacting, makes a wonderful appearance (shirtless,in a  white satin vest, yet!)as the birdchested half-owner of a swamp motel.  The  killer is actually kind of funny in a psychotic, scenery-chewing kind of  way.
 If you're a Cyndi Lauper fan, it's worth taking a look at, but I  wouldn't try too hard to track it down.",967507200,4,2446,4.7
