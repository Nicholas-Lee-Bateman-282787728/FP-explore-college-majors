1343358,4,B00004REFE,"I thought that this movie was a very good portrayal of the conflict  between Mary, QOS and Elizabeth.  Though they never really met each other  face to face (as they did twice in the movie for a short time) the movie  gives a pretty good idea of the opinion each had of the other.  Also, the  story of Mary's struggle for power and her eventual tragic failier is  facinating.  I also think that Glenda Jackson played a great part as  Queen Elizabeth.  She certainly has a good deal of experience in this role,  as she also played Elizabeth in the wonderful television series, Elizabeth  R.  In my opinion, she had the best role in the movie and played it  extremely well.  Elizabeth is arguably the best character because she must  struggle with the fact that she is always ""living under the  shadow"" of Mary.  She also has to deal with Mary as a rival to the  English throne and a danger to herself, but does not want to have to kill  her.  However,  she is eventually forced to execute her. the movie ends  just after she has died, with the moving sight of Elizabeth, crying while  holding Mary's prayerbook that she took to her execution.  The movie was  perhaps not entirely accurate as a history lesson, but gives a good insight  into the conflict between the two queens, and is a facinating tale.  All in  all, I really enjoyed the movie, and I think many others will as well,  particularly if they are interested in the subject.  If you liked this  movie then I would recomend any others about the same period of history.  I  found that most of these movies or television series are similar in their  great level of acting, and every one of them is a new and interesting  story.  Anne of the Thousand Days, Elizabeth R, and Lady Jane are just a  few that I would recomend to anyone interested in Tudor history.",959558400,3,1817,4.443425076452599
1343359,4,B00004REFE,"This is a great movie, which describes Mary Stuart's life as queen of Scotland.  And after watching this movie, the viewer feels nothing but sympathy for Mary.  Her husband dies suddenly of a strange illness, her  illegimate brother, James Stuart(played by Patrick McGoohan) works against  her because of their different religions. She marrys a man(Timothy Dalton)  sent by her enemy Queen Elizabeth(Glenda Jackson).  Soon the viewer finds  out that he is bisexual and is involved in a plot to kill her.  Her child  is taken away from her, and she is imprisoned in England ""for her own  good.""  Finally, at the end, Mary is taken to a trial for plotting  against Elizabeth and is executed.  Mary's life was not a happy one.  And  though this movie is somewhat inaccurate(Mary and Elizabeth never met in  real life) it shows the hardships that Mary went through in her attempt to  rule her country.  Once again, it's a great movie. In some parts, it kind  of drags, but overall, it's entertaining and interesting.",959126400,6,1012,4.847058823529411

1343365,4,B00004REFE,"I didn't always follow what was going on, but I got the distinct impression the people involved didn't, either. There's a lot of duplicity, even treason, and plotting and scheming of all sorts in this movie, as there was in the life of Mary (Vanessa Redgrave) and her half-sister Elizabeth (Glenda Jackson). The part about Mary as a devout Catholic and Elizabeth as the Protestant head of the Church of England is well known. But there was more, so much more, which both used that conflict and was used by it. For example, according to Catholics (including the Pope), Elizabeth was illegitimate because her father's divorce from Mary's mother (or was it one of his other six wives?) was invalid. So she had no right to rule England, and Mary was the rightful heir.

Mary had been married to the French king, but when he died of something which manifested in severe headaches (brain tumor?) and seizures, she returned to Scotland to take up her inherited throne there. Here half-sister Elizabeth denied her safe passage through England, which forced her to go way up into the very rough North Sea to get to Scotland. Lord Bothwell (Nigel Davenport) came to get her in a pair of ships, she in one and he in the other. But his was captured, and he was put in prison by Elizabeth.

Mary's half-brother, James Stuart, was illegitimate and therefore could not inherit the throne of Scotland, but he had been regent since his mother died. He contrived to continue as her primary adviser once she returned, but she had brought with her a priest and an ill-defined right-hand man (spy, really) named David Riccio (Ian Holm).

At that time, there was already a major rift between the Protestant and Catholic nobles in Scotland, and Mary's return was fuel for the fire. The Protestant nobles had their plots and plans. Assisting them were the machinations of Elizabeth, who sent her own lover, Robert Dudley (Daniel Massey) to woo Mary. She expected him to fail, however, and also sent Henry, Lord Darnley, a rather foolish, foppish but decidedly Catholic subject of hers which she expected Mary to fall in love with. That part worked, and Mary married Darnley.

Now, was Darnley the King, or the Queen's consort? In other words, did he rule, or did she? It soon became obvious that he was not fit to rule, but that he believed he should be king. A good bit of manipulation and plotting went on around that fact.

Before I go on any longer, I should point out that I do not know enough about English and Scots history to know if this is accurate, although what I do know suggests that it is, at least to the extent details are known. With so many people plotting and lying, it is worthwhile to remember that history is generally written by the winners. Still, if anyone reads this who knows history well enough to say how accurate this movie is, please give me your thoughts in a comment. I'm especially interested in anything which you know to be false.

Both Vanessa Redgrave and Glenda Jackson are very good in their roles, so accurate or no, it is well worth seeing.",1336780800,,3059,4.634686346863469
1343366,3,B00004REFE,"This is the story of Mary, Queen of Scots and her cousin, Queen Elizabeth (daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn).  Mary was eventually executed by Elizabeth.

To get a better grasp of the history, I'd been extremely eager to see this film.  It wound up taking several evenings.  In spite of my best efforts to stay awake, the film put me to sleep four times!

With regard to historical liberties, Wikepedia only mentions two fictional meetings between Mary & Elizabeth and Mary's taste for hot chocolate.  I find it doubtful that this list is complete.

Perhaps, my expectations were too high, & I should have been looking for written works all along.",1317772800,,653,4.725663716814159

Glenda Jackson as the latter is especially dynamic, forceful and interesting to watch.  The costumes and locations are nicely done, and the music is suitable enough.
Some of the male performers do not fare as well, and better actors could have been chosen.  I actually laughed when Vizzio was being killed because he screamed like a little girl.

1343371,4,B00004REFE,"I enjoyed this movie quite a bit more than I was prepared to.  In this day and age, when watching a dated film - you generally prepare yourself for dated costume, overdramatic acting, and slightly cheesy portrayls of characters.  Not so in any way, with this movie!

With the vivd storyline of Mary's life to be told - the enjoyable main purpose of the film is to show  A)Mary's love life affecting her reign and  B)Her power struggle with Elizabeth.  Both Vanessa Redgrave and Glenda Jackson are dynamite in these roles, and their few scenes together (where they go head to head) are some of my favorites in the film!

The costume and scenery was appropriate and lavish for each character/location.  All the acting was believably done (....well, maybe not for a young Timothy Dalton who is crazed and blonde!).
Watch if for the history, costumes, or great story.....but definitely watch it.",1228694400,,891,4.815789473684211
1343372,5,B00004REFE,"After reviewing several excellent notes at this site, I see little reason to rehashed the plot scenes and all that. In my humble opinon, I found this movie to be well made, well scripted and excellently acted. The two female stars, Vanessa Redgrave and Glenda Jackson proves to be at the top of their game. I think Redgrave captured Mary pretty well. Her Mary was a lovestruck woman who think implusively with her heart, rarely with her brain. But there is no doubt that Jackson was born to portaryed Elizabeth and her performance was fantastic as it was when she portaryed Elizabeth in that Masterpiece Theater series, Elizabeth R. Although Jackson was the supporting player in this movie and don't appeared much, her presence dominate the movie.

Both of them were ably supported by the rest of the cast. Most notable were Nigal Davenport who played charming and forceful Bothwell superbly well and Timothy Dalton who played weak and corrupt Lord Darnley nicely. Ian Holm whined and craved perfectly well as unfortunate Rizzo. Overall, a great supporting cast all around.

This movie is basically a character study between Mary and Elizabeth, their struggles and plans against each other. Mary failed because as it accurately stated in the movie, Mary behaved like a woman first, queen second. Elizabeth on the other hand, always a Queen first, everything else second. Although the script take many historical liberties, I thought it captured the character and the spirit of both Mary and Elizabeth.

For the historical minded, Mary and Elizabeth never met in person. Although Mary's son James inherited the English throne, he belonged more to Elizabeth then to Mary.

I am bit surprised and disappointed that this movie have not yet been release in the DVD format.",1135209600,12,1767,5.0
1343373,5,B00004REFE,"Mary Queen of Scots, brings to the screen the story of Mary Stuart, the woman who ruled as queen of Scotland and whose son, James, would be king of England and Scotland.

Vanessa Redgrave, Glenda Jackson, Timothy Dalton, Ian Holm, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!

Relations between Scotland and her adversaries (notably England, France and Spain) are as fascinating as the conflict between Protestantism and Catholicism.

In addition, the film does a GREAT job of presenting both the queen and the woman in Mary as well as Elizabeth.

The setting, the dialogues, the music and the costumes are all wonderful!

History, Politics, and Intrigue, are all about.

Strongly recommended along with Elizabeth R (starring Glenda Jackson), Mary Queen of Scots is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!",1132185600,5,1041,5.160714285714286
1343374,5,B00004REFE,"This is a wonderfully rich film which contextualises Mary's story from the end of her girlhood marriage into French Nobility through her return to Scotland and a her undoing at the hands of plotters and self serving hangers on.

It spares none of the gruesome detail as plots and counter plots are unearthed, leading as they do to deception, murder, betrayal and Mary's eventual long imprisonment in England followed by her execution, arising from a desperate hunt to damn her, condemn and ""solve"" her as a Papal problem for Elizabeth. What is even better here is the demonstration of the women behind the inevitable plot and their depth of respect and feeling for each other. Jackson is brilliantly noble and steadfast as Elizabeth, she equally demonstrates an intense and heartfelt envy of Mary for her 3 marriages and production of a successor to her throne. Redgrave is equally strong and yet a hopeless devotee to those giving counsel. She demonstrates well the conviction to her religion which would otherwise seem unfathomable today. Other noteworthy performances include a young Timothy Dalton as the spineless Lord Darnly, Daniel Massey as the hapless Earl of Leicester and the marvellously menacing Patrick Magoohan as Mary's brother.",1131321600,7,1244,5.158415841584159

  Ms. Jackson is her foil showing Elizabeth as the hard headed Monarch of England that she was. She spoke the truth when she said that she had the ""Body of a weak & febble woman but that she had the stomach of a King & a King of England at that.""

1343376,5,B00004REFE,"i saw the end of this movie when i was elevn and just could not figure out why any queen would be beheaded. so i started on a long search on reading material to find out the life of mary and my love of history truly began.

finally years later i would see it in it's entirity and it is great.

just the feud between vanessa and glenda over the course of 29 years was worth watching. the fact that the 2 queens actually never met just gives the writer a lot of lead way for what might have transpired.

the fact is is that elizabeth was considered a bastard from birth. because the catholic church never recognized her as legitimate, mary was brought up under the impression that she was the rightful heir to the throne instead of elizabeth. boy would that get her in a lot of trouble with elizabeth.

when mary does claim her scottish throne, she finds just about eveyone against her. her bastard brother wants the throne for himself. the protestant lords of her country don't want a catholic ruler. elizabeth has more than a few reasons to despise her. and her french mother in law catherine de medic(whom the movie could have given a bigger part), just is happy if she never sets foot in france again.

against all these enemies, she actually rules for 7 years, bears an heir, and is married 3 times before she is forced to adicate and flee to of all places england. here she spends 19 years as a prisioner of elizabeth's before meeting her fate of beheading.

now the writer refers to a few points of history and does not clarify them. one in the final confrontation between mary and elizabeth mary tells her that elizabeth fears the judicial murder of an annoited queen more than she fears death. hello!!!

could you clarify why this would be so? he conveintly leaves out that elizabeth's mother was beheaded for adultery when she was 2 so this probaly would be a big sticking point in her life. the writer just leave you hanging on too many historical details.

all in all the movie was great. if you are lucky, try to see it a couple of times. they have cut some scenes and sometimes when they rerun it they will show the deleted scenes.",1112313600,,2143,4.407594936708861

All of the other reviews are extensive, so I will make mine short and sweet.  Excellent period movie.  I had seen ""Elizabeth"" several years ago.  After watching ""Mary Queen of Scots"", I will go back and either rent or buy ""Elizabeth"" just to tie loose ends together.  I only wish there were more movies made of the kings and queens of Europe.  I would watch them all!!

1343378,5,B00004REFE,"Made during a time when ""Anne of the Thousand Days"" was a critical and, I assume, financial, success, and ""Elizabeth R"" was popular on PBS, this film kind of got lost. But as I remember it, it was wonderful--a real human interest story as well as fascinating history--done in a naturalistic style. Vanessa Redgrave was tour de force--simply electrifying, and I'm sure sure she was nominated for an Oscar. I was so impressed, I went back to the theatre at least once and very possibly twice to see it again. I have to wonder how my reaction then would hold up today, after so many years of life lived in between.

1343380,4,B00004REFE,"Although the figure of Mary Stuart has always been distorted by Hollywood, this is a good movie which is actually an attempt at giving us a glimpse at the women, not the Queens, in their historic context.
Unfortunately, even this one is a bit sweet with Mary and goes on hard on Elizabeth.
The players are all first class, starting with a Clash of Titans between Vanessa Redgrave and Glenda Jackson. Two female screen giants fighting out in front of our own eyes. What a feast.
Then come the other giants: Trevor Howard, Ian Holm, Patrick McGoohan, Harry Andrews and many more othe British Screen legends. A real treat in Stardom and a who's who in this movie.
Just for that it is highly recommendable.
Now two points of woe.
First: in all these years (the movie dates back to 1971) do you think that Universal Pictures could have released at least one Widescreen version of it? Noooooh, the Gentlemen went on producing other insignificant stuff, but never cared on re-releasing this one in Letterbox format.
Second: although I liked it when it was released, especially for its cast and more than beautiful music scored by John Barry, why wasn't an attempt made at remaking it in a more true to history perspective?
After all Mary was not as innocent as depicted by Katie Hepburn or even Vanessa Redgrave. This is Folk Lore not History!
Mary was raised in France in exile, but pretty soon took a keen interest in politics and started plotting all by herself to take possession of the English Crown.
These were not the figments of the imagination of Elizabeth, but a hard and harsh reality that the English Crown and the Parliament both took immediately very seriously.
Mary tried it with whomever would have listened to her and would have granted her protection in doing so. She tried to drag the French on her side at first. When this didn't work, she tried the Italians, through the Pope. then came the Spaniards and ultimately the Scots. And they all fell for her.
The reasons for her mad conviction of being the only true Queen of England were inculcated into her by her family due to some contentions they had already back in Henry VIII's Reign.
All this though was certainly not enough to make her the legitimate Queen of England and she should have contented herself by already being Queen of the Scots.
Anyway, she remains a pathetic and sad figure in History and well deserves a movie such as this one as a remainder that at times it is better to be happy with what one already has, rather than wanting the whole pie.
In this instance Mary truly was too immature and too arrogant to admit defeat even if it loomed right in front of her eyes.
And arrogance as we all know, gets so often repaid with a harsh punishment. In her case she lost her head over it.
Some may say that she fought for religion's sake. Is any religion a valid justification for human sacrifice? Especially of other people, rather than your own. Of course not, and yet Mary never hesitated in sending innocent people to be slaughtered in her name.
Some may pity her, some may condemn her, but the fact still remains that she was an intriguing figure wonderfully portrayed by Vanessa Redgrave. And right or wrong, she did exist and should therefore be depicted in at least one movie.
Between Katie Hepburn and Vanessa, I still prefer Vanessa. Glenda Jackson reprises her role Elizabeth R in this one and she's one strong butch of a woman, a hard nut to crack. No wonder that men lost their heads (in more than one way) for her.
Anyway, this one with Elizabeth and Elizabeth R, should be movies to be bought and cherished dearly like good wine. After all it is seldom they make movies like these.
And if you're interested by more Tudor Lore, try also ""Henry VIII and his Six Wives"", ""Anne of the Thousand Days"", the filmed Play by Robert Bolt ""A Man For All Seasons"".

1343381,4,B00004REFE,"Redgrave does a spirited job in the title role as the headstrong and romantic queen who came to an unfortunate end.

Mary claims the throne much to the dismay of her Protestant half-brother James Stuart (McGoohan) and England's equally Protestant Queen Elizabeth - who eventually decides to ""eliminate"" her dangerous cousin...Vanessa Redgrave brings a tremulous, romantic-goddess quality to Mary; Glenda Jackson is likeable but contemporary in this version: she gives Elizabeth a sort of campy humour.

1343382,3,B00004REFE,"I read once that this phrase was the last bit of embroidery Mary Queen of Scots did before her execution, and meant that even though Mary herself was to be executed and never assume her rightful place as Queen of England, her son James would indeed become King on the death of the childless Elizabeth I.
This movie does not include that embroidered piece, but we certainly cannot miss the thread of the disputed inheritance of England's throne. What always struck me about Mary Queen of Scots was why she thought she could succeed as Queen of England when she couldn't even manage to control Scotland; since then, I have visited Scotland and learned more about its turbulent history and so have a better appreciation of what Mary was trying to do in Scotland.  However, what I have noticed about most of the reviews here is that they speak of the actual history of the rival cousins, and don't say all that much about the movie, so perhaps that is where I shall now turn my attention.
Nutshell plot for those out there who really can't follow the complicated history involved (and historians take note, this is how it is in the MOVIE, not how it was in real life): Mary (played by Vanessa Redgrave) is the only legitimate heir to the Scottish throne, but ever since she was a small child has lived in France, where she was even married to the Dauphin (heir to the French throne). Elizabeth's (Glenda Jackson's) claim to the English throne can be contested because according to the Catholic Church, her parents' marriage was invalid and she's a bastard. Elizabeth's chief rival would be Mary since she is a direct legitimate descendant of Henry VII, but whew! everyone expects Mary to spend her whole life in France as Queen of France. If only! Mary gets widowed at 19, and goes back to Scotland to claim her birthright. She's a product of the French court, lively and laughing (and Catholic), while the Scots are dour and poorly dressed and not laughing and becoming Presbyterian. Culture clash? Oh yes. And then there's Mary's illegitimate brother (Patrick McGoohan), who's used to running things and wants to keep on running things--she's upset with that, but not up to overcoming him. Meanwhile back in England, Elizabeth gets a brainstorm idea: what if she sends Mary's captured white horses back to England along with a really worthless but handsome young claimant to the throne, Lord Darnley (Timothy Dalton)? Yep. Lonely Mary falls hard for the guy, proposes, and marries him after a really whirlwind courtship. Morning after, heck no, not even that long, Darnley starts bossing everyone around, including her, saying he's the King of Scotland, and he's also a bisexual. Dour presbyterians and half-brother are unimpressed, but use him to knock off Mary's most trusted advisor (who here is also Darnley's lover). Mary bears a son, the future King James of Scotland/England. Then Earl of Bothwell (actor unknown to me) decides he wants in on the action, and before long, he, the brother, and the dour presbyterians (and so it seems Mary) cook up a scheme to blow up the house where Darnley is being kept now that he has syphilis. Plan goes awry somewhat, because Darnley climbed out the window and escaped the blast, but luckily others are on hand to strangle him. Mary then marries Earl of Bothwell.
Elizabeth doesn't like this much. She considers Mary bad news and a bad queen, acting in this immoral fashion. When Mary eventually flees to England because she has been overthrown and forced to abdicate, Elizabeth promptly has her rival imprisoned for the next 19 years, until evidence surfaces that Mary is conspiring for the assassination of Elizabeth. Then, she is beheaded.
So much for plot. Is this a good movie, though? Well, parts of it are. Great costumes for the women (those Son of Frankenstein sweaters that the presbyterians wear are not quite stylish, though). Patrick McGoohan's portrayal of the brother is also  on target; Timothy Dalton is unsavory as Darnley. This is really the first time I've ever seen either Glenda Jackson or Vanessa Redgrave act. Glenda is wonderful: her portrayal is sympathetic--I understood perfectly her concerns. Vanessa is playing a type of plaster saint; her Mary is a victim, never having to take responsibility for her actions. If she were really this stupid, frankly, she shouldn't have lasted as long as she did. I find this a major problem with the movie, and that it makes it difficult to stomach such length with so little personal complexity in Mary's character. How can she be portrayed as a good woman when she helped blow up her husband? How can she be portrayed as a good mother when she was doing nothing in particular to safeguard him or even be with him? Good people don't usually act in these ways, and that's why I didn't like this movie, all in all. Up with Elizabeth!",1006819200,11,4840,4.795209580838323

1343384,4,B00004REFE,"This is a stunning period epic, though not historically accurate. Then again, these historical dramas seldom are. Nonetheless, Vanessa Redgrave, in the title role of Mary Stuart, the first Queen Regnant of Scotland, is luminous. She plays the beleagured Scottish Queen to perfection, at times skittish and capricious and, alternately, commanding and royal. Patrick McGooghan is marvelous as her bastard half brother, the dour Earl of Moray, who is coldly implacable in his ambition and desire to sit upon the Scottish throne. Nigel Davenport is excellent in the role of the virile and sexy Earl of Bothwell, whom he plays as a man of some integrity, who, while ambitious, is loyal to Mary, whom he loves. Glenda Jackson is magnificent in the role of Elizabeth I of England, imperious, wily, and intelligent, a master of political intrigue and statesmanship. Timothy Dalton strikes the only discordant note, as his portrayal of the dissolute Lord Darnley is one dimensional and falls flat, leaving the viewer to wonder what Mary saw in him in the first place.

The film begins with an idyllic scene in France, which shows Mary with her then husband, Francois, the King of France. He dies a premature death, and there being no love lost between Mary and her sharp tongued mother-in-law, she returns to her native Scotland, where she is Queen in her own right. When Mary, a staunch Catholic, arrives with her retinue in Scotland, she is given a most unroyal and barely civil welcome by her half brother, the Protestant Earl of Moray, and the Lords of the Congregation. She is also repudiated by the Calvinist reformer, John Knox, who denounces her in no uncertain terms. Mary is surprised by his vitriolic attack, as she is quite progressive for her time and believes in religious tolerance. She is all for worshipping according to one's own conscience. The terms of her reign, however, are finally made clear to her by her half brother, whom she, understandably, hates by now. She, an anointed Queen, is to be a puppet, and he, the power behind the throne.

Meanwhile, Protestant half brother dearest intrigues with the Protestant Elizabeth I of England. She is concerned about Mary, a Catholic Queen with a legitimate claim to the English throne, as her own kingdom has some unrest between Catholics and Protestants. As a direct result of the intrigue, Mary makes a most unfortunate marriage to the dissolute Lord Darnley, a handsome but morally weak noble with a proclivity for insalubrious activities. She soon provides Scotland with an heir, but her marriage to Darnley is doomed and sets off a chain of events from which would follow murder, regicide, and a second marriage to an ambitious Scottish border lord, the Earl of Bothwell. This event is ultimately the catalyst for an enforced abdication by Mary and exile to England, where she is under house arrest for nineteen years. Her son and husband denied her, this most unhappy of women is finally caught in an intrigue with Catholic English lords. Elizabeth I reluctantly orders her execution upon a finding of treason. In the end, however, it is Mary, who has the last laugh, as Elizabeth I is childless, and Mary's son, James, would one day ascend to the English throne, being next in the line of succession.",1001635200,63,3267,4.916666666666667
1343385,1,B00004REFE,"What a dissapointment!  Among other things, when the film opens it takes atleast 10 minutes to figure out where the story is taking place, and it depicts two meetings between Mary and Elizabeth that never happened!! Historically very irresponsible!

1343386,4,B00004REFE,"The major mistake of Mary's life, which led to all her other disasters, was Marie of Guise's decision to have her daughter raised in France as the bride of the Dauphin. Feted and spoiled by the French Court Mary grew into a narcissistic young woman who believed the world revolved around her and it was her absolute right to have whatever she wanted when she wanted it.  Political operator she surely was, but alas neither shrewd nor savvy, her penchant for intrigue proved disastrous because of her inability to accurately read other people and tendency to operate on wishful thinking. Her main aim on her return to Scotland was to obtain something better than that remote heretical Kingdom. The success of her early reign was largely due to her indifference to Scottish politics which she left to her highly able, and quite loyal, half brother the Earl of Moray. When her negotiations for the hand of Don Carlos, heir to the throne of Spain and criminal lunatic, fell through Mary's ambitions turned to England. In her mind her claim was much better than Elizabeth's and she was certain she'd get massive support from the English Catholics. Her marriage to Darnley was motivated both by her desire for that worthless young man and for the English Crown - to which he also had a claim. The marriage, opposed not only by Elizabeth but by Mary's own nobles, was the begining of her downfall. Darnley proved to be weak, vicious and a major political liability. Besides Mary met somebody else, James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell. He was violent and unscrupulous but also completely loyal to Mary, as his father had been to her mother during the latter's troubled regency. That her sexual relationship with Bothwell began long before her supposed rape is proved by the fact she miscarried five month twins during her captivity at Lochleven, after being married to Bothwell a mere three months.  Bothwell and Mary had good reasons for wanting to be rid of Darnley but the means they hit on must qualify as the most idiotic in the history of political assassination. Darnley was seriously ill, probably with syphillis, and being nursed by his wife after an eleventh hour 'reconciliation' at a remote house called Kirk o' Fields. The logical course would have been to slip the invalid a quiet overdose instead Bothwell and assorted co-conspirators decided to blow the house up with gunpowder. Mary, just to make her complicity more obvious, after leaving the house on the fateful night to attend a wedding sends back for an expensive coverlet on her bed. Worse still Darnley escapes from the house before the explosion and has to be finished off by hand - his cries clearly audible to the neighbors.  As far as Mary was concerned with Darnley out of the way the coast was now clear for her and Bothwell. She either didn't realize, or didn't care, that her Lords opposed the match and her people were appalled by it. The result was outright rebellion that led to her imprisonment, forced abdication and eventual flight to England.  From the moment she set foot on English soil Mary intended to steal Elizabeth's crown. Typically she overestimated both the support she could expect from English Catholics and from the Kings of France and Spain and her various plots were notable for their ineptitude.  Mary Stuart was accessory to the murder of one husband and abandoned another the moment he ceased to be of use to her. She was a shameless liar insisting that nobody had the right to question the word of a Queen and died with a lie on her lips, swearing on the bible that she had never wanted Elizabeth's death, an oath given the lie by her own written words. She was in short a rotten human being as well as a bad queen.",989625600,8,3711,4.72952086553323
1343387,2,B00004REFE,"The conflict between Mary Stuart and Elizabeth I is one of the truly great matchups that history has to offer -- which is why it is nothing short of astonishing that, to date (2000 talking), no filmmaker or playwright has done anything remotely approaching justice to it. What makes this film's failure to break that cycle particularly acute is that no two actresses have ever been better suited to these parts than Vanessa Redgrave and Glenda Jackson.(Redgrave is even tall, like Mary!) Jackson, of course ,had already given the definitive performance of Elizabeth in the superb British television miniseries ""Elizabeth R"" -- the difference being that there she had a script that at least attempted to be worthy of its epic subject. This film, like virtually all of its predecessors, treats Mary like a refugee from a Barbara Cartland romance novel, a woman concerned first and foremost with finding the Right Man. The real Mary was a shrewd and savvy political operator who, for the first five and one-half years of her six-year reign, defused a complex religious situation that might have taxed the abilities of Elizabeth herself, successfully suppressed three rebellions (by taking the field against them in person, something her Tudor cousin never did), and instituted the first decrees on religious tolerance in the British Isles. The eternal mystery about her is why, in those last six months of her reign in 1567, she went utterly to pieces, behaving in a scandalous fashion that virtually compelled her subjects to overthrow her (in what was arguably the first popular revolution in European history). The most plausible explanation is that she suffered a complete moral and physical collapse after being raped by Bothwell, and having been led by him to tacitly connive at the murder of her husband. (The dreadful paradox of being a queen, whose entire position depended upon being seen by the world as an inviolate being, having to cope with the ultimate violation, with all of the political and religious explosiveness that would have entailed -- now THERE'S a theme to engage a real writer!)Also, this film seems not to know, or care, that to invent not one, but TWO meetings between the queens is not only to change history -- it is to be writing about two completely different people. The fact that Elizabeth had never seen Mary was probably what ultimately gave her the courage to execute her; while Mary lived and died never having laid eyes on the person who had controlled her destiny more than any other. The film's failure to develop any number of the rich characters in the story is really inexcusable. What, for example, about Mary's several confrontations with John Knox, the father of the Scottish Reformation? The perfumed and bejewelled queen, sitting on her throne, and arguing theology (including a woman's right to wield political power) with the fiery-eyed, ascetic, bearded Knox, a prophet right out of the Old Testament -- any writer who doesn't thrill to the prospect of dramatizing THAT ought to turn in his word processor. I give this film two stars only because Redgrave and Jackson are goddesses among 20th-century actresses,and can never be really dull. Too bad that this time around they are a pair of emeralds in a tin setting.",973036800,54,3267,4.974405850091408
1343388,5,B00004REFE,"""Mary, Queen of Scots"" is an enthralling and colorful film, with strong performances by Vanessa Redgrave in the title role and Glenda  Jackson as the formidable Queen Elizabeth I.  Regretfully, the filmmakers  couldn't resist the temptation to embellish history by staging a  face-to-face meeting between the two monarchs (which never actually  occurred), but that's the only complaint I would offer.  If you're  interested in the intersecting fortunes of the Tudor and Stuart dynasties,  played out against a backdrop of court intrigue and explosive passions,  then this is a film you won't want to miss.
I note some inaccuracies,  however, in the reviews posted by Amazon.com's Marshall Fine and customer  Katharine Williams.  For example: Mr. Fine writes that Mary ""claims  the Scottish crown from her mother upon her death,"" which gives the  false impression that Mary's mother was the previous sovereign (whereas  Mary's mother was simply Regent of Scotland until Mary reached the age of  majority; Mary officially became Queen of Scotland during her infancy, as  the only surviving legitimate child of King James V of Scotland).  Also,  Mr. Fine states that Mary, a Catholic, ""runs up against religious  prejudice"" from her Protestant cousin, Queen Elizabeth I of England  (not true; Elizabeth tolerated both Catholics and Protestants in her realm,  and she did not engage in religious persecution).  Rather, the enmity  between the two queens stemmed primarily from political considerations  (after all, Mary fomented instability in England by encouraging the  plotters who wanted her to seize Elizabeth's crown!) and also, inevitably,  from the personal rivalry that existed between the only two female  sovereigns of the day: Mary and Elizabeth, related by blood and presiding  over neighboring kingdoms, were naturally curious about -- and intensely  competitive with -- one another.
Finally, Ms. Williams, in her otherwise  very intelligent and thoughtful comments, describes Mary as ""Queen  Regent"" of Scotland (no such title ever existed: one may be Regent, or  Queen, but not both simultaneously).  Instead, Mary was ""Queen  Regnant"" -- meaning that she was a monarch in her own right, as  opposed to being a king's consort.  Also, Ms. Williams says that Mary was  ""Queen Claimant"" of England -- again, there has never been any  such title.  (Clearly, Mary DID attempt to claim Elizabeth's throne, so one  should simply describe her as a ""claimant"" -- a statement of  fact, but not a title in itself.)
For anyone who wonders about the basis  for Mary's claim to the English crown, Mary was the granddaughter of  Margaret Tudor (sister of England's notorious King Henry VIII, who was  Elizabeth's father).  The kingdoms of England and Scotland were finally  united at Elizabeth's death, when Mary's son (already King James VI of  Scotland) became King James I of England.",965088000,75,2884,5.290465631929046
1343389,4,B00004REFE,"This film took a huge risk in casting two superb and very well known actresses in Vanessa Redgrave and Glenda Jackson as the two Queens featured in this flick and it has paid off enormously as their chemistry, talent and  skill really pay off in this otherwise drawn out and inaccurate film about  the fascinating though tragic life of Mary Stuart, Queen Regent of  Scotland, Queen Consort of France and Queen Claimant of England.  While she  was foolish in some of the routes she took during her reign of Scotland and  imprisonment in England you I have always thought she deserved to be  remembered for her positive characteristics as well as her negative ones.  Stong-willed, noble, a loving mother and devoutly religious she also was  and this film offered an interesting and sympathetic insight into Mary's  life whilst still making us despise her in other ways.  From what I know of  her, which I confess is not as much as I'd like it to be at the moment, I  do think she this is how I would have perceived her had I known  her.
Although I absolutely hated the fact that in this film the Mary and  Elizabeth meet (far too huge a liberty to be taken as for all we know had  they done so it may have changed the course of history) I did find it  interesting.  Not bad but maybe when I've read more about the regal  cousins-once-removed I will be desperate to make my change of opinion  known!",960854400,5,1396,4.464285714285714
