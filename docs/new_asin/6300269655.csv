7808042,5,6300269655,This is the second release in a series of classic WB cartoons. It is a wonderful break from all those violent video games and cartoons that kids are exposed to these days. These toons don't teach disrespect or filthy language as many of the animation toons and games do today. They are just laughable cartoons that will not shock you are kids. Stay away from the junk animation of today and start collecting classic WB cartoons like this one. It's a good buy and will not teach kids violence and give them nightmares.,1420934400,,517,4.56989247311828

7. The Hole Idea (1955, McKimson)

There aren't any outstanding ones here, but they're all very well done. ""Quackodile Tears"" marks the return of Art Davis as a director after a thirteen year absence. His unit disbanded in 1949, and he remained as an animator for Friz Freleng's unit. You can catch some of his animation work in ""14 Carrot Rabbit."" Also, ""An Egg Scramble"" marks the first appearance of Miss Prissy, who would later go on to Foghorn Leghorn fame. ""The Hole Idea"" is probably the best on the set, because of its obscurity. Robert McKimson animated the whole thing himself because of an animator strike going on at the time. No doubt the worst episode here is ""Cats and Bruises-"" horrible animation and much of it re-used.",1296777600,2,1149,4.862244897959184

So I bought this video and it kept them glued to the TV and loudly laughing throughout!  Since then I have bought several Looney Tunes videos.  They're always the first things they want to watch.",1241136000,2,431,4.5
