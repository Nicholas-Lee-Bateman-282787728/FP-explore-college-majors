3965870,5,B002PRYL9C,"One can't help but compare this series to the David Lean Hollywood epic...but it is an unfair comparison. They are two completely different products. Without taking anything away from this 11 part series, it makes Lean's effort all the more admirable considering he had to to condense a big Russian novel into 3 1/2 hours of mass marketable entertainment.

But back to this Russian production: If you have always wanted to read Pasternak's book, but had a hard time getting into it, or want a crash history course in the Russian Revolution and its aftermath, or just want to watch a top notch serialized classic novel beautifully filmed and acted (comparable in overall quality to BBC classics like I,Claudius and Upstairs/Downstairs),then get this DVD. It will transport you to 1905-1929 Russia.

BTW: We had no problem with the formatting or subtitles.",1367020800,21,854,5.049645390070922
3965871,5,B002PRYL9C,"This is one of the best mini-series I've ever seen.  I have seen the David Lean version of Doctor Zhivago several times and wholeheartedly agree that this version is much better (I have not seen the BBC version with Keira Knightly).  The Lean version is very enjoyable film but lacks the depth and character development of the Russian mini-series.  In the Russian version I particularly liked the earlier episodes which portray the heated ideological atmosphere of pre-revolutionary Moscow and the last episode in 1929 Moscow.

I found the characters in this version far more interesting than those in the Lean production.  In the movie, most of them seem one-dimensional; in the Russian version, they are more human, showing both attractive and unpleasant sides of their personalities.

My only negative comment has to do with the quality of the DVD disc.  I experienced problems with episodes 7 and 8 and with episode 1 when I viewed it a second time.",1356912000,14,953,4.955974842767295
3965872,5,B002PRYL9C,"I am not going to review the movie itself, just the DVD and it's quality.

The DVD video is in 4:3 frame, widescreen 16:9 letterboxed.
The video seems quite compressed. It's a double sided single layered DVD instead of dual-layer double-sided.
Still perfectly watchable though.
The case says 4:3. My Blu-ray player reads it as 16:9; it automatically crops the video for some reason.
On my PC it shows as a 4:3, so I manually crop it to 16:9 in VLC.
Subtitles are near perfect, with the rare text vanishing too quick to read since they talk too fast.",1354406400,10,549,4.545454545454546
3965873,5,B002PRYL9C,"I sat there and watched this product of modern Russian TV/cinema-photography 'gob-smacked' at the divergence from the much lauded David Lean 1960's production. The two are 'poles apart' and the differences are so great that a casual viewer might not recognise them as the same story. The more recent offering featuring an improbable Keira Knightley is closer to the original than Lean's attempt but nothing compared this version.
To get some idea of what I mean perhaps you might contrast Joe Cocker's version of 'With A Little Help From My Friends' with the original version recorded by the Beatles.
If you are interested in Pasternak's original story, in Russian history, the 1917 Revolution and its aftermath, or just want to see a fantastic mini-series with some breathtaking Russian backdrops, then this is a must see.
Acting, by the well known Central Partnership cast, is superb and the sets are incredibly detailed, at least as good as anything the BBC produced in its glory days.
Buy it ------------------ and have the pleasure of writing your own review.",1305072000,35,1064,5.051136363636363
3965874,5,B002PRYL9C,"This is the by far the best version of Zhivago.  Notably, it effectively communicates the deep Christian spirituality present in the book and character of Zhivago which gives the story such meaning and gravitas, and which is ABSENT from the previous two productions.  The casting is perfect; the length of the series allows one to truly appreciate the complexity of characters who are connected through this web of life and destiny.  I thoroughly enjoyed this series and the Russian language adds a whole new realistic dimension to it.",1257897600,25,535,5.056818181818182
8377277,5,B002PRYL9C,"well done adaptation of the book; well acted; attractive actors of the proper age to portray the books characters; definitely fills in plot holes of the other film versions, but the DVD transfer leaves something to be desired: lackluster color plagues the entire film",1521936000,,267,5.090909090909091

8377282,5,B002PRYL9C,"Its a great movie and more accurate to the author's book. Very different than the Omar Shariff""s movie production. I appreciate the service and speedy delivery. It was intact without damage and of good quality. Thank you for your service and low price.",1440806400,2,252,4.883720930232558

8377286,5,B002PRYL9C,"3 dimensional character development! Lean's version still carries the high ground with regard to panorama, but it leaves out the political and geopolitical fractures that are needed to put the love story into a richer and ultimately more satisfying and nuanced context.",1368230400,2,269,5.428571428571429
