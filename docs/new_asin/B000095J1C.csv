7989525,1,B000095J1C,"Don't be fooled by the misleading titles or the two-for-one movie offer because both these movies are supreme garbage. The plot........well there really isn't one. The acting.........what acting? Special effects.................non-existent. Save your money........for if you buy this disk the only enjoyment you shall receive is using it as a frisbee and tossing it out the top-floor window of your home. Hey, that's not a bad idea.",1086134400,,433,5.575757575757576
7989526,1,B000095J1C,"Two independent films on this disk.  They share a measure of erotic horror as well as low budgets, bad scripts, non-existent acting and failed film techniques.  While indies usually have small budgets, these other factors are not requirements.
Vampire Carmilla is vaguely based on the classic Sheridan Le Fanu story.  The story is set in modern times in a small town.  We have a woman looking into the life of an estranged sister.  We suspect she did not know about the sister previously.
Some stupid plot devices (like finding a jewelry box and assuming it must contain a diary) are added to endless camera pans across trees and town streets.  I can only guess that the film maker though it added a level of art to the film.  It doesn't.  There is even a car that keeps running even though it is out of gas.
Game of Pleasure is about a cutting edge virtual reality program, a computer virus, and some hackers.  The game simulates sexual situations but a virus causes death in those that use it.  The company is using a hit man to recollect the beta copies.
The program exists on CD-ROM but most of the computer equipment is ancient (programers are using 5 1/4"" floppies).  In one scene the hackers are in a warehouse with their contacts.  They are using a very old terminal to hack into someone's system.  While the customers watch.  Either the director knows nothing of computers or they expect the audience to know nothing.
Of the two films, Game is the better solely because it does not stop for endless pans after every scene (the scrip is actually long enough for the film).  As a measure of how bad these are I fell asleep during Carmilla at least nine times and Game at least four.",1077667200,,1689,4.546357615894039
