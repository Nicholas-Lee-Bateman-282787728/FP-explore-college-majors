4334319,4,B004DOTKBO,"The product was in good condition and was what it said it was, and at a decent price, but there is too much Bill Engvall on the DVD; so I would advise buying individual cuts of the comedian you like best rather than this.",1305504000,,221,4.045454545454546

4334322,2,B004DOTKBO,"This consisted of a lot of short skits by the comedians. About every other one was by Bill Engvall. ALL of the skits were when the comedians worked in small nightclubs, long ago. None were as good as the Blue Collar dvds. Only one short skit was by Jeff Foxworthy.",1484179200,,264,4.3

4334362,2,B004DOTKBO,"I bought this movie hoping it would be as funny as the Blue Comedy Tour. This obviously shows us in their infancy because the glue, that holds this team together just hadn't sealed yet. Nobody had the timing in their jokes that they do today. How they got this past the film makers is really mind bogling.",1387411200,,305,4.368421052631579
4334363,2,B004DOTKBO,I noticed that several of the sets for the people who are seen more than once are repeated which is too bad. I wish there had been either other material in their place (either from them or other people) or else just delete the multiple jokes (thereby making it shorter in length). The video quality is also not very good.,1387411200,,321,4.366666666666666

4334369,2,B004DOTKBO,"I like their later stuff a lot better.  It was Okay.  The price was right since it was on sale, but I would never pay full price.  In fact, I didn't keep it in my collection.  I gave it to the Senior Center as a Bingo Prize.",1360713600,,224,3.702127659574468

4334372,5,B004DOTKBO,"If you are a redneck and like performers such as Larry the Cable Guy, Jeff Foxworthy, and Bill Engvall then you would love this DVD.  Some of the settings are from earlier performances, but still hilarious.  Get it if you can!",1353715200,8,226,4.487804878048781

4334376,3,B004DOTKBO,"If you find this on sale, then you might want to buy it. Otherwise rent it. Foxworthy is funny, but Ron and Bill had a lot of practicing to do before they were famous. I bought this on sale, but for other people just wanting to laugh for one night, YouTube this or rent it.",1339372800,,273,3.981818181818182
4334377,5,B004DOTKBO,"This item is a bargain -- if nothing else to see Ron White (that's right - just to see what he looked like back in the day) and Bill Engvall (as he channeled Garth Brooks).  You can also see how these guys honed their craft throughout the years; they weren't always so smooth and polished. It is equally amusing to see the fashions from the 80's (what WERE we thinking?)and many of the other comedians were very good in their own right (Vic Henley, John Fox, etc.). I actually like viewing several comedians versus just one.  I break this DVD out when I need a good laugh.",1326067200,12,572,4.336448598130841
4334378,3,B004DOTKBO,This is just a bunch of clips from comedy club appearances back in the 70s.  Some funny stuff but not much and several appearances by Bill Ingval had repeated material.,1310947200,,168,4.6

just stated out and some, you may have never heard of before
they are all funny and  maybe a little on the silly side

 there is no cussing or  or anything bad , but some jokes
could be a little serious, (JUST JOKING)!",1510358400,,379,3.883116883116883
