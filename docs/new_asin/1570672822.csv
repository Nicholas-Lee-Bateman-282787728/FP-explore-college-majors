188095,5,1570672822,"This so explained the why's and wherefore's of my weight battles for the past 6 decades. We really need to get educated on the importance of what we eat daily. It will realistically keep you out of the hospital as we age.

It is an excellent education on the subject. Goofy yes, not glittery, but stay with this; you'll remember forever.

Thank you DJL, you done good.

I have seen it personally help the stubbornest people resolve their health issues through diet by understanding the drivers behind our general appetite. If you or someone you know needs to transition to a whole foods plant based diet but doesn't believe they can transition and more importantly enjoy the transition to this healing diet, then this presentation by Dough Lyle and his book on this subject are a must have.",1496707200,,478,4.829268292682927

7797164,5,1570672822,"Douglas Lisle gives three lectures that are intelligent, fascinating, occasionally funny, and extremely helpful in understanding the psychology and neurobiology behind hunger and food cravings.  You are not crazy; you are not alone; and there are good reasons for your unreasonable cravings!  Lisle provides important information for understanding why we crave the foods we do, and what we need to do to conquer those cravings for good.  I found this DVD to be immensely informative, reassuring, and encouraging.  I plan to watch it again, and share it with others.  It could be an important piece in changing your life.  Recommend some knowledge of 'whole food' eating beforehand.... such as the DVD, Forks Over Knives, or the book, China Study",1429920000,5,745,5.218487394957983

Such a refreshing relief to have found him and his method...I could listen to him everyday!  This is finally the answer to so many questions about what is going on and how to address it effectively. Check out all his other lectures as they are equally good!  Buy it don't hesitate!",1409270400,3,427,4.435897435897436
