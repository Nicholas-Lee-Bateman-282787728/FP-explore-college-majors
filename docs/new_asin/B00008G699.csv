7982457,3,B00008G699,"Nice, Readers' Digest look into the life and times of Jesus of Nazareth, with some surprisingly complex reenactments. As a historical fictin writer who has placed several books in that milieu, I was pleased to see all the ways the producers of this film got the details right, from the terra cotta olive oil candles to the carpentry shop. Everything feels as it should, and much more than that, this is not a heavy-handed missionary tract, but rather a simple retelling (in cursory strokes) of the life of Yeshua bar Josef. Enjoyable, if lightweight, and especially appropriate for younger viewers.",1257552000,8,598,4.99
7982458,5,B00008G699,"This video uses expanded footage from the ""Jesus"" film as the backdrop for narrating the Gospel of Luke, word for word from the Bible.  It is an excellent resource for Bible teachers or for anyone who enjoys a  visually meaningful but strictly biblical narration of Luke's gospel.  It  is easy to recommend this entire series for local churches, school  libraries, and multi-media Bible teachers.",960768000,7,396,5.125
