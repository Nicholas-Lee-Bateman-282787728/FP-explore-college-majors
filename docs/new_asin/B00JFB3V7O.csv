6356498,5,B00JFB3V7O,"I found the material to be very good and thorough in this system, especially if you are new or intermediate to options.  Half of the topics covered were already covered with the previous system by the same author.  I found ""Extreme trading"" portion interesting, I wish the author would have redo the section since it was recorded back on 2008 and the resolution were not so great.  But over-all it was a very good system when use with other strategies out there.",1406937600,2,462,4.609756097560975
6356499,5,B00JFB3V7O,"This is a very good course if someone is brand new to options trading like i was. But before buying this course i recommend a couple things first. Join TD ameritrade and download the ""think or swim"" (TOS) trading platform. Next ask ameritrade for a free 30 day trial to investools education and take that course for 30 days to learn the ropes. You can also use the TOS and investools customer support if you have any questions. Than after you learn the basics on stocks and you practice everyday on TOS, than buy the genius options trading. Pay attention to all the video's, take notes, and keep paper trading before you put up your real $$. This course will lead you in the right direction.",1404604800,39,691,4.492063492063492
6356500,5,B00JFB3V7O,I think this is a great course for someone who really wants to take their trading knowledge to the next level.  Very in depth course and great customer service,1403827200,6,159,4.482758620689655
6356501,5,B00JFB3V7O,"Just a fantastic course, even for myself who is completely new at this. There's a lot of information on the videos so I would recommend taking notes or just listen to them over an over (none of the main 16 videos are very long). My goal is to make a living trading (I am exhausted working for someone else, doing the M-F 9 to 5 grind, and making peanuts doing it) and I really believe this set of videos has put me on the path to achieving that goal.",1473552000,4,450,4.067415730337078
6356502,5,B00JFB3V7O,"The videos in this package were very easy to understand for a somewhat novice. I am trying to get into options trading more. I have previously done 3 trades in years past and intend to get back into it. I love the thrill of trading and last time I made a profit two out of three times. However with the minimal investment made, I think the risks are worth it to trade provided you have some kind of system that allows you to manage your emotions and not get caught up in the moment. Note: I received a discount on purchasing this trading system. And the opinions shared are my fair assessment.",1472169600,2,593,4.303571428571429

6356518,5,B00JFB3V7O,"As a beginner I'm still learning from this course, and plan to use it as a reference as I gain more experience. The instructor has many years of options under his (money) belt and presents each facet of this complicated subject clearly and with examples one can repeat in paper trading, or virtual trading mode. Books are helpful but having it explained with the trading platform right in front of you is better from my perspective.",1413504000,,432,4.697368421052632

6356521,5,B00JFB3V7O,Great material! I was in need of a 101 course and someone to speak about the basics instead if assuming I already knew what he/she was speaking about. The TOS examples help tremendously when putting these techniques into use.,1412467200,3,225,4.794871794871795
6356522,3,B00JFB3V7O,"I reviewed the course once, so my review may change after a second viewing. I enjoyed the course, and it was explained in a very easy to understand manner. It was what I would consider a course more geared for beginner's, and I was looking for more of an advanced course. The concepts explained were simple and it provided clear directions for entry, exit, and money management. I would recommend it for someone looking to swing trade or trade longer term direction.",1411516800,6,466,4.695121951219512

6356529,5,B00JFB3V7O,"This course arrived on time and as promised. It contains 16 plus 2 bonus training videos all running about 20 min or so. As an extra bonus is a section on Forex trading with another 21 training videos. These videos cover all you need to understand and trade options from basic to advanced. For me personally I am also reading books on options just so I can fully understand option trading but it is not necessary as everything is covered in the videos. For the cost of these video you have nothing to lose as it will cost you more if you just dabble without training in options. I have not completed all the video's as yet due to over approx 400 hours of material, but so far I am very impressed",1408665600,7,695,4.2727272727272725

8650507,4,B00JFB3V7O,"So, i purchased this DVD based on other customer reviews. I'm not a complete beginner to options, so i have some idea of what was going on, but i definitely needed the extra help. Overall, this DVD was helpful. However, there are a few things i'd like to point out, from my point of view, that could make this product better.

First and foremost, there are no live trades that take place in this course. He shows you where you could enter a trade, and exit a trade to capture max profit -- but this is all done in hindsight. He uses a historical price database in the trading platform to show you were you could enter and exit the trade. With all due respect, even i, a lowly student of options, could look at a historical chart and say where and when someone should enter/exit.

Secondly, his explanation of theta as it relates to vega was confusing. I've only seen the video once, but it could have been a bit clearer. I'll definitely have to give the entire course another go.

Last but not least, he explains to us that over trading is a bad thing and he believes that trading options is the best way to go about trying to make money in the market. Then why, might i ask, did he not show any videos of actual options trades, but did feel the need to insert about an hour long  video of him day trading. I wanted to see options trading, not daytrading.

Those are mostly my cons on this video. But even with these, i still give 4 stars because there is good information in here for beginners.

Overall, it was 40 dollars well spent, i feel. If you're new to options, this is a good, inexpensive starting point and builds a proper foundation for future education.",1485820800,12,1665,4.337620578778135

The thing I like about this teaching is it is presented in a very matter of fact style. Having traded options on futures and stock options and still do,I can tell you his strategies work.
This Course is not slick,patronizing,or geeky, it's for real people who want to trade and experienced traders that might see something they can add to their trading tool belt.",1478995200,4,476,4.546511627906977
