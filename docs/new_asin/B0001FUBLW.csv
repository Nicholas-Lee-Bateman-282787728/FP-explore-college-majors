8598115,5,B0001FUBLW,"The first part of this DVD shows scenes of a concert in Sttutgart (1993) and it was the reason to me had bought this DVD. Songs from Shades of God and Icon are played in an excellent performance, and confirm these memorable days, with versions still better than the studio versions (see Mortals Watch the Day, Pity the Sadness, Your Hand in Mine, AS I Die). The second part of this DVD shows a full concert at The Sheperds Bush Empire (1998), where the band, with One Second full lenght, searched a modern approach to this creative song. The One Second's songs are played with high-fidelity, but any from the ""old"" songs had their interpretations modified, with any clean vocals in some parts(""Hallowed Land"", ""Remembrance"" and ""Dying Freedom""), losing gain, but still representing all the power mixed with elegance that made of Paradise Lost always a reference in metal scene, with the greats ""Embers Fire"", ,""Forever Failure"", ""Shadowkings"", ""As I Die"" and ""The Last Time"", the high points of the show. All promo videos are there too, becoming this DVD an excellent item to the metal fans.",1128297600,3,1091,4.839572192513369
