2481809,3,B000E1OI8U,"My family has lived in the South since it was jungle, since before Mississippi was even a territory, much less a state. But I moved away from Mississippi thirty years ago, and from the South altogether over twenty years ago, and I have nothing good to say about the South. My criticisms of this movie, then, aren't due to wounded Southern chauvinism.

After I'd rented this movie, I knew I'd want to watch it repeatedly, so I bought it.  I don't regret that decision, but the more I watch it, the more suspect the film, and its makers' intentions, become.

From the first, I knew that the film is profoundly inaccurate: to call this a mirror of the South, or a deep exploration of Southern culture, is about like saying the truth about New York City is found in the voodoo subculture of certain parts of Harlem.

But I thought that was probably a mistake of perspective, a matter of the filmmakers not knowing any better--and maybe getting taken for a ride by the Southerners. (That's something Southerners get a kick out of--pulling the legs of outsiders--and it's a well-developed, socially-prized art form.)

I have come to think, though, that some of the errors are just too glaring to be honest mistakes: For instance, the total absence of any reference to race, which is surely central to any story of the South, especially its religion. Or the film's completely omitting the fact that the religion portrayed in the movie is not only generally shunned, but held in contempt, by Southern evangelicals, who are the vast majority of religious people in the South.

Then there's that strange-looking old crippled guy who tells so many stories--like the confabulation about the Sears catalog. On the assumtion that this is a documentary, you might think he's some backwoods poet, some exemplar of hillbilly wisdom, some local wonder that they've found on their search. But he's Harry Crews, the novelist and critic, college professor, playwright, etc. In the context of the movie, the presence of this (imported to the scene, most likely paid) professional writer, without his being identified as who he is, is at least a bit misleading.

I found his stories mostly fanciful, at best. For instance, I never ever knew anyone who did with the Sears catalog what Crews said ""we"" do. And I certainly never saw a greater proportion of the populace lacking body parts, or suffering ""open sores,"" in the South than in other places I've lived. The arrival of the Sears catalog was certainly a major cultural event, and we *did* all talk about it for days after it arrived--but it didn't signify what Crews said it did, and our conversations didn't take the form Crews claims, in my experience. And the story about keeping birds in the house, or birds spitting, bears no relation to anything like anything I ever heard, saw, or experienced in the South. Harry Crews is a very inventive fiction writer--and he's at it here, I think.

Sometimes Jim White seems very real, with genuine compassion for the people of whom he speaks, but much of his cosmological grandiloquence seems contrived, to me. Occasionally, he seems caught in his own pose. For instance, he declines to go into a bar, telling the film makers, ""I got no use for a place like that,"" and his disgust seems like one of his more spontaneous, authentic reactions, quite genuine.  But then in his narrative voice-over, obviously (from the difference in production values) recorded separately, he waxes lyrical about the ""great beauty"" of such ""real"" places. His contempt felt more authentic than his affectation of deep insight.

At least one of White's best aphorisms is, shall we say charitably, borrowed--""Between grief and nothing, I'll take grief."" (Faulkner, the last page of The Wild Palms.) Leaves you wondering about some of the other good lines--whether they're borrowed, too. My favorite line in the movie, ""I was looking for the gold tooth in God's crooked smile""--I certainly hope White didn't borrow that one, uncredited. But I just don't trust that it's original.

The posed musical numbers seem more like a Gothic caricature of someone's overwrought, and ill-researched, idea of the South, since few of them seem to be actual performances by local musicians. This is not documentary--this is affectation posing as discovery.

Now, on the plus side, parts of the film are an invaluable glimpse into the spiritual lives of what Southerners call ""white trash."" Though I'm the son of a rural Mississippi Baptist minister, I never had a chance to see any of this up-close in real life. This movie is, for a Southern Baptist boy, a nice chance to get to know something about a slim, unhappy slice of the South that ordinary Southern life would never allow him to see.

When the movie goes into local settings, and observes the lives and activities of the people, there's much that's worthwhile. Some of it is touching, some scary, some just bewildering. None of it has much to do with the Meaning of The South, or other overblown non-sense like that. But it has much to do with the hardscrabble efforts of some folks to get through life, well or badly, that most of us (thank God) will never see up-close and personal. To see it is very instructive, and very valuable if you can see it for itself, not as the filmmakers want you to.",1148083200,118,5296,4.819383259911894

2481811,5,B000E1OI8U,"To hear the stories of the south, being a visitor down there, living in the North - it brings so much life to what my girlfriend tells me about the south.  The south is like no other.  It is a beautiful, story-rich part of the country to which there is no other.  When they are in the barber shop and the lady begins to sing a small chorus ""...First there was a funeral, then there was a trial, hung me up in the courtyard there, let me hang up there awhile, for a while..."" - her voice raw and true to herself.  Beautiful.  As is the girl playing Amazing Grace with a saw and a bow.  The banjo playing in the beginning by the man in the woods is equally BEAUTIFUL and soul touching.  If you are to watch any documentary and like to hear stories ""and stories is everything"" this is the movie for you.  Not only do you hear about the trials and tribulations about the south, but the beauty behind religion...  See it, love it, recommend it!",1145577600,5,939,4.1722222222222225
2481812,5,B000E1OI8U,"I saw this film last year in a small indie theater and I was glued to the screen from start to end. The cinematography and soundtrack is amazing. The music is not just played over the movie, but treated like mini music videos sprinkled throughout the movie. Most of the artists share their own interesting stories and viewpoints of the South. The dark overtone of the movie is broken up by humorous storytelling of old wives tales and southern slang.

Being born and raised in the South, the social and geographical landscape portrayed in the film is familiar. Yet there is something very unfamiliar about the people and places in the film. The movie takes you through the parts of the south you don't find right off the highway. These places are the extremes of the South, most of which are stereotypes, but are real none the less; where you'll find the most poor uneducated criminals mixed together with the most Pentecostal extremists. These places most people in the South don't even know about. I guess it's the difference between being raised in the ""urban"" south as opposed to the ""rural"" south.

The south has a complicated make-up. Though this movie does an amazing job diving into one aspect, the South cannot be summed up in a movie.",1145145600,7,1244,4.701834862385321
2481813,5,B000E1OI8U,"It is sad that this movie didn't receive much promotion when it was released in the USA. It is superb. In fact, as a person who has watched hundreds if not thousands of movies, it is now rare for me to be truly impressed with a new movie, even good ones. This movie impressed me--made an impression on me deeply. I watched it three times within 24 hours--something I never do.

If you have any curiosity about the South, start here. If you are from the South, watch this amazing mirror of Southern culture. This movie expresses and documents something about the Southern soul that I don't think I've seen expressed in film before. It nails the mysteries and spiritual landscape. And it does so with such mastery of the film medium that it induces aesthetic arrest.

Ethnographically speaking, it is a movie about Southern white culture--and very much about the religious experience thereof. Very few African-Americans appear in the movie, and it would be an incredible sequel to see the filmmakers address that counterpart of the Southern culture. But, in actuality, the subject of poor White Southern culture, by itself, has not really been depicted much in recent times--and never with the genius that these filmmakers bring to the table. Yes, the music is incredible. Yes, the cinematography is stunning. Yes, the editing is hypnotic. But the real value is that the film depicts the vitality (both demonic and transcendent) that it finds without judgment.

Deeply recommended. There are some people who will watch this film and understand things differently about the world and possibly themselves afterwards. It's that kind of movie. I'm still in shock at how powerful this movie was to watch.",1142985600,7,1697,4.947368421052632
2481814,3,B000E1OI8U,"At some point early in the film White suggests something to the effect of ""This is my kind of road"" as he drives through junk yards, abandoned buildings, crumbling parking lots...

There may well have been a Wal-Mart a block away, but there's no place for such global-consumption-at-your-fingertips Generica in this flim. These nearly forgotten roads seem to be chosen more as a way to reinforce the boundaries from which White has chosen to view the world (and have the world view his music?) than for any realistic view of the South. It's scary to think this is what British people might now think of the South (if they didn't already).

I say this only because I live in a similarly sparsely-populated region way north of the Mason-Dixon - also dominated by poor, white, former democrat-now republican voting religious people with unique accents. Their ancestors found their way here when timber, mining, and shipping boomed. Not much has changed here in 70 years either.

I could drive through these ghost towns and back roads finding quirky people of various zealotries to put in a film too. I've certainly met plenty. But it wouldn't necessarily be an encompassing view of the region's people by any means. Most here and, I assume in the South as well, are far too normal and complicated for a film like this.

But - that said - maybe this film doesn't need to seek balance. They state early on that the goal of the film is to find the culture at the root of White's alt-country music - which is rural, white, poor, American. You can't really sing about bludgeoning a person to death standing in front of a display of X-Box consoles, now can you? Maybe the film finds that culture in all its glory and tragedy.

If you like Americana music stylings at all, the music is great and creatively interspersed. The film looks great. White's scholastic-minded metaphors are certainly interesting - I liked the ice cream one. I wonder if he talks like that all the time (which would be very impressive) or whether he was trying to assure the viewer that, while the film may be dominated by poor, culturally-isolated ""you're either with us or you're against us"", fire-and-brimstone religious zealots, the captain of our 1970 Chevy ship has been around the world and sees the bigger picture.

For instance, the film presents a preacher who kicked a decade of drug addiction and, obvious to anyone outside any religious extremism, just replaced it with another addiction in Christian fundamentalism. The film allows such individuals their spiritual journeys, neither endorsing them nor condemning. In so doing, it also allows some to reveal a deeper mysticism, a deeper understanding of the unity of all life one might more generally equate with Indigenous spirituality or New Agism than Christian religion. It is a side of the Bible Belt rarely revealed when its leaders are on the attack or on the defense in the media.

Nevertheless, every stereotype I've ever had of the rural South was reinforced 10-fold. Good? Bad? Neither? - it's certainly an interesting ride through the lives that write song lyrics - reminding you that the ever suburbanizing corporate economy hasn't made us all generic and predictable... yet.",1142640000,20,3216,4.889908256880734
2481815,3,B000E1OI8U,"""Trying to find the gold tooth in God's crooked smile"" - Jim White

This film will undoubtedly be banned by all the departments of tourism south of the Mason-Dixon line, mainly because it's subject is the small towns of the Deep South where the natives slavish devotion to Jesus via the Pentecostal faith produces no shortage of bizarre rituals from faith-healing to speaking in tongues.

Best of all (for film-goers) is 'tour guide', alt-country artist Jim White, who explores the region via a beat-up Chevy sporting a porcelain Jesus figurine (almost lifesize) hanging out the back with the trunk lid secured by a rope.

White is a natural storyteller and shares his bizarre memories of life in the South in between the truly freakish episodes that occur in each town as the locals gladly share their wit, wisdom. music, and sadness.

Also, if you liked the 'scene-intrusive' band in ""There's Something About Mary"" then you'll love the zany musicians that appear out of nowhere to provide musical codas to each segment here. Appalachian, folk, and black humor laden ballads dominate the score of this truly strange undertaking.

Director David Lynch (""Wild at Heart"") may be on hiatus, but these guys are filling the gap for audiences seeking bizarre characters (in REAL life). My one reservation is that some of the segments don't work as well as others so it's definitely not a perfect film, but it is 'something completely different', so if that's what you like then check it out.

If you needed one more reason NOT to go south of the Mason-Dixon line other than 'red-state-itis', this documentary has got it!",1142294400,2,1614,4.915441176470588
2481816,5,B000E1OI8U,"Wow! What an experience. I caught this documentary late one night in England about a month ago. Just as I was about to go to bed this utterly amazing documentary started to play. The moving images and music, the scenes, the ordinary and extraordinay folks of the Deep South totally blew my mind. The extreme cultural difference both calming at one end of the scale and totally disturbing at the other made me compelled to purchase this DVD on release.

Much has already been written about this documentary and it all is very valid. Seeing prisoners talking of experiences, churches where all can be cured with a blessing. No right and no wrong. A clear divide in an amazing community yet a divining common goal. A hard way of live but throughout a common spiritual believe.

Shame it was put on so late on BBC2. I will write something more substantial once I have watched this again on the anticipated DVD. Jim White - what a superb storyteller. Just telling it as it is respecting those around him. A+;",1140393600,5,1003,4.597765363128492
2481817,5,B000E1OI8U,"Legend has it that Andrew Douglas was given Jim White's ""The mysterious tale of how I shouted 'the wrong eyed Jesus!'"" for Christmas a few years ago.  So enthralled was he by the CD that he decided to have Jim White as the narrator of this hauntingly gorgeous documentary.

Visitors to, and even residents of the deep south, might not notice what lies just beneath the surface while traveling from one town to another. After all, at first glance, other than the ubiquitous kudzu and Waffle Houses, things aren't so different from anywhere else in America, with Wal Marts, strip malls and delapidated shopping centers dominating the landscape.

One of the main themes here is how little life has changed in the last 60 or 70 years for poor, misdirected, and uneducated white folks. People don't want to acknowledge that this part of society exists right before our very eyes.  If you're just willing to come with Jim White and take a peek beneath the surface, he'll show you.

One thing that might strike you when watching the documentary is the intense sound of the bird life from the south that ties things together. It's almost like being in a jungle of South America if you listen for it closely, but most people who live in, or visit the deep south, tune this out on a daily basis. The sound of this bird life can actually be quite eerie once you start listening for it, not only in the movie, but as you move about in the south. The inclusion of it throughout the movie serves as a powerful meatphor for the eerieness of the poverty and despair, the pentecostal religion, sin, and the search for redemption among many people in the south.

Some may find all this a little disturbing, but the stark and melancholic beauty of the south also emerges.

Several of White's songs are included, along with a great cast of other musicians.

There's no overt political message here, but the types of people depicted in this movie sadly, and ironically, comprise a significant part of the constituency of the Republican party in the US.

Setting aside any subtle or not so subtle political message, this is an absolute must have for your DVD library.",1139616000,14,2145,4.6534391534391535
2481818,4,B000E1OI8U,"This is not a documentary about the South. This is a movie with a concept, an idea about the south, the Flannery O'Connor, murder ballads, pentecostal south alternative-country singer Jim White wants us to see. As a movie, it's an excellent one with an wonderful alternative-country soundtrack. The only problem with this movie is the preaching-teaching side of Jim White. He wants us to see the poor, white, weird, ultra-religious, devil fighs God South he defined as being the South. While he's worried on showing us the gotic side of dixie, he repeats himself dozens of times. The blue highway he stops is spiritual, the mountains are spiritual, small towns are divided in a line between God and Devil and that's it.

2481858,4,B000E1OI8U,"We follow Jim White as he tours the South in a beat up old V8 car with a wooden figure head of Jesus in the trunk. Along the way we meet some characters who add a Southern flavor to the proceedings. There is an awesome soundtrack playing and, in parts, the documentary crosses over into an almost dream like setting which makes it more a poem or essay somewhat. It, like the south, moves melodically along at its own pace.

Jim White talks about the south with a melancholy overtone. He notes all the towns are the same, church, bar, prison, truck stops etc ... and he also notes that growing up, you either choose god or hell. He's very reflective and, as he's spent much time away from the south traveling, not just in USA but the world, he has a good base of expansion to reflect against. He does a wonderful encapsulation of a southern town using an ice cream cone he'd just purchased at a stop-n-go.

He isn't speaking down about the south but trying to put the essence of the southern culture into words that, for those who haven't lived it, could understand.

I enjoyed the documentary a lot as, there's no political message, no issues are addressed and there's really no over analysis of anything. We just meet people who's lives seem somewhat dogged by their upbringings and struggles for identity.

It's true that there's somewhat of a derogatory element to the whole term ""the south"", whether this stems from slavery, or religion is anyone's guess but, nonetheless, it's there. White doesn't so much play into this but reflects himself off it. We go into a prison and some of the inmates open up to us about what put them there (other than themselves of course), the common overtone seems to be boredom. The boredom is captured by their unwillingness to accept that all answers lie in religion, these troubled souls, in their youth, were searching for more and turned to being bad as a way to live an exciting life. Misguided or not, they have a point and, they are real.

I enjoyed the documentary, which is more a piece of art, and loved the soundtrack. It's worth your time as it doesn't try to fix anything and doesn't try to garner passion from you.",1316908800,,2165,4.5268542199488495
2481859,4,B000E1OI8U,"The funny thing about everything written about this movie thus far is that everyone thinks it applies just to the South. Take the same film crew through rural New York, Ohio or Pennsylvania, and you'll find the same people, the same cast of charactors. Use the same bias or preconceived aim points and you'll have basically the same movie without the accents. I could show anyone with the inclination places in New York that are almost dangerously inward, with all ""outsiders"" viewed with suspicion. I've been on bike rides through Pennsylvania and Ohio and met the same people, experienced the same unwelcome and suspicious glances as I walked into various bars or restaurants. This movie is far more about poverty in rural areas than just the south. Poverty breeds ignorance, with politics and life views based on urban legends and the like. If those offended really want to ""get even"", I'd suggest making the same movie in New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania, and make sure you're in the more poverty stricken areas of those places. Some of the more arrogant in the north that subscribe to the stereotypical southern redneck might be surprised at the home grown versions in their own backyards.

2481860,3,B000E1OI8U,"The idea for this film was just the sort of quirky, spontaneous notion I find appealing - someone receives a strange album of music for Christmas, so strange the recipient feels compelled to find out what sort of place, geographically or otherwise, could have produced the person who made the music.

The risk with this sort of project is ending up with so much subjectivity that the viewer feels trapped. It's like someone insisting on showing you their entire collection of thimbles or bottle openers or hubcaps - your interest, however genuine, in their interest is not proportional to their interest in their interest. The producers ensured this lack of escape by having the creator of the album, Jim White, be our sole guide.

What White takes us to is a collection of lives that exhibit both thoughtful living and living that simply kills time. The thoughtful lives show us folks who have a full sense of individuality and who are doing what they can with what they have to express themselves. In fact Jack White's (White Stripes) frayed life in rural Tennessee as shown in ""It Might Get Loud"" could have been part of this film, almost. Almost, because Jack White has a choice, at least in terms of resources.

Obviously showing us the McMansions of the northern suburbs of Atlanta would have had nothing to do with the POV of this film. However, there's more to the South, genuinely, than a somewhat repetitive stream of poor white people teetering between heaven and hell. These same people, with their own cultures, can be found, junked school buses and all, in the Ozarks, rural Pennsylvania, or for that matter in the Southwestern desert.

What it does, and does very well, is give us a peek into some of the more remote(backwards?) areas of the South that many people may not reaize still exist.  Many of the people shown in the movie ring very true to me, having grown up among people very similar.  Many of the stories told are similar to stories that my grandmother told me.

The conversation about Ted Bundy at the truckstop(which happens to be in my hometown of Jasper, FL) is very much a real-life kind of experience.  Ted Bundy was the man who changed my part of the world forever.  A huge amount of our innocence was lost when Ted Bundy kidnapped and murdered Kimberly Diane Leach in 1977, and yes, we still talk about him a lot even today.

I rented the dvd because a South African heard an American's album, became enamored of an album title, decided to adapt a storyline and 7 years later I was listening to Jim White aka Mike P. talk about an incident that I remember happening in ""Warlock Country"" back when we were allot younger. You almost have to be in this story to understand the meaning behind the connected ruminants. Its a long visual prose. Enjoy it! Allot of the 'poor' South is well represented in this film. Nothing fake. I am sure glad that they didn't blow Jesus up in the end. 8^)",1268524800,,661,4.426229508196721
2481874,5,B000E1OI8U,"The premise of the movie is simple.  The director listened to a record by a recording artist and wanted to find out more about that artist's world and influences.  So he sets off and has the singer/songwriter guide him around.

Some of the criticisms of the movie are silly.  The film does not claim to be a representation of the totality of the South.  It doesn't set out to explore the way every segment of Southern society lives.  I get the sense that those criticizing the movie for not showing the other side are embarrassed and ashamed that there are poor uneducated trailer trash in their states and don't want to be lumped in with them.  To me that is disrespectful to the people whose lives are being shown in this movie.  It is as if their stories and lives do not deserved to be filmed and explored.  And if they are, they should be totally marginalized by having disclaimers that read 'these are not real southerns and do not represent the south, we're better than these people' In short, those critics want these people to be ignored so as not to negatively affect the south's image.

Well these people are people and they have lives and stories that are interesting and deserve to be seen and heard.  Jim White serves as a good guide, and the film makers allow the subjects to express themselves in their own way.  The stories you hear and the images you see are ones you might never see or hear if it weren't for the film.  Our society worships beauty and success, so those on the fringes are rarely seen or heard or given respect.

The movie has no plot or story arc, it is a compilation of vignettes and images that give an insight into a few poor small town southerns' lives.  It's kind of nice to see a movie that doesn't try to be political or get some message across; but just to present people and their environment.  The cinematography is great, there are some really haunting images.  The one that stuck in my mind was the female radio preacher who looked to be in her 80's.  Her face was so unique, I can't really describe how she looked but it was arresting.

So, if you like off-beat stories and movies, I'm sure you'll like this movie.",1254614400,6,2163,4.430379746835443
2481875,5,B000E1OI8U,"I saw this film a few years ago at Roger Ebert's festival of lost classics that he puts on every year in his hometown of Champaign, Illinois. I had never heard of Jim White, but was intrigued by the title, so when my friend suggested going, I said sure. Jim White and Andrew Douglas were there for the panel discussion after the film was over and gave some insights into the film and why they made it. Sadly, Ebert was unable to do the moderating, having recently had surgery for cancer, but he was in the audience, and others took his place, very capably. White even did a mini-concert of a few songs related to the film.

One thing that White stated categorically in his talk was that this film was never meant to be a definitive portrait of the American South. It was a portrait of his experience growing up in a southern minority religion, Pentecostalism, and a picture of how that mindset affects people who are more or less trapped where they are by poverty and ignorance. He made it out, but many never do. All this is filtered through the British sensibilities of Andrew Douglas, who was raised religion free in the UK, and for whom the setting was as exotic as the jungles of the Amazon would be to a Midwesterner. In my opinion, Douglas's objectivity raises the film above the ordinary; the things he chooses to film highlight the essential strangeness of much of the Southern culture, most of which is not this extreme.

I can say this because, although I grew up in Illinois, I was born in Biloxi, MS to parents whose families came from the poor white farmer backgrounds of Kentucky and Tennessee, an area that has its own potent mythology. No one in my family's past was Pentecostal (termed holy rollers by my mother), no one handled snakes or spoke in tongues; no, they were one and all Southern Baptists of various stripes. Two of my great-grandfathers were Baptist preachers, in fact. The film shows what is generally termed ""poor white trash"". My family comes from the poor white dirt farmer culture, also known as ""hillbillies.""

While my background is not identical to what is portrayed in this film, it is similar enough that I can say that White is faithful to what he saw. Hillbillies can be as devoutly religious as holy rollers; I remember my grandmother's funeral, where there was weeping and wailing to a large degree, though no fainting and being slain in the spirit. The difference between my background and White's, I am trying to say, is a matter of degree. I recognized many of the tropes as being the same in both places, particularly the woman broadcasting the religious sermon. It wouldn't take too hard a twist to make that woman my grandmother. As I said, a matter of degree.

Oh, and I loved the music in the film and was not upset at non-local musicians providing the soundtrack, or by Harry Crews, because this was not meant to be a factual portrait of a place and time, but one man's interpretation of it, with a little help from his friends.

On edit, I remember something I was going to mention but forgot. The bar scene, the one after White refuses to go in (he is a recovering alcoholic, so this is reasonable), is remarkable in its similarity to the filming of the Pentecostal service. The dancing and shaking and general uproar in both are eerily similar, one fueled by alcohol and one by the Holy Spirit. In White's talk after the film showing, he sang a song he wrote about this kind of experience. The applicable line is a chorus/coda; A bar is just a church where they serve beer. This struck me forcibly. So many people use religion in the same way that others use alcohol. It is an addiction, often a substitute for alcohol or drugs for the recovering addict. It is not that for every churchgoer, not even for most, but White shows us in this film that it can be. I thought this was the most profound thing about the whole film.",1236124800,6,3880,4.529243937232525
2481876,5,B000E1OI8U,"This documentary captures an energy that can`t be denied and shows us people grappling with a world view that doesn`t seem to allow anyone to sit on the fence.

2481877,5,B000E1OI8U,"This is a VERY seductive documentary. Sneaky almost. You could start out a Yankee intellectual, nodding away, checking out the always cool backwoods backwards Southern hick ""culture"", sarcastically noting to yourself ""A documentary of the South made by an English director - hah - what's the denominator...bad teeth?

Then somewhere in between the Louisiana swampland and the West Virginia coal mines, you get so captivated by the gorgeous local color, and lowball sincerity and hiball poetry of the narrator host, that a Stockholm syndrome kicks in, and, I swear to God, you start feeling a little wood for the Pentacostals.

A real Rosetta stone for unlocking the documentary is a scene in a Motel 6 room somewhere in Appalachia. Two guys are kicking back, doing an old folk blues number. The singer looks vaguely familiar in a Waylon Jennings kinda way - cowboy hat, outlaw sideburns and beard, casual clothes - and I remember thinking, ""looks almost like David Johansen"".

Later, the credits roll, you check out the additional footage, and guess what? It WAS David Johansen. Now think about this for a moment. Here's an actor and performer of consummate taste. He was once front man for the glam rock/proto punk New York Dolls. Then he had a popular run as Buster Poindexter, lounge singer tux-traodinaire, and here he is, totally submerged in and imbued with the persona of a Southern folk blues artist. A bit of a latter day Leon Redbone.

You can call this ""Southern Gothic"", and I do, and it has this core irony that Johansen illustrates by his very presence. On the one hand, the culture has an authenticity and a history, that go way back and way deep, and many of the people in this film are so a part of it they have no other perspective. BUT, some do, and there is also an existential element, exemplified by ""choosing Jay-suss"". You can adopt the culture, if it's done with a pure heart, and not be self-conscious or hypocritical. This point is made very clearly at the beginning of the movie by the narrator who explains that he grew up in the South, left it, and came back, deciding to be ""the very best Southerner he could be at that point"".

So the documentary has a whole nuther layer to think about. The conflict and unity possible between the heart and the mind. John Huston's adaptation of Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood is the only other film I can think of that takes you so deep into this other world right before our eyes, or at least, within five miles of the Interstate. Beautiful film. Beautiful music. A beautiful docu-poem. And done with a pure heart.",1213747200,7,2582,4.716186252771618

2481879,5,B000E1OI8U,"This is a film about a region, its people and a kind of music.  There is a haunting uneasiness in this music: in the high whine of steel and string, in the subject of the lyrics, and the facial expressions. That haunting wraps and holds you from inside; it is comforting.

Jim White's music, and the music of the other artists is about strife, and untimely death.  The cinematography pulls you along on this trip. I found myself anticipating each scene from the hound running through the swamp, to author Harry Crews ambling down a dirt road telling us about how stories were made up in the south,  about ""perfect"" Sears and Roebuck catalog models with no missing fingers, who still had both of their eyes.

Knowing Jim's music (which inspired the documentary) made it all more rich and understandable.  Some have looked in, without knowing the poverty, the regional isolation, or Jim's Wrong-Eyed Jesus music, and have written reviews saying that this is an exploitation of unfortunate people.  But they missed the beauty of the struggle, and the triumph in  the people's stories.",1198713600,6,1081,4.836956521739131

No doubt, Floridian writers are all the time walking down country roads talking into car windows and electric guitar players are performing in the middle of a junk yard to an audience of one.
Why would you focus on Staten Island born David Johansen aka Buster Poindexter aka The New York Dolls frontman as an example of southern music?
The Chevrolet, which figures prominently in the film, sure sound like a Mopar when it starts up. Was that just a shout out to the Dukes of Hazzard or did you just think folks from the south ""is too dumb to notice""?
Speaking of the south, the film seems to take place mostly in Appalachia, not the deep south you are led to believe. Of cource a chap from the BBC probably doesn't know the difference nor does a Californian or a New Yorker, which are the main players/producers.

2481896,5,B000E1OI8U,"This is a strange move to watch.  It's not a documentary, even though it resembles one.  Probably the best way to think of ""Searching for the Wrong-eyed Jesus"" is that what you are watching is one man's visual poem of a (large) region and people.  And White's version, which is that of a musician's, is highly selective, jumping from the deep South into Appalachia, with hardly a blink - though these two regions, though similar, also have many differences.  White can be annoying in his own way, since many of his musings regarding the South, can sound both pithy and full-of-it at the same time.  If you are from the South, it seems pretty darned manipulative, even more so when you realize this film was done for BBC.  White, clearly, is pushing buttons for a foreign audience, but he does it with such a clear-eyed sincerity that he's easy to forgive.  It's kind of like listening to the Rolling Stones singing ""Hand of Fate.""  You enjoy the song -- it rocks -- but you also know it's a bit hokey. Whatever his sins, White loves the South and its people, so roll with it.

But where does that leave the viewer?  Well, it's not the real South with all of its complexities, but to be fair, that would take a series.  Still, the parts that White offers up are real enough, and important to him, so I suggest you allow him his idiosyncracies, because he does entertain with some pretty fine music by some excellent folks you may not have even heard of.  Cat Power, 16 Horsepower, The Handsome Family, to name a few, along with good story telling by the original literary wild man, Harry Crews.  Accompanying many of the songs, are haunting film images that will hang with you.  For example, the Handsome Family, singing from the porch of nearly flooded shotgun shack, or David Eugene Edwards (who strikes me as some sort of musical genius), from 16 Horsepower, singing Wayfaring Stranger out in the woods, his hands dancing lightly over his banjo, while his voice sends chills down your spine.

2481900,4,B000E1OI8U,"This movie is really a story about the influences in Jim White's life.  As he personally discloses he is not a ""native"" to the South but that the South is in his blood and has made him who he is.  As such this is a journey into that stream.

By the title it would seem that we are to meet some odd, eccentric, off the wall slice of Americana.  Perhaps it is due to my background but I did not see the individuals in the film as odd at all.  Different maybe but not odd or otherwise eccentric in a way that is shocking.  They are just real people.

The film is overall a ""religious"" film in the sense that in these travels with these characters it is religion that defines who they are.  It is ultimately a faith journey.  And in this the film is quite beautiful.  For anyone who has traveled in rural counties, whether in the South or in Appalachia country, religion is the defining feature.  To understand this culture one must understand the faith.  Jim White makes a decent host but sometimes he tries too hard to be deep or profound.  He, like the viewer, still remains outside looking in.

Many of the shots, quite lovely at that, are choreographed and staged.  Journey through prison, Pentecostal churches, a coal mine and other characteristic haunts such as a restaurant whose banner proclaims Jesus saves.  Wonderfully quirky yet genuinely beautiful people.

But the highlight of the film is the music.  Musicians play songs in eerily beautiful settings in an attempt to have the landscape appear as odd as the characters being portrayed.  I suppose alt-country is a fitting label but the music is wonderful.  Religious themes are tackled from an outsider's point of view, discussing the challenges of belief and doubt and the difficulties of life with lovely, haunting musicianship.
