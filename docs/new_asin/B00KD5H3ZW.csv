6414892,3,B00KD5H3ZW,"""What if"" is a great movie which we totally enjoyed and will watch over and over. That being said, the other two did not get our attention. I would give 5 stars for ""What if"" but can't even rate the other two as we could not make it 10 minutes into either movie.",1480550400,,262,3.9622641509433962

6414898,5,B00KD5H3ZW,"I loved these movies.  They are light-hearted, but hold a valuable lesson in life.  They were all family rated, which is great because nowadays, there is so much out there that I don't want to expose my 10 year old to at this point.  Life has too many unpleasant aspects that our children do not need to have all that evil put into their heads at the age of innocence.  Time and age will come all too soon as it is.  Let them enjoy the pleasant things for now.",1436745600,5,460,4.123595505617978

8657711,1,B00KD5H3ZW,"What If...was predictable,as most all other movies are, including the other two movies in this set. It was the best of the three. I  thought Me Again was going to be a cute,silly movie based on the previews. Every character was depressed. The  whole movie was depressing. Marriage Retreat was no better. Three depressed couples trying to fix their marriages. I usually enjoy David White and his Pure Flix movies.",1525132800,,412,4.871428571428571

8657717,2,B00KD5H3ZW,"The rating is for the movie ""What If."" The DVD arrived on time, in good shape, and was a fair cost. My review has only to do with Jenkins Entertainment, whom produced the movie called What If. Thanks to actor Kevin Sorbo, It is a good movie, with a good message. The bad; I can not believe Jenkins Entertainment used actress Kristy Swanson as the leading Christian wife and mother, whom was the center of all Christian values. What does it matter who plays the part, as long as they do a good job? Children use actors as role models. Christian children are no different. The reason to show children this film is to install good Christian values. As soon as the children see this movie, they will look up the actors on the Internet. When they see that the lead Christian female is actually a playboy bunny, with nude pictures all over the Internet, they will wonder what else is fake. Was the message fake also. The producers found a good Christian man to play the lead, they could have done the same thing for the leading female.",1493424000,4,1029,4.449735449735449
