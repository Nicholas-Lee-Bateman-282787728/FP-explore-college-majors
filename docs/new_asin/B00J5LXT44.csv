6335491,5,B00J5LXT44,"Review of content. No spoilers.

I can't explain one of my main reasons for vastly preferring this over the first season without going into a pivotal plot point that occurs early on in the proceedings.

What I *can* say is that in season 2, Spacey settles down and grows into the role of Frank Underwood, playing the part in a far more subtle, more nuanced, less hammy way. Fans of his Machiavellian methods will be delighted to hear that he is still as devious and as ruthless as ever. Ditto his wife Claire (a compelling performance from Robin Wright).

All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable exploration of ambition at the heart of power in the company of the Underwoods who never once take their eyes off The Ultimate Prize. Unmissable.",1398124800,102,736,4.6461538461538465

6335679,5,B00J5LXT44,"The continuing tale of Political -Power - Games.
'Frank Underwood' has manoeuvred his way to the office of 'U.S. Vice President.
Business Man 'Raymond Tusk' who has the ear of friend and President, 'Garrett
Walker' has recommended the appointment.
'Frank' sets out from the word go to drive a wedge between 'Tusk' and the President,
but will his efforts to do so come back and bite him at a later date.
Making an enemy of 'Frank' or becoming a threat could prove fatal as political colleague
alcoholic 'Peter Russo' didn't live long enough to understand.
Both 'Clair' and 'Francis' are not beyond having affairs, facts that could cause both issues,
for both 'Underwood's'
Manipulation and wheeler-dealing is a way of life for 'Frank' -wife 'Clair' has an equally
single minded approach with her business affairs.
Neither are high in the loyalty-stakes they simply use people to achieve their aims,' Frank'
has a team of foot soldiers to do his bidding led by 'Doug Stamper'
'Frank' has been playing political games to undermine supposed friend and President.
While political games are being played, 'Zoe Barnes' a former lover that 'Frank' has used
because of her connections to the 'Press' becomes another victim of the Vice presidents
fury, her boyfriend 'Lucas' also with the 'Press' believes 'Frank' is involved with two deaths,
are his investigations getting too Hot for Frank ?
There is so much going on can 'Frank' and 'Clair' stay ahead of the game, cosying up to
'Garrett' and wife 'Tricia' all a part of the overall plan.
Meanwhile 'Raymond Tusk' is doing all he can to get even with the manipulating Vice
President, a plan which includes publically exposing 'Clair's' indiscretions and laying
the seeds of doubt about 'Frank' in the Presidents mind.
Is the plan coming off the tracks for the 'Underwood's' or will they prevail ?
One thing is certain 'Frank' and 'Clair' do.....deserve each other.
This is a terrific political drama which is certainly compelling viewing.
Just hope the series continues.....'Kevin Spacey' is wickedly convincing as 'Francis
Underwood' ........This a must see TV series.",1468108800,2,2112,5.07183908045977

Underwood has turned into a cartoon villain, and the story lines are unbelievably poorly written and just lazy (It was way to easy for Frank to become POTUS). The only interesting parts revolve around Claire, played by the amazing Robin Wright, but even her whole rape storyline was cringeworthy. If this show wants to be a primetime soap, fine, but it needs to stop taking itself so seriously. Since the first episode, it acts like it is this prestige drama, when it is just a very cheesy show.",1444780800,2,552,4.642857142857143

If you hope for the quality and substance of the original English mini series, you are in for a big disappointment. I stopped enduring this half way through the second season.

6336086,4,B00J5LXT44,"Kevin Spacey as the conniving Francis Underwood continues in Season 2 chewing up the scenery.  Underwoods schemed and killed his way into the Vice Presidency (as he snidely comments to the audience at his swearing in, without a single vote cast in my name, a heartbeat away from the Presidency).  The first episode starts with a bang and the murder of a key player from Season 1.  Its evident that Underwood won't be satisfied until hes sitting in the big chair in the Oval Office and watching him out maneuver, manipulate, and run roughshod over his fellow pols is great entertainment.
Robin Wright as his wife Claire is a force to be reckoned with.  Formerly the head of a large non-profit she slides into the role of the VPs wife and starts her own wheeling and dealing.  Wright is stunning; she does not look her age for a moment and clearly has a personal trainer on retainer.  Her beautifully tailored wardrobe is superb; clad only in black, white, cream or gray with minimal accessories, she projects the style and grace reminiscent of Jacqueline Kennedy.
We have some fine supporting cast as well with Gerald McRaney who seems to be specializing in rich SOBs lately since playing George Hearst in Deadwood and another baddie Barlow Connally in Longmire as well as billionaire entrepreneur and friend of the POTUS, Raymond Tusk this season.  Another Deadwood alum, Molly Parker is a military veteran and junior senator that Frank manipulates into filling his shoes as Whip leapfrogging her over more senior candidates.  Both actors give great performances.
Its hard to go into much detail without giving too much away but needless to say theres an abundance of scheming , conniving, backstabbing, and murder to hold your attention.  Theres even a weird and creepy implied 3-way between Frank, Claire and their Secret Service Agent Meechum and also the apparent murder of right hand man Doug Stamper to close things out.  All I can say is that Im on board for Season 3 and wonder just how much lower can Francis Underwood sink?  Get a shovel and start digging!",1431993600,,2066,4.824362606232294

With that said, I thought season 1 was decent, not great but decent but basically went downhill. Why is the call girl still in the show and on top of it focusing on her lesbian relationship. The Weakest president and emptiest suit. Then to top it off, how would anyone trust Kevin Spacey's character at all...Ok ok...I know you fooled me the last 10 times, but the 11th time, I'm going to trust you not to screw me over. Then what was up with the little make out session with secret service person, the wife, and Frank.

I tell myself that political machinations of the sort seen here simply couldn't happen for real, yet some of it did in my country only a few years ago.

It was also racist, predictable and they basically turned the Democrats into Republicans and had them do things the Republican Party has actually been fought doing. Basically the only reasoni finished it was that it is fun to hear Kevin Spacy talk like a crazy person.

Spoilers:
Racist things: there is an evil Chinese dude named ""fang"" (not kidding)
The poor African American BBQ guy is now from a bloodline of gang bangers, this basically killed the character and helped the plot in no way.
Remy hooks up with a white lady but she broke up with him and is with a random white dude now. This also helps the plot not.
Basically a lot of things that made the show intesting gets flushed away this season. I could go on but I don't care enough to.",1425686400,,858,4.329192546583851

6336458,5,B00J5LXT44,"This series is as good in its way as Downton Abbey and The Vikings are in theirs.  A couple of the scenes in this second season are so shocking I had to rewind to be sure I saw what I thought I saw.  As a conservative, I'm pleasantly surprised that liberal politicians are portrayed as ruthless, ambitious, elitist, and narcissistic as many are, though rarely described that way in the mainstream media.  Still, the strength of the series is that the characters are not ""types"" but individuals with their own peculiar strengths and weaknesses.  It's unusual that compelling characters disappear (some through murder) to be replaced by new people just as compelling but in different ways.  It keeps the viewer from boredom.  Perhaps the greatest strength is the quality of the acting, not just by Spacey and Wright but by all the actors playing lesser roles.  The quality of the writing varies from episode to episode but is generally well above average for a TV series.  I watched all of Season 2 in two days it was so riveting.",1425168000,,1028,4.70391061452514

Kevin Spacey is a very gifted actor who projects cynicism, unbridled ambition, and a completely sinister side of his character, Francis Underwood. The inner miind of the man (Underwood) is revealed to us as Spacey confides to the viewer what his real thoughts are in any situation.

6336531,3,B00J5LXT44,"This is a remake of an excellent British series, but it does not have the charm of the original. It does not even have the political depth of the original.

For one the main character who is the democratic majority whip in the House of Representatives in the first season, then the Vice President in the second Season and will be the President in the third season is just hilariously unbelievable. That man is a mixture of Spiro Agnew who ended up in prison, Richard Nixon who was illegal from beginning to end with his tapes and his Watergate business and Al Capone who ended up in prison for evading taxes, all in one, the latest American political trinity. Kneel down and bow your head to pay homage to that new democratic Titus Andronicus. As such no one can believe the slightest detail of the plot. Political fiction has to be believable otherwise it is just plain shooting itself in the foot, if not both feet.

The plotting in Washington DC is well known but it is pushed so far that it looks like the IRA in the good old days. That man has some kind of private hit man on his staff who can kill or dig up garbage on anyone, provide women at a price and generally to embarrass the man with pictures or push the man into some kind of alcoholic coma that will enable the boss to come behind and finish the job.

That boss does not even hesitate if he has to kill someone. He is not even as careful as Al Capone who was never indicted for a murder. He becomes so hateful, being himself full of hate and him inspiring hate in us, that we cannot even enjoy the plot anymore. He has no empathy, he has no compassion, he has no sympathy for anything or anyone. He inspires disgust and loathing.

And his wife is not better. She is a dressed up female version in a skirt. They don't even have a dog or a pet of any sort. They are monsters and such people cannot last long in politics because sooner or later, and nowadays sooner than later, someone will talk and some trash collector will collect the trash about them and expose it. Whistle blower in politics are like fungus in a cesspool.

Whats more the scenic panorama of Washington DC is so evanescent that we lose the charm of London and the Palace of Westminster not to speak of Westminster Abbey next door. Washington DC is like a hygienic and sanitized version of an old European capital.

You may enjoy it if you do not believe in politics and look at it as if it were some Sherlock Holmes enigma or some Hercule Poirot investigation. But it is not.

If you are a fan of any of the actors in this series, but especially Spacey, this is a must-watch.  I am not even normally a fan of political dramas, but the acting and writing are so good that you are able to get more into the psychology of the characters themselves.

6336977,2,B00J5LXT44,"Don't get me wrong, I love House of Cards, it's the best political thriller series I've ever seen. It's very well written with an excellent leading performance from Kevin Spacey. This is not a review on the content of the show, but on the product, otherwise I'd be giving this 4 1/2 stars easily. The packaging that this season comes in is exactly the same as the packaging the last season came in, you'd think they would have fixed those issues by now. It's difficult to remove the disks from the casing and I'm afraid I'm going to scratch up the disks every single time I take them out or try to put them back in. It's designed unlike any other dvd packaging I've ever seen and it's terrible. After all of the complaints they received from how the first season was packaged, you'd think they'd fix those issues.

I highly recommend this show. It's sharp, entertaining, and tense, but the case these DVDs come in is absolutely horrible, bad enough to warrant the product rating at a two stars. They really should have just designed their case to be more like the cases every other DVD comes in, because they're far more convenient, efficient, and practical than whatever this is.",1417392000,5,1180,4.592417061611374

6337065,5,B00J5LXT44,"The series pulls you in, but demands close attention, to minimize the inevitable loss of some of the politico references, the dense plots, very fast dialogue, etc. Spacey and Wright's performances and the writing behind them leave all of us who aspire to non-sociopath status squirming some for being so fascinated by two so amoral characters. Distressing when you sorta want them to get away with everything  Empathy for the devils. Lots of solid performances by ""minor"" characters who might have had to be asphyxiated or thrown in front of trains to advance plot agendas. Au revoir, Kate Mara & Corey Stoll. We miss you. Late in Season 2, Gerald Mc Raney as Tusk fascinated whenever he was on screen. As a boomer/geezer myself, I'm amazed when older actors like Mc Raney and Reg Cathey can be that excellent and not be household names. In Cathey's case, it's on me for not having watched The Wire or Oz. If ever I retire, I don't want to be too sedentary, but there will be a lot of the greatest TV of all time to chew on.",1414368000,,1024,4.535135135135135

6337076,4,B00J5LXT44,"I loved season 1, thought it was the best new show anywhere, and couldn't wait for this season to finally run on netflix only to be extremely disappointed.  Sure, the characters are as nonredeemable as ever, and there are plenty of political back stabbing going on, but the show is missing something, that is probably to do with the plausibility of many of the events.  When watching the episodes back to back, there are plenty of things that seem shocking because you don't see them coming, that don't really hold up to the scrutiny of multiple viewings and seem contrived and formulaic.  I can appreciate the discussion of hot button issues like abortion and human sexuality.  Friendships don't stand as far as we would want them to, and it seems that rather than having a long game the show is satisfied in giving ear service to the left with its take on many issues being championed by the protagonist, while appealing to the right by having that protagonist be against the middle American value system ad show what is wrong with the system.  It didn't seem so simple in season one, and that is a shame.",1413936000,,1107,4.627551020408164

Spacey is back as Frank Underwood and his last name should really be Undertaker. Hes Walter White in the White House. He IS the danger. I watched Season 2 in less than a week. By far one of the best shows with the best actors and actresses on television. I cannot write enough about the outstanding writing, the infectious characters or the darkness of the show.

6337166,5,B00J5LXT44,"I've been a big fan of the original House of Cards (UK series) when it arrived in 1990, and watched it many times since then. The USA version has grabbed me in big time (I'm a Brit thus seen both) it's modern and polished and Spacey is frankly fantastic in the lead role he steals the show almost.

House of Cards is slick and well cast and whilst clearly based on the original has it's own twists and theme.
Cast wise I like Spacey and his understated Francis J. ""Frank"" Underwood, devious and cunning, clever and manipulative. Robin Wright also does a very good job as his wife. I am quite happy with the cast overall.

Season two heats things up more, after the first season set the groundwork (some complained the first season was a bit slow partly down to I think laying out the characters more for viewers) Frank's lined himself up to be the Vice President..one step closer to his ultimate goal of grabbing the top job in the Oval office.

I won't ruin it with spoilers, but things do really come to a head with Zoe Barnes and Frank in a fairly dramatic way. The rest of the season shows Frank's continued cunning in destabilising an already weak President. Some complain it's a bit predictable plot wise, but then from day one we've known Frank is ambitious and wants power for himself. It's a slick production that's well directed and has some excellent performances even from supporting cast members, decent screenplay and script, good camera work and even the soundtrack delivers, nicely polished in every respect.

I'm quite happy to watch this, despite reservations initially how it would compare to the original 1990 series. They are different in feel and portrayal, I like both for what they offer viewers. Spacey has really grown on me as an actor, he seems very well suited to the role. One of the reasons people enjoy this so much? I think it's quite simple really, this portrays politicians in a way many feel is quite close to reality. Scheming, plotting, career motivated, and indifferent to the needs of the people..and will say anything to get their way up the power ladder. If you're a sceptical type this is right up your street.

If you are new to the series you do really need to start with season 1 to enjoy it fully (you will have missed many important events)
I was tempted to give it 4 stars, it's 4.5 overall for me so 5 grabs the spot. I like it and enjoy watching it.",1410825600,5,2400,4.52073732718894

6337338,3,B00J5LXT44,"It's ok.

It has more ambitious -- and just plain more -- story lines than Season 1, but that's not necessarily a positive.  None of the issues get enough airtime to make sense, much less be engaging.  The most important twist of all -- no, I won't tell you what it is! -- comes out of nowhere, and is fairly unbelievable as a result.

Even though the politics get short-changed, there are still lots of long takes of people looking off into the distance, thinking unreadable thoughts.  I often found myself reaching the end of an episode both confused and slightly bored.

Spacey is, as always, great. So is Robin Wright.  And their I Love You But I'm Going To Sleep Around relationship is one of the most compelling aspects of the series.  But most of the other characters are one-dimensional, so there's no suspense when they stick a knife -- metaphorical or literal -- in someone's back.

I loved the original UK series, but while the US version has much better production values, it's never reached the same heights.  And Season 2 doesn't change that.",1409270400,6,1056,4.629032258064516

The realism and intensity of Season 2 is such that only someone well versed in the subject can really, fully appreciate all that goes on. I state this as a high compliment in that those of us with less understanding for politics and business at this level are able to infinitely expand our knowledge through intense study of the plot depicted.

6337416,1,B00J5LXT44,"As background, I bought Season 2 after I watched Season 1 at a friend's house and loved it (!!!).  Season 2 -- oh boyz.  Not sure what their vision is, but for a while as I was struggling to get through it, I thought maybe they are going to use this season to build up the ""house of cards"" and crumble it in quick fashion for Frank Underwood.  Not so much.  Disclaimer: PLOT SPOILERS ahead.

It seems the writers are trying to focus the entire series on just Frank and Clare (Claire?).  What used to be a great series of well thought out sub plots, and a series where even the secondary characters are as complex and layered as primary characters has gone by the wayside. In ONE season -- amazing the events that happened: (1) a military pfficer is accused on national television, apparently charged via a grand jury or similar proceeding, and convicted without any mention; (2) a newly minted Vice President becomes President in one season; (3) the VP's wife escapes ANY fallout from alleging a military officer raped her, and unscrupulous photos of her affair surface -- no biggie if you are an Underwood!; (4) U.S. China relations are ironed out and messed up and ironed out again via a sex crazed Chinese businessman an a few meetings; (5) a news reporter/editor is that dumb to try to hack into or steal confidential data; (6) the media in House of Cards never fact checks...and the list goes on.

There is a HUGE requirement for you to suspend belief in this quasi-fantasy political world House of Cards now plays in. And what billionaire (Raymond Tusk) can't afford a flat panel monitor in his office?  Really??? Come on...really?

Two of my friends warned me not to buy this as they had to stop watching this season after 2-3 episodes. I now see why.",1408147200,7,1758,4.555555555555555

6337453,5,B00J5LXT44,"Fair warning, this will contain the major spoiler from season 1, and some spoilerish material from season 2, but no big giveaways. If you have not seen season one avoid the next paragraph.

It is hard to describe everything going on in season two without giving too much away. The season starts out with the aftermath of Peter Russo's killing, and Frank covering his tracks. Much of that story gets resolved within the first few episodes, although there are certainly still aspects of it out there going into the third season, and not all the lose ends get tied up. The rest of the season really focuses on Frank's continued power grab. He remains as underhanded as he was in the first season, if not more so. The plot involves China, a shady businessman with ties to the president (played wonderfully by Gerald Mcraney) and super PAC money, with Frank Underwood and his wife pulling all the strings.

The tone and pace of the show is very much like the first season. There is a lot packed into the 13 episodes and the various plot lines sometimes run parallel and sometimes intersect. The acting and writing are again stellar. Some characters from season one are gone, or only appear in the first few episodes and a handful of new characters are introduced. Much like in the first season it is sometimes hard to tell which character, Frank or Claire, is more slimy and underhanded. The both continue to use, abuse and discard anyone who gets in their way. Although Robin Wright does do a great job at bringing some humanity to Claire in the few instances where the shell breaks even if just for a few moments.

As for the discs themselves. There are actually special features this time. Probably about an hour's worth, give or take, spread throughout the individual discs. Mainly in the form of behind the scenes material. The packaging is still horrible, with the discs tucked into very tightly notched paper slots. I would definitely recommend getting the blu rays because the anti scratch coating on the discs will hold up a lot better to the packaging than regular DVDs. There is a lot of potential for DVDs to get scratched (assuming the DVDs are packaged the same way). Also a plus for the blu rays is the ability to start from where you left off if you have to stop partway through an episode. You can run in play all mode and do not have to try and find your spot again if you turn it off.

All in all if you are a fan of the first season, you will love this season as well. It is very comparable, if not better than season 1. It still has the very dark tone, and even sometimes a dark comedic tone. It is definitely well worth checking out.",1407283200,,2650,4.491701244813278

Cronyism is stark and clear and the public choice dilemma is clearly shown - just naked and the way the devil made it. The A list actors Wright and Spacey are probably necessary to make such a grim reality compelling television, but TV is a writers medium and the writing is great while leaving nothing of the reality of coercive government crime out. Tragically, it is an entertainment product and people in entertainment, as with any circle, need to get along.

However, I leave off the 5th star in the rating  because the characters are uniformly wicked with the exception (perhaps) of Claire.  This series is depressing because there are no good guys, no redeeming factors.  Frank Underwood is an evil genius who manipulates people and events to his own purposes.  There is nothing good to be said about him.  Compare this series with Homeland, for example, where the main protagonists have their good sides as well as their bad, there are always mitigating factors. Homeland is hence  not as depressing as House of Cards, more complex and hence more compelling in my view.",1406764800,,754,4.928571428571429

6337491,5,B00J5LXT44,"Never in the history of TV or movies have I ever been so fascinated by and found myself rooting so hard for such an awful human being as Frank Underwood.

Let's be very clear about this. Frank Underwood, the main character of the show played by Kevin Spacey is a horrible person. He is a liar. He is a criminal. He does some VERY illegal things at the local, state, federal, and international levels. (And I'm not talking about jaywalking and errors on his tax returns. I'm talking about 'go to prison forever' type stuff. But I don't want to spoil it by giving away details.) He is an absolute sociopath, caring only about himself. He is.....you know what? It's just easier to call him a typical politician. That pretty much covers what a bad example of humanity he is.

But unlike real life where you want to see people like this rot in jail then burn in hell, you find yourself rooting for Frank Underwood's schemes to succeed. You get behind him and support him, to the point where you feel a little dirty watching the show.

That is how well the show is written, acted, and filmed. It gets past your real life morality and brings you into the main characters evil sinister mind.

And the storyline is quite a ride! Every episode is part of a larger story arc that keeps your glues to your chair, desperate to find out what happens in the next episode. The end of the season is no exception. It leaves you mad that season 3 isn't ready to be released immediately so you can find out what Frank does next.

If you love politics and the whole underhanded nature of it, you will love this show. It shows all about the back room deals and what not that makes politics what it is.

If you hate politics because of the whole underhanded nature of it, you will love this show. It exposes all the back room deals and what not that makes politics so disgusting.

So no matter who you are, this show is going to appeal to your opinion of politics.

One of the things I really appreciate about the show is how it is very neutral between Republics and Democrats. They don't get into hot button political issues that divide our country. The show certainly doesn't take any sides on issues. They leave most of the details of laws and legislation in the background and just show how the two parties and all successful politicians are both corrupt to the core equally, and how honest well meaning politicians are chewed up and spit out by the system. Frank Underwood is a Democrat on the show, but it really doesn't make a difference. They could have him switch party affiliation every episode and you'd barely notice. That's hard to make a show about politics and not take sides. House of Cards really does that well so it appeals to a broader audience.",1406678400,,2742,4.448207171314741

The writing has remained so true to the basic personalities of each character through both seasons. The writers had to have in mind that quote, "" Power corrupts...absolute power corrupts absolutely."" I've found myself talking to, and even gasping out loud at what transpires during each and every episode. Sad to say...I , along with friends who also watch and love the series, believe the underlying theme of this show feels all too real.

Stacey's asides allows just enough comic relief to break up the otherwise extreme intensity of each episode. That's what pushed my rating up to 5 stars. While I do readily recommend this, I must add that it is DEFINITELY NOT for the faint hearted.",1406073600,,887,4.6369426751592355

And wife Claire is right up there..great role played by the always beautiful Robin Wright.  The plot twists and turns during Season Two were almost too overwhelming to keep up with.

6337549,3,B00J5LXT44,"I find House of Cards just OK, my wife likes it more.
While it's generaly well acted, I find the story unrelentingly grim and just about every charicter is moraly bankrupt. This might be seen as true to political life and ""gritty"" and I certainly have no rose coloured view of most politicians, but there seems to be very little light and shade, to the point where the dreadful behaviour of the various players just doesn't hit home after a while. I'm sure even the worst politicians manage do the right thing sometimes. (Even if for the wrong reasons.)
Some plot lines seem to be designed to catch and keep an audience, particularly the sexual adventures of the two main charicters. I found accepting that two such cool and calculating political animals would be so careless about their love affairs and casual sexual encounters. (Apparently presidential security guards are expected to take more than a bullet for their president...)
A story about a politician willing to do anything to get to the top is nothing new, this one has a bit more nudity and sex than most, but it doesn't have the black humour and faster pace of the original British version. Perhaps more American soap opera than political drama.?",1405900800,2,1211,4.771428571428571

It is so good that after each episode, you feel like you need a shower. They have only one overriding core value - preserve their individual power and position at all costs. Anything else can be rationalized. The Francis Underwood character makes a profound statement in Season 1 that some fools who come to WDC come for the money. Money is nothing. Power is what they should be focusing on. This is a big part of the current deadlock and low approval rating of Congress - they are totally focused on being professional politicians and getting the funding from the 20,000 plus lobbyists. The term, ""public service"" as practiced by our founding fathers has lost its meaning today.  The influence of the VP on the POTUS as reflected in this series is reminiscent of the Chaney / Bush eight years when the VP had more direct involvement and decision making than in any other administration.  Contrast the VP / POTUS relationship in this series with FDR / Truman or JFK / LBJ.

As a 60's + male I felt the true power of women over the men they are involved with and their ability to make the male feel invincible while, like most every day women and still run the show. The saddest part is finding out the truth about how our constitution is flagellated to pave the way for dishonest, greedy politicians on their way to the top of their Peter Principle Ladder of success. If this show doesn't explain why Dr. Kevorkian shouldn't be the White House Physician no story ever will.

6337641,5,B00J5LXT44,"This is a great show, terrific acting, in particular Kevin Spacey. You think you have it figured out and WHAM another twist to the plot. Really well performed. Can't wait to see what happens in Season 3.",1404691200,,203,4.513513513513513
6337642,3,B00J5LXT44,"The casting and acting in this series remain superb and top notch. No questions there. Special commendation to the actor who plays Doug Stamper, Michael Kelly. I hope he is nominated (and receives) Best Supporting Actor on the awards shows. Of the entire excellent cast, he stood out. The other big plus on the DVDs was the Special Feature addition on each disk with interviews from the cast, writers, producers, etc. However, that's where the accolades for this season end.

In Season 2, Sex seemed to be a character in and of itself. I kept wondering if what was being depicted was going to be used against any particular character with blackmail. (It was not.) Except the scenario in the last episode, in which one's sexuality clearly affected the other character and led to specific plot-driving events, sexuality was superfluous, even gratuitous, throughout Season 2. There was no rhyme or reason for it. The writers were clearly trying to titillate the audience, probably because the scripts were somewhat predictable. Anyone who has read Shakespeare in high school English class knows where Act II is headed: our anti-hero is going to rise to the level of his hubris and ascend to his position of power, a la MacBeth, Richard III, etc. (which, of course, ultimately begets his downfall in Act III).

Character behavior in general (not sexual) was also questionable. Would someone we met in Season 1, in a particular position - whether governmental or journalistic - truly decide to act in this way? It's dubious.

The other disappointment was the music during the opening credits. In Season 1, the melody had a strong brass harmony that was woven under the main theme to sound strong and gave me goosebumps every time I heard it. Fantastic! This season, the powers-that-be removed the brass underscore, and the melody by itself was more lackluster. Unless this change in music reflects a change in thematic elements, as well?

Those of us who post here are devotees and it's wonderful to see how much a modern twist on Shakespeare still attracts an audience, more than 400 years after the original. It just goes to show that people don't change despite better clothes and technology! ;-) Perhaps next season they will have less gratuitous sex and more believable plot expositions. One can hope. Meanwhile, enjoy the story as it unfolds. Until Act III next season!

(POTENTIAL SPOILER ALERT THIS PARAGRAPH ONLY.) One last plot reality check: For the record, a therapist cannot write prescriptions for anti-anxiety medications or anti-depressants; that must come from a psychiatrist or another M.D. A therapist is usually a Master's (sometimes PhD) level clinician who has studied academically at a university but without specific medical school training. Only those with a medical license, such as a medical doctor, psychiatrist, or physician's assistant, can write scripts. (END SPOILER ALERT.)",1404691200,2,2901,5.086134453781512

6337663,3,B00J5LXT44,"Watching the unprincipled and incredibly devious Frank Underwood rise from House Whip to President of the United States is certainly entertaining and the acting is first rate. Viewers need to suspend their disbelief in order to fully accept the incomprehensible stupidity of the dupes along the way who are brushed aside and the lack of push-back from any of the multitudes of ""interest groups"" that have their own amoral and heavily funded objectives.  Elected at the cost of billions of dollars and surrounded by armies of political operatives and bureaucrats dependent upon the President, it is difficult to conceive of any way that any personal deceptions could so quickly seize the Oval Office and overthrow a presidency.  It may be good theater to watch this play out as the work of a slick mastermind and his even more deceptive wife, but the breakdowns in presidential power we have seen -- Nixon-Agnew-Ford -- and the Clinton scandal -- were far from ""neat"".  They were messy and painful to watch and unfolded over several years.  The Bush-Cheney seizure of power in 2000 and the orchestrated Iraq War ended up with thousands of dead and tens of billions earned by War profiteers like Cheney's Halliburton.  That is a reality far darker than the murder of a congressperson and reporter.

It is also difficult to believe that simple deals over a table could bring cuts to Social Security eligibility age without massive firestorms of protest and with no mention of the hundreds of billions of dollars escaping taxation through machinations of dozens of vastly wealthy individuals who shelter vast fortunes in the Cayman Islands and in Swiss banks.  Raymond Tusk may be a realistic character, but there are obviously dozens of such corruptors buying and selling influence in Washington, D.C.. Its hard to imagine one or two such rats obtaining such unrivaled power with so many sharks in the water.  And there are obviously many Frank Underwoods in Washington, D.C. who crave power.  Fortunately, or unfortunately, they feed off each other and the taxpayers in general.  What House of Cards offers is the fiction that such evil can be contained and orchestrated by one clever mastermind.  Perhaps that is a comforting fiction when evil in our political system appears to be overwhelming.",1404000000,19,2294,5.042328042328043

6337696,5,B00J5LXT44,"I like very dark work and this series is certainly one of those. To some viewers too much darkness can push a show over the edge.  I think it did that to my husband and my neighbor, who now seem dubious about seeing season 3.  I, however, absolutely loved it. Keven Spacey's Francis Underwood is even more rapacious than in season one. He also is on a no holds barred effort to become the next president. Even Claire, his wife, has a few moments of doubt but not Francis. Kevin Spacey also takes this right up to the edge of satire but does not push it over.  It is close especially since he has frequent asides to us the audience. Both Spacey and Robin Wright Penn do an outstanding acting job as the ultimate political couple. Both Claire and Francis go the extra mile this season in eliminating anyone standing in their way to the White House. The guy they seek to topple as President is a much better person than either of them but he is terribly weak as a President. I personally am looking forward to season 3.

I adored the F.U. cufflinks given to Francis. It's almost as if the character was given this name just so those cufflinks could be used in some future episode!

I was totally floored to see that not only could this season keep up with the first one, it actually surpassed it. This is great television even though it is not really television. The acting in this series is unbelievable. Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright leads a stellar cast of dynamic performers. This season brings you into the seedy world of politics. It examines the top of the food chain. Those in power. It shows the lengths that the power hungry would go to keep that power. It examines and analyses power versus money. It is written in a way where even the most uneducated would start to understand Washington politics.l It is a scary season to watch because it is so believable.

The first episode is stunning, but by the last episode, I was no longer able to suspend my disbelief. Frank has too many skeletons, too many enemies, & unfinished messy business to last long where he's landed.
