Five for Hell is an action flick starring five or six army guys who are trained, then sent to obtain ""Plan K"" from the Nazi army. (For more information, please visit the Internet Movie Database.)

Fun things to look for?

1. A softball or two.

2. Fancy stunts--involving a trampoline and near the end, a knife.

Other then that, expect sporadic slow scenes--accompanied by thrilling action sequences.

WARNING: Should at least be 18 because of INTENSE ACTION SEQUENCES!

Visual affects? Graphics? (Lol)...

When I saw the show on TV, when the camera shot from a distant angle, the people looked long and skinny. However, I think that they might have fixed that--considering that it's on DVD.

So...check it out.",1139184000,2,729,4.861788617886178
