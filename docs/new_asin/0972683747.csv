7794519,5,0972683747,"The DVD `Unveiled' contains two belly dance performances by the very lovely and talented Suhaila Salimpour. Suhaila is dressed in a black and gold outfit in the first performance which is set in what appears to be a sultan's tent adorned with all the accouterments one would expect. As she glides across a floor of sand she moves in and out through layers of veils hanging from the ceiling. Transparent shades of lavender, red and beige surround Suhaila in a truly intoxicating atmosphere that is further accentuated by smoking candles and a smoldering incense burner. The second performance takes place in Romanesque surroundings. She is now dressed in white as she glides and gyrates between massive white pillars reminiscent of a temple priestess or oracle from ages past.

Suhaila is not only enchanting to behold, but her dancing is amazing. Her hypnotic style will draw you into her exotic landscape and have you hanging on every subtle gesture, every rhythmic movement. I've never seen anyone who could wiggle and quiver the way she does and the camera positioning and close-ups are there to capture every exquisite moment.

The two dance numbers encompass a viewing time of approximately 45 minutes in length so it's a little on the short side, but the performances are so marvelously executed and the settings and costumes so lavish and intoxicating you'll soon lose track of time anyway. If you're a belly dance enthusiast or just a guy who appreciates beautiful women you'll watch this DVD repeatedly.",1178582400,2,1512,5.0199203187251
