It covers a lot of his life from the little neighbor kid with a need to throw through his first Superbowl win. The ""never give up"" attitude John displays in his life is inspirational to any athlete or everyday worker. For a 10year old VHS, the quality was still great. I am going to digitize it soon so they tape will remain in top shape for many more years.",1235779200,,446,4.258823529411765

Big John, now owner of the Champion

Colorado Crush in the Ar. FL, is the

hands down best ever. Most career

starts, most career wins. Most play-

off wins, most fourth quarter and come-

back wins, et, al. Only QB to take his

team to five Super Bowls - in 11 years!!",1150329600,,309,4.135593220338983
